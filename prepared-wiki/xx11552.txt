Veganism [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|v|iː|ɡ|ən|ɪ|z|əm[/tpl] is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, as well as following an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of sentient animals. A follower of veganism is known as a vegan.
Distinctions are sometimes made between different categories of veganism. Dietary vegans (or strict vegetarians) refrain from consuming animal products, not only meat but, in contrast to ovo-lacto vegetarians, also eggs, dairy products and other animal-derived substances. The term ethical vegan is often applied to those who not only follow a vegan diet, but extend the vegan philosophy into other areas of their lives, and oppose the use of animals or animal products for any purpose.[ref]"Vegan Diets Become More Popular, More Mainstream", Associated Press/CBS News, 5 January 2011: "Ethical vegans have a moral aversion to harming animals for human consumption ... though the term often is used to describe people who follow the diet, not the larger philosophy."
The term vegan was coined in 1944 by Donald Watson when he co-founded the Vegan Society in England, at first to mean "non-dairy vegetarian" and later to refer to "the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals."[ref]Donald Watson, Vegan News, No. 1, November 1944, and "Interview with Donald Watson", Vegetarians in Paradise, 11 August 2004.
A 2009 research review indicated that vegan diets tend to be higher in dietary fibre, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron and phytochemicals, and lower in calories, saturated fat, cholesterol, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc and vitamin B12.Winston J. Craig, "Health effects of vegan diets", The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 89(5), May 2009, pp. 1627S–1633S (review article): "Vegan diets are usually higher in dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamins C and E, iron, and phytochemicals, and they tend to be lower in calories, saturated fat and cholesterol, long-chain n–3 (omega-3) fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B-12. ... A vegan diet appears to be useful for increasing the intake of protective nutrients and phytochemicals and for minimizing the intake of dietary factors implicated in several chronic diseases." Well-planned vegan diets appear to offer protection against certain degenerative conditions, including heart disease, and are regarded as appropriate for all stages of the life-cycle by the American Dietetic Association, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, and Dietitians of Canada. Because uncontaminated plant foods do not provide vitamin B12 (which is produced by microorganisms such as bacteria), researchers agree that vegans should eat B12-fortified foods or take a supplement.

==History==

===Background===

Vegetarianism can be traced to Ancient India and Greece, but the English word vegetarian came into use in the 19th century to refer to those who avoided meat. The Oxford English Dictionary attributes its earliest known use to the English actress Fanny Kemble (1809–1893), writing in Georgia in the United States in 1839.[ref]Fanny Kemble, Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838–1839, Harper and Brothers, New York, 1839, pp. 197–198: "The sight and smell of raw meat are especially odious to me, and I have often thought that if I had had to be my own cook, I should inevitably become a vegetarian, probably, indeed, return entirely to my green and salad days."
There were several attempts in the 19th century to establish vegan/strict-vegetarian communities. In the United States in 1834 Amos Bronson Alcott (1799–1888), father of novelist Louisa May Alcott (1832–1888), opened the Temple School in Boston, Massachusetts, on strict-vegetarian principles.Karen Iacobbo and Michael Iacobbo, Vegetarians and Vegans in America Today, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006, p. 142. In 1844 he also founded Fruitlands, a community in Harvard, Massachusetts, that opposed the use of animals for any purpose, including farming, though it lasted only seven months.[ref]James D. Hart, "Alcott, Amos Bronson," in The Oxford Companion to American Literature, Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 14.
Vegetarians who were more interested in the moral aspects of diet, rather than in human health, began to discuss abstaining from animal use entirely. An 1851 article in the Vegetarian Society's magazine discussed alternatives to leather for shoes."History of Vegetarianism: The Origin of Some Words", International Vegetarian Union, 6 April 2010: "... as early as 1851 there was an article in the Vegetarian Society magazine (copies still exist) about alternatives to leather for making shoes, there was even a report of someone patenting a new material. So there was always another group who were not just 'strict vegetarians' but also avoided using animal products for clothing or other purposes – naturally they wanted their own 'word' too, but they had a long wait." In 1886 the society published A Plea for Vegetarianism by the English campaigner Henry Salt (1851–1939), which argued for vegetarianism as a moral imperative; Salt was one of the first to make the paradigm shift from the promotion of animal welfare to animal rights.[ref]Henry Stephens Salt, A Plea for Vegetarianism and other essays, The Vegetarian Society, 1886, p. 7.
The first known British vegan cookbook, No Animal Food: Two Essays and 100 Recipes by Rupert H. Wheldon, appeared in London in 1910.[ref]Leah Leneman, "No Animal Food: The Road to Veganism in Britain, 1909–1944",Society and Animals, 7(3), 1999 (pp. 219–228), p. 220.

===Coining the term vegan, founding the Vegan Society===

In July 1943 Leslie J. Cross (1914–1979) of the Leicester Vegetarian Society expressed concern in its newsletter that vegetarians were still consuming cow's milk.Leneman 1999, pp. 222–223. Cross wrote that to produce milk for human consumption the cow has to be separated from her calves soon after their birth: "in order to produce a dairy cow, heart-rending cruelty, and not merely exploitation, is a necessity." In August 1944 several Vegetarian Society members, including Donald Watson (1910–2005), asked the society if they could have a section of its magazine to discuss non-dairy vegetarianism. They were told no, so Watson wrote in the magazine that he wanted to set up his own quarterly newsletter. Thirty readers sent him a shilling to fund it.Donald Watson, "The Early History of the Vegan Movement," The Vegan, Winter 1965, pp. 5–7.
Watson issued the first newsletter, Vegan News, in November 1944 (priced tuppence, or a shilling for a year's subscription); Watson said later that the word vegan ([tpl]IPA|/ˈviːɡən/[/tpl]) represented "the beginning and end of vegetarian.""Interview with Donald Watson", Vegetarians in Paradise, 11 August 2004. Readers also suggested allvega, neo-vegetarian, dairyban, vitan, benevore, sanivores and beaumangeur, but Watson stuck with vegan. The new Vegan Society held its first annual meeting on 15 December 1945 at the Attic Club, High Holborn, London.
Two vegan books appeared around this time. The Leicester Vegetarian Society published Vegetarian Recipes without Dairy Produce by Margaret B. Rawls, and in the summer of 1946 the Vegan Society published Vegan Recipes by Fay K. Henderson.Stepaniak 2000(a))p. 5. In 1951 the society broadened its definition of veganism to "the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals," and pledged to seek an end to the use of animals "for food, commodities, work, hunting, vivisection and all other uses involving exploitation of animal life by man."[ref]Leslie Cross, "Veganism Defined", The Vegetarian World Forum, 5(1), Spring 1951: "In a vegan world the creatures would be reintegrated within the balance and sanity of nature as she is in herself. A great and historic wrong, whose effect upon the course of evolution must have been stupendous, would be righted. The idea that his fellow creatures might be used by man for self-interested purposes would be so alien to human thought as to be almost unthinkable. In this light, veganism is not so much welfare as liberation, for the creatures and for the mind and heart of man; not so much an effort to make the present relationship bearable, as an uncompromising recognition that because it is in the main one of master and slave, it has to be abolished before something better and finer can be built."
According to Joanne Stepaniak, the word vegan was independently published for the first time in 1962, in the Oxford Illustrated Dictionary, defined as "a vegetarian who eats no butter, eggs, cheese or milk."Stepaniak 2000(a), p. 3. World Vegan Day, held every 1 November, was established in 1994 to mark the society's founding date."World Vegan Day", Vegan Society, accessed 13 August 2009.

===Founding the American Vegan Society===

The first vegan society in the United States was founded in 1948 by Catherine Nimmo (1887–1985) of Oceano, California, and Rubin Abramowitz of Los Angeles. Originally from the Netherlands, Nimmo had been a vegan since 1931; when the Vegan Society was founded in England she began distributing its newsletter to her own mailing list.[ref]For Nimmo, see Linda Austin and Norm Hammond, Oceano, Arcadia Publishing, 2010, p. 39.

===Achieving mainstream acceptance (2000s–2010s)===

From the late 1970s a group of scientists in the United States – physicians John A. McDougall, Caldwell Esselstyn, Neal D. Barnard, Dean Ornish, Michael Klaper and Michael Greger, and biochemist T. Colin Campbell – began to argue that diets based on animal fat and animal protein, such as the standard American diet, were detrimental to health. They proposed that a low-fat, plant-based diet would prevent, and might reverse, certain chronic diseases, such as coronary heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers.[ref]For Ornish, Campbell, Esselstyn and Barnard informally discussing veganism and health, see Kathy Freston, Veganist: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, Change the World, Weinstein Publishing, 2011:
In 2011 the Associated Press reported that in the United States the vegan diet was "moving from marginal to mainstream"; chefs said vegan entrees were becoming popular, and chain restaurants began to mark vegan items on their menus."Vegan diets becoming more popular, more mainstream", Associated Press, 6 January 2011. The interest in veganism in the 2010s was reflected in increased page views on Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia article on veganism was viewed 73,000 times in August 2009 but 145,000 times in August 2013; articles on veganism were viewed more during this period than articles on vegetarianism in the English, French, German, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish Wikipedias.[ref]Meat Atlas, Henrich Boll Foundation and Friends of the Earth Europe, 2014, p. 57.
Celebrities, athletes and politicians began to adopt vegan diets, some seriously, some part-time.[ref]Amanda Holpuch, "Al Gore follows Bill Clinton's lead with apparent turn to veganism", The Guardian, 26 November 2013.
In 2010 the European Parliament adopted a food-labelling guideline that defined vegan (in force as of 2015).[ref]"European Parliament legislative resolution of 16 June 2010", European Parliament: "The term 'vegan' shall not be applied to foods that are, or are made from or with the aid of, animals or animal products, including products from living animals."

===Demographics (1996–present)===

Surveys in the United States between 1996 and 2012 suggested that between 0.5 and three percent (1.5 to over nine million people) in that country were vegan. In 1996 three percent said they did not use animals for any purpose.[ref]Mark Damian Duda and Kira C. Young, "Americans' attitudes toward animal rights, animal welfare, and the use of animals," 1996 (cited in Damian and Young, "American Attitudes Toward Scientiﬁc Wildlife Management ...", Effective Public Relations and Communications, p. 10.
In Europe the Times of London estimated in 2005 that there were 250,000 vegans in the UK (out of a population of 60 million), in 2006 The Independent estimated 600,000, and in 2007 two percent of respondents in a British government survey self-identified as vegan.[ref]"Donald Watson", The Times, 8 December 2005.

==Animal products==

===Avoidance===

The issue that divided the 19th- and early 20th-century vegetarians – whether to avoid animal products for reasons of ethics or health – persists. Dietary vegans avoid consuming any animal products (no meat, fish, eggs or dairy products), but might use them in clothing and toiletries.Francione and Garner 2010, p. 257. Against this, ethical vegans see veganism as a philosophy; they reject the commodification of animals and will not use them for food, clothing, entertainment or any other purpose.Francione and Garner 2010, p. 62. The British Vegan Society will only certify a product if it is free of animal involvement as far as possible and practical, including animal testing.[ref]"Criteria for Vegan food", and "Trademark Standards", Vegan Society, accessed 17 December 2012.
Animal products include meat, poultry and seafood, eggs, dairy products, honey and beeswax, fur, leather, wool, silk, goose down and duck feathers; they also include lesser known products such as bone char, bone china, carmine, casein, cochineal, gelatin, isinglass, lanolin, lard, rennet, shellac, tallow, whey and yellow grease. Many of the lesser known ones may not be identified in the list of ingredients.[ref]"Animal ingredients and products", Vegan Peace, accessed 17 December 2012.
Ethical vegans will not use these products and will try to avoid anything tested on animals. They will also avoid certain vaccines; the production of the flu vaccine, for example, involves the use of chicken eggs. Depending on their circumstances, vegans may donate non-vegan items to charity or use them until they wear out. Some vegan clothes, in particular leather alternatives, are made of petroleum-based products, which has triggered criticism because of the environmental damage associated with production.Stepaniak 2000(a), pp. 20, 115–118, 154; see p. 116 for the environmental damage associated with petroleum-based products.

===Milk, eggs, honey and silk===

The main difference between a vegan and vegetarian diet is that vegans exclude eggs and dairy products; ethical vegans state that the production of eggs and dairy causes animal suffering and premature death. In both battery cage and free-range egg production, most male chicks are culled because they will not lay eggs and there is no financial incentive for a producer to keep them."Egg Production & Welfare", Vegetarian Society, accessed 17 December 2012.
To obtain milk from dairy cattle, cows are kept pregnant through artificial insemination to prolong lactation. Male calves are slaughtered at birth, sent for veal production or reared for beef. Female calves are separated from their mothers within 24–48 hours of birth and fed milk replacer, so that the cow's milk is retained for human consumption."Dairy Cows & Welfare", Vegetarian Society, accessed 17 December 2012. After five years or so they are slaughtered to be made into ground-meat products, although they might otherwise live for 20 years.Erik Marcus, Veganism: The New Ethics of Eating, McBooks Press, 2000, pp. 128–129. The situation is similar with goats and their kids."Goats", Vegetarian Society, accessed 17 January 2013.
There is disagreement among vegan groups about avoiding products from insects. Most vegans regard modern beekeeping as cruel and exploitative; once the honey is harvested, it may be substituted with sugar or corn syrup to maintain the colony.Daniel Engber, "The Great Vegan Honey Debate: Is honey the dairy of the insect world?", Slate, 30 July 2008. Neither the Vegan Society nor the American Vegan Society considers the use of honey, silk or other insect products to be suitable for vegans, while Vegan Action and Vegan Outreach regard it as a matter of personal choice.[ref]"Honey: Ain't so sweet for the bees", Vegan Society, accessed 16 December 2012.

==Vegan diet==

===Common dishes and ingredients===

Common vegan dishes include chili and soup, ratatouille, falafel, hummus, veggie burritos, rice and beans, veggie stir-fry, veggie burgers, and pasta dishes such as pasta primavera.
Dishes based on soybeans are a staple of vegan diets because soybeans are a complete protein. They are consumed most often in the form of soy milk and tofu (bean curd), which is soy milk mixed with a coagulant; tofu comes in a variety of textures, depending on water content, from firm, medium firm and extra firm for stews and stir-fries, to soft or silken for salad dressings, desserts and shakes. Soy is also eaten in the form of tempeh and texturized vegetable protein (TVP) (also known as textured soy protein, TSP); TVP is often used in pasta sauces.Reed Mangels, Virginia Messina and Mark Messina, The Dietitian's Guide to Vegetarian Diets, Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2011, p. 444. The wheat-based seitan/gluten is another common source of plant protein. Meat analogues (mock meats) based on soy or gluten come in the form of vegetarian sausage, mince and burgers, and are usually free of animal products.

===Plant milk, ice-cream and cheese===

Plant cream and plant milk – such as soy milk, almond milk, grain milk (oat milk and rice milk) and coconut milk – are used instead of cows' or goats' milk. The most widely available are soy and almond milk. Soy milk provides around 7 g of protein per cup (250 ml or 8 fluid ounces), compared with 8 g of protein per cup of cow's milk. Almond milk is lower in calories, carbohydrates and protein.Monica Reinagel, Nutrition Diva's Secrets for a Healthy Diet, Macmillan 2011, pp. 20–21.
Like animal milk and meat, soy milk is a complete protein, meaning that it contains all the essential amino acids for humans and can be relied upon entirely for protein intake.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, pp. 256–257: "Soy protein products typically have a protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) ... >0.9, which is similar to that of meat and milk protein. Consequently, consuming the recommended dietary allowance (RDA, 0.8 mg/kg body weight bw), for protein entirely in the form of soy will meet the biologic requirement for amino acids. ... Formal recognition of the high quality of soy protein came in the form of a ruling by the USDA States Department of Agriculture allowing soy protein to replace 100 percent of meat protein in the Federal School Lunch Program." Soy milk alone should not be used as a replacement for breast milk for babies; babies who are not breastfed need commercial infant formula, which is normally based on cow's milk or soy (the latter is known as soy-based infant formula or SBIF).[ref]Reed Mangels. The Everything Vegan Pregnancy Book, Adams Media, 2011, p. 174.
Cheese analogues are made from soy, nuts and tapioca. Vegan cheeses like Chreese, Daiya, Sheese, Teese and Tofutti can replace both the taste and meltability of dairy cheese.Sarah E. Mosko, "The Cheese Challenge", E/The Environmental Magazine, 22(5), Sept–Oct 2011, pp. 38–39: "After melting and taste-testing four top brands, the site veganbaking.net concluded that vegan cheddar and mozzarella shreds made primarily from tapioca or arrowroot flour combined with various oils from Daiya had both the flavor and melt-ability to stand up to their dairy counterparts." Nutritional yeast is a common cheese substitute in vegan recipes.Coscarelli 2012, p. 4. Cheese substitutes can be made at home, using recipes from Joanne Stepaniak's Vegan Vittles (1996), The Nutritional Yeast Cookbook (1997), and The Uncheese Cookbook (2003), and Mikoyo Schinner's Artisan Vegan Cheese (2012).For Stepaniak, see Stepaniak 2000(a), p. 188. One recipe for vegan brie involves combining cashews, soy yogurt and coconut oil.Kay Stepkin, "Vegan cheese replaces lingering brie craving", Chicago Tribune, 16 January 2013. Butter can be replaced with a vegan margarine such as Earth Balance.Coscarelli 2012, p. 12.

===Egg replacements===

Vegan (egg-free) mayonnaise brands include Vegenaise, Nayonaise, Miso Mayo, and Plamil's Egg-Free Mayo.[ref]Victoria Moran and Adair Moran, Main Street Vegan, Penguin 2012, p. 168.
For vegan pancakes a tablespoon of baking powder can be used instead of eggs.Coscarelli 2012, p. 183. Other ingredients include, to replace one egg, one tablespoon of soy flour and one tablespoon of water; a quarter cup of mashed bananas, mashed prunes or apple sauce; or in batter two tablespoons of white flour, half a tablespoon of vegetable oil, two tablespoons of water and half a tablespoon of baking powder. Silken (soft) tofu and mashed potato can also be used."Egg Replacements", People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, accessed 13 December 2012.

===Vegan food groups===

Since 1991 the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) has recommended a no-cholesterol, low-fat vegan diet based on what they call the New Four Food Groups: fruit, legumes, grains and vegetables. Legumes include peas, beans, lentils and peanuts. PCRM recommends three or more servings a day of fruit (at least one of which is high in vitamin C, such as citrus fruit, melon or strawberries), two or more of protein-rich legumes (such as soybeans, which can be consumed as soy milk, tofu or tempeh), five or more of whole grains (such as corn, barley, rice and wheat, in products such as bread and tortillas), and four or more of vegetables (dark-green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, and dark-yellow and orange such as carrots or sweet potatoes)."The New Four Food Groups", Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, accessed 16 January 2013.
The PCRM vegan food group was intended to replace the Four Food Groups – meat, milk, vegetables and fruit, and cereal and breads – recommended by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) from 1956 until 1992.Marian Burros, "Eating Well; Rethink 4 Food Groups, Doctors Tell U.S.", The New York Times, 10 April 1991. In 1992 the USDA replaced its model with the food guide pyramid, and in 2011 with MyPlate, which is divided into five food groups: grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy and protein (meat, poultry, seafood, beans and peas, eggs, processed soy products, nuts and seeds).[ref]William Neuman, "Nutrition Plate Unveiled, Replacing Food Pyramid", The New York Times, 2 June 2011.

===Nutrients===

====Protein====

Proteins are composed of amino acids. Nutritionist Reed Mangels writes that omnivores generally obtain a third of their protein from plant foods, and ovo-lacto vegetarians a half.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p. 71; for their chapter on protein, see pp. 65–79. Vegans obtain all their protein from plant sources. A common question is whether plant protein supplies an adequate amount of the essential amino acids, which cannot be synthesized by the human body.[tpl]cite journal |author=Krajcovicova-Kudlackova M, Babinska K, Valachovicova M |title=Health benefits and risks of plant proteins |journal=Bratislavské Lekárske Listy |volume=106 |issue=6-7 |pages=231–4 |year=2005 |pmid=16201743[/tpl]
Sources of plant protein include legumes, such as soy beans (consumed as tofu, tempeh, texturized vegetable protein, soy milk and edamame), peas, peanuts, black beans and chickpeas (the latter often eaten as hummus); grains such as quinoa (pronounced keenwa), brown rice, corn, barley, bulgur and wheat (often eaten as whole-wheat bread and seitan); and nuts and seeds, such as almonds, hemp and sunflower seeds.[ref]Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, pp. 72, 78.
Soy beans and quinoa are known as complete proteins because they each contain all the essential amino acids.[ref][tpl]cite journal |author=Messina M, Messina V |title=The role of soy in vegetarian diets |journal=Nutrients |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=855–88 |year=2010 |month=August |pmid=22254060 |doi=10.3390/nu2080855[/tpl]
Traditional combinations that contain high amounts of all the essential amino acids are rice and beans, corn and beans, and hummus and whole-wheat pita. The American Dietetic Association said in 2009 that a variety of plant foods consumed over the course of a day can provide all the essential amino acids for healthy adults, which means that protein combining in the same meal may not be necessary.[ref]Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p. 75ff.

====Vitamin B12====

Vitamin B12 is a bacterial product needed for cell division, the formation and maturation of red blood cells, the synthesis of DNA, and normal nerve function. A deficiency can lead to several health problems, including megaloblastic anemia and nerve damage.[ref]Reed Mangels, Virginia Messina, and Mark Messina, "Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)," The Dietitian's Guide to Vegetarian Diets, Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2011, pp. 181–192.
Neither plants nor animals make B12; it is produced by microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi and algae. Herbivorous animals obtain it from bacteria in their rumens, either by absorbing it or by eating their own cecotrope faeces; rabbits, for example, produce and eat cecal pellets. When those animals are eaten, they become sources of B12. Plants from the ground that are not washed properly may contain B12 from bacteria in the soil, often from faeces; drinking water may also be contaminated with B12-producing bacteria, particularly in the developing world. Mangels et al write that bacteria in the human digestive tract produce B12, but most of it is not absorbed and is expelled in the faeces, with tiny amounts also expelled in the urine. James Halsted, a medical researcher, reported in the 1960s that a group of villagers in Iran eating very little or no animal protein were found to have normal B12 levels because they were living with animal manure near their homes, and were eating vegetables grown in human manure and not thoroughly washed. The human mouth is another source of B12, but in small amounts and possibly analogue (not biologically active).[ref]Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p. 188.
Western vegan diets are likely to be deficient in B12 because of increased hygiene. Vegans can obtain B12 by taking a supplement or by eating fortified foods, such as fortified soy milk or cereal, where it may be listed as cobalamin or cyanocobalamin.[ref]Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p. 179.
There is disagreement within the vegan community as to whether supplementation is needed; several studies of vegans who did not take supplements or eat fortified food, including in Western countries, have found no sign of B12 deficiency.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, pp. 183–184. According to Mangels et al, the disagreement is caused by the lack of a gold standard for assessing B12 status, and because there are very few studies of long-term vegans who have not used supplements or fortified foods.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, pp. 182–183. There are reports that certain plant foods are sources of B12; fermented foods such as tempeh and miso, as well as edible seaweed (such as arame, wakame, nori, and kombu), spirulina, and certain greens, grains and legumes, have been cited as B12 sources, as has rainwater. According to Mangels et al, tiny amounts have been found in barley malt syrup, shiitake mushrooms, parsley and sourdough bread, and higher amounts in spirulina and nori, but these products may be sources of inactive B12.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p. 187. They write that all Western vegans not using supplements or eating fortified foods will probably develop a B12 deficiency, although it may take decades to appear.

====Calcium====

Calcium is needed to maintain bone health, and for a number of metabolic functions, including muscle function, vascular contraction and vasodilation, nerve transmission, intracellular signalling and hormonal secretion. Ninety-nine percent of the body's calcium is stored in the bones and teeth. The RDA is 200 mg for 0–6 months, 260 mg for 7–12 months, 700 mg for 1–3 years, 1,000 mg for 4–8 years, 1,300 mg for 9–18 years, 1,000 mg for 19–50 years, 1,000 mg for 51–70 years (men) and 1,200 mg (women), and 1,200 mg for 71+ years.[ref]"Calcium", Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health.
Vegans are advised to eat three servings per day of a high-calcium food, such as fortified soy milk, fortified tofu, almonds or hazelnuts, and to take a supplement as necessary. Plant sources include broccoli, turnip and cabbage, such as Chinese cabbage (bok choi) and kale; the bioavailability of calcium in spinach is poor. Whole-wheat bread contains calcium; grains contain small amounts. Because vitamin D is needed for calcium absorption, vegans should make sure they also consume enough vitamin D (see below).Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p. 110.
The EPIC-Oxford study suggested that vegans have an increased risk of bone fractures over meat eaters and vegetarians, likely because of lower dietary calcium intake; vegans consuming more than 525 mg/day have a risk of fractures similar to that of other groups.[ref]P. Appleby et al, "Comparative fracture risk in vegetarians and nonvegetarians in EPIC-Oxford", European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 61(12), February 2007, pp. 1400–1406: "In conclusion, fracture risk was similar for meat eaters, fish eaters and vegetarians in this study. The higher fracture risk among vegans appeared to be a consequence of their considerably lower mean calcium intake. Vegans, who do not consume dairy products, a major source of calcium in most diets, should ensure that they obtain adequate calcium from suitable sources such as almonds, sesame seeds, tahini (sesame paste), calcium-set tofu, calcium-fortified drinks and low-oxalate leafy green vegetables such as kale ..."

====Vitamin D====

Vitamin D (calciferol) is needed for several functions, including calcium absorption, enabling mineralization of bone, and bone growth. Without it bones can become thin and brittle; together with calcium it offers protection against osteoporosis. Vitamin D is produced in the body when ultraviolet rays from the sun hit the skin; outdoor exposure is needed because UVB radiation does not penetrate glass. It is present in very few foods (mostly salmon, tuna, mackerel, cod liver oil, with small amounts in cheese, egg yolks and beef liver, and in some mushrooms).[ref]"Vitamin D", Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health.
Most vegan diets contain little or no vitamin D, unless the food is fortified (such as fortified soy milk), so supplements may be needed depending on exposure to sunlight. Vitamin D comes in two forms. Cholecalciferol (D3) is synthesized in the skin after exposure to the sun or consumed in the form of animal products; when produced industrially it is taken from lanolin in sheep's wool. Ergocalciferol (D2) is derived from ergosterol from yeast and is suitable for vegans. Conflicting studies have suggested that the two forms may or may not be bioequivalent.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p. 209. According to a 2011 report by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences, the differences between D2 and D3 do not affect metabolism, both function as prohormones, and when activated exhibit identical responses in the body.Ross et al (Food and Nutrition Board) 2011, p. 75.
Supplements should be used with caution because vitamin D can be toxic, especially in children.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p. 208. The RDA is 10 mcg for 0–12 months, 15 mcg for 1–70 years, and 20 mcg for 70+. People with little or no sun exposure may need more, perhaps up to 25 mcg daily.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, pp. 207–208. The daily tolerable upper intake level (daily) for 9 years to adulthood is 100 mcg, according to the National Institutes of Health; for children it is 25 mcg for 0–6 months, 38 mcg for 7–12 months, 63 mcg for 1–3 years, and 75 mcg for 4–8 years.
The extent to which sun exposure is sufficient to meet the body's needs depends on the time of day, cloud and smog cover, skin melanin content, whether sunscreen is worn, and the season. According to the US National Institutes of Health, most people can obtain and store sufficient vitamin D from sunlight in the spring, summer and fall months, even in the far north. They report that some researchers recommend 5–30 minutes of sun exposure without sunscreen between ten in the morning and three o'clock in the afternoon, at least twice a week. They also report that tanning beds emitting 2–6 per cent UVB radiation will have a similar effect, though tanning may be inadvisable for other reasons.

====Iron====

Vegetarian and vegan diets usually contain as much iron as animal-based diets, or more; vegan diets generally contain more iron than vegetarian ones because dairy products contain very little. There are concerns about the bioavailability of iron from plant foods, assumed by some researchers to be around 5–15 percent compared to 18 percent from a nonvegetarian diet.[ref]Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p. 138ff, 143–144.
The RDA for nonvegetarians is 11 mg for 7–12 months, 7 mg for 1–3 years, 10 mg for 4–8 years, and 8 mg for 9–13 years. The RDA then changes for men and women to 11 mg for 14–18 years (men) and 15 mg for 14–18 years (women), 8 mg for 19–50 years (men) and 18 mg for 19–50 years (women). It returns to 8 mg for 51+ years (men and women)."Iron", Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health. Mangels writes that because of the lower bioavailability of iron from plant sources, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences established a separate RDA for vegetarians and vegans of 14 mg for vegetarian men and postmenopausal women, and 33 mg for premenopausal women not using oral contraceptives.Mangels, Messina and Messina 2011, p. 143. Supplements should be used only with caution after consulting a physician, because iron can accumulate within the body and cause damage to organs; this is particularly true of anyone suffering from hemochromatosis, a relatively common condition that can remain undiagnosed. The daily tolerable upper intake level, according to the National Institutes of Health, is 40 mg for 7 months to 13 years, and 45 mg for 14+.
According to the Vegetarian Resource Group, high-iron foods suitable for vegans include black-strap molasses, lentils, tofu, quinoa, kidney beans and chickpeas.Davida Gypsy Breier and Reed Mangels, Vegan & Vegetarian FAQ: Answers to Your Frequently Asked Questions, Vegetarian Resource Group, 2001, p. 27. Nutritionist Tom Sanders writes that iron absorption can be enhanced by eating a source of vitamin C along with a plant source of iron, and by avoiding coingesting anything that would inhibit absorption, such as tannin in tea.[ref]T. A. Sanders, "The nutritional adequacy of plant-based diets", The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society, 58(2), 1999, pp. 265–269.

====Omega-3 fatty acids====

Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid, is found in leafy green vegetables and nuts, and in vegetable oils such as canola and flaxseed oil. The Adequate Intake for ALA is 1.1–1.6 g/day."Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Health", Office of Dietary Supplements, National Institutes of Health. Vegan Outreach suggests vegans take 1/4 teaspoon of flaxseed oil (also known as linseed oil) daily, and use oils containing low amounts of omega-6 fatty acids, such as olive, canola, avocado or peanut oil.Jack Norris, "Omega-3 Fatty Acid Recommendations for Vegetarians", Vegan Outreach, accessed 4 February 2011.

====Iodine====

Iodine supplementation may be necessary for vegans in countries where salt is not typically iodized, where it is iodized at low levels, or where, as in Britain and Ireland, dairy products are relied upon for iodine delivery because of low levels in the soil. Iodine can be obtained from most vegan multivitamins or from regular consumption of seaweeds, such as kelp.[ref]"Iodine", Vegan Outreach, 26 December 2006: "Iodine is needed for healthy thyroid function which regulates metabolism. Both too much and too little iodine can result in abnormal thyroid metabolism. ... Studies have shown that vegans in Europe (where salt is either not iodized or not iodized at high enough levels) who do not supplement (as well as those who oversupplement) have indications of abnormal thyroid function."

===Health arguments===

There was growing scientific consensus, as of the 2000s, that a plant-based diet reduces the risk of a number of degenerative diseases, including coronary artery disease, diabetes, cancer, osteoporosis, kidney disease and dementia.[ref]Note that several sources use the word vegetarian to refer to an entirely plant-based diet:
The American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada said in 2003 that properly planned vegan diets were nutritionally adequate for all stages of life, including pregnancy and lactation. People avoiding meat are reported to have lower body mass index; from this follows lower death rates from ischemic heart disease, lower blood cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, and fewer incidences of type 2 diabetes, and of prostate and colon cancers. In 2013 the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council also recognized a well-planned vegan diet as a viable option for people of any age; they recommended that vegans eat B12-fortified foods or take supplements.[ref][tpl]cite journal |title=Position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada: vegetarian diets |journal=Canadian Journal of Dietetic Practice and Research |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=62–81 |year=2003 |pmid=12826028 |quote=Well-planned vegan and other types of vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of the life-cycle including during pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence.[/tpl]
Between 1980 and 1984 the Oxford Vegetarian Study recruited 11,000 subjects (6,000 vegetarians and a control group of 5,000 non-vegetarians) and followed up after 12 years. The study indicated that vegans had lower total- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations than the meat-eaters, and that death rates were lower in the non-meat eaters. The authors wrote that mortality from ischemic heart disease was positively associated with higher dietary cholesterol levels and the consumption of animal fat. They also wrote that the non-meat-eaters had half the risk of the meat eaters of requiring an emergency appendectomy, and that vegans in the UK may be prone to iodine deficiency.[tpl]cite journal |author=Appleby PN, Thorogood M, Mann JI, Key TJ |title=The Oxford Vegetarian Study: an overview |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=70 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=525S–531S |year=1999 |month=September |pmid=10479226 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10479226[/tpl]
A 1999 meta-analysis of five studies comparing mortality rates in Western countries found that mortality from ischemic heart disease was 26 percent lower in vegans than in regular meat-eaters. This was compared to 20 percent lower in occasional meat eaters, 34 percent lower in pescetarians (those who ate fish but no other meat), and 34 percent lower in ovo-lacto vegetarians (those who ate no meat, but did consume animal milk and eggs). No significant difference in mortality from other causes was found between vegetarian/vegan and non-vegetarian diets.[ref][tpl]cite journal |author=Key TJ, Fraser GE, Thorogood M, et al. |title=Mortality in vegetarians and nonvegetarians: detailed findings from a collaborative analysis of 5 prospective studies |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=70 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=516S–524S |year=1999 |month=September |pmid=10479225 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10479225 |quote=Further categorization of diets showed that, in comparison with regular meat eaters, mortality from ischemic heart disease was 20% lower in occasional meat eaters, 34% lower in people who ate fish but not meat, 34% lower in lactoovovegetarians, and 26% lower in vegans. There were no significant differences between vegetarians and nonvegetarians in mortality from cerebrovascular disease, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, or all other causes combined.[/tpl]
The American Dietetic Association indicated in 2003 that vegetarian diets may be more common among adolescents with eating disorders, but that the adoption of a vegetarian diet may serve to camouflage an existing disorder, rather than cause one. Other studies supported that conclusion.[ref][tpl]cite journal |author=O'Connor MA, Touyz SW, Dunn SM, Beumont PJ |title=Vegetarianism in anorexia nervosa? A review of 116 consecutive cases |journal=The Medical Journal of Australia |volume=147 |issue=11-12 |pages=540–2 |year=1987 |pmid=3696039 |quote=In only four (6.3 percent) of these did meat avoidance predate the onset of their anorexia nervosa.[/tpl]

===Pregnancy, babies and children===

As of 2003 the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada considered well-planned vegan diets "appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including during pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood and adolescence."[tpl]cite journal |title=Position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada: vegetarian diets |journal=Canadian Journal of Dietetic Practice and Research |volume=64 |issue=2 |pages=62–81 |year=2003 |pmid=12826028[/tpl] The Swiss Federal Nutrition Commission and the German Society for Nutrition cautioned against a vegan diet for pregnant women and children as of 2006 and 2011 respectively. The American Dietetic Association added that a regular source of B12 is crucial for pregnant, lactating and breastfeeding women.See American Dietetic Association, p. 754. According to Reed Mangels, maternal stores of B12 appear not to cross the placenta,Ann Reed Mangels, "Vegetarian diets in pregnancy," in Carol Jean Lammi-Keefe, Sarah C. Couch, and Elliot H. Philipson (eds.), Handbook of Nutrition and Pregnancy. Humana Press, 2008, p. 215. and researchers have reported cases of vitamin B12 deficiency in lactating vegetarian mothers that were linked to deficiencies and neurological disorders in their children.[ref][tpl]cite journal |author=Pepper MR, Black MM |title=B12 in fetal development |journal=Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=619–23 |year=2011 |month=August |pmid=21664980 |doi=10.1016/j.semcdb.2011.05.005[/tpl]
Newspapers reported cases of malnutrition during the 2000s in children whose parents said they were vegan. A 12-year-old girl in Scotland who had eaten no meat or dairy since birth was found in 2008 to be suffering from rickets (caused by a lack of vitamin D), and had several fractures.Rob Davies, "Couple face questioning after vegan daughter suffers bone disease", The Daily Telegraph, 8 June 2008. In 2000 a nine-month-old girl died in London after her vegan mother fed her a fruitarian diet of raw fruit and nuts."Fruit diet mother found dead", BBC News, 21 August 2003. In 2004 a six-week-old boy died in Atlanta, Georgia, after his vegan parents appear to have fed him mostly apple juice and soy milk; the prosecution argued that the case was not about veganism, but that the child had simply not been fed.[ref]Kate Moisse, "Atlanta Couple Gets Life for Starving 6-Week-Old Son", ABC News, 13 September 2011.

==Vegan toiletries==

The British Vegan Society criteria for vegan certification are that the product contain no animal products, and that neither the product nor its ingredients have been tested on animals by the manufacturer, by others on behalf of the manufacturer, or by anyone over whom the manufacturer has control. The society's website contains a list of certified companies and products."Trademark Standards" and Trademark search, British Vegan Society. Beauty Without Cruelty is well-known within the vegan community as a manufacturer of vegan toiletries and cosmetics. Animal Aid in the UK sells vegan toiletries and other products online, as does Honesty Cosmetics."Welcome", Beauty Without Cruelty; beautywithoutcruelty.com;"Cruelty-free toiletries", Animal Aid; Honesty Cosmetics. Kiss My Face sells a range of vegan toiletries in the United States, Canada and the UK. Lush sells products online; the company says that 83 percent of its products are vegan. Haut Minerals in Canada makes a range of vegan products, including a vegan BB cream.Vegan products, Kiss My Face; "Happy World Vegan Day!", Lush; "Vegan BB cream souffles", Haut Minerals. In South Africa, Esse Organic Skincare is one of several companies certified by Beauty Without Cruelty. The Choose Cruelty Free website in Australia lists vegan products available there.Sasha-wyatt Minter. "Beauty Without Cruelty- Approved Products", All4Women.co.za, 9 September 2009; "Philosophy", Esse Organic Skincare; "Accredited Cruelty-Free Vegan Companies", Choose Cruelty Free.
Because animal ingredients are cheap, they are ubiquitous in toiletries. After animals are slaughtered for meat, the leftovers (bones, brains, eyes, spines and other parts) are put through the rendering process, and some of that material, especially the fats, ends up in toiletries and cosmetics. Vegans often refer to Animal Ingredients A to Z (2004) to check which ingredients might be animal-derived. Common animal products include tallow in soap, and glycerine (derived from collagen), which is used as a lubricant and humectant in haircare products, moisturizers, shaving foam, soap and toothpaste; there is a plant-based form but the glycerine in most products is animal-based. Lanolin from sheep's wool is another common ingredient, found in lip balm and moisturizers, as is stearic acid, used in face creams, shaving foam and shampoos; as with glycerine, it can be plant-based but most manufacturers use the animal-derived form. Lactic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid derived from animal milk, is often found in moisturizers, as is allantoin, derived from the comfrey plant or cow's urine, and found in shampoos, moisturizers and toothpaste.[ref]Animal Ingredients A to Z. E. G. Smith Collective, 2004, 3rd edition.

==Philosophy: ethical and environmental perspectives==

===Ethical veganism===

====Arguments====

Ethical veganism is based on opposition to speciesism, the assignment of different values to individuals on the basis of their species membership alone. Carol J. Adams, the vegan-feminist writer, has used the concept of the absent referent to describe the detachment between the consumer and the consumed.Carol J. Adams, The Sexual Politics of Meat, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000, p. 14: "Behind every meal of meat is an absence: the death of the animal whose place the meat takes. ... The function of the absent referent is to keep our 'meat' separated from any idea that she or he was once an animal ... to keep something from being seen as having been someone."
There is a division within animal rights theory between a rights-based or deontological approach and utilitarian or consequentialist theory, which is reflected in the debate about the moral basis of veganism. Tom Regan is a rights theorist who argues that animals possess value as "subjects-of-a-life," because they have beliefs and desires, an emotional life, memory, and the ability to initiate action in pursuit of goals; they must therefore be viewed as ends in themselves, not as a means to an end. He argues that the right of subjects-of-a-life not to be harmed can be overridden when outweighed by other valid moral principles, but that the reasons cited for eating animal products – pleasure, convenience and the economic interests of farmers – are not weighty enough to do that.Tom Regan, The Case for Animal Rights, University of California Press, 1983, p. 243, 333–334, 394.

===="Paris exemption"====

Peter Singer argues from a utilitarian perspective that there is no moral or logical justification for refusing to count animal suffering as a consequence when making ethical decisions, and that sentience is "the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others."Peter Singer, Practical Ethics, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 50. He argues that killing animals should be rejected unless necessary for survival.Catherine Clyne, "Singer Says", Satya magazine, October 2006; Singer 1999, p. 60ff. Unlike Francione, Singer supports what is known as the "Paris exemption": if you find yourself in a fine restaurant, allow yourself to eat what you want, and if you have no access to vegan food, go vegetarian.[ref]Peter Singer and Jim Mason, The Way We Eat, Rodale, 2006, pp. 282–283.
Singer's support for the "Paris exemption" is reflected within the animal rights movement by the divide between the protectionist side (represented by Singer and PETA), according to which incremental change can achieve reform, and the abolitionist side (represented by Regan and Francione), according to which apparent welfare reform serves only to persuade the public that animal use is morally unproblematic.[ref]Clyne, October 2006.
Francione writes that this is similar to arguing that, because human rights abuses can never be eliminated, we should not safeguard human rights in situations we control. By failing to ask a server whether something contains animal products, in the interest of avoiding a fuss, he argues that we reinforce the idea that the moral rights of animals are a matter of convenience. He concludes from this that the protectionist position fails even on its own consequentialist terms.Francione and Garner 2010, pp. 72–73.

===Environmental veganism===

====Resources and the environment====

Environmental vegans focus on conservation rather than animal rights: they reject the use of animal products on the premise that practices such as farming – particularly factory farming – fishing, hunting and trapping are environmentally unsustainable. Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society said in 2010 that all Sea Shepherd ships are vegan for environmental reasons: "Forty percent of the fish caught from the oceans is fed to livestock – pigs and chickens are becoming major aquatic predators."Shapiro 2010.
In November 2006 a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization report, Livestock's Long Shadow, linked animal agriculture to environmental damage. It concluded that livestock farming (primarily of cows, chickens and pigs) has an impact on almost all aspects of the environment: air, land, soil, water, biodiversity and climate change.[ref]Henning Steinfeld et al, Livestock's Long Shadow (large pdf file). Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2006, p. 3.
Greenhouse gas emissions are not limited to animal husbandry. Plant agriculture such as rice cultivation can also cause environmental problems.[ref]Heinz-Ulrich Neue, "Methane emission from rice fields", BioScience, 43(7), 1993, pp. 466–473.

====Debate about animals killed in crop harvesting====

Steven Davis, a professor of animal science at Oregon State University, asked Tom Regan in 2001 what the difference was between killing a field mouse while cultivating crops, and killing a pig for the same reason, namely so that human beings could eat. Regan responded with what Davis called the "Least Harm Principle," according to which we must choose the food products that, overall, cause the least harm to the least number of animals. Davis argued that a plant-based diet would kill more than one containing beef from grass-fed ruminants.
Andy Lamey, a philosopher at Monash University, calls this the "burger vegan" argument, namely that if human beings were to eat cows raised on a diet of grass, not grain, fewer animals would be killed overall, because the number of mice, rats, raccoons and other animals killed during the harvest outnumbers the deaths involved in raising cows for beef.Andy Lamey, "Food Fight! Davis versus Regan on the Ethics of Eating Beef", Journal of Social Philosophy, 38(2), 2009 (pp. 331–348), p. 331.
Based on a study finding that wood mouse populations dropped from 25 to five per hectare after harvest (attributed to migration and mortality), Davis estimated that 10 animals per hectare are killed from crop farming every year. He argued that if all [tpl]convert|120000000|acre|km2[/tpl] of cropland in the continental United States were used for a vegan diet, approximately 500 million animals would die each year. But if half the cropland were converted to ruminant pastureland, he estimated that only 900,000 animals would die each year – assuming people switched from the eight billion poultry killed each year to beef, lamb and dairy products. Therefore, he argued, according to the least-harm principle we should convert to a ruminant-based diet rather than a plant-based one.[ref]S. L. Davis, "Least harm principle suggests that humans should eat beef, lamb, dairy, not a vegan diet", Proceedings of the Third Congress of the European Society for Agricultural and Food Ethics, 2001, pp. 440–450.
Davis's analysis was criticized in 2003 by Gaverick Matheny in the Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics. Matheny argued that Davis had miscalculated the number of animal deaths, based his figures on land area rather than per consumer, and had confined his analysis to grass-fed ruminants, rather than factory-farmed animals. He wrote that Davis had also equated lives with lives worth living, focusing on numbers rather than including in his calculations the harm done to animals raised for food, which can involve pain from branding, dehorning and castration, a life of confinement, transport without food or water to a slaughterhouse, and a frightening death. Matheny argued that vegetarianism "likely allows a greater number of animals with lives worth living to exist."Gaverick Matheny, "Least Harm: A Defense of Vegetarianism from Steven Davis's Omnivorous Proposal", Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics, 16(5), 2003, pp. 505–511.
Andy Lamey further argued that Davis's calculation of harvest-related deaths was flawed. It was based on two studies. One study included deaths from predation, which Lamey wrote is morally unobjectionable for Regan because not related to human action. The other examined production of a nonstandard crop (sugarcane), which Lamey wrote has little relevance to deaths associated with typical crop production.Lamey 2009, pp. 336, 338. Lamey also maintained, like Matheny, that accidental deaths are ethically distinct from intentional ones, and that if Davis includes accidental animal deaths in the moral cost of veganism, he must also include the accidental human deaths caused by his proposed diet, which, Lamey wrote, leaves "Davis, rather than Regan, with the less plausible argument."Lamey 2009, p. 344.
