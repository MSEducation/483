The first episode of the show, "Planet Pirates", was listed on the press release for the The Best of Warner Bros.: Hanna Barbera 25 Cartoon Collection DVD set to be released on May 21, 2013. However due to an inaccuracy on that press announcement the episode is among several that weren't on the actual DVD set. http://www.cartoonbrew.com/dvd/warner-bros-anniversary-dvd-set-salutes-hanna-barbera-76903.htm
