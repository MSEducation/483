The Rapture were an indie rock band based in New York City. The band's final line-up consisted of lead vocalist/guitarist Luke Jenner, drummer/percussionist Vito Roccoforte and keyboardist/saxophonist/bassist/percussionist Gabriel Andruzzi. The band mixed influences from many genres including post-punk, acid house, disco, electronica and rock, pioneering the post-punk revival genre.  They were forerunners of the post-punk revival of the early 2000s, as they mixed their early post-punk sound with electronic and dance elements.
