Ludwik Lazarus Zamenhof (15 December 1859 – 14 April 1917) was the creator of Esperanto, the world's most successful constructed language, and a physician by profession. He grew up fascinated by the idea of a world without war, and believed that this could happen with the help of a new international language which he first developed in 1873 while still in school.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Zamenhof_Ludwik |title=Zamenhof, Ludwik (1859–1917) |publisher=YIVO Institute for Jewish Research |work=The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe |year=2010 |accessdate=19 December 2013 |author=Gabriela Zalewska |others=Trans. by Anna Grojec[/tpl]

==Biography==

Zamenhof was born on 15 December (3 December OS) 1859 in the town of Białystok in the Russian Partition (north-eastern Poland) in the age of national insurrections. His parents were of Lithuanian Jewish descent, and his wife was born in Kaunas, in one of the biggest Jewish centres of the time. He stated that his native language was Russian,In a letter to a Th. Thorsteinsson dated 8 March 1901 he wrote,[tpl]Cite quote|date=January 2014[/tpl] Mia gepatra lingvo estas la rusa; sed nun mi parolas pli pole... "My native language is Russian, but now I speak more Polish..." See also his biographers A. Zakrzewski and E. Wiesenfeld. but he also spoke Yiddish and Polish;[tpl]Cite journal |author=Claude Piron |title=Kontribuaĵo al la studo pri la influoj de la jida sur Esperanton |journal=Jewish Language Review |volume=4 |year=1984 |url=http://user.in-berlin.de/~maxnet/esperanto/piron/jida.htm[/tpl] it was Polish that became the native language of his children. His father was a teacher of German, and he also spoke that language fluently. Later he learned French, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and English, and had an interest in Italian, Spanish and Lithuanian.
In addition to the Yiddish-speaking Jewish majority, the population of Białystok was made up of Poles and Belarusians, with smaller groups of Russians, Germans, Lipka Tatars and others. Zamenhof was saddened and frustrated by the many quarrels among these groups. He supposed that the main reason for the hate and prejudice lay in the mutual misunderstanding caused by the lack of one common language. If such a language existed, Zamenhof postulated, it could play the role of a neutral communication tool between people of different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.
As a student at secondary school in Warsaw, Zamenhof made attempts to create some kind of international language with a grammar that was very rich, but also very complex. When he later studied English, he decided that the international language must have a simpler grammar. Apart from his parents' native languages Russian and Yiddish and his adopted language Polish, his linguistics attempts were also aided by his mastering of German, a good passive understanding of Latin, Hebrew and French, and a basic knowledge of Greek, English and Italian.Holzhaus, Adolf: Doktoro kaj lingvo Esperanto. Helsinki : Fondumo Esperanto. 1969
By 1878, his project Lingwe uniwersala was almost finished. However, Zamenhof was too young then to publish his work. Soon after graduation from school he began to study medicine, first in Moscow, and later in Warsaw. In 1885, Zamenhof graduated from a university and began his practice as a doctor in Veisiejai and after 1886 as an ophthalmologist in Płock and Vienna. While healing people there he continued to work on his project of an international language.
For two years he tried to raise funds to publish a booklet describing the language until he received the financial help from his future wife's father. In 1887, the book titled Международный язык. Предисловие и полный учебник (International language: Foreword and complete textbook) was published in RussianKeith Brown and Sarah Ogilvie, Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World (Elsevier, 2009: ISBN 0-08-087774-5), p. 375. under the pseudonym "Doktoro Esperanto" (Doctor Hopeful). Zamenhof initially called his language "Lingvo internacia" (international language), but those who learned it began to call it Esperanto after his pseudonym, and this soon became the official name for the language. For Zamenhof this language, far from being merely a communication tool, was a way of promoting the peaceful coexistence of different people and cultures.[tpl]citation |title=Discouraging Words |magazine=Failure Magazine |date=2009-07-20 |first=Jason |last=Zasky |quote=But in terms of invented languages, it's the most outlandishly successful invented language ever.

===Work on Yiddish language and Jewish issues===

In 1879, Zamenhof wrote the first grammar of the Yiddish language, which he published in part years later in the Yiddish magazine Lebn un visnshaft.Vilnius, 1909; see Esperanto translation as Pri jida gramatiko kaj reformo en la jida in Hebreo el la geto: De cionismo al hilelismo, Eldonejo Ludovikito, vol. 5, 1976 The complete original Russian text of this manuscript with parallel Esperanto translation was only published in 1982 (translated by Adolf Holzhaus in L. Zamenhof, provo de gramatiko de novjuda lingvo, Helsinki, p. 9-36). In this work, not only does he provide a review of Yiddish grammar, but also proposes its transition to the Latin script and other orthographic innovations. In the same period, Zamenhof wrote some other works in Yiddish, including perhaps the first survey of Yiddish poetics (see p. 50 in the above-cited book).
In 1882, a wave of pogroms in the Russian empire motivated Zamenhof to take part in the early Zionist movement, the Hibbat Zion.[tpl]cite journal |author=N. Z. Maimon |journal=Nica Literatura Revuo |issue=3/5 |date=May–June 1958 |title=La cionista periodo en la vivo de Zamenhof |pages=165–177 |url=http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/Literaturo/Revuoj/nlr/nlr35/cionistau.html [/tpl] He left the movement in 1887, and in 1901 published a statement in Russian with the title Hillelism, in which he argued that the Zionist project could not solve the problems of the Jewish people.
In 1914, he politely declined an invitation to join a new organization of Jewish Esperantists, the TEHA. In his letter to the organizers, he said: "I am profoundly convinced that every nationalism offers humanity only the greatest unhappiness... It is true that the nationalism of oppressed peoples – as a natural self-defensive reaction – is much more excusable than the nationalism of peoples who oppress; but, if the nationalism of the strong is ignoble, the nationalism of the weak is imprudent; both give birth to and support each other..." Among the many works of Zamenhof, translated into Esperanto is the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament.
Zamenhof died in Warsaw on 14 April 1917, and is buried in the Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery.

===Religious philosophy===

Besides his linguistic work, Zamenhof published a religious philosophy he called Homaranismo (loosely translated as humanitarianism), based on the principles and teachings of Hillel the Elder.

==Family==

Zamenhof and his wife Klara raised three children, a son, Adam, and two daughters, Sofia and Lidia. All three died in the Holocaust.[ref]

Adolf Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf that the spread of Esperanto throughout Europe was a Jewish plot to break down national differences so that Jews could assume positions of authority.... After the Nazis' successful Blitzkrieg of Poland, the Warsaw Gestapo received orders to 'take care' of the Zamenhof family.... Zamenhof's son was shot... his two daughters were put in Treblinka death camp."[/ref]
Lidia Zamenhof in particular took a keen interest in Esperanto, and as an adult became a teacher of the language, traveling through Europe and to America to teach classes in it. Through her friendship with Martha Root, Lidia accepted Bahá'u'lláh and became a member of the Bahá'í faith. As one of its social principles, the Bahá'í faith teaches that an auxiliary world language should be selected by the representatives of all the world's nations. Zamenhof's grandson, Louis-Christophe Zaleski-Zamenhof (Adam's son), has lived in France since the 1960s.

==Name discrepancy==

Zamenhof was born under the Russian rule and therefore his name was first recorded in the Russian as Лейзер Заменго́в Leyzer Zamengov.Birth Certificate N 47: "Leyzer Zamengov, son of Mordkha Fayvelovich Zamengov and Liba Sholemovna Sofer" "Zamenhof" is pronounced [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɑː|m|ɨ|n|h|ɒ|f|,_|-|n|ɒ|v|,_|-|n|ɒ|f[/tpl] in English, [tpl]IPA-eo|zaˈmenhof|[/tpl] in Esperanto.  In [tpl]lang-yi|אֱלִיעֶזֶר "לײזער" לֵוִי זאַמענהאָף[/tpl] (Eliezer "Leyzer" Levi Zamenhof), in [tpl]lang-de|Ludwig (aka Levi) Lazarus Samenhof[/tpl], in [tpl]lang-he|אליעזר לודוויג (לייזער) (לאזארו לודוביקו) זמנהוף[/tpl], in [tpl]lang-ru|Лю́двик Ла́зарь "Лейзер" Ма́ркович Заменго́в[/tpl] (Lyudvik Lazar' "Leizer" Markovich Zamengov).
Zamenhof's parents gave him the Hebrew name Eliezer, which appeared on his birth certificate in its Yiddish form Leyzer. In his adolescence he used both Leyzer and the Russian equivalent Lazar (the form Lazarus is often used in English texts). In some Russian documents Lazar was followed by the patronymic Markovich.
While at university, Zamenhof began using the Russian name Lyudovik (often transcribed Ludovic; in English the form Ludwig is also used) in place of Lazar. When his brother Leon became a doctor and started signing his name "Dr L. Zamenhof",[ref]
</ref> Ludwik reclaimed his birth name Lazar and from 1901 signed his name "Dr L. L. Zamenhof". The two L's do not seem to have specifically represented either name, and the order Ludwik Lazar is a modern convention.
Zamenhof may have chosen the name Ludwik in honor of Francis Lodwick (or Lodowyck), who in 1652 had published an early conlang proposal.[tpl]cite book |last=Umberto Eco & James Fentress | title=The Search for the Perfect Language | publisher=Blackwell Publishing | page=324 | date=9 September 1995 | isbn=0-631-17465-6 [/tpl]
His family name was originally written Samenhof, in German orthography; the spelling Zamenhof reflects the romanization of the Yiddish spelling [tpl]lang|yi|זאַמענהאָף[/tpl], as well as the Esperanto and Polish spellings.

==Honours and namesakes==

In 1910, Zamenhof was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, by four British Members of Parliament (including James O'Grady, Philip Snowden) and Professor Stanley Lane Poole.Nobel Prize nomnination database (The Prize was instead awarded to the International Peace Bureau.) On the occasion of the 5th Universala Kongreso de Esperanto in Barcelona, Zamenhof was made a Commander of the Order of Isabella the Catholic by King Alfonso XIII of Spain.Olaizola, Borja. "Chatear en Esperanto, vigésimo idioma del mundo más usado en la red." El Correo. 30/03/2011.
The minor planet 1462 Zamenhof is named in his honor. It was discovered on 6 February 1938, by Yrjö Väisälä. Also, hundreds of city streets, parks, and bridges worldwide have been named after Zamenhof.See the list of Zamenhof/Esperanto Objects on the Wikipedia in Esperanto In Lithuania, the best-known Zamenhof Street is in Kaunas, where he lived and owned a house for some time. There are others in England, France, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Spain (mostly in Catalonia), Italy, Israel, Belgium and Brazil. There are Zamenhof Hills in Hungary and Brazil, and a Zamenhof Island in the Danube River.Hommages au Dr Zamenhof, à l'espéranto et à ses pionniers.
In some Israeli cities, street signs identify Esperanto's creator and give his birth and death dates, but refer to him solely by his Jewish name Eliezer (a variant of which, El'azar, is the origin of Lazarus). Zamenhof is honored as a deity by the Japanese religion Oomoto, which encourages the use of Esperanto among its followers. Also, a genus of lichen has been named Zamenhofia rosei in his honour.Zamenhofia rosei: Francis' lichen. Range, habitat, biology.
His birthday, 15 December, is celebrated annually as Zamenhof Day by users of Esperanto. On 15 December 2009, Esperanto's green-starred flag flew on the Google search web page, in a commemorative Google Doodle to mark Zamenhof's 150th birthday.Google logos 4thQ'09 archive page.

The house of the Zamenhof family, dedicated to Ludwik Zamenhof and the Białystok Esperanto Centre, are sites of the Jewish Heritage Trail in Białystok, which was opened in June 2008 by volunteers at The University of Białystok Foundation.Jewish Heritage Trail in Białystok accessed 25 July 2009.
