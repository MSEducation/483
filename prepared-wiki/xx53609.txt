Many of her early novels are set in the Sime - Gen Universe, which she first described in a short story in 1969.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.simegen.com/sgfandom/rimonslibrary/oht.html|title = Operation High Time[/tpl]  In the early 70's, dedicated fans of this series created a fanzine, called "A Companion in Zeor,"[tpl]cite web|last=Klein|first=Laura |title=Dr. |url= http://fanzines.lmc.gatech.edu/collections/show/4|work=http://sf.lmc.gatech.edu/|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=22 November 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://fanzines.lmc.gatech.edu/exhibits/show/a-companion-in-zeor-2 |title= A Companion in Zeor, No. 2 |publisher= Georgia Institute of Technology[/tpl] first published in 1978 by Karen MacLeod. Writing the series satisfied her preference for "'Intimacy' – the kind of relationship between the character and other characters, between the character and the universe, or between the character and him/herself, that brings trust into life" over "Action," a genre she "seriously dislikes."[tpl]cite book |author= Lichtenberg, Jacqueline |title= Science Is Magic Spelled Backwards and Other Stories |publisher= Wildside Press |year= 2011 |pages= 19–20 |ISBN= 978-1-4344-1232-4[/tpl]  Her other writings have dealt with fantasy and occult subjects, including articles on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
