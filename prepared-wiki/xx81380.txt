==History==

The Scotsman was launched[tpl]cite web|url=http://archive.scotsman.com/edition.cfm?id=TSC/1817/01/25|title=The Scotsman Archive – 25 January 1817 (page 1 of 8) – The Scotsman launched|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=20 December 2009[/tpl] in 1817 as a liberal weekly newspaper by lawyer William Ritchie and customs official Charles Maclaren in response to the "unblushing subservience" of competing newspapers to the Edinburgh establishment.  The paper was pledged to "impartiality, firmness and independence". After the abolition of newspaper stamp tax in Scotland in 1850, The Scotsman was relaunched as a daily newspaper priced at 1d and a circulation of 6,000 copies.
In 1953 the newspaper was bought by Canadian millionaire Roy Thomson who was in the process of building a large media group.  The paper was bought in 1995 by David and Frederick Barclay for £85 million. They moved the newspaper from its Edinburgh office on North Bridge, which is now an upmarket hotel, to modern offices in Holyrood Road designed by Edinburgh architects CDA, near the subsequent location of the Scottish Parliament Building. The daily was awarded by the Society for News Design (SND) the World’s Best Designed Newspaper™ for 1994.[tpl]cite web|title=World’s Best-Designed winners (2006)|url=http://www.snd.org/competitions/print/worlds-best-designed/|work=Society for News Design|accessdate=6 October 2013[/tpl]
In December 2005, The Scotsman was acquired, in a £160 million deal, by its present owners Johnston Press a company founded in Scotland and now one of the top three largest local newspaper publishers in the UK. 
Ian Stewart has been the editor since June 2012, after a reshuffle of senior management in April 2012 during which John McLellan who was the paper's editor-in-chief was dismissed.  Ian Stewart was previously editor of Edinburgh Evening News and remains as the editor of Scotland on Sunday.
In 2012, The Scotsman was named Newspaper of the Year at the Scottish Press Awards.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/node/49153|title=John McLellan collects newspaper of the year award|work=Press Gazette|location=UK|date=20 April 2012|accessdate=12 December 2012 [/tpl]
