Cuan Mhuire is a charitable drug, alcohol and gambling rehabilitation organisation in Ireland. Cuan Mhuire offers a comprehensive, structured, abstinence based, residential programme to persons suffering from alcohol, other chemical dependencies and gambling. Cuan Mhuire was founded by Sr. Consilio Fitzgerald a member of the Sisters of Mercy in 1966. Cuan Mhuire has its own programme, developed by Sr. Consilio and her staff over a period of 40 years. Cuan Mhuire has rehabilitation centres and other facilities all over Ireland both north and south dealing with approximately 2500 people each year.

==History and development==

Cuan Mhuire was founded by Sr. Consilio in 1966. Sr. Consilio had qualified as a nurse and a midwife and had been stationed in St. Vincent's Hospital in Athy, County Kildare.
Sr. Consilio first real interaction with alcoholics was when she worked in St. Vincent's. She realised that her true calling was to help the people who were marginalised and considered 'untouchables' and to show them that a rebirth was possible.

===Dairy===

In 1965 Sr. Consilio convinced the nuns in Athy to convert the dairy of the convent into a 'drop in' centre, where she could greet her visitors and listen to their troubles. This dairy became the focal point of Sr. Consilio's work with the homeless and the addicts. By this time, a few tradesmen had begun to recover from their addiction and they set to work on the dairy. Thus a functioning unit began. As the building was being reconstructed, so too were peoples lives being reconstructed.
In the early days, the dairy became known as the 'dug out', so Sr. Consilio felt she must give it a proper name. Her friend, Dr. Des O'Neill who was a constant help in the
development of Cuan Mhuire, suggested the name "An Cuan" meaning "The Harbour". Sr Consilio felt that it would have to include Our Lady's name and said  none of this would have been possible without her– hence the name "Cuan Mhuire".

===First purpose-built rehabilitation center===

In November 1972, a farm of land came up for sale just outside Athy. Sr. Consilio, encouraged by the support of her Mother superior, paid a visit to the local bank manager. He asked Sr. Consilio how she would pay for it. She told him that "Our Lady would provide". Sr. Consilio attended the auction in full nun regalia and she came away from the auction with a forty two acre field and no way to pay for it.
The bank manager later discovered that Sr. Consilio had paid off the purchase price in full and he had not to worry about honouring the big check. When he asked Sr. Consilio how she managed to pay for the land, she simply replied: “Our Lady helped me”.The http://www.bookfinder.com/dir/i/Cuan_Mhuire_A_Haven_of_Hope_the_Life_and_Work_of_Sister_Consilio/0953826406/, 'Cuan Mhuire A Haven of Hope the Life and Work of Sister Consilio by Nora McNamara : HSI Publications'The http://www.veritas.ie/veritas/asp/product.asp?pr_code=0862172551, 'In God's Hands Story of Sr Mary Consilio and Cuan Mhuire by Costello, A Gemma : Veritas Publications'
