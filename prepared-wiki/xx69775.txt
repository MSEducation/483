==History==

Yongsan Garrison was originally created as an Imperial Japanese Army garrison in the early decades of the 20th century on land that had traditionally been the site of military facilities under former Korean kingdoms. The former site of the garrison was used by Qing troops during the Imo Incident in 1882. During those times, the Korean and Japanese garrisons were on the outskirts of the city in mostly undeveloped land. Since then, the city of Seoul has enveloped the Garrison. Several buildings built by the Japanese army and located within Yongsan Garrison are still utilized by U.S. forces, most notably the Eighth Army headquarters building. Many of older, dark-colored brick buildings on the base are former Japanese Army buildings.  Located directly across from Eighth Army headquarters is the Combined Forces Command and U.S. Forces Korea headquarters, a structure built in the early 1970s. The building is home to the Commanding General, United Nations Command, Combined Forces Command and U.S. Forces Korea.
The War Memorial of Korea directly abuts the garrison, before the construction of this museum, the land was part of the Korean military command and was only slightly separated from the U.S. Army facility, both having been part of the original Japanese Garrison.
According to Stars and Stripes,the South Korean government and U.S. military officials had agreed to relocate Yongsan Garrison [tpl]convert|55|mi|km[/tpl] south, to Camp Humphreys near the metropolitan city of Pyeongtaek beginning in either 2012 or 2013. Due to a number of factors, including a lack of enthusiasm for the move from the newly elected Lee Myung-Bak administration, this process has now been pushed back to 2019. South Korea had traditionally regarded this garrison as insurance against the U.S. Army abandoning Seoul, located only about 65 km from the DMZ. As part of this relocation and the planned withdrawal of U.S. troops near the DMZ, all American troops will be pulled back from north of the Han River.
The Embassy of the United States in Seoul may build a new Chancery on part of the land planned to be vacated by the U.S. Army, most probably on Camp Coiner. Most of the U.S. Embassy officials live in an Embassy housing compound located in an area almost completely enveloped by Yongsan Garrison, and with direct access to it.
As part of his final visit to Asia, U.S. President George W. Bush spoke to both U.S. and R.O.K. military personnel, their families, and civilian employees at Yongsan Garrison's Collier Field House, 6 August 2008. During his speech to the troops, Bush said,"Fifty-five years have passed since the guns went quiet and the cease-fire was signed on this peninsula, and since that time our forces have kept the peace. Our nations have built a robust alliance.” He also said that America would keep its military presence on the Korean peninsula, while returning some bases to South Korean control.
As part of her first official trip overseas as Secretary of State, Hillary Rodham Clinton visited senior U.S. and Korean military leaders at the Combined Forces Command headquarters at Yongsan Garrison on 20 February 2009.
Note: some 297,000 square meters (77 acres) of land, including a golf course, was given back to the City of Seoul in November 1992 to become Yongsan Family Park and the site of the recently opened National Museum of Korea. The opening of the completed National Museum was delayed several years while the fate of a U.S. Army helicopter landing facility (H-208) was decided (its approach path and landing pads were directly in front of the museum).
On 9 April 2003 South Korea and the United States agreed on the early relocation of Yongsan garrison outside of central Seoul.[tpl]cite news|title=Today in Korean history|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/yonhap-news-agency/140408/today-korean-history|accessdate=16 April 2014|newspaper=globalpost|date=8 April 2014[/tpl]
In 2009 The Korea Times reported that defense ministry officials said that South Korea and the United States have agreed to complete the relocation of the U.S. military headquarters in Yongsan to an expanded military base in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, by 2014.[tpl]cite news|last=Jung|first=Sung-ki|title=Yongsan Garrison to Be Relocated by 2014|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/01/116_37344.html|accessdate=29 December 2013|newspaper=The Korea Times|date=5 January 2009[/tpl]

===Army Family Covenant===

On 13 December 2007[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] Yongsan Garrison officials and the IMCOM-Korean commanding general pledged their support to develop and improve family programs during an Army Family Covenant signing ceremony.[tpl]dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] According to garrison officials, “The Army Family Covenant is our commitment to deliver a quality of life commensurate to our Soldiers’ service.” During the ceremony, the Yongsan Garrison commander cited recent improvements to family programs at the USAG-Yongsan, such as elimination of initial registration fees for child care, extended hours for respite care and extended-duty child care, and expanded programs for teens and after-school care, including youth sports. Since the Army announced the covenant, it also committed $1.4 billion to family programs in fiscal 2008.

When on-post housing is not available, unaccompanied military personnel are assigned to off-post quarters.

===Army Community of Excellence===

Cody recognized Yongsan Garrison as one of the top three U.S. Army Installations in the World and recognized the garrison by declaring it an Army Community of Excellence.[tpl]dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl] The ACOE competition recognizes excellence in installation management and encourages and rewards installations that optimize opportunities and demonstrate a commitment to service and excellence.
