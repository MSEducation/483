CATEGORIES: Board games introduced in 1977, Abstract strategy games

Entropy is a two-player abstract strategic game designed by Eric Solomon in 1977. The game is sold commercially under the names Hyle (for a simplified version played on a 5×5 board) and Hyle7.[tpl]bgg|1329|Hyle[/tpl]
The game is played on a square 7×7 grid of cells. One player ("Chaos") draws coloured chips at random from a bag and places each one on the board in an empty space. For each chip that is placed, the other player ("Order") may slide it horizontally or vertically through empty spaces, to rest in a previously empty space. When the grid is full, Order scores for any palindromic patterns of chip colors (e.g. "red–green–blue–green–red") that have been formed horizontally or vertically.Article about Entropy, http://www.boardability.com/game.php?id=entropy, Retrieved on 6 September 2010.
