Belarus has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1994.

==Submissions==

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award. Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by Belarus for review by the Academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.
Independent Belarus has only submitted films to the Oscar Foreign Language Film competition twice- in 1994 and 1996. Both films were Jewish-themed films focusing on relations between Polish Jews & Christians, and were set during the time before and after World War II. "Me Ivan, You Abraham" was about inter-faith friendship among two boys in the 1930s. "From Hell to Hell" focuses on two families- one Jewish, one Christian- and the tragedy that ensues when one family entrusts their child to the other during the Second World War. Neither film succeeded in being nominated, although "Hell" was rumored to have come close. Also, neither film was a majority Belarussian production and ironically, neither film was directed by a Belarussian; Zauberman is French and Astrakhan is Russian.
The Soviet Union also sent a Belarussian film, Come and See, in 1985 to represent the USSR.
