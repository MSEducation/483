The Mudi is a rare herding dog breed from Hungary. It is closely related to the Puli and Pumi, from which it was separated in the 1930s. Today, the Mudi is bred for work, companionship, and show.  They continue to be used in herding, as well as participating in a variety of dog sports.

===Temperament===

The Mudi is a versatile farm dog that can hunt, exterminate rodents, and act as a capable herding dog and flock guardian. Although the breed is much less popular than the better-known Puli and Komondor in its native country, owners of the Mudi claim that it is incomparable for its versatile talents and pleasant disposition.

===Exercise and activities===

The Mudi is a very active breed. They need to be taken on a daily, long, brisk walk or jog. In addition, they will benefit from a large safe area where they can run free. They need a lot of running and other exercises to be in good condition. They love to play and will excel in all kinds of dog sports such as Frisbee. The Mudi can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, Rally obedience, Schutzhund, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Mudi that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.[tpl]cite book|first1 = Jeanne Joy | last1 = Hartnagle-Taylor | first2 = Ty | last2 = Taylor |year = 2010|title=Stockdog Savvy|publisher=Alpine Publications|isbn=978-157779-106-5|pages=|chapter=[/tpl]

===Health problems===

This is a fairly healthy breed, although some cases of hip dysplasia have occurred, but not many.

===Living conditions===

The Mudi can live in an apartment if it is sufficiently exercised; however, they need space to run and play and would do better if not kept in one. They are moderately active indoors and will do best with at least a large yard. This breed can live outdoors.

===Life expectancy===

About 13–14 years.

===Grooming===

The Mudi is easy to groom. An occasional combing and brushing to remove dead hair is all it needs. This breed is an average shedder.
