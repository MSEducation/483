Willard L. Miranker (March 8, 1932 – April 28, 2011) was an American mathematician and computer scientist, known for his contributions to
applied mathematics and numerical mathematics.
Raised in Brooklyn, New York, he earned B.A. (1952), M.S. (1953) and Ph.D. (1956) from the Courant Institute at New York University,
the latter on the thesis The Asymptotic Theory of Solutions of U + (K2)U = 0 advised by Joseph Keller.
He then worked for the mathematics department at Bell Labs (1956–58) before joining
IBM Research (1961). After retirement from IBM, he joined the computer science faculty at Yale University (1989) as research faculty.
He also held professor affiliations at California Institute of Technology (1963),
Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1968), Yale University (1973),  University of Paris-Sud (1974), City University of New York (1966–) and New York University (1970–73).
