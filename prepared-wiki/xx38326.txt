[[President of the Irish Republic]]

CATEGORIES: Heads of Irish provisional governments

President of the Republic was the title given to the head of the Irish ministry or Aireacht in August 1921 by an amendment to the Dáil Constitution, which replaced the previous title, Príomh Aire or President of Dáil Éireann. Unlike the previous offices, which were simply head of government or prime minister, the President of the Republic was explicitly declared to be the Irish Republic's head of state.
