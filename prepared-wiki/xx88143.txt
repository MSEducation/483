CATEGORIES: Brassica rapa, Brassica, Leaf vegetables

Rapini (commonly marketed in English as broccoli raab or rabe [tpl]IPAc-en|r|ɑː|b[/tpl])  is a green cruciferous vegetable.  The edible parts are the leaves, buds, and stems.  The buds somewhat resemble broccoli, but do not form a large head. It is known for its slightly bitter taste, and is particularly associated with Italian, Galician, and Portuguese cuisines. Within Italian cuisine, the plant is heavily associated with Southern Italian cuisine (especially Neapolitan cuisine and the cuisines of Campania and Puglia) and Roman cuisine. 
In Italy, it is called cime di rapa (literally meaning "turnip tops"), rapi, or rapini; in Naples it is known as friarielli and sometimes broccoli di rapa; in Rome broccoletti; and in Portugal and Spain grelos.

The cultivated vegetable probably descends from a wild herb related to the turnip that grew either in China or the Mediterranean region. Rapini is similar in shape to the Chinese Brassica oleracea cultivar called kai-lan. Rapini is now grown throughout the world. Rapini is available all year long, but its peak season in the Northern Hemisphere is fall to spring.

==Culinary arts==

In Europe, it is used mostly in southern Italian cuisine (in particular Basilicata, Puglia, Campania and Sicily) and Roman cuisine. It is also popular in Portuguese cuisine and in the cuisine of Galicia.
In Umbria and other Central Italy regions, rapini sautéed with garlic, chili pepper and guanciale can be a side dish for porchetta, grilled pork ribs and sausages and other pork dishes.
