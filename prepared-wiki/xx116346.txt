[[List of Mushishi episodes]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of anime episodes

This is a list of episodes for the Mushishi anime series. It premiered on October 22, 2005 in Japan, but after 20 episodes, the series went on hiatus, and resumed screening the six remaining ones on May 14, 2006. Each episode tells a self-contained story and is not dependent on prior episodes for background. This made it possible for the producers of the anime to change the relative order of the stories. However, aside from a slight abridgment of the dialogue, this is the only major difference between the manga and the anime.
A special OVA series was released in January 4, 2014 and a second series started airing on April 4, 2014.
