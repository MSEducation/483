The East Ventura Metrolink Station is a Metrolink rail station in the city of Ventura, California. The station is served by Metrolink's Ventura County Line from Los Angeles Union Station to the eastern Ventura neighborhood of Montalvo. Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner does not pass through this station as it lies just off the main coast route within the wye or triangular junction for the Santa Paula Branch line which is owned by the Ventura County Transportation Commission.Kelly, Peggy (October 15, 1999) "Funding for Montalvo Metrolink station would benefit SP Branch Line" Santa Paula Times
Six Metrolink trains serve the station each weekday. This limited Metrolink service runs only at peak hours in the peak direction of travel (i.e. three morning departures to Los Angeles and three afternoon arrivals from Los Angeles). This station was added as an extension to the Metrolink system in Fall 2002. Prior to that, Metrolink trains that ran from Los Angeles to Oxnard laid over overnight at this site but passengers could not board.
Growth in commuters traveling towards Los Angeles is expected to favor this location over the downtown Ventura train station. Overnight storage of trains in the downtown might have also been expensive if that station was used.[ref]BLAKE, CATHERINE
