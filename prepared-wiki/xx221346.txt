==History==

The Township of Lytton was formed in 1869, named after Lord Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1803-1873). The township municipality was set up in 1909. with M.W.P. O'Connor as first mayor. In 1916, telephone service is established in Lytton, but not until 1952 did electricity arrive.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.montcerf-lytton.com/pages_municipal/Histoire/historique.html |title=Historique Montcerf-Lytton |accessdate=2008-08-21 |publisher=Municipalité de Montcerf-Lytton |language=French[/tpl]
Montcerf was opened for colonization in 1870. Formerly spelled "Moncerf" or "Mont Cerf", it became Montcerf (French for "Mount Deer") during the nineteenth century and the name presumably refers to a mountain which rises near the village and once teemed with deer and moose. The mission of Sainte-Philomène-de-Montcerf was established in 1872 and the Montcerf Post Office opened in 1886. The Municipality of Montcerf was officially set up in 1920 with Abraham Mathieu as first mayor. In 1929, electricity arrived in Montcerf, followed by telephone service in 1948.
On September 19, 2001, the Municipality of Montcerf and the Lytton Township Municipality were merged into the new Municipality of Montcerf-Lytton with Fernand Lirette (mayor of Montcerf since 1974) as first mayor.
