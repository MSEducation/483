==Plot==

The Two Curious Puppies, one big and one little, are being pursued by a dog catcher until they hide in an abandoned house. They soon discover the house is owned by Sham-Fu, a magician unseen over the course of the short. As a result, each dog (separated from each other shortly after entering the house) encounters all manner of magic tricks, including his pet rabbit (the Bugs Bunny prototype, who still resembles the all-white version seen in Porky's Hare Hunt and has no spoken lines other than a few bouts of maniacal laughter). The big dog is left to defend himself against the rabbit, itself a more than competent illusionist capable of all sorts of acts of cartoon physics, while the little one does battle with a Hindu rope and a magic wand, the latter of which he ends up accidentally swallowing, giving him bizarre hiccups through the rest of the movie.
The rabbit, big dog and little dog all end up crashing into each other, at which point both immediately attempt to pack everything back into Sham-Fu's trunk. Inexplicably, the little dog hiccups out a balloon containing the mischievous rabbit. However, this time, when the rabbit attempts another disappearing act, the big dog stops it in his tracks and punches it as hard as possible. The scene irises out on the rabbit, its eye blackened and covered with a lampshade.
