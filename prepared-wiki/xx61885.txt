===X-ray spectroscopy===

==Stars and their properties==

===Chemical properties===

Newton used a prism to split white light into a spectrum of color, and Fraunhofer's high-quality prisms allowed scientists to see dark lines of an unknown origin. It was not until the 1850s that Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen would describe the phenomena behind these dark lines; hot solid objects produce light with a continuous spectrum, hot gasses emit light at specific wavelengths, and hot solid objects surrounded by cooler gasses will show a near-continuous spectrum with dark lines corresponding to the emission lines of the gasses.[tpl]rp|42–44[/tpl] By comparing the absorption lines of the sun with emission spectra of known gasses, the chemical composition of stars can be determined.
The major Fraunhofer lines, and the elements they are associated with, are shown in the following table:

Not all of the elements in the sun were immediately identified.  Two examples are listed below.
To date more than 20 000 absorption lines have been listed for the Sun between 293.5 and 877.0 nm, yet only approximately 75% of these lines have been linked to elemental absorption.[tpl]rp|69[/tpl]
By analyzing the width of each spectral line in an emission spectrum, both the elements present in a star and their relative abundances can be determined.  Using this information stars can be categorized into stellar populations; Population I stars are the youngest stars and have the highest metal content (our Sun is a Pop I star), while Population III stars are the oldest stars with a very low metal content.[tpl]cite book|last=Gregory|first=Stephen A.; Michael Zeilik|title=Introductory astronomy & astrophysics|year=1998|publisher=Saunders College Publ.|location=Fort Worth u.a.|isbn=0-03-006228-4|page=322|edition=4.[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Pan|first=Liubin|author2=Scannapieco, Evan|author3= Scalo, Jon|title=MODELING THE POLLUTION OF PRISTINE GAS IN THE EARLY UNIVERSE|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=1 October 2013|volume=775|issue=2|page=111|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/775/2/111[/tpl]

===Temperature and size===

In 1860 Gustav Kirchhoff proposed the idea of a black body, a material that emits electromagnetic radiation at all wavelengths.  In 1894 Wilhelm Wien derived an expression relating the temperature (T) of a black body to its peak emission wavelength (λmax).
b is a constant of proportionality called Wien's displacement constant, equal to [tpl]physconst|bwien|round=auto|after=.[/tpl]  This equation is called Wien's Law. By measuring the peak wavelength of a star, the surface temperature can be determined.  For example, if the peak wavelength of a star is 502 nm the corresponding temperature will be 5778 Kelvin.
The luminosity of a star is a measure of the electromagnetic energy output in a given amount of time.  Luminosity (L) can be related to the temperature (T) of a star by
where R is the radius of the star and σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, with a value of [tpl]physconst|sigma|round=auto|after=.[/tpl]  Thus, when both luminosity and temperature are known (via direct measurement and calculation) the radius of a star can be determined.

==Galaxies==

The spectra of galaxies look similar to stellar spectra, as they consist of the combined light of millions of stars.
Doppler shift studies of galaxy clusters by Fritz Zwicky in 1937 found that most galaxies were moving much faster than seemed to be possible from what was known about the mass of the cluster. Zwicky hypothesized that there must be a great deal of non-luminous matter in the galaxy clusters, which became known as dark matter. Since his discovery, astronomers have determined that a large portion of galaxies (and most of the universe) is made up of dark matter. In 2003, however, four galaxies (NGC 821, NGC 3379, NGC 4494, and NGC 4697) were found to have little to no dark matter influencing the motion of the stars contained within them; the reason behind the lack of dark matter is unknown.
In the 1950s, strong radio sources were found to be associated with very dim, very red objects.  When the first spectrum of one of these objects was taken there were absorption lines at wavelengths where none were expected.  It was soon realised that what was observed was a normal galactic spectrum, but highly red shifted.  These were named quasi-stellar radio sources, or quasars, by  Hong-Yee Chiu in 1964.  Quasars are now thought to be galaxies formed in the early years of our universe, with their extreme energy output powered by super-massive black holes.
The properties of a galaxy can also be determined by analyzing the stars found within them.  NGC 4550, a galaxy in the Virgo Cluster, has a large portion of its stars rotating in the opposite direction as the other portion. It is believed that the galaxy is the combination of two smaller galaxies that were rotating in opposite directions to each other. Bright stars in galaxies can also help determine the distance to a galaxy, which may be a more accurate method than parallax or standard candles.

==Interstellar medium==

The interstellar medium is matter that occupies the space between star systems in a galaxy. 99% of this matter is gaseous - hydrogen, helium, and smaller quantities of other ionized elements such as oxygen. The other 1% is dust particles, thought to be mainly graphite, silicates, and ices. Clouds of the dust and gas are referred to as nebulae.
There are three main types of nebula: absorption, reflection, and emission nebulae. Absorption (or dark) nebulae are made of dust and gas in such quantities that they obscure the starlight behind them, making photometry difficult.  Reflection nebulae, as their name suggest, reflect the light of nearby stars. Their spectra are the same as the stars surrounding them, though the light is bluer; shorter wavelengths scatter better than longer wavelengths. Emission nebulae emit light at specific wavelengths depending on their chemical composition.

===Gaseous emission nebulae===

In the early years of astronomical spectroscopy, scientists were puzzled by the spectrum of gaseous nebulae. In 1864 William Huggins noticed that many nebulae showed only emission lines rather than a full spectrum like stars. From the work of Kirchhoff, he concluded that nebulae must contain "enormous masses of luminous gas or vapour." However, there were several emission lines that could not be linked to any terrestrial element, brightest among them lines at 495.9 nm and 500.7 nm. These lines were attributed to a new element, nebulium, until Ira Bowen determined in 1927 that the emission lines were from highly ionised oxygen (O+2). These emission lines could not be replicated in a laboratory because they are forbidden lines; the low density of a nebula (one atom per cubic centimetre) allows for metastable ions to decay via forbidden line emission rather than collisions with other atoms.
Not all emission nebulae are found around or near stars where solar heating causes ionisation. The majority of gaseous emission nebulae are formed of neutral hydrogen. In the ground state neutral hydrogen has two possible spin states: the electron has either the same spin or the opposite spin of the proton. When the atom transitions between these two states, it releases an emission or absorption line of 21 cm. This line is within the radio range and allows for very precise measurements:
Using this information the shape of the Milky Way has been determined to be a spiral galaxy, though the exact number and position of the spiral arms is the subject of ongoing research.

===Complex molecules===

Dust and molecules in the interstellar medium not only obscures photometry, but also causes absorption lines in spectroscopy. Their spectral features are generated by transitions of component electrons between different energy levels, or by rotational or vibrational spectra. Detection usually occurs in radio, microwave, or infrared portions of the spectrum. The chemical reactions that form these molecules can happen in cold, diffuse clouds or in the hot ejecta around a white dwarf star from a nova or supernova. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as acetylene (C2H2) generally group together to form graphites or other sooty material, but other organic molecules such as acetone ((CH3)2CO) and buckminsterfullerenes (C60 and C70) have been discovered.

==Motion in the universe==

Stars and interstellar gas are bound by gravity to form galaxies, and groups of galaxies can be bound by gravity in galaxy clusters. With the exception of stars in the Milky Way and the galaxies in the Local Group, almost all galaxies are moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe.

===Doppler effect and redshift===

The motion of stellar objects can be determined by looking at their spectrum. Because of the Doppler effect, objects moving towards us are blueshifted, and objects moving away are redshifted. The wavelength of redshifted light is longer, appearing redder than the source.  Conversely, the wavelength of blueshifted light is shorter, appearing bluer than the source light:
Redshift (z) can be expressed by the following equations:
The Doppler effect and Hubble's law can be combined to form the equation
where c is the speed of light.

===Peculiar motion===

Objects that are gravitationally bound will rotate around a common center of mass. For stellar bodies, this motion is known as peculiar velocity, and can alter the Hubble Flow.  Thus, an extra term for the peculiar motion needs to be added to Hubble's law:
This motion can cause confusion when looking at a solar or galactic spectrum, because the expected redshift based on the simple Hubble law will be obscured by the peculiar motion.  For example, the shape and size of the Virgo Cluster has been a matter of great scientific scrutiny due to the very large peculiar velocities of the galaxies in the cluster.

===Binary stars===

Just as planets can be gravitationally bound to stars, pairs of stars can orbit each other. Some binary stars are visual binaries, meaning they can be observed orbiting each other through a telescope.  Some binary stars, however, are too close together to be resolved. These two stars, when viewed through a spectrometer, will show a composite spectrum: the spectrum of each star will be added together. This composite spectrum becomes easier to detect when the stars are of similar luminosity and of different spectral class.
Spectroscopic binaries can be also detected due to their radial velocity; as they orbit around each other one star may be moving towards the Earth whilst the other moves away, causing a Doppler shift in the composite spectrum. The orbital plane of the system determines the magnitude of the observed shift: if the observer is looking perpendicular to the orbital plane there will be no observed radial velocity.  For example, if you look at a carousel from the side, you will see the animals moving toward and away from you, whereas if you look from directly above they will only be moving in the horizontal plane.

==Planets, asteroids, and comets==

Planets and asteroids shine only by the reflected light of their parent star, while comets both absorb and emit light at various wavelengths.

===Planets===

The reflected light of a planet contains absorption bands due to minerals in the rocks present for rocky bodies, or due to the elements and molecules present in the atmospheres of gas giants. To date almost 1000 exoplanets have been discovered.  These include so-called Hot Jupiters, as well as Earth-like planets. Using spectroscopy, compounds such as alkali metals, water vapor, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane have all been discovered.

===Asteroids===

Asteroids can be classified into three major types according to their spectra.  The original categories were created by Clark R. Chapman, David Morrison, and Ben Zellner in 1975, and further expanded by David J. Tholen in 1984. In what is now known as the Tholen classification, the C-types are made of carbonaceous material, S-types consist mainly of silicates, and X-types are 'metallic'.  There are other classifications for unusual asteroids.  C- and S-type asteroids are the most common asteroids. In 2002 the Tholen classification was further "evolved" into the SMASS classification, expanding the number of categories from 14 to 26 to account for more precise spectroscopic analysis of the asteroids.

===Comets===

The spectra of comets consist of a reflected solar spectrum from the dusty clouds surrounding the comet, as well as emission lines from gaseous atoms and molecules excited to fluorescence by sunlight and/or chemical reactions. For example, the chemical composition of Comet ISON was determined by spectroscopy due to the prominent emission lines of cyanogen (CN), as well as two- and three-carbon atoms (C2 and C3). Nearby comets can even be seen in X-ray as solar wind ions flying to the coma are neutralized. The cometary X-ray spectra therefore reflect the state of the solar wind rather than that of the comet.
