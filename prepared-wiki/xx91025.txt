[[Gaugino]]

CATEGORIES: Supersymmetry, Theoretical physics, Hypothetical elementary particles

In particle physics, a gaugino is the hypothetical superpartner of a gauge field, as predicted by gauge theory combined with supersymmetry. They are fermions.
In the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model the following gauginos exist:
Gauginos mix with higgsinos, the superpartners of the Higgs field's degrees of freedom, to form linear combinations ("mass eigenstates") called neutralinos (electrically neutral) and charginos (electrically charged). In many models the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), often a neutralino such as the photino, is stable. In that case it is a WIMP and a candidate for dark matter.
