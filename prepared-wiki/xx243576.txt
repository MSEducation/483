Kate Elizabeth "Katie" Piper (born 12 October 1983) is an English philanthropist, television presenter and former model from Andover, Hampshire. Piper had hoped to have a full-time career in the media, but in March 2008 sulphuric acid was thrown in her face. The attack, which blinded Piper in one eye, was arranged by Piper's ex-boyfriend and carried out by an accomplice; both men were arrested and are serving life sentences in prison for their crimes.
The attack took place in North London and Piper was treated in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where the surgeons removed all the skin from her face before rebuilding it with a skin substitute and then a skin graft. The procedure was the first of its kind to be completed in a single operation. Katie also underwent Ex-vivo limbal stem cell allograft transplantation (EVSCALT) at the Centre for Sight to restore her vision.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-16918223|title=Acid attack model Katie Piper gets sight back|date=7 February 2012|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 February 20012[/tpl]
In 2009, Piper chose to give up her anonymity in order to increase awareness about burn victims. The Channel 4 documentary Katie: My Beautiful Face was first aired on 29 October 2009 as part of the Cutting Edge series; it has subsequently been repeated on several occasions, made available for online on-demand access and sold internationally.
More recently, Piper has appeared in follow-up series for Channel 4, released a best-selling autobiography, and had a regular column in weekly magazines; however, she primarily works for her charitable organisation the Katie Piper Foundation.
In October 2013 she announced that she was pregnant. Piper gave birth to her first child, Belle Elizabeth, in March, 2014.

==Early life and education==

Kate Elizabeth Piper was born in Andover, Hampshire, and attended Harrow Way School and Portway Junior School as a child.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2688295/Acid-attack-victim-Katie-Piper-steps-out-in-public-for-first-time-since.html|title=New face of brave Katie|date=19 October 2009|publisher=The Sun|accessdate=20 October 2009|location=London|first=Neil|last=Syson[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.andoversound.com/pages/extranet/support-for-katie-i-3421.php|title=Support For Katie|date=20 October 2009|publisher=Andover Sound|accessdate=11 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/news/4697466.Katie_relives_acid_attack_horror/|title=Katie relives acid attack horror|date=23 October 2009|publisher=Andover Advertiser|accessdate=30 October 2009[/tpl]
After leaving school, Piper trained as a beautician, aiming to build on her fondness for fashion and beauty, and to follow in the footsteps of her father, who worked as a barber."Relative Values", Times Online, 28 February 2010[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl]

==Career prior to attack==

Piper subsequently began a career in modelling; she took part in various fashion, glamour and promotional photoshoots during her career, including modelling for national newspapers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast/8314689.stm|title=My Beautiful Face|date=19 October 2009|publisher=BBC |accessdate=20 October 2009[/tpl]
Piper also entered competitive beauty pageants and contests; she was the 2nd runner-up in the Miss Winchester 2006 beauty pageant,[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] and took part in Maxim magazine's Little Black Book contest in 2006.
Piper also began work as a promotional model – appearing and carrying out publicity duties at live events, such as working as a ring-card girl at martial arts fixtures.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.katiepiper.co.uk/showthread.php?tid=29 |title=Images of Katie Piper working as a 'ring girl' |publisher=Katiepiper.co.uk |accessdate=27 August 2011[/tpl] It was through her work as a ring-girl that Piper became known within the MMA (mixed martial arts) community.
Piper also conducted a career as a digital television presenter, working principally on web-TV shows and features,[tpl]cite web|url=http://current.com/groups/on-current-tv/77912371_super-smoke-me.htm |title='Super Smoke Me', a 2007 film for Current TV featuring Piper |publisher=Current.com |date=1 July 2007 |accessdate=27 August 2011[/tpl] and on small digital television channels, primarily in the shopping and live-chat fields. As her career began to develop, Piper moved away from her family home in Hampshire, and began to live with friends in a flat in the Golders Green area of North London.

==Assault and acid attack==

Daniel Lynch, a martial arts enthusiast who had been tracking Piper's media and modelling career, met her through the online social site Facebook.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Model-Katie-Piper-Reveals-Her-Plight-At-Acid-Attack-Injuries-To-Her-Face/Article/200910315408548?lpos=UK_News_Carousel_Region_3&lid=ARTICLE_15408548_Model_Katie_Piper_Reveals_Her_Plight_At_Acid_Attack_Injuries_To_Her_Face|title=Model's Struggle After Brutal Acid Attack |date=20 October 2009|publisher=Sky News|accessdate=20 October 2009[/tpl] Unknown to her, Lynch had previously been jailed for throwing boiling water into a man's face.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1221077/Katie-Piper-Acid-attack-victim-bravely-shows-face-disfigured-boyfriend-Daniel-Lynch.html|title=I was savagely disfigured by my deranged boyfriend: Acid attack victim bravely shows her face|date=19 October 2009|work=Daily Mail |location=London |accessdate=20 October 2009  | first=Nicky | last=Murfitt[/tpl] The two first met in person in Reading, Berkshire, where Piper had been working, and initially Piper was pleased with the relationship.
Two weeks into their relationship, the couple booked into a hotel in Bayswater, following a meal out. In the hotel room, Lynch raped and beat Piper, threatened to cut her with a razor and hang her, and stabbed her several times in the arms. After eight hours at the hotel, they drove back to Piper's Golders Green flat. Piper was treated for her wounds at Royal Free Hospital, but withheld the nature of the incident from the doctors and police, because she was afraid of Lynch.
Piper received numerous phone calls and apologies from Lynch. On 31 March 2008, two days after the initial attack, Lynch persuaded Piper to go to an internet cafe to read an email he had sent to her Facebook account. Lynch gave her details to Stefan Sylvestre, who identified her on Golders Green Road. Wearing a hoodie to obscure his identity, Sylvestre approached Piper, who thought he was going to ask for money, and then threw sulphuric acid at her face.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/6384367/Acid-attack-model-talks-about-recovery.html|title=Acid attack model talks about recovery|date=20 October 2009|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=20 October 2009 | location=London | first=Myles | last=Burke[/tpl]
The attack was caught on CCTV, and both Lynch and Sylvestre were later arrested.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/10/19/acid-attack-model-katie-piper-reveals-she-wanted-to-die-after-burns-wrecked-her-face-115875-21757661/|title=Acid attack model Katie Piper reveals she wanted to die after burns wrecked her face|date=19 October 2009|publisher=Mirror News|accessdate=20 October 2009[/tpl]
Lynch received two life sentences, and will serve a minimum of 16 years. Sylvestre received a life sentence, and will serve a minimum of 12 years. As a pre-trial inmate Lynch was held in Pentonville Prison."Prison officer had affair with cage fighter locked up for acid attack on aspiring TV presenter." Daily Mail. 28 January 2010. Retrieved 3 July 2010.

==Treatment and recovery==

Immediately after the attack, Piper ran into a local café, where an ambulance was called. Crews had to wait an hour before being able to treat Piper, because of the risk presented by the acid, which was still unidentified at that point, and because Sylvestre could still have been nearby. Piper was treated in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where her treatment was led by Dr. Mohammad Ali Jawad. The acid, some of which Piper had swallowed, blinded her in her left eye, and caused partial thickness and full thickness burns. The surgeons completely removed the skin of Piper's face, and replaced it with a skin substitute, Matriderm, to build the foundations for a skin graft. This procedure was the first of its kind to be done in a single operation.
Piper was put into an induced coma for 12 days, during which her weight dropped to [tpl]nowrap|38 kg[/tpl] (84 lbs). She has been through a total of 40 surgical operations to treat her injuries, and wore a plastic face mask for 23 hours a day, which flattened the scars and helped retain moisture. As part of her care from the National Health Service, Piper was treated at a clinic in Southern France. The treatment she received there was designed to break down scar tissue, and prevent skin contraction.
Subsequent to the attack, Piper moved out of her London flat and returned to Hampshire to live with her parents and younger sister Susy.[tpl]cite episode |title= Katie: My Beautiful Face|episodelink= |url= |credits= |network= Channel 4|station= |city= |airdate= 29 October 2009|began= |ended= |minutes= [/tpl] Her mother, Diane Piper, who was a classroom assistant in a primary school, gave up her job so she could look after her daughter following the attack. Following her recovery and the successful establishment of the Katie Piper Foundation, Piper again moved out of the family home and returned to living alone in London, a process documented in episodes of Katie: My Beautiful Friends; she later moved from the property seen here to live with her partner James, a carpenter and eventual father of Belle. Although no longer resident there, Piper continues to maintain strong links with Andover and Hampshire, where her family remain.
In October 2013 she announced that she was pregnant.Piper opens up about pregnancy: It’ll be the first time I’ll go to hospital for something nice Piper gave birth to her first child, Belle Elizabeth, in March, 2014.http://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/mother-and-baby/2014031417518/katie-piper-gives-birth/

===Katie: My Beautiful Face===

Although Piper had the right to remain anonymous because of the sexual assault, she chose to waive her anonymity, in an attempt to increase public awareness of the situation for burn victims, and also the treatment they go through.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/katie-my-beautiful-face/articles/interview|title=Katie: My Beautiful Face Interview|date=20 October 2009|publisher=Channel 4|accessdate=30 October 2009[/tpl] Piper also took part in a documentary about her experience, Katie: My Beautiful Face, which was aired by Channel 4 on 29 October 2009, and, according to figures from Attentional, gained over 3.3 million viewers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/ratings/katies-face-brings-33m-to-c4/5007516.article|title=Katie's face brings 3.3m to C4|date=30 October 2009|publisher=Broadcast Now|accessdate=30 October 2009[/tpl] The programme was repeated three times during 2009: once on Christmas Day, 2009 on Channel 4 (to tie in with Piper giving the Alternative Christmas Message) and twice on More4 (in early November and late December, each a few days after a C4 screening).
