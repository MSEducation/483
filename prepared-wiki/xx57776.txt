True is the third studio album by British band Spandau Ballet. It was released in March 1983 on Chrysalis Records. While Spandau Ballet's first two albums earned them European popularity, True made them worldwide stars and was heavily influenced by jazz, soul and R&B. It reached number 1 on the UK charts, the Top 20 in the United States,[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] and charted in numerous countries around the world. The title track spent four weeks at number 1 on the UK singles charts and went to number 4 in the United States. 
Other singles from the album included "Gold" (a no. 2 UK hit and a Top 30 hit in the U.S.), "Lifeline", "Communication" and "Pleasure". Later album releases by the band never equalled the success of True.
"True" was remastered on CD and stereo SACD in 2003 for its 20th anniversary. In June 2010, a special edition was released on 2 CDs and DVD as part of the 2010 Spandau Ballet reissues series, featuring remastered 12" remixes and B-sides, plus a live concert.
In 2008, the album was given away free with copies of the Daily Mail newspaper.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/release/1453103 |title=Spandau Ballet â€“ True |publisher=discogs.com |accessdate=18 September 2011 |quote=This CD was given away free with the Saturday edition of British national newspaper, The Daily Mail. |postscript= [/tpl]
