Scraggane ([tpl]Irish place name|An Scrag√°n[/tpl]) is a fishing port located on the Maharees peninsula near Castlegregory in County Kerry, Ireland.  
The main local catch consists of lobster, flat-back crab, spider crab, Atlantic crayfish, Atlantic salmon and mackerel. Scraggane is home to a fleet of about twenty fishing trawlers.
Scraggane Bay is used extensively as a flatwater windsurfing venue owing to its consistent wind and its protection from the Atlantic waves. "Scraggies", as the locality is often called, is sailable in almost any conditions, regardless of wind direction. Local windsurf pro Jamie Knox has a base on the bay providing teaching facilities to intermediates.
