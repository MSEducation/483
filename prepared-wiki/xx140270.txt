HMS ''Suffolk was one of 10 Monmouth''-class armoured cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. Upon completion she was assigned to the 3rd Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet and was then assigned to the 3rd Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean in 1909 after a lengthy refit. She returned home for another refit in 1912 and became the flagship of the 4th Cruiser Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station in 1913.
After the beginning of World War I in August 1914, Suffolk became a private ship and searched for German commerce raiders while protecting British shipping. She captured a German merchantman shortly after the war began. She remained in the Atlantic until she became flagship of the China Station in 1917  In late 1918 the ship was deployed to Vladivostok to support the Siberian Intervention during the Russian Civil War. She returned home in 1919 and became a briefly became a training ship before she was sold for scrap in 1920.

==Design and description==

Suffolk was designed to displace [tpl]convert|9800|LT|t[/tpl]. The ship had an overall length of [tpl]convert|463|ft|6|in|m|1[/tpl], a beam of [tpl]convert|66|ft|m|1[/tpl] and a deep draught of [tpl]convert|25|ft|m|1[/tpl]. She was powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of [tpl]convert|22000|ihp|lk=in[/tpl] and gave a maximum speed of [tpl]convert|23|kn|lk=in[/tpl]. Suffolk, however, was one of two Monmouths that exceeded her designed speed; during her sea trials she reached [tpl]convert|24.7|kn[/tpl]. The engines were powered by 31 Niclausse boilers. Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 70 She carried a maximum of [tpl]convert|1600|LT|t[/tpl] of coal and her complement consisted of 678 officers and enlisted men.Friedman 2012, p. 336
Her main armament consisted of fourteen breech-loading (BL) 6-inch Mk VII guns.Friedman 2011, p. 81 Four of these guns were mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure and the others positioned in casemates amidships. Six of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather.Friedman 2012, pp. 251–52, 260–61 They had a maximum range of approximately [tpl]convert|12200|yd[/tpl] with their [tpl]convert|100|lb|adj=on[/tpl] shells.Friedman 2011, pp. 80–81 Ten quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12 cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. Suffolk also carried three 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes.
Beginning in 1915, the main deck six-inch guns of the Monmouth-class ships were moved to the upper deck and given gun shields. Their casemates were plated over to improve seakeeping. The twelve-pounder guns displaced by the transfer were repositioned elsewhere. At some point in the war, 2 three-pounder anti-aircraft guns were installed on the upper deck.Friedman 2012, pp. 280, 286 
The ship's waterline armour belt had a maximum thickness of [tpl]convert|4|in|0|spell=in[/tpl] and was closed off by [tpl]convert|5|in|adj=on|0|spell=in[/tpl] transverse bulkheads. The armour of the gun turrets and their barbettes was four inches thick while the casemate armour was five inches thick. The protective deck armour ranged in thickness from [tpl]convert|.75|-|2|in|mm|0[/tpl] and the conning tower was protected by [tpl]convert|10|in|0|spell=in[/tpl] of armour.

==Construction and service==

Suffolk, named to commemorate the English county,Silverstone, p. 268 was laid down at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard on 25 March 1901 and launched on 15 January 1903. She was completed on 21 May 1904 and was assigned to the 3rd Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet.Gardiner & Gray, p. 12 In October 1904 Captain (later First Sea Lord) David Beatty assumed command until he returned home in late 1905.Lambert, p. 335 The ship returned home in 1907 for a lengthy refit. She returned to the Mediterranean in 1909 and was assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron. She began another refit at Devonport Royal Dockyard in October 1912. When it was completed in February 1913, she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Sir Christopher Craddock's 4th Cruiser Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station.
After the start of the war, Cradock transferred his flag to the faster HMS Good Hope while Suffolk remained in the Atlantic hunting for German raiders. She captured a German merchant ship on 8 August and remained in the Atlantic until August 1917 when she became flagship of the China Station. She became a private ship in November 1918 and deployed to Vladivostok to support the Siberian Intervention against the Bolsheviks. Suffolk returned home in 1919 and became a cadet training ship before she was listed for sale in April 1920.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 12–13 The ship was sold for scrap on 1 July and broken up in 1922 in Germany.
