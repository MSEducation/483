The Kaindl Hut ([tpl]lang-de|Kaindlhütte[/tpl]) is a privately run mountain hut at a height of [tpl]Convert|1293|m|ft[/tpl] in the Kaisergebirge mountains in the Austrian state of Tyrol.

==Location==

The Kaindl Hut lies in the western part of the Kaisergebirge on an Alpine meadow, the Steinbergalm, and at the foot of the Zettenkaiser, Scheffauer and Hackenköpfe mountains. North of the Kaindl Hut is the rather unimpressive Gamskogel (1,448 m) and the wooded ridge of the Brentenjoch. The hut is located in the Wilder Kaiser nature reserve.

==Tour options==

To the north is a gently sloping valley bowl, that is surrounded by rolling grass-covered mountains (‘’Grasbergen’’). Here there are many scenic and easy walks. Destinations, which can be taken in as part of a full day’s round trip, are the Brentenjoch, Gamskogel and Brandkogel. To the south, by contrast, are the jagged rock faces of the Wilder Kaiser.
