Curiel's book Al' America won the 2008 American Book Award. The Washington Post reviewed the work saying,  In the wake of a bruising presidential campaign, Americans of all faiths ought to consider how to strengthen ties to their Arab and Muslim fellow citizens. Curiel's book, though short-sighted in some ways, can play a role in persuading the skeptical that Arab and Muslim traditions are already woven deeply into the American fabric. ·[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/06/AR2008110602810.html| title=Peace Be Upon Us| author=Paul M.
