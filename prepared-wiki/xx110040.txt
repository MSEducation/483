Christiansongs (styled CHRISTIANsongs) is the fourth full-length album by Joy Electric. A music video was recorded for "Children of the Lord." In 2006, it was rereleased on iTunes, along with Robot Rock and Melody. This album remains to this day the most overtly spiritual Joy Electric release, as the title suggests. Tracks such as "The Magic Of" and "Singing in Gee" maintain the distinct fantasy theme from Joy Electric's previous two albums, whereas tracks such as "Children of the Lord" and the cover "Make My Life a Prayer" speak in very plain and certain terms of Martin's devotion to God.
