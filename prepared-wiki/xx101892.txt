Northolt tube station is a station on the London Underground Central line in Northolt in the London Borough of Ealing. It is in Travelcard Zone 5 and between Greenford and South Ruislip stations.

==History==

The Great Western Railway constructed a halt at this location named Northolt Halt in 1907, which was on what was the New North Main Line to Birmingham. It was renamed Northolt (for West End) Halt, before gaining station status under its original shorter name. It was closed in 1948 when the Central line was extended on a new pair of tracks from North Acton, the current Northolt tube station opening on 21 November 1948.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/central.html#dates |title=Central Line, Dates |work=Clive's Underground Line Guides |accessdate=11 October 2009 [/tpl] The opening had been planned to be in the 1930s but was delayed by the Second World War.

==The station today==

The station has an island platform with passenger access down from the booking hall. Trains terminating at the station may use either a turnback siding west of the platforms to leave the running lines and run eastwards later or a crossover east of the station for more immediate return to central London.
North of the Central line tracks there is the singled track of the former GWR New North Main Line from Paddington which now is used by freight trains and a single daily passenger service (operated by Chiltern Railways) between Paddington and Gerrards Cross.[tpl]cite web|title=Timetable 11 December 2011 to 13 May 2012|url=http://www.chilternrailways.co.uk/sites/default/files/December%202011%20Timetable%20booklet.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2012|publisher=Chiltern Railways[/tpl] There are no longer any platforms on this line.
