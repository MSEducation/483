[[List of world records in chess]]

CATEGORIES: History of chess, Sports world records

This is a list of world records in chess as achieved in organized tournament, match, or simultaneous exhibition play.

==Longest game==

The longest tournament chess game (in terms of moves) ever to be played was Nikolić-Arsović, Belgrade 1989, which lasted for 269 moves and took 20 hours and 15 minutes to complete a drawn game.Ivan Nikolic vs Goran Arsovic, Belgrade 1989Chess records by Tim Krabbé At the time this game was played, FIDE had modified the fifty-move rule to allow 100 moves to be played without a piece being captured in a rook and bishop versus rook endgame, the situation in Nikolić versus Arsović. FIDE has since rescinded that modification to the rule.
The longest decisive tournament game is Fressinet–Kosteniuk, Villandry 2007, which Kosteniuk won in 237 moves.Fressinet vs. Kosteniuk The last 116 moves were a rook and bishop versus rook ending, as in Nikolić – Arsović. Fressinet could have claimed a draw under the fifty-move rule, but did not do so since neither player was keeping score, it being a rapid chess game. Earlier in the tournament, Korchnoi had successfully invoked the rule to claim a draw against Fressinet; the arbiters overruled Fressinet's argument that Korchnoi could not do so without keeping score. Fressinet, apparently wanting to be consistent, did not try to claim a draw against Kosteniuk in the same situation.A chess feast in Château de Villandry

==Shortest game==

In terms of number of moves, the quickest mate possible in chess is known as Fool's mate (1.g4 e5 2.f3?? Qh4# and variants thereof). This has been known to occur in amateur play. ChessGames.com gives a game L. Darling-R. Wood, 1983, that was published on April Fool's Day in Northwest Chess magazine (1.g4 e6 2.f4?? Qh4#).Darling-Wood, NWC 1983 Bill Wall lists, in addition to Darling-Wood, three other games that ended with Black checkmating on the second move.Miniatures. Retrieved on 2009-01-04. In a tournament game at odds of pawn and move, White delivered checkmate on move 2: W. Cooke-"Rg", Cape Town Chess Club handicap tournament 1908 (remove Black's f-pawn) 1.e4 g5?? 2.Qh5#.Edward Winter, Chess Note 5858. The same game had previously been played in Leeky-Mason, Dublin 1867.[tpl]Harv|Winter|2003|p=99[/tpl]
The shortest decisive game ever played in master play that was decided because of the position on the board (i.e. not because of a forfeit or protest) is Z. Đorđević – M. Kovačević, Bela Crkva 1984. It lasted only three moves (1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 c6 3.e3?? Qa5+ winning the bishop), and White resigned.Z Djordjevic vs M Kovacevic, Bela Crkva 1984[tpl]Harv|Fox|James|1993|p=177[/tpl] This was repeated in Vassallo-Gamundi, Salamanca 1998. (In a number of other games, White has played on after 3...Qa5+, occasionally drawingTim Krabbé, Entry No. 257. Retrieved on 2009-05-04. or even winningCarl D. Latino v. Steven R. Dumas, North American Open 2010 in this line.)
There have been many forfeited games (which could technically be regarded as losses in zero moves), the most notable examples being Game 2 of the 1972 world championship match between Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer, which Fischer defaulted,[tpl]Harv|Brady|1973|pp=244–45[/tpl] and Game 5 of the 2006 world championship match between Vladimir Kramnik and Veselin Topalov, which Kramnik defaulted.Chess Informant, Volume 98, Šahovski Informator, 2007, p. 295. A game between Fischer and Oscar Panno, played at the Palma de Mallorca Interzonal 1970, went 1. c4 resigns. Panno refused to play to protest the organizers' rescheduling of the game to accommodate Fischer's desire not to play on his religion's Sabbath. Panno was not present when the game was to begin. Fischer waited ten minutes before making his move and went to get Panno to convince him to play. Fifty-two minutes had elapsed on Panno's clock before he came to the board and resigned.[tpl]Harv|Brady|1973|p=179[/tpl][tpl]Harv|Wade|O'Connell|1973|pp=344, 410[/tpl] (At the time, an absence of sixty minutes resulted in a forfeit.)[tpl]Harv|Brady|1973|p=245[/tpl]
Under recently instituted FIDE rules, a player who is late for the beginning of a round loses the game, as does a player whose cellphone makes any sound in the tournament hall. The former rule was used at the 2009 Chinese Championship to forfeit Hou Yifan for arriving five seconds late for the beginning of a round.New rule. Good or bad? You decide. susanpolgar.blogspot.com. Retrieved on 2009-10-25. The latter rule was used to forfeit Aleksander Delchev against Stuart Conquest after the move 1.d4 in the 2009 European Team Championship.[tpl]cite news|url=http://chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=5867|title=Novi Sad: another loss by ringtone|date=2009-10-25|publisher=ChessBase News|accessdate=2009-10-25[/tpl]
The German grandmaster Robert Hübner also lost a game without playing any moves. In a World Student Team Championship game played in Graz in 1972, Hübner played one move and offered a draw to Kenneth Rogoff, who accepted. However, the arbiters insisted that some moves be played, so the players played the following ridiculous game: 1. c4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. Ng1 Bg7 4. Qa4 0-0 5. Qxd7 Qxd7 6. g4 Qxd2+ 7. Kxd2 Nxg4 8. b4 a5 9. a4 Bxa1 10. Bb2 Nc6 11. Bh8 Bg7 12. h4 axb4 draw agreed). The arbiters ruled that both players must apologize and play an actual game at 7 p.m. Rogoff appeared and apologized; Hübner did neither. Hübner's clock was started, and after an hour Rogoff was declared the winner.[tpl]Harv|Alexander|1973|pp=80–81[/tpl] The young star players Wang Chen and Lu Shanglei both lost a game in which they had played no moves. They agreed to a draw without play at the 2009 Zhejiang Lishui Xingqiu Cup International Open Chess Tournament held in Lishui, Zhejiang Province, China. The chief arbiter declared both players to have lost the game.Susan Polgar Daily Chess News and Information, Double forfeit (based on Polgar's translation of Chinese-language Sina Sports, published 2009-09-21). Retrieved on 2009-09-29.
A game may be drawn in any number of moves, or even no moves, if the tournament officials (unlike those at Graz and Lishui) do not object. According to ChessGames.com, in the 1968 Skopje–Ohrid tournament Dragoljub Janosevic and Efim Geller agreed to a draw without playing any moves.Janosevic-Geller, Skopje/Ohrid 1968 Tony Miles and Stewart Reuben did the same thing in the last round of the Luton 1975 tournament, "with the blessing of the controller", in order to assure themselves of first and second places respectively.[tpl]Harv|Whyld|1986|p=124[/tpl][tpl]Harv|Fox|James|1993|p=178[/tpl]

===Shortest decisive World Championship game===

As mentioned above, Fischer (in 1972) and Kramnik (in 2006) each forfeited a world championship game without playing any moves. Other than those unplayed games, the shortest decisive game in a world championship occurred between Viswanathan Anand and Boris Gelfand in game 8 of the World Chess Championship 2012. Gelfand resigned after Anand's 17th move, 17.Qf2.Anand-Gelfand

==Fewest moves played in a tournament==

In the Premier I group at the 2003 Capablanca Memorial tournament, Péter Székely took just 130 moves (an average of 10 moves per game) to draw all 13 of his games.[tpl]Harv|Winter|2008[/tpl]

==Latest first capture==

In Rogoff-Williams, World Junior Championship, Stockholm 1969, the first capture (94.bxc5) occurred on White's 94th move.Kenneth Rogoff vs Arthur Howard Williams, World Junior Championship, B Final 1969 Filipowicz-Smederevac, Polanica Zdroj 1966 was drawn in 70 moves under the fifty-move rule, without any piece or pawn having been captured.[tpl]Harv|Whyld|1986|p=124[/tpl]

==Latest first capture in a decisive game==

Nuber-Keckeisen, Mengen 1994 lasted 31 moves without a single capture. In the end Keckeisen, facing imminent checkmate, resigned.Nuber-Keckeisen, Mengen 1994
In the decisive game Yates-Znosko-Borovsky, Tunbridge Wells 1927, the first capture occurred on move 40.The game appears in "The Game of Chess" by Harry Golombek, Penguin Books, first published 1954, on page 119. The game is only given from move 40 onwards, but the diagram showing position on move 40 shows all pieces and pawns present.

==Greatest concentration of resident grandmasters==

In December 2005, Reykjavík, Iceland, with eight grandmasters (Jon Arnason, Jóhann Hjartarson, Margeir Petursson, Fridrik Olafsson, Throstur Thorhallsson, Helgi Gretarsson, Hannes Stefansson, and Bobby Fischer) had a higher percentage of resident grandmasters per capita than any other city worldwide; the city of 110,000 had one grandmaster per 13,750 residents.The Beer Sheva Chess Club – see Addendum in middle of article [tpl]As of|2008|4[/tpl], the population of Reykjavík had grown to 118,861; Fischer died on January 17, 2008.

==Perfect tournament and match scores==

In top-class chess it is rare for a player to complete a tournament or match with a 100 percent score. This result was however achieved in tournaments by:
[tpl]Harv|Hooper|Whyld|1992|p=81[/tpl][/ref]
[tpl]Harv|Hooper|Whyld|1992|p=81[/tpl][/ref][tpl]Harv|Soltis|2002|pp=81–83[/tpl][tpl]Harv|Sunnucks|1970|p=76[/tpl]Sunnucks also lists Alekhine's 10/10 score at Caracas 1939, but Soltis writes that it, and Buenos Aires 1926, which Alekhine won with the same score, were "weak events". [tpl]Harv|Soltis|2002|p=81[/tpl].
Perfect scores were achieved in matches by:
William Lombardy is the only player ever to achieve a perfect score in the World Junior Chess Championship, open to players under the age of 20 as of January 1 in the year of competition. He scored 11–0 at Toronto 1957.[tpl]Harv|Fox|James|1993|pp=17–18[/tpl][tpl]Harv|Kažić|1974|pp=273–74[/tpl]Lombardy 2011, back cover.
Vera Menchik won four consecutive Women's World Chess Championship tournaments with perfect scores, a total of 45 games (8–0 at Prague 1931, 14–0 at Folkestone 1933, 9–0 at Warsaw 1935, and 14–0 at Stockholm 1937).[tpl]Harv|Hooper|Whyld|1992|p=81[/tpl][tpl]Harv|Kažić|1974|pp=261–63[/tpl] She only played 43 of the 45 games, since Harum, the Austrian contestant, was unable to reach Folkestone and thus forfeited all of her games in that double round robin event.[tpl]Harv|Sergeant|1934|p=324[/tpl]
Alekhine scored 9–0 on first board for France at the 3rd Chess Olympiad (Hamburg, 1930), and Dragoljub Čirić scored 8–0 as second reserve (the sixth player on his team) for Yugoslavia at the 17th Olympiad (Havana, 1966), but each played only about half of the possible games.[tpl]Harv|Kažić|1974|pp=16, 95[/tpl] Robert Gwaze scored 9–0 on first board for Zimbabwe at the 35th Olympiad (Bled, 2002).[tpl]Harv|Hook|2008|p=177[/tpl] Paul Keres scored 13.5 points out of 14 games (96.4%) playing fourth board for the USSR at the 11th Olympiad (Amsterdam, 1954).[tpl]Harv|Kažić|1974|p=56[/tpl]

==Most decisive Interzonal victory==

The highest percentage score at an Interzonal was 82.5% (16½ points out of 20 games), scored by Alexander Kotov at the 1952 Stockholm Interzonal. The largest margin of victory was achieved by Bobby Fischer, who won the Palma de Mallorca Interzonal in 1970 with 18½ points out of 23 games, 3½ points ahead of second-place finishers Bent Larsen, Efim Geller and Robert Hübner.

==Most games won==

Gustav Neumann won all 34 of his games at the aforementioned Berlin 1865 tournament.[tpl]Harv|Fox|James|1993|p=129[/tpl]

==Most games lost==

Nicholas MacLeod holds the record for the most games lost in a single tournament: he lost 31 games at the Sixth American Chess Congress at New York 1889, while winning six and drawing one.[tpl]Harv|Chernev|1974|p=50[/tpl][tpl]Harv|Fox|James|1993|pp=168–69[/tpl][tpl]Harv|Winter|1996|p=3[/tpl] MacLeod was only 19 and the tournament, a 20-player double-round robin, was one of the longest tournaments in chess history. The most games lost by a player who lost all of his games in a tournament was by Colonel Moreau. At Monte Carlo 1903, Moreau lost all 26 of his games.[tpl]Harv|Fox|James|1993|p=169[/tpl][tpl]Harv|Whyld|1986|p=125[/tpl]

==Lost all games on time==

At the Büsum 1969 tournament, Friedrich Sämisch lost all 15 games by exceeding the time control.Edward Winter, Chess Note 8237. He lost all 13 of his games at the Linköping 1969 tournament the same way.[tpl]Harv|Hooper|Whyld|1992|pp=352–53[/tpl]

==Consecutive wins==

Steinitz won his last 16 games at Vienna 1873, including a two-game playoff against Blackburne at the end. He played no serious chess until an 1876 match against Blackburne that Steinitz swept 7–0. After a long period of inactivity, Steinitz played at Vienna 1882, where he won his first two games before finally ending his winning streak with a draw. Steinitz's 25-game winning streak over nine years has never been equaled.[tpl]Harv|Soltis|2002|p=42[/tpl]
The modern record of 20 consecutive wins is held by Bobby Fischer. (Some commentators give this as 19, electing not to count Fischer's game against Oscar Panno, who resigned after Fischer's first move as a protest). Fischer won his last seven games at the 1970 Palma de Mallorca Interzonal (including the one-move game against Panno). In the quarter-finals of the Candidates Matches leading to the world championship, Fischer swept Grandmaster Mark Taimanov 6–0. In the semi-finals, Fischer swept Grandmaster Bent Larsen by the same score. In the Candidates Match final, Fischer beat former World Champion Tigran Petrosian in the first game before Petrosian snapped the streak by beating Fischer in the second match game.[tpl]Harv|Soltis|2002|pp=43, 73[/tpl]
The record for most consecutive professional tournament victories is held by Garry Kasparov, who placed first or equal first in 15 individual supertournaments, from 1981 to 1990.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=103043 |title=Jaedong vs Kasparov |publisher=Teamliquid.net |date= |accessdate=2013-12-09[/tpl] The streak was broken by Vasily Ivanchuk at Linares 1991, where Kasparov placed 2nd, half a point behind him.Linares: The Aníbal Hall of Fame

==Consecutive games without a loss==

Between October 23, 1973, when he lost a game in a Soviet championship, and October 16, 1974, when he lost to Kirov at the Novi Sad tournament, Mikhail Tal had a string of 95 tournament games without a loss (46 wins and 49 draws).[tpl]Harv|Soltis|2002|p=44[/tpl][tpl]Harv|Tal|1976|p=500[/tpl] Tal also has the second-longest unbeaten run in top-level competition. He went unbeaten in 86 games from July 1972, when he lost to Gunnar Uusi in the tenth round at Viljandi, until April 1973, when he lost to Balashov in round two of the USSR Team Championship in Moscow. This streak included 47 wins and 39 draws.[tpl]Harv|Tal|1976|[/tpl]
José Raúl Capablanca went eight years without a loss (1916 to 1924, including his World Chess Championship 1921 victory over Emanuel Lasker), but this was "only" 63 games.Wang Yue's Unbeaten Streak, Chessdom, December 2008. Retrieved on 2008-12-24.

==Best and worst results in simultaneous exhibitions==

In 1922, José Raúl Capablanca, the recently crowned World Champion, played 103 opponents simultaneously in Cleveland. He completed the exhibition in seven hours, scoring 102 wins and one draw (99.5%), the best result ever in a simultaneous exhibition on over 75 boards.[tpl]Harv|Damsky|2005|p=235[/tpl][tpl]Harv|Chernev|1974|p=8[/tpl]
The best result in a simultaneous exhibition solely against grandmasters is former World Champion Garry Kasparov's performance against a West German team consisting of Vlastimil Hort, Eric Lobron, Matthias Wahls, and Gerald Hertneck at Baden-Baden in 1992. Unusually for simultaneous exhibitions, half of the players (Lobron and Hertneck) played White. Kasparov beat Lobron and Wahls, and drew the other two players, for a 3–1 victory.[tpl]Harv|Damsky|2005|pp=247–49[/tpl] Before the term "grandmaster" was in common usage or had an established meaning, Paul Morphy gave an arguably even more impressive exhibition. On April 26, 1859, at London's St. James Chess Club, Morphy played "five games simultaneously against a group of masters who could be described as among the top ten players of the day", scoring 3–2. He defeated Jules Arnous de Rivière and Henry Bird, drew Samuel Boden and Johann Löwenthal, and lost only to Thomas Wilson Barnes.[tpl]Harv|Soltis|2002|p=103[/tpl]
The worst result in a simultaneous exhibition given by a master occurred in 1951, when International Master Robert Wade gave a simultaneous exhibition against 30 Russian schoolboys, aged 14 and under. After 7 hours of play, Wade had lost 20 games and drawn the remaining 10 (16.7%).[tpl]Harv|Kotov|1964|p=66[/tpl][tpl]Harv|Chernev|1974|p=110[/tpl][tpl]Harv|Fox|James|1993|pp=170–71[/tpl]GM Alexander Kotov wrote that former World Champion Max Euwe warned new arrivals in Moscow, "Just don't give exhibitions against Pioneers" (i.e. students at the Palaces of the Pioneers) [tpl]Harv|Kotov|1964|p=66[/tpl].
The absolute worst result in a simultaneous exhibition was two wins and 18 losses (10%) by Joe Hayden, aged 17, in August 1977. Hayden wanted to set an American record by playing 180 people simultaneously at a shopping center in Cardiff, NJ, but only 20 showed up to play. Hayden lost 18 of the games (including one to a thirteen-year-old named Raymond Ouyang). His two wins were scored against his mother and a player who got tired of waiting and left in mid-game, thus forfeiting the game.[tpl]Harv|Fox|James|1993|pp=190–91[/tpl]

==Most games in blindfold exhibitions==

Miguel Najdorf played against 45 opponents in a simultaneous blindfold exhibition given at Sao Paulo in 1947, winning 39, losing 2 and drawing 4 games (after a similar display in Rosario, Argentina, in 1943, against 40 players). Later Janos Flesch (52 games) claimed to have broken this record, but his exhibition was not properly monitored and so it was not recognized. In November 2011, little-known German master Marc Lang broke Najdorf's record, playing 46 opponents.[tpl]cite news |title=Marc Lang catches the eye by breaking world blindfold record |author=Leonard Barden |newspaper=The Guardian |date=30 December 2011 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2011/dec/30/chess-marc-lang-blindfold |location=London[/tpl]

==Most players taking part in a multi-simul==

On October 21, 2006, a gigantic multi-simul was organized in El Zócalo, Mexico City's central square. About 600 masters played against 20 to 25 opponents each. The total number of players was 13,446 according to the authorities. The tables were arranged in squares of different colors, each containing seven simuls. The square resembled in this way a giant chessboard. Anatoly Karpov was a guest at the event but did not play in the simuls as he was busy signing 1951 copies of his latest book.  Guinness World Records acknowledged the event as the largest one held in a single day.Chessbase report of the event with many photos
