[[Thouless energy]]

CATEGORIES: Mesoscopic physics, Condensed matter physics

It was first introduced by the Scottish-American physicist David J. Thouless when studying Anderson localization

as a measure of the sensitivity of energy levels to a change in the boundary conditions of the system. Though being a classical quantity, it has been shown to play an important role in the quantum-mechanical treatment of disordered systems.
