</ref> It is the main sediment source of the 1500&nbsp;km long [[Hikurangi|Hikurangi Channel]], which supplies turbidites to the [[Hikurangi Trough]], as well as to low parts of the oceanic [[Hikurangi Plateau]], and to the edge of the southwest [[Pacific Basin]]. It is deeply incised into the narrow, [[Tectonics|tectonically active]], [[continental margin]]. It is thought to be the sink for the coastal sediment transport system that carries large amounts of erosional debris northwards up the coast from the rivers draining the tectonically active mountains of the South Island.<ref name="lewis">

===Landslide tsunami hazard===

There is a known risk of an earthquake-triggered tsunami resulting from the displacement of sediment accumulating at the mouth of the canyon. Sediment consisting of fine sand and silt is being deposited at the head of the Kaikoura Canyon with an estimated total volume of 0.24 cubic kilometres accumulated. A near-field tsunami caused by the displacement of this sediment poses a significant threat to the surrounding area, especially coastal infrastructure such as roads and houses.[ref]

Historical accounts of canyon-related tsunami in this region are uncertain. Geological evidence is also limited, and no palaeotsunami specific studies have been carried out to date. However in archaeological literature, there are some possible indications of past marine inundation events. Marine sediments can be seen to overlie an historical Maori occupation site on Seddon's Ridge, near South Bay. These deposits indicate that marine inundation occurred sometime within the last 150â€“200 years. Seddon's Ridge is an uplifted beach ridge and has a long history of Maori settlement. An older village site dating from approximately 650 years before present, situated approximately 350 metres from the shoreline, contains reworked oven stones which are overlain by marine overwash deposits. Without accompanying reliable geological data, this kind of archaeological evidence is only circumstantial.  However it does indicate that the ocean has inundated past coastal settlements in the region as a result of a severe storm surge or tsunami.[ref]

Rapidly accumulating sandy sediment on a steep slope, in an active tectonic region, is likely to be susceptible to failure during moderately large earthquakes. Strong ground shaking associated with rupture on nearby faults can be expected to reduce the shear strength of the sandy sediment deposit at the thumb|Marlborough Fault SystemCanyon Head and may trigger mass failures. It is estimated that an earthquake magnitude 8 on the Richter Scale or shaking equivalent to 5 on the Modified Mercalli earthquake scale would be enough to trigger such an event. The Kaikoura Region is adjacent to the Marlborough fault zone. There are a number of faults in this area predicted to have the capacity to produce such an event. The most likely are the Hope Fault, previously New Zealand's most active fault, and the larger Alpine Fault. The lesser-known Hundalee Fault also terminates near the Kaikoura coast, and although it is not as large as other faults in the area, it still has the potential to trigger a submarine landslide event. The return period for major magnitude 8 or around MM 5 earthquakes at Kaikoura has been estimated to be in the order of 150 years based on what is know about the return time of earthquake events for regional faults in the Kaikoura area.
There is evidence of past failures in similar deposits in the Kaikoura Canyon, in the presence of numerous sand and gravel turbidite deposits in cores  taken from the canyon axis. Ground acceleration with a peak of 0.44 g is estimated at the Kaikoura township for a return period of 150 years.[ref]
