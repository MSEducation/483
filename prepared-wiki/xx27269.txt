Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba; in Chinese, Korea and Japanese: 銀杏, pinyin romanization: yín xìng, Hepburn romanization: ichō or ginnan, Vietnamese: bạch quả), also spelled gingko[tpl]cite web|title=Gingko|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gingko?s=t|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=28 March 2013[/tpl]  and also known as the maidenhair tree, is a unique species of tree with no living relatives. The ginkgo is a living fossil, recognisably similar to fossils dating back 270 million years. Native to China,ginkgo the tree is widely cultivated and was introduced early to human history. It has various uses in traditional medicine and as a source of food.

==Description==

Ginkgos are large trees, normally reaching a height of 20–35 m (66–115 feet), with some specimens in China being over 50 m (164 feet). The tree has an angular crown and long, somewhat erratic branches, and is usually deep rooted and resistant to wind and snow damage. Young trees are often tall and slender, and sparsely branched; the crown becomes broader as the tree ages. During autumn, the leaves turn a bright yellow, then fall, sometimes within a short space of time (one to 15 days). A combination of resistance to disease, insect-resistant wood and the ability to form aerial roots and sprouts makes ginkgos long-lived, with some specimens claimed to be more than 2,500 years old.
Ginkgo is a relatively shade-intolerant species that (at least in cultivation) grows best in environments that are well-watered and well-drained. The species shows a preference for disturbed sites; in the "semiwild" stands at Tian Mu Shan, many specimens are found along stream banks, rocky slopes, and cliff edges.   Accordingly, ginkgo retains a prodigious capacity for vegetative growth.  It is capable of sprouting from embedded buds near the base of the trunk (lignotubers, or basal chi chi) in response to disturbances, such as soil erosion. Old individuals are also capable of producing aerial roots on the undersides of large branches in response to disturbances such as crown damage; these roots can lead to successful clonal reproduction upon contacting the soil. These strategies are evidently important in the persistence of ginkgo; in a survey of the "semiwild" stands remaining in Tian Mu Shan, 40% of the specimens surveyed were multistemmed, and few saplings were present.Royer et al., pp. 86-87

==Branches==

Ginkgo branches grow in length by growth of shoots with regularly spaced leaves, as seen on most trees.  From the axils of these leaves, "spur shoots" (also known as short shoots) develop on second-year growth. Short shoots have very short internodes (so they may grow only one or two centimeters in several years) and their leaves are usually unlobed.  They are short and knobby, and are arranged regularly on the branches except on first-year growth.  Because of the short internodes, leaves appear to be clustered at the tips of short shoots, and reproductive structures are formed only on them (see pictures below - seeds and leaves are visible on short shoots). In ginkgos, as in other plants that possess them, short shoots allow the formation of new leaves in the older parts of the crown. After a number of years, a short shoot may change into a long (ordinary) shoot, or vice versa.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]

==Leaves==

The leaves are unique among seed plants, being fan-shaped with veins radiating out into the leaf blade, sometimes bifurcating (splitting), but never anastomosing to form a network.Ginkgoales: More on Morphology  Two veins enter the leaf blade at the base and fork repeatedly in two; this is known as dichotomous venation.  The leaves are usually 5–10 cm (2–4 in), but sometimes up to 15 cm (6 in) long. The old popular name "maidenhair tree" is because the leaves resemble some of the pinnae of the maidenhair fern, Adiantum capillus-veneris. Ginkgos are prized for their autumn foliage, which is a deep saffron yellow.
Leaves of long shoots are usually notched or lobed, but only from the outer surface, between the veins. They are borne both on the more rapidly growing branch tips, where they are alternate and spaced out, and also on the short, stubby spur shoots, where they are clustered at the tips.

==Reproduction==

Ginkgos are dioecious, with separate sexes, some trees being female and others being male. Male plants produce small pollen cones with sporophylls, each bearing two microsporangia spirally arranged around a central axis.
Female plants do not produce cones. Two ovules are formed at the end of a stalk, and after pollination, one or both develop into seeds. The seed is 1.5–2 cm long. Its fleshy outer layer (the sarcotesta) is light yellow-brown, soft, and fruit-like. It is attractive in appearance, but contains butyric acid[tpl]cite book | last=Raven | first=Peter H. | author2=Ray F. Evert; Susan E.

Beneath the sarcotesta is the hard sclerotesta (the "shell" of the seed) and a papery endotesta, with the nucellus surrounding the female gametophyte at the center.Laboratory IX -- Ginkgo, Cordaites, and the Conifers

The fertilization of ginkgo seeds occurs via motile sperm, as in cycads, ferns, mosses and algae. The sperm are large (about 70–90 micrometres)[tpl]cite book|author=Vanbeek A. Vanbeek |title= Ginkgo Biloba (Medicinal and Aromatic Plants: Industrial Profiles)|publisher=CRC Press |year=2000 |isbn=90-5702-488-8 |page=37 [/tpl] and are similar to the sperm of cycads, which are slightly larger.  Ginkgo sperm were first discovered by the Japanese botanist Sakugoro Hirase in 1896.History of Discovery of Spermatozoids In Ginkgo biloba and Cycas revoluta The sperm have a complex multi-layered structure, which is a continuous belt of basal bodies that form the base of several thousand flagella which actually have a cilia-like motion.  The flagella/cilia apparatus pulls the body of the sperm forwards.  The sperm have only a tiny distance to travel to the archegonia, of which there are usually two or three.  Two sperm are produced, one of which successfully fertilizes the ovule. Although it is widely held that fertilization of ginkgo seeds occurs just before or after they fall in early autumn, embryos ordinarily occur in seeds just before and after they drop from the tree.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Holt |first1=B.

==Distribution and habitat==

Although Ginkgo biloba and other species of the genus were once widespread throughout the world, its range shrank until by two million years ago, it was restricted to a small area of China.
For centuries, it was thought to be extinct in the wild, but is now known to grow in at least two small areas in Zhejiang province in eastern China, in the Tian Mu Shan Reserve. However, recent studies indicate high genetic uniformity among ginkgo trees from these areas, arguing against a natural origin of these populations and suggesting the ginkgo trees in these areas may have been planted and preserved by Chinese monks over a period of about 1,000 years.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Shen |first1=L |last2=Chen |first2=X-Y |last3=Zhang |first3=X |last4=Li |first4=Y-Y |last5=Fu |first5=C-X |last6=Qiu |first6=Y-X |title=Genetic variation of Ginkgo biloba L.

Where it occurs in the wild, it is found infrequently in deciduous forests and valleys on acidic loess (i.e. fine, silty soil) with good drainage. The soil it inhabits is typically in the pH range of 5.0 to 5.5.[tpl]Cite book| last=Fu| first=Liguo; Li, Nan; Mill, Robert R. | contribution =Ginkgo biloba| year=1999| title=Flora of China| editor-last=Wu| editor-first=Z.

In many areas of China, it has been long cultivated, and it is common in the southern third of the country. It has also been commonly cultivated in North America for over 200 years and in Europe for close to 300, but during that time, it has never become significantly naturalized.[tpl]Cite book| last =Whetstone| first =R.

==Taxonomy and naming==

The species was initially described by Linnaeus in 1771, the specific epithet biloba derived from the Latin bis, 'two' and loba, 'lobed', referring to the shape of the leaves.[tpl]cite book|author = Simpson DP| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary  | publisher = Cassell Ltd.| year = 1979|edition = 5|location = London|page = 883| isbn=0-304-52257-0[/tpl] Two names for the species recognise the botanist Richard Salisbury, a placement by Nelson as Pterophyllus salisburiensis and the earlier Salisburia adiantifolia proposed by James Edward Smith. The epithet of the latter may have been intended to denote a characteristic resembling Adiantum, the  genus of maidenhair ferns.[tpl]cite web|url=http://imaginatorium.org/sano/ginkgo2.htm|title=Ginkgo - origins|last=Chandler|first=Brian|year=2000|work=Ginkgo pages|accessdate=22 November 2010[/tpl]
The relationship of ginkgo to other plant groups remains uncertain. It has been placed loosely in the divisions Spermatophyta and Pinophyta, but no consensus has been reached. Since its seeds are not protected by an ovary wall, it can morphologically be considered a gymnosperm. The apricot-like structures produced by female ginkgo trees are technically not fruits, but are seeds that have a shell consisting of a soft and fleshy section (the sarcotesta), and a hard section (the sclerotesta).
The ginkgo is classified in its own division, the Ginkgophyta, comprising the single class Ginkgoopsida, order Ginkgoales, family Ginkgoaceae, genus Ginkgo and is the only extant species within this group. It is one of the best-known examples of a living fossil, because Ginkgoales other than G. biloba are not known from the fossil record after the Pliocene.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Zhou |first1=Zhiyan |last2=Zheng |first2=Shaolin |title=Palaeobiology: The missing link in Ginkgo evolution |journal=Nature |volume=423 |issue=6942 |pages=821–2 |year=2003 |pmid=12815417 |doi=10.1038/423821a[/tpl][ref]

==Etymology==

The older Chinese name for this plant is 銀果, meaning "silver fruit", nowadays pronounced as yínguǒ in Mandarin.
The most usual names today are 白果 (bái guǒ), meaning "white fruit", and [tpl]lang|zh|銀杏[/tpl] (yínxìng), meaning "silver apricot". The former name was borrowed directly in Vietnamese as bạch quả.
The latter name was borrowed in Japanese ぎんなん (ginnan) and Korean 은행 (eunhaeng), when the tree itself was introduced from China.
The scientific name Ginkgo is the result of a spelling error that occurred three centuries ago. Chinese characters typically have multiple pronunciations in Japanese, and the characters 銀杏 used for ginnan can also be pronounced ginkyō. Engelbert Kaempfer, the first Westerner to investigate the species in 1690, wrote down this pronunciation in his notes he later used for the Amoenitates Exoticae (1712) with the "awkward" spelling "ginkgo". This appears to be a simple error of Kaempfer, taking his spelling of other Japanese words containing the syllable "kyō" into account, a more precise romanization following his writing habits would have been "ginkio" or "ginkjo".Wolfgang Michel: On Engelbert Kaempfer’s "Ginkgo". Research Notes, 2005/2011 Linné, who relied on Kaempfer when dealing with Japanese plants adopted the spelling given in Kaempfer's "Flora Japanica" (Amoenitates Exoticae, p. 811).

==Palaeontology==

The ginkgo is a living fossil, with fossils recognisably related to modern ginkgo from the Permian, dating back 270 million years.  The most plausible ancestral group for the order Ginkgoales is the Pteridospermatophyta, also known as the "seed ferns", specifically the order Peltaspermales.  The closest living relatives of the clade are the cycads,Royer et al., p.84 which share with the extant G. biloba the characteristic of motile sperm.  Fossils attributable to the genus Ginkgo first appeared in the Early Jurassic, and the genus diversified and spread throughout Laurasia during the middle Jurassic and Early Cretaceous.  It declined in diversity as the Cretaceous progressed, and by the Paleocene, Ginkgo adiantoides was the only Ginkgo species left in the Northern Hemisphere, while a markedly different (and poorly documented) form persisted in the Southern Hemisphere. At the end of the Pliocene, Ginkgo fossils disappeared from the fossil record everywhere except in a small area of central China, where the modern species survived. It is doubtful whether the Northern Hemisphere fossil species of Ginkgo can be reliably distinguished. Given the slow pace of evolution and morphological similarity between members of the genus, there may have been only one or two species existing in the Northern Hemisphere through the entirety of the Cenozoic: present-day G. biloba (including G. adiantoides) and G. gardneri from the Paleocene of Scotland.Royer et al., p.85
At least morphologically, G. gardneri and the Southern Hemisphere species are the only known post-Jurassic taxa that can be unequivocally recognised. The remainder may have been ecotypes or subspecies. The implications would be that G. biloba had occurred over an extremely wide range, had remarkable genetic flexibility and, though evolving genetically, never showed much speciation.  While it may seem improbable that a species may exist as a contiguous entity for many millions of years, many of the ginkgo's life-history parameters fit. These are: extreme longevity; slow reproduction rate; (in Cenozoic and later times) a wide, apparently contiguous, but steadily contracting distribution coupled with, as far as can be demonstrated from the fossil record, extreme ecological conservatism (restriction to disturbed streamside environments).Royer et al., p.91
Modern-day G. biloba grows best in environments that are well-watered and drained,Royer et al., p.87 and the extremely similar fossil Ginkgo favored similar environments: the sediment record at the majority of fossil Ginkgo localities indicates it grew primarily in disturbed environments along streams and levees.  Ginkgo, therefore, presents an "ecological paradox" because while it possesses some favorable traits for living in disturbed environments (clonal reproduction) many of its other life-history traits (slow growth, large seed size, late reproductive maturity) are the opposite of those exhibited by modern plants that thrive in disturbed settings.Royer et al., p.92
Given the slow rate of evolution of the genus, Ginkgo possibly represents a preangiosperm strategy for survival in disturbed streamside environments.   Ginkgo evolved in an era before flowering plants, when ferns, cycads, and cycadeoids dominated disturbed streamside environments, forming low, open, shrubby canopies.  Ginkgo's large seeds and habit of "bolting" - growing to a height of 10 m before elongating its side branches - may be adaptions to such an environment.  Because diversity in the genus Ginkgo drops through the Cretaceous (along with that of ferns, cycads, and cycadeoids)  at the same time the flowering plants were on the rise, the notion that flowering plants with better adaptations to disturbance displaced Ginkgo and its associates over time is supported.Royer et al., p.93
Ginkgo has been used for classifying plants with leaves that have more than four veins per segment, while Baiera for those with fewer than four veins per segment. Sphenobaiera has been used to classify plants with a broadly wedge-shaped leaf that lacks a distinct leaf stem. Trichopitys is distinguished by having multiple-forked leaves with cylindrical (not flattened), thread-like ultimate divisions; it is one of the earliest fossils ascribed to the Ginkgophyta.

==Cultivation and uses==

Ginkgo has long been cultivated in China; some planted trees at temples are believed to be over 1,500 years old. The first record of Europeans encountering it is in 1690 in Japanese temple gardens, where the tree was seen by the German botanist Engelbert Kaempfer. Because of its status in Buddhism and Confucianism, the ginkgo is also widely planted in Korea and parts of Japan; in both areas, some naturalization has occurred, with ginkgos seeding into natural forests.
In some areas, most intentionally planted ginkgos are male cultivars grafted onto plants propagated from seed, because the male trees will not produce the malodorous seeds. The popular cultivar 'Autumn Gold' is a clone of a male plant.
Ginkgos adapt well to the urban environment, tolerating pollution and confined soil spaces.[tpl]cite web |url=http://hort.ufl.edu/trees/GINBILB.pdf |format=PDF|title=Ginkgo biloba 'Autumn Gold' |author=Gilman, Edward F. and Dennis G. Watson|year=1993|accessdate=29 March 2008 |publisher=US Forest Service[/tpl] They rarely suffer disease problems, even in urban conditions, and are attacked by few insects.[tpl]cite book|author=Boland, Timothy, Laura E.

Ginkgos are also popular subjects for growing as penjing and bonsai;[tpl]cite web | first=Mark | last=D'Cruz | title=Ma-Ke Bonsai Care Guide for Ginkgo biloba | publisher=Ma-Ke Bonsai | url=http://guide.makebonsai.com/bonsailink.asp?quicklink=5022&name=Ginkgo_biloba | accessdate=2013-09-12[/tpl] they can be kept artificially small and tended over centuries. Furthermore, the trees are easy to propagate from seed.
The ginkgo leaf is the symbol of the Urasenke school of Japanese tea ceremony.  The tree is the national tree of China, and is the official tree of the Japanese capital of Tokyo, and the symbol of Tokyo is a ginkgo leaf.

==Hiroshima==

Extreme examples of the ginkgo's tenacity may be seen in Hiroshima, Japan, where six trees growing between 1–2 km from the 1945 atom bomb explosion were among the few living things in the area to survive the blast."A-bombed Ginkgo trees in Hiroshima, Japan", The Ginkgo Pages. While almost all other plants (and animals) in the area were destroyed, the ginkgos, though charred, survived and were soon healthy again. The trees are alive to this day.

==Culinary use==

The nut-like gametophytes inside the seeds are particularly esteemed in Asia, and are a traditional Chinese food. Ginkgo nuts are used in congee, and are often served at special occasions such as weddings and the Chinese New Year (as part of the vegetarian dish called Buddha's delight).  In Chinese culture, they are believed to have health benefits; some also consider them to have aphrodisiac qualities. Japanese cooks add ginkgo seeds (called ginnan) to dishes such as chawanmushi, and cooked seeds are often eaten along with other dishes.
When eaten in large quantities or over a long period, especially by childrenGinkgo Seed Poisoning.

One study suggests ginkgo's purported effect on cognition may be attributable to its inhibitory effect on norepinephrine reuptake.
Nonetheless, a meta-analysis in 2012Laws, Sweetnam and Kondel reported zero effect sizes for the impact of Ginkgo biloba on memory, attention and problem-solving in healthy individuals.

===In dementia===

Ginkgo has been studied as a possible treatment for Alzheimer's disease.  Preliminary studies were encouraging, but the current understanding is that Ginkgo is not an effective treatment or preventative for Alzheimer's.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Weinmann |first1=S |last2=Roll |first2=S |last3=Schwarzbach |first3=C |last4=Vauth |first4=C |last5=Willich |first5=SN |title=Effects of Ginkgo biloba in dementia: systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMC geriatrics |volume=10 |page=14 |year=2010 |pmid=20236541 |pmc=2846949 |doi=10.1186/1471-2318-10-14[/tpl][tpl]Cite doi | 10.1016/S1474-4422(12)70212-0[/tpl]  Research began with positive preclinical results in mice,Ginkgo Extract Has Multiple Actions on Alzheimer Symptoms Newswise, Retrieved on August 25, 2008. and a 2006 study found 160 mg of ginkgo extract to be as effective as a daily 5-mg dose of the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil in human subjects.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Mazza |first1=M. |last2=Capuano |first2=A. |last3=Bria |first3=P. |last4=Mazza |first4=S. |title=Ginkgo biloba and donepezil: a comparison in the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia in a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study |journal=European Journal of Neurology |volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=981–5 |year=2006 |pmid=16930364 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-1331.2006.01409.x[/tpl] A 2008 randomized controlled clinical trial found ginkgo ineffective at treating dementia in humans at a daily dose of 120 mg.[tpl]cite journal | author = McCarney R, Fisher P, Iliffe S, van Haselen R, Griffin M, van der Meulen J, Warner J | title =Ginkgo biloba for mild to moderate dementia in a community setting: a pragmatic, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial | year = 2008 | journal = Int J Geriatr Psychiatry | volume = 23 | issue = 12 | pages = 1222–30 | doi = 10.1002/gps.2055 | pmid = 18537221[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7453167.stm | title = Ginkgo 'does not treat dementia' | work = BBC News | date = June 16, 2008[/tpl] A similar trial published in 2010, however, found ginkgo effective at treating mild to moderate dementia at the higher single dose of 240 mg daily. Another randomized controlled trial, published in 2009, found no benefit from ginkgo in preventing cognitive decline or dementia when given at a dose of 120 mg twice daily. A similar study reported in 2012 concluded the long-term use of Ginkgo biloba extract does not affect progression to Alzheimer's disease.[tpl]cite doi | 10.1016/S1474-4422(12)70206-5[/tpl]   A recent meta-analysis of 9 studies of ginkgo for use in the treatment of dementia concluded it was more effective than placebo, although, like other dementia drugs, the clinical significance of these moderate effects was difficult to quantify.  An editorial in The Lancet concluded ginkgo biloba does not prevent dementia in elderly individuals with or without memory complaints or cognitive impairment and is not effective for prevention of Alzheimer's disease.

===In other symptoms===

Of the many conflicting results from basic research, ginkgo extract may have three effects on the human body: improvement in blood flow to most tissues and organs, protection against oxidative cell damage from free radicals, and blockage of many of the effects of platelet-activating factor (platelet aggregation, blood clotting)[tpl]cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=P |last2=MacLennan |first2=K |last3=Darlington |first3=CL |title=The neuroprotective properties of the Ginkgo biloba leaf: a review of the possible relationship to platelet-activating factor (PAF) |journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=131–9 |year=1996 |pmid=8691847 |doi=10.1016/0378-8741(96)01379-7[/tpl] that have been related to the development of a number of cardiovascular, renal, respiratory and central nervous system disorders. Ginkgolides, especially ginkgolide B, are potent antagonists against platelet-activating factor, and thus may be useful in protection and prevention of thrombus, endotoxic shock, and from myocardial ischemia.LU Ding-qiang, CHEN Jun "Pharmacological Activities of Ginkgolides"(School of Biological and Environmental Engineering, Jiangsu University of Science and Techno1ogy, Zhenjiang,Jiangsu 212013, China)http://defeatosteosarcoma.org/category/generalcancerresearch/nutrition-and-cancer/ginkgo-biloba-kaempferol/

==Side effects==

Ginkgo may have undesirable effects, especially for individuals with blood circulation disorders and those taking anticoagulants such as aspirin or warfarin, although recent studies have found ginkgo has little or no effect on the anticoagulant properties or pharmacodynamics of warfarin in healthy subjects.[tpl]cite journal |author=Jiang X, Williams KM, Liauw WS, Ammit AJ, Roufogalis BD, Duke CC, Day RO, McLachlan AJ |title=Effect of ginkgo and ginger on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin in healthy subjects |journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=425–32 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15801937 |pmc=1884814 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2005.02322.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0306-5251&date=2005&volume=59&issue=4&spage=425[/tpl] Ginkgo inhibits monoamine oxidase,[tpl]cite journal |author=White HL, Scates PW, Cooper BR |title=Extracts of Ginkgo biloba leaves inhibit monoamine oxidase |journal=Life Sci. |volume=58 |issue=16 |pages=1315–21 |year=1996 |pmid=8614288 |doi= 10.1016/0024-3205(96)00097-5|url=[/tpl] so people who are taking certain types of antidepressants (such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), as well as pregnant women, may experience side effects.[tpl]cite web| title=MedlinePlus Herbs and Supplements: Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.)| accessdate=10 April 2008| publisher=National Institutes of Health| url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-ginkgo.html#Interactions[/tpl][tpl]cite web| title=Ginkgo biloba| accessdate=10 April 2008| publisher=University of Maryland Medical Center| url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/ginkgo-biloba-000247.htm[/tpl]

Ginkgo biloba preparations have shown some carcinogenic effects in animal models, but they are not classified as human carcinogens.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rider CV, Nyska A, Cora MC, et al. |title=Toxicity and Carcinogenicity Studies of Ginkgo biloba Extract in Rat and Mouse: Liver, Thyroid, and Nose Are Targets |journal=Toxicol Pathol |volume= |issue= |pages= |date=August 2013 |pmid=23960164 |doi=10.1177/0192623313501235 |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author= |title=Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of Ginkgo biloba extract (CAS No. 90045-36-6) in F344/N rats and B6C3F1/N mice (Gavage studies) |journal=Natl Toxicol Program Tech Rep Ser |volume= |issue=578 |pages=1–183 |date=March 2013 |pmid=23652021 |doi= |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Hoenerhoff MJ, Pandiri AR, Snyder SA, et al. |title=Hepatocellular carcinomas in B6C3F1 mice treated with Ginkgo biloba extract for two years differ from spontaneous liver tumors in cancer gene mutations and genomic pathways |journal=Toxicol Pathol |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=826–41 |date=August 2013 |pmid=23262642 |doi=10.1177/0192623312467520 |url=[/tpl] The lowest observed dosages that caused adverse effect in these animal studies were at 100 mg/kg, and thus dosages that are impossible to reach by the consumption of Ginkgo Biloba preparations. Aside of possible complications in combination with anti-coagulant drugs, standardized preparations of Ginkgo biloba are safe, and side effects are rare.

==Allergic precautions and contraindications to use==

Some authors claim that Ginkgo biloba extracts, which are co-administered with anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin or coumadin, increase the risk for bleeding due to their assumed antiplatelet activity. Concerns that standardized Ginkgo biloba preparations (GBE) significantly impact haemostasis or adversely affect the safety of anticoagulant drugs are however not supported by current medical literature.Bone KM (2008). Mol Nutr Food Res. 52(7):764-71. doi: 10.1002/mnfr.200700098.PMID: 18214851  
The presence of amentoflavone in G. biloba leaves would indicate a potential for interactions with many medications through the strong inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9; however, no empirical evidence supports this. Further, at recommended doses, studies have shown, "multiple-dose administration of Ginkgo biloba did not affect cytochrome P-450 2D6 or 3A4 activity in normal volunteers."Markowitz JS, Donovan JL, Lindsay DeVane C, Sipkes L, Chavin KD. Multiple-dose administration of Ginkgo biloba did not affect cytochrome P-450 2D6 or 3A4 activity in normal volunteers. J Clin Psychopharmacol. 2003 Dec;23(6):576-81. PubMed: 14624188 The concentration of amentoflavone found even in commercial ginkgo  extracts possibly is too low to be pharmacologically active.
Ginkgo biloba leaves and sarcotesta also contain ginkgolic acids,Xian-guo et al.
