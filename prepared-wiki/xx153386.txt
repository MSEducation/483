</ref>
For the next three seasons, Carpenter was a running back. He was the Lions' leading rusher and won his first world championship in 1953.
In 1954, Carpenter led Detroit with 476 rushing yards and in 1955, 543 yards. He helped the Detroit Lions Get back into the  1954 NFL Championship game, by winning the NFL Western Conference, before bowing to the 1954 NFL Champion Cleveland Browns.

Carpenter's football career was placed on hold for the 1956 season, when he was drafted by the United States Army. He served honorably during an 18-month tour in Germany.

===Cleveland Browns===

In 1957, after returning from Germany, Carpenter found himself traded to the Cleveland Browns where he played with Preston Carpenter, his brother. While with the Browns he helped them get into the 1957 NFL Championship Game, as The Browns had won the Eastern Conference with a record of 9-2-1 before  bowing to the Detroil Lions in the Title Contest world championships.
In 1957, the Browns also drafted fullback Jim Brown out of Syracuse University, who became the NFL's leading rusher with 942 yards in a 12-game regular season. Once again at the top of the division at 9 win, 2 loss and 1 tied game season, they advanced back to the Championship Game against Detroit. But the Lions dominated from start to finish, causing six turnovers and allowing the Browns' two quarterbacks (Tommy O'Connell and Milt Plum) only 95 yards passing in a 59 to 14 major loss. This was the Lions' last league championship.
On November 3, 1957, during the third quarter, Browns Vs. Redskins game, the rookie Brown had one of his good days. The big fullback Brown carried the ball  21 times with 109 yards. Brown and Lew Carpenter "shared the burden in the final time consuming march 49 yards" for the touchdown. Later in the fourth quarter, the Browns were in trouble with less than 5 minutes to play. Jim Brown carried the ball four times while Lew carried it eight times (the last six carries in a row). With a 4th down and 8 yards to go, the Browns needed a first down. Lew went "sweeping his left end behind good blocking carrying for 12 yards." The Browns had its first place title and the win of 21 to 17.[ref]
</ref>
In 1958, Jim Brown ran for 1,527 yards, almost twice as much as any other running back. In his nine seasons in the league, he crossed the 1,000 yard barrier seven times. Lew Carpenter and his brother Preston, both backs, supported Brown in his legendary time with the Cleveland Browns.
On the last winning game of the 1958 season, (December 7, 1958 a 21 to 14 win over the Eagles) during the first quarter, Brown racked up 138 yards in 21 plays. "Sharing the rushing laurels was Lew Carpenter, who picked his way for 100 yards in 21 carries. Finally the Eagles had to concentrate on the hard nosed runner from Arkansas ..."[ref]
</ref> Carpenter was now a valuable player and wanted by other teams.

===Green Bay Packers===

In 1959, Coach Vince Lombardi got a key trade by getting Lew Carpenter to come to Green Bay, Wisconsin and to play for the Packers. 
While with the Packers he helped them win two world championships.
Carpenter's first game under Lombardi came quickly. On September 27, 1959, a sellout crowd packed Green Bay's Lambeau Field for the first Packer game of the regular season against the Chicago Bears. On the Packers first offensive play, a new Lombardi technique was seen. "Packer halfback Paul Hornung took a handoff from the quarterback, ran to his left and threw the ball downfield to a wide open receiver near the goal line." The crowd jumped to its feet, cheering at this new tactic! Then, the receiver, "Lew Carpenter dropped the ball."[ref]
</ref><ref name=FirstSeason>
</ref>
At halftime in the locker room, Coach Lombardi concluded his pep talk with, "And now, men of Green Bay, step aside. Make way for the mightiest Green Bay team in years! A Winning team! Go get 'em, Green Bay!" In response,  Carpenter and the rest of the Packers slammed their lockers, growled loudly, and assaulted the field in determination. During the rest of the game, the Bears watched Carpenter closely, seeing him as a threat. The Packers adjusted tactics and used Carpenter repeatedly as bait while another player got the critical touchdown. At the end of the game, the Green Bay Packers beat the Chicago Bears by a score of 9 to 6. The Packer players raised Lombardi to their shoulders and ran with him in victory. "We're on our way Now!" shouted Lombardi.
After winning their first three games, the Packers lost the next five due to injuries, including Carpenter's. Returning, Carpenter and his team finished strong by winning the rest of the season.  The 7 win & 5 loss  record represented the Packers' first winning season since 1947.  Rookie head coach Lombardi was named Coach of the Year. For the Pack this was the start of the Glory Years.
The next year, the Packers, led by Paul Hornung's 176 points, and assisted by running back Carpenter, won the NFL West title  and played in the NFL Championship against the Philadelphia Eagles at Philadelphia. In a see saw game, the Packers trailed the Eagles by four points late in the game, when Chuck Bednarik tackled Jim Taylor just nine yards short of the goal line as time ran out. The Packers claimed that they did not "lose" that game; they were simply behind in the score when time ran out on them.
The Packers returned to the NFL Championship game the following season and faced the New York Giants in the first league title game to be played in Green Bay. The Packers scored 24 second-quarter points assisted by Carpenter, including a championship-record 19 by Paul Hornung, on special loan from the Army (one touchdown, four extra-points and three field goals), powering the Packers to a 37 to 0 major win over the Giants, their first NFL Championship since 1944.http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/16/sports/football/16giants.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&th&emc=th NYTimes article of January 15, 2008. Time cover show Lombardi & a row of Packers.
The Packers stormed back in the 1962 season, jumping out to a 10 win & 0 loss start, on their way to a 13 wins & 1 loss season. This consistent level of success would lead to Lombardi's Packers becoming one of the most prominent teams of their era, and even to their being featured as the face of the NFL on the cover of Time on December 21, 1962, as part of the magazine's cover story on "The Sport of the '60s" and Lew Carpenter is mentioned in the article as one of the Packer's star players.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19621221,00.html | work=Time | accessdate=May 4, 2010[/tpl] Carpenter cited & full article Shortly after Time's article, the Packers faced the Giants in a much more brutal championship game than the previous year, but the Packers prevailed on the surprising foot of Jerry Kramer and the determined running of Jim Taylor. The Packers defeated the Giants in New York, 16 to 7. Carpenter re-injured himself but finished the game. During this season Carpenter assisted other players in their game, gaining the informal title of "coach."
In 1963, Paul Hournung was suspended for the season for betting on football. This caused Carpenter and others to make more than extra efforts for the team.[ref]
</ref>  While the Packers had a respectful 11 win and 1 loss season, it was at great cost. Many players injured themselves and re-injured themselves like Carpenter. This season was a frustration for Carpenter for he played his heart and body to the point of exhaustion. Coach Lombardi placed Carpenter as a reserve running back, but had to play him time after time for the winning effort. After four full seasons of play with the Packers, Carpenter concluded his professional football playing days at the end of the 1963 season.<ref name=GreenBay/>
Carpenter played 123 professional football games, He finished his 10 year career with 2,025 yards and 16 touchdowns on 468 carries. He also caught 87 passes for 782 yards.

Poor personnel decisions typified this Packer time period. A notorious example includes the 1974 trade in which Dan Devine (HC 1971â1974) acting as GM sent five 1975 and 1976 draft picks (two first-rounders, two second-rounders and a third rounder) to the Los Angeles Rams for aging quarterback John Hadl, who would spend only 1Â½ seasons in Green Bay.Worst Trade ... Ever from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website. Accessed December 5, 2010  This continued in the 1989, when players such as Barry Sanders, Deion Sanders, and Derrick Thomas were available, but the Packers chose offensive lineman Tony Mandarich with the second overall pick in the NFL draft. Though rated highly by nearly every professional scout at the time, Mandarich's performance failed to meet expectations. ESPN has rated Mandarich as the third "biggest sports flop" in the last 25 years.The 25 Biggest Sports Flops (1979â2004) from ESPN25. Obtained  November 22, 2010. This must have been a frustrating time for Carpenter but he focused on the basics and coached on for his beloved Packers.
