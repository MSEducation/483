For some unfathomable reason, many clam shacks and restaurants serve clarified butter... as drawn butter.

==Drawn butter sauces==

In the 18th century, a small amount of flour and water or milk was often added to melted butter to thicken it and prevent it from separating. Later in the 19th century, increasing amounts of flour and water were used. These sauces may themselves be named simply "melted butter", "drawn butter", or "drawn butter sauce", and flavored with vinegar, salt, pepper, capers, nasturtiums[tpl]dn|date=November 2013[/tpl], and so on.Marian Cole Fisher, Twenty lessons in domestic science : a condensed home study course : marketing, food principals sic, functions of food, methods of cooking, glossary of usual culinary terms, pronunciations and definitions, etc., 1916, p. 89J.
