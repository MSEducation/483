The List of Australian Football League pre-season and night series premiers is a complete chronological listing of the winners of the Victorian Football League (VFL) and Australian Football League (AFL) pre-season and night series competitions. 
From 1956 to 1971, the night series was a consolation knock-out competition held in September at the Lake Oval in Albert Park amongst the eight teams who failed to reach the finals in the VFL premiership season, apart from 1957, when all twelve teams competed.[tpl]cite book|last=Taylor|first=Kevin|title=Inside Football Footystats|publisher=ACP Action|location=Oakleigh, Victoria|year=2000|isbn=0-646-37926-7|page=76[/tpl]  
There were no official VFL night series held during the 1972 to 1976 seasons, however in 1976 the National Football League (the national governing body at the time) held their own night series mid-week during the season, known as the NFL Wills Cup.  In 1977, the VFL revived their own night series, also held mid-week during the season and televised on Channel 7 to rival the NFL series that was shown on Channel 10.[tpl]cite book|editor=Ross, John|title=100 years of Australian football|publisher=Penguin Books|location=Ringwood, Victoria|year=1997|isbn=0-14-026969-X|page=277[/tpl]  Whilst the 1977 series only featured the twelve VFL teams, between 1978 and 1986 a selection of teams from the SANFL, WAFL and representative teams from Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania also competed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/night_series_grand_finals.htm#13%20in%201978|title=VFL & AFL Night Series & Pre-season Grand Finals|last=Devaney|first=John|accessdate=12 October 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110514094301/http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/night_series_grand_finals.htm|archivedate=14 May 2011[/tpl]
With the national expansion of the VFL to include teams from Western Australia and Queensland the 1987 series was restricted to only the 14 VFL teams and commenced during the pre-season period, but was completed mid-week between rounds 5 and 6 of the 1987 VFL season.[tpl]cite book|author=Poat, Peter & East, Alan|title=Football Register|publisher=Westralian Publishers|location=Applecross, Western Australia|year=1987|edition=25th Edition|pages=103, 117[/tpl]
From 1988 onwards, the competition was played in its entirety before the premiership season began and is competed for by only the VFL or AFL teams (the VFL was renamed the AFL in 1990).

From 2003 onwards, the pre-season cup competition has had a modified scoring system (not the usual scoring system that is used in the premiership season), that includes awarding 9 points for Super Goals that are kicked from outside the 50m arc and 3 points for rushed behinds.

==Double premiership teams==

The double premiership of winning both the night/pre-season and main premiership competitions has been achieved on seven occasions, by three clubs.  In 2007, the AFL announced that if a club won both titles, they would win a $1 million bonus.AFL glory equals $1m bonus  The offer was not extended past that season, so neither St Kilda, who won the 2008 NAB Cup and made the preliminary final of the 2008 AFL season$1 million finals bonus off the table for St Kilda nor Geelong, who achieved the double in 2009 were eligible for the extra prizemoney.
Three teams have won the pre-season premiership immediately after winning the main season premiership.  Carlton won the main VFL Premiership in 1982 and back up with a night premiership in 1983.  Hawthorn won the AFL Premiership in 1991, then backed the following year to win the pre-season competition in 1992.  Collingwood won the 2010 AFL Grand Final and then also won the 2011 NAB Cup.
