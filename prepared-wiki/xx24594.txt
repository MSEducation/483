[[Ter (river)]]

CATEGORIES: Rivers of Catalonia

The Ter is a river in Catalonia (northeastern of the Iberian Peninsula) that rises in Ulldeter at an approximate altitude of 2400 meters, at the foot of a glacial cirque delimited by the nearby peaks of el Bastiments, el Gra de Fajol, or el Pic de la Dona. It runs through the comarques of Ripollès, Osona, Selva, Gironès, and Baix Empordà, discharging into the Mediterranean Sea at l'Estartit. The Ter follows a course of 208 kilometers and drains an area of approximately 3010 km2; its basin is described by a dendritic and exorheic drainage pattern. Annually, an average of 840 hm3 of water is moved by the river, with an average flow rate of 25 m3/s at its mouth. Although its headwaters are in the Pyrenees, the Ter receives significant inflow from rivers in the middle and lower plains. Thus it is susceptible to flooding in both the spring and the autumn.
