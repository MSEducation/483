Patnitop[/tpl]
The name 'Patnitop' is a distortion of the original name of the place, "Patan Da Talab" meaning "Pond of the Princess". In olden times a pond existed in the meadows and a certain princess often used to bathe there. Some part of the pond still exists near the local youth hostel. It may be the case that the British had difficulties recording the Indian name correctly in their revenue records. Hence, over the years the name has changed from "Patan Da Talab" to Patnitop.

==Location==

Patnitop is located in the Lower Himalayan Range close to the Pir Panjal range, [tpl]convert|47|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from Udhampur and [tpl]convert|112|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from Jammu. This famous hill resort is perched on a beautiful plateau, at an altitude of 2024 m across which the Jammu-Srinagar Highway passes. The towns of  Kud and Batote are nearby.  Kud is a very small town where sweet shops make fresh Patissa (a sweet).  It may be bought hot and melts in one's mouth.
Batote is known as a place for quality rajma or the kidney bean.

==Details==

Enveloped by thickly wooded Cedar/Deodhar forests, Patnitop offers beautiful picnic spots, peaceful walks and breathtaking views of the mountainscape of the Chenab basin.  In winter, the resort is generally covered with a thick mantle of snow thus providing opportunities for various snow games including skiing.  It is the closest winter resort to Jammu and to Udhampur and is second to none in its natural charm, climate, pine forests and lush green cover.  J&K Tourism as well as the army have some holiday homes here.

One can enjoy the thrill of flying, at Patnitop. The paragliding joyrides rides are conducted at Dawariyai, [tpl]convert|2|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] landmark, on the Patnitop-Sanasar road. One can ask for paragliding at the Patnitop Development Authority (PDA) barrier.
The takeoff site is at Dawariyai, on the Patnitop-Sanasar road. The area often called as the Billoo Di Powri point.

==Patnitop bypass road tunnel==

Snowfall and avalanche in winter at Patnitop obstructs National Highway 1A a few times every winter and causes long queues of vehicles - sometimes for days at length. India's longest road tunnel, the [tpl]convert|9.2|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] long Chenani-Nashri Tunnel or Patnitop Tunnel is being constructed starting from about [tpl]convert|2|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from Chenani town south of Patnitop to Nashri village north of Patnitop to reduce the distance from Jammu to Srinagar and reduce traffic jams on NH-1A that occur due to snowfall and avalanche in winter at Patnitop.http://www.constructionweekonline.in/article-7845-chenani_nashri_tunnel_completes_2_kms_excavation
The Southern portal (end) of the tunnel is at coordinates 33.0463°N  75.2793°E and the Northern portal (end) of the tunnel is at coordinates 33.1285°N  75.2928°E. When the tunnel is completed, the highway will no longer pass through Patnitop. The tunnel will reduce the length of the highway by [tpl]convert|31|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and the highway will bypass Patnitop. About [tpl]convert|2|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of the tunnel had been excavated by April 2012 and about 50% of the length had been excavated by January 2013.http://www.tribuneindia.com/2013/20130205/j&k.htm
