The Irish Examiner, formerly The Cork Examiner and then The Examiner, is an Irish national daily newspaper which primarily circulates in the Munster region surrounding its base in Cork, though it is available throughout the country. Its main national rivals are The Irish Times, and the Irish Independent.

==History==

The paper was founded by John Francis Maguire under the title The Cork Examiner in 1841 in support of the Catholic Emancipation and tenant rights work of Daniel O'Connell.Ireland in the Nineteenth Century by Leon Litvack, Glenn Hooper.Four Courts Press, 2000.(pg.38)
During the Spanish Civil War, the Cork Examiner took a strongly pro-Franco tone in its coverage of the conflict."After the war, Bishop Fogarty of Killaloe complained that only the Irish Independent and the Cork Examiner had given Franco "unflinching and unequivocal support"". Fearghal McGarry, "Irish Newspapers and the Spanish Civil War", Irish Historical Studies, Vol. 33, No. 129 (May, 2002), p. 83
Though originally appearing under The Cork Examiner title, it has re-branded in recent years to The Examiner, and subsequently The Irish Examiner to appeal to a more national readership.
The newspaper was part of the Thomas Crosbie Holdings group.
