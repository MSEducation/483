Puma pardoides or Owen's panther is an extinct prehistoric cat, long regarded as a primitive species of leopard (genus Panthera). Recent workHemmer, H., Kahlike, R.-D. & Vekua, A. K. (2004). The Old World puma Puma pardoides (Owen, 1846) (Carnivora: Felidae) in the Lower Villafranchian (Upper Pliocene) of Kvabebi (East Georgia, Transcaucasia) and its evolutionary and biogeographical significance. Neues Jahrbuch fur Geologie und Palaontologie, Abhandlungen 233, 197-233. has shown that Panthera pardoides is actually the same species as Panthera schaubi, which is probably not a pantherine at all, but more properly classified as Puma pardoides.

Panthera schaubi or Viretailurus schaubi was historically often regarded as a basal member of the genus Panthera.A. Turner: The big cats and their fossil relatives. Columbia University Press, 1997.

(2004). The Old World puma Puma pardoides (Owen, 1846) (Carnivora: Felidae) in the Lower Villafranchian (Upper Pliocene) of Kvabebi (East Georgia, Transcaucasia) and its evolutionary and biogeographical significance. Neues Jahrbuch fur Geologie und Palaontologie, Abhandlungen 233, 197-233. has shown that Viretailurus should actually be included in the genus Puma as a junior synonym of Puma pardoides. Fossils of this leopard-sized animal are around 2 million years old and were found in France.
