Adam Thorn (born Adam Gabriel Thorn, December 16, 1979, in Waldorf, Maryland) spent 1998â€“2005 as front man and lyricist for Greensboro, North Carolina indie punk band Kudzu Wish. After bowing out at the top of their game, Thorn started the short lived Warbomb!, was employed as an assistant brewmaster, and then began crafting the music for his solo debut. Upon the release of "Where's The Freedom?" in 2007 Adam Thorn & The Top Buttons, a backing band of rotating members, played sporadic shows culminating in a performance in Greensboro, NC on December 16, 2007. Thorn vanished from the public eye following a severe car accident early in 2008 and has not been seen or heard from since. 
There are unconfirmed rumors of a man resembling Thorn being sighted around the Greensboro area in 2010 sporting either a Nehru jacket or some sort of Indian headdress.  Most of these claims have been dismissed as either hoax or collective dreaming.
