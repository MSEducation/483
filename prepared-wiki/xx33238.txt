[[Miming]]

CATEGORIES: People in Norse mythology and legends

In Norse mythology, Miming was a forest-dwelling troll, the son of Hothbrod and foster son of Gevar.  In a Teutonic version of the myth of the death of Balder, Miming's sword is the weapon that Hodur uses to slay Balder; here, Hodur is not blind but is instead a physically potent figure.  Miming's sword was said to have been forged by Weyland, the god of smithing, for his son Heime.
