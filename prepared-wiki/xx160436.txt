Holland was an American heavy metal band that formed in Chicago, Illinois in 1984.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=90179 |title=Holland (US) |publisher=Encyclopaedia Metallum |accessdate=2008-05-29 [/tpl] The short-lived band comprised vocalist Tommy Holland, guitarist Michael Angelo Batio, bassist Joey Cetner and drummer Brad Rohrssen.

==History==

Holland was a member of Steppenwolf for a short period between 1979 and 1980, and recruited Batio (then still a session musician) to form his own band in 1984. Shortly after releasing Little Monsters in 1985, the band split up and members concentrated on other projects. Brad Rohrssen went on to play drums and record with Kevin Lee and the Lonesome City Kings.
In 1998 a compilation album, Wake Up the Neighbourhood, was released, which featured songs from the Little Monsters sessions, including five which appeared on the album itself and five other previously unreleased tracks. Shortly after the initial pressing, another track from those sessions, "Nobody Else" was added as a bonus track.

==Popular culture==

The song "Wake Up The Neighbourhood" was featured on the official soundtrack for the film Girls Just Want to Have Fun starring Shannen Doherty, Sarah Jessica Parker and Helen Hunt.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089208/soundtrack |title=Girls Just Want to Have Fun (1985) - Soundtracks |accessdate=2008-11-07 |publisher=Internet Movie Database [/tpl]
