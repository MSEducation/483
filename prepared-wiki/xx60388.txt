==History==

Albuquerque in the 1930s was served by two private airports, West Mesa Airport and Oxnard Field. Around 1935 it was suggested that the city build a new public airport using WPA money. Having secured $520,500 USD in funding, Governor Clyde Tingley broke ground for the project on February 28, 1937. Albuquerque Municipal Airport opened in 1939 with two paved runways, a Pueblo Style terminal building designed by Ernest Blumenthal, and a massive hangar designed to accommodate the new Boeing 307.Biebel, Charles D.

The April 1957 OAG shows 31 weekday departures: 13 on Continental, 12 TWA and 6 Frontier.
The present terminal was designed by William E. Burk Jr.[tpl]cite book |last1=Price|first1=Vincent Barrett|title=A City At the End of the World|year=1992|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|isbn=0-82631-371-X|page=36[/tpl] and built in 1965 just east of the original terminal. It has been expanded twice, in 1989, which was designed by Phillip Jacobson and BPLW Associates and in 1996. The old terminal has been restored and houses offices of the Transportation Security Administration. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

===Military facilities and operations===

The Sunport began a new role in 1940 when it was designated Albuquerque Army Air Base, the precursor to today's Kirtland Air Force Base. The airport continues to share its runways with Kirtland AFB, which also handles rescue and firefighting operations.  An Air Force Material Command (AFMC) installation, the host unit is the 377th Air Base Wing (377 ABW).  Flying units at Kirtland AFB consist of the 58th Special Operations Wing (58 SOW) of the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) and the 150th Fighter Wing (150 FW), an Air Combat Command (ACC)-gained unit of the New Mexico Air National Guard.

===Future developments===

The Airport Master Plan drafted in 2002 lays out intermediate- and long-term projects at the Sunport, including the removal of Runway 17/35 and the construction of a second terminal when traffic demands it. The runway closure recommendation is based on safety, noise abatement and the cost of upkeep. Because 17/35 intersects all three of the other runways it has the highest risk of runway incursions and air traffic control prefers not to use it. Wind is usually from the east, and even during strong winds the other runways can cover departure and landing. Currently, most of the runway's use is general aviation.
In the longer term, the plan calls for a new terminal to be built to the northeast of the existing terminal. A people mover system will connect the terminal with parking facilities and the existing terminal.[tpl]cite web | title=Executive Summary | url=http://www.cabq.gov/airport/documents/MP_Summary1.pdf|work=Albuquerque International Sunport Airport Master Plan | accessdate=August 14, 2010[/tpl]

The largest passenger aircraft scheduled into Albuquerque is the Boeing 757, operated by Delta Air Lines on flights from Atlanta during spring and summer.  The largest aircraft the Sunport usually sees is a UPS Airbus A300 to Louisville and Ontario. Years ago the airport had scheduled Trans World Airlines Lockheed L-1011s.
More recent data from the FAA shows the annual operations from 2005–2009:
2005: 196,699; 2006: 192,241; 2007: 190,780; 2008: 180,553; 2009: 158,529Air Traffic Activity System http://aspm.faa.gov/opsnet/sys/opsnet-server-x.asp
