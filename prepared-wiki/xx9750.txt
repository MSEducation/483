Patti had a strong religious upbringing and a Bible education, but left organized religion as a teenager because she felt it was too confining; much later, she wrote the line "Jesus died for somebody's sins, but not mine" in her cover version of Them's "Gloria" in response to this experience.[tpl]cite web|url=http://spinner.aol.com/rockhall/patti-smith-2007-inductee/interview|title=Exclusive Interview with Patti Smith|accessdate=2008-02-04|author=Robertson, Jessica|work=Spinner|publisher=AOL|year=2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl] She has described having an avid interest in Tibetan Buddhism around the age of eleven or twelve, saying "I fell in love with Tibet because their essential mission was to keep a continual stream of prayer," but that as an adult she sees clear parallels between different forms of religion, and has come to the conclusion that religious dogmas are "...man-made laws that you can either decide to abide by or not."Moore, Thurston, “Patti Smith”, BOMB Magazine Winter, 1996. Retrieved 2012-07-18. At this early age Smith was exposed to her first records, including Shrimp Boats by Harry Belafonte, Patience and Prudence doing The Money Tree, and Another Side of Bob Dylan, which her mother gave to her. Smith graduated from Deptford Township High School in 1964 and went to work in a factory.Smith, Patti (2010). Just Kids'', p. 20. HarperCollins, New York. ISBN 978-0-06-621131-2. She gave birth to her first child, a daughter, on April 26, 1967, and chose to place her for adoption.

===1967–1973: New York===

In 1967, she left Glassboro State College (now Rowan University) and moved to New York City. She met photographer Robert Mapplethorpe there while working at a book store with a friend, poet Janet Hamill. She and Mapplethorpe had an intense romantic relationship, which was tumultuous as the pair struggled with times of poverty, and Mapplethorpe with his own sexuality. Smith considers Mapplethorpe to be one of the most important people in her life, and in her book Just Kids refers to him as "the artist of my life". Mapplethorpe's photographs of her became the covers for the Patti Smith Group LPs, and they remained friends until Mapplethorpe's death in 1989.[tpl]cite interview|last= Smith |first= Patti |title= A conversation with singer Patti Smith |url= http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/5297 |format= Video |program= Charlie Rose |callsign= WNET |city= New York |date= 1997-10-17 |accessdate= 2011-01-12 |archiveurl= |archivedate= [/tpl] In 1969 she went to Paris with her sister and started busking and doing performance art. When Smith returned to New York City, she lived in the Hotel Chelsea with Mapplethorpe; they frequented Max's Kansas City and CBGB. Smith provided the spoken word soundtrack for Sandy Daley's art film Robert Having His Nipple Pierced, starring Mapplethorpe. The same year Smith appeared with Wayne County in Jackie Curtis's play Femme Fatale. As a member of the St. Mark's Poetry Project, she spent the early 1970s painting, writing, and performing. In 1971 she performed – for one night only – in Cowboy Mouth,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pattismith/biography |title=Patti Smith: Biography |accessdate=2008-02-04 |work=The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll |publisher=Rolling Stone |year=2001 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071212083500/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pattismith/biography  |archivedate=2007-12-12[/tpl] a play that she co-wrote with Sam Shepard. (The published play's notes call for "a man who looks like a coyote and a woman who looks like a crow".)  She wrote several poems, "for sam shepard""for sam shepard," in Creem Sept. 1971 link and "Sam Shepard: 9 Random Years (7 + 2)"included in Angel City, Curse of the Starving Class & Other Plays (1976), (bibliographic information) about her relationship with Shepard.
Smith was briefly considered for the lead singer position in Blue Öyster Cult. She contributed lyrics to several of the band's songs, including "Debbie Denise" (inspired by her poem "In Remembrance of Debbie Denise"), "Baby Ice Dog", "Career of Evil", "Fire of Unknown Origin", "The Revenge of Vera Gemini" (on which she performs duet vocals), and "Shooting Shark". She was romantically involved at the time with the band's keyboardist, Allen Lanier. During these years, Smith also wrote rock journalism, some of which was published in Rolling Stone and Creem.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?fid1=25407 |title=Patti Smith Fights the Good Fight - Timeline |accessdate=2008-12-05 |last=Khanna |first=Vish |date=May 2007 |publisher=Exclaim! |location=Canada[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl]

===1974–1979: Patti Smith Group===

By 1974, Patti Smith was performing rock music herself, initially with guitarist, bassist and rock archivist Lenny Kaye, and later with a full band comprising Kaye, Ivan Kral on guitar and bass, Jay Dee Daugherty on drums and Richard Sohl on piano. Ivan Kral was a refugee from Czechoslovakia, fleeing in 1968 after the fall of Alexander Dubček. Financed by Sam Wagstaff, the band recorded a first single, "Hey Joe / Piss Factory", in 1974. The A-side was a version of the rock standard with the addition of a spoken word piece about fugitive heiress Patty Hearst ("Patty Hearst, you're standing there in front of the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread, I was wondering were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women...").[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oceanstar.com/patti/lyrics/heyjoe.htm |title=Hey Joe lyrics |accessdate=2008-02-04[/tpl] The B-side describes the helpless anger Smith had felt while working on a factory assembly line and the salvation she discovered in the form of a shoplifted book, the 19th century French poet Arthur Rimbaud's Illuminations. In a 1996 interview which discusses artistic influences during her young years, Smith said, "I had devoted so much of my girlish daydreams to Rimbaud. Rimbaud was like my boyfriend."

Later that same year, she performed spoken poetry on "I Wake Up Screaming" from Ray Manzarek's The Whole Thing Started with Rock & Roll Now It's Out of Control album.
The Patti Smith Group was signed by Clive Davis of Arista Records, and in 1975 recorded their first album, Horses, produced by John Cale amid some tension. The album fused punk rock and spoken poetry and begins with a cover of Van Morrison's "Gloria", and Smith's opening words: "Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine" (an excerpt from "Oath," one of her early poems). The austere cover photograph by Mapplethorpe has become one of rock's classic images.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.superseventies.com/greatestalbumcovers.html |title=Seventies' Greatest Album Covers |accessdate=2008-02-04 |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1991-11-14[/tpl] As the popularity of punk rock grew, Patti Smith Group toured the United States and Europe. The rawer sound of the group's second album, Radio Ethiopia, reflected this. Considerably less accessible than Horses, Radio Ethiopia initially received poor reviews. However, several of its songs have stood the test of time, and Smith still performs them regularly in concert.[tpl]cite web |url=http://setlists.pattismithlogbook.info/years/2007.html |title=Patti Smith setlists, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-07[/tpl] She has said that Radio Ethiopia was influenced by  the band MC5.
On January 23, 1977, while touring in support of Radio Ethiopia, Smith accidentally danced off a high stage in Tampa, Florida, and fell 15 feet into a concrete orchestra pit, breaking several neck vertebrae.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pattismithlogbook.info/logbook/chronology/1977/19770123.htm |title=Patti Smith chronology |accessdate=2008-02-04[/tpl] The injury required a period of rest and an intensive round of physical therapy, during which time she was able to reassess, re-energize and reorganize her life. Patti Smith Group produced two further albums before the end of the 1970s. Easter (1978) was her most commercially successful record, containing the single "Because the Night" co-written with Bruce Springsteen. Wave (1979) was less successful, although the songs "Frederick" and "Dancing Barefoot" both received commercial airplay.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pattismithland.com/sotw.htm |title=Song of the Week: Dancing Barefoot |accessdate=2008-02-26 |author=Smith, Patti |year=2002|archivedate=2008-01-12|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080112181302/http://www.pattismithland.com/sotw.htm[/tpl]

===1980–1995: Marriage===

Before the release of Wave, Smith, now separated from long-time partner Allen Lanier, met Fred "Sonic" Smith, former guitar player for Detroit rock band MC5 and his own Sonic's Rendezvous Band, who adored poetry as much as she did. (Wave's "Dancing Barefoot" and "Frederick" were both dedicated to him.)[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=song|id=t830026|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Dancing Barefoot |accessdate=2008-02-07 |author=Deming, Mark |publisher=Allmusic[/tpl] The running joke at the time was that she married Fred only because she would not have to change her name.[tpl]cite web |url=http://babellist.xnet2.com/9903/msg00195.html |title=Babel-list |accessdate=2008-02-07 |year=1999[/tpl] They had a son, Jackson (b. 1982) who would go on to marry The White Stripes drummer, Meg White in 2009;[tpl]cite web | title = Meg White and Jackson Smith wed in Nashville | url = http://seattletimes.com/html/entertainment/2009264040_apusmusicmegwhite.html | work = The Seattle Times | publisher = seattletimes.com | date = 2009-05-26 | accessdate = 2012-10-19[/tpl] and a daughter, Jesse (b. 1987). Through most of the 1980s Patti Smith was in semi-retirement from music, living with her family north of Detroit in St. Clair Shores, Michigan. In June 1988, she released the album Dream of Life, which included the song "People Have the Power". Fred Smith died on November 4, 1994, of a heart attack. Shortly afterward, Patti faced the unexpected death of her brother Todd and original keyboard player Richard Sohl. When her son Jackson turned 14, Smith decided to move back to New York. After the impact of these deaths, her friends Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Allen Ginsberg (whom she had known since her early years in New York) urged her to go back out on the road. She toured briefly with Bob Dylan in December 1995 (chronicled in a book of photographs by Stipe).

===1996–2003: Re-emergence===

In 1996, Smith worked with her long-time colleagues to record Gone Again, featuring "About a Boy", a tribute to Kurt Cobain. That same year she collaborated with Stipe on "E-Bow the Letter", a song on R.E.M.'s New Adventures in Hi-Fi, which she has also performed live with the band.[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r240302|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=New Adventures in Hi-Fi |accessdate=2008-02-07 |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |publisher=Allmusic[/tpl] After release of Gone Again, Patti Smith recorded two new albums:  Peace and Noise in 1997 (with the single "1959", about the invasion of Tibet) and Gung Ho in 2000 (with songs about Ho Chi Minh and Smith's late father). Songs "1959" and "Glitter in Their Eyes" were nominated for Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/grammy/rockfemale.htm |title=Grammy Awards: Best Rock Vocal Performance - Female |accessdate=2008-03-06[/tpl] A box set of her work up to that time, The Patti Smith Masters, came out in 1996, and 2002 saw the release of Land (1975–2002), a two-CD compilation that includes a memorable cover of Prince's "When Doves Cry". Smith's solo art exhibition Strange Messenger was hosted at The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh on September 28, 2002.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.warhol.org/whats_on/pdfs/PR_Patti_Smith.pdf |title=The Andy Warhol Museum Announces Patti Smith Performance and Retrospective Exhibition |accessdate=2008-03-19 |date=2002-05-03 |format=PDF |publisher=The Andy Warhol Museum |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061231060409/http://www.warhol.org/whats_on/pdfs/PR_Patti_Smith.pdf |archivedate = December 31, 2006[/tpl]

===2004–present===

On April 27, 2004, Patti Smith released Trampin' which included several songs about motherhood, partly in tribute to Smith's mother, who had died two years before. It was her first album on Columbia Records, soon to become a sister label to her previous home Arista Records. Smith curated the Meltdown festival in London on June 25, 2005, the penultimate event being the first live performance of Horses in its entirety.[tpl]cite news |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/fridayreview/story/0,,1497477,00.html |title=Some give a song.

This live performance was released later in the year as Horses/Horses.
On July 10, 2005, Smith was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. In addition to Smith's influence on rock music, the Minister also noted her appreciation of Arthur Rimbaud. In August 2005, Smith gave a literary lecture about the poems of Arthur Rimbaud and William Blake. On October 15, 2006, Patti Smith performed at the CBGB nightclub, with a 3½-hour tour de force to close out Manhattan's music venue. She took the stage at 9:30 p.m. (EDT) and closed for the night (and forever for the venue) at a few minutes after 1:00 a.m., performing her song "Elegie", and finally reading a list of punk rock musicians and advocates who had died in the previous years.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/16/arts/music/16cnd-cbgbnotebook.html?ei=5088&en=b87ef3abc56fb771&ex=1318651200&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=all |title=Fans of a Groundbreaking Club Mourn and Then Move On |accessdate=2008-02-04 |author=Pareles, Jon |publisher=The New York Times |date=2006-10-16[/tpl]

Smith was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 12, 2007. She dedicated her award to the memory of her late husband, Fred, and gave a performance of The Rolling Stones staple "Gimme Shelter". As the closing number of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, Smith's "People Have the Power" was used for the big celebrity jam that always ends the program.[tpl]cite web |url=http://spinner.aol.com/rockhall/2007-induction-ceremony |title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2007 Induction |accessdate=2008-02-04 |publisher=Spinner |year=2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl]

Patti Smith's newest album, Banga (Believe or explode), was released in early June 2012 with critical acclaim. Music Journalist Hal Horowitz wrote : "These songs aren’t as loud or frantic as those of her late 70s heyday, but they resonate just as boldly as she moans, chants, speaks and spits out lyrics with the grace and determination of Mohammad Ali in his prime. It’s not an easy listen—the vast majority of her music never has been—but if you’re a fan and/or prepared for the challenge, this is as potent, heady and uncompromising as she has ever gotten, and with Smith’s storied history as a musical maverick, that’s saying plenty."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/06/patti-smith-banga/|title=Patti Smith: Banga|publisher=American Songwriter|accessdate=8 June 2012[/tpl] Overall, she has stayed true to her style of blending rock and poetry.
