Eros  ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪr|ɒ|s[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛr|ɒ|s[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-grc|ἔρως[/tpl] érōs "love, mostly of the sexual passion") is one of the four words in Ancient Greek which can be rendered into English as “love”. The other three are storge, philia and agape. Eros refers to “intimate love” or romantic love; storge to familial love; philia to friendship as a kind of love; and agape refers to “selfless love”, or “charity” as it is translated in the Christian scriptures (from the Latin caritas, dearness).C.S. Lewis, The Four Loves 
The term erotic is derived from eros. Eros has also been used in philosophy and psychology in a much wider sense, almost as an equivalent to "life energy".
