In the same year the site was adding 15 million new users each month."Home porn gives industry the blues", guardian.co.uk, December 16, 2007. Retrieved March 4, 2009.

Some of the main rivals of YouPorn are Xtube, Redtube, Pornhub etc.
Porn 2.0 sites such as these are seen as posing notable competition for paid pornographic websites and traditional magazine and DVD-based pornography.Purveyors of porn scramble to keep up with Internet, USA Today, June 5, 2007YouTube with fewer clothes, The Times, June 19, 2007

==Criticism and praise==

YouPorn consumes more than three terabytes of bandwidth each day, which has caused the site to go down at times due to the sheer volume of users and the large file size of the videos. When the online version of a German newspaper reported on YouPorn in November 2006, the site could not deal with the traffic surge, went down temporarily, and asked its users for an unmetered service provider in Europe.Bild.de verursacht Pornowelle, November 15, 2006.

Concerns have also surfaced over the inability to verify the age of the persons depicted in the videos, the possibility of copyrighted videos being uploaded to the site, and the possibility of privacy violations when private sex tapes are uploaded without the consent of all involved parties. In 2007 Vivid Entertainment took legal action against YouPorn, claiming that the streaming of copyrighted material was depriving it of revenue.
YouPorn has been called "a good role model for the sexually naive", as many of its homemade videos depict amateur couples having ordinary sex (known as "Amateur"), as opposed to the often unreal scenarios of commercial porn.A good role model for the sexually naive, The Times, September 24, 2007
Court papers filed by a class action law firm, Fears and Nachawati, in the Central District of California show that that on December 6, 2010 two men filed a class action lawsuit against Netherlands-based Midstream Media N.V., owners of YouPorn, claiming the company’s sites use “history-sniffing” technology to hijack users’ personal information.

===Germany===

German law does not allow hardcore pornography without an effective age verification system, and the German Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien (Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons) placed YouPorn on its index. As a result, since April 2007, the German site of the Google search engine (google.de) classified YouPorn.com as a hardcore pornography websiteSearch results for "youporn" on google.de delivering many comments from blogs and replaced it with a link to Chilling Effects, claiming that a "German regulatory body reported illegal material".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chillingeffects.org/notice.cgi?sID=815 |title=German regulatory body reported illegal material — Chilling Effects Clearinghouse |publisher=Chillingeffects.org |accessdate=December 8, 2010[/tpl]
