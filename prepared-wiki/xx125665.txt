HMS ''Veronica was an Acacia-class sloop of the Royal Navy, built by Dunlop Bremner & Company, Port Glasgow. She was laid down in January 1915, launched on 27 May 1915 and completed in August 1915. The Acacia''-class fleet sweeping sloops were adapted for escort work, minesweeping and as Q-ships. 

==New Zealand service==

She was in the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy from 19 September 1920 to 24 February 1934, where she exercised with cruisers, toured New Zealand ports, took part in ceremonial occasions, and went on annual Pacific Island cruises. This was in conjunction with her sister ship [tpl]HMS|Laburnum|1915|2[/tpl] which was similar, but with small differences as they came from different commercial shipyards.   

==Hawke's Bay earthquake==

HMS Veronica assisted survivors in the aftermath of the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake in New Zealand. Having berthed in Port Ahuriri only three hours before the earthquake, she radioed Auckland for help, which was provided by the cruisers [tpl]HMS|Dunedin|D93|2[/tpl] and [tpl]HMS|Diomede|D92|2[/tpl]. She was subsequently docked for inspection for possible bottom damage as the seabed had risen up under her. 

==Fate==

She left Auckland on 24 February 1934 for paying off at Chatham. She was sold on 22 February 1935 to John Cashmore Ltd, and broken up at Newport, Wales, in 1935.
A memorial to HMS Veronica was built on Napier's Marine Parade, commemorating its efforts after the city's earthquake.
