Darlaston railway station was a station built on the South Staffordshire Line in 1863. It served the town of Darlaston, and was located to the east of the town centre, on Walsall Road.  It was one of two railway stations that served the town.  The other, Darlaston James Bridge, was located on the Walsall to Wolverhampton Line and became known as Darlaston after the closure of this station.
The station closed in 1887, and there is little evidence of the its existence at the site, although the former trackbed is in use as a footpath.
