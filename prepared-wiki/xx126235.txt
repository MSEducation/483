==History==

Mael Mórdha was formed in January 1998 by Roibéard Ó Bogail (formerly the vocalist of the band Dreamsfear). On the strength of the band’s last two EPs, Caoineadh na nGael and Cluain Tarbh, the band was signed to Dutch label Karmageddon Media which released the band’s first album, Cluain Tarbh on 12 September 2005. An alternative recording of the album title track was released on a limited edition 7 inch vinyl split with their fellow Irishmen Primordial, through Sentinel Records in the winter of 2005.
Due to severe internal problems within Karmageddon and a lack of availability of the album, the band left the label and signed to Grau Records in Germany in February 2006. Gaeltacht Mael Mórdha is the band's first album to be released through Grau Records, on 19 March 2007. In 2008 their debut album was re-released by Grau Records with two additional tracks previously recorded on the band's first EP, The Path to Insanity.
The band has played the Abbeyleix Metalfest (Éire - 1999), Day Of Darkness (Éire - 2003, 2004, 2007), Bloodstock (England - 2006), Heathen Crusade II (Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA- 2007), Doom Shall Rise, (Göppingen, Germany - 2007) and Dutch Doom Days (Rotterdam, The Netherlands - 2007).
The band entered the Irish leg of the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 in late 2004 with the aim of entering the finals held in Kiev, Ukraine in 2005.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGjVhvwDkp0 |title=Mael Mórdha performing on You're A Star [/tpl]
