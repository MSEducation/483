[[Gas-pak]]

CATEGORIES: Microbiology equipment

Gas-pak is a method used in production of an anaerobic environment. It is used to culture bacteria which die or fail to grow in presence of oxygen (anaerobes). 
There are commercially available, use-and-throw sachets containing a dry powder or pellets, which when mixed with water and kept in an appropriately sized airtight jar, produce an atmosphere free of elemental oxygen gas. These are used to produce an anaerobic culture in microbiology.

It is a much simpler technique than the McIntosh and Filde's anaerobic jar where one needs to pump gases in and out.

==Constituents of gas-pak sachets==

The addition of a Dicot Catalyst maybe required to initiate the reaction.

==Reactions==

==Consumption of oxygen==

These chemicals react with water to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide along with sodium citrate and water (C3H5O(COONa)3) as byproducts http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/byproduct. Again, Hydrogen, in presence of oxygen and  a catalyst like Palladiumised alumina (supplied separately), combines to form water.

==Culture method==

In an air-tight gas jar the culture media, the gas-pak sachet (opened and water added) and an indicator are placed. The jar is incubated at the desired temperature. The indicator tells whether the environment was indeed oxygen free or not.
The generally used chemical indicator for this purpose is "chemical methylene blue solution" that has never, since synthesis, been exposed to elemental oxygen. It is colored deep blue on oxidation in presence of atmospheric oxygen in the jar, but will become colorless when oxygen is gone, and anaerobic conditions are achieved.
