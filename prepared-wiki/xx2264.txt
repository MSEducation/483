==Cell division==

Centrioles are involved in the organization of the  mitotic spindle and in the completion of cytokinesis.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(02)01019-9|pmid=12176356|year=2002|last1=Salisbury|first1=JL|last2=Suino|first2=KM|last3=Busby|first3=R|last4=Springett|first4=M|title=Centrin-2 is required for centriole duplication in mammalian cells|volume=12|issue=15|pages=1287–92|journal=Current biology : CB[/tpl] Centrioles were previously thought to be required for the formation of a mitotic spindle in animal cells. However, more recent experiments have demonstrated that cells whose centrioles have been removed via laser ablation can still progress through the G1 stage of interphase before centrioles can be synthesized later in a de novo fashion.[tpl]Cite journal|pmid=15738265|year=2005|last1=La Terra|first1=S|last2=English|first2=CN|last3=Hergert|first3=P|last4=McEwen|first4=BF|last5=Sluder|first5=G|last6=Khodjakov|first6=A|title=The de novo centriole assembly pathway in HeLa cells: cell cycle progression and centriole assembly/maturation|volume=168|issue=5|pages=713–22|doi=10.1083/jcb.200411126|pmc=2171814|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology[/tpl] Additionally, mutant flies lacking centrioles develop normally, although the adult flies' cells lack flagella and cilia and as a result, they die shortly after birth.[tpl]Cite journal|pmid=16814722|year=2006|last1=Basto|first1=R|last2=Lau|first2=J|last3=Vinogradova|first3=T|last4=Gardiol|first4=A|last5=Woods|first5=CG|last6=Khodjakov|first6=A|last7=Raff|first7=JW|title=Flies without centrioles|volume=125|issue=7|pages=1375–86|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.05.025|journal=Cell[/tpl]

==Cellular organization==

Centrioles are a very important part of centrosomes, which are involved in organizing microtubules in the cytoplasm.[tpl]Cite journal|pmid=17518519|year=2007|last1=Feldman|first1=JL|last2=Geimer|first2=S|last3=Marshall|first3=WF|title=The mother centriole plays an instructive role in defining cell geometry|volume=5|issue=6|pages=e149|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050149|pmc=1872036|journal=PLoS Biology[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0955-0674(02)00017-0|pmid=12517710|year=2003|last1=Beisson|first1=J|last2=Wright|first2=M|title=Basal body/centriole assembly and continuity|volume=15|issue=1|pages=96–104|journal=Current opinion in cell biology[/tpl] The position of the centriole determines the position of the nucleus and plays a crucial role in the spatial arrangement of the cell.  Buehler has suggested that the centriole may form a primitive directional "eye", sensitive to certain wavelengths in the Infra red spectrum.  He has also demonstrated that cells are capable of reacting to each other's presence at a distance, and even when separated by a film of glass.Albrecht-Buehler, G. Changes of cell behavior by near-infrared signals. Cell Motility and the Cytoskeleton 32:299-304 (1995)

==Ciliogenesis==

In organisms with flagella and cilia, the position of these organelles is determined by the mother centriole, which becomes the basal body.  An inability of cells to use centrioles to make functional cilia and flagella has been linked to a number of genetic and developmental diseases. In particular, the inability of centrioles to properly migrate prior to ciliary assembly has recently been linked to  Meckel-Gruber syndrome.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1242/dmm.006262|pmc=3008963|pmid=    21045211|year=2011|author=Cui, Cheng ; Chatterjee, Bishwanath ; Francis, Deanne ; Yu, Qing ; SanAgustin, Jovenal T. ; Francis, Richard ; Tansey, Terry ; Henry, Charisse ; Wang, Baolin ; Lemley, Bethan ; Pazour, Gregory J. ; Lo, Cecilia W.|title=Disruption of Mks1 localization to the mother centriole causes cilia defects and developmental malformations in Meckel-Gruber syndrome|volume=4|issue=1|pages=43–56|journal=Dis Model Mech|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3008963/[/tpl]

==Animal development==

Proper orientation of cilia via centriole positioning toward the posterior of embryonic node cells is critical for establishing left–right asymmetry during mammalian development.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]

==Centriole duplication==

Before DNA replication, cells contain two centrioles. The older of the two centrioles is termed the mother centriole, the other the daughter. During the cell division cycle, a new centriole grows from the side of each mother centriole. After duplication, the two centriole pairs will remain attached to each other orthogonally until mitosis. At that point the mother and daughter centrioles separate dependently on an enzyme called separase.[tpl]Cite journal|pmid=16862117|year=2006|last1=Tsou|first1=MF|last2=Stearns|first2=T|title=Mechanism limiting centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle|volume=442|issue=7105|pages=947–51|doi=10.1038/nature04985|journal=Nature|bibcode = 2006Natur.442..947T [/tpl]
The two centrioles in the centrosome are tied to one another. The mother centriole has radiating appendages at the distal end of its long axis and is attached to its daughter at the proximal end. Each daughter cell formed after cell division will inherit one of these pairs. Centrioles start duplicating when DNA replicates.

==Origin==

The last common ancestor of all eukaryotes was a ciliated cell with centrioles. Some lineages of eukaryotes, such as land plants, do not have centrioles except in their motile male gametes. Centrioles are completely absent from all cells of conifers and flowering plants, which do not have ciliate or flagellate gametes.Marshall, W.F. (2009) Centriole Evolution. Current Opinion in Cell Biology 21(1), 14–19. doi:  10.1016/j.ceb.2009.01.008
It is unclear if the last common ancestor had one[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/978-0-387-74021-8_10[/tpl] or two cilia.[tpl]Cite doi|10.1093/gbe/evp011[/tpl] Important genes required for centriole growth, like centrins, are only found in eukaryotes and not in bacteria or archaeans.
