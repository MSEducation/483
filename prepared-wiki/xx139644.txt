==Overview==

Dejen is connected to Wara Jarso in Oromia by the Abay Bridge, which also carries the Addis Ababa-Bahir Dar highway. Before this bridge was erected, the Abay was crossed at the Shefartak ford (at 10° 5' N 38° 17' E). A new bridge, the Hidasie Bridge, was dedicated 10 September 2008 at the presence of senior government officials and other guests. Funded by the Japanese government at a cost of 319.3 Birr, the Hidasie Bridge is 303 meters long and part of the new Addis Ababa-Dejen road."'Hidasie Bridge' opens for traffic: ERA", Ethiopian News Agency (accessed 29 April 2009) Experts foresee that improvements like the new bridge will allow drivers to double their speed to 60 kilometers per hour, and increase the volume of vehicles from the current 360 a day to 729 in six years. The new bridge sits alongside the older one over the Abay which had been built by the Italian government as part of their war reparations for their occupation of Ethiopia during World War II, and was about 60 years old when the new one was opened."Ethiopia: Japanese Kajima Close to Bridging Gap on Abay", reprinted from Addis Fortune, 5 August 2008 (accessed 14 August 2009)
