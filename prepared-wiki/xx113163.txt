[[Wildland fire engine]]

A wildland fire engine is a fire engine specifically designed to assist in fighting wildfires by transporting firefighters to the scene and providing them with access to the fire, along with water or other equipment. Most commonly used by the United States Forest Service, there are multiple types of wildfire apparatus which are used in different scenarios. According to the National Fire Protection Association, if the apparatus will be used primarily for outdoor and wildland responses, than it is to be considered a wildland fire apparatus and must conform to NFPA 1906.[tpl]cite web|last=David|first=Haston|title=NFPA 1906 and Wildland  Apparatus Design|url=http://www.fdsoa.org/2011_apparatus_symposium/NFPA%201906%20Update%20Urban-Rural-New%20Wildland.pdf|publisher=US Forest Service|accessdate=6 January 2014[/tpl]
Depending on where the engine is stationed it may carry as much as twice the national standard in fire hose. In areas where there is rugged terrain that keeps engines from driving directly to the fire, large hose lays are installed to transport water to the fire area. In desert areas with moderate terrain, less hose is used as it is easier to access the fire.[tpl]cite book|title=Engine Boss, S-231|year=2004|publisher=NWCG[/tpl] Often the technique of pump-and-roll is used where the vehicle drives with the pump engaged while a firefighter uses a hose to spray water on the fire. This technique allows a team of two to flank the perimeter of a fire.[tpl]cite book|title=Fire Fighter Training, S-130|year=2003|publisher=NWCG[/tpl]

==Features==

Wildland engines are traditionally smaller than standard fire engines and are primarily used for vegetation fires or wildland fires. They also respond to emergencies in the back country where traditional engines cannot respond. Most wildland engines feature four-wheel drive capability and can thus climb hills and make it through rough terrain. One of the features that makes these engines ideal for vegetation fires is that they can pump water while driving, whereas traditional engines must be put into park to flow water. This pump-and-roll feature allows the engines to make "running attacks" on vegetation fires, a tactic that can help minimize the rate of spread by having a firefighter walk the edge of a fire with a hose line and the engine trailing close behind.[tpl]cite web|title=Type 3 Engine|url=http://sbcfire.ndic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Type-3-Engine.pdf|publisher=Santa Barbara County Fire|accessdate=2930December 2013[/tpl]

==Engine types==

In the fall of 2007, the National Wildfire Coordinating Group agreed on a set of standards for all fire engines that are used for wildland firefighting. As structure engines are sometimes used on wildland fires, though primarily for structure protection, they are also included in the NWCG engine typing.[tpl]cite web|title=Engine Types|url=http://www.nwcg.gov/general/memos/nwcg-006-2008.pdf|publisher=National Wildfire Coordinating Group|accessdate=5 January 2014[/tpl]
Per the standards there are 7 types of fire engines.

===Type 3===

The Type 3 Engines are the most common type of wildland fire engine. While they traditionally have four-wheel drive to make driving over rough terrain easier, they can also be produced with standard rear wheel drive.[tpl]cite web|title=Wildland Type III|url=http://www.ferrarafire.com/Apparatus/Wildland/TypeIII/TypeIII.html|publisher=Ferrara Fire|accessdate=15 January 2014[/tpl] Additionally the cab can either be 2-door or 4-door holding up to four people, but no fewer than three.[tpl]cite web|title=Engines|url=http://www.nps.gov/fire/wildland-fire/learning-center/fire-in-depth/engines.cfm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=15 January 2014[/tpl] Type 3s are required to have a minimum of [tpl]convert|500|USgal|L impgal|[/tpl] of water, and be able to pump [tpl]convert|150|USgal/min|L/s impgal/min|abbr=none[/tpl] at a pressure of [tpl]convert|250|psi|kPa[/tpl]. They have a typical GVWR of [tpl]convert|26000|lbs|kg[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|title=USDA Forest Service Wildland Fire Engine Guide|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/eng/pubs/pdf/00511203.pdf|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=15 January 2014|page=4[/tpl]

===Type 4===

The Type 4 engine trades a smaller pump and less hose for a 50% larger tank. They are required to carry a minimum of [tpl]convert|750|USgal|L impgal|[/tpl] of water, but only pump [tpl]convert|50|USgal/min|L/s impgal/min|abbr=none[/tpl] at a pressure of [tpl]convert|100|psi|kPa[/tpl]. The typical GVWR is at least [tpl]convert|26000|lbs|kg[/tpl].

===Type 5===

Type 5s are normally used as an initial attack engine atop a medium duty chassis. The GVWR of the chassis is around [tpl]convert|20000|lbs|kg[/tpl].

===Type 6===

Type 6 Engines are usually used as initial attack engines. They are build on a pickup truck frame with a medium duty chassis giving a GVWR of [tpl]convert|9,000|-|16,000|lbs|kg[/tpl]. They are required to carry a minimum of [tpl]convert|150|USgal|L impgal|[/tpl] of water, but only pump [tpl]convert|50|USgal/min|L/s impgal/min|abbr=none[/tpl] at a pressure of [tpl]convert|100|psi|kPa[/tpl].

===Type 7===

Type 7s are Patrol vehicle with a small pump and tank. As a light duty vehicle, they are in the range of [tpl]convert|6,500|-|10,000|lbs|kg[/tpl] GVWR. The vehicle has a small [tpl]convert|50|USgal|L impgal|l[/tpl] water tank are can pump [tpl]convert|10|USgal/min|L/s impgal/min|abbr=none[/tpl] at a pressure of [tpl]convert|100|psi|kPa[/tpl].
pump and is a multipurpose unit used for patrol, mop
up, or initial attack.

==NFPA 1906==

Additionally, there are requirements laid out by the National Fire Protection Association in NFPA 1906: Standard for Wildland Fire Apparatus. Some of the many details of the NFPA 1906 include:
