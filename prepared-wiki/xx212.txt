Belfast ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|l|.|f|æ|s|t[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|b|əl|ˈ|f|aː|s|t[/tpl]; [tpl]Irish derived place name|Béal Feirste|mouth of the sandbanks[/tpl])Royal Mint – Belfast is the administrative capital and largest city of Northern Ireland. Most of Belfast is in County Antrim, but parts of East and South Belfast are in County Down. 
It is on the flood plain of the River Lagan.[tpl]cite book|authors=Beesley, S. & Wilde, J. |year=1997|title=Urban Flora of Belfast|publisher=The Institute of Irish Studies and The Queen's University of Belfast|isbn=0 85389 695 X[/tpl]
By population, Belfast is the eighteenth largest city in the United KingdomThe Geographist – UK: 1000 Largest Cities[tpl]unreliable source|date=April 2014[/tpl] and second largest on the island of Ireland. It is the seat of the devolved government and legislative Northern Ireland Assembly.[tpl]cite encyclopedia | title = Northern Ireland | work = MSN Encarta – Northern Ireland | publisher = Microsoft | url = http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761571415/Northern_Ireland.html | accessdate = 29 October 2007 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257012982925640 | archivedate = 31 October 2009[/tpl] At the time of the 2011 census, the city of Belfast had a population of 286,000 and lies at the heart of the Belfast Urban area, which has a population of 483,418 and the Belfast Metropolitan Area, which had a population of 579,276 at the 2001 census. The Larger Urban Zone, as defined by the European Union, has a total population 641,638.[tpl]when|date=March 2014[/tpl][tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] Belfast was granted city status in 1888.
Historically, Belfast has been a centre for the Irish linen industry (earning the nickname "Linenopolis"), tobacco production, rope-making and shipbuilding: the city's main shipbuilders, Harland and Wolff, which built the well-known RMS Titanic, propelled Belfast on to the global stage in the early 20th century as the biggest and most productive shipyard in the world.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] Belfast played a key role in the Industrial Revolution, establishing its place as a global industrial centre until the latter half of the 20th century. Industrialisation and the inward migration it brought made Belfast, if briefly, the biggest city in Ireland at the beginning of the 20th century, and the city's industrial and economic success was cited by unionist opponents of Home Rule as a reason why Ireland should shun devolution and later why Ulster unionists in particular would fight to resist it.
Today, Belfast remains a centre for industry, as well as the arts, higher education, business, and law, and is the economic engine of Northern Ireland. The city suffered greatly during the period of conflict called "the Troubles", but latterly has undergone a sustained period of calm, free from the intense political violence of former years, and substantial economic and commercial growth. Additionally, Belfast city centre has undergone considerable expansion and regeneration in recent years, notably around Victoria Square.
Belfast is served by two airports: George Best Belfast City Airport in the city, and Belfast International Airport [tpl]convert|15|mi|km|0[/tpl] west of the city. Belfast is also a major port, with commercial and industrial docks dominating the Belfast Lough shoreline, including the famous Harland and Wolff shipyard. Belfast is a constituent city of the Dublin-Belfast corridor, which has a population of three million, or half the total population of the island of Ireland. Belfast is listed by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC) as a global city, with a ranking of 'Gamma'.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2012t.html|title=The World According to GaWC 2012|work=Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) Study Group and Network|publisher=Loughborough University|accessdate=2014-02-15[/tpl]

==Name==

The name Belfast is derived from the Irish Béal Feirsde, which was later spelled Béal Feirste.Dictionary of the Irish Language: bél (Letter B, Column 61); fertas (Letter F, Column 96). The word béal means "mouth" or "rivermouth" while feirsde/feirste is the genitive singular of fearsaid and refers to a sandbar or tidal ford across a river's mouth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/?text=Belfast&placeID=118005&uiLang=en |title=Placenames Database of Ireland – Belfast |publisher=Logainm.ie |accessdate=12 August 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Placenames/Logainmneacha – Belfast | work = BBC Northern Ireland – Education |publisher=BBC | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/irish/blas/education/beginnersblas/1belfast.shtml | accessdate = 17 May 2007[/tpl] The name would thus translate literally as "(river) mouth of the sandbar" or "(river) mouth of the ford". This sandbar was formed at the confluence of two rivers at what is now Donegall Quay: the Lagan, which flows into Belfast Lough, and its tributary the Farset. This area was the hub around which the original settlement developed.[tpl]cite book | last = Keenan | first = Desmond | title = Pre-Famine Ireland | pages = Chapter 5 | publisher = XLibris.com | url = http://www.deskeenan.com/4PrChapter5.htm | year= 2000 | nopp = true[/tpl] The Irish name Béal Feirste is shared by a townland in County Mayo, whose name has been anglicised as Belfarsad.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/37016.aspx |title=Placenames Database of Ireland – Belfarsad |publisher=Logainm.ie |accessdate=13 November 2010[/tpl]
An alternative interpretation of the name is "mouth of river of the sandbar", an allusion to the River Farset, which flows into the Lagan where the sandbar was located. This interpretation was favoured by Edmund Hogan and John O'Donovan.[tpl]Cite book |title=Onomasticon Goedelicum |last=Hogan |first=Edmund |year=1910 |location=Dublin |url=http://publish.ucc.ie/doi/locus/B[/tpl]; [tpl]Cite book|title=Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland |last=O'Donovan |first=John |year=1856 |location=Dublin |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/annalarioghachta04ocle#page/1100/mode/2up[/tpl] It seems clear, however, that the river itself was also named after the tidal crossing.

===Origins===

The site of Belfast has been occupied since the Bronze Age. The Giant's Ring, a 5,000-year-old henge, is located near the city, and the remains of Iron Age hill forts can still be seen in the surrounding hills. Belfast remained a small settlement of little importance during the Middle Ages. John de Courcy built a castle on what is now Castle Street in the city centre in the 12th century, but this was on a lesser scale and not as strategically important as Carrickfergus Castle to the north, which was built by de Courcy in 1177. The O'Neill clan had a presence in the area.
In the 14th century, Cloinne Aodha Buidhe, descendants of Aodh Buidhe O'Neill built Grey Castle at Castlereagh, now in the east of the city.[tpl]cite book | last = Komesu | first = Okifumi | title = Irish Writers and Politics | page = 73 | publisher = Rowman & Littlefield | url = http://books.google.com/?id=AwFO2Z8Bk0YC&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=%22yellow+hugh+o+neill%22 | year= 1990 | isbn = 978-0-389-20926-3[/tpl] Conn O'Neill of the Clannaboy O'Neills owned vast lands in the area and was the last inhabitant of Grey Castle, one remaining link being the Conn's Water river flowing through east Belfast.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.theflightoftheearls.net/May2406.pdf |title=Celebrations mark the arrival of first Ulster Scots in Ireland |publisher=Irish News |date=24 April 2006 |accessdate=18 September 2007|format=PDF| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070927114138/http://www.theflightoftheearls.net/May2406.pdf| archivedate= 27 September 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Growth===

Belfast became a substantial settlement in the 17th century after being established as a town by Sir Arthur Chichester, which was initially settled by Protestant English and Scottish migrants at the time of the Plantation of Ulster. (Belfast and County Antrim, however, did not form part of this particular Plantation scheme as they were privately colonised.) In 1791, the Society of United Irishmen was founded in Belfast, after Henry Joy McCracken and other prominent Presbyterians from the city invited Theobald Wolfe Tone and Thomas Russell to a meeting, after having read Tone's "Argument on Behalf of the Catholics of Ireland". Evidence of this period of Belfast's growth can still be seen in the oldest areas of the city, known as the Entries.
Belfast blossomed as a commercial and industrial centre in the 18th and 19th centuries and became Ireland's pre-eminent industrial city. Industries thrived, including linen, rope-making, tobacco, heavy engineering and shipbuilding, and at the end of the 19th century, Belfast briefly overtook Dublin as the largest city in Ireland. The Harland and Wolff shipyards became one of the largest shipbuilders in the world, employing up to 35,000 workers.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/3176184.stm |title=Cranes to remain on city skyline |publisher=BBC News |date=9 October 2003 |accessdate=12 March 2007[/tpl] In 1886 the city suffered intense riots over the issue of home rule, which had divided the city.
In 1920–22, Belfast became the capital of the new entity of Northern Ireland as the island of Ireland was partitioned. The accompanying conflict (the Irish War of Independence) cost up to 500 lives in Belfast, the bloodiest sectarian strife in the city until the Troubles of the late 1960s onwards.Robert Lynch, The Northern IRA and the Early Years of Partition, p227
Belfast was heavily bombed during World War II. In one raid, in 1941, German bombers killed around one thousand people and left tens of thousands homeless. Apart from London, this was the greatest loss of life in a night raid during the Blitz.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1269206.stm |title=The Belfast blitz is remembered |publisher=BBC News |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=12 March 2007[/tpl]

===The Troubles===

Belfast has been the capital of Northern Ireland since its establishment in 1921 following the Government of Ireland Act 1920. It had been the scene of various episodes of sectarian conflict between its Catholic and Protestant populations. These opposing groups in this conflict are now often termed republican and loyalist respectively, although they are also referred to as 'nationalist' and 'unionist'. The most recent example of this conflict was known as the Troubles – a civil conflict that raged from around 1969 to 1998.
Belfast saw some of the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, particularly in the 1970s, with rival paramilitary groups formed on both sides. Bombing, assassination and street violence formed a backdrop to life throughout the Troubles. The Provisional IRA detonated 22 bombs within the confines of Belfast city centre in 1972, on what is known as "Bloody Friday", killing nine people. Loyalist paramilitaries including the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) claimed that the killings they carried out were in retaliation for the IRA campaign. Most of their victims were Catholics with no links to the Provisional IRA.[tpl]cite book | last = Ó Dochartaigh | first = Niall | authorlink = Toby Harnden | title = From Civil Rights To Armalites | publisher = Cork University Press | year = 1999 | page = 292 | isbn = 978-1-85918-108-9[/tpl] A particularly notorious group, based on the Shankill Road in the mid-1970s, became known as the Shankill Butchers.
In all, over 1,600 people were killed in political violence in the city between 1969 and 2001.[tpl]cite news|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/search.html |title=Sutton Index of Deaths |publisher=CAIN |accessdate=9 July 2013 | date=11 April 2001 |quote=Search for Belfast in "Text Search of Description (and key words)"[/tpl] Due to the violence, even continuing today, Belfast is often referred to as the "European Capital of Terrorism".

==Government==

Belfast was granted borough status by James VI and I in 1613 and official city status by Queen Victoria in 1888.[tpl]cite web | title = Belfast City Hall: History and Background | publisher = Belfast City Council | url = http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/cityhall/history.asp?menuitem=background | accessdate = 24 May 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070504052645/http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/cityhall/history.asp?menuitem=background| archivedate= 4 May 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Since 1973 it has been a local government district under local administration by Belfast City Council.[tpl]cite web | title = Local Government (Boundaries) Act (Northern Ireland) 1971 | publisher = Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) | year= 2007 | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/lgba1971.htm | accessdate = 24 May 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070707194021/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/lgba1971.htm| archivedate= 7 July 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Belfast is represented in both the British House of Commons and in the Northern Ireland Assembly. For elections to the European Parliament, Belfast is within the Northern Ireland constituency.

===Local government===

Belfast City Council is the local council with responsibility for the city. The city's elected officials are the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Deputy Lord Mayor and High Sheriff who are elected from among 51 councillors. The first Lord Mayor of Belfast was Daniel Dixon, who was elected in 1892.[tpl]cite web | title = Councillors: Lord Mayor | publisher = Belfast City Council | url = http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/councillors/index.asp?menuitem2=lord-mayor | accessdate = 24 May 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070607193627/http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/councillors/index.asp?menuitem2=lord-mayor| archivedate= 7 June 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The current Lord Mayor is Mairtin O'Muilleoir of Sinn Féin, while the Deputy Lord Mayor is Councillor Christopher Stalford of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), both of whom were elected in June 2013 to serve a one-year term. The Lord Mayor's duties include presiding over meetings of the council, receiving distinguished visitors to the city, and representing and promoting the city on the national and international stage.
In 1997, Unionists lost overall control of Belfast City Council for the first time in its history, with the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland gaining the balance of power between Nationalists and Unionists. This position was confirmed in the three subsequent council elections, with mayors from Nationalist Sinn Féin and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), and the cross-community Alliance Party regularly elected since. The first nationalist Lord Mayor of Belfast was Alban Maginness of the SDLP, in 1997.
The last elections to Belfast City Council were held on 5 May 2011, with the City's voters electing fifty-one councillors across nine district electoral areas. The election saw Nationalist councillors outnumber Unionist councillors for the first time, with Sinn Féin becoming the largest party: 16(+2) Sinn Féin, 15(-) Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), 8(-) SDLP, 6(+2) Alliance Party, 3(−4) Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), 2 Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), and 1 Independent (a former deputy mayor who takes the UUP whip was a member of the defunct loyalist paramilitary linked-Ulster Democratic Party).[tpl]cite web | title = Belfast City Council Elections 1993–2005 | work = Northern Ireland Elections | publisher = Northern Ireland Social and Political Archive (ARK) | year= 2005 | url = http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/lgbelfast.htm | accessdate = 24 May 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070608000519/http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/lgbelfast.htm| archivedate= 8 June 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Northern Ireland Assembly and Westminster===

[tpl]See also|Belfast (Northern Ireland Parliament constituencies)|Belfast (UK Parliament constituency)[/tpl]As Northern Ireland's capital city, Belfast is host to the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont, the site of the devolved legislature for Northern Ireland. Belfast is divided into four Northern Ireland Assembly and UK parliamentary constituencies: North Belfast, West Belfast, South Belfast and East Belfast. All four extend beyond the city boundaries to include parts of Castlereagh, Lisburn and Newtownabbey districts. In the Northern Ireland Assembly Elections in 2011, Belfast elected 24 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), 6 from each constituency. Belfast elected 8 Sinn Féin, 7 DUP, 4 SDLP, 3 Alliance Party, and 2 UUP MLAs.[tpl]cite news | title = Northern Ireland election |publisher=BBC News | date= 11 May 2011 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/election2011/constituency/html/northern_ireland.stm | accessdate = 15 February 2014[/tpl] In the 2010 UK general election, Belfast elected one MP from each constituency to the House of Commons at Westminster, London. This comprised 1 DUP, 1 SDLP, 1 Alliance and 1 Sinn Féin.[tpl]cite web | title = The 2005 Westminster elections in Northern Ireland | work = Northern Ireland Elections | publisher = Northern Ireland Social and Political Archive (ARK) | year= 2005 | url = http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/fw05.htm | accessdate = 24 May 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070608002447/http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/fw05.htm| archivedate= 8 June 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Coat of arms and motto===

The city of Belfast has the Latin motto "[tpl]lang|la|Pro tanto quid retribuamus[/tpl]." This is taken from Psalm 116 Verse 12 in the Latin Vulgate Bible and is literally "For (Pro) so much (tanto) what (quid) we shall repay (retribuamus)" The verse has been translated in bibles differently – for example as "What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me?".King James Bible, Psalm 116 Verse 12 It is also translated as "In return for so much, what shall we give back?""I reflected on the two mottos of Belfast and America – '[tpl]lang|la|Pro Tanto Quid[/tpl]' and '[tpl]lang|la|E Pluribus Unum[/tpl]'. I am reliably informed that these roughly translate as 'In return for so much, what shall we give back?' and 'From many, one'." Celebrating diversity, by Belfast Lord Mayor Tom Ekin The Queen's University Students' Union Rag Week publication PTQ derives its name from the first three words of the motto.
The coat of arms of the city are blazoned as Party per fesse argent and azure, in chief a pile vair and on a canton gules a bell argent, in base a ship with sails set argent on waves of the sea proper. This heraldic language describes a shield that is divided in two horizontally (party per fesse). The top (chief) of the shield is silver (argent), and has a point-down triangle (a pile) with a repeating blue-and-white pattern that represents fur (vair). There is also a red square in the top corner (a canton gules) on which there is a silver bell. It is likely that the bell is an example here of "canting" (or punning) heraldry, representing the first syllable of Belfast. In the lower part of the shield (in base) there is a silver sailing ship shown sailing on waves coloured in the actual colours of the sea (proper). The supporter on the "dexter" side (that is, the viewer's left) is a chained wolf, while on the "sinister" side the supporter is a sea-horse. The crest above the shield is also a sea-horse. These arms date back to 1613, when James VI and I granted Belfast town status. The seal was used by Belfast merchants throughout the 17th century on their signs and trade-coins.[tpl]cite book | last = Brett | first = C. E. B. | title = Buildings of Belfast, 1700–1914 | publisher = Weidenfeld and Nicolson | year= 1967 | location = London[/tpl] A large stained glass window in the City Hall displays the arms, where an explanation suggests that the seahorse and the ship refer to Belfast's significant maritime history. The wolf may be a tribute to the city's founder, Sir Arthur Chichester, and refer to his own coat of arms.

==Geography==

The city is flanked to the northwest by a series of hills, including Cavehill. Belfast is located at the western end of Belfast Lough and at the mouth of the River Lagan making it an ideal location for the shipbuilding industry that once made it famous. When the Titanic was built in Belfast in 1911/1912, Harland and Wolff had the largest shipyard in the world.[tpl]cite web | title = Introduction To Titanic – Titanic in History | work = Titanic.

Belfast is situated on Northern Ireland's eastern coast at [tpl]Coord|54|35|49|N|05|55|45|W|[/tpl]. A consequence of this northern latitude is that it both endures short winter days and enjoys long summer evenings. During the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, local sunset is before 16:00 while sunrise is around 08:45. This is balanced by the summer solstice in June, when the sun sets after 22:00 and rises before 05:00.[tpl]cite web | title = Sunrise and sunset in Belfast | work = Sun Calculator | publisher = time and date.com | url = http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/astronomy.html?n=919| accessdate = 18 May 2007 [/tpl]
In 1994, a weir was built across the river by the Laganside Corporation to raise the average water level so that it would cover the unseemly mud flats which gave Belfast its name[tpl]cite web | title = Lagan Weir – Why it exists | publisher = Laganside | url = http://www.laganside.com/laganweir.asp | accessdate = 25 May 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070418044643/http://www.laganside.com/laganweir.asp| archivedate= 18 April 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] ([tpl]etymology|ga|Béal Feirste|The sandy ford at the river mouth[/tpl]).

The River Farset is also named after this silt deposit (from the Irish feirste meaning "sand spit"). Originally a more significant river than it is today, the Farset formed a dock on High Street until the mid 19th century. Bank Street in the city centre referred to the river bank and Bridge Street was named for the site of an early Farset bridge.[tpl]cite web | title = Belfast City: Did you know? | work = Discover Ireland | publisher = Tourism Ireland | year= 2007 | url = http://www.discoverireland.com/za/ireland-places-to-go/areas-and-cities/belfast-city/highlights/culture/ | accessdate = 18 May 2007[/tpl] Superseded by the River Lagan as the more important river in the city, the Farset now languishes in obscurity, under High Street. There are no less than eleven other minor rivers in and around Belfast, namely the Blackstaff, the Colin, the Connswater, the Cregagh, the Derriaghy, the Forth, the Knock, the Legoniel, the Milewater, the Purdysburn and the Ravernet.Des O'Reilly, Rivers of Belfast – A History
The city is flanked on the north and northwest by a series of hills, including Divis Mountain, Black Mountain and Cavehill thought to be the inspiration for Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels. When Swift was living at Lilliput Cottage near the bottom of the Limestone Road in Belfast, he imagined that the Cavehill resembled the shape of a sleeping giant safeguarding the city.[tpl]cite web | title = Belfast Hills | work = Discover Northern Ireland | publisher = Northern Ireland Tourist Board | url = http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/product.aspx?ProductID=10391 | accessdate = 18 May 2007[/tpl] The shape of the giant's nose, known locally as Napoleon's Nose, is officially called McArt's Fort probably named after Art O'Neill, a 17th-century chieftain who controlled the area at that time.[tpl]cite web | title = About the Cave Hill | publisher = The Cave Hill Conservation Campaign | year= 2007 | url = http://www.cavehill.freeuk.com/home.htm | accessdate = 25 May 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070206154855/http://www.cavehill.freeuk.com/home.htm |archivedate = 6 February 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] The Castlereagh Hills overlook the city on the southeast.

===Climate===

As with the rest of Ireland, Belfast has a temperate climate, with a narrow range of temperatures and rainfall throughout the year. The climate of Belfast is significantly milder than some other locations in the world at a similar latitude, due to the warming influence of the Gulf Stream. There are currently 5 weather observing stations in the Belfast area: Helens Bay, Stormont, Newforge, Castlereagh, and Ravenhill Road. Slightly further afield is Aldergrove Airport.
The highest temperature recorded at any official weather station in the Belfast area was [tpl]convert|30.8|°C|0[/tpl] at Shaws Bridge on 12 July 1983.[tpl]cite web | title = Climate: Northern Ireland | publisher = Met Office | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/ni/ | accessdate = 25 May 2007[/tpl] Belfast also holds the record for Northern Ireland's warmest night time minimum, [tpl]convert|19.6|°C|1[/tpl] at Whitehouse on 14 August 2001.

The absolute maximum temperature at the weather station at Stormont is [tpl]convert|29.7|°C|0[/tpl], set during July 1983. In an average year the warmest day will rise to a temperature of [tpl]convert|24.4|°C|1[/tpl] with a day of [tpl]convert|25.1|°C|1[/tpl] or above occurring roughly once every two in three years.
The absolute minimum temperature at Stormont is [tpl]convert|−9.9|°C|0[/tpl], during January 1982, although in an average year the coldest night will fall no lower than [tpl]convert|−4.5|°C|0[/tpl] with air frost being recorded on just 26 nights. The lowest temperature to occur in recent years was −8.8 on 22 December 2010.
The nearest weather station for which sunshine data and longer term observations are available is Belfast International Airport (Aldergrove). Perhaps not surprisingly, temperature extremes here have slightly more variability due to the more inland location. The average warmest day at Aldergrove for example will reach a temperature of [tpl]convert|25.4|°C|1[/tpl], (1.0 Celsius higher than Stormont) and 2.1 days should attain a temperature of [tpl]convert|25.1|°C|1[/tpl] or above in total. Conversely the coldest night of the year averages [tpl]convert|−6.6|°C|1[/tpl] (or 1.9 celius lower the Stormont) and 39 nights should register an air frost. Some 13 more frosty nights than Stormont. 
The minimum temperature at Aldergrove was [tpl]convert|−14.2|°C|0[/tpl], during December 2010.

Belfast expanded very rapidly from being a market town to becoming an industrial city during the course of the 19th century. Because of this, it is less an agglomeration of villages and towns which have expanded into each other, than other comparable cities, such as Manchester or Birmingham. The city expanded to the natural barrier of the hills that surround it, overwhelming other settlements. Consequently, the arterial roads along which this expansion took place (such as the Falls Road or the Newtownards Road) are more significant in defining the districts of the city than nucleated settlements. Belfast remains segregated by walls, commonly known as "peace lines", erected by the British Army after August 1969, and which still divide 14 districts in the inner city.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Margrethe C.

Belfast city centre is divided into two postcode districts, BT1 for the area lying north of the City Hall, and BT2 for the area to its south. The industrial estate and docklands BT3. The rest of the Belfast post town is divided in a broadly clockwise system from BT3 in the north-east round to BT15, with BT16 and BT17 further out to the east and west respectively.

==Cityscape==

===Architecture===

The architectural style of Belfast's buildings range from Edwardian, like the City Hall, to modern, like Waterfront Hall. Many of the city's Victorian landmarks, including the main Lanyon Building at Queen's University Belfast and the Linenhall Library, were designed by Sir Charles Lanyon.
The City Hall was finished in 1906 and was built to reflect Belfast's city status, granted by Queen Victoria in 1888. The Edwardian architectural style of Belfast City Hall influenced the Victoria Memorial in Calcutta, India, and Durban City Hall in South Africa.[tpl]cite book | last = Krishna | first = Dutta | title = Calcutta: A Cultural and Literary History | page = 132 | publisher = Signal Books | url = http://books.google.com/?id=UKfoHi5412UC&pg=PA132&dq=%22victoria+memorial%22+calcutta+belfast+-wikipedia | year= 2003 | isbn = 978-1-902669-59-5[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/world/africa/25durban.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |title=Where the Road to Renaming Does Not Run Smooth |work=New York Times |date=25 May 2006 |accessdate=1 October 2007|author=Wines, Michael| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070919091549/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/world/africa/25durban.html?_r=1&oref=slogin| archivedate= 19 September 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The dome is 173 ft (53 m) high and figures above the door state "Hibernia encouraging and promoting the Commerce and Arts of the City".[tpl]cite web | title = Historic Belfast: A guide to the City's landmark buildings | publisher = Go To Belfast | url = http://www.gotobelfast.com/index.cfm/level/page/category_key/197/Page_Key/428/Parent_Key/0/type/Page/PaGeName/Historic_Buildings_of_Belfast | accessdate = 23 May 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070618164651/http://www.gotobelfast.com/index.cfm/level/page/category_key/197/Page_Key/428/Parent_Key/0/type/Page/PaGeName/Historic_Buildings_of_Belfast |archivedate = 18 June 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Among the city's grandest buildings are two former banks: Ulster Bank in Waring Street (built in 1860) and Northern Bank, in nearby Donegall Street (built in 1769). The Royal Courts of Justice in Chichester Street are home to Northern Ireland's Supreme Court. Many of Belfast's oldest buildings are found in the Cathedral Quarter area, which is currently undergoing redevelopment as the city's main cultural and tourist area. Windsor House, 262 ft (80 m) high, has 23 floors and is the second tallest building (as distinct from structure) in Ireland.[tpl]cite web | last = Morgan | first = Ian | title = Ireland's tallest building to be turned into flats | publisher = 24dash.com | date= 4 March 2007 | url = http://www.24dash.com/printNews/1/17408.htm | accessdate = 2 June 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929091452/http://www.24dash.com/printNews/1/17408.htm  |archivedate = 29 September 2007[/tpl] Work has started on the taller Obel Tower, which already surpasses the height of Windsor House in its unfinished state.

The ornately decorated Crown Liquor Saloon, designed by Joseph Anderson in 1876, in Great Victoria Street is one of only two pubs in the UK that are owned by the National Trust (the other is the George Inn, Southwark in London).

Including the Waterfront Hall and the Odyssey Arena, Belfast has several other venues for performing arts. The architecture of the Grand Opera House has an oriental theme and was completed in 1895. It was bombed several times during the Troubles but has now been restored to its former glory.[tpl]cite web | title = Grand Opera House | publisher = Cinema Treasures | url = http://cinematreasures.org/theater/2061/ | accessdate = 1 June 2007[/tpl] The Lyric Theatre, (re-opened 1 May 2011 after undergoing a rebuilding programme) the only full-time producing theatre in the country, is where film star Liam Neeson began his career.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4083973.stm |title=Neeson in bid to revive theatre |publisher=BBC News |date=10 December 2004 |accessdate=7 December 2007|author=BBC| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080116220650/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4083973.stm| archivedate= 16 January 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The Ulster Hall (1859–1862) was originally designed for grand dances but is now used primarily as a concert and sporting venue.

===Parks and gardens===

Sitting at the mouth of the River Lagan where it becomes a deep and sheltered lough, Belfast is surrounded by mountains that create a micro-climate conducive to horticulture. From the Victorian Botanic Gardens in the heart of the city to the heights of Cave Hill Country Park, the great expanse of Lagan Valley Regional Park to Colin Glen, Belfast contains an abundance of parkland and forest parks.[tpl]cite news | title = Parks and gardens | publisher = gotobelfast| date= 1 April 2007 | url = http://www.gotobelfast.com/what_to_do/attractions/parks__gardens.aspx| accessdate = 16 May 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Parks and Gardens are an integral part of Belfast's heritage, and home to an abundance of local wildlife and popular places for a picnic, a stroll or a jog. Numerous events take place throughout including festivals such as Rose Week and special activities such as bird watching evenings and great beast hunts.
Belfast has over forty public parks. The Forest of Belfast is a partnership between government and local groups, set up in 1992 to manage and conserve the city's parks and open spaces. They have commissioned more than 30 public sculptures since 1993.[tpl]cite web | title = Forest of Belfast | publisher = Belfast City Council | url = http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/parksandopenspaces/forestofbelfast.asp?menuitem=forest | accessdate = 18 May 2007[/tpl] In 2006, the City Council set aside £8 million to continue this work.[tpl]cite web | title = Your City, Your Space | publisher = Belfast City Council | url = http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/parksandopenspaces/openspacestrategy.asp?menuitem=yourcity | accessdate = 18 May 2007[/tpl] The Belfast Naturalists' Field Club was founded in 1863 and is administered by National Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland.[ref]

Belfast Zoo is owned by Belfast City Council. The council spends £1.5 million every year on running and promoting the zoo, which is one of the few local government-funded zoos in the UK and Ireland. The Zoo is one of the top visitor attraction in Northern Ireland, receiving more than 295,000 visitors a year. The majority of the animals are in danger in their natural habitat. The zoo houses more than 1,200 animals of 140 species including Asian Elephants, Barbary lions, a White tigers (one of the few in the United Kingdom), three species of penguin, a family of Western Lowland Gorillas, a troop of Common Chimpanzees, a pair of Red Pandas, a pair of Goodfellow's tree-kangaroos and several species of langur.

Belfast experienced a huge growth in population around the first half of the twentieth century. This rise slowed and peaked around the start of the Troubles with the 1971 census showing almost 600,000 people in the Belfast Urban Area.[tpl]cite web | last = Stephen | first = Roulston | title = Urban Structure: Growth of Belfast | work = Geography in Action | publisher = National Grid for Learning | year= 2006 | url = http://www.geographyinaction.co.uk/Urban_structure/Urban_growth.html | accessdate = 18 May 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070415203906/http://geographyinaction.co.uk/Urban_structure/Urban_growth.html| archivedate= 15 April 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Since then, the inner city numbers have dropped dramatically as people have moved to swell the Greater Belfast suburb population. The 2001 census population within the same Urban Area, had fallen to 277,391 people, with 579,554 people living in the wider Belfast Metropolitan Area.

Socio-economic areas radiate out from the Central Business District, with a pronounced wedge of affluence extending out the Malone Road and Upper Malone Road to the south. An area of greater deprivation extends to the west of the city.

Despite a period of relative peace, most areas and districts of Belfast still reflect the divided nature of Northern Ireland as a whole.

===Industrial growth===

When the population of Belfast town began to grow in the 17th century, its economy was built on commerce.[tpl]cite book | last = Beckett | first = JC |author2=et al. | title = Belfast, The Making of the City. Chapter 1: Belfast to the end of the eighteenth century | publisher = Appletree Press Ltd | year= 2003 | location = Belfast | pages = 13–26 | isbn = 0-86281-878-8[/tpl] It provided a market for the surrounding countryside and the natural inlet of Belfast Lough gave the city its own port. The port supplied an avenue for trade with Great Britain and later Europe and North America. In the mid-17th century, Belfast exported beef, butter, hides, tallow and corn and it imported coal, cloth, wine, brandy, paper, timber and tobacco.
Around this time, the linen trade in Northern Ireland blossomed and by the middle of the 18th century, one fifth of all the linen exported from Ireland was shipped from Belfast. The present city however is a product of the Industrial Revolution.[tpl]cite book | title = The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. | publisher = Columbia University Press | year= 2005 | url = http://www.bartleby.com/65/be/Belfast.html[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2011[/tpl] It was not until industry transformed the linen and shipbuilding trades that the economy and the population boomed.

The rise of mass-produced and cotton clothing following World War I were some of the factors which led to the decline of Belfast's international linen trade. Like many British cities dependent on traditional heavy industry, Belfast suffered serious decline since the 1960s, exacerbated greatly in the 1970s and 1980s by the Troubles. More than 100,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since the 1970s.[tpl]cite journal | title = Northern Ireland – Where is the bright new future? | journal = Management Today | date = 23 March 2006 | url = http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/542849/ | accessdate = 16 May 2007[/tpl] For several decades, Northern Ireland's fragile economy required significant public support from the British exchequer of up to £4 billion per year.
Ongoing sectarian violence has made it difficult for Belfast to compete with Dublin's Celtic Tiger economy. This has meant that wage rates in Belfast and Northern Ireland until recently were significantly lower than those in the Republic of Ireland. The effect of the economic depression in the Irish Republic on wage levels is not yet fully apparent. The cost of living in Northern Ireland is significantly lower than in the Republic and this has created a retail boom in border towns and cities.

==Infrastructure==

Belfast saw the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, with nearly half of the total deaths in the conflict occurring in the city. However, since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, there has been significant urban regeneration in the city centre including Victoria Square, Queen's Island and Laganside as well as the Odyssey complex and the landmark Waterfront Hall. The city is served by two airports: The George Best Belfast City Airport adjacent to Belfast Lough and Belfast International Airport which is near Lough Neagh. Queen's University of Belfast is the main university in the city. The University of Ulster also maintains a campus in the city, which concentrates on fine art, design and architecture.
Belfast is one of the constituent cities that makes up the Dublin-Belfast corridor region, which has a population of just under 3 million.

===Transport===

Belfast is a relatively car-dependent city by European standards, with an extensive road network including the [tpl]convert|22.5|mi|km|0[/tpl] M2 and M22 motorway route.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/roads/m2.html |title=M2 / M22 Motorway |publisher=Wesleyjohnston.com |accessdate=12 August 2010[/tpl] A recent survey of how people travel in Northern Ireland showed that people in Belfast made 77% of all journeys by car, 11% by public transport and 6% on foot.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency | title = Travel Survey for Northern Ireland 2002–04 | publisher = Department for Regional Development | date = 18 October 2005 | url = http://www.drdni.gov.uk/statistic-details.htm?publication_id=161 | format = PDF | accessdate = 6 May 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070519124721/http://www.drdni.gov.uk/statistic-details.htm?publication_id=161| archivedate= 19 May 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] It also showed that Belfast has 0.70 cars per household compared to figures of 1.18 in the East and 1.14 in the West of Northern Ireland. A road improvement-scheme in Belfast began early in 2006, with the upgrading of two junctions along the Westlink dual-carriageway to grade-separated standard. The improvement scheme was completed five months ahead of schedule on February 2009, with the official opening taking place on 4 March 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drdni.gov.uk/index/publications/publications-details.htm?docid=5070|title=The Official Opening of the M1/Westlink Improvement Scheme |publisher=The Department for Regional Development|date=12 March 2009 |accessdate=1 February 2011[/tpl]

Black taxis are common in the city, operating on a share basis in some areas. These are outnumbered by private hire taxis. Bus and rail public transport in Northern Ireland is operated by subsidiaries of Translink. Bus services in the city proper and the nearer suburbs are operated by Translink Metro, with services focusing on linking residential districts with the city centre on 12 quality bus corridors running along main radial roads, resulting in poor connections between different suburban areas.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl]
More distant suburbs are served by Ulsterbus. Northern Ireland Railways provides suburban services along three lines running through Belfast's northern suburbs to Carrickfergus, Larne and Larne Harbour, eastwards towards Bangor and south-westwards towards Lisburn and Portadown. This service is known as the Belfast Suburban Rail system. Belfast also has a direct rail connection with Dublin called Enterprise which is operated jointly by NIR and Iarnród Éireann, the state railway company of the Republic of Ireland.
In April 2008, the Department for Regional Development reported on a plan for a light-rail system, similar to that in Dublin. The consultants said Belfast does not have the population to support a light rail system, suggesting that investment in bus-based rapid transit would be preferable.The study found that bus-based rapid transit produces positive economic results, but light rail does not. The report by Atkins & KPMG, however, said there would be the option of migrating to light rail in the future should the demand increase.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_7330000/newsid_7336800/7336822.stm?bw=bb&mp=wm&news=1&bbcws=1 |title=video No light rail system for city |publisher=BBC News |date= 8 April 2008|accessdate=30 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = City to get rapid transit network | work = BBC Northern Ireland | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7335313.stm| accessdate = 4 April 2008 | date=8 April 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080409114158/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7335313.stm| archivedate= 9 April 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
The city has two airports: Belfast International Airport offers domestic, European flights and one transatlantic flight daily to Newark, New Jersey provided by United Airlines and is located northwest of the city, near Lough Neagh, while the George Best Belfast City Airport, which is closer to the city centre by train from Sydenham on the Bangor Line, adjacent to Belfast Lough, offers UK domestic flights and a few European flights.

==Culture==

Belfast's population is evenly split between its Protestant and Catholic residents. These two distinct cultural communities have both contributed significantly to the city's culture. Throughout the Troubles, Belfast artists continued to express themselves through poetry, art and music. In the period since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, Belfast has begun a social, economic and cultural transformation giving it a growing international cultural reputation.[tpl]cite web | title = Summary of the bid | work = One Belfast Where Hope and History Rhyme (Internet Archive) | publisher = Imagine Belfast 2008 | date= 22 November 2002 | url = http://www.imaginebelfast2008.com/front.html | accessdate = 24 May 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021207124752/www.imaginebelfast2008.com/front.html |archivedate=7 December 2002[/tpl] In 2003, Belfast had an unsuccessful bid for the 2008 European Capital of Culture.

Like all areas of the island of Ireland outside of the Gaeltacht, the Irish language in Belfast is not that of an unbroken intergenerational transmission. Due to community activity in the 1960s, including the establishment of the Shaws Road Gaeltacht community, the expanse in the Irish language arts, and the advancements made in the availability of Irish medium education throughout the city, it can now be said that there is a 'mother-tongue' community of speakers.[tpl]Dubious|date=November 2010[/tpl] The language is heavily promoted in the city and is particularly visible in the Falls Road area, where the signs on both the iconic black taxis and on the public buses are bilingual.www.forbairtfeirste.com Belfast has the highest concentration of Irish speakers in Northern Ireland.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] Projects to promote the language in the city are funded by various sources, notably Foras na Gaeilge, an all-Ireland body funded by both the Irish and British governments. There are a number Irish language Primary schools and one secondary school in Belfast. The provision of certain resources for these schools (for example, such as the provision of textbooks) is supported by the charitable organisation TACA.
