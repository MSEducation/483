Dothan (Hebrew: [tpl]hebrew|דֹתָן[/tpl]) (also, Dothaim) was a city located at north of Shechem, and about 100 km north of Hebron. Eusebius places it 12 miles to the north of Sebaste (Samaria). It has been identified with Tel Dothan located ten kilometers (driving distance) southwest of Jenin, near Dotan Junction of Israel Route 60.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~semitic/wl/digsites/Cisjordan/Dothan_02/ |title=Tel Dothan 2002 Overview |author=Daniel M.

It is first mentioned (Genesis 37:17) in connection with the history of Joseph where, at the suggestion of Judah, the brothers sold Joseph to the Ishmaelite merchants (Gen. 37:17). It later appears as the residence of Elisha (2 Kings 6:13) and the scene of a vision of chariots and horses of fire surrounding the mountain on which the city stood.
The modern Israeli settlement of Mevo Dotan's name, approach to Dothan, is derived from its nearby location. Dothan, Alabama is also named after the Biblical city.
