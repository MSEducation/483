==History==

Tarbikha was located on the site of the Crusaders Tayerebika, from which it derived its name.
In 1596, Tarbikha was part of the Ottoman Empire, nahiya (subdistrict) of Tibnin under the Liwa of Safad, with a population of 88. It paid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat, olives and barley, as well as on goats, beehives and a press that was used for processing either olives or grapes.Hütteroth, Wolf-Dieter and Kamal Abdulfattah (1977), Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century. Erlanger Geographische Arbeiten, Sonderband 5. Erlangen, Germany: Vorstand der Fränkischen Geographischen Gesellschaft. p. 183. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 33
In the late nineteenth century, the village of Tarbikha was described as being built of stone and situated on a ridge. The population was estimated at being around 100, and they lived by cultivating olives.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP, Vol. I, p.150. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 33 During this period Tarbikha was a part of the Beirut province. Only after World War I, when the borders between Lebanon and Palestine were delineated by the British and French, did Tarbikha come under Palestinian administration.Khalidi, 1992, p.33
The village had two mosques, and an elementary school, founded after 1938, which had an enrollment of 120 students in the mid-1940s. It also had a cusoms office and a police station for monitoring the Lebanese border. In 1944/45 the village had a total of 3,200 dunums allocated to cereals, while 619 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards.Hadawi, 1970, p.81Khalidi, 1992, p. 33-34

===1948 war and aftermath===

The town was assaulted during Operation Hiram by the Oded Brigade on 30 October 1948.Morris, 2006, p. 474 The population was ordered to leave for Lebanon in early November.Morris 2006, pp 506-507 The military did not let the Arabs gather the crops they planted; rather the military allowed the Jews of the kibbutz Tarbikha to gather the crops and left the villages unguarded, which allowed any passerby access to the items in the unguarded village.[tpl]Citation |title= Dynamite in the Middle East|last= Totah |first= Khalil |year=1955 |publisher= Philosophical Library|isbn= |page= 192[/tpl] The village lands of Tarbikha were settled by Jewish immigrants from Hungary and Romania as part of the policy of Judaisation of Northern Israel.Morris, 2006, p 381-382: By mid-June 1949, Yehoshua Eshel wrote, the whole northern border area had been Judaised through the ‘absorption settlements’-moshavim and development towns - such as at Tarshiha, Suhmata, Deir al Qasi, Tarbikha, Meirun, Sammu’i, Safsaf, Ras al Ahmar’.
The Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, described the village remaining structures in 1992: "About twenty houses from the village are now occupied by the residents of Moshav Shomera. Some of the roofs have been remodeled and given a gabled form. Stones from the original houses embellish the roof of the central shelter of the moshav."Khalidi, 1992, p. 34
In 1994, the refugees from the seven villages, who had been classified as Palestinian refugees since 1948, were granted Lebanese citizenship.Peteet, 2005, p. 177
