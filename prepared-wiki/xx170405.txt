[[Donald Bradman in popular culture]]

CATEGORIES: Topics in popular culture, Donald Bradman

The appearances of former Australian cricketer Don Bradman in popular culture are many and varied. As a player, he first came to prominence during the 1928-29 season.  His record-breaking performances on the 1930 tour of England made him a national hero in Australia. 
Ironically, Bradman was a private person who did not enjoy the adulation associated with his fame. In cricket, a batsman who enjoys an exceptional run of form over an extended period is sometimes called Bradmanesque.The Times of IndiaYorkshire PostPakistan News Service 
Bradman's name has become a generic term for outstanding excellence, both within cricket and in the wider world.  The mathematician, G. H. Hardy, an avid cricket fan, once declared the German mathematician David Hilbert "the Don Bradman of mathematics".

A popular story is that Sir Charles Moses, General Manager of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and personal friend of Bradman asked that Bradman's Test batting average be immortalised as the post office box number of the ABC. The ABC's mailing address in every capital city of Australia is PO Box 9994. There is some debate about whether the story is true, but ABC sports host Karen Tighe confirms that the number was in fact chosen in honour of Bradman, and the claim is also supported by Alan Eason in his book The A-Z of Bradman.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www2.abc.net.au/openday/forums/sport/posts/187.shtm |title=Online Forum |publisher=ABC[/tpl]  However, the broadcaster was not assigned the box number until after Moses's successor, Sir Talbot Duckmanton, had retired.[ref]
