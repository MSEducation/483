==Song information==

"Deception Pass" and "Underide" both appear on previously released singles. The remaining four tracks are all brand new and unique to the EP.allmusic ((( Five Dollar Bob's Mock Cooter Stew > Overview )))
The four new songs feature a very diverse selection of music from "In the Blood" with its 'mid-range pace' to "Six To One" which demonstrates the band's grunge origins. "No Song III" manages to illustrate Dan Peters' "sharp drumming flair", while "Between You and Me Kid"'s slight country sound foreshadows Mudhoney's future, where a year later, they collaborated with Jimmie Dale Gilmore.allmusic ((( Five Dollar Bob's Mock Cooter Stew > Overview )))

==Criticism==

Trouser Press speculates that recording Piece of Cake took a lot out of the band as Five Dollar Mock Cooter Stew is described as "a dull, dopey mishmash of suburban-boy backwoodsiness" and overall is a lackluster effort.[tpl]cite web | last =| first =| title = Mudhoney | publisher = TrouserPress.com | url = http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=mudhoney| accessdate = 2007-01-07[/tpl]

==Album inlay information==

In the liner notes, producer Kurt Bloch is listed as 'Curt' and 'Kurdt' Bloch on two separate occasions. This mistake is actually a joke, referring to frontman of the band Nirvana, Kurt Cobain, who often intentionally misspelled his named as Kurdt Cobain.allmusic ((( Five Dollar Bob's Mock Cooter Stew > Overview )))
