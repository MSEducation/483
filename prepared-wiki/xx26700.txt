Born in Montmorillon, Vienne, Deforges is sometimes called the High Priestess of French erotic literature. Deforges was the first woman to own and operate a publishing house in France. Over the years, she has been censored, prosecuted, and heavily fined for publishing "offensive" literature (Louis Aragon: Irene's Cunt). [tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
One of her novels, La Bicyclette bleue (The Blue Bicycle), published in 1981, was France's biggest bestseller. In 2000, it was made into a television series. A story of love, obsession, and survival set during the turmoil of World War II, it developed into a successful series of seven books.http://www.phdn.org/antisem/antision/shamirdeforges.htmlhttp://books.google.be/books?id=Ykb2mOQkOeYC&pg=PT50&lpg=PT50&dq=r%C3%A9gine+deforges+israel+shamir&source=bl&ots=uKjMJaM4fe&sig=UUrrrVp6Z3WCb1fyZljoDmiLeVc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Fd8-U7CzK6f-ygPIjICIDQ&ved=0CHQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=r%C3%A9gine%20deforges%20israel%20shamir&f=false She was formerly president of the Société des Gens de Lettres de France and a member of the Prix Femina jury.
