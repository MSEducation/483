DiC Entertainment (pronounced "deek", rendered "DiC") was an international film and television production company.  In addition to animated (and occasionally live-action) television shows such as Inspector Gadget (1983–1986), Madeline (1993-1994),  Sonic the Hedgehog (1993-1994), Sabrina, The Animated Series, (1999-2000), Liberty's Kids (2002-2003), Super Duper Sumos (2002-2003), Strawberry Shortcake (2003-2008) and Trollz (2005-2006) DIC produced live-action feature films while under Disney, including 1998's Meet the Deedles and 1999's Inspector Gadget.
It was founded in 1971 as DIC Audiovisuel by Frenchman Jean Chalopin in Paris, as a subsidiary of RTL Group (RTL), Europe's leading entertainment company, which today, is majority-owned by German media conglomerate Bertelsmann.  "DIC" was originally an acronym for Diffusion, Information et Communication. They later had a US office in Burbank. Andy Heyward then bought the business and DiC became an American company.  The company was also known as The Incredible World of DiC, DiC. Audiovisuel, DiC Enterprises,  DIC Animation City and DIC Productions. In 2008, DIC and Cookie Jar Group merged, and the DIC name ceased to exist.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cjar.com/press/cj_press_20080723a.php|title=COOKIE JAR ENTERTAINMENT EXPANDS BRAND PORTFOLIO, TALENT AND GLOBAL REACH WITH CLOSING OF DIC TRANSACTION |work=Cookie Jar Group |date=2008-07-23 |accessdate=2008-12-20[/tpl] In late 2012, DHX Media acquired DIC for $111 million dollars, and DIC now operates an in-name-only unit of DHX Media.

==History==

===1980s===

DIC Entertainment's American arm was founded in 1982 as DIC Enterprises, headed by Andy Heyward, Jean Chalopin and Bruno Bianchi, in Burbank, California.
In 1985, DIC opened their own Japan-based satellite animation facility for animation production on some of their shows (such as the second seasons of Inspector Gadget and Heathcliff, among other shows), so they wouldn't have to mostly deal with other overseas animation subcontractors.
In 1986, Heyward and other investors bought the company, thus making the US headquarters the main base of operations.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117786555.html?categoryid=18&cs=1&query=|title=Bain backing buyout of DIC|date=Sep 18, 2000|work=Variety|accessdate=2009-08-15 | first=Carl | last=DiOrio[/tpl] Chalopin and Bianchi left around this time, so did formal producer Tetsuo Katayama, in favor of Robby London and Michael Maliani.
After the buyout, the company was in heavy debt and the foreign rights to the DIC library were sold to Saban Productions, who then sold the rights back to Chalopin.[tpl]cite news|title=Haim Saban, producer, in Hollywood, Washington, Israel|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/05/10/100510fa_fact_bruck?currentPage=3|accessdate=May 28, 2010|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=May 10, 2010|page=3|page=12[/tpl] At the time, Heyward considered Chalopin an enemy, despite the fact that he took over the company from Chalopin to begin with.
