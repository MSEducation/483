"Turn My Head" is a song by alternative rock group Live, which was released as a single from their 1997 album, Secret Samadhi. In contrast to the hard-rock of most of the album, the song is slower paced and features a string section.
The song was not released as single in the US, but following radio play, which saw it reach #45 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart, it peaked at #3 on both the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock Tracks charts."Secret Samadhi > Charts & Awards > Billboard Singles" Allmusic
