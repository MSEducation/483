As ESPN described the game, "Sam Keller nearly gave away the game during his first road start at Nebraska. Zack Bowman jumped up to take it back for the Cornhuskers.  Three plays after Keller threw an interception deep in Nebraska territory, Bowman picked off a Wake Forest pass in the end zone and the 16th-ranked Cornhuskers held on to win 20–17 on Saturday."[tpl]cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=272510154|title=No. 16 Nebraska hangs on to beat Wake Forest|work=ESPNU.com|publisher=The Disney Company|date=September 8, 2007|accessdate=September 8, 2007[/tpl]

After a bye week, the Trojans visited the Nebraska Cornhuskers in Lincoln, Nebraska.  In the pre-season, the game was named as one of the candidates for the 10 most important games of 2007.

Callahan had been criticized for his conservative play-calling during the 2006 game in Los Angeles; instead of playing to win, it appeared the Huskers were playing to not get blown out by the then-favored Trojans.  In that game the normally prolific West Coast offense of Nebraska, which had produced 541 yards a game, was corralled on the ground and attempted only 17 passes in a 28–10 Husker loss.  For 2007, Callahan pledged to play more aggressively, using running back Marlon Lucky and quarterback Sam Keller.[tpl]cite news |title=USC vs. the Red Sea|first=Gary|last=Klein|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/15/sports/sp-usc15|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 15, 2007|accessdate=July 2, 2008[/tpl]  Keller, the Huskers redshirt senior starting quarterback, was a 2006 transfer from Arizona State; as a Sun Devil Keller started the first seven games of his 2005 junior season, throwing for 2,165 yards, before a disastrous game against USC where, after leading ASU to a 21–3 halftime lead, he and the offense fell apart on the way to a 38–28 loss where he was sacked five times and threw five interceptions.Braff, Carolyn (August 21, 2007) Running A Reverse, CSTV.com, Retrieved July 2, 2008.

The Trojans did not escape injuries, as linebacker Clay Matthews, substituting for the recovering Brian Cushing, broke his thumb, causing Cushing to enter the game as his replacement.

Nebraska first played the Texas Longhorns in 1933 and the Longhorns hold a 7–4–0 record.  Nebraska won the first meeting by the lopsided score of 26–0.  As with Oklahoma State and Texas A&M, Nebraska plays the Longhorns two out of every four years as part of the Big 12 Conference schedule.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.big12sports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/121906aaa.html|title=Big 12 Releases Future Football Conference Schedules|publisher=Big 12 Conference|date=December 19, 2006|accessdate=April 2, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070331215842/http://www.big12sports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/121906aaa.html|archivedate=March 31, 2007[/tpl]  Since their first meeting, the series has included a number of upsets and close calls.  In 1960 a #4 ranked Longhorn squad was upset by an unranked Nebraska team, 14–13.  In 1996 an unranked Texas team defeated #3 ranked Nebraska (who were also the defending national champions) 37–27 to win the inaugural Big 12 Conference football championship and deprive the Cornhuskers a shot at repeating as national champions.  In 1998 an unranked Texas team beat #7 Nebraska 20–16.
In 1999 the two teams met twice.  In the regular season, #18 Texas beat #3 Nebraska by 24–20. However, #3 Nebraska beat #12 Texas in the Big 12 Championship game, 6–22.  In 2002 the Longhorns were ranked No. 7 and they went to Lincoln, Nebraska to play an unranked Nebraska team.

The Longhorns may have switched to running game almost by chance.  McCoy took a hard hit as he scrambled outside the pocket and was shaken up badly enough to leave the game for a play.  John Chiles came in at quarterback; his one play, a zone-read handoff to Jamaal Charles, produced 24 yards.  According to ESPN, “suddenly Texas had figured out how to beat a Cornhuskers' team that had been steamrolled on the ground in recent weeks. Texas only threw three passes in the fourth quarter.”
Once Texas switched to the zone read offense, they quickly started gaining yards and points.  Charles ran for a career-high 290 yards, including 216 yards and three long touchdown runs in the fourth quarter.  His tally also set a new record for rushing against the Cornhuskers, surpassing the old record of 247 yards by Oklahoma’s Billy Simms.  Charles explained "It was my time to show everyone what I can do.  When I saw a hole, I blasted through it."  Texas finished with 181 yards passing and 364 yards rushing; Nebraska had 315 yards passing and 132 yards rushing.[tpl]cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=273000251|title=Nebraska 25, (19) Texas 28: Box Score|publisher=ESPN|publisher=The Disney Company|date=October 27, 2007|accessdate=March 10, 2008[/tpl]  The running back was named the Walter Camp Football Foundation National Offensive Player of the Week.[tpl]cite news |title=Stay Calm: Brown Won’t Pull a ‘Gundy’ Soon|first=Cody|last=Hale|url=http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2007/10/30/Sports/Stay-Calm-3064450.shtml|newspaper=The Daily Texan|publisher=Texas Student Mendia|date=October 30, 2007|accessdate=March 10, 2008[/tpl]
The game was a milestone for one coach and a millstone for another; it was the 100th win for Mack Brown at Texas; and it put more pressure on beleaguered Nebraska coach Bill Callahan.  Brown remarked on his victory, “A hundred is nice.  I knew the game was going to come down like it did.  It didn’t surprise me.  They made sure that I’ll remember it the rest of my life.”  Callahan was fired five weeks later.[tpl]cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3125379|title=Nebraska Fires Callahan|publisher=ESPN|publisher=The Disney Company|date=November 24, 2007|accessdate=March 10, 2008[/tpl]

Fox Sports reported, "It was only the second victory for Kansas in the last 39 games against Nebraska, which appears to be coming to pieces in the fourth season of embattled coach Bill Callahan."

===Kansas State===

Getting just his second career start after taking over for the injured Sam Keller in the fourth quarter of the Texas game, Joe Ganz broke the school single-game records for passing yards and touchdowns.

===Colorado===

It was a must-win situation for both teams, as they had identical 5–6 records and each needed a win to get to a bowl. Although they trailed by 11 points at the half, Colorado went on to win 65–51, as the Husker defense simply could not find an answer for Colorado's offense. Husker Coach Bill Callahan, having had his second losing season in four years, both being decided by a loss to Colorado, was fired the day after the game. Athletic Director Tom Osborne went on to hire Mark "Bo" Pelini as Head Coach.[tpl]-[/tpl]

==After the season==

The team was coached by Bill Callahan, who returned for his fourth year with the Huskers, and expectations for the season were high, considering NU had reached the Big 12 title game the previous year. But the Huskers recorded only their second losing season since 1961, and the second in four years (the last one coming in 2004 on Callahan's watch). Following the conclusion of the season, Callahan was fired by interim athletic director Tom Osborne.[tpl]cite news |title=Source: Interim Nebraska AD Osborne fires Callahan|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3125379|accessdate=November 24, 2007|date=November 24, 2007|first=Joe|last=Schad|publisher=ESPN[/tpl]
