[[Caesalpinioideae]]

CATEGORIES: Caesalpinioideae, Plant subfamilies

Caesalpinioideae is a botanical name at the rank of subfamily, placed in the large family Fabaceae or Leguminosae. Its name is formed from the generic name Caesalpinia.
The Caesalpinioideae are mainly trees distributed in the moist tropics. Their flowers are zygomorphic, but are very variable. Nodulation is rare in this subfamily, and where it does occur nodules have a primitive structure.
Because the Papilionoideae and Mimosoideae arose from within the Caesalpinioideae,[tpl]cite web | url = http://tolweb.org/Fabaceae/21093/2006.06.14 | title = Fabaceae | author = Martin F. Wojciechowski, Johanna Mahn, and Bruce Jones | year = 2006 | work = The Tree of Life Web Project [/tpl] the Caesalpinioideae is paraphyletic.  Therefore, it is likely to be split into several subfamilies, although it is not yet clear what those subfamilies should be.
In some classifications, for example the Cronquist system, the group is recognized at the rank of family, Caesalpiniaceae.
The subfamily may be classified in four tribes, Caesalpinieae, Cassieae, Cercideae and Detarieae. The tribe Cercideae has sometimes been included in the subfamily Faboideae (aka Papilionoideae) in the past.

==Phylogenetics==

Caesalpinioideae, as traditionally circumscribed, is paraphyletic. Several molecular phylogenies have shown that the other two subfamilies of Fabaceae (Faboideae and Mimosoideae) are both nested within Caesalpinioideae.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bruneau A, Mercure M, Lewis GP, Herendeen PS. |year=2008 |title=Phylogenetic patterns and diversification in the caesalpinioid legumes |url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/B08-058#.UuA5hLTnaUl |journal=Botany |volume=86 |issue=7 |pages=697–718 |doi=10.1139/B08-058 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Cardoso D, Pennington RT, de Queiroz LP, Boatwright JS, Van Wykd B-E, Wojciechowskie MF, Lavin M. |year=2013 |title=Reconstructing the deep-branching relationships of the papilionoid legumes |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254629913002585 |journal=S.
