Westwood Elementary, formerly Westwood School is a historic school building in the Westwood neighborhood of Cincinnati, Ohio.

==History==

The school building was constructed in 1909 replaced an earlier school building built in 1870 on the same grounds. The 1909 school was designed by prominent Cincinnati architect Frederick W. Garber's Garber & Woodward architectural firm.  The building's 100th birthday was celebrated in the spring of 2009. The original floor plans were published in Modern School Houses, Part Two by The American Architect in 1915.
It was remodeled several times and a major renovation is underway.  
The building us in a district listed on the National Register of Historic Places and controversy over additions and their impact on community views emerged in 2007 and 2009 over the renovation plans. The design and location of a gymnasium and whether the renovation itself was cost effective or whether it would be better to demolish the school and build a new one have been debated. Access concerns for persons with mobility limitations were also addressed.[ref]Lucy May Three neighborhoods, one gripe about Cincinnati Public Schools: arrogance May 1 (modified May 4), 2009
Business Courier of Cincinnati[/ref][ref]"A recommendation has been made to tear down the current Westwood Elementary School and replace it with a new building at Harrison and Montana avenues."... "When the Cincinnati Public Schools rebuilding program was announced in 2001, the plan called for a new Westwood Elementary School at a new location. The community protested and was able to secure a waiver to allow renovation of the stately structure that's been a Westwood fixture for years."
