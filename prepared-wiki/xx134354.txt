==Career==

A tough-tackling centre half, McAndrew began his career at Middlesbrough in 1973, where he established himself at the heart of defence. Later becoming captain – and the club's youngest scorer of a hat-trick when playing as an emergency striker – he was at Ayresome Park for almost ten years, before leaving for Chelsea when Middlesbrough were relegated from the First Division in 1982.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.mfc.premiumtv.co.uk/articles/tony-mcandrew-1973-82-and-1984-86-20020201_70674_444494 |title=Tony McAndrew 1973-82 and 1984-86 |publisher=Middlesbrough F.C |accessdate=16 November 2009[/tpl] He also spent a summer in the North American Soccer League playing for the Vancouver Whitecaps.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nasljerseys.com/Players/M/McAndrew.Tony.htm |title=North American Soccer League Players |publisher=Dave Morrison |work=NASL Jerseys |accessdate=16 November 2009[/tpl]
He returned to Middlesbrough in 1984, and played for the club for a further two years, before being released in the summer of 1986 as they almost went out of business. After brief spells at Darlington, Hartlepool United, and in non-league football with Willington and Billingham Synthonia, McAndrew joined the coaching staff at Darlington under manager Brian Little. He worked alongside Little at Leicester City, Aston Villa, and Stoke City, before returning to Aston Villa in 1999 as a youth coach.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/6475529.stm |title=Where are they now? |publisher=BBC Sport |first1=Nathan |last1=Mercer |first2=Owen |last2=Phillips |date=13 April 2007 |accessdate=16 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/aston-villa-fc/aston-villa-news/2008/03/19/tony-mcandrew-hails-his-aston-villa-special-ones-97319-20645261/ |title=Tony McAndrew hails his Aston Villa 'special' ones |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |first=Bill |last=Howell |date=19 March 2008 |accessdate=16 November 2009[/tpl] He led Villa's youth team to victory in the FA Youth Cup in 2002.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1995546.stm |title=Villa lift FA Youth Cup |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 May 2002 |accessdate=16 November 2009[/tpl]
