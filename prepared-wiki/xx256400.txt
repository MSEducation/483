Termoli railway station ([tpl]lang-it|Stazione di Termoli[/tpl]) serves the town and comune of Termoli, in the region of Molise, southern Italy.  Opened in 1864, it forms part of the Adriatic Railway (Ancona–Lecce) and is also a terminus for the line to Venafro, linking the comuni of Molise with both the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian seas.
The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI).  However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni.  Train services are operated by Trenitalia.  Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company.

==Location==

Termoli railway station is situated at Piazza Giuseppe Garibaldi, close to the city centre.

==History==

The station was opened to the public on 25 April 1864, simultaneously with the Ortona–Foggia section of the Adriatic Railway.[tpl]cite web| author=Alessandro Tuzza and others| url=http://www.trenidicarta.it/aperture.html| title=Prospetto cronologico dei tratti di ferrovia aperti all'esercizio dal 1839 al 31 dicembre 1926| trans_title=Chronological overview of the features of the railways opened between 1839 and 31 December 1926|work=Trenidicarta.it |publisher=Alessandro Tuzza| accessdate=26 December 2010[/tpl] [tpl]it icon[/tpl]  Earlier, on 9 November 1863, King Victor Emmanuel II had officially opened the section between Pescara and Foggia, by setting forth aboard a special train, on track that had been hurriedly completed especially for the event.
On 12 March 1882, the station became a junction station, upon the opening of the first section of the Termoli–Venafro railway, between Termoli and Larino.

==Features==

The station has two passenger buildings.  One of them is the original structure, and the other was built in the 1980s.
The configuration of the original passenger building is fairly typical for Italian railway stations.  The original building is constructed of brick, and is made up of three sections.  Its middle section has three levels, while the other two sections, extending laterally from each side of the middle section, are both single storey structures.
To the south (or Foggia/Campobasso) side of this main building are other, smaller, buildings used for storage.
Attached to the north (or Pescara) side of the original building is the second building, which evidently has much more modern architectural lines than the first, and represents a sharp contrast with the surrounding buildings.  It was built of reinforced concrete, and it has tinted glass windows.
Passenger facilities at the station are: ticket office, cafeteria, waiting rooms, elevators, toilets, bar, newsagent, pharmacy and the office of the Railway Police.
The station yard has five tracks with platforms for passenger traffic.  Each platform is accessible from the others by an underpass, which also functions as a pedestrian link between two parts of the city: Viale Trieste and Piazza Garibaldi (or station square).
 

==Renovations==

In October 2010, work was completed on the modernization of the facade of the passenger building overlooking Piazza Garibaldi and its waiting rooms and interior passages.
Due to the poor condition of the areas used for the accommodation of people waiting for trains, intervention was required at the front of the building housing the ticket office and offices, along with modernization work and a new coat of paint.
Additionally, the platform facing the Adriatic Railway was raised to a height of [tpl]convert|50|cm[/tpl], thus allowing easier access to trains by reducing the gap in height between the platform surface and that of the carriage floors.
There was also some restoration work done to some of the platform shelters.
The work took about five months to complete.

==Passenger and train movements==

The station has about 780,000 passenger movements each year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.centostazioni.it/flussi.html |title=Flussi Annui nelle 103 Stazioni|trans_title=Annual flows at the 103 stations|author= |date= |work=Centostazioni website |publisher=Centostazioni |accessdate=4 December 2010[/tpl] [tpl]it icon[/tpl]  It has a catchment area that encompasses almost all of Molise.
All InterCity and Eurostar trains passing through the station stop there.   The station is also served by many regional trains.  The main destinations for trains leaving Termoli are Foggia, Campobasso, Pescara and, recently, Teramo.  Until a few years ago, there were also direct trains to Naples and Rome.
