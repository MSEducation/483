In April 2009, Sony Pictures Japan released a mostly Japanese language film version of Rain Fall starring Shiina Kippei as Rain and Gary Oldman as Rain's nemesis, CIA Station Chief William Holtzer.
Eisler made news in March 2011 when he walked away from a reported half million dollar advance from St. Martin's Press in order to go the self-publishing route pioneered by his colleague Joe Konrath and others.[tpl]cite web|last=Pinter|first=Jason|title=Why I'm Self-Publishing|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/03/24/barry-eisler-explains-self-publishing-decision.html|publisher=The Daily Beast|accessdate=12 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=National Public Radio|title=Barry Eisler's 'Detachment' From 'Legacy' Publishing|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/10/07/141116856/barry-eislers-detachment-from-legacy-publishing|work=Morning Edition|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=12 April 2012[/tpl] He then took a six-figure deal to publish his latest John Rain novel (The Detachment) under Amazon's Thomas & Mercer mystery imprint.[tpl]cite web|last=O'Brien|first=Jenny|title=Thriller author Barry Eisler signs with Amazonâ€™s Thomas & Mercer imprint|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/2011/05/thriller-author-barry-eisler-signs.html?page=all|work=Puget Sound Business Journal|publisher=Puget Sound Business Journal|accessdate=13 April 2014[/tpl]
