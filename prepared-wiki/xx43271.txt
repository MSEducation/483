[tpl]nihongo|Subaru Telescope|すばる望遠鏡|Subaru Bōenkyō[/tpl] is the 8.2 metre flagship telescope of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, located at the Mauna Kea Observatory on Hawaii. It is named after the open star cluster known in English as the Pleiades. It had the largest monolithic primary mirror in the world from its commission until 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/hitech/subaru/index.html |title=The Subaru Telescope |publisher=web-japan.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-22[/tpl]

==Overview==

Subaru is a Ritchey-Chretien reflecting telescope.  Instruments can be mounted at a Cassegrain focus below the primary mirror, in enclosures on either of two Nasmyth focal points on the sides of the telescope mount, to which light can be directed with a tertiary mirror, or, in an arrangement rare on large telescopes, at the prime focus, in lieu of a secondary mirror, to provide a wide field of view suited to deep wide-field surveys.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.subarutelescope.org/Introduction/telescope.html |title=Specifications |publisher=Subaru Telescope" |date= |accessdate=2010-09-22[/tpl]
In 1984, the University of Tokyo formed an engineering working group to study the concept of a 7.5-metre telescope.  In 1985, the astronomy committee of Japan's science council gave top priority to the development of  a "Japan National Large Telescope" (JNLT), and in 1986, the University of Tokyo signed an agreement with the University of Hawaii to build the telescope in Hawaii.  In 1988, the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan was formed through a reorganization of the University's Tokyo Astronomical Observatory, to oversee the JNLT and other large national astronomy projects.[tpl]Citation |url=http://optik2.mtk.nao.ac.jp/~iye/papers/iye208.pdf |title=Current Performance and On-Going Improvements of the 8.2m Subaru Telescope |arxiv=astro-ph/0405012 |journal=Publ.

Construction of the telescope began in April 1991, and later that year, a public contest gave the telescope its official name, "Subaru Telescope."  Construction was completed in 1998, and the first scientific images were taken in January 1999.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.naoj.org/NAOJ/history.html |title=A Brief History of Subaru |publisher=Naoj.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-22[/tpl]  In September 1999, Princess Sayako of Japan dedicated the telescope.[tpl]cite web|last=French |first=Howard W. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/19/world/on-hawaii-a-telescope-widens-orbit-of-japanese.html |title=On Hawaii, A Telescope Widens Orbit Of Japanese |location=Japan; Hawaii; Mount Mauna Kea (Hawaii) |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1999-09-19 |accessdate=2010-09-22[/tpl]
A number of state-of-the-art technologies were worked into the telescope.  For example, 261 computer-controlled actuators press the main mirror from the back to correct its distortion when the telescope changes its orientation. The telescope enclosure building is also shaped to minimize air turbulence, to improve the quality of astronomical images.
Subaru is one of the few state-of-the-art telescopes to have ever been used with the naked eye.  For the dedication, an eyepiece was constructed so that Princess Sayako could look through it directly.  It was enjoyed by the staff for a few nights until it was replaced with the much more sensitive working instruments.[tpl]Citation |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2009/07/telescopes/ferris-text |title=Cosmic Vision |journal=National Geographic |date=July 2009 |first=Timothy |last=Ferris |accessdate=1009-09-13[/tpl]

===Accidents during construction===

Two separate incidents claimed the lives of four workers during the construction of the telescope.  On October 13, 1993, 42-year-old Paul F. Lawrence was fatally injured when a forklift tipped over onto him.  On January 16, 1996, sparks from a welder ignited insulation which smoldered, generating noxious smoke that killed Marvin Arruda, 52, Ricky Del Rosario, 38, and Warren K. "Kip" Kaleo, 36, and sent twenty-six other workers to the hospital in Hilo.  All four workers are memorialized by a plaque outside the base of the telescope dome and a sign posted temporarily each January along the Mauna Kea access road.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hotspotshawaii.com/H4archs/NewsC.txt|title=The H4 Hawaii Times|publisher=Ryan Ozawa|date=1996-01-17|accessdate=2011-11-23[/tpl]

===Mishap in 2011===

On July 2, 2011, the telescope operator in Hilo noted an anomaly from the top unit of the telescope. Upon further examination, coolant from the top unit was found to have leaked over the primary mirror and other parts of the telescope.[tpl]cite web|url=http://subarutelescope.org/Announce/2011/07/04/report1.html |title=Serious Hardware Incident with the Subaru Telescope Interrupts Its Operation |publisher=web-subarutelescope.org/ |date= |accessdate=2011-07-05[/tpl]
Observation using Nasmyth foci resumed on July 22, and Cassegrain focus resumed on August 26.[tpl]cite web |url=http://subarutelescope.org/Announce/2011/07/04/report4.html |title=Report 4: Resumption of Open Use Observations at Cassegrain Focus |date=September 13, 2011 |author=National Astronomical Observatory of Japan |accessdate=September 23, 2011[/tpl]

==Instruments==

Several cameras and spectrographs can be mounted at Subaru Telescope's four focal points for observations in visible and infrared wavelengths.

==Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics system==

The Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics system (SCExAO) is a high-contrast imaging system for directly imaging of exoplanets. The coronagraph uses a Phase Induced Amplitude Apodization (PIAA) design which means it will be able to image planets closer to their stars than conventional Lyot type coronagraph designs. For example at a distance of 100 pc, the PIAA coronagraph on SCExAO would be able to image from 4 AU outwards while Gemini Planet Imager and VLT-SPHERE from 12 AU outwards.Jovanovic, N., Martinache, F., Guyon, O., Clergeon, C., Singh, G., Kudo, T., Vievard, S., Newman, K., Minowa, Y., Hayano, Y., Kuhn, J., Serabyn, E., Norris, B., Tuthill, P., Stewart, P., Huby, E., Perrin, G., Lacour, S., Murakami, N., Fumika, O., 2014, "SCExAO as a precursor to an ELT exoplanet direct imaging instrument", The system also has several other types of coronagraph: Vortex, Four-Quadrant Phase Mask and 8-Octant Phase Mask versions, and a shaped pupil coronagraph.http://www.naoj.org/Projects/SCEXAO/index.html The phase I of construction is completeSCExAO Science ready Capabilities and phase II construction to be complete by end of 2014SCExAO Future Capabilities for science operations in 2015. SCExAO will initially use the HiCIAO camera but this will be replaced by CHARIShttp://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3586 around 2016.
