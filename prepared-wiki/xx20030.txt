CATEGORIES: Populated places in Lochaber

Back of Keppoch (Gaelic: CÃ¹l na Ceapaich) is a small coastal settlement in the north west Scottish Highlands, approximately 40 miles west of Fort William near to the A830 road to Mallaig.
The Back of Keppoch is just north of Arisaig and south of Morar. Most of the houses on this road are crofts which double up as campsites in the summer months. A number of attractive beaches line the road.
