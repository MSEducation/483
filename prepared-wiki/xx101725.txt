[[Peptidomimetic]]

CATEGORIES: Molecular biology

A peptidomimetic is a small protein-like chain designed to mimic a peptide.  They typically arise either from modification of an existing peptide, or by designing similar systems that mimic peptides, such as peptoids and Î²-peptides.  Irrespective of the approach, the altered chemical structure is designed to advantageously adjust the molecular properties such as, stability or biological activity.  This can have a role in the development of drug-like compounds from existing peptides.  These modifications involve changes to the peptide that will not occur naturally (such as altered backbones and the incorporation of nonnatural amino acids).

==D-peptide peptidomimetics==

A D-peptide is a small sequence of D-amino acids.  Since ribosomes are specific to L-amino acids, D-peptides rarely occur naturally in organisms and are not easily digested or degraded. D-peptide peptidomimetics are D-peptides designed to mimic natural L-peptides that commonly have therapeutic properties.
