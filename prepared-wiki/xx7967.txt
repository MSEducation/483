Megadeth is an American thrash metal band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1983 by guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassist David Ellefson, shortly after Mustaine's dismissal from Metallica. In 1985, the group released its debut album through Combat Records, an independent record label. The album's moderate commercial success caught the attention of bigger record labels, and they soon signed to Capitol Records. Their first major label album, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?, was released in October 1986, and is considered highly influential in the underground metal scene. Despite the album being prominent to thrash metal, frequent disputes between the band members and issues with drug abuse earned the band negative publicity during this period.
After stabilizing their lineup, Megadeth released a number of platinum-selling albums, including Countdown to Extinction, certified double platinum. This album, along with touring worldwide, aided in bringing Megadeth to public recognition. In 2002, Megadeth temporarily disbanded when Mustaine suffered an arm injury; the band re-established in 2004, performing without bassist David Ellefson as he had taken legal action against Mustaine. Ellefson rejoined the group in 2010, and has been featured on all recordings since. In the summer of 2005, Megadeth launched its own music festival, Gigantour, which has been hosted several times over the years.
Megadeth is known for its distinctive, technical instrumental style that often features fast rhythm sections and complex arrangements; their lyrics convey gloomy themes including death, war, politics, and religion. The group has experienced controversy over its musical approach and lyricism, including canceled concerts and album bans. MTV has refused to play two of the band's videos the network considered to condone suicide. The band's mascot, Vic Rattlehead, has regularly appeared on the album artworks, and from 2010, at the band's live shows as well.
A pioneer of the American thrash metal scene, the band is credited as one of the genre's "big four" along with Anthrax, Metallica and Slayer, who were responsible for thrash metal's creation, development, and popularization. As of 2014, Megadeth has released fourteen studio albums, six of them certified platinum in the United States. To date, Megadeth has sold 50 million records worldwide and received eleven Grammy nominations, and ranks as one of the most successful American heavy metal bands.

==History==

===Early days (1983–84)===

Dave Mustaine was the original lead guitarist for Metallica when they formed in 1981. He was member of the band for nearly a year and participated in composing their early songs. However, before the start of the recording sessions of Metallica's debut album, Mustaine was dismissed from the band because of his substance abuse and personal conflicts with members James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich.[tpl]sfn|Gulla|2009|p=101[/tpl] Two months after being fired, Mustaine and bassist David Ellefson formed Megadeth in Los Angeles, California. With his new band, Mustaine's intention was to play faster and heavier music than his Metallica.[tpl]sfn|Wagner|2010|p=42[/tpl]
According to Mustaine, the name Megadeth represents the annihilation of power,[tpl]cite web|last=Summers|first=Jodi Beth|date=June 1987|title=Out to Lunch|work=Hit Parader|publisher=Rockmetal.art.pl|url=http://megadeth.rockmetal.art.pl/interviews_hitparader1987.html|accessdate=November 15, 2013[/tpl] while it is in itself a misspelling of the term megadeath.[tpl]sfn|Moore|2009|p=103[/tpl] The band name came from a pamphlet by Californian senator Alan Cranston that Mustaine found on the floor of a bus he was on after being fired from Metallica. In it, he read, "The arsenal of megadeath can't be rid no matter what the peace treaties come to."[tpl]sfn|Mustaine|2011|p=87[/tpl]
Despite his enthusiasm, Mustaine had trouble finding additional members for the band's initial lineup. Upon starting the band, he and Ellefson had examined about 15 drummers, hoping to find one who comprehended the meter changes in music. In the meantime, Kerry King from Slayer took duties on lead guitar.[tpl]cite web|last=Doe|first=Bernard|title=Megadeth – Love It To Death|url=http://www.metalforcesmagazine.com/site/feature-megadeth-mf12/|work=Metal Forces|date=December 1985|accessdate=November 13, 2013[/tpl] They eventually selected drummer Lee Rauch, and after unsuccessfully searching for a lead vocalist for six months, agreed to make Mustaine the lead vocalist. Mustaine also served as the band's main lyricist and songwriter, in addition to handling rhythm and lead guitar duties.[tpl]sfn|Prown & Newquist|1997|p=227[/tpl]
In 1984, Megadeth recorded a three-song demo tape, featuring Mustaine, Ellefson and Rausch. The demo contained early versions of "Last Rites/Loved to Death", "Skull Beneath the Skin", and "Mechanix", all of which eventually appeared on their debut studio album. The band performed in concert a few times in 1984, before replacing Rausch with jazz fusion drummer Gar Samuelson. They added guitarist Chris Poland as a full-time member in December that year.[tpl]sfn|Wagner|2010|p=42[/tpl] After looking at a few labels, frontman Dave Mustaine decided to sign with New York-based independent label Combat Records because they offered him the highest budget for recording their album and starting a promotional tour.

===Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! (1985)===

In 1985, the band was given $8,000 by Combat Records to record and produce its debut album. After spending half of the album's budget on drugs, alcohol, and food, the band was forced to fire their original producer and finish the recording duties themselves.[tpl]cite web|last=Byrne|first=Suzy|title=Total Recall: David Ellefson Reflects on 30 Years of Megadeth, Including His Biggest Regret|url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/music-news/total-recall--david-ellefson-reflects-on-30-years-of-megadeth--including-his-biggest-regret-222638483.html|publisher=Yahoo! Music|date=December 6, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2013[/tpl] This situation negatively affected the sound quality of the record.[tpl]sfn|Ellefson & McIver|2013|p=55[/tpl] Despite poor production, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! was released that summer. The album was relatively successful in underground metal circles and caught the attention of major record labels.[tpl]sfn|Bukszpan|2003|p=242[/tpl] Despite the overall "foggy" sound, music biographer Joel McIver praised its "blistering technicality" and acknowledged that the album "raised the bar for the whole thrash metal scene, with guitarists forced to perform even more accurately and powerfully".[tpl]sfn|McIver|2008|p=Chapter 7[/tpl] The record's cover saw the debut of the band's mascot, Vic Rattlehead, who would make regular appearances on the cover art of the following studio albums.[tpl]cite web|title=Megadeth: The Making Of The New 'Vic Rattlehead' Mask|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/megadeth-the-making-of-the-new-vic-rattlehead-mask-video/|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=October 2, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2013[/tpl]
The album features "Mechanix", a song Mustaine had written during his tenure with Metallica. After he was dismissed from the band, Mustaine told them not to use the music he had written. Despite this, Metallica recorded a different version of the song entitled "The Four Horsemen", with a slower tempo and a melodic middle section.[tpl]cite web|first=Josh|last=Hart|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/dave-mustaine-early-days-metallica-i-had-always-called-us-four-horsemen|title=Dave Mustaine on Early Days With Metallica: "I Had Always Called Us the 'Four Horsemen'"|work=Revolver|publisher=Guitar World|date=August 15, 2011|accessdate=November 16, 2013[/tpl] Another track from the album that drew controversy was Megadeth's version of Nancy Sinatra's classic "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'", recorded at a faster pace with altered lyrics. The cover sparked controversy during the 1990s when the its original author, Lee Hazlewood, deemed Mustaine's changes to be "vile and offensive" and demanded the song be removed from the album.[tpl]cite book|title=Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good liner notes (2002 reissue)|year=2002|publisher=Loud Records|page=8[/tpl] Under threat of legal action, it was removed from the pressings released between 1995 and 2001.[tpl]cite web|last=Begrand|first=Adrien|publisher=PopMatters|date=April 30, 2002|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/megadeath-killing/|title=Megadeth: Killing is My Business... and Business is Good!|accessdate=November 16, 2013[/tpl] In the summer of 1985, the group toured in North America for the first time, supporting Killing Is My Business... with Exciter. Guitarist Chris Poland joined Megadeth as the tour began, but abruptly left the band and was replaced by touring guitarist Mike Albert. Poland later rejoined Megadeth in October 1985, shortly before they began working on their second album for Combat Records.[tpl]sfn|Ellefson & McIver|2013|p=58[/tpl]

===Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? (1986–87)===

The songs on Megadeth's second studio album were written and developed before the band began recording. Dave Mustaine had composed the music, while the other members helped with some ideas on the arrangements.[tpl]sfn|Tarquin|2012|p=72[/tpl] The songs were written in a relatively short period at an old warehouse south of Los Angeles.[tpl]sfn|Ellefson & McIver|2013|p=58[/tpl] According to Mustaine, the band was under great pressure to deliver another successful record at the time: "That sophomore offering is the 'be-all or end-all' of any band. You either go to the next level, or it's the beginning of the nadir."[tpl]cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|title=Megadeth's Dave Mustaine says he and Metallica have hugged out|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-08-20/entertainment/ct-ott-0820-megadeth-20100820_1_metallica-thrash-metal-megadeth|accessdate=November 17, 2013|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=August 15, 2010[/tpl]
Megadeth's second studio album was produced using a small recording budget provided by Combat Records. Not satisfied with the financial limitations of their current label, Megadeth soon left Combat and signed with Capitol Records. Capitol bought the rights to their upcoming album and hired producer Paul Lani to remix the earlier recordings. Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? was recorded with a budget of $25,000 and released in the fall of 1986.[tpl]sfn|Ellefson & McIver|2013|p=61[/tpl] It contained clearer studio production and more sophisticated songwriting.[tpl]sfn|Konow|2009|p=243[/tpl] This record was noted for its political commentary and saw Megadeth expanding their fanbase.[tpl]sfn|Talevski|2010|p=570[/tpl] Mustaine explained that Megadeth tried to write socially-aware lyrics, unlike mainstream heavy metal bands who were singing about "hedonistic pleasures".[tpl]cite news|last=Matsumoto|first=Jon|date=October 16, 1986|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-10-16/entertainment/ca-5888_1_metal-band|title=Megadeth: These Heavy Metalers Thrash For Peace|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=November 15, 2013[/tpl] The title track was chosen as the album's lead single and was accompanied by a music video. It received regular airplay on MTV and was noted by music critics for its cynicism towards the economic situation in the United States.[tpl]sfn|Moore|2009|p=102[/tpl]
In February 1987, Megadeth was added as the opening band on Alice Cooper's Constrictor tour.[tpl]cite news|last=Popson|first=Tom|date=February 6, 1987|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-02-06/entertainment/8701100234_1_peace-sells-megadeth-dave-mustaine|title=Megadeth Hed To Go Here|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=November 15, 2013[/tpl] In March, Megadeth began their first world tour as a headlining act in the United Kingdom. The tour continued in the United States with Overkill and Necros as the supporting acts and lasted for 72 weeks.[tpl]sfn|Rees & Crampton|1999|p=658[/tpl] During the tour, Mustaine and Ellefson considered firing Samuelson because of his excessive drug abuse.[tpl]sfn|Konow|2009|p=244[/tpl] Mustaine claimed that Samuelson had become too much to handle when intoxicated. Drummer Chuck Behler traveled with the band for the last dates of the tour because the other members were afraid that Samuelson would not be able to continue touring.
Meanwhile, guitarist Chris Poland had occasional quarrels with Mustaine, because he was accused of selling the band's equipment to buy heroin.[tpl]sfn|Konow|2009|p=244[/tpl] Due to problems stemming from substance abuse and problematic behavior, Samuelson and Poland were asked to leave Megadeth in June 1987.[tpl]sfn|Rees & Crampton|1999|p=658[/tpl] The same year, then 16-year-old guitarist Jeff Loomis of Sanctuary, auditioned following the departure of Chris Poland. Afterwards, Mustaine complimented Loomis on his playing, but rejected him because of his age.[tpl]cite web|author=EvilG|title=Nevermore Interview With Jeff Loomis|url=http://metal-rules.com/interviews/Nevermore-July2003.htm|publisher=Metal Rules|accessdate=November 18, 2013[/tpl] Poland was initially replaced by Jay Reynolds of Malice, but as the band began working on their next record, Reynolds was replaced by his guitar teacher, Jeff Young, by which time Megadeth were six weeks into the recording of their third album.[tpl]cite web|first=Celesete|last=Gomes|title=So Far, So Good For Megadeth|url=http://megadeth.rockmetal.art.pl/interviews_rock1988.html|work=Classic Rock|publisher=Rockmetal.art.pl|date=August 1988|accessdate=November 8, 2013[/tpl]

===So Far, So Good... So What! (1988–89)===

With a major label recording budget, the recording of the Paul Lani-produced So Far, So Good... So What! took over five months. It was notorious for the various problems that occurred during the production, partially due to Mustaine's ongoing struggle with addiction. Mustaine later said, "The production of So Far, So Good... So What! was horrible, mostly due to substances and the priorities we had or didn't have at the time." Mustaine also clashed with Lani on several occasions, beginning with Lani's insistence that the drums be recorded separately from the cymbals, an unheard-of process for rock drummers.[tpl]cite book|title=So Far, So Good... So What! liner notes (2004 reissue)|year=2004|publisher=Capitol Records|page=2[/tpl] During mixing, Mustaine and Lani became estranged, and Lani was replaced by producer Michael Wagener, who remixed the album.[tpl]sfn|Ellefson & McIver|2013|p=71[/tpl]
So Far, So Good... So What! was released in January 1988 and was well received by fans and critics.[tpl]cite web|last=Christgau|first=Robert|title=Consumer Guide Reviews|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=megadeth|work=The Village Voice|year=1987|accessdate=December 6, 2013[/tpl] The album featured a cover version of the Sex Pistols' "Anarchy in the UK", with lyrics altered by Mustaine, who later admitted to simply hearing them incorrectly. To support the album, Megadeth embarked on a world tour, opening for Dio in Europe in February 1988,[tpl]sfn|Rees & Crampton|1999|p=546[/tpl] and later joining Iron Maiden's 7th Tour of a 7th Tour in the United States. In August 1988, Megadeth appeared at the renowned Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington in the United Kingdom performing to an audience of 107,000 people. One of these shows also featured Metallica drummer (and Mustaine's former bandmate) Lars Ulrich, who made a guest appearance. The band was soon added to the "Monsters of Rock" European tour, but left after the first show due to Ellefson's drug problems, for which he was treated immediately.[tpl]sfn|Ellefson & McIver|2013|p=72[/tpl]
Shortly after their Monsters of Rock appearance, Mustaine fired both Behler and guitarist Young and canceled their scheduled 1988 Australian tour. "On the road, things escalated from a small border skirmish into a full-on raging war", Mustaine later recalled, "I think a lot of us were inconsistent the 1988 tour because of the guy we were waiting for after the show."[tpl]cite web|last=Niles|first=Eric|title=Rust in Peace|url=http://megadeth.rockmetal.art.pl/interviews_musicconnection1990.html|work=Music Connection|publisher=Rockmetal.art.pl|date=September 1990|accessdate=December 8, 2013[/tpl] During the tour, Mustaine had been noticing problems developing with Behler and brought drummer Nick Menza in to act as Behler's drum technician. As with Gar Samuelson before him, Menza was to be ready to take over for Behler in the event that he could not continue with the tour. Menza became Behler's replacement in July 1989.[tpl]sfn|Kajzer & Lotring|2010|p=192[/tpl]
Young's dismissal resulted from Mustaine's suspicions that he was having an affair with Mustaine's girlfriend at the time, an allegation denied by Young.[tpl]cite web|last=Dome|first=Malcolm|title=Megadeth Bitching: Mustaine And Young At War!|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/megadeth-bitching-mustaine-and-young-at-war/|work=Classic Rock|date=December 21, 2009|accessdate=December 8, 2013[/tpl] The band was unable to quickly find a suitable replacement for Young. During this time, Megadeth recorded a cover version of Alice Cooper's "No More Mr. Nice Guy" as a three-piece band. The song later appeared on the soundtrack to the 1989 Wes Craven horror movie Shocker.[tpl]sfn|Buckley|2003|p=660[/tpl] The video for this song was directed by Penelope Spheeris, who recalled that filming the video was a "Herculean task" since Mustaine was unable to play guitar because of his drug abuse.[tpl]sfn|Bukszpan|2003|p=244[/tpl]
In June 1988, Megadeth appeared in Spheeris' documentary film The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years.[tpl]sfn|Bukszpan|2003|p=244[/tpl] The documentary chronicled the Los Angeles heavy metal scene of the late 1980s, mostly focusing on glam metal.[tpl]sfn|Unterberger & Hicks|1999|p=416[/tpl] Mustaine later recalled the movie as a disappointment, aligning Megadeth with "a bunch of shit bands".[tpl]cite web|title=Megadeth: Rusted Pieces VHS|publisher=Capitol Records/EMI|date=January 1, 1991[/tpl] While auditions for the new lead guitarist were being held in March 1989, Mustaine was arrested for driving while intoxicated and possessing narcotics after crashing into a parked vehicle occupied by an off-duty police officer.[tpl]sfn|Janosik|2006|p=97[/tpl] He entered court-ordered drug rehabilitation soon after and became consistently sober for the first time in ten years.[tpl]sfn|Bukszpan|2003|p=244[/tpl]

===Rust in Peace (1990–91)===

After Mustaine found sobriety, Megadeth continued their search for a new lead guitarist. Among those who auditioned were Lee Altus of Heathen and Eric Meyer of Dark Angel. Meyer had been invited to join the band following Chris Poland's departure, but declined in order to remain in Dark Angel.[tpl]cite web|last=Willems|first=Steven|title=Interview With Dark Angel|url=http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/Interviews/DARK-ANGEL--6917.html|publisher=Voices From The Dark Side|date=December 4, 2000|accessdate=March 7, 2014[/tpl] Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash had been jamming with Mustaine and Ellefson and, though it seemed that he was being drafted into Megadeth, he remained with Guns N' Roses.[tpl]sfn|Ellefson & McIver|2013|p=79[/tpl] Dimebag Darrell Abbott of Pantera was also offered the job; Abbott, however, said he would not join the band without his brother, Pantera drummer Vinnie Paul Abbott. Having already hired Nick Menza, the band was forced to turn Abbott down.[tpl]cite web|title=Dave Mustaine: Kerry King Hates My Guts|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/dave_mustaine_kerry_king_hates_my_guts.html|work=Blabbermouth.net|publisher=Ultimate-Guitar.com|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=November 18, 2013[/tpl]
Marty Friedman filled the empty guitarist position in Megadeth. Friedman was recommended by Ron Laffitte, a member of Capitol management. Laffitte had heard Dragon's Kiss, a solo recording by Friedman during his tenure in Cacophony. Mustaine and Ellefson were satisfied with Marty's playing style and thought he understood the nature of Megadeth's music.[tpl]sfn|Ellefson & McIver|2013|p=88[/tpl] With Friedman in the group, the band completed what fans considered to be the "definitive" version of Megadeth.[tpl]sfn|Kajzer & Lotring|2010|p=320[/tpl] A revitalized Megadeth entered Rumbo Studios in March 1990 with co-producer Mike Clink to begin working on what would become their most critically acclaimed album to date, Rust in Peace. For the first time in their career, the band remained sober while working in the studio, alleviating many of the problems they had recording previous albums. Clink was also the first producer to successfully produce a Megadeth album from start to finish without being fired. The recording of the album was documented in Rusted Pieces, a home video released in 1991 which contained six music videos and a filmed interview with the band members.[tpl]sfn|Rubiner|1993|p=167[/tpl]
Released worldwide on September 24, 1990, Rust in Peace was critically acclaimed, debuting at number 23 in the United States and number 8 in the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/artistinfo.php?id=5007|title=Chart Stats – Megadeth|work=Chart Stats|accessdate=February 24, 2013[/tpl] Mustaine's writing style adopted a rhythmically complex progressive edge, with songs which contained longer guitar solos and frequent tempo changes.[tpl]sfn|Pillsbury|2006|p=82[/tpl] Described as a genre-defining work by Decibel,[tpl]cite web|title=Megadeth "Rust in Peace"|work=Decibel|url=http://www.decibelmagazine.com/hall-of-fame/megadeth/|accessdate=December 8, 2013[/tpl] the album confirmed Megadeth's reputation in the music industry.[tpl]sfn|Prown & Newquist|1997|p=227[/tpl] It featured the singles "Holy Wars...

Early in 1990, Slayer had an idea to do a major tour featuring American thrash metal bands. Megadeth accepted, and in October 1990, they joined Slayer, Testament and Suicidal Tendencies for the European Clash of the Titans tour.[tpl]sfn|McIver|2008|p=Chapter 13[/tpl] Following the success of the European installment, an American leg commenced in May 1991, featuring Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax, with Alice in Chains as a supporting act. This tour was considered to be a multi-headliner, since all three bands would alternate time slots.[tpl]sfn|Harrison|2011|p=60[/tpl] Apart from the Clash of the Titans tour, Megadeth played alongside Judas Priest in North America late in 1990, and appeared at the second Rock in Rio, which was held in January 1991.[tpl]sfn|Ellefson & McIver|2013|p=101[/tpl]

===Countdown to Extinction (1992–93)===

The recording sessions for Megadeth's fifth studio album started in January 1992 at Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California. Max Norman was chosen to produce the album, as the band was pleased with his mixing of Rust in Peace.[tpl]cite book|title=Countdown to Extinction liner notes (Japanese edition)|year=1992|publisher=Capitol Records|pages=3–5, 7–8, 10[/tpl] The band spent nearly four months in the studio with Norman, writing and recording what became Megadeth's most commercially successful effort, Countdown to Extinction.[tpl]cite news|last=Herrmann|first=Brenda|title=Megadeth – Countdown to Extinction (Capitol)|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-07-30/features/9203080461_1_star-countdown-extinction|accessdate=December 8, 2013|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=July 30, 1992[/tpl] The album, whose title was suggested by drummer Nick Menza, features songwriting contributions from each band member.[tpl]cite web|last=Prince|first=Patrick|title=Megadeth fully embraces "Countdown" anniversary|work=Goldmine|url=http://www.goldminemag.com/article/megadeth-fully-embraces-countdown-anniversary|date=November 19, 2012|accessdate=November 17, 2013[/tpl] Ellefson explained that the band changed their approach to songwriting on this album, and started to write songs that were more melodic: "Our new mission was to create music that had more of a groove to it. Marty Friedman's writing was very melodic anyway, and the vocal lines moved into that direction, too, assisted by Max Norman, our producer."[tpl]sfn|Ellefson & McIver|2013|p=103[/tpl]
Released on July 6, 1992, Countdown to Extinction entered the Billboard 200 chart at number two, and was eventually certified double platinum for shipping two million copies in the United States.[tpl]sfn|Joyner|2002|p=301[/tpl] The record saw similar success overseas and helped to develope a larger following for Megadeth outside the US.

A world tour in support of the album was launched in December 1992 with Pantera and White Zombie as the supporting acts.[tpl]sfn|Ellefson & McIver|2013|p=106[/tpl] The tour included a North American leg in January 1993 with opening act Stone Temple Pilots. One month into the leg, all remaining shows, including dates scheduled in Japan, were cancelled when Mustaine returned to substance abuse, ending up in a hospital emergency room.[tpl]cite web|last=Chirazi|first=Steffan|title=Trial by Fire|url=http://megadeth.rockmetal.art.pl/interviews_rip1993.html|work=RIP|publisher=Rockmetal.art.pl|date=October 1993|accessdate=December 8, 2013[/tpl] After a seven-week stint in rehab, Mustaine emerged clean once again, and the band returned to the studio to record "Angry Again".

During the summer of 1993, Megadeth performed at a number of shows with Metallica at European venues. The first show was at Milton Keynes Bowl in England, which also included Diamond Head.[tpl]sfn|Ellefson & McIver|2013|p=106[/tpl] In July, Megadeth was added as the opening act for Aerosmith's Get a Grip Tour, but were removed from the bill after fewer than six shows. Aerosmith stated that they had "dumped" Megadeth because of Mustaine's erratic behavior, while Megadeth's label Capitol explained that the band was dropped due to "artistic restrictions".[tpl]cite journal|author=Spin staff|title=Clash of the Quasi-Titans|journal=Spin|date=October 1993|volume=9|page=36|url=http://books.google.com/?id=fsi_VCMy0tQC&pg=PA36&dq=megadeth+aerosmith+tour#v=onepage&q=megadeth%20aerosmith%20tour&f=false|accessdate=November 18, 2013[/tpl] Following their canceled US tour, Megadeth returned to the studio to record "99 Ways to Die", a song that appeared on The Beavis and Butt-head Experience, a compilation album released in November 1993 that featured songs intercut with commentary by the eponymous main characters of the animated series Beavis and Butt-head.

===Youthanasia (1994–95)===

Early in 1994, Megadeth reunited with producer Max Norman to begin work on the follow-up to Countdown to Extinction. With three members of the band now residing in Arizona, initial work began at Phase Four Studios in Phoenix.[tpl]sfn|Larkin|1995|p=2777[/tpl] A few days into pre-production, problems with Phase Four's equipment forced the band to look for an alternative studio. Mustaine insisted on recording in Arizona, but no suitable recording facility could be found. At the request of co-producer Norman, the band opted to construct their own recording studio inside a rented warehouse in Phoenix, Arizona, later dubbed "Fat Planet in Hangar 18".[tpl]cite book|title=Youthanasia liner notes (2004 remaster)|year=2004|publisher=Capitol Records|pages=2, 24–25[/tpl] While the studio was being constructed, much of the pre-production songwriting and arrangements took place at Vintage Recorders in Phoenix.[tpl]sfn|Rees & Crampton|1999|p=658[/tpl] At the advice of Max Norman, the tracks featured on Youthanasia were recorded at a slower tempo than on previous records, approximately 120 beats per minute.[tpl]sfn|Ellefson & McIver|2013|p=118[/tpl] The band had abandoned the progressive elements from their previous records and focused on stronger vocal melodies and more accessible, radio-friendly arrangements.[tpl]cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=Megadeth: Youthanasia|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/youthanasia-mw0000119424|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=December 8, 2013[/tpl] For the first time in their career, the band wrote and arranged the entire album in the studio, including basic tracks recorded live by the whole band. The album's recording was filmed on video and released in 1995 under the title Evolver: The Making of Youthanasia.[tpl]cite web|title=Megadeth: Evolver – Making of Youthanasia (1995)|url=http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/204135/Megadeth-Evolver-Making-of-Youthanasia/overview|work=New York Times|accessdate=December 9, 2013[/tpl]

Live support for Youthanasia began in South America in November 1994 and spanned eleven months, becoming Megadeth's most extensive tour to date. Throughout 1995, the band visited Europe and North America, joined by a number of opening acts, including Corrosion of Conformity, Korn, and Fear Factory.[tpl]cite web|title=The Killing Road – A History Of Megadeth's Opening Acts|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/exclusive-the-killing-road-a-history-of-megadeth-s-opening-acts|publisher=Roadrunner Records|date=February 2, 2012|accessdate=December 9, 2013[/tpl] The tour culminated in an appearance at the Monsters of Rock festival in Brazil, co-headlining alongside Alice Cooper and Ozzy Osbourne.[tpl]cite web|title=History|url=http://www.megadeth.com/history|publisher=Megadeth.com|accessdate=December 9, 2013[/tpl] In January 1995, Megadeth appeared on the soundtrack of the horror movie Tales from the Crypt Presents: Demon Knight with the song "Diadems".[tpl]cite web|last=Henderson|first=Alex|title=Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight (Original Soundtrack)|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tales-from-the-crypt-demon-knight-original-soundtrack-mw0000627023|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=December 9, 2013[/tpl] In July, the band released Hidden Treasures, an extended play featuring songs that originally appeared on movie soundtracks and tribute albums.[tpl]cite news|last=Golemis|first=Dean|date=November 9, 1995|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-11-09/features/9511090296_1_sabbath-bedtime-guitar|title=Megadeth: Hidden Treasures (Capitol)|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=December 11, 2013[/tpl]

===Cryptic Writings (1996–98)===

Following an expansive world tour in support of Youthanasia, Megadeth took time off late in 1995. Mustaine began work on MD.45, a side project with vocalist Lee Ving of Fear; the duo hired drummer Jimmy DeGrasso, who had been playing in Alice Cooper's band for the South American Monsters of Rock tour earlier that year.[tpl]cite web|last=Prato|first=Greg|title=MD.45 – Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/md45-mn0000219971|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=December 10, 2013[/tpl] Additionally, Marty Friedman constructed a studio in his new home in Phoenix and started working on a solo project, resulting in his fourth studio album, which was released in April 1996.
In September 1996, Megadeth went to London to work on songs for their next album, tentatively titled Needles and Pins. The writing was closely supervised by their new manager, Bud Prager, who also contributed musical ideas and lyrics to the songs; many lyrics and song titles were changed at his request. Regarding Prager's writing influence, Mustaine later wrote, "I figured maybe this guy Prager could help me get that intangible number one record I so badly wanted." Due to a problem with the album's original artwork, the album cover was replaced with a voodoo symbol and the album was renamed Cryptic Writings.[tpl]cite AV media notes|title=Cryptic Writings|type=CD liner notes|others=Megadeth|year=1997|publisher=Capitol Records[/tpl]
Cryptic Writings was released in June 1997 through Capitol Records. The album peaked at number 10 on the Billboard 200, and was Megadeth's sixth consecutive studio album to be certified platinum in the United States. Its lead single, "Trust", became Megadeth's highest charting song on the Mainstream Rock Tracks, reaching number five.[tpl]cite web|title=Megadeth – Chart History (Songs) – second page|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/310366/megadeth/chart?page=1&f=376|work=Billboard|accessdate=December 10, 2013[/tpl] "Trust" was also nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1998 Grammy Awards.[tpl]cite journal|author=Billboard staff|title=40th Annual Grammy Awards: Final Nominations|journal=Billboard|date=January 17, 1998|page=78|url=http://books.google.com/?id=rg0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA78&dq=trust+megadeth+best+metal+performance#v=onepage&q=trust%20megadeth%20best%20metal%20performance&f=false|accessdate=December 10, 2013[/tpl] Even though all four singles from the album entered the top 20 on Billboards Mainstream Rock Tracks,[tpl]cite web|title=Cryptic Writings – Megadeth – Charts|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/cryptic-writings-mw0000023863/awards|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=December 10, 2013[/tpl] press response to the album was mixed. The Los Angeles Times noted the album for carrying diverse compositions, and described it as a "rousing balance" between their older material and some experimental tunes.[tpl]cite news|last=Masuo|first=Sandy|date=June 29, 1997|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-06-29/entertainment/ca-7946_1_pop-music|title=In Brief: ** Megadeth, "Cryptic Writing," Capitol.|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=December 10, 2013[/tpl] When asked about the eclectic nature of the album, Mustaine explained that the record was divided into thirds: "One part of the record was really fast and aggressive, one third of it was the really melodic, in between stuff, and the final third was really radio-orientated music like Youthanasia."[tpl]cite web|last=Wiederhorn|first=Jon|title=Last Men Standing|url=http://megadeth.rockmetal.art.pl/interviews_guitarworld1998.html|work=Guitar World|publisher=Rockmetal.art.pl|date=June 1998|accessdate=December 10, 2013[/tpl]
After more than a year since their last concert, Megadeth returned as a live act in June 1997, beginning a world tour with the Misfits and later touring in the United States with Life of Agony and Coal Chamber. In July, Megadeth participated in Ozzfest '98 but, halfway through the tour, drummer Nick Menza reportedly discovered a tumor on his knee and was forced to leave for surgery.[tpl]cite web|author=Metal Sludge administrator|title=20 question with ex-Megadeth drummer Nick Menza|url=http://www.metalsludge.tv/?p=28655|publisher=Metal Sludge|date=March 12, 2002|accessdate=November 15, 2013[/tpl] Jimmy DeGrasso, who had previously collaborated with Mustaine in MD.45, was hired in Menza's place for the remainder of the tour.[tpl]cite web|title=Nick Menza: "I Was Fired From Megadeth Two Days After Surgery"|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/nick-menza-i-was-fired-from-megadeth-two-days-after-surgery/|work=RockRage|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=February 19, 2002|accessdate=December 10, 2013[/tpl] Though he was initially meant to be a temporary replacement, DeGrasso joined the band permanently after the conclusion of the tour. Mustaine later said that he dismissed Menza from the band because he had lied about having cancer.

===Risk (1999–2000)===

Following the band's success on mainstream radio with Cryptic Writings, Megadeth opted to work again with country pop producer Dann Huff in Nashville, Tennessee on its eighth studio album. In January 1999, the band began writing a new album, which was also to be supervised by manager Bud Prager, who was credited with co-writing five of the album's twelve songs.[tpl]cite book|title=Risk liner notes|year=1999|publisher=Capitol Records|pages=2–5, 9, 11, 13, 15[/tpl] With high expectations following the chart success of "Trust", Mustaine was convinced by Prager to grant Huff even more control over the album's recording, a decision Mustaine later regretted, saying that it "backfired".[tpl]cite web|last=Hjelm|first=Fredrik|title=It Wasn't Fun Anymore|url=http://megadeth.rockmetal.art.pl/interviews_shockwaves2001.html|work=Shockwaves Online|publisher=Rockmetal.art.pl|year=2001|accessdate=December 10, 2013[/tpl]
Risk, released on August 31, 1999, was both a critical and commercial failure and led to backlash from many longtime fans. Although its two predecessors had incorporated rock elements alongside a more traditional heavy metal sound, Risk was virtually devoid of metal.[tpl]cite web|last=Stagno|first=Mike|title=Megadeth: Risk|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/9218/Megadeth-Risk/|publisher=Sputnikmusic|date=September 19, 2006|accessdate=December 11, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=Risk – Megadeth|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/risk-mw0000244020|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=December 9, 2013[/tpl] Speaking about their musical direction from this period, Dave Mustaine said: "We hit the nadir of our career with Risk, and I vowed after that we were going to get back to our roots.

On July 22, 1999, former drummer Gar Samuelson died at the age of 41 in Orange City, Florida, of liver failure. Three days later, during Megadeth's performance at Woodstock 1999, Mustaine dedicated the song "Peace Sells" in Samuelson's memory.[tpl]cite web|title=Megadeth perform "Peace Sells" at Woodstock 1999|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l81YyDBeiUs|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=December 10, 2013[/tpl] In July 1999, Megadeth recorded a cover version of the Black Sabbath song "Never Say Die" which appeared on the second Nativity in Black tribute album.[tpl]sfn|Rosen|2011|p=92[/tpl] They began their world tour in support of Risk in September, playing alongside Iron Maiden during the European leg.

In April, Megadeth returned to the studio to start working on their ninth studio release. However, one month into production, the band was given the opportunity to join the Maximum Rock tour alongside Anthrax and Mötley Crüe. Megadeth put recording on hold and toured North America throughout the second quarter of 2000. Early into the tour, Anthrax was removed from the bill, allowing Megadeth to play an extended co-headlining set.

===The World Needs a Hero (2000–01)===

After working together for 15 years, Megadeth left Capitol Records in July 2000. According to Dave Mustaine, their departure was about to happen because of the ongoing tensions between the band and Capitol management.[tpl]cite news|last=Baird|first=Kirk|title=Acerbic Mustaine explains Megadeth's metal issues|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2001/sep/14/acerbic-mustaine-explains-megadeths-metal-issues/|accessdate=December 7, 2013|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|date=September 14, 2001[/tpl] The label returned their newest recordings to the band and, in return, released a greatest hits record called Capitol Punishment: The Megadeth Years, which featured two new tracks, "Kill the King" and "Dread and the Fugitive Mind".[tpl]cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=Capitol Punishment: The Megadeth Years|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/capitol-punishment-the-megadeth-years-mw0000104229|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=December 5, 2013[/tpl] In November 2000, Megadeth signed with their new label Sanctuary Records.

The World Needs a Hero was released on May 15, 2001, and debuted at number 16 on the Billboard 200; however, the album was banned in Malaysia after the national government determined that the album's artwork was "unsuitable for the nation's youth". As a result, Megadeth cancelled its planned concert on August 2 in the country's capital, Kuala Lumpur.[tpl]cite web|title=Fans To Choose Set Lists For U.S. Megadeth Trek|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/78874/fans-to-choose-set-lists-for-us-megadeth-trek|work=Billboard|date=August 6, 2001|accessdate=December 7, 2013[/tpl] Musically, the album marked the band's return to a more aggressive sound after the stylistic variations of their previous two records, but some critics felt the album fell short of expectations.[tpl]cite web|last=Engels|first=John|title=Review – The World Needs a Hero|date=June 14, 2001|url=http://www.orlandoweekly.com/music/review.asp?rid=2359|work=Orlando Weekly|accessdate=December 7, 2013[/tpl] Mustaine compared the album to the first major turn of a huge ship at sea, trying to right itself and get back on course. The album's lead single, "Moto Psycho", reached number 22 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.
Touring in support of The World Needs a Hero began in the summer of 2001 in Europe alongside AC/DC, followed by an American tour with Iced Earth and Endo in September. Mustaine decided to let the fans choose the setlist in each American city they visited. The tour, however, was cut short following the September 11 attacks; consequently, the band was forced to cancel all scheduled dates, including a DVD shoot in Argentina. Instead, the band played two shows in Arizona on November 16 and 17, which were filmed and later released as Rude Awakening, Megadeth's first official live release.[tpl]sfn|Ellefson & McIver|2013|p=139[/tpl] That year, Megadeth's first album, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!, was remixed and remastered using modern techniques; the reissue featured modified artwork and several bonus tracks.[tpl]sfn|Ellefson & McIver|2013|p=218[/tpl]

===Breakup (2002–03)===

In January 2002, Mustaine was admitted to the hospital for the removal of a kidney stone. While undergoing treatment, he was administered pain medication that triggered a relapse of his addiction. Following his stay at the hospital, Mustaine immediately checked himself into a treatment center in Texas. While at the treatment center, Mustaine suffered a peculiar injury causing severe nerve damage to his left arm. The injury, induced by falling asleep with his left arm over the back of a chair, caused compression of the radial nerve. He was diagnosed with radial neuropathy, also known as Saturday night palsy, which left him unable to grasp or even make a fist with his left hand.[tpl]cite web|work=Billboard|title=Injury Forces Mustaine To Disband Megadeth|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/76247/injury-forces-mustaine-to-disband-megadeth|date=April 3, 2002|accessdate=November 25, 2013[/tpl]

Following nearly a year of recovery, including physical and electric shock therapy, Mustaine began work on what was to be his first solo album. The new material was recorded with session musicians Vinnie Colaiuta and Jimmy Sloas in October 2003, but the project was put on hold when Mustaine agreed to remix and remaster Megadeth's eight-album back catalog with Capitol Records.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|title=Dave Mustaine: 'I Am And Always Will Be Megadeth'|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dave-mustaine-i-am-and-always-will-be-megadeth/|date=July 12, 2003|accessdate=November 25, 2013[/tpl] Mustaine re-recorded some parts that were lost over time or altered without his knowledge in the initial mixing.[tpl]cite web|last=Ayers|first=Chris|title=Megadeth: Remixed and Remastered Series|url=http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/Metal/megadeth-remixed_remastered_series|work=Exclaim!|date=March 2005|accessdate=December 13, 2013[/tpl]

===The System Has Failed (2004)===

In May 2004, Mustaine returned to his newest recordings, intended as a solo effort. However, due to outstanding contractual obligations with the band's European label, EMI, he was forced to release it as a Megadeth album instead.[tpl]cite web|last=Nalbandian|first=Bob|title=Dave Mustaine Interview|date=August 28, 2004|publisher=Hard Radio|url=http://www.hardradio.com/shockwaves/mustaine6.php3 Hard Radio.com|accessdate=November 19, 2006[/tpl] Subsequently, Mustaine decided to reform the band, and contacted the fan favorite Rust in Peace lineup to re-record backing tracks on his latest songs. While drummer Nick Menza initially agreed to return, both Marty Friedman and Dave Ellefson were unable to come to an agreement with Mustaine. Menza was dismissed shortly after he began rehearsing with the band again; Mustaine stated that he was not prepared enough and "it just didn't work out". Menza was sent home a few days before the start of the tour in support of Megadeth's upcoming album.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/megadeth-s-mustaine-says-nick-menza-wasn-t-prepared-to-tour-with-the-band/|title=Megadeth's Mustaine Says Nick Menza Wasn't Prepared To Tour With The Band|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=November 16, 2004|accessdate=December 3, 2013[/tpl]
Regarding longtime bassist Ellefson's departure, Mustaine claimed that Ellefson slandered him, said that his arm injury was fake, and lied about him to the press. Although Mustaine did make him an offer, Ellefson declined.[tpl]cite web|title=Dave Mustaine Explains Why David Ellefson Is Not In Megadeth Anymore|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dave-mustaine-explains-why-david-ellefson-is-not-in-megadeth-anymore/|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=July 10, 2004|accessdate=March 5, 2014[/tpl] The resulting album was the first Megadeth recording to not feature Ellefson. Original lead guitarist Chris Poland, who performed on Megadeth's first two studio albums, was hired by Mustaine to contribute to the guitar solos of the new album; this was the first time the two had worked together since Poland's dismissal from the band in the 1980s. Poland opted to serve only as a session musician, wanting to remain focused on his jazz fusion project, OHM.[tpl]cite web|last=Gitter|first=Mike|title=Where Are They Now?

On September 14, 2004, Megadeth released The System Has Failed on Sanctuary Records in the United States and EMI in Europe. It was heralded as a return to form by critics; Revolver gave the album a favorable review, calling it "Megadeth's most vengeful, poignant and musically complex offering since 1992's Countdown to Extinction".[tpl]cite web|title=Megadeth: The System Has Failed|url=http://www.megadeth.com/release/system-has-failed|work=Revolver|publisher=Megadeth.com|accessdate=December 4, 2013[/tpl] This record marked a sonic shift towards the band's earlier sound; journalist Amy Sciarretto of CMJ New Music Report wrote that The System Has Failed contained "neo-thrash riffing with biting, politically charged lyrics".[tpl]cite journal|last=Sciarretto|first=Amy|title=Genre Focus – Megadeth; The System Has Failed|journal=CMJ New Music Report|date=September 13, 2004|page=22|url=http://books.google.com/?id=pcY5T_TgSEUC&pg=PA22&dq=megadeth+cmj+report#v=onepage&q=megadeth%20cmj%20report&f=false|accessdate=November 22, 2013[/tpl] The album debuted at number 18 on the Billboard 200,[tpl]cite web|title=Megadeth – Chart History (Albums)|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/310366/megadeth/chart?f=305|work=Billboard|accessdate=December 4, 2013[/tpl] and was led by the radio single "Die Dead Enough", which reached number 21 on the US Mainstream Rock chart.[tpl]cite web|title=Megadeth – Chart History (Songs)|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/310366/megadeth/chart?f=376|work=Billboard|accessdate=December 4, 2013[/tpl] Mustaine announced that the album would be the band's last and would be followed by a farewell tour, after which he would focus on a solo career.[tpl]cite web|title=Dave Mustaine Discusses Going Solo, Dimebag, Kerry King And Metallica|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dave-mustaine-discusses-going-solo-dimebag-kerry-king-and-metallica/|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=February 11, 2005|accessdate=December 4, 2013[/tpl]
Megadeth began the Blackmail the Universe world tour in October 2004, enlisting touring bassist James MacDonough of Iced Earth and guitarist Glen Drover of Eidolon and King Diamond. While rehearsing for the tour, drummer Nick Menza left the band, unable to prepare for the physical demands of a full US tour.

On March 21, 2006, Capitol Records released a two-disc DVD titled Arsenal of Megadeth, which included archive footage, interviews, live shows, and many of the band's music videos.

===United Abominations (2007–08)===

In May 2006, Megadeth announced that their eleventh studio album, United Abominations, was near completion.

During Megadeth's live performance of "Anarchy in the UK" at a 1988 show in Antrim, Northern Ireland, Mustaine drunkenly (and, as he later acknowledged, confusedly) dedicated the song to the "cause" of "giving Ireland back to the Irish!" Before the final song, Mustaine said, "This one's for the cause!"[tpl]cite web|first=Richard|last=Bienstock|title=Megadeth: Rust Never Sleeps|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/megadeth_rust_never_sleeps?page=0,2|work=Guitar World|date=September 17, 2010|accessdate=November 22, 2013[/tpl] This triggered a riot among the audience between Catholics and Protestants, and a fight amongst the audience ensued.

Controversial and misinterpreted lyrics have also been the foundation of complications for the band. For instance, the music video for "In My Darkest Hour" was banned from MTV in 1988 when the music channel deemed the song to encourage suicide.[tpl]cite web|first=Laura|last=Mann|title=The Ten Best Music Videos Banned by MTV|url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2011/08/the_ten_best_videos_banned_by.php|work=Dallas Observer|date=August 1, 2011|accessdate=November 22, 2013[/tpl] The music video for "À Tout le Monde" was also banned by MTV for the same reason. According to Mustaine, the song was written from the perspective of a dying man, saying his last words to his loved ones. According to Mustaine, MTV had also been refusing to play "Skin o' My Teeth" and "Symphony of Destruction" because they considered the videos to be a "little bit too harsh".[tpl]cite journal|first=Anna Lisa|last=Pessin|title=Dressed for Success|journal=Spin|date=October 1992|volume=8|page=52|url=http://books.google.com/?id=wJumg6TLv8EC&pg=PT53&dq=countdown+to+extinction+thrash+metal#v=onepage&q=countdown%20to%20extinction%20thrash%20metal&f=false|accessdate=September 20, 2013[/tpl]

But it just shows the degree of ignorance and apathy that the government has toward the problem."
In July 2004, former bassist Dave Ellefson sued Mustaine for $18.5 million in Manhattan Federal Court.

Megadeth's music is characterized by its distinctive instrumental performance, featuring fast rhythm sections and complex arrangements.[tpl]cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=Megadeth Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/megadeth-mn0000406294/biography|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=November 15, 2013[/tpl] After forming Megadeth, Mustaine decided to follow the thrash metal style of his previous band Metallica, with more emphasis on speed and intensity.[tpl]cite web|title=Megadeth Biography|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/megadeth/biography|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2001|accessdate=November 22, 2013[/tpl] Along with his "snarling" vocal style, the band developed a unique musicianship that was highly regarded in the metal community.[tpl]sfn|Prown & Newquist|1997|p=227[/tpl] When asked to describe Megadeth's guitar style, Mustaine answered: "When you go to a show and see a guitar player who just stands there, that's a guitar player. A thrash guitar player is a guy who plays like he wants to beat the guitar's guts out." Like their underground metal contemporaries from the 1980s, Megadeth's tunes contained harsh vocals, staccato riffing, tremolo picking and screeching lead guitar work, while their albums from this period were produced with low budgets.[tpl]sfn|Purcell|2003|p=53[/tpl] The majority of their songs have been recorded in standard guitar tuning because Mustaine believes it to provide a superior melody as compared to alternative methods of tuning.[tpl]cite web|last=Bienstock|first=Richard|title=Interview: Megadeth Guitarist Dave Mustaine on 2009's 'Endgame'|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/interview-megadeth-guitarist-dave-mustaine-2009s-endgame|work=Guitar World|date=January 17, 2013|accessdate=December 15, 2013[/tpl]
During their early days, Dave Mustaine was the rhythm guitarist, while Chris Poland served as the lead guitarist. Although Poland performed only on Megadeth's first two albums, music journalists Pete Prown and Harvey P. Newquist credited him with making the music more colorful because of his jazz influences.[tpl]sfn|Prown & Newquist|1997|p=227[/tpl] According to former Metal Maniacs editor Jeff Wagner, the band's songwriting techniques peaked with their fourth album, Rust in Peace, which he described as a "flurry of precision and fluidity, making good on Megadeth's claim to being the world's state-of-the-art speed metal band".[tpl]sfn|Wagner|2010|p=43[/tpl] Musicologist Glenn Pillsbury noted that guitar work on the album was a mixture of "Mustaine's controlled chaos and the technical brilliance of Megadeth's other lead guitarist, Marty Friedman".[tpl]sfn|Pillsbury|2006|p=82[/tpl] Their studio efforts released in the mid- and late 1990s featured songs with compact structures and less complicated riffing.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/?id=tQ0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA84&dq=megadeth+cryptic+writings#v=onepage&q=megadeth%20cryptic%20writings&f=false|accessdate=November 22, 2013|last=Michael Moses|first=Dan Kaye|title=What Did You Do In The War, Daddy?|journal=Billboard|page=12|date=June 5, 1999[/tpl]
Lyrically, Megadeth's songs often convey gloomy themes focusing on death, war, politics and religion.[tpl]sfn|Arnett|1996|p=44[/tpl] Their lyricism is centered around nihilistic themes, but occasionally deal with topics like alienation and social problems.[tpl]sfn|Joyner|2002|p=301[/tpl] Their earliest releases featured themes such as occultism, graphic violence and "poetry about Satan".[tpl]cite journal|last=Powell|first=Mike|title=Diggin' In the Crates For Untold Treasures|journal=Spin|date=September 2011|volume=27|page=92|url=http://books.google.com/?id=0wtKHa9tu6QC&pg=PA92&dq=megadeth+poetry+about+satan#v=onepage&q=megadeth%20poetry%20about%20satan&f=false|accessdate=November 21, 2013[/tpl] Nuclear warfare and government conspiracy were lyrical preoccupations on albums like Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction.[tpl]sfn|Harrison|2011|p=60[/tpl] During Megadeth's commercial peak, Mustaine elaborated on less-controversial themes such as addiction and personal relationships. While discussing the lyrical content on their seventh album Cryptic Writings, Mustaine explained that he wanted to write songs that had more appeal to a wider audience.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/?id=5AkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA74&dq=megadeth+cryptic+writings#v=onepage&q=megadeth%20cryptic%20writings&f=false|accessdate=November 21, 2013|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|title=Metal Mainstay Megadeth Alters Its Lyrics But Not Its Music For The '90s|journal=Billboard|page=74|date=November 29, 1997[/tpl] The title of the group's eleventh studio album United Abominations is a satiric play on the name of the United Nations; Mustaine criticized their ineffectiveness on a number of songs on that record.[tpl]sfn|Phillips & Cogan|2009|p=157[/tpl] Later albums contained lyrics in a similar vein.

Aside from gaining critical acclaim, Megadeth is considered as one of the most musically influential groups that originated in the 1980s. As part of the early American thrash metal movement, their music was directly responsible for the birth of death metal.[tpl]sfn|Purcell|2003|p=53[/tpl] Sociologist Keith Kahn-Harris wrote that the mainstream success of Megadeth was one of the reasons for the expansion of extreme metal to places where it had previously been unknown.[tpl]sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=132[/tpl] Their sound and album artwork had influenced a number of next-generational thrash metal bands,[tpl]cite web|last=Ramirez|first=Carlos|title=Top 10 New School Thrash Bands|url=http://noisecreep.com/top-10-new-school-thrash-bands/|publisher=Noisecreep|date=July 29, 2009|accessdate=December 13, 2013[/tpl] including Toxic Holocaust and Warbringer.[tpl]cite web|title=Warbringer: 'Hunter-Seeker' Lyric Video Released |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/warbringer-hunter-seeker-lyric-video-released/|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=September 17, 2013|accessdate=December 13, 2013[/tpl]
