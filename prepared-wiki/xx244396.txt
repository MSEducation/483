Jill Magid (born 1973) is an American artist and writer.  In Magid's work, she forms intimate relationships with systems of power, including police, secret service, CCTV and forensics.  Countering the wide-angle, depersonalizing operations of such entities. Magid seeks – in her own words – "the potential softness and intimacy of their technologies, the fallacy of their omniscient point of view, the ways in which they hold memory (yet often cease to remember), their engrained position in society (the cause of their invisibility), their authority, their apparent intangibility and, with all of this, their potential reversibility."[tpl]cite web|last=Magid|first=Jill|title=Introduction to my work|url=http://jillmagid.net/writings.php|accessdate=16 January 2013[/tpl]

Jill Magid was born in Bridgeport, CT in 1973 and received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Magid had received her Master of Science in Visual Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge.  She currently lives and works in New York, where she serves as an adjunct professor at Cooper Union.
Magid was an artist-in-residence at the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten, Amsterdam from 2000-2. She has received various awards, including the Basis Stipendium from Fonds Voor Beeldende Kunsten in the Netherlands in 2006 and a Netherland-American Foundation Fellowship Fulbright Grant from 2001-2002. 
Magid's work has been the subject of solo exhibitions at numerous institutions: Tate Modern, London;[tpl]cite web|last=Tate Modern, London|title=Authority to Remove [tpl]![/tpl] September 10, 2009 – January 3, 2010|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/WHATS-ON/TATE-MODERN/EXHIBITION/LEVEL-2-GALLERY-JILL-MAGID|accessdate=15 January 2013[/tpl] the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York;[tpl]cite web|last=Whitney Museum of American Art, New York|title=A Reasonable Man in a Box [tpl]![/tpl] July 1 – September 12, 2010|url=http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/JillMagid|accessdate=15 January 2013[/tpl] the Berkeley Museum of Art, California; Tate Liverpool; the Stedelijk Museum Bureau Amsterdam; Gagosian Gallery, New York;[tpl]cite web|last=Gagosian Gallery|title=With Full Consent [tpl]![/tpl] June 27 - August 24, 2004|url=http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/june-27-2007--jill-magid|accessdate=17 January 2013[/tpl] Sparwasser, Berlin; The Centre D’Arte Santa Monica, Barcelona; and Stroom, Netherlands.[tpl]cite web|last=Stroom, Netherlands|title=Article 12 [tpl]![/tpl] April 20 – June 15, 2008 |url=http://www.stroom.nl/paginas/pagina.php?pa_id=9487473|accessdate=15 January 2013[/tpl]

==Selected Works==

===Evidence Locker===

Evidence Locker emerged from Magid’s 2004 collaboration with Liverpool's City Watch (Merseyside Police and Liverpool City Council) – then England’s largest citywide video surveillance system.  Navigating the city in a bright red trench coat for thirty-one days, the artist periodically contacted on-duty police to train their public cameras on her.  Sometimes, the surveillants located her on their own.[tpl]cite web|title=Evidence Locker|url=http://www.jillmagid.net/EvidenceLocker.php|accessdate=15 January 2013[/tpl] 
City Watch stores CCTV footage for only thirty-one days “unless requested as evidence”; requested footage, in turn, is kept for seven years in a digital “Evidence Locker” on the organization’s main computer.  Despite her collaboration with the organization, Magid could only obtain access to her footage by formally submitting thirty-one Subject Access Request Forms, detailing the time and nature of the evidentiary incidents.  Building upon her implicit intimacy with the CCTV observers, Magid filled out these legal documents as if writing letters to a lover.  The collected letters form her 2004 book, One Cycle of Memory in the City of L.[tpl]cite web|title=Books by Jill Magid|url=http://www.jillmagid.net/books.php|accessdate=15 January 2013[/tpl] 
After filing the forms, Magid received over eleven hours of CCTV recordings, constituting her own personal evidence locker.  The artist edited this footage into a number of videos, including Final Tour (2004), which comprises a series of time-lapse sequences of the artist motorcycling through the city at sunset, backed by George Delerue’s score from Le Mépris.  In Trust (2004), a CCTV operator communicates with Magid via mobile phone, guiding the artist – eyes closed – through the city’s public spaces.[tpl]cite journal|last=Coburn|first=Tyler|title=Review: Jill Magid at Gagosian|journal=ArtReview|date=October 2007|accessdate=15 January 2013[/tpl]  
As a whole, Evidence Locker contributes to contemporary debates around public surveillance by giving a nuanced, focused take on the  “emotional and philosophical relationship between ‘protective’ institutions … and individual identity.”[tpl]cite web|last=Gagosian Gallery|title=Jill Magid: With Full Consent [tpl]![/tpl] Press Release|url=http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/june-27-2007--jill-magid|accessdate=15 January 2013[/tpl]

===The Spy Project===

In 2005, Magid was commissioned by the Dutch secret service (AIVD) to make a work for its new headquarters, as per the law’s stipulation that “a portion of the budget for the new building be spent on an art commission.”[tpl]cite web|last=Tate Modern|title=Level 2 Gallery: Jill Magid|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/level-2-gallery-jill-magid|accessdate=16 January 2013[/tpl]   The organization solicited the artist to help improve its public persona by providing “‘the AIVD with a human face.’”[tpl]cite web|last=Magid|first=Jill|title=Article 12 / The Spy Project|url=http://www.jillmagid.net/Article12.php|accessdate=16 January 2013[/tpl] 
Magid spent the following three years meeting with eighteen willing employees in “non-descript public places,” from restaurants and bars to airport meeting points.ibid.  AIVD restricted the artist from using recording equipment, so she collected her contacts’ personal data in handwritten notes, which informed her later series of neons, sculptures and paper works.  Magid also drafted a report of her meetings, amassing the details of individual contacts into a collective persona that she referred to as “The Organization.” 
The first exhibition of the project, Article 12, opened at Stroom, The Netherlands in April 2008 – the same month AIVD took residence in its new headquarters.  The show also marked the official end of the artist’s commission.[tpl]cite web|last=Stroom Den Haag|title=Jill Magid: Article 12|url=http://www.stroom.nl/activiteiten/tentoonstelling.php?t_id=6430733|accessdate=16 January 2013[/tpl]   Named after the article that protects personal data, Article 12 never entirely disclosed the identities of Magid’s contacts, but nonetheless inverted “the surveillance duties of the agency” by publicly displaying materials associated with its employees. 
Magid invited AIVD personnel to review the exhibition a day before the opening; the agents returned, during its run, to confiscate several works.  A draft of Magid’s report, in turn, was delivered to the artist with redactions of “any information that might compromise her sources’ identities,” as well as “some of the artist’s descriptions of her own thoughts and feelings.” ibid. 
The artist “protested against the censorship of her own memories,” prompting AIVD to suggest that she “‘present the manuscript as a visual work of art in a one-time-only exhibition, after which it would become the property of the Dutch government and not be published.’”ibid.   Magid’s 2009/10 exhibition at Tate Modern, Authority to Remove, marked the fulfillment of this request: the uncensored report sat securely behind glass.  In its penultimate state, the project thus expressed “what it means to have a secret but not the autonomy to share it.”ibid.   
AIVD entered Tate Modern, in 2010, to permanently confiscate Magid's uncensored manuscript.  A paperback of the redacted version, Becoming Tarden, was published in 2010.[tpl]cite web|title=Books by Jill Magid|url=http://www.jillmagid.net/books.php|accessdate=16 January 2013[/tpl]

===Failed States===

On January 21, 2010, a man attempted to enter the Texas State Capitol to speak with a Senator’s aide.  Immediately upon exiting the building, he fired six shots into the sky. Magid, coincidentally, was on a trip to research the history of snipers in Austin; her eyewitness account of the shooting aired on several media outlets.[tpl]cite web|last=Thomas|first=Elizabeth|title=Jill Magid: Closet Drama|url=http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/images/art/matrix/237/MATRIX-237_Jill-Magid.pdf|accessdate=16 January 2013[/tpl]
The motivations of the young shooter, Fausto Cardenas, remain unknown.  He was charged with perpetrating a terrorist threat to the government, but the trial date for his case was continuously delayed.  Fausto accepted a plea bargain, in August 2011, “ultimately silencing himself.”[tpl]cite web|last=AMOA-Arthouse|title=Jill Magid: Failed States|url=http://amoa-arthouse.org/2011/jill-magid/|accessdate=16 January 2013[/tpl] 
Magid responded strongly to “the symbolic gesture of six shots into the sky, the fateful setting, the silence that refuses to ground Fausto in political rhetoric or personal instability.”  For Closet Drama, her 2011 exhibition at the Berkeley Art Museum, and the subsequent Failed States, the artist drew thematic and formal connections between Fausto’s act and Goethe’s nineteenth-century poem, Faust.  Acting “as eyewitness and dramaturge,” Magid linked themes of tragedy and futility between Fausto and his nominal relative, even bringing texts of Faust’s monologues into the gallery space as implicit stand-ins for the shooter’s silence.[tpl]cite web|last=Honor Fraser|title=Jill Magid: Failed States PR|url=http://www.honorfraser.com/?s=current&eid=61&c=press|accessdate=16 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Mizota|first=Sharon|title=Review: Jill Magid's paean to the unspoken word at Honor Fraser|journal=The Los Angeles Times|date=14 Jule 2012|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/14/entertainment/la-et-cm-review-jill-magid-at-honor-fraser-20120611|accessdate=16 January 2013[/tpl]  Goethe’s epic was originally written as a "closet drama" – “a play to be read rather than performed”; in Magid’s hands, the gallery transformed into a “stage to be read,” with language, sculpture, video and image creating an intertextual weave between stories and events, individuals and publics, actions and aftermaths.  
The day of the shooting, Magid met with a reporter, "CT," who had previously embedded with the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Over a series of meetings, the artist decided to train to embed with CT on his next trip to Afghanistan.  CT informed her that they would navigate the country in a “hard car” – usually a Mercedes – armored to withstand gunfire while blending into traffic.  Magid promptly decided to armor her 1993 Mercedes station wagon and, as part of her 2012 exhibition at AMOA-Arthouse, Austin, parked the car in the spot where Fausto had parked on the day he fired his six shots.ibid.

===Auto Portrait Pending===

In 2005, Magid signed a contract with Lifegem, a company that specializes in turning cremated bodies into diamonds.  The artist specified that, upon her death, the carbon from her remains be transformed into a one-carat, round-cut diamond for setting in a gold ring.  An additional Beneficiary Contract allows for ownership of “the artist (in symbolic terms) until her death, after which her ashes will be transformed into a jewel to be put in the ring on permanent display.”[tpl]cite journal|last=Bentley|first=Kyle|title=Review: Jill Magid, Gagosian Gallery|journal=Artforum|date=October 2007|url=http://www.jillmagid.net/pdf/ArtforumOctober_2007.pdf[/tpl]
Auto Portrait Pending displays the incomplete form of Magid’s self-portrait; her preamble, the contract, the Beneficiary Contract, a ring box and the unset gold ring make up its existing parts. 
According to Magid’s website, Auto Portrait Pending still “awaits a Beneficiary.”[tpl]cite web|title=Auto Portrait Pending|url=http://www.jillmagid.net/AutoPortrait.php|accessdate=15 January 2013[/tpl]

==Books==

One Cycle of Memory in the City of L (2004) comprises the thirty-one Subject Access Request Forms Magid filed to obtain access to CCTV footage from Evidence Locker, her 2004 collaboration with Liverpool’s City Watch.  These forms ask for the time and nature of the incidents in question, which Magid supplied along with expressions of affection for their implicit recipients.  In the artist’s work, an intimacy can form between a pedestrian and her surveillants, and a bureaucratic document can testify to that relationship. 
Lincoln Ocean Victor Eddy (2007) emerged from a five-month period Magid spent shadowing a New York police officer during his nightly rounds through the city’s subway system.  The book forgoes the mediating structure of legal documents, as in One Cycle of Memory in the City of L, by providing a diaristic account of Magid’s feelings towards her companion – a shift to character-driven writing that continues in the artist’s later books, Becoming Tarden and Failed States.ibid.
Writing in The New York Times, critic Roberta Smith describes Magid’s text as “quietly heart-rending novella, a kind of tunnel vision of two people moving along parallel tracks while the city hums around them.  The relationship is never consummated, but ‘Lincoln Ocean Victor Eddy’ spells love.”[tpl]cite news|last=Smith|first=Roberta|title=Art in Review: With Full Consent|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/27/arts/27gall.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|accessdate=15 January 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 July 2007[/tpl]
Part of The Spy Project, Becoming Tarden (2010) is a non-fiction novel that emerged from Magid’s interviews with eighteen agents of the Dutch secret service (AIVD).  Following Magid’s submission of a draft, in 2008, the organization censored forty percent of the contents, from compromising information to the artist’s personal descriptions and recollections.  AIVD conceded to allow Magid to exhibit the uncensored report – only once – “‘as a visual work of art.’” Following its secure display in 2009/10 at the Tate Modern, the Dutch government assumed ownership of the manuscript. 
In a letter to AIVD, Magid remarked: “‘The book, Becoming Tarden, is a memoir of our involvement. I had dreams of publishing it as my first novel. You are its only reader. Seize it. Strip it. Hold it in your building and seal it under glass. I comply.’”ibid.
A redacted paperback version of Becoming Tarden was published in 2010. 
Failed States (2012) departs from the project of the same name, shifting focus to “CT,” a former embedded war correspondent who helps train Magid to embed in Afghanistan.  The artist formerly played the role of incidental witness to Fausto’s shooting, but in the book, actively seeks out training with a “personal desire to engage the war on terror and its media representation through becoming an eyewitness.”ibid.
This non-fiction novel marks a new stage in Magid’s writing: unlike previous works, its contents never enter the gallery space.  The topics of the Closet Drama and Failed States exhibitions, in turn, are barely mentioned in the book.ibid.

==Critical Response==

Magid’s work “is incisive in its poetic questioning of the ethics of human behavior and the hidden political structures of society. Her intelligent conceptual strategies engage the viewer in an absorbing aesthetic and intellectual experience that turns conventional assumptions of power, secrecy, control and social space inside out.”Chrissie Iles, in conversation with the artist.
"For Magid, the art is the process of getting intimate with systems, of subverting technology into sensuality, seduction, a love affair … the process of seduction is her art."[tpl]cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Elizabeth|journal=Bidoun|year=2007|issue=10|url=http://www.bidoun.org/magazine/10-technology/jill-magid-by-elizabeth-rubin/|accessdate=15 January 2013[/tpl] 
"Ms. Magid … seems motivated by an urge to infiltrate and personalize, if not sexualize, the anonymous social and technological systems that surround us.  She pursues an idiosyncratic kind of body art descended from artists like Vito Acconci, Adrian Piper and Sophie Calle."
