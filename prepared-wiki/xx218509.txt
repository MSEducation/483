Buffalo Baseball Park was a stadium in Buffalo, New York. It was used for both baseball and football, serving as the home of Buffalo Bisons of the International League, the Buffalo All-Americans of the National Football League, and several iterations of the New York Pro Football League Championship. The ballpark opened in 1889. It was located on the block bounded by East Ferry Street, Masten Avenue, Woodlawn Avenue and Michigan Avenue.

After the lease ran out on Olympic Park after the conclusion of the 1888 season, a new park was built on East Ferry and Michigan Avenue.Buffalo Bisons History bisons.com accessed 19-APR-2008When Baseball came to Richmond Avenue richomndavenue.org accessed 19-APR-2008  It was a wooden structure which opened for professional baseball in 1889, serving the high-minor league club's needs for well over three decades. Offermann Stadium was built on the same site in 1924.
Buffalo Public Schools #192, (Buffalo Academy For Visual and Performing Arts), now occupies the site today. In August 2012, a historical plaque was dedicated at the site in remembrance of over 72 years of baseball played on the grounds. Local Buffalo sports historian John Boutet spearheaded the project and raised the funds through the Facebook group Buffalo Sports Museum, the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame and the Buffalo Bisons.
