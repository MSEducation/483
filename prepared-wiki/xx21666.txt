[[List of counties in Idaho]]

This is a list of 44 counties in the U.S. state of Idaho.
Each county in Idaho has a license plate prefix, according to the first letter of the county name.  The first county for a given letter is given #1, the second county #2, etc.  For example, Ada and Adams are the only two counties with the letter 'A'.  Since Ada comes before Adams alphabetically, Ada is '1A' while Adams is '2A.'  There are four counties that start with the letter 'L': Latah, Lemhi, Lewis, and Lincoln; the license plate prefixes for these counties are 1L, 2L, 3L, and 4L, respectively.
Elmore, Idaho, Kootenai, Nez Perce, Shoshone, Valley, and Washington counties are the only ones in the state with those beginning letters.  Therefore, the license plate prefix would be the first letter of the county name, without a number. The letter 'B' has ten counties, 'C' has seven, and 'L' has four; the remaining letters have two or fewer.
When the Idaho Territory was created in March 1863, there were five original counties: Shoshone, Nez Perce, Idaho, Boise, and Missoula. Kootenai, Owyhee, and Oneida were created by 1865, Ada was created in 1866, and when the territory reached Idaho's present day dimensions in 1868, Lemhi was formed. By 1880, 13 counties were created. Ten years later, when Idaho became a state, 18 counties were created. In 1893, Fremont and Bingham counties were created. By 1900, Idaho had 21 counties. Ten years later, only two new counties were created. Between 1910 and 1920, 21 new  counties were created, bringing the number of counties to 44, where it remains today.
