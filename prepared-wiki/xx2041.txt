</ref>  Each loop of wire is called a  '''turn'''.<ref name="Laplante" />  In windings in which the turns touch, the wire must be insulated with a coating of nonconductive [[insulation (electric)|insulation]] such as plastic or enamel to prevent the current from passing between the wire turns.   The winding is often wrapped around a ''coil form'' made of plastic or other material to hold it in place.<ref name="Laplante" />  The ends of the wire are brought out and attached to an external circuit.  Windings may have additional electrical connections along their length; these are called '''taps'''.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=soSsLATmZnkC&pg=PA633&dq=tap  Laplante 1999, p. 633]</ref>  A winding which has a single tap in the center of its length is called '''center-tapped'''.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=9sW_knz5P0wC&pg=PA29 Stauffer 2005, p. 29]</ref>
Coils can have more than one winding, insulated electrically from each other.  When there are two or more windings around a common magnetic axis, the windings are said to be inductively coupled or magnetically coupled.Newnes 2002, p. 167  A time-varying current through one winding will create a time-varying magnetic field which passes through the other winding, which will induce a time-varying voltage in the other windings.  This is called a transformer.Newnes 2002, p. 326

==Magnetic core==

Many electromagnetic coils have a magnetic core, a piece of ferromagnetic material like iron in the center to increase the magnetic field.[ref]
