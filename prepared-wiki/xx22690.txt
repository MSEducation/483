Ionization (or ionisation, see American and British English spelling differences) is the process by which an atom or a molecule acquires a negative or positive charge by gaining or losing electrons. Ionization, often, results from the interaction of an atom or a molecule with an ionizing particle, including charged particles with sufficient energies and energetic photons. A rare case of ionization in the absence of an external particle is the internal conversion process, through which an excited nucleolus transfers its energy to one of the inner-shell electrons and ejects it with high kinetic energy.  
The ionization process is of particular interest in fundamental science. It is also encountered in many fields of practical interest, ranging from mass spectroscopy to radiotherapy for eliminating cancer cells. Obviously,  all aspects of the ionization process cannot be addressed in a single encyclopedic article. Here, ionization is described by invoking the simple case of an atom in strong laser field. The case is amenable to analytic treatment and represents the main characteristics of the process.       

==Ionization energy of atoms and  the periodic table==

The trend in the ionization energy of atoms is often used to demonstrate the periodic behavior of atoms with respect to the atomic number, as summarized by ordering atoms in  Mendeleev's table. This is a valuable tool for establishing and understanding the ordering of electrons in atomic orbitals without going into the details of wave functions or the ionization process. An example is presented in figure 1. The periodic abrupt decrease in ionization potential after rare gas atoms, for instance, indicates the emergence of a new shell in alkali metals. In addition, the local maximums in the ionization energy plot, moving from left to right in a row, are indicative of s, p, d, and f sub-shells.

==Ionization to negatively charged ions==

The negatively charged ions are produced when a free electron collides  with an atom and is subsequently trapped inside the electric potential  barrier, releasing any excess energy. The process is known as electron capture ionization.

==Ionization to positively charged ions==

The positively charged ions are produced by transferring sufficient amount of energy to a bound electron. The threshold amount of the required energy is known as ionization potential.
The ionization energy, generally, is supplied by incident photons (photoionization) or via collision with other particles. The ionization of a material  by subjecting it to a high temperature (thermal ionization) is a form of collision mediated ionization for which a bound electron acquires energy in multiple steps, jumping into a higher energy level in each step, until reaching to the continuum of free steps.

==Semi-classical description of ionization==

Classical physics and the Bohr model of the atom can qualitatively explain photoionization and collision-mediated ionization. In these cases, during the ionization process, the energy of the electron exceeds the energy difference of the potential barrier it is trying to pass. The semi-classical description, however, cannot describe tunnel ionization since the process involves the passage of electron through a classically forbidden potential barrier.

==Quantum mechanical description of ionization==

The interaction of atoms and molecules with sufficiently strong laser pulses leads to the ionization to singly or multiply charged ions. The ionization rate, i.e. the ionization probability in unit time, can only be calculated using quantum mechanics. In general, the analytic solutions are not available, and the approximations required for manageable numerical calculations do not provide accurate enough results. However, when the laser intensity is sufficiently high, the detailed structure of the atom or molecule can be ignored and analytic solution for the ionization rate is possible.

===Tunnel ionization===

Tunnel ionization is ionization due to quantum tunneling. In classical ionization, an electron must have enough energy to make it over the potential barrier, but quantum tunneling allows the electron simply to go through the potential barrier instead of going all the way over it because of the wave nature of the electron. The probability of an electron's tunneling through the barrier drops off exponentially with the width of the potential barrier. Therefore, an electron with a higher energy can make it further up the potential barrier, leaving a much thinner barrier to tunnel through and, thus, a greater chance to do so. In practice, tunnel ionization is observable when the atom or molecule is interacting with near-infrared strong laser pauses. This process can be understood as a process by which a bounded electron, through  the absorption of more than one photon from the laser field, is ionized. This picture is generally known as multiphoton ionization (MPI).
Keldysh[tpl]cite journal|author=Keldysh L V |year=1965 |url=http://www.jetp.ac.ru/cgi-bin/e/index/e/20/5/p1307?a=list |title=Ionization in the Field of a Strong Electromagnetic Wave|journal=Soviet Phys. JETP |page=1307|volume=20|issue=5[/tpl] modeled the MPI process as a transition of the electron from the ground state of the atom to the Volkov states.Volkov D M 1934 Z. Phys. 94 250 In this model the perturbation of the ground state by the laser field is neglected and the details of atomic structure in determining the ionization probability are not taken into account. The major difficulty with Keldysh's model was its neglect of the effects of Coulomb interaction on the final state of the electron. As it is observed from figure,  the Coulomb field is not  very small in magnitude compared to the potential of the laser at larger distances from the  nucleus. This is in contrast to the approximation made by neglecting the potential of the laser at regions near the  nucleus.

====Quasi-static tunnel ionization====

==Strong field approximation for the ionization rate==

The calculations of PPT are done in the E-gauge, meaning that the laser field is taken as electromagnetic waves.  The ionization rate can also be calculated in A-gauge, which emphasis the particle nature of light (absorbing multiple photons during ionization).  This approach was adopted by Krainov model[tpl]cite journal |last1=Krainov |first1=Vladimir P. |title=Ionization rates and energy and angular distributions at the barrier-suppression ionization of complex atoms and atomic ions |journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America B |volume=14 |issue=2 |year=1997 |pages=425 |issn=0740-3224 |doi=10.1364/JOSAB.14.000425[/tpl] based on the earlier works of Faisal[tpl]cite journal |last1=Faisal |first1=F H M |title=Multiple absorption of laser photons by atoms |journal=Journal of Physics B: Atomic and Molecular Physics |volume=6 |issue=4 |year=1973 |pages=L89–L92 |issn=0022-3700 |doi=10.1088/0022-3700/6/4/011[/tpl] and Reiss.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Reiss |first1=Howard |title=Effect of an intense electromagnetic field on a weakly bound system |journal=Physical Review A |volume=22 |issue=5 |year=1980 |pages=1786–1813 |issn=0556-2791 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.22.1786[/tpl] The resulting rate is given by

===Atomic stabilization/population trapping===

In 1992, de Boer and Muller [tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.68.2747|title=Observation of large populations in excited states after short-pulse multiphoton ionization|year=1992|last1=De Boer|first1=M.|last2=Muller|first2=H.|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=68|issue=18|pages=2747–2750|pmid=10045482[/tpl] showed that Xe atoms subjected to short laser pulses could survive in the highly excited states 4f, 5f, and 6f . These states were believed to have been excited by the dynamic Stark shift of the levels into multiphoton resonance with the field during the rising part of the laser pulse. Subsequent evolution of the laser pulse did not ionize completely these states leaving behind some highly excited atoms. We shall refer to this phenomenon as "population trapping".
We mention the theoretical calculation that incomplete ionization occurs whenever there is parallel resonant excitation into a common level with ionization loss.[tpl]cite journal|author=Hioe F T and Carrol C E|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.37.3000|title=Coherent population trapping in N-level quantum systems|year=1988|journal=Physical Review A|volume=37|issue=8|pages=3000–3005|pmid=9900034[/tpl] We consider a state such as 6f of Xe whidi consists of 7 quasi-degnerate levels in the range of the laser bandwidth. These levels along with the continuum constitute a lambda system.  The mechanism of the lambda type trapping is schematically presented in figure. At the rising part of the pulse (a) the excited state (with two degenerate levels 1 and 2) are not in multiphoton resonance with the ground state. The electron is ionized through multiphoton coupling with the continuum. As the intensity of the pulse is increased the excited state and the continuum are shifted in energy due to the Stark shift. At the peak of the pulse (b) the excited states go into multiphoton resonance with the ground state. As the intensity statrts to decrease (c), the two state are coupled through continuum and the population is trapped in a coherent superposition of the two states. Under subsequent action of the same pulse, due to interference in the transition amplitudes of the lambda system, the field cannot ionize the population completely and a fraction of the population will be trapped in a coherent superposition of the quasi degenerate levels. According to this explanation the states with higher angular momentum- with more sublevels- would have a higher probability of trapping the population. In general the strength of the trapping will be determined by the strength of the two photon coupling between the quasi-degenerate levels via the continuum.In 1996, using the very stable laser and by minimizing the masking effects of the focal region expansion with increasing intensity, Talebpour et al.[tpl]cite journal|author=Talebpour A, Chien C Y and Chin S L |doi=10.1088/0953-4075/29/23/015|title=Population trapping in rare gases|year=1996|journal=Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics|volume=29|issue=23|pages=5725[/tpl] observed structures on the curves of singly charged ions of Xe, Kr and Ar. These structures were attributed to electron trapping in the strong laser field. A more unambiguous demonstration of population trapping has been reported by T. Morishita and C. D. Lin.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Morishita |first1=Toru |last2=Lin |first2=C. D. |title=Photoelectron spectra and high Rydberg states of lithium generated by intense lasers in the over-the-barrier ionization regime |journal=Physical Review A |volume=87 |issue=6 |year=2013 |issn=1050-2947 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.87.063405[/tpl]

===Non-sequential multiple ionization===

Two models have been proposed to explain the non-sequential ionization;  the shake-off model and electron re-scattering model. The shake-off (SO) model,  first proposed by Fittinghoff et al.,[tpl]cite journal|author=Fittinghoff D N, Bolton P R, Chang B, and Kulander K C |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.69.2642|title=Observation of nonsequential double ionization of helium with optical tunneling|year=1992|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=69|issue=18|pages=2642–2645|pmid=10046547[/tpl] is adopted from the field of ionization of atoms by X rays and electron projectiles where the SO process is one of the major mechanisms responsible  for the multiple ionization of atoms. The SO model describes the NS process as a mechanism where one electron is ionized by the laser field and the departure of this electron is so rapid that the remaining electrons do not have enough time to adjust themselves to the new energy states. Therefore, there is a certain probability that, after the ionization of the first electron, a second electron is excited to states with higher energy (shake-up) or even ionized (shake-off). We should mention that, until now, there has been no quantitative calculation based on the SO model, and the model is still qualitative.
The re-scattering model in Kuchiev's version (Kuchiev's model) is quantum mechanical. The basic idea of the model is illustrated  by Feynman diagrams in figure a. First both electrons are in the ground state of an atom. The lines marked a and b describe the corresponding atomic states. Then the electron a is ionized. The beginning of the ionization process is shown by the intersection with a sloped dashed line. where the MPI occurs. The propagation of the ionized electron in the laser field, during which it absorbs other photons (ATI), is shown by the full thick  line. The collision of this electron with the parent atomic ion is shown by a vertical dotted line representing the Coulomb interaction between the electrons. The state marked with c describes the ion excitation to a discrete or continuum state. Figure b describes the exchange process. Kuchiev's model, contrary to Corkum's model, does not predict any threshold intensity for the occurrence of NS ionization.
Kuciev did not include the Coulomb effects on the dynamics of the ionized electron. This resulted in the underestimation of the double ionization rate by a huge factor. Obviously, in the approach of Becker and Faisal (which is equivalent to Kuchiev's model in spirit), this drawback does not exist. In fact, their model is more exact and does not suffer from the large number of approximations made by Kuchiev. Their calculation results perfectly fit with the experimental results of Walker et al.[tpl]cite journal|author=Walker B,  Sheehy B, Dimauro L F, Agostini P, Schafer K J, and Kulander K C|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.73.1227|title=Precision Measurement of Strong Field Double Ionization of Helium|year=1994|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=73|issue=9|pages=1227–1230|pmid=10057657[/tpl] Becker and Faisal[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1088/0953-4075/32/14/101|title=S-matrix analysis of ionization yields of noble gas atoms at the focus of Ti:sapphire laser pulses|year=1999|last1=Becker|first1=A|last2=Faisal|first2=F H M|journal=Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics|volume=32|issue=14|pages=L335[/tpl] have been able to fit the experimental results on the multiple NSI of rare gas atoms using their model. As a result the electron re-scattering can be taken as the main mechanism for the occurrence of  the NSI process.

===Multiphoton ionization of inner-valence electrons and fragmentation of polyatomic molecules===

The ionization of inner valance electrons are responsible for the fragmentation of polyatomic molecules in strong laser fields. According to a qualitative model[tpl]cite journal|url=http://slchin-symposium.copl.ulaval.ca/MPublication/168_CPL_313_0789.pdf|doi=10.1016/S0009-2614(99)01075-1|title=Multiphoton ionization of inner-valence electrons and fragmentation of ethylene in an intense Ti:sapphire laser pulse|year=1999|last1=Talebpour|first1=A|last2=Bandrauk|first2=A.D|last3=Yang|first3=J|last4=Chin|first4=S.L|journal=Chemical Physics Letters|volume=313|issue=5–6|pages=789[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1088/0953-4075/33/21/307|title=Dissociative ionization of benzene in intense ultra-fast laser pulses|year=2000|last1=Talebpour|first1=A|last2=Bandrauk|first2=A D|last3=Vijayalakshmi|first3=K|last4=Chin|first4=S L|journal=Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics|volume=33|issue=21|pages=4615[/tpl] the dissociation of the molecules occurs through a three-step mechanism:
The short pulse induced molecular fragmentation may be used as an ion source for high performance mass spectroscopy. The selectivity provided by a short pulse based source is superior to that expected when using the conventional electron ionization based sources, in particular when the identification of optical isomers is required.S. Mehdi Sharifi, A. Talebpour, S.L. Chin, Ultra-fast laser pulses provide an ion source for highly selective mass spectroscopy, Applied Physics B, 2008, 91:579-581[tpl]cite journal|last1=Peng|first1=Jiahui|last2=Puskas|first2=Noah|last3=Corkum|first3=Paul B.|last4=Rayner|first4=David M.|last5=Loboda|first5=Alexandre V.|title=High-Pressure Gas Phase Femtosecond Laser Ionization Mass Spectrometry|journal=Analytical Chemistry|volume=84|issue=13|year=2012|pages=5633–5640|issn=0003-2700|doi=10.1021/ac300743k[/tpl]

==Dissociation – distinction==

A substance may dissociate without necessarily producing ions. As an example, the molecules of table sugar dissociate in water (sugar is dissolved) but exist as intact neutral entities. Another subtle event is the dissociation of sodium chloride (table salt) into sodium and chlorine ions. Although it may seem as a case of ionization, in reality the ions already exist within the crystal lattice. When salt is dissociated, its constituent ions are simply surrounded by water molecules and their effects are visible (e.g. the solution becomes electrolytic). However, no transfer or displacement of electrons occurs. Actually, the chemical synthesis of salt involves ionization. This is a chemical reaction.
