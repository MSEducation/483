Gil Boyne (October 28, 1924 - May 5, 2010) was an American pioneer in modern hypnotherapy who focused on training thousands of "lay" hypnotherapists primarily in Glendale, CA as well as throughout the world. He championed the accessibility of hypnotherapy and consistently fought against legislative efforts worldwide to restrict hypnosis to the purely medical professions, which had largely ignored the therapeutic value of hypnosis until Boyne, Milton Erickson, and Dave Elman. Boyne was mentored by Ormond McGill, with whom he collaborated for the 1977 book "Professional Stage Hypnotism". Over the course of more than 55 years he trained thousands of hypnotherapists globally with his Transforming Therapy™ methods, many of whom themselves wrote many books and created their own hypnotherapy training centers including Randal Churchill (Hypnotherapy Training Institute) and Charles Tebbetts.

==Early Life and Career==

Boyne was born in Philadelphia, PA, USA in 1924 to a deeply religious Irish American family. His early schooling was religiously focused which impacted his spiritual beliefs throughout his life.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gilboyneonline.com/|title= Gil Boyne Online| accessdate =9 August 2013[/tpl]
He served in the Navy in the Pacific theatre during World War II, after which he was assigned to a therapeutic program based on psychoanalysis. The program was largely ineffective, and his frustration with the approach, his spiritual and religious upbringing, and experience as a stage hypnotist led him to develop the transformative approach using hypnosis. Contemporary influences included Dave Elman, Milton Erickson, Fritz Perls' Gestalt Therapy and Carl Rogers' "unconditional positive regard".

==Hypnotism Training Institute==

Gil founded and was the director of the Hypnotism Training Institute in Glendale, CA. In 1976, it became the first licensed Hypnotherapy training center in the United States offering up to 250 hours of training, including a diploma-offering curriculum in professional hypnotherapy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hypnotistexaminers.com/facts.html|accessdate=9 August 2013|title=American Council of Hypnotist Examiners - Facts[/tpl]

==Transforming Therapy™==

With his background and experiences and with influences by his contemporaries mentioned above, Boyne developed the first program designed to train hypnotherapists in a regression-based approach. The resulting program, Transforming Therapy™, was used for decades to train over 12,000 and possibly as many as 15,000 hypnotherapists globally.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gilboyneonline.com/|title=Gil Boyne Online| accessdate =9 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://westwoodpublishingco.com/gilboyne.html/|title=Westwood Publishing's About Gil Boyne page| accessdate =9 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://gil-boyne.com/index.html#AboutGil|accessdate=9 August 2013|title=Gil-Boyne.com About[/tpl] The Transforming Therapy™ method incorporated aspects of Regression Therapy and Gestalt Therapy as well as focusing on the self-healing power of the subconscious mind. It uses a compassionate spiritual approach that simplifies theory in the actual therapy and hones in on allowing the inner mind to construct its own solutions creatively.[tpl]cite book|last=Boyne|first=Gil|authorlink=Gil Boyne|title=Transforming Therapy™ a New Approach to Hypnotherapy|year=1989|isbn=978-0930298135[/tpl] The approach is generally considered to be rapidly effective3.
