Radio Antilles was a radio station founded in 1963, located on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. The station operated at 930 kHz AM and covered the entire Caribbean region.  It aired programmes in the English, Spanish and French languages. English programming was broadcast all day on 930 kHz, and Spanish programming from 10:00 PM – 01:00 AM. French language programming was broadcast on 740 kHz and relayed on 1450 kHz.
The broadcast studios were located in the capital city of Plymouth, with the transmission site on the southern slopes of the Soufriere Hills volcano near Morris. Like so much else in Montserrat, Radio Antilles was badly damaged by Hurricane Hugo, briefly rebuilt, and then shut down and abandoned at the start of the eruptions in 1995. Both the studio and the transmitter were eventually burned and buried completely by lahar and pyroclastic flow deposits.
