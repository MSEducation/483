==History==

ST 12 was officially formed on January 20, 2004, although its members had long been in the music world. Earlier, they were not known to each other. They often met in the rental studio on Jl. Stasiun Timur No. 12, Bandung. The band was named by Pepep's father, Helmi Aziz. Charly liked jazz, Pepep liked jazz and rock, while Pepeng grew up with rock music. After failing to get a recording contract, ST 12 went indie (independent). Their debut album Jalan Terbaik was released in 2006. Unfortunately, during the promotional tour in Semarang, Iman Rush died after a brain hemorrhage in October 2005.Charly ST12 Histeris di Panggung, diakses 27 Agustus 2008
