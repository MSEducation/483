[[List of saints]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of saints, Christian saints

This is an incomplete list of Christian saints in alphabetical order by Christian name, but if necessary by surname, the place, or attribute part of the name as well.
There are more than 10,000 canonized Roman Catholic saints. Among the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Communions, the numbers may be even higher, since there is no fixed process of "canonization" and each individual jurisdiction within the two Orthodox communions independently maintains parallel lists of saints that have only partial overlap. Note that 78 popes are considered saints.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1101685.htm|title=Heavenly hosts|publisher=Catholic News Centre|accessdate=13  April 2014[/tpl]
The Anglican Communion have only ever canonized one saintâ€”King Charles I of England (see Society of King Charles the Martyr). However, it recognizes pre-Reformation saints, as does the United Methodist Church. Persons who have led lives of celebrated sanctity or missionary zeal are included in the Calendar of the Prayer Book "without thereby enrolling or commending such persons as saints of the Church". Similarly, any individuals commemorated in the Lutheran calendar of saints will be listed as well.
Wikipedia contains calendars of saints for particular denominations, listed by the day of the year on which they are traditionally venerated, as well as a chronological list of saints and blesseds, listed by their date of death.
