==Club career==

A product of Club Atlético Boca Juniors' youth system, Trejo only played one game for its first team but, in the game against Almagro, he scored in a 2–3 away loss, after mere minutes on the pitch. The match was suspended after 63 minutes.Un grupito hizo lío y partido suspendido (Hooligans made a mess and match suspended); Clarín, 4 July 2005 [tpl]es icon[/tpl]
In late December Trejo was bought by RCD Mallorca in Spain, still having not signed his first professional contract. Boca sustained otherwise and the case was taken to FIFA, which ultimately decided for the Balearic Islands' outfit.La FIFA da la razón al Mallorca en el 'caso Óscar Trejo', que será presentado mañana oficialmente (FIFA decides for Mallorca in the Óscar Trejo Affair, he will be presented officially tomorrow); Terra, 5 March 2007 [tpl]es icon[/tpl] On 8 April 2007 he played his first La Liga match, against Getafe CF: taking the pitch in the 90th minute, he managed to find the net for a final 2–0 home victory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.football-lineups.com/games/?game=5685|title=Mallorca – Getafe|publisher=Football-Lineups|date=8 April 2007|accessdate=16 April 2007[/tpl]
