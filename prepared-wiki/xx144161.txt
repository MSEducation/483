==Club career==

Initially courted by Internazionale, he was ultimately rejected as the club believed his left-foot only shooting could not match that of their striker Sandro Mazzola.[tpl]cite web|title=PULICI - GRAZIANI : IN DUE PER UN GRANDE TORINO|url=http://golcalcio.it/I%20gemelli%20del%20gol.htm|publisher=Gol Calcio|accessdate=21 March 2014[/tpl] Torino acquired him in 1967 from Legnano and then coach Edmondo Fabbri launched him as a starter for the club in 1968–69 as a starter in Torino-Cagliari (0–0). In his first four seasons at Torino (three as starter), he played in 79 league games, only scoring 9 goals due to technical shortcomings and lack of composure in front of goal.[tpl]cite book|last=Bacci|first=G.|title=Il calcio dietro le quinte|pages=65–66|editor=ECO Sport[/tpl]
In 1972 the coach Gustavo Giagnoni excluded Pulici from the starting lineup for a period of two months, devoting him to the technical refinement with the help of the technicians of the youth sector. In the league from 1972–73 he scored 17 goals, emerging as top scorer in Serie A along with Gianni Rivera and Giuseppe Savoldi.[tpl]cite web|title=Italy Top Scorers|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/italtops.html|publisher=RSSSF[/tpl] He repeated this feat in 1974–75 (18 goals) and in 1975–76, when he scored 21 goals in the season won by Torino, playing in tandem with Francesco Graziani. The two were nicknamed "i gemelli del gol"[tpl]cite web|title=ALL TOGHETER NOW|url=http://golcalcio.it/I%20gemelli%20del%20gol.htm|work=golcalcio.it|language=Italian|accessdate=23 April 2014[/tpl]  ('the twins of goal'): Pulici's goal was decisive in the final round of the season against A.C.

In subsequent years after the conquest of the Scudetto, his number of goals diminished, scoring a minimum of 3 in the 1979–80 season, coinciding with the departure of Torino head coach Luigi Radice.
