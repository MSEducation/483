Interstate 39 (I-39) is a highway in the midwestern United States. I-39 runs from Normal, Illinois at I-55 to Wisconsin Highway 29 (WIS 29) in Rib Mountain, Wisconsin, approximately [tpl]convert|6|mi|km|spell=in[/tpl] southwest of Wausau.[tpl]google maps |url=http://www.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=189581027214663335,40.543091,-89.002832%3B6774789599481304502,44.888289,-89.639920&saddr=I-39+N+%4040.543091,+-89.002832&daddr=44.888776,-89.63994&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=1&sz=15&sll=44.892576,-89.638009&sspn=0.013742,0.028839&ie=UTF8&ll=43.34116,-89.165039&spn=7.222549,14.765625&z=6 |title=Overview Map of I-39 |accessdate= February 15, 2008[/tpl] I-39 was designed to replace US Highway 51 (US 51), which in the early 1980s was one of the busiest two-lane highways in the United States.  I-39 was built in the 1980s and 1990s.
In Illinois, the route has a total length of [tpl]convert|140.82|mi|km|2[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |author=Illinois Technology Transfer Center |url=http://www.dot.state.il.us/gist2/select.html |title=T2 GIS Data |publisher= Illinois Department of Transportation |accessdate= November 8, 2007 |year=2006[/tpl] In Wisconsin, I-39 has a distance of [tpl]convert|182|mi|km[/tpl]. With the exception of an [tpl]convert|8|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in[/tpl] segment around Portage, the Interstate shares a route with at least one other route number in the state.  From Rockford to Portage, I-39 is concurrent with I-90.  I-94 joins the pair in Madison until Portage. At [tpl]convert|29|mi|km[/tpl] in length, this concurrency of three Interstates is the longest in the country. From Portage northward, US 51 is co-signed with the Interstate and has its exits based on its mileage.

==Route description==

===Illinois===

In Illinois, I-39 begins from Interstate 55 north of the Bloomington-Normal, Illinois, area alongside of Route 251. It runs north largely through rural areas from the city of Normal. About [tpl]convert|55|mi|km|0[/tpl] north of the city, I-39 crosses the Illinois River over the Abraham Lincoln Memorial Bridge, which is [tpl]convert|2170.8|m|mi|1[/tpl] long.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nationalbridges.com/index.php?option=com_lqm&b1849fc92c286e5b5ed0fbf618d953ae=1&task=showResults&query=8&lqm_id=169862&&format=raw&&Itemid=2  |title=Structure 000050019120847 |author= Staff |work= National Bridge Inventory |publisher= Federal Highway Administration |accessdate= June 1, 2012[/tpl] Just north of the Illinois River, I-39 runs east of the cities of LaSalle and Peru before intersecting Interstate 80. North of I-80, the wind turbines of the Mendota Hills Wind Farm can be seen from milepost 72 at Mendota north to near Paw Paw. Further north I-39 runs along the south and east sides of Rockford, concurrent with U.S. 20.  The interstate joins the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway and Interstate 90 near Cherry Valley, during which there is a toll booth in South Beloit. U.S. 51 leaves I-39/90 in South Beloit, while I-39/90 continue north into Wisconsin.
For all but [tpl]convert|1|mi|km|0[/tpl] that Interstate 39 is in Illinois, it is designated concurrently with U.S. Route 51. The southern terminus of I-39 is less than [tpl]convert|1|mi|km|0[/tpl] from Interstate 74 as it runs around Normal.

===Wisconsin===

I-39 enters from Illinois along with I-90, passing under Stateline road, and bypasses Beloit to the east. East of the town, the route has a cloverleaf interchange that serves as the terminus for both WIS 81—which heads westward into Beloit—and I-43, which provides access to Milwaukee. The I-39/90 concurrency continues to the north and is joined by WIS 11 about 7 mi (11 km) north of the I-43 interchange. The route bypasses Janesville to the east, although interchanges with US 14 (where WIS 81 leaves the concurrency) and WIS 26 provide access to the town. The route continues generally to the north, crossing the Rock River before having an interchange with WIS 59 that provides access to Edgerton to the west.[tpl]cite map |url= http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/travel/maps/docs/counties/rock.pdf |format= PDF |title= Rock County |publisher= Wisconsin Department of Transportation |accessdate= January 12, 2007[/tpl] Subsequently, the route enters Dane County as it passes west of Lake Koshkonong. It is joined by US 51 and serves as the southern terminus of WIS 73. US 51 leaves the route 4 mi (6 km) to the north, about 7 mi (11 km) east of Stoughton. The Interstate gradually turns westward around Utica to an interchange with CTH N.  It then turns gradually back to the north and interchanges with US 12 and US 18 in Madison.  I-39 and I-90 bypass Madison to the east, and I-94 joins the concurrency at the eastern terminus of WIS 30, an interchange known as the Badger Interchange.[tpl]cite press release |first= Jim |last= Buschkopf |url= http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/opencms/export/nr/modules/news/news_0396.html_786229440.html |title= I-94 reconstruction to be discussed September 19 |publisher=Wisconsin Department of Transportation |accessdate= January 12, 2007 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080827230235/http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/opencms/export/nr/modules/news/news_0396.html_786229440.html |archivedate=  August 27, 2008[/tpl] About 2 mi (3 km) to the north, the highway crosses US 151, which includes a south-side access to High Crossing Boulevard.  The last two Madison area interchanges are US 51 three miles (5 km) northwest of the US 151 interchange and WIS 19 another mile northwest of the US 51 interchange. Access is provided to CTH V just west of DeForest four miles (6 km) further north. I-39/I-90/I-94 enter Columbia County four miles (6 km) north-northwest of CTH V.[tpl]cite map |url= http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/travel/maps/docs/counties/dane.pdf |format= PDF |title= Dane County |publisher= Wisconsin Department of Transportation |accessdate= January 12, 2007[/tpl]
The Interstates cross WIS 60 at an interchange three miles (5 km) north of the county line west of Arlington and CTH CS at another interchange four miles (6 km) further north near Poynette.  The highway crosses the Wisconsin River four miles (6 km) north of CTH CS.  At three miles (5 km) further along the route from the river, I-39 leaves the concurrency with I-90 and I-94 and turns northward while the other two interstates turn northwest.  WIS 78 terminates at this interchange and heads southwest.  This is the starting point of the segment of freeway that carries the I-39 route alone.  The interstate crosses WIS 33, the first of three interchanges accessing Portage, two miles (3 km) north of I-90/I-94.    After crossing the Wisconsin River again, I-39 crosses the second interchange—this one with WIS 16 and turns northeast to an interchange with US 51.  The US route joins the Interstate and both turn north once again and leave the Portage area and, after four miles (6 km), enter Marquette County.[tpl]cite map |url= http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/travel/maps/docs/counties/columbia.pdf |format= PDF |title= Columbia County |publisher= Wisconsin Department of Transportation |accessdate= January 12, 2007[/tpl]
WIS 23 joins I-39/US 51 northbound, 4 miles (6 km) from the county line.  The three highways pass along Buffalo Lake and encounter a south-side half interchange with CTH D in the town of Packwaukee.  WIS 23 leave the concurrency to the east at WIS 82 near Oxford. and the freeway takes a due north route to pass Westfield. I-39/US 51 enters Waushara County six miles (10 km) north of Westfield.[tpl]cite map |url= http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/travel/maps/docs/counties/marquette.pdf |format= PDF |title= Marquette County |publisher= Wisconsin Department of Transportation |accessdate= January 12, 2007[/tpl]  Four miles north of the county line, I-39 / US 51 junction with WIS 21 in Coloma.  I-39/US 51 meet an interchange in Hancock with CTH V five miles (8 km) further north and WIS 73 crosses in Plainfield after another five miles (8 km).  This is two miles (3 km) south of the Portage County line.[tpl]cite map |url= http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/travel/maps/docs/counties/waushara.pdf |format= PDF |title= Waushara County |publisher= Wisconsin Department of Transportation |accessdate= January 12, 2007[/tpl] In Portage County, I-39/US 51 takes a straight due north trajectory which provides access to CTH D, CTH W and WIS 54 (also Business U.S. 51) over twelve miles (19 km).  The WIS 54 interchange and the CTH B interchange a mile and a half north of it provide access for Plover.  The next four interchanges—CTH HH, US 10 Eastbound / WIS 66 Westbound, Stanley Street and Business US 51 provide access to Stevens Point.  Amongst these interchanges, the freeway turns northwestward, bypassing the city to the east and north.  I-39/US 51 cross two more interchanges while in Portage County: Casimir Road four miles (6 km) northwest of Stevens Point,[tpl]google maps |url= http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=Casimir+Road,+Stevens+Point,+Wisconsin&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=46.495626,82.265625&ie=UTF8&z=16&iwloc=addr&om=1 |title=Casimir Road, Stevens Point, Wisconsin |accessdate= January 12, 2008[/tpl] and Westbound US 10 two miles (3 km) north of Casimir Road.  The freeway then parallels the Wisconsin River for six miles (10 km) to an Interchange with CTH DB east of Lake DuBay and one mile (1.6 km) south of the Marathon County line.[tpl]cite map |url= http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/travel/maps/docs/counties/portage.pdf |format= PDF |title= Portage County |publisher= Wisconsin Department of Transportation |accessdate= January 12, 2007[/tpl]
WIS 34 terminates at an interchange with I-39/US 51 in Knowlton three miles (5 km) northwest of the freeway's entry into Marathon County.  The freeway turns due north from this interchange. WIS 153 crosses the freeway four miles further north in Mosinee.  Maple Ridge Road crosses after another two miles (3 km) as the freeway turns northeastward into Kronenwetter.[tpl]google maps |url= http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=Maple+Ridge+Road,+Mosinee,+Wisconsin&sll=44.81146,-89.65496&sspn=0.040919,0.080338&ie=UTF8&z=14&iwloc=addr&om=1 |title= Maple Ridge Road, Mosinee, Wisconsin |accessdate= January 12, 2008[/tpl] An interchange with Business US 51 is just south of the Wisconsin River crossing after four miles (6 km) from Maple Ridge Road.  I-39 ends two miles (3 km) further north at the interchange with WIS 29 East just southwest of Wausau.[tpl]cite map |url= http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/travel/maps/docs/counties/marathon.pdf |format= PDF |title= Marathon County |publisher= Wisconsin Department of Transportation |accessdate= January 12, 2007[/tpl]

==History==

The genesis of Interstate 39 dates back to 1945, when the United States began planning the first 40,000 mile interstate system. An initial request was made for a north-south highway from South Beloit to Salem, Illinois. and in 1956, legislation provided funding for the highway. However, the project was deemed a low priorty and was shelved. Nonetheless, a portion of the present-day Interstate 39 was built as part of the Northwest Tollway (now Jane Addams Memorial Tollway) in 1958. In 1963, the U.S 20 Rockford bypass was constructed. U.S 51, which ran mostly down the middle of the state, became a heavily traveled two-lane arterial road.
In the late 1960s and early 1970's, a major supplemental freeway system plan was proposed, with the goal of providing Illinois residents access to freeways within 30 minutes or less. One of the proposed routes, FAP 412, was a route that would extend from the U.S 20 Rockford Bypass to Interstate 57 between Salem and Alma, Illinois. However, only the portion between Rockford and Decatur was prioritized.[tpl]cite maps |publisher= Illinois Department of Transportation |url= http://www.midwestroads.com/illinois/il%20supp%20fwy.pdf |format= PDF |title= Priority Primary Routes |date= April 12, 1978 |accessdate= March 23, 2010[/tpl]
Construction on the FAP 412 freeway began in 1979. I-39 was first established in 1984 on the section from Illinois Route 5 (now Interstate 88) in Rochelle, to U.S. Route 20 in Rockford.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-039.html |title=Interstate 39 |accessdate=11 January 2009 |work= Interstate Guide |publisher=AA Roads (Self-published) |date= July 29, 2008[/tpl][tpl]verify credibility|failed=y|date=March 2014[/tpl] I-39 was completed south from Route 5 to I-80 in 1986. By December 1987, construction on the section of I-39 between I-80 and Illinois Route 251 was finished. The next section, between Illinois Route 251 and Interstate 55 in Bloomington, opened in 1992, completing the southern part of I-39.[tpl]cite web |last= Carlson |first= Rich |date= November 18, 2007 |url= http://www.n9jig.com/21-40.html |work= Illinois Highways Page |title= Routes 21 through 40 |accessdate= January 11, 2009 |publisher= Self-published [/tpl][tpl]verify credibility|failed=y|date=March 2014[/tpl] In December 1989, the section from Bloomington to Hudson opened, a distance of about [tpl]convert|4.4|mi|km|1[/tpl][tpl]cite news |work=The Pantagraph |location= Bloomington, IL |title= Interstate 39: Crews work to link highway by 1992 |last= Zehr |first= Melissa |date= March 8, 1991[/tpl] In early September 1992, another segment opened from IL 116 north to IL 17.[tpl]cite news |work= Peoria Journal-Star |date= September 2, 1992 |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&p_topdoc=1&p_docnum=1&p_sort=YMD_date%3AD&p_product=NewsBank&p_text_direct-0=document_id=%20%200EB6EAF34E7EB053%20%20&p_docid=0EB6EAF34E7EB053&p_theme=aggregated4&p_queryname=0EB6EAF34E7EB053&f_openurl=yes&p_nbid=O54E56XJMTE5NzMwNTE2NS41MDEzNzI6MTo3OnJmLTg3MjU&&p_multi=PJSB#7117694631508559435 |last=Davis |first= Jenni |title= I-39 nearly finished; 12 more miles open today[/tpl] [tpl]registration required[/tpl]
However, the proposed extension of I-39 between Bloomington-Normal and Decatur was never completed, due to local opposition and lack of funding. U.S 51 between Bloomington and Decatur was instead upgraded to an expressway, with mostly at-grade intersections.
In Wisconsin, the route was officially designated in 1992.[tpl]cite web |last= Bessert |first= Chris |date= January 2, 2008 |title= Highways 30-39 |work= Wisconsin Highways |url= http://www.wisconsinhighways.org/listings/WiscHwys30-39.html#I-039 |publisher= Self-published |accessdate= January 12, 2008[/tpl][tpl]verify credibility|failed=y|date=March 2014[/tpl] In October 1993, AASHTO established part of I-39 in its northern section between Rockford and Rib Mountain, Wisconsin, then designated I-39 along existing portions of I-90, I-94, and U.S. Route 51. However, this part of the highway was not marked as I-39 for another four years, primarily because the Wisconsin Highway Department had to reconstruct the interchange connecting I-90 and I-94 with Wisconsin Highway 78 near Portage. Signs denoting I-39 were placed along the highway in Wisconsin until 1996, when the section  between Portage and Rib Mountain, Wisconsin (near Wausau) received its signs. This occurred after then Governor Tommy Thompson designated the stretch between Portage and Wausau in 1996 after a five-year push to get the interstate designation approved.[tpl]cite news |first= Steven |last= Walters |title= US 51 will become I-39 between Portage, Wausau |work = Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |url= http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MWSB&p_theme=mwsb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB82963E8D06152&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |date= January 16, 1996 |accessdate= January 12, 2008[/tpl] The remaining segment along I-90/I-94 was not signed for I-39 until late 1998  The section between the I-90/I-94 interchange and US 51's interchange in Portage was previously a part of WIS 78.  That route was truncated back to its current terminus when the Interstate's designation went into effect.[tpl]cite web |last= Bessert |first= Chris |date= January 2, 2008 |title= Highways 70-79 |work= Wisconsin Highways |url= http://www.wisconsinhighways.org/listings/WiscHwys70-79.html#STH_078 |publisher= Self-published |accessdate= January 12, 2008[/tpl][tpl]verify credibility|failed=y|date=March 2014[/tpl] The designation of I-39 violated Wisconsin's rule of not having any state trunkline number duplicated—Interstate, U.S. or state—as WIS 39 already existed.
Interstate 39 was considered at one point for the unbuilt Peoria-to-Chicago Highway.

==Future==

As of October 2007, the Illinois Department of Transportation is in the preliminary design stages for a project involving reconstruction of I-39 from US 20 east to Harrison Avenue in Rockford. The goal of the project is to reconstruct ramps to modern-day standards, and allow southbound I-39 traffic to use through lanes at the US 20 interchange.[tpl]cite web |author= Staff |url= http://www.dot.state.il.us/US20-I39/default.html |year= 2007 |accessdate= October 12, 2007 |title=I-39/US 20 Improvement Project |publisher= Illinois Department of Transportation[/tpl] Currently, southbound I-39 traffic must exit from the US 20 freeway on a single lane ramp.
