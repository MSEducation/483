Dianthus caryophyllus, carnation or clove pink, is a species of Dianthus. It is probably native to the Mediterranean region but its exact range is unknown due to extensive cultivation for the last 2,000 years.Med-Checklist: Dianthus caryophyllusFlora Europaea: Dianthus caryophyllusBlamey, M. & Grey-Wilson, C.

It is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to 80 cm tall. The leaves are glaucous greyish green to blue-green, slender, up to 15 cm long. The flowers are produced singly or up to five together in a cyme; they are 3–5 cm diameter, and sweetly scented; the original natural flower colour is bright pinkish-purple, but cultivars of other colours, including red, white, yellow and green, have been developed.Flora of NW Europe: Dianthus caryophyllus
Some fragrance-less carnation cultivars are often used as boutonnieres for men.

====Traditional meanings====

For the most part, carnations express love, fascination, and distinction, though there are many variations dependent on colour.
The formal name for carnation, dianthus, comes from Greek for "heavenly flower", or the flower of Jove.

====Holidays and events====

Carnations are often worn on special occasions, especially Mother's Day and weddings. In 1907, Anna Jarvis chose a carnation as the emblem of Mother's Day because it was her mother's favourite flower.[tpl]Cite book| title = Consumer Rites: The Buying and Selling of American Holidays | author = Leigh Eric Schmidt | edition = reprint, illustrated | editor = Princeton University Press | year = 1997 | page = 260 | isbn = 0-691-01721-2 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=maF8mTPsJqsC&pg=PA260&dq=carnation+mother%27s+day[/tpl] This tradition is now observed in the United States and Canada on the second Sunday in May.

In Korea, carnations express admiration, love and gratitude. Red and pink carnations are worn on Parents Day (Korea does not separate Mother's Day or Father's Day, but has Parents Day on 8 May). Sometimes, parents wear a corsage of carnation(s) on their left chest on Parents Day.  Carnations are also worn on Teachers Day (15 May).[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
Red carnations are worn on May Day as a symbol of socialism and the labour movement in some countries, such as Austria, Italy,[tpl]Cite web| url=http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/sr263/flett.htm | title=May Day | author=Keith Flett | year=2002 | publisher=Socialist Review | accessdate=4 March 2010[/tpl] and successor countries of the former Yugoslavia. The red carnation is also the symbol of the Portuguese Carnation Revolution.
Green carnations are for St. Patrick's Day and were famously worn by the Irish writer Oscar Wilde. The green carnation thence became a symbol of homosexuality in the early 20th century, especially through the book The Green Carnation and Noël Coward's song, "We All Wear a Green Carnation" in his operetta, Bitter Sweet.
At the University of Oxford, carnations are traditionally worn to all examinations; white for the first exam, pink for exams in between, and red for the last exam. One story explaining this tradition relates that initially a white carnation was kept in a red inkpot between exams, so by the last exam it was fully red; the story is thought to originate in the late 1990s.[tpl]Cite web| url=http://ask.metafilter.com/59198/Why-do-students-at-Oxford-University-wear-carnations-to-exams | title=Why do students at Oxford University wear carnations to exams | accessdate=4 March 2010[/tpl]

====Symbols of territorial entities and organizations====

Carnation is the national flower of Spain, Monaco, and Slovenia, and the provincial flower of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands. The state flower of Ohio is a scarlet carnation, which was introduced to the state by Levi L. Lamborn. The choice was made to honor William McKinley, Ohio Governor and U.S. President, who was assassinated in 1901, and regularly wore a scarlet carnation on his lapel.Anderson's Online Documentation: Floral emblem of state (Ohio)

===Colors===

Carnations do not naturally produce the pigment delphinidin, thus a blue carnation cannot occur by natural selection or be created by traditional plant breeding. It shares this characteristic with other widely sold flowers like roses, lilies, tulips, chrysanthemums and gerberas.
Around 1996 a company, Florigene, used genetic engineering to extract certain genes from petunia and snapdragon flowers to produce a blue-mauve carnation, which was commercialized as Moondust.  In 1998 a violet carnation called Moonshadow was commercialized.Phys.Org website. 4 April 2005 Plant gene replacement results in the world's only blue rose As of 2004 three additional blue-violet/purple varieties have been commercialized.[tpl]Cite web|title= GM Carnations in Australia.

==Etymology==

Carnations were mentioned in Greek literature 2,000 years ago.  "Dianthus" was coined by Greek botanist Theophrastus, and is derived from the Greek words for divine ("dios") and flower ("anthos")."What in Carnation?", Wall Street Journal, Off Duty Section, 23–24 October 2010, p.D1 Some scholars believe that the name "carnation" comes from "coronation" or "corone" (flower garlands), as it was one of the flowers used in Greek ceremonial crowns. Others think the name stems from the Latin "caro" (genitive "carnis") (flesh), which refers to the original colour of the flower, or incarnatio (incarnation), which refers to the incarnation of God made flesh.
Although originally applied to the species Dianthus caryophyllus, the name Carnation is also often applied to some of the other species of Dianthus, and more particularly to garden hybrids between D. caryophyllus and other species in the genus.
