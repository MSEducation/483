The George Foster Peabody Awards (or simply Peabody Awards) program, named for businessman and philanthropist George Peabody, recognizes distinguished and meritorious public service by radio and television stations, networks, online media, producing organizations, and individuals. 
Reflecting excellence in quality, rather than popularity or commercial success, the Peabody is awarded to about 25–35 winners; annually from more than 1,000 entries.[tpl]cite web|first=Lee |last=Shearer |url=http://onlineathens.com/stories/032701/uga_0327010006.shtml |title=UGA names new Peabody director |work=Athens Banner-Herald |date=2001-03-27 |accessdate=2013-04-11[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0UwLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=11IDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6671,4207961&dq=peabody-award+television+1948&hl=en |work=The Daily Courier |date=September 26, 2002 |accessdate=2013-04-11 |publisher=Google News |first=Frazier |last=Moore |authorlink=Frazier Moore |agency=Associated Press |title=Emmys over?

==History==

In 1939, the National Association of Broadcasters formed a committee to recognize outstanding achievement in radio broadcasting.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NQ1SAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KzUNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2642,2766145&dq=1939+national+association+of+broadcasters+peabody&hl=en |work=The Albany Herald |publisher=Google News |date=1989-01-19 |accessdate=2013-04-11 |agency=Associated Press |title=Broadcasters Honor Rusk[/tpl] Committee member Lambdin Kay, public-service director for WSB radio in Atlanta, Georgia at the time, is credited for creating the award, named for businessman and philanthropist George Foster Peabody, who donated the funds that made the awards possible.[tpl]cite journal|title=Radio: New Order of Merit |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,765429,00.html |magazine=TIME |publisher=Time Inc. |date=7 April 1941 |accessdate=14 September 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Subscription required|date=April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|agency=PR Newswire |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/11048680/60-minutes-journalist-to-deliver-ugas-peabody-smithgall-lecture.html |title=60 Minutes Journalist To Deliver UGA's Peabody-Smithgall Lecture |publisher=TheStreet.com |date=2011-03-16 |accessdate=2013-04-23[/tpl] Fellow WSB employee Lessie Smithgall introduced Lambdin to John E.

Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, as its permanent home.
The Peabody Awards were originally only for radio, but in 1948 television awards were introduced. In the late 1990s additional categories for material distributed via the World Wide Web were added. Materials created solely for theatrical motion picture release are not eligible.

==Peabody judging==

The Peabody Awards judging process is unusually rigorous. Evaluation of the more than 1,000 entries typically received begins in early February with some 30 committees composed of a number of University of Georgia faculty or staff members and selected students.[tpl]cite web|first=Lance |last=Cummins |url=http://www.thecitizen.com/archive/main/archive-040317/weekend/w-07.html |title=Local student to judge Peabodys |publisher=TheCitizen |date=2004-03-17 |accessdate=2013-04-23[/tpl] Each committee is charged with screening or listening to a small number of entries and delivering written recommendations to the Peabody Board, a ~16-member panel of scholars, critics and media-industry professionals. Board members discuss recommended entries as well as their own selections at intensive preliminary meetings in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. The Board convenes at the Peabody Offices on the University of Georgia campus in late March for final screenings and deliberations. Each entrant is judged on their own merit, and only unanimously selected programs receive Peabodys. There is no set number of Peabodys; the all-time record for Peabody recipients in a single year is 46 Awards in 2013."Peabody Hands Out A Record 46 Awards," from TVNewsCheck, 4/2/2014

==Peabody Awards Archive==

The Peabody Awards Collection is the flagship of The Walter J. Brown Media Archive & Peabody Awards Collection. The archives are housed in the "Special Collections Library" near the north campus of The University of Georgia. The archives mission is to preserve, protect, and provide access to the moving image and sound materials that reflect the collective memory of broadcasting and the history of the state of Georgia and its people. The collection contains nearly every entry for the first major broadcast award given in the United States. Entries begin in 1940 for radio and 1948 for television, and at least 1,000 new entries are received every year—programs created by local, national, and international producers. The collection provides a cultural cross-section of television from its infancy to the present day, featuring news, documentary, entertainment, educational, and children's programming. Once judging is complete all the entries are moved to the Main Library for in-depth cataloging, access, and long term preservation.UGA Libraries
