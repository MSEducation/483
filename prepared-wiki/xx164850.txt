In addition to Prince George, the Citizen also covers the outlying communities of Fort St. James, Fraser Lake, Mackenzie, McBride, Quesnel, and Vanderhoof, British Columbia.

Along with several other small British Columbia dailies, The Prince George Citizen was one of the last Canadian properties to be held by Hollinger Inc., the media conglomerate owned by Conrad Black. Hollinger sold its remaining Canadian holdings to Vancouver-based Glacier Ventures International, later called Glacier Media, in 2006.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/PrintArticle/Oh-Canada-Hollinger-International-Exits-Nation-With-104M-Deal|title=Oh, Canada!
