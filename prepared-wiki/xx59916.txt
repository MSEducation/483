[[Tray]]

CATEGORIES: Furniture, Serving and dining, Gardening aids

A tray is a shallow platform designed for carrying things. It can be fashioned from numerous materials, including silver, brass, sheet iron, wood, melamine, and papier-mâché. Some examples have raised galleries, handles, and short feet for support.
Trays are flat, but with raised edges to stop things from sliding off of them. They are made in a range of shapes but are commonly found in oval or rectangular forms, sometimes with cutout or attached handles with which to carry them.
