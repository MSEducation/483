Matthew Edward Cassar (born 16 October 1972) is a former Australian cricketer. He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler who represented Derbyshire from 1994 to 2000 and Northamptonshire from 2001 and 2002.
Cassar joined Derbyshire in the 1994 season and played a promising first-class game against the New Zealanders in June. However, due to him being born in Australia and therefore having to go through a period of residential qualification, he played primarily in the Second XI Championship. His debut game was against Gloucestershire, and he scored a half-century in his second innings. A regular fixture in the Second XI team until the 1997 season, by which time he had completed his qualification period, he made his breakthrough in County Cricket in that year.
He played consistently for the team until the 2000 season, when he transferred to Northamptonshire in a bid to gain higher honors. Injury curtailed his career however, and after two operations to cure a sportsman's hernia injury, which proved to be unsuccessful, he left the game at the end of the 2002 season.
Due to his injuries, Cassar then went on to follow a career in financial advising. He founded financial services companies 'Wizard Finance' and 'Derby Money' in Derby, UK. He is also a director of 'Online Mortgage Advisor', a UK mortgage information and advice website.
