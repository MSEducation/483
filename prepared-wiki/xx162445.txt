[[Climate of Florida]]

CATEGORIES: Climate of Florida

The climate of the north and central parts of the US state of Florida is humid subtropical. South Florida has a tropical climate.Köppen Classification Map, clearly showing South Florida has a tropical climate (image will take a few seconds to load) There is a defined rainy season from June through September, which are the months most at risk of landfalling tropical cyclones. Thunderstorms lead to several lightning-strike deaths per year statewide. Florida is one of the most tornado-prone states in the United States. During mid summer, dust emanating from Africa affects the state. 
Between October and May, Florida is often dry. Occasionally, fronts  sweep through the northern and central parts of the state which brings some light rainfall. Towards the end of the dry season in the spring, brush fires become common statewide. In winters where an El Niño climate cycle exists, rainfall increases while temperatures are cooler statewide. On average, most areas of Florida do not experience any type of frozen precipitation, although a few areas north Florida can see a fleeting period of snow or sleet every few years to decade. 
The Gulf Stream running through the Florida Straits and off the Florida East Coast keep temperatures moderate across the southern peninsula year round, with few extremes in temperature.

==Wind==

Over the entire year, winds average out of the north across the panhandle and near Orlando, out of the west at Gainesville and Jacksonville, and generally out of the east elsewhere. During the summer months, the average wind pattern implies a surface ridge axis normally lies across central Florida, with easterly winds from Tampa southward and southwest winds across northern Florida, once Orlando is not considered for the distribution. The peak wind gust during the 1930 through 1997 period was 115 mph/100 knots at Miami International Airport during Hurricane Andrew.National Climatic Data Center.

===African dust outbreaks===

In July the tradewinds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward into Florida. On occasion, dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge moves into the state, suppressing rainfall and changing the sky from a blue to a white appearance and leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality across the Southeastern United States during the summer, by adding to the count of airborne particulates. This is in sharp contrast to the normally clean air over Florida and the southeastern USA, which on average in the cleanest air in the USA. Science Daily.

===Summer===

During the summer, minima range from near [tpl]convert|70|°F|°C[/tpl] in northern Florida to near [tpl]convert|80|°F|°C[/tpl] in the Keys. High temperatures during the summer average in the lower 90s Fahrenheit statewide.Southeast Regional Climate Center. Historical Climate Summaries for Florida. Retrieved on 2007-06-02. Relief from the heat during the summer comes in the form of afternoon and evening thunderstorm activity, late morning and afternoon sea breezes off the relatively cooler ocean, and during the passage of a tropical cyclone. The passage of a cold front through the state is rare during the warm season.  The record high temperature for the state is [tpl]convert|109|°F|°C[/tpl] at Monticello in 1931.

==Fog==

Like the remainder of the Southeastern United States, Florida has a winter maximum in dense fog conditions. Unlike the remainder of the region, the maximum in Florida contains roughly half of the annual occurrences per year, on average. Its summer minimum is less than the remainder of the Southeast. The annual number of heavy fog days (with visibility of [tpl]convert|.25|miles[/tpl] or less) has ranged from 50 in Tallahassee, to 1 in Key West, the least foggy region in the state. The two types of fog that are mostly common in Florida are advection and radiational. Fog can be hazardous  to early morning commuters. On January 9, 2008, when fog on Interstate 4 combined with smoke from a nearby fire reduced visibility to nearly zero. As a result, five individuals died in a 70-car pileup.Gloria Forthun, M. B.

==Precipitation==

===Averages===

Statewide, the highest rainfall amounts occur during the summer months. In northern Florida, there is a weak winter secondary maximum while statewide the driest months of the year are during the spring.  During El Niño, Florida sees greater rainfall between November and March.  Due to the lack of the secondary maximum across the peninsula, a distinct dry season is seen in the averages from winter through spring. This dry season provokes brush fires annually as temperatures rise during the late spring, before they fade during early June as the rainy season gets underway.

===Extremes===

The heaviest rainfall to occur in 24 hours was measured in Yankeetown during Hurricane Easy (1950), [tpl]convert|38.70|in|cm[/tpl].

==Thunderstorms==

Florida reports more thunderstorms than any other US state. Some places report in excess of 90 thunderstorm days per year, making Florida one of the most thundery regions outside of the tropics. 
Florida receives the highest density of lightning strikes within the United States.  Several deaths per year are blamed on lightning, making lightning one of the deadliest weather-related phenomenon in the state.  However, since 1992, the number of lightning deaths has been slowly dropping despite a rising population, suggesting that lightning awareness programs are effective.  The most likely targets of lightning strikes are construction workers and others who work outside, though 12 percent of the cases occurred indoors to people using electronic devices.
Severe thunderstorms can sometimes produce hail, very strong straight line winds and tornadoes. Very heavy rainfall from thunderstorms can result in flash flooding. Thunderstorms occur most often during the summer but can occur at any time of the year.

There are fewer deaths and property damage than are experienced by some other states.  Strong tornadoes do occasionally form in Florida, usually in conjunctions with a cold frontal passage in the winter or spring.  A total of 42 people died in February 1998 from the deadliest such tornado outbreak in Central Florida, which occurred during the nighttime hours.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/os/assessments/pdfs/cntrlfl.pdf|title=Service Assessment: Central Florida Tornado Outbreak February 22–23, 1998|author=United States Department of Commerce|publisher=National Weather Service|date=June 1998|accessdate=2009-09-05[/tpl]

==Tropical cyclones==

The earliest in the year a tropical cyclone has struck the sunshine state was the Groundhog Day Tropical Storm in 1952. The latest impact was from a hurricane which struck near Tampa on December 1, 1925. The strongest hurricane to strike Florida was the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935. Hurricane Easy in 1950 produced the wettest known point total from any tropical cyclone.  The record number of hurricane strikes on the state in one season is four in 2004.National Hurricane Center.

Tropical cyclones have affected Florida in every month of the year but January and March. Nearly one-third of the cyclones affected the state in September, and nearly three-fourths of the storms affected the state between August and October, which coincides with the peak of the hurricane season. Portions of the coastline have the lowest return period, or the frequency at which a certain intensity or category of hurricane can be expected within 86 mi (139 km) of a given location, in the country. Monroe County was struck by 26 hurricanes since 1926, which is the greatest total for any county in the United States.[tpl]cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=2006|title=Tropical Cyclone Climatology|accessdate=2007-10-02|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastprofile.shtml[/tpl]

==Effect of climate cycles==

El Niño has the following effects on Florida climate: above average rainfall in the spring.[tpl]Cite news | first=Jim | last=Waymer | title=Casualties of cold enhance fire fear | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20100311/NEWS01/3110311/Casualties-of-cold-enhance-fire-fear| work= | publisher=Florida Today | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 1A | date=11 March 2010 | id= | accessdate=[/tpl] This is followed by wildfire threat when rain dries up. Northern Florida is more susceptible to severe weather; below normal temperatures, increased number of low pressure systems in the Gulf of Mexico during the winter, and "almost always" reduces the frequency of storms and hurricanes.Florida Disaster Management accessed March 9, 2008 [tpl]dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot[/tpl] 
La Niña has the following effects: often dry conditions prevail in late fall, winter and early spring, increased risk of wildfires in spring and summer months, the temperatures average slightly above normal, and the chance of hurricane activity increases substantially.
Long term forecasts are made based on these effects. However, they are easily overridden, in winter, by the Arctic oscillation and North Atlantic oscillations, which can only be predicted about two weeks in advance.[tpl]Cite news | first=Doyle | last=Rice | title=Winter "wild card" in play | url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/forecast/2010-12-28-whysocold28_ST_N.htm?csp=34news&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UsatodaycomNation-TopStories+%28News+-+Nation+-+Top+Stories%29| work= | publisher=Florida Today | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 4A | date=28 December 2010 | id= | accessdate=[/tpl] These can drop the temperature noticeably from seasonal norms.

==Climates of selected Florida cities==

The climate regime for much of the state is humid subtropical (Köppen Cfa), though portions of the Gold Coast of southeast Florida, as well as all of the Florida Keys, qualify as tropical wet-and-dry (Köppen Aw).
A narrow eastern part of the state including Orlando and Jacksonville receives between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of sunshine annually. The rest of the state, including Miami, receives between 2,800 and 3,200 hours annually.[tpl]cite web|url=http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm|title=united states annual sunshine map|publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc|accessdate=2011-03-14[/tpl]
