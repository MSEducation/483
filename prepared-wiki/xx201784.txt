Harlesthorpe is a village in Bolsover (district), in the county of Derbyshire. It is a peculiar village, located literally just north of Clowne, but almost a part of Clowne. It is separated by the Harlesthorpe Dam, a large Pond, the village is accessible, from the Rotherham Road, A618.
Harlesthorpe Dam was, or so the story used to go, used to supply a head of water to a nearby mill. The mill was said to produce cloth for making sails. This cloth was known as Bump and the name Bump Mill Pond was widely used in the locality. 
Harlesthorpe Dam has two bodies of waters to choose from and fishing is available.fishing, www.harlesthorpedam.co.uk]
