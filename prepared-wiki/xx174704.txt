==Geography==

Most of the Württemberg wine region is situated around the river Neckar and several of its tributaries, Rems, Enz, Kocher und Jagst. The geography of the wine region is dominated by these river valleys and include several south-facing slopes. The main part of Württemberg is situated between the cities of Stuttgart and Heilbronn.J.

==Grape varieties==

71% of the vines grown in Württemberg are of red grape varieties. The most common variety in Württemberg, and the region's signature grape, is the red wine grape Trollinger, which was planted on 21.2% of the vineyard surface in 2008. Trollinger gives red wines which are light in both colour and style (and occasionally made in a slightly sweet style) and Württemberg accounts for over 98% of plantings of Trollinger in Germany. Other common red varieties are Schwarzriesling (Pinot Meunier, which despite its German name is not related to "genuine" Riesling) at 15.1%, 
Lemberger (same as Austria's Blaufränkisch) at 13.9% and Spätburgunder (Pinot noir) at 11.1%. The most common white variety is Riesling (18.1%).
