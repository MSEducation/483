Healesville Sanctuary, or the Sir Colin MacKenzie Fauna Park, is a zoo specializing in native Australian animals. It is located at Healesville in rural Victoria, Australia, and has a history of breeding native animals. It is one of only two places to have successfully bred a platypus, the other being Sydney's Taronga Zoo. It also assists with a breeding population of the endangered Helmeted Honeyeater.[tpl]cite web | author = Menkhorst P, Smales I, Quin B | title = Helmeted Honeyeater Recovery Plan 1999-2003 | publisher = Australian Government, Department of the Environment and Water Resources | date = 2003 | url = http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/recovery/helmeted-h-eater/index.html | accessdate = 2007-06-21[/tpl]
The zoo is set in a natural bushland environment where paths wind through different habitat areas showcasing wallabies, wombats, dingoes, kangaroos, and over 200 native bird varieties.
Conducted tours, bird shows and information areas are available to visitors.

==History==

Dr Colin MacKenzie (knighted in 1929) set up the Institute of Anatomical Research in 1920 on [tpl]Convert|78|acre[/tpl] of land which had formerly been part of the Coranderrk Aboriginal Reserve.  The Reserve passed to the Healesville Council in 1927 and became the Sir Colin MacKenzie Sanctuary in 1934.
The first platypus bred in captivity was born at the Sanctuary in 1943 when it was managed by David Fleay.
In 2009, the sanctuary was threatened by the Black Saturday bushfires, and the sanctuary evacuated their threatened species to Melbourne Zoo.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/fire-and-flight-no-turnoff-for-horny-devils-20090905-fc5i.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | first=Melissa | last=Kent | title=Fire and flight no turn-off for horny devils | date=2009-09-06[/tpl]
