The Bachelor is an American reality television dating game show debuting in 2002 on ABC. For all seasons, the show is hosted by Chris Harrison. There are two related series: The Bachelorette and Bachelor Pad.

==Production==

It is produced and directed by Mike Fleiss and is shot by camera operator Jesse Fleiss. Supervising producer (2013–14) is Elan Gale.

==Plot==

As the show is designed, the series revolves around a single bachelor (deemed eligible) who starts with a pool of romantic interests (typically 25) from whom the bachelor is expected to select a wife. During the course of the season, the bachelor eliminates candidates (see The elimination process), with the bachelor proposing marriage to his final selection. The participants travel to romantic and exotic locations for their adventures, and the conflicts in the series, both internal and external, stem from the elimination-style format of the show.
The above description is a general guideline. In practice, the show does not always follow its designed structure, and those variations are often a source of drama and conflict.
The two most notable cases where the bachelor violated the premise of the show are Brad Womack, who selected neither of his final two women, and Jason Mesnick, who in the After the Final Rose episode broke off his engagement and proposed to the first runner-up. (The two are now married.)

==Setting==

For the first two weeks of filming the contestants stay in "Villa De La Vina," a [tpl]convert|7590|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl], six-bedroom, nine-bath home in Agoura Hills, California. The custom home, built in 2005, is located on 10 acres at 2351 Kanan Road. As of October 10, 2008, the home was listed for sale at a price of US$8.75 million.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.bergproperties.com/blog/asking-price-for-bachelorbachelorette-mansion-in-agoura-hills-ca-reduced-from-almost-13m-to-875m/|title = Asking price for Bachelor/Bachelorette mansion in Agoura Hills, CA reduced from almost $13M to $8.75M|last = Goldsborough| first = Bob| publisher = bergproperties.com |date=October 10, 2008 |accessdate=January 3, 2011[/tpl] For the third and remaining episodes are the contestants have filmed around the world. Episodes have been filmed throughout the United States, Canada, England, New Zealand, Vietnam, Korea to name just a few.  The Agoura Hills, California mansion was not used during a few seasons including season 7 that was filmed  New York City, where Charlie O'Connell, who had appeared in Sliders with his brother Jerry O'Connell, lived,  Paris, France for season 8; Rome, Italy for season 9, where Lorenzo Borghese lived who is half-Italian.

==The elimination process==

On each Bachelor episode, the bachelor interacts with the women and presents a rose to each woman he wishes to remain on the show. Those who do not receive a rose are eliminated. Eliminations are based upon the bachelor's personal feelings about each contestant, guided primarily by the impression made by each woman during dates or other events of the week. Most roses are presented at a rose ceremony at the end of each episode, but roses can also be bestowed on dates. Typical activities include
The final episodes of each season traditionally follow this pattern:
A woman may withdraw from the competition at any time if she is no longer interested in the bachelor. On rare occasions, a woman is removed from the show for breaking one of the rules.
The bachelor has wide discretion in choosing how many and when to present the roses. For example, Sean Lowe presented several roses at his initial cocktail party.
It is common to accuse a contestant for not being on the show for the right reasons, meaning that her aim is not to establish a relationship with the bachelor but rather to garner publicity for her own career, induce jealousy in an ex-boyfriend, or simply to get a free trip to exotic locations.

==Spinoffs==

The show's success has led producer Mike Fleiss to create multiple spin-offs, including The Bachelorette, in which the format is gender-reversed. The bachelorettes are  eliminated contestants from The Bachelor.
On August 9, 2010, Bachelor Pad premiered, giving previous contestants of both The Bachelor and The Bachelorette the opportunity to compete in dating-themed eliminations for $250,000.
The weddings of Trista Rehn (the first Bachelorette), Jason Mesnick (13th Bachelor) Ashley Hebert (seventh Bachelorette) and Sean Lowe (the 17th Bachelor) were broadcast as television specials. Rehn's vow-renewal ceremony upon her 10-year anniversary was also broadcast.

==Questions of authenticity==

On February 26, 2009, in an exclusive interview between The Bachelor Season 13 contestant Megan Parris, and Steve Carbone, Megan commented that the producers edit the footage to create a fictional storyline. "I don't think producers showed any real conversation I had with anyone... The viewers fail to realize that editing is what makes the show... You'll hear someone make one comment and then they'll show a clip of somebody's face to make it look like that is their facial reaction to that statement, but really, somebody made that face the day before to something else. It's just piecing things together to make a story."[tpl]cite web | url = http://realitysteve.com/2009/02/27/update-on-the-megan-interview-and-more-news-coming-later-tonight | title = My Interview with Megan Parris | accessdate = July 16, 2012 | last = Carbone | first = Steve | date = Feb 26, 2009[/tpl]
On March 26, 2009, Megan Parris argued that not only was the show scripted, but that producers bullied contestants into saying things to the camera that contestants did not want to say.[tpl]cite journal | title = Megan Parris says Bachelor producers "berate," "curse at" contestants | journal = Reality Blurred | date = Mar 29, 2009 | first = Andy | last = Dehnart| id = | url = http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/the_bachelor_13/2009_Mar_29_megan_parris_criticism | accessdate = July 16, 2012[/tpl] "'There's nothing real about it,' she said of the show's trademark "confessionals," in which contestants talk to the camera about the latest goings-on. "It is scripted," she said. "They basically will call you names, berate you, curse at you until they get you to say what they want you to say." Both ABC and Warner Bros., the studio that produces The Bachelor, had no comment."[tpl]cite news | first = Bobby | last = Cherry | title = 'Bachelor' candidate from Sewickley Hills goes off script | date = Mar 26, 2009 | url = http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/s_617830.html | work = Trib Live | accessdate = July 16, 2012[/tpl]
On March 15, 2010, creator Mike Fleiss appeared on 20/20 and said that he develops contestants into characters that will cater to his audience's tastes and that they "need their fair share of villains every season."[tpl]cite journal | title = Bachelors have sex with an average of three women, but Bob Guiney has the record with 5.5 | journal = Reality Blurred | date = Mar 16, 2010 | first = Andy | last = Dehnart| id = | url = http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/the_bachelor/2010_Mar_16_20_20_special | accessdate = July 10, 2012 | quote = “We need our fair share of villains every season.

On February 24, 2012, during the taping of The Women Tell All episode of The Bachelor, a private conversation between contestant Courtney Robertson and a show producer went public when microphones were accidentally left on in between camera takes. The conversation revealed the producer's role as a coach encouraging Robertson to fake certain emotions for the camera which she was not feeling.[tpl]cite news | first = Amy | last = Kaufman | title = 'The Bachelor' recap: Five things you didn't see on 'Women Tell All' | date = Mar 6, 2012 | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2012/03/the-bachelor-courtney-ben-women-tell-all.html | work = The LA Times | accessdate = July 10, 2012 | quote = A private conversation between Courtney and a show producer went public. During Chris’ temporary hiatus, one of the show’s producers went over to comfort Courtney, who was clearly very distraught after being attacked by numerous ladies. I was sitting backstage with a group of other journalists, watching the taping on a remote monitor. While Chris was gone, the camera and microphones were left on on-stage, and so the press was accidentally privvy to the intimate conversation. Courtney complained she felt like a deer in the headlights, and said she’d expected at least one of the women to come to her defense. “But I didn’t play with my hair once. Aren’t you proud?” she added. “Yes,” the producer replied. “That was good.” The staffer tried to distract Courtney by talking to her about the kind of cigarettes she smokes – American Spirits, apparently – and the model soon began to feel better. “I’m not feeling very emotional anymore,” she said, her tears dispersing. “You made me feel better. I appreciate it.” Then, she began to worry about coming off as too cold: “I don’t know if I can show that emotion again,” she fretted. “You have to,” the producer said. “This is for you. spoiler alert! This is for you and Ben.”[/tpl]

===Lawsuit===

In December 2011, the producer of The Bachelor sued Steve Carbone, proprietor of the website RealitySteve.com, for leaking unreleased information about the show, claiming Carbone encouraged contestants of both The Bachelor and The Bachelorette to break their confidentiality agreements. Carbone has denied that the source of the leaks are current contestants.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/bachelor-producers-lawsuit-reality-steve-270839|title='Bachelor' Producers Sue Spoiler Website for Soliciting Info Leaks from Contestants (Exclusive)|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Gardner|first=Eriq|date=December 7, 2011[/tpl]
