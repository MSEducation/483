[[Asptro convention]]

CATEGORIES: Bridge conventions

Asptro is a contract bridge  bidding convention used to intervene over a 1NT  opening bid.[tpl]OEB|7|267[/tpl]  Its methodology and hence its designation is a combination of two similar conventions â€“ Aspro and Astro. 
Partner can bid two of the anchor suit, 2M, expecting to play that contract (sign off). 2[tpl]Diams[/tpl] is a non-forcing enquiry, if available, and 2NT is a forcing enquiry. Other replies are natural. Responder can also pass with 6+ length in the bid minor. (You cannot expect support from partner but it might be the least evil).
After a 2[tpl]Diams[/tpl] reply, the 2[tpl]Clubs[/tpl] intervenor passes with five diamonds or bids the 5 card suit, always the unknown one with 5-5. 
After a 2NT reply, the intervenor routinely bids the unknown suit. Both the anchor and the unknown major imply both majors with preference for the new one. Thus 3[tpl]Hearts[/tpl] and 3[tpl]Spades[/tpl] may be refined, such as by a strength difference with 3[tpl]Spades[/tpl] stronger.
