Alexandrine, Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (born Princess Alexandrine of Prussia; 23 February 1803 â€“ 21 April 1892) was the wife and consort to Paul Frederick, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin as well as the daughter of Frederick William III of Prussia and Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

==Family==

Alexandrine was the seventh child and fourth daughter of Frederick William III of Prussia and his wife Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. She was a younger sister of Frederick William IV of Prussia, Wilhelm I of Prussia, and Charlotte, Empress of Russia.
Her mother was a niece of Queen Charlotte of the United Kingdom and a sister of Queen Frederica of Hanover.

==Marriage==

In 25 May 1822, she married Paul Frederick of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He succeeded his grandfather as Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in 1837. 
They had three children:
Her marriage was generally considered unhappy; Paul Frederick was a military man who had little time or interest in his wife and family. Alexandrine, by contrast, was a devoted mother who tenderly raised her children and actively cultivated their cultural pursuits. Alexandrine herself was very cultured but was also described as a stereotypically-remote German princess. She was not considered an intellectual but attended scholarly lectures and read many books.
