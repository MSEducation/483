Jason Woodrue first appears in The Atom #1 (June–July 1962).  Woodrue is an exile from an interdimensional world (Floria)[tpl]Cite comic | Writer = Veitch, Rick | Artist = Ewins, Brett | Story = The Secret Origin of The Guardians of the Universe | Title = Secret Origins | Issue = 23 | Date = February 1988 | Publisher = DC Comics[/tpl] inhabited by dryads.  Calling himself the Plant Master, Woodrue uses his advanced botanical knowledge to control plant growth in an attempt to take over the world.  He is defeated by the superheroic Atom.  Plant Master returns to face the AtomThe Atom #24 (Apr/May 1966) and the Justice League.Justice League of America (vol. 1) #61 (March 1968)
In Flash (vol. 1) #245 (November 1976), Woodrue uses an experimental formula to transform his body into a plant/human hybrid, with his skin resembling bark and his hair turning into leaves.  Now calling himself the Floronic Man, he is defeated by Green Lantern.  After a rematch with the Atom and Wonder Woman,Super-Team Family #14 the Floronic Man later becomes a member of the Secret Society of Super-Villains.Secret Society of Super-Villains #11 (December 1977)
In Alan Moore's relaunch of the Swamp Thing in Saga of the Swamp Thing #21 (February 1984), Woodrue is hired by General Averly Sunderland to discover how scientist Alec Holland had been turned into the Swamp Thing.  Woodrue discovers that the creature, instead of being a mutated version of Holland, is rather an intelligent mass of plant life that had fed on Holland's dead body and absorbed his knowledge and memories. The Floronic Man tries to warn Sunderland that the Swamp Thing is not dead, but the General refuses to listen and announces his intent to terminate Woodrue's employment. Subsequently, the Floronic Man traps Sunderland in his office with a thawed and enraged Swamp Thing, who kills the General.
In Saga of the Swamp Thing #22 (March 1984), the Floronic Man uses the Swamp Thing's body—now regressing to a plant-like state out of his inability to accept the new revelation about his origins, Woodrue literally eating parts of him—to contact the Green, which is composed of the life force of all plants on Earth.  The experience drives the Floronic Man insane, and he sets out to destroy all nonplant life on Earth by forcing the plants to produce an excess amount of oxygen to force humanity into extinction, in the belief that he is 'saving' Earth from mankind. Woodrue is confronted by a revived Swamp Thing, who reveals to the Green that plants cannot survive without animals as he is depriving them of the carbon dioxide they require to breathe, forcing Woodrue to acknowledge that his actions are the actions of a man rather than a plant. The Green abandons the Floronic Man, who is then taken into custody by the Justice League after undergoing a complete mental breakdown.Saga of the Swamp Thing #24 (May 1984)
The 1988 Neil Gaiman/Dave McKean miniseries Black Orchid recasts Dr. Jason Woodrue as a University professor who taught botany to Philip Sylvian, Alec & Linda Holland, and Pamela Isley.  The character Philip Sylvian, apparently unaware of Woodrue's transformation, refers to him as a "poor old guy" and states: "Last I heard he was in Arkham Insane Asylum..."
The Floronic Man was briefly a hero, after the events of Millennium led to him to become a member of the New Guardians. In this new role, Woodrue takes on the name Floro. After the death of most of his teammates, he reverts to his original status as a villain.
Floro returns in Batman: Shadow of the Bat #56 (November 1996).  After breaking Poison Ivy out of Arkham with his two underlings Holly and Eva, Floro explains his past to Batman and Poison Ivy, telling the story of how he prevented a plot of Swamp Thing's, only to get decapitated. After scientists manage to keep his head alive, the first thing he comes in contact with is marijuana.  Regenerating a plant body, he begins his quest to flood the streets of Gotham City with his advanced and cheap pot.  Floronic Man takes some of Poison Ivy's DNA in an attempt to create a "child".  Poison Ivy, in exchange, gets a trunk full of dope money, and is free to walk away.  Deciding she does not want Floronic Man running the world, she frees the Batman.  After a short battle, Batman notices that Floro is standing in a puddle, and uses an electrical cable to electrocute the villain, then decapitates him once again.
The character has since appeared in various other comics and storylines.  He assists Starman, Alan Scott, Batman and others in trying to save a friendly, peaceful version of Solomon Grundy.Starman (vol. 2) #33–35 (August–October 1997)  In a recent issue of Batman, he is killed after assassins shoot him repeatedly with bullets, although this is in direct contrast to his most famous appearance (in The Saga of the Swamp Thing #21) in which he points out that "you can't kill a vegetable by shooting it through the head."  He is one of the many villains who was mind-wiped by the JLA, but has since recovered those memories.JLA #115–119 (August–November 2005)
