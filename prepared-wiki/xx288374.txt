The Uruguayan Championship 1923 of AUF was the 23rd season of Uruguay's top-flight football league.

==Overview==

The tournament consisted of a two-wheel championship of all against all. It involved twelve teams, and the champion was Nacional.
This year was the first Uruguayan football championship fractured, due to the schism that triggered the emergence of a parallel Uruguayan Football Federation championship organizing their own. However, the league recognized by FIFA and CONMEBOL remained the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF), which achieved the same year for the fourth time to get South American Championship selections with your representative, classifying the Paris Olympic Games next year.
Disenrollment of AUF clubs Peñarol and Central last year, produced the first appearance in first division clubs Bella Vista and Fénix. In turn, Montevideo Wanderers, Charley and Lito participated in both tournaments with two different teams. For Lito, Lito were dubbed "round" to the AUF and Lito "square" to the FUF, differing by the shield they carried in a Barca shirt. For Wanderers, used his official name in AUF, registering with an alternate team under the name of "Athletic Wanderers" in FUF.
