The 2004 Summer Olympic Games, officially known as the Games of the XXVIII Olympiad, was a premier international multi-sport event held in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004 with the motto Welcome Home. 10,625 athletes competed,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/athens-2004-summer-olympics|title=Athens 2004 |accessdate=19 January 2008 |work=International Olympic Committee |publisher=olympic.org[/tpl] some 600 more than expected, accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries. There were 301 medal events in 28 different sports. Athens 2004 marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance. It was also the first time since 1896 (other than the since-downgraded 1906 Intercalated Games) that the Olympics were held in Greece.
A new medal obverse was introduced at these Games, replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since the 1928 Games.  This rectified the long lasting mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue.Winner Medals, Olympic Games Museum. Retrieved 27 July 2011.

The 2004 summer games were hailed as "unforgettable, dream games" by IOC president Jacques Rogge, and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure, including a new airport, ring road, and subway system.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/summer04/gen/news/story?id=1870458 |title=Rogge: Athens 'unforgettable, dream Games' |author=Associated Press |date=29 August 2004 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=28 July 2012[/tpl]

==Host city selection==

Athens was chosen as the host city during the 106th IOC Session held in Lausanne on 5 September 1997.  Athens had lost its bid to organize the 1996 Summer Olympics to Atlanta nearly seven years before on 18 September 1990, during the 96th IOC Session in Tokyo. Under the direction of Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, Athens pursued another bid, this time for the right to host the Summer Olympics in 2004. The success of Athens in securing the 2004 Games was based largely on Athens' appeal to Olympic history and the emphasis that it placed on the pivotal role that Greece and Athens could play in promoting Olympism and the Olympic Movement. Furthermore; unlike their bid for the 1996 Games which was largely criticized for its overall disorganization and arrogance – wherein the bid lacked specifics and relied largely upon sentiment and the notion that it was Athens' right to organize the Centennial Games;[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/19/sports/atlanta-selected-over-athens-for-1996-olympics.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2&pagewanted=print|title=Atlanta Selected Over Athens for 1996 Olympics|last=Weisman|first=Steven R.|date=19 September 1990|work=The New York Times|accessdate=23 September 2008[/tpl] the bid for the 2004 Games was lauded for its humility and earnestness, its focused message, and its detailed bid concept.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/athens-wins-2004-olympics-1237761.html|title=Athens wins 2004 Olympics|date=6 September 1997|first=Mike|last=Rowbottom|work=The Independent |location=London | accessdate=25 May 2010 [/tpl] The 2004 bid addressed concerns and criticisms raised in its unsuccessful 1996 bid – primarily Athens' infrastructural readiness, its air pollution, its budget, and politicization of Games preparations.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/06/sports/athens-wins-a-vote-for-tradition-and-the-2004-olympics.html?pagewanted=print|title=Athens Wins a Vote for Tradition, and the 2004 Olympics|date=6 September 1997|first=Jere|last=Longman|newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=25 May 2010 [/tpl] Athens' successful organization of the 1997 World Championships in Athletics the month before the host city election was also crucial in allaying lingering fears and concerns among the sporting community and some IOC members about its ability to host international sporting events.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/03/sports/athens-pins-olympic-bid-to-world-meet.html?pagewanted=print|title=Athens Pins Olympic Bid to World Meet|last=Longman|first=Jere|date=3 August 1997|work=The New York Times|accessdate=23 September 2008[/tpl] Another factor which also contributed to Athens' selection was a growing sentiment among some IOC members to restore the values of the Olympics to the Games, a component which they felt was lost during the heavily criticized over-commercialization of Atlanta 1996 Games.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/07/sports/athens-can-thank-atlanta-for-2004-games.html|title=Athens Can Thank Atlanta for 2004 Games|date=7 September 1997|first=Dave|last=Anderson|newspaper=New York Times| accessdate=25 May 2010 [/tpl] Subsequently, the selection of Athens was also motivated by a lingering sense of disappointment among IOC members regarding the numerous organizational and logistical setbacks experienced during the 1996 Games.
After leading all voting rounds, Athens easily defeated Rome in the 5th and final vote. Cape Town, Stockholm, and Buenos Aires, the three other cities that made the IOC shortlist, were eliminated in prior rounds of voting. Six other cities submitted applications, but their bids were dropped by the IOC in 1996. These cities were Istanbul, Lille, Rio de Janeiro, San Juan, Seville, and Saint Petersburg.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/athens/election_uk.asp |title=International Olympic Committee – Athens 2004 – Election |publisher=Olympic.org |accessdate=15 March 2010[/tpl]

==Development and preparation==

===Costs===

In June 2004, the BBC reported that the costs of hosting Olympic Games were close to € 10 billion.Olympics 'may cost Greece dear' bbc.co.uk, Wednesday, 2 June 2004, 16:57 GMT 17:57 UK On 13 November 2004, the Greek embassy estimated the costs of hosting the Olympics at €8.954 billion (about $21.2 billion in 2004) not including construction made regardless of the Games, but including 1.08 billion Euros ($1.35 billion) in security costs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greekembassy.org/Embassy/content/en/Article.aspx?office=3&folder=200&article=14269|title=Cost of Athens 2004 Olympics|work=Embassy of Greece|date=13 November 2004| accessdate=25 May 2010 [/tpl] NBC Universal paid the IOC $793 million (adjusted by inflation: $[tpl]Inflation|US|793000000|2004[/tpl]) for U.S. broadcast rights,[tpl]cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/08/30/news/fortune500/nbc_olympics/|title=NBC Universal rings in Athens profits|first=Krysten|last=Crawford|work=CNNMoney.com|date=30 August 2004| accessdate=25 May 2010 [/tpl]  the most paid by any country.  NBC broadcast over 1200 hours of coverage during the games, triple what was broadcast in the U.S. four years earlier. Between all the NBC Universal networks (NBC, CNBC, MSNBC, Bravo, USA Network & Telemundo) the games were on television 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Concerns about terrorism elevated following the 11 September 2001 attacks.  Greece increased the budget for security at the Olympics to €970 million (US$1.2 billion). Approximately 70,000 police officers patrolled Athens and the Olympic venues during the Olympics. NATO and the European Union also provided minor
support, after Athens asked for co-operation.
When the International Olympic Committee expressed its concern over the progress of construction work of the new Olympic venues, a new Organizing Committee was formed in 2000 under President Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki. In the years leading up to the Games, Athens was transformed into a city that used state-of-the-art technology in transportation and urban development. Some of the most modern sporting venues in the world at the time were built to host the 2004 Olympic Games.

===Construction===

By late March 2004, some Olympic projects were still behind schedule, and Greek authorities announced that a roof it had initially proposed as an optional, non-vital addition to the Aquatics Center would no longer be built. The main Olympic Stadium, the designated facility for the opening and closing ceremonies, was completed only two months before the games opened.  This stadium was completed with a retractable glass roof designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. The same architect also designed the Velodrome and other facilities.
Infrastructure, such as the tram line linking venues in southern Athens with the city proper, and numerous venues were considerably behind schedule just two months before the games. The subsequent pace of preparation, however, made the rush to finish the Athens venues one of the tightest in Olympics history. The Greeks, unperturbed, maintained that they would make it all along. By July/August 2004, all venues were delivered: in August, the Olympic Stadium was officially completed and opened, joined or preceded by the official completion and openings of other venues within the Athens Olympic Sports Complex (OAKA), and the sports complexes in Faliro and Helliniko.
Late July and early August witnessed the Athens Tram become operational, and this system provided additional connections to those already existing between Athens and its waterfront communities along the Saronic Gulf.  These communities included the port city of Piraeus, Agios Kosmas (site of the sailing venue), Helliniko (the site of the old international airport which now contained the fencing venue, the canoe/kayak slalom course, the 15,000-seat Helliniko Olympic Basketball Arena, and the softball and baseball stadia), and the Faliro Coastal Zone Olympic Complex (site of the taekwondo, handball, indoor volleyball, and beach volleyball venues, as well as the newly reconstructed Karaiskaki Stadium for football). The upgrades to the Athens Ring Road were also delivered just in time, as were the expressway upgrades connecting Athens proper with peripheral areas such as Markopoulo (site of the shooting and equestrian venues), the newly constructed Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport, Schinias (site of the rowing venue), Maroussi (site of the OAKA), Parnitha (site of the Olympic Village), Galatsi (site of the rhythmic gymnastics and table tennis venue), and Vouliagmeni (site of the triathlon venue). The upgrades to the Athens Metro were also completed, and the new lines became operational by mid-summer.
EMI released Unity, the official pop album of the Athens Olympics, in the leadup to the Olympics. It features contributions from Sting, Lenny Kravitz, Moby, Destiny's Child, and Avril Lavigne. EMI has pledged to donate US$180,000 from the album to UNICEF's HIV/AIDS program in Sub-Saharan Africa.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.star-ecentral.com/music/sleeve/notes.asp?file=archives/sleeve/2004/5/26/26UnityOlymp&date=5/26/2004/2 |title=Unity Olympics Album |work=The Star Online eCentral |year=2004 |accessdate=16 August 2008[/tpl]
At least 14 people died during the work on the facilities. Most of these people were not from Greece.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3920919.stm |title=Workers in peril at Athens sites |work=BBC News |date=23 July 2004 |accessdate=16 August 2008[/tpl]
Before the games, Greek hotel staff staged a series of one-day strikes over wage disputes. They had been asking for a significant raise for the period covering the event being staged. Paramedics and ambulance drivers also protested.  They claimed to have the right to the same Olympic bonuses promised to their security force counterparts.

==Torch relay==

The lighting ceremony of the Olympic flame took place on 25 March in Ancient Olympia. For the first time ever, the flame travelled around the world in a relay to former, next, and later Olympic cities and other large cities, before returning to Greece.

==Mascots==

Mascots have been a tradition at the Olympic Games since the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France.  The Athens games had two official mascots: Athiná and Phévos (pronounced in Greek, Athina and Fivos).  The sister and brother were named after Athena, the goddess of wisdom, strategy and war, and Phoebus, the god of light and music, respectively. They were inspired by the ancient daidala, which were dolls that had religious connotations as well as being toys.

==Online coverage==

For the first time, major broadcasters were allowed to serve video coverage of the Olympics over the Internet, provided that they restricted this service geographically, to protect broadcasting contracts in other areas. For instance, the BBC made their complete live coverage available to UK high-speed Internet customers for free; customers in the U.S. were only able to receive delayed excerpts.[tpl]cite news |last=Pfanner |first=Eric |title=Athens Games beating Sydney in TV race |work=International Herald Tribune |date=30 August 2004 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/08/30/tv30_ed3_.php |accessdate=18 August 2006[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The International Olympic Committee forbade Olympic athletes, as well as coaches, support personnel and other officials, from setting up specialized weblogs and/or other websites for covering their personal perspective of the games. They were not allowed to post audio, video, or photos that they had taken. An exception was made if an athlete already has a personal website that was not set up specifically for the Games.[tpl]cite news |title=You're Athletes, Not Journalists |publisher=Wired News |date=20 August 2004 |url=http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64650,00.html |accessdate=18 August 2006| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5Ppo9LSLA | archivedate = 24 June 2007| deadurl=no[/tpl] NBC launched its own Olympic website, NBCOlympics.com. Focusing on the television coverage of the games, it did provide video clips, medal standings, live results. Its main purpose, however, was to provide a schedule of what sports were on the many stations of NBC Universal. The games were on TV 24 hours a day on one network or another.

==Technology==

As with any enterprise, the Organizing Committee and everyone involved with it relied heavily on technology in order to deliver a successful event. ATHOC maintained two separate data networks, one for the preparation of the Games (known as the Administrative network) and one for the Games themselves (Games Network). The technical infrastructure involved more than 11,000 computers, over 600 servers, 2,000 printers, 23,000 fixed-line telephone devices, 9,000 mobile phones, 12,000 TETRA devices, 16,000 TV and video devices and 17 Video Walls interconnected by more than 6,000 kilometers of cabling (both optical fiber and twisted pair).
This infrastructure was created and maintained to serve directly more than 150,000 ATHOC Staff, Volunteers, Olympic family members (IOC, NOCs, Federations), Partners & Sponsors and Media. It also kept the information flowing for all spectators, TV viewers, Website visitors and news readers around the world, prior and during the Games. The Media Center was located inside the Zappeion which is a Greek national exhibition center.
Between June and August 2004, the technology staff worked in the Technology Operations Center (TOC) from where it could centrally monitor and manage all the devices and flow of information, as well as handle any problems that occurred during the Games. The TOC was organized in teams (e.g. Systems, Telecommunications, Information Security, Data Network, Staffing, etc.) under a TOC Director and corresponding team leaders (Shift Managers). The TOC operated on a 24x7 basis with personnel organized into 12-hour shifts.

==The Games==

===Opening Ceremony===

The widely praised Opening Ceremony Directed by avant garde choreographer Dimitris Papaioannou and Produced by Jack Morton Worldwide led by Project Director David Zolkwer was held on 13 August 2004. It began with a twenty eight (the number of the Olympiads up to then) second countdown paced by the sounds of an amplified heartbeat.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/29/sports/olympics/29closing.html?ex=1148788800&en=1c65a34c3766781c&ei=5070&pagewanted=print|title=Master of Olympic Pageantry Prepares One Final Blowout|date=29 August 2004|newspaper=New York Times|agency=Associated Press| accessdate=25 May 2010 [/tpl] As the countdown was completed, fireworks rumbled and illuminated the skies overhead. After a drum corps and bouzouki players joined in an opening march, the video screen showed images of flight, crossing southwest from Athens over the Greek countryside to ancient Olympia. Then, a single drummer in the ancient stadium joined in a drum duet with a single drummer in the main stadium in Athens, joining the original ancient Olympic games with the modern ones in symbolism. At the end of the drum duet, a single flaming arrow was launched from the video screen (symbolically from ancient Olympia) and into the reflecting pool, which resulted in fire erupting in the middle of the stadium creating a burning image of the Olympic rings rising from the pool. The Opening Ceremony was a pageant of traditional Greek culture and history hearkening back to its mythological beginnings. The program began as a young Greek boy sailed into the stadium on a 'paper-ship' waving the host nation's flag to aethereal music by Hadjidakis and then a centaur appeared, followed by a gigantic head of a cycladic figurine which eventually broke into many pieces symbolising the Greek islands. Underneath the cycladic head was a Hellenistic representation of the human body, reflecting the concept and belief in perfection reflected in Greek art. A man was seen balancing on a hovering cube symbolising man's eternal 'split' between passion and reason followed by a couple of young lovers playfully chasing each other while the god Eros was hovering above them. There followed a very colourful float parade chronicling Greek history from the ancient Minoan civilization to modern times.
Although NBC in the United States presented the entire opening ceremony from start to finish, a topless Minoan priestess was shown only briefly, the breasts having been pixelated digitally in order to avoid controversy (as the "Nipplegate" incident was still fresh in viewer's minds at the time) and potential fines by the Federal Communications Commission. Also, lower frontal nudity of men dressed as ancient Greek statues was shown in such a way that the area below the waist was cut off by the bottom of the screen. In most other countries presenting the broadcast, there was no censorship of the ceremony.
Following the artistic performances, a parade of nations entered the stadium with over 10,500 athletes walking under the banners of 201 nations. The nations were arranged according to Greek alphabet making Finland, Fiji, Chile, and Hong Kong the last four to enter the stadium before the Greek delegation. On this occasion, in observance of the tradition that the delegation of Greece opens the parade and the host nation closes it, the Greek flag bearer opened the parade and all the Greek delegation closed it. Based on audience reaction, the emotional high point of the parade was the entrance of the delegation from Afghanistan which had been absent from the Olympics and had female competitors for the first time. The Iraqi delegation also stirred emotions. Also recognized was the symbolic unified march of athletes from North Korea and South Korea under the Korean Unification Flag. The country of Kiribati made a debut at these games and East Timor made a debut under its own flag. After the Parade of Nations, during which the Dutch DJ Tiësto provided the music, the Icelandic singer Björk performed the song Oceania, written specially for the event by her and the poet Sjón.
The Opening Ceremony culminated in the lighting of the Olympic Cauldron by 1996 Gold Medalist Windsurfer Nikolaos Kaklamanakis. Many key moments in the ceremony, including the lighting of the Olympic Cauldron, featured music composed and arranged by John Psathas[tpl]cite web|title=SOUNZ  – NZ composer – John Psathas |url=http://sounz.org.nz/contributor/composer/1017|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ix23KRGb|archivedate=11 August 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=7 August 2009[/tpl] from New Zealand. The gigantic cauldron, which was styled after the Athens 2004 Olympic Torch, pivoted down to be lit by the 35 year-old, before slowly swinging up and lifting the flame high above the stadium. Following this, the stadium found itself at the centre of a rousing fireworks spectacular.

===Participating National Olympic Committees===

All National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in the Athens Games, as was the case in 1996. Two new NOCs had been created since 1996 and made their debut at these Games (Kiribati and Timor-Leste).  Therefore with the re-appearance of Afghanistan (missing the 2000 Summer Olympics) the number of participating nations increased from 199 to 202. Also since 2000, Yugoslavia had changed its name to Serbia and Montenegro and its code from YUG to SCG. The number in parentheses indicates the number of participants each NOC contributed.

===Sports===

The sports featured at the 2004 Summer Olympics are listed below. Officially there were 301 events in 28 sports as swimming, diving, synchronised swimming and water polo are classified by the IOC as disciplines within the sport of aquatics, and wheelchair racing was a demonstration sport. For the first time, the wrestling category featured women's wrestling and in the fencing competition women competed in the sabre. American Kristin Heaston, who led off the qualifying round of women's shotput became the first woman to compete at the ancient site of Olympia but Cuban Yumileidi Cumba became the first woman to win a gold medal there.
The demonstration sport of wheelchair racing was a joint Olympic/Paralympic event, allowing a Paralympic event to occur within the Olympics, and for the future, opening up the wheelchair race to the able-bodied. The 2004 Summer Paralympics were also held in Athens, from 17 to 28 September.

===Highlights===

===Closing Ceremony===

The Games were concluded on 29 August 2004. The closing ceremony was held at the Athens Olympic Stadium, where the Games had been opened 16 days earlier. Around 70,000 people gathered in the stadium to watch the ceremony.
The initial part of the ceremony interspersed the performances of various Greek singers, and featured traditional Greek dance performances from various regions of Greece (Crete, Pontos, Thessaly, etc.). The event was meant to highlight the pride of the Greeks in their culture and country for the world to see.
A significant part of the closing ceremony was the exchange of the Olympic flag of the Antwerp games between the mayor of Athens and the mayor of Beijing, host city of the next Olympic games. After the flag exchange a presentation from the Beijing delegation presented a glimpse into Chinese culture for the world to see. Beijing University students (who were at first incorrectly cited as the Twelve Girls Band) sang Mo Li Hua (Jasmine Flower) and the medal ceremony for the last event of the Olympics, the men's marathon, was conducted, with Stefano Baldini from Italy as the winner. The bronze medal winner, Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima of Brazil, was simultaneously announced as a recipient of the Pierre de Coubertin medal for his bravery in finishing the race despite being attacked by a rogue spectator while leading with 7 km to go.
A flag-bearer from each nation's delegation then entered along the stage, followed by the competitors en masse on the floor.
Short speeches were presented by Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, President of the Organising Committee, and by President Dr. Jacques Rogge of the IOC, in which he described the Athens Olympics as "unforgettable, dream Games".
Dr. Rogge had previously declared he would be breaking with tradition in his closing speech as President of the IOC and that he would never use the words of his predecessor Juan Antonio Samaranch, who used to always say 'these were the best ever games'. Dr. Rogge had described Salt Lake City 2002 as "superb games" and in turn would continue after Athens 2004 and describe Turin 2006 as "truly magnificent games."
The national anthems of Greece and China were played in a handover ceremony as both nations' flags were raised. The Mayor of Athens, Dora Bakoyianni, passed the Olympic Flag to the Mayor of Beijing, Wang Qishan. After a short cultural performance by Chinese actors, dancers, and musicians directed by eminent Chinese director Zhang Yimou, Rogge declared the 2004 Olympic Games closed. The Olympic flag was next raised again on 10 February 2006 during the opening ceremony of next Winter Olympic games in Torino.
A young Greek girl, Fotini Papaleonidopoulou, lit a symbolic lantern with the Olympic Flame and passed it on to other children before "extinguishing" the flame in the cauldron by blowing a puff of air. The ceremony ended with a variety of musical performances by Greek singers, including Dionysis Savvopoulos, George Dalaras, Haris Alexiou, Anna Vissi, Sakis Rouvas, Eleftheria Arvanitaki, Alkistis Protopsalti, Antonis Remos, Mixalis Xatzigiannis, Marinella and Dimitra Galani, as thousands of athletes carried out symbolic displays on the stadium floor.

==Legacy==

To commemorate the games, a series of Greek high value euro collectors' coins were minted by the Mint of Greece, in both silver and gold.  The pieces depict landmarks in Greece as well as ancient and modern sports on the obverse of the coin.  On the reverse, a common motif with the logo of the games, circled by an olive branch representing the spirit of the games.
Preparations to stage the Olympics led to a number of positive developments for the city's infrastructure.  These improvements included the establishment of Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport, a modern new international airport serving as Greece's main aviation gateway;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aia.gr/pages.asp?pageid=5&langid=2 |title=The Company |publisher=Aia.gr |date=28 March 2001 |accessdate=15 March 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100218151043/http://www.aia.gr/pages.asp?pageid=5&langid=2| archivedate= 18 February 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] expansions to the Athens Metro[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ametro.gr/page/default.asp?la=1&id=376 |title=AttikoMetro Inside |publisher=Ametro.gr |date=9 September 2009 |accessdate=15 March 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100211142041/http://www.ametro.gr/page/default.asp?la=1&id=376| archivedate= 11 February 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] system; the "Tram", a new metropolitan tram (light rail) system[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tramsa.gr/ |title=Tram Sa |publisher=Tramsa.gr |date=22 February 2010 |accessdate=15 March 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100323163748/http://www.tramsa.gr/| archivedate= 23 March 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl] system; the "Proastiakos", a new suburban railway system linking the airport and suburban towns to the city of Athens; the "Attiki Odos", a new toll motorway encircling the city,http://www.aodos.gr/article.asp?catid=12069&tag=7275  [tpl]Wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.aodos.gr/article.asp?catid=12069&tag=7275|date =20090111094933[/tpl] and the conversion of streets into pedestrianized walkways in the historic center of Athens which link several of the city's main tourist sites, including the Parthenon and the Panathinaiko Stadium (the site of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.minenv.gr/4/44/4401/440102/44010202/e4401020202.html |title=Unification of Archaeological Sites in the Centre of Athens |publisher=Minenv.gr |date=4 November 1995 |accessdate=15 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0721/p04s01-wogn.html |title=As Olympic Glow Fades, Athens Questions $15 Billion Cost |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date=21 July 2008 |accessdate=15 March 2010[/tpl]  All of the above infrastructure is still in use to this day, and there have been continued expansions and proposals to expand Athens' metro, tram, suburban rail and motorway network, the airport, as well as further plans to pedestrianize more thoroughfares in the historic center of Athens.
The Greek Government has created a corporation, Olympic Properties SA, which is overseeing the post-Olympics management, development and conversion of these facilities, some of which will be sold off (or have already been sold off) to the private sector,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.olympicproperties.gr/contents_en.asp?id=2 |title=Hellenic Olympic Properties: The Company |publisher=Olympicproperties.gr |accessdate=15 March 2010|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20081212232941/http://www.olympicproperties.gr/contents_en.asp?id=2 |archivedate = 12 December 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/features/after-the-party-what-happens-when-the-olympics-leave-town-901629.html |title=After The Party: What happens when the Olympics leave town |work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=15 March 2010  | date=19 August 2008[/tpl] while some other facilities are still in use, or have been converted for commercial use or modified for other sports.[tpl]cite web|author=(AFP) – 30 July 2008 |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAognIFQaNRhGk_sG9fHJQHVXuHw |title=Four years after Athens Greeks have Olympics blues |publisher=Google |date=30 July 2008 |accessdate=15 March 2010[/tpl]

On 6 December 2012, the IOC stripped medals from four athletes caught doping at the 2004 Athens Olympics including one gold medalist and postponed a decision to revoke Lance Armstrong's bronze from the 2000 Sydney Games. The IOC also disqualified four athletes whose Athens doping samples were retested earlier in the year and came back positive, including shot put gold medalist Yuriy Bilonog of Ukraine.
