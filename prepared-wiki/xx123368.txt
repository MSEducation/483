He used to be an employee at McDonald's in the early 1990s, which was where his co-workers kept telling him that he resembled pop singer Michael Jackson; so Moss entered a company talent contest and won, and then as time went by, he decided to be Jackson for a living.

==Early life==

Moss was born and raised in Los Angeles, California on July 11, 1977. He went to school in Florida with Nick Carter.

==Career==

In the early 1990s, while working at McDonald's, Moss practiced his act in his spare time after being repeatedly told by his co-workers how much he resembled Michael Jackson. In 1994, he won a company talent contest, after which he took up impersonating Jackson as a profession.
He has stated that it only takes him 30â€“45 minutes to transform himself into Michael Jackson. His impersonation skills have led to work in many countries, including the Philippines, Bahrain, New Zealand, and Japan. Moss is also the only known Jackson impersonator to have had no plastic surgery to augment his appearance to more resemble the singer. When hired to perform at a venue in Asia, Moss' manager had to have staff act as bodyguards for him as the audience attending had reached mob levels.
In 1996, Moss met the real Michael Jackson while performing as MJ in Hollywood, California. Jackson's response to Moss was "You look really good." The real Michael Jackson had hired Moss to stand in for him on a number of occasions. Moss has impersonated Jackson in a number of movies, including the third and fourth Scary Movie films and Date Movie. Moss also appeared as Michael Jackson on E! Entertainment, Sky News, and Sky1's reenactment of the Michael Jackson Trial.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4317639.stm|title=Jackson's double courts attention |accessdate=2008-09-11 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date=2005-03-07 |work= |publisher=bbc.co.uk[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=306050|title=E!'s faux court is spare |accessdate=2008-09-10 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|publisher=[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Moss performed as Jackson at Horizons Casino Hotel in Lake Tahoe for 4 years, which proved to be the longest running casino show in that city.
In July 2009, he traveled around the world in his Tribute to Michael Jackson show.
Many of Jackson's fans accuse Moss of making fun of the singer and persistently criticized him and his performances due to this belief. Moss denies suggestions that he exploits Jackson in a negative manner.
