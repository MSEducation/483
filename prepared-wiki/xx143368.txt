[[Convenient care clinic]]

CATEGORIES: Types of healthcare facilities

Convenient care clinics (CCCs) are a category of walk-in clinic located in retail stores, supermarkets and pharmacies that treat uncomplicated minor illnesses and provide preventative health care services. They are sometimes called "retail clinics," "retail-based clinics," "walk-in medical clinics," or "nurse-in-a-box." CCCs are usually staffed by nurse practitioners (NPs) or  physician assistants (PAs).  Some CCCs, however, are staffed by physicians.

==Overview==

Currently, there are over 1,450 CCCs located throughout the United States.The ConvUrgentCare Report: U.S. Walk-in Clinic Market Report, Volume 6, No. 7. Merchant Medicine, LLC. July 1, 2013.  Most CCCs are open seven days a week – twelve hours a day during the workweek and eight hours a day on the weekend.Convenient Care Association, “CCC Factsheet.”  Because CCCs are such a new development, only a small percentage of Americans have received health care in a CCC setting.California Health Care Foundation, “Health Care in the Express Lane: The Emergence of Retail Clinics." http://www.chcf.org/topics/view.cfm?itemid=123218  It is estimated, however, that the number of CCCs will increase dramatically in the near future.Kaiser Family Foundation, Daily Report, August 24, 2006
 
The 2008 Survey of Health Care Consumers,2008 Survey of Health Care Consumers, Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, February 2008. http://www.deloitte.com/dtt/article/0%2C1002%2Ccid%25253D192463%2C00.html?wt.mc_id=wi from the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, finds the appetite for retail medical clinics is real, and growing, and the potential for future success substantial. The following statistics demonstrate the increase in consumer interest in retail clinics.
 
The survey says that these clinics are particularly popular among those who are identified as:
A major driver of the walk-in clinic growth trend is the focus on cost.  As more patients with higher deductibles seek out care options, the reduced cost of retail settings is a viable option for routine care.  For example, according to one analysis, the typical cost of diagnosing an earache was $59 at a retail or walk-in provider, $95 in doctor's office, $135 at urgent care, $184 in an emergency room.HealthHarbor Retail Clinic Overview http://www.healthharbor.com/SavingRetailHealthCost

==Services provided==

Most CCCs treat adults and children over the age of 18 months.  CCCs treat common family illnesses, such as:
Some CCCs provide physical therapy with a specialist.
CCCs also provide preventative care, including health screenings, vaccinations, and physical exams. They may serve as sample collection points for blood, urine and feces for laboratory tests, which are then sent to external labs.
By definition, CCCs offer a more narrow range of services (usually limited to 25 - 30 of the most common diagnoses) than are offered in traditional primary care offices.W. Crounse, Microsoft and Health, "Healthcare goes retail," June 28, 2006.http://www.microsoft.com/industry/healthcare/providers/businessvalue/housecalls/retailhealthcare.mspx This limited scope of services is seen in both nurse practitioner and physician-staffed CCCs, and is an integral part of the CCC model.QuickHealth, "QuickHealth FAQ."

==Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants in Convenient Care Clinics==

CCCs are usually staffed by Nurse Practitioners (NPs) or other advanced practice nurses.Convenient Care Association, “Home Page.” Some CCCs are staffed by Physician Assistants (PAs).Convenient Care Association, “About Physician Assistants.”
Nurse Practitioners are registered nurses with advanced education and training who provide a broad scope of health care services. NPs engage in health promotion, patient evaluation, treatment, diagnosis, education, counseling, case management and coordination of care.  One study found that patients of advanced practice nurses had similar outcomes to patients of primary care physicians.Mundinger, M., “Primary Care Outcomes in Patients Treated by Nurse Practitioners or Physicians,” JAMA, January 2000.
Physician Assistants are health care professionals licensed to practice medicine under physician supervision.American Academy of Physician Assistants, “What is a PA?”  With appropriate training and supervision, PAs can provide health care that is similar in quality to that of a primary care physician.E. Sekscenski, et al., “State practice environments and the supply of physician assistants, nurse practitioners and certified nurse-midwives,” New England Journal of Medicine, 1994.
