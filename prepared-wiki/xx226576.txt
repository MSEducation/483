</ref> Orford [[Try#Conversion|converted]] the try so Manly had a 6 nil lead. Seven minutes later the Sea Eagles were again down in the Rhinos' half when Orford put a short ball onto the chest of a flying Anthony Watmough from 30 metres out to race through the defence and score (video replays suggested that Orford's pass to Watmough might have gone forward, but it was ruled ok by referee Jason Robinson). Orford's conversion pushed the Australian club's lead out to 12 nil. Manly could have put the game beyond doubt seven minutes before half-time when Watmough charged onto a pass and broke through flimsy defence before popping a soft pass to a flying Brett Stewart who somehow managed to drop the ball with a try under the posts seemingly seconds away. In the 37th minute Leeds were just into Manly's half when they kicked ahead, regathered and got the ball to [[Danny McGuire]] who made it over the line but had the ball stripped from his grasp by Matt Orford in a one-on-one tackle before he could ground it. [[Jamie Jones-Buchanan]] was there to press the ball to the turf however, so the [[try]] was given by the video referee. [[Kevin Sinfield]] missed the relatively easy conversion, so Leeds were down 4-12. The score did not change during the remaining few minutes of the half.
Leeds started the 2nd half making a small break down the left hand side in the first minute after Manly hooker Heath L'Estrange had given away a penalty. In the resulting play, McGuire got the ball to Hall who passed inside to Keith Senior who had the ball stripped on-on-one by Jamie Lyon. The 2nd minute of play saw Manly make a break from the half way line with Adam Cuthbertson getting the ball out to Michael Robertson left wing. Leeds winger (and former Manly player from 2003-05) Scott Donald attempted to tackle Robertson but he managed to get a pass away. Leeds centre Carl Ablett failed to gather the loose ball and managed to knock the ball straight into the waiting hands of Brett Stewart. The Manly fullback picked the ball up 12m out from the line and with no one to beat scored his second try.[ref]
