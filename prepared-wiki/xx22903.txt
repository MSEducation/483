[[Ideal gas law]]

CATEGORIES: Gas laws, Ideal gas, Equations of state

The ideal gas law is the equation of state of a hypothetical ideal gas. It is a good approximation to the behaviour of many gases under many conditions, although it has several limitations. It was first stated by Émile Clapeyron in 1834 as a combination of Boyle's law and Charles' law.[ref]

 [tpl]Fr icon[/tpl] Facsimile at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (pp. 153–90).[/ref] The ideal gas law is often introduced in its common form:
where P is the absolute pressure of the gas, V is the volume of the gas, n is the amount of substance of gas (measured in moles), R is the ideal, or universal, gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature of the gas.
It can also be derived microscopically from kinetic theory, as was achieved (apparently independently) by August Krönig in 1856[ref]
