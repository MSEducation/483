"Tennis Court" is a song by New Zealand recording artist Lorde, taken from her debut album Pure Heroine (2013). On 7 June 2013, the song was released as the album's second single by Universal Music Group, following "Royals". Tennis Court EP was also released, comprising three additional tracks. "Tennis Court" served as the fourth single from Pure Heroine in the United States.
Written by Lorde and Joel Little and produced by Little, "Tennis Court" features synthesisers and electronic pulses in its composition. The lyrics address Lorde's new-found fame and criticise the "high life."
"Tennis Court" was well received by critics, who complimented the song's production and musical style. The single garnered success in Oceania, peaking at number one on the New Zealand singles chart and entering the top thirty chart in Australia. In Europe, it charted in Belgium (in both Flanders and Wallonia), France, the UK and Germany; the song also appeared on multiple US charts. "Tennis Court" was certified platinum by both the Australian Recording Industry Association and Recorded Music NZ. A music video for the song was directed by Joel Kefali and features Lorde staring into the camera during one continuous shot. To promote Pure Heroine and the song, Lorde performed "Tennis Court" several times, including on Live on Letterman.

==Writing and release==

Lorde was spotted by Universal Music Group (UMG) after performing at her school. She signed with UMG at age 13, and was later paired up with Joel Little, a singer, songwriter and producer.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/culture/performance/8654143/Lorde-NZs-newest-pop-star |title=Lorde: NZ's newest pop star |first=Tom |last=Cardy |work=The Dominion Post |date=10 May 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/culture/performance/8654143/Lorde-NZs-newest-pop-star |archivedate=26 January 2014 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=11126667 |title=Joel Little: Doing the Lorde's work |first=Lydia |last=Jenkin |work=The New Zealand Herald |publisher=APN News & Media |date=19 November 2013 |accessdate=26 January 2014[/tpl] According to Little, Lorde developed her songwriting skills on "Tennis Court", for which she wrote the melody and the whole chorus:
[tpl]quote|"That song was one where we had everything except the chorus. She was sitting in the back of the room while I was working on the music and she was saying, "I think I've got a chorus idea." I asked, "Can I hear it?" and she said, "No, no, no." She wouldn't sing it to me and then once she had it, she basically sang the entire chorus as you hear it now. I was like, "Holy shit, this is seriously good." This was the first time she had this fully formed, amazing idea for a chorus. This is, I don't know how long into the process, but it was when I was like, "This girl is going to be an amazing songwriter, or has turned into one in a really short amount of time." Then I just added the "yeahs" and we tweaked a couple things here and there."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5778093/lorde-co-writer-joel-little-looking-forward-to-making-more-songs|title=Lorde Co-Writer Joel Little 'Looking Forward to Making More Songs'|work=Billboard|first=Chris|last=Payne|date=4 November 2013|accessdate=11 January 2014[/tpl][/tpl]

Lorde said she wrote the song "after having had a glimpse into the music industry, and I was just thinking about how superficial people can be and how we put up all these fronts."[tpl]cite web|last=Iannacci|first=Elio|date=8 January 2014|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2014/01/08/lorde-the-grammy-underdog/|title=Lorde: The Grammy underdog|work=Maclean's|accessdate=19 January 2014[/tpl] She found the idea of a tennis court "very visually beautiful" and "something I kept coming back to on Tumblr and all that sort of thing", saying it was "kind of a symbol of nostalgia for me. It was something which was familiar and safe to me."[tpl]cite web|last=O'Keefe|first=Meghan|date=17 September 2013|url=http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2013-09-17/lorde-tennis-court/|title=YOK Artist Lorde Reveals The "Grandeur" Behind Her Next Single "Tennis Court"|publisher=VH1|accessdate=19 January 2014[/tpl] She also described the song as being "about the town where she grew up and the friends whom she would ... hang out all summer."[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.spotify.com/uk/2013/05/29/|title=Spotify Blog: Our Interview with Lorde|publisher=Spotify|first=Candince|last=Katz|date=29 May 2013|accessdate=10 January 2014[/tpl] Paul Lester, writing for The Guardian, compared the song's lyrical theme to that of two other songs by Lorde: "Royals" and "Million Dollar Bills" (from The Love Club EP).
"Tennis Court" opens with Lorde questioning "Don't you think that is boring how people talk?" featuring her, in the words of Lester, "sweet, sultry and sour" voice, which suggests "a frictional relationship with the high life."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/07/new-band-lorde|title=New band of the day: Lorde (No 1,528)|work=The Guardian|date=7 June 2013|first=Paul|last=Lester|accessdate=12 January 2014[/tpl] A critic from Digital Spy, Robert Cospey, wrote that the track "finds Lorde caught between fame and a more innocent time" with the lines "My head's filling up fast with wicked games/ How can I fuck with fun again when I'm known?"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/review/a525574/lorde-pure-heroine-album-review-a-startlingly-confident-debut.html|title=Lorde: 'Pure Heroine' album review: 'A startlingly confident debut'|first=Robert|last=Cospey|publisher=Digital Spy|date=22 October 2013|accessdate=12 January 2014[/tpl] The tongue-in-cheek word "Yeah!" is repeated after each verse. Another lyric, "It's a new art form showing people how little we care" is described as "perfectly damning the wave of banal hedonism most recently celebrated by the MTV Video Music Awards", according to Kevin Liedel from Slant Magazine.[tpl]cite web|last=Liedel|first=Kevin|title=Lorde: Pure Heroine – Music Review|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/lorde-pure-heroine|accessdate=12 January 2014|work=Slant Magazine|date=29 September 2013[/tpl] At the bridge, Lorde sings "I fall apart, with all my heart/ And you can watch from your window", which was described as a "perfect" commentary on the breakdowns of teenage celebrities in an article published by The Huffington Post.

"Tennis Court" received critical acclaim from music critics and media outlets.

Writing for The Washington Post, Bethonie Butler observed a discrepancy between Lorde's statement that "In a perfect world, she would never do any interviews, and probably there would be one photo out there of her", and the fact that, in the music video, Lorde is "front and center." Butler viewed the video as "a metaphor for celebrity." Writing for Ryan Seacrest's website, Kathleen Perricone complimented the "super simple" clip, which allowed Lorde's "voice and lyrics to really shine." Lindsay Zoladz, of Pitchfork Media, compared the video to that for The Replacements' "Bastards of Young."[tpl]cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18614-lorde-pure-heroine/|title=Lorde: Pure Heroine|publisher=Pitchfork Media|first=Lindsay|last=Zoladz|date=3 October 2013|accessdate=11 January 2014[/tpl] MTV Buzzworthy blogger Luke O'Neil wrote that the "Tennis Court" video is "a bit unsettling at first, but eventually it starts to make sense. is trying to do things a bit differently, and so far it seems like it's working."
