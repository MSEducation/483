[[Concurrent lines]]

CATEGORIES: Elementary geometry

In geometry, three or more lines in a plane or higher-dimensional space are said to be concurrent if they intersect at a single point.

==Examples==

===Triangles===

In a triangle, three basic types of sets of concurrent lines are Altitude (triangle), angle bisectors, medians, and perpendicular bisectors:
Other sets of lines associated with a triangle are concurrent as well. For example:

===Quadrilaterals===

===Hexagons===

===Circles===

The perpendicular bisectors of all chords of a circle are concurrent at the center of the circle.
The lines perpendicular to the tangents to a circle at the points of tangency are concurrent at the center.
All area bisectors and perimeter bisectors of a circle are diameters, and they are concurrent at the circle's center.

===Ellipses===

All area bisectors and perimeter bisectors of an ellipse are concurrent at the center of the ellipse.

===Tetrahedrons===

==Algebra==

According to the Rouché–Capelli theorem, a system of equations is consistent if and only if the rank of the coefficient matrix is equal to the rank of the augmented matrix (the coefficient matrix augmented with a column of intercept terms), and the system has a unique solution if and only if that common rank equals the number of variables. Thus with two variables the k lines in the plane, associated with a set of k equations, are concurrent if and only if the rank of the k×2  coefficient matrix and the rank of the k×3 augmented matrix are both 2. In that case the point of concurrency can be found by solving any two distinct equations simultaneously for the two variables.

==Projective geometry==

In projective geometry, in two dimensions concurrency is the dual of collinearity; in three dimensions, concurrency is the  dual of coplanarity.
