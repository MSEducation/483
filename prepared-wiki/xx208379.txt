The T Craft-class inshore patrol vessels are a class of patrol boat currently in service with the South African Navy. These boats are twin hulled catamarans of glass reinforced plastic (GRP) sandwich construction, capable of carrying up to 15 personnel. Each carries a RIB in the stern well. They were ordered in mid-1991, and commissioned into the South African Navy in 2003. Three of this type were also built for Israel in 1997.
