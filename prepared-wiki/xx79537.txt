Marisa Lee Miller (née Bertetta; born August 6, 1978) is an American model and actress best known for her appearances in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue and her work for Victoria's Secret. After a stint shooting with photographer Mario Testino for fashion magazines such as Vogue, Miller began working for both companies in 2002. In 2007, she became a Victoria's Secret Angel, and graced the cover of the 2008 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue to record-setting numbers. Her accomplishments have led to her being dubbed the "return of the great American supermodel."
She is known for contracts with companies such as Harley-Davidson, for whom she is the first spokesperson in the history of the company, and the NFL, for whom she became a spokesperson in 2010. Miller is considered a sex symbol; she ranked No. 1 on Maxim magazine's 2008 "Hot 100" list and in FHM's global 2010 "Sexiest Women in the World" poll. Aside from modeling, she was an ambassador for both the American Cancer Society and the USO.  Miller made her film debut in R.I.P.D. (2013).

==Early life==

Born Marisa Lee Bertetta in Santa Cruz, California, to Krista (née Useldinger) and Marc Bertetta, Miller attended high school at Aptos High[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/localnews/ci_13477051|title=Aptos High students get a visit from Marisa Miller at lunchtime|date=October 3, 2009|author=Alia Wilson|publisher=Santa Cruz Sentinel|accessdate=June 20, 2012[/tpl] and Monte Vista Christian School. She considered herself a tomboy growing up, with mostly male friends and little awareness of anything girly.
Out of shyness, she often wore large t-shirts to hide her body and would get fully dressed just to go to the trash-can while at the beach.[ref]

Miller was first "discovered" at age sixteen walking through a San Francisco café by two Italian modeling agents.
After talking to her mother, she was on a plane to Italy with her mother a few months later, despite her "shy and conservative" personality.Lauren Murphy. "Miller, Genuine", Los Angeles Confidential, October 2008. Miller gained attention in 1997 when she appeared in the first issue of Perfect 10 magazine. Although she came in third behind Ashley Degenford and Monica Hansen in Perfect 10 magazine's first annual model search, she was repeatedly showcased in following issues, including the covers of the Winter 1998 and August/September 1999 editions, as well as a reprint for the Fall 2004 edition cover.Perfect 10 magazine cover.

==Career==

Miller moved from a start as an amateur magazine model to high profile mainstream work after an acquaintance showed a picture of her to famed fashion photographer Mario Testino in 2001. Testino asked to meet Miller, who was running a surf school at the time, and was invited to Manhattan Beach, California, where she would be surfing.
Noticing her, Testino snapped pictures of her and approached her with a job offer of editorials for both the American and Italian editions of Vogue. Within six months, Miller was working for Victoria's Secret and the coveted Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, in which she appeared in every issue from 2002 to 2008. In particular, she famously posed wearing only an iPod in the 2007 issue. She has appeared in a diverse range of magazines, many of them international editions, such as GQ, Maxim, Glamour, Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire, Elle, and Vanity Fair.[tpl]cite web| title = Fashion Model Directory profile | url = http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/models/Marisa_Miller | accessdate = 2009-02-28 [/tpl] She has featured in advertisements for Nordstrom, J.Crew, Guess?, Tommy Hilfiger, Bath & Body Works, and True Religion jeans.
It was not until 2007 that she filmed her first television commercial for Victoria's Secret, appearing alongside Heidi Klum for the It bra.[tpl]cite web|title=Marisa Miller and Heidi Klum "It Launch"|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGUOgs2iQkw|publisher=YouTube|date=August 2, 2007|accessdate=15 June 2013[/tpl]
On December 4, 2007, Miller made her debut in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, and opened a segment in the following year's edition. Other runway work include 2007's Fashion for Relief show, benefiting victims of Hurricane Katrina, as well as MTV's Fashionably Loud, Imitation of Christ, Inca, and Amir Slama's Rosa Cha, for which she was one of the most anticipated models.
On the February 12, 2008 episode of the Late Show with David Letterman, it was revealed via a three-story billboard in New York City that Miller would grace the cover of that year's Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. The tandem online launch of the issue drew record page views to the SI website: 228 million, a 41% increase over 2007.[tpl]cite news | title = SI Digital Launch of Swimsuit 2008 Experiences Unprecedented Traffic and Engagement Levels | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2008_Feb_22/ai_n24320612 | work= Business Wire | date=2008-02-22[/tpl] In September 2008, Sports Illustrated released a "Best of Marisa Miller" swimsuit calendar for the 2009 year.
Victoria's Secret put her to work in 2008, with a five-city tour to promote the 2008 Swim collection's release in stores; the April–May tour included stops in New York City, Miami, Chicago (where she threw the opening pitch at a Chicago Cubs baseball game), Boston, and Minneapolis. The relaunch of Victoria Secret's sports line, VSX, soon followed, along with her first official campaign as an Angel: promoting the company's fragrance Very Sexy Dare.
For the 2009 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, Miller was chosen to wear the year's "Fantasy Bra," a harlequin design featuring 2,300 white, champagne, and cognac diamonds, and a 16-carat heart-shaped brown-yellow diamond pendant for a $3-million value and 150 total carats.
In response to claims that Miller had parted with Victoria's Secret in January 2010, the Chief Marketing Officer for Limited Brands responded, saying the claims were "unfounded and untrue" while adding "we adore Marisa and we will continue to work with her in the future." In late 2010, Miller confirmed she had moved on from Angel status.[tpl]cite news | date = 2010-11-11 | author = Hollie McKay | title = EXCLUSIVE: Marisa Miller Hangs Up Wings, Focuses on the Troops  | url = http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2010/11/11/exclusive-marisa-miller-hangs-wings-focuses-troops/ | work = Fox News | publisher = News Corporation [/tpl]

===Beyond modeling===

In a July 2010 interview with Forbes, Miller stated that because the fashion industry had changed, with celebrities supplanting models on magazine covers and in campaigns, supermodels have to become brands to be successful.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.forbes.com/2010/07/09/marisa-miller-victorias-secret-supermodel-forbes-woman-entrepreneur-brand.html |title= Marisa Miller: Supermodel Turned Super-Brand |author=Morgan Brennan |work= Forbes |date= 2010-07-09 | page = 2 |accessdate= 2010-09-10|archiveurl=http://archive.is/O6Qfe|archivedate=2013-01-23[/tpl] For that reason, she shifted focus to consumer products reflective of her personality.

In October 2010, the NFL announced Miller had been hired as a spokesperson for the 2010-2011 season, with duties including hosting the NFL International Series game between the San Francisco 49ers and Denver Broncos in London. The announcement drew accusations toward the league of sending a "mixed message" in hiring a well-known lingerie and swimsuit model on the heels of controversies over reporter Ines Sainz's treatment at the New York Jets' facilities and the messages and photos Brett Favre allegedly sent Jenn Sterger.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/giants/sexy_new_spokeswoman_delivers_mixed_ObhkFQgBWssMMiiH0q3z2O |title= Sexy new NFL spokeswoman delivers mixed message |work= New York Post |last= Vaccaro | first= Mike |date= 2010-10-13 |accessdate= 2010-10-19[/tpl] New York Times columnist William C.
