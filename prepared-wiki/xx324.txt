Central Europe is a home to some of world's oldest democracies. However, most of them have been impacted by totalitarian rule, particularly Nazism (Germany, Austria, other occupied countries) and Communism, most of Central Europe have been occupied and later allied with the USSR, often against their will through forged referendum (e.g., Polish people's referendum in 1946) or force. Nevertheless, these experiences have been dealt in most of them. Most of Central European countries score very highly in the Democracy Index:https://portoncv.gov.cv/dhub/porton.por_global.open_file?p_doc_id=1034
