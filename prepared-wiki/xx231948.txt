Jinx is a Croatian Pop band from Zagreb which was formed in 1993. They began their career under the name "High Jinx" coming from a concert in a Zagreb night-club saloon. The members of Jinx are guitarist Coco Mosquito, vocalist Jadranka Bastajic Yaya, drummer Berko Muratovic, keyboardist Mr. Goody, trumpet player Igor Pavlica and bassist Adam Matijasevic. Former members of the band are Goony, Kiky the Kid, bassist Samir Kadribasic, trumpet player Rudi and saxophone player Jordes. The prefix "High" was dropped in 1995, since all fans who attended their first gigs referred to them solely as Jinx. Their first album, Sextasy, was released in English. Berko and Samir  joined the band in 1996. In 1997, Jinx signed their first record contract with Aquarius Records and released their second album called “Second Hand”. In 2001, Percussionist Boris Popov joined the band. Jinx disbanded in 2001. In 2007, Jinx made a comeback with the album Na zapadu (In the West), having signed with Dallas Records.
