In 328, Constantine the Great constructed a bridge across the Danube and built fortifications in the territory of Oltenia and Wallachia. This caused a migration of the Thervingi and Taifali to the west into Tisza Samaritan controlled areas. The Samaritans joined forces with Constantine, who appointed his son Constantine II to campaign against the Goths in late winter 332, reportedly resulting in the deaths of approximately one hundred thousand people due to the  weather and  lack of food. Ariaric was forced to sign a treaty or foedus with Constantine in 332. His son Aoric was raised in Constantinople, where a statue was erected in his memory. [tpl]cite book|author=Patrick J.
