At age 17, visiting family near Augusta, GA., Bryan heard a horrible broadcaster and knew he could do better.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-17245379_ITM |work=San Gabriel Valley Tribune |title=Salute to Route 66 set for stretch through Duarte, Calif |quote=Bryan began his radio career at the age of 17 in a small town in Georgia... |date=2004-09-13[/tpl] He went in and met with the station manager and had a job the very next day.

He is a veteran broadcaster, having served as program director at such stations as KKRZ ("Z100") in Portland, Oregon, which he put on the air in 1984, KUBE in Seattle, Washington, which under his guidance achieved all-time record FM ratings for the market in 1988. He programmed ABC's flagship FM station in New York City, WPLJ, while also serving as morning host. He then shifted his focus exclusively to performing morning hosting duties, appearing on-air at America's most listened-to radio station, Z100 in New York City[tpl]cite news |work=The New York Times |title=Pop Radio Suffers a Midlife Crisis |first=David |last=Browne |date=1991-07-25 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5D61F38F93BA15754C0A967958260[/tpl] and KFRC in San Francisco, California.[tpl]cite news |work=New York Daily News |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1995/04/11/1995-04-11_ito_parody_puts_bryan_on_spot.html |title=Ito parody puts Bryan on spot |first=David |last=Hinckley |date=1995-04-11[/tpl]
Bryan drew national attention and controversy in early 1995 when he rewrote "Iko Iko" into a Lance Ito parody called "Ito Ito." After protests by several interest groups, Bryan was brought up on charges before the city of San Francisco's Human Rights Commission. He was found "guilty" but, as Bryan told the press, "They recommended I be demoted and take a cut in pay. Fortunately, they have no authority, so I told them to screw off."
In 1998 he became the morning host on KJR-FM in his hometown of Seattle, Washington. He came to his current station, KRTH in Los Angeles, in June 2002.[tpl]cite news |work=The Orange County Register |title=KRTH adds Bryan to A.M. lineup |date=2002-06-02 |first=Gary |last=Lycan |quote=There will be a new 'oldie' at KRTH/101.1 FM starting Monday -- Gary Bryan will take over the 6-10 morning show.
