Besides his professional work in Biblical Studies, Robinson is also widely known for his ecumenical dialogue with non-Mormon scholars.  He was the first practicing Latter-day Saint to be tenured in Religion at a non-Mormon institution (Lycoming College).  Robinson and Craig Blomberg, an Evangelical New Testament scholar at the Denver Seminary, co-authored an important book on LDS/Evangelical relations entitled How Wide the Divide? (1997), which in turn led to an ongoing series of friendly and objective exchanges between LDS and traditional Christian scholars.

==Controversy==

In LDS circles, Robinson is generally considered to be orthodox and to have a reliable grasp of LDS doctrine.  He came to the center of a conflict between the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) and Salt Lake City publisher Signature Books, through his critical review of the writing of Dan Vogel, by describing it as being patterned after the teachings of Korihor,[tpl]Citation |last= Robinson |first= Stephen E. |title= The Word of God: Essays on Mormon Scripture (by Dan Vogel, A review of) |url= http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/review/?vol=3&num=1&id=74 |journal= FARMS Review |volume= 3 |issue= 1 |pages= 312–318 |location= Provo, Utah |publisher= Maxwell Institute |year= 1991 [/tpl] an atheist orator in the Book of Mormon ([tpl]lds|Alma|alma|30[/tpl]). According to Daniel C. Peterson, then editor of the FARMS Review, FARMS tried to quiet down the counter-attack by Signature Books by emphasizing that Robinson's review was directed at the methodology of the writings and not the beliefs or character of the authors reviewed.[tpl]citation |last= Peterson |first= Daniel C. |authorlink= Daniel C.
