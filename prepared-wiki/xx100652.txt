Saints Abdon and Sennen, variously written in early calendars and martyrologies Abdo, Abdus, and Sennes, Sennis, Zennen, are recognized by the Roman Catholic Church as Christian Martyrs, with a feast day on 30 July."Martyrologium Romanum" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001 ISBN 88-209-7210-7) In some places they have been honoured on 20 March, and the first Sunday of May.Holweck, F. G., "A Biographical Dictionary of the Saints," St. Louis, MO: B. Herder Book Co., 1924. 
Nothing is known historically about these saints except their names, that they were martyrs, and that they were buried on 30 July of some year in the Cemetery of Pontianus on the Via Portuensis. Because of this lack of knowledge about them, they are no longer listed in the Roman Catholic Calendar of Saints to be commemorated liturgically worldwide,"Calendarium Romanum" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 132 but they may still be celebrated everywhere on their feast day unless in some locality an obligatory celebration is assigned to that day.General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 355 c The rank of their celebration was given as "Simple" in the Tridentine Calendar and remained such until the classification was changed to that of "Commemoration" in the General Roman Calendar of 1962.

Their Acts, written for the most part prior to the ninth century, describe them as Persians martyred under Decius,[tpl]cite web|url=  http://www.saintpatrickdc.org/ss/0730.shtml|title=Saints of July 30: Abdon and Sennen|year=2009|publisher= St. Patrick Catholic Church Saint of the Day|accessdate=March 19, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=   http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01032a.htm|title=Sts.

They relate that their bodies were buried by a subdeacon, Quirinus, and later transferred in the reign of Constantine to the Cemetery of Pontianus on the road to Porto, near the gates of Rome. 
A fresco found on the sarcophagus supposed to contain their remains represents them receiving crowns from Christ. According to Martigny, this fresco dates from the seventh century. Several cities, notably Florence and Soissons, claim possession of their bodies, but the Bollandists say that they rest in Rome.   The Abbey Benedictine Sainte Marie in Arles-sur-Tech, France also claims a tomb.
Abdon and Sennen are patron saints of Calasparra, in Murcia, Spain.  The feasts days celebrated in their honor in this Spanish town date back to the 16th century.[tpl]cite web|url=  http://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=c,369,m,1218&r=ReP-4307-DETALLE_REPORTAJES|title=Fiestas Patronales de los Santos Mártires San Abdón y San Senén|publisher= Región de Murcia|accessdate=March 19, 2012[/tpl]
