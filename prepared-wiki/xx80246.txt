==FPGAs==

The Stratix series FPGAs are the company's largest, highest bandwidth devices, with up to 1.1 million logic elements, integrated transceivers at up to 28 Gbit/s, up to 1.6 Tbit/s of serial switching capability, up to 1,840 GMACs of signal-processing performance, and up to 7 x72 DDR3 memory interfaces at 800 MHz.Graham Pitcher, "Altera set to bring ‘big performance boosts’ to fpga users", New Electronics, 10 June 2013. Retrieved June 25, 2013. Cyclone series FPGAs and SoC FPGAs are the company's lowest cost, lowest power FPGAs, with variants offering integrated transceivers up to 5 Gbit/s. In between these two device families are Arria series FPGAs and SoC FPGAs, which provide a balance of performance, power, and cost for mid-range applications such as remote radio heads, video conferencing equipment, and wireline access equipment. Arria FPGAs have integrated transceivers up to 10 Gbit/s.
In December 2012, the company announced that they are shipping their first 28 nm SoC FPGA devices.Clive Maxfield, "Altera's shipping its first SoC FPGAs", EE Times, 12 December 2012. Retrieved Jan 9, 2013. According to Altera, fully depleted silicon on insulator (FDSOI) chip manufacturing process is beneficial for FPGAs.Peter Clarke, "Altera eyes FDSOI process for FPGAs", EE Times, 15 December 2012. Retrieved Jan 9, 2013.

==ASICs==

Altera offers a design flow based on HardCopy ASICs, which transitions the FPGA design, once finalized, to a form which is not alterable. This design flow reduces design security risks as well as costs for higher volume production. Design engineers can prototype their designs in Stratix series FPGAs, and then migrate these designs to HardCopy ASICs when they're ready for volume production.
The unique design flow makes hardware/software co-design and co-verification possible. The flow has been benchmarked to deliver systems to market 9 to 12 months faster, on average, than with standard-cell solutions. Design engineers can employ a single RTL, set of intellectual property (IP) cores, and Quartus II design software for both FPGA and ASIC implementations. Altera's HardCopy Design Center manages test insertion.Altera Product Catalog, January 2009

==40-nm Technology==

In May 2008, Altera introduced the industry's first 40-nm programmable logic devices: the Stratix IV FPGAs and HardCopy IV ASICs.Mark LaPedus, "Analyst comments on Altera's 40-nm FPGAs", EETimes, May 19, 2008. Retrieved Jan 14, 2013. Both devices are available with integrated transceiver options. Since then, the company has also introduced Stratix IV GT FPGAs, which have 11.3-Gbit/s transceivers for 40G/100G applications,http://www.altera.com/b/stratix-iv-gt-transceiver.html and Arria II GX FPGAs, which have 3.75-Gbit/s transceivers for power- and cost-sensitive applications.
Semiconductors manufactured on a 40-nm process node address many of the industry's key challenges, including power consumption, device performance, and cost. Altera's devices are manufactured using techniques such as 193-nm immersion lithography and technologies such as extreme low-k dielectrics and strained silicon. These techniques and technologies bring enhancements to device performance and power efficiency.

==28-nm technology==

In April 2010, Altera introduced the FPGA industry's second 28-nm device, the Stratix V FPGA (to Xilinx's Kintex-7 FPGA), available with transceivers at speeds up to 28 Gbit/s. This device family has more than 1 million logic elements, up to 53 Mb of embedded memory, up to 7 x72 DDR3 DIMMs at 800 MHz, 1.6-Gbit/s LVDS performance, and up to 3,680 variable-precision DSP blocks. In August 2011, Altera began shipping 28-nm Stratix V GT devices featuring 28-gigabits-per-second (Gbps) transceivers. "Altera ships Stratix V GT FPGAs", EETimes, August 24, 2011. Retrieved November 18, 2011.
The devices also feature some unique features. Embedded HardCopy Blocks harden standard or logic-intensive applications, increasing integration and delivering twice the density without a cost or power penalty. Altera has developed a user friendly method for partial reconfiguration, so core functionality can be changed easily and on the fly. And there is a path to HardCopy V ASICs, when designs are ready for volume production. Also, Altera’s 28 nm FPGAs aim to reduce power requirements to 200 mW per channel.
In December 2012, the company announced the shipment of its first 28 nm Cyclone V SoC devices, which have a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor system with FPGA logic on a single chip.Toni McConnel, Embedded. "Altera ships its first Cyclone V SoC devices." Dec 12, 2012. Retrieved Jan 3, 2013."Altera, ARM roll out FPGA-adaptive embedded software toolkit", EET Asia, 21 December 2012. Retrieved Jan 3, 2013. The new SoCs are targeted for wireless communications, industrial, video surveillance, automotive and medical equipment markets. With these SoCs devices, users are able to create custom field-programmable SoC variants for power, board space, performance and cost optimization.

==14-nm technology==

In February 2013, Altera announced an agreement with Intel to use Intel’s foundry services to produce its 14-nm node for the future manufacturing of its FPGAs, based on Intel’s 14 nm tri-gate transistor technology, in place of Altera’s ongoing agreement with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC).Mark LaPedus, "Intel-Altera deal to shake up foundry landscape", Chip Design Magazine, February 26, 2013. Retrieved June 3, 2013.

==IP Cores==

Altera and its partners offer an array of intellectual property (IP) cores that serve as building blocks that design engineers can drop into their system designs to perform specific functions. IP cores eliminate some of the time-consuming tasks of creating every block in a design from scratch.

===Embedded Processors===

Altera offers an embedded portfolio with a broad selection of soft processor cores.
And one hard IP processor core.

==Design software==

All of Altera's devices are supported by a common design environment, Quartus II design software. Quartus II software is available in a subscription-based edition and a free Web-based edition. It includes a number of tools to foster productivity. Some Quartus II software features include:

==Competition==

Altera's largest competitor and long-time rival is FPGA founder and market-share leader Xilinx.John Edwards, “No room for Second Place”, EDN, 1 June 2006. Retrieved January 15, 2009.Jim Turley, "The Future Belongs to Programmers", EE Journal, 2 January 2012. Retrieved Jan 14, 2013.
The next closest competitor is Lattice Semiconductor, representing less than 10 percent of the market.
Other FPGA makers, Actel (now Microsemi) and QuickLogic, sell to differentiated market segments that Altera mostly does not address.
In broader terms, Altera competes with ASIC, Structured ASIC, and Zero Mask-Charge ASIC companies like eASIC. Moore's Law and improving software tools are rapidly expanding FPGAs' potential markets.

==Restatement==

On June 21, 2006, Altera Corp. restated its 1996-2005 financial results to correct accounting errors related to stock-based compensation expense.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.eetasia.com/ART_8800422649_499485_NT_2232dfe2.HTM |title= Altera to restate financial results[/tpl]
