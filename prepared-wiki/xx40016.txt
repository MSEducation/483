High Fidelity is a 2000 American comedy-drama film directed by Stephen Frears and starring John Cusack and Danish actress Iben Hjejle. The film is based on the 1995 British novel of the same name by Nick Hornby, with the setting moved from London to Chicago and the name of the lead character changed. After seeing the film, Hornby expressed his happiness with John Cusack's performance as Rob Gordon (changed from Rob Fleming in the book), saying, "At times, it appears to be a film in which John Cusack reads my book".[tpl]cite web |url=http://thisdistractedglobe.com/2009/03/23/high-fidelity |title=Strangely Romantic in a Way |work=This Distracted Globe |accessdate=2010-10-04[/tpl]

==Plot==

The film centers on Rob Gordon (John Cusack), a self-confessed music geek with a poor understanding of women. After getting dumped by his current girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle), he decides to look up some of his old partners in an attempt to figure out where he keeps going wrong in his relationships.
He spends his days at his record store, Championship Vinyl, where he holds court over the customers that drift through. Helping Rob in his task of musical elitism are Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), the "musical moron twins," as he refers to them. Armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of all things musical, they compile "top five" lists for every conceivable occasion, openly mock the ignorance of their customers, and, every so often, sell a few records.
Rob and the staff have a strong dislike for two shoplifting skateboarder teenagers, Vince (Chris Rehmann) and Justin (Ben Carr). One day, he listens to a recording that they did (actually "The Inside Game" by Royal Trux) and offers them a record deal, starting his own label called "Top 5 Records". During his off hours, he pines for Laura and does his best to win her back.
Rob soon hears that Laura's father, who liked Rob, has died, and attends his funeral with Laura. Shortly after the reception, Rob realizes he never committed to Laura and always had one foot out the door. This made him realize he neglected his own future in the process. Afterwards, he and Laura move back in together again, and she organizes an evening where he has the opportunity to revisit a love of his youth: de-jaying. It is also a celebration of the recently released single by the two delinquents, where Barry's band plays "Let's Get It On".

==Production==

Nick Hornby's book was optioned by Disney's Touchstone Pictures in 1995 where it went into development for three years.[tpl]cite news | last = Malanowski | first = Jamie | title = Keeping Faith with High Fidelity | work = New York Times | date = April 2, 2000 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/02/movies/film-keeping-faith-with-high-fidelity.html | accessdate = 2009-03-27 [/tpl] Disney boss Joe Roth had a conversation with recording executive Kathy Nelson who recommended John Cusack and his writing and producing partners D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink adapt the book. She had worked previously with them on Grosse Pointe Blank and felt that they had the right sensibilities for the material.[tpl]cite news | last = Portman | first = Jamie | title = Quirky John Cusack Embraces the Eccentric – Again | work = Ottawa Citizen | date = March 27, 2000 | url = | accessdate = [/tpl] According to Cusack, DeVincentis is the closest to the record-obsessive characters in the film, owning 1,000 vinyl records and thousands of CDs and tapes.[tpl]cite news | last = Wloszczyna | first = Susan | title = Cusack, in Tune with His Movies | work = USA Today | date = March 31, 2000 | url = | accessdate = [/tpl] They wrote a treatment that was immediately greenlit by Roth.

===Screenplay===

The writers decided to change the book's setting from London to Chicago because they were more familiar with the city and it also had a "great alternative music scene", according to Pink.[tpl]cite news | last = Beale | first = Lewis | title = Staying Faithful to High Fidelity | work = Daily News | date = April 2, 2000 | url = | accessdate = [/tpl] Cusack said, "When I read the book I knew where everything was in Chicago. I knew where the American Rob went to school and dropped out, where he used to spin records, I knew two or three different record shops when I was growing up that had a Rob, a Dick and a Barry in them".[tpl]cite news | last = | first = Bazza | title = John Cusack Takes Five | work = IOFilm.co.uk | url = http://www.iofilm.co.uk/feats/interviews/j/john_cusack.shtml | accessdate = 2008-12-03 [/tpl] Charlotte Tudor, of the film's distributor, Buena Vista, said: "Chicago has the same feel as north London, there is a vibrant music scene, a lot of the action is set in smoky bars and, of course, there is the climate. But everyone, including Nick, felt that geography was not the central issue. It has a universal appeal".[tpl]cite news | last = Watson-Smyth | first = Kate | title = A case of low fidelity as Hornby's novel translates awkwardly to film | work = The Independent | date = April 1, 2000 | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/a-case-of-low-fidelity-as-hornbys-novel-translates-awkwardly-to-film-721614.html | accessdate = 2008-12-03 [/tpl] Scenes were filmed in the neighborhood of Wicker Park, Chicago.[tpl]cite web | last = McGuire | first = Judy | title=Romance, Movie Style – Love on Location – High Fidelity | url = http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1879389_1879392_1879410,00.html | work = Time | accessdate = January 3, 2013 | date = February 28, 2009 [/tpl]
Cusack found that the greatest challenge adapting the novel was pulling off Rob Gordon's frequent breaking of the fourth wall and talking directly to the audience. The screenwriters did this to convey Rob's inner confessional thoughts and were influenced by a similar technique in the Michael Caine film, Alfie. Cusack rejected this approach because he thought that "there'd just be too much of me". Once director Stephen Frears signed on to direct, he suggested using this technique and everyone agreed to use it.
Cusack and the writers floated the idea that Rob could have a conversation with Bruce Springsteen in his head, inspired by a reference in Hornby's book where the narrator wishes he could handle his past girlfriends as well as Springsteen does in his song, "Bobby Jean" on Born in the U.S.A.[tpl]cite news | last = Wloszczyna | first = Susan | title = Boss Cameo a Musical Coup | work = USA Today | date = March 31, 2000 | url = | accessdate = [/tpl] They never believed they would actually get the musician to appear in the film, but thought putting him in the script would get the studio excited about it. Cusack knew Springsteen socially and called the musician up and pitched the idea. Springsteen asked for a copy of the script and afterwards agreed to do it.

===Casting===

Frears was at the Berlin Film Festival and saw Mifune's Last Song, starring Iben Hjejle, and realized that he had found the actress for the role. Frears read Hornby's book and enjoyed it but did not connect with the material because it was not about his generation.[tpl]cite news | last = Husband | first = Stuart | title = Tracks of My Frears | work = The Guardian | date = April 21, 2000 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2000/apr/21/2 | accessdate = 2008-12-03 [/tpl] He accepted the job because he wanted to work with Cusack again (they had worked together previously on The Grifters) and liked the idea of changing the setting from London to Chicago. The director was also responsible for insisting on keeping Jack Black on as Barry. Frears has said that many people from the studio would come to watch his rushes.[tpl]cite news | last = Wood | first = Gaby | title = The Observer Profile: Jack Black | work = The Observer | date = December 11, 2005 | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,1664609,00.html | accessdate = 2007-11-30 [/tpl]

==Soundtrack==

One of the challenges that the screenwriters faced was figuring out which songs would go where in the film because Rob, Dick, and Barry "are such musical snobs", according to Cusack. He and his screenwriting partners listened to 2,000 songs and picked 70 song cues.

Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, "Watching High Fidelity, I had the feeling I could walk out of the theater and meet the same people on the street — and want to, which is an even higher compliment".[tpl]cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | title = High Fidelity | work = Chicago Sun-Times | date = March 31, 2000 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000331/REVIEWS/3310302/1023 | accessdate = 2008-12-02 [/tpl] In his review for the Washington Post, Desson Howe praised Jack Black as "a bundle of verbally ferocious energy.

If the movie had had a richer romantic spirit, he might have embraced both in one swooning gesture."[tpl]cite news | last = Gleiberman | first = Owen | title = High Fidelity | work = Entertainment Weekly | date = March 24, 2000 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,64593,00.html | accessdate = 2009-09-03 [/tpl] Peter Travers, in his review for Rolling Stone, wrote, "It hits all the laugh bases, from grins to guffaws.

DeVincentis and Steve Pink — have rewritten Scott Rosenberg's script to catch Hornby's spirit without losing the sick comic twists they gave 1997's Grosse Pointe Blank."[tpl]cite news | last = Travers | first = Peter | title = High Fidelity | work = Rolling Stone | date = December 8, 2000 | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5947227/review/5947228/high_fidelity | accessdate = 2008-12-03 [/tpl] In his review for The Observer, Philip French wrote, "High Fidelity is an extraordinarily funny film, full of verbal and visual wit.

After seeing the film, Hornby expressed his approval of John Cusack's performance as Rob Gordon (changed from Rob Fleming in the book), saying, "At times, it appears to be a film in which John Cusack reads my book."
