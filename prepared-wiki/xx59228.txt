==Contemporary assessments==

In Germany, it was compared with Bismarck’s famous "Reinsurance Treaty" with Russia in 1887. Votes endorsing the treaty in the Foreign Committee of the Reichstag had been unanimous — a first for the Weimar Republic.German-Soviet relations between the two World Wars, 1919-1939: Edward Hallett Carr Ayer Publishing http://books.google.com/books?id=PgBsST4r9CQC&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=German-Soviet+Berlin+treaty+1926&source=bl&ots=WK2paqSLUb&sig=SiYOLkwwwZD7oCLRY_yvCfDGhDo&hl=ru&ei=_mJ5S--GFKiImwPcs8StCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=German-Soviet%20Berlin%20treaty%201926&f=false

==Aftermath==

In June 1926, German banks granted to the Soviet Union credits to the total amount of 300 millions marks — "thanks to the cooperation of the German Government"; interest was fixed at 9.4% per annum. In October 1926, the Soviet Government invited a notable group of Reichstag deputies to Moscow. Georgy Chicherin—while visiting Berlin at December 1926—remarked on the improvement of the present German-Soviet relation in comparison with 1925.
From that time forward, however, there was a slow decline in relations, with a complete breakdown reached a few months after Hitler’s 1933 rise to power.p.91 German-Soviet relations between the two World Wars, 1919-1939: Edward Hallett Carr Ayer Publishing http://books.google.com/books?id=PgBsST4r9CQC&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=German-Soviet+Berlin+treaty+1926&source=bl&ots=WK2paqSLUb&sig=SiYOLkwwwZD7oCLRY_yvCfDGhDo&hl=ru&ei=_mJ5S--GFKiImwPcs8StCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=German-Soviet%20Berlin%20treaty%201926&f=false Prolongations of the Treaty were signed on June 24, 1931, and in the same year German banks granted the Soviet Union 300 millions marks′ worth of additional credits for purchasing German industrial goods.Документы внешней политики СССР Том 14. 1 января — 31 декабря 1931 г. — М.: Политиздат, 1968.
