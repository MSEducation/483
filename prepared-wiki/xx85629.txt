[tpl]Nihongo|Tsukasa Hojo|北条 司|Hōjō Tsukasa|born on March 5, 1959, in Kokura, Kitakyushu, Japan[/tpl] is a Japanese manga artist.[tpl]cite web|url=http://lambiek.net/artists/h/hojo_tsukasa.htm|title=Comic creator: Tsukasa Hôjo|publisher=lambiek.net|accessdate=April 13, 2010[/tpl] He studied technical design while still at Kyushu Sangyo University, where he began to draw manga. He worked on several one-shot stories before releasing his serialized works: Cat's Eye, City Hunter and Angel Heart.
Hojo claims that he really did not have any inspiration for these works other than having to meet a deadline. He says he wrote down a few things, he thought about a few things, and one day the ideas just came to him, out of thin air. In reality, the process was a lot more complicated, with editors involved, but fans got the benefit of Hojo's sense of adventure and humor.
After the success of Cat's Eye and City Hunter, Hojo went on to work on other series such as Family Compo. His current ongoing series is Angel Heart, a spinoff of City Hunter set in an alternate universe. It has been serialized in the Weekly Comic Bunch since 2001 and 30 collected volumes has been published so far.
Tsukasa Hojo is Takehiko Inoue's mentor. Inoue worked as an assistant to Hojo during the production of City Hunter. Hojo is also a long-time acquaintance of Fist of the North Star illustrator Tetsuo Hara, who was also one of the founders of Coamix. Hojo contributed to the production Fist of the North Star: The Legends of the True Savior film series by designing the character of Reina.
He was honor guest of the eleventh French Japan Expo which was held in July 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animeland.com/news/voir/1598/Tsukasa-Hojo-a-Japan-Expo|title=Animeland - Tsukasa Hôjô à Japan Expo|date=February 19, 2010|publisher=Animeland|language=French|accessdate=April 13, 2010[/tpl]
