The M61 Vulcan is a hydraulically or pneumatically driven, six-barreled, air-cooled, electrically fired Gatling-style rotary cannon which fires 20 mm rounds at an extremely high rate. The M61 and its derivatives have been the principal cannon armament of United States military fixed-wing aircraft for fifty years.
The M61 was originally produced by General Electric, and after several mergers and acquisitions is currently produced by General Dynamics.

==Development==

At the end of World War II, the United States Army began to consider new directions for future military aircraft guns. The higher speeds of jet-powered fighter aircraft meant that achieving an effective number of hits would be extremely difficult without a much higher volume of fire. While captured German designs (principally the Mauser MG 213C) showed the potential of the single-barrel revolver cannon, the practical rate of fire of such a design was still limited by ammunition feed and barrel wear concerns. The Army wanted something better, combining extremely high rate of fire with exceptional reliability.
In response to this requirement, the Armament Division of General Electric resurrected an old idea: the multi-barrel Gatling gun. The original Gatling gun had fallen out of favor because of the need for an external power source to rotate the barrel assembly, but the new generation of turbojet-powered fighters offered sufficient electric power to operate the gun, and electric operation offered reliability superior to a gas operated weapon.http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/2433/eleckeygatling.jpg
With multiple barrels, the rate of fire per barrel could be lower than a single-barrel revolver cannon while still giving a superior total rate of fire. The idea of powering a Gatling gun from an external electric power source was not a novel idea at the end of the World War II era, as Richard Jordan Gatling himself had done just that in 1893, with a patent he filed.
The Army issued General Electric the contract in 1946 for "Project Vulcan", a six-barrel weapon capable of firing 7,200 rounds per minute (rpm).[tpl]Cite web |title=The Gatling Gun |accessdate=2008-09-28 |url=http://tri.army.mil/lc/cs/csa/aagatlin.htm#M61 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080517051f412/http://tri.army.mil/lc/cs/csa/aagatlin.htm#M61  |archivedate=2008-05-17[/tpl] Although European designers were moving towards heavier 30 mm weapons for better hitting power, the U.S. initially concentrated on a powerful [tpl]convert|0.60|in|disp=flip|adj=on[/tpl] cartridge designed for a pre-war anti-tank rifle, expecting that the cartridge's high muzzle velocity would be beneficial for improving hit ratios on high speed targets.
The first GE prototypes of the [tpl]convert|0.60|in|disp=flip|adj=on[/tpl] caliber T45 were ground-fired in 1949; it achieved 2,500 rpm, which was increased to 4,000 rpm by 1950. By the early 1950s, the USAF decided that high velocity alone might not be sufficient to ensure target destruction and tested 20 mm and 27 mm alternatives based on the [tpl]convert|0.60|in|disp=flip|adj=on[/tpl] caliber cartridge. These variants of the T45 were known as the T171 and T150 respectively, and were first tested in 1952. Eventually, the 20×102 mm cartridge was determined to have the desired balance of projectile and explosive weight and muzzle velocity.
The development of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter revealed that the T171 Vulcan (later redesignated M61) suffered problems with its linked ammunition, being prone to misfeed and presenting a foreign object damage (FOD) hazard with discarded links. A linkless ammunition feed system was developed for the upgraded M61A1, which subsequently became the standard cannon armament of U.S. fighters.
In 1993, General Electric sold its aerospace division, including GE Armament Systems along with the design and production tooling for the M61 and GE's other rotary cannon, to Martin Marietta. After Martin's merger with Lockheed, the rotary cannon became the responsibility of Lockheed Martin Armament Systems. Lockheed Martin Armament Systems was later acquired by General Dynamics, who currently produce the M61 and its various offspring.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/equip/m61.htm|title=M61 20mm cannon|accessdate=2009-02-28|author=|date=23 April 2000|work=|publisher=Federation of American Scientists[/tpl]

==Description==

The Vulcan is a Gatling gun: each of the cannon's six barrels fires once in turn during each revolution of the barrel cluster. The multiple barrels provide both a very high rate of fire—around 100 rounds per second—and contribute to prolonged weapon life by minimizing barrel erosion and heat generation. Mean time between jams or failures is in excess of 10,000 rounds, making it an extremely reliable weapon. The success of the Vulcan Project and its subsequent progeny, the very-high-speed Gatling gun, has led to guns of the same configuration being referred to as Vulcan Cannon, which can sometimes confuse nomenclature on the subject.
Most aircraft versions of the M61 are hydraulically driven and electrically primed. The gun rotor, barrel assembly and ammunition feed system are rotated by a hydraulic drive motor through a system of flexible drive shafts. The round is fired by an electric priming system where an electrical current from a firing lead passes through the firing pin to the primer as each round is rotated into the firing position.
The self-powered version, the GAU-4 (called M130 in Army service), is gas-operated, tapping gun gas from three of the six barrels to operate the mechanism. The self-powered Vulcan weighs about [tpl]convert|10|lb|kg|disp=flip[/tpl] more than its electric counterpart, but requires no external power source to operate.
The initial M61 used linked, belted ammunition, but the ejection of spent links created considerable (and ultimately insuperable) problems. The original weapon was soon replaced by the M61A1, with a linkless feed system. Depending on the application, the feed system can be either single-ended (ejecting spent cases and unfired rounds) or double-ended (returning casings back to the magazine). A disadvantage of the M61 is that the bulk of the weapon, its feed system, and ammunition drum makes it difficult to fit it into a densely packed airframe.
The feed system must be custom-designed for each application, adding [tpl]convert|300|-|400|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=flip[/tpl] to the complete weapon. Most aircraft installations are double-ended, because the ejection of empty cartridges can cause a foreign-object damage (FOD) hazard for jet engines and because the retention of spent cases assists in maintaining the center of gravity of the aircraft. The first aircraft to carry the M61A1 was the C model of the F-104, starting in 1959.
A lighter version of the Vulcan developed for use on the F-22 Raptor, the M61A2, is mechanically the same as the M61A1, but with thinner barrels to reduce overall weight to [tpl]convert|202|lb|kg|disp=flip[/tpl]. The rotor and housing have also been modified to remove any piece of metal not absolutely needed for operation and replaces some metal components with lighter weight materials. The F/A-18E/F also uses this version.F/A-18E/F Super Hornet Maritime Strike Attack Aircraft "..features new lightweight gun system is the General Dynamics M61A2, which has a switchable firing rate of 4,000 or 6,000 shots per minute and a fully integrated linkless ammunition feed system"
The Vulcan's rate of fire is typically 6,000 rounds per minute, although some versions (such as that of the AMX and the F-106 Delta Dart) are limited to a lower rate, and others have a selectable rate of fire of either 4,000 or 6,000 rounds per minute. The M61A2's lighter barrels allow a somewhat higher rate of fire up to 6,600 rounds per minute.

===Ammunition===

Practically no powered rotary cannon is supplied with enough ammunition for a full minute of firing, because of the weight of the ammunition.  In order to avoid using the few hundred rounds carried in a matter of a single trigger pull, a burst controller is generally used to limit the number of rounds fired at each trigger pull.  Bursts of from two or three up to 40 or 50 can be selected.
Until the late 1980s the M61 primarily used the M50 series of ammunition in various types, typically firing a [tpl]convert|3.5|oz|disp=flip[/tpl] projectile at a muzzle velocity of about [tpl]convert|3380|ft/s|m/s|disp=flip[/tpl]. A variety of Armor-Piercing Incendiary (API), High Explosive Incendiary (HEI), and training rounds are available. Around 1988 a new round was introduced, the PGU-28/B,[tpl]Cite web|title=PGU-27A/B TP/PGU-28A/B SAPHEI/ GU-30A/B TP-T |accessdate=2008-09-28 |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/pgu-28.htm |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org[/tpl] which is now standard for U.S. Navy and Air Force aircraft. The PGU-28/B is a "low-drag" round designed to reduce in-flight drag and deceleration, and has a slightly increased muzzle velocity of [tpl]convert|3450|ft/s|m/s|disp=flip[/tpl].
It is a semi-armor piercing high explosive incendiary (SAPHEI) round, providing substantial improvements in range, accuracy, and power over the preceding M56A3 HEI round. The PGU-28/B has not been without problems, however. A 2000 USAF safety report noted 24 premature detonation mishaps (causing serious damage in many cases) in 12 years with the SAPHEI round, compared to only two such mishaps in the entire recorded history of the M56 round. The report estimated that the current PGU-28/B had a potential failure rate 80 times higher than USAF standards permit.https://tercel.mugu.navy.mil/drlog/awcap/volumes/vol8/ammo/v348_prob.pdf [tpl]Dead link|date=March 2009[/tpl]
The main types of combat rounds and their main characteristics are listed in the table below.

==Applications and first combat use==

The Vulcan first entered aerial combat on 4 April 1965 when four North Vietnamese Air Force MiG-17s (J-5s)Toperczer (MiG-17/MiG-19 Units) p. 65 attacked a force of 10 escorting North American F-100 Super Sabres (2 of which were assigned weather reconnaissance duties) and 48 Vulcan armed, but "bomb-laden F-105s", shooting down two Thunderchiefs.  The MiG Leader, Capt. Tran Hanh, and the only survivor from the 4 MiGs reported that U.S. jets had pursued them and that F-105s had shot down 3 of his aircraft, killing Lieutenants Pham Giay, Le Minh Huan, and Tran Nguyen Nam.  Capt. Donald Kilgus piloting an F-100 did receive an official probable kill with his four M39 20mm cannons during the engagement; however no other US pilot reported destroying any MiGs during the battle, leaving open the plausibility that at least 2 of the MiG-17s may have been downed by their own AA fire.Hobson p. 17Anderton p. 71Toperczer (MiG-17/MiG-19 Units) p. 30, 31, 88
The first confirmed Vulcan gun kill occurred on 29 June 1966 when Major Fred Tracy, flying his F-105 Thunderchief with the 421st TFS, fired 200 rounds of 20mm into a MiG-17 that had just fired a 23mm shell through one side of his cockpit and which exited out the other side.  When the NVAF MiG flew in front of him after making his pass, Maj. Tracy opened fire on him.McCarthy Jr. p. 38, photo of 23mm cannon exit hole on Maj. Tracy's F-105Michel III p. 56
The gun was installed in the Air Force's A-7D version of the A-7 Corsair II where it replaced the Naval versions' standard dual cannon, and subsequently adopted by the Navy on the A-7E[tpl]cite book|first=Christopher|last=Chant |title=A Compendium of Armaments and Military Hardware |url=http://books.google.com/?id=k9cNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=vulcan+gun+(serbia+OR++kosovo+OR+yugoslavia)#PPA115,M1 |edition= |year=1987|publisher=Routledge|location= |isbn=978-0-7102-0720-3 |pages=65–70, 106, 114–115, 341–343, 363, 389, 404–405[/tpl] and in future fighters. Significantly it was integrated into the newer F-4E Phantom II variants. The F-4 was originally designed without cannons as it was believed that missiles had made guns obsolete. Combat experience in Vietnam showed that a gun could be more effective than guided missiles in many combat situations, and that an externally carried gun pod was less effective than an internal gun.
