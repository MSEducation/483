[tpl]Nihongo|Toshiba Corporation|株式会社東芝|Kabushiki-gaisha Tōshiba[/tpl] is a Japanese multinational engineering and electronics conglomerate corporation headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. Its products and services include information technology and communications equipment and systems, electronic components and materials, power systems, industrial and social infrastructure systems, consumer electronics, household appliances, medical equipment, office equipment, lighting, and logistics.
Toshiba was founded in 1938 as Tokyo Shibaura Electric K.K. through the merger of Shibaura Seisaku-sho (founded in 1875) and Tokyo Denki (founded in 1890). The company name was officially changed to Toshiba Corporation in 1978. Toshiba has made numerous corporate acquisitions during its history, including of Semp in 1977, of Westinghouse Electric Company in 2006, of Landis+Gyr in 2011, and of IBM's point-of-sale business in 2012.
Toshiba is organised into four main business groupings: the Digital Products Group, the Electronic Devices Group, the Home Appliances Group and the Social Infrastructure Group. In 2010, Toshiba was the world's fifth-largest personal computer vendor measured by revenues (after Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Acer and Lenovo).[tpl]cite press release |title=Gartner Says Worldwide PC Market Grew 13 Percent in 2007|publisher= Economic Times|date=January 16, 2010|url= http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/infotech/hardware/Worldwide-PC-shipments-jump-158-in-Q4-IDC/articleshow/5442476.cms|accessdate=January 18, 2010[/tpl] In the same year, it was also the world's fourth-largest manufacturer of semiconductors by revenues (after Intel Corporation, Samsung Electronics and Texas Instruments).

==History==

===1939 to 2000===

Toshiba was founded in 1939 by the merger of Shibaura Seisakusho (Shibaura Engineering Works) Corporate History | Shibaura Mechatronics Corporation. Shibaura.co.jp. Retrieved on 2013-07-26. and Tokyo Denki (Tokyo Electric). Shibaura Seisakusho had been founded as Tanaka Seisakusho by Tanaka Hisashige in 1875 as Japan's first manufacturer of telegraph equipment.[tpl]cite book |last=Odagiri|first=Hiroyuki|title=Technology and Industrial Development in Japan |publisher=Clarendon Press, Oxford|year=1996|isbn=0-19-828802-6|page=158[/tpl] In 1904, it was renamed Shibaura Seisakusho. Through the first decades of the 20th century Shibaura Seisakusho had become a major manufacturer of heavy electrical machinery as Japan modernized during the Meiji Era and became a world industrial power. Tokyo Denki was founded as Hakunetsusha in 1890 and had been Japan's first producer of incandescent electric lamps. It later diversified into the manufacture of other consumer products and in 1899 had been renamed Tokyo Denki. The merger of Shibaura and Tokyo Denki created a new company called Tokyo Shibaura Denki (Tokyo Shibaura Electric) ([tpl]lang|ja-Hani|東京芝浦電気[/tpl]). It was soon nicknamed Toshiba, but it was not until 1978 that the company was officially renamed Toshiba Corporation.
The group expanded rapidly, driven by a combination of organic growth and by acquisitions, buying heavy engineering and primary industry firms in the 1940s and 1950s. Groups created include Toshiba Music Industries/Toshiba EMI (1960), Toshiba International Corporation (1970s) Toshiba Electrical Equipment (1974), Toshiba Chemical (1974), Toshiba Lighting and Technology (1989), Toshiba America Information Systems (1989) and Toshiba Carrier Corporation (1999).
Toshiba is responsible for a number of Japanese firsts, including radar (1942), the TAC digital computer (1954), transistor television and microwave oven (1959), color video phone (1971), Japanese word processor (1978), MRI system (1982), laptop personal computer (1986), NAND EEPROM (1991), DVD (1995), the Libretto sub-notebook personal computer (1996) and HD DVD (2005).
In 1977, Toshiba acquired the Brazilian company Semp (Sociedade Eletromercantil Paulista), subsequently forming Semp Toshiba through the combination of the two companies' South American operations.
In 1987, Tocibai Machine, a subsidiary of Toshiba, was accused of illegally selling CNC milling machines used to produce very quiet submarine propellers to the Soviet Union in violation of the CoCom agreement, an international embargo on certain countries to COMECON countries.  The Toshiba-Kongsberg scandal involved a subsidiary of Toshiba and the Norwegian company Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk.  The incident strained relations between the United States and Japan, and resulted in the arrest and prosecution of two senior executives, as well as the imposition of sanctions on the company by both countries.[tpl]cite news |first=Roderick|last=Seeman|title=Toshiba Case—CoCom - Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Revision|date=April 1987|publisher=The Japan Lawletter|url=http://japanlaw.info/lawletter/april87/fdf.htm|accessdate=Sepotember18, 2007[/tpl] Senator John Heinz of Pennsylvania said "What Toshiba and Kongsberg did was ransom the security of the United States for $517 million."

===2000 to 2010===

In 2001, Toshiba signed a contract with Orion Electric, one of the world's largest OEM consumer video electronic makers and suppliers, to manufacture and supply finished consumer TV and video products for Toshiba to meet the increasing demand for the North American market. The contract ended in 2008, ending 7 years of OEM production with Orion.
In December 2004, Toshiba quietly announced it would discontinue manufacturing traditional in-house cathode ray tube (CRT) televisions. In 2006, Toshiba terminated production of in-house plasma TVs. To ensure its future competitiveness in the flat-panel digital television and display market, Toshiba has made a considerable investment in a new kind of display technology called SED.
Before World War II, Toshiba was a member of the Mitsui Group zaibatsu (family-controlled vertical monopoly).  Today Toshiba is a member of the Mitsui keiretsu (a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings), and still has preferential arrangements with Mitsui Bank and the other members of the keiretsu.  Membership in a keiretsu has traditionally meant loyalty, both corporate and private, to other members of the keiretsu or allied keiretsu.  This loyalty can extend as far as the beer the employees consume, which in Toshiba's case is Asahi.
In July 2005, BNFL confirmed it planned to sell Westinghouse Electric Company, then estimated to be worth $1.8 billion (£1 billion).[tpl]cite news|title=BNFL plans to sell Westinghouse|date=2004-07-01|publisher=BBC News|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4640411.stm|accessdate=2007-06-11[/tpl] The bid attracted interest from several companies including Toshiba, General Electric and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and when the Financial Times reported on January 23, 2006 that Toshiba had won the bid, it valued the company's offer at $5 billion (£2.8 billion). The sale of Westinghouse by the Government of the United Kingdom surprised many industry experts, who questioned the wisdom of selling one of the world's largest producers of nuclear reactors shortly before the market for nuclear power was expected to grow substantially; China, the United States and the United Kingdom are all expected to invest heavily in nuclear power.[tpl]cite news|title=BNFL to sell US power plant arm|date=January 23, 2004|publisher=BBC News|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4638960.stm|accessdate=2007-06-11[/tpl] The acquisition of Westinghouse for $5.4bn was completed on October 17, 2006, with Toshiba obtaining a 77% share, and partners The Shaw Group a 20% share and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. a 3% share.
In late 2007, Toshiba took over from Discover Card as the sponsor of the top-most screen of One Times Square in New York City.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/03/business/worldbusiness/03toshiba.html|title=Back in Times Square, Toshiba Stands Tall|accessdate=November 20, 2011|publisher=The New York Times|date=3 December 2007[/tpl] It displays the iconic 60-second New Year's countdown on its screen, as well as messages, greetings, and advertisements for the company.

'Zero' scores were received in the categories 'Clean energy policy advocacy,' 'Use of recycled plastics in products' and 'Policy and practice on sustainable sourcing of fibres for paper.'
In 2010, Toshiba reported that all of its new LCD TVs comply with the Energy Star standards and 34 models exceed the requirements by 30% or more.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.toshiba.co.jp/dm_env/dme/develop.htm|title=Development of Environmentally Conscious Products: Toshiba Visual Products Company / Toshiba Storage Products Company Environmental Conservation Activities|publisher=Toshiba |accessdate=August 17, 2010[/tpl]
Toshiba also partnered with China’s Tsinghua University in 2008 in order to form a research facility to focus on energy conservation and the environment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.japancorp.net/Article.Asp?Art_ID=17699|title=Japan’s Corporate Network|date=April 14, 2008|accessdate=April 27, 2008[/tpl] The new Toshiba Energy and Environment Research Center is located in Beijing where forty students from the university will work to research electric power equipment and new technologies that will help stop the global warming process. Through this partnership, Toshiba hopes to develop products that will better protect the environment and save energy in China. This contract between Tsinghua University and Toshiba originally began in October 2007 when they signed an agreement on joint energy and environment research. The projects that they conduct work to reduce car pollution and to create power systems that don’t negatively affect the environment.
On December 28, 1970 Toshiba began the construction of unit 3 of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant[ref][tpl]cite web|url= http://www.nuctrans.org/Nuc_Trans/locations/daiichi/daiichi.htm|title=Nuclear Reactor Maps: Fukushima-Daiichi|accessdate=March 21, 2011|publisher=Nuclear Transparency in the Asia Pacific[/tpl]
