James Hardy Wilkinson FRS (27 September 1919 â€“ 5 October 1986) was a prominent figure in the field of numerical analysis, a field at the boundary of applied mathematics and computer science particularly useful to physics and engineering.[tpl]MacTutor Biography|id=Wilkinson[/tpl][tpl]ACMPortal|id=81341498480[/tpl][tpl]DBLP|id=Wilkinson:James_Hardy[/tpl]

==Education==

Born in Strood, England, he attended the Sir Joseph Williamson's Mathematical School in Rochester. He studied the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated as Senior Wrangler."Easily at the top of the First Class", from the MacTutor biography.

==Career==

Taking up war work in 1940, he began working on ballistics but transferred to the National Physical Laboratory in 1946, where he worked with Alan Turing on the ACE[tpl]cite book |first=James H. |last=Wilkinson |chapter=Turing's Work at the National Physical Laboratory and the Construction of Pilot ACE, DEUCE and ACE |chapterurl= |editor1-first=Nicholas |editor1-last=Metropolis |editor2-first=J. |editor2-last=Howlett |editor3-first=Gian-Carlo |editor3-last=Rota |title=A History of Computing in the Twentieth Century |publisher=Academic Press |year=1980 |isbn=0124916503 [/tpl] computer project. Later, Wilkinson's interests took him into the numerical analysis field, where he discovered many significant algorithms.

==Awards and honours==

Wilkinson received the Turing Award in 1970 "for his research in numerical analysis to facilitate the use of the high-speed digital computer, having received special recognition for his work in computations in linear algebra and 'backward' error analysis."  In the same year, he also gave the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) John von Neumann Lecture.
The J. H. Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software is named in his honour.

==Personal life==

Wilkinson married Heather Ware in 1945. She and their son survived him, a daughter having predeceased him.
