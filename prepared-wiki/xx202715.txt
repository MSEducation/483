The Soviet Story is a 2008 documentary film about Soviet Communism and Soviet–German collaboration before 1941 written and directed by Edvīns Šnore and sponsored by the UEN Group in the European Parliament.
The film features interviews with western and Russian historians such as Norman Davies and Boris Sokolov, Russian writer Viktor Suvorov, Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky, members of the European Parliament and the participants, as well as the victims of Soviet terror.
Using these interviews together with historical footage and documents the film argues that there were close philosophical, political and organizational connections between the Nazi and Soviet systems before and during the early stages of World War II.[tpl]cite news |title=Telling the Soviet story |url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11401983  |work=The Economist |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2008-06-03 [/tpl] It highlights the Great Purge as well as the Great Famine, Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Katyn massacre, Gestapo-NKVD collaboration, Soviet mass deportations and medical experiments in the GULAG. The documentary goes on to argue that the successor states to Nazi Germany and the USSR differ in the sense that postwar Germany condemns the actions of Nazi Germany while the opinion in contemporary Russia is summarized by the quote of Vladimir Putin: "One needs to acknowledge, that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century".

==Reception==

The film has attracted praise and criticism from academic historians[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] and political commentators.
The Economist review of The Soviet Story praises the film by saying [tpl]quote|"Soviet Story" is the most powerful antidote yet to the sanitisation of the past. The film is gripping, audacious and uncompromising. ... The main aim of the film is to show the close connections—philosophical, political and organisational—between the Nazi and Soviet systems.[/tpl]
It concludes its review by calling the documentary "a sharply provocative work".
The New York Times in its review of the documentary stated [tpl]quote|The film is not dispassionate scholarship; Mr. Snore, who is Latvian, and his backers (including some members of the European Parliament) obviously have an agenda, though to the casual American viewer it may not be clear what it is.[tpl]cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/movies/24sovi.html|title=Atrocities Magnified|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|date=24 October 2008|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-09-07[/tpl][/tpl]

According to the Latvian MEPs Inese Vaidere and Ģirts Valdis Kristovskis writing in Parliament Magazine:
[tpl]quote|The Soviet Story makes a significant contribution to the establishment of a common understanding of history and brings us closer to the truth about the tragic events of the 20th century.

British MEP Christopher Beazley commented:
[tpl]quote|This film is very important.

Vytautas Landsbergis, MEP and the former Head of the Lithuanian Seimas (Parliament), assessed The Soviet Story as
[tpl]quote|a world class film, which should be shown to the world[tpl]cite news |first=Egils |last=Līcītis |title=Edvīns Šnore sakārto pagātni |url=http://www.delfi.lv/news/comment/comment/article.php?id=20873643 |work=Latvijas Avīze |date=2008-05-03 |language=Latvian [/tpl][/tpl]
Likewise, Latvia's Minister of Justice, Gaidis Bērziņš (For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK), has said that, because of its important historical message, he would encourage the Ministry of Education to have the film shown in all schools in Latvia.[tpl]cite news |title=Tieslietu ministrs: filma "Padomju stāsts" jārāda visās skolās |url=http://forums.apollo.lv/portal/news/articles/127043 |publisher=apollo.lv |date=2008-05-08 |language=Latvian |accessdate=2008-06-12 [/tpl]
MEP from Latvia Tatjana Ždanoka, who opposed Latvia's independence from the Soviet Union and ran as a candidate of the largest Russian political bloc in Latvia,Jamestown Foundation 23 May 2004: Zhdanoka Candidacy Polarizes Latvian Election by Vladimir Socor regards the film as a "propagandistic odd job, which is given out to be "a new word in history".[tpl]cite news |title=Жданок: фильм "The Soviet Story" — пропагандистская поделка (Ždanoka: film "The Soviet Story" - propagandistic odd job) |url=http://rus.delfi.lv/news/daily/politics/article.php?id=20714429 |publisher=Delfi.lv |date=2008-04-11 |language=Russian |accessdate=2008-06-09 [/tpl] She also thought that "the second part of the film is pure political PR": while the first part of the film pictures the point of view of some historians, contemporary politicians criticize modern Russia in the end of the film. Ždanoka also noted that "a lot of attention was devoted to the partnership of the German and Russian military. This is followed by a jump forward in time to the 1940s, with a mass-meeting of Vlasovites is shown against a background of swastika".
The film prompted negative reactions from Russian organizations, press, and politicians. According to the "European Voice" newspaper, Russians are infuriated by the film which reveals the extent of Nazi and Soviet collaboration.[tpl]cite news |title=Telling the unofficial, but true, Soviet story |url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/telling-the-unofficial-but-true-soviet-story/60941.aspx  |work=European Voice |date=2008-05-29 [/tpl]

Latvian political scientist and cultural commentator Ivars Ījabs offers a mixed review of The Soviet Story. On one hand, it is a well-made and "effective piece of cinematic propaganda in the good sense of this word", whose message is clearly presented to the audience. On the other hand, Ījabs does not agree with a number of historical interpretations in the film, asserting that it contains errors. For example, Ījabs states that, "In late 1930s Hitler did not yet plan a systematic genocide against the Jews", as it is suggested in the film; "Everybody knows that this decision was made in 1942 at the Wannsee Conference in Berlin." Furthermore, Ījabs comments on the notion in the film voiced by the British literary historian, liberal and former political activist George Watson that Friedrich Engels is "the ancestor of the modern political genocide".minute 16:37 Film "The Soviet Story" Ījabs says: "To present Karl Marx as the "progenitor of modern genocide is simply to lie". Ījabs admits, however, the use of the term Völkerabfälle in Marx's newspaper to describe several small European ethnic groups.[tpl]cite news |last=Ījabs |first=Ivars |date=2008-05-23 |title=Cienīga atbilde: Soviet Story |work=Latvijas Vēstnesis |language=Latvian |url=http://www.lv.lv/?menu=exblogi&sub=&type=full&id=44 |accessdate=2008-06-15 [/tpl] Although sometimes translated as "racial trash", other translations include "residual nations" or "refuse of nations", that is, those left behind (discarded) by the dominant civilizations. Watson views have been also criticized by reviewer Robert Grant as ideologically biased and for citing evidence that "seems dubious", arguing that "what Marx and Engels are calling for is ... at the very least a kind of cultural genocide; but it is not obvious, at least from Watson's citations, that actual mass killing, rather than (to use their phraseology) mere 'absorption' or 'assimilation', is in question."[tpl]cite journal| first=Robert |last=Grant |title=Review: The Lost Literature of Socialism |journal=The Review of English Studies | publisher=New Series |volume=50 |issue=200 |date=Nov 1999 |pages=557–559 [/tpl]

==Criticism==

Alexander Dyukov, a former member of the Russian ARMS-TASS Agency of Military and Technical Information, has been the most vocal critic of the documentary. He said that "After watching two thirds of the film, I had only one wish: to kill its director and to burn down the Latvian Embassy."[tpl]cite web|url=http://novchronic.ru/1393.htm |title=a_dyukov. The Soviet Story: первый просмотр - Новые Хроники |publisher=Novchronic.ru |accessdate=2009-12-30[/tpl]
As a result of Dyukov's statements a criminal investigation was initiated against him in Latvia.Полиция Латвии проверяет заявление о задержании российского историка // RIA Novosti, 2008-08-20
Asked to comment on the case, Latvian Foreign Minister Māris Riekstiņš commented that Alexander Dyukov might be a "mentally unstable personality".Глава МИДа: российский историк — психически неуравновешен mixnews.lv, 10.06.2008 Prime Minister of Estonia Mart Laar called Dyukov "an officer of FSB".[tpl]cite web|author=Ваше имя |url=http://www.baltinfo.ru/news/V-podtverzhdenie-teorii-okkupatcii-v-Estonii-snyali-film-na-angliiskom-yazyke-101070 |title=В подтверждение "теории оккупации" в Эстонии сняли фильм на английском языке |publisher=Baltinfo.ru |accessdate=2009-12-30[/tpl]
Alexander Dyukov expressed his opinion that the film is a propaganda piece which makes false claims and uses distorted quotes and statistics.Dyukov (2008), pp. 109 Dyukov later published a book "The Soviet Story: The Mechanism of lies", which made a detailed critical analysis of the alleged falsifications contained in the film".

Dyukov also criticized the film for showing a famous photo which was widely published in Europe by the Nansen committee in 1922 and which bears the name "Brothers in misfortune" ([tpl]lang-ru|Братья по несчастью[/tpl]). The photo which shows a starving boy feeding another starving boy was taken during famine in Russia in 1922, however in The Soviet Story, according to Dyukov, the boys are presented as victims of the famine in Ukraine.Dyukov (2008), pp.31-33
Irina Yarovaya, Russian MP, member of the General Council of Vladimir Putin's and ruling Russian party “United Russia”, declared that The Soviet Story film “glorifies Estonian Nazi collaborators, those who killed people in Khatyn and in Pskov region”.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.edinros.ru/text.shtml?6/8797 |title=Yarovaya: Neo-fascists in Europe fuel ethic hatred |publisher=Official site of Party United Russia|date= [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gpclub.ru/news/0x24x48x1776_p.html |title=Irina Yarovaya: Seminar in Helsinki was directed towards restoration of Nazism and Fascism|publisher=Государственно-патриотический клуб |date= [/tpl]
In response to Yarovaya's statement which apparently confuses Katyn with Khatyn, Mart Laar wrote: "It is indeed impressive how much wrong can be put into one sentence. First, Estonians did not kill anyone in Khatyn and, secondly, the specific crime committed in Khatyn is not mentioned in the film at all... This gives the impression that Yarovaya, actually, has not seen the film."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.postimees.ee/?id=94499 |title=Laar tunnustas Imbi Paju ja Sofi Oksaneni algatust |publisher=Postimees |date= [/tpl]

The Soviet Story also reflects a point of view which is not shared by the Kremlin. As a result, the film is labeled as Fascist propaganda, even if the film describes Hitler and Nazism as criminal."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.prokarelia.net/en/?x=artikkeli&article_id=1781&author=109 |title=The Soviet Story and Its Critics |publisher=ProKarelia |date= [/tpl]
Russian government's state news agency RIA Novosti claimed: "The film shows the alleged victims of Stalinist repression: the corpses piled in stacks and covered with logs. In fact these photographs were taken by the Soviets in 1944 and represent the victims of the Nazi atrocities in Klooga concentration camp in Estonia and in Yanovskaya camp near Lviv."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rian.ru/society/20090830/182971694.html |title=Эстонское телевидение покажет документальный фильм The Soviet Story |publisher=РИА Новости |date= [/tpl] This accusation was reproduced by such news outlets as Vzglyad[tpl]cite web |url=http://photo.vz.ru/news/2009/8/30/322584.html |title=Фильм-фальсификацию о СССР покажут в Эстонии |publisher=ВЗГЛЯД |date= [/tpl]
