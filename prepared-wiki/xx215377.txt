U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps blasted a new world record of 1:52.03 to defend his title in the event, and more importantly, claim his fourth Olympic gold, tenth career, and twelfth overall medal. During the final, Phelps' goggles filled with water, which prevented him from seeing anything, while he was finishing the second lap.[tpl]cite news|first=Larry|last=Siddons|title=Water-Filled Goggles Can't Keep Phelps From Gold Mark|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601079&sid=ac18scOpOC4E&refer=home|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=13 August 2008|accessdate=17 May 2013[/tpl]
