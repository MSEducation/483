==History==

===Formation and early years===

Accenture began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm Arthur Andersen. The division's origins are in a 1953 feasibility study for General Electric. GE asked Arthur Andersen to automate payroll processing and manufacturing at GE's Appliance Park facility near Louisville, Kentucky. Arthur Andersen recommended installation of a UNIVAC I computer and printer, which resulted in the first commercially-owned computer installation in the United States in 1954. Joe Glickauf, an early pioneer of computer consulting,[tpl]cite web|title=Obituary: Joseph Glickauf Jr. 1912-2005 Computer-consulting pioneer|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-07-28/news/0507280218_1_arthur-andersen-electronic-computer-ham-radio-operator|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=30 August 2013|author=Manya A. Brachear|date=28 July 2005[/tpl] held a position as head of Arthur Andersen's administrative services division for 12 years.

===Splitting from Arthur Andersen===

In 1989, Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting became separate units of Andersen Worldwide Société Coopérative (AWSC).  Arthur Andersen increased its use of accounting services as a springboard to sign up clients for Andersen Consulting's more lucrative business.
Throughout the 1990s, there was increasing tension between Andersen Consulting and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting was upset that it was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a condition of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC – paid the other this sum), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting claimed breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2 billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture.[tpl]cite news |last=Martin |first=Mitchell |date=August 8, 2000 |title=Arbitrator's Ruling Goes Against Accounting Arm : Consultants Win Battle Of Andersen |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/08/business/worldbusiness/08iht-consult.2.t.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York City |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=March 1, 2014[/tpl]
Accounts vary on why the split occurred. Executives on both sides of the split cite greed and arrogance on the part of the other, and executives on the Andersen Consulting side maintained breach of contract when Arthur Andersen created AABC, because AABC competed directly with Andersen Consulting in the marketplace. Many of the AABC firms were bought out by other consulting companies in 2002, including Hitachi Consulting and KPMG Consulting, which later changed its name to BearingPoint.
Andersen Consulting's change of name was fortunate, as it avoided damage to its reputation later, when Arthur Andersen was effectively dissolved as a result of its role in the Enron scandal.

===Emergence of Accenture===

On January 1, 2001 Andersen Consulting adopted its current name, "Accenture". The word "Accenture" is supposedly derived from "Accent on the future". The name "Accenture" was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company's Oslo, Norway office, as a result of an internal competition. Accenture felt that the name should represent its will to be a global consulting leader and high performer, and also intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates.Andersen Consulting Changing Name To Accenture – Oct. 26, 2000; InformationWeek

===Initial public offering===

On July 19, 2001, Accenture offered initial public offering (IPO) at the price of $14.50 per share in New York Stock Exchange (NYSE); Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley served as its lead underwriters. Accenture stock closed the day at $15.17, with the day's high at $15.25. On the first day of the IPO, Accenture raised nearly $1.7 billion.Accenture IPO gains in first trades – Jul. 19, 2001; CNN Money

===Bermuda headquarters===

In October 2002, the Congressional General Accounting Office (GAO) identified Accenture as one of four publicly traded federal contractors that were incorporated in a tax haven country.Information on Federal Contractors That Are Incorporated Offshore; United States General Accounting Office; October 1, 2002 The other three, unlike Accenture, were incorporated in the United States before they re-incorporated in a tax haven country, thereby lowering their U.S. taxes. Critics, most notably former CNN journalist Lou Dobbs,[tpl]cite news|last=Dobbs|first=Lou|title=Exporting America|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/03/09/commentary/dobbs/dobbs/index.htm|accessdate=May 3, 2011|publisher=CNN|date=March 9, 2004[/tpl] have reported   Accenture's decision to incorporate in Bermuda as a U.S. tax avoidance ploy, because they viewed Accenture as having been a U.S.-based company.http://www.house.gov/delauro/press/2004/accenture_06_01_04.html[tpl]Dead link|date=October 2009[/tpl] The GAO itself did not characterize Accenture as having been a U.S.-based company; it stated that "prior to incorporating in Bermuda, Accenture was operating as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of its partners through the mechanism of contracts with a Swiss coordinating entity."

===Ireland headquarters===

Accenture announced on May 26, 2009 that its Board of Directors unanimously approved changing the company’s place of incorporation to Ireland from Bermuda and would become Accenture plc.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsroom.accenture.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=4830 |title=Accenture Newsroom: Accenture Announces Proposed Change of Incorporation to Ireland |publisher=newsroom.accenture.com |date=May 26, 2009 |accessdate=August 6, 2010[/tpl]
The company cited several reasons for the change:
The change became effective on September 1, 2009, the beginning of the company's 2010 fiscal year.
While Ireland is the company's headquarters for tax and legal purposes, much of the operational administration occurs in the United States, mainly New York City and Chicago.

==Operations==

thumb|A worldmap showing the 54 countries where Accenture has operations as of 2012 (coloured in blue) Accenture organizes its services and people in these three primary cross-functional groupings. Accenture client engagement teams typically consist of a combination of industry experts, capability specialists and professionals with local market knowledge.

===Workforces===

The four workforces serve clients in the areas of consulting, technology, and outsourcing, as well as the company itself. This is almost always an internal designation as it is common place for Accenture employees to work in blended teams for a variety of reasons.

===Operating Groups===

As most consulting firms, Accenture operates in a matrix structure. The first axis is dedicated to the operating groups, or industries of its clients. Broadly, the five Operating Groups are:
