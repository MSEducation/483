The Bullfighter Checks Her Makeup is a collection of essays by Susan Orlean published in 2001 by Random House. Kirkus Reviews wrote "some essays work better than others, but in general the collection is marred only by a few too many run-on sentences and the occasional quick ending, giving the impression that the author was writing to hit a certain word-count".Kirkus Reviews, 11/1/2001.
