 </ref> They set up educational centers in [[Preslav Literary School|Pliska]] and in [[Ohrid Literary School|Ohrid]] to further the development of Slavonic letters and [[liturgy]]. Clement later tranined thousands of Slavonic-speaking priests who replaced the Greek-speaking clergy from Constantinople still present in the Bulgar kingdom. The alphabet that was originally developed by Cyril and Methodius is known as the [[Glagolitic alphabet]]. 
In Bulgaria, Clement of Ohrid and Naum of Preslav however created (or rather compiled) a new alphabet which was called Cyrillic and was declared the official alphabet. The Slavic language also was declared as official in 893. In the following centuries this alphabet was adopted by other Slavic peoples. The introduction of Slavic liturgy paralleled Boris' continued development of churches and monasteries throughout his realm.

===Reactions to religious conversion===

Conversion to Christianity met great opposition among the Bulgars. Some refused to become Christians while others apostasized after baptism and started a rebellion against Boris for forcing them to be baptized. Some Bulgars did not object necessarily the Christian religion but to the fact that it was brought by foreign priests, which, as a result, established external foreign policy. 
In the summer of 865 a group of aristocrats (boyars) started an open revolt. Boris ruthlessly suppressed it and executed 52 boyars together with their entire families.http://promacedonia.org/vz1b/vz1b_3_2.html Thus the Christianization continued.

==The End of Boris' Reign==

In 889 Boris abdicated the throne and became a monk. His son and successor Vladimir attempted a pagan reaction, which brought Boris out of retirement in 893. Vladimir was defeated and Boris had him blinded, his wife shaved and sent to a monastery. Boris gathered the Council of Preslav placing his third son, Tsar Simeon I of Bulgaria on the throne, threatening him with the same fate if he too apostatized. Boris returned to his monastery, emerging once again in c. 895 to help Simeon fight the Magyars, who had invaded Bulgaria in alliance with the Byzantines. After the passing of this crisis, Boris resumed monastic life and died in 907. The location of his retreat, where perhaps he was interred, is not certain; it may be near Preslav but also in Pliska or in a monastery near Varna or Ravda.

==Legacy==

St. Boris Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named for Boris I of Bulgaria.
Boris I's life is featured in the 1985 film "Boris I" (Борис Първи), with Stefan Danailov in the title role.
