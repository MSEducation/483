==Applications==

===Existing magnet applications===

Neodymium magnets have replaced alnico and ferrite magnets in many of the myriad applications in modern technology where strong permanent magnets are required, because their greater strength allows the use of smaller, lighter magnets for a given application. Some examples are:

Neodymium content is estimated to be 31% of magnet weight.

===New applications===

In addition, the greater strength of neodymium magnets has inspired new applications in areas where magnets were not used before, such as magnetic jewelry clasps, children's magnetic building sets (and other neodymium magnet toys) and as part of the closing mechanism of modern sport parachute equipment.United Parachute Technologies Options Guide: http://www.unitedparachutetechnologies.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=22 They also are the main metal in the formerly popular desk-toy magnets, "Buckyballs", though some retailers have chosen not to sell them due to child-safety concerns.http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/story/2012-07-25/buckyballs-ban/56481316/1
The strength and magnetic field homogeneity on neodymium magnets has also opened new applications in the medical field with the introduction of open magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners used to image the body in radiology departments as an alternative to superconducting magnets that use a coil of superconducting wire to produce the magnetic field.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Neodymium magnets are used in the surgically placed Linx anti-reflux system.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
