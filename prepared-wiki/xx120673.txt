Cori is a town and comune in the province of Latina, in the Lazio region of central Italy.

==History==

Cori was well developed in the age of the expansion of Rome (7th-6th century BC). It became a Roman possession after the Social War (90-88 BC), maintaining some administrative and political autonomy. 
In the Middle Ages Cori, which suffered a steep decadence in the early centuries of that age, was often allied with its neighbour Velletri. It was a possession of the Annibaldi until 1234, when it went back to the Papal suzerainty, under which (apart a short period under Ladislaus of Naples in 1400-1410) remained until the unification of Italy.
It is part of the province of Latina since 1934.
