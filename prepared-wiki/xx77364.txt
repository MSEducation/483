==Career==

Bel Geddes began his career with set designs for Aline Barnsdall's Los Angeles Little Theater in the 1916-17 season, then in 1918 as the scene designer for the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He designed and directed various theatrical works,[tpl]cite book|first=Bernhard Russell|last=Works|title= Norman Bel Geddes: Man of Ideas|location=Madison, WI|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1966|isbn=|type=Thesis|oclc=3116381[/tpl] from Arabesque and The Five O'Clock Girl on Broadway to an ice show, It Happened on Ice, produced by Sonja Henie. He also created set designs for the film Feet of Clay (1924), directed by Cecil B. DeMille, designed costumes for Max Reinhardt, and created the sets for the Broadway production of Sidney Kingsley's Dead End (1935). [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
Bel Geddes opened an industrial-design studio in 1927, and designed a wide range of commercial products, from cocktail shakers to commemorative medallions to radio cabinets. His designs extended to unrealized futuristic concepts: a teardrop-shaped automobile, and an Art Deco House of Tomorrow.[tpl]cite book|first=Adrian|last=Tinniswood|authorlink=Adrian Tinniswood|title=The Art Deco House|location=New York|publisher=Watson-Guptill|year=2002|page=20|isbn=9780823003150[/tpl] In 1929, he designed "Airliner Number 4," a 9-deck amphibian airliner that incorporated areas for deck-games, an orchestra, a gymnasium, a solarium, and two airplane hangars.[tpl]cite web|first=Ian|last=Stephens|date=March 29, 2009|title=Huge Aviation of the 1930s: The K-7 and The Bel Geddes #4|url=http://flyawaysimulation.com/article3322.html|work=Fly Away Simulation|accessdate=October 21, 2012[/tpl]
His book, Horizons (1932) had a significant impact: "By popularizing streamlining when only a few engineers were considering its functional use, he made possible the design style of the thirties."[tpl]cite book|first=Jeffrey L.|last=Meikle|title=Twentieth Century Limited: Industrial Design in America, 1925–1939|location=Philadelphia|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2001|page=48|isbn=9781566398923|edition=2nd[/tpl] He wrote forward-looking articles for popular American periodicals.[tpl]cite journal|first=Norman|last=Bel Geddes|title=Streamlining|journal=Atlantic Monthly|date=November 1934|pages=553–558[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|first=Norman|last=Bel Geddes|title=Ten Years From Now|journal=The Ladies' Home Journal|date=January 1931|page=190[/tpl]
Bel Geddes designed the General Motors Pavilion, known as Futurama, for the 1939 New York World's Fair. For that famous and enormously influential installation, Bel Geddes exploited his earlier work in the same vein: he had designed a "Metropolis City of 1960" in 1936.[tpl]cite book|first=Peter M.|last=Wolf|title=The Future of the City: New Directions in Urban Planning|location=New York|publisher=Watson-Guptill|year=1974|page=28|isbn=9780823071821[/tpl]
Bel Geddes's book Magic Motorways (1940) promoted advances in highway design and transportation, foreshadowing the Interstate Highway System ("there should be no more reason for a motorist who is passing through a city to slow down than there is for an airplane which is passing over it").
The case for the Mark I computer was designed by Norman Bel Geddes. IBM's Thomas Watson presented it to Harvard. At the time, some saw it as a waste of resources, since computing power was in high demand during this part of World War II and those funds could have been used to build additional equipment.
Bel Geddes died on May 8, 1958 in New York, New York. His autobiography, Miracle in the Evening, was published posthumously in 1960.[tpl]cite book|last=Yannacc|first=Christin Essin Yannacc|title=Landscapes of American Modernity: A Cultural History of Theatrical Design, 1912--1951|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|page=128|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3xj9bTnP19QC&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=Norman+Bel+Geddes+autobiography,+%27%27Miracle+in+the+Evening%27%27,+was+published+posthumously+in+1960&source=bl&ots=bOXQxnObaz&sig=r4NDHWFELq9j7yIjA1-BfBRFnlk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-toMU5uaM7OqyQHYroHoDQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Norman%20Bel%20Geddes%20autobiography%2C%20Miracle%20in%20the%20Evening%2C%20was%20published%20posthumously%20in%201960&f=false[/tpl]
