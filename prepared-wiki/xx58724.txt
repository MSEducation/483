A protest (also called a remonstrance or a remonstration) is an expression of objection by words or by actions to particular events, policies, or situations. Protests can take many different forms; from individual statements to mass demonstrations. Protesters may organize a protest as a way of publicly making their opinions heard in an attempt to influence public opinion or government policy, or they may undertake direct action in an attempt to directly enact desired changes themselves.St. John Barned-Smith, "How We Rage: This Is Not Your Parents' Protest," Current (Winter 2007): 17-25. Where protests are part of a systematic and peaceful campaign to achieve a particular objective, and involve the use of pressure as well as persuasion, they go beyond mere protest and may be better described as cases of civil resistance or nonviolent resistance.Adam Roberts, Introduction, in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present, Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 2-3, where a more comprehensive definition of "civil resistance" may be found.
Various forms of self-expression and protest are sometimes restricted[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Controlling+public+protest%3a+First+Amendment+implications.-a016473804 | title = Controlling Public Protest: First Amendment Implications | accessdate = 2009-12-16 | author = Daniel L.

When such restrictions occur, protests may assume the form of open civil disobedience, more subtle forms of resistance against the restrictions, or may spill over into other areas such as culture and emigration.
A protest can itself sometimes be the subject of a counter-protest. In such a case, counter-protesters demonstrate their support for the person, policy, action, etc. that is the subject of the original protest.

==Historical notions==

Unaddressed protests may grow and widen into civil resistance, dissent, activism, riots, insurgency, revolts, and political and/or social revolution. Some examples of protests include:

==Forms of protest==

Commonly recognized forms of protest include:

===Public demonstration or political rally===

Some forms of direct action listed in this article are also public demonstrations or rallies.

===Written demonstration===

Written evidence of political or economic power, or democratic justification may also be a way of protesting.

===Civil disobedience demonstrations===

Any protest could be civil disobedience if a “ruling authority” says so, but the following are usually civil disobedience demonstrations:

===As a residence===

===Destructive===

===Direct action===

===Protesting a government===

===Protesting a military shipment===

===By government employees===

===Job action===

===In sports===

During a sporting event, under certain circumstances, one side may choose to play a game "under protest", usually when they feel the rules are not being correctly applied. The event continues as normal, and the events causing the protest are reviewed after the fact. If the protest is held to be valid, then the results of the event are changed. Each sport has different rules for protests.

===By management===

===By tenants===

===By consumers===

===Information===

===Civil disobedience to censorship===

===By Internet and social networking===

Protests can express views, news and use viral networking to reach out to thousands of people.

===Literature, art, culture===

===Protests against religious or ideological institutions===

==Economic effects of protests against companies==

A study of 342 US protests covered by the New York Times newspaper in the period 1962 and 1990 showed that such public activities usually had an impact on the company's publicly traded stock price. The most intriguing aspect of the study's findings is that what mattered most was not the number of protest participants, but the amount of media coverage the event received. Stock prices fell an average of one-tenth of a percent for every paragraph printed about the event.Deseret Morning News, 13 Nov. 2007 issue, p.
