T. Davis (first name, birth and death details unknown) refers to a noted amateur cricketer in the 18th century who made seven known appearances for Hampshire county cricket teams between 1773 and 1776 in the era of the Hambledon Club.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/79/79336/79336.html |title=CricketArchive record of T Davis |work=cricketarchive.co.uk |accessdate=September 10, 2012[/tpl]  The full span of his career is uncertain because he was almost certainly active before cricket's statistical record began in 1772.  He was probably an early member of the Hambledon Club, believed to have been founded about 1765, but little is known of him apart from what can be gleaned from surviving scorecards.
Davis was primarily a batsman who scored a known total of 115 runs in 11 innings with a highest score of 40.  He has not been credited with any wickets.  He took just 2 catches, which suggests he may have been an outfielder.
