Monmouth Town F.C. is a Welsh football club based in the historic town of Monmouth. The team currently play in the Welsh Football League Division One. The club is a member of Gwent County F.A.  On 8 August 2011, Monmouth Town F.C. entered into an agreement to be purchased by internet venture fivepoundfootballclub.com.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-14448234 |title=Monmouth FC chosen for web fans' investment plan. |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=4 January 2012 [/tpl] In September 2011 the Club established itself as a Community Interest Company, the first of its kind in Wales. The club's rally cry is "Kingfishers All The Way!"  
The Monmouthshire Beacon reports in 7 October 1876 that Monmouth Town FC will commence its season on 12 October. There is evidence to suggest that an ’association club’ was playing in all white at Dixton Road in the town in the year 1906. The Monmouth Beacon of 14 December recalls this and adds a comment about a period when football had been extinct in Monmouth.  Indeed research shows that Monmouth were joint champions of the Monmouth and District League in 1925/26 with Clearwell FC.
The next honour recorded by the Town was victory on the Monmouthshire Senior cup on the eve of war in 1940, defeating Lovell’s Athletic, (aka the Toffeemen) then about to lift the Southern League West title, 3-2 at Monmouth Sportsground which is still home today.
Nearly 20 years later, in 1958, the Town lifted the Monmouthshire Amateur cup beating Cefn Fforest 3 – 0 at Pontllanfraith. The following season saw victories in both the Monmouthshire senior and Monmouth Amateur cups.
Town's only appearance in the FA Cup was a 2nd preliminary round defeat away at Llanelli on 6 October 1945.
Silverware has been scarce since with wins in the Gwent amateur cup in 1984 and 1996 being highlights of many years gracing the fields of Newport and the Gwent Leagues with an occasional foray into the English Forest of Dean and Herefordshire leagues.
More recently the Town were relegated to the bottom tier of the Gwent County just three years ago. The returning Andrew Smith took up the reins and gained promotion in his first season in charge finishing runners up to Rogerstone. At the beginning of 2005/06 season the club adopted ‘the Kingfishers’ nickname and logo in homage to a peculiar legend outlined later.
The season ended with fourteen match winning run as Town clinched the Gwent County Division Two title ahead of Newport Civil Service.
2006/07 almost saw a repeat but were Town were pipped by Civil for the title. However, The Kingfishers were offered the chance to take the step into the Welsh league for the first time in their history.
The Kingfishers won the Division Three title in 2010/11 and followed it with The Division Two title in 2011/12, Dan MacDonald scoring a remarkable 44 goals.
Their first ever season in Division One ended with a seventh place finish after topping the table as late as March. The Kingfishers were also finalists in the Gwent Senior Cup for the first time since 1940 but lost out 1 - 0 to Caldicot Town.  

==Colours and crest==

The main colours for Monmouth Town F.C. are yellow and blue, which have been used throughout their recent history.
The Monmouth Town F.C. crest is a large yellow crest with a blue circle and text. The top of the circle has the name of the club in English, "Monmouth Town Football Club". Prominently positioned in the middle is a picture of the Kingfisher and the numbers 19 and 30 on either side of the bird. The name of the club in Welsh, "Clwb Pêl-Droed Trefynwy", adorns the bottom of the circle.
The Kingfisher Legend                     
Some local folklore has it that in about 1936 there were extremely bad spring floods on the Monnow and Wye which effectively wiped out all of the Kingfisher nests along the rivers. Until then Monmouth had been a magnet for ornithologists from all over the country to see Britain’s most beautiful bird in all its glory. Official government sources from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Timber recorded their alarm at the plight of the Kingfisher population and a detailed study was carried out to assess the damage. Amazingly the only surviving pair of breeding Kingfishers were found nesting in a deflated football that had floated down the Monnow into the Wye and lodged itself with its laces in some branches overlooking the river. It was in the days before the Magic Marker so it could not be proven that the ball had been lost in a game at the Town’s sportsground but it was deemed the obvious cause. And so ….one loose shot saved the entire Kingfisher population of the Wye and Monnow rivers.
