Choe Deok-geun (also spelled Choi Duck-keun or Choi Duk-gun; born 1951 or 1952; died 1 October 1996 in Vladivostok, Primorsky Krai, Russia) was a South Korean consular official for the Russian Far East who was assassinated by poison in October 1996.[tpl]citation|url=http://news.media.daum.net/politics/administration/200409/21/donga/v7411326.html?nil_rcmd=news|last=Bu|first=Hyeong-gwon|periodical=Donga Ilbo|date=2004-09-21|accessdate=2007-06-01|title=盧-푸틴 정상회담: 한-러 ‘외교 악연’ 이젠 끊길까/Roh-Putin Ministerial Meeting: Stopping the decline of Korea-Russia relations?[/tpl][tpl]citation|url=http://www.dongailbo.co.kr/docs/magazine/news_plus/news64/plus64-12.html|periodical=Donga Ilbo Magazine|date=December 1996|accessdate=2007-06-01|last=Yi|first=Su-hyeong|title=‘최영사 피살’범인은 역시 북한？/North Korea was the criminal in the "Choe Deok-gun murder"?[/tpl] (States that Choi was 44 at the time of his death)

==Assassination==

Though the official cause of Choe's death was listed as bludgeoning, he had two pencil-sized holes on his torso which suggested injection of a foreign substance into his body. When his corpse was discovered, he still had $1,200 cash in his pocket.[tpl]citation|last=Bertil|first=Lintner|title=Blood Brothers: Crime, Business, and Politics in Asia|pages=213–214|publisher=Allen and Unwin|year=2002|isbn=1-86508-419-0[/tpl] It emerged soon after that he had poison in his bloodstream of the same type as that carried by a North Korean submarine which had infiltrated South Korean waters and landed near Gangneung, Gangwon the previous month; North Korea had threatened to retaliate for the killings of their special forces agents by the South Korean army.[tpl]citation|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IBS/is_4_30/ai_n13822276/pg_4|title=North Korean Special Operations Forces: 1996 Kangnung submarine infiltration|last=Dies|first=Harry P., Jr.|periodical=Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin|date=October–December 2004|accessdate=2007-06-01[/tpl] North Korea denied all involvement and accused the South of fabricating evidence in order to frame the North.[tpl]citation|date=1996-10-04|accessdate=2007-06-01|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9610/04/korea.consul/index.html|title=North Korea denies murdering diplomat|periodical=CNN[/tpl] Some news reports at the time suggested that the North Koreans had hired a Russian Mafia hitman to actually carry out the murder.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.sisapress.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=4231|title=최덕근 영사, 러시아 마피아가 살해했다?/Consul Choe Deok-geun, killed by the Russian Mafia?|last=Jeong|first=Hoe-sang|periodical=Sisa Journal|date=1996-10-17|accessdate=2007-06-01[/tpl]

==Aftermath==

As a result of his death, South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade allegedly instructed their personnel to refrain from contacting with or providing assistance to North Koreans in Russia, even refugees, for fear that they too could be murdered.[tpl]citation|title=North Korean refugees in Trouble|periodical=The Chosun Ilbo|date=1999-12-13|accessdate=2007-06-01|url=http://www.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/199912/199912120308.html[/tpl] Some analysts believe that the North Korean government chose to delay announcing their 24 August arrest and detention of American citizen Evan Hunziker until around the time of Choe's murder in an attempt to divert attention.[tpl]citation|last=Efron|first=Sonni|date=1996-10-08|accessdate=2009-06-08|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-10-08/news/mn-51593_1|periodical=Los Angeles Times|title=North's Arrest of American Deepens Freeze in Korea[/tpl]
