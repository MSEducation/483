==Biography==

"Doc Adams", as he was commonly addressed by his colleagues and friends, received his Honorary Doctorate of Engineering from his alma mater, Case School of Applied Science, in 1925 after having been on the faculty at Harvard College and dean of their engineering school for almost 35 years.  He later received his second honorary doctorate from Lehigh University in 1939.  By that time he had retired from Harvard.  In terms of an all-around American engineer in the early 20th century, Comfort A. Adams comes the closest to being America's answer to Britain's I. K. Brunel.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]
