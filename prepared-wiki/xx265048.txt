Atlantic Symphony Orchestra was a professional Canadian symphony orchestra in Atlantic Canada that was active during the second half the 20th century. It has the distinction of being the only full-time regional professional orchestra in Canadian history. The orchestra was formed shortly after the demise of both the Halifax Symphony Orchestra and New Brunswick Symphony Orchesta. Seeing a need for a full-time professional symphony in the Atlantic region, the orchestra was established by joint committees in Halifax, Sydney, Saint John, Moncton, and Fredericton on 12 June 1968. Conductor Klaro Mizerit led the orchestra from 1968â€“1977 and conductor Victor Yampolsky led the orchestra from 1977 until the orchestra's demise due to financial problems in 1983. The orchestra made several commercial recordings in the 1970s and was featured on numerous broadcasts on CBC Radio.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000147|title=Atlantic Symphony Orchestra|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=January 2, 2011|author=Shirley A.
