In his comments to the poem, Asimov wrote that originally it was "Why, stars above, it's Asimov", and when someone suggested to use "mazel tov" instead, Asimov accepted this as a significant improvement. born Isaak Yudovich Ozimov; circa January 2, 1920[tpl]cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |quote=The date of my birth, as I celebrate it, was January 2, 1920.

Asimov was one of the most prolific writers of all time, having written or edited more than 500 books and an estimated 90,000 letters and postcards.[tpl]cite book|last=Asimov|first=Stanley|title=Yours, Isaac Asimov|year=1996|quote=My estimate is that Isaac received about 100,000 letters in his professional career. And with the compulsiveness that has to be a character trait of a writer of almost 500 books, he answered 90 percent of them. He answered more than half with postcards and didn't make carbons of them. But with the 100,000 letters he received, there are carbons of about 45,000 that he wrote.[/tpl] His books have been published in 9 of the 10 major categories of the Dewey Decimal Classification.[tpl]cite web | last = Seiler| first = Edward | last2 = Jenkins |first2 = John H.|url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#others11| title= Isaac Asimov FAQ|publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page | date = June 27, 2008| accessdate =July 2, 2008 [/tpl]
Asimov is widely considered a master of hard science fiction and, along with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, he was considered one of the "Big Three" science fiction writers during his lifetime.[tpl]Cite journal | last = Freedman | first = Carl | author-link = Carl Freedman | title = Critical Theory and Science Fiction |publisher=Doubleday|year=2000 | page = 71 | postscript = [/tpl]  Asimov's most famous work is the Foundation Series;[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.biblio.com/authors/212/Isaac_Asimov_Biography.html |title=Isaac Asimov Biography and List of Works |accessdate=March 5, 2008 |work=Biblio.com [/tpl] his other major series are the Galactic Empire series and the Robot series.  The Galactic Empire novels are explicitly set in earlier history of the same fictional universe as the Foundation series.  Later, beginning with Foundation's Edge, he linked this distant future to the Robot and Spacer stories, creating a unified "future history" for his stories much like those pioneered by Robert A. Heinlein and previously produced by Cordwainer Smith and Poul Anderson.[tpl]cite book |title= I.

The prolific Asimov also wrote mysteries and fantasy, as well as much nonfiction. Most of his popular science books explain scientific concepts in a historical way, going as far back as possible to a time when the science in question was at its simplest stage. He often provides nationalities, birth dates, and death dates for the scientists he mentions, as well as etymologies and pronunciation guides for technical terms. Examples include Guide to Science, the three-volume set Understanding Physics, and Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery, as well as works on astronomy, mathematics, the Bible, William Shakespeare's writing, and chemistry.
Asimov was a long-time member and vice president of Mensa International, albeit reluctantly; he described some members of that organization as "brain-proud and aggressive about their IQs".[ref]
