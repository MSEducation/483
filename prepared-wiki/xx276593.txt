The species is assigned to different genera depending on how the family Thelypteridaceae is classified. If the entire family is classified in Thelypteris, it is Thelypteris torresiana. However, molecular data shows an affinity between a group of species which are sometimes classified in Macrothelypteris, Phegopteris, and allied genera,[tpl]citation | doi = 10.1640/0002-8444(2002)0920131:IROTTF2.0.CO;2 | year = 2002 | volume = 92 | pages = 131 | title = Intrafamilial Relationships of the Thelypteroid Ferns (Thelypteridaceae) | last1 = Smith | first1 = Alan R. | last2 = Cranfill | first2 = Raymond B. | journal = American Fern Journal | issue = 2[/tpl] so it is common to remove this species from Thelypteris and classify it as Macrothelypteris torresiana.
M. torresiana contains flavanoids which have been investigated for possible medicinal value.[tpl]citation | pmid = 21240759 | year = 2011 | last1 = Fang | first1 = W | last2 = Ruan | first2 = J | last3 = Cai | first3 = Y | last4 = Wei | first4 = A | last5 = Zhou | first5 = D | last6 = Zhang | first6 = W | title = Flavonoids from the aerial parts of Macrothelypteris torresiana | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–9 | doi = 10.1080/14786411003766888 | journal = Natural product research [/tpl]
