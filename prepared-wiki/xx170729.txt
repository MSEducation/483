Austria3The group's name is an allusion to the cheap cigarette blend "Austria 3" produced in Austria after World War II and approximately until the end of 1950s. The blend was infamous for its awful taste, but Austrians in their teens at that time are likely to have had an "Austria 3" as their first cigarette.  was a conglomerate of three Austrian quite individualist singer-songwriters Wolfgang Ambros, Georg Danzer and Rainhard Fendrich. 
The group was initiated by Fendrich in order to give one single charity concert in favour of homeless in 1997 (which collected more than ATS 2 million, almost USD 200,000). Their success as a group was overwhelming, and the three individualists showed up on stage as Austria3 from that day on, until they decided to stop that project, which they announced on 10 June 2006. Their last concert was given at Altusried, Germany, on 26 July 2006. 
However, at Georg Danzer's comeback concert in Vienna on 16 April 2007, the three individuals met again just three songs but even "thought in public" about possibly re-uniting in 2008.Danzers Konzert in der Wiener Stadthalle, (Newspaper "Österreich" as of 2006-04-18, PDF; German) and sang a few of their old classics.
Georg Danzer died from lung cancer on 21 June 2007.
