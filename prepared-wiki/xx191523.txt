[[Human-powered hydrofoil]]

CATEGORIES: Human-powered vehicles, Hydrofoils

A human-powered hydrofoil is a small hydrofoil watercraft propelled entirely by the muscle power of its operator(s). Human-powered hydrofoils may be driven by pedals, as in a hydrocycle, by paddles, as in a Flyak, or by bouncing, to use flapping wing propulsion. Hydrofoils are the fastest water-based vehicles propelled solely by human power.  They can reach speeds of up to [tpl]convert|34|km/h|mph kn|abbr=on[/tpl], easily exceeding the world records set by competitive rowing which stand at about [tpl]convert|20|km/h|mph kn|abbr=on[/tpl]. This speed advantage is achieved since hydrofoils lack a submerged body to provide buoyancy, greatly reducing the drag force.

==Flapping wing propulsion==

Flapping wing propulsion devices are hydrofoils that generate propulsion by forcing a foil to move up and down in the water. The forward motion of the foil then generates lift as in other hydrofoils. A common design consists of a large foil at the stern that is used both for propulsion and keeping the passenger above the water, connected to a smaller foil at the bow used for steering and longitudinal stability. Riders operate the vehicle by bouncing up and down on a small platform at the stern, whilst holding onto a steering column. It is started and landed from the shore, or preferably from a dock, and requires a bit of experience. When moving too slowly, it will sink, and the range of possible speeds is [tpl]convert|9|-|30|km/h|mph kn|abbr=on[/tpl]
Several variations on the design have been developed:
