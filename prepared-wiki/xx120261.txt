The government retains considerable influence over key segments of infrastructure sectors, with majority ownership of railway, electricity, aircraft, nuclear power and telecommunications. It has been relaxing its control over these sectors since the early 1990s. The government is slowly corporatising the state sector and selling off holdings in France Télécom, Air France, as well as in the insurance, banking, and defence industries. France has an important aerospace industry led by the European consortium Airbus, and has its own national spaceport, the Centre Spatial Guyanais.
According to the World Trade Organization (WTO), in 2009 France was the world's sixth largest exporter and the fourth largest importer of manufactured goods.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/its2008_e/its2008_e.pdf |title=International Trade Statistics 2008|page=12|year=2009|publisher=World Trade Organization (WTO)|accessdate=5 July 2011[/tpl] In 2008, France was the third largest recipient of foreign direct investment among OECD countries at $118 billion, ranking behind Luxembourg (where foreign direct investment was essentially monetary transfers to banks located there) and the US ($316 billion), but above the UK ($96.9 billion), Germany ($25 billion), or Japan ($24 billion).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unctad.org/sections/dite_dir/docs/wir09_fs_fr_en.pdf|publisher=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)|format=PDF|work=World Investment Report 2009|title=Country fact sheet: France|accessdate=7 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unctad.org/sections/dite_dir/docs/wir09_fs_jp_en.pdf|publisher=UNCTAD|format=PDF|work=World Investment Report 2009|title=Country fact sheet: Japan|accessdate=7 October 2010[/tpl]

===Agriculture===

France has historically been a large producer of agricultural products.France – Agriculture – Encyclopedia of the Nations Large tracts of fertile land, the application of modern technology, and EU subsidies have combined to make France the leading agricultural producer and exporter in Europe[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/france_159/economy_6815/overview-of-the-french-economy_6831/key-figures-of-the-french-economy_1402.html#sommaire_1 |publisher=French Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs|title=Key figures of the French economy|quote=France is the world’s fifth largest exporter of goods (mainly durables).

Wheat, poultry, dairy, beef, and pork, as well as internationally recognized processed foods are the primary French agricultural exports. Rosé wines are primarily consumed within the country, but champagne and Bordeaux wines are major exports, being known worldwide. EU agriculture subsidies to France have decreased in recent years, but still amounted to $8 billion in 2007.[tpl]cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/fin/directaid/2007/annex1_en.pdf|title=Financial year 2007|work=Distribution of direct aid to farmers |format=PDF |publisher=European Commission|date=22 April 2009|accessdate=7 October 2010[/tpl] That same year, France sold 33.4 billion euros of transformed agricultural products.[tpl]fr icon[/tpl] Les enjeux des industries agroalimentaires françaises – Panorama des Industries Agroalimentaires
Agriculture is thus an important sector of France's economy: 3.8% of the active population is employed in agriculture, whereas the total agri-food industry made up 4.2% of French GDP in 2005.

===Labour market===

When "GDP per capita" is converted to U.S. dollars using purchasing power parities, it is the most widely used income measure for international comparisons of living standards. According to the American Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), a 2011 report showed that France's GDP per capita  is similar to the UK, with just over US$35,000 GDP per capita.[tpl]cite web|title=International Comparisons of GDP per Capita, and per Hour, 1960-2011|url=http://www.bls.gov/fls/intl_gdp_capita_gdp_hour.pdf|work=Bureau of Labor Statistics|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=13 April 2014|format=PDF|date=7 November 2012[/tpl] New York Times Op-Ed columnist Paul Krugman used the BLS data to state in January 2011 that "French workers are roughly as productive as US workers", but fewer French people were working in 2011 and "when they work, they work fewer hours". Krugman concluded that the differences were due to the French making "different choices about retirement and leisure."[tpl]cite news|title=GDP Per Capita, Here and There|url=http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/gdp-per-capita-here-and-there/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0|accessdate=13 April 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=28 January 2011|author=Paul Krugman[/tpl]
Keynesian economists sought out different solutions to the unemployment issue in France, and their theories led to the introduction of the 35-hour workweek law in 1999, which eventually failed to reduce the unemployment rate.

French employment rates for 15–64 years is one of the lowest of the OECD countries: in 2012, only 71% of the French population aged 15–64 years were in employment, compared to 74% in Japan, 77% in the UK, 73% in the US and 77% in Germany.[tpl]cite web |author=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |year=2012 |url=http://www.oecd.org/els/emp/employmentoutlookstatisticalannex.htm |title=OECD Employment Outlook 2012 – Statistical Annex |format=PDF |accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl] This gap is due to the low employment rate for 15–24 years old: 38% in 2012, compared to 47% in the OECD.

A December 2012 New York Times article reported on a "floating generation" in France that formed part of the 14 million unemployed young Europeans documented by the Eurofound research agency. In the same article, a senior economist studying unemployment at the OECD estimated that nearly two million young people in France had given up looking for employment at that time, while French labor minister Michel Sapin said that 82 percent of people hired were on temporary contracts. Sapin further explained that the challenge at that time was to create a more flexible system, in which greater trust existed between unions and companies, and “partial unemployment” was accommodated during difficult periods. The floating generation was attributed to a dysfunctional system: "an elitist educational tradition that does not integrate graduates into the work force, a rigid labor market that is hard to enter, and a tax system that makes it expensive for companies to hire full-time employees and both difficult and expensive to lay them off."[tpl]cite news|title=Young, Educated and Jobless in France|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/03/world/europe/young-and-educated-in-france-find-employment-elusive.html?pagewanted=1|accessdate=13 April 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 December 2012|author=Steven Erlanger|author2=Maïa de la Baume|author3=Stefania Rousselle[/tpl] In July 2013, the unemployment rate for France was 11%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&language=en&pcode=teilm020&tableSelection=1&plugin=1 |title=Harmonised unemployment rate by gender – total – % (SA) |publisher=Epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu |date=11 March 2011 |accessdate=21 July 2011[/tpl]
In early April 2014, employers' federations and unions negotiated an agreement with technology and consultancy employers, as employees had been experiencing an extension of their work time through smartphone communication outside of official working hours. Under a new, legally binding labour agreement, around 250,000 employees will avoid handling work-related matters during their leisure time and their employers will, in turn, refrain from engaging with staff during this time.[tpl]cite news|title=When the French clock off at 6pm, they really mean it|url=http://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2014/apr/09/french-6pm-labour-agreement-work-emails-out-of-office?CMP=fb_gu|accessdate=13 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=9 April 2014|author=Lucy Mangan[/tpl]

===Tourism===

With 83 million foreign tourists in 2012, France is ranked as the first tourist destination in the world, ahead of the US (67 million) and China (58 million). This 83 million figure excludes people staying less than 24 hours, such as North Europeans crossing France on their way to Spain or Italy. It is third in income from tourism due to shorter duration of visits.[tpl]Cite news | first=Sarah | last=Dilorenzo | title=France learns to welcome, to speak 'touriste'| url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/france-learns-speak-touriste-0| newspaper=The Burlington Free Press | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages= 5A | date=20 July 2013| accessdate=20 July 2013[/tpl]
France has 37 sites inscribed in UNESCO's World Heritage List and features cities of high cultural interest, beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, and rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity (green tourism). Small and picturesque French villages are promoted through the association Les Plus Beaux Villages de France (litt. "The Most Beautiful Villages of France").
The "Remarkable Gardens" label is a list of the over 200 gardens classified by the French Ministry of Culture. This label is intended to protect and promote remarkable gardens and parks. France attracts many religious pilgrims on their way to St. James, or to Lourdes, a town in the Hautes-Pyrénées that hosts several million visitors a year.
France, especially Paris, has some of the world's largest and renowned museums, including the Louvre, which is the most visited art museum in the world, the Musée d'Orsay, mostly devoted to impressionism, and Beaubourg, dedicated to Contemporary art.

==Demographics==

With an estimated population of 66 million people as of July 2013, France is the 21st-most populous country in the world and the third-most populous in Europe. Although the French people are historically of Celtic (Gallic and Breton), Latin, Aquitanian, and Germanic (Frankish, Alemannic, Viking) origin, they are today a mixture of several other ethnic groups, due mostly to large-scale immigration over the last century and a half.
In 2004, the Institut Montaigne estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were white (85% of the population), 6 million were North African (10%), 2 million were black (3.5%), and 1 million were Asian (1.5%).Yazid Sabeg et Laurence Méhaignerie, Les oubliés de l'égalité des chances, Institut Montaigne, January 2004[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13377324 |title=France's ethnic minorities: To count or not to count |publisher=The Economist |date=26 March 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2013[/tpl]
A law originating from the 1789 revolution and reaffirmed in the 1958 French Constitution makes it illegal for the French state to collect data on ethnicity and ancestry, although some surveys, such as the TeO ("Trajectories and origins") poll conducted jointly by INED and INSEE in 2008, are allowed to do so."TRAJECTORIES AND ORIGINS" Survey on population diversity in France, Insee 2008[tpl]cite journal |last=Oppenheimer |first=David B. |year=2008| title=Why France needs to collect data on racial identity...in a French way |journal=Hastings International and Comparative Law Review |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=735–752 |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1236362[/tpl] It was estimated that 5 million people were of Italian ancestry (the most numerous immigrant community), between 3 million[tpl]cite book|author=Robin Cohen|title=The Cambridge Survey of World Migration|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YbzsBPuhyggC|date=2 November 1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44405-7[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/frances-crisis-of-national-identity-1826942.html |location=London |work=The Independent | title=France's crisis of national identity | date=25 November 2009[/tpl] and 6 million"Les personnes d'origine maghrébine y sont également au nombre de 5 à 6 millions; 3,5 millions ont la nationalité française (dont 500 000 harkis)", Évelyne Perrin, Identité Nationale, Amer Ministère, L'Harmattan, 2010, p. 112 ISBN 2-296-10839-3 people are of North African ancestry, 2.5 million people are of Sub-Saharan African origin, 200,000 people are of Turkish ancestry,[tpl]cite web|author=Falila Gbadamassi |url=http://www.afrik.com/article16248.html |title=Les personnes originaires d'Afrique, des Dom-Tom et de la Turquie sont 5,5 millions dans l'Hexagone |publisher=Afrik.com |date= |accessdate=30 September 2013[/tpl] and many more are of other European ethnic ancestry, namely Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, and Greek.[ref]
