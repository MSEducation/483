List of CAx companies and their software products.
Software using computer-aided technologies (CAx) has been produced since the 1970s through to the present for a variety of computer platforms. This software may include applications for Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Computer-aided engineering (CAE), Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) and Product Data Management (PDM).
The list is far from complete or representative as the CAD business landscape is very dynamic: almost every month new companies appear, old companies go out of business, companies split and merge. Sometimes some names disappear and reappear again.
