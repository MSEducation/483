The mythological Greek deity Hades often appears in popular culture.

==Film==

In 2010, Hades has been in the movies Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief played by Steve Coogan, and the remake of Clash of the Titans and its sequel Wrath of the Titans played by Ralph Fiennes. He is depicted as an antagonist in all three but only evil in Clash. And he turns into an ally in Wrath.

==Television==

In the two television series Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess, Hades was a recurring character, most frequently played by Erik Thomson, although Mark Ferguson and Stephen Lovatt have also played the part.  In both series, he was depicted as being overworked and understaffed.
On two episodes of Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Persephone was played by Andrea Croton, while Michael Hurst portrayed Charon as a recurring character on both series. The ruler of the Underworld was also the subject of episode 3 of Clash of the Gods.
In the DC comics TV series Smallville, the powerful and demonic deity Darkseid was in Earth's history by many names such as Hades and Lucifer and was also connected to the Hindu goddess Kali.

Anaïs Mitchell's folk opera Hadestown presents Hades as the boss of a post-apocalyptic Depression-era company town. The 2010 recording features Greg Brown performing the deep-voiced part of Hades.

==Disney==

In the Disney 1997 film Hercules, Hades appears as the main antagonist. Unlike the mythological Hades, this version is a fast-talking, evil deity; a combination of Satan and a dodgy car salesman. He plans to overthrow Zeus and rule the Universe, but kill Hercules before that so the hero doesn't foil his plot. The character was voiced by James Woods.

==Saint Seiya==
