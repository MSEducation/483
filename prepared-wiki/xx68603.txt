He dropped out of the seminary after one year in order to take a job in Christian broadcasting.[tpl]cite news|last=Chafets|first=Zev|date=December 12, 2007|title=The Huckabee Factor|publisher=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/magazine/16huckabee.html?_r=2&hp=&pagewanted=print&oref=slogin&oref=slogin[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mikehuckabee.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=About.Home|title=Official biography|accessdate=October 26, 2007[/tpl]

==Pastoral career==

At 21, Huckabee was a staffer for James Robison, a television evangelist. Robison commented, "His convictions shape his character and his character will shape his policies. His whole life has been shaped by moral absolutes."
Prior to his political career, Huckabee served as pastor at Immanuel Baptist Church in Pine Bluff, Arkansas from 1980 to 1986 and the Beech Street Baptist Church in Texarkana from 1986 to 1992. In both Texarkana and Pine Bluff Huckabee started 24-hour television stations "where he produced documentaries and hosted a program called Positive Alternatives. He encouraged the all-white Immanuel Baptist Church to accept black members in the mid-1980s. He served as president of a religion-oriented television station.
In 1989 Huckabee ran against the Rev. Dr. Ronnie Floyd of Springdale for the presidency of the Arkansas Baptist State Convention.[ref][tpl]cite news |last=Scudder |first=James |title=Southern Baptists face crucial week //Baptist fuss is taking its toll |publisher=Arkansas Democrat-gazette |date=June 11, 1990[/tpl]
[/ref] Huckabee won and served as president from 1989 to 1991.

==Early political career==

In 1992, in Huckabee's first political race, he lost to incumbent Senator and conservative Democrat Dale Bumpers, receiving 40 percent of the vote in the general election.[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5DE163FF936A35752C1A964958260|title=THE 1992 ELECTIONS: STATE BY STATE; SOUTH|date=November 5, 1992|publisher=The New York Times | first1=John H. | last1=Cushman Jr | first2=James | last2=Dao | first3=Jason | last3=DeParle | first4=Clifford | last4=Krauss | first5=Stephen | last5=Labaton | first6=Neil A. | last6=Lewis | first7=David | last7=Margolick | first8=Maria | last8=Newman | first9=Martin | last9=Tolchin | accessdate=May 12, 2010[/tpl] That same election saw Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton ascend to the Presidency, making Lieutenant Governor Jim Guy Tucker the new Governor. In 1993, Republican state chairman Asa Hutchinson urged Huckabee to run in the special election for lieutenant governor held on July 27. Realizing his loss came among key conservative Democrats, Huckabee ran a decidedly conservative campaign appealing to several important conservative groups such as the Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC). In the subsequent general election, he defeated Nate Coulter, who had been Bumpers' campaign manager the previous year,[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n5_v14/ai_14558214/pg_2 |title=GOP wins one in Arkansas – Republican Party; Mike Huckabee | Campaigns & Elections | Find Articles at BNET.com |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=October 16, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080107151043/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n5_v14/ai_14558214/pg_2 |archivedate = January 7, 2008[/tpl] 51–49 percent. Huckabee became only the second Republican since Reconstruction to serve as Arkansas lieutenant governor, the first having been Maurice Britt from 1967 to 1971.
In his autobiography From Hope to Higher Ground, Huckabee recalled the chilly reception that he received from the Arkansas Democratic establishment on his election as lieutenant governor:
 "The doors to my office were spitefully nailed shut from the inside, office furniture and equipment were removed, and the budget spent down to almost nothing prior to our arriving. After fifty-nine days of public outcry, the doors were finally opened for me to occupy the actual office I had been elected to hold two months earlier."Huckabee, From Hope to Higher Ground, pp. 6–7 
Dick Morris, who had previously worked for Bill Clinton, advised Huckabee on his races in 1993, 1994 and 1998.[tpl]cite news|last=Nelson|first=Rex|date=July 2, 1995|title=Clinton's Hired Gun Gives Huckabee Hand: Lieutenant Governor Shooting for Senate|publisher=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette[/tpl] Huckabee commented that Morris was a "personal friend". A newspaper article reported on Huckabee's 1993 win: "Morris said the mistake Republicans always make is that they are too much of a country club set. What we wanted to do was run a progressive campaign that would appeal to all Arkansans.'"
Morris elaborated, "So we opened the campaign with ads that characterized Mike as more of a moderate whose values were the same as those of other Arkansans." Consequently, he abandoned his earlier support for the CofCC when in April 1994 following an adverse media campaign against the CofCC, Huckabee withdrew from a speaking engagement before their national convention. He repeated the accusations made by various media and left-wing organizations such as the Southern Poverty Law Center recalling his past association with the CofCC saying, "I will not participate in any program that has racist overtones. I've spent a lifetime fighting against racism and anti-Semitism."[tpl]cite news |last=Duhart |first=Bill |coauthors= |title=Huckabee won't appear with racist. |work= |pages= |language= |publisher=Philadelphia Tribune |date=April 12, 1994 |url= |accessdate=[/tpl]
In 1994, Huckabee was re-elected to a full term as lieutenant governor, beating Democratic candidate Charlie Cole Chaffin with nearly 59 percent of the vote.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=3929|title=1994 AR Lt. Governor Election Results|publisher=OurCampaigns.com[/tpl] However, the amount of money spent by Huckabee on the campaign gave cause to accusations of possible corruption. In subsequent investigations it was revealed that while Lieutenant Governor, Huckabee accepted $71,500 in speaking fees and traveling expenses from a nonprofit group, Action America. R. J. Reynolds was the group's largest contributor.[tpl]cite news |last=Bailey |first=Holly |coauthors=Michael Isikoff |title=A Pastor's True Calling: Huckabee's success is due, in part, to right-time, right-place luck.

In October 1995, David Pryor announced that he was retiring from the United States Senate. Huckabee then announced he was running for the open seat and moved well ahead in the polls. He won the Republican nomination unopposed.
During his campaign, Huckabee opposed in December then-Governor Tucker's plan for a constitutional convention.[tpl]cite news |last=O'Neal |first=Rachel |coauthors=Caldwell, Elizabeth |title=OBSERVERS SAY ARKANSANS: Arkansas voters didn't like the idea of allowing 26 appointed legislators to serve as delegates to a proposed constitutional convention. |publisher=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette |date=December 14, 1995 [/tpl] The plan was defeated by voters, 80–20 percent, in a special election. In January 1996, Huckabee campaigned in televised ads paid for by the Republican National Committee and the Arkansas Republican Party against a highway referendum. Tucker supported the referendum, which included tax increases and a bond program, to improve [tpl]convert|1300|mi|km[/tpl] of highway.[tpl]cite news |last=O'Neal |first=Rachel |title=ROAD VOTE |publisher=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette |date=January 11, 1996 [/tpl] On the referendum, the bond question, which included a sales tax increase and a gas tax increase, lost 87–13 percent.

In May 1996, Tucker, involved in the Whitewater scandal, was convicted "on one count of arranging nearly $3 million in fraudulent loans" and he promised to resign by July 15. Huckabee then announced he would quit the Senate race and instead fill the unexpired term of Tucker.[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905EEDB1E39F932A05756C0A960958260 |title=Arkansan Quits Senate Race to Lead State |work=The New York Times |last=Sack |first=Kevin |date=May 31, 1996[/tpl]

==Governor of Arkansas==

In 1996, incumbent Democratic governor Jim Guy Tucker was convicted of fraud. The Arkansas Constitution, like nearly all state constitutions in the United States, does not allow convicted felons to hold office, so Tucker was forced to resign. However, Tucker, insisting he had a strong case for appeal,[tpl]cite book |title=The Almanac of American Politics |last=Barone |first=Michael |authorlink= |coauthors=Grant Ujifusa |year=1999 |publisher=National Journal |location=Washington, DC |isbn=0-8129-3194-7 |page=44[/tpl] rescinded his resignation as Huckabee was preparing to be sworn in on July 15. Within a few hours, Tucker reinstated his resignation after Huckabee threatened to initiate impeachment proceedings against Tucker. Huckabee was sworn in as Governor of Arkansas on July 15, 1996. In November 1998, Huckabee was elected to a full four-year term by defeating retired Colonel Gene McVay in the primary and Jonesboro attorney Bill Bristow in the general election, becoming the state's third elected Republican Governor since Reconstruction. In November 2002, Huckabee was reelected to his second four-year term by defeating State Treasurer Jimmie Lou Fisher, garnering 53 percent of the vote. His reelection came despite the defeat in the general election of fellow Republican U.S. Senator Tim Hutchinson. By the end of his term, Huckabee owned the third-longest tenure of any Arkansas Governor. Only Democrats Orval Faubus, who served six consecutive two-year terms (1955–1967), and Bill Clinton, who served 11 years, 11 months (1979–1981; 1983–1992), had longer tenures.
Huckabee said that his experience as a minister afforded him special insight in being governor:  My experience dealing every day with real people who were genuinely affected by policies created by government gave me a deep understanding of the fragility of the human spirit and vulnerability of so many families who struggled from week to week. I was in the ICU at 2 a.m. with families faced with the decision to disconnect a respirator on their loved one; I counseled fifteen-year-old pregnant girls who were afraid to tell their parents about their condition; I spent hours hearing the grief of women who had been physically and emotionally clobbered by an abusive husband; I saw the anguish in the faces of an elderly couple when their declining health forced them to sell their home, give up their independence, and move into a long-term-care facility; I listened to countless young couples pour out their souls as they struggled to get their marriages into survival mode when confronted with overextended debt...Huckabee, From Hope to Higher Ground, p. 7

Even though Huckabee had signed a television contract and a book deal with a pressing deadline, he was mentioned by most to be on then-presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain's short list for his Vice Presidential running mate.

Clemmons had committed burglary without a weapon, and his 60-year sentence was commuted by Huckabee to 47 years, making him eligible for parole if approved by the parole board. The prosecuting attorney of Pulaski County, Arkansas vehemently objected to the commutation. As factors in his decision, Huckabee cited the unusually long sentence of 108 years for Clemmons, who was 17 at the time, that Clemmons had already served 11 years of jail time, the unanimous decision by the bipartisan state pardon board in Clemmons's favor, and the original trial judge's support for clemency. When Clemmons received the 60-year sentence, he already was serving 48 years on five felony convictions and facing up to 95 more years on charges of robbery, theft and possessing a handgun on school property.[tpl]cite news|last=Sterling |first=Amanda |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/12/01/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry5854298.shtml |title=Huckabee Calls Criticisms Over Clemency "Disgusting" – Political Hotsheet |publisher=CBS News |date=December 1, 2009 |accessdate=June 13, 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |title=Suspect let out of Pierce County jail one week ago|work=The Seattle Times|location=Seattle, Washington|date=November 29, 2009|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2010386501_clemmons30m.html|accessdate=November 30, 2009[/tpl] After his release in 2000 Clemmons was arrested a number of times for multiple offenses including child molestation and aggravated assault, but was released after prosecutors declined to file charges.

After a two-day manhunt that spanned several cities in the Puget Sound region, the armed Clemmons was shot and killed by a Seattle Police Department officer in south Seattle after refusing police orders to stop charging the officer.[tpl]cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2010393433_webarrest01m.html|title=Lakewood police shooting suspect killed by Seattle police officer in South Seattle early this morning|last=Sullivan|first=Jennifer|coauthors=Mark Rahner, Jack Broom|date=December 1, 2009|work=The Seattle Times|accessdate=December 1, 2009[/tpl]
In 2003, Eugene Fields received a six-year prison sentence after his fourth conviction of driving while intoxicated in five years. Gov. Huckabee granted clemency over the objections of the local prosecutor and sheriff, the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association and Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). A spokeswoman for Mr. Huckabee, Charmaine Yoest, said that Mr. Fields' political donations the Arkansas Republican Party and connections played no role in his clemency. About two years after Mr. Fields' sentence was cut to 11 months, he was arrested again for driving while intoxicated as his truck crossed the center line directly into the path of an oncoming police car.[tpl]Cite news |title=The Long Run: Charming and Aloof, Huckabee Changed State |work=The New York Times |location=Little Rock, AR|date=December 22, 2007 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/22/us/politics/22commute.html?_r=2&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1198343576-wqXZD02A72A4LL3ZAHATxw |accessdate=November 30, 2009 |first=David |last=Barstow[/tpl]

===Weight loss and health advocacy===

When elected governor of Arkansas, Huckabee was obese. In 2003, physicians diagnosed him with type 2 diabetes, and informed him that he would not live more than 10 years if he did not lose weight. Huckabee acknowledges that he has weighed as much as 300 pounds (135 kg). Coupled with  the death of former Governor Frank D. White (whose obesity contributed to a fatal heart attack) his diagnosis prompted Huckabee to begin eating a healthier diet and exercising. He subsequently lost over 110 pounds (50 kg).[ref]

Although Huckabee has stated that he never smoked nor drank, he declared himself a "recovering foodaholic". Huckabee has publicly recounted his previous burdens as an obese man: the steps of the Arkansas capitol from the entrance of the building up to the Governor's office were so long and steep that he would be out of breath and exhausted by the time he reached the top of the stairs. He once joked that he would be interviewed by media at the top of the steps, and that he would be too out of breath to respond.[ref]
