[[MetaEdit+]]

CATEGORIES: Computer programming tools

MetaEdit+ is an environment for creating and using Domain-Specific Modeling languages.

==Research History==

The research behind the genesis of MetaEdit+ was carried out at the University of Jyväskylä, as part of the MetaPHOR project. A metamodeling and modeling tool, MetaEdit, had been created by the earlier SYTI project in the late 1980s and early 1990s, in co-operation with a company, MetaCase.
Both MetaEdit and MetaEdit+ were described in a large number of publications from the MetaPHOR research group (including,Smolander, K., Lyytinen, K., Tahvanainen, V.-P., and Marttiin, P., "MetaEdit: A flexible graphical environment for methodology modelling", Proceedings of CAiSE'91, 3rd Intl. Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering, Springer Verlag, pp. 168–193, 1991.Kelly, S., Lyytinen, K., and Rossi, M., "MetaEdit+: A Fully Configurable Multi-User and Multi-Tool CASE Environment", Proceedings of CAiSE'96, 8th Intl. Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1080, Springer-Verlag, pp. 1–21, 1996.).

==Tool History==

MetaEdit allowed graphical metamodeling using Object-Property-Role-Relationship (OPRR) data model, definition of the DSM language notation with a graphical symbol editor, and the definition of code generators using a Domain-Specific Language. These three elements together formed a metamodel file, which configured MetaEdit to support that modeling language. Version 1.0 was released as shareware in 1993, and 1.1 and 1.2 as commercial software in 1993 and 1995.
MetaEdit was limited to supporting one modeling language at a time, one user at a time, and one representational paradigm - graphical diagrams. MetaEdit+ was designed to extend this to multiple integrated modeling languages, multiple simultaneous users, and multiple representational paradigms - diagrams, matrices and tables.

==Work flow==

MetaEdit+ consists of two separate tools:MetaEdit+ Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM) environment
Normally, MetaEdit+ Workbench is used by a few key developers to design a project-specific modeling language. Then, this modeling language is used to develop final products using MetaEdit+ Modeler.
