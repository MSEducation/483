The Central Cheetahs, known for sponsorship reasons as the Toyota Cheetahs, is a South African rugby union team that entered the Super Rugby competition in 2006. The franchise area encompasses the Free State and Northern Cape. In terms of Currie Cup unions, the Cheetahs draw from Free State Cheetahs, Northern Free State Griffons and Griquas. They play home games at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein and GWK Park in Kimberley. The current Cheetahs captain is Adriaan Strauss.
The Cheetahs was one of the two new franchises that entered the expanded Super 14 competition in 2006, the other being Australia's Western Force. The Central Union was awarded the fifth South African franchise over the SEC franchise in April 2005. In its first season the Cheetahs did surprisingly well, finishing tenth in the final standings, out of 14 sides. Prior to being accepted into the 2006 Super 14 season, the Cheetahs areas were represented as a part of the Cats franchise. In addition, before South Africa entered franchises into the Super 14, the Free State Currie Cup side competed in the 1997 Super 12 season.[tpl]cite web | title=Central Cheetahs | work=CRFU | url=http://www.crfu.co.nz/main/index.cfm/1,411,html/Central-Cheetahs | accessdate=2 February 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070320073922/http://www.crfu.co.nz/main/index.cfm/1,411,html/Central-Cheetahs  |archivedate = 20 March 2007[/tpl]

==Strip==

The primary strip for the Central Cheetahs is a white jersey with an orange collar, and orange strips down the side of the body of the jersey. The shoulders have turquoise and purple strips. The colours are representative of the three central union Currie Cup sides; orange and white (Free State Cheetahs), turquoise (Griquas) and purple (Northern Free State Griffons).
The alternative jersey is essentially the same design, though it is primarily orange, with purple and white strip along the shoulders, and turquoise and white strips along the body of the jersey.

==History==

Prior to South Africa entering franchises into the then Super 12, the domestic Currie Cup sides competed instead. The Free State Cheetahs, one of the sides that make up the current Central Cheetahs, competed in one Super 12 season in 1997. The Free State played 11 matches, winning 5 and losing 6. They placed 7th on the end of season standings.
Proposals by the Central Union franchise and the SEC (Southern and Eastern Cape) franchise were studied for the allocation of a fifth Super Rugby team license. The Central Union emphasized points to the SARU such as that the region is second only to the Western Province in terms of producing players for the national side. The Central Union noted that they have a strong and stable fanbase that would be able to meet financial and administrative responsibilities and demands of a Super 14 rugby side.[tpl]cite web | title=TashiTagg | work=Who Will Get The Fifth Franchise? | url=http://www.tashitagg.com/12man/00398.asp | accessdate=19 February 2006[/tpl]
In mid April 2005, the South African Rugby Union announced that the Central Unions franchise would be its fifth team for the expanded Super 14 competition that would begin in 2006. They were awarded the franchise ahead of the Southern and Eastern Cape (see Southern Spears). In the pre-season of the their entrance to the new look Super 14 competition, the Cheetahs played both of the other new franchises, new Australian team; the Western Force and 2007 fellow South African team, the Southern Spears. The Cheetahs proved to be the strongest out of the new sides, demolishing the Spears 48 to nil and soundly defeating the Force in Perth, 29 to 19.
The Cheetahs played their first game on 10 February, proving they are fighting fit, but were not good enough on the day for the South African Bulls, losing their first official match in Bloemfontein 18 points to 30. The Cheetahs won their first Super 14 game in week two, defeating the Sharks in a thrilling match seeing the Cheetahs win by a single point, 27 to 26. Entering round four of the 2006 season, the Cheetahs were facing the table leaders, the Hurricanes. In a surprise result, the Cheetahs beat the table leaders, thus winning their first home game and proving they deserve to be in the Super 14.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]
The Cheetahs finally broke their drought in overseas matches with an upset over the New South Wales Waratahs on March 19, 2011.

==Stadium==

The Cheetahs' home stadium is the Free State Stadium, also referred to as Vodacom Park for sponsorship purposes, located in Bloemfontein. The stadium had its capacity upgraded to 48,000 for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The stadium is the home of Free State rugby as it is also home to the Free State Cheetahs, a Currie Cup side which produces a large number of players for the Cheetahs franchise. Matches are also played at GWK Park in Kimberley, home of the Griqualand West Rugby Union. In 2010 the Cheetahs played a game in Welkom.
