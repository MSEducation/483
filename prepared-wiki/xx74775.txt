[[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]]

CATEGORIES: Cellular respiration, Nucleotides, Photosynthesis, Coenzymes

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, abbreviated NAD+, is a coenzyme found in all living cells. The compound is a dinucleotide, since it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate groups. One nucleotide contains an adenine base and the other nicotinamide.
In metabolism, NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] is involved in redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another. The coenzyme is, therefore, found in two forms in cells: NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] is an oxidizing agent – it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes reduced. This reaction forms NADH, which can then be used as a reducing agent to donate electrons. These electron transfer reactions are the main function of NAD[tpl]+[/tpl]. However, it is also used in other cellular processes, the most notable one being a substrate of enzymes that add or remove chemical groups from proteins, in posttranslational modifications. Because of the importance of these functions, the enzymes involved in NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] metabolism are targets for drug discovery.
In organisms, NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] can be synthesized from simple building-blocks (de novo) from the amino acids tryptophan or aspartic acid. In an alternative fashion, more complex components of the coenzymes are taken up from food as the vitamin called niacin. Similar compounds are released by reactions that break down the structure of NAD[tpl]+[/tpl]. These preformed components then pass through a salvage pathway that recycles them back into the active form. Some NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] is also converted into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP[tpl]+[/tpl]); the chemistry of this related coenzyme is similar to that of NAD[tpl]+[/tpl], but it has different roles in metabolism.
Although NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] is written with a superscript plus sign because of the formal charge on a particular nitrogen atom, at physiological pH for the most part it is actually a singly-charged anion (charge of minus 1), while NADH is a doubly-charged anion.
NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] is considered the "V factor" required for the growth of Haemophilus influenzae.

==Physical and chemical properties==

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, like all dinucleotides, consists of two nucleotides joined by a pair of bridging phosphate groups. The nucleotides consist of ribose rings, one with adenine attached to the first carbon atom (the 1' position) and the other with nicotinamide at this position. The nicotinamide moiety can be attached in two orientations to this anomeric carbon atom. Because of these two possible structures, the compound exists as two diastereomers. It is the β-nicotinamide diastereomer of NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] that is found in organisms. These nucleotides are joined together by a bridge of two phosphate groups through the 5' carbons.[tpl]Cite journal| last = Pollak | first = N | coauthors = Dölle C, Ziegler M | title = The power to reduce: pyridine nucleotides – small molecules with a multitude of functions | journal = Biochem.

The proton is released into solution, while the reductant RH[tpl]sub|2[/tpl] is oxidized and NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] reduced to NADH by transfer of the hydride to the nicotinamide ring.
From the hydride electron pair, one electron is transferred to the positively charged nitrogen of the nicotinamide ring of NAD[tpl]+[/tpl], and the second hydrogen atom transferred to the C4 carbon atom opposite this nitrogen. The midpoint potential of the NAD[tpl]+[/tpl]/NADH redox pair is −0.32 volts, which makes NADH a strong reducing agent.[tpl]Cite journal| author = Unden G | coauthors = Bongaerts J | title = Alternative respiratory pathways of Escherichia coli: energetics and transcriptional regulation in response to electron acceptors | journal = Biochim.

Both NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] and NADH strongly absorb ultraviolet light because of the adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] is at a wavelength of 259 nanometers (nm), with an extinction coefficient of 16,900 M−1cm−1.

The balance between the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD[tpl]+[/tpl]/NADH ratio.

==Biosynthesis==

NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] is synthesized through two metabolic pathways. It is produced either in a de novo pathway from amino acids or in salvage pathways by recycling preformed components such as nicotinamide back to NAD[tpl]+[/tpl].

===De novo production===

Most organisms synthesize NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] from simple components. The specific set of reactions differs among organisms, but a common feature is the generation of quinolinic acid (QA) from an amino acid—either tryptophan (Trp) in animals and some bacteria, or aspartic acid in some bacteria and plants.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Katoh A, Uenohara K, Akita M, Hashimoto T |title=Early Steps in the Biosynthesis of NAD in Arabidopsis Start with Aspartate and Occur in the Plastid |journal=Plant Physiol. |volume=141 |issue=3 |pages=851–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16698895 |pmc=1489895 |doi=10.1104/pp.106.081091 [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal|author=Foster JW, Moat AG |title=Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide biosynthesis and pyridine nucleotide cycle metabolism in microbial systems |journal=Microbiol. Rev. |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=83–105 |date=1 March 1980|pmid=6997723 |pmc=373235 [/tpl] The quinolinic acid is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) by transfer of a phosphoribose moiety. An adenylate moiety is then transferred to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). Finally, the nicotinic acid moiety in NaAD is amidated to a nicotinamide (Nam) moiety, forming nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.
In a further step, some NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] is converted into NADP[tpl]+[/tpl] by NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] kinase, which phosphorylates NAD[tpl]+[/tpl].[tpl]Cite journal|author=Magni G, Orsomando G, Raffaelli N |title=Structural and functional properties of NAD kinase, a key enzyme in NADP biosynthesis |journal=Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=739–46 |year=2006 |pmid=16842123 |doi=10.2174/138955706777698688[/tpl] In most organisms, this enzyme uses ATP as the source of the phosphate group, although several bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii, use inorganic polyphosphate as an alternative phosphoryl donor.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Sakuraba H, Kawakami R, Ohshima T |title=First Archaeal Inorganic Polyphosphate/ATP-Dependent NAD Kinase, from Hyperthermophilic Archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii: Cloning, Expression, and Characterization |journal=Appl.

===Salvage pathways===

Besides assembling NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] de novo from simple amino acid precursors, cells also salvage preformed compounds containing nicotinamide. Although other precursors are known, the three natural compounds containing the nicotinamide ring and used in these salvage metabolic pathways are nicotinic acid (Na), nicotinamide (Nam) and nicotinamide riboside (NR). These compounds can be taken up from the diet, where the mixture of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide are called vitamin B[tpl]sub|3[/tpl] or niacin. However, these compounds are also produced within cells, when the nicotinamide moiety is released from NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] in ADP-ribose transfer reactions. Indeed, the enzymes involved in these salvage pathways appear to be concentrated in the cell nucleus, which may compensate for the high level of reactions that consume NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] in this organelle.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Anderson RM, Bitterman KJ, Wood JG, et al. |title=Manipulation of a nuclear NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] salvage pathway delays aging without altering steady-state NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] levels |journal=J.

Despite the presence of the de novo pathway, the salvage reactions are essential in humans; a lack of niacin in the diet causes the vitamin deficiency disease pellagra.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Henderson LM |title=Niacin |journal=Annu.

==Functions==

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide has several essential roles in metabolism. It acts as a coenzyme in redox reactions, as a donor of ADP-ribose moieties in ADP-ribosylation reactions, as a precursor of the second messenger molecule cyclic ADP-ribose, as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial DNA ligases and a group of enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] to remove acetyl groups from proteins. In addition to these metabolic functions, NAD+ emerges as an adenine nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms,[tpl]cite journal|last=Smyth|first=LM|coauthors=Bobalova, J; Mendoza, MG; Lew, C; Mutafova-Yambolieva, VN|title=Release of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide upon stimulation of postganglionic nerve terminals in blood vessels and urinary bladder|journal=J Biol Chem.|year=2004|volume=279|issue=47|pages=48893–903|pmid=15364945|doi=10.1074/jbc.M407266200[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Billington|first=RA|coauthors=Bruzzone S; De Flora A; Genazzani AA; Koch-Nolte F; Ziegler M; Zocchi E|title=Emerging functions of extracellular pyridine nucleotides|journal=Mol Med.|year=2006|volume=12|issue=11–12|pages=324–7|doi=10.2119/2006-00075.Billington|pmid=17380199|pmc=1829198[/tpl] and can therefore have important extracellular roles.

===Oxidoreductase binding===

The main role of NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] in metabolism is the transfer of electrons from one molecule to another. Reactions of this type are catalyzed by a large group of enzymes called oxidoreductases. The correct names for these enzymes contain the names of both their substrates: for example NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase catalyzes the oxidation of NADH by coenzyme Q.[tpl]Cite web| url = http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme | title = Enzyme Nomenclature, Recommendations for enzyme names from the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | accessdate = 2007-12-06[/tpl] However, these enzymes are also referred to as dehydrogenases or reductases, with NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase commonly being called NADH hydrogenase or sometimes coenzyme Q reductase.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.expasy.org/enzyme/1.6.5.3 |title=NiceZyme View of ENZYME: EC 1.6.5.3 |accessdate=2007-12-16 |publisher=Expasy[/tpl]
When bound to a protein, NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] and NADH are usually held within a structural motif known as the Rossmann fold.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Lesk AM |title=NAD-binding domains of dehydrogenases |journal=Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=775–83 |year=1995 |pmid=8749365 |doi=10.1016/0959-440X(95)80010-7[/tpl] The motif is named after Michael Rossmann who was the first scientist to notice how common this structure is within nucleotide-binding proteins.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Rao S, Rossmann M |title=Comparison of super-secondary structures in proteins |journal=J Mol Biol |volume=76 |issue=2 | pages=241–56 |year=1973 |pmid=4737475 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(73)90388-4[/tpl] This fold contains three or more parallel beta strands linked by two alpha helices in the order beta-alpha-beta-alpha-beta. This forms a beta sheet flanked by a layer of alpha helices on each side. Because each Rossmann fold binds one nucleotide, binding domains for the dinucleotide NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] consist of two paired Rossmann folds, with each fold binding one nucleotide within the cofactor. However, this fold is not universal among NAD-dependent enzymes, since a class of bacterial enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism have recently been discovered that bind the coenzyme, but lack this motif.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Goto M, Muramatsu H, Mihara H, et al. |title=Crystal structures of Delta1-piperideine-2-carboxylate/Delta1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate reductase belonging to a new family of NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductases: conformational change, substrate recognition, and stereochemistry of the reaction |journal=J.

When bound in the active site of an oxidoreductase, the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme is positioned so that it can accept a hydride from the other substrate. Since the C4 carbon that accepts the hydrogen is prochiral, this can be exploited in enzyme kinetics to give information about the enzyme's mechanism. This is done by mixing an enzyme with a substrate that has deuterium atoms substituted for the hydrogens, so the enzyme will reduce NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] by transferring deuterium rather than hydrogen. In this case, an enzyme can produce one of two stereoisomers of NADH. In some enzymes the hydrogen is transferred from above the plane of the nicotinamide ring; these are called class A oxidoreductases, whereas class B enzymes transfer the atom from below.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Bellamacina CR |title=The nicotinamide dinucleotide binding motif: a comparison of nucleotide binding proteins |journal=FASEB J. |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=1257–69 |date=1 September 1996|pmid=8836039 [/tpl]
Despite the similarity in how proteins bind the two coenzymes, enzymes almost always show a high level of specificity for either NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] or NADP[tpl]+[/tpl].[tpl]Cite journal|author=Carugo O, Argos P |title=NADP-dependent enzymes.

For instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent enzymes, an ionic bond is formed between a basic amino acid side-chain and the acidic phosphate group of NADP[tpl]+[/tpl]. On the converse, in NAD-dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP[tpl]+[/tpl] from binding. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, and enzymes such as aldose reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can use both coenzymes in some species.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Vickers TJ, Orsomando G, de la Garza RD, et al. |title=Biochemical and genetic analysis of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase in Leishmania metabolism and virulence |journal=J.

===Role in redox metabolism===

The redox reactions catalyzed by oxidoreductases are vital in all parts of metabolism, but one particularly important area where these reactions occur is in the release of energy from nutrients. Here, reduced compounds such as glucose and fatty acids are oxidized, thereby releasing energy. This energy is transferred to NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] by reduction to NADH, as part of beta oxidation, glycolysis, and the citric acid cycle. In eukaryotes the electrons carried by the NADH that is produced in the cytoplasm are transferred into the mitochondrion (to reduce mitochondrial NAD[tpl]+[/tpl]) by mitochondrial shuttles, such as the malate-aspartate shuttle.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Bakker BM, Overkamp KM, van Maris AJ, et al. |title=Stoichiometry and compartmentation of NADH metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae |journal=FEMS Microbiol.

Since both the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are used in these linked sets of reactions, the cell maintains significant concentrations of both NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] and NADH, with the high NAD[tpl]+[/tpl]/NADH ratio allowing this coenzyme to act as both an oxidizing and a reducing agent.[tpl]Cite book|author=Nicholls DG|coauthors=Ferguson SJ|title=Bioenergetics 3 |edition=1st|publisher=Academic Press|year=2002 |isbn=0-12-518121-3[/tpl] In contrast, the main function of NADPH is as a reducing agent in anabolism, with this coenzyme being involved in pathways such as fatty acid synthesis and photosynthesis. Since NADPH is needed to drive redox reactions as a strong reducing agent, the NADP[tpl]+[/tpl]/NADPH ratio is kept very low.
Although it is important in catabolism, NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as gluconeogenesis.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Sistare FD, Haynes RC |title=The interaction between the cytosolic pyridine nucleotide redox potential and gluconeogenesis from lactate/pyruvate in isolated rat hepatocytes.

===Non-redox roles===

NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] is also consumed by sirtuins, which are NAD-dependent deacetylases, such as Sir2.[tpl]Cite journal|author=North B, Verdin E |title=Sirtuins: Sir2-related NAD-dependent protein deacetylases |journal=Genome Biol |volume=5 |issue=5 |page=224 |year=2004 |pmid=15128440 |pmc=416462 |doi=10.1186/gb-2004-5-5-224[/tpl] These enzymes act by transferring an acetyl group from their substrate protein to the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD[tpl]+[/tpl]; this cleaves the coenzyme and releases nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose.

Other NAD-dependent enzymes include bacterial DNA ligases, which join two DNA ends by using NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] as a substrate to donate an adenosine monophosphate (AMP) moiety to the 5' phosphate of one DNA end.

Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts, this heat-stable factor was identified as a nucleotide sugar phosphate by Hans von Euler-Chelpin.[tpl]Cite web | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1929/euler-chelpin-lecture.pdf | title = Fermentation of sugars and fermentative enzymes | work = Nobel Lecture, 23 May 1930 | accessdate=2007-09-30 | publisher = Nobel Foundation|format=PDF[/tpl] In 1936, the German scientist Otto Heinrich Warburg showed the function of the nucleotide coenzyme in hydride transfer and identified the nicotinamide portion as the site of redox reactions.[tpl]Cite journal |author=Warburg O, Christian W. |title=Pyridin, der wasserstoffübertragende bestandteil von gärungsfermenten (pyridin-nucleotide) |language=German |trans_title=Pyridin, the hydrogen-transferring component of the fermentation enzymes (pyridine nucleotide) |journal=Biochemische Zeitschrift |volume=287 |year=1936 |page=291 |doi=10.1002/hlca.193601901199 [/tpl]
A source of nicotinamide was identified in 1938, when Conrad Elvehjem purified niacin from liver and showed this vitamin contained nicotinic acid and nicotinamide.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Elvehjem CA, Madden RJ, Strong FM, Woolley DW |title=The isolation and identification of the anti-black tongue factor |journal=J.

Lehninger proved that NADH linked metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle with the synthesis of ATP in oxidative phosphorylation.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Friedkin M, Lehninger AL |title=Esterification of inorganic phosphate coupled to electron transport between dihydrodiphosphopyridine nucleotide and oxygen |journal=J.

The non-redox roles of NAD(P) are a recent discovery. The first of these functions to be identified was the use of NAD[tpl]+[/tpl] as the ADP-ribose donor in ADP-ribosylation reactions, observed in the early 1960s.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Chambon P, Weill JD, Mandel P |title=Nicotinamide mononucleotide activation of new DNA-dependent polyadenylic acid synthesizing nuclear enzyme |journal=Biochem.
