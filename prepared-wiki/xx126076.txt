==History==

The Perambur region has been a part of the Chennai city since the middle of the 18th century. The Southern Railway's workshop located here was established in the year 1856 to serve the erstwhile Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway Company. It was a combined locomotive, carriage and wagon POH, and coach-building workshop and was later bifurcated in 1932 to deal with carriage and wagon POH activity only, shifting the locomotive overhaul activity to the new Loco workshop which was built adjacent to the original workshop. These two workshops are served by Perambur Carriage Works and Perambur Loco Works stations, respectively. In 1951, the Southern Railway was formed by integrating the erstwhile South Indian Railway company, Madras and the Southern Mahratta Railway Company, and Mysore State Railway with all their workshops and assets.
The lines at the station were electrified on 29 November 1979, with the electrification of the Chennai Central–Tiruvallur section.[ref]
