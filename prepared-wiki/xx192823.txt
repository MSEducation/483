Eastern Shore District High School is a Canadian public school in the Musquodoboit Harbour area east of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. It is operated by the Halifax Regional School Board (HRSB).
Eastern Shore District High School opened to students in September 1965. The two student populations were combined to form the new school, the first were those from Robert Jamieson High School in Oyster Pond,: the second were those students who lived in the communities of Lake Echo, Porters Lake and Chezzetcook who had been attending Graham Creighton High School. The arrival of the 600 students essentially doubled the population of Musquodoboit Harbour. Musquodoboit Harbour in 1965 was being viewed as a viable alternative to city living. The following quote ran in the Dartmouth Daily Press on July 8, 1965 once the residence of the people who were born there who did business in the district, the Harbour is now largely an outpost of commuters ? navy people, Dalhousie professors, businessmen, shipyard workers. It has also become a favorite place for retirement, and probably one of the reasons has been, besides the well-settled, well-serviced village, the hospital itself which has been open since 1949. In 1979, a junior high school opened in Gaetz Brook. From that point on Eastern Shore High was used for grades ten to twelve, with grades seven, eight and nine attending Gaetz Brook Junior High.Social Anchors of Community: Church, Rink and School in Post War Musquodoboit Harbour, Nova Scotia - written by Cindy Kiley
