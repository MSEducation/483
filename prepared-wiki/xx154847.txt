Time and Chance is platinum selling R&B quartet Color Me Badd's second full length studio album.  Released in 1993, it was an extremely versatile album.  Combining elements of jazz, Latin and Hip-Hop while still staying true to their R&B roots.  The album peaked at #56, a far cry from their debut C.M.B., which peaked at #3.  While eventually reaching platinum status, it was initially considered a disappointment due to the enormous success of their first album.  The album received high praise from critics and contains two major hits in both the lead single "Time and Chance" and the Jimmy Jam &Terry Lewis-produced "Choose".  The former's music video was directed by rapper Ice Cube.
