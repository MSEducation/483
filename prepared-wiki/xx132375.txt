The Electoral district of Geelong is an electoral district of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. It is based around inner metropolitan Geelong and includes the suburbs of Bell Park, Drumcondra, East Geelong, Geelong, Geelong West, Newtown and South Geelong and parts of Highton, and North Geelong. Incomes vary strongly across the seat, and it is often aligned with the governing Party, due to similar demographics to the state at large.
It has been held since 1999 by Ian Trezise for the ALP, who won that election by 16 votes after recounts. The Victorian Parliament was hung at that election, and the results for the seat of Geelong, which took several days to arrive at, had a significant impact on the events which brought the Bracks government to power. At the 2002 election, the seat's margin grew to 8.1%. However, neither major party considers it safe, as it has been won by the governing party for every election between 1985 and 2006, but was narrowly held by Labor in the 2010 election.
