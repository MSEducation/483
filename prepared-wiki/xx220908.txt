Theobald II, Count of Bar (1221â€“1291) was a count of Bar.  He was the son of Henry II of Bar and Philippa of Dreux.  He became count of Bar when his father was killed in the Holy Land on 13 November 1239, but news of Henry's death only reached him at the start of 1240. As Theobald was still a minor, his mother ruled as regent until 17 March 1242. Theobald's own children included his successor Henry III and the bishop Reginald of Bar.
Theobald II married twice, first in 1245 to Jeanne of Dampierre, daughter of William II of Dampierre and Margaret II, Countess of Flanders. They were betrothed on 3 May 1243 and married two years later, in March 1245 or on 31 August 1245. The marriage was brief and childless.
