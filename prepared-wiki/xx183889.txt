Fazrul Nawaz (born 17 April 1985) is a Singaporean footballer who plays as a striker for Home United in the S.League and the Singapore national team.

==Club career==

Fazrul was released by Geylang United after a contractual dispute and it was reported in Malay newspapers that he had finally signed for Gombak United after strong rumours that he would join Sengkang Punggol  with his former team-mates Aide Iskandar, Noh Rahman and Amos Boon. However these rumours have since been proven to be false and Fazrul has been clubless since. In May 2009, Gombak United coach Darren Stewart had announced that Fazrul will be joining his team

==International career==

Fazrul made his international debut for Singapore on 4 June 2005, against Malaysia, coming on as a substitute for Masrezwan Masturi, who had broken his nose.
In the second leg of the 2007 ASEAN Football Championship semi-final, Fazrul scored the fourth out of five successfully converted penalties for Singapore in a penalty shootout win over Malaysia.
In the 2007 South East Asian Games, Fazrul's performance in the group stages was largely criticised by the fans and the media. More criticism arose when he failed to score a penalty against Malaysia. If he had scored, Singapore would have avoided favourites Thailand in the semi-final match, which Singapore eventually lost 3–0, ending the nation's hopes for a gold or silver medal. In the Bronze Medal placing match, Fazrul made amends for his poor performance by scoring a hat-trick in a 5–0 victory against Vietnam, winning the bronze medal for Singapore.
Due to an injury to his anterior cruciate ligament, sustained in a league match against Tampines Rovers, Fazrul was forced to miss the 2008 AFF Suzuki Cup, in which Singapore were knocked out in the semi-finals by Vietnam.
