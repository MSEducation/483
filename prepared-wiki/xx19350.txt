[[Zenith]]

CATEGORIES: Celestial coordinate system, Technical factors of astrology, Astrological house systems

The zenith is an imaginary point directly "above" a particular location, on the imaginary celestial sphere. "Above" means in the vertical direction opposite to the apparent gravitational force at that location. The opposite direction, i.e. the direction in which gravity pulls, is toward the nadir.
Zenith may be used as a name which means success and power.

==Origin==

The root of the word "zenith" in Proto-Indo-European was reconstructed as '*mei-' ("to change"). In Latin we find 'meare' ("to pass"). With the prefix 'sē-' ("aside") it became 'sēmeare' ("to branch off"). Then the noun 'sēmita' ("side-way") was formed.[tpl]cite book|last=Wyld|first=Henry Cecil Kennedy|title=Universal Dictionary of the English Languages|year=1932|pages=715,1089[/tpl] When the Romans occupied Syria, shortly before the time of Christ, the resident Arameans adopted the word 'sēmita' as 'simta' ("side-way").[tpl]cite book|last=Avinoam|first=Reuben|title=Compendious Hebrew – English Dictionary|year=1968|location=Tel Aviv|publisher=Dvir[/tpl] The Romans left. As the Arabians conquered the land in the seventh century they took the word 'simta' from the Arameans as 'samt' ("side-path") and also coined astronomical expressions.[tpl]cite book|last=Fraenkel|first=Siegmund|title=Die aramaeischen Fremdwoerter im Arabischen|year=1886|location=Leiden[/tpl]
The word "zenith" derives from the inaccurate reading of the Arabic expression [tpl]lang|ar|سمت الرأس[/tpl] ([tpl]transl|ar|DIN|samt ar-ra's[/tpl]), meaning "direction of the head" or "path above the head", by Medieval Latin scribes in the Middle Ages (during the 14th century), possibly through Old Spanish. It was reduced to 'samt' ("direction") and miswritten as 'senit'/'cenit', as the "m" was misread as an "ni". Through the Old French 'cenith', 'zenith' first appeared in the 17th century.[tpl]cite web|title=Etymology of the English word zenith|url=http://www.myetymology.com/english/zenith.html|publisher=My Etymology|accessdate=March 21, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Zenith|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/zenith|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=March 21, 2012[/tpl]

==Relevance and use==

The term zenith is sometimes used to refer to the highest point reached by a celestial body during its apparent orbit around a given point of observation.[tpl]cite web|title=Zenith|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/zenith|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=March 21, 2012[/tpl] This sense of the word is often used to describe the location of the Sun ("The sun reached its zenith..."), but to an astronomer the sun does not have its own zenith, and is at the zenith only if it is directly overhead.
In a scientific context, the zenith is the direction of reference for measuring the zenith angle, the angle between a direction of interest (e.g., a star) and the local zenith.
In astronomy, the altitude in the horizontal coordinate system and the zenith angle are complementary angles, with the horizon perpendicular to the zenith. The astronomical meridian is also determined by the zenith, and is defined as a circle on the celestial sphere that passes through the zenith, nadir, and the celestial poles.
