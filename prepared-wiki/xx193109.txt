Cartoon Network, is a cable and satellite television channel that primarily broadcasts animated programmes.

==History==

Cartoon Network started its broadcast in 1994 as the dual-channel TNT & Cartoon Network as part of the Foxtel cable TV launch, operating from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., with Turner Classic Movies taking the remainder of the daily schedule. On 1 July 2001, Cartoon Network Australia became a separate 24-hour channel, with exclusive local feeds. It originally aired only Hanna-Barbera cartoons. In 1996, MGM shows started airing and in 1997, Warner Bros. shows started airing. Also in 1997 the channel began airing original productions. On 22 August 1999, Cartoon Network introduced a new rebrand, introducing new bumpers, new shows and a new 'powerhouse' theme. In 2000 other non-original shows were introduced.
In 2001, a block called Cartoon Cartoons was introduced. Cartoon Network also introduced other programming blocks including Toonami, Acme Hour, Prime Time, Boomerangnd Cartoon Network After Dark. In 2003 and 2004, more programming blocks were added. Early in 2004, the Boomerang network launched as part of the new Foxtel digital package. Many of the older cartoons migrated to the new channel. In addition, Cartoon Network for a brief period would show segments of kids getting prizes during the holidays but this was axed from poor viewer response. Cartoon Network had, up until mid-2004, been tied with the Disney Channel as Asia's most popular family network. The removal of older programming from the network during this period led to a fall in average audience share during 2004 as fans of older cartoons moved to Boomerang.
On 1 October 2005, the channel's 'bumpers' were replaced with 3-D animation promotions that were set in a fictional location called "CN City". A well known scene from a show was sometimes the theme. The "Cartoon Cartoons" moniker was dropped in 2006. On 31 August 2008 the bumpers and ads were updated. "Cartoon Network Theatre" was renamed"Cartoon Network Popcorn". On 1 October 2011, during The Amazing World of Gumball premiere, the channel introduced a new branding, logo, and slogan.

==Programming==

Most of CN SEA's programmes are taken from either the Warner Bros., MGM or Hanna-Barbera production studios. Anime and tokusatsu programming from Japan completing the channel's schedule.

===South Korea===

In January 2003, CN SEA was launched in South Korea after the cancellation of a Cartoon Network block on Tooniverse. However, the channel is unable to insert Korean audio tracks into shows because non-South Korean channels are legally prohibited from doing so.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
In 2006, JoongAng Ilbo and the Turner company established a joint venture to launch a separate South Korean version of Cartoon Network and the channel was set to launch in November 2006. However, the launch was suddenly delayed due to a content dispute with the Tooniverse channel—the dispute concerned the joint venture's intention to produce its own Korean-language versions of some of Cartoon Network's original shows. Tooniverse-produced shows such as The Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Laboratory and Johnny Bravo, were not part of this plan. The South Korean channel was eventually cancelled and the distribution rights for the Southeast Asian channel were revoked and given to another company.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
