Beena is a  form of marriage used in pre-Islamic Arabia, in which a wife would own a tent of her own, within which she retained complete independence from her husband, a form of matriarchy.Smith, p. 167
The term was suggested by John Ferguson McLennan, who noted that in Ceylon the marriage when a husband goes to live in the wife's village is called "beena marriage", and suggested to use "beena" as a general term for this kind of marriages.Smith, pp. 70, 71
