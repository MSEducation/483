Francisco Antonio García López (1943–1995), also known as Toño Bicicleta (or Tony Bicycle in English), was a Puerto Rican criminal famous for escaping from jail several times. García managed to become part of Puerto Rican folklore and the object of constant references in popular culture. His escapes have become legendary in Puerto Rico.

==Biography==

Believed to be born in Lares, Puerto Rico, García was originally accused of the murder of his wife. He was mostly known as Toño Bicicleta because he never owned a car, and his favorite means of transport was a bicycle.

===Criminal history===

According to popular legend and police investigation, in 1968 Antonio García murdered his wife, Gloria Soto. García beheaded Soto with a machete in front of her 4 year old son and sister, for which he was sentenced to life in prison. However he managed to escape two years later.
In 1974, García was again captured by a civilian in a farm in the town of Bayamón, Puerto Rico. He was incarcerated in the prison of Sabana Hoyos in Arecibo, Puerto Rico until 1981 when he escaped again.
His numerous escapes helped him become part of the local lore. Allegedly, during his escapes he would continue committing rape and kidnappings. However, some people claim that due to his notoriety he was used as some sort of scapegoat both by authorities and civilians to several crimes in the island.
In 1983, García escaped for the seventh and last time. That time, he was able to stay on the loose for 12 years before being caught. In 1987, he killed his uncle and stepfather. That same year, García killed Luis Rodríguez and kidnapped a 14-year old girl, Diana Pérez Lebrón. The woman stayed with the criminal for eight years and was with him at the moment of his last showdown with authorities.

===Death and burial===

In the morning of November 29, 1995, García was allegedly working in a coffee plantation in Castañer, Puerto Rico. Police arrived at 7:30 am, and Officer Luis Rosa Merced of the Puerto Rico Police Department shot the notorious criminal in the genitals. García eventually bled to death.
García's burial was attended by close to 3,000 people curious to see Puerto Rico's most notorious criminal of the 20th Century.
