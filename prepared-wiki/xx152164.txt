Crush is the sixth album by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, released in 1985. 
"So in Love" became the group's first hit single in the US. The album also sold well in the US. Aimed primarily at the US market, it is notable for moving the band's sound in a far more commercial direction, although elements of earlier experimentation are still evident on the title track, which is built around a tape loop of samples from Japanese television commercials, and the closing track "The Lights Are Going Out".
Crush was Stephen Hague's first album as producer. He would go on to achieve continued success with groups such as Erasure, Pet Shop Boys and New Order.
A long-form video, Crush - The Movie was also released, showing the group talking about their career and performing the songs from the album.
