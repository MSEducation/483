The 1967 Campeonato Ecuatoriano de Fútbol ([tpl]lang-en|Ecuadorian Football Championship[/tpl]) was the 9th national championship for football teams in Ecuador. This season marked the first time the national championship was contested as a league and not as a tournament in which teams had to qualified for. With the creation of the Segunda Categoria this same season, a system of promotion and relegation was also implemented. 
El Nacional won their first national title this season, just three years after being founded.
