Some sources list either 1875 or 1880 without any month or day listedBiography of Mulai Abd al Hafiz ([tpl]lang-ar|عبد الحفيظ[/tpl]) was the Sultan of Morocco from 1908 to 1912 and a member of the Alaouite Dynasty. His younger brother, Abdelaziz of Morocco, preceded him. While Mulai Abdelhafid initially opposed his brother for giving some concessions to foreign powers, he himself became increasingly backed by the French and finally signed the protectorate treaty giving de facto control of the country to France.
After his brother, Abdelaziz appointed him as caliph of Marrakech, Abdelhafid sought to have him overthrown by fomenting distrust over Abdelaziz's European ties. He was aided by Madani al-Glaoui, older brother of T'hami one of the Caids of the Atlas. He was assisted in the training of his troops by Andrew Belton (Kaid), a British officer and veteran of the Second Boer War.New York Times, November 4, 1908 For a brief period Abdelaziz reigned from Rabat while Abdelhafid reigned in Marrakech and Fes was disputed. In 1908 Abdelaziz was defeated in battle. In 1909, he became the recognized leader of Morocco.
Abdelhafid abdicated after signing the Treaty of Fez on 30 March 1912,W. Harris, "Morocco That Was", ISBN 0-907871-13-5 which made Morocco a French protectorate.[tpl]cite book|last=Long|first=David E.|author2=Bernard Reich|year=2002|title=The Government and Politics of the Middle East and North Africa|page=393[/tpl] He signed his abdication only when on the quay in Rabat, with the ship that would bring him to France already waiting. After an extended visit to France, where he received a great deal of attention from the press, he returned to Morocco and was exiled to the Dar el Makhzen (Sultanate Palace) in Tangier.
His brother Yusef was proclaimed Sultan by the French administration several months later (13 August 1912).[tpl]cite news|title=Journal Officiel|url=http://www.sgg.gov.ma/BO%5Cbulletin%5CFr%5C1912%5CBO_1_fr.pdf|accessdate=22 October 2013|date=1 November 1912[/tpl] Yusef was chosen by some dignitaries of Rabat which wasn't the capital of Morocco at the time.
