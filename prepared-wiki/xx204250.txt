[[Grierson Awards]]

CATEGORIES: Film awards

The Grierson Awards celebrate innovative and exciting new documentary films. The awards have been set up by the Grierson Trust to commemorate the life and work of world-renowned documentary filmmaker John Grierson. The awards were first set up in 1972 and have run annually. In 2000 the Grierson Trust forged a link with the UK Film Council in order to expand the awards and add more prestige to the awards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.netribution.co.uk/news/northern_exposure/92/8.html|title=Film Council Grierson Documentary Awards[/tpl] The awards have grown in stature and recognition over the years and now are "more important (than ever). They have an impressive list engaging with a broad palette of styles and subjects from disabled people looking for love to asylums, Russian billionaires and global warming."
