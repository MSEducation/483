Fuad II ([tpl]Lang-ar|فؤاد الثاني[/tpl]) (born 16 January 1952 as Prince Ahmad Fuad) was the last King of Egypt and Sudan.

==Biography==

He ascended the throne on 26 July 1952 upon the abdication of his father King Farouk I following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. Farouk had hoped that his abdication would appease the revolutionaries and other anti-royalist forces, and that his son could serve as a unifying force for the country. However, the infant king reigned for less than a year until 18 June 1953, when Egypt was declared a republic. Fuad II was the eleventh and last monarch of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty, which had ruled Egypt (and later Sudan) since 1805. His name is sometimes spelled Fouad.
Fuad was less than a year old at the time of his accession to the throne, thus he was never formally crowned. Upon Farouk's abdication, the now former king was exiled, and the new King Fuad left Egypt with him and his family. The Council of Regency headed by Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim formally represented Fuad in Egypt during his absence.
After being deposed, Fuad was brought to Switzerland, where he was raised. He later emigrated to Paris where he married and had his three children raised[tpl]by whom|date=February 2014[/tpl] before returning to Switzerland after his divorce.

==Marriage and children==

In 1976, the former king married Dominique-France Picard (née Loeb, born 1948), the daughter of Robert Loeb and his wife, Paule Picard. She converted from Judaism to Islam and assumed the title Queen Fadila of Egypt. The couple had three children before they divorced in 1996.
Their children are:
In May 2010, he recorded a television interview with "ON TV" talking about his visit to Egypt, and how he felt about the Egyptian people, and their view of his late father.
