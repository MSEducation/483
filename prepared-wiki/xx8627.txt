</ref> of the order of [tpl]val|e=-19|ul=μ<sub>B</sub>[/tpl], allowing the possibility that neutrinos may interact electromagnetically as well. An experiment done by [[C. S. Wu]] at [[Columbia University]] showed that neutrinos always have left-handed [[chirality (physics)|chirality]].<ref>

[/ref] It is very hard to uniquely identify neutrino interactions among the natural background of radioactivity. For this reason, in early experiments a special reaction channel was chosen to facilitate the identification: the interaction of an antineutrino with one of the hydrogen nuclei in the water molecules. A hydrogen nucleus is a single proton, so simultaneous nuclear interactions, which would occur within a heavier nucleus, don't need to be considered for the detection experiment. Within a cubic metre of water placed right outside a nuclear reactor, only relatively few such interactions can be recorded, but the setup is now used for measuring the reactor's plutonium production rate.

===Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein effect===

Neutrinos traveling through matter, in general, undergo a process analogous to light traveling through a transparent material. This process is not directly observable because it does not produce ionizing radiation, but gives rise to the MSW effect. Only a small fraction of the neutrino's energy is transferred to the material.

===Nuclear reactions===

Neutrinos can interact with a nucleus, changing it to another nucleus. This process is used in radiochemical neutrino detectors. In this case, the energy levels and spin states within the target nucleus have to be taken into account to estimate the probability for an interaction. In general the interaction probability increases with the number of neutrons and protons within a nucleus.

===Induced fission===

Very much like neutrons do in nuclear reactors, neutrinos can induce fission reactions within heavy nuclei.[ref]
