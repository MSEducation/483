Rüppell's Vulture or Rüppell's Griffon Vulture (Gyps rueppellii) is a large vulture that occurs throughout the Sahel region of central Africa. The current population of 30,000 is decreasing due to loss of habitat and other factors. Known also as Rüppell's Griffon, Rueppell's Griffon, Rüppell's Griffin Vulture, Rueppell's Vulture and other variants, Rüppell's Vulture is named in honor of Eduard Rüppell, a 19th-century German explorer, collector, and zoologist.[tpl]cite book|last=Beolens|first=Bo|title=Whose Bird? Men and Women Commemorated in the Common Names of Birds|year=2003|publisher=Christopher Helm|location=London|page=294|coauthors=Watkins, Michael[/tpl] Rüppell's Vulture is considered to be the highest-flying bird, with confirmed evidence of a flight at an altitude of 11,300 m (37,000 ft) above sea level.

The base of the neck has a white collar, the eye is yellow or amber, the crop patch deep brown. Silent as a rule, they become vocal at their nest and when at a carcass, squealing a great deal.

==Ecology==

Rüppell's Vultures are very social, roosting, nesting, and gathering to feed in large flocks. They can travel fast when needed, cruising at as much as [tpl]convert|35|km/h[/tpl], and will fly as far as [tpl]convert|150|km|mi[/tpl] from a nest site to find food.
Rüppell's Vultures commonly fly at altitudes as high as [tpl]convert|6000|m[/tpl].[tpl]cn|date=February 2014[/tpl] The birds have a specialized variant of the hemoglobin alphaD subunit; this protein has a great affinity for oxygen, which allows the species to absorb oxygen efficiently despite the low partial pressure in the upper troposphere. A Rüppell's Vulture was confirmed to have been ingested by a jet engine of an airplane flying over Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire on November 29, 1973 at an altitude of 11,300 m (37,000 ft). During August 2010 a Rüppell's Vulture escaped a bird of prey site in Scotland, prompting warnings to pilots in the area to watch carefully due to the danger of collision.[tpl]cite web | last = Haines | first = Lester | url = http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/08/18/vulture_menace | title = Giant vulture menaces Scottish skies | publisher = TheRegister.co.uk | date = 2010-08-18 | accessdate = 2011-05-31 [/tpl]
Rüppell's Vultures have several adaptations to their diet and are specialized feeders even among the Old World vultures of Africa. They have an especially powerful build and, after the most attractive soft parts of a carcass have been consumed, they will continue with the hide, and even the bones, gorging themselves until they can barely fly. They have backward-pointing spines on the tongue to help remove meat from bone. Despite their size, power and adaptations, they are not the most dominant vulture in their range, which is considered to be the even larger Lappet-faced Vulture.http://vultures.homestead.com/Ruppells.html

==Status==

Since first being assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature during 1988, populations of Rüppell's Vulture have decreased. The species has been listed with an IUCN Red List status of "near threatened" since 2007 and the IUCN predicts that populations of the species will continue to decrease. During 2012 the species was given Endangered status.[tpl]cite web|title=Recently recategorised species|url=http://www.birdlife.org/action/science/species/global_species_programme/whats_new.html|publisher=Birdlife International (2012)|accessdate=15 June 2012[/tpl]
Since 1992, Rüppell's Vulture has been occurring as a vagrant in Spain and Portugal, with annual records since 1997, mainly in the Cadiz / Straits of Gibraltar area, but also further north.Gutiérrez, Ricard (2003) Occurrence of Rüppell's Griffon Vulture in Europe Dutch Birding 2595): 289-303
