Of Born to Die, indie music journal Drowned in Sound wrote, "She likes that whole hip hop thing though, has this whole swagger thing going that not many girls like her got," adding that it sounded like a poppier Bond soundtrack.[tpl]cite web|last=Nellis|first=Krystina|title=Lana Del Rey Born to Die Review|url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/16769/reviews/4144405?search|work=Drowned in Sound|accessdate=March 3, 2013|date=January 30, 2012[/tpl] In "National Anthem", "Off to the Races," and "Diet Mountain Dew", Del Rey employs this alternative rapping technique.[tpl]cite web|last=Zoladz|first=Lindsay|title=Lana Del Rey - Born to Die - Review|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16223-lana-del-rey/|work=Pitchfork Media|accessdate=December 2, 2012|date=January 30, 2012[/tpl] Under the stage name Lizzy Grant, she called her music "Hawaiian glam metal",[tpl]cite web|last=Tremblay|first=Brea|title=Lizzy Grant, 2008|url=http://www.indexmagazine.com/interviews/Lizzy_grant2.shtml|work=Index Magazine|publisher=Index Worldwide|accessdate=October 3, 2012[/tpl] while the work of her May Jailer project was acoustic.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/news/a384853/lana-del-reys-may-jailer-sirens-album-leaks-in-full.html|title=Lana Del Rey's May Jailer 'Sirens' album leaks in full|year=2012|work=Digital Spy|publisher=Hearst Magazines|accessdate=August 9, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.spinner.com/2012/05/31/lana-del-rey-may-jailer/|title=Spinner: Lana Del Rey, May Jailer: Did Singer Have ANOTHER Alter Ego?|date=May 31, 2012|work=Spinner|publisher=AOL|accessdate=August 9, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/lana-del-rey/64117|title=Another early album from Lana Del Rey leaks online?|date=June 1, 2012|work=NME|accessdate=August 9, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/77282/LISTEN-Unheard-Lana-Del-Rey-Album-Leaks-Online-|title=LISTEN: Unheard Lana Del Rey Album Leaks Online|year=2012|work=Entertainmentwise.com|accessdate=August 9, 2012[/tpl] Attributed to many genres, Del Rey's sound has been primarily linked to indie[tpl]cite web|last=Pannacione|first=Maggie|title=Watch Lana Del Rey Get Emotional While Performing "Video Games" in Ireland|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/watch-lana-del-rey-get-emotional-while-performing-video-games-in-ireland/10565612|work=Artistdirect|accessdate=June 6, 2013|date=June 3, 2013[/tpl] and baroque pop;[tpl]cite web|url=http://theneedledrop.com/2012/01/lana-del-rey-born-to-die-review/|title=Lana Del Rey- Born to Die|work=The Needle Drop|date=June 30, 2012 |accessdate=August 12, 2013|last=Fantano|first=Anthony[/tpl] experimenting with hip hop[tpl]cite web|last=Rice|first=Paul|title=Lana Del Rey's Feminist Problem|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2013/16/lana-del-reys-feminist-problem|work=Slant Magazine[tpl]![/tpl]Slant|accessdate=June 6, 2013|date=February 8, 2012[/tpl] and trip hop genres.[tpl]cite web|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|title=Born To Die - Album Reviews - Rolling Stone|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/born-to-die-20120130|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Wenner Media|accessdate=11 September 2013|date=30 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Abebe|first=Nitsuh|title=Lana Del Rey: Lurching Toward Vegas|url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/01/lana-del-rey-lurching-toward-vegas.html|work=Vulture (blog)[tpl]![/tpl]Vulture|publisher=New York (magazine)[tpl]![/tpl]New York|accessdate=11 September 2013|date=25 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Rytlewski|first=Evan|title=Lana Del Rey: Born To Die: Music Review|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/lana-del-rey-born-to-die,68365/|work=A.

Del Rey has appeared numerous times in PR photo-shoots and music videos adorned in gauzy dresses and floral headdresses; she has been recognized as being less flashy than other mainstream female pop singers. Lyrically, "Born to Die" was described as sad. Del Rey elaborates: "I'm not sad, I'm happy. I feel like I'm happy because I'm at peace with the way that things are... I did have a darker filter on sometimes, but that slowly lifted through doing a lot of different things. And finding true love is something that really did inspire me, lyrically. Because I felt so much the same for so much of my life and then when you find someone exciting, you don't know that you could actually feel differently than you did before. I was inspired." Del Rey writes her own lyrics, drawing on various experiences she had while living in New York City, and she has said that her lyrics "sound like stories".

===Voice and timbre===

Del Rey possesses an expansive contralto vocal range, which has been described as captivating and highly emotive, being able to transcend from sounding high and girlish in her timbre, down to a low and jazzy sound with great ease, although both these areas of the voice can be conflicting in the contrast of their sound, polarizing opinion.[tpl]cite web| url = http://entertainment.malaysia.msn.com/music/article.aspx?cp-documentid=5919180| title = Lana Del Rey – Born To Die, Review| publisher=MSN.

Del Rey stated the use of her lower vocals on the tracks from Born to Die, claiming that "people weren't taking me very seriously, so I lowered my voice, believing that it would help me stand out.

"I sing low now, but my voice used to be a lot higher. Because of the way I look, I needed something to ground the entire project. Otherwise I think people would assume I was some airhead singer. Well, I don't think... I know. I've sung one way, and sung another, and I've seen what people are drawn to", she said on the topic.

===Influences===

Amongst her musical influences, Del Rey cites several contemporary artists such as Elvis Presley, Antony and the Johnsons, Frank Sinatra, and Eminem.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/popnography/2011/08/first-look-lana-del-reys-video-games.html|date=August 8, 2011|last=Michelson|first=Noah|title=Look: Lana Del Rey's "Video Games"|work=Out|publisher=Joe Landry|accessdate=December 22, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://popcrush.com/lana-del-rey-love-eminem/ |title='I F—-ing Love Eminem'|date=February 1, 2012|publisher=Pop Crush |last=Sciarretto|first=Amy[/tpl] "really just like the masters of every genre", she told BBC radio presenter Jo Whiley.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtAFIa52_eA|title=Interview with Lana Del Rey|first=Jo |last=Whiley|publisher=BBC Radio 2.

Janis Joplin's live version of "Summertime" from the Cheap Thrills compilation album is one of Del Rey's favorite songs.

Her favorite films, The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, and American Beauty have also inspired her musical style.[tpl]cite news|last=Rosen|first=Christopher|title=Lana Del Rey's Movie Dreams: 'Hopefully I Will Branch Into Film Work And Stay There'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/04/lana-del-rey-movie_n_1854738.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=September 8, 2012|date=September 4, 2012[/tpl] Inspired by poetry, Del Rey cites Walt Whitman and Allen Ginsberg as instrumental to her songwriting. Specifically, she enjoys the chapbook "Leaves of Grass" by Whitman and a poem called "Howl" by Ginsberg. Her song, "Body Electric" from her third EP, Paradise, alludes to Whitman in the lyric, "Whitman is my daddy". The song's chorus of "I sing the body electric" is a direct reference to his poem "I Sing The Body Electric".[tpl]cite web|title=Lana Del Rey hates personal critics|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/showbiz/309071-lana-del-rey-hates-personal-critics/|work=STV (TV network)[tpl]![/tpl]STV|publisher=STV Group (Scotland)[tpl]![/tpl]STV Group plc|accessdate=October 5, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Moore|first=Alex|title=Here's Lana Del Rey's new Walt Whitman-referencing track, 'The Body Electric'|url=http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/184151/heres-lana-del-reys-new-walt-whitman-referencing-track-the-body-electric/|work=Death and Taxes|accessdate=October 5, 2012[/tpl] She recited Whitman's poem "Song of Myself" for the French fashion magazine, L'Officiel Paris.

==Personal life==

Del Rey stated that she has suffered from alcohol dependence. At the age of 15, she was sent to Kent School, a boarding school in Connecticut, for three years to get sober. In September 2012, she told GQ magazine:
[tpl]quote|I was a big drinker at the time. I would drink every day. I would drink alone. I thought the whole concept was so fucking cool. A great deal of what I wrote on Born To Die is about these wilderness years. When I write about the thing that I've lost I feel like I'm writing about alcohol because that was the first love of my life. My parents were worried, I was worried. I knew it was a problem when I liked it more than I liked doing anything else. I was like, 'I'm fucked. I am totally fucked'. Like, at first it's fine and you think you have a dark side – it's exciting – and then you realise the dark side wins every time if you decide to indulge in it. It's also a completely different way of living when you know that...a different species of person. It was the worst thing that ever happened to me.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2200512/Lana-Del-Rey-comfortable-skin-strips-nude-GQ-shoot.html?ito=feeds-newsxml|title=No clothing needed!
