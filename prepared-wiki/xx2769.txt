The European Parliament is elected every five years by EU citizens.
The EU traces its origins from the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), formed by the Inner Six countries in 1951 and 1958, respectively. In the intervening years, the community and its successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit. The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union under its current name in 1993. The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009.
The EU has developed a single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. Within the Schengen Area passport controls have been abolished.[tpl]cite web |title=Schengen area|publisher=Europa web portal |url=http://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/borders/borders_schengen_en.htm|accessdate=8 September 2010[/tpl] EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital,[tpl]cite web|title=The EU Single Market: Fewer barriers, more opportunities|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm|accessdate=27 September 2007[/tpl] [tpl]cite web|title=Activities of the European Union: Internal Market|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://europa.eu/pol/singl/index_en.htm|accessdate=29 June 2007[/tpl] enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade,[tpl]cite web|title=Common commercial policy|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/commercial_policy_en.htm|work=Europa Glossary|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=6 September 2008[/tpl] agriculture,[tpl]cite web|publisher=The Council of the European Union|title=Agriculture and Fisheries Council|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/policies/council-configurations/agriculture-and-fisheries|accessdate=3 June 2013[/tpl] fisheries, and regional development.[tpl]cite web|title=Regional Policy Inforegio |url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/index_en.cfm|publisher=Europa web portal |accessdate=3 June 2013[/tpl]
The monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002.  It is currently composed of 18 member states that use the euro as their legal tender. Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the EU has developed a role in external relations and defence. The union maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the United Nations, the WTO, the G8, and the G-20.

In 1957, the six countries signed the Treaty of Rome, which extended the earlier co-operation within the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and created the European Economic Community (EEC), establishing a customs union. They also signed another treaty on the same day creating the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for co-operation in developing nuclear energy. Both treaties came into force in 1958.
The EEC and Euratom were created separately from ECSC, although they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly. The executives of the new communities were called Commissions, as opposed to the "High Authority". The EEC was headed by Walter Hallstein (Hallstein Commission) and Euratom was headed by Louis Armand (Armand Commission) and then Étienne Hirsch. Euratom would integrate sectors in nuclear energy while the EEC would develop a customs union between members.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/a_european_atomic_energy_community-en-19bc7f11-bea1-49c7-b534-18327c303f41.html |title=A European Atomic Energy Community |publisher=Cvce.eu |date=1997-10-13 |accessdate=2013-10-13[/tpl]A European Customs Union
Throughout the 1960s, tensions began to show with France seeking to limit supranational power. However, in 1965 an agreement was reached and hence in 1967 the Merger Treaty was signed in Brussels. It came into force on 1 July 1967 and created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the European Communities (EC), although commonly just as the European Community.[tpl]cite web|title=Merging the executives|publisher=CVCE – Centre Virtuel de la Connaissance sur l'Europe|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/merging_the_executives-en-575850b6-f472-406a-936d-8c08a9e0db32.html|accessdate=28 April 2013[/tpl]Merging the executives CVCE.eu Jean Rey presided over the first merged Commission (Rey Commission).Discover the former Presidents: The Rey Commission, Europa (web portal).

On 1 December 2009, the Lisbon Treaty entered into force and reformed many aspects of the EU. In particular, it changed the legal structure of the European Union, merging the EU three pillars system into a single legal entity provisioned with a legal personality, created a permanent President of the European Council, the first of which was Herman Van Rompuy, and strengthened the High Representative, Catherine Ashton.[tpl]cite web|url=http://government.zdnet.com/?p=6266|title=European Parliament announces new President and Foreign Affairs Minister|accessdate=1 December 2009[/tpl]

Including the overseas territories of France which are located outside of the continent of Europe, but which are members of the union, the EU experiences most types of climate from Arctic (North-East Europe) to tropical (French Guyana), rendering meteorological averages for the EU as a whole meaningless. The majority of the population lives in areas with a temperate maritime climate (North-Western Europe and Central Europe), a Mediterranean climate (Southern Europe), or a warm summer continental or hemiboreal climate (Northern Balkans and Central Europe).[tpl]cite web|title=Humid Continental Climate |work=The physical environment |publisher=University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point |year=2007 |url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/humid_continental.html |accessdate=29 June 2007[/tpl]
The EU's population is highly urbanised, with some 75% of inhabitants (and growing, projected to be 90% in 7 states by 2020) living in urban areas. Cities are largely spread out across the EU, although with a large grouping in and around the Benelux. An increasing percentage of this is due to low density urban sprawl which is extending into natural areas. In some cases this urban growth has been due to the influx of EU funds into a region.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/eea_report_2006_10/eea_report_10_2006.pdf |title=Urban sprawl in Europe: The ignored challenge, European Environmental Agency |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-10-13[/tpl]

Through successive enlargements, the Union has grown from the six founding states — Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands — to the current [tpl]EUnum[/tpl]. Countries accede to the union by becoming party to the founding treaties, thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership. This entails a partial delegation of sovereignty to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions, a practice often referred to as "pooling of sovereignty".Answers.com[tpl]cite web|title=EU institutions and other bodies|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/index_en.htm|publisher=Europa|accessdate=4 September 2009[/tpl]
To become a member, a country must meet the Copenhagen criteria, defined at the 1993 meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen. These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law; a functioning market economy; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the European Council.[tpl]cite web|title=Accession criteria (Copenhagen criteria)|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/accession_criteria_copenhague_en.htm|accessdate=26 June 2007[/tpl]  No member state has ever left the Union, although Greenland (an autonomous province of Denmark) withdrew in 1985.[tpl]cite web |title=The Greenland Treaty of 1985 |work=The European Union and Greenland |publisher=Greenland Home Rule Government |url=http://eu.nanoq.gl/Emner/EuGl/The%20Greenland%20Treaty.aspx |accessdate=10 November 2010[/tpl] The Lisbon Treaty now contains a clause providing for a member to leave the EU.Article 50 of the Consolidated Treaty on European Union.

However, on 13 June 2013, Iceland's Foreign Minister, Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson, informed the European Commission that the newly elected government intended to "put negotiations on hold".[tpl]cite web |url=http://euobserver.com/political/120501 |title=Iceland's EU bid is over, commission told |last=Fox |first=Benjamin |publisher=Reuters |date=16 June 2013 |accessdate=16 June 2013[/tpl] Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo are officially recognised as a potential candidates,[tpl]cite web|title=European Commission – Enlargement – Candidate and Potential Candidate Countries|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/countries/index_en.htm |accessdate=13 March 2012[/tpl] but only Albania has submitted a membership application.  Due to the lack of recognition by five of the 28 EU member states, the European Commission refers only to "Kosovo*", with an asterisked footnote containing the text agreed to by the Belgrade–Pristina negotiations: "This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence."
Four countries forming the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) (that are not EU members) have partly committed to the EU's economy and regulations: Iceland (a candidate country for EU membership), Liechtenstein and Norway, which are a part of the single market through the European Economic Area, and Switzerland, which has similar ties through bilateral treaties.[tpl]cite web|title=The EU's relations with Switzerland|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/switzerland/index_en.htm|accessdate=3 November 2010[/tpl] The relationships of the European microstates, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and the Vatican include the use of the euro and other areas of co-operation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/world/outside_euro_area/index_en.htm|title=Use of the euro in the world|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|work=The euro outside the euro area|accessdate=27 February 2008[/tpl]

==Politics==

The EU operates within those competencies conferred on it by the treaties and according to the principle of subsidiarity (which dictates that action by the EU should only be taken where an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states alone). Laws made by the EU institutions are passed in a variety of forms. Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures and those which specifically require national implementation measures.These groups refer to regulations and directives respectively. These legislative instruments are dealt with in more detail below.

===Constitutional nature===

The classification of the European Union in terms of international or constitutional law has been much debated, often in the light of the degree of integration that is perceived, desired, or expected. Historically, at least, the EU is an international organisation, and by some criteria, it could be classified as a confederation; but it also has many attributes of a federation, so some would classify it as a (de facto) federation of states.[tpl]cite book| editor1-last = Wiener| editor1-first = Antje| editor2-last = Diez| editor2-first = Thomas| title = European Integration Theory|chapter=Federalism|first=Michael|last=Burgess| pages =25–42| year = 2009| origyear = 2004|edition=2nd| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-922609-2[/tpl][ref]

Signals from The White Paper on European Governance |accessdate = 18 November 2012|quote=... we see the notions of governance deployed in the White Paper as undermining the description of the EU as sui generis. It is becoming like a national state, but we differ from many of the critics (or enthusiasts) of the White Paper in one major way. Rather than seeing the EU becoming a state-like object, taking on the trappings of a 19th – or more correctly 20th – century state, we see national states moving towards the EU, adopting many of the governing practices advocated by the White Paper. [/tpl]
The organisation itself has traditionally used the terms "community", and later "union". The difficulties of classification involve the difference between national law (where the subjects of the law include natural persons and corporations) and international law (where the subjects include sovereign states and international organisations); they can also be seen in the light of differing European and American constitutional traditions.
Especially in terms of the European constitutional tradition, the term federation is equated with a sovereign federal state in international law; so the EU cannot be called a federal state or federation—at least, not without qualification. Though not, strictly, a federation, it is more than a free-trade association.[tpl]cite web| url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ee.html| title = European Union| work = CIA World Factbook| accessdate = 18 November 2012|quote=Although the EU is not a federation in the strict sense, it is far more than a free-trade association such as ASEAN, NAFTA, or Mercosur, and it has certain attributes associated with independent nations: its own flag, currency (for some members), and law-making abilities, as well as diplomatic representation and a common foreign and security policy in its dealings with external partners. [/tpl] It is, however, described as being based on a federal model or federal in nature. Walter Hallstein, in the original German edition of Europe in the Making called it "an unfinished federal state".[tpl]cite book| others=translated by Charles Roetter| title = Europe in the Making | trans_title = translation of Der unvollendete Bundesstaat|first1=Walter|last1=Hallstein| year = 1972| origyear = 1969|edition=English| publisher = George Allen & Unwin| isbn = 978-0-19-922609-2[/tpl]
The German Constitutional Court refers to the European Union as an association of sovereign states and affirms that making the EU a federation would require replacement of the German constitution.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/en/press/bvg09-072en.html |title= Federal Constitutional Court Press Release No. 72/2009 of 30 June 2009.

The peoples of the Member States are the holders of the constituent power. The Basic Law does not permit the special bodies of the legislative, executive and judicial power to dispose of the essential elements of the constitution, i.e. of the constitutional identity (Article 23.1 sentence 3, Article 79.3 GG). The constitutional identity is an inalienable element of the democratic self-determination of a people.[/tpl]  The original German uses the word Staatenverbund, which they translate as "association of sovereign states", rather than the word Staatenbund (confederation) or Bundesstaat (federation).
Others claim that it will not develop into a federal state but has reached maturity as an international organisation.[tpl]cite book| editor1-last = Wiener| editor1-first = Antje| editor2-last = Diez| editor2-first = Thomas| title = European Integration Theory|chapter=Liberal Intergovernmentalism|first1=Andrew|last1=Moravcsik|first2=Andrew|last2=Moravcsik|quote=Every constitutional system reaches a point where it is mature, where it no longer needs to move forward to remain stable.

===Governance===

The European Union has seven institutions: the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union, the European Commission, the European Council, the European Central Bank, the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Auditors. Competencies in scrutinising and amending legislation are divided between the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union while executive tasks are carried out by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union). The monetary policy of the eurozone is governed by the European Central Bank. The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors. There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area.

====European Council====

The European Council gives direction to the EU, and convenes at least four times a year. It comprises the President of the European Council, the President of the European Commission and one representative per member state; either its head of state or head of government. The European Council has been described by some as the Union's "supreme political authority".[tpl]cite web|title=How does the EU work|publisher=Europa (web portal)|url=http://europa.eu/abc/12lessons/lesson_4/index_en.htm|accessdate=12 July 2007[/tpl] It is actively involved in the negotiation of the treaty changes and defines the EU's policy agenda and strategies.
The European Council uses its leadership role to sort out disputes between member states and the institutions, and to resolve political crises and disagreements over controversial issues and policies. It acts externally as a "collective head of state" and ratifies important documents (for example, international agreements and treaties).With US or against US?: European trends in American perspective Parsons, Jabko. European Union Studies Association, p.146: Fourth, the European Council acts a "collective head of state" for the EU.
On 19 November 2009, Herman Van Rompuy was chosen as the first permanent President of the European Council. On 1 December 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force and he assumed office. Ensuring the external representation of the EU,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/111298.pdf|title=President of the European Council|accessdate=24 November 2009|date=24 November 2009|format=PDF|publisher=General Secretariat of the Council of the EU[/tpl] driving consensus and settling divergences among members are tasks for the President both during the convocations of the European Council and in the time periods between them. The European Council should not be mistaken for the Council of Europe, an international organisation independent from the EU.

====Commission====

The European Commission acts as the EU's executive arm and is responsible for initiating legislation and the day-to-day running of the EU. The Commission is also seen as the motor of European integration. It operates as a cabinet government, with 28 Commissioners for different areas of policy, one from each member state, though Commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state.
One of the 28 is the Commission President (currently José Manuel Durão Barroso) appointed by the European Council. After the President, the most prominent Commissioner is the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy who is ex-officio Vice-President of the Commission and is chosen by the European Council too.Treaty on European Union: Article 17:7 The other 25 Commissioners are subsequently appointed by the Council of the European Union in agreement with the nominated President. The 28 Commissioners as a single body are subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament.

====Parliament====

The European Parliament forms one half of the EU's legislature (the other half is the Council of the European Union, see below). The 736 (soon to be 751) Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are directly elected by EU citizens every five years on the basis of proportional representation. Although MEPs are elected on a national basis, they sit according to political groups rather than their nationality. Each country has a set number of seats and is divided into sub-national constituencies where this does not affect the proportional nature of the voting system.[tpl]cite web|author=Wellfire Interactive |url=http://www.fairvote.org/european-parliament-to-be-elected-with-proportional-representation-systems |title=MEPs must be elected on the basis of proportional representation, the threshold must not exceed 5%, and the electoral area may be subdivided in constituencies if this will not generally affect the proportional nature of the voting system |publisher=Fairvote.org |accessdate=26 November 2010[/tpl] thumb|upright|The ordinary legislative procedure of the European Union.
The Parliament and the Council of the European Union pass legislation jointly in nearly all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure. This also applies to the EU budget. Finally, the Commission is accountable to Parliament, requiring its approval to take office, having to report back to it and subject to motions of censure from it. The President of the European Parliament carries out the role of speaker in parliament and represents it externally. The EP President and Vice-Presidents are elected by MEPs every two and a half years.[tpl]cite web|title=Institutions: The European Parliament|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/parliament/index_en.htm|accessdate=25 June 2007[/tpl]

====Council====

The Council of the European Union (also called the "Council"The Latin word consilium is occasionally used when a single identifier is required, as on the Council Web site and sometimes referred to as the "Council of Ministers")[tpl]cite web |url=http://europa.eu/pol/inst/index_en.htm |title=Institutional affairs: Council of the European Union |date=6 January 2010 |work=Europa |publisher=European Commission |quote=It is commonly called the Council of Ministers[/tpl] forms the other half of the EU's legislature. It consists of a government minister from each member state and meets in different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed. Notwithstanding its different configurations, it is considered to be one single body.[tpl]cite web|title=Institutions: The Council of the European Union|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm|accessdate=25 June 2007[/tpl] In addition to its legislative functions, the Council also exercises executive functions in relations to the Common Foreign and Security Policy.

===Budget===

The EU had an agreed budget of €120.7 billion for the year 2007 and €864.3 billion for the period 2007–2013,[tpl]cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/06/204&format=HTML|title=Q&A on Interinstitutional Agreement on Budgetary Discipline and Sound Financial Management 2007–2013[/tpl] representing 1.10% and 1.05% of the EU-27's GNI forecast for the respective periods. By comparison, the United Kingdom's expenditure for 2004 was estimated to be €759 billion, and France was estimated to have spent €801 billion. In 1960, the budget of the then European Economic Community was 0.03% of GDP.[tpl]cite book |first1=David |publisher=Profile Books |place=London |year=1999 |isbn=1-86197-102-8 |author=David Smith. |title=Will Europe work?[/tpl]
In the 2010 budget of €141.5 billion, the largest single expenditure item is "cohesion & competitiveness" with around 45% of the total budget.[tpl]cite web|title=EU Budget in detail 2010|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|format=PDF|url=http://ec.europa.eu/budget/budget_detail/current_year_en.htm|accessdate=20 December 2010[/tpl] Next comes "agriculture" with approximately 31% of the total. "Rural development, environment and fisheries" takes up around 11%. "Administration" accounts for around 6%. The "EU as a global partner" and "citizenship, freedom, security and justice" bring up the rear with approximately 6% and 1% respectively.
The Court of Auditors aims to ensure that the budget of the European Union has been properly accounted for. The court provides an audit report for each financial year to the Council and the European Parliament. The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the Commission's handling of the budget. The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions.[tpl]cite web|title=Institutions: Court of Auditors|publisher=Europa (web portal)|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/auditors/index_en.htm|accessdate=8 February 2010[/tpl]
The Court of Auditors is legally obliged to provide the Parliament and the Council with "a statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions".Article 287 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (ex Article 248 TEC). The Court has refused to do so every year since 1993, qualifying their report of the Union's accounts every year since then.[tpl]Cite news |title= Auditors provide critical assessment of EU accounts |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/europe-24819085 |accessdate= 5 November 2013 |work= Democracy Live |publisher =BBC |date= 5 November 2013 [/tpl] In their report on 2009 the auditors found that five areas of Union expenditure, agriculture and the cohesion fund, were materially affected by error.[tpl]cite web |url=http://eca.europa.eu/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/5926723.PDF |title=Annual Report of the Court of Auditors on the implementation of the budget concerning the financial year 2009, together with the institutions' replies |page=12 |accessdate=18 December 2010[/tpl] The European Commission estimated [tpl]when|date=June 2013[/tpl] that the financial impact of irregularities was €1,863 million.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/reports/commission/2009/en.pdf |title=Protection of the European Union's financial interests – Fight against fraud – Annual Report 2009 (vid. pp. 6, 15) |publisher=Europa |accessdate=22 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl]

===Competences===

EU member states retain all powers not explicitly handed to the European Union. In some areas the EU enjoys exclusive competence. These are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation. In other areas the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate. While both can legislate, member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not. In other policy areas the EU can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/consumers/events/2009/index.html|title=Competences and consumers|accessdate=25 November 2010[/tpl]
That a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what legislative procedure is used for enacting legislation within that policy area. Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence, and even with the same policy area.
The distribution of competences in various policy areas between Member States and the Union is divided in the following three categories:

==Legal system==

The EU is based on a series of treaties. These first established the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties.[tpl]cite web|title=Sources of EU law|url=http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/general_information/legal_information_and_eu_law/sources_eu_law/index_en.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228193407/http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/general_information/legal_information_and_eu_law/sources_eu_law/index_en.htm|archivedate=28 February 2008|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=5 September 2007[/tpl] These are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals. These legal powers include the ability to enact legislationSee Article 288 (ex Article 249 TEC) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on eur-lex.europa.eu which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants.According to the principle of Direct Effect first invoked in the Court of Justice's decision in [tpl]cite court|litigants=Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen|reporter=Eur-Lex|court=European Court of Justice|year=1963|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:NOT[/tpl] See: Craig and de Búrca, ch. 5. The EU has legal personality, with the right to sign agreements and international treaties.[tpl]cite journal |editor1-first=Philippe |author2=lastAndoura |author1-link=de Schoutheete |first2=Sami |title=The Legal Personality of the European Union |journal=Studia Diplomatica |volume=LX |year=2007 |issue=1 |url=http://aei.pitt.edu/9083/01/Legal.Personality.EU-PDS-SA.pdf |accessdate=15 November 2010[/tpl] Its examples are the ratifications of United Nations Convention against Corruption and Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by EU. And Article 47 of the Consolidated Treaty on European Union.
Under the principle of supremacy, national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified, and thus the laws enacted under them, even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law, and (within limits) even constitutional provisions.According to the principle of Supremacy as established by the ECJ in Case 6/64, Falminio Costa v. ENEL 1964 ECR 585. See Craig and de Búrca, ch. 7. See also: Factortame litigation: Factortame Ltd. v. Secretary of State for Transport (No. 2) 1991 1 AC 603, Solange II (Re Wuensche Handelsgesellschaft, BVerfG decision of 22 October 1986 1987 3 CMLR 225,265) and Frontini v. Ministero delle Finanze 1974 2 CMLR 372; Raoul George Nicolo 1990 1 CMLR 173.

===Courts of Justice===

The judicial branch of the EU—formally called the Court of Justice of the European Union—consists of three courts: the Court of Justice, the General Court, and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal. Together they interpret and apply the treaties and the law of the EU.[tpl]cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF |title=Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union |publisher=eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=31 October 2010[/tpl]
The Court of Justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states, the institutions, and cases referred to it by the courts of member states.[tpl]cite web |title=Court of Justice: presentation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7024/#competences |publisher=Europa web portal |accessdate=26 December 2009[/tpl] The General Court mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the EU's courts,[tpl]cite web |title=General Court: presentation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7033/#compet |publisher=Europa web portal |accessdate=26 December 2009[/tpl] and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal adjudicates in disputes between the European Union and its civil service.[tpl]cite web |title=Civil Service Tribunal: presentation |url=http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/T5_5230/#compétence |publisher=Europa web portal |accessdate=26 December 2009[/tpl] Decisions from the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice but only on a point of law.Article 256(1) (ex article 225(1)) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on eur-lex.europa.eu

===Fundamental rights===

The treaties declare that the EU itself is "founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities ... in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail."Article 2, Treaty on European Union (consolidated 1 December 2009)
In 2009 the Lisbon Treaty gave legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The charter is a codified catalogue of fundamental rights against which the EU's legal acts can be judged. It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the "constitutional traditions common to the member states."Case 11/70, Internationale Handelsgesellschaft v. Einfuhr und Vorratstelle für Getreide und Futtermittel; Article 6(2) of the Maastricht Treaty (as amended). The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has, on occasion, invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights.[tpl]cite web |title=Respect for fundamental rights in the EU – general development |publisher=The European Parliament |work=European Parliament Fact Sheets |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/2_1_1_en.htm |accessdate=6 September 2008[/tpl] The Charter of Fundamental Rights was drawn up in 2000. Although originally not legally binding the Charter was frequently cited by the EU's courts as encapsulating rights which the courts had long recognised as the fundamental principles of EU law.
Although signing the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership,It is effectively treated as one of the Copenhagen criteria, Assembly.coe.int. It should be noted that this is a political and not a legal requirement for membership. previously, the EU itself could not accede to the Convention as it is neither a stateThe European Convention on Human Rights was previously only open to members of the Council of Europe (Article 59.1 of the Convention), and even now only states may become member of the Council of Europe (Article 4 of the Statute of the Council of Europe). nor had the competence to accede.Opinion (2/92) of the European Court of Justice on "Accession by the Community to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms" 1996 E.C.R. I-1759 (in French), ruled that the European Community did not have the competence to accede to the ECHR. The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this: the former binds the EU to accede to the Convention while the latter formally permits it.
Although, the EU is independent from Council of Europe, they share purpose and ideas especially on rule of law, human rights and democracy. Further European Convention on Human Rights and European Social Charter, the source of law of Charter of Fundamental Rights are created by Council of Europe. The EU also promoted human rights issues in the wider world. The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition. Abolition of the death penalty is a condition for EU membership.[tpl]cite web|title=EU Policy on Death Penalty|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/human_rights/adp/index_en.htm|work=Europa|publisher=European Union External Action Service|accessdate=4 June 2013[/tpl]

===Acts===

The main legal acts of the EU come in three forms: regulations, directives, and decisions. Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures,See: Case 34/73, Variola v. Amministrazione delle Finanze  ECR 981. and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions. Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states.To do otherwise would require the drafting of legislation which would have to cope with the frequently divergent legal systems and administrative systems of all of the now 28 member states. See Craig and de Búrca, p. 115 When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have direct effect in national law against member states.
Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state. They are most often used in competition law, or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions. Regulations, directives, and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|title=How EU takes decisions|accessdate=November 2010[/tpl]

==Justice and home affairs==

Since the creation of the EU in 1993, it has developed its competencies in the area of justice and home affairs, initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism. To this end, agencies have been established that co-ordinate associated actions: Europol for co-operation of police forces,[tpl]cite web|title=European police office now in full swing|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/police/europol/fsj_police_europol_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007[/tpl] Eurojust for co-operation between prosecutors,[tpl]cite web|title=Eurojust coordinating cross-border prosecutions at EU level|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/eurojust/fsj_criminal_eurojust_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007[/tpl] and Frontex for co-operation between border control authorities.[tpl]cite web|title=What is Frontex?|url=http://www.frontex.europa.eu/|author=Frontex|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007[/tpl] The EU also operates the Schengen Information System which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities. This co-operation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the Schengen Agreement and the associated cross border crime.
Furthermore, the Union has legislated in areas such as extradition,[tpl]cite web|title=European arrest warrant replaces extradition between EU Member States|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/extradition/fsj_criminal_extradition_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007[/tpl] family law,[tpl]cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_civil_matters/l33194_en.htm|title=Jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility (Brussels II)|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=5 September 2008[/tpl] asylum law,[tpl]cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33150_en.htm|title=Minimum standards on the reception of applicants for asylum in Member States|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=5 September 2008[/tpl] and criminal justice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_criminal_matters/l10110_en.htm|title=Specific Programme: 'Criminal Justice'|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=5 September 2008[/tpl] Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties.See Articles 157 (ex Article 141) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on eur-lex.europa.eu In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation.See Article 2(7) of the Amsterdam Treaty on eur-lex.europa.eu By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on sexual discrimination in the work-place, age discrimination, and racial discrimination.Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (OJ L 180, 19 July 2000, p. 22–26); Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (OJ L 303, 2.12.2000, p. 16–22).

==Foreign relations==

Foreign policy co-operation between member states dates from the establishment of the Community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the Common Commercial policy.[tpl]cite web|title=Qualified-Majority Voting: Common commercial policy|url=http://ec.europa.eu/archives/igc2000/geninfo/fact-sheets/fact-sheet6/index_en.htm|accessdate=3 September 2007|publisher=Europa web portal[/tpl] Steps for a more wide ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of European Political Cooperation which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. It was not, however, until 1987 when European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the Single European Act. EPC was renamed as the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) by the Maastricht Treaty.[tpl]cite web|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/european_political_cooperation_en.htm|title=European political co-operation (EPC)|accessdate=3 September 2007|publisher=Europa web portal|author=The European commission|work=Europa Glossary[/tpl]
The aims of the CFSP are to promote both the EU's own interests and those of the international community as a whole, including the furtherance of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union (as inserted by the Treaty of Lisbon), on eur-lex.europa.eu The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue. The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which occurred over the war in Iraq[tpl]cite news|title=Divided EU agrees Iraq statement|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=27 January 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2697667.stm|accessdate=13 March 2009[/tpl]
The coordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (currently Catherine Ashton) who speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters, and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment.

Besides the emerging international policy of the European Union, the international influence of the EU is also felt through enlargement. The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU's accession criteria, and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of European formerly Communist countries.[tpl]cite journal |title=Enlargement, reform and the European Commission.

Following the Kosovo War in 1999, the European Council agreed that "the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO".

===Humanitarian aid===

The European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office, or "ECHO", provides humanitarian aid from the EU to developing countries. In 2006, its budget amounted to €671 million, 48% of which went to the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.[tpl]cite web|title=DG for humanitarian aid – ECHO, financial report 2006|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|year=2006|url=http://ec.europa.eu/echo/pdf_files/financial_report.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307042553/http://ec.europa.eu/echo/pdf_files/financial_report.pdf|archivedate=7 March 2008|accessdate=13 August 2007[/tpl]
Humanitarian aid is financed directly by the budget (70%) as part of the financial instruments for external action and also by the European Development Fund (30%).Mikaela Gavas 2010. Financing European development cooperation: the Financial Perspectives 2014–2020. London: Overseas Development Institute The EU's external action financing is divided into 'geographic' instruments and 'thematic' instruments. The 'geographic' instruments provide aid through the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI, €16.9 billion, 2007–2013), which must spend 95% of its budget on overseas development assistance (ODA), and from the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), which contains some relevant programmes. The European Development Fund (EDF, €22.7 bn, 2008–2013) is made up of voluntary contributions by member states, but there is pressure to merge the EDF into the budget-financed instruments to encourage increased contributions to match the 0.7% target and allow the European Parliament greater oversight.

==Economy==

The EU has established a single market across the territory of all its members. 17 member states have also joined a monetary union known as the eurozone, which uses the Euro as a single currency. In 2012, the EU had a combined GDP of 16.073 trillions international dollars, a 20% share of the global gross domestic product (in terms of purchasing power parity).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2013/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=39&pr.y=13&sy=2013&ey=2013&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=998&s=NGDPD%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC&grp=1&a=1 |date=October 2013 |title=World Economic Outlook Database, October 2013 Edition |publisher=International Monetary Fund[/tpl] According to Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report 2012 (September), the EU owns the largest net wealth in the world; it is estimated to equal 30% of the $223 trillion global wealth.
Of the top 500 largest corporations measured by revenue (Fortune Global 500 in 2010), 161 have their headquarters in the EU.[tpl]cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/2010/countries/Australia.html|title=Global 500 2010: Countries – Australia|work=Fortune|accessdate=8 July 2010[/tpl] Number of companies data taken from the "Pick a country" box.

There is a significant variance for GDP (PPP) per capita within individual EU states, these range from €11,300 to €69,800 (about US$15,700 to US$97,000). The difference between the richest and poorest regions (271 NUTS-2 regions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) ranged, in 2009, from 27% of the EU27 average in the region of Severozapaden in Bulgaria, to 332% of the average in Inner London in the United Kingdom. On the high end, Inner London has €78,000 PPP per capita, Luxembourg €62,500, and Bruxelles-Cap €52,500, while the poorest regions, are Severozapaden with €6,400 PPP per capita, Nord-Est with €6,900 PPP per capita, Severen tsentralen with €6,900 and Yuzhen tsentralen with €7,200.

===Internal market===

Two of the original core objectives of the European Economic Community were the development of a common market, subsequently renamed the single market, and a customs union between its member states. The single market involves the free circulation of goods, capital, people, and services within the EU,[tpl]cite web|title=The Single Market|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm|accessdate=27 June 2007[/tpl] and the customs union involves the application of a common external tariff on all goods entering the market. Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or import quotas, as they travel internally. The non-EU member states of Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland participate in the single market but not in the customs union.[tpl]cite web |url=http://eeas.europa.eu/eea/ |title=The European Economic Area (EEA) |publisher=Europa web portal |author=European Commission |accessdate=10 February 2010[/tpl] Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU.[tpl]cite web|title=A Single Market for goods|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_18_en.htm|accessdate=27 June 2007[/tpl]
Free movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries.[tpl]cite web|title=A Single Market for Capital|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_42_en.htm|accessdate=27 June 2007[/tpl] Until the drive towards economic and monetary union the development of the capital provisions had been slow. Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom. The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states.
The free movement of persons means that EU citizens can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country. This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states.[tpl]cite web|title=Living and working in the Single Market|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_15_en.htm|author=European Commission|accessdate=27 June 2007[/tpl]
The free movement of services and of establishment allows self-employed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis. While services account for 60–70% of GDP, legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas. This lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed Directive on services in the internal market which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services.[tpl]cite web |title=A Single Market for Services |publisher=Europa |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/top_layer/index_19_en.htm |author=European Commission |accessdate=27 June 2007[/tpl] According to the Treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised.

===Competition===

The EU operates a competition policy intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single market.Article 3(1)(g) of the Treaty of Rome The Commission as the competition regulator for the single market is responsible for antitrust issues, approving mergers, breaking up cartels, working for economic liberalisation and preventing state aid.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Europa web portal|title=Competition: making markets work better|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/index_en.html|accessdate=12 November 2007[/tpl]

===Monetary union===

The creation of a European single currency became an official objective of the European Economic Community in 1969. However, it was only with the advent of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993 that member states were legally bound to start the monetary union no later than 1 January 1999. On this date the euro was duly launched by eleven of the then 15 member states of the EU. It remained an accounting currency until 1 January 2002, when euro notes and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone, which by then consisted of 12 member states. The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 18 countries, the most recent being Latvia which joined on 1 January 2014.
All other EU member states, except Denmark and the United Kingdom, are legally bound to join the euro[tpl]cite news |title=Almunia says 'undesirable' to act on Sweden's euro refusal |first1=Teresa |last1=Kuchler |publisher=EUobserver.com |date=25 October 2006 |url=http://euobserver.com/9/22733 |accessdate=26 December 2006[/tpl] when the convergence criteria are met, however only a few countries have set target dates for accession.

The euro is designed to help build a single market by, for example: easing travel of citizens and goods, eliminating exchange rate problems, providing price transparency, creating a single financial market, price stability and low interest rates, and providing a currency used internationally and protected against shocks by the large amount of internal trade within the eurozone.

The European System of Financial Supervisors is an institutional architecture of the EU's framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities: the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority. To complement this framework, there is also a European Systemic Risk Board under the responsibility of the ECB.

===Energy===

In 2006, the EU-27 had a gross inland energy consumption of 1,825 million tonnes of oil equivalent (toe). Around 46% of the energy consumed was produced within the member states while 54% was imported. In these statistics, nuclear energy is treated as primary energy produced in the EU, regardless of the source of the uranium, of which less than 3% is produced in the EU.[tpl]cite book|title=Euratom Supply Agency—Annual Report 2007|url=http://ec.europa.eu/euratom/ar/last.pdf|accessdate=1 March 2009|year=2008|publisher=Office for Official Publications of the European Communities|location=Luxembourg|isbn=978-92-79-09437-8|page=22|format=PDF|chapter=EU supply and demand for nuclear fuels|quote=European uranium mining supplied just below 3% of the total EU needs, coming from the Czech Republic and Romania (a total of 526 tU).[/tpl]   Nuclear energy and renewable energy are treated differently from oil, gas , and coal in this respect.
The EU has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence; this has its roots in the original European Coal and Steel Community. The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the European Council in October 2005, and the first draft policy was published in January 2007.[tpl]cite news |title=Q&A: EU energy plans |publisher=BBC |date=9 March 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4783996.stm |accessdate=13 July 2007[/tpl]

===Agriculture===

The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is one of the oldest policies of the European Community, and was one of its core aims.[tpl]cite web|last=Stead|first=David|coauthors=Robert Whaples (eds)|title=Common Agricultural Policy|publisher=EH.Net Encyclopedia|date=22 June 2007|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/common-agricultural-policy/|accessdate=30 August 2007[/tpl] The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production, providing certainty in food supplies, ensuring a high quality of life for farmers, stabilising markets, and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers.Article 39 (ex Article 33) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on eur-lex.europa.eu It was, until recently, operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention. Until the 1990s, the policy accounted for over 60% of the then European Community's annual budget, and still accounts for around 34%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://europa.eu/pol/agr/index_en.htm|title=Agriculture: Meeting the needs of farmers and consumers |date=26 August 2011|work=Europa: Gateway to the European Union|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=4 November 2011|quote=... the common agricultural policy is the most integrated of all EU policies and consequently takes a large share of the EU budget. Nevertheless, its portion of the EU budget has dropped from a peak of nearly 70% in the 1970s to 34% over the 2007–2013 period.[/tpl][tpl]Update after|2014[/tpl]
The policy's price controls and market interventions led to considerable overproduction, resulting in so-called butter mountains and wine lakes. These were intervention stores of produce bought up by the Community to maintain minimum price levels. To dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their produce outside the Community. This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside of Europe, especially those in the developing world.[tpl]cite news|last=Jeffery|first=Simon|title=The EU common agricultural policy|work=The Guardian  |date=26 June 2007|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jun/26/eu.politics1|accessdate=30 August 2007|location=London[/tpl]
The overproduction has also been criticised for encouraging environmentally unfriendly intensive farming methods. Supporters of CAP say that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living, in what would otherwise be an economically unviable way of life. However, the EU's small farmers receive only 8% of CAP's available subsidies.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the CAP has been subject to a series of reforms. Initially these reforms included the introduction of set-aside in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas (by the McSharry reforms in 1992) and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004). Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size. This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels, while maintaining agricultural income levels. One of these reforms entailed the abolition of the EU's sugar regime, which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU.[tpl]cite web|title=Sugar: Commission proposes more market-, consumer- and trade-friendly regime|publisher=Europa|date=14 April 2007|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/04/915&format=HTML&aged=1&language=EN&guiLanguage=en|accessdate=30 August 2007[/tpl]

===Environment===

In 1957 when the EU was founded, it had no environmental policy, no environmental bureaucracy, and no environmental laws.Jordan, A.J. and Adelle, C. (eds)(2012) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA.  Today, the EU has some of the most progressive environmental policies of any state in the world.  The environmental policy of the EU has therefore developed in remarkable fashion in the past four decades. An increasingly dense network of legislation has emerged, which now extends to all areas of environmental protection, including: air pollution control; water protection; waste management; nature conservation; and the control of chemicals, biotechnology and other industrial risks.Knill, C. and Liefferink, D.(2012) The establishment of EU environmental policy, In: Jordan, A.J. and Adelle, C. (eds) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA. The Institute for European Environmental Policy estimates the body of EU environmental law amounts to well over 500 Directives, Regulations and Decisions.Institute for European Environmental Policy (2012) Manual of European Environmental Policy, Earthscan, London. Environmental policy has thus become a core area of European politics.
Such dynamic developments are surprising in light of the legal and institutional conditions which existed in the late 1950s and 60s.Knill, C. and Liefferink, D.(2012) The etsbalishment of EU environmental policy, In: Jordan, A.J. and Adelle, C. (eds) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA. Acting without any legislative authority, European policy-makers initially increased the EU's capacity to act by defining environmental policy as a trade problem. The most important reason for the introduction of a common environmental policy was the fear that trade barriers and competitive distortions in the Common Market could emerge due to the different environmental standards.Johnson, S.P. and Corcelle, G. (1989) The Environmental Policy of the European Communities, Graham & Trotman, London However, in the course of time, EU environmental policy emerged as a formal policy area, with its own policy actors, policy principles and procedures. The legal basis of EU environmental policy was not more explicitly established until the introduction of the Single European Act in 1987.
Initially, EU environmental policy was rather inward looking. More recently, however, the Union has demonstrated a growing leadership in global environmental governance. The role of the EU in securing the ratification and entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol in the face of US opposition is an example in this regard. This international dimension is reflected in the EU's Sixth Environmental Action Programme, which recognises that its strategic objectives can only be achieved if a series of key international environmental agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at an EU level and worldwide. The entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty further strengthens the EU's global environmental leadership ambitions.Benson, D. and Adelle, C. (2012) European Union environmental policy after the Lisbon Treaty, In: Jordan, A.J. and Adelle, C. (eds) Environmental Policy in the European Union: Contexts, Actors and Policy Dynamics (3e). Earthscan: London and Sterling, VA. The vast body of EU environmental law which now exists has played a vital role in improving habitat and species protection in Europe as well as contributed to improvements in air and water quality and waste management. However, significant challenges remain, both to meet existing EU targets and aspirations and to agree new targets and actions that will further improve the environment and the quality of life in Europe and beyond.
One of the top priorities of EU environmental policy is combatting climate change. In 2007, member states agreed that the EU is to use 20% renewable energy in the future and that it has to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 by at least 20% compared to 1990 levels.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jan/23/climatechange.eu1|title=EU sets 20% target for carbon cuts|accessdate=29 February 2008|work=The Guardian |first=Jessica|last=Aldred|location=London|date=23 January 2008[/tpl] This includes measures that in 2020, 10% of the overall fuel quantity used by cars and trucks in EU 27 should be running on renewable energy such as biofuels. This is considered to be one of the most ambitious moves of an important industrialised region to fight climate change.[tpl]cite web|title=how the eu plans to fight climate change|url=http://www.environmentconservation.org/environmental-global-warming/how-the-eu-plans-to-fight-global-warming/|accessdate=Nov 2010[/tpl]

==Education and science==

Education and science are areas where the EU's role is limited to supporting national governments. In education, the policy was mainly developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the Erasmus Programme, a university exchange programme which began in 1987. In its first 20 years it has supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5 million university and college students and has become a symbol of European student life.[tpl]cite web|title=The Erasmus programme celebrates its 20th anniversary|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/news/erasmus20_en.html|accessdate=21 July 2007[/tpl]; [tpl]cite web|last=Jean-Sébastien|first=Lefebvre|title=Erasmus turns 20 – time to grow up?|date=22 January 2007|publisher=Café Babel|url=http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/article/19702/erasmus-turns-20-time-to-grow-up.html|accessdate=10 August 2007[/tpl]
There are now similar programmes for school pupils and teachers, for trainees in vocational education and training, and for adult learners in the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013. These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU.[tpl]cite web|author=EACEA|title=About the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/index.htm|accessdate=21 July 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Lifelong Learning Programme|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/llp/national_en.html|accessdate=21 July 2007[/tpl] Through its support of the Bologna Process the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe.
Scientific development is facilitated through the EU's Framework Programmes, the first of which started in 1984. The aims of EU policy in this area are to co-ordinate and stimulate research. The independent European Research Council allocates EU funds to European or national research projects.[tpl]cite web|title=What is the ERC?|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Research Council|url=http://erc.europa.eu/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.display&topicID=12|accessdate=21 July 2007[/tpl] EU research and technological framework programmes deal in a number of areas, for example energy where it aims to develop a diverse mix of renewable energy for the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels.[tpl]cite web|title=Energy|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/fp7/index_en.cfm?pg=energy|accessdate=12 November 2007[/tpl]

==Health care==

Although the EU has no major competences in the field of health care, Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union affirms that "A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities". All the member states have either publicly sponsored and regulated universal health care or publicly provided universal health care. The European Commission's Directorate-General for Health and Consumers seeks to align national laws on the protection of people's health, on the consumers' rights, on the safety of food and other products.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/health_consumer/about_us/our_vision_en.htm |title=Europa web portal |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=26 November 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/health_consumer/index_en.htm |title=Europa web portal |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=26 November 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health-eu/index_en.htm |title=Europa web portal |work=Europa (web portal) |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=26 November 2010[/tpl]
Health care in the EU is provided through a wide range of different systems run at the national level. The systems are primarily publicly funded through taxation (universal health care). Private funding for health care may represent personal contributions towards meeting the non-taxpayer refunded portion of health care or may reflect totally private (non-subsidised) health care either paid out of pocket or met by some form of personal or employer funded insurance.
All EU and many other European countries offer their citizens a free European Health Insurance Card which, on a reciprocal basis, provides insurance for emergency medical treatment insurance when visiting other participating European countries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/nhsengland/Healthcareabroad/pages/Healthcareabroad.aspx |title=info about health care and EHIC |publisher=Nhs.uk |date=29 April 2010 |accessdate=26 November 2010[/tpl] A directive on cross-border healthcare aims at promoting co-operation on health care between member states and facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare for European patients.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/lsa/119514.pdf |title=Consilium.europa.eu |format=PDF |accessdate=3 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:088:0045:0065:EN:PDF |title=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=3 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhsconfed.org/Publications/Factsheets/Pages/Cross-border-healthcare-commissioners.aspx |title=NHSconfed.org |publisher=NHSconfed.org |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=3 June 2013[/tpl]

==Demographics==

The combined population of all member states, excluding Croatia, which joined the EU in 2013, was forecast to be 503,679,730 on 1 January 2012.
The EU contains 16 cities with populations of over one million, the largest being London.
Besides many large cities, the EU also includes several densely populated regions that have no single core but have emerged from the connection of several cites and now encompass large metropolitan areas. The largest are Rhine-Ruhr having approximately 11.5 million inhabitants (Cologne, Dortmund, Düsseldorf et al.), Randstad approx. 7 million (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht et al.), Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region approx. 5.8 million (Frankfurt, Wiesbaden et al.), the Flemish Diamond approx. 5.5 million (urban area in between Antwerp, Brussels, Leuven and Ghent), Katowice and its Upper Silesian metropolitan area approx. 5.3 million and the Øresund Region approx. 3.7 million (Copenhagen, Denmark and Malmö, Sweden).[tpl]cite web|title=Indicators for larger urban zones 1999–2003|publisher=Europa web portal|author=Eurostat|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page?_pageid=1996,45323734&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&screen=welcomeref&open=/&product=EU_MASTER_urban_audit&depth=2|accessdate=25 January 2007[/tpl][tpl]clear[/tpl]
In 2010, 47.3 million people lived in the EU, who were born outside their resident country. This corresponds to 9.4% of the total EU population. Of these, 31.4 million (6.3%) were born outside the EU and 16.0 million (3.2%) were born in another EU member state. The largest absolute numbers of people born outside the EU were in Germany (6.4 million), France (5.1 million), the United Kingdom (4.7 million), Spain (4.1 million), Italy (3.2 million), and the Netherlands (1.4 million).6.5% of the EU population are foreigners and 9.4% are born abroad, Eurostat, Katya VASILEVA, 34/2011.

===Languages===

Among the many languages and dialects used in the EU, it has 24 official and working languages: Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, and Swedish.[tpl]cite web|title=Council Regulation (EC) No 1791/2006 of 20 November 2006|publisher=Europa web portal|author=EUR-Lex|work=Official Journal of the European Union|date=12 December 2006|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31958R0001:EN:NOT|accessdate=2 February 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Languages in Europe – Official EU Languages|publisher=EUROPA web portal|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/languages-of-europe/doc135_en.htm|accessdate=12 October 2009[/tpl] Important documents, such as legislation, are translated into every official language.

The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages ratified by most EU states provides general guidelines that states can follow to protect their linguistic heritage.
The European Day of Languages is held annually on 26 September and is aimed at encouraging language learning across Europe.

===Religion===

The EU is a secular body with no formal connection to any religion. The Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union recognises the "status under national law of churches and religious associations" as well as that of "philosophical and non-confessional organisations".
The preamble to the Treaty on European Union mentions the "cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe".Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union. Discussion over the draft texts of the European Constitution and later the Treaty of Lisbon included proposals to mention Christianity or God or both, in the preamble of the text, but the idea faced opposition and was dropped.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/eu-celebrates-its-50th-birthday--with-a-row-about-religion-440976.html|title=EU celebrates 50th birthday-with a row about religion|work=The Independent|location=London|first=Stephen|last=Castle|date=21 March 2007|accessdate=4 March 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
Christians in the EU are divided among followers of Roman Catholicism, numerous Protestant denominations, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Other world religions are also represented in the EU population. In 2009, the EU had an estimated Muslim population of 13 million,[tpl]cite web|title=Muslim Population |publisher=europa web portal |url=http://www.fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/attachments/Manifestations_EN.pdf|accessdate=November 2010[/tpl] and an estimated Jewish population of over a million.Jewish population figures may be unreliable.

According to new polls about Religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer, Christianity is the largest religion in the European Union. Catholics are the largest Christian group in EU, accounting for 48% EU citizens, while Protestants make up 12%, and Eastern Orthodoxs make up 8%, and Other Christians account for 4% EU population.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Discrimination in the EU in 2012|work=Special Eurobarometer |year=2012 |series=383 |page=233 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf |accessdate=14 August 2013 |publisher=European Commission |location=European Union[/tpl]

The most religious countries are Malta (95%; predominantly Roman Catholic), and Cyprus and Romania both with about 90% of the citizens believing in God (both predominantly Orthodox). Across the EU, belief was higher among women, increased with age, those with religious upbringing, those who left school at 15 with a basic education, and those "positioning themselves on the right of the political scale (57%)."
