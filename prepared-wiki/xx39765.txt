==History==

Tourism in Greece traces its roots to the ancient times. Cultural exchange took place between the Greek colonies of Magna Graeca and the young Roman Republic before Rome's rise to dominance of the Western Mediterranean.  When Greece was annexed by the Roman Empire centuries later, the cultural exchange that started between the two civilization triggered as a result a large number of Romans visiting the famous centers of Greek philosophy and science, such as Athens, Corinth and Thebes, partly because Greece had become a province of the Roman Empire and Greeks were granted Roman citizenship.
Tourism in modern-day Greece started to flourish in the 1960s and 1970s, in what became known as mass tourism.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.greeka.com/greece/greece-tourism.htm |title=Greece Tourism: Information about tourism in Greece and the Greek Islands |publisher=www.greeka.com |accessdate=17 May 2011[/tpl] During that time, large-scale construction projects for hotels and other such facilities were undertaken and the country saw an increase in international tourists over the years. International events such as the 2004 Summer Olympic Games and the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, both held in Athens, greatly helped to boost tourism in the country, while large-scale nationally-funded cultural infrastructure such as the New Acropolis Museum also contributed to the flow of tourists in the country.Thessaloniki will be European youth capital in 2014.

===Hotels and conference facilities===

Conference tourism, targeted at academic, business, or cultural markets is a cornerstone of the Greek national tourism policy. As a result, the Greek government, with strong support from local authorities, has been offering lucrative cash grants, leasing and employment subsidies and tax allowances to establish new conference facilities and expand existing ones. In a recent report in Meeting and Incentive Travel, Greece was ranked eighth in the world in overnight stays for conferences. Figures from the Tourism Satellite Accounting Research, conducted by WTTC (World Travel & Tourism Council) project a worldwide increase in revenues in business travel to Greece from US $1.51 bn. in 2001 to US $2.69 bn. in 2011. In 1998, the figure stood at US $1.18 bn.
According to the Hellenic Chamber of Hotels, the number of hotels in Greece was by classification (bedplaces):

===Marinas===

Greece has 51 marinas and 14,661 mooring places that provide such services as berths, fuel, water and electricity, telephony, and repairs.

===Spas and thermal springs===

==Promoting Greek tourism==

The government intends to promote winter tourism in Greece, which could potentially increase international arrivals even further.
Tourism in Greece is run by the Greek National Tourism Organisation (GNTO) who used Helena Paparizou, a famous Greek singer who won Eurovision Song Contest in 2005 as an ambassador.  Singer Sakis Rouvas,http://www.enet.gr/online/online_text/c=112,id=905204. Retrieved 2009-02-23 who represented Greece in the 2009 Eurovision song contest is currently the ambassador for Greek Tourism.
The new logo of the Greek National Tourism Organisation consists of nine circles, which symbolize the nine new kinds of tourism that should be promoted to combat the tourism sector's seasonality. The new logo's slogan is "Greece, the true experience", which shows that the marketing campaign is nowadays directed towards experience seekers and not just mass tourism.http://www.visitgreece.gr
The drawback of the new logo is that at a first glance it cannot be associated with Greece.
The advertisements displayed in the GNTO's web-site still focus on the triptych of sea, sun and sand.  However, the tourism campaign is undergoing a significant change as city-breaks and conference tourism are promoted, along with cultural and wellness tourism.  The impact of the new campaign will hopefully result in increased tourist revenues. The name of commercials is You in Greece.
