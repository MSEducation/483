The Drury Lane Theatres were a group of six theatres in the Chicago area founded by Tony DeSantis. The playhouses were named after the historic Theatre Royal Drury Lane, built in London in the 17th century. His five suburban locations all provided quality, affordable dinner theatre that was appropriate for families.Jones, Chris: http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/1283788771.html?dids=1283788771:1283788771&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+7%2C+2007&author=Chris+Jones&pub=Chicago+Tribune&edition=&startpage=1&desc=Tony+De+Santis%3A+1914+-+2007%3B+Mr.+Theater+in+Chicago%3B+Entrepreneur+built+Drury+Lane+empire%3B+hobnobbed+with+stars Chicago Tribune, June 7, 2007 - Mr. Theater in Chicago, Section 1, Page 1
