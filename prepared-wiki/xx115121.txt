==History==

The lower Rega area around Gryfice and Trzebiatów was site of a Slavic gród in the 9th century. The first recorded mention of the town comes from 1170 when the Pomeranian duke Kasimir I granted a few villages and oversight of a church in the town to settlers from Lund in Sweden.

As a dowager, Sophia of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg (1579–1658), widow of Philip II, Duke of Pomerania, lived in Treptow. Sophia's dower was a former nunnery, which she converted into a palace. While in Swedish service and thereafter Duke Francis Henry of Saxe-Lauenburg spent a lot of time with Duchess dowager Sophia in Treptow. Sophia's and Francis Henry's fathers were cousins. On 13 December 1637 Francis Henry and Marie Juliane of Nassau-Siegen (1612–1665) married in Treptow.N.N., "VII.

When in 1637 with Philip II's death the Pomeranian ducal house was extinct, the duchy was under Swedish occupation with the Brandenburgian electors claiming succession in Pomerania. Not until 1648 the electors prevailed in succeeding as dukes of Pomerania, however, only in the central and eastern part of ducal Pomerania (1653–1815), including Treptow.

With the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Brandenburg-Pomerania, already since 1618 ruled in personal union with Ducal Prussia (Kingdom since 1701), also legally merged into Prussia and the different German confederacies and empires, of which it formed part since. In 1945 central and eastern Pomerania, including Treptow, became part of Poland.

It is a memorial to day when the town guard by mistake dropped a bowl of cereal on invaders from the nearby town of Gryfice, alarming whole town and saving it.
