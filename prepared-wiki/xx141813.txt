Bromley was a rural district in north-west Kent, England from 1894 to 1934. Its area now forms part of the London Borough of Bromley in Greater London. It did not include the main settlement of Bromley; which constituted the Municipal Borough of Bromley. Mottingham formed an exclave of the district.Vision of Britain - Historical Boundaries
It was created under the Local Government Act 1894 based on the existing Bromley rural sanitary district. It initially consisted of fifteen civil parishes:Vision of Britain - Unit history

Within a few years of its creation, the rural district was reduced in size and population when two of the constituent civil parishes became separate urban districts. Chislehurst became an urban district in 1900, followed by Foot's Cray in 1902 (later renamed Sidcup Urban District in 1921).[tpl]cite book |title=''Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England |last=Youngs |first=Frederic A, Jr. |volume=I, Southern England |year=1979 |publisher=Royal Historical Society |location=London |isbn=0-901050-67-9 |pages=638–640 [/tpl]
The Local Government Act 1929 put in place a new procedure for the alteration of county districts, and due to increased urbanisation it became clear that the rural district was unlikely to continue to exist. Applications were made by Chislehurst Urban District Council to absorb the parishes of Mottingham, North Cray, St Mary Cray and St Paul's Cray, along with Sidcup UD. Beckenham Urban District Council entered into negotiations with West Wickham Parish Council to absorb the parish, while Bromley Borough Council sought to annex the parishes of Hayes and Keston.[tpl]cite news |title=Local Government in Kent |work=The Times |location=London |page=11 |date=23 September 1929 [/tpl] Bromley Rural District Council countered by making an application to be converted into an urban district, although they were prepared to cede Mottingham to Chislehurst UD. Public inquiries were held at Beckenham and Orpington in October 1929 into the proposed changes.[tpl]cite news |title=Local Government in Kent |work=The Times |location=London |page=16 |date=4 October 1929 [/tpl]
The district's abolition was carried out by the Kent Review Order 1934, which came into effect on 1 April:
