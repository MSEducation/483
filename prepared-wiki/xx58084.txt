"Jedna si jedina" (You Are the One and Only) was the national anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1992 and 1998. 
The music was taken from the old Bosnian folk song "S one strane Plive" ("On the far bank of the Pliva river" or "On the other side of the Pliva river"), and the lyrics were written by music star Dino Merlin. It was adopted in November 1992, several months after independence in March 1992. A new anthem - "The National Anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina" - was adopted in 1999. "Jedna si jedina" is still considered by most of the population to be the real anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many people still sing this anthem because they believe that it should be the official anthem of the modern state Bosnia and Herzegovina, and because the current anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina does not have any official lyrics.
