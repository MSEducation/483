[[JEB Decompiler]]

CATEGORIES: Java decompilers, Disassemblers

JEB is a disassembler and decompiler software for Android applications. It decompiles Dalvik bytecode to Java source code. The assembly and Java outputs are interactive and can be refactored. Users can also write their own scripts and pluginsAPI Documentation to extend JEB functionality.

==Overview==

JEB is the first Dalvik decompiler to provide interactive output, as reverse-engineers may examine cross-references, insert comments, or rename items, such as classes and methods. Whenever possible, the correspondence between the bytecode and the decompiled Java code is accessible to the user.
Although JEB is branded as a decompiler, it also provides a full APK view (manifest, resources, certificates, etc.)
An API allows users to customize or automate actions. As of August 2013, the API can be accessed using Python and Java.
The name may be a reference to the well-known security software IDA, as "JEB" = rot1("IDA").
