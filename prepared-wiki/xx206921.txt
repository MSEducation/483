The son of actor Ian Hunter, he made film and television appearances from the 1950s to the 1990s, which included Up Pompeii, the Carry Ons, Sherlock Holmes and Poirot. Musicals in which he performed included Damn Yankees, and the scripts he wrote himself for the Aba Daba Music Hall were of a comedic turn - such as Botome's Dream (produced in Brighton) in which Shakespeare is put on trial for plagiarism, and Aladdin & His Microsoft Compatible Floppy Drive Laptop (performed at the Arches Theatre, Southwark). For many years he and his life partner Aline Waites - herself an actress, playwright and critic - collaborated on scripts for plays, revues and musical theatre of all kinds. Their Illustrated Victorian Songbook was published by Michael Joseph in 1984. Appearances in West End theatre included male lead in Barefoot in the Park, and juvenile lead in The Pleasure of his Company. He was first married to the actress Maria Charles with whom he had two daughters, the stage manager Samantha Hunter and the actress Kelly Hunter; the couple divorced in 1966. He married again, to actress Amanda Barrie in 1967. They separated in the 1980s, but never divorced.
