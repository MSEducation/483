The 1957 English cricket season saw a continuation of Surrey success and an easy win for England over West Indies. Of Surrey's run of Championship titles from 1952 to 1958, this was the most decisive. They won 21 matches out of 28 and lost none, finishing with 312 points to the runner-up's (Northamptonshire) 218. It was jokingly suggested that they might still have won the title had they had no stumps to bowl at, for Mickey Stewart held 77 catches (only one short of Walter Hammond's record for a non-wicketkeeper), and Ken Barrington and Tony Lock each held 64.

==Test series==

England defeated West Indies 3-0 with two matches drawn. The first match, at Edgbaston, was crucial. England had appeared likely to lose it by an innings, until Peter May and Colin Cowdrey came together in a partnership of 411, then the fourth wicket Test record for all countries. May made 285* and Cowdrey 154. As a result, England saved (and nearly won) the match. The mastery that Sonny Ramadhin had enjoyed over English batsmen since 1950 was broken.
