==Description==

Mangú is made up of boiled green plantains. The plantains are then mashed with the water it has been boiling in. It is topped with sauteed red onions that have been cooked with apple cider vinegar. Queso Frito (fried cheese), fried salami, eggs or avocado are also usually added. Mangú can also be called los tres golpes literally "the three hits" meaning mangú with cheese, salami, eggs and then topped with sauteed onions.

==Origin==

Boiled mashed plantains can be traced back to Africans in the Congo region who came to the island during the height of the slave trade. The original word was something akin to mangusi and referred to almost any root vegetable that was boiled and mashed.
