[[Deadweight tester]]

CATEGORIES: Measuring instruments

A dead weight tester  apparatus uses known traceable weights to apply pressure to a fluid for checking the accuracy of readings from a pressure gauge.  A dead weight tester (DWT) is a calibration standard method that uses a piston cylinder on which a load is placed to make an equilibrium with an applied pressure underneath the piston. Deadweight testers are so called primary standards which means that the pressure measured by a deadweight tester is defined through other quantities: length, mass and time.
Typically deadweight testers are used in calibration laboratories to calibrate pressure transfer standards like electronic pressure measuring devices.

==Formula==

The formula on which the design of a DWT is based basically is expressed as follows :
 
 where :
 
 To be able to do accurate measurements, this formula has to be refined.

==piston cylinder design==

In general there are three different kind of DWT's divided by the medium which is measured and the lubricant which is used for its measuring element :
All three systems have their own specific operational demands. Some points of attention :

===gas-gas===

 
 Make sure that the PCU is clean. This is a very important issue as the PCU's  operation is sensitive to contamination. Also when connecting a DUT, make sure that the DUT does not introduce contamination in the measuring system.

===gas-oil===

 
 Lubricant of the PCU 'leaks' in the gas-circuit of the DWT. For this reason there is a small reservoir incorporated in the system. Before commencing a calibration it is a good practice to purge this reservoir. If the reservoir is full, oil will be introduced in critical tubing and will cause an uncontrollable oil-head.

===oil-oil===

 
 When connecting an oil filled DUT on an oil DWT make sure that the DUT oil will not contaminate the DWT oil. If in doubt. Incorporate a small volume between DUT and DWT and manipulate pressure in such a matter that the oil flow is directed to the DUT.

For high accuracy measurement, friction can be lowered by rotation of the piston.
