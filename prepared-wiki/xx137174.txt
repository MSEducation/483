[[Texas State Highway 125]]

CATEGORIES: State highways in Texas

State Highway 125 or SH 125 is a state highway in the U.S. state of Texas maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The [tpl]convert|28|mi|km|0|adj=on[/tpl] highway begins at the New Mexico state line southwest of Bledsoe, and passes through Bledsoe where it turns east intersecting [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|SH|214|in=Lehman[/tpl] before terminating at [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|SH|114|in=Whiteface[/tpl]. The highway is located entirely within Cochran County, and is numerically continuous with New Mexico State Road 125 which it meets at the state line and connects the highway to Tatum, NM. The highway has brief concurrencies with SH 214 in Lehman and Farm to Market Road 1780 in Whiteface.
The highway's numerical designation was previously assigned to a roadway in southeast Texas during the 1920s and 1930s. The current highway was designated in 1990 over a portion of [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|769[/tpl], but FM 769 had been unofficially signed as SH 125 since the 1950s.

==Route description==

SH 125 begins where it meets NM 125 at the New Mexico state line.[tpl]cite map|publisher=New Mexico Department of Transportation|title=Official Highway Map of New Mexico, America's Land of Enchantment|url=http://nmshtd.state.nm.us/upload/images/Maps/pdf/HWY_MAP05.pdf|format=PDF|edition=2005|date=April 27, 2005|section=G12-H12|accessdate=April 23, 2011[/tpl] The route proceeds to the northeast almost immediately intersecting from the south FM 769 which runs closely parallel to the state line on the Texas side. SH 125 continues to the northeast to Bledsoe where the route intersects [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|2182[/tpl][tpl]Texas Mapbook|136|accessdate=April 23, 2011 |link=no[/tpl] before turning east along Third St.[tpl]Google maps|title=Route of SH 125|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=NM-125+N%2FBledsoe+Hwy&daddr=NM-125+N%2FBledsoe+Hwy+to:TX-125+E%2FFarm+to+Market+Rd+769+to:TX-125+E%2FFarm+to+Market+Rd+769+to:TX-125+E%2FFarm+to+Market+Rd+769+to:TX-125+E%2FFarm+to+Market+Rd+769+to:TX-125+E%2FFarm+to+Market+Rd+769+to:TX-125+E%2FTX-214+S+to:TX-125+E%2FFarm+to+Market+Rd+169+to:E+2nd+St%2FFarm+to+Market+Rd+169+to:Unknown+road&hl=en&geocode=Fco-AAIds4rb-Q%3BFfY-AAId5orb-Q%3BFYj8AAIdfP7b-Q%3BFTL9AAIdsgTc-Q%3BFXwNAQIdxq3d-Q%3BFSYJAQId3hHf-Q%3BFWIJAQId2mrf-Q%3BFVQIAQId0Grf-Q%3BFbb7AAIdjpLg-Q%3BFR6yAAIdvj3i-Q%3BFRLDAAIdYj_i-Q&mra=mi&mrsp=10&sz=19&sll=33.604015,-102.613155&sspn=0.00122,0.00327&ie=UTF8&ll=33.598607,-102.827911&spn=0.312274,0.837021&z=11|accessdate= April 23, 2011[/tpl] The route intersects [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|595[/tpl] before leaving Bledsoe and then intersects [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1169[/tpl] and [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1779[/tpl] between Bledsoe and Lehman.
In Lehman, the route joins SH 214 to the south for a short distance before turning east again. Beyond Lehman, the road intersects [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|2195[/tpl] before gradually turning to the southeast toward Whiteface.[tpl]Texas Mapbook|164|accessdate= April 23, 2011|link=no[/tpl] The route enters Whiteface along E. Second St. and turns north along N. Taylor St. where SH 125 joins [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1780[/tpl]. On the northern edge of Whiteface, SH 125 ends at SH 114.
SH 125 passes through mostly agricultural lands and oil and gas fields across the largely flat and featureless terrain of the Llano Estacado.[tpl]cite map|publisher=United States Geological Survey|title=Elida, New Mexico-Texas|url=http://ims.er.usgs.gov/gda_services/download?item_id=5198957&quad=Elida&state=NM&grid=30X60&series=Map%20GeoPDF|format=PDF|edition=1979|scale=1:100,000|series=30x60 minute series (topographic)|accessdate=April 23, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite map|publisher=United States Geological Survey|title=Levelland, Texas|url=http://ims.er.usgs.gov/gda_services/download?item_id=5209216&quad=Levelland&state=TX&grid=30X60&series=Map%20GeoPDF|format=PDF|edition=1985|scale=1:100,000|series=30x60 minute series (topographic)|accessdate=April 23, 2011[/tpl]

==History==

SH 125 was previously designated between 1926[tpl]TxDOT map |year= 1926 |accessdate= April 23, 2011 |link=no[/tpl] and 1928[tpl]TxDOT map |year= 1928 |accessdate=April 23, 2011 |link=no[/tpl] on a route from Anahuac to Beaumont in Chambers and Jefferson counties.  The former route designation was replaced between 1936[tpl]TxDOT map |year= 1936 |accessdate= April 23, 2011Â |link= no[/tpl] and 1939 by SH 73-T between Anahuac and Stowell[tpl]TxDOT|SH|73|accessdate=April 23, 2011 |link= no[/tpl] and by [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|SH|124[/tpl] between Stowell and Beaumont.[tpl]TxDOT|SH|124|accessdate=April 23, 2011 |link= no[/tpl] SH 73-T was replaced by [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|SH|65[/tpl] in 1961.[tpl]TxDOT|SH|65|accessdate=April 23, 2011 |link= no[/tpl]
The current route was originally designated as FM 769 between SH 214 in Lehman and [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|SH|290[/tpl],[tpl]TxDOT|SH|290|accessdate=April 23, 2011 |link= no[/tpl] now SH 114 in Whiteface in 1947.[tpl]TxDOT|FM|769|accessdate=April 23, 2011 |link= no[/tpl] That route was extended to the New Mexico state line the following year, while also being extended [tpl]convert|10|mi|km|0[/tpl] southward from Whiteface[tpl]TxDOT|FM|1780|accessdate=April 23, 2011 |link= no[/tpl] to an intersection with a road that two years later would become [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|301[/tpl][tpl]TxDOT|FM|301|accessdate=April 23, 2011 |link= no[/tpl] In 1952, FM 769 was extended southward [tpl]convert|9.7|mi|km|1[/tpl] along the New Mexico state line.
The route was first unofficially signed as SH 125 while officially maintaining its Farm to Market designation in 1955 allowing the route to be numerically continuous with its New Mexico counterpart. The following year, the portion of the route from FM 301 to [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|SH|116[/tpl] as the current SH 114 was designated between 1955 to 1978[tpl]TxDOT|SH|116|accessdate=April 23, 2011 |link= no[/tpl] was designated as an extension to FM 1780 with FM 769 ending where it intersected FM 1780. In 1962, the designation of [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|2010[/tpl] was canceled and combined with FM 769 extending the route [tpl]convert|11.5|mi|km|1[/tpl] south along the state line to [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|FM|1077[/tpl] in Yoakum County.[tpl]TxDOT|FM|2010|accessdate=April 23, 2011 |link= no[/tpl] FM 1077 was renumbered as part of [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|US|82[/tpl] the following year.[tpl]TxDOT|RM|1077|accessdate=April 23, 2011 |link= no[/tpl] The route was extended [tpl]convert|8.5|mi|km|1[/tpl] farther south along the state line to [tpl]roadlink|state=TX|US|83[/tpl] west of Denver City in 1970.
The state highway designation became official in 1990, and the FM 769 designation was eliminated. In 1990, SH 125 was reassigned along its current alignment from the state line to SH 114 in Whiteface, and FM 769 was recreated along the state line from US 83 to SH 125 the following year.
