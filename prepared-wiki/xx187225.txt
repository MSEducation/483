"Someone's Looking at You" was the third and final single from the The Boomtown Rats' album The Fine Art of Surfacing.[tpl]cite web|author=William Ruhlmann |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-boomtown-rats-mn0000520033/biography |title=The Boomtown Rats | Biography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-04-10[/tpl] It peaked at number two on the Irish Singles Chart and number 4 on the UK Singles Chart in February 1980. 
It is an organ-based song that paints a humid picture of 1984-style government surveillance and has been described as a "gently humorous song about paranoia".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.authorsden.com/visit/viewarticle.asp?id=6306 |title=Rats article |publisher=Authorsden.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-13[/tpl] The second verse starts "They saw me there in the square when I was shooting my mouth off about saving some fish. Now could that be construed as some radical's views or some liberals' wish". This refers to singer Bob Geldof's participation in a Greenpeace anti-whaling rally in London's Trafalgar Square. Geldof's website describes the song as a personal statement on fame.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl]
