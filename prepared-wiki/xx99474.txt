The Isuzu Gemini was a subcompact automobile that was produced by the Japanese automaker Isuzu from 1974 to 2000. The same basic product was built and/or sold under several other names, sometimes by other General Motors brands, in various markets around the world. While the first generation was of a rear-wheel drive design, later versions were all front-wheel drive. The last two generations were no more than badge-engineered Honda Domani until 2000.

==1974==

The first Gemini was the Bellett Gemini, first seen in November 1974. It was based on the third-generation Opel Kadett C on the General Motors T-car platform and came in four-door sedan and two-door coupe body styles. The chassis code was PF50, although the later 1.8-liter versions were called PF60 and the diesels PFD60.[tpl]citation | title = Car Graphic: Car Archives Vol. 11, '80s Japanese Cars | publisher = Nigensha | year = 2007 | language = Japanese | page = 239 | location = Tokyo | isbn = 978-4-544-91018-6 [/tpl]
In June 1977 the Gemini received its first, light, facelift. The bigger 1817 cc G180 series engine became available, fitted with rectangular headlights rather than the round units used on the 1600. This model offered [tpl]convert|110|PS|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl], although this output dropped to [tpl]convert|105|PS|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] if an automatic transmission was fitted.[tpl]Cite book | title = World Cars 1978 | publisher = The Automobile Club of Italy/Herald Books | editor-last = Lösch | editor-first = Annamaria | location = Pelham, NY | page = 351 | ref = WC78 | year = 1978 | isbn = 0-910714-10-X [/tpl] In November of the same year the 1600 was updated, now with square headlights and an engine with the I·CAS oxidation catalyst ("Isuzu Clean Air System") which could manage the 1978 emissions standards.[tpl]cite journal | ref = JAMA25 | journal = 自動車ガイドブック Motor Vehicles Guide Book | language = Japanese | volume = 25 | year = 1978/1979 | date = 1978-10-10 | publisher = Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association | location = Japan | page = 109 | id = 0053-780025-3400 [/tpl] One year later the Gemini 1800's engine was upgraded to meet the 1978 emissions standards.[tpl]cite journal | ref = JAMA26 | journal = 自動車ガイドブック Motor Vehicles Guide Book | language = Japanese | volume = 26 | year = 1979/1980 | date = 1979-11-01 | publisher = Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association | location = Japan | page = 113 | id = 053-790026-3400 [/tpl] Power remained unchanged, and the automatic now offered the same power as cars with manual transmission.Automobile Guide Book 1979/1980, p. 168 The ignition system was now of a transistor less type, and the trunk lid was now opened remotely (not added to the Gemini 1600 until the end of December). The Gemini Black and 1800 Minx were also added, the Minx with a two-tone paintjob and the Black with black paintwork and more sporty yet comfortable equipment including alloy wheels.
In June 1979, the Gemini received a new slant nose with rectangular headlights and a redesigned rear end. The changes were actually more comprehensive than that, also including a redesigned (longer) engine bay and a wider radiator opening for two new engines added in November (the twin cam G180W and the new 4FB1 diesel) which both required wider radiators for more air for cooling.[tpl]citation | first = Jack K. | last = Yamaguchi | editor-last = Lösch | editor-first = Annamaria | journal = World Cars 1980 | title = Consummation of the Turbulent Decade | publisher = L'Editrice dell'Automobile LEA/Herald Books | location = Pelham, NY | page = 66 | year = 1980 | isbn = 0-910714-12-6 [/tpl]
In Japan, sports models were available originally with the "ZZ" name. Later, ZZ/L (1980), ZZ/R (1981), ZZ/T, and ZZ/E models were added. These were equipped with an Isuzu G180W 8-valve DOHC 1.8-liter engine, most commonly fuel-injected, producing [tpl]convert|130|PS|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at 6400 rpm. These models also came with a shortened remote throw manual shift lever and optional factory LSD differential.[tpl]Cite book | ref = Eichi3 | title = 絶版車カタログ 国産車編 Part3 1970~1979 | trans_title = Japanese Historic Car Graffiti: Car Catalog part 3, 1970–1979 | language = Japanese | publisher = Eichi Publishing (英知出版) | series = Eichi Mook | location = Tokyo | page = 57 | year = 1997 | isbn = 4-89461-004-3 [/tpl] There was also a mildly sporting model of the OHC 1800, called the LS/G.
In October 1982 a version of the diesel with Bosch VE electronic fuel injection was also added; this provided 8% more power than the regular version (66 versus 61 PS) and was fitted to the LT-E and LJ-E models. For those who wanted more, a [tpl]convert|73|PS|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] turbo diesel appeared a month later. Also featuring electronic fuel injection, this model also received a standard rear anti-roll bar. Counterintuitively, the two more powerful diesels were never available with the coupé bodywork.[tpl]Cite book | title = World Cars 1984 | publisher = L'Editrice dell'Automobile LEA/Herald Books | location = Pelham, NY | pages = 344–345 | year = 1984 | isbn = 0-910714-16-9 [/tpl]
The Gemini was complemented in 1981 by the Giugiaro-designed coupé Isuzu Piazza, based on the Gemini's platform, which was introduced in the United States in 1983 as the Isuzu Impulse and in Australia in 1986 as the Holden Piazza.

===In other markets===

The North American market version was originally sold as the "Opel by Isuzu" and then the Buick Opel, but for the 1981 model year it metamorphosed into the "Isuzu I-Mark".[tpl]Cite book | title = Standard Catalog of Imported Cars, 1946-1990 | author = James M. Flammang | publisher = Krause Publications, Inc. | location = Iola, WI | page = 308 | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-87341-158-7 [/tpl] The diesel engine was available in the I-mark, but the standard engine was a [tpl]convert|78|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] (SAE net) version of the 1.8 litre G181Z engine.[tpl]cite journal | title = Automobil Revue '83 | editor-last = Büschi | editor-first = Hans-Ulrich | publisher = Hallwag, AG | language = German/French | page = 337 | location = Berne, Switzerland | volume = 78 | date = March 10, 1983 | isbn = 3-444-06065-3 [/tpl] The diesel gradually lost sales after USA's brief love affair with the diesel car came to an end in the early eighties, and eventually it was only available in a single coupé version.
Isuzu Gemini was also sold in South Korea as Saehan Gemini, whose manufacturer became Daewoo Motors in 1982. It then became Daewoo Maepsy after 1982 and remained on sale (later as the Maepsy-Na after a facelift) until it was replaced by Daewoo LeMans in 1986.
In addition to sedan and coupé models, Holden in Australia produced the Gemini as a three-door station wagon and three-door panel van, which were derived from the Opel Kadett C Caravan and Vauxhall Chevette wagon, with Isuzu Gemini front panels. The panel van's side panels came from the Bedford Chevanne. The Australian Holden Gemini was fitted with an Isuzu G161Z petrol engine, although 1979 and later models were available with a 1.8-litre 8-valve SOHC diesel engine (4FB1). The more common G161Z was a 1.6-liter 8-valve SOHC fed by a Nikki carburettor. The Holden Gemini was Wheels magazine's Car of the Year for 1975.
In Europe, the Gemini was equipped with the 1.6-liter engine which produced [tpl]convert|68|PS|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] DIN there; the discrepancy in stated power (down 32%) may have been entirely due to the differences to the SAE (gross) measuring system used on Japanese market cars.

==1985==

General Motors sought a replacement for their world car T-body Kadett / Gemini, and this time, instead of building one design on several continents, they decided to build a world car in one location and export it to several continents. As a considerable portion of the T-body manufacturing had been turned over to Isuzu in Japan for economic reasons, so would the manufacturing of the replacement. In 1984, Isuzu again commissioned Giorgetto Giugiaro who was responsible for the 117 Coupé and the Piazza. This time, he was to design an economy car on the new front-wheel drive R-body platform. The R-body featured a MacPherson strut front suspension and beam axle rear suspension, which foreshadowed most of GM's offerings through their current model lineup. Giugiaro's design followed the Piazza design very closely in shape and detail, though the proportions made the Gemini appear shorter and taller in its three-door version, and a four-door sedan (notch back) was also designed.
Unfortunately for everyone involved, Isuzu presented the designs to GM prior to freezing them, and GM ordered a number of detail changes to them without ever consulting the designer, Giugiaro, which was taken as an insult, and ended the long relationship between the noted Italian designer and Japan's oldest car builder. The insult was serious enough to Giugiaro that he denied the design was his until a decade after the vehicle went out of production.
The R-body Gemini was introduced in May 1985 as the Gemini FF (after it had already gone on sale as a Chevrolet in the United States), with an all-new line of engines. In Japan, originally with chassis code JT150, it was available with a carburetted 1.5-liter SOHC engine. An also newly developed 1.5-liter inline four diesel engine (JT600) was added to the lineup in November. At the other end of the lineup, a [tpl]convert|120|PS|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] fuel-injected and turbocharged version of the 1.5-liter 4XB1 engine ("Irmscher") was added in May 1986. Originally, the transmission started out with a choice of a 5-speed manual or a 3-speed automatic, but NAVi5, an automated manual transmission, was added in 1986.
The FF Gemini underwent a facelift in February 1987, receiving a more aggressive front styling with wraparound headlight as well as other minor changes. At the same time the "FF" moniker was dropped, as parallel production of the preceding RWD Gemini came to an end. In March 1987 the Gemini saw its European premier, at the Geneva Salon. European sales of the already somewhat dated Gemini were disappointing, and Isuzu soon withdrew from the European passenger car market entirely.
A 1.6-liter DOHC engine with [tpl]convert|135|PS|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] was introduced in February 1988. Export versions were also available with a smaller 1.3-liter four to suit taxation systems based on displacement.[tpl]Cite book | title = Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1990 | editor = Mastrostefano, Raffaele | publisher = Editoriale Domus S.p.A | year = 1990 | pages = 388–390 | language = Italian | location = Milano [/tpl] This offered [tpl]convert|72|PS|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl], while export specification 1.5s had [tpl]convert|76|PS|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] on tap and the naturally aspirated diesel offered [tpl]convert|52|PS|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] outside of Japan.[tpl]cite book | last = Ruiz | first = Marco | title = 'The Complete History of the Japanese Car: 1907 to the Present | publisher = ERVIN srl | location = Rome | year = 1986 | page = 132 | isbn = 0-517-61777-3 [/tpl] Trim levels were widely varied, from basic models ("C/C" in Japan, "LT" in general export markets, and "S" in the US) to Irmscher, ZZ, and Lotus Tuned versions, and plenty of optional equipment and dealer options were available.

===North America===

In the US, the vehicle was available from Chevrolet (and later Geo) as the Spectrum, or from Isuzu themselves, as the I-Mark. GM's Pontiac division sold the I-Mark as the Pontiac Sunburst in Canada from 1985 to 1988. Sales were limited to coastal markets initially, as import quotas restricted the number of cars General Motors could sell in the United States.[tpl]cite journal | journal = Advertising Age | date = 1985-02-18 | first = Jesse | last = Snyder | page = 74 | title = Old name, new partner add up to new Nova [/tpl] The Spectrum was presented at the end of November 1984, with cars already on sale in 16 eastern states. Due to the quotas, only 29,500 cars were available the first model year, about a quarter of what GM had hoped to be able to sell.[tpl]cite journal | title = About Cars; Chevrolet's Trio Challenge Imports | journal = The New York Times | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/25/sports/about-cars-chevrolet-s-trio-challenge-imports.html | date = 1984-11-25 | last = Schuon | first = Marshall [/tpl]
GM Canada announced that the Sunburst's replacement would be the Passport Optima in 1989. For GM, this was an entry level vehicle to attract young buyers and to compete with Japanese midsize cars in the US market. Chevrolet's Spectrum lacked many of the options and equipment of the I-Mark, though both were available with the [tpl]convert|70|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] 1.5-liter SOHC non-turbo and [tpl]convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] turbo engines, but no diesel engines were offered in the US. The turbo model I-Mark was called the RS model in 1988 and then changed to the LS model in 1989. The I-Mark was available with the [tpl]convert|125|hp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] 1.6-liter DOHC engine in 1989 only, as the RS model. In 1988 and 1989, the LS and RS models were offered with Lotus Tuned Suspension, the sportier suspension featuring more rigid dampers, alternate spring rates, and bigger sway bars.

==1990==

The Gemini was redesigned for 1990, and the coupe version was now renamed the Gemini Coupe. The last models were produced in 1993.
The Isuzu Gemini Coupe was the basis for the Isuzu Impulse and Geo Storm in the United States and Canada, and for the Asüna Sunfire which was sold for the Canadian market for the 1993 model year only.
A 4-door sedan with similar mechanical components was sold as the Isuzu Stylus in the United States and Canada. The Geo versions lacked some of the more expensive and advanced features of the Isuzu (and Asüna) versions.
All these variations were used on the last of the Geminis—Isuzu Impulse, Isuzu Piazza, Isuzu Gemini MkII, Isuzu Stylus, and Asüna Sunfire.
The third generation appeared in March 1990. Body size was wider than the previous generation.
The series name was called the type JT641S, the type JT641F, and the 4WD car is the same type JT191S. The car is 1,700 cc turbo diesel type JT191F, 4WD gasoline turbo cars with 1,600 cc DOHC gasoline type intercooler JT151F, the car is 1,500 cc, and 1,600 cc DOHC gasoline car gasoline. The top-line Stylus RS model had either the 1.6 L turbo engine (1991) or the 1.8 L non-turbo engine (1992).
The higher trim level packages offered "ZZ handling by Lotus" and "specification Irmscher" as the performance models in the lineup, but was carryovered from previous generations.The top model was the "Irmscher R" JT191S type is equipped with a high-power engine + full-time 4WD. The suspension packages that were installed on the second generation Isuzu Piazza were also shared on the Gemini sold in Japan, including the four wheel steering setup.
It was originally intended to be a four-door sedan, and coupe from September 1990, three-door hatchback has been added in March 1991 later. Sedan sales has been started from December 1990 under the name "STYLUS" in the North American market. As the recession began to take hold in Japan, known as the "bubble economy", Isuzu was affected particularly hard, and after a corporate restructuring, Isuzu decided to abandon passenger car production and focus on commercial truck and SUV production, as the Isuzu Trooper and the Isuzu Rodeo found many buyers internationally, with badge engineered versions sold in Europe as Vauxhall/Opel Frontera (Rodeo) and Vauxhall/Opel Monterey and Holden Frontera (Rodeo) and Holden Jackaroo/Monterey (Trooper) in Australia with assistance from General Motors, and Honda also selling the Rodeo as Honda Passport and the Trooper as Honda Horizon (in Japan) and the Acura SLX(in the United States.Organizational structure in the automobile industry revolution SFC Keio Keio University Shonan South Fujisawa Campus 1995 organizational behavior theory OB68 group REFERENCE FOUND ON jAPANESE WIKIPEDIA SITE #6 AND 7
The total production volume of vehicles was 406,625 units at the end of the third generation (from HQ Isuzu), with 17,754 units sold in the United States (from Ward's Automotive Yearbook).

==1993/4==

Isuzu halted production of the Gemini and replaced it with a rebadged version of the Honda Domani.

==1997==

The 1997 Gemini generation was a rebadged Honda Domani sedan. Production of this model ceased in 2000.

==Safety==

In Australia, the 1982–1984 Holden Gemini was assessed in the Used Car Safety Ratings 2006 as providing "significantly worse than average" protection for its occupants in the event of a crash.[tpl]dead link|date=May 2009[/tpl]
