The first edition, which is the version most easily available for download, was published in 1985 and the last of four editions (edited by Steve Gold) appeared in 1989.[tpl]cite book | first=Steve | last=Gold | title=Hugo Cornwall's New Hacker's Handbook | year=1989 | publisher=Century Hutchinson |isbn=0-7126-3454-1 | location=London [/tpl] In 1990, the UK Parliament passed the Computer Misuse Act.
