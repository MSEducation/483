[[Basket cell]]

CATEGORIES: Central nervous system neurons

Basket cells are inhibitory GABAergic interneurons of the brain, found in the molecular layer  of the cerebellum, the hippocampus, and the cerebral cortex.[tpl]cite book|last=Jones|first=Edward|title=Cerebral Cortex: Volume 1: Cellular Components of the Cerebral Cortex|year=1984|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780306415449[/tpl]

==Anatomy and Physiology==

Basket cells are multipolar, interneurons that function to make inhibitory synapses and control the overall potentials of target cells. Their cell bodies can be found in molecular layers. The dendrites of basket cells are free branching, contain smooth spines, and extended from 12 to 30 mm. The extensive branching of the dendrites give this neuron their name as they portray the structure of a basket.

By controlling the synapses of neurons, basket cells can directly control the action potential discharge rate of target cells.

==Cerebellum==

In the cerebellum, the multipolar basket cells have branching dendrites, which are dilated and knotty. Basket cells synapse on the cell bodies of Purkinje cells and make inhibitory synapses with Purkinje cells. Cerebellar basket cell axons fire inhibitory neurotransmitters such as GABA to Purkinje cell axons, and inhibits the Purkinje cell.Southan, A., Robertson, B. "Patch-Clamp Recordings from Cerebellar Basket Cell Bodies and Their Presynaptic Terminals Reveal an Asymmetric Distribution of Voltage-Gated Potassium Channels", The Journal of Neuroscience, London, 1 February 1998. Retrieved on 2014-3-12.Purkinje cells send inhibitory messages to the deep cerebellar nuclei and are responsible for the sole output of motor coordination from the cerebellar cortex. With the work of the basket cell, Purkinje cells do not send the inhibitory response for motor coordination and motor movement occurs.Tan, Y., Llano, I.

==Hippocampus==

Hippocampal basket cells target somata and proximal dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Like their counterparts in the cortex,[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.neunet.2004.04.003[/tpl]hippocampal basket cells are also parvalbumin-expressing and fast-spiking. In the CA3 region of the hippocampus, basket cells can often form recurrent inhibition loops with pyramidal cells. [tpl]cite web|last=Bryne|first=John|title=Feedback/recurrent inhibition: Feedback inhibition in microcircuits|url=http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s1/introduction.html|work=Neuroscience Online|publisher=University of Texas Health Center[/tpl] Projections from a pyramidal cell will innervate the basket cell, which in turn has a projection back onto the original pyramidal cells. Since basket cells are inhibitory, this generates a closed loop that can help dampen excitatory responses.

==Cortex==

In the cortex, basket cells have sparsely branched axons giving off small pericellular, basket-shaped elaborations at several intervals along their length. Basket cells make up 15-25 % of total neurons in the cortex. Wang, Y., Gupta, A., Toledo-Rodriquez, M., Wu, C., and Markram, H. "Anatomical, Physiological, Molecular and Circuit Properties of Nest Basket Cells in the Developing Somatosensory Cortex", Oxford Journals, April 2002. Retrieved on 2014-3-11. There are three types of basket cells in the cortex, the small, large and nest type:Fox, K. "Barrel Cortex", Cambridge University Press, pp. 55-56 The axon of a small basket cell arborizes in the vicinity of that same cell's dendritic range, this axon is short. In contrast, large basket cells innervate somata in different cortical columns due to a long axon. Wang, Y., Gupta, A., Toledo-Rodriquez, M., Wu, C., and Markram, H. "Anatomical, Physiological, Molecular and Circuit Properties of Nest Basket Cells in the Developing Somatosensory Cortex", Oxford Journals, April 2002. Retrieved on 2014-3-11. The nest basket cells are an intermediate form of the small and large cells, their axons are confined mainly to the same cortical layer as their somata. Nest basket cells have "radiating axonal collaterals" between that of large and small basket cells. They are included as basket cells because they are interneurons that perform axo-somatic synapses.
