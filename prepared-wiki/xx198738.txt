The Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications (ICA) is an international scientific organization. It was formed in 1990 and is based in Winnipeg, Canada.

==Aim and membership==

The ICA's aim is to increase the visibility and the influence of the combinatorial community. It has over 800 members in over forty countries. 
Membership in the ICA is at three levels. Members are those who have not yet completed a Ph.D. Associate Fellows are younger members who have received the Ph.D. or have published extensively; normally an Associate Fellow should hold the rank of Assistant Professor. Fellows are expected to be established scholars and typically have the rank of Associate Professor or higher. 
Some members are involved in highly theoretical research; there are members whose primary interest lies in education and instruction; and there are members who are heavily involved in the applications of combinatorics in statistical design, communications theory, cryptography, computer security, and other practical areas. 

==Publication==

The ICA publishes the Bulletin of the ICA (ISSN 1183-1278), a journal that combines publication of survey and research papers with news of members and accounts of future and past conferences. 

==Medals==

The ICA awards the Euler Medals for distinguished career contributions to combinatorics by a member of the institute.
The ICA awards the Hall Medals, named after Marshall Hall, Jr., to recognize outstanding achievements by members who are not over age 40. 
The ICA awards the Kirkman Medals to recognize outstanding achievements by members who are within four years past their Ph.D.
