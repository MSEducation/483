O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu ([tpl]IPA-haw|oˈʔɐhu|pron[/tpl]) or Oahu [tpl]IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|ɑː|h|uː[/tpl], known as "The Gathering Place", is the third largest of the Hawaiian Islands; however, it is the most populous of the islands in the U.S. state of Hawaii while also having the primary Honolulu International Airport. The state capital, Honolulu, is on O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu's southeast coast. Including small close-in offshore islands such as Ford Island and the islands in Kaneohe Bay and off the eastern (windward) coast, it has a total land area of [tpl]convert|596.7|sqmi|km2|1[/tpl], making it the 20th largest island in the United States.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/economic/databook/db2004/section05.pdf | title=Table 5.08 – Land Area of Islands: 2000 |work=2004 State of Hawaii Data Book |publisher=State of Hawaii | year=2004 | accessdate=July 23, 2007|format=PDF[/tpl] In the greatest dimension, this volcanic island is [tpl]convert|44|mi|km|0|[/tpl] long and [tpl]convert|30|mi|km|0[/tpl] across.  The length of the shoreline is [tpl]convert|227|mi|km|0|[/tpl]. The island is the result of two separate shield volcanoes: Wai[tpl]okina[/tpl]anae and Ko[tpl]okina[/tpl]olau, with a broad "valley" or saddle (the central O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu Plain) between them. The highest point is Mt. Ka'ala in the Wai[tpl]okina[/tpl]anae Range, rising to [tpl]convert|4003|ft|m|0|[/tpl] above sea level''.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/economic/databook/db2004/section05.pdf | title=Table 5.11 – Elevations of Major Summits |work=2004 State of Hawaii Data Book |publisher=State of Hawaii | year=2004 | accessdate=July 23, 2007|format=PDF[/tpl]

==Introduction==

The island is home to about 953,207 people (approximately 75% of the resident population of the state, with approximately 80% of those living on the "city" side of the island). O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu has for a long time been known as "The Gathering Place". However, the term O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu has no confirmed meaning in Hawaiian, other than that of the place itself.Pukui, et al., 1976 Ancient Hawaiian tradition attributes the name's origin in the legend of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]iloa, the Polynesian navigator credited with discovery of the Hawaiian Islands.  The story relates that he named the island after a son.
Residents of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu refer to themselves as "locals" (as done throughout Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i), no matter their ancestry.
The city of Honolulu—largest city, state capital, and main deepwater marine port for the State of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i—is located here. As a jurisdictional unit, the entire island of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu is in the City & County of Honolulu, although as a place name, Honolulu occupies only a portion of the southeast end of the island.
Well-known features found on O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu include Waikīkī, Pearl Harbor, Diamond Head, Hanauma Bay, Kāne[tpl]okina[/tpl]ohe Bay, Kailua Bay, North Shore.
Being roughly diamond-shaped, surrounded by ocean and divided by mountain ranges, directions on O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu are not generally described with the compass directions found throughout the world.  Locals instead use "ewa" (pronounced "eh-va") to mean toward the western tip of the island, "Diamond Head" to be toward the eastern tip, "mauka" (pronounced "moww-ka") is toward the mountains and "makai" toward the sea.
Locals consider the island to be divided into various areas, which may overlap.  The most commonly accepted areas are the "City", "Town" or "Town side", which is the metropolitan area from Halawa to the area below Diamond Head (residents of the island north of the Ko[tpl]okina[/tpl]olau Mountains consider the Town Side to be the entire southern half);  "West O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu," which goes from Pearl Harbor to Kapolei and Ewa and may include the Makaha and Waianae areas; the "North Shore" (northwestern coast); the "Windward Side" (northeastern coast); the "East Side" (the eastern portion of the island, including both the Windward Side and the area east of Diamond Head; and "The Valley" or "Central O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu" which runs northwest from Pearl Harbor toward Haleiwa.  These terms are somewhat flexible, depending on the area in which the user lives, and are used in a mostly general way. 
Oahu is also known for having the longest rain shower in history with over 200 days spent with continuous rain. Kaneohe Ranch, Oahu, Hawaii reported 247 straight days with rain from August 27, 1993 to April 30, 1994.

==History==

The old Kingdom of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu was once ruled by the most ancient Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i in all of the Hawaiian Islands.  The first great king of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu was Mailikukahi, the law maker, who was followed by many generation of monarchs. Kualii was the first of the warlike kings and so were his sons.  In 1773, the throne fell upon Kahahana, the son of Elani of Ewa.  In 1783 Kahekili II, King of Maui, conquered O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu and deposed the reigning family and then made his son Kalanikupule king of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu.  Kamehameha the Great would conquer in the mountain Kalanikupule's force in the Battle of Nu[tpl]okina[/tpl]uanu. Kamehameha founded the Kingdom of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i with the conquest of O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu in 1795. Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i would not be unified until the islands of Kaua[tpl]okina[/tpl]i and Ni[tpl]okina[/tpl]ihau surrendered under King Kaumualii in 1810. Kamehameha III moved his capital from Lāhainā, on Maui to Honolulu, O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu in 1845. [tpl]okina[/tpl]Iolani Palace, built later by other members of the royal family, is still standing, and is the only royal palace on American soil.
O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu was apparently the first of the Hawaiian Islands sighted by the crew of HMS Resolution on January 19, 1776 during Captain James Cook's third Pacific expedition. Escorted by HMS Discovery, the expedition was surprised to find high islands this far north in the central Pacific. O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu was not actually visited by Europeans until February 28, 1779 when Captain Charles Clerke aboard HMS Resolution stepped ashore at Waimea Bay. Clerke had taken command of the ship after Capt. Cook was killed at Kealakekua Bay (island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i) on February 14, and was leaving the islands for the North Pacific.
The Imperial Japanese Navy attack on Pearl Harbor, O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu on the morning of December 7, 1941 brought the United States into World War II. The surprise attack was aimed at the Pacific Fleet of the United States Navy and its defending Army Air Corps and Marine Air Forces. The attack damaged or destroyed twelve American warships, destroyed 188 aircraft, and resulted in the deaths of 2,403 American servicemen and 68 civilians (of those, 1,177 were the result of the destruction of the USS Arizona alone).
Today, O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu has become a tourism and shopping haven. Over five million visitors (mainly from the American mainland and Japan) flock there every year to enjoy the quintessential island holiday experience.
An earthquake, measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale, struck the Island Of Hawai'i and the surrounding islands at 07:07:49 HST on October 15, 2006, causing an island-wide power outage and over $200 million in damage.

From 2009 to 2011, Ocean Power Technologies ocean-tested its wave power generation system at the US Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH) at Kaneohe Bay. The O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu system was launched under the Company's program with the US Navy for ocean testing and demonstration of such systems, including connection to the O[tpl]okina[/tpl]ahu grid.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
