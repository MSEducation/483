The [tpl]convert|1338|acre|ha|1|adj=on[/tpl] main academic and residential campus is located [tpl]convert|22|mi|km[/tpl] south of Toledo, Ohio. The institution was granted a charter in 1910 as a normal school, specializing in teacher training and education, as part of the Lowry Normal School Bill that authorized two new normal schools in the state of Ohio. Over the university's history, it developed from a small rural normal school into a comprehensive public university.
As of 2012 Bowling Green offered over 200 undergraduate programs,[tpl]cite web | url=http://go2.bgsu.edu/choose/about/ | title=BGSYou at a Glance | publisher=Bowling Green State University Office of Admissions | accessdate=2008-04-06[/tpl] as well as master's and doctoral degrees through eight academic colleges.

==History==

===Early history===

The movement for a public high learning institution in northwestern Ohio began in the late 1800s as part of the growth in public institutions during the Progressive Era to meet demands for training and professional development of teachers.[tpl]cite web|work=Ohio Historical Society|title=Ohio History Central|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=657|accessdate=April 8, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|publisher=Bowling Green State University|work=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/colleges/edhd/page80935.html|title=College of Education and Human Development: Our History|accessdate=September 25, 2011[/tpl] During the period, people of northwestern Ohio campaigned for a school in their region to produce better quality education and educators. The movement argued that the existing universities, The Ohio State University in Columbus, Miami University in Oxford and Ohio University in Athens, were distant and the region lacked a state-supported school of its own.
In 1910, the Ohio General Assembly passed the Lowry Normal School Bill that authorized Governor Judson Harmon to appoint the Commission on Normal School Sites to survey forty communities for two sites for normal schools, one in northeastern Ohio and one in northwestern Ohio.[tpl]cite web|work=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/colleges/library/cac/uarchives/bgc/page48675.html|title=Center for Archival Collections: Centennial Perspectives|accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl] The commission examined population within a [tpl]convert|25|mi|km|1|adj=on[/tpl] radius of each community, along with railroad and transportation infrastructure, the moral atmosphere, health and sanitary conditions and site suitability. Bowling Green offered four possible sites and became one of four finalists including Fremont, Napoleon, and Van Wert. Despite the town being the home of John Lowry, Napoleon was ruled out because the commission found it had numerous saloons. Fremont was eliminated mainly due to the specific stipulations imposed by the President Rutherford B. Hayes Memorial Commission. Bowling Green was chosen on November 10, 1910 over Van Wert in a 3–2 vote by the commission. The site located on [tpl]convert|82.5|acre|km2[/tpl] of primarily rural land and a small town park,[tpl]cite web|work=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1910/|title=Timeline: 1910's Decade|accessdate=July 22, 2011[/tpl] nearby railroad and transportation infrastructure, its central location in the region, and  Bowling Green's dry status were major factors that the town was chosen by the commission. At the same time, the commission chose Kent for a school in Northeastern Ohio. Over the years 1911 and 1912, the Board of Trustees was appointed by the Governor and elected a school president on February 16, 1912. A campus plan was created and $150,000 was appropriated to develop the campus and construct the first buildings.[tpl]cite web|work=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1910/page20779.html|title=Timeline: 1911|accessdate=April 10, 2012[/tpl]
The school opened on September 15, 1914 as Bowling Green State Normal School in two temporary locations at the Bowling Green Armory and at a branch school in Toledo for the 1914–1915 academic year.[tpl]cite web|work=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1910/page20874.html|title=Timeline: 1914|accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl] It initially enrolled 304 students from Ohio, Michigan, and New York who were taught by 21 faculty members. The school graduated its first class in 1915, consisting of 35 certified teachers. University Hall and Williams Hall opened that year, the school's first two permanent buildings. Two years later the first baccalaureate degrees for teacher education were awarded. On March 28, 1920 a tornado, part of the 1920 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak, damaged three of the school's buildings.[tpl]cite web|work=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1920/page21114.html|title=Timeline: 1920|accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl] The tornado touched down near Bowling Green and strengthened as it moved into Ottawa County where it killed two people in Genoa.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Ohio Historical Society|url=http://www.ohiohistory.org/etcetera/exhibits/swio/pages/content/1920_tornadoes.htm|title=March 28, 1920: Western Tornadoes|accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl]

===Early growth and development===

Over the next decade the school expanded academic facilities, athletics and student life, as enrollment grew to over 900 students.[tpl]cite web|work=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1920/page21147.html|title=Timeline: 1926|accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl] 
On October 28, 1927, Ivan "Doc" Lake, a BGSU graduate and sports editor of the Daily Sentinel-Tribune, established the nickname “Falcons".[tpl]cite web|work=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1920/page21150.html|title=Timeline: 1927|accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl] Lake thought the falcon was a fitting nickname because the falcon is a small but powerful bird of prey, and like the athletes, goes through extensive preparations and training. He also thought the nickname fit with the school's colors.[tpl]cite web|last1=Bowers|first1=Ann|last2=Swaisgood|first2=Linda K.|work=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/mc/magazine/fall03/BGSU_History_and_Traditions.pdf|title=The History And Traditions of BGSU|accessdate=April 8, 2011[/tpl] Prior to Lake's creation of the nickname, sports writers used various others, including: “B.G. Normals,” “Teachers,” and the “B.G. Pedagogues". The school achieved the status of college in 1929 when the Emmons-Hanna Bill changed renamed it to Bowling Green State College (BGSC).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1920/page21158.html | title=Timeline: 1929 | publisher=Bowling Green State University| accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl] At the same time, the college expanded its curriculum through the addition of the College of Liberal Arts, now known as the College of Arts and Sciences.[tpl]cite web|work=Bowling Green State University|title=College of Arts and Sciences|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/colleges/as/page23385.html|accessdate=April 8, 2011[/tpl]
Enrollment levels held steady into the Great Depression; but in 1933, the Ohio State Senate Welfare Commission proposed a plan to convert the school into a mental health institution.[tpl]cite web|work=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1930/|title=Timeline: 1930s|accessdate=April 8, 2011[/tpl] Students, faculty and administrators organized with the Bowling Green community to counter the proposal. The Student Protest Committee coordinated with the faculty and administration to organize a campus rally and march through the downtown Bowling Green. Members of the Protest Committee then launched a letter-writing campaign to community leaders throughout northwest Ohio, which helped convince the state legislature that closing the school would be counterproductive. The measure was defeated by a 14–5 vote. A few years later, in May 1935, the college was granted university status and changed its name to Bowling Green State University.
The university added the College of Business Administration to the existing College of Education and College of Liberal Arts.[tpl]cite web|work=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1930/page21288.html|title=Timeline: 1935|accessdate=February 27, 2011[/tpl] Within a year BGSU added master’s degree programs in Education, English, History, Social Science and Mathematics. In 1939, the university established The Committee for Gifts, Endowments, and Memorials, its first private endowment fund.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1930/page21293.html|title=Timeline: 1939|accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl]

===World War II, Post-war era expansion===

The 1940s, including World War II and its aftermath, brought big changes to BGSU. The war caused a drastic decrease in male enrollment and by 1943, the university canceled dances and formals, citing the lack of male students.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1940/page21322.html|title=Timeline: 1943|accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl] The university continued expanding facilities including its first student union, The Falcon’s Nest, and new cottage-style dorms for social groups and learning-living communities, and dedication of the Wood County airport.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1940/page21319.html|title=Timeline: 1941|accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl] Bowling Green was one of 240 colleges and universities to take part in the V-5 and V-12 Navy College Training Programs to supplement the lower enrollment during the war.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1940/page21323.html|title=Timeline: 1944|accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl] The programs offered students a path to a Navy commission, enrolling cadets in regular college courses as well as naval training. Faculty were added to accommodate the military training programs.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1940/page21328.html|title=Timeline: 1945|accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl] Student life adapted to the wartime era with efforts such as the War Relief Committee, blood drives and War Bonds initiatives.
In the post-war era, BGSU constructed temporary structures to keep up with the increased housing demands for veterans and their families.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/colleges/library/cac/uarchives/uatour/page50032.html|title=BGSU Historic Campus Tour: The "Huts"/Barracks/Falcon Heights|accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl] BGSU added 40 trailers to house male and married students in 1945, known as "Falcon Heights". In 1946, the university added 15 steel buildings to house male students in an area near the football stadium that became known as "Tin Pan Alley". By the late 1940s, the student house shortage became so severe that the nearby National Guard Armory and ODOT garage were converted to house male students. The Federal Housing Authority provided two wooden barracks, ten trailers, and more steel buildings. The BGSU Army ROTC was established on campus in 1948 as enrollment increased dramatically in the post war era.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1940/page21339.html|title=Timeline: 1948|accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl]  The university continued to add academic programs as the enrollment increased during the mid to late 1940s, including the Graduate School in 1948 after Dr. Emerson Shuck led the effort to create school. By 1950, enrollment grew to new record highs, with over 4,000 students.

===McDonald era===

1951 saw major changes when Ralph W. McDonald was appointed the fourth president in school history, following the retirement of Frank Prout. McDonald was the first university president from outside Ohio and came to BGSU with a focus on improving teacher education and certification standards. Prior to becoming president, he served as the Executive Secretary of the Department of Higher Education of the National Education Association for seven years. Under McDonald, BGSU reorganized its three colleges to group common departments together within each college. Reflecting the Cold War era, BGSU added an Air Force ROTC program and a Department of Air Science and Tactics.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1950/page21416.html|title=Timeline: 1951|accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl] BGSU continued to add programs and in the early 1950s added a Master of Education (M.Ed.) and a Master of Science (M.S.) in Education. 
The university constructed new residence halls during the decade, Prout Hall in 1955 and Founders Quadrangle in 1957.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1950/|title=Timeline: 1950s Decade|accessdate=February 27, 2012[/tpl] The new student center opened in 1958, after four years of construction at a cost of $2.75 million.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/colleges/library/cac/uarchives/uatour/page49977.html|title=BGSU Historic Campus Tour: Bowen-Thompson Student Union|accessdate=February 25, 2012[/tpl] In the years 2012-2014, the residence hall was renovated and remodeled.  This renovation updated the rooms, bathrooms, lobbies and outside sidewalks and walkways.

===1960–1990: Diverse Growth===

The College of Education experienced rapid growth and expansion during the 1960s when the university added various specialized education programs, including majors in special education, school psychology, guidance and counseling and vocational rehabilitation counseling. It expanded arts and music programs when the music department became the College of Education's first "school", renamed the School of Music in 1961. Specializations in guidance and counseling were added to the Master of Arts and Master of Education degrees in 1964; as well as a new department for teaching college administration.

==Campuses==

===Main===

The main academic and residential campus is located on the northeast side of Bowling Green. The campus is arranged in a rectangle roughly one and a half miles long and one mile wide. It includes over 116 buildings on [tpl]convert|1338|acre|km2[/tpl]. The campus is bordered by Wooster Street to the south, Thurstin Avenue to the west, Poe Road to the north, and I-75 to the east. The university also owns buildings and parking lots throughout Bowling Green and the Bowling Green Research Enterprise Park just east of I-75. Ridge Street and East Merry Street run east-west through campus and Mercer Street bisects campus on a north-south axis.
The oldest portion of the BGSU campus is located in the southwest corner. It contains the oldest buildings on campus and was the original location. This area offers green space with large trees and historic buildings built in the early 1900s. Administrative services and classrooms occupy these buildings. Although not part of the historic section, Founders Hall, a large dorm, is located on the Southwest corner. Hanna Hall houses The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Film Theater and Gallery.
