Ulrich Wilcken (December 18, 1862 - December 10, 1944) was a German historian and papyrologist who was a native of Stettin.
Wilcken studied ancient history and Oriental studies in Leipzig, Tübingen and Berlin. He was a disciple of historian Theodor Mommsen (1817-1903), who encouraged Wilcken to take a position as cataloguer of papyri following graduation. Mommsen was also instrumental in Wilcken succeeding Eduard Meyer (1855-1930) as associate professor of ancient history at Breslau in 1889. Afterwards he was a professor at Würzburg (1900), Halle (1903, where he was again a successor to Eduard Meyer), Leipzig (1906) and Bonn (1912), where he succeeded Heinrich Nissen (1839-1912). Later he worked at Munich (1915) and Berlin (1917), where he was successor to Otto Hirschfeld (1843-1922).
Wilcken was a German pioneer of Greco-Roman papyrology, and is credited for amassing an extensive archive of Ptolemaic papyri documents and ostraca. 
In 1906 he became a member of the Saxon Society of Sciences, and in 1921, he became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.
