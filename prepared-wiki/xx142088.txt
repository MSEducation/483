The Round Tower Lodge was situated in the central reservation of the A556 road in Sandiway, Cheshire, England.  It was designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building.[tpl]NHLE |num= 1227728|desc= The Round Tower, Cuddington|accessdate= 12 September 2013|separator=,|ps=[/tpl]
The tower was all that survived of a gate lodge to the house of Vale Royal Abbey.  The lodge was built on the main Chester to Manchester road as an entrance to Vale Royal's New Park and was linked to the house by a driveway containing a second lodge building, Monkey Lodge.  The tower was a circular, two-storey building constructed of sandstone.  On top of the tower was a crenellated parapet.  On the south-west elevation was a planked and studded oak door built into a Gothic-style arch.  There were also three Gothic-style windows.  Above the door and windows were four unglazed crossloops.  To the east of the tower was a short stub wall which used to be part of a square single-storey room which was integral with the tower's construction.  It was built in the early 19th century but the exact date of its construction has not been recorded.  Also the name of the architect is unknown.Wood, Jason, 'New Research on the Round Tower, Sandiway' Cheshire History:46, 2006-2007, pp. 119-127. This discusses, amongst other things the date of construction and the name of the architect.
The gate to the house lay to the west of the tower the posts of which were connected to the lodge by a low boundary wall surmounted by iron railings.  In late 19th and early 20th century additions were made to the eastern room.  There was an extension consisting of another square stone structure and there is evidence of yet a further extension which was probably a lean-to shed-like structure.  In 1871 the lodge was tenanted by a shepherd named William Ree who lived there with his family.  The last occupants, in the 1920s, were Hughie Preston and his wife.  The tower itself provided the main living quarters, the first extension was the bedroom and the extension beyond that was the kitchen.
Towards the end of the 19th century New Park was renamed Pettypool Park and after World War I it became Sandiway Golf Course.  Other than the tower, the lodge buildings were demolished when the main road was converted into a four-lane dual carriageway in the 1930s, the tower becoming stranded in the central reservation.  The old road was retained as the eastbound carriageway and the westbound carriageway was added to the south of the tower.  It was owned by the Highways Agency who carried out repairs which were completed in 2002.  It was a Grade II listed building and is included in the Sandiway Conservation Area.
On 14 November 2013, the Round Tower Lodge was badly damaged when a car collided with it. The tower was declared to be unsafe, and was demolished.[tpl]Citation | last = Bebbington | first = Gina| author-link = | publication-date = 15 November 2013 | date = | year = | title = Round Tower demolished after crash| periodical = Northwich Guardian| series = | publication-place = | place = | publisher = Newsquest(Northwest)| volume = | issue = | pages = | url = http://www.northwichguardian.co.uk/news/10812219.Round_Tower_demolished_after_crash/| archiveurl = | archivedate = | issn = | pmid = | pmc = | doi = | oclc = | accessdate =15 November 2013[/tpl]  A social media campaign to rebuild the tower was subsequently started by local residents.[tpl]cite web|last=Bysouth|first=Alex|title=Campaign to rebuild A556 Round Tower|url=http://www.northwichguardian.co.uk/news/10812655.Campaign_to_rebuild_A556_Round_Tower/|work=Northwich Guardian|publisher=Newsquest|accessdate=15 November 2013[/tpl]  In response, Cheshire West and Chester Council stated that the tower materials had been stored and a reconstruction was already planned; costs were to be pursued from the driver's insurance company.Cheshire West and Chester: Famous Northwich landmark seriously damaged (accessed 16 November 2013)
