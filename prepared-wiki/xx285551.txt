He is the author of  Explore Everything: Place-Hacking the City,[tpl]cite book|author=Bradley L.

Although Garrett has published academic research, he is perhaps better known for his photographic and video work connected to this project which has received worldwide media attention.

==Education==

Garrett received a B.S. in anthropology and B.A. in history from the University of California, Riverside in 2003 before moving to Australia to undertake an MSc in maritime archaeology at James Cook University in 2005. He did his first ethnographic research with the Winnemem Wintu tribe in Northern California about loss of access to ancestral land inundated by the construction of Shasta Dam. He then worked for the Bureau of Land Management as an archaeologist.[tpl]cite web|last=Garrett|first=Bradley|title=Drowned Memories: the Submerged Places of the Winnemem Wintu|url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11759-009-9109-9|publisher=Archaeologies: the Journal of the World Archaeology Congress|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] In 2008, Garrett moved to the United Kingdom where he completed a PhD in social and cultural geography at the University of London, with a thesis entitled Tales of Urban Exploration.[tpl]cite web|last=Godwin|first=Richard|title=On a Mission with London's Urban Explorers|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/esmagazine/on-a-mission-with-londons-urban-explorers-7851504.html|publisher=Evening Standard Magazine|date=15 June 2012|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] He was supervised by the human geographer Tim Cresswell.

==Career==

Garrett currently works at the School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford. His research interests are at the intersections of cultural geography, archaeology and visual methods. Garrett describes himself as a researcher, explorer and photographer and writes that his research is about "finding the hidden in the world".[tpl]cite web|last=Garrett|first=Bradley|title=Bradleygarrett|url=http://www.bradleygarrett.com|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Oxford Geography Staff Profile|url=http://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/bgarrett.html|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]
His most significant work is Explore Everything: Place-Hacking the City. The book describes the exploits of the London Consolidation Crew (LCC), a group urban explorers in London who trespassed into hundred of locations over four years in an attempt to "reveal the hidden city".[tpl]cite journal|last=Garrett|first=Bradley|title=Undertaking Recreational Trespass: Urban Exploration and Infiltration|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|date=31 July 2013|doi=10.1111/tran.12001|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tran.12001/pdf|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Garrett|first=Bradley|title=Dr|year=2013|publisher=Verso Books|isbn=1781681295|url=http://www.amazon.com/Explore-Everything-Place-Hacking-Bradley-Garrett/dp/1781681295/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1376292503&sr=8-1&keywords=explore+everything[/tpl] Garrett claims the goal of this work was to re-map London by exposing the ways in which surveillance and control are embedded in modern spatial planning. Garrett suggests surveillance is subverted and rendered inert through the urban explorer's "place hack" when control of the city is temporarily taken back through creative practice.
Garrett and the LCC came to notoriety first in 2011 when they released photos of the mothballed London Post Office Railway, a 6.5-mile subterranean train network used by the Post Office to transport letters across the city.[tpl]cite news|title=En fotos: Viaje a uno de los secretos mejor guardados de Londres|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/video_fotos/2011/05/110428_galeria_londres_correo_trenes_exploradores_rg.shtml|accessdate=12 August 2013|newspaper=BBC Mundo|date=3 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The London Post Office Railway|url=http://www.silentuk.com/?p=2792|publisher=SilentUK|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]  The next year, the group (with Garrett) climbed the Shard, the European Union's tallest skyscraper, before it was completed and released photos from the top of the building.[tpl]cite web|last=Andrews|first=Emily|title='Urban explorer' scales London's 1,000ft Shard|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2127056/Shard-hacking-Urban-explorer-Bradley-Garrett-scales-Europes-tallest-building.html|publisher=Daily Mail|date=9 April 2012|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]  Near the end of his research project, Garrett followed the LCC as they systematically infiltrated  abandoned Tube stations in the London Underground without permission and posted photos online.[tpl]cite web|last=Garrett|first=Bradley|title=Hacking the London Underground|url=http://www.placehacking.co.uk/2011/03/29/hacking-london-underground/|publisher=Place Hacking[/tpl] He has made a number of appearances in UK media discussing these explorations.[tpl]cite web|title=Invisible Cities|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01jg7zg|publisher=BBC Radio 3|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Hannah|first=Booth|title=Big picture: Urban Exploration, by Bradley Garrett|url=http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/sep/21/urban-exploration-bradley-garrett-photography|publisher=The Guardian|date=21 September 2012|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]

==Controversy==

Garrett has been criticised for becoming too close to his project participants and failing to maintain objective distance.[tpl]cite web|last=Luke|first=Bennett|title=Exploring the Bunker|url=http://societyandspace.com/2011/06/10/exploring-the-bunker-a-response-by-luke-bennett-to-%E2%80%98shallow-excavation%E2%80%99/|publisher=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]  Four of his project participants were arrested inside the London Tube on Easter 2011,[tpl]cite web|last=Davinport|first=Justin|title=Terror alert at 7/7 Tube station blamed on four urban explorers|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/news/terror-alert-at-77-tube-station-blamed-on-four-urban-explorers-6397538.html|publisher=Evening Standard|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] He was later himself arrested on the Tarmac at Heathrow Airport during pre-dawn house raids on the LCC by British Transport Police investigating the group's means of access to abandoned Tube stations. Garrett maintains that he does ethnography in the tradition of the Chicago school (sociology) and claims the only way to understand a culture is to become fully immersed in it.
Garrett has been labelled as "masculinist",[tpl]cite web|last=Mott|first=Carrie|title=Not Everyone Has (the) Balls: Urban Exploration and the Persistence of Masculinist Geography|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/anti.12033/abstract|publisher=Antipode|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] while others have disputed this (compared to other members of the urbex community) but suggested Explore Everything was guilty of "solipsistic teenaged philosophizing".[tpl]cite web|last=Stevens|first=Andrew|title=The map is not the territory|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/the-map-is-not-the-territory/|publisher=3:AM Magazine|accessdate=31 December 2013[/tpl]
