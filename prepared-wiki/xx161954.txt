Farm to Market Road 525, or FM 525 or Urban Road 525, is a state highway entirely inside the city of Houston, Texas, United States.  The road is known locally as Aldine-Bender Road.
FM 525 was established in 1945 as a route between the unincorporated areas of Aldine and Bender before Beltway 8 was established.  Both areas are now inside the Houston city limits.
In 1995 the state officially retired FM 525 in favor of Urban Road 525, but the term is not used by the public, and in fact, the road is rarely referred to as a state highway.[tpl]Or|date=June 2011[/tpl]

==Route description==

FM 525 begins at an interchange with I-45 in Houston, Harris County, heading east on Aldine Bender Road, a six-lane divided highway. The road soon becomes a seven-lane road with a center left-turn lane as it continues past residential neighborhoods with some businesses. The highway becomes the border between Houston to the north and an unincorporated area to the south as it continues through commercial areas. FM 525 comes to an interchange with the Hardy Toll Road, at which point it also crosses over a Union Pacific railroad line that runs to the west of the toll road. Past this interchange, the road heads through the community of Aldine, passing more businesses. The highway crosses a creek and continues into a mix of residential and commercial establishments, crossing back into Houston at the John F. Kennedy Boulevard intersection. Here, the road passes areas of warehouses and woods before heading back into unincorporated areas and passing near homes. FM 525 turns south onto Lee Road and comes to its terminus at an interchange with I-69/US 59.[tpl]google maps|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=I-45+Frontage+Rd&daddr=29.9321341,-95.362538+to:Farm-To-Market+Rd+525%2FLee+Rd&hl=en&ll=29.92935,-95.357037&spn=0.072153,0.169086&sll=29.932825,-95.35754&sspn=0.07215,0.169086&geocode=FbS4yAEdxCNQ-g%3BFWa6yAEdFuJQ-ildz8HTQrZAhjGtIyibp5U_8w%3BFbCfyAEdPctR-g&vpsrc=0&mra=ls&via=1&t=h&z=13|title=overview of Farm to Market Road 525|accessdate=October 20, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite map|publisher=Texas Department of Transportation|title=County Grid Map 561|url=http://www.txdot.gov/travel/countymapbook2006/Pages/561.pdf|year=2010|accessdate=October 12, 2011[/tpl]
