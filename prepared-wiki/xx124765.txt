==Biography==

Per Aabel was the son of  Hauk Aabel, a popular Norwegian comedian and actor in Norwegian and Swedish silent film. He studied at Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in London, after studying at the ballet teacher Enrico Cecchetti. He also attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Paris. He then embarked on training with the theatre director Max Reinhardt in Vienna before making his stage debut in 1931.Per Aabel (Dagbladet Faktaboks Personalia, 23 December 1999)
Aabel spent a number of years as a principal actor and teacher with major theatre companies in Oslo during the 1930s, and was the director of  Carl Johan Teatret  between 1933 to 1938. He did not appear in film until the late 1930s.  He is more renowned though for his work with the Norwegian theatre. He was employed at the Centralteatret from 1938 to 1940 and the Nationaltheatret from 1940 to 1972.
In the public mind he is probably best remembered as an esteemed raconteur. After his retirement, Per Aabel was a frequent entertainer on television as a storyteller. He appeared frequently at national events and artist anniversaries. His statue, by Norwegian sculptor Nina Emilie Sundbye, was unveiled outside the stage entrance of the Nationaltheatret in 1999.
