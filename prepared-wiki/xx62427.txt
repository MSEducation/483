The Board of Ordnance was a British government body responsible for the supply of armaments and munitions to the  Royal Navy (until 1830) and British Army. It was also responsible for providing artillery trains for armies and maintaining coastal fortresses and, later, management of the artillery and engineer corps.  It also produced maps for military purposes, a function later taken over by the Ordnance Survey. The board existed under various names from 1414 until 1855, with headquarters in the Tower of London.

==History==

The introduction of gunpowder to Europe led to innovations in offensive weapons such as cannon and defences such as fortifications. In the 1370s, to manage the new technology, the royal household appointed a courtier to administer weapons, arsenals and castles. The office and main arsenal were located in the White Tower of the Tower of London.Royal Engineers Museum - The Corps, Ordnance and its Train (1370-1713) - Part 2 The earliest known Master of Ordnance was Nicholas Merbury, appointed about 1415-1420 by Henry V of England.

The Board of Ordnance consisted of six principal officers:
In 1830, the principal officers were reduced to four by the abolition of the posts of Lieutenant-General and Clerk of the Deliveries.
The Treasurer of the Ordnance was also an important officer of the department, although he did not sit on the board. This office was consolidated with several others in 1836 to form that of Paymaster-General. A number of other inferior officers reported to the board, such as clerks, storekeepers, engineers, and master gunners.

Almost fifty years later, after the Second Boer War, and unease that the British Army had been ill-equipped, a new office called the Ordnance Board was created. It consists of a board of munitions experts, whose purpose was to advise the Army Council on the safety and approval of weapons. The Ordnance Board, and its name, survived within the Ministry of Defence until the mid-1990s when it was renamed the Defence Ordnance Safety Group. Long before then, the Ordnance Board had extended its scope to encompass more than just the safety and approval of the Armyâ€™s ordnance.
