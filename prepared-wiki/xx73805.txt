==Parentage==

The parentage of John XI is still a matter of dispute.  According to Liutprand of Cremona (Antapodosis, ii. c. 48) and the "Liber Pontificalis," he was the natural son of Pope Sergius III (904–911), ("Johannes, natione Romanus ex patre Sergio papa," "Liber Pont." ed. Duchesne, II, 243).  Ferdinand Gregorovius,[ref]
