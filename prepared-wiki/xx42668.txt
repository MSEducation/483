[[Dead Serious]]

CATEGORIES: Crime in the United States, Organizations based in Fort Worth, Texas

Dead Serious is an organization in Fort Worth, Texas which offers $5,000 to any member that kills a criminal in self-defense. Membership is ten dollars. The leader of the group is Darrel Frank, who was previously convicted for burglary and assault. Law enforcement officers and felons are excluded from this offer, meaning that Darrel Frank himself could not be able to accept the money since he is a felon.
The group's motto is "Anti Crime Zero Tolerance" and they own a black hearse as an official vehicle.
The Fort Worth Star-Telegram covered the story in February 1995, which sent an initial avalanche of media coverage from around the world towards the newly founded organization.
