==In fiction==

Dolabella is a minor character in the Colleen McCullough novel Fortune's Favourites. In the novel, just prior to the Battle of the Colline Gate, he blackmails Sulla into giving him the consulship in return for his support, which he threatened to withdraw due to Sulla's decision to pass him over when Sulla gave the command of one of his wings to Marcus Licinius Crassus.
