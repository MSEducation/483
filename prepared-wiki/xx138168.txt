The station logo represents some angels, as the city is commonly called The City of Angels.
The station is elevated, and has two entrances on opposite sides of the avenue. Street vendors occupy the areas around the station entrances and a bus depot is underneath the metro Line. Puebla is often used by commuters wishing to cross the city from the east, who wish to avoid the relative overcrowding of the terminal station Pantitlán.
