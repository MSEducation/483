Participation in the Ottawa Treaty
]]
This is a list of states that have signed and ratified or acceded to the Ottawa Treaty (also known as the Mine Ban Treaty).  The treaty, which outlaws anti-personnel mines, was opened for signature on December 3, 1997.  Canada, Ireland, and Mauritius became the first states to ratify the treaty that same day.  The treaty came into force and closed for signature on March 1, 1999 with the ratification by 40 states. Since then, states that did not sign the treaty can now only accede to it. Currently, 161 states have ratified or acceded to the treaty, and one state (Marshall Islands) had signed the treaty but not ratified it.United Nations Treaty Collection: Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction.
