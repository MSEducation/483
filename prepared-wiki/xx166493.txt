==Publisher==

Hotten's perseverance established him among the best-known publishers, and he moved to a larger shop. In 1866, the publisher Edward Moxon issued Algernon Charles Swinburne’s Poems and Ballads, which brought a charge of indecency and forced Moxon to withdraw the work from circulation.[tpl]cite book | first=Yopie | last=Prins | title=Victorian Sappho | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-691-05919-5 | page=153 [/tpl] Hotten offered himself as the poet’s publisher, and issued the volume in dispute as well as Swinburne’s response to his critics.[tpl]cite book | first=Walter M. | last=Kendrick | title=The secret museum: pornography in modern culture | publisher=University of California Press | year=1996 | isbn=0-520-20729-7 | page=168 [/tpl] Cecil Lang claims in his preface to Swinburne's Letters that Hotten had effectively blackmailed Swinburne into providing him with pornographic verse.Allison Pease, "Modernism, mass culture, and the aesthetics of obscenity", Cambridge University Press, 2000, ISBN 0-521-78076-4, p.203 Hotten subsequently published Swinburne’s Song of Italy (1867) and William Blake: a Critical Essay (1868).
