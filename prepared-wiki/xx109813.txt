==History==

In 1997, the Accafellas released their debut album, Accafellas Volume I.  It is currently out of print.
In 1998, at the University of Michiganâ€™s Monsters of A Cappella concert, the relatively new Accafellas received a standing ovation from a pro-wolverine crowd.
In 2000, the Accafellas released a second album, appropriately "Accafellas Volume II".
In 2004, the Accafellas released "Accafellas Volume III".  The album feels much more produced than the first two albums, and would be a great influence on future Accafellas' members as a high-quality album to strive to outdo.
In 2006, the Accafellas released "Accafellas Volume IV".  Their version of the song You and I Both originally by Jason Mraz appeared on the Best of College a Cappella compilation that year.
On April 4, 2009, the Accafellas released "Accafellas Volume V".  The album was recorded at Ryan Wert's Elm Street Recording Studio in Lansing, MI.  Ryan Wert claimed that Volume V was "The most ambitious of the CD's (he's) recorded." http://lansingrecording.com/?p=136
On June 11, 2010, the Accafellas performed the song Would You Go With Me with Josh Turner in Nashville, Tennessee, at his fan club party before the CMA Music Festival.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj9TFiu7XSE
In Addition, The Accafellas have competed in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA). They have won awards at these competitions for their arrangements and soloists, most notably advancing to the regional semi-finals in 2008. 
 In 2012, The Accafellas received two awards at their ICCA quarterfinal.  Joe Caigoy won "Best Soloist" singing "Without You", and Jake Przybyla, Duncan Cooper and Richard Hofmeister won "Best Arrangement" for the song "Clocks".
 
The Accafellas started recording "Accafellas Volume VII" in 2012, most likely for release in 2013.

==The Sing-Off==

The Accafellas auditioned for Season 1 of NBC's The Sing-Off.  They advanced to the interview stage of the show, and were filmed performing Eric Clapton's "Wonderful Tonight" outside of the audition venue.[tpl]fact|date=May 2013[/tpl]
