==Vagueness of "screamo"==

While the genre was developing in the early 1990s, it was not initially called "screamo". Chris Taylor, lead vocalist for the band Pg. 99, said "we never liked that whole screamo thing. Even during our existence, we tried to venture away from the fashion and tell people, 'Hey, this is punk.'" Jonathan Dee of The New York Times wrote that the term "tends to bring a scornful laugh from the bands themselves."[tpl]cite news| last = Dee| first = Jonathan| title = The Summer of Screamo| work = The New York Times| date = June 29, 2003| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/29/magazine/the-summer-of-screamo.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all| accessdate = September 11, 2010[/tpl] Lars Gotrich of NPR Music made the following comment on the matter:Lars Gotrich, Pg. 99: A Document Revisited: NPR Music Interview
Allmusic has noted that the term screamo can sometimes be vague, and that even bands that weren't necessarily screamo would often use the style's characteristic guttural vocal style. Derek Miller, guitarist for the band Poison the Well noted the term's constant differing usages and jokingly stated that it "describes a thousand different genres."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jimdero.com/OtherWritings/OtherScreamoGW.htm |title=Screamo |publisher=Jimdero.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-15[/tpl] According to Jeff Mitchell of Iowa State Daily, "there is no set definition of what screamo sounds like but screaming over once deafeningly loud rocking noise and suddenly quiet, melodic guitar lines is a theme commonly affiliated with the genre."[tpl]cite web| last = Mitchell| first = Jeff| title = A Screamin' Scene| work = Iowa State Daily| date = July 26, 2001| url = http://www.iowastatedaily.com/article_7c9f7210-850e-5905-af02-9bcdb2b07f3e.html| accessdate = September 11, 2010[/tpl] Bert McCracken, lead singer of The Used, stated that screamo is merely a term "for record companies to sell records and for record stores to categorize them."[tpl]cite journal|last=Greenwald|first=Andy|title=Screamo 101|journal=Entertainment Weekly|date=21 November 2003|issue= 738|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,543090,00.html|accessdate=2 August 2008[/tpl] Juan Gabe, vocalist for the band Comadre, alleged that the term "has been kind of tainted in a way, especially in the States."Jan, "Yellow is the new pink", 18-04-07
