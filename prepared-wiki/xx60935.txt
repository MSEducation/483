General Mitchell International Airport [tpl]airport codes|MKE|KMKE|MKE[/tpl] is a county-owned, joint civil-military,  public airport located five miles (8 km) south of the central business district of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
It is named after United States Army Air Service General Billy Mitchell, who was raised in Milwaukee and is often regarded as the father of the United States Air Force. Along with being the primary airport for Milwaukee, Mitchell International has sometimes been described as Chicago's third airport, as many travelers in the suburbs north of Chicago use it as an alternative to Chicago O'Hare and Chicago Midway.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.mitchellairport.com/memo/archive/0904/news1.html|title=Mitchell Offers Delay-Weary Chicago Travelers Timely Alternative|work=Mitchell Memo|date=September 2004|publisher=Mitchell International Airport[/tpl] It is also used by travellers throughout Wisconsin and Northern Illinois. An Amtrak railway station opened at the airport in 2005; the station is served by Amtrak's Hiawatha Service line running between Chicago and Milwaukee several times daily. The airport's weather station is used as the official point for Milwaukee weather observations and records by the National Weather Service, whose area office is located in Sullivan.

==History==

The original airfield was established in 1920 as Hamilton Airport by local business owner and aviator Thomas Hamilton. Milwaukee County purchased the land on October 19, 1926, for the Milwaukee County Airport. The first airport terminal there, the Hirschbuehl Farmhouse, opened in July of 1927. That same month, Northwest Airlines, Inc., began air service from Milwaukee to Chicago and Minneapolis/St. Paul. In August of 1927, world-renowned aviator Charles Lindbergh visited the Milwaukee airport. Kohler Aviation Corporation began providing passenger service across Lake Michigan on August 31, 1929. During the late depression years (from 1938 to July 1940), a new two-story passenger terminal building was constructed by the Works Progress Administration. On March 17, 1941, the airport was renamed General Mitchell Field after Milwaukee's military airpower advocate, Brigadier General William "Billy" Mitchell.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.historicmarkers.com/Wisconsin/Milwaukee_County_Wisconsin/General_Mitchell_Field_WI221/|title=Historic Markers - General Mitchell Field WI221|publisher=Milwaukee County Historical Society|year=1978|accessdate=October 4, 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070928131850/http%3A//www.historicmarkers.com/Wisconsin/Milwaukee_County_Wisconsin/General_Mitchell_Field_WI221/|archivedate=September 28, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] On January 4, 1945, Mitchell Field was leased to the War Department for use as a World War II prisoner-of-war camp. Over 3,000 prisoners and 250 enlisted men stayed at the work camp. Escaped German prisoners were often surprised to find a large German American population just beyond the fence.[tpl]cite book|first=Betty|last=Cowley|title=Stalag Wisconsin: Inside WW II prisoner-of-war camps|location=Oregon, Wisconsin|publisher=Badger Books|isbn=1-878569-83-X|oclc=48998212|year=2002[/tpl] The present terminal opened on July 20, 1955 and designed by Leigh Fisher and Associates.[tpl]cite news |title=Here's the Program|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xTMaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hiUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7329,2883243&dq=en|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal|date=July 21, 1955|accessdate=June 16, 2012[/tpl] It was renovated and expanded significantly in 1985, which was designed by Miller, Meier, Kenyon, Cooper Architects and Planners Inc.[tpl]cite news |title=Airport Terminal to Open Sunday|first=Dean|last=Jesen|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nKpRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aRIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3422,6689229&dq=en|newspaper=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=July 25, 1985|accessdate=June 16, 2012[/tpl]  The "hammerhead" section of the D concourse was added in 1990. On June 19, 1986, the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors officially renamed Mitchell Field to General Mitchell International Airport.
The airport is still owned and operated by Milwaukee County; however, some Milwaukee business leaders and politicians have advocated privatization or leasing it to a third party for financial reasons.[tpl]cite news |title=Lubar: Sell Airport to Eliminate Milwaukee County Deficit|first=Rich|last=Kirchen|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2008/09/22/story11.html?ana=from_rss|work=Milwaukee Business Journal|publisher=Bizjournals.com|date=September 21, 2008|accessdate=October 9, 2009[/tpl]

===Awards and recognition===

In October 2008, a Condé Nast Traveler poll ranked Milwaukee County’s General Mitchell International Airport fourth in the nation using categories of Location and Access, Design, Customs and Baggage, Perceived Safety and Security, as well as Food, Shops and Amenities.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]

===Expansion===

Mitchell International has expanded the runway safety area on their runways after an accident on January 21, 2007, when Northwest Airlines Flight 1726 skidded off the runway after aborting takeoff. According to the FAA, most airports are encouraged to have a runway safety area no shorter than [tpl]convert|1000|ft|m|0[/tpl], although many airports do not meet this requirement.
Construction to provide this runway safety area began at the end of the summer of 2009. Work was completed in the fall of 2012.
There is also a "Master Plan" idea to significantly increase terminal area by either stretching the existing terminal (in some cases, to almost double the size) or begin construction of an entirely separate terminal.  Nearly all cases will involve major reconstruction on the airport itself, and will have a huge impact on the airport's future traffic.[ref]

===Military presence===

The airport also hosts the General Mitchell Air National Guard Base on the eastern area of the airport property, home to the 128th Air Refueling Wing (128 ARW), an Air Mobility Command (AMC)-gained unit of the Wisconsin Air National Guard flying the KC-135R Stratotanker.  The wing performs both Federal and State missions and consists of approximately 1000 Air National Guard personnel, both full-time Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) and Air Reserve Technicians (ART), as well as traditional part-time guardsmen, available for worldwide deployment in support of Air Mobility Command and combatant commander tasking.  The wing also maintains a KC-135 flight simulator, providing training proficiency for its own crews as well as other KC-135 flight crews in other air refueling wings and air mobility wings in the Regular U.S. Air Force, the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard.
Prior to 2007, a second military installation on the southwestern portion of the airport property was known as "General Mitchell Air Reserve Station" and was home to the 440th Airlift Wing (440 AW), an Air Mobility Command (AMC)-gained unit of the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) flying the C-130H Hercules.  While based at General Mitchell ARS, the 440 AW numbered in excess of 1500 full-time AGR, ART and part-time traditional reservists.  Pursuant to Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 2005 action, the 440 AW relocated to Pope AFB, North Carolina in 2007 and the former AFRC facilities were turned over to the Air National Guard, resulting in the installation's renaming.
