Sabella is a company that designs, develops and manufactures tidal turbines. Based in Quimper, France, this company was established in 2008 and has now around 10 employees.About Sabella It was founded by four shareholders: Hydrohélix Énergie (32.5%), historical inventor of the technology, Sofresid Engineering (32.5%), subsidiary of Saipem specialized in Oil&Gas services industry and shipbuilding, In Vivo Environnement (25%), consultancy company specialized in marine environment and oceanography, and Dourmap (10%), electrical equipment manufacturer.3rd International Tidal Energy Summit 2009
Sabella is the Latin name of a marine tube worm, whose shape and movements remind those of a tidal turbine.

==History==

The original concept was imagined in 1999, after what the company Hydrohélix Énergies was created in 2000. Numerous studies were carried out in the following years, which resulted in the creation of the consortium Sabella in 2007 by present’s shareholders and of the company SABELLA SAS one year later.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] In 2008, Sabella immersed the first French underwater tidal turbine, named Sabella D03, at the Odet’s mouth near Bénodet, in South Brittany.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.meretmarine.com/fr/content/benodet-linstallation-complete-de-lhydrolienne-achevee-aujourdhui |title= Bénodet : L’installation complète de l’Hydrolienne achevée aujourd’hui |language=French |publisher=Mer et Marine |date=31 March 2008[/tpl] Thanks to experience acquired and results obtained with this project, the company decided to start a project of a pre-industrial full scale tidal turbine, Sabella D10. For this, Sabella applied in October 2009 to the call for expressions of interest “Marine Energy Demonstrators” from the ADEME (French Agency for Environment and Energy Management). Sabella, in partnership with IFREMER (French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea), Veolia Environnement and Bureau Veritas, was reported laureate of this call, which allows the project to be partly public funded.French know-how In the field of Renewable Energies Sabella D10 device is now under construction.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.entreprises.ouest-france.fr/article/hydrolienne-sabella-quimper-construction-est-lancee-05-09-2012-65848 |title= Hydrolienne Sabella à Quimper : la construction est lancée |language=French |publisher=Ouest France |date=5 September 2012[/tpl]

==Notable projects==

===Sabella D03 experiment===

Sabella D03 was an experimental project lead by the consortium Sabella with the support of public territorial authorities and ADEME, and technical support from IFREMER.Our solutions D03 feedback It consisted in designing, constructing and testing a 1/3 scale tidal turbine prototype. This prototype was immersed in April 2008 next to Bénodet, in Odet’s estuary in South Brittany, for one year. Its rotor has a diameter of 3 m and a power of 10 kW. A lot of tests and measures have been carried out, demonstrating among other things its innocuousness towards wildlife and low acoustic impact
This turbine it now exposed at the forecourt of the Ocean Discovery Park Océanopolis in Brest, for educational purposes.

===Sabella D10 pre-commercial demonstration project===

The demonstration project Sabella D10, supported by ADEME through the “Investments for the future” program, aims at developing a commercial-scale tidal turbine with a 10 m diameter and 1 MW rated power. The construction of this turbine started in June 2012. Carbon blades are being built by CDK Technologies, shipyard specialized in the construction of racing sailboats, located in Port-la-Forêt in Finistère, France.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.entreprises.ouest-france.fr/article/lentreprise-cdk-29-se-lance-dans-lhydrolienne-28-09-2012-68764 |title= L’entreprise CDK (29) se lance dans l’hydrolienne |language=French |publisher=Ouest France |date=28 September 2012[/tpl]
The turbine is expected to be immersed during the autumn 2014 in the Fromveur strait, between Ushant Island and Molène archipelago, at a 55 m depth. It will be connected to Ushant’s power grid, which should make it the first grid-connected turbine in France. It will stay immersed during one year and will be fully followed and monitored in order to get feedbacks on production, performance, resistance, environmental impacts, social acceptance…Ocean energy Opportunities in the French market
Several partners are involved in this project: Veolia Environnement for the Life Cycle Assessment of the turbine, IFREMER for underwater acoustic and materials aging in marine environment studies, and Bureau Veritas for validation of mechanical calculations and construction, and future certification.

===Partnership agreement with GDF SUEZ===

In June 2012, Sabella signed a partnership agreement with Eole Génération, subsidiary of GDF Suez which name is now GDF Suez Futures Énergies. This partnership between the energy utility company and the turbine designer aims at exploiting the tidal currents of the Fromveur site.Developing Tidal Power : Normandy Port Authority Announces Expansions Plans

===Eussabella===

Sabella has plans for a pilot farm in the Fromveur Strait, called Eussabella.French utilities, industrial companies make rapid moves to push tidal projects It would include a few devices (less than 10) and would provide electricity to Ushant Island, which is not connected to the mainland grid. Ushant’s electricity is currently produced by four diesel-fed engine-generators.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.letelegramme.fr/ig/generales/regions/finistere/ouessant-l-ile-privee-de-courant-hier-apres-midi-13-01-2013-1970089.php |title= Ouessant. L'île privée de courant hier après-midi |language=French |publisher=Le Télégramme |date=13 January 2013[/tpl] Associated with an energy storage system allowing electricity supply even during lower current velocity periods, the pilot farm would enable the island to save some or all of its fuel consumption. 
In the long run, Sabella plans to develop commercial farms, in the Fromveur strait but also at other places in France, in Europe and in the world.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.latribune.fr/regions/bretagne/20120814trib000713869/sabella-veut-aller-partout-ou-il-y-a-du-courant.html |title= Sabella veut aller partout où "il y a du courant" |language=French |publisher=La Tribune |date=15 August 2012[/tpl]

===Other technologies===

In addition to its underwater tidal turbines, Sabella has developed several concepts of river turbines. Its Canadian subsidiary “Sabella Energy Inc” has developed a prototype called “SR-01” (Sabella River).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.magazineconstas.com/Energie-et-ressources/2011-10-31/article-2948389/Marees-et-courants---Apres-les-eoliennes,-les-hydroliennes/1 |title= Marées et courants - Après les éoliennes, les hydroliennes |language=French |publisher=Constas |date=31 October 2011[/tpl] A concept of semi-submerged (floating) turbine is also investigated, with a technology named Sequana.

==Environmental and social impacts==

Due to its low rotating speed (10 to 15 rpm), the turbine should be harmless to underwater fauna and flora.Our solutions Technology and R&D Moreover, acoustic emission of Sabella D03 was measured during its one year immersion. It was demonstrated that the impact to underwater fauna (fishes, marine mammals and crustaceans) was very low. These results should be considered carefully as the acoustic signature varies between turbines and as the acoustic measurements at one site depend on the background noise (the higher the current is, the higher the background noise is). Finally, the turbine is stabilized with a gravity foundation, so that no drilling in the seabed is required, allowing complete reversibility of the site.
Sabella D10 project was favorably accepted by the Iroise Marine Nature Park, who defined in collaboration with Sabella an environmental survey protocol. The Iroise Marine Nature Park also declared itself in favor of a pilot farm in the Fromveur strait, while giving some recommendations in order to reduce the environmental impact.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lemarin.fr/articles/detail/items/le-parc-marin-diroise-nest-pas-contre-une-ferme-hydrolienne-dans-le-fromveur.html |title= Le parc marin d’Iroise n’est pas contre une ferme hydrolienne dans le Fromveur |language=French |publisher=Le Marin |date=28 May 2013[/tpl]
