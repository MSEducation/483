==Games==

===Driver===

The first game of the Driver series was released for the PlayStation on June 30, 1999 in the US. It was later released for Game Boy Color in April 2000, Windows in September 2000, Mac in December 2000, and iOS in December 2009. In the game, the player controls a former racecar driver turned undercover police detective named John Tanner. It featured a storyline inspired by 1970's car chase movies such as Bullitt (1968) and The Driver (1978) and based in four real-life cities; Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York City. It was the best selling game of the Driver series and an evolution of the freedom to explore a city as brought forth in the early "Grand Theft Auto" games.

===Driver 2===

The second installment in the Driver series was released for the PlayStation on November 13, 2000 in the US by Infogrames (now known as Atari), and later ported to the Game Boy Advance on October 4, 2002 in the US. It featured detective John Tanner once more, along with a new partner, detective Tobias Jones, in four more real-life cities (Chicago, Havana, Las Vegas, and Rio de Janeiro). It was the first game in the series to feature 2-player modes, curved roads, and the ability to get out of the car at any time in order to steal another car on the street.

===Driver 3===

The third installment in the Driver series and the first to get an M Rating by the ESRB (the first two were rated T), was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox on June 21, 2004 in the US to generally mixed or poor reviews (despite new features such as the ability to use firearms). The game takes place in Miami, Nice and Istanbul. It was subsequently followed by versions for the Windows, and Game Boy Advance.Driver 3 speeds onto the GBA - Game Boy Advance News at GameSpot The game sold rather well despite poor reviews, and Reflections paid notice to the complaints about the insipid story line, poor controls, and abundance of glitches in order to improve the series' standings with critics and gamers in Driver: Parallel Lines.

===Driver: Parallel Lines===

The fourth game in the series, Driver: Parallel Lines, was released March 14, 2006 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox in the US, and June 26, 2007 for Windows and Wii in the US. It is the most violent of the series—the first one to receive an 18 rating in the UK. Reflections intended Parallel Lines to "return the series to its roots" by focusing more on driving.
The game differs greatly in other aspects from its predecessors, though, as the story no longer follows undercover police officer Tanner and the game takes place in only one location, New York City. The new main player's name is TK, a criminal rather than a cop. The game includes two time periods, 1978 and 2006, when the main player is sentenced to prison for 28 years and returns in 2006. The game received better reviews, but unlike Driver 3, did not sell particularly well.

===Driver 76===

Driver 76 is a PlayStation Portable exclusive game in the Driver series. Set in New York City in 1976, two years before the events in the first half of Driver: Parallel Lines, the player takes the role of Ray, TK's friend and a supporting character from Parallel Lines. The game was developed by Sumo Digital and Reflections, and was the first Driver game published by Ubisoft after they acquired Reflections. It was released on May 8, 2007 in the US.

===Driver: San Francisco===

This fifth Driver game was long rumored to be in production.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2161804/atari-sells-reflections|title=Atari sells Reflections[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7460359.stm |title= How a computer game is made |accessdate=2008-06-18 |publisher= BBC |date= June 18, 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7460352.stm |title= UK games industry needs brains |accessdate=2008-06-18 |publisher= BBC |date= June 18, 2008 [/tpl]  After several years of speculation, Ubisoft finally unveiled Driver: San Francisco at E3 2010. After several delays, it was finally released on September 1, 2011 in Australia. 
The game takes place in only one location, San Francisco, and follows the series protagonist, Tanner, being in a coma after suffering an accident. Thus, the player controls Tanner during his coma dream.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/06/14/driver-san-francisco-coming-to-360-ps3-wii-and-pc//|title=Driver: San Francisco coming to 360, PS3, Wii and PC|publisher=Joystiq|date=2010-06-14|accessdate=2010-06-15[/tpl] The plot of the Wii version of Driver: San Francisco is completely different from the other versions. It is a prequel to the events of the original Driver.
For this game, developers decided to remove the ability of getting out of a car in order to steal another car on the street. Instead, they created a new mechanic called "Shift", enabling the players to shift to any car at any time.
The game received generally positive reviews, getting the highest ratings in the whole series after Driver 1. Like Driver 3, it sold particularly well.

===Driver: Renegade 3D===

Exclusive for the Nintendo 3DS, Driver: Renegade 3D follows John Tanner trying to take down the New York City crime mobs with his own hands. It was released on September 1, 2011 in Australia.

Vegas features his exploits in Las Vegas in an attempt to exact revenge on Charles Jericho after Driver 3, while LA Undercover, set two years later, features Tanner's exploits in Los Angeles to take down the Los Angeles Mafia by working his way up the ladder.

===C.O.P. The Recruit===

On November 3, 2009, Ubisoft released C.O.P. The Recruit for Nintendo DS. It was originally registered under numerous names, one of which being "Driver: The Recruit".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.onelastcontinue.com/7966/e3-2009-cop-the-recruit-drivers-little-brother/|title=E3 2009: C.O.P.
