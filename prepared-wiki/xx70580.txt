The question of how, when, where and why humans first entered the Americas is of intense interest to archaeologists and anthropologists, and has been a subject of heated debate for centuries. Several models for the Paleo-Indian settlement of America have been proposed by various academic communities. Modern biochemical techniques, as well as more thorough archaeology, have shed progressively more light on the subject.
Current understanding of human migration to and throughout the Americas derives from advances in four interrelated disciplines: archeology, physical anthropology, DNA analysis and linguistics. While there is general agreement that America was first settled from Asia by people who migrated across Beringia, the pattern of migration, its timing, and the place of origin in Asia of the peoples who migrated to America remains unclear.[tpl]cite news|title=Pause Is Seen in a Continent’s Peopling|work=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/13/science/linguistic-study-sheds-new-light-on-peopling-of-north-america.html?ref=science|date=13 Mar 2014[/tpl]
In recent years, researchers have sought to use familiar tools to validate or reject established theories, such as Clovis first.[tpl]cite journal|last=Gremillion |first=David H. |url=http://traumwerk.stanford.edu/archaeolog/2008/09/pre_siberian_human_migration_t.html |title=Archaeolog: Pre Siberian Human Migration to America: Possible validation by HTLV-1 mutation analysis |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000078 |publisher=Traumwerk.stanford.edu |date=2008-09-25 |accessdate=2010-10-12[/tpl] As new discoveries come to light, past hypotheses are reevaluated and new theories constructed. The archeological evidence suggests that the Paleo-Indians' first "widespread" habitation of America occurred during the end of the last glacial period or, more specifically, what is known as the late glacial maximum, around 16,500–13,000 years ago.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.94.5.1866|title=A single and early migration for the peopling of the Americas supported by mitochondrial DNA sequence data|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| author=Bonatto, Sandro L.; Salzano, Francisco M.|volume=94|pages=1866–1871|year=1997|pmc=20009|pmid=9050871[/tpl]

==Understanding the debate==

The chronology of migration models is currently divided into two general approaches.[tpl]cite book|author=Phillip M.

One factor fueling the debate is the discontinuity of archaeological evidence between North and South American Paleo-Indian sites. A roughly uniform techno-complex pattern, known as Clovis, appears in North and Central American sites from at least 13,500 years ago onwards.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=_6WBlUwYPa8C&pg=PA148&lpg=PA148&dq=clovis+theory+dead#v=onepage&q=clovis%20theory%20dead&f=false |title=Mammoths: Giants of the Ice Age |work=By Adrian Lister, Paul G. Bahn |isbn=978-0-7112-2801-6 |author1=Lister, Adrian |author2=Bahn, Paul G |date=2007-11-10 [/tpl] South American sites of equal antiquity do not share the same consistency and exhibit more diverse cultural patterns. Archaeologists conclude that the "Clovis-first", and Paleo-Indian time frame do not adequately explain complex lithic stage tools appearing in South America. Some theorists seek to develop a colonization model that integrates both North and South American archaeological records.
Indigenous Amerindian genetic studies indicate that the "colonizing founders" of the Americas emerged from a single-source ancestral population that evolved in isolation, likely in Beringia.Jody Hey, "On the Number of New World Founders: A Population Genetic Portrait of the Peopling of the Americas", Public Library of Science Biology, 3(6):e193 (2005)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1952074 |title=Beringian Standstill and Spread of Native American Founders |work=PLoS ONE (eISSN-1932-6203)[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news169474130.html |title=The peopling of the Americas: Genetic ancestry influences health|work=Scientific American[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = First Americans Endured 20,000-Year Layover - Jennifer Viegas, Discovery News | url = http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/02/13/beringia-native-american-02.html | accessdate = 2009-10-05 [/tpl] Age estimates based on Y-chromosome micro-satellite place diversity of the American Haplogroup Q1a3a (Y-DNA) at around 10,000 to 15,000 years ago.[tpl]cite book|first=Spencer Wells |title=The Journey of Man: A Genetic Odyssey|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=WAsKm-_zu5sC&lpg=PP1&dq=The%20Journey%20of%20Man&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=&f=false|format=Digitised online by Google books|publisher=Random House|isbn= 0-8129-7146-9|accessdate=2009-11-21|year=2002[/tpl](2003) "Y-Chromosome Evidence for Differing Ancient Demographic Histories in the Americas," (pdf) Maria-Catira Bortolini, Francisco M.

Migrants from northeastern Asia could have walked to Alaska with relative ease when Beringia was above sea level. But traveling south from Alaska to the rest of North America may have posed significant challenges. The two main possible southward routes proposed for human migration are: down the Pacific coast; or by way of an interior passage (Mackenzie Corridor) along the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains. When the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets were at their maximum extent, both routes were likely impassable. The Cordilleran sheet reached across to the Pacific shore in the west, and its eastern edge abutted the Laurentide, near the present border between British Columbia and Alberta.
Geological evidence suggests that the Pacific coastal route was open for overland travel before 23,000 years ago and after 15,000 years ago. During the coldest millennia of the last ice age, roughly 23,000 to 19,000 years ago, lobes of glaciers hundreds of kilometers wide flowed down to the sea. Deep crevasses scarred their surfaces, making travel across them dangerous. Even if people traveled by boat—a claim for which there is currently no direct archaeological evidence, as sea level rise has hidden the old coastline—the journey would have been difficult with abundant icebergs in the water. Around 15,000 to 13,000 years ago, the coast is presumed to have been ice-free. Additionally, by this time the climate had warmed, and lands were covered in grass and trees. Early Paleo-Indian groups could have readily replenished their food supplies, repaired clothing and tents, and replaced broken or lost tools.
Coastal or "watercraft" theories have broad implications, one being that Paleo-Indians in North America may not have been purely terrestrial big-game hunters, but instead were already adapted to maritime or semi-maritime lifestyles. Additionally, it is possible that "Beringian" (western Alaskan) groups migrated into the northern interior and coastlines only to meet their demise during the last glacial maximum, approximately 20,000 years ago,Dyke, A.S., A. Moore, and L. Robertson, 2003, Deglaciation of North America, Geological Survey of Canada Open File, 1574. (Thirty-two digital maps at 1:7,000,000 scale with accompanying digital chronological database and one poster (two sheets) with full map series.) leaving evidence of occupation in specific localized areas. However, they would not be considered a founding population unless they had managed to migrate south, populate and survive the coldest part of the last ice age.[tpl]cite web | title = First Americans Endured 20,000-Year Layover - Jennifer Viegas, Discovery News | url =http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/02/13/beringia-native-american.html | accessdate = 2009-11-18|quote=Archaeological evidence, in fact, recognizes that people started to leave Beringia for the New World around 40,000 years ago, but rapid expansion into North America didn't occur until about 15,000 years ago, when the ice had literally broken[/tpl] page 2

===Timeline of selected archaeological, geological and genetic evidence===

==Genetics and blood type==

By the 1920s studies indicated that blood type O was predominant in pre-Columbian populations, with a small admixture of type A in the north. Further blood studies combining statistics and genetic research were pioneered by Luigi Cavalli-Sforza and applied to population migrations predating historical records. This led Jacob Bronowski to assert in 1973 (in The Ascent of Man) that there were at least two separate migrations:  "I can see no sensible way of interpreting that but to believe that a first migration of a small, related kinship group (all of blood group O) came into America, multiplied, and spread right to the South. Then a second migration, again of small groups, this time containing either A alone or both A and O, followed them only as far as North America."[tpl]cite book|first1=Jacob |last1=Bronowski |title=The Ascent of Man |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WNJ3PwAACAAJ&cd=1&source=gbs_ViewAPI|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|isbn=0-563-10498-8|year=1975|pages=92–94[/tpl]  
Modern Amerindian genetics studies focus primarily on human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups and human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. The genetic pattern emerging shows two very distinctive genetic episodes occurred, first with the initial peopling of the Americas, and secondly with European colonization of the Americas.[tpl]cite book|first1=Spencer |last1=Wells |first2=Mark |last2=Read |title=The Journey of Man - A Genetic Odyssey|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=WAsKm-_zu5sC&lpg=PP1&dq=The%20Journey%20of%20Man&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=&f=false|format=Digitised online by Google books|publisher=Random House|isbn= 0-8129-7146-9|accessdate=2009-11-21|year=2002[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Learn about Y-DNA Haplogroup Q.

==Land bridge theory==

Also known as the Bering Strait Theory or Beringia theory, the Land Bridge theory has been widely accepted since the 1930s. The idea was first postulated in a rudimentary fashion in 1590 by the Jesuit scholar José de Acosta.[tpl]citation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vSCra8jUI2EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=1491&hl=en&src=bmrr&ei=VCySTvbcF8L10gGNiN0l&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=1491: new revelations of the Americas before Columbus|page=143|author=Charles C. Mann|publisher=Random House Digital|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4000-3205-1[/tpl] This model of migration into the New World proposes that people migrated from Siberia into Alaska, tracking big game animal herds. They were able to cross between the two continents by a land bridge called the Bering Land Bridge, which spanned what is now the Bering Strait, during the Wisconsin glaciation, the last major stage of the Pleistocene beginning 50,000 years ago and ending some 10,000 years ago, when ocean levels were [tpl]convert|60|m|ft|-1[/tpl] lower than today. This information is gathered using oxygen isotope records from deep-sea cores. An exposed land bridge that was at least [tpl]convert|1000|mi[/tpl] wide existed between Siberia and the western coast of Alaska. In the "short chronology" version, from the archaeological evidence gathered, it was concluded that this culture of big game hunters crossed the Bering Strait at least 12,000 years ago and could have eventually reached the southern tip of South America by 11,000 years ago.
Crossings by foot of the Bering Sea, however, are also possible when the sea is frozen.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/humber/4872348.stm | work=BBC News | title=Epic explorer crosses frozen sea | date=2006-04-03[/tpl]

===Synopsis===

At some point during the last Ice Age, about 17,000 years ago, as the ice sheets advanced and sea levels fell, people first migrated from the Eurasian landmass to the Americas. These nomadic hunters were following game herds from Siberia across what is, today the Bering Strait into Alaska, and then gradually spread southward. Based upon the distribution of Amerind languages and language families, a movement of tribes along the Rocky Mountain foothills and eastward across the Great Plains to the Atlantic seaboard is assumed to have occurred at least some 13,000 to 10,000 years ago.

===Clovis culture===

This big game-hunting culture has been labeled the Clovis culture, and is primarily identified by its artifacts of fluted projectile points. The culture received its name from artifacts found near Clovis, New Mexico, the first evidence of this tool complex, excavated in 1932. The Clovis culture ranged over much of North America and appeared in South America. The culture is identified by a distinctive Clovis point, a flaked flint spear-point with a notched flute by which it was inserted into a shaft. It could be removed from the shaft for traveling. This flute is one characteristic that defines the Clovis point complex.
Dating Clovis materials has been by association with animal bones and by carbon dating. Recent reexaminations of Clovis materials using improved carbon-dating methods produced results of 11,050 and 10,800 radiocarbon years B.P. (before present). This evidence suggests that the culture flowered somewhat later and for a shorter period of time than previously believed. Michael R. Waters of Texas A&M University in College Station and Thomas W. Stafford Jr., proprietor of a private-sector laboratory in Lafayette, Colorado and an expert in radiocarbon dating, attempted to determine the dates of the Clovis period. The heyday of Clovis technology has typically been set between 11,500 and 10,900 radiocarbon years B.P. (The radiocarbon calibration is disputed for this period, but the widely used IntCal04 calibration puts the dates at 13,300 to 12,800 calendar years B.P.). In a controversial move, Waters and Stafford conclude that no fewer than 11 of the 22 Clovis sites with radiocarbon dates are "problematic" and should be disregarded—including the type site in Clovis, New Mexico. They argue that the datable samples could have been contaminated by earlier material. This contention was considered highly controversial by many in the archaeological community.
