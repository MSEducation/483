The Bay of Chaleur is known for its phantom ship legend, which dates back more than two centuries.  [tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] The story (and witnesses) claim that a sailing ship burned in the waters north of the city, possibly from the Battle of the Restigouche, and is visible in certain weather and light conditions. A drawing of a ghost wielding an anchor and menacing two sailors could be seen on the city's old welcome sign. City Hall of Bathurst
