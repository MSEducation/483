The University of Notre Dame du Lac (or simply Notre Dame [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|n|oʊ|t|ər|ˈ|d|eɪ|m[/tpl] [tpl]respell|NOH|tər|DAYM|'[/tpl]) is a Catholic research university located near South Bend, Indiana, in the United States. In French, Notre Dame du Lac means "Our Lady of the Lake" and refers to the university's patron saint, the Virgin Mary.
The school was founded by Father Edward Sorin, CSC, who was also its first president. Today, many Holy Cross priests continue to work for the university, including as its president. It was established as an all-male institution on November 26, 1842, on land donated by the Bishop of Vincennes. The university first enrolled women undergraduates in 1972. [tpl]As of|2013[/tpl] about 48 percent of the student body was female.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsinfo.nd.edu/content.cfm?topicid=34|title=Overview – University of Notre Dame: News & Information|accessdate=February 7, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Notre Dame's Catholic character is reflected in its explicit commitment to the Catholic faith, numerous ministries funded by the school, and the architecture around campus.
The university today is organized into five colleges and one professional school, and its graduate program awards 32 master's and 25 doctoral degrees.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/sub.asp?key=748&subkey=14257&start=782|title=Carnegie Classifications: University of Notre Dame|accessdate=September 20, 2008|publisher=The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://graduateschool.nd.edu/pdf/info.quickfacts_07.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Graduate School: Quick facts|publisher=University of Notre Dame |accessdate=September 20, 2008[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Over 80% of the university's 8,000 undergraduates live on campus in one of 29 single-sex residence halls, each of which fields teams for more than a dozen intramural sports, and the university counts approximately 120,000 alumni.ND Alumni Association – Notre Dame Alumni Association
The university is known for its Notre Dame School of Architecture, a faculty that teaches (pre-modernist) traditional architecture and urban planning (e.g. following the principles of New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture).School of Architecture at the University of Notre Dame "Twenty years ago the curriculum was reformed to focus on traditional and classical architecture and urbanism." It also awards the annual Driehaus Architecture Prize.
The university's athletic teams are members of the NCAA Division I and are known collectively as the Fighting Irish. The football team, an Independent, has accumulated eleven consensus national championships, seven Heisman Trophy winners, and 62 members in the College Football Hall of Fame. Other ND teams, chiefly in the Atlantic Coast Conference, have accumulated 16 national championships.

==History==

===Foundations===

In 1842, the Bishop of Vincennes, Célestine Guynemer de la Hailandière, offered land to Father Edward Sorin of the Congregation of the Holy Cross, on the condition that he build a college in two years."Founding Information". University of Notre Dame. Archived from the original on 2007-10-31. Retrieved 2007-12-31. Sorin arrived on the site with eight Holy Cross brothers on November 26, 1842, and began the school using Father Stephen Badin's old log chapel. They immediately acquired two students and set about building additions to the campus.
Notre Dame began as a primary and secondary school, but soon received its official college charter from the Indiana General Assembly on January 15, 1844.a b Hope, C.S.C., Arthur J. (1979) 1948. "IV". Notre Dame: One Hundred Years (2 ed.). Notre Dame, IN: University Press. ISBN 0-89651-501-X. Under the charter the school is officially named the University of Notre Dame du Lac (University of Our Lady of the Lake).The university's campus actually contains two lakes, but according to legend, when Sorin arrived at the site everything was frozen, so he thought there was only one lake and named the university accordingly. Cohen, Ed (Autumn 2004). "One lake or two?". The Notre Dame Magazine. Archived from the original on 2007-07-01. Retrieved 2007-12-07. Because the university was originally only for male students, the female-only Saint Mary's College was founded by the Sisters of the Holy Cross near Notre Dame in 1844."Saint Mary's at a Glance". Saint Mary's College. Retrieved 2007-12-31.

===Early history===

The first degrees from the college were awarded in 1849.Hope, C.S.C., Arthur J. (1979) 1948. "V". Notre Dame: One Hundred Years (2 ed.). Notre Dame, IN: University Press. ISBN 0-89651-501-X. The university was expanded with new buildings to accommodate more students and faculty. With each new president, new academic programs were offered and new buildings built to accommodate them. The original Main Building built by Sorin just after he arrived was replaced by a larger "Main Building" in 1865, which housed the university's administration, classrooms, and dormitories. Beginning in 1873, a library collection was started by Father Lemonnier. By 1879 it had grown to ten thousand volumes that were housed in the Main Building.
This Main Building, and the library collection, was destroyed by a fire in April 1879, and rebuilt before the next school year."The Story of Notre Dame: Main Building". University of Notre Dame Archives. Retrieved 2007-12-31. The library collection was also rebuilt and stayed housed in the new Main Building for years afterwards."The Story of Notre Dame: Lemmonier Library". University of Notre Dame Archives. Retrieved 2007-12-31. Around the time of the fire, a Music Hall was opened. Eventually becoming known as Washington Hall, it hosted plays and musical acts put on by the school."The Story of Notre Dame: Washington Hall". University of Notre Dame Archives. Retrieved 2007-12-31. thumb|390px|left|A view of the University's historic center, the Main Quadrangle, popularly termed the God Quad.

The hall housed multiple classrooms and science labs needed for early research at the university."The Story of Notre Dame: Science Hall". University of Notre Dame Archives. Retrieved 2007-12-31. By 1890, individual residence halls were built to house the increasing number of students."The Story of Notre Dame: Sorin Hall". University of Notre Dame Archives. Retrieved 2007-12-31.
William J. Hoynes (1846–1919) was dean of the law school 1883-1919, and when its new building was opened shortly after his death it was renamed in his honor.a b Marvin R. O'Connell, Edward Sorin (2001)
John Zahm C.S.C. (1851–1921) became the Holy Cross Provincial for the United States (1896–1906), with overall supervision of the university. He tried to transform Notre Dame into a great university, erecting buildings and added to the campus art gallery and library, and amassing what became a famous Dante collection. His term was not renewed because of fears he had expanded Notre Dame too quickly and had run the Holy Cross order into serious debt.
In 1919 Father James Burns became president of Notre Dame, and in three years he produced an academic revolution that brought the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and starting the abandonment of the traditional scholastic and classical emphasis.Thomas T. McAvoy, "Notre Dame 1919–1922: The Burns Revolution," Review of Politics (1963) 25#4 pp: 431-450 in JSTOR.[tpl]cite book|author=Anne Hendershott|title=Status Envy: The Politics of Catholic Higher Education|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AqAfVeHqn0AC&pg=PA205|year=2011|publisher=Transaction Publishers|pages=204-6[/tpl]  By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were reluctant to move to  a system of electives. Their graduates  were shut out of Harvard Law School for that reason.Kathleen A. Mahoney, Catholic higher education in Protestant America: The Jesuits and Harvard in the age of the university (2003).

===Hesburgh Era: 1952–1987===

Theodore Hesburgh, C.S.C., (born 1917) served as president for 35 years (1952–87) of dramatic transformations. In that time the annual operating budget rose by a factor of 18 from $9.7 million to $176.6 million, and the endowment by a factor of 40 from $9 million to $350 million, and research funding by a factor of 20 from $735,000 to $15 million. Enrollment nearly doubled from 4,979 to 9,600, faculty more than doubled 389 to 950, and degrees awarded annually doubled from 1,212 to 2,500.Michael O'Brien, Hesburgh: A Biography (1998); Theodore M. Hesburgh, God, Country, Notre Dame: The Autobiography of Theodore M. Hesburgh (2000)
Hesburgh is also credited with transforming the face of Notre Dame by making it a coeducational institution. In the mid-1960s Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College developed a co-exchange program whereby several hundred students took classes not offered at their home institution, an arrangement that added undergraduate women to a campus that already had a few women in the graduate schools. Nearly a third of accepted Notre Dame students chose not to enroll because of its single-sex status,[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] and a 1968 poll indicated that nearly three-fourths of all Notre Dame students considered transferring to a coeducational school. After extensive debate, merging with St. Mary's was rejected, primarily because of the differential in faculty qualifications and pay scales. "In American college education," explained Rev. Charles E. Sheedy, C.S.C., Notre Dame's Dean of Arts and Letters, "certain features formerly considered advantageous and enviable are now seen as anachronistic and out of place.... In this environment of diversity, the integration of the sexes is a normal and expected aspect, replacing separatism." Thomas Blantz, C.S.C., Notre Dame's Vice President of Student Affairs, added that coeducation "opened up a whole other pool of very bright students."Susan L. Poulson and Loretta P. Higgins, "Gender, Coeducation, and the Transformation of Catholic Identity in American Catholic Higher Education," Catholic Historical Review 2003 89(3): 489-510, for quotes.

===Malloy Era: 1987–2005===

In 18 years under President Edward Malloy, C.S.C., (1987–2005), there was a rapid growth in the school's reputation, faculty, and resources. He increased the faculty by more than 500 professors; the academic quality of the student body has improved dramatically, the average SAT score rose from 1240 to 1360; the number of minority students more than doubled; the endowment grew from $350 million to more than $3 billion; the annual operating budget rose from $177 million to more than $650 million; and annual research funding improved from $15 million to more than $70 million. Notre Dame's most recent capital campaign raised $1.1 billion, far exceeding its goal of $767 million, and is the largest in the history of Catholic higher education.See Biography

==Campus==

Notre Dame's campus is located in Notre Dame, Indiana, an unincorporated community in the Michiana area of Northern Indiana, just north of South Bend and four miles (6 km) from the Michigan state line.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nd.edu/aboutnd/|title=About Notre Dame|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=December 10, 2007[/tpl] Development of the campus began in the spring of 1843, when Father Sorin and some of his congregation built the "Old College," a building used for dormitories, a bakery, and a classroom.
A year later, after an architect arrived, a small "Main Building" was built allowing for the launch of the college.[tpl]cite book|last=Hope, C.S.C.|first=Arthur J.|title=Notre Dame: One Hundred Years|origyear=1948|edition=2|year=1979|publisher=University Press|location=Notre Dame, IN|isbn=0-89651-501-X|chapter=IV[/tpl] Today the campus lies on [tpl]convert|1250|acre|km2[/tpl] just south of the Indiana Toll Road and includes 143 buildings located on quads throughout the campus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsinfo.nd.edu/content.cfm?topicid=43|title=Resources:Campus and Physical Facilities|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=December 10, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071111193111/http://newsinfo.nd.edu/content.cfm?topicid=43 |archivedate=November 11, 2007[/tpl] thumb|left|upright|Historic Washington Hall on the Main Quadrangle, popularly termed the God Quad.
A number of the buildings that Father Sorin built still stand on the campus, while others have been replaced.

Sorin's original church, which became too small for the growing college, and the Main Building, after a fire destroyed parts of it, has become home to Notre Dame's administration. There are two lakes located on campus, and near the lakes is the Grotto to Our Lady of Lourdes, which was built in 1896 as a replica of the original in Lourdes, France.[tpl]cite web|url=https://secure.alumni.nd.edu/site/c.luIZLdMOJpE/b.2660551/#highlights|title=Tour Highlights|publisher=University of Notre Dame Alumni Association|accessdate=December 11, 2007[/tpl]

===Graduate and professional schools===

The university first offered graduate degrees, in the form of a Master of Arts (MA), in the 1854–1855 academic year. The program expanded to include Master of Laws (LL.M.) and Master of Civil Engineering in its early stages of growth, before a formal graduate school education was developed with a thesis not required to receive the degrees. This changed in 1924 with formal requirements developed for graduate degrees, including offering Doctorate (PhD) degrees.[tpl]cite web|author=Moore, Philip S.|url=http://archives.nd.edu/moore/moore06.htm|title=The Story of Notre Dame: Academic Development of Notre Dame: Chapter 6: The Graduate School|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=December 15, 2007[/tpl] Today each of the five colleges offer graduate education. Most of the departments from the College of Arts and Letters offer PhD programs, while a professional Master of Divinity (M.Div.) program also exists. All of the departments in the College of Science offer PhD programs, except for the Department of Pre-Professional Studies. The School of Architecture offers a Master of Architecture, while each of the departments of the College of Engineering offer PhD programs. The College of Business offers multiple professional programs including MBA and Master of Science in Accountancy programs. It also operates facilities in Chicago and Cincinnati for its executive MBA program.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nd.edu/academics/graduate-programs/|title=Graduate and Professional Programs|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=December 15, 2007[/tpl] Additionally, the Alliance for Catholic Education program[tpl]cite web|title=Alliance for Catholic Education|publisher=University of Notre Dame|url=http://ace.nd.edu[/tpl] offers a Master of Education program where students study at the university during the summer and teach in Catholic elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools across the Southern United States for two school years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ace.nd.edu/academic-programs/teacherprogram|title=Teacher Formation Program|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=December 15, 2007[/tpl]
In addition to the programs offered by each of the colleges, the Notre Dame Law School offers a professional program for students. Established in 1869, Notre Dame was the first Catholic university in the United States to have a law program.[tpl]cite web|url=http://law.nd.edu/about/mission-and-history|title=History of Notre Dame Law School|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=December 15, 2007[/tpl] Today the program has consistently ranked among the top law schools in the nation according to US News and World Report. The Law School grants the professional Juris Doctor degree as well as the graduate LL.M. and Doctor of Juridical Science degrees. Currently, the law school is experiencing an expansion that will double the size of its learning space and is expected to be in operation for the Spring 2009 semester. It is the only accredited American law school to offer a full year of study abroad in London.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl]
The Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame is dedicated to research, education and outreach on the causes of violent conflict and the conditions for sustainable peace. It offers PhD, Master's, and undergraduate degrees in peace studies. It was founded in 1986 through the donations of Joan B. Kroc, the widow of McDonald's owner Ray Kroc. The institute was inspired by the vision of Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh CSC, President Emeritus of the University of Notre Dame. The institute has contributed to international policy discussions about peace building practices.History & Mission, Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies

==Research==

===Zahm===

Father Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm (1851–1921) who was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues. His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.Ralph Edward Weber, Notre Dame's John Zahm: American Catholic Apologist and Educator (1961)

===Other science===

In 1882, Albert Zahm (John Zahm's brother) built an early wind tunnel used to compare lift to drag of aeronautical models. Around 1899, Professor Jerome Green became the first American to send a wireless message. In 1931, Father Julius Nieuwland performed early work on basic reactions that was used to create neoprene.[tpl]cite web|url=http://graduateschool.nd.edu/html/research/history.html|title=History of Research at Notre Dame|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=December 13, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071107071047/http://graduateschool.nd.edu/html/research/history.html |archivedate=November 7, 2007[/tpl] Study of nuclear physics at the university began with the building of a nuclear accelerator in 1936,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nd.edu/~nsl/News/history.pdf|title=70 Years of Nuclear Physics at Notre Dame|publisher=University of Notre Dame|format=PDF|accessdate=December 13, 2007[/tpl] and continues now partly through a partnership in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics.

===Lobund Institute===

The Lobund Institute grew out of pioneering research in germ-free-life which began in 1928. This area of research originated in a question posed by Pasteur as to whether animal life was possible without bacteria. Though others had taken up this idea, their research was short lived and inconclusive. Lobund was the first research organization to answer definitively, that such life is possible and that it can be prolonged through generations. But the objective was not merely to answer Pasteur's question but also to produce the germ free animal as a new tool for biological and medical research. This objective was reached and for years Lobund was a unique center for the study and production of germ free animals and for their use in biological and medical investigations. Today the work has spread to other universities. In the beginning it was under the Department of Biology and a program leading to the master's degree accompanied the research program. In the 1940s Lobund achieved independent status as a purely research organization and in 1950 was raised to the status of an Institute. In 1958 it was brought back into the Department of Biology as integral part of that department, but with its own program leading to the degree of PhD in Gnotobiotics.See Philip S. Moore, The Story of Notre Dame: Academic Development: University of Notre Dame online

===English===

Richard T. Sullivan taught English from 1936 to 1974 and published six novels, dozens of short stories, and various other efforts. He was known as a regional writer and a Catholic spokesman.Una M. Cadegan, "How Realistic Can a Catholic Writer Be? Richard Sullivan and American Catholic Literature," Religion & American Culture 1996 6(1): 35–61
Frank O'Malley was an English professor during the 1930s–1960s. Influenced by Jacques Maritain, John U. Nef, and others, O'Malley developed a concept of Christian philosophy that was a fundamental element in his thought. Through his course "Modern Catholic Writers" O'Malley introduced generations of undergraduates to Gabriel Marcel, Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh, Sigrid Undset, Paul Claudel, and Gerard Manley Hopkins.Arnold Sparr, "The Catholic Laity, the Intellectual Apostolate and the Pre-Vatican II Church: Frank O'Malley of Notre Dame." U.S. Catholic Historian 1990 9(3): 305–320. 0735–8318

===European émigrés===

The rise of Hitler and other dictators in the 1930s forced numerous Catholic intellectuals to flee Europe; president John O'Hara brought many to Notre Dame. From Germany came Anton-Hermann Chroust (1907–1982) in classics and law,See bibliography and Waldemar Gurian a German Catholic intellectual of Jewish descent. Positivism dominated American intellectual life in the 1920s onward but in marked contrast, Gurian received a German Catholic education and wrote his doctoral dissertation under Max Scheler.Frank O'Malley, "Waldemar Gurian at Notre Dame," Review of Politics, Vol. 17, No. 1, The Gurian Memorial Issue (Jan., 1955), pp. 19–23 in JSTOR Ivan Meštrović (1883–1962), a renowned sculptor, brought Croatian culture to campus, 1955–62.See Ivan Meštrovic (1883–1962) Yves Simon (1903–61), brought to ND in the 1940s the insights of French studies in the Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition of philosophy; his own teacher Jacques Maritain (1882–73) was a frequent visitor to campus.See Yves R. Simon (1903–61)
The exiles developed a distinctive emphasis on the evils of totalitarianism. For example the political science courses of Gerhart Niemeyer (1907–97) discussed communist ideology and were particularly accessible to his students. He came to ND in 1955, and was a frequent contributor to the National Review and other conservative magazines.William S. Miller, "Gerhart Niemeyer: His Principles of Conservatism," Modern Age 2007 49(3): 273–284 online at EBSCO

===Political science===

The Review of Politics was founded in 1939 by Gurian, modeled after German Catholic journals. It quickly emerged as part of an international Catholic intellectual revival, offering an alternative vision to positivist philosophy. For 44 years, the Review was edited by Gurian, Matthew Fitzsimons, Frederick Crosson, and Thomas Stritch. Intellectual leaders included Gurian, Jacques Maritain, Frank O'Malley, Leo Richard Ward, F. A. Hermens, and John U. Nef. It became a major forum for political ideas and modern political concerns, especially from a Catholic and scholastic tradition.Thomas Stritch, "After Forty Years: Notre Dame and the Review of Politics" Review Of Politics 1978 40: 437–446. in JSTOR

===Residence halls===

About 80% of undergraduates and 20% of graduate students live on campus. The majority of the graduate students on campus live in one of four graduate housing complexes on campus, while all on-campus undergraduates live in one of the 29 residence halls.[tpl]cite web|url=http://orlh.nd.edu/index.htm|title=Office of Residence Life and Housing:Housing Information|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=December 17, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071214232740/http://orlh.nd.edu/index.htm |archivedate=December 14, 2007[/tpl] Because of the religious affiliation of the university, all residence halls are single-sex, with 15 male dorms and 14 female dorms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://orlh.nd.edu/halls/index.htm|title=Notre Dame residence halls|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=December 17, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071203142958/http://orlh.nd.edu/halls/index.htm |archivedate=December 3, 2007[/tpl] The university maintains a visiting policy (known as parietal hours) for those students who live in dormitories, specifying times when members of the opposite sex are allowed to visit other students' dorm rooms; however, all residence halls have 24-hour social spaces for students regardless of gender. Many residence halls have at least one nun and/or priest as a resident. There are no traditional social fraternities or sororities at the university, but a majority of students live in the same residence hall for all four years. Some intramural sports are based on residence hall teams, where the university offers the only non-military academy program of full-contact intramural American football.[tpl]cite web|url=http://admissions.nd.edu/life-at-notre-dame/student-life-faq|title=Student Life FAQ|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=December 17, 2007[/tpl] At the end of the intramural season, the championship game is played on the field in Notre Dame Stadium.

===Religious life===

The university is affiliated with the Congregation of the Holy Cross. More than 93% of students identify as Christian, with over 80% of the total being Catholic.[tpl]cite news|author=Peralta, Katie|url=http://media.www.ndsmcobserver.com/media/storage/paper660/news/2007/10/04/News/Nd.Welcomes.NonCatholic.Faiths-3011803.shtml|title=ND welcomes non-Catholic faiths|work=The Observer|date=October 4, 2007|accessdate=December 17, 2007[/tpl] The Basilica of the Sacred Heart is on campus and each residence hall has a chapel. Collectively, Catholic Mass is celebrated over 100 times per week on campus. There are multitudes of religious statues and artwork around campus, most prominent of which are the statue of Mary on the Main Building, the Notre Dame Grotto, and the Word of Life mural on Hesburgh Library depicting Christ as a teacher. Additionally, every classroom displays a crucifix. There are many religious clubs at the school, including Council #1477 of the Knights of Columbus (KOC), Baptist Collegiate Ministry (BCM), Jewish Club, Muslim Student Association, Orthodox Christian Fellowship, The Mormon Club, and many more. The Notre Dame KofC are known for being the first collegiate council of KofC, operating a charitable concession stand during every home football game and owning their own building on campus which can be used as a cigar lounge.[tpl]cite news|author=Cheffers, Elizabeth|url=http://media.www.ndsmcobserver.com/media/storage/paper660/news/2004/09/24/News/Knights.Serve.The.Community-730486.shtml|title=Knights serve the community|work=The Observer|date=September 24, 2004|accessdate=December 17, 2007[/tpl]
The University was founded by a group of Catholic missionary priests and brothers from France, members of the Congregation of the Holy Cross (in Latin, Congregatio a Sancta Cruce; more commonly referred to as "CSC," which is also the initials placed after all members' names). The land where they founded the school was donated to them by the Bishop of Vincennes, Indiana. They saw a large part of their early mission to be caring for and evangelizing the local Potawatomi tribes. Upon arrival on the lake shore in the cold of winter, they dedicated their new school and all their endeavors to the Virgin Mary under the name of Notre Dame du Lac, which is French for Our Lady of the Lake.
This Catholic mission of the Congregation, its schools at the site, and their successors has shaped the campus and the university. Fifty-seven chapels are located throughout the campus.
While religious affiliation is not a criterion for admission, approximately 80% of undergraduates enrolled self-identify as Catholic. There are many Catholic clubs, organizations, and ministries on campus. There is a large campus ministry program and many volunteer opportunities. There is no compulsory participation in any religious liturgies. Students and clubs of other religions and Christian denominations are welcomed and supported.
Nearly every residence hall has a priest in residence. Every residence hall (and many academic buildings) contains a chapel, where Sunday and daily masses are celebrated during the school year. One dorm is named after a saint (Saint Edward). Sunday and daily masses as well as daily confessions are held in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart in the center of campus.
Architecturally, the school has a Catholic character. Atop the Main Building's gold dome is a golden statue of the Virgin Mary. Immediately in front of the Main Building and facing it, is a copper statue of Christ with arms upraised with the legend "Venite Ad Me Omnes" ("Come to me, all you"; Matthew 11:28a). Next to the Main Building is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Immediately behind the basilica is the Grotto, a Marian place of prayer and reflection. It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France where Mary is reputed to have appeared to St. Bernadette in 1858. At the end of the main drive (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome), is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary. Behind her approximately [tpl]convert|1000|ft|m[/tpl] is a statue of the founder of the school, Edward Sorin. thumb|upright|The interior of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart.The 14-story Hesburgh Library sports a [tpl]convert|134|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall[/tpl] stone mosaic on its southern face of Christ surrounded by the Apostles and notable scholarly saints and doctors of the Church. This mosaic is entitled "The Word of Life," but is affectionately referred to as 'Touchdown Jesus' because of Christ's upraised arms and the visibility of the mosaic from the stadium through the uprights of the northern endzone. Next to the library is Ivan Meštrović's large bronze statue of Moses with finger upraised (affectionately known as 'Firstdown Moses').
The university is the major seat of the Congregation of the Holy Cross (albeit not its official headquarters, which are in Rome). Its main seminary, Moreau Seminary, is located on the campus across St. Joseph lake from the Main Building. Old College, the oldest building on campus and located near the shore of St. Mary lake, houses undergraduate seminarians. Retired priests and brothers reside in Fatima House (a former retreat center), Holy Cross House, as well as Columba Hall near the Grotto. Until the 1970s, many of the support staff were nuns and monks.
The university supports many Church-related organizations and ministries.
The university has a highly regarded theology program, both undergraduate and graduate, with many scholars, including Lawrence Cunningham, John Cavadini, and Gary Anderson. The chair of the department, John Cavadini, was appointed to the International Theological Commission by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010; Prof. Brian Daley, SJ, received the Ratzinger Prize in Theology in 2012.
University by-laws require that the President of the University be a priest of the United States Province of the Congregation of Holy Cross. Until 1967, when governance was transferred to a lay board of trustees, the university was entirely governed by the leadership of the Holy Cross order.
Although the faculty was well over 85% Catholic before 1970, search practices have broadened. In recent years about half the new faculty hires have been Catholics, and Catholics now comprise 52% of the faculty.At the top 50 research universities in the U.S. about 6% of the faculty are Catholics. John T. Mcgreevy, "Catholic Enough? Religious Identity at Notre Dame," Commonweal, Vol. 134, September 28, 2007
However, in a policy statement the University declares that "the Catholic identity of the University depends upon ... the continuing presence of a predominant number of Catholic intellectuals" on the faculty. As the provost has explained, the aim is "to have a majority of faculty who are Catholic, who understand the nature of the religion, who can be living role models, who can talk with students about issues outside the classroom and can infuse values into what they do."William H. Dempsey, "How Catholic Is Notre Dame?" First Things: A Monthly Journal of Religion and Public Life, No. 183, May 2008.
In 2009 the University was criticized by many Catholic bishops for conferring an honorary degree on President Barack Obama. President Obama's promotion of abortion access and types of embryonic stem cell research that result in the destruction of human embryos conflicts with Catholic doctrine on the sanctity of life.[tpl]cite web|url=http://old.usccb.org/prolife/issues/bioethic/bishopsESCRstmt.pdf|title=On Embryonic Stem Cell Research|year=2008|accessdate=10 July 2012|publisher=USCCB|format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_academies/acdlife/documents/rc_pa_acdlife_doc_20000824_cellule-staminali_en.html|title=DECLARATION ON THE PRODUCTION AND THE SCIENTIFIC AND THERAPEUTIC USE OF HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS|author=Prof. Juan de Dios Vial Correa|date=25 August 2000|accessdate=10 July 2012|publisher=Pontifical Academy for Life[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.chicagobreakingnews.com/2009-03-24/news/28523831_1_premier-catholic-universities-direct-destruction-debate-and-healthy-disagreementx|title=Obama's Notre Dame speech draws protest|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=10 July 2012|date=24 March 2009|first=John|last=McCormick[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.voting4life.org/Pages/007_Notre_Dame.htm|title=Pictures of Notre Dame Protest|publisher=Voting4Life|accessdate=May 17, 2009[/tpl]

===Student-run media===

As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsinfo.nd.edu/content.cfm?topicid=158|title=Publications: Overview|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=December 17, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071215163550/http://newsinfo.nd.edu/content.cfm?topicid=158 |archivedate=December 15, 2007[/tpl] The Observer is staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College, the women's college located nearby. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students.[tpl]cite web|author=Cohen, Ed|year=2005|title=The Student Media Frenzy|work=Notre Dame Magazine|url=http://www.nd.edu/~ndmag/sp2005/media.html|accessdate=December 17, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071015122510/http://nd.edu/~ndmag/sp2005/media.html |archivedate=October 15, 2007[/tpl]

George Gipp was the school's legendary football player during 1916–20. He played semiprofessional baseball and smoked, drank, and gambled when not playing sports. He was also humble, generous to the needy, and a man of integrity.John U. Bacon, "The Gipper," Michigan History 2001 85(6): 48–55, It was in 1928 that famed coach Knute Rockne used his final conversation with the dying Gipp to inspire the Notre Dame team to beat the Army team and "win one for the Gipper." The 1940 film, Knute Rockne, All American, starred Pat O'Brien as Knute Rockne and Ronald Reagan as Gipp.

====Football gameday traditions====

During home games, activities occur all around campus and different dorms decorate their halls with a traditional item (e.g. Zahm House's two-story banner). Traditional activities begin at the stroke of midnight with the Drummers' Circle. This tradition involves the drum line of the Band of the Fighting Irish and ushers in the rest of the festivities that will continue the rest of the gameday Saturday. Later that day, the trumpet section will play the Notre Dame Victory March and the Notre Dame Alma Mater under the dome. The band entire will play a concert at the steps of Bond Hall, from where they will march into Notre Dame Stadium, leading fans and students alike across campus to the game.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gameday.nd.edu/experience/notre-dame-spirit/band-of-the-fighting-irish/|title=Band of the Fighting Irish|publisher=University of Notre Dame|accessdate=October 3, 2012[/tpl]

==Music==

The Band of the Fighting Irish is the oldest university band in continuous existence.University of Notre Dame It was formed in 1846. The all-male Glee Club was formed in 1915.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gleeclub.nd.edu/index_about.htm|title=UND Glee Club » About » About / History|publisher=Gleeclub.nd.edu|accessdate=2012-06-04[/tpl]
The "Notre Dame Victory March" is the fight song for the University of Notre Dame. It was written by two brothers who were Notre Dame graduates. The Rev. Michael J. Shea, a 1904 graduate, wrote the music, and his brother, John F. Shea, who earned degrees in 1906 and 1908, wrote the original lyrics. The lyrics were revised in the 1920s; it first appeared under the copyright of the University of Notre Dame in 1928. The chorus is, "Cheer cheer for old Notre Dame, wake up the echos cheering her name. Send a volley cheer on high, shake down the thunder from the sky! What though the odds be great or small, old Notre Dame will win over all. While her loyal sons are marching, onward to victory!"
The chorus of the song is one of the most recognizable collegiate fight songs in the United States, and was ranked first among fight songs by Northern Illinois University Professor William Studwell, who remarked it was "more borrowed, more famous and, frankly, you just hear it more."
In the film Knute Rockne, All American, Knute Rockne (played by Pat O'Brien) delivers the famous "Win one for the Gipper" speech, at which point the background music swells with the Notre Dame Victory March. George Gipp was played by Ronald Reagan, whose nickname "The Gipper" was derived from this role. This scene was parodied in the movie Airplane! with the same background music, only this time honoring George Zipp, one of Ted Striker's former comrades. The song also was prominent in the movie Rudy, with Sean Astin as Daniel "Rudy" Ruettiger, who harbored dreams of playing football at the University of Notre Dame despite significant obstacles.
