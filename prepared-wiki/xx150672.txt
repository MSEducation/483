[[Cryptobotany]]

CATEGORIES: Cryptozoology, Pseudoscience

Cryptobotany is the study of various exotic plants which are not believed to exist by the scientific community, but which exist in myth, literature or unsubstantiated reports.
Folk legend and ethnic usage of plants, often as interdisciplinary research, is presented and developed for an unknown species, in the hope of allowing those species to be collected or adequately identified. Any researcher or writer can identify himself or herself as a cryptobotanist; the field is surveyed within cryptozoological or other journals, or with varying degrees of skepticism as a protoscience.[tpl]cite web | url = http://web.ncf.ca/bz050/criticalcz.html | title = Taking a Hard Look at Cryptozoology: A Critical Approach to Cryptozoology | accessdate = 2007-07-03 | author = Roesch, Ben S. | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | date =  | year = 1999 | work =  Author's On-Line Cryptozoology Archives| publisher =   | quote = Thus the argument goes: in order to ensure accuracy in cryptozoology, research on sasquatch should be done by a primatologist or physical anthropologist, and research on sea serpents should be done by a marine biologist, preferably one who has good knowledge of both invertebrate and vertebrate marine organisms.

Many plants remain undiscovered or are yet to be classified, however cryptobotany usually focuses on fantastical plants believed to have harmful or therapeutic interactions with people. Sources of data may be secondary or scant; reports may be plausible or outlandish.

However, there are unconfirmed reports, primarily from Latin America, that allege the existence of still-undiscovered species of large carnivorous plants, according to British cryptozoologist Karl Shuker's 2003 book The Beasts That Hide From Man.
