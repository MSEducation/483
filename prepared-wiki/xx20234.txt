The Sierra Nevada ([tpl]IPAc-en|s|i|ˈ|ɛ|r|ə|_|n|ɨ|ˈ|v|ɑː|d|ə|[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|n|ɨ|ˈ|v|æ|d|ə|[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-es|ˈsjera neˈβaða|lang[/tpl], snowy range[tpl]cite book|author=Carlson, Helen S.|title=Nevada Place Names: A Geographical Dictionary|publisher=University of Nevada Press|year=1976|page=215|isbn=978-0-87417-094-8[/tpl]) is a mountain range in the western United States, between the Central Valley of California and the Basin and Range Province. The vast majority of the range lies in the state of California, although the Carson Range spur lies primarily in Nevada. 
The Sierra runs [tpl]convert|400|mi|km[/tpl] north-to-south, and is approximately [tpl]convert|70|mi|km[/tpl] across east-to-west.  Notable Sierra features include Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America; Mount Whitney at [tpl]convert|14505|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl], the highest point in the contiguous United States; and Yosemite Valley sculpted by glaciers out of 100-million-year-old granite. The Sierra is home to three national parks, 20 wilderness areas, and two national monuments. These areas include Yosemite, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon National Parks; and Devils Postpile National Monument.
The character of the range is shaped by its geology and ecology. More than 100 million years ago during the Nevadan orogeny, granite formed deep underground. The range started to uplift 4 Ma (million years) ago, and erosion by glaciers exposed the granite and formed the light-colored mountains and cliffs that make up the range. The uplift caused a wide range of elevations and climates in the Sierra Nevada, which are reflected by the presence of five life zones. Uplift continues due to faulting caused by tectonic forces, creating spectacular fault block escarpments along the eastern edge of the southern Sierra.
The Sierra Nevada has a significant history. The California Gold Rush occurred in the western foothills from 1848 through 1855. Due to inaccessibility, the range was not fully explored until 1912.[tpl]rp|81[/tpl]

==Geography==

The Sierra Nevada stretches from the Susan River[tpl]cite web |title=Subsection M261Eb: Fredonyer Butte – Grizzly Peak |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/projects/ecoregions/m261eb.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101205212103/http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/projects/ecoregions/m261eb.htm |archivedate=2010-12-05 |accessdate=2010-08-02[/tpl] and Fredonyer Pass[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.peakbagger.com/range.aspx?rid=126|work=Peakbagger.com|title=Sierra Nevada|accessdate=2010-08-07[/tpl] in the north to Tehachapi Pass in the south.  It is bounded on the west by California's Central Valley and on the east by the Basin and Range Province. Physiographically, the Sierra is a section of the Cascade-Sierra Mountains province, which in turn is part of the larger Pacific Mountain System physiographic division.
West-to-east, the Sierra Nevada's elevation increases gradually from the Central Valley to the crest, while the east slope forms the steep Sierra Escarpment.  The range is drained on its north-west slopes by the Sacramento River and to the west-southwest by the San Joaquin River, two major Central Valley watercourses that ultimately discharge to the Pacific Ocean. Smaller rivers of the west slope include the Feather, Yuba, American, Mokelumne, Stanislaus and Tuolumne. The southern part of the mountains are drained by four rivers called the Kings, Kaweah, Tule, and Kern. These rivers flow into an endorheic basin called Tulare Lake, but historically joined the San Joaquin during wet years.
To the east, the melting snow of the mountains forms many small rivers that flow out into the Great Basin of Nevada and eastern California. From north to south, the Susan River flows into intermittent Honey Lake; the Truckee River flows from massive Lake Tahoe into Pyramid Lake; the Carson River runs into Carson Sink; the Walker River into Walker Lake; Rush, Lee Vining and Mill Creeks into Mono Lake; and the Owens River into the dry Owens Lake. None of the east-side rivers reach the sea; however, many of the streams from Mono Lake southwards are diverted into the Los Angeles Aqueduct and their water shipped to Southern California.
The height of the mountains in the Sierra Nevada increases gradually from north to south. Between Fredonyer Pass and Lake Tahoe, the peaks range from [tpl]convert|5000|ft|m[/tpl] to more than [tpl]convert|9000|ft|m[/tpl]. The crest near Lake Tahoe is roughly [tpl]convert|9000|ft|m[/tpl] high, with several peaks approaching the height of Freel Peak ([tpl]convert|10881|ft|m|disp=or|abbr=on[/tpl]). Further south, the highest peak in Yosemite National Park is Mount Lyell ([tpl]convert|13120|ft|m|0|disp=or|abbr=on[/tpl]). The Sierra rise to almost [tpl]convert|14000|ft|m[/tpl] with Mount Humphreys near Bishop, California. Finally, near Lone Pine, Mount Whitney is at [tpl]convert|14505|ft|m[/tpl], the highest point in the contiguous United States.
South of Mount Whitney, the range quickly dwindles. The crest elevation is almost [tpl]convert|10000|ft|m[/tpl] near Lake Isabella, but south of the lake, the peaks reach only to a modest [tpl]convert|8000|ft|m[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |title=Google terrain map |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=35.671581,-118.427236&spn=0.1,0.1&t=p&q=35.671581,-118.427236 |accessdate=2010-05-29[/tpl]

===Notable features===

There are several notable geographical features in the Sierra Nevada:

===Communities===

Cities in the Sierra Nevada range include Carson City, Paradise, South Lake Tahoe, Truckee, Grass Valley, Mammoth Lakes, Sonora, Nevada City, Portola, and Colfax.

===Protected areas===

Much of the Sierra Nevada is owned by the U.S. Federal government and is either protected from development or is strictly managed. The three National Parks (Yosemite, Kings Canyon, Sequoia), two National Monument (Devils Postpile, Giant Sequoia), and 20 wilderness areas lie within the Sierra. These areas protect 15.4% of the Sierra's [tpl]convert|63118|km2|mi2|abbr=on[/tpl] from logging and grazing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.biogeog.ucsb.edu/projects/gap/report/sn_rep.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yfLHKOZu|archivedate=2011-05-14|title=The Sierra Nevada Region|work=USCB Biogeography lab[/tpl]
The United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management currently control 52% of the land in the Sierra Nevada. Logging and grazing is generally allowed on land controlled by these agencies, under federal regulations that balance recreation and development on the land.
The California Bighorn Sheep Zoological Area near Mount Williamson in the southern Sierra was established to protect the endangered Sierra Nevada Bighorn Sheep. Starting in 1981, hikers were unable to enter the Area from May 15 through December 15, in order to protect the sheep.  As of 2010, the restriction has been lifted and access to the Area is open for the whole year.[tpl]cite web|title = Forest Service Proposes to Change Designation of Bighorn Sheep Zoological Areas|publisher = United States Forest Service|date = September 25, 2010|url = http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gjAwhwtDDw9_AI8zPyhQoY6BdkOyoCAGixyPg!/?ss=110504&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=STELPRDB5201581&navid=180000000000000&pnavid=null&position=News&ttype=detail&pname=Inyo%20National%20Forest-%20News%20&%20Events[/tpl]

==Geologic history==

The earliest granite of the Sierra started to form in the Triassic period. This granite is mostly found east of the crest and north of 37.2°N.[tpl]cite web|title=Mesozoic Plutonism in the Sierra Nevada Batholith|url=http://www.colorado.edu/GeolSci/Resources/WUSTectonics/SierraBatholith/mesozoic.htm#pt3|first=Tanya S.|last=Unger[/tpl] In the Triassic and into the Jurassic, an island arc collided with the west coast of North America and raised a set of mountains, in an event called the Nevadan orogeny.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gorp.com/parks-guide/travel-ta-yosemite-hiking-california-sidwcmdev_056847.html|last=Shaffer|first=Jeffrey|title=Evolution of the Yosemite Landscape — The Nevadan Orogeny|work=One Hundred Hikes in Yosemite[/tpl]
In the Cretaceous, a subduction zone formed at the edge of the continent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~rcb7/Text_WUS.html|title=Geologic History of Western US|first=Ron|last=Blakely[/tpl] This means that an oceanic plate started to dive beneath the North American plate. Magma formed through the subduction of the ancient Farallon Plate rose in plumes (plutons) deep underground, their combined mass forming what is called the Sierra Nevada batholith. These plutons formed at various times, from 115 Ma to 87 Ma. The earlier plutons formed in the western half of the Sierra, while the later plutons formed in the eastern half of the Sierra. By 66 Ma, the proto-Sierra Nevada had been worn down to a range of rolling low mountains, a few thousand feet high.
Twenty million years ago, crustal extension associated with the Basin and Range Province caused extensive volcanism in the Sierra.[tpl]cite web|title=Basin and Range (Transierra) Region Physical Geography|url=http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~joel/g148_f09/readings/basin_range/basin_range.html|author=Joel Michaelsen|accessdate=2010-05-07[/tpl] About 10 Ma, the Sierra Nevada started to form: a block of crust between the Coast Range and the Basin and Range Province started to tilt to the west.[tpl]cite web|title=Miocene-Pliocene uplit rates of the Sierra Nevada, California|url=https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2009AM/finalprogram/abstract_165552.htm|work=2009 Portland GSA meeting|date=2009-10-18|first=A.s.|last=Jayko[/tpl]  Rivers started cutting deep canyons on both sides of the range. Lava filled some of these canyons, which have subsequently eroded leaving table mountains that follow the old river channels.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/10/inverted-martian-topography |first=Brian |last=Romans |title=Inverted Martian Topography |date=October 2010 |publisher=Wired Science[/tpl]
About 2.5 Ma, the Earth's climate cooled, and ice ages started. Glaciers carved out characteristic U-shaped canyons throughout the Sierra. The combination of river and glacier erosion exposed the uppermost portions of the plutons emplaced millions of years before, leaving only a remnant of metamorphic rock on top of some Sierra peaks.
Uplift of the Sierra Nevada continues today, especially along its eastern side. This uplift causes large earthquakes, such as the Lone Pine earthquake of 1872.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sierranevadavirtualmuseum.com/docs/galleries/nathist/geology/lonepine.htm|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yfL7CmC4|archivedate=2011-05-14|title=1872 Lone Pine Earthquake|work=Sierra Nevada Virtual Museum|accessdate=2010-05-31|quote=Few people ever see a mountain range grow, but on March 26, 1872, the 300 residents of Lone Pine, California, did.[/tpl]

==Climate and meteorology==

The climate of the Sierra Nevada is influenced by the Mediterranean climate of California.  During the fall, winter and spring, precipitation in the Sierra ranges from [tpl]convert|20|to|80|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] where it occurs mostly as snow above [tpl]convert|6000|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. Precipitation is highest on the central and northern portions of the western slope around [tpl]convert|8000|ft|m[/tpl] elevation.[tpl]rp|69[/tpl] Most parts of the range east of the crest are in a rain shadow, and receive less than 25 inches of precipitation per year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sierranevadaphotos.com/geography/sierra_precipitation.asp|title=Average Annual Precipitation|publisher=Sierra Nevada Photos|accessdate=2014-01-02[/tpl] Summers are dry with low humidity; however, afternoon thunderstorms are common, particularly during the North American Monsoon. Summer high temperatures average [tpl]convert|42|-|90|F|C[/tpl]. The growing season lasts 20 to 230 days, strongly dependent on elevation. The highest elevations of the Sierra have an alpine climate.
The Sierra Nevada snowpack is the major source of water and a significant source of electric power generation in California.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sierranevada.ca.gov/docs/Water09.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5qzIbKsdi|archivedate=2010-07-05|title=Water—Most of California’s Water Comes from the Sierra Nevada|publisher=Sierra Nevada Conservancy|accessdate=2010-06-09[/tpl]  Many reservoirs were constructed in the canyons of the Sierra throughout the 20th century,  Several major aqueducts serving both agriculture and urban areas distribute Sierra water throughout the state. However, the Sierra casts a rain shadow, which greatly affects the climate and ecology of the central Great Basin. This rain shadow is largely responsible for Nevada being the driest state in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/usclimate/pcp.state.19712000.climo|title=Climatology by state based on climate division data: 1971–2000|publisher=NOAA Earth Systems Research Laboratory[/tpl]
The height of the range and the steepness of the Sierra Escarpment, particularly at the southern end of the range produces a wind phenomenon known as the "Sierra Rotor".  This is a horizontal rotation of the atmosphere just east of the crest of the Sierras, set in motion as an effect of strong westerly winds.[tpl]cite conference|url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/114663.pdf|publisher=American Meteorological Society|booktitle=12th Conference on Mountain Meteorology|title=Sierra Rotors: A Comparative Study of Three Mountain Wave and Rotor Events|first=Vanda|last=Grubišic|coauthors=Brian J. Billings|date=2006[/tpl]

==Ecology==

The Sierra Nevada is divided into a number of biotic zones, each of which is defined by its climate and supports a number of interdependent species.[tpl]cite book|last=Schoenherr|first=Allan A.|title=A Natural History of California|year=1995|publisher=UC Press|isbn=0-520-06922-6 [/tpl] Life in the higher elevation zones adapted to colder weather, and to most of the precipitation falling as snow. The rain shadow of the Sierra causes the eastern slope to be warmer and drier: each life zone is higher in the east. A list of biotic zones, and corresponding elevations, is presented below:

==History==

===Native Americans===

Archaeological excavations placed Martis people of Paleo-Indians in northcentral Sierra Nevada during the period of 3,000 BCE to 500 CE. The earliest identified sustaining indigenous people in the Sierra Nevada were the Northern Paiute tribes of Native American on the east side, with the Mono tribe and Sierra Miwok tribe on the western side, and the Kawaiisu tribe in the southern Sierra. Today, some mountain passes, such as Duck Pass with obsidian arrowheads, are artifact locations from historic intertribal trade route trails. The California and Sierra Native American tribes were predominantly peaceful, with occasional territorial disputes between the Paiute and Sierra Miwok tribes in the mountains.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=Charles F.|year=1868|title=Notes on Hetch-Hetchy Valley|journal=Proceedings of the California Academy of Science|volume=1 |issue=3:5|pages=368–370|url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/notes_on_hetch-hetchy_valley.html |accessdate=2006-09-27[/tpl]  Washo and Maidu were also in this area prior to the era of European exploration and displacement.[tpl]cite web |archiveurl=http://replay.web.archive.org/20080516220327/http://www.sierrarockart.org/makers.html|url=http://www.sierrarockart.org/makers.html|archivedate=2008-05-16|title=Ancient petroglyph makers of the Northern Sierra |last=Drake |first=Bill |year=2000 |work= |publisher=sierrarockart.org[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cityofgrassvalley.com/services/departments/cdd/IdMd/FinalMEAJune2006/405_CulturalRes.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5qzIbKsfp |archivedate=2010-07-05|title=Prehistoric Context |page=2 |accessdate=2008-08-15 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date=June 2006 |work=Idaho-Maryland Mine Project, Master Environmental Assessment |publisher=cityofgrassvalley.com[/tpl]
