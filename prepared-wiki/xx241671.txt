NY Squash (formerly the Metropolitan Racquets Association, or MSRA) is a volunteer organization which organizes squash events in the New York metropolitan area.

==History==

NY Squash was founded in 1924 and incorporated in 1932 as the Metropolitan Squash Racquets Association (MSRA). The organization’s membership base covers players in the five boroughs of New York City, Long Island, Westchester County, southern New York State, and Fairfield County in Connecticut. NY Squash supports the many variants of squash racquets but the majority of its efforts are focused on the game of individual squash singles and hardball doubles.  NY Squash is one of 36 district squash associations under US Squash, the United States governing body for the sport.  NY Squash’s mission is to further the development, progress, and establishment of the game of squash in the New York metropolitan area.  To do this, the association organizes tournaments, leagues, and other squash events, and provides information of interest to New York-area squash players. The organization was renamed NY Squash in 2011.

==Organization & Membership==

NY Squash is run by a volunteering Board of Directors and is aided by a paid Executive Director. The board meets regularly throughout the year to plan and organize events.  At close to 4,000 current and lapsed members, NY Squash is the largest district squash association in the country and the only one with a paid employee.  NY Squash's board works in tandem with the squash teaching professionals at clubs within its membership area to run events, and aids the pros in promoting or running their own events.http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/11/nyregion/thecity/11fyi.html MSRA referenced in NY York Times, Jan 9, 2009  NY Squash's membership is approximately 75% male and 25% female.

==NY Squash Tournaments==

During the course of the typical squash season (September through May) the organization holds squash tournaments, team and individual leagues, instructive and training clinics, exhibitions and social events.
The Season Opener - The Season Opener is a one-day squash tournament held in September/October and is designed to start the Winter Squash Season. The format is based on round-robin play (as opposed to an elimination bracket format) in order and uses a best of 3 rather than a best of 5 game system used for more formal squash tournaments.
The Grand Open – The Grand Open tournament began in 1994 and is an amateur tournament generally held in January with matches at a variety of Manhattan-area squash clubs. The tournament is held over three days (Friday to Sunday) and involves several men’s and women’s skill level divisions using a double elimination bracket format.  The Grand Open is held the same weekend as the Tournament of Champions, a week-long professional squash tournament that features some of the world’s top professional players.http://www.squashfan.com/TOC_2009/index.php Photo slideshow of the 2009 Tournament of Champions Player participation in the Grand Open has shown positive growth, with the tournament setting a record level of participation for the fourth year with 244 players across 13 skill levels.
The Hyder Trophy Tournament – Founded in 1969 at the New York Athletic Club by Dr. Quentin Hyder, the Hyder Trophy is longest continually-running softball squash tournament in North America.  It is held in May of every year and caps the end of the competitive squash season.  Similar to the Grand Open, the Hyder is held over three days and involves co-ed and women’s divisions playing in double elimination.  The Hyder Trophy incorporates co-ed draws for both men and women and also a men’s professional draw that offered a total purse of $9,500 in 2011.  Like the Grand Open, it is hosted a number of Manhattan squash clubs, including the Sports Club/LA, the Harvard Club of New York, the Princeton Club of New York and the Yale Club of New York.  The 2010 edition attracted a record number of amateur and professional players (224) and had a men’s pro draw highlighted by a win by then world #5 player, David Palmer.http://www.squashtalk.com/html2/news09/may/news09-5-286.htm David Palmer wins 41st annual Hyder Trophy.
