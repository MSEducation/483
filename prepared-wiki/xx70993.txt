[[Filicide]]

CATEGORIES: Filicides, Homicide, Murderâ€“suicides

Filicide is the deliberate act of a parent killing his or her own son or daughter. The word filicide derives from the Latin words filius meaning "son" or filia meaning daughter and the suffix -cide meaning to kill, murder, or cause death. "A filicide" may refer to the parent who killed his or her child as well as to the criminal act that the parent committed.

==History==

A 1999 U.S. Department of Justice study concluded that between 1976 and 1997 in the United States, mothers were responsible for a higher share of children killed during infancy, while fathers were more likely to have been responsible for the murders of children age 8 or older.[tpl]cite web |url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/wo.pdf |title=Women Offenders |accessdate= 2011-07-08 |author=Greenfeld, Lawrence A., Snell, Tracy L. |date=1999-02-12, updated 2000-03-10 |work=NCJ 175688 |publisher=US Department of Justice |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100603113816/http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/wo.pdf |archivedate= 2010-06-03 [/tpl] Furthermore, 52% of the children killed by their mothers (maternal filicide) were male, while 57% of the children killed by their fathers (paternal filicide) were male.  Parents were responsible for 61% of child murders under the age of five.Friedman, S., H., M.D., Horwitz, S., M., Ph.D., and Resnick, P., J., M.D.. (2005).

Sometimes, there is a combination of murder and suicide in filicide cases.
