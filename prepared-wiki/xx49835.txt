[[Mons pubis]]

CATEGORIES: Pelvis

In human anatomy, and in mammals in general, the mons pubis (Latin for "pubic mound"), also known simply as the mons, and known specifically in females as the mons Venus or mons veneris (Latin for "mound of Venus"), is a rounded mass of fatty tissue situated over the pubic bone.[tpl]cite book|title=New Oxford American Dictionary|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=mons pubis|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mons%20pubis|publisher=Merriamâ€“Webster|accessdate=2013-09-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=mons pubis|url=http://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=mons+pubis&submit.x=0&submit.y=0|publisher=American Heritage Dictionary|accessdate=2013-09-19|year=2011[/tpl] Its location is specifically anterior to the pubic symphysis. The size of the mons pubis varies with the level of hormone and body fat, and it is more apparent in females. After puberty, it generally becomes covered with pubic hair and enlarged.
In human females, the mons pubis forms the anterior portion of the vulva. It divides into the labia majora (literally "larger lips") on either side of the furrow, known as the pudendal cleft, that surrounds the labia minora, clitoris, urethra, vaginal opening, and other structures of the vulval vestibule. The fatty tissue of the mons pubis is sensitive to estrogen, causing a distinct mound to form with the onset of puberty. This pushes the forward portion of the labia majora out and away from the pubic bone.
