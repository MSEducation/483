Pilić was the catalyst to the 1973 Wimbledon Boycott.

Pilić denied the charge, but was suspended by the federation, and the suspension was upheld by the ILTF, albeit decreased from nine months to one month, meaning that he could not enter the Wimbledon Championships. In protest at the suspension, 81 of Pilić's fellow professionals, organized in the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), and including 13 of the 16 seeds, withdrew from the 1973 Wimbledon championship.[tpl]cite book|title=World of Tennis '74|year=1974|publisher=Queen Anne|location=London|isbn=978-0362001686|pages=15–17, 45–47|editor=John Barrett[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The History of the Championships|url=http://aeltc2011.wimbledon.com/125th-championships/history/index.html|publisher=AELTC|accessdate=23 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Dark Fortnight For Wimbledon...|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1087513/index.htm|publisher=SI|accessdate=23 July 2012|date=2 July 1973[/tpl]
