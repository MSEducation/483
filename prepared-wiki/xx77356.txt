[[The Devils (band)]]

The Devils is the name of an English electronic pop band, formed by Nick Rhodes and Stephen Duffy.
The first incarnation of Duran Duran in 1978 included Rhodes as keyboardist, John Taylor on guitar and Duffy as songwriter/vocalist and bassist (along with Simon Colley). This lineup performed live for almost a year before Duffy and Colley left the band. 
Duffy moved on to a solo career and The Lilac Time, and Duran Duran eventually went on to fame with drummer Roger Taylor, guitarist Andy Taylor and singer Simon Le Bon.
In 1999, Duffy came across an old tape recording of a live Duran Duran concert from a 1979 show. Shortly afterwards, Rhodes and Duffy met by chance at a fashion show, and began talking about the old music. They decided it might be fun to re-record some of those original, dark, art-school, pre-Le Bon Duran Duran songs.
A few months later they took to the studio, using vintage analog instruments but modern production techniques to recreate the early Duran Duran sound. The lyrics remained unchanged.[tpl]Cite web|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/wild-boys-plundering-the-new-romantic-back-catalogue-749474.html |title= Wild Boys: Plundering the New Romantic back catalogue | date = 30 June 2002 |accessdate=25 October 2010 |author=Pete Paphides |authorlink= The Independent |publisher=The Independent [/tpl]

The band played live only two times, in London (19 November 2002), and Cologne (17 February 2003), before both members returned to their normal careers.
In early June 2008, Rhodes and Duffy were interviewed by the music journalist Pete Paphides for BBC Radio 4, and relived the whole Dark Circles experience. Duffy also publicly stated through his website that a Devils DVD could be released later.[tpl]Cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/musicfeature/pip/km539/ |title= Lost Albums: The Devils - Dark Circles | date = 3 June 2008 |accessdate=25 October 2010 |author=Pete Paphides |authorlink= Moby |publisher=BBC Radio 4 [/tpl]
