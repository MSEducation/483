Information ([tpl]IPA-da|enfɒmæˈɕoːˀn[/tpl]), full name: Dagbladet Information ([tpl]IPA-da|ˈdɑʊ̯ˌblæˀð enfɒmæˈɕoːˀn|[/tpl]), is a Danish newspaper published Monday through Saturday.
Originally established and edited by Børge Outze and published during World War II by the Danish resistance movement. Information was illegal during the war as it was not regulated by the German occupying power. As of May 5, 1945 (Day of German retreat), Dagbladet Information was a reality and the newspaper itself was officially founded in August 1945. Outze continued to work as the paper's editor in chief to his death in 1980.
Dagbladet Information is the youngest still-surviving newspaper in Denmark and remains independent of the larger publishing houses. As of 2009, it has a daily circulation of 22,313, making it the smallest newspaper in Denmark. It has around 116,000 daily readers and is available on the internet, although access to articles is limited to non-subscribers for a set amount of time. It is the biggest Danish newspaper on Facebook.
The newspaper, which despite being politically independent, it is often regarded as leftist, despite it being equally critical in its point of view of all political organizations. It prints letters from prominent conservative figures and it usually puts great focus in enlightening both sides of a case. The tone is very serious and the amount of charts and pictures is very limited and comparable to the French newspaper Le Monde. Information has a syndication agreement with the British newspaper the Guardian (London), and often collaborates with The Independent for articles and reports.
The corporation also publishes books and has its own publishing house.
On September 8, 2006, the newspaper printed six of the less offensive entries from the Iranian Holocaust cartoon exhibition, which was a response to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. The editor chose the cartoons after consulting the main rabbi in Copenhagen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5327852.stm|title=Paper reprints Holocaust cartoons|publisher=BBC News|date=2006-09-08|accessdate=2006-09-08[/tpl]
