  | isbn = 0-679-72729-9}} One of the best guides to the complexities of ''Lolita''. First published by [[McGraw-Hill]] in 1970. (Nabokov was able to comment on Appel's earliest annotations, creating a situation that Appel described as being like [[John Shade]] revising [[Charles Kinbote]]'s comments on Shade's poem ''Pale Fire''. Oddly enough, this is exactly the situation Nabokov scholar [[Brian Boyd]] proposed to resolve the literary complexities of Nabokov's ''[[Pale Fire]]''.)
