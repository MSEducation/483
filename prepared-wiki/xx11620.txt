A V-twin engine, also called a V2 engine, is a two-cylinder internal combustion engine where the cylinders are arranged in a V configuration.

==History==

Gottlieb Daimler built a V-twin engine in 1889. It was used as a stationary powerplant and to power boats.[tpl]cite book |last=Genta |first=Giancarlo|title=Motor Vehicle Dynamics: Modeling and Simulation |url=http://books.google.com.jm/books?id=yAo-6yQbg9IC&source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=2013-01-15 |year=1997 |publisher=World Scientific |location=Singapore |isbn=9810229119 |page= 26[/tpl]  It was also used in Daimler's second automobile, the 1889 Stahlradwagen ("steel-wheeled car").[tpl]cite book| last = Posthumus| first = Cyril| authorlink = Cyril Posthumus| others = John Wood, illustrator| title = The story of Veteran & Vintage Cars| edition = Phoebus 1977| origyear = 1977| year = 1977| publisher = Hamlyn / Phoebus| location = London| isbn = 0-600-39155-8|pages=12–13 |chapter=Fathers of Invention|quote=But the engine, now fitted lower, in front of the rear axle, had progressed to become a narrow vee-twin with cylinders at 20°, and giving an estimated 1.6hp at 700 rpm.|ref= [/tpl]  The engine was also manufactured under licence in France by Panhard et Levassor.[tpl]cite book |last=Ling |first=Peter J.|title=America and the Automobile: Technology, Reform and Social Change, 1893-1923 |url=http://books.google.com.jm/books?id=LQDoAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=2013-01-18  |year=1990|publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester, UK |isbn=0-7190-3808-1 |page=97[/tpl]

==Configurations==

===Crankshaft configuration===

Most V-twin engines have a single crankpin, which is shared by both connecting rods.  The connecting rods may sit side-by-side with offset cylinders, or they may be "fork & blade" items with cylinders in the same plane without an offset.
Some notable exceptions include the Moto Guzzi 500cc (with 120° V angle and 180° crank pin offset) that Stanley Woods rode to win the 1935 Isle of Man TT;[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.motorcycle.com/events/i-coulda-had-a-v8-so-i-did-12730.html| title = I Coulda Had a V-8.... so I Did| first       = Paul | last        = Garson| authorlink = Paul Garson|date        = 2005-03-20| work        = Motorcycle.com | publisher   = Verticalscope| accessdate = 2010-04-18|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080821151644/http://www.motorcycle.com/events/i-coulda-had-a-v8-so-i-did-12730.html|archivedate=2008-08-21|deadurl=no| quote = By 1934 Guzzi offered a range of 175, 250 and 500cc models including full touring machines. The next year they raised the ante once again, challenging the all-vanquishing Norton at the legendary Isle of Man TT, basically a course the British racer owned lock, stock and single barrel thanks to a phenomenal rider, Scotsman Jim Guthrie. Moto Guzzi went to a Brit for riding skills, one Stanley Woods. They gave him a new racer featuring a 120-degree V-twin with offset cranks firing at 180 degrees with bevel gears and shafts driving the SOHC, good enough for 44 hp at 7500 rpm and 112 mph, on equal standing with the Norton. It had an ace up its sleeve so to speak in that it incorporated a type of pivoted-fork rear suspension while the frontend was a springer, a design that had never won a Senior TT due to its handling deficiencies, or so was thought. Guzzi had done some tweaking in that department as well. It also came equipped with a massive twin-leading shoe front brake, a 4-speed gearbox, and alloy wheels, another innovation to cut down unsprung weight. When the dust had settled and the calculations determined, the wreath of victory went to Woods and Moto Guzzi, leaving Norton as they say, gobsmacked. Not only that, the Guzzi had smashed the track lap record. The next day Moto Guzzi was world famous.[/tpl] the 1983 Honda Shadow 750, claimed as being the first V-twin with an offset-dual-pin crankshaft;[tpl]cite web| url = http://powersports.honda.com/the_story/heritage/heritage_milestone.asp?Decade=1980&TargetUrl=Milestone/Milestone_Model_0102.asp&PrevPageTitle=TimeLine| title = Honda: 1983 Shadow 750| accessdate = 2008-05-20 | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20080519233200/http://powersports.honda.com/the_story/heritage/heritage_milestone.asp?Decade=1980&TargetUrl=Milestone/Milestone_Model_0102.asp&PrevPageTitle=TimeLine | archivedate = May 19, 2008 | deadurl =yes[/tpl] and the 1987 Suzuki VX 800, 45° V angle with 45° crank pin offset in USA and 75° crank pin offset for the rest of the world.[tpl]Cite journal|title = Suzuki VX800|journal = Cycle World|date=July 1990|pages = 36–37|quote = At some point in the motorcycle's development, the company changed the crankpin offset from 45 to 75 degrees in hope of creating a smoother-running motor. But just as production began, American Suzuki engineers decided that the new offset resulted is less mid-range power as well as a too-sanitized exhaust note, one that didn't sound very V-Twin-like. Presto, now the US models come with the 45-degree offset, while the rest of the world gets the 75-degree staggered crankpins.[/tpl]

===V angles===

Generally, any two-cylinder motorcycle engine with its two cylinders arranged more than 0° and less than 180° apart is referred to as a V-twin. Although Ducati use the name "L-twin" for their 90° twin engine (with its front cylinder nearly horizontal and the rear cylinder almost vertical), there is no technical distinction between V-twin and L-twin engines; and these are merely names used by convention.
A 90° V-twin will, with a correct counterweight, yield perfect primary balance,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sense.net/~blaine/twin/twin.html|title=Shaking forces of twin engines|author=Vittore Cossalter|accessdate=2010-07-25|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110724060837/http://www.sense.net/~blaine/twin/twin.html|archivedate=2011-07-24|deadurl=no[/tpl] although its firing intervals are uneven. A V-twin with an angle of less than 90° is more compact and has more even firing intervals, but has significantly poorer mechanical balance.  Offset crankpins are sometimes used to reduce the resulting vibration.

==Orientations==

The terms longitudinal engine and transverse engine are most often used to refer to the crankshaft orientation,  however, some sources, most prominently Moto Guzzi, use the terminology in the opposite way.
A Moto Guzzi Technical Services representative tried to explain to LA Times columnist Susan Carpenter that Moto Guzzi engines are "called 'transverse' because the engine is mounted with the crankshaft oriented front to back instead of left to right."[tpl]Citation |authorlink=Susan Carpenter |first=Susan |last= Carpenter title=Chaps aren't de rigueur, but a helmet, yes|work=ASK THROTTLE JOCKEY |url=http://www.latimes.com/classified/automotive/highway1/la-hyw-qa25jul25,1,2706840.story |quote=According to my source at Moto Guzzi Technical Services, "The Guzzi engine is a 90-degree 'L' twin, actually, because the cylinders are oriented at 90 degrees, instead of a typical V twin that has a smaller angle ( 60-degree, 77-degree, etc.). It is called 'transverse' because the engine is mounted with the crankshaft oriented front to back instead of left to right. Because of this you cannot run a chain or belt drive directly to the rear wheel like in most motorcycles. This is why you have a separate gearbox that bolts to the engine and transfers the power to the rear wheel via the drive shaft. This is how it is done on the Moto Guzzi and a BMW. | date=2007-07-25[/tpl]  In spite of this, it is could be assumed that those who call V-twin motorcycle engines  "transverse" when they are mounted with the crankshaft front-to-back and the cylinders sticking out the sides are saying that to them, the engine's axis is the line passing from one cylinder to the other, at a right angle to the crankshaft, rather than going by the crankshaft's axis.[ref]

Cossleter's Motorcycle Dynamics, or Gaetaeno Cocco's Motorcycle Design and Technology are careful not simply to use the terms "longitudinal engine" or "transverse engine," but rather to specify that they mark the engine's orientation based on the crankshaft, and so they will say "transverse crankshaft engine" or "longitudinal crankshaft engine",[tpl]Citation |title=Motorcycle design and technology |first=Gaetano |last=Cocco |publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing Company |year=2004 |isbn= 978-0-7603-1990-1 |pages=117 ff[/tpl] or, conversely, "transversely mounted cylinders" in referenced to the classic BMW orientation, with a longitudinal crankshaft and cylinders at a right angle to the axis of the frame.[tpl]Citation |url=http://www.bmwmotorcycles.com/pdfs/history/design_tech.pdf |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070927231254/http://www.bmwmotorcycles.com/pdfs/history/design_tech.pdf |archivedate= September 27, 2007 |format= PDF |publisher= BMW Motorrad | title=Heritage/History: Design/Technology |quote= ...the boxer had three unique innovations that would remain throughout its years in development:The engine design included transversely mounted cylinders, which were cooled by exposure to the passing air.[/tpl]

===Transverse crankshaft mounting===

The engine can be mounted in transverse crankshaft position as on Harley-Davidsons, Ducatis and many recent Japanese motorcycles. This layout produces a twin cylinder motorcycle engine that is little or no wider than a single.[tpl]cite book| last                  = Cocco| first                 = Gaetano| title                 = Motorcycle Design and Technology| url                   = http://books.google.com.jm/books?id=Ydk0bgq2_3YC&source=gbs_navlinks_s| accessdate            = 2013-05-28| type                  = | year                  = 2004| publisher             = MotorBooks International| location              = St. Paul, MN USA| isbn                  = 0-7603-1990-1| page                  = 117| chapter               = Chapter 11 The Engine| chapterurl            = http://books.google.com.jm/books?id=Ydk0bgq2_3YC&pg=PA113&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false| quote                 = In some construction layouts the transverse width is the same as a single-cylinder engine, which allows very narrow frames and bodywork with small frontal areas.| ref                   = MDTCocco[/tpl] A narrower engine can be mounted lower in the frame with handling benefits.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl] A significant disadvantage of this configuration for air-cooled engines is that the two cylinders receive different air-flows and cooling of the rear cylinder tends to be restricted.[tpl]cite journal | last1 =Dean | first1 =Paul | editor-last =Edwards | editor-first =David |date=May 2005 | title =Service: Oil miser | journal =Cycle World | volume =44 | issue =5 | page =160 | location =Newport Beach, CA USA | publisher =Hachette Filipacchi Media | type = | id = | issn =0011-4286 | accessdate =2013-05-26 | url =http://books.google.com.jm/books?id=E86bEyC7DzoC&pg=RA5-PA60&dq=V-twin+%22rear+cylinder%22+cooling&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GlKiUY6UN43S9gSkoYCgBg&ved=0CCoQ6AEwADgo#v=onepage&q=V-twin%20%22rear%20cylinder%22%20cooling&f=false | quote =An air-cooled big-bore V-twin in particular can get very hot, especially the rear cylinder, which is not exposed to as much cooling air as the front. | ref =[/tpl] Cooling problems are somewhat mitigated by having all "four" sides of each cylinder exposed to air flow. This differs from a parallel-twin cylinder engine which has a distinct front, back, and sides, but the inside of each cylinder is not exposed to airflow as the cylinders are typically joined together with a cam chain running up through the block in-between the cylinders.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
Some transverse V-twins use a single carburettor in the middle of the V-angle to feed both cylinders. While this allows an economy of parts, it creates further cooling problems for the rear cylinder by placing its hot exhaust port and pipe at the back of the cylinder, out of the way or the air stream.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

File:Ducati Monster 620 Dark.jpg|This air-cooled Ducati Monster 620 has a transverse crankshaft 90° V-twin with one cylinder lying horizontally, and one vertically, so that the rearward, vertical cylinder's air flow is less obstructed by the one in front.
File:Honda VTR250 2009 Engine Radiator.JPG|Honda's VTR250 is similar, but the engine is not leaning forward, thus each cylinder is about 45° from vertical.  The rear cylinder's air flow is blocked, but note this is a water-cooled engine, so what most matters is that the radiator is out in front with good air flow.
File:Ducati Monster S4R Testastretta.jpg|As the Ducati models get larger engines, they gain oil-, and then water-cooling, as in this Monster S4R S. Like the VTR250, the radiators are out in front, but the basic engine orientation retains the cooling advantages of the Monster 620.

===Longitudinal crankshaft mounting===

The longitudinal crankshaft two-cylinder V as seen on Moto-Guzzis and some Hondas is less common. This orientation is suited to shaft drive, eliminating the need for a 90° bevel gear at the transmission end of the shaft. A longitudinal crankshaft engine fits neatly into a typical motorcycle frame, leaving ample room for the transmission, and cooling is facilitated by cylinder heads and exhausts protruding into the air stream.[tpl]Citation |last1=Coombs |first1=Matthew |last2=Haynes |first2=John |last3=Shoemark |first3=Pete |title=Motorcycle Basics | edition=2nd |publisher=Haynes | year=2002| page=1•31| ISBN= 978-1-85960-515-8 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=D0DhHAAACAAJ [/tpl] Longitudinal crankshaft mounting is associated with a torque reaction that tends to twist the motorcycle to one side on sharp acceleration or when opening the throttle in neutral and in the opposite direction on sharp deceleration. Many modern motorcycle manufacturers correct for this effect by rotating flywheels or alternators in the opposite direction to that of the crankshaft.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.motorcyclecruiser.com/roadtests/sport_cruisers_comparison/index.html| title= Sport Cruisers Comparison - Seven Sport-Cruiser Motorcycles| first1= Art| last1= Friedman| first2= Andrew| last2= Trevitt| first3= Andrew| last3= Cherney| first4= Jamie| last4= Elvidge| first5= Evans| last5= Brasfield|date=April 2000| work= Motorcycle Cruiser| publisher= Source Interlink Media| location = | at= "Take a Spin" section, paragraph 4| accessdate= 2010-09-10|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100502180324/http://www.motorcyclecruiser.com/roadtests/sport_cruisers_comparison/index.html|archivedate=2010-05-02|deadurl=no| quote= "Though the Valkyrie also has a longitudinal crankshaft, this torque reaction has been eliminated by making some of the components, such as the alternator, spin the opposite direction of the engine."[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url = http://www.breganzane.com/vm/history/v6/page3.html| title= Developing the V6 - Taming The Beast| first= Stephen | last= Battisson | year= 1997| work= The Laverda V6| publisher= Stephen Battisson| page= 3| accessdate= 2010-09-10| archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20110708092245/http://www.breganzane.com/vm/history/v6/page3.html | archivedate =2011-07-08 | deadurl = yes| quote= "By arranging the rest of the engine internals to rotate in the opposite direction to the crankshaft their forces are cancelled out without having to resort to the weight, complexity and friction associated with two crankshafts.

==Commercial use==

Commercial equipment such as pressure washers, lawn and garden tractors, tillers, generators and water pumps use V-twin engines when that equipment is large enough to need more power, usually in excess of 16 horsepower, than can be provided by a single-cylinder engine. These V-twin engines have horizontal or vertical crankshafts, usually have 90-degree crankshaft angles, and are usually forced-air–cooled. The V-twin configuration gives these engines a smaller footprint and less vibration, in the absence of balancing shafts, than other two-cylinder configurations.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
