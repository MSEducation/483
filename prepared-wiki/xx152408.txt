Russett is an unincorporated community planned community of [tpl]convert|613|acre|km2[/tpl] in far-western Anne Arundel County, Maryland, near Laurel. It is situated in a park-like setting complemented by [tpl]convert|12|mi|km[/tpl] of walking trails and a [tpl]convert|70|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] lake nature preserve.
About 13,000 residents live in Russett, which is divided into 20 residential neighborhoods and includes three commercial rental properties. The community of single-family homes, condominiums, and townhouses is nearly built out to a capacity of 3,600 units. Two neighborhoods are under construction.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.russett.org/Neighborhoods~63846~10954.htm |title=Neighborhoods |accessdate=2007-09-17 |publisher=Russett Community Association[/tpl]

==Government==

The Russett Community Association, Inc. (RCA) is the homeowners' association, and all homeowners are members. Annual HOA fees paid by homeowners fund an annual $2.5 million budget, which goes toward maintenance of playgrounds; a tot lot; tennis, basketball and beach volleyball courts; four pools and a pool house; walking trails; a community center; and private security. The county opened a police substation near the community in 2006.[tpl]cite press release |title=New Anne Arundel County Police Sub-Station Officially Opens in West County |publisher=Anne Arundel County Citizens Information Center |url=http://www.aacounty.org/News/Archive2006/WCountyPolice.cfm |date=2006-06-14 | accessdate=2008-04-02[/tpl]
Except for condominiums, which have their own board of directors, each neighborhood has a committee with up to three members (elected at the annual RCA meeting).  These three elect a chairperson who serves as the voting member.  Representatives from all neighborhoods meet monthly and advise on community issues, with voting members deciding on changes to community documents, special fee assessments, and membership in the Board of Directors.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.russett.org/About-Russett~63810~10954.htm |title=About Russett |accessdate=2007-09-17 |publisher=Russett Community Association[/tpl]
Within Russett is a $4.3 million library operated by Anne Arundel County Public Library. Completed in 1998, The Maryland City at Russett Branch is more than [tpl]convert|15000|sqft|m2[/tpl] – or four times the size of its shuttered predecessor – with an initial collection of 80,000 items. The project was built on [tpl]convert|2|acre|m2[/tpl] donated by the developer, Russett Community Limited Partnership (RCLP).

==Geography==

Russett is bordered by the Little Patuxent River and [tpl]convert|70|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] Oxbow Lake Nature Preserve,[tpl]cite news |last=Siegel |first=Andrea |title=Russett houses surrounded by parks |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=2008-03-16 |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/realestate/bal-re.insider16mar16,0,977652.story |accessdate=2008-04-02[/tpl] which attracts waterfowl and birds. Part of Russett’s land holdings is an undisturbed [tpl]convert|78|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] parcel under the control of the county’s Board of Education.

==History==

At the inception of the project, home prices ranged from $90,000 for a condominium to $250,000 for a single-family home. Today, even with a downturn in the real-estate market, condominiums are selling for more than $200,000; townhouses for at least $250,000; and larger single-family homes for more than $500,000.
Russett faces growth pressures triggered by the 2005 base realignment and closure process (known as BRAC). About 22,000 defense workers are expected to relocate to nearby Fort Meade over the next several years. About 100 to 150 households will move to Russett over that period because of BRAC, according to state projections.[tpl]cite web |title=Base Relocation and Closure (BRAC) Report |date=December 2006 |publisher=Maryland Department of Planning |url=http://www.mdp.state.md.us/msdc/military/Report/BRAC_Report.htm |accessdate=2008-04-02[/tpl]
Russett uses ZIP code 20724 and falls within Maryland State Senate and House of Delegates District 21. The community also lies within Maryland's Third Congressional District and Anne Arundel County's 4th Council District.[tpl]cite web |title=Anne Arundel County Council |publisher=Anne Arundel County Citizens Information Center |url=http://www.aacounty.org/CountyCouncil/index.cfm[/tpl]
