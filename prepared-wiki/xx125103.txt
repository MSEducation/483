McCoy's early efforts were largely focussed on B movies, such as several entries in the Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto canons. He had just graduated to big studio productions like an uncredited assist on Joan of Arc (1948) and Quo Vadis (1951, for which he received an Academy Award nomination) when he died suddenly in 1956 at the age of 43.
