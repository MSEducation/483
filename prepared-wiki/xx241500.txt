[[Common burial]]

CATEGORIES: Death customs

Common burial, also known as mass interment or mass grave, is the burial of several bodies in one collective grave. Human infants, particularly premature ones, are sometimes given a common burial when they die due to loss of pregnancy, stillbirth, or early infant death. One or two small caskets hold all the infants.
Mass graves are a more infamous form of common burial, usually used only in cases with larger numbers of bodies, such as genocide or natural disaster.
