The Race Relations Act 1965 was the first legislation in the United Kingdom to address racial discrimination.
The Act outlawed discrimination on the "grounds of colour, race, or ethnic or national origins" in public places.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/8/newsid_4457000/4457112.stm|title=On this day: 8 December 1965: New UK race law 'not tough enough'|year=2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 January 2010 | date=8 December 1965[/tpl]
It also prompted the creation of The Race Relations Board (in 1966), to consider complaints under the Act.

==Reasons for the Act's introduction==

The UK saw an influx of economic migrants after World War II, many from the Commonwealth countries. The Museum of London states that "casual ‘colour prejudice’ was part of daily life" for many.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/Collections/OnlineResources/X20L/Themes/1380/1203/|title=Race Relations Acts 1965-1976|publisher=The Museum of London|accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl]
In 1958, London saw the Notting Hill riots, and in 1963 the Bristol Bus Boycott occurred.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/nov/10/race.immigrationpolicy|title=In Praise Of...The Race Relations Acts|last=Editorial|date=10 November 2005|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=10 January 2010 | location=London[/tpl]

==Outline==

The Act made it a civil offence (rather than a criminal offence) to refuse to serve a person, an unreasonable delay in serving someone, or overcharging, on the grounds of colour, race, or ethnic or national origins.
The first conviction under the act came in October 1967, when a 17-year-old member of the National Socialist Party was found guilty of racial discrimination at Middlesex Area Sessions.

==Limitations==

The Act did not extend to Northern Ireland, and specifically excluded shops and private boarding houses.
It was "a weak piece of legislation"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/discrimination-race-relations-policy.htm|title=Discrimination and race relations policy|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl] and failed to end racial discrimination in the UK, as evidenced by the expansion of the British National Front and Enoch Powell's 1968 Rivers of Blood speech.

==Amendment and repeal==

The Act was strengthened with the Race Relations Act 1968, which extended the legislation's remit to cover employment and housing. It was repealed by the Race Relations Act 1976, which saw the creation of the Commission for Racial Equality.
