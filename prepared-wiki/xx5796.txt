==Available forms==

In some countries, the optically pure (S)-enantiomer (dexketoprofen) is available; its trometamol salt is said to be particularly rapidly reabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, having a rapid onset of effects.
The earliest report of therapeutic use in humans was in 1972 [tpl]cite journal | author = A. N. Gyory, M. Bloch, H. C. Burry, R.

==Indication==

Ketoprofen is generally prescribed for arthritis-related inflammatory pains or severe toothaches that result in the inflammation of the gums.
Ketoprofen topical plasters are being extensively used for treatment of musculoskeletal pain.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 16078335 | year = 2005 | last1 = Mazières | first1 = B | last2 = Rouanet | first2 = S | last3 = Guillon | first3 = Y | last4 = Scarsi | first4 = C | last5 = Reiner | first5 = V | title = Topical ketoprofen patch in the treatment of tendinitis: a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. | volume = 32 | issue = 8 | pages = 1563–70 | journal = The Journal of rheumatology[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.2165/00126839-200506060-00003 | pmid = 16274258 | year = 2005 | last1 = Mazières | first1 = B | title = Topical ketoprofen patch. | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 337–44 | journal = Drugs in R&D[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | pmid = 20087696 | year = 2010 | last1 = Sekiya | first1 = I | pages = 154–8 | last2 = Morito | first2 = T | last3 = Hara | issue = 1 | first3 = K | last4 = Yamazaki | first4 = J | pmc = 2850498 | last5 = Ju | first5 = YJ | volume = 11 | last6 = Yagishita | first6 = K | last7 = Mochizuki | first7 = T | last8 = Tsuji | first8 = K | last9 = Muneta | first9 = T | title = Ketoprofen Absorption by Muscle and Tendon after Topical or Oral Administration in Patients Undergoing Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction | doi = 10.1208/s12249-009-9367-2 | journal = AAPS PharmSciTech[/tpl] The plasters have been shown to provide rapid and sustained delivery to underlying tissues without significantly increasing levels of drug concentration in the blood when compared to the traditional oral administration.[tpl]cite journal | pmid = 18689771 | year = 2008 | last1 = Gayman | first1 = MD | last2 = Turner | first2 = RJ | last3 = Cui | first3 = M | title = Physical Limitations and Depressive Symptoms: Exploring the Nature of the Association | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = S219–S228 | journal = The journals of gerontology.

Ketoprofen can also be used for treatment of some pain, especially nerve pain such as sciatica, postherpetic neuralgia and referred pain for radiculopathy, in the form of a cream, ointment, liquid, spray, or gel, which may also contain ketamine and lidocaine, along with other agents which may be useful, such as cyclobenzaprine, amitriptyline, acyclovir, gabapentin, orphenadrine and other drugs used as NSAIDs or adjuvant, atypical or potentiators for pain treatment.

==Efficacy==

A systematic review and meta-analysis indicated "The efficacy of orally administered ketoprofen in relieving moderate-severe pain and improving functional status and general condition was significantly better than that of ibuprofen and/or diclofenac."[tpl]cite journal | last1=Sarzi-Puttini | first1=P | author2=Atzeni, F; Lanata, L; Bagnasco, M | title=Efficacy of ketoprofen vs. ibuprofen and diclofenac: a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis | journal=Clinical and experimental rheumatology | date=2013 | volume=31 | issue=5 | pages=731-8 | pmid=23711416 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0063862/[/tpl] A Cochrane review investigating ketoprofen as a single-dose oral analgesic in acute, moderate-to-severe postoperative pain concluded that its efficacy is equivalent to drugs such as ibuprofen and diclofenac.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Barden|first1=J|author2=Derry, S; McQuay, HJ; Moore, RA|title=Single dose oral ketoprofen and dexketoprofen for acute postoperative pain in adults|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews | date=2009 | issue=4 | pages=CD007355 | pmid=19821407 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007355.pub2/full[/tpl] In particular, after dental surgery, doses >25 mg provide at least 50% pain relief to more than 60% of people treated, giving relief for about 5 hours.

==Use in horses and other animals==

Ketoprofen is a common NSAID, antipyretic, and analgesic used in horses and other equines.Forney, Barbara C, MS, VMD.  Equine Medications, Revised Edition. Blood Horse Publications. Lexington, KY. Copyright 2007. It is also used as a mild painkiller in smaller animals, generally following surgical procedures.  It is most commonly used for musculoskeletal pain, joint problems, and soft tissue injury, as well as laminitis.  It is also used to control fevers and prevent endotoxemia.  However, it may mask the symptoms of the underlying problem, and therefore make diagnosis more difficult for a veterinarian.

==Uses with other drugs==

Ketoprofen should not be used in combination with other NSAIDs or corticosteroids, as this increases the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration.  It should also be used with caution with other anticoagulants.  It is commonly used with omeprazole, sucralfate, and cimetidine to help protect the GI tract.

==Administration==

Ketoprofen, when administered intravenously, is recommended for a maximum of five days of use.  Its analgesic and antipyretic effects begin to occur one to two hours following administration.  The most common dosage is 1 mg/ lb, once per day, although this dosage may be lowered for ponies, which are most susceptible to NSAID side effects.  
It is also available as a capsule dosage form and a tablet.

==Ecological problems==

Recent studies have found ketoprofen, like diclofenac, is a veterinary drug causing lethal effects in red-headed vultures. Vultures feeding on the carcasses of recently treated livestock suffer acute kidney failure within days of exposure.Second blow for Asian vultures
