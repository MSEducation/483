[[Two-liter bottle]]

CATEGORIES: Bottles, Metrication

The two-litre bottle is a common container for soft drinks. These bottles are produced from polyethylene terephthalate, also known as PET plastic, using the blow molding process. Bottle labels consist of a printed, tight-fitted plastic sleeve. A resealable screw-top allows the contents to be used at various times while retaining carbonation.
In the United States, the two litre bottle is one of the few cases where a product is sold by a round number of metric units. Since very few other beverages are sold in this exact quantity, the term "two-litre" in American English almost invariably refers to a soft drink bottle. Other common metric sizes for plastic soft drink bottles include 500 millilitres, 1 litre and 3 litres.
In some other countries like Russia plastic bottles are used for selling beer as well.

==History==

PepsiCo introduced the first two-litre sized soft drink bottle in 1970.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.pepsico.com/PEP_Company/History/index.cfm |publisher=PepsiCo |title=PepsiCo - Company - History |year=2006[/tpl] The bottle was invented by a team led by Nathaniel Wyeth of DuPont who received the patent in 1973. In 1985, a three-litre bottle appeared on supermarket shelves.  The design is still used to this day by some bottlers.[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E2DC173BF930A25752C0A963948260|publisher=New York times |title=PROSPECTS;Endangered Species |date=January 13, 1985 | first=H.J. | last=Maidenberg | accessdate=May 26, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://v2.cba.ua.edu/about/news/press_releases/news093098.html |publisher=C&BA News |title=Alabama Business Hall of Fame to Celebrate 25th Anniversary |date=September 30, 1998[/tpl] Most modern-day two-litre bottles are one piece of PET (Polyethylene terephthalate) with a base that is molded with a radial corrugation to provide strength for the bottom and the ability to stand upright. Most early two-litres had a separate opaque base glued to the hemispherical bottom of the clear PET flask. This base had a coaxial corrugation and drain holes. It was abolished in the 1990s, in part due to difficulties recycling the two separate plastics.

==Recycling==

Used two-litre bottles see new life in a variety of uses including carpeting, boat hulls, polyester fabric, filling for jackets, sleeping bags, mattresses, pillows, recycling bins, scouring pads, and on an increasing scale, new soft drink bottles.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.napcor.com/Master.pdf|publisher=NAPCOR |title=Best Practices and Industry Standards in PET Plastic Recycling |year=2003[/tpl]
