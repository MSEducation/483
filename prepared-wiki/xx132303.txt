KTurtle is an educational programming environment for turtle graphics. It is released under the open source GNU General Public License and is part of the KDE SC 4. KTurtle has a built-in programming language that is loosely based on the Logo programming language. It is one of the few localized programming languages; the programming commands are translated to the human language of the programmer.
KTurtle has been packaged by many Linux distributions, including Red Hat, Suse, Debian and Ubuntu. Some distributions package KTurtle as a separate application, while some provide one package for the whole kdeedu module, which includes KTurtle. KTurtle is available for Windows in the Kdeedu package within the KDE SC 4 windows distribution.
The KTurtle language and IDE are limited to teaching programming using turtle graphics, and is not intended for other applications.
