The biggest organisation associated with the British Left is the Labour Party with over 100,000 members. While the Labour Party shifted increasingly to the right under New Labour, as an opposition party under Ed Miliband it has moved back to occupying traditionally social democratic territory. Aside from Labour the biggest leftist parties are the Green Party, TUSC, Plaid Cymru, and Respect.
The Communist Party of Great Britain had a peak membership of 56,000 in 1945. Other groups include the Socialist Workers Party, Workers' Revolutionary Party, the Alliance for Workers' Liberty, Socialist Party and Socialist Appeal.

===Labour Party===

The biggest left-wing party in the UK in terms of members and representation is the Labour Party. The party had 201,374 members on 31 December 2004 according to accounts filed with the Electoral Commission. The Labour Party grew out of the trade union movement and socialist political parties of the 19th century, and continues to describe itself as a party of democratic socialism. With the party's rebranding as New Labour under Tony Blair, however, the party adopted a number of Thatcherite policies â€“ in 2010, the Political Compass website classified the Labour Party as being right-wing and authoritarian. Many observers describe the Labour Party as social democratic or neo-liberal rather than democratic socialist. Blair himself has described New Labour's political position as a "Third Way". The Socialist Campaign Group is a left-wing grouping of Labour Party members of parliament in the United Kingdom. It was formed in 1981 by Tony Benn's supporters as a split from the Tribune Group. The Compass organisation has also attracted a number of members disillusioned with the New Labour project. In the 2005 General Election Labour won 9,556,183 votes.

===Other organisations===

The next largest Party is the Green Party, followed by the Respect Party which has the support of: Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee), the Socialist Unity Network, Socialist Resistance and the Revolutionary Communist Party of Britain (Marxist-Leninist). Respect allows its members to hold membership of other political organisations, and people of no other political organisation. Respect's only Member of Parliament is George Galloway who is also the leader of Respect.Helen Pidd "Who is the leader of the Respect party these days?" theguardian.com (The Northerner Blog),  28 October 2013
Respect's first electoral test was the 2004 Greater London Authority elections, in which Lindsey German came fifth. In the 2005 general election, the Respect Coalition won 68,065 votes. By the time of the 2008 Greater London Authority elections, the Socialist Workers Party had left the coalition amid an acrimonious dispute with George Galloway and instead contested the elections as the Left List with Lindsey German as candidate (coming eighth). Since the split the two factions have become Respect Renewal (now simply Respect) and the Left Alternative.
