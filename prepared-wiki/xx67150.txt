The Tasman Spirit is a Greek registered oil tanker.  The tanker was launched in February 1979 and was formerly called the Mabini and Kenko.
On July 28, 2003 she ran aground near the city of Karachi. Over 12,000 tons of oil spilled into the Arabian Sea in what is considered by some to be the largest environmental disaster in Pakistan's history. According to the IUCN 16 kilometres of coastline has been polluted.
The ship's insurer offered 10 million rupees (about $180,000 US dollars in 2003) in compensation to the Karachi port authorities, and agreed to pay all cleaning expenses.
