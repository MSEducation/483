==History==

According to an official source, Kukerin's name is of Aboriginal origin, was first recorded as the name of a local soak and gully in 1908 and has also been spelled "Cookerin", but the precise meaning is not known.[tpl]LandInfo WA|c|K|17 April 2007[/tpl]  There is no hard evidence for a theory that the area was named after sandalwood cutters named "Cooke" and "Ring".
Until 1912, the area was known as Merilup (a name that now refers to an area to the south). In the 1870s, John Holland took up a pastoral lease of [tpl]convert|9000|acre|km2|0[/tpl] in the area and established a sandalwood depot. Sandalwood cutters opened up much of the surrounding area, and in 1904 the Rabbit-Proof Fence was built near the town.
In 1912, the town was gazetted when it became the terminus of an extension of the Wagin to Dumbleyung train line in 1912. The primary school and hall were built in 1914, and Kukerin Hotel began trading in 1928 â€” all are still open to this day. During 2012 the town will be celebrating its Centenary with a variety of celebratory events.

==Present day==

Kukerin is largely an agricultural town, with wheat and sheep farming being the main occupations. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cbh.com.au/media/120302/cbh%20receival%20sites%20-%20contact%20details.pdf|title=CBH receival sites|year=2011|accessdate=1 April 2013[/tpl]
It functions as a service town for the surrounding agricultural area, and contains a general store, primary school, hotel, newsagency/post office and sports fields amongst other facilities. The TrachMach Fair used to be held with various vintage and modern vehicles on display. In recent years this has transformed into the Kukerin Creekbed and Burnout Competition, which is held during the September long weekend.  During this event a mega screen is set up where the AFL Grand Final can be viewed.Information available from Shire of Dumbleyung, contacted 27 October 2006.
