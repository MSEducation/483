==Interfaith activities with Opus Dei==

According the Kreiman Brill, Josemaria Escriva's teachings are strongly rooted in Talmudic traditions about work. The Talmudic concept of work, said Kreiman, is that "work is not a punishment, but man's duty, a blessing from God that allows us to fully enjoy the Sabbath and allows us to be in the image and likeness of God". http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1653512-angel-kreiman-un-referente-del-dialogo-interreligioso-que-hizo-oir-su-voz
