Cyrus Redding (1785, Cornwall - 1870) was a British journalist and wine writer.

==Biography==

The son of a Baptist minister, Redding was privately educated. He moved to London about 1806, and worked for the Pilot (est. 1807)  before editing the Plymouth Chronicle and then the West Briton and Cornwall Advertiser which he founded in 1810. 
Travelling to Paris in 1814, Redding edited Galignani's Messenger from 1815 to 1818, as well as providing Paris correspondence for the Examiner. 
Between 1821 and 1830 Redding effectively edited The New Monthly Magazine (owned by Henry Colburn, and nominally edited by Thomas Campbell). From 1831 to 1833 Redding and Campbell edited The Metropolitan Magazine. He edited the Bath Guardian (1834–5) and the Staffordshire Examiner (1836–40). In 1841 he made two unsuccessful attempts to found journals, the English Journal and London Journal. 
After that time he abandoned journalism for the writing of books. To his earlier novel, Gabrielle (1829), a children's book on shipwrecks (1833) and his history of wine (1833), he now began a series of county histories, memoirs of William Beckford and Thomas Campbell, and volumes of autobiography and reminiscences.

==Famous quotes==

While at a small luncheon with a close friend, he was once asked if he would like another glass of the house red, to which he replied, "Oh, wine not!". He is mostly accredited as being the first to say this rather cheesy one-liner.
