The Saturday Night Experience is the seventh studio album from singer Jody Watley.

==History==

A Japanese-only import, 'Saturday Night Experience found Watley experimenting more freely with underground electronic styles like deep house, drum n bass, trip hop and downtempo. Originally intended as an EP http://www.soulmusic.com/ExpressYourself/ExpressYourselfJodyWatley.html (hence the subtitling: "with Jody Watley"), the recording's popularity with fans caused Watley to declare it a full-length album proper. The Saturday Night Experience also foreshadowed the fully club-friendly sounds that Watley would embrace on subsequent full-length releases.Jody Watley | Music Artist | Videos, News, Photos & Ringtones | MTV
In 2002, a limited edition version of The Saturday Night Experience, dubbed The Saturday Night Experience EP, was sold exclusively through Watley's own official website. Packaged in a paper sleeve, the limited pressing contained remixes of "Timeless" and Pure Joy".
