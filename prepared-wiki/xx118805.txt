The Skagen Line or the Skagen Railway ([tpl]lang-da|Skagensbanen[/tpl]) is a [tpl]convert|39.7|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] long standard gauge single track railway line between Skagen and Frederikshavn, Denmark. The railway links the fishing port and seaside resort of Skagen with the Danish rail network.
The railway line opened as a narrow gauge railway in 1890 and was converted to standard gauge in 1924. It is currently owned and operated by the railway company Nordjyske Jernbaner (NJ) which runs frequent local train services from Skagen station to Frederikshavn station with onward connections by DSB to the rest of Denmark.

==History==

In 1924, the railway line was converted to standard gauge to avoid the need to transfer cargoes of fish in Frederikshavn. As a consequence of the conversion, the layout of Skagen station was extensively changed. As part of the conversion, the right-of-way between Frederikshavn and Rimmen halt was changed so the railway line passed by the coastal town of Strandby instead of Elling.
In 2001, the operating company Skagensbanen A/S (SB) merged with Hjørring Privatbaner A/S (HP) to form the railway company Nordjyske Jernbaner. Headquartered in Hjørring, the company is now responsible for running the Hjørring–Hirtshals and Frederikshavn–Skagen lines.
