"Whatever You Like" is a song and single by "Weird Al" Yankovic, the first song from the digital EP Internet Leaks and was later released on his thirteenth studio album "Alpocalypse".  It is a direct parody of a song of the same name by T.I.. In a manner similar to T.I.'s song, the lyrics describe a man wooing a girlfriend with gifts that she may want, though, in light of recent economic problems, these are inexpensive or economical options, such as clipping coupons or going out to dinner at Burger King or McDonald's.
"Whatever You Like" is the first (and only) Yankovic parody to have exactly the same title as the original it parodies. Yankovic commented that thanks to a rapid approval from T.I. he was able to get permission for, write, record and upload the song to iTunes within 2 weeks and while the original song was still at No. 1 (it was there for 5 weeks).

In late 2008 Yankovic started to explore the digital distribution of his songs. On October 7, 2008, Yankovic planned to release a parody of "Whatever You Like" from artist T.I., which Yankovic said he had come up with two weeks before. Yankovic said that the benefit of digital distribution is that "I do not have to wait around while my songs get old and dated—I can get them out on the Internet almost immediately."[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1043863/weird-al-goes-digital-with-ti-cover | title = Weird Al Goes Digital With T.I.
