The Yellow River or Huang He is the second-longest river in Asia, following the Yangtze River, and the sixth-longest in the world at the estimated length of [tpl]convert|5464|km|mi||sp=us|abbr=on[/tpl].Yellow River (Huang He) Delta, China, Asia. Geol.lsu.edu (2000-02-28). Retrieved on 2013-02-04. Originating in the Bayan Har Mountains in Qinghai province of western China, it flows through nine provinces, and it empties into the Bohai Sea near the city of Dongying in Shandong province. The Yellow River basin has an east–west extent of about [tpl]convert|1900|km|-1|sp=us[/tpl] and a north–south extent of about [tpl]convert|1100|km|-1|sp=us|abbr=on[/tpl]. Its total basin area is about [tpl]convert|742443|km²|sp=us[/tpl].
The Yellow River is called "the cradle of Chinese civilization", because its basin was the birthplace of ancient Chinese civilization, and it was the most prosperous region in early Chinese history. However, frequent devastating floods and course changes produced by the continual elevation of the river bed, sometimes above the level of its surrounding farm fields, has also earned it the unenviable names China's Sorrow and Scourge of the Sons of Han.New York Times "A Troubled River Mirrors China's Path to Modernity". 19 November 2006 p. 4.

==Name==

Early Chinese literature including the Yu Gong or Tribute of Yu dating to the Warring States period (475[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]221 BC) refers to the Yellow River as simply [tpl]linktext|河[/tpl] (Old Chinese: *C.gˤajBaxter, Wm. H. & Sagart, Laurent. [tpl]PDFlink|1=Baxter–Sagart Old Chinese Reconstruction|2=1.93 MB[/tpl], p. 41. 2011. Accessed 11 October 2011.), a character that has come to mean "river" in modern usage. The first appearance of the name [tpl]linktext|黃河[/tpl] (Old Chinese: *N-kʷˤaŋ C.gˤaj; Middle Chinese: Hwang Ha) is in the Book of Han written during the Western Han dynasty (206 BC[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]AD 9). The adjective "yellow" describes the perennial color of the muddy water in the lower course of the river, which arises from soil (loess) being carried downstream.
One of its older Mongolian names was the "Black River",Parker, Edward H. China: Her History, Diplomacy, and Commerce, from the Earliest Times to the Present Day, p. 11. Dutton (New York), 1917. because the river runs clear before it enters the Loess Plateau, but the current name of the river among Inner Mongolians is Ȟatan Gol ([tpl]linktext|Хатан гол[/tpl], "Queen River").Geonames.de. "geonames.de: Huang He". In Mongolia itself, it is simply called the Šar Mörön ([tpl]linktext|Шар мөрөн[/tpl], "Yellow River").
In Qinghai, the river's Tibetan name is "River of the Peacock" (Tibetan: [tpl]linktext|རྨ་ཆུ[/tpl]།, Ma Chu; Chinese: s [tpl]linktext|玛|曲[/tpl], t [tpl]linktext|瑪|曲[/tpl], p Mǎ Qū).
The name Hwang Ho in English is the Postal Map romanization of the river's Mandarin name.

==History==

===Dynamics===

The Yellow River is one of several rivers that are essential for China's very existence.  At the same time, however, it has been responsible for several deadly floods, including the only natural disasters in recorded history that have killed more than a million people.  The deadliest was a 1332–33 flood that killed 7 million people.  Close behind is the 1887 flood, which killed anywhere from 900,000 to 2 million people, and a 1931 flood (part of a massive number of floods that year) that killed 1–4 million people.[tpl]cite book|title=The Great Big Book of Horrible Things|last=White|first=Matthew|authorlink=Matthew White (atrocitologist)|publisher=W. W. Norton|year=2012|page=47|isbn=9780393081923[/tpl]
The cause of the floods is the large amount of fine-grained loess carried by the river from the Loess Plateau, which is continuously deposited along the bottom of its channel. The sedimentation causes natural dams to slowly accumulate. These subaqueous dams were unpredictable and generally undetectable. Eventually, the enormous amount of water has to find a new way to the sea, forcing it to take the path of least resistance.  When this happens, it bursts out across the flat North China Plain, sometimes taking a new channel and inundating any farmland, cities or towns in its path. The traditional Chinese response of building higher and higher levees along the banks sometimes also contributed to the severity of the floods: When flood water did break through the levees, it could no longer drain back into the river bed as it would after a normal flood as the river bed was sometimes now higher than the surrounding countryside. These changes could cause the river's mouth to shift as much as [tpl]convert|480|km|-1|sp=us|abbr=on[/tpl], sometimes reaching the ocean to the north of Shandong Peninsula and sometimes to the south.Gascoigne, Bamber and Gascoigne, Christina (2003) The Dynasties of China, Perseus Books Group, ISBN 0786712198
Another historical source of devastating floods is the collapse of upstream ice dams in Inner Mongolia with an accompanying sudden release of vast quantities of impounded water. There have been 11 such major floods in the past century, each causing tremendous loss of life and property. Nowadays, explosives dropped from aircraft are used to break the ice dams before they become dangerous.The Ice Bombers Move Against Mongolia. strategypage.com (29 March 2011)
Prior to the advent of modern dams in China, the Yellow River was extremely prone to flooding. In the 2,540 years prior to A.D. 1946, the Yellow River has been reckoned to have flooded 1,593 times, shifting its course 26 times noticeably and nine times severely.Tregear, T. R. A Geography of China, p. 218. 1965. These floods include some of the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded. Before modern disaster management, when floods occurred, some of the population might initially die from drowning but then many more would suffer from the ensuing famine and spread of diseases.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/ems/flood_cds/en/index.html|title=Flooding and communicable diseases fact sheet|publisher=World Health Organization|page=2|accessdate=27 July 2011[/tpl]

===Ancient times===

Historical documents from the Spring and Autumn periodGernet, Jacques. Le monde chinois, p. 59. Map "4. Major states of the Chunqiu period (Spring and Autumn)". [tpl]fr icon[/tpl]  English version: [tpl]citation|last=Gernet|first=Jacques|year=1996|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C|title=A History of Chinese Civilization|edition=Second edition|publisher=Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-49781-7[/tpl] and Qin Dynasty"Qin Dynasty Map". indicate that the Yellow River at that time flowed considerably north of its present course. These accounts show that after the river passed Luoyang, it flowed along the border between Shanxi and Henan Provinces, then continued along the border between Hebei and Shandong before emptying into Bohai Bay near present-day Tianjin. Another outlet followed essentially the present course.
The river left these paths in 602 BC and shifted completely south of the Shandong Peninsula. Sabotage of dikes, canals, and reservoirs and deliberate flooding of rival states became a standard military tactic during the Warring States period.Allaby, Michael & Garrat, Richard. Facts on File Dangerous Weather Series: Floods, p. 142. Infobase Pub., 2003. ISBN 0-8160-5282-4. Accessed 15 October 2011. Major flooding in AD 11 is credited with the downfall of the short-lived Xin dynasty, and another flood in AD 70 returned the river north of Shandong on essentially its present course.

===Medieval times===

In 923 a desperate Later Liang general Duan Ning again broke the dikes, flooding [tpl]convert|1000|sqmi|sp=us[/tpl] in a failed attempt to protect the Later Liang capital from the Later Tang. A similar proposal from the Song engineer Li Chun concerning flooding the lower reaches of the river to protect the central plains from the Khitai was overruled in 1020: the Treaty of Shanyuan between the two states had expressly forbidden the Song from establishing new moats or changing river courses.Elvin, Mark & Liu Cuirong (eds.) Studies in Environment and History: Sediments of Time: Environment and Society in Chinese History, pp. 554 ff. Cambridge Uni. Press, 1998. ISBN 0-521-56381-X. Accessed 15 Oct. 2011.
Breaches occurred regardless: one at Henglong in 1034 divided the course in three and repeatedly flooded the northern regions of Dezhou and Bozhou. The Song worked for five years futilely attempting to restore the previous course[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]using over 35,000 employees, 100,000 conscripts, and 220,000 tons of wood and bamboo in a single year[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]before abandoning the project in 1041. The more sluggish river then occasioned a breach at Shanghu that sent the main outlet north towards Tianjin in 1048 and by 1194 blocked the mouth of the Huai River.Grousset, Rene. The Rise and Splendour of the Chinese Empire, p. 303. University of California Press, 1959. The build up of silt deposits was such that even after the Yellow River later shifted its course, the Huai was no longer able to flow along its historic one. Instead, its water pools into Hongze Lake and then runs southward toward the Yangtze River.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
A flood in 1344 returned the Yellow River south of Shandong. The Yuan dynasty was waning, and the emperor forced enormous teams to build new embankments for the river. The terrible conditions helped fuel rebellions that led to the founding of the Ming dynasty. The course changed again in 1391 when the river flooded from Kaifeng to Fengyang in Anhui. It was finally stabilized by the eunuch Li Xing during the public works projects following the 1494 flood.
The river flooded many times in the 16th century, including in 1526, 1534, 1558, and 1587. Each flood affected the river's lower course.Tsai, Shih-Shan Henry. SUNY Series in Chinese Local Studies: The Eunuchs in the Ming Dynasty. SUNY Press, 1996. ISBN 0791426874, 9780791426876. Accessed 16 Oct 2012.
The 1642 flood was man-made, caused by the attempt of the Ming governor of Kaifeng to use the river to destroy the peasant rebels under Li Zicheng who had been besieging the city for the past six months.Lorge, Peter Allan. War, Politics and Society in Early Modern China, 900–1795, p. 147. Routledge, 2005. ISBN 978-0-415-31691-0. He directed his men to break the dikes in an attempt to flood the rebels, but destroyed his own city instead: the flood and the ensuing famine and plague are estimated to have killed 300,000 of the city's previous population of 378,000.Xu Xin. The Jews of Kaifeng, China: History, Culture, and Religion, p. 47. Ktav Publishing Inc, 2003. ISBN 978-0-88125-791-5. The once-prosperous city was nearly abandoned until its rebuilding under the Kangxi Emperor in the Qing Dynasty.

The 1887 flood has been estimated to have killed between 900,000 and 2 million people,International Rivers Report. "Before the Deluge". 2007. and is the second-worst natural disaster in history (excluding famines and epidemics). The Yellow River more or less adopted its present course during the 1897 flood.Needham, Joseph. Science and Civilization in China. Vol. 1. Introductory Orientations, p. 68. Caves Books Ltd. (Taipei), 1986 ISBN 052105799X.
The 1931 flood killed an estimated 1,000,000 to 4,000,000, and is the worst natural disaster recorded (excluding famines and epidemics).
On 9 June 1938, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Nationalist troops under Chiang Kai-Shek broke the levees holding back the river near the village of Huayuankou in Henan, causing what has been called a "war-induced natural disaster".[tpl]by whom|date=October 2011[/tpl] The goal of the operation was to stop the advancing Japanese troops by following a strategy of  "using water as a substitute for soldiers" (yishui daibing). The 1938 flood of an area covering [tpl]convert|54000|km²|sigfig=3|sp=us|abbr=on[/tpl] took some 500,000 to 900,000 Chinese lives, along with an unknown number of Japanese soldiers. The flood prevented the Japanese army from taking Zhengzhou, on the southern bank of the Yellow River, but did not stop them from reaching their goal of capturing Wuhan, which was the temporary seat of the Chinese government and straddles the Yangtze River.Lary, Diana.

==Geography==

According to the China Exploration and Research Society, the source of the Yellow River is at 34° 29' 31.1" N, 96° 20' 24.6" E in the Bayan Har Mountains near the eastern edge of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.  The source tributuaries drain into Gyaring Lake and Ngoring Lake on the western edge of Golog Prefecture high in the Bayan Har Mountains of Qinghai. In the Zoige Basin along the boundary with Gansu, the Yellow River loops northwest and then northeast before turning south, creating the "Ordos Loop", and then flows generally eastward across the North China Plain to the Gulf of Bohai, draining a basin of [tpl]convert|752443|km²|sp=us|0[/tpl] which nourishes 140 million people with drinking water and irrigation.
The Yellow River passes through seven present-day provinces and two autonomous regions, namely (from west to east) Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong. Major cities along the present course of the Yellow River include (from west to east) Lanzhou, Yinchuan, Wuhai, Baotou, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Jinan. The current mouth of the Yellow River is located at Kenli County, Shandong.
The river is commonly divided into three stages. These are roughly the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau, the Ordos Loop and the North China Plain. However, different scholars have different opinions on how the three stages are divided.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] This article adopts the division used by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission.Yellow River Conservancy Commission.

===Upper reaches===

The upper reaches of the Yellow River constitute a segment starting from its source in the Bayan Har Mountains and ending at Hekou Town (Togtoh County), Inner Mongolia just before it turns sharply to the south. This segment has a total length of [tpl]convert|3472|km|0|sp=us[/tpl] and total basin area of [tpl]convert|386000|km²|sp=us|sigfig=3[/tpl], 51.4% of the total basin area. Along this length, the elevation of the Yellow River drops [tpl]convert|3496|m|0|sp=us[/tpl], with an average grade of 0.10%.
The source section flows mainly through pastures, swamps, and knolls between the Bayan Har Mountains, and the Anemaqen (Amne Machin) Mountains. The river water is clear and flows steadily. Crystal clear lakes are characteristic of this section. The two main lakes along this section are Lake Zhaling ([tpl]lang|zh|扎陵湖[/tpl]) and Lake Eling ([tpl]lang|zh|鄂陵湖[/tpl]), with capacities of 4.7 billion and 10.8 billion m³ (166 and 381 billion ft3), respectively. At elevations over [tpl]convert|4290|m|sigfig=4|sp=us|abbr=on[/tpl]) above sea level they are the two largest plateau freshwater lakes nationwide.  A significant amount of land in the Yellow River's source area has been designated as the Sanjiangyuan ("'Three Rivers' Sources") National Nature Reserve, to protect the source region of the Yellow River, the Yangtze, and the Mekong.
The valley section stretches from Longyang Gorge in Qinghai to Qingtong Gorge in Gansu. Steep cliffs line both sides of the river. The water bed is narrow and the average drop is large, so the flow in this section is extremely turbulent and fast. There are 20 gorges in this section, the most famous of these being the Longyang, Jishi, Liujia, Bapan, and Qingtong gorges. The flow conditions in this section makes it the best location for hydroelectric plants.
After emerging from the Qingtong Gorge, the river comes into a section of vast alluvial plains, the Yinchuan Plain and Hetao Plain. In this section, the regions along the river are mostly deserts and grasslands, with very few tributaries. The flow is slow. The Hetao Plain has a length of [tpl]convert|900|km|-1|sp=us|abbr=on[/tpl] and width of [tpl]convert|30|to|50|km|mi|0|sp=us|abbr=on[/tpl]. It is historically the most important irrigation plain along the Yellow River.

===Middle reaches===

The part of the Yellow River (see Ordos Loop) between Hekou Town (Togtoh County), in Inner Mongolia and Zhengzhou, Henan constitutes the middle reaches of the river. The middle reaches are [tpl]convert|1206|km|0|sp=us|abbr=on[/tpl] long, with a basin area of [tpl]convert|344000|km²|sp=us|sigfig=3[/tpl], 45.7% of the total, with a total elevation drop of [tpl]convert|890|m|sigfig=3|sp=us|abbr=on[/tpl], an average drop of 0.074%. There are 30 large tributaries along the middle reaches, and the water flow is increased by 43.5% on this stage. The middle reaches contribute 92% of the river's silts.
The middle stream of the Yellow River passes through the Loess Plateau, where substantial erosion takes place. The large amount of mud and sand discharged into the river makes the Yellow River the most sediment-laden river in the world. The highest recorded annual level of silts discharged into the Yellow River is 3.91 billion tons in 1933. The highest silt concentration level was recorded in 1977 at 920 kg/m³ (57.4 lb/ft3). These sediments later deposit in the slower lower reaches of the river, elevating the river bed and creating the famous "river above ground".
From Hekou to Yumenkou, the river passes through the longest series of continuous valleys on its main course, collectively called the Jinshan Valley. The abundant hydrodynamic resources stored in this section make it the second most suitable area to build hydroelectric power plants. The famous Hukou Waterfall is in the lower part of this valley, on the border of Shanxi and Shaanxi.

===Lower reaches===

In the lower reaches, from Zhengzhou, Henan to its mouth, a distance of [tpl]convert|786|km|sp=us|abbr=on[/tpl], the river is confined to a levee-lined course as it flows to the northeast across the North China Plain before emptying into the Bohai Sea. The basin area in this stage is only [tpl]convert|23000|km²|sp=us[/tpl], a mere 3% of the total, because few tributaries add to the flow in this stage; nearly all rivers to the south drain into the Huai River, whereas those to the north drain into the Hai River. The total drop in elevation of the lower reaches is [tpl]convert|93.6|m|0|sp=us|abbr=on[/tpl], with an average grade of 0.012%.
The silts received from the middle reaches form sediments here, elevating the river bed. During 2,000 years of levee construction, excessive sediment deposits have raised the riverbed several meters above the surrounding ground.
At Kaifeng, Henan, the Yellow River is [tpl]convert|10|m|sp=us|0[/tpl] above the ground level.Yellow River: Geographic and Historical Settings

===Tributaries===

Tributaries of the Yellow River include (upstream to downstream (?))
The Wei River is the largest of these tributaries.

==Characteristics==

The Yellow River is notable for the large amount of silt it carries—1.6 billion tons annually at the point where it descends from the Loess Plateau. If it is running to the sea with sufficient volume, 1.4 billion tons are carried to the sea annually.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] One estimate gives 34 kilograms of silt per cubic meter as opposed to 10 for the Colorado and 1 for the Nile.Tregear, T.R. A Geography of China, p. 219. 1965
Its average discharge is said to be 2,110 cubic meters per second (32,000 for the Yangtze), with a maximum of 25,000 and minimum of 245. However, since 1972, it often runs dry before it reaches the sea. The low volume is due to increased agricultural irrigation, increased by a factor of five since 1950. Water diverted from the river as of 1999 served 140 million people and irrigated 74,000 km² (48,572 mi²) of land.China's Yellow River, Part 1. The New York Times The Yellow River delta totals 8,000 square kilometers (3,090 mi²). However, with the decrease in silt reaching the sea, it has been reported to be shrinking slightly each year since 1996 through erosion.Yellow River Delta Shrinking 7.6 Square Kilometers Annually, China Daily 1 February 2005
The highest volume occurs during the rainy season from July to October, when 60% of the annual volume of the river flows. Maximum demand for irrigation is needed between March and June. In order to capture excess water for use when needed and for flood control and electricity generation, several dams have been built, but their expected life is limited due to the high silt load. A proposed South–North Water Transfer Project involves several schemes to divert water from the Yangtze River: one in the western headwaters of the rivers where they are closest to one another, another from the upper reaches of the Han River, and a third using the route of the old Grand Canal.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
Due to its heavy load of silt the Yellow River is a depositing stream[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl]that is, it deposits part of its carried burden of soil in its bed in stretches where it is flowing slowly. These deposits elevate the riverbed which flows between natural levees in its lower reaches. Should a flood occur, the river may break out of the levees into the surrounding lower flood plain and take
a new channel. Historically this has occurred about once every hundred years. In modern times, considerable effort has been made to strengthen levees and control floods.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
