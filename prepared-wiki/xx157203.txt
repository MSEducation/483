Saint Romanus of Subiaco (died ca. 550 AD) was a hermit in the area around Subiaco, Italy.
He is remembered as having assisted and influenced Saint Benedict of Nursia, when the latter had just begun his life as a hermit.  Romanus provided Benedict with clothing (a religious habit), food, and housing (in the form of a cave above the river Anio, which Benedict lived in for 3 years) (St. Gregory the Great, Dialogi, II, i).   
Christian tradition states that Romanus departed Italy to escape the barbarian invasions.  He is credited with founding a small monastery at Dryes-Fontrouge in Auxerre, where he died.
He is sometimes identified with the Romanus of Auxerre who was venerated as Bishop of Auxerre on 8 October.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13163a.htm
