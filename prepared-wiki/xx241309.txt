[[Anthony McKinney murder conviction controversy]]

CATEGORIES: Legal ethics, American prisoners and detainees

Anthony McKinney was a prisoner accused of killing a security guard in 1978 in Harvey, Illinois. He was the subject of a Medill Innocence Project effort to reinvestigate his case and determine if he was wrongfully convicted. The case obtained notoriety after the Cook County state's attorney subpoenaed the Medill School of Journalism students' grades, class syllabus, and personal e-mails. This case is relevant to issues of Freedom of the Press because of the subpoena of journalism school class records as well as issues relating to possible wrongful conviction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-nu-subpoena-19-oct19,0,3778012.story|title=Northwestern University's Medill Innocence Project is in a standoff with Cook County prosecutors|last=Long|first=Jeff|date=19 Oct 2009|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2009-10-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091021090346/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-nu-subpoena-19-oct19,0,3778012.story| archivedate= 21 October 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/northwestern-students-grades-subpoenaed-state-murder-investigation/Story?id=8870809&page=1|title=Northwestern Students' Records Subpoenaed by Illinois State Attorney Office|last=Friedman|first=Emily|date=Oct 20, 2009|work=ABC News|accessdate=2009-10-20[/tpl]Contempt hearing in wrongful conviction case delayed, Medill Reports, Northwestern University, Jun 24, 2010, http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=166922&print=1Student journalists protection still unanswered: Arguments over subpoena continue in light of new evidence, McCormick Freedom Project, June 25, 2010, http://www.freedomproject.us/post-exchange/Article-Northwestern_student_journalists_protection_still_unanswered.aspxMUHAMMAD ALI BOUT COULD BE KEY TO CLEARING MAN OF MURDER THAT HE WAS CONVICTED OF 27 YEARS AGO, Chicago Sun Times, November 20, 2008, archived:http://www.law.northwestern.edu/news/article_full.cfm?eventid=4000
