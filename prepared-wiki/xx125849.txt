Bolesław Matuszewski (August 19,Parish records 1856 Pińczów, Congress Poland, Russian Empire – c.1943 or 1944;Prof. Czeczot-Gawrak's research in French texts Boleslas Matuszewski) was a Polish cameraman and employee of the Lumière company. In 1897, after assuming the position of photographer to Tsar Nicholas II,He never officially received the title of the Photographer of the Imperial Court - see his correspondence with the Ministry of the Court preserved at the State Archives in St. Petersburg and Krasnogorsk. he used the Lumières' Cinématographe to record the official visit to St. Petersburg, of the French President Félix Faure. After the visit, Otto von Bismarck accused Faure of not baring his head before the Russian flag on his disembarkation. However, this accusation was shown to be false based on Matuszewski's documentary.
Matuszewski wrote two of the earliest texts on cinema: Une nouvelle source de l'histoire (Paris, 1898) and La photographie animée (1898).  Une nouvelle source de l'histoire is recognized today as the first written work to consider the historical value of film and to suggest the importance of Film Archives.
