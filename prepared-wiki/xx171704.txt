The Bishops in Foreign Countries Act 1841 (5 Vict., c. 6) is an Act of Parliament passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom to enable the Church of England to create bishops overseas.

==Background==

The need for the act arose after the English Church and government agreed to consent to the establishment of the Anglican-German Bishopric in Jerusalem.Meyer (1914)

==The Act==

The Act authorised the consecration of a bishop for a foreign country who need not be a subject of the British crown nor take the oaths of allegiance or of supremacy, while, on the other hand, the clergy ordained by him would have no right to officiate in England or Ireland.
The Act received the Royal assent on 5 October 1841 and remains, [tpl]As of|2008|lc=on[/tpl], largely in force.
