Andrew Stevenson (January 21, 1784 â€“ January 25, 1857) was a Democratic politician in the United States. Educated at the College of William and Mary, he married three times. His second wife, Sarah (Sally) Coles, was a cousin of Dolley Madison and sister of Edward Coles, a governor of Illinois. Stevenson served as a Congressman from Virginia from 1821 to 1834 and was the Speaker of the House from 1827 until 1834. From 1836 to 1841 Stevenson served as American minister to the United Kingdom. He presided over the 1835 Democratic National Convention and the 1848 Democratic National Convention. From 1856 to 1857 he served as rector of the University of Virginia.
His term as Minister to the United Kingdom was marked by controversy: the abolitionist cause was growing in strength, and some  sections of public opinion resented the choice of  Stevenson, who was a slaveowner, for this role.Geoghegan, Patrick M.  Liberator- the Life and Death of Daniel O'Connell  Gill and Macmillan 2010 Dublin p.202  The Irish statesman Daniel O'Connell was reported to have denounced Stevenson in public as a slave breeder, generally thought to be a more serious matter than  simply being a slaveowner.Geoghegan pp.202-4 Stevenson, outraged, challenged O'Connell to a duel, but O'Connell, who had a lifelong aversion to dueling, refused, and suggested  that he had been misquoted. The controversy became public and the repeated references to slave breeding caused Stevenson a good deal of embarrassment: there was a widespread view that if O'Connell's charges were false Stevenson would have done better to simply ignore them rather than engaging in a public squabble.Geoghegan p.204
