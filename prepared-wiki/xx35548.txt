As a feature adjacent to the Helena River Valley it has significance in aboriginal folklore, and also featured very early on in early European settler's diaries.
Mountain Quarry, Western Australia is one of several blue stone quarries located within the park, popular with rock climbers and walkers. Vehicle access to the quarry site is restricted however a car-park and picnic facilities including toilets are within walking distance of the main site which is completely accessible on foot. There are several panels containing historical information about the site spread around as part of the popular Railway Reserves Heritage Trail which runs close to the quarry. 
The Boya/Koongamia leg of the Railway Reserves Heritage Trail, also known as the 'Bridle Trail', curves around the south-western edge of the park, crossing through the Mountain Quarry car-park and picnic area. 
In the early 2000s significant bushfire damage occurred on the southern slopes of this park. Large fire-breaks dissect the park serving as popular walking routes among locals.
The western and northern slopes, visible from Great Eastern Highway have extensive 'watsonia' infestations.
In late 2005, the Government Authority in charge of the national park was taking steps to prevent vehicular access along the top of the ridge to the lookout due to non stop vandalism and issues with residents adjacent to the park.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
The park is situated along the side of Greenmount Hill and has majestic views over the Swan Coastal Plain below and Perth City below. The dominant vegetation in the park is eucalypts such as Marri and Wandoo along with an array of wild flowers and heathland along the northern slopes.
