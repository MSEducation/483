The 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup was the 9th edition of the Cricket World Cup tournament that took place in the West Indies from 13 March to 28 April 2007, using the sport's One Day International format. There were a total of 51 matches played, three fewer than at the 2003 World Cup (despite a field larger by two teams).
The 16 competing teams were initially divided into four groups, with the two best-performing teams from each group moving on to a "Super 8" format. From this, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and South Africa won through to the semi-finals, with Australia defeating Sri Lanka in the final to win their third consecutive World Cup and their fourth overall. Australia's unbeaten record in the tournament increased their total to 29 consecutive World Cup matches without loss, a streak dating back to 23 May 1999, during the group stage of the 1999 World Cup. The tournament also saw upsets in the first round with tournament favourites India and Pakistan failing to making it past the group stage while Bangladesh, the lowest-ranked Test playing nation, and Ireland, an associate (non-test playing) nation, made it to the Super 8s.
Following the tournament the ICC distributed surplus tournament revenues of USD 239 million to its members.ICC Consolidated Financial Statements for the 9 months ended 31 December 2007, accounting note 12.

==Host selection==

The World Cup was awarded to the West Indies via the International Cricket Council's rotational policy. It is the first time the ICC Cricket World Cup has been held in the Caribbean despite the fact that the West Indies cricket team have been the second most successful team in past World Cups.In terms of number of wins, win percentage, and number of cups won. In fact, they were on top on all of these criteria from 1975 to 1987, and only in 2003 did Australia pass their number of cups won.
The United States contingent lobbied strongly for matches to be staged at its newly built cricket ground in Lauderhill, Florida, but the ICC decided to award all matches to Caribbean nations. Bids from Bermuda, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and a second bid by Jamaica were also rejected.
Eight venues across the West Indies were selected to host the World Cup tournament. All host countries hosted six matches with the exceptions of St Lucia, Jamaica and Barbados (the last of which hosted the final) which each hosted seven matches.
The Jamaican Government spent US$81 million for "on the pitch" expenses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20060831/news/news2.html|title=Robert Bryan, executive director, Jamaica 2007 Cricket Limited (from www.jamaica-gleaner.com)|accessdate=9 April 2007[/tpl] This included refurbishing Sabina Park and constructing the new multi-purpose facility in Trelawny – through a loan from China. Another US$20 million is budgeted for 'off-the-pitch' expenses, putting the tally at more than US$100 million or JM$7 billion.
This put the reconstruction cost of Sabina Park at US$46 million whilst the Trelawny Stadium will cost US$35 million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.caribbeancricket.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=2127|title=World Cup 2007: Eyes Wide Shut by Claude Robinson from www.caribbeancricket.com|accessdate=9 April 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sportsjamaica.com/read_article.php?id=5632|title= Cricket: 'Run wid it again!'|date=24 April 2006|accessdate=9 April 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070312042225/http://www.sportsjamaica.com/read_article.php?id=5632| archivedate= 12 March 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The total amount of money spent on stadiums was at least US$301 million.

==Qualification==

The field of sixteen teams, the largest ever for the Cricket World Cup, consists of all sixteen teams which currently hold One Day International status. This includes the ten full members of the ICC (which all have Test and permanent ODI status). The other six (associate) ODI nations are Kenya (which has ODI status until 2009) and five further teams which qualified via the 2005 ICC Trophy (gaining ODI status until 2009, in the process). These nations included Canada, Scotland, Netherlands and making their World Cup Debut Ireland and Bermuda.

==Squads==

There were sixteen teams in 2007 Cricket World Cup. The sixteen teams were asked to announce their final squads by 13 February 2007. Changes were allowed after this deadline at the discretion of the ICCs Technical Committee in necessary cases, such as due to player injury.

==Media coverage==

The World Cup has grown as a media event with each tournament. The sponsorship and television rights that were awarded primarily to cover the 2003 and 2007 World Cups raised over US$550 Million.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.charteredaccountants.com.au/charter/charter_archive/2003/june_2003/A117967146|title=Sponsorship revenue|accessdate=9 April 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070309152853/http://www.charteredaccountants.com.au/charter/charter_archive/2003/june_2003/A117967146| archivedate= 9 March 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The 2007 World Cup was televised in over 200 countries to a viewing audience estimated at more than two billion television viewers and was expected to generate more than 100,000 unique visitors to the West Indies who travelled solely for the tournament.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2007/03/11/2003351858|title=Taipai Times Editorial|accessdate=18 April 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070323121830/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2007/03/11/2003351858| archivedate= 23 March 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricketworldcup.com/icc-marketing.html|work=cricketworldcp.com|title=World Cup Overview|accessdate=29 January 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070124001408/http://www.cricketworldcup.com/icc-marketing.html| archivedate= 24 January 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

It has been announced during matches that Mello has no race, species, age or gender- it is an attitude, the attitude of the young people of the West Indies. The official song for the World Cup was "The Game of Love and Unity" by Jamaican-born Shaggy, Bajan entertainer Rupee and Trinidadian Fay-Ann Lyons.

==Leadup==

All major Test-playing nations had schedules allowing them to play a large number of One Day International against other major ODI teams just prior to the World Cup. Australia, New Zealand and England took part in the Commonwealth Bank Series where England defeated Australia in the finals. Australia then went to New Zealand for the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy, losing 3–0. South Africa played five ODIs against India (South Africa won 4–0) and five against Pakistan (South Africa won 3–1) while India also played four ODIs against the West Indies (India won 3–1) and four ODIs against Sri Lanka (India won 2–1). Bangladesh played four ODIs against Zimbabwe (Bangladesh won 3–1) and won a tri-series against Canada and Bermuda. The associate ODI teams took part in the World Cricket League, which Kenya won, and were also involved in other series prior to the World Cup.
The rankings of the teams at the beginning of the Cricket World Cup were:

===Warm-up matches===

Prior to the main tournament all 16 nations played a series of warm-up matches to prepare, experiment with different tactics and to help them get acclimatised to conditions in the West Indies. The warm-up matches were not considered as official ODIs.[tpl]cite web|last=long|first=Jon|title=ICC Cricket World Cup 2007 match schedule announced|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc-cwc/content/story/213796.html|publisher=International Cricket Council[tpl]![/tpl]ICC|accessdate=9 April 2007|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070416033529/http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc-cwc/content/story/213796.html|archivedate=16 April 2007|date=19 July 2005[/tpl] The matches were played from Monday 5 March until Friday 9 March. The matches included a surprise victory by Bangladesh over New Zealand.

===Opening ceremony===

The ICC Cricket World Cup 2007 Opening Ceremony was held on Sunday, 11 March 2007, at Trelawny Stadium in  Jamaica.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.indianmuslims.info/news/2007/march/11/sports/all_set_for_grand_opening_of_crickets_biggest_showpiece.html |title=All set for grand opening of cricket's biggest showpiece |publisher=Indianmuslims.info |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16[/tpl]
It featured over 2000 dancers and performers representing all strands of West Indian music, from calypso and ragga to reggae and soca; among the performers were Sean Paul, Byron Lee, Kevin Lyttle, Beres Hammond, Lucky Dube, Buju Banton, Half Pint, Arrow, Machel Montano, Alison Hinds, Tony Rebel, Third World, Gregory Isaacs, David Rudder, Shaggy, the I Threes and Jimmy Cliff.
The ceremony, attended by several heads of state including the Governor-General of Jamaica started with an address by Sir Garfield Sobers; there were messages from the Prime Ministers of Jamaica and Grenada.

==Rules and regulations==

===Matches===

The matches were One Day Internationals and operated under normal ODI rules. All matches were to be 50 overs a side unless stated otherwise by the umpires or match referee. A bowler was able to bowl a maximum of 10 overs per match.
In the event of bad weather, each side must have batted a minimum of 20 overs for a result to be declared (if the match was not otherwise won, for example if the team batting second was dismissed before the completion of 20 overs). In the event of bad weather, the Duckworth-Lewis method was applied to determine the result or target. If no result was declared on the scheduled day, the teams returned the next day to complete the game, with the same situation as when the game was abandoned.
There was a new rule regarding referral of catches to the TV replay official (third umpire): if the standing umpires were unable to determine whether a catch had been taken cleanly, and/or whether a claimed catch was a "bump ball", they had discretion to refer the decision to the third umpire. Also, whilst reviewing such a catch via TV replay if it was clear to the third umpire that the batsman did not hit the ball, he was to indicate that the batsman was not out.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc/rules/wc07_playing_conditions.pdf|title=ICC Cricket World Cup 2007 Playing Conditions|accessdate=27 February 2007|format=PDF|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070226180703/http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc/rules/wc07_playing_conditions.pdf|archivedate=26 February 2007[/tpl]

===Tournament points===

In the Group Stage and in the Super 8 Stage points were awarded as follows:
The top two teams from each group advanced to the Super 8 stage and any points they earned against the other qualifier from their own group was carried through. Points earned against the non-qualifying teams in the same pool were not carried over. In the Super 8s, each team played the six remaining qualifiers from the other groups and the top four teams went through to the semi-finals. Positions were decided by most points. Where two or more teams were tied on points, the following methods in turn were used to decide which team went through:

==Umpires==

The umpiring panel for the 2007 Cricket World Cup comprised nine umpires from the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires (the only member not included was Darrell Hair), and nine umpires from the international panel. The refereeing panel consisted of seven members from the Elite Panel of ICC Referees, with Clive Lloyd not being included due to his role as West Indies' team manager. Aleem Dar went on to stand as an umpire in his first World Cup final, alongside Steve Bucknor who was appearing in his fifth final in a row – extending his record of four from the 2003 World Cup.

==Groups==

===Seeds===

The tournament began with a league stage consisting of four groups of four. Each team played each of the other teams in its group once. Australia, India, England and West Indies were placed in separate pools for logistical reasons, as they were expected to have the most supporters in attendance, and transport and accommodation capacity in the West Indies is limited.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/world/icc-table-provides-basis,3325,EN.html|title=World Cup seedings plan announced|accessdate=9 April 2007[/tpl]
The groups are listed below, with seedings (rankings from April 2005) shown in brackets. Each group played all of its matches at a single ground.

===System===

The tournament was preceded by a number of warm-up matches to acclimatise the players. The group stage matches started on Tuesday 13 March and finished on Sunday 25 March. There were a total of 24 matches played in the group stage.
The top two teams in each group proceeded to the "Super 8" stage which also used a league system. Each team carried forward its result against the other team qualifying from its preliminary stage group, and played the other six qualifying teams once each. The top four teams in the league qualified for the semi-finals. This system was modified since the previous World Cup, which had a "Super 6" stage rather than a Super 8. The Super 8 stage matches were played from Tuesday 27 March until Saturday 21 April. A total of 24 matches were played in the Super 8 stage.
The top four teams in the "Super 8" advanced to the semi-finals. This was the knockout stage, with the No. 1 team playing the No. 4 team, and the No. 2 team playing the No. 3 team in the tournament. The winners of the two semi-finals played each other in the Final.
All tournament matches have one reserve day (the day after the scheduled day of the match) to allow for matches to be completed in the event of bad weather.

==Group stage==

===Group A===

===Group B===

===Group C===

===Group D===

==Super 8 stage==

The top two teams in each first-round group moved on to a "super eight" stage which is scored as a complete round-robin. But each of the eight teams played only six new matches, rather than seven— each group's two representatives carried forward their result against each other rather than play again. Thus the table below, showing seven matches for each team, covers all matches between the Super 8 qualifiers, including those from the Group Stage.
Teams depicted in green backgrounds qualified for the semi-finals.

==Knockout stage==

===Final===

This was the first World Cup final to be a repeat – the sides previously met in the 1996 World Cup final, which Sri Lanka won. Australia had won every World Cup match against Sri Lanka apart from that loss.[tpl]cite web|url=http://uk.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/STATS/BY_OPPONENT/AUS-SL/WC/AUS-SL_ODI_SERIES_SUMMARY.html|title=Australia v Sri Lanka: World Cup Series Summary|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=28 April 2007[/tpl] The match was Sri Lanka's second World Cup final appearance and Australia's sixth, their fourth in a row.
Ricky Ponting won the toss and elected to bat. However, the start of play was delayed due to rain, and the match was reduced to 38 overs per side. Adam Gilchrist played an incredible innings of 149 – the highest for any batsman in a World Cup final – to give Australia an imposing total going in at the break.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/292681.html|title=Gilchrist leads Australia to World Cup treble|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=6 May 2007[/tpl]
While Sri Lankan batsmen Kumar Sangakkara and Sanath Jayasuriya were adding 116 for the second wicket, the contest was alive, but after the pair got out, Sri Lanka's chances slowly washed away. Further rain forced the reduction of Sri Lanka's innings to just 36 overs, with the target revised to 269.  At the end of the 33rd over, with Sri Lanka still trailing the adjusted Duckworth-Lewis target by 37 runs, the umpires suspended the game due to bad light.  While Australia's players began to celebrate their victory (since the minimum 20 overs had been reached), the umpires incorrectly announced that because the match was suspended due to light and not rain, the final three overs would have to be bowled the following day. With Sri Lanka needing 61 runs from 18 deliveries, Mahela Jayawardene agreed there was no need to return the following day, and instructed his team to resume batting, with Ricky Ponting agreeing to play only spinners. The umpires later apologised for their error: the match should have ended then with Australia winning by 37 runs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/292771.html|title=World Cup Referee apologize|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=30 April 2007[/tpl] The last three overs were played in almost complete darkness, during which Sri Lanka added nine runs, giving Australia a 53-run victory by the D-L method, as Sri Lanka had batted two overs fewer than they had.[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wc2007/engine/current/match/247507.html|title=World Cup final scorecard|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=30 April 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070430003511/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/wc2007/engine/current/match/247507.html| archivedate= 30 April 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
