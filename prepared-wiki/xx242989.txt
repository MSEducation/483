===Klueless===

Klueless is the annual online puzzle (or Online Treasure Hunt as it is popularly known as) which was launched in October 2005 by students of IIM Indore as an event during the annual management summit Ahvan of IIM Indore. It now ranks itself amongst the most popular Indian puzzles of its kind, with enthusiasts from over 1100 cities in over 80 countries logging in to play the game every year, being the first of its kind in India. The game has seen its player base grow over the years to nearly 3 million hits in the previous edition alone, and usually registers over a million hits within 3-4 days of commencement. Modeled on the lines of the popular Notpron, which has also been tagged as "The Hardest Riddle on the Internet", this game too follows a linear format where players are required to solve each level by using hints in different parts of the page - the URL, the Source Code, the page title, image names and the images themselves. Off late though, it has also brought in the concept of non-linearity, thus making it closer to a real-life treasure hunt. The players who solve a level get to progress on to the next level and on eventual completion of the game, get to the Kluless Hall of Fame. 
The game differentiates itself from most other by having a fresh edition every year, with an altogether new set of puzzles. Each year, the game's developers, work towards creating an entirely different set of 30 to 40 quizzical levels, making a conscious effort to avoid repetition of similar levels over the editions. Now in its 9th year running, the themes for different levels range over a broad spectrum of topics, from popular comic book and movie references, to mathematical and advanced computing concepts. 
Launched around the month of October each year, quizzers and puzzle fanatics from all across the world spend close to 3 entire days trying to crack the game and enter the game's Hall of Fame. With the number of spots in this Hall of Fame varying across years, the objective for most players is not only to solve the levels by hook or by crook, but is also to do it the fastest, which makes the game highly competitive.
