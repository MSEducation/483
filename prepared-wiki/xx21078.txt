[[Einkorn wheat]]

CATEGORIES: Wheat, Plants described in 1753

Einkorn wheat (from German Einkorn, literally "single grain") can refer either to the wild species of wheat, Triticum boeoticum, or to the domesticated form, Triticum monococcum. The wild and domesticated forms are either considered separate species, as here, or as subspecies of T. monococcum. Einkorn is a diploid species of hulled wheat, with tough glumes ('husks') that tightly enclose the grains. The cultivated form is similar to the wild, except that the ear stays intact when ripe and the seeds are larger. 

==History==

Einkorn wheat is one of the earliest cultivated forms of wheat, alongside emmer wheat (T. dicoccum). Grains of wild einkorn have been found in Epi-Paleolithic sites of the Fertile Crescent. It was first domesticated approximately 7500 BC (7050 BC ≈ 9000 BP), in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) or B (PPNB) periods.[tpl]cite book | author = Hopf, M.; Zohary, D. | title = Domestication of Plants in the Old World: The Origin and Spread of Cultivated Plants in West Asia, Europe, and the Nile Valley | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford, Oxfordshire | year = 2000 | page = 38 | isbn = 0-19-850356-3 | edition = 3rd [/tpl]  Evidence from DNA finger-printing suggests einkorn was domesticated near Karaca Dağ in southeast Turkey, an area in which a number of PPNB farming villages have been found.[tpl] cite journal | author = Heun, M.; Schäfer-Pregl, R.; Klawan, D.; Castagna, R.; Accerbi, M.; Borghi, B.; Salamini, F. | title = Site of Einkorn Wheat Domestication Identified by DNA Fingerprinting | year = 1997 | journal = Science | volume = 278 | issue = 5341 | pages = 1312–1314 | doi = 10.1126/science.278.5341.1312 [/tpl]  Its cultivation decreased in the Bronze Age, and today it is a relict crop that is rarely planted, though it has found a new market as a health food. It remains as a local crop, often for bulgur (cracked wheat) or as animal feed, in mountainous areas of France, Morocco, the former Yugoslavia, Turkey and other countries. It often survives on poor soils where other species of wheat fail.Zohary and Hopf, Domestication, pp. 33f

==Gluten toxicity==

In contrast with more modern forms of wheat, evidence suggests the gliadin protein of einkorn may not be as toxic to sufferers of coeliac disease.[tpl] cite journal | last1 = Pizzuti | first1 = D. | last2 = Buda | first2 = A. | last3 = d'Odorico | first3 = A. | last4 = d'Incà | first4 = R. | last5 = Chiarelli | first5 = S. | last6 = Curioni | first6 = A. | last7 = Martines | first7 = D. | title = Lack of intestinal mucosal toxicity of Triticum monococcum in celiac disease patients | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology | year = 2006 | volume = 41 | issue = 11 | pages = 1305–1311 | doi = 10.1080/00365520600699983 | pmid = 17060124 [/tpl]  It has yet to be recommended in any gluten-free diet.

==Salt-tolerance gene==

Australian scientists have succeeded in breeding the salt-tolerance feature of T. monococcum into durum wheat.[tpl] cite news | url = http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/03/120311150717.htm?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily+%28ScienceDaily%3A+Latest+Science+News%29&utm_content=Google+Reader | title = World Breakthrough On Salt-Tolerant Wheat | newspaper = ScienceDaily | date = March 11, 2012 [/tpl]
