Kadboli or kadaboli (Konkani and [tpl]lang-mr|कडबोळी[/tpl]), is a traditional savoury snack prepared in Maharashtra. Kadboli is typically made from a mixture of chickpea, urad, moong and rice flour, salt, and flavourings such as chili, ajwain, or cumin. 
The same dish is known as kodbale in Karnataka, the only difference being that only rice and urad flour is used.
