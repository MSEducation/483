[[Chymotrypsinogen]]

CATEGORIES: Enzymes

Chymotrypsinogen is a proteolytic enzyme Schwert G.W, Proteolytic Enzymes. Annual Review of Biochemistry. online 1955, 10.1146/annurev.bi.24.070155.000503 http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.bi.24.070155.000503?journalCode=biochem (accessed Oct 10, 2012) is a precursor (zymogen) of the digestive enzyme chymotrypsin. It is a single polypetide chain consisting of 245 amino acid residues. It is synthesized in the acinar cells of the pancreas and stored inside membrane-bounded granules at the apex of the acinar cell. The cell is then stimulated by either a hormonal signal or a nerve impulse and the contents of the granules spill into a duct leading into the duodenum.Berg.M.J.,Tymoczko.L.J.,Stryer.L., Gatto Jr. J.G.

==Activation==

Chymotrypsinogen must be inactive until it gets to the digestive tract. This prevents damage to the pancreas or an other organs. It is activated into its active form by another enzyme called trypsin. This active form is called π-Chymotrypsin and is used to create α-Chymotrypsin. The trypsin cleaves the chymotrypsinogen at the arginine and isoleucine peptide bond. This creates two π-chymotrypsin molecules. One of the π-chymotrypsin acts on the other by breaking a leucine and serine peptide bond. This reaction yields the α-chymotrypsin. Dryer.J.W.,Neurath.H.
