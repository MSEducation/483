Spectacular jeep tracks on the north side of the massif lead to the Chalet de Cortalets (at 2150 m.) which is a popular outpost for walkers.
There are two ancient monasteries at the foot of the mountain, Martin-du-Canigou and Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa.

People keep a vigil during the night and take torches lit on that fire in a spectacular torch relay to light bonfires somewhere else.Vermut a la rebuda de la Flama del Canigó Some estimates conclude that about 30,000 bonfires are lit in this way all over Catalonia on that night.Festes - l'espai on comença la festa
