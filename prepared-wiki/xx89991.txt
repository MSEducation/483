==Plot==

Celeste (Kim Basinger) is an alien sent on a secret mission to Earth and Steven Mills (Dan Aykroyd) is a widowed scientist who is working on different ways to send radio waves into deep space. An accident causes a disruption of gravity on Celeste's home world (Cosine N to the 8th). She's sent to investigate who could affect gravity and how it was done, believing it was an attack. She's aided by an alien device resembling a tentacle with an eye, which hides in a designer purse to aid Celeste with her encounters on Earth. The Bag is able to create any object, such as diamonds and designer dresses almost instantaneously. Celeste crashes a party hosted by Steven's brother Ron (Jon Lovitz) where she immediately draws attention to herself by making dated references to old TV shows and political slogans under the mistaken belief that it was current (her superiors had just collected the information, which had taken 92 years to get from Earth to her home world). 
Celeste's inexperience almost results in her exposing herself as alien when she struggles with simple tasks like trying to kiss for the first time or cooking. Jessie Mills (Alyson Hannigan), Steven's 13 year old daughter, notices Celeste's strange habits, like eating car batteries and pulling hard boiled eggs out of boiling hot water with her bare hands and becomes suspicious of her.  However, she can't convince her smitten father that there is something unusual about Celeste.  Ron also has his doubts about Celeste, but more on the basis that he feels his brother is doing too much too soon by asking to marry Celeste only a few days after they first met. Ron tries to dissuade Steven from marrying Celeste on the idea she is an illegal immigrant or planning economic espionage, but then admits he is jealous his brother found his dream girl whereas he will never find a girl like Princess St√©phanie of Monaco. 
Celeste encounters a lot of new experiences such as sneezing, sexual intercourse and love.  When finally confronted about being an extraterrestrial by Jessie, Celeste admits her home world is without emotion. Celeste plans to depart once she discovers the truth, but is put in a quandary by Jessie, who says it will devastate her father, whom Celeste has now developed feelings for. After Jessie argues with her dad, she runs away and is nearly hit by a car, but is saved by Celeste's powers. This reveals to Steven that Celeste is indeed an alien and that she has fallen in love with him as well as accepting Jessie as her own daughter. When the leaders of Celeste's home world report in they ask her to destroy the planet Earth until she and Steven manage to convince them it was not an act of aggression, but an accident. They accept the explanation on the basis that gravity is returning to normal on their planet and give their blessing for Celeste to be with Steven. Initially, however, they demand that Celeste return to explain human culture to them but settle for a native of Earth to serve as ambassador to their world as a token of goodwill. The ambassadorship is accepted by Ron, who departs for Celeste's world in a spaceship served by several flight attendants, all of whom look like Princess Stephanie.
