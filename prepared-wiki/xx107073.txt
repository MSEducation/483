Altruism in animals describes a range of behaviours performed by animals that may be to their own disadvantage but which benefit others.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/altruism|title=Altruism|  publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=July 20, 2013[/tpl]  Other definitions place emphasis on the genetic consequences of altruism, e.g. altruism is "Instinctive behavior that is detrimental to the individual but favors the survival or spread of that individual's genes, as by benefiting its relatives."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/altruism|title=Altruism|publisher=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=July 20, 2013[/tpl] or the biological fitness of the animals, e.g. "Altruism refers to behavior by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reference.com/browse/altruism|title=Altruism|publisher=Reference.com|accessdate=July 20, 2013[/tpl] Altruism appears most obviously in kin relationships but may also be evident amongst wider social groups.
Altruism in animals is not identical to the everyday concept of altruism in humans. In humans, an action would only be called "altruistic" if it was done with the conscious intention of helping another. But in the animal behaviour sense there is no such requirement. Indeed, some of the most interesting examples of altruism in animals are found among species that are presumably not capable of conscious thought, e.g. insects. For the animal biologist, it is the consequences of an action for reproductive fitness that determine whether the action counts as altruistic, not the intentions, if any, with which the action is performed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/|title=Biological altruism|author=Okasha, S.|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2008|accessdate=July 20, 2013[/tpl]

==Overview==

In the science of ethology (the study of behavior), and more generally in the study of social evolution, on occasion, some animals do behave in ways that reduce their individual fitness but increase the fitness of other individuals in the population; this is a functional definition of altruism. Research in evolutionary theory has been applied to social behaviour, including altruism. Cases of animals helping individuals to whom they are closely related can be explained by kin selection, and are not considered true altruism. Beyond the physical exertions that in some species mothers and in some species fathers undertake to protect their young, extreme examples of sacrifice may occur. One example is matriphagy (the consumption of the mother by her offspring) in the spider Stegodyphus; another example is a male spider allowing a female fertilized by him to eat him. Hamilton's rule describes the benefit of such altruism in terms of Wright's coefficient of relationship to the beneficiary and the benefit granted to the beneficiary minus the cost to the sacrificer. Should this sum be greater than zero a fitness gain will result from the sacrifice.
When apparent altruism is not between kin, it may be based on reciprocity. A monkey will present its back to another monkey, who will pick out parasites; after a time the roles will be reversed. Such reciprocity will pay off, in evolutionary terms, as long as the costs of helping are less than the benefits of being helped and as long as animals will not gain in the long run by "cheating" – that is to say, by receiving favours without returning them. This is elaborated on in evolutionary game theory and specifically the prisoner's dilemma as social theory.

==Implications in evolutionary theory==

The existence of altruism in nature is at first sight puzzling. The theory of natural selection proposed by Charles Darwin leads us to expect animals to behave in ways that increase their own chances of survival and reproduction, not those of others. But by behaving altruistically, an animal reduces its own fitness, so should be at a selective disadvantage. Researchers on alleged altruistic behaviours among animals have been ideologically opposed to the social Darwinist concept of the "survival of the fittest", under the name of "survival of the nicest" — the latter being globally compatible, however, with the theory of evolution by natural selection. Insistence on such cooperative behaviours between animals was first exposed by the Russian zoologist and anarchist Peter Kropotkin in his 1902 book, Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution.
The idea that group selection might explain the evolution of altruism was first broached by Darwin himself in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, (1871). The concept of group selection has a chequered and controversial history in evolutionary biology but the uncritical ‘good of the species’ tradition came to an abrupt halt in the 1960s, due largely to the work of George C. Williams and John Maynard Smith.  In the 1960s and 1970s the rival theory of kin selection emerged, due originally to W. D. Hamilton.Hamilton, W.D., (1964).  The genetical evolution of social behaviour, I and II.

This theory showed how altruistic behaviour could evolve without the need for group-level selection, and quickly gained prominence among biologists interested in the evolution of social behaviour.
Recent developments in game theory have provided some explanations for apparent altruism, as have traditional evolutionary analyses. Among the proposed mechanisms are:
