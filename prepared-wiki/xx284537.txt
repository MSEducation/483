==Development==

On 12 June 2013, developer Rovio Entertainment posted a teaser trailer website showing the Red Bird speeding into the distance after a "Ready, Set, Go" countdown. The teaser fueled speculation by journalists and fans that the game would be either a racing game or an endless running game.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.techspot.com/news/52887-angry-birds-go-set-to-race-onto-the-scene-by-years-end.html|title=Angry Birds Go! set to race onto the scene by year's end|last=Knight|first=Shawn|date=13 June 2013|work=TechSpot|accessdate=11 August 2013|quote=based on the very brief teaser trailer, it could either be a Temple Run-type game or perhaps a racing title.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://tech2.in.com/news/web-apps/rovios-angry-birds-go-teaser-shows-new-twist-to-an-old-favourite/876456|title=Rovio's Angry Birds Go! teaser shows new twist to an old favourite|last=Majumdar|first=Anujeet|date=13 June 2013|work=Tech2.in.com|accessdate=11 August 2013|quote=An animated trailer that the company has released shows the possibility of the newest installation being some sort of a racing game.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2013/jun/12/angry-birds-go|title=Angry Birds Go! set to open new chapter for Rovio's Angry Birds|last=Dredge|first=Stuart|date=12 June 2013|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 August 2013|quote=Angry Birds Go! may be an endless runner, judging by its teaser website[/tpl]
Angry Birds Go was one of the first apps ever released simultaneously on the four major smartphone platforms: iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry 10.[tpl]cite web|author=Stuart Dredge |url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/11/angry-birds-go-review |title=Angry Birds Go! â€“ review | Technology |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2013-11-05 |accessdate=2013-12-11[/tpl]
This app supports Rovio accounts so players can sync progress between different devices on the same operating system.

==Chapters==

Each chapter of Angry Birds Go focuses on a separate course with 1,2 or 3 stages that each feature a competitor to race against in Champion Chase.  
Note: Seedway is currently the only chapter with 2 stages as the first stage (for Red) cannot be replayed and Sub Zero's two additional stages will be released later in 2014. Sub Zero has one stage. 

==Race Types==

Each of the game's courses has five types of races. Sub Zero has champion chase replaced with slalom.
For Race, Time Boom and Fruit Splat races, these can only be played for five rounds with increase in difficulty until all five rounds each are completed, and then players can complete challenges. All race types except "Versus" has a CC (earned from getting upgrades) limit before you can unlock the race type each time.  
In addition, there is a Jenga mode unlocked either by entering a code from the Angry Birds Jenga toy or with an in-app purchase; this has the racer going down a ramp to smash into blocks and pigs.

==Telepods==

Telepods allows you to summon a specific kart, but not the specific racer shown on the toy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/andyrobertson/2013/12/06/reivew-angry-birds-go/ |title=Review: Angry Birds Go! Toys Extend Telepod's Form and Function |publisher=Forbes |date=2013-11-25 |accessdate=2013-12-16[/tpl] The summoned kart works in "Stunt", the fourth course. If you haven't unlocked the course yet through gameplay, you can only play the Versus mode. When using Telepods, to summon the specific kart, it is necessary to scan the QR code each time after the app is fully closed.
The Sub Zero episode works with the second set of snow-themed Telepods that can be used on that episode.
Reds super roaster,
Stellas soda pop sedan,
Bombs big bang (normal/special edition,)

Kings pigs royal rumbler,

==Multiplayer==

Rovio announced on December 13, 2013 that the multiplayer feature will be included in the upcoming Spring 2014 update.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Angry+Birds+Go!/news.asp?c=56032 |title=Rovio will update Angry Birds Go! with multiplayer in spring 2014 |publisher=Pocket Gamer |date=2013-12-13 |accessdate=2013-12-16[/tpl]

==Reception==

The game has received mixed reviews, with a Metacritic score of 60% based on 22 reviews.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/angry-birds-go! |title=Angry Birds Go! for iPhone/iPad Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=2013-12-30[/tpl] The Guardian liked the gameplay and was not overly bothered by the in-app purchases.
Tech2 did not like the energy system, which only allows you to play five races with a bird, after which they are locked unless you wait or unlock with crystals (which are slowly earned in-game or with an in-app purchase) and did not like the vehicle upgrade process using in-game currency that is slowly earned by racing or with an in-app purchase for coins.[tpl]cite web|author=Shunal Doke |url=http://tech2.in.com/news/gaming/angry-birds-gos-inapp-purchases-cost-as-much-as-a-budget-smartphone/921798 |title=Angry Birds Go's in-app purchases cost as much as a budget smartphone |publisher=Tech2.in.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02[/tpl]
