[[Yankees–Red Sox rivalry]]

CATEGORIES: Boston Red Sox, Major League Baseball rivalries, New York Yankees

The Yankees–Red Sox rivalry is a sports rivalry between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox baseball teams of Major League Baseball (MLB). The two teams have competed in MLB's American League (AL) for over 100 years and have since developed one of the fiercest rivalries in sports.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=21[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=78[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Sport's ultimate rivalry; Yanks-Red Sox epic battles go way back|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/playoffs/2004-10-20-yanks-sox-rivalry_x.htm|date=October 21, 2004|accessdate=January 26, 2011|first=Hal|last=Bodley|newspaper=USA Today|page=3C[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/playoffs/2004-10-11-cover-rivalry_x.htm|title=Here they go again...; Red Sox vs. Yankees: Bitter enemies clash with Series on line|date=October 12, 2004|accessdate=January 27, 2011|first=Mike|last=Dodd|newspaper=USA Today|page=1C[/tpl] In 1919, Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold star player Babe Ruth to the Yankees, which was followed by an 86-year period in which the Red Sox did not win a World Series. This led to the popularization of a superstition known as the "Curse of the Bambino", which was one of the most well-known aspects of the rivalry.
The rivalry is often a heated subject of conversation, especially in the home region of both teams, the Northeastern United States.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=19[/tpl] Since the inception of the wild card format and the resultant additional Division Series, every season's postseason has featured one or both of the AL East rivals; they have faced each other in the AL Championship Series three times. The Yankees won twice, in 1999 and 2003; while the Sox won in 2004.[tpl]cite news|title=A World Series ticket; Sox complete comeback, oust Yankees for AL title|date=October 21, 2004|first=Dan|last=Shaughnessy|newspaper=The Boston Globe|page=A1|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2004/10/21/a_world_series_party/?page=full[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=They Love to Hate Each Other; Red Sox and Yankees carry bitter rivalry into championship series that starts tonight|date=October 12, 2004|first=Mike|last=DiGiovanna|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=D1[/tpl] In addition, the teams have twice met in the last regular-season series of a season to decide the league title, in [tpl]mlby|1904[/tpl] (when the Red Sox won) and [tpl]mlby|1949[/tpl] (when the Yankees won).

==Background==

Since before the start of the American Revolution, Boston and New York have shared an intense rivalry as cities.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=22[/tpl] For more than a century after its founding, Boston was arguably the educational, cultural, artistic, and economic power in the United States. Boston's location as the closest American port to Europe and its concentration of elite schools and manufacturing hubs helped maintain this position for several decades. During this time period, New York was often looked down upon as the upstart, over-populated, dirty cousin to aristocratic and clean Boston.
In the 19th century, however, New York's economic power soon outpaced Boston's, fueled by possession of the terminus of the Erie Canal, which spurred massive growth in the manufacturing, shipping, insurance and financial services businesses. Another factor was its more rapid population expansion in comparison to Boston, driven by the growth of these industries, by New York's popularity as an immigration port of entry, and enhanced by a larger population base to begin with, even prior to the construction of the Canal – on the eve of the Revolution, New York, with 30,000 people, had nearly twice the population of Boston, with about 16,000. By the start of the 20th century the original dynamic, centered on Boston, had completely shifted as New York became the focus of American capitalism (especially on Wall Street); this change was reflected in the new national pastime.

==Early history: Glory of the Red Sox==

The Red Sox were one of the most successful teams in baseball from 1901 to 1918.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=23[/tpl] They won the inaugural World Series in [tpl]wsy|1903[/tpl] (as the Boston Americans; the team changed its name to Red Sox in 1908) and four more between 1912 and 1918.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|pp=23–28[/tpl] In 1901, the Yankees, then known as the Baltimore Orioles, played in Maryland for two seasons before moving north. The two teams had their first meeting while the Yankees franchise was in Baltimore on April 26, 1901, the inaugural year of the American League.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=2[/tpl] On May 7, 1903, both teams played for the first time after the franchise moved to New York and became the Highlanders, in reference to playing games in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. The game was marked by a fight when Boston pitcher George Winter was knocked down.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=155[/tpl] Boston would eventually go on to win the pennant and the inaugural 1903 World Series. The 1904 season featured the teams facing each other on opening day. Later in the season, the Highlanders, led by pitcher Jack Chesbro in his record-setting 41 game-winning season, met the Boston Americans in the season's final game to decide the American League pennant winner. Chesbro threw a wild pitch in the top of the ninth inning, allowing the winning run to score from third base, and Boston won the game, and the pennant.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|pp=2, 155–156[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i_NPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=11QDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2796,3711817|title=Jack Chesbro, Pioneer of Spitball Hurlers and Ace on Old New York Highlanders, Dies of Heart Attack|newspaper=The Evening Independent|date=November 7, 1931|accessdate=November 25, 2011[/tpl] However, the New York Giants, who had already clinched the National League pennant,[tpl]cite news|title=Going, Going...Gone In a Way, It's 1904 All Over|last=Dufresne|first=Chris|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=September 15, 1994|page=C1[/tpl] refused to play in the 1904 World Series because of a perception of the "Junior Circuit" as being inferior (and because of alleged animosity between American League founder and first president, Ban Johnson, and the hierarchy of the Giants, owner John T. Brush and his team's Hall of Fame coach, player-manager John McGraw); thus, there was no World Series that year.[tpl]cite news|title=Feud killed 1904 World Series|last=Antonen|first=Mel|newspaper=USA Today|date=September 15, 1994|page=4C|quote=The '04 World Series never happened because John T. Brush, owner of the New York Giants, and his manager, John McGraw, despised AL President Ben Johnson.[/tpl] Not until 2004 would the Red Sox again defeat the Yankees in a title-deciding game.[tpl]harvnb|Vaccaro|2005|pp=71, 340–345[/tpl]
Years later, on April 11, 1912, the Highlanders debuted their pinstripes in a game against Boston, by then known as the Red Sox.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120410&content_id=28329362&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb|title=100 years ago, Yankees pinstripes are born|first=Bobbie|last=Dittmeier|work=MLB.com|date=April 10, 2012|accessdate=April 11, 2012|publisher=Major League Baseball[/tpl] Nine days later, Boston opened Fenway Park with a game against the Highlanders, who had left their home field of Hilltop Park to play in the newly-rebuilt Polo Grounds; soon thereafter, in 1913, the team changed dropped the nickname Highlanders in favor of Yankees.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=156[/tpl] Tris Speaker hit an RBI single in the bottom of the eleventh to give the Red Sox a 7–6 victory. Boston's victory in their first game at the new park failed to become front page news, however, due to the coverage being devoted to the days-prior sinking of the Titanic.[tpl]cite news|quote=The ballpark's grand opening on April 20, 1912, did not even make Boston's front pages. The ocean liner Titanic's tragic sinking on its maiden voyage a few days earlier still ruled the news.|title=Fenway Park celebrates 75th season|first=Charles|last=Goldsmith|agency=United Press International|newspaper=Ottawa Citizen|date=April 17, 1986|page=C7[/tpl] The 1912 team would go on to win a team record 105 games and their second World Series title, defeating the New York Giants.
Six years later, the Chicago Cubs scored two runs off of Babe Ruth in game 4 of the Series, snapping his then record World Series scoreless inning streak at [tpl]frac|29|2|3[/tpl] innings.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=28[/tpl] However, the Red Sox won the game 2–1, and went on to capture their fifth Series title, their third in four years, and fourth in seven years.
The Yankees would however receive one notable moment of glory against the Red Sox during this era. On April 24, 1917 Yankee pitcher George Mogridge threw a no-hitter at Fenway Park, the first in the ball park's history and first in Yankee history. It would also turn out to be the Yankees only no-hitter where they allowed a run as they would win the game 2–1.

==Babe Ruth sold to Yankees==

In 1916, Harry Frazee purchased the Red Sox, on credit, for $500,000. Despite Ruth's success with the Red Sox, owner and Broadway producer Frazee lost his patience with Ruth, who had threatened to hold out in lieu of a larger contract and become a distraction. After the Red Sox finished sixth in the American League in 1919, Frazee, needing money to finance a Broadway musical, No, No Nanette, sold pitcher-turned-outfielder Babe Ruth to the Yankees.[tpl]cite news|title=When Red Sox Fold, It's Always 'My Fault'|date=September 21, 1990|first=Thomas|last=Boswell|newspaper=The Washington Post|page=C1|authorlink=Thomas Boswell|quote=The Red Sox are being punished because they sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees in 1920 so owner Harry Frazee could finance a lightweight Broadway musical called 'No, No, Nanette.'[/tpl] Frazee received $125,000 and a loan of $300,000—secured on Fenway Park, the Red Sox' home stadium—for Ruth, despite Ruth having set the record for home runs with 29 in 1919.[tpl]harvnb|Vaccaro|2005|p=53[/tpl] This began a series of deals with the Yankees that resulted in a long period of mediocrity for the Red Sox while the Yankees began their dynasty.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=23[/tpl]
Ruth's arrival in New York simultaneously launched the Yankee dynasty while ravaging the Red Sox. While the Red Sox's five World Series titles were a record at the time, 1918 would be the team's last championship for 86 years. Meanwhile, Ruth's home run-hitting prowess anchored the Yankee line-up, which became known as "Murderers' Row" in the late 1920s. The Yankees reached the World Series seven times during Ruth's New York years, winning four. This abrupt reversal of fortunes for the Red Sox marked the beginning of the supposed "Curse of the Bambino." But it was not the Ruth deal alone that reversed the fortunes of both clubs. Frazee also sold many other players to the Yankees.[tpl]cite web|last=Levitt|first=Dan|title=Harry Frazee and the Red Sox|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/harry-frazee-and-the-red-sox|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=10 July 2012[/tpl]
Robert W. Creamer reported that "the loan was made and relations between the two clubs continued to be cordial, with Frazee sending player after player to the Yankees over the next few seasons for more and more cash. This was no accident. Frazee and Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert were friends, and American League president Ban Johnson's attempts to drive Frazee out of the game had caused the five teams loyal to Johnson to make no deals with the Red Sox as long as Frazee owned the club, leaving only the Yankees and White Sox as trading partners. When the White Sox's reputation was destroyed in the Black Sox Scandal, Frazee's only option for trades was to deal with the Yankees.
The Red Sox soon became a baseball disaster area, finishing dead last nine times in eleven seasons."[tpl]cite book|first=Robert W.|last=Creamer|title=Babe: The Legend Comes to Life|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1974|page=209|authorlink=Robert Creamer[/tpl] Among others, Wally Schang, Everett Scott, Carl Mays, Waite Hoyt, Joe Bush and Sam Jones went from the Sox to the Yankees in the next one to three years,[tpl]harvnb|The New York Times|The Boston Globe|Araton|Kepner|2004|p=2[/tpl] along with Ed Barrow, the former Red Sox manager who became the Yankees' general manager and empire-builder for the first quarter-century of the Yankees' dynasty.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|pp=36, 43[/tpl] Scott, a former Red Sox team captain, actually took the reins as Yankee captain from Ruth when he arrived and in doing so became the only player in history to be named captain for both teams.[tpl]cite web|last=Birch|first=Ray|title=Everett Scott|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/365591cd|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research[/tpl]

==Curse of the Bambino==

From 1920 through 2003, the Yankees won 26 World Series championships and 39 pennants, compared to only four pennants for the Red Sox. In every year that the Red Sox won the pennant—1946, 1967, 1975 and 1986—they lost the World Series four games to three, leaving them with no World Series titles.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|pp=238, 242–243[/tpl] During this time, the Red Sox finished second in the standings to the Yankees on twelve occasions—in 1938, 1939, 1941, 1942, 1949, 1977, 1978, and every year from 1998 to 2003.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=80[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Vaccaro|2005|p=25[/tpl] During the 84-year period, the Yankees finished with a better regular-season record than the Red Sox 66 times, leading one sportswriter to quip that the Yankees' rivalry with the Red Sox was much like the rivalry "between a hammer and a nail."[tpl]harvnb|The New York Times|The Boston Globe|Araton|Kepner|2004|p=1[/tpl] However, the Yankees finished second in the standings to the Red Sox twice, in 1986 and 1995.

===1920s and 1930s: First Yankee dynasty===

Just two years after Ruth's sale, he went on to have a record setting season—statistically, one of the greatest in major league history for a batter. This propelled the Yankees to capture their first pennant and face their rival Giants. On October 5, 1921, the Yankees appeared in and won the their very first World Series game.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|pp=59, 65[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Yanks Win, 3 to 0; Mays Curbs Giants; Ruth Bats in a Run|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 6, 1921|page=1[/tpl] However, Ruth got hurt during the Series, and the Yankees eventually dropped the last three games, losing the Series five games to three to the Giants in the last ever best-of-nine Series. Both the Yankees and Giants would play in the 1922 World Series as well, a series that would be the Yankees' last in the two teams' shared stadium at the Polo Grounds as the Giants served the Yankees an eviction notice after the 1921 season.[tpl]cite news|title=Hunt for Home is Spared to Yanks|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 22, 1920|page=19[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Ruth Crashes Out Homers 50 and 51|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 25, 1920|page=19[/tpl]
The Yankees would eventually move across the Harlem River to the Bronx into Yankee Stadium. On April 18, 1923, both the Red Sox and Yankees played for the first time at the Yankees new home.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=36[/tpl] Over 74,200 people watched the Yankees defeat the Red Sox, 4–1, in the first game played at the stadium. Babe Ruth hit the new stadium's first home run, christening the stadium as "the House that Ruth Built." Ruth would finish the year with a .393 batting average, while being walked a then-record 170 times. The Yankees met the New York Giants for the third straight year in the World Series. The 1923 World Series resulted with the Yankees winning their first World Championship. Of the 24 players on the Yankees' first championship team, 11 came from the Red Sox.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=44[/tpl]
Several lesser known moments in the rivalry occurred during the 1930s. Pitcher Red Ruffing was traded in 1930 from the Red Sox to the Yankees.[tpl]cite web|title=Red Ruffing Trades and Transactions|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/trades.php?p=ruffire01|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=2 August 2012[/tpl] Ruffing, who had limited success with the Red Sox, would go on to a Hall of Fame career with the Yankees winning 6 World Series with them.[tpl]cite web|title=Ruffing, Red|url=http://baseballhall.org/hof/ruffing-red|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame[/tpl] On August 12, 1934, then the largest crowd in the history of Fenway Park, 46,766, witnessed Babe Ruth's final game at Fenway Park in a Yankees uniform in a game Boston would lose.[tpl]cite web|title=Milestones|url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/bos/ballpark/information/index.jsp?content=milestones|work=Major League Baseball|publisher=Boston Red Sox[/tpl] A year later, the crowd record would be broken again when the two teams met again on September 22, 1935. Record crowds would also show up at Yankee Stadium. On May 30, 1938, before 83,533 spectators, Yankees outfielder Jake Powell and Red Sox player-manager Joe Cronin fought on the field and beneath the stands.[tpl]cite news|title=Fists Fly as Yanks Triumph, 10-0, 5-4|first=John|last=Drebinger|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 31, 1938|page=23|authorlink=John Drebinger[/tpl] Both players were fined and suspended for 10 games.[tpl]cite news|title=Yanks Down Red Sox as Gehrig Extends String to 2,000|first=Louis|last=Effrat|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 1, 1938|page=27|authorlink=Louis Effrat[/tpl] The Yankees and Red Sox would finish first and second in the League respectively that year as well as the following.

===1940s–1960s: Teddy Ballgame, Joltin' Joe the Yankee Clipper===

The rivalry intensified in 1941 when Ted Williams of the Red Sox batted .406, becoming the last player to bat over .400 in a season. Despite his accomplishment, Williams lost the AL MVP race to the Yankees' Joe DiMaggio, who holds the record for a hitting streak, with 56 straight games in which he had a hit.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=142[/tpl] DiMaggio's unprecedented streak started on May 15, 1941 in a game where the Yankees lost 13–1 to the Chicago White Sox. Williams later reminisced about his rivalry with DiMaggio saying "(Joe) DiMaggio was the greatest all-around player I ever saw. His career cannot be summed up in numbers and awards. It might sound corny, but he had a profound and lasting impact on the country."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/quotes/quodimg.shtml|title=Joe DiMaggio Quotes|work=Baseball-Almanac.com[/tpl] Both teams almost swapped the two players.

The 1951 season opened up at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees defeated the Red Sox, which was PA announcer Bob Sheppard first game.

On September 28 of that year, Yankees pitcher Allie Reynolds pitched a no-hitter against the Red Sox.[tpl]cite news|title=Righetti Pitches First Yankee No-Hitter Since 1956|date=July 5, 1983|first=Murray|last=Chass|newspaper=The New York Times|page=B9|authorlink=Murray Chass[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|pp=166, 168[/tpl] A year later, Red Sox outfielder Jimmy Piersall and Yankees second baseman Billy Martin exchanged insults before a game in Boston, and ended up fighting in the tunnel under the stands. The fight was eventually broken up by Yankees coaches Bill Dickey and Oscar Melillo, and Boston starting pitcher Ellis Kinder. Piersall changed out of his bloody shirt and promptly fought with teammate Maury McDermott. The Red Sox won 5–2 with Piersall sitting the game out.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.redsoxvyankees.com/brawls/brawl2.html|title=All-Star Brawler: Martin (NYY) v.

Starting in 1949, the Yankees began a streak of five consecutive World Series titles from 1949 to 1953 and breaking their previous streak of four straight titles from 1936 to 1939. They would also go on to win 14 pennants in 16 years starting in 1949.

The 1961 season saw the chase of Babe Ruth's 1927 single season home run record by Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=170[/tpl] Both Maris and Mantle would continue to reach the home run record until Mantle got injured late in the season, leaving Maris to reach the record.

The next year in [tpl]mlby|1962[/tpl], the Red Sox had been in the middle of a streak of 8 losing seasons. The team was so bad, that after a 13-3 loss to the Yankees on July 26, Red Sox ace Gene Conley got off the bus and attempted to leave the country and go to Israel. Conley was denied his request because he did not have a passport. Nonetheless, Conley did stay away from the team for 3 days.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/print?id=8428498&type=story|date=September 27, 2012|title=1962: Return with us now|first=Jim|last=Caple|work=ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.celticslife.com/2011/10/what-hell-happened-togene-conley.html|title=What the Hell Happened to...Gene Conley?|work=CelticsLife.com|date=October 16, 2011[/tpl]
Years later in 1967, Red Sox pitcher Billy Rohr came within a single strike of a no-hitter at Yankee Stadium.[tpl]harvnb|Vaccaro|2005|pp=238–239[/tpl] Elston Howard hit a two-out, two-strike single in the ninth to break the no-hit bid. Rohr completed the one-hitter, but ultimately finished his career with only two wins, both coming against the Yankees. Later that year, Red Sox third baseman Joe Foy hit a grand slam during the first game of a two-game series. In the second game, Yankee pitcher Thad Tillotson threw two brushback pitches at Foy before beaning him in the batting helmet. In the next inning, Red Sox pitcher Jim Lonborg beaned Tillotson. Both pitchers yelled at each other, and then a brawl ensued. During the fight, Red Sox outfielder Reggie Smith picked up and body-slammed Tillotson to the ground.[tpl]cite news|title=Blood Feud|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2004-07-25/sports/18269528_1_yankees-red-sox-yankees-starter-yankee-stadium|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=25 July 2004[/tpl] Just two months later, both teams were involved in the longest game ever played (by innings) at Yankee Stadium.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=12[/tpl] New York recorded a 20-inning, 4–3 victory over Boston.

In 1973, the American League decided to adopt the designated hitter rule.[tpl]cite news|title=On Deck in AL—dh|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 1, 1973|page=248[/tpl] On April 6, opening the season at Fenway Park, Ron Blomberg of the Yankees became the first designated hitter in Major League history.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|pp=173–174[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Fisk's 2 Homers Set Boston Pace|date=April 7, 1973|first=Murray|last=Chass|newspaper=The New York Times|page=23[/tpl] Red Sox pitcher Luis Tiant walked Blomberg in his first plate appearance of the game.

Lee suffered a separated left shoulder from the tilt and missed the next 51 games of the 1976 season. He would continue to pitch until 1982. The 1976 season saw the Yankees win the pennant, but lose to the Big Red Machine in the 1976 World Series,[tpl]cite news|title=Reds Triumph, 7–2, and Complete 4-Game Series Sweep of Yankees|first=Murray|last=Chass|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 22, 1976|page=1|authorlink=Murray Chass[/tpl] just like the Red Sox had done a year prior in the 1975 World Series in which Carlton Fisk hit his famous home run off of the left field foul pole at Fenway Park.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|pp=125–131[/tpl]
After the Yankees' loss to the Reds, owner George Steinbrenner committed to sign marquee free agent Reggie Jackson to help win a championship.[tpl]cite news|title=Jackson Signs Yankee Contract For Five Years and $2.9 Million|first=Murray|last=Chass|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 30, 1976|page=47[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|The New York Times|The Boston Globe|Araton|Kepner|2004|p=133[/tpl] The Yankees, Red Sox, and Baltimore Orioles would keep leap frogging each other the entire year during the division race.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=133[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=36[/tpl] The Yankees would win the division for the second year in a row, while the Orioles and Red Sox finished tied for second, [tpl]frac|2|1|2[/tpl] games behind the Yankees. Jackson's entry onto the Yankees initially had caused a lot of friction on them. In the middle game of what would prove to be a three-game series sweep by the Red Sox at Fenway Park, Yankees manager Billy Martin pulled Reggie Jackson off the field in mid-inning for failing to hustle on a ball hit to the outfield. The extremely angry and highly-animated Martin had to be restrained by coaches Yogi Berra and Elston Howard from getting into a fistfight with Jackson in the dugout during the nationally-televised Saturday afternoon game. Eventually, emotions calmed down for the season and the Yankees came together to recapture the pennant and defeat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1977 World Series, their first since [tpl]wsy|1962[/tpl].[tpl]cite news|title=Billy Martin vs. Everybody|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/gallery/featured/GAL1143695/18/18/index.htm|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=Sports Illustrated[/tpl]
In 1978, the Red Sox, led by Jim Rice, Carl Yastrzemski, Fred Lynn and catcher Carlton Fisk, and managed by future Yankee coach Don Zimmer,[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|pp=36, 38[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|pp=134–136[/tpl] were looking good for the World Series (aka "Fall Classic") for the second time in the decade. They led the Yankees in the standings by 14 games in mid-July, with less than three months to go in the regular season.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=136[/tpl] However, the Yankees turned their season around just as the Red Sox seemed to collapse.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|pp=136–138[/tpl] By September 7, the Yankees had whittled down the 14-game deficit to only four games, just in time for a four-game series at Fenway Park in Boston. The Yankees won all four games in the series by a combined score of 42–9.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=138[/tpl] This series became known as the "Boston Massacre".[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|pp=175–177[/tpl] On September 16, the Yankees held a [tpl]frac|3|1|2[/tpl]-game lead over the Red Sox, but the Sox won 12 of their next 14 games (and their last eight in a row) to overcome that deficit and finish in a first-place tie with the Yankees.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|pp=47–48[/tpl] A one-game playoff was scheduled in Boston to determine who would win the AL East pennant for 1978.
Boston pitted former Yankee pitcher Mike Torrez against the Yankees' Cy Young Award winner, Ron Guidry, who took a 24–3 record into the game.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|pp=141–142[/tpl] The Sox were beating Guidry 2–0 in the top of the seventh inning when light-hitting Yankee shortstop Bucky Dent hit a two-out, three-run home run over Fenway Park's Green Monster to take a 3–2 lead.[tpl]cite news|title=Yankee power KIs Bosox hopes|last=Patton|first=Paul|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=October 3, 1978|page=P37[/tpl] It was only his fifth home run of the season.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=146[/tpl] The Yankees later led 5–2 and held on to win 5–4 when Yastrzemski popped out with runners on first and third, ending the Red Sox' season.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=149[/tpl] Yankees closer Goose Gossage notched his 27th save of the season.

==1980s and early 1990s==

===1980s: No championships===

The 1980s was the only decade that neither the Yankees nor the Red Sox won a World Series.[tpl]cite news|title=Fans voicing displeasure with Yankees' ownership|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=August 31, 1989|page=A18|author=Associated Press|quote=This is the first Yankee team since 1910–1919 to go an entire decade without winning a World Series title.[/tpl] Although both teams went each went to a World Series during that decade, the Red Sox were not serious contenders in the Yankees' playoff years (1980 and 1981),[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=14[/tpl] but the Yankees seriously contended in the Red Sox' playoff years (1986 and 1988).
The Yankees lost the World Series in [tpl]wsy|1981[/tpl], while the Red Sox loss came in 1986. Both times, the teams lost after being up 2–0 in their respective World Series, and both losses happened in New York (The Red Sox lost the 1986 World Series at Shea Stadium). For the Yankees, the loss in 1981 marked the beginning of the team's demise and downfall in the 1980s and early 1990s.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/07/sports/baseball-flashback-to-81-another-lead-another-strike.html?pagewanted=1&pagewanted=print|title=Flashback to '81: Another Lead, Another Strike|date=August 7, 1994|first=Jack|last=Curry|newspaper=The New York Times|page=A1|authorlink=Jack Curry[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Amore|first=Dom|title=Imagine: Buck's Yankees, But Not Jeter's|newspaper=Hartford Courant|date=May 15, 2005|page=E8[/tpl] Despite the lack of championships, the rivalry between the teams did have some memorable highlights. Yankee left-hander Dave Righetti threw a no-hitter against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|pp=179–180[/tpl] One of the game's greatest hitters, Wade Boggs, struck out to end the game. This was the first no-hitter thrown by a left-hander at Yankee Stadium and the first no-hitter by a Yankee since Don Larsen's perfect game against Subway Series rival Brooklyn Dodgers in Game five of the 1956 World Series and the first regular no-hitter by a Yankee since 1951.
On October 4, 1986, Righetti once again made history against the Red Sox when he saved both games of a doubleheader against them, finishing the season with 46 saves,[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=15[/tpl] and breaking the major league record shared by Dan Quisenberry and Bruce Sutter.[tpl]cite news|title=Righetti Breaks Record; Mattingly, at .351, Needs to Go 6 for 6 Righetti Breaks Mark|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 5, 1986|page=210[/tpl] The record would stand until Bobby Thigpen saved 57 games for the Chicago White Sox in [tpl]mlby|1990[/tpl],[tpl]cite news|title=Thigpen Sets Record With 47th|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 4, 1990|page=D16|author=Associated Press[/tpl] which would also be Righetti's last season with the Yankees. Righetti retained the single-season record for left-handers until [tpl]mlby|1993[/tpl], when Randy Myers saved 53 games for the Chicago Cubs; Righetti still owns the AL record for left-handers.
Righetti's teammate, first baseman and defending American League MVP Don Mattingly, came into the last game batting .352, second in the league to Boston's Wade Boggs. With Boggs sitting out the game, Mattingly needed to go 6 for 6 to win the batting title. Although Mattingly would hit a home run in his first at bat and a double later on, he fell short and Boggs won the batting title. Mattingly would be named most outstanding player that year by the press, but fell short to Boggs' teammate Roger Clemens in the AL MVP voting.
Despite Righetti's pitching on the last day of the season, the Red Sox still won the division and marched on in the playoffs. The Yankees' bad performance during the 1980s came when the Red Sox faced the Yankees' cross-town rivals, the New York Mets, in the World Series. The New York Times called the series a "painful series".[tpl]cite news|title=It's More than Baseball; For Yankee Fans, A Painful Series|date=October 19, 1986|first=Dennis|last=Hevesi|newspaper=The New York Times|page=A51[/tpl] Newsday called it "woeful days for Yankee fans".[tpl]cite news|title=And What If You're a Yankees Fan?|date=October 18, 1986|first=Richard C.|last=Firstman|newspaper=Newsday|page=83[/tpl] Mike Lupica of the New York Daily News called the series "the World Series that is the Yankee nightmare".[tpl]cite news|title=Yankees' Fans Get Worst of Both Worlds|date=October 18, 1986|first=Mike|last=Lupica|authorlink=Mike Lupica|newspaper=New York Daily News[/tpl] Both Newsday and The Boston Globe said there were Mets T-shirts saying "Steinbrenner's nightmare,"[tpl]cite news|quote=At McGonnell's bar, the sporting center of New York City...on display for sale behind the bar were Mets/Sox T-shirts with "Steinbrenner's nightmare" stenciled on the backs, the creation of one of the bar's regulars.|title=Lopsided Score Means Early Exit for NY Fans|date=October 20, 1986|first=Diane|last=Alters|newspaper=The Boston Globe|page=42[/tpl] referring to Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.

In game six of the World Series, Boston (leading the series three games to two) took a 5–3 lead in the top of the 10th inning. In the bottom half of the frame, Red Sox reliever Calvin Schiraldi retired the first two batters, putting the team within one out of winning the World Series. However, the Mets scored three unanswered runs, tying the game on a wild pitch from Bob Stanley and winning it when Boston first baseman Bill Buckner allowed a ground ball hit by the Mets' Mookie Wilson to roll through his legs, scoring Ray Knight from second base. In the seventh game, the Red Sox took an early 3–0 lead, only to lose 8–5. The collapses in the last two games prompted a series of articles by George Vecsey of The New York Times fueling speculation that the Red Sox were "cursed".[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=175[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=8[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES: THE WORLD SERIES '86; Red Sox: 68 Years and Counting|date=October 26, 1986|first=George|last=Vecsey|newspaper=The New York Times|page=A3[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES; Babe Ruth Curse Strikes Again|date=October 28, 1986|first=George|last=Vecsey|newspaper=The New York Times|page=D33[/tpl]

===1990–1995===

The tone of baseball rivalries changed in the early 1990s; fraternization between players who had moved to different teams or knew each other from various ventures kept baseball rivalries to a "friendly" level.[tpl]cite news|title=Rival relationships: Love to hate romance|last=Bradley|first=Jeff|date=July 20, 1993|newspaper=New York Daily News|quote=It's clear that this is the way of sports in the 1990s, love conquering all.

Prior to the realignment, the American League East Division contained seven teams, spread out over a wider geographical area, including the Cleveland Indians and the Milwaukee Brewers.
In the early to mid-1990s, the two teams were seldom equally good.

T-shirts each time they were at the Stadium.

Mel Hall's game-winning three-run home run in the ninth inning gave the Yankees a dramatic Memorial Day win over the Red Sox in 1991.

The 1993 season saw long-time Red Sox fan favorite Wade Boggs defect to the Yankees after eleven seasons with Boston. Later in September 1993, the Yankees defeated Boston at Yankee Stadium via a last-moment reprieve. Trailing 3–1, Mike Stanley's apparent fly out with two outs in the ninth was nullified by a fan running on to the field prior to the pitch being thrown. The umpire had called time and when play resumed, Stanley singled.

The Yankees' 1980s demise and downfall continued into the early 1990s and was at its frustrating peak in 1994, when they finished with the best record in the American League in a season that was prematurely halted by the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike,[tpl]cite news|last=Costello|first=Brian|title='94 Yanks Cut Short|newspaper=New York Post|date=August 8, 2004|page=58[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=All the Magic Is Gone From the Yankees' Numbers|date=September 15, 1994|first=Jack|last=Curry|newspaper=The New York Times|page=B11|authorlink=Jack Curry|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/15/sports/baseball-the-teams-all-the-magic-is-gone-from-the-yankees-numbers.html?pagewanted=print[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1994.shtml|title=1994 American League Team Statistics and Standings|accessdate=June 7, 2011|work=Baseball Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC[/tpl] which left New York sports fans disappointed that Mattingly had not played in a postseason despite being poised to do so that year.[tpl]cite journal|title=New York's top ten worst moments in sports|date=September 16, 1997|first=Bob|last=Eckstein|journal=The Village Voice|volume=42|issue=37|page=142[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Yankees Fans Left with Broken Hearts|date=September 16, 1994|first=Larry|last=McShane|agency=Associated Press[/tpl] At that time, he led active players in both games played and at-bats without participating in a postseason game.[tpl]harvnb|Johnson|Stout|2002|p=386[/tpl] Throughout October, the news media added to the embarrassment when they often made references to dates that games in the World Series would have been played.[tpl]cite news|title=Finishing What They Started|date=April 25, 1995|first=Jack|last=O'Connell|newspaper=Hartford Courant|page=G2|quote=In the lengthy and uncertain off-season, an unfair annointing was bestowed on the Yankees.

The strike was the harbinger of the [tpl]mlby|1995[/tpl] season for the Yankees. Although the Red Sox jumped out to a fast start and finished the season in first place, the Yankees were not serious contenders for the division title. However, with the Yankees clinching the inaugural American League Wild Card on the last day of the season, the Yankees and Red Sox reached the post-season in the same season for the first time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1995.shtml|title=1995 American League Team Statistics and Standings|accessdate=January 26, 2011|work=Baseball Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=16[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Last-minute thrills give baseball a jolt|first=Mel|last=Antonen|date=October 2, 1995|page=1C|newspaper=USA Today[/tpl] Before the postseason began, Mattingly contemplated about the first-ever playoff series in the rivalry, saying, "That would be pretty cool.

For the Yankees, the loss led to another post-strike fallout: both Showalter and general manager Gene Michael were fired as a result of the loss. Similarly, the firing of Michael as Yankees manager and the loss in the 1981 World Series were fallouts from the strike that year.[tpl]cite news|title=Behind Two Strikes?

Beginning with the 1995 playoffs, every playoffs have featured the Yankees and/or the Red Sox. As of 2012, the two rivals have made up 25 out of 34 possible playoff appearances, with the two teams reaching the playoffs in the same year eight times (1995, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, and 2009).

==1996–2003: Yankee dominance and first postseason meetings==

===Late 1990s: Yankee dynasty===

A year after captain Don Mattingly's retirement in 1995, the Yankees won the 1996 World Series. It was their first in 18 years and the first of former Red Sox player Wade Boggs' career, coming almost 10 years to the day he lost it to Mets. Boggs celebrated the victory with a memorable moment of jumping on the horse of a NYPD officer during the celebration.[tpl]cite news|title=Boggs Takes a Ride|date=October 27, 1996|first=Jack|last=Curry|newspaper=The New York Times|page=8.5[/tpl] However, the Yankees, like the rest of baseball, were still reeling from what was lost in 1994, because many members of the 1994 team were not there in 1996. Showalter said the 1994 strike "sits in my craw," and that he could not watch the World Series because "I feel badly for the fans".[tpl]cite news|title=Puckett receives Clemente award|newspaper=USA Today|date=October 24, 1996|page=5C[/tpl]
The Yankees did not reach the World Series in 1997, but came back with one of the better seasons in baseball history in 1998, which culminated in a win over the San Diego Padres in the 1998 World Series.[tpl]harvnb|The New York Times|The Boston Globe|Araton|Kepner|2004|p=152[/tpl] The Red Sox, too, made the playoffs in 1998, but as a Wild Card. They ultimately lost their ALDS. However, they did not seriously contend for the division title.
About four months after victory, the Yankees controversially traded fan favorite David Wells to the Toronto Blue Jays for Roger Clemens, a fan favorite with the Red Sox between 1984 and 1996. Clemens was coming off two consecutive season with the Blue Jays where he had won both the pitching triple crown and the Cy Young Award in both 1997 and 1998.
Once the [tpl]mlby|1999[/tpl] season started, a moment of peace occurred between the fans. Yankees manager Joe Torre returned to Fenway Park for his first game following a battle with prostate cancer.[tpl]cite news|title=Martinez, Sox get the drop on Yankees Win in opener puts Boston in first|date=May 19, 1999|first=Gordon|last=Edes|newspaper=The Boston Globe|page=C1[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Torre return the best of New York stories|date=May 19, 1999|first=Dan|last=Shaughnessy|newspaper=The Boston Globe[/tpl] While the managers were exchanging lineup cards, the Boston crowd gave Torre a long standing ovation, to which he tipped his cap.[tpl]cite news|title=Torre Returns to Witness a Dismal Performance by Yankees|date=May 19, 1999|first=Buster|last=Olney|newspaper=The New York Times|page=D1|authorlink=Buster Olney[/tpl] Good relations were seen during the All-Star Game at Fenway Park.[tpl]cite news|title=It's Martinez's showcase: Sox ace strikes out five|first=Gordon|last=Edes|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=July 14, 1999|page=D1[/tpl] Yankee manager Joe Torre, manager for the American League team, replaced starting shortstop Nomar Garciaparra of the Red Sox with Derek Jeter. Garciaparra received a standing ovation from the fans after Jeter came in to replace him (they also embraced each other at this time). Later in the game, when he came to bat, Jeter gave Garciaparra a tribute by mimicking his batting stance. Nine years later, in a similar fashion, Red Sox manager Terry Francona managed the American League team at the All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium, in the stadium's final season.
On September 10, 1999, Chili Davis' second-inning home run was the only hit by the Yankees against Pedro Martínez, who struck out 17 Yankees—the most strikeouts against a Yankee team ever.[tpl]cite news|title=1 Hit, 17 Strikeouts, No Way for the Yankees|date=September 11, 1999|first=Buster|last=Olney|newspaper=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/11/sports/baseball-1-hit-17-strikeouts-no-way-for-the-yankees.html?pagewanted=print|authorlink=Buster Olney[/tpl] Martínez retired the last 22 batters after giving up the home run, including striking out eight of the final nine batters.[tpl]harvnb|Vaccaro|2005|p=97[/tpl] The teams finished first and second in their division and both made the playoffs in the same season. This led to the very first post-season meeting in the longtime rivalry.

====1999 ALCS: First postseason meeting====

In 1999, the Yankees and Red Sox faced each other for the first time in the ALCS. The Yankees were the defending World Series champions and in the midst of a run of three consecutive World Championships, while Boston had not appeared in the ALCS since 1990. The Yankees won the first game of the ALCS against the Red Sox on a 10th-inning walk-off home run by Bernie Williams off Boston reliever Rod Beck.[tpl]cite news|title=Beck was Brief in his Relief|date=October 14, 1999|first=Michael|last=Madden|newspaper=The Boston Globe|page=E3[/tpl] The game was the first actual postseason meeting between the rivals because the one-game playoff in 1978 technically counted as a regular season game. Despite intense buildup to this historic, first-ever postseason meeting between the two longtime rivals, the series proved to be somewhat anticlimactic, with New York winning the series four games to one.
The lone bright spot for the Red Sox came in Game 3 at Boston's Fenway Park, in what had been a much anticipated pitching match-up of former Red Sox star Roger Clemens, who was now pitching for the Yankees, and Boston ace Pedro Martínez. Martínez struck out twelve and did not allow a run through seven innings of work; Clemens was hit hard, giving up five earned runs and only lasting two innings of a 13–1 Red Sox victory.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|pp=180–182[/tpl] However, the Yankees rebounded to win Games 4 and 5, clinching the American League pennant and advancing to the Series, where they swept the Atlanta Braves.[tpl]cite news|title=Yankees Sweep for 25th Title as Clemens Gets Dream|first=Buster|last=Olney|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 28, 1999|page=A1[/tpl] The loss to Pedro Martínez was the Yankees' only postseason loss, as the team went 11–1.
The following year at Fenway Park, the Yankees beat the Red Sox 22–1, handing Boston its most lopsided home loss ever.[tpl]cite news|title=Tee-Off Time Yankees Club Sox in Worst Home Defeat|date=June 20, 2000|first=Gordon|last=Edes|newspaper=The Boston Globe|page=F1|authorlink=Gordon Edes[/tpl] The Yankees scored 16 total runs in the 8th and 9th innings. The Yankees lost 15 of their final 18 games that season and finished with a record of 87–74, but the Red Sox failed to catch up and finished 2.5 games out of first to lose another division title to the Yankees.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/history/season/_/year/2000|title=MLB Season History – 2000|accessdate=July 3, 2010|work=ESPN.com[/tpl] Despite having the lowest winning percentage of any postseason qualifier in 2000, the Yankees won their third consecutive World Series and 26th overall, in the first Subway Series since 1956, over their cross-town rivals, the New York Mets, in 5 games.[tpl]cite book|title=The subway series: the Yankees, the Mets and a season to remember|year=2000|publisher=The Sporting News|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=0-89204-659-7[/tpl]
A year later, David Cone, one of the key players in the then-most recent Yankee dynasty, started for the Red Sox against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium to the sound of a standing ovation despite playing for the arch-rival Red Sox.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|pp=16–17[/tpl] It marked Cone's first return to Yankee Stadium since leaving the team. Cone would later take part in another notable game later that year when he went up against newly acquired Yankee pitcher Mike Mussina.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|pp=182–183[/tpl] Mussina had come within one strike of pitching a perfect game against the Red Sox at Fenway Park. Carl Everett's 9th-inning two-out, two-strike single was the only baserunner allowed by Mussina in a 1–0 Yankee win. Coincidentally, David Cone was the last Yankee pitcher to throw a perfect game, in 1999.
On September 10, the two teams had a game against each other rained out.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110904&content_id=24198548&vkey=09112011|title=Yanks carried weight, hopes of many post-9/11|date=September 8, 2011|accessdate=September 10, 2011|first=Bryan|last=Hoch|work=MLB.com|publisher=Major League Baseball[/tpl] The next day, the country saw one of its biggest tragedies bring both sides together.

In the top of the fourth inning of Game 3 of the ALCS at Fenway Park, Red Sox starting pitcher Pedro Martínez hit Yankee batter Karim García, prompting an argument between the two players, which ended with both teams clearing the benches but no punches being thrown.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=22[/tpl] In the bottom half of the inning, a pitch from Roger Clemens to Manny Ramírez was high and inside, and a brawl ensued. Ramírez swore at Clemens for the pitch. Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer, then 72 years old, and who had been the manager of the "doomed" 1978 Boston Red Sox, charged at Martínez; the pitcher grabbed Zimmer by the head and swung him to the ground. Later, midway through the ninth inning, García and Yankee pitcher Jeff Nelson fought with a Fenway Park groundskeeper, Paul Williams, in the bullpen.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=24[/tpl] Two Boston Police officers issued a report saying Nelson and García engaged in "an unprovoked attack" on Williams and summonses would be sought for the two New York Yankees for assault and battery.[tpl]harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=27[/tpl] After reviewing the incident, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig said he was "very disappointed" by the behavior of the participants and fined Martínez $50,000, Ramírez $25,000, García $10,000, and Zimmer $5,000.

In an effort to build up their lineup, the Red Sox set up a potential deal that would send reigning AL MVP Alex Rodriguez to Boston and Red Sox Manny Ramírez and other players to Texas.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=37[/tpl] The deal eventually fell through after Rodríguez indicated he would not go against the MLBPA, which opposes a proposed renegotiation, which would have potentially reduced Rodríguez's earnings in the later years of his contract.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|pp=41–44[/tpl] A freak off-season basketball injury to Aaron Boone just several months removed from his historic home run had Yankees management looking at possible options to replace him.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=44[/tpl] Despite being courted by Boston for nearly three months, Rodríguez was traded from Texas to New York.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|pp=45–46[/tpl]
New Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling, who had confounded New York in the 2001 World Series as an Arizona Diamondback, appeared at an ice hockey game in Boston wearing a "Yankee hater" hat.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=89[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=2379891&type=story|title=Hating the Yankees can be good for business|last=Rovell|first=Darren|work=ESPN|date=2006-03-22|accessdate=2006-11-04[/tpl]
That year, the Red Sox won an eventful season series against the Yankees.

Outfielder Johnny Damon said of Boone's home run: "If we do advance to the World Series and win, it's a better story that we went through New York. We needed to get back here.

The Yankees won the first three games of the series.[tpl]cite news|title=Red Sox on brink of elimination as Yanks pound them, 19–8|date=October 17, 2004|first=Dan|last=Shaughnessy|newspaper=The Boston Globe|page=A1|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2004/10/17/red_sox_on_brink_of_elimination_as_yanks_pound_them_19_8/?page=full[/tpl][tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=193[/tpl] No team in the history of baseball had ever won a best-of-seven series after being down three games to none. Entering the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 4 at Fenway Park, Yankees reliever Mariano Rivera was attempting to close out a 4–3 lead.[tpl]harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|pp=197–199[/tpl] But after issuing a leadoff walk to Kevin Millar, pinch-runner Dave Roberts stole second and came around to score on an RBI single by Bill Mueller. Boston won the game in the bottom of the 12th inning on a home run by David Ortiz. Game 5 featured another extra-inning Boston comeback, as the Red Sox tied the game in the 8th inning, and won it in the 14th on a single hit by Ortiz that drove in Damon from second to make it 4-3 Red Sox. In Game 6, Curt Schilling, who tore a tendon sheath in his right ankle during the American League Divisional Series against Anaheim, pitched seven innings of one-run ball. 4 innings in and the Yankees had still yet to get a hit off Schilling. Schilling's tendon was sutured to his ankle to relieve the discomfort and was given local anesthetic and painkillers for the game. During the game, his sock started to absorb the blood from his freshly sutured ankle, dubbed "the bloody sock". During the game a controversial call was called on Alex Rodriguez when he knocked the ball out of Arroyo's hand on his sprint to first. Boston won the contest, 4–2. They then completed their historic comeback with a blowout win in Game 7, by a score of 10–3. New York Yankees blowing the 3–0 lead has been considered the biggest collapse in the history of the rivalry.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A8479-2005Mar28?language=printer|title=Red Sox-Yankees Is Difficult to Top|date=March 30, 2005|accessdate=October 6, 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|first=Dave|last=Sheinin|page=H4[/tpl]

Just days later, Yankee right fielder Gary Sheffield's cap was knocked off by a Red Sox fan while trying to pick up a fair ball in right field at Fenway Park. In response, Sheffield pushed the fan. The conflict was quickly stopped by security guards. The fan was ejected from the game for interfering with play and eventually stripped of his season tickets.

==Geography==

Using Facebook Like button data, Ben Blatt of the Harvard College Sports Analysis Collective found in 2012 that Red Sox fans are east of the New York State-Vermont/Massachusetts border, and Yankees fans are west. Blatt wrote, "I had thought that it was possible that Red Sox Nation might extend into northern New York or Yankee territory might extend into Vermont. This turned out not to be the case". Connecticut divides support between the two teams; he found that 56.6% of Facebook users in Hartford, often cited as being on the border between the two teams' fans, supported the Yankees. While Blatt found that identifying an exact border within the state was impossible, Guilford and Middletown are almost exactly divided, with 50.7% in each supporting the Yankees.[tpl]cite web | url=http://harvardsportsanalysis.wordpress.com/2012/08/17/finding-the-true-border-between-yankee-and-red-sox-nation-using-facebook-data/ | title=Finding the True Border Between Yankee and Red Sox Nation Using Facebook Data | publisher=The Harvard Sports Analysis Collective | date=2012-08-17 | accessdate=30 January 2014 | author=Blatt, Ben[/tpl]

==Broadcasts on television==

The nature of the rivalry has led to games between the two teams being broadcast on national television. Whenever the two teams play a weekend series, the Friday game is broadcast on MLB Network, the Saturday game is broadcast on Fox, while the Sunday game is broadcast on either TBS in the afternoon or ESPN as part of Sunday Night Baseball; the New England Sports Network in the Boston market and the YES Network in the New York City market always carry games not assigned on either FOX or on ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball. Whenever they play games during the week, there are games broadcast on MLB Network and ESPN.[tpl]cite news|last=Yellon|first=Al|title=Yankees vs. Red Sox: Boston's Last Gasp?|url=http://mlb.sbnation.com/2012/7/27/3193164/yankees-red-sox-series-preview|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=Baseball Nation[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=MLB Schedule – Jul 24, 2012 – Jul 30, 2012|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/schedule?date=20120724|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=1 August 2012[/tpl]
