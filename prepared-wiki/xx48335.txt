The presidency of George W. Bush began on January 20, 2001, when he was inaugurated as the 43rd President of the United States of America. The oldest son of former president George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush was elected president in the 2000 general election, and became the second U.S. president whose father had held the same office (John Quincy Adams was the first).
After two recounts, Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Al Gore filed a lawsuit for a third. The Supreme Court's highly controversial decision in Bush v. Gore resolved the dispute. The Florida Secretary of State certified Bush as the winner of Florida. Florida's 25 electoral votes gave Bush, the Republican candidate, 271 electoral votes, enough to defeat Al Gore. Bush was re-elected in 2004. His second term ended on January 20, 2009.
As president, Bush pushed through a $1.3 trillion tax cut program and the No Child Left Behind Act, and also pushed for socially conservative efforts such as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and faith-based welfare initiatives. Nearly 8 million immigrants came to the United States from 2000 to 2005 – more than in any other five-year period in the nation's history."Study: Immigration grows, reaching record numbers".

After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Bush declared a global War on Terrorism and, in October 2001, ordered an invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban, destroy Al-Qaeda, and to capture Osama bin Laden. In March 2003, Bush received a mandate from the U.S. Congress to lead an invasion of Iraq, asserting that Iraq was in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1441.[tpl]cite web| url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/02/print/20030205-1.html| date=February 5, 2003| title=U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell Addresses the U.N.

Bush also initiated an AIDS program that committed $15 billion to combat AIDS over five years. His record as a humanitarian included helping enroll as many as 29 million of Africa's poorest children in schools.Michael Steele, Bush's Africa legacy, 2008-03-27, Washington Times, (5th paragraph)
On his second full day in office, Bush reinstated the Mexico City Policy; this policy required any non-governmental organization receiving US Government funding to refrain from performing or promoting abortion services in other countries."Obama Ends Global Family Planning Restrictions". NPR: National Public Radio. January 23, 2009. Also in 2002, President Bush withdrew funding from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), a key player in promoting family planning in the developing world."US funding revamps African contraceptive drive".

His second term was highlighted by several free trade agreements, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 alongside a strong push for offshore and domestic drilling, the nominations of Supreme Court Justices John Roberts and Samuel Alito, a push for Social Security and immigration reform, his administration's response to Hurricane Katrina, a surge of troops in Iraq, which was followed by a drop in violence, and several different economic initiatives aimed at preventing a banking system collapse, stopping foreclosures, and stimulating the economy during the recession.Bush to Sign Economic Stimulus Plan, 2008-02-09, VOA NewsBush Unveils Foreclosure Relief Plan, 2007-12-06, NPRBush: Bailout plan necessary to deal with crisis, 2008-09-25, CNN.comPresident Bush's Second Term Accomplishments and Agenda, 2005-08-03, The White HouseCharles Krauthammer, Surge Results are Visible, 2007-04-13, Real Clear Politics

President Bush vetoed 12 pieces of legislation, four of which were overturned by congress:

==Administration and cabinet==

Bush's Cabinet had included figures that were prominent in past administrations, notably former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who had served as United States National Security Advisor under Ronald Reagan. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had served as White House Chief of Staff and Secretary of Defense under Gerald Ford; Rumsfeld's successor, Robert Gates, served as Director of Central Intelligence under George H.W. Bush. Vice President Dick Cheney served as Secretary of Defense under George H. W. Bush.
Bush placed a high value on personal loyalty and, as a result, his administration had high message discipline. He maintained a "hands-off" style of management. "I'm confident in my management style. I'm a delegator because I trust the people I've asked to join the team. I'm willing to delegate. That makes it easier to be President," he said in an interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC in December 2003. Critics alleged, however, that Bush was willing to overlook mistakes made by loyal subordinates.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl]

There was only one non-Republican in Bush's cabinet: Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta, the first Asian American cabinet secretary, who had previously served as Secretary of Commerce under Bill Clinton, is a Democrat. Mineta resigned from Bush's cabinet on July 7, 2006 to pursue "other challenges".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/23/AR2006062300579.html |title=Lone Democrat in Bush Cabinet Is Departing |last=Wilber |first=Del Quentin |work=Washington Post |date=June 24, 2006 |accessdate=November 20, 2006[/tpl] Mary Peters, a Republican, was nominated and confirmed to succeed him as Transportation Secretary. At least one other non-Republican was apparently offered a position in the administration but declined. CNN reported that in the transition to his second term, Bush offered the positions of Ambassador to the United Nations and subsequently Secretary of Homeland Security to Senator Joe Lieberman, then a Democrat and currently an Independent Democrat.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2009[/tpl]
In 2006, Bush replaced long-time chief of staff Andrew Card with Joshua Bolten and made major staff and cabinet changes with the intention of revitalizing his Administration.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12048598/from/ET/ | title=White House shake-up: Chief of staff resigns | date=March 28, 2006 | publisher=MSNBC.com | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=September 30, 2006 [/tpl]
On November 8, 2006 (the day after the Democrats took back Congress in the midterm elections), Bush announced plans to replace Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld with former CIA Director Robert Gates. Gates was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 6 and took office as the 22nd Secretary of Defense on December 18.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6190279.stm|title=New US defence secretary sworn in|work=BBC News|date=December 18, 2006[/tpl]

===Cabinet members===

====Attorney General====

Bush's first Attorney General, John Ashcroft, was politically controversial, but widely viewed as competent. Ashcroft resigned days after Bush's 2004 re-election. Bush's second Attorney General was Alberto Gonzales. In addition to his work on providing guidelines for detainee interrogation methods prior to his appointment,[tpl]cite news | title=The President's Yes Man |first=Alan |last=Berlow |date= November 21, 2004 |page=B07 |publisher=Washington Post |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A64024-2004Nov19?language=printer |accessdate=August 30, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/cheney/chapters/pushing_the_envelope_on_presi/index.html | title=Pushing the Envelope on Presidential Power | publisher=Washington Post | author=Barton Gellman and Jo Becker | date=June 25, 2007 | accessdate=August 30, 2007[/tpl] he claimed there was no right to Habeas Corpus for detained combatants.[tpl]cite news | first=Bob | last=Egelko | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | title=Gonzales says the Constitution doesn't guarantee habeas corpus | date=January 24, 2007 | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/01/24/MNGDONO11O1.DTL | accessdate=June 19, 2007[/tpl] Michael Mukasey succeeded Gonzales and was the country's 81st Attorney General.

====Labor====

Bush's first nomination for Secretary of Labor was Linda Chavez. This nomination came under attack when evidence came to light that she had given money to an illegal immigrant from Guatemala who lived in her home. Chavez claimed that the woman was not an employee and she had merely provided her with emergency assistance due to the domestic abuse the woman had been facing at the time.Chavez Withdraws As Labor Nominee Associated Press article in the January 9, 2001 Washington Post. Retrieved November 22, 2006. Chavez's nomination was withdrawn. Instead, Bush nominated Elaine Chao, a former official with the administrations with Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, who was confirmed by the Senate. Chao was the only member of Bush's Cabinet to serve during Bush's entire tenure as President.

====Energy====

Bush's first Secretary of Energy, Spencer Abraham, was controversial at the time of his 2001 appointment because as a senator he co-sponsored S.896, a bill to abolish the United States Department of Energy, in 1999.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.commondreams.org/news2001/0115-06.htm | title=Leading Environmentalists Urge Senate to Oppose Abraham|date=January 15, 2001 | publisher=Common Dreams | author=Mark Helm | accessdate=August 30, 2007 [/tpl] Samuel Wright Bodman III, Sc.D. is the United States Secretary of Energy and was previously Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department.

====Homeland Security====

When Tom Ridge announced his decision to resign as Secretary of Homeland Security, Bush's first choice to replace him was Bernard Kerik, who served as Police Commissioner of the City of New York during the September 11, 2001 attacks. Kerik's nomination raised controversy when it was discovered that he had previously hired an undocumented worker as a nanny and housekeeper. After a week, Kerik pulled his nomination and Bush went on to nominate Michael Chertoff."As Kerik Faces Court, Questions Persist on Background Check" by William K. Rashbaum The New York Times June 30, 2006.

===Advisors and other officials===

===Military nominations and appointments===

===Supreme Court nominations and appointments===

Bush nominated the following people to the Supreme Court of the United States:

===Court of Appeals nominations and appointments===

===Federal Reserve appointment===

On October 24, 2005, Bush nominated Ben Bernanke to succeed Alan Greenspan as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. The Senate Banking Committee recommended Bernanke's confirmation by a 13–1 voice vote on November 16, 2005. With the full Senate's approval on January 31, 2006, by another voice vote, Bernanke was sworn in on February 1, 2006.

==Second term (2005–2009)==

==Political philosophy==

The guiding political philosophy of the Bush Administration has been termed neoconservative. The specific elements of neoconservative leadership have been itemized in policy papers by leading members of the Project for a New American Century, and is represented in the editorial perspective of the political journal the Weekly Standard. Administration officials chosen from the membership of the Project for a New American Century (PNAC) began with the selection of the candidate for vice president, Dick Cheney. Others included Richard Armitage, Zalmay Khalilzad, Lewis "Scooter" Libby, Richard Perle, former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Paul Wolfowitz.
In 1998, members of the PNAC, including Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz, wrote to President Bill Clinton urging him to remove Saddam Hussein from power using US diplomatic, political and military power.
In September 2000, the PNAC issued a report entitled Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategies, Forces, and Resources For A New Century, proceeding "from the belief that America should seek to preserve and extend its position of global leadership by maintaining the preeminence of U.S. military forces." The group stated that when diplomacy or sanctions fail, the United States must be prepared to take military action. The PNAC argued that the Cold War deployment of forces was obsolete. Defense spending and force deployment must reflect the post–Cold War duties that US forces are obligated to perform. Constabulary duties such as peacekeeping in the Balkans and the enforcement of the No Fly Zones in Iraq put a strain upon, and reduced the readiness of, US forces. The PNAC recommended the forward redeployment of US forces at new strategically placed permanent military bases in Southeast Europe and Southeast Asia. Permanent bases would ease the strain on US forces, allowing readiness to be maintained and the carrier fleet to be reduced. Furthermore, PNAC advocated that the US-globalized military should be enlarged, equipped and restructured for the "constabulary" roles associated with shaping the security in critical regions of the world.[tpl]cite web | url = http://newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf | format = PDF | work = Project for the New American Century | title = Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategy, Forces and Resources For a New Century |date=September 2000 | accessdate =April 7, 2007 [/tpl]

==Environmental record==

George W. Bush’s environmental record began with promises as a presidential candidate to clean up power plants and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In a speech on September 29, 2000 in Saginaw, Michigan, Bush pledged to commit two billion dollars to the funding of clean coal technology research. In the same speech, he also promised to work with Congress, environmental groups and the energy industry to require a reduction of the emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and carbon dioxide into the environment within a “reasonable period of time.”[tpl]Wayback |date=20010111035000 |url=http://www.georgebush.com/News/speeches/092900_energy.html |title=George W. Bush for President Official Site: Speeches[/tpl]. Retrieved June 13, 2011. He would later reverse his position on that specific campaign pledge in March 2001 in a letter to Nebraska senator Chuck Hagel, stating that carbon dioxide was not considered a pollutant under the Clean Air Act, and that restricting carbon dioxide emissions would lead to higher energy prices.[tpl]cite news| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/03/13/power.plant.emissions/index.html | work=CNN | title=Bush reverses position on emissions reductions | date=March 14, 2001 | accessdate=May 22, 2010[/tpl]
In 2001, Bush appointed Philip A. Cooney, a former lobbyist for the American Petroleum Institute, to the White House Council on Environmental Equality. Cooney is known to have edited government climate reports in order to minimize the findings of scientific sources tying greenhouse gas emissions to global warming.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/08/politics/08climate.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=Bush%20Aide%20Softened%20Greenhouse%20Gas%20Links%20to%20Global%20Warming&st=cse&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=Bush Aide Softened Greenhouse Gas Links to Global Warming | first=Andrew C. | last=Revkin | date=June 8, 2005 | accessdate=May 22, 2010[/tpl]
In March 2001, the Bush Administration announced that it would not implement the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty signed in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, that would require nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, claiming that ratifying the treaty would create economic setbacks in the U.S. and does not put enough pressure to limit emissions from developing nations.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1247518.stm | work=BBC News | title=US blow to Kyoto hopes | date=March 28, 2001 | accessdate=May 22, 2010[/tpl] In February 2002, Bush announced his alternative to the Kyoto Protocol, by bringing forth a plan to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gases by 18 percent over 10 years. The intensity of greenhouse gases specifically is the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions and economic output, meaning that under this plan, emissions would still continue to grow, but at a slower pace. Bush stated that this plan would prevent the release of 500 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, which is about the equivalent of removing 70 million cars from the road. This target would achieve this goal by providing tax credits to businesses that use renewable energy sources.[tpl]cite news| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/02/14/bush.global.warming/index.html | work=CNN | title=Bush unveils voluntary plan to reduce global warming | date=February 14, 2002 | accessdate=May 22, 2010[/tpl]
In late November 2002, the Bush Administration released proposed rule changes that would lead to increased logging of federal forests for commercial or recreational activities by giving local forest managers the ability to open up the forests to development without requiring environmental impact assessments and without specific standards to maintain local fish and wildlife populations. The proposed changes would affect roughly [tpl]convert|192000000|acre|km2[/tpl] of US forests and grasslands. Administration officials claimed the changes were appropriate because existing rules, which were approved by the Clinton administration two months before Bush took office, were unclear.Logging rules may be eased.

In November 2004, Bush Administration officials asked the United Nations to allow US industries to use an additional 458 tons of methyl bromide, an ozone-destroying pesticide that was slated for elimination by the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The additional increase request brings the US’s total exemption for the year 2005 to 9,400 metric tons of methyl bromide, more than all other nations’ requests combined, and well over the 7,674 metric tons used by US agribusiness in 2002.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1021/es0532133|title=Conservation first in Canadian Arctic – Methyl bromide phaseout drags|year=2005|last1=Pelley|first1=Janet|last2=Burke|first2=Maria|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=39|issue=6|pages=127A–127A[/tpl]
In January 2004, Interior Secretary Gale Norton approved a move to open nearly [tpl]convert|9000000|acre|km2[/tpl] of Alaska's North Slope to oil and gas development, citing claims from the energy industry that nearly [tpl]convert|13|Goilbbl|m3[/tpl] of oil could be extracted from the region. The North Slope borders the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a sanctuary and habitat for migratory birds, whales, seals and other wildlife. Reports from the U.S. Geological Survey, however, estimate that less than one-third of the reported [tpl]convert|13|Goilbbl|m3[/tpl] is economically recoverable in the entire [tpl]convert|23500000|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] National Petroleum Reserve.The Bush Record – January 2004 Actions.

In July 2005 the Environmental Protection Agency decided to delay the release of an annual report on fuel economy. The report shows that automakers have taken advantage of loopholes in US fuel economy regulations to manufacture vehicles that are less fuel-efficient than they were in the late 1980s. Fuel-efficiency had on average dropped six percent during that period, from 22.1 miles per gallon to 20.8 mpg. Evidence suggests that the administration’s decision to delay the report’s release was because of its potential to affect Congress’s upcoming final vote on an energy bill six years in the making, which turned a blind eye to fuel economy regulations.E.P.A.

In May 2006, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) allegedly blocked release of a report that suggested global warming had been a contributor to the frequency and strength of hurricanes in recent years. In February, NOAA (part of the Department of Commerce) set up a seven-member panel of climate scientists to compile the report. The panel’s chair, Ants Leema, received an e-mail from a Commerce Department official asking for the report to not be released as it needed to be made “less technical.”[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/27/AR2006092700251.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Randolph E. | last=Schmid | accessdate=May 22, 2010 | title=Journal: Agency Blocked Hurricane Report | date=September 27, 2006[/tpl] NOAA would later go on to say that the report was not released because it “was not complete” and was in reality not a report, but a “two-page fact sheet about the issue.”[tpl]cite journal|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100309071259/http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/assets/binaries/nature-article |title=Is US hurricane report being quashed? |journal=Nature |volume=443 |date=September 28, 2006 |page=378 |doi=10.1038/443378a|last1=Giles|first1=Jim |issue=7110[/tpl]

==Legacy==

On January 15, 2009, Bush gave a nationally televised farewell address in the East Room of the White House. He discussed many of his decisions and cited the fact that he had kept the country safe since September 11, 2001, as a major accomplishment. Bush stated, "I have always acted with the best interests of our country in mind. I have followed my conscience and done what I thought was right." He also said that the United States must continue promoting human liberty, human rights, and human dignity around the world. One of his final lines was "We have faced danger and trial, and there's more ahead. But with the courage of our people and confidence in our ideals, this great nation will never tire, never falter and never fail."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/15/bush-pass-torch-highlight-accomplishments-farewell-address/ | work=Fox News | title=Bush Says Decisions in Office Kept America Safe From Attack | date=January 15, 2009[/tpl]Bush defends presidency in farewell speech – Politics – White House – msnbc.com.
