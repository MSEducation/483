Milton Teagle Simmons (born July 12, 1948), better known as Richard Simmons, is an American fitness personality and actor. Simmons promotes weight-loss programs, prominently through his Sweatin' to the Oldies line of aerobics videos and is known for his eccentric, outgoing and energetic personality.
Simmons began his weight-loss career by opening a gym called Slimmons in Beverly Hills, California, catering to the overweight, and he became widely known through exposure on television and through the popularity of his consumer products. He is often parodied and is a frequent guest of late night television talk shows, such as the Late Show with David Letterman. Simmons continues to promote health and has broadened his activities to include political activism, notably in support of a bill mandating non-competitive physical education in public schools as a part of the "No Child Left Behind" Act.[tpl]cite web|last=Ibanga |first=Imaeyen |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=6038493 |title=Richard Simmons Obesity Crusade – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=October 15, 2008 |accessdate=May 2, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Claus von Zastrow on |url=http://www.publicschoolinsights.org/kids-arent-well-rounded-theyre-justrounded |title="Kids Aren't Well-Rounded; They're Just...Rounded" | LFA: Join The Conversation |publisher=Public School Insights |date=March 27, 2008 |accessdate=May 2, 2013[/tpl]
