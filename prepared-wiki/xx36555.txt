An iceberg is a large piece of freshwater ice that has broken off a glacier or an ice shelf and is floating freely in open water.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=define%3Aiceberg&btnG=Google+Search|publisher=Google|title=Definitions of the word "Iceberg"|accessdate=2006-12-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://beyondpenguins.ehe.osu.edu/issue/icebergs-and-glaciers/common-misconceptions-about-icebergs-and-glaciers|title=Common Misconceptions about Icebergs and Glaciers|publisher=Ohio State University|quote=Icebergs float in salt water, but they are formed from freshwater glacial ice.[/tpl] It may subsequently become frozen into pack ice (one form of sea ice). As it drifts into shallower waters, it may come into contact with the seabed, a process referred to as seabed gouging by ice.

==Etymology==

The word "iceberg" is a partial loan translation from Dutch ijsberg, literally meaning ice mountain,[tpl]cite web|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=iceberg&searchmode=none|title=Iceberg|accessdate=2006-03-26[/tpl] cognate to Danish isbjerg, German Eisberg, Low Saxon Iesbarg and Swedish isberg.

==Overview==

Because the density of pure ice is about 920 kg/m³, and that of sea water about 1025 kg/m³, typically only one-tenth of the volume of an iceberg is above water. The shape of the underwater portion can be difficult to judge by looking at the portion above the surface. This has led to the expression "tip of the iceberg", for a problem or difficulty that is only a small manifestation of a larger problem.
Icebergs generally range from [tpl]convert|1|to|75|m|ft[/tpl] above sea level and weigh [tpl]convert|100000|to|200000|MT|ST[/tpl]. The largest known iceberg in the North Atlantic was [tpl]convert|168|m|ft[/tpl] above sea level, reported by the USCG icebreaker East Wind in 1958, making it the height of a 55-story building. These icebergs originate from the glaciers of western Greenland and may have an interior temperature of [tpl]convert|-15|to|-20|C|F[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/MA06/indepth/justthefacts.asp|work=Canadian Geographic|title=Facts on Icebergs|accessdate=2010-12-08[/tpl]
Though usually confined by winds and currents to move close to the coast, the largest icebergs recorded have been calved, or broken off, from the Ross Ice Shelf of Antarctica. Iceberg B-15, photographed by satellite in 2000, measured [tpl]convert|295|by|37|km|mi[/tpl], with a surface area of [tpl]convert|11000|km2|mi2[/tpl]. The largest iceberg on record was an Antarctic tabular iceberg of over [tpl]convert|31000|km2|mi2[/tpl] [tpl]convert|335|by|97|km|mi[/tpl] sighted [tpl]convert|150|mi|km[/tpl] west of Scott Island, in the South Pacific Ocean, by the USS Glacier on November 12, 1956. This iceberg was larger than Belgium.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/coldscience/2005-01-20-1956-antarctic-iceberg_x.htm |title=Antarctica shed a 208-mile-long berg in 1956|newspaper=Polar Times|volume=43|page=18|year=2005|date=2005-01-20[/tpl]
When a piece of iceberg ice melts, it makes a fizzing sound called "Bergie Seltzer". This sound is made when the water-ice interface reaches compressed air bubbles trapped in the ice. As this happens, each bubble bursts, making a 'popping' sound. The bubbles contain air trapped in snow layers very early in the history of the ice, that eventually got buried to a given depth (up to several kilometers) and pressurized as it transformed into firn then to glacial ice.

===Shape===

In addition to size classification, icebergs can be classified on the basis of their shape. The two basic types of iceberg forms are tabular and non-tabular.  Tabular icebergs have steep sides and a flat top, much like a plateau, with a length-to-height ratio of more than 5:1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/lantarea/iip/docs/AOS_2011.pdf|title=Sizes and Shapes of Icebergs|publisher=International Ice Patrol|accessdate=2006-12-20[/tpl] This type of iceberg, also known as an ice island,Weeks, W.F. (2010), On Sea Ice, University of Alaska Press, p. 399 can be quite large, as in the case of Pobeda Ice Island. Antarctic icebergs formed by breaking off from an ice shelf, such as the Ross Ice Shelf or Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, are typically tabular. The largest icebergs in the world are formed this way. Icebergs are commonly known to be 90% underwater and 10% above water, however recent studies discovered that due to the high amount of mercury found in water, these icebergs are now denser, meaning a ratio of 96% underwater and 4% above is to consider going forward.
Non-tabular icebergs have different shapes and include:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/ma06/indepth/nathistory.asp|title=Iceberg Physiology|publisher=Canadian Geographic|accessdate=2006-12-20[/tpl]

==Monitoring==

Icebergs are monitored worldwide by the U.S. National Ice Center (NIC), established in 1995, which produces analyses and forecasts of Arctic, Antarctic, Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay ice conditions. More than 95% of the data used in its sea ice analyses are derived from the remote sensors on polar-orbiting satellites that survey these remote regions of the Earth.
The NIC is the only organization that names and tracks all Antarctic Icebergs. It assigns each iceberg larger than [tpl]convert|10|nmi|km[/tpl] along at least one axis a name composed of a letter indicating its point of origin and a running number. The letters used are as follows:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~carlkop/ronne.html|publisher=NOAA|date=15 October 1998|title=New Iceberg Breaks off Ronne Ice Shelf in Antarctica|accessdate=2011-03-09[/tpl]
Iceberg B15 calved from the Ross Ice Shelf in 2000 and initially had an area of [tpl]convert|11000|km2|mi2[/tpl]. It broke apart in November 2002. The largest remaining piece of it, Iceberg B-15A, with an area of [tpl]convert|3000|km2|mi2[/tpl], was still the largest iceberg on Earth until it ran aground and split into several pieces October 27, 2005. It has been determined that the cause of the breakup was an ocean swell generated by an Alaskan storm 6 days earlier and [tpl]convert|13500|km|mi[/tpl] away.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news79026480.html|title=Alaskan storm cracks giant iceberg to pieces in faraway Antarctica[/tpl]

==History==

In the 20th century, several scientific bodies were established to study and monitor the icebergs. The International Ice Patrol, formed in 1914 in response to the Titanic disaster, monitors iceberg dangers near the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and provides the "limits of all known ice" in that vicinity to the maritime community.

===Technology history===

Before April 1912 there was no system in place to track icebergs to guard ships against collisions. The sinking of the RMS Titanic, which caused the deaths of 1,514 of its 2,223 passengers, created the demand for a system to observe icebergs. For the remainder of the ice season of that year, the United States Navy patrolled the waters and monitored ice flow. In November 1913, the International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea met in London to devise a more permanent system of observing icebergs. Within three months the participating maritime nations had formed the International Ice Patrol (IIP). The goal of the IIP was to collect data on meteorology and oceanography to measure currents, ice-flow, ocean temperature, and salinity levels. They published their first records in 1921, which allowed for a year-by-year comparison of iceberg movement.
New technologies monitor icebergs. Aerial surveillance of the seas in the early 1930s allowed for the development of charter systems that could accurately detail the ocean currents and iceberg locations. In 1945, experiments tested the effectiveness of radar in detecting icebergs. A decade later, oceanographic monitoring outposts were established for the purpose of collecting data; these outposts continue to serve in environmental study. A computer was first installed on a ship for the purpose of oceanographic monitoring in 1964, which allowed for a faster evaluation of data. By the 1970s, icebreaking ships were equipped with automatic transmissions of satellite photographs of ice in Antarctica. Systems for optical satellites had been developed but were still limited by weather conditions. In the 1980s, drifting buoys were used in Antarctic waters for oceanographic and climate research. They are equipped with sensors that measure ocean temperature and currents. 
Side looking airborne radar (SLAR) made it possible to acquire images regardless of weather conditions. On November 4, 1995, Canada launched RADARSAT-1. Developed by the Canadian Space Agency, it provides images of Earth for scientific and commercial purposes. This system was the first to use synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which sends microwave energy to the ocean surface and records the reflections to track icebergs. The European Space Agency launched ENVISAT (an observation satellite that orbits the Earth's poles)[tpl]cite web|url=https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/missions/esa-operational-eo-missions/envisat|title=Envisat|publisher=European Space Agency|accessdate=2011-03-09[/tpl] on March 1, 2002. ENVISAT employs advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) technology, which can detect changes in surface height accurately. The Canadian Space Agency launched RADARSAT-2 in December 2007, which uses SAR and multipolarization modes and follows the same orbit path as RADARSAT-1.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Canadian Geographic|url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/MA06/indepth/technology_side2.asp|title=Tracking Monsters|accessdate=2006-03-29[/tpl]
