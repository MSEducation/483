==Discovery of umami taste==

Glutamate has a long history in cooking. Fermented fish sauces (garum), which are rich in glutamate, were used in ancient Rome.[tpl]cite journal |author=Smriga M, Mizukoshi T, Iwata D, Sachise E, Miyano H, Kimura T, Curtis R |title=Amino acids and minerals in ancient remnants of fish sauce (garum) sampled in the "Garum Shop" of Pompeii, Italy |journal=Journal of Food Composition and Analysis |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=442–446 |date=August 2010|doi=10.1016/j.jfca.2010.03.005[/tpl] In the late 1800s, chef Auguste Escoffier, who opened restaurants in Paris and London, created meals that combined umami with salty, sour, sweet and bitter tastes. He did not know the chemical source of this unique quality, however.
Umami was first scientifically identified in 1908 by Kikunae Ikeda,[tpl]cite journal |author=Ikeda K |title=New seasonings |journal=Chemical Senses |volume=27 |issue=9 |pages=847–9 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12438213 |doi=10.1093/chemse/27.9.847[/tpl] (partial translation of [tpl]cite journal | last=Ikeda | first=Kikunae | title=New Seasoningsjapan. | journal=Journal of the Chemical Society of Tokyo | year= 1909 | volume=30 | pages= 820–836[/tpl]) a professor of the Tokyo Imperial University. He found that glutamate was responsible for the palatability of the broth from kombu seaweed. He noticed that the taste of kombu dashi was distinct from sweet, sour, bitter and salty and named it umami.
Professor Shintaro Kodama, a disciple of Ikeda, discovered in 1913 that dried bonito flakes contained another umami substance.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kodama S |journal=Journal of the Chemical Society of Japan|volume=34|page=751|year=1913[/tpl] This was the ribonucleotide IMP. In 1957, Akira Kuninaka realized that the ribonucleotide GMP present in shiitake mushrooms also conferred the umami taste.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kuninaka A |journal=Journal of the Agricultural Chemical Society of Japan|volume=34|pages=487–492|year=1960[/tpl] One of Kuninaka's most important discoveries was the synergistic effect between ribonucleotides and glutamate. When foods rich in glutamate are combined with ingredients that have ribonucleotides, the resulting taste intensity is higher than the sum of both ingredients.
This synergy of umami explains various classical food pairings, starting with why Japanese make dashi with kombu seaweed and dried bonito flakes, and continuing with various other dishes: the Chinese add Chinese leek and Chinese cabbage to chicken soup, as in the similar Scottish dish of cock-a-leekie soup, and the Italians combine Parmesan cheese on tomato sauce with mushrooms.

==Properties of umami taste==

Umami has a mild but lasting aftertaste that is difficult to describe. It induces salivation and a sensation of furriness on the tongue, stimulating the throat, the roof and the back of the mouth.[tpl]cite journal |author= Yamaguchi S |title=Basic properties of umami and its effects on food flavor |journal=Food Reviews International |volume=14 |issue=2&3 |pages=139–176 |year=1998 |doi= 10.1080/87559129809541156[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author= Uneyama H, Kawai M, Sekine-Hayakawa Y, Torii K|title=Contribution of umami taste substances in human salivation during meal|journal=Journal of Medical Investigation |volume=56 |issue=supplement|pages=197–204 |date=August 2009 |pmid=20224181|doi=10.2152/jmi.56.197[/tpl] By itself, umami is not palatable, but it makes a great variety of foods pleasant especially in the presence of a matching aroma.[tpl]cite journal |author= Edmund Rolls|title=Functional neuroimaging of umami taste: what makes umami pleasant?|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=90 |issue=supplement|pages=804S–813S |date=September 2009 |pmid=19571217 |doi=10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462R[/tpl] But like other basic tastes, with the exception of sucrose, umami is pleasant only within a relatively narrow concentration range.
The optimum umami taste depends also on the amount of salt, and at the same time, low-salt foods can maintain a satisfactory taste with the appropriate amount of umami.[tpl]cite journal |author= Yamaguchi S, Takahashi|title=Interactions of monosodium glutamate and sodium chloride on saltiness and palatability of a clear soup|journal=Journal of Food Science |volume=49 |pages=82–85 |year=1984 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2621.1984.tb13675.x |last2= Takahashi |first2= Chikahito [/tpl] In fact, Roininen et al. showed that ratings on pleasantness, taste intensity and ideal saltiness of low-salt soups were greater when the soup contained umami, whereas low-salt soups without umami were less pleasant.[tpl]cite journal |author= Roininen K, Lahteenmaki K, Tuorila H|title=Effect of umami taste on pleasantness of low salt soups during repeated testing|journal=Physiology & Behavior |volume=60 |issue=3|pages=953–958 |date=September 1996 |pmid=8873274 |doi=10.1016/0031-9384(96)00098-4[/tpl]
Some population groups, such as the elderly, may benefit from umami taste because their taste and smell sensitivity is impaired by age and medicine. The loss of taste and smell can contribute to poor nutrition, increasing their risk of disease.[tpl]cite journal |author= Yamamoto S, Tomoe M, Toyama K, Kawai M, Uneyama H|title=Can dietary supplementation of monosodium glutamate improve the health of the elderly? |journal=Am J Clin Nutr |volume=90 |issue=3|pages=844S–849S |date=July 2009 |pmid=19571225|doi=10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462X[/tpl]

==Foods rich in umami==

Many foods that may be consumed daily are rich in umami. Naturally occurring glutamate can be found in meats and vegetables, whereas inosinate comes primarily from meats and guanylate from vegetables. Thus, umami taste is common to foods that contain high levels of L-glutamate, IMP and GMP, most notably in fish, shellfish, cured meats, mushrooms, vegetables (e.g., ripe tomatoes, Chinese cabbage, spinach, celery, etc.)  or green tea, and fermented and aged products (e.g., cheeses, shrimp pastes, soy sauce, etc.).[tpl]cite journal |author= Ninomiya K |title=Natural Occurrence|journal=Food Reviews International|volume=14 |issue=2&3|pages=177–211 |year=1998 |doi= 10.1080/87559129809541157[/tpl]
Many humans' first encounter with umami is breast milk.[tpl]cite journal |author= Agostini C, Carratu B, Riva E, Sanzini E |title=Free amino acid content in standard infant formulas: comparison with human milk|journal=Journal of the American College of Nutrition |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=434–438 |date=August 2000 |pmid=10963461[/tpl] It contains roughly the same amount of umami as broths.
There are some distinctions among stocks from different countries. In dashi, L-glutamate comes from sea kombu (Laminaria japonica) and inosinate from dried bonito flakes (katsuobushi) or small dried sardines (niboshi).

==Taste receptors==

Most taste buds on the tongue and other regions of the mouth can detect umami taste, irrespective of their location. The tongue map in which different tastes are distributed in different regions of the tongue is a common misconception. Biochemical studies have identified the taste receptors responsible for the sense of umami as modified forms of mGluR4, mGluR1 and taste receptor type 1 (T1R1 + T1R3), all of which have been found in all regions of the tongue bearing taste buds.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chaudhari N, Landin AM, Roper SD |title=A metabotropic glutamate receptor variant functions as a taste receptor |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=113–119 |year=2000 |pmid= 10649565 |doi=10.1038/72053[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Nelson G |title=An amino-acid taste receptor |journal=Nature |volume=416 |issue=6877 |pages=199–202 |year=2002 |pmid=11894099 |doi=10.1038/nature726 |author-separator=, |author2=Chandrashekar J |author3=Hoon MA |display-authors=3 |last4=Feng |first4=Luxin |last5=Zhao |first5=Grace |last6=Ryba |first6=Nicholas J. P. |last7=Zuker |first7=Charles S.[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=San Gabriel A, Uneyama H, Yoshie S, Torii K |title=Cloning and characterization of a novel mGluR1 variant from vallate papillae that functions as a receptor for L-glutamate stimuli|journal=Chem Senses |volume=30 |issue=Suppl |pages=i25–i26 |year=2005 |pmid=15738140 |doi=10.1093/chemse/bjh095[/tpl] The New York Academy of Sciences corroborated the acceptance of these receptors, stating, "Recent molecular biological studies have now identified strong candidates for umami receptors, including the heterodimer T1R1/T1R3, and truncated type 1 and 4 metabotropic glutamate receptors missing most of the N-terminal extracellular domain (taste-mGluR4 and truncated-mGluR1) and brain-mGluR4." Receptors mGluR1 and mGluR4 are specific to glutamate whereas T1R1 + T1R3 are responsible for the synergism already described by Akira Kuninaka in 1957. However, the specific role of each type of receptor in taste bud cells remains unclear. They are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with similar signaling molecules that include G proteins beta-gamma, PLCb2 and PI3-mediated release of calcium (Ca2+) from intracellular stores.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kinnamon SC|title=Taste receptor signaling — from tongues to lungs|journal=Acta Physiol|year=2011|pmid= 21481196|doi=10.1111/j.1748-1716.2011.02308.x |pages=no–no[/tpl] Ca2+ activates the selective cation channel transient receptor potential melastatin 5 (TrpM5) that leads to membrane depolarization and the consequent release of ATP and secretion of neurotransmitters including serotonin.[tpl]cite journal |author=Perez CA, Huang L, Rong M, Kozak JA, Preuss AK, Zhang H, Max M, Margolskee RF |title=A transient receptor potential channel expression in taste receptor cells|journal=Nat Neurosci|year=2002|volume=5|issue=11|pages=1169–76|pmid= 12368808|doi=10.1038/nn952[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Zhang Y, Hoon MA, Chandrashekar J, Mueller KL, Cook B, Wu D, Zuker CS, Ryba NJ|title=Coding sweet, bitter, and umami tastes: different receptor cells sharing signaling pathways|journal=Cell|year=2003|volume=112|issue=3|pages=293–301|pmid= 12581520 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00071-0[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Dando R, Roper SD|title=Cell-to-cell communication in intact taste buds through ATP and signalling from pannexin 1 gap junction hemichannels|journal=J Physiol|year=2009|volume=587|issue=2|pages=5899–906|pmid= |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2009.180083[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Roper SD |title=Signal transduction and information processing in mammalian taste buds |journal=Pflügers Archiv |volume=454 |issue=5 |pages=759–76 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17468883 |doi=10.1007/s00424-007-0247-x[/tpl] Cells responding to umami taste stimuli do not possess typical synapses, but ATP conveys taste signals to gustatory nerves and in turn to the brain that interprets and identifies the taste quality.[tpl]cite journal |author=Clapp TR, Yang R, Stoick CL, Kinnamon SC, Kinnamon JC|journal=J Comp Neurol|year=2004|volume=468|issue=3|pages=311–321|pmid= 14681927|doi=10.1002/cne.10963 |title=Morphologic characterization of rat taste receptor cells that express components of the phospholipase C signaling pathway[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Iwatsuki K, Ichikawa R, Hiasa M, Moriyama Y, Torii K, Uneyama H|journal=Biochem Bhiphys Res Commun|year=2009|volume=388|issue=1|pages=1–5|pmid= 19619506 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.07.069 |title=Identification of the vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) in taste cells[/tpl]

==In popular culture==

Umami has become popular with food manufacturers such as Nestlé, the Campbell Soup Company and Frito Lay. Farmers promote their produce as a way to boost umami taste, and chefs create "umami bombs", which are dishes made of several umami ingredients.[tpl]cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB119706514515417586 |author=Katy McLaughlin. |title=A New Taste Sensation. |publisher=Wall Street Journal.
