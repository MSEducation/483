Olabimtan achieved a PhD at the University of Lagos in African Languages.  He became an expert in the Yoruba language, and wrote a number of novels in the tongue, such as Kekere Ekun in 1967 and Ayanmo in 1973. 
In 1999, Olabimatan was elected as a senator for the Alliance for Democracy party for Ogun West. He served just one term, standing down in 2003 in order to allow a younger successor to take his place.[tpl]cite news | title = Olabimtan: Obasanjo Condoles Daniel | url = http://www.thisdayonline.com/archive/2003/09/02/20030902pol03.html | first = Josephine | last = Lohor | date = 2004-11-15 | accessdate = 2006-08-01 | publisher = Thisday [/tpl] Later in the same year he was killed in a motor accident.
His death preceded the release of his autobiography, The Graces, the Grass and the Gains. This contained the claim that, in a 1994 meeting, a number of Yoruba leaders had supported the continued imprisonment of Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola, in return for bribes in the form of money and political positions.[tpl]cite news | title = Secret document exposes Yoruba betrayal of MKO | url = http://news.biafranigeriaworld.com/archive/2003/oct/03/144.html | first = Sola | last = Shittu | date = 2003-10-03 | accessdate = 2006-08-01 [/tpl]  Those accused of attending the meeting, such as Ebenezer Babatope, have denied knowledge of it.
