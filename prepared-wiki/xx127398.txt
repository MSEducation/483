Joey Gregorash is a musician from Winnipeg, Manitoba who became the first solo Manitoba act to win a Juno Award in 1972 for Outstanding Performance-Male. He started his career with local Winnipeg band the Mongrels. In the early 1970s, besides the Juno Award, Joey recorded a number of singles for Polydor Records and a string of Canadian hit singles, such as "Jodie" and his cover of Neil Young's "Down by the River."
In 1987, after years of inactivity, he returned to the charts with "Together (The New Wedding Song)" which to this day is a popular song at weddings.
Gregorash hosted "S'kiddle Bits," a noon hour children's variety television show on CKY-TV.  It ran through the late-1980s and early-1990s and featured in-studio and on-location musical performances and guests from around Manitoba.
