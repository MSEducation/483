Duke Paoa Kahinu Mokoe Hulikohola Kahanamoku (August 24, 1890 – January 22, 1968) was a Hawaiian competition swimmer who was also known as an actor, lawman, early beach volleyball player and businessman credited with spreading the sport of surfing.[tpl]cite book |title=Duke: A Great Hawaiian |last=Hall |first=Sandra Kimberly. |year=2004 |publisher=Bess Press |location=Honolulu, HI |isbn=1-57306-230-8 |pages= |url= [/tpl]  Kahanamoku was a five-time Olympic medalist in swimming.

==Early years==

"Duke" was not a title or a nickname, but a given name. He was named after his father, Duke Halapu Kahanamoku, who was christened by Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop in honor of Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who was visiting Hawaii at the time. The younger Duke, as eldest son, inherited the name. His father was a policeman. His mother Julia Pa[tpl]okina[/tpl]akonia Lonokahikina Paoa was a deeply religious woman with a strong sense of family ancestry. 
When Duke became a household name due to his swimming feats, many people thought he was of Hawaiian royalty. It was assumed by many that he was a duke and that it was his title. He was a very modest and unassuming man who got a chuckle of being thought of as royalty and never hesitated to set the record straight about his lineage.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.calodges.org/ncrl/duke-k.html |title=Duke Kahanamoku Paoa |author=Herbert G. Gardiner, PGS, Grand Historian |accessdate=2011-03-22 [/tpl]
His parents were from prominent Hawaiian families; the Kahanamoku and the Paoa clans were considered to be kaukauali[tpl]okina[/tpl]is,King Kalākaua's father Kapaʻakea was a kaukauali[tpl]okina[/tpl]i. lower-ranking chiefs or nobles, who were of service to the aliʻi nui or royalty. His grandfather Kahanamoku and grandmother Kapiolani Kaoehasometimes spelled Kahoea were kahu, retainers and trusted advisors of the Kamehamehas.[tpl]rp|9[/tpl]
His birthplace is disputed with many sources stating Haleakalā on Maui or Waikiki on Oahu. According to Kahanamoku, he stated he was born at Honolulu at Haleʻākala, the home of Bernice Pauahi Bishop which was later converted into the Arlington Hotel.[tpl]cite book |title= Duke Kahanamoku: Twentieth Century Hawaiian Nonarch |year=2006 |publisher=ProQuest | pages =1–13  |last=Nendel |first=James D. |last2= The Pennsylvania State University | ISBN =0-542-84320-X |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rSKo0rK3xYsC[/tpl] He had five brothers and three sisters, including Samuel Kahanamoku. In 1893, the family moved to Kālia, Waikiki (near the present site of the Hilton Hawaiian Village), to be closer to his mother's parents and family. Duke grew up with his siblings and 31 Paoa cousins.[tpl]rp|17[/tpl] Duke attended the Waikiki Grammar School, Kaahumanu School, and the Kamehameha Schools, although he never graduated because he had quit to help support the family.
Growing up on the outskirts of Waikiki, Kahanamoku spent his youth as a bronzed beach boy. At Waikiki Beach he developed his surfing and swimming skills. In his youth, Kahanamoku preferred a traditional surf board, which he called his "papa nui", constructed after the fashion of ancient Hawaiian "olo" boards. Made from the wood of a koa tree, it was [tpl]convert|16|ft|m[/tpl] long and weighed [tpl]convert|114|lb|kg[/tpl]. The board was without a skeg, which had yet to be invented. In his later career, he would often use smaller boards but always preferred those made of wood.
On August 11, 1911, Kahanamoku was timed at 55.4 seconds in the [tpl]convert|100|yd|m[/tpl] freestyle, beating the existing world record by 4.6 seconds, in the salt water of Honolulu Harbor. He also broke the record in the [tpl]convert|220|yd|m|abbr=on[/tpl] and equaled it in the [tpl]convert|50|yd|m|abbr=on[/tpl]. But the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), in disbelief, would not recognize these feats until many years later. The AAU initially claimed that the judges must have been using alarm clocks rather than stopwatches and later claimed that ocean currents aided Kahanamoku."Duke Kahanamoku. Notable Asian Americans.

==Career and legacy==

thumb|The Salt Lake Tribune featuring Duke Kahanamoku in 1913Kahanamoku easily qualified for the U.S. Olympic swimming team in 1912, breaking the record for the 200 meter freestyle in his trial heat for the 4×200 relay. He went on to win a gold medal in the 100 meter freestyle in the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, and a silver with the relay team. During the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp, he won gold medals both in the 100 meters (bettering fellow Hawaiian Pua Kealoha) and in the relay. He finished the 100 meters with a silver medal during the 1924 Olympics in Paris, with the gold going to Johnny Weissmuller and the bronze to Duke's brother, Samuel Kahanamoku. He also played for the U.S. water polo team at the 1932 Summer Olympics.
Between Olympic competitions, and after retiring from the Olympics, Kahanamoku traveled internationally to give swimming exhibitions. It was during this period that he popularized the sport of surfing, previously known only in Hawaii, by incorporating surfing exhibitions into these visits as well. His surfing exhibition at Sydney's Freshwater Beach on December 23, 1914 is widely regarded as a seminal event in the development of surfing in Australia.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Osmond, Gary. | year = 2010 | title = 'Honolulu Māori': Racial Dimensions of Duke Kahanamoku's Tour of Australia and New Zealand | url =  | journal = New Zealand Journal of History | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–34 [/tpl] The board that Kahanamoku built from a piece of pine from a local hardware store is retained by the Freshwater Surf Club. There is a statue of Kahanamoku on the headland at Freshwater. He made surfing popular in mainland America first in 1912 while in Southern California.
During his time living in Southern California, Kahanamoku performed in Hollywood as a background actor and a character actor in several films. In this way, he made connections with people who could further publicize the sport of surfing. Kahanamoku was involved with the Los Angeles Athletic Club, acting as lifeguard and competing on both swimming and water polo teams. 
While living in Newport Beach, California on June 14, 1925, Kahanamoku rescued eight men from a fishing vessel that capsized in heavy surf while attempting to enter the city's harbor.[tpl]cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Kahanamoku Helps Save 13 In Launch.

Newport's police chief at the time called Duke's efforts "the most superhuman surfboard rescue act the world has ever seen." 
In 1940, he married Nadine Alexander, who accompanied him when he traveled. Kahanamoku was the first person to be inducted into both the Swimming Hall of Fame and the Surfing Hall of Fame. The Duke Kahanamoku Invitational Surfing Championships are named in his honor. He is a member of the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame. He served as sheriff of Honolulu, Hawaii from 1932 to 1961, serving 13 consecutive terms. During this period, he also appeared in a number of television programs and films, such as Mister Roberts (1955).
Kahanamoku was a friend and surfing companion of heiress Doris Duke, who built a home (now a museum) on Oahu named Shangri-la.
Hawaii music promoter Kimo Wilder McVay capitalized on Kahanamoku's popularity by naming his Waikiki showroom "Duke Kahanamoku's", and giving Kahanamoku a piece of the financial action in exchange for the use of his name. It was a major Waikiki showroom in the 1960s and is remembered as the home of Don Ho & The Aliis from 1964 through 1969. 
Kahanamoku's name is also used by Duke's Canoe Club & Barefoot Bar, a beachfront bar and restaurant in the Outrigger Waikiki On The Beach Hotel. There is a chain of restaurants named after him in California and Hawaii called Duke's. A bronze statue at Waikiki beach in Honolulu honors his memory. It shows Kahanamoku standing in front of his surfboard with his arms outstretched. Many honor him by placing leis on his statue. There is a webcam watching the statue, allowing visitors from around the world to wave to their friends.
On August 24, 2002, which was also the 112th anniversary of the birth of Duke Kahanamoku, a 37c first-class letter rate postage stamp of the United States Postal Service with Duke's picture on, was issued. The First Day Ceremony was held at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki and was attended by thousands. At this ceremony, attendees could attach the Duke stamp to an envelope and get it canceled with a First Day of Issue postmark. These First Day Covers are very collectable.USPS - July 30, 2002 - Father Of International Surfing To Be Honored On New Postage Stamp

==Duncan v. Kahanamoku==

Kahanamoku was the pro forma defendant in the landmark Supreme Court case Duncan v. Kahanamoku. While Kahanamoku was a military police officer during World War II, he arrested Duncan for public intoxication. At the time, Hawaii, not yet a state, was being administered under the Hawaiian Organic Act which effectively instituted martial law on the island. Duncan was therefore tried by a military tribunal and appealed to the Supreme Court. In a post hoc ruling, the court ruled that trial by military tribunal was, in this case, unconstitutional.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.answers.com/topic/duncan-v-kahanamoku | title=Answers.com - Duncan v.
