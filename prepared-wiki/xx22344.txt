Mumps  (epidemic parotitis) is a viral disease of the human species, caused by the mumps virus. Before the development of vaccination and the introduction of a  vaccine, it was a common childhood disease worldwide. It is still a significant threat to health in developing countries, and outbreaks still occur sporadically in developed countries.[tpl]cite book | author = Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, Hauser SL, Longo DL, Jameson JL, Isselbacher KJ, Eds. | title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine | edition = 16th | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-07-140235-7 [/tpl]
Painful swelling of the salivary glands – classically the parotid gland – is the most typical presentation. Painful testicular swelling (orchitis) and rash may also occur. The symptoms are generally not severe in children. In teenage males and men, complications such as infertility or subfertility are more common, although still rare in absolute terms.[tpl]cite journal | author=Preveden T, Jovanovic J, Ristic D |title=(title in Croatian) | trans_title=Fertility in men after mumps infection without manifestations of orchitis |language=Croatian | journal=Med Pregl | year=1996 | pages=99–102 | volume=49 | issue=3–4 | pmid=8692089 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author=Shakhov EV, Krupin VN |title=(title in Russian) | trans_title=The clinico-statistical characteristics of the testicular generative function in male subfertility following mumps |language=Russian | journal=Urol Nefrol (Mosk) | year=1990 | pages=46–50 | volume= | issue=2 | pmid=2368216 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author=Tsvetkov D |title=(title in Bulgarian) | trans_title=Spermatological disorders in patients with postmumps orchitis |language=Bulgarian | journal=Akush Ginekol (Sofiia) | year=1990 | pages=46–9 | volume=29 | issue=6 | pmid=2100952 [/tpl] The disease is generally self-limiting, running its course before receding, with no specific treatment apart from controlling the symptoms with pain medication.
Fever and headache are prodromal symptoms of mumps, together with malaise and anorexia. Other symptoms of mumps can include dry mouth, sore face and/or ears and occasionally in more serious cases, loss of voice. In addition, up to 20% of persons infected with the mumps virus do not show symptoms, so it is possible to be infected and spread the virus without knowing it.[tpl]Citation |date=December 2008 |title=FAQ For Young Adults |at=Could I be infected with mumps without knowing it? |publisher=Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care |url=http://www.health.gov.on.ca/cs/mumps/english/faq/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090426040001/http://www.health.gov.on.ca/cs/mumps/english/faq/ |archivedate=April 26, 2009 [/tpl]
