[tpl]nihongo|Hirotaka Suzuoki|鈴置 洋孝|Suzuoki Hirotaka|March 6, 1950 – August 6, 2006[/tpl] was a Japanese voice actor and actor from Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture who graduated from Tokyo Keizai University.
His best known roles include Mobile Suit Gundam (Bright Noa), Captain Tsubasa (Kojirou Hyuga), Saint Seiya (Dragon Shiryū), Dragon Ball (Tenshinhan), The Transformers (Starscream), Ranma ½ (Tatewaki Kuno), Rurouni Kenshin (Saitō Hajime), Pokémon (Giovanni), and Invincible Steel Man Daitarn 3 (Banjō Haran).

In 2006, Suzuoki died at the age of 56 as a result of lung cancer.[tpl]cite web | date=August 11, 2006 | title=Gundam Voice Actor Dies | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-08-10/gundam-voice-actor-dies | publisher=Anime News Network | accessdate=2008-11-25[/tpl]

==Career==

Suzuoki's most notable trait is his soft, dignified voice. He was affiliated with Ken Production, in which he worked in many animation roles.
In 1978, Suzuoki made his voice acting debut in Invincible Steel Man Daitarn 3.
Suzuoki was a best friend of fellow voice actor Toru Furuya, who co-starred with him in several different series. Ironically, Suzuoki felt that Furuya's Dragon Ball Yamcha character was closer to his own personality, rather than Tenshinhan whom Suzuoki played.[tpl]cite web | date=March 30, 2004 | title=TV Anime Guide: Dragon Ball Tenka’ichi Densetsu | url=http://www.kanzenshuu.com/translations/tenkaichi-densetsu-hirotaka-suzuoki/ | publisher=Kanzenshuu | accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl]
On July 2006, Suzuoki was diagnosed with lung cancer and undertook hospitalization and medical treatment, but on the morning of August 6, 2006, his health declined, and Suzuoki died at the age of 56.
His last voicing role was the voice of Bright Noa in Mobile Suit Z Gundam III: Love is the Pulse of the Stars, which was seen by fans as the best sendoff in Suzuoki's name.

Note: Another Century's Episode 3, which was produced after the death of Hirotaka Suzuoki, re-used the voice tracks that has been recorded for A.C.E.1 (which also become the first title with Bright's voice after Hirotaka Suzuoki's death), making it the first game involving Bright Noa to re-use a prior recording. With characters whose voice actors are deceased, Banpresto traditionally reuses prior recordings in this way rather than record new lines with a different actor - it is expected that future productions involving Bright Noa and Haran Banjou will continue to use Suzuoki's voice.
