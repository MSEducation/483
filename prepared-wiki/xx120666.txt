From 1993 to 2013, the former 11th district had encompassed most of the city of Tampa and its suburbs and the shoreline of southeastern Hillsborough County. It also included two areas in other counties: urban neighborhoods of south St. Petersburg in Pinellas County and neighborhoods in and around Bradenton in Manatee County. 
The district is currently represented by Republican Rich Nugent.

==Historical district boundaries==

Over 3 decades earlier, from 1983 to 1993, the district was based in Brevard County, including the Kennedy Space Center. In 1986, weeks before the Challenger disaster, the district's then-congressman, Bill Nelson, (now Florida's Senior Senator) flew on board the Space Shuttle Columbia as part of mission STS-61-C.
From 1993 to 2013 the district was based in Tampa plus the shoreline of Tampa Bay; the city's long-serving congressman Sam Gibbons, retired in 1997 after nearly 35 years in the House.
