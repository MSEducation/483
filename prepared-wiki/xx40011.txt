Felicity Ann Kendal, CBE (born 25 September 1946) is an English actress known for her television and stage work. Kendal has appeared in numerous stage and screen roles over a 45-year career, but the role that brought attention to her career was that of Barbara Good in the 1975 television series The Good Life.

==Early life==

Felicity Kendal was born in Olton, Warwickshire, England, in 1946. She is the younger daughter of Geoffrey Kendal, an actor and manager, and his wife Laura (née Lidell). Her sister, Jennifer Kendal (died 1984, aged 51), also became an actress.
After early years in Birmingham, Kendal went to India with her family at age seven: her father was an English actor-manager who led his own repertory company on tours of India. The ensemble would perform Shakespeare before royalty one day, and in rough rural villages the next where audiences included many schoolchildren.[tpl]sfn|Kendal|1998[/tpl] Her father had adopted his birthplace of Kendal (then Westmorland now Cumbria) as his stage name, his original surname being Bragg.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] As the family traveled, Felicity Kendal attended six Loreto College convent schools in India, http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03m7hk6 and contracted typhoid fever in Calcutta at age 17. She left India at the age of 20.

==The Good Life==

In 1975 Kendal had her big break on television with the BBC sitcom The Good Life. She and Richard Briers starred as Barbara and Tom Good – a middle-class suburban couple who decide to quit the rat race and become self-sufficient, much to the consternation of their snooty but well-meaning neighbour Margo and her down to earth husband Jerry Leadbetter (played by Penelope Keith and Paul Eddington). Kendal appeared in all 30 episodes which extended over four series from 1975 to 1978.
Kendal has stated that she can be "short-tempered and difficult" – which is in contrast to the character of Barbara – with whom the public have come to associate her.

==Stage work==

Kendal made her stage debut aged nine months, when she was carried on stage as a changeling boy in A Midsummer Night's Dream.
She made her London stage debut in Minor Murder (1967), and went on to star in a number of well regarded plays.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
Kendal's stage career blossomed during the 1980s and 1990s when she formed a close professional association with Sir Tom Stoppard, starring in the first productions of many of his plays, including The Real Thing (1982), Hapgood (1988), Arcadia (1993), and Indian Ink (1995). This last was originally a radio play and the role was written for her.
She won the Evening Standard Theatre Award in 1989 for her performances in Much Ado About Nothing and Ivanov.
In 2002, Kendal starred in Charlotte Jones's play, Humble Boy, when it transferred from the National Theatre to the West End. In 2006 she starred in the West End revival of Amy's View by David Hare.
In 2008 she appeared in the West End in a revival of Noël Coward's play The Vortex.
In 2009 she appeared in the play The Last Cigarette (by Simon Gray) and in 2010 in Mrs Warren's Profession (by Shaw). Both played at the Chichester Festival Theatre and subsequently in the West End.
In October 2013 she began a UK tour starring with Simon Callow in Chin-Chin, an English translation by Willis Hall of Francois Billetdoux's Tchin-Tchin
In 2013 she will star in the first London revival of Relatively Speaking by Alan Ayckbourn.

The affair with Stoppard ended in 1998, and Kendal has since reunited with Michael Rudman.
