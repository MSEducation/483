Libya has been governed under a temporary Constitutional Declaration since the defeat of the previous government in the 2011 civil war. Under the Declaration, Libya is a parliamentary republic governed by the General National Congress (GNC), which was elected in July 2012. The executive branch is appointed by the GNC and led by the Prime Minister, while the President of the GNC is the de facto head of state, though not explicitly described as such in the Declaration.[tpl]cite news|title=Libya leader Magarief vows to disband illegal militias|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19691510|accessdate=6 January 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=23 September 2013|quote=Mr Magarief, the parliamentary speaker who acts as head of state until elections next year.[/tpl]
The main responsibility of the GNC is to form a constituent assembly which will write Libya's permanent constitution, for approval by a referendum. The law of Libya is based on sharia.http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/12/libya-assembly-votes-sharia-law-2013124153217603439.html[/ref]

==Recent Changes==

Political parties were banned in Libya from 1972 until the collapse of the Gaddafi government, and all elections were nonpartisan under law. However during the revolution, the National Transitional Council (NTC), a body formed on 27 February 2011 by anti-Gaddafi forces to act as the "political face of the revolution", made the introduction of multiparty democracy a cornerstone of its agenda. In June 2011, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi said his father would agree to internationally monitored general elections, and would step down if he lost them, but his offer was refused by the rebels and ignored by the UN Security Council.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/16/us-libya-idUSTRE7270JP20110616|date=16 June 2011|accessdate=18 September 2011|agency=Reuters|title=Rebels dismiss election offer, NATO pounds Tripoli[/tpl]
On 8 March, the NTC issued a statement in which it declared itself to be the "sole representative all over Libya".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/ferocious-battles-in-libya-as-national-council-meets-for-first-time/story-e6frfku0-1226016536676 | work=NewsCore | title=Ferocious battles in Libya as national council meets for first time | date=6 March 2011[/tpl]
The council formed an interim governing body on 23 March. As of 20 October 100 countries declared full support to the council by severing all relations with Gaddafi's rule and recognizing the National Transitional Council as the rightful representative of Libya.
On 3 August 2011, the NTC issued a Constitutional Declaration which declared the statehood of Libya as a democracy with Islam as its state religion, in which the state guarantees the rule of law and an independent judiciary as well as civic and human basic rights (including freedom of religion and women's rights), and which contains provisions for a phase of transition to a presidential republic with an elected national assembly and a democratically legitimized constitution by 2013. Vice Chairman Abdul Hafiz Ghoga declared Libya to be "liberated" on 23 October 2011, announcing an official end to the war. Chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil said Libya would become an Islamic democracy in the wake of Gaddafi's death, though the extent of Islamic law's influence would be determined by elected lawmakers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2011/10/libya-declares-liberation-path-to-elections-constitution.html|agency=The Los Angeles Times|date=23 October 2011|accessdate=23 October 2011|title=Libya declares 'liberation,' path to elections, constitution[/tpl] Ghoga later confirmed that Libya will continue to adhere to all international agreements to which it was signatory prior to the uprising.[tpl]cite news|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/libya-oct-23-2011-2009|agency=Al Jazeera Blogs|accessdate=23 October 2011|title=Sun, 23 Oct 2011, 17:09 GMT+3 - Libya[/tpl]
On 7 July 2012 an election was held for the General National Congress (GNC) to replace the NTC. There were 2,501 candidates for the 200 seats - 136 for political parties and 64 for independent candidates. About 300 candidates' views were considered unacceptable and removed from candidates list, suspected of sympathizing with the defeated forces of the Jamahiriya. Accreditation centers have also been organized in European cities with larger Libyan communities like Berlin and Paris, in order to allow Libyan nationals there to cast their vote.High National Election Commission: Press Release 16.

==Libyan politics under Muammar Gadaffi==

After originally rising to power through a military coup d'etat in 1969, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's governance of Libya became increasingly centric on the teachings of his Green Book, which he published in the mid-1970s chapter by chapter as a foundation for a new form of government.[tpl]cpref|country=Libya|date=April 2005[/tpl] This jamahiriya, as he called it, was supposedly a form of direct democracy in which power was balanced between a General People's Congress, consisting of 2,700 representatives of Basic People's Congresses, and an executive  General People's Committee, headed by a General Secretary, who reported to the Prime Minister and the President. However, Gaddafi retained virtually all power, continuing to operate and control vestiges of the military junta put in place in 1969.

Interpol on 4 March 2011 issued a security alert concerning the "possible movement of dangerous individuals and assets" based on United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970, which imposed a travel ban and asset freeze.
