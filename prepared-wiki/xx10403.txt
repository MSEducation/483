In steam engines and internal combustion engines, valves are required to allow the entry and exit of gasses at the correct times in the piston's cycle. These are worked by cams, eccentrics or cranks driven by the shaft of the engine. Early designs used the D slide valve but this has been largely superseded by Piston valve or Poppet valve designs. In steam engines the point in the piston cycle at which the steam inlet valve closes is called the cutoff and this can often be controlled to adjust the torque supplied by the engine and improve efficiency. In some steam engines, the action of the valves can be replaced by an oscillating cylinder.
Internal combustion engines operate through a sequence of strokes that admit and remove gases to and from the cylinder. These operations are repeated cyclically  and an engine is said to be 2-stroke, 4-stroke or 6-stroke depending on the number of strokes it takes to complete a cycle.
In some steam engines, the cylinders may be of varying size with the smallest bore cylinder working the highest pressure steam. This is then fed through one or more, increasingly larger bore cylinders successively, to extract power from the steam at increasingly lower pressures. These engines are called Compound engines.
Aside from looking at the power that the engine can produce, the Mean Effective Pressure (MEP), can also be used in comparing the power output and performance of reciprocating engines of the same size. The mean effective pressure is a the fictitious pressure which would produce the same amount of net work that was produced during the power stroke cycle. This is shown by:
Wnet = MEP x Piston Area x Stroke = MEP x Displacement Volume  and therefore: MEP = Wnet/Displacement Volume 
Whichever engine with the larger value of MEP produces more net work per cycle and performs more efficiently. 

==History==

An early known example of rotary to reciprocating motion can be found in a number of Roman saw mills (dating to the 3rd to 6th century AD) in which a crank and connecting rod mechanism converted the rotary motion of the waterwheel into the linear movement of the saw blades.[tpl]citation|last=Ritti|first=Tullia|last2=Grewe|first2= Klaus|last3=Kessener|first3=Paul|title=A Relief of a Water-powered Stone Saw Mill on a Sarcophagus at Hierapolis and its Implications|journal=Journal of Roman Archaeology|pages=138–163|volume=20| year=2007[/tpl]
The reciprocating engine developed in Europe during the 18th century, first as the atmospheric engine then later as the steam engine. These were followed by the Stirling engine and internal combustion engine in the 19th century. Today the most common form of reciprocating engine is the internal combustion engine running on the combustion of petrol, diesel, Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or compressed natural gas (CNG) and used to power motor vehicles.
One notable reciprocating engine from the WWII Era was the 28-cylinder, [tpl]convert|3500|hp|kW|lk=in|abbr=on[/tpl] Pratt & Whitney R-4360 "Wasp Major" radial engine. It powered the last generation of large piston-engined planes before jet engines and turboprops took over from 1944 onward. It had a total engine capacity of [tpl]convert|71.5|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl], and a high power-to-weight ratio.
The largest reciprocating engine in production at present, but not the largest ever built, is the Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C  turbocharged two-stroke diesel engine of 2006 built by Japan’s Diesel United, Ltd. It is used to power the largest modern container ships such as the Emma Mærsk. It is five stories high ([tpl]convert|13.5|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on[/tpl]), [tpl]convert|27|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] long, and weighs over [tpl]convert|2,300|metric ton|short ton[/tpl] in its largest 14 cylinders version producing more than 84.42 MW (114,800 bhp). Each cylinder has a capacity of [tpl]convert|1,820|L|cuft|0|abbr=on[/tpl], making a total capacity of [tpl]convert|25,480|L|cuft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] for the largest versions.

==Engine capacity==

For piston engines, an engine's capacity is the engine displacement, in other words the volume swept by all the pistons of an engine in a single movement. It is generally measured in litres (l) or cubic inches (c.i.d. or cu in or in³) for larger engines, and cubic centimetres (abbreviated cc) for smaller engines. All else being equal, engines with greater capacities are more powerful and consumption of fuel increases accordingly, although power and fuel consumption are affected by many factors outside of engine displacement.

==Other modern non-internal combustion types==

Reciprocating engines that are powered by compressed air, steam or other hot gases are still used in some applications such as to drive many modern torpedoes or as pollution-free motive power. Most steam-driven applications use steam turbines, which are more efficient than piston engines.

Torpedoes may use a working gas produced by high test peroxide or Otto fuel II, which pressurise without combustion. The [tpl]convert|230|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] Mark 46 torpedo, for example, can travel [tpl]convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] underwater at [tpl]convert|74|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl] fuelled by Otto fuel without oxidant.

==Quantum reciprocating engine==

A theoretical study has shown that it is possible and practical to build a reciprocating engine that is composed of a single oscillating atom. This is an area for future research and could have applications in nanotechnology. Can a car engine be built out of a single particle? Physorg,  November 30, 2012 by Lisa Zyga. Accessed 01-12-12 

==Miscellaneous engines==

There are a large number of unusual varieties of piston engines that have various claimed advantages, many of which see little if any current use:
