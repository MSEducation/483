Vitameatavegamin is a fictitious health tonic imbibed by Lucy on the I Love Lucy episode "Lucy Does a TV Commercial". It is stated as an elixir containing concentrated "vitamins, meat, vegetables, and minerals" (on the commercial filming; the label showed that the main ingredient was "23% alcohol").  It promised to help people who are "tired, run-down, and listless".[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5jr9L--C4tMC&pg=PA12 |title=The Great Clowns of American Television, Karin Adir, p.12 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2012[/tpl]
During filming, Lucy was actually drinking apple pectin out of the Vitameatavegamin bottle. Originally, the Vitameatavegamin was 11% alcohol, according to a rare picture seen here, but for production, it was increased to 23%.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youns.com/lucy/lovelucy.asp?offset=29 |title=I Love Lucy, Lucy Does a TV Commercial | Everything Lucy |publisher=Youns.com |date= |accessdate=June 24, 2012[/tpl] Vitameatvegamin was apparently based on Geritol, an iron and B-vitamin elixir formulated in 1950 that was 12% alcohol.
The fictitious elixir is portrayed on multiple souvenir merchandise from cinnamon-flavored Vitameatavegamin candy, to cookie jars, to clocks.
Vitameatavegamin bottles were also seen in the Our Miss Brooks episode "Vitmin E-4" which focused on the gang at Madison High School bottling and selling a similar health tonic.[tpl]cn|date=September 2013[/tpl]
