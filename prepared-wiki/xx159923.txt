The Oregon Office of Degree Authorization (ODA) identifies two possibly unrelated entities operating under the name "American University of London", one in St. Kitts and Nevis, the United Kingdom, and Sri Lanka.

According to the AUOL prospectus, the University has "not applied for accreditation with any American nor British official accreditor". The same prospectus adds that its degrees are validated due to their "agreement with a renowned USA agency" who are able to issue Equivalency Certificates to AUOL graduates. This agency is not named. AUOL is also a member of the American Association for Higher Education and Accreditation, which is not a recognized accreditor.Thomas Bartlett, ""Inquiry Into Higher-Education Group Reveals Odd Connections," Chronicle of Higher Education, Monday, August 25, 2008
