[[Cow tipping]]

CATEGORIES: Cattle, Urban legends, Fictional activities

Cow tipping is the purported activity of sneaking up on an unsuspecting upright cow and pushing it over for entertainment. The practice of cow tipping is generally considered an urban legend, as cows do not sleep standing up, and the implication that a cow can be pushed over and not stand up again is incorrect, as, unless injured, cows routinely lie down and can easily regain their footing.  The implication that rural citizens seek such entertainment due to lack of other alternatives is also generally viewed as a stereotype.http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/3/6/who-you-calling-a-hick-i/

==Scientific study==

The urban legend of cow tipping relies upon the presumption that cattle are slow-moving, dim-witted, and weak-legged, thus easily pushed over without much force. However, cattle do not sleep while standing; they only rest that way, and they are easily disturbed.[tpl]cite news|last = Malvern|first = Jack|title = Cow-tipping myth hasn't got a leg to stand on|publisher = Times Online|url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1858246,00.html|accessdate = 2006-10-28 | location=London | date=November 5, 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110629083548/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article586737.ece|archivedate=2011-06-29|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Furthermore, numerous sources have questioned the practice's feasibility, since most cows weigh over half a ton, and easily resist any lesser force.[tpl]cite web|last = Semke|first = Matt|title = The Statics of Cow Tipping|publisher = UNL College of Engineering and Mechanics Course Project|url = http://emweb.unl.edu/Mechanics-Pages/Matt-Semke/The%20Statics%20of%20Cow%20Tipping.htm|accessdate = 2007-04-17[/tpl]
A 2005 study led by Margo Lillie, a doctor of zoology at the University of British Columbia, concluded that tipping a cow would require an exertion of 2,910 newtons (654.2 lbf) of force,[tpl]cite news|last=Haines|first=Lester|title=Boffins debunk cow-tipping myth|newspaper=The Register|date=9 November 2005|accessdate=30 November 2012|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/11/09/cow_tipping[/tpl] and is therefore impossible to accomplish by a single person. Her calculations found that it would take at least two people to apply enough force to push over a cow if the cow did not react and reorient its footing. If the cow did react, it would take at least four people to push it over. Lillie noted that cattle are well aware of their surroundings and are very difficult to surprise, due to excellent senses of both smell and hearing,[tpl]Cite news|last = Colebourn|first = John|title = Debunking rural myth of cow tipping: It's udder nonsense, academics contend|newspaper = Montreal Gazette|pages = A10|date = November 9, 2005|url=|postscript = [/tpl]Ian Denomme, "Cow-tipping a mooo-yth?", The Gazette (Western Daily Student Newspaper), November 9, 2005.

==Historical origins==

The belief that certain animals cannot rise if pushed over has historical antecedents, though cattle have never been so classified. Julius Caesar and Pliny record a belief that European moose had no knee joints and could not get up if they fell over.[tpl]Cite book | publisher = Harper & brothers | last = Caesar | first = Julius | coauthors = Aulus Hirtius | title = Caesar's Commentaries on the Gallic and civil wars | chapter = XXVII | page = 154 | year = 1879 | isbn = 0-217-45287-6 [/tpl]http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10657/pg10657.txt[tpl]cite web | title = Pliny the Elder, The Natural History (eds.

In 1255, Louis IX of France gave an elephant to Henry III of England for his menagerie in the Tower of London. Drawn from life by the historian Matthew Paris for his Chronica Majora, it can be seen in his bestiary at Parker Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, with an accompanying text revealing that at the time, Europeans believed that elephants did not have knees and so were unable to get up if they fell over. The bestiary contains a drawing depicting an elephant on its back being dragged along the ground by another elephant, with a caption stating that elephants lacked knees.Willene B. Clark, A medieval book of beasts, p.128
