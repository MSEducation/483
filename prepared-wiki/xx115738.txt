Weeksville is a neighborhood founded by African American freedmen in what is now Brooklyn, New York, United States, part of the present-day neighborhood of Crown Heights.

==History==

Weeksville was named after James Weeks, a stevedore and African-American ex-slave[tpl]|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/save-americas-treasures/success-stories/weeksville.html[/tpl] from Virginia, who in 1838 (just 11 years after the abolition of slavery in New York State)[tpl]cite news |last=Ramirez |first=Anthony |title=Haven for Blacks in Civil War Riots Now Safeguards History |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 5, 2005 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/nyregion/05weeksville.html |accessdate=2010-07-09[/tpl] bought a plot of land from Henry C. Thompson (another free African-American) in the Ninth Ward of central Brooklyn. The City of New York confuses[tpl]|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/weeksvilleplayground/history |accessdate=2014-01-11[/tpl] Weeks with a man of the same name who lived 1776-1863.[tpl]|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=36713133[/tpl]
The village itself was established by a group of African-American land investors and political activists, and covered an area bounded by present-day Fulton Street, East New York Avenue, Ralph Avenue and Troy Avenue.[tpl]cite news |last=Christian |first=Nichole M. |title=Hidden in Brooklyn, A Bit of Black History; Freedmen's Homes Seen as Attraction |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 29, 2001 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/29/nyregion/hidden-in-brooklyn-a-bit-of-black-history-freedmen-s-homes-seen-as-attraction.html |accessdate=2010-07-09[/tpl]  A 1906 article in the New York Age recalling the earlier period noted that James Weeks "owned a handsome dwelling at Schenectady and Atlantic Avenues."
By the 1850s, Weeksville had more than 500 residents from all over the East Coast (as well as two people born in Africa). Almost 40 percent of residents were southern-born. Nearly one-third of the men over 21 owned land; in antebellum New York, unlike in New England, non-white men had to be real property owners to qualify as voters. The village had its own churches (including Bethel Tabernacle African Methodist Episcopal Church and the Berean Missionary Baptist Church), a school ("Colored School no. 2", now P.S. 243), a cemetery, and an old age home.[tpl]cite book |last=Cantwell |first=Anne-Marie |last2=Wall |first2=Diana diZerega |title=Unearthing Gotham: The Archaeology of New York City |page=268 |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-300-09799-3 |publisher=Yale University Press[/tpl]  Weeksville had one of the first African-American newspapers, the Freedman's Torchlight, and in the 1860s became the national headquarters of the African Civilization Society and the Howard Orphan Asylum.  During the violent New York Draft Riots of 1863, the community served as a refuge for many African-Americans who fled from Manhattan.
After the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge and as New York City grew and expanded, Weeksville gradually became part of Crown Heights, and memory of the village was largely forgotten.

==Rediscovery of Weeksville and the Hunterfly Road Houses==

The search for Historic Weeksville began in 1968 in a Pratt College workshop on Brooklyn and New York City neighborhoods led by historian James Hurley.  After reading of Weeksville in Brooklyn's Eastern District, a 1942 book by Brooklyn historian Eugene Ambruster, Hurley and Joseph Haynes, a local resident and pilot, consulted old maps and flew over the area in an airplane in search of surviving evidence of the village.
Four historic houses (now known as the Hunterfly Road Houses) were discovered off Bergen Street between Buffalo and Rochester Avenues, facing an old laneâ€”a remnant of Hunterfly Road, which was at the eastern edge of the 19th century village.

==Weeksville Heritage Center==

The 1968 discovery of the Hunterfly Road Houses led to the formation of The Society for the Preservation of Weeksville and Bedford-Stuyvesant History (now the Weeksville Heritage Center).
Hunterfly Road Historic District is a national historic district.  It consists of four contributing residential buildings, erected no earlier than the 1860s, within the 19th century free Black community of Weeksville, along a road dating back to American Indian tenure of the area which led to shellfish beds at the Jamaica Bay end of Fresh Kill/Creek. Sections of Hunterfly Road started closing after 1835.  The houses are one and one half to [tpl]frac|2|1|2[/tpl]-story wood-frame dwellings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=3231|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration:Hunterfly Road Historic District|date=undated |accessdate=2011-03-12 |author=Stephen Lash and Betty Ezequelle|publisher=New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation[/tpl] See also: [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=3292|title=Accompanying two photos[/tpl]
In 1970 the houses were declared New York City Landmarks, and in 1972 were placed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Hunterfly Road Historic District.  The houses were purchased by the Society in 1973.[tpl]cite news |title=Weeksville Buys Historic Houses; Sees Cost of $200,000 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 24, 1973 |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00C14FD3959147A93C6AB178DD85F478785F9 |accessdate=2010-07-09[/tpl]

Construction of an [tpl]convert|19000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] education and cultural center adjacent to the houses is almost complete.[tpl]cite web |title=Weeksville Heritage Center - About Us |url=http://www.weeksvillesociety.org/about-us[/tpl]
