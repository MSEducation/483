==History==

In 1910, Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) purchased a quarter section of land in the southwest region of Saskatchewan and called it Robsart. The land was named after Amy Robsart, from the Sir Walter Scott book, Kenilworth. Three years later the land was bought by a man named Henry Abbott, who led the first settlers to the new community. Shortly after the settlers arrived, many businesses started to go up quickly. Two of the first businesses were a general store and feed mill, soon following them were 30 other businesses, including a dentist, jeweller, and a surgeon.

===Boom years===

When the CPR was finished the construction of the Stirling-Weyburn line, this caused a boom bringing in even more prosperity for the small community. Almost weekly new businesses were opening, bringing new hotels, cafés, churches, livery barns, a school, banks, grain elevators, and its own Public hospital which opened its doors in 1917 and still stands today. Ten years after the town of Robsart was established it had a population of 350 residents, its own town hall, mayor, town council, and around more than 50 businesses. The town was so prosperous that one postcard with a picture of Robsart bared the ironic motto “A town with a bright future.”

===Great Depression===

In the late 1920s, Robsart's prosperous beginnings began a long decline. Starting with a grain elevator fire in 1929, one year later another blaze wiped out a large section of the business core. Next to follow were the Great Depression years, accompanying droughts, falling grain prices and poor crop yields, were the cases for further business closures in the once industrious business core. Many merchants were hit hard by crippling financial losses and had to leave in search for a better way of life. Since the beginning of the Great Depression the community has struggled but never with the same early pioneer optimism.

Both had played a crucial role in the community over the years. Finally on January 1, 2002, due to dwindling population, the village of Robsart was restructured as a hamlet which is now governed by the Rural municipality of Reno No. 51.
