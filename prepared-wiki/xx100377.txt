The Orbit Room began in November 1994. The original house band, The Dexters, played classic R&B Thursday through Saturdays, then Fridays and Saturdays, and finally just Saturdays. The Dexters are Lou Pomanti (Hammond B-3), Bernie LaBarge (guitar, vocals), Peter Cardinali (bass), and Mark Kelso (drums). They played at the club for ten years, until their semi-retirement in 2004. 
Blues, alternative rock, reggae, soul, and/or R & B can be heard live 7 nights a week.  On any given night, local musicians and Canadian celebrities are often present.
