Bernard Francis Law (born November 4, 1931) is an American cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He is the Archbishop emeritus of Boston, a member of the Roman Curia, former archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, and titular Cardinal Priest of Santa Susanna, the American Catholic church in Rome.
Law was influential in the first English translation of the Catechism of the Catholic Church in the 1980's. In addition, he is also known for issuing reports maintaining that Freemasonry is incompatible with Roman Catholicism. Law later resigned as Archbishop of Boston on December 13, 2002, allegedly in response to the Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal after church documents were revealed which suggested he had covered up sexual abuse committed by some Catholic priests within his archdiocese.
Pope John Paul II appointed Law as Archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome in 2004; he resigned from this position upon reaching the age of 80 in November 2011, but continues to live in an apartment within the basilica.

==Early life==

Law, an only child, was born in the Mexican city of Torreón, Coahuila, on November 4, 1931. His father was a United States Army pilot in World War I, and had moved to Torreón to run an airline. His mother, Helen, was a convert to Roman Catholicism from Presbyterianism.
He attended schools in New York, Florida, Georgia, and Barranquilla,  Colombia, before graduating from Charlotte Amalie High School in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands.
He graduated from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts with a major in medieval history, before beginning philosophy studies at Saint Joseph Seminary College in St. Benedict, Louisiana, from 1953 to 1955, and then theological studies at the Pontifical College Josephinum in Worthington, Ohio, from 1955 to 1961.
On May 21, 1961. Law was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Natchez-Jackson in Mississippi. He served two years as an assistant pastor of St. Paul's Catholic Church in Vicksburg, and was made the editor of the Mississippi Register, the diocesan newspaper. He also held several other diocesan posts from 1963 to 1968, including director of the family life bureau and spiritual director of the minor seminary.

==Civil rights activism==

Law was a civil rights activist.Pham, John-Peter, Heirs of the Fisherman via books.google.ie.Boston Globe, 2004, Abuse in the Catholic Church He was a member of the Mississippi Leadership Conference and Mississippi Human Relations Council. For his civil rights activities and his strong positions on civil rights in the Mississippi Register, of which he was editor, he received death threats.National Catholic Reporter, 27 December 2002 The newspaper lost many subscribers for whom his civil rights stance was repugnant.
Charles Evers, activist and brother of Medger Evers (activist assassinated in 1963), praised Law and said he acted “not for the Negro, but for justice and what is right.”
Law's civil rights activity led him to develop ties with Protestant church leaders and he received national attention for his work for ecumenism and in 1968 he was tapped for his first national post, as executive director of the U.S. Bishops' Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs.

==Bishop of Springfield-Cape Girardeau==

Pope Paul VI named him to head the Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau on October 22, 1973, for which he was ordained as a bishop on 5 December 1973. Law's predecessor in Springfield-Cape Girardeau was William Wakefield Baum, another future cardinal.
In 1975, he made the news when he arranged for the resettlement in his diocese of one hundred and sixty-six Vietnamese refugees who had arrived in the United States, and who were members of a Vietnamese religious congregation, the Congregation of the Mother Co-Redemptrix.
In continuing his ecumenical work, Law formed the Missouri Christian Leadership Conference. He was made a member of the Vatican's Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity and served from 1976 to 1981 as a consultor to its Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews. In the late 1970s, Law would also chair the U.S. bishops' Committee on Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs.
In 1981, Law was named the Vatican delegate to develop and oversee a program instituted by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in which U.S. Episcopal priests would be accepted into the Catholic priesthood. In the program's first year sixty-four Episcopal priests applied for acceptance. This brought married priests with their families into U.S. Roman Catholic dioceses for the first time.
In this period Law was also a pro-life activist and spoke out against abortion. During the 1984 presidential race, when Geraldine Ferraro, who was a Roman Catholic, was the Democratic vice presidential candidate, Law and then Archbishop of New York John Joseph O'Connor both denounced her renunciation of rights for the unborn. Law called abortion "the critical issue of the moment".

==Archbishop of Boston==

On January 11, 1984, Cardinal Law was appointed Archbishop of Boston, by Pope John Paul II. He was installed as Archbishop on March 23, 1984.
Only a little over a year later on May 25, 1985, he was elevated in consistory as a member of the College of Cardinals, where he was also appointed the Cardinal-Priest of the Titulus S. Susannae.
It was his speech at the 1985 Synod of Bishops marking the 20th anniversary of the end of the Second Vatican Council, that led to development of the Catechism of the Catholic Church in which Law oversaw the first draft of the English translation.
In the mid-1980s, Law chaired the bishops' Committee on Pastoral Research and Practices at the time it distributed a major study report on Freemasonry. The bishops' report concluded that "the principles and basic rituals of Masonry embody a naturalistic religion, active participation in which is incompatible with Christian faith and practice."
In October 2012, former Irish President (and Catholic) Mary McAleese related that, on a state visit to the United States in 1998, she was publicly berated by Law for her stance on the ordination of women. The cardinal ushered McAleese and members of her delegation into a room to hear Mary Ann Glendon lecture them on the Church's views on women priests and where a heated argument then took place. McAleese rebuked him with the statement that she was "the President of Ireland and not just of Catholic Ireland". Cardinals Desmond Connell of Dublin and Cahal Daly of Armagh condemned Law's action."Cardinal Law told Mary McAleese he was ‘sorry for Catholic Ireland to have you as President", IrishCentral, 7 October 2012
In 1989 and 1990 Law visited Cuba. He met with Fidel Castro in 1990 and in January 1998 he led a delegation of two hundred and forty Bostonians to Cuba during the papal visit there. In 2000 he was part of an inter-American delegation of bishops that met with Castro for more than four hours.
During his time as Archbishop he continued to oppose abortion. However, in 1995, when John Salvi attacked two Boston abortion clinics, he urged a moratorium on clinic protests.

==Sexual abuse scandal==

Cardinal Law's reign as Archbishop of Boston began in popularity but declined into turbulence towards the end of his term. Allegations and reports of sexual misconduct by priests of the Archdiocese of Boston became widespread causing Roman Catholics in other dioceses of the United States to investigate similar situations there. Cardinal Law's actions and inactions prompted public scrutiny of all members of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the steps they had taken in response to past and current allegations of sexual misconduct at the hands of priests. The events in the Archdiocese of Boston exploded into a national Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal.
Under questioning, the cardinal stated that, when a priest committed a sex crime, his practice was to seek the analysis of psychiatrists, clinicians and therapists in residential treatment centers before deciding whether to return a priest accused of sexually abusing a child to the pulpit.
Cardinal Law became the first high-level Church official to be accused of actively participating in the cover-up of child molestation. 
The Archdiocese closed sixty-five parishes before Cardinal Law stepped down from service.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]

===Resignation as Archbishop of Boston===

Law submitted his resignation as Archbishop of Boston to the Vatican some years before he turned 75 and would be expected to resign; Pope John Paul II accepted his resignation on December 13, 2002.  In 2003 Sean O'Malley, O.F.M. Cap. was named Archbishop of Boston.
In a statement Law said, "It is my fervent prayer that this action may help the Archdiocese of Boston to experience the healing, reconciliation and unity which are so desperately needed. To all those who have suffered from my shortcomings and mistakes I both apologize and from them beg forgiveness."[tpl]cite news|title=Cardinal Law Resigns as Archbishop of Boston|url=http://www.npr.org/news/specials/law/|accessdate=January 17, 2014|newspaper=NPR|date=December 15, 2002[/tpl]  He remains a bishop and cardinal, which is a separate appointment.  As a cardinal, he participated in the 2005 papal conclave.

==Move to Rome==

In December 2002, Law left Boston.  It is often alleged "bring-the-pope-to-justice", thedailybeast.com/newsweek, 2010/04/22. that he left just hours before state troopers arrived with subpoenas seeking his grand jury testimony; however, he had previously given evidence before two grand juries and been fully investigated by the state attorney general and the five district attorneys in the counties in which the archdiocese operates [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]. When the state attorney general issued his report entitled Child Sexual Abuse in the Archdiocese of Boston (July 23, 2003) he severely criticized Law mentioning that "the Archdiocese has shown an institutional reluctance to adequately address the problem and, in fact, made choices that allowed the abuse to continue" but did not allege that Law had tried to evade investigation and he did state that Law had not broken any laws because the law requiring abuse to be reported was not expanded to include priests until 2002."ReillyExecSum", bishop-accountability.org.
In May 2004, John Paul II appointed Law to a post in Rome, putting him in charge of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, with the title of Archpriest."Cardinal Law Given Post In Rome", The New York Times, May 28, 2004. Accessed April 11, 2008.
Law was a member of the Congregations for the Oriental Churches, the Clergy, Divine Worship and Discipline of the Sacraments, Evangelisation of Peoples, Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, Catholic Education, Bishops as well as the Pontifical Council for the Family. He held membership in all these congregations and of the council before resigning from the governance of the Archdiocese of Boston, and at that time was also a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture.Annuario Pontificio 2002
Law reached age 80 on November 4, 2011, and lost the right to participate in any papal conclave and on the same day he ceased to hold his various Curial memberships. He remained as archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore until November 21, 2011, when Archbishop Santos Abril y Castelló was appointed as the new archpriest.

==Retirement==

It was "commonly believed that would live out his retirement in Rome" when he was retired in 2011.Arsenault, Mark, "Law retires from post in Rome", Boston Globe, November 22, 2011.

In May 2012, MSNBC reported that Law was "the person in Rome most forcefully supporting" the Vatican response to Baltimore Archbishop William E. Lori's petition to investigate the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, a large group of American nuns. Other American churchmen in Rome, including Cardinal Raymond Burke and Cardinal James Francis Stafford also reportedly backed the investigation, which was led by William Joseph Levada, archbishop emeritus of San Francisco and then-Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. In April 2012, "after a three-year investigation, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith had appointed Archbishop J. Peter Sartain of Seattle to oversee the nuns' organization and reform its programs to adhere more closely to 'the teachings and discipline of the Church'".Bratu, Becky, "US priests reportedly behind Vatican crackdown on nuns", nbcnews.com, May 10, 2012.
