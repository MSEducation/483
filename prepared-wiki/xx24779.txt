[[Transport in Iceland]]

CATEGORIES: Transport in Iceland

The modes of transport in Iceland are governed by the country’s rugged terrain and sparse population. The principal mode of personal transport is the car. There are no public railways — although there are bus services. Transport from one major town to another, for example Reykjavík to Akureyri, may be by aeroplane on a domestic flight. The only way of getting in and out of the country is by air and sea. Most of the country's transport infrastructure is concentrated near the Greater Reykjavík Area, which is home to two thirds of the country's population.

Iceland has no public railways, although proposals to build a passenger line between Keflavík and Reykjavík have been made as well as proposals to build a light rail system in Reykjavík.[tpl]cite web | title=MPs Propose Trains in Iceland | publisher=Iceland Review | accessdate=2010-04-25 | date=2008-02-20 | url=http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/search/news/Default.asp?ew_0_a_id=301156[/tpl] Several former locomotive-powered and hand-operated railways have closed and been dismantled, although some evidence of their existence remains in museums and as static exhibits.
