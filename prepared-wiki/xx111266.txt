[[United States domestic market]]

CATEGORIES: Economy of the United States

The term United States domestic market (USDM) is a term used chiefly by automotive enthusiasts to describe the United States' economic market for American-brand automobiles and parts. A similar automotive enthusiast term, Japan Domestic Market (JDM) is used to designate Japanese-market automobiles and parts.
The term is also applied to vehicles that comply with United States regulations, most notably the lights and bumpers, which differ from European standards. The incompatibility requires manufacturers to develop USD and EDM versions of their models if they want to sell them in both regions.
Sometimes the conversion in the factory lane is done after the model was launched in the original market. The conversion to United States federal laws is often called "federalization".
