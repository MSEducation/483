The microwave auditory effect, also known as the microwave hearing effect or the Frey effect, consists of audible clicks (or, with modulation, whole words) induced by pulsed/modulated  microwave frequencies. The clicks are generated directly inside the human head without the need of any receiving electronic device. The effect was first reported by persons working in the vicinity of radar transponders during World War II. These induced sounds are not audible to other people nearby. The microwave auditory effect was later discovered to be inducible with shorter-wavelength portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. During the Cold War era, the American neuroscientist Allan H. Frey studied this phenomenon and was the first to publish[tpl]cite journal| url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/17/4/689.abstract?sid=7c073ad2-6324-4b47-94e1-124dc0a5f154 | journal=Journal of Applied Physiology| volume=17 |pages=689–692 |year=1962| title=Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy |author=Allan H.

Pulsed microwave radiation can be heard by some workers; the irradiated personnel perceive auditory sensations of clicking or buzzing. The cause is thought to be thermoelastic expansion of portions of auditory apparatus.[tpl]cite book|last1=Levy|first1=Barry S.|last2=Wagner|first2=Gregory R.|last3=Rest|first3=Kathleen M.|title=Preventing occupational disease and injury|url=http://books.google.com/?id=pM7DNkbVyQgC&pg=PA428&dq=microwave+injury&cd=26#v=onepage&q=microwave%20injury&f=false|year=2005|publisher=American Public Health Association|isbn=978-0-87553-043-7|page=428[/tpl] The auditory system response occurs at least from 200 MHz to at least 3 GHz. In the tests, repetition rate of 50 Hz was used, with pulse width between 10–70 microseconds. The perceived loudness was found to be linked to the peak power density instead of average power density.  At 1.245 GHz, the peak power density for perception was below 80 mW/cm2.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl] However, competing theories explain the results of interferometric holography tests differently. http://www.sciencemag.org/content/209/4461/1144.extract?sid=f514230e-1373-4da5-ad36-3689f428e21b
In 2003, the US Navy conducted research on an MAE system they called  MEDUSA (Mob Excess Deterrent Using Silent Audio) as a way to remotely, temporarily incapacitate personnel.[tpl]cite book|last=Taylor|first=Eldon|title=Mind Programming: From Persuasion and Brainwashing, to Self-Help and Practical Metaphysics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3MVawFzPXKEC&pg=PA100|date=15 April 2009|publisher=Hay House, Inc|isbn=978-1-4019-2513-0|pages=100–101[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title=Navy search database – summary report: Remote Personnel Incapacitation System | work=SBIR/STTR Search Database (Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer) | publisher=U.S. Navy | url=http://www.navysbirprogram.com/NavySearch/Summary/summary.aspx?pk=F5B07D68-1B19-4235-B140-950CE2E19D08 | accessdate=12 January 2014 [/tpl][tpl] cite news | url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14250-microwave-ray-gun-controls-crowds-with-noise.html | title=Microwave ray gun controls crowds with noise | last=Hambling | first=David | date=3 July 2008 | work=NewScientist | accessdate=12 January 2014 [/tpl] The system relied on the principle of MAE, varying the power and parameters of the microwave pulses “to raise the auditory sensation to the ‘discomfort’ level, deterring personnel from entering a protected perimeter or, if necessary, temporarily incapacitating particular individuals.”
In 2008, Sierra Nevada Corporation, a contractor that worked on the Navy's MEDUSA research, announced that they were seeking funding from the US Department of Defense to build demonstration and transportable versions of the system.

==Primary Cold War-era research in the US==

The first American to publish on the microwave hearing effect was Allan H. Frey, in 1961. In his experiments, the subjects were discovered to be able to hear appropriately pulsed microwave radiation, from a distance of 100 meters from the transmitter. This was accompanied by side effects such as dizziness, headaches, and a pins and needles sensation.
Sharp and Grove developed 'receiverless' wireless voice transmission technologies for the Advanced Research Projects Agency at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in 1973. In the above mentioned journal entry to American Psychologist, Dr. Don Justesen reports that Sharp and Grove were readily able to hear, identify, and distinguish among the single-syllable words for digits between 1 and 10. Justesen writes, "The sounds heard were not unlike those emitted by persons with an artificial voice box (Electrolarynx). Communication of more complex words and of sentences was not attempted because the averaged densities of energy required to transmit longer messages would approach the still current 10mW/cm² limit of safe exposure."D.R. Justesen. "Microwaves and Behavior", Am Psychologist, 392(Mar): 391–401, 1975.

==Peaceful applications==

A 1998 patent describes a device that can scare off birds from wind turbines, aircraft, and other sensitive installations by way of microwave energy pulses.  Using frequencies from 1 GHz to about 40 GHz, the warning system generates pulses of milliseconds duration, which are claimed to be sensed by the birds' auditory systems.  It is believed this may cause them to veer away from the protected object.Kreithen ML.

==Conspiracy theories==

Numerous individuals suffering from auditory hallucinations, delusional disorders[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.jrn.com/kmir6/news/179055911.html |title=Electronic Harassment: Voices in My Mind |last=Monroe|first=Angela |date=November 12, 2012 |newspaper=KMIR News |accessdate=2014-02-25[/tpl] or other mental illness have claimed that government agents use microwave signals to transmit sounds and thoughts into their heads as a form of electronic harassment, referring to the technology as "voice to skull" or "V2K".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011001399.html |title=Mind Games |last=Weinberger|first=Sharon |date=January 14, 2007 | work=Washington Post |accessdate=12 January 2014[/tpl] There are extensive online support networks and numerous websites maintained by people fearing mind control. California psychiatrist Alan Drucker has identified evidence of delusional disorders on many of these websites and other psychologists are divided over whether such sites negatively reinforce mental troubles or act as a form of group cognitive therapy.[tpl]cite news | title=Sharing Their Demons on the Web | last = Kershaw | first=Sarah | newspaper=New York Times | date = November 12, 2008 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/13/fashion/13psych.html?pagewanted=all[/tpl]
