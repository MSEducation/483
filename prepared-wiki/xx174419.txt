===Signings===

The Jets used a large amount of salary cap room to make several high-profile acquisitions in the offseason. On February 29 the team signed former Pittsburgh Steelers left guard, Alan Faneca, to a five-year, $40 million contract. The deal made Faneca the highest paid offensive lineman in the National Football League.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3272497|title=Faneca agrees to five-year $40 million deal with Jets|publisher=ESPN.com|date=March 2, 2008|accessdate=April 14, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080403065745/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3272497| archivedate= April 3, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The Jets then signed former Arizona Cardinals linebacker, Calvin Pace, to a six-year, $42 million deal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3275059|title=Pace to get $22M guaranteed in big deal with Jets|author=Pasquerelli, Len|publisher=ESPN.com|date=March 3, 2008|accessdate=April 15, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080402093206/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3275059| archivedate= April 2, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Pace had 6 ½ sacks in 2007, and was considered to fit well with the Jets' 3–4 defense.[tpl]cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E3DC153EF937A35750C0A96E9C8B63&scp=3&sq=Calvin+Pace&st=nyt|title=PRO FOOTBALL; Jets Add 2, And Giants Sign Safety|author=Battista, Judy|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 4, 2008|accessdate=April 15, 2008[/tpl] The Jets continued to attempt to improve the offensive line by signing Detroit Lions right tackle Damien Woody to a five-year $25.5 million contract.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3275142|title=Woody gives Jets four former first-round draft picks on O-line|author=Smith, Michael|publisher=ESPN.com|date=March 3, 2008|accessdate=April 15, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080403065750/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3275142| archivedate= April 3, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

Favre finished the 2007 season second in MVP voting and was named starter of the NFC Pro Bowl team.

===Week 1: at Miami Dolphins===

====Game summary====

The Jets started with quarterback Brett Favre against a Miami Dolphins team that was sporting new starting quarterback and former Jets starting quarterback Chad Pennington. Favre got the Jets on the scoreboard first in the first quarter with a play-action pass that found Jerricho Cotchery at the 10-yard line en route to a 56-yard touchdown. However, Mike Nugent sprained his thigh on the following kickoff, and when he attempted and missed a 32-yard field goal attempt, Nugent was brought out of the game. Miami then responded, with Chad Pennington marching the Dolphins down to the 6-yard line. From there, Pennington connected with Anthony Fasano for a 5-yard touchdown, tying the game. On the following drive for the Jets, coach Eric Mangini, faced with the possibility of missing a 40-yard field goal if he allowed an uncertain Mike Nugent to kick the ball, opted for Favre to continue on 4th down and 13 yards. Favre, under pressure, threw up a high ball and rookie Chansi Stuckey jumped up for the catch in the end zone, giving the Jets a 13–7 lead. Rather than put Nugent out to the field for a PAT, Mangini opted to go for two points, but the option failed. 
In the 3rd quarter, Favre brought the Jets back to the red zone, moving them to the 6-yard line. From there, Favre handed off the ball to Thomas Jones, who ran in for the touchdown. Along with an extra point from Mike Nugent, the Jets now had a 20–7 lead. Due to miscommunication, Chad Pennington was forced to use two time-outs early in the 4th quarter. Late in the 4th quarter, Pennington moved Miami down the field, including connecting on a 14-yard pass from 4th-and-7 at midfield. Pennington completed an 11-yard touchdown pass to David Martin with 3:27 remaining, cutting the Jets' lead to 6 points. The Jets, who ran the clock down to the two-minute warning, went three-and-out on their drive, giving the ball back to Miami at their 34-yard line with 1:53 remaining. Pennington moved the team down the field, getting to the 18-yard line with 18 seconds on the clock. On 3rd-and-10 from the 18-yard line, Pennington attempted a throw to Ted Ginn, Jr. in the back of the end zone, but it was intercepted by Darrelle Revis, sealing the six-point win for the Jets.
With the win, the Jets began their 2008 season at 1–0.
Brett Favre, in his Jets debut, completed 15 of 22 passes for 194 yards and 2 touchdowns (with a passer rating of 125.9).

The Dolphins would strike back with former Jets quarterback Chad Pennington completing a 27-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr., along with rookie defensive end Phillip Merling returning an interception 25 yards for a touchdown.  New York would close out the half as kicker Jay Feely got a 28-yard field goal.
In the third quarter, the Jets regained the lead as running back Leon Washington got a 10-yard touchdown run (followed by Favre's 2-point conversion pass to wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery).  However, Miami replied with Pennington's 20-yard touchdown pass to tight end Anthony Fasano.  In the fourth quarter, the Dolphins would pull away as kicker Dan Carpenter nailed a 48-yard field goal.  New York tried to get a comeback, but Miami's defense stopped any attempt.
With the disappointing finish, the Jets' season ended at 9–7.  As a result, head coach Eric Mangini was fired.
