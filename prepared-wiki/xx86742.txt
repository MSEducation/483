John C. Servis (born October 25, 1958 in Charles Town, West Virginia) is an American Thoroughbred racehorse trainer who was relatively unknown until May 2004 when his horse Smarty Jones won the Kentucky Derby. The colt then went on to win the Preakness Stakes further increasing Servis' reputation.  Servis trains horses primarily out of Philadelphia Park in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. 
He was born into a family involved in the Thoroughbred racing industry. As a boy, he moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where his father worked as a jockey.
Servis trained his 1,000th winner on May 1, 2007 at Philadelphia Park.
John lives with his wife, Sherry, and two sons, Blane and John Tyler.
John is also the brother-in-law to Florida Thoroughbred trainer, Edward Plesa.
