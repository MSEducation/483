[[Flag of the Northern Mariana Islands]]

CATEGORIES: Flags of the insular areas of the United States, Symbols of the Northern Mariana Islands

The flag of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands was adopted on July 4, 1976.
In common with other states of the Pacific, such as the Marshall Islands and Nauru, the flag for the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI) shows a blue field and a white star. In the case of this nation, the flag takes its inspiration from the United Nations, as the NMI had once been a UN Trust Territory. The symbol behind the white star is a latte stone, a Chamorro house foundation. 
The decorative wreath, or mwarmwar, was added in 1981, and maintains the link between the islands and its sacred history and customs.
