U.S. Highway 20 crosses the pass, approximately 15 mi (24 km) west of West Yellowstone, Montana, on the western boundary of Yellowstone National Park. The pass provides the most direct access to Yellowstone Park from southern Idaho.
The pass is located in the Caribou-Targhee National Forest. Henrys Lake, the headwaters of the Henrys Fork, a tributary of the Snake River is located just west of the pass. Hebgen Lake, a reservoir on the Madison River, a tributary of the Missouri River, is located just north of the pass.

==Nez Perce War==

During the 1877 Nez Perce War, Chief Joseph's band of Nez Perce traversed the pass on August 22 while evading U.S. Cavalry forces under the command of General Oliver O. Howard.  The Nez Perce had just engaged the army at the Battle of Camas Creek in Idaho.  After entering Montana Territory the Indians moved east up the Madison River into Yellowstone National Park.[tpl]cite book |author=Utley, Robert M. |title=Frontier Regulars the United States Army and the Indian, 1866-1891 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, NE |year=1973 |isbn= 0-8032-9551-0  |page=308-309 [/tpl]
