The Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar was a passenger transport aircraft of the World War II era.

==Design and development==

Sales of the 10–14 passenger Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra, which first flew in 1937, had proved disappointing, despite the aircraft's excellent performance, as it was more expensive to operate than the larger Douglas DC-3,  already in widespread use.Francillon 1982, p. 135. In order to improve the type's economics, Lockheed decided to stretch the aircraft's fuselage by [tpl]convert|5|ft|6|in|m[/tpl], allowing an extra two rows of seats to be fitted.Francillon 1982, pp. 185–186.
The prototype for the revised airliner, designated Model 18 by Lockheed, was converted from the fourth Model 14, one of a batch which had been returned to the manufacturer by Northwest Airlines after a series of crashes. The modified aircraft first flew in this form on September 21, 1939, another two prototypes being converted from Model 14s, with the first newly built Model 18 flying on February 2, 1940.Francillon 1982, pp. 139, 186.
A total of 625 Lodestars of all variants were built.

==Operational history==

The Lodestar received its Type certificate on March 30, 1940, allowing it to enter service with the first customer, Mid-Continent Airlines that month.Francillon 1982, p. 186. As hoped, the extra seats greatly improved the Model 18's economics, reducing its seat-mile costs to a similar level to that of the DC-3, while retaining superior performance. Despite this, sales to US domestic customers were relatively slow as most US airlines were already committed to the DC-3, with only 31 Lodestars going to US airlines.Francillon 1982, p. 187. Overseas sales were a little better, with 29 bought by the government of the Netherlands East Indies. South African Airways (21), New Zealand National Airways Corporation (13), Trans-Canada Air Lines (12) and BOAC (9) who were the biggest airline customers. Various Pratt & Whitney and Wright Cyclone powerplants were installed.
When the United States started to build up its military air strength in 1940–41, many American-operated Lodestars were impressed as the C-56. This was followed by the construction of many new-build Lodestars which were flown by the Army Air Force as the C-60 and U.S. Navy as the R5O. Lend-lease aircraft were used by the RNZAF as transports.
One was purchased in 1942 to serve as Brazilian President Getúlio Vargas' personal aircraft. This aircraft was specially designed for that purpose and had 11 seats.
After the war many Lodestars were overhauled and returned to civilian service, mostly as executive transports such as Dallas Aero Service's DAS Dalaero conversion, Bill Lear's Learstar (produced by PacAero), and Howard Aero's Howard 250.Taylor 1965, p. 244.[tpl]cite journal|magazine=Flying Magazine|date=January 1954|page=40[/tpl] A few of the latter were converted to tricycle landing gear.
Many of the New Zealand aircraft were later used for aerial topdressing.
A single Lodestar served with the Israeli Air Force during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.
A number of skydiving operations in the United States used Lodestars during the 1970s and 1980s.

==Survivors==

Around 10-15 are still airworthy in the USA alone.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2009[/tpl] An example of a Lodestar converted for commercial use exists at the 1940 Air Terminal Museum in Houston, Texas.
A lodestar Cn2026 ZS-ASN of South African Airways is preserved and on display at the South African Airways Museum Rand Airport Johannesburg, South Africa.

In January 1943, Lockheed Lodestar Mk.II EW986,Record for EW986 on lostaircraft.com c/n 2154, in the service of the Royal Air Force, overshot and crashed 3 km south of Heliopolis, Egypt. At least 12 crew members and passengers died in the crash. A cause of the accident was not determined. Among those killed were Air Vice-Marshal Wilfred Ashton McClaughry, CB, DSO, MC, DFC and Lady Rosalinde Tedder née MacLardy, wife of Marshal of the Royal Air Force Arthur William Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder, GCB.
In 1949, a Lockheed Lodestar in airline service in Australia crashed immediately after takeoff.  All 21 occupants died in the crash or the ensuing conflagration.  The cause of the accident was determined to be that the center of gravity was behind the rear limit.  It is also likely the elevator trim tab was set for landing rather than takeoff.Job, Macarthur.
