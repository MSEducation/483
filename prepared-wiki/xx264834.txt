[[Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, 2011]]

CATEGORIES: State Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, State Assembly elections in India, 2011

The fourteenth legislative assembly election was held on 13 April 2011 to elect members from 234 constituencies in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Results were released on 13 May 2011. Two major parties Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) faced the election as coalitions of multiple political parties: DMK front consisted of 8 parties and the AIADMK of 11 parties. Vijayakanth's Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), which had contested the previous elections independently, allied with AIADMK coalition. Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam boycotted the election following disagreement with Jayalalithaa over seat-sharing. Tamil film actor Vijay was openly involved in Tamil Nadu politics for the first time by extending his support for ADMK.
The outgoing Karunanidhi government was noted for the construction of new assembly building in Chennai, execution of various developmental projects and implementation of new entitlement programs including free health care for the poor and issuance of a range of freebies such as colour television to all. However, these numerous achievements were overshadowed by other major issues such as increasing prices of essential items, 2G spectrum scam and undue influence of Karunanidhi's extended family in various aspects of Tamil politics and business.
The election commission enforced stringent measures to curb the widespread abuse of power to bribe voters that was common in previous elections; it also imposed strict campaign descipline by imposing the 10 PM curfew. The commission headed by the chief election officer Praveen Kumar was commended for conducting the election in a strict and fair manner. The election recorded the highest polling ever in the state - 77.8% of the total electorate voted in the election surpassing 76.57% polled in 1967 election.
AIADMK front won the election winning in 203 constituencies; the AIADMK party alone secured a simple majority by carrying 150 seats and became eligible to form the government without requiring the support of its coalition partners. DMDK won 29 seats, more than the 23 seats won by DMK and opted to serve as the official opposition party. Political analysts concluded that the election was a referendum on the outgoing DMK government and the powerful anti-incumbency sentiment helped the ADMK colaition. J. Jayalalithaa along with 33 ministers was sworn-in as the Chief minister of Tamil Nadu for the third time on 16 May 2011 by governor Surjit Singh Barnala.

==Background==

The Karunanidhi administration was noted for various developmental projects and generous spending of the tax money for the implementation of various free schemes and issuance of freebies: The government provided 1 kg rice for 1 rupee, free health insurance for poor, free colour television and gas stove for all. It also provided job for over 500,000 people in various departments of the government and introduced free concrete house scheme for the poor. It also implemented various road, bridge and drinking water projects in Chennai and all over Tamil Nadu. However, the election was dominated by three major issues, increase in price of essential commodities, 2G Spectrum scandal and nepotism. Inflation was high during late 2010 to early 2011; The price of food and other essential commodities had increased exponentially affecting middle class and poor people: Onions were sold for Rs. 100, tomatoes for Rs. 80 and Jasmine flower for Rs. 1200 per kilo gram. This historical rise in price of essential food items was believed to be due to increased rainfall in North Indian states.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.dinamalar.com/News_Detail.asp?Id=166826| title=தங்கத்தின் விலையில் தக்காளி... வெள்ளி விலையில் வெங்காயம்! | publisher=Dina Malar| date=15 January 2011| accessdate=16 January 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/tamil-nadu/article1685465.ece| title=Price rise: an election issue| work=The Hindu| date=11 April 2011| accessdate=11 April 2011| first=M.

Raja, Union telecommunications minister from Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam was arrested by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in relation to the case. Kanimozhi, Rajya Sabha member from DMK and Chief minister's daughter and Sharad Kumar of Kalaignar TV were also included in the chargesheet filed by CBI.

==Opinion polls==

===Pre-poll surveys===

Most non-partisan pre-polls found AIADMK+ winning comfortably in this election. The pre-polls indicated a great deal of anger towards the incumbent government, due to corruption allegations and recent food price rises. Also AIADMK was aided by including DMDK and its leader Vijaykanth, which has had on average a 10% vote share in recent elections in Tamil Nadu.

===Post-poll surveys===

Since exit polls are banned by ECI, Headlines Today-ORG Poll, conducted a post-poll survey, where they polled voters after they voted in their houses.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpxFtJIZauU Post polls conducted by Headlines Today-ORG Poll, found this election to be a toss-up, with DMK gaining a lot of ground in the last few weeks before the election. The exit poll particularly noted a late swing towards the incumbent in the rural communities of Tamil Nadu, which allowed the DMK and its alliance to increase its overall vote share percentage from 45% in the pre-poll survey to 50% post-poll. A couple of weeks after the Headlines today post poll, a few post polls showed the exact opposite result, with CNN-IBN and Asianet post poll giving AIADMK+, the majority of the same margin.
