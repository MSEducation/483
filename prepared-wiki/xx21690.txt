This is a list of counties in Nevada. There are sixteen counties and one independent city in the U.S. state of Nevada. On November 25, 1861, the first Nevada Territorial Legislature established nine counties.[tpl]cite web |url=http://dmla.clan.lib.nv.us/docs/nsla/archives/political/historical/hist19.htm |title=Political History of Nevada |accessdate=2007-08-17 |work=Nevada State Library and Archives. [/tpl] Nevada was admitted to the Union on October 31, 1864 with eleven counties. In 1969, Ormsby County and Carson City were consolidated into a single municipal government known as Carson City.
The FIPS county code is the five-digit Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code which uniquely identifies counties and county equivalents in the United States.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/enviro/html/codes/nv.html |title=EPA County FIPS Code Listing |accessdate=2007-08-18 |work=US Environmental Protection Agency [/tpl] The three-digit number is unique to each individual county within a state, but to be unique within the entire United States, it must be prefixed by the state code. This means that, for example, while Nye County, Nevada is number 023, Humboldt County, California and Grant County, Oregon also have the number 023. While Humboldt County, Nevada has number 013, Humboldt County, Iowa has number 091. To uniquely identify Nye County, Nevada, you would need to use the state code of 32 plus the county code of 023. Thus, the unique identifier in the entire United States for Humboldt County, Nevada would be 32013, while Nye County, Nevada would be 32023, etc.
