CATEGORIES: Villages in Leicestershire, Civil parishes in Leicestershire

Quorn is a village in Leicestershire, England, situated next to the university town of Loughborough. Quorn's name was shortened from Quorndon in 1889, to avoid postal difficulties owing to its similarity to the name of another village, Quarndon, in neighbouring Derbyshire.http://www.quornmuseum.com/display.php?id=899 The toponym of the village's original name is thought to be derived from the Old English cweorndun, meaning "hill (dun) where millstones (cweorn) are obtained".

==History==

The first known evidence of the village is in the Lincoln Episcopal Registers for 1209–1235, as Quernendon. Other variations of the village name over the centuries include Querne, Quendon, Querendon, Quim, Quarendon, Qaryndon, Querinden, Querondon, and Quernedon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.charnwood.gov.uk/files/documents/quorn_conservation_area_character_appraisal/quornconservationareacharacterap.pdf |title=See page 5 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26[/tpl]
The quarrying of stone in Quorn began at a very early age at Buddon Wood, on the edge of the parish. Granite millstones were quarried in the early Iron Age, and under the Romans stone was quarried for building in Leicester. Some of the larger millstones can still be seen in the area, however these days they are either used as garden ornaments, or worked into seats or slabs.
Quorn Hall, off Meynell Road on the eastern edge of the village, was built for the Farnham family in about 1680.[tpl]cite web|title=Quorn Hall|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-404851-quorn-hall-quorndon-leicestershire|publisher=British Listed Buildings[/tpl] It became the home of renowned fox hunter Hugo Meynell in 1753. He established his pack of hounds there, where it continued under later masters until 1905, thus giving a name to the famous Quorn Hunt.William Charles Arlington Blew, The Quorn hunt and its masters (London: John C. Nimmo, 1899): chapter Mr H. Meynell, 1753–1800 Three Royal Navy ships have been named HMS Quorn after the hunt.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/surface-fleet/mine-countermeasure/hunt-class/hms-quorn/ |title=HMS Quorn |publisher=Royalnavy.mod.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26[/tpl]

==Today==

Quorn is built around the old A6 road which runs through the centre of the village. On 28 October 1991 a dual carriageway bypass opened taking the A6 away to the north-eastern edge of the village.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dft.gov.uk/pgr/economics/rdg/onseoftraffictoincreased3101.pdf |title=Pages 5 & 6 |publisher=Dft.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-26[/tpl]
The village has a train station called "Quorn and Woodhouse", shared with the neighbouring hamlet of Woodhouse, which was on the national Great Central Railway network.  The station is now on the preserved Great Central Steam Railway. Numerous royal visitors have disembarked at the station to take part in the Quorn Hunt, including the Prince of Wales (later Kind Edward VIII).http://www.railwayarchive.org.uk/stories/pages.php?enum=LE128&pnum=6&maxp=9 As well as being a site of historical and cultural interest throughout the year, the station hosts a fireworks display on the Bonfire weekend.
Sarson Street, running adjacent to Rawlins Community College, features many 19th Century terraced cottages, formerly those of framework knitters. Framework knitting was a major local industry until the onset of major mechanisation, and the cottages along this road display certain features typical of such an activity. Large windows for example were intended to allow in the necessary amount of light by which to work.
M. Wright & Sons Ltd have been manufacturing fabrics at Quorn Mill, on Leicester Road, since 1870.

"The Banks" area of the village is an ornate paved area with seating, designed to resemble the letter 'Q' when seen from the air.
The village prides itself on its green spaces, and more evidence of this can be seen with the opposition to proposed development at Caves field. This is a large cricket pitch with a pavilion near the centre of Quorn, which was the focus of interest from a housing development company. Objection was widespread, not only at the prospect of losing the cricket field but also due to the threat to a neighbouring wetland ecosystem, considered valuable by environmentalists and the village population.
In the past few years, efforts have been made to cater for the local young people. These have resulted in a half pipe being built next to the basketball court on the park, and a green shelter erected on the same site. The large park, with its shaded area by the stream, large football pitch and half pipe now appeals to people of all ages. Examples of how the park contributes to the village can be seen at the large and successful Mayday fete, as well as the local pub football matches occasionally held there.
