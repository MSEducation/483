Mountain Province ([tpl]lang-fil|Lalawigang Bulubundukin[/tpl]), is a landlocked province of the Philippines in the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon. Its capital is Bontoc. 
Mountain Province is sometimes incorrectly named Mountain in some foreign references. The name is also incorrectly shortened by locals to Mt. Province, which in turn is read by native Anglophones as "Mount Province". The province was named so for being in the Cordillera Central mountain range found in the upper realms of Luzon island.
Mountain Province was also the name of the historical province that included most of the current Cordillera provinces. This old province was established by the Americans in 1908 and was later split in 1966 into Mountain Province, Benguet, Kalinga, Apayao and Ifugao.

The area of the Cordillera mountains proved difficult to control by the Spaniards.

The area was divided into politico-military commandancias but the Spaniards never able to fully subjugate it.[tpl]cite web|title=Mt.

During the American rule, the entire area of the Cordilleras was made one large province in 1908, named Mountain Province. The first governor was Samuel Cane, and the town of Bontoc was made the capital. It was originally composed of the subprovinces of Amburayan, Apayao, Benguet, Bontoc, Ifugao, Kalinga and Lepanto. Amburayan and Lepanto were later added to the subprovinces of Bontoc and Benguet.
Effective on April 7, 1967, the subprovinces were converted into 4 independent provinces: Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga-Apayao and Mountain Province (corresponding to the former Bontoc subprovince). On June 15, 1987, Mountain Province became part of the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR).
