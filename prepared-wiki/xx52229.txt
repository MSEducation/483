[[Azide]]

CATEGORIES: Functional groups, Azides

Azide is the anion with the formula N3−.  It is the conjugate base of hydrazoic acid (HN3).  N3− is a linear anion that is isoelectronic with CO2 and N2O.  Per valence bond theory, azide can be described by several resonance structures, an important one being N−=N+=N−.  Azide is also a functional group in organic chemistry,  RN3.  The dominant application of azides is as a propellant in air bags.

==Applications==

About 250 tons of azide-containing compounds are produced annually, the main product being sodium azide.Horst H. Jobelius, Hans-Dieter Scharff "Hydrazoic Acid and Azides" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  [tpl]DOI|10.1002/14356007.a13_193[/tpl]

===Detonators and propellants===

Sodium azide is the propellant in automobile air bags.  It decomposes on heating to give nitrogen gas, which is used to quickly expand the air bag:
Heavy metal salts, such as lead azide, Pb(N3)2, are shock-sensitive detonators which decompose to the corresponding metal and nitrogen, for example:Shriver and Atkins. Inorganic Chemistry (Fifth Edition). W. H. Freeman and Company, New York, pp 382.
Silver and barium salts are used similarly. Some organic azides are potential rocket propellants an example being 2-Dimethylaminoethylazide(DMAZ).

===Other===

Because of the hazards associated with their use, few azides are used commercially although they exhibit interesting reactivity for researchers. Low molecular weight azides especially are considered hazardous and are avoided.  In the research laboratory, azides are precursors to amines. They are also popular for their participation in the "click reaction" and in Staudinger ligation. These two reactions are generally quite reliable, lending themselves to combinatorial chemistry. 
The antiviral drug zidovudine (AZT) contains an azido group. Some azides are valuable as bioorthogonal chemical reporters.

==Preparation==

The principal source of the azide moiety is sodium azide. Sodium azide is made industrially by the reaction of nitrous oxide, N2O with sodium amide, NaNH2, in liquid ammonia as solvent. The overall stoichiometry is given by [tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd|page=433[/tpl]
Most inorganic and organic azides are prepared directly or indirectly from sodium azide. For example, lead azide, used in detonators,  may be prepared from the metathesis reaction between lead nitrate and sodium azide. As a pseudohalogen compound, sodium azide generally displaces an appropriate leaving group (e.g. Br, I, OTs) to give the azido compound.
Aryl azides may be prepared by displacement of the appropriate diazonium salt with sodium azide, or trimethylsilyl azide; nucleophilic aromatic substitution is also possible, even with chlorides. Anilines and aromatic hydrazines undergo diazotization, as do alkyl amines and hydrazines.[tpl]cite journal | author = S. Bräse, C. Gil, K. Knepper and V.

Appropriately functionalized aliphatic compounds undergo nucleophilic substitution with sodium azide. Aliphatic alcohols give azides via a variant of the Mitsunobu reaction, with the use of hydrazoic acid. Hydrazines may also form azides by reaction with sodium nitrite:[tpl]OrgSynth | title = Phenyl azide | author = R. O. Lindsay and C. F. H.

The azo-transfer compounds, trifluoromethanesulfonyl azide and imidazole-1-sulfonyl azide, are prepared from sodium azide as well. They react with amines to give the corresponding azides:

===Dutt–Wormall reaction===

A classic method for the synthesis of azides is the Dutt–Wormall reaction[tpl]cite journal | title = CCXLI.—The action of diazo-salts on aromatic sulphonamides.

Soc., Trans. | doi = 10.1039/CT9211902088 | year = 1921 | volume = 119 | pages = 2088[/tpl] in which a diazonium salt reacts with a sulfonamide first to a diazoaminosulfinate and then on hydrolysis  the azide and a sulfinic acid.Name Reactions: A Collection of Detailed Reaction Mechanisms by Jie Jack Li Published 2003 Springer ISBN 3-540-40203-9

==Reactions==

===Inorganic azides===

Azide salts can decompose with release of large volumes of nitrogen gas as discussed under Applications.  
Protonation of azide salts gives toxic hydrazoic acid in the presence of strong acids:
Azide salts may react with heavy metals or heavy metal compounds to give the corresponding azides, which are more shock sensitive than sodium azide alone. They decompose with sodium nitrite when acidified. This is a method of destroying residual azides, prior to disposal.[tpl]cite book | title = Prudent practices in the laboratory: handling and disposal of chemicals | year = 1995 | publisher = National Academy Press | location = Washington, D.C. | isbn = 0-309-05229-7 | url = http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=4911&page=165 | author = Committee on Prudent Practices for Handling, Storage, and Disposal of Chemicals in Laboratories, Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology, Commission on Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and Applications, National Research Council.[/tpl]
Many inorganic covalent azides, e.g. chlorine, bromine, and iodine azides, have been described.[tpl]cite journal | author = I. C. Tornieporth-Oetting and T. M. Klapötke | title = Covalent Inorganic Azides | journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages = 511–520 | doi = 10.1002/anie.199505111 | year = 1995[/tpl]
The azide anion behaves as a nucleophile; it undergoes nucleophilic substitution for both aliphatic and aromatic systems. It reacts with epoxides, causing a ring-opening; it undergoes Michael-like conjugate addition to 1,4-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.
Azides can be used as precursors of the metal nitrido complexes.  Azide complexes thus is induced to release N2, generating a metal complex in unusual oxidation states (see high-valent iron).

===Organic azides===

Organic azides engage in useful organic reactions. The terminal nitrogen is mildly nucleophilic.  Azides easily extrude diatomic nitrogen, a tendency that is exploited in many reactions such as the Staudinger ligation or the Curtius rearrangement or for example in the synthesis of γ-imino-β-enamino esters.[tpl]cite journal | title = An efficient synthesis of γ-imino- and γ-amino-β-enamino esters | author =  Mangelinckx, S.; Van Vooren, P.; De Clerck, D.; Fülöp, F.; De Kimpea, N. | journal = Arkivoc | year = 2006 | issue = iii | pages = 202–209 | url = http://www.arkat-usa.org/get-file/19626/[/tpl]Reaction conditions: a) sodium azide 4 eq., acetone, 18 hours reflux 92% chemical yield b) isopropyl amine, titanium tetrachloride, diethyl ether 14 hr reflux 83% yield. Azide 2 is formed in a nucleophilic aliphatic substitution reaction displacing chlorine in 1 by the azide anion. The ketone reacts with the amine to an imine which tautomerizes to the enamine in 4. In the next rearrangement reaction nitrogen is expulsed and a proton transferred to 6. The last step is another tautomerization with the formation of the enamine 7 as a mixture of cis and trans isomers
Azides may be reduced to amines by hydrogenolysishttp://www.organic-chemistry.org/synthesis/N1H/reductionsazides.shtm or with a phosphine, e.g. triphenylphosphine, in the Staudinger reaction. This reaction allows azides to serve as protected -NH2 synthons, as illustrated by the synthesis of 1,1,1-tris(aminomethyl)ethane:
In the azide alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition, organic azides react as 1,3-dipoles, reacting with alkynes to give substituted 1,2,3-triazoles. This reaction is very popular in click chemistry.
Another azide regular is tosyl azide here in reaction with norbornadiene in a nitrogen insertion reaction:[tpl]cite journal | title = A Facile Synthesis of a Polyhydroxylated 2-Azabicyclo3.2.1octane | author = Damon D.
