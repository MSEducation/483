Jaclyn Marie Dowaliby (May 17, 1981 - September 14, 1988) was an American seven-year-old girl who disappeared from her bedroom in the middle of the night. Her body was found five days later.

==Disappearance==

On 10 September 1988, seven-year-old Jaclyn was taken from her bed at some point in the middle of the night. The next morning, her mother reported her as a missing child, possibly an abduction. They found a broken window, but it may have been a phony entry area as Jaclyn's adoptive father later recalled the back door left open. The police investigation was below par as the police failed to preserve the crime scene. Search parties were organized, but for five days, Jaclyn was nowhere to be found.

==Death and legacy==

On 14 September 1988, Jaclyn's lifeless remains were found abandoned at a dump site six miles away from the home. An autopsy revealed she had been killed the night she went missing. Police suspected her mother, Cynthia Dowaliby and her adoptive father, David Dowaliby. In 1990 they were put on trial for their daughter's murder. Cynthia was acquitted but David was convicted on eyewitness testimony which placed him at the scene where Jaclyn's body was found. In 1991, an appellate court overturned David's conviction, ruling that there was no more evidence against him than there had been against Cynthia.
As of July 2012, no one else has been arrested in connection with Jaclyn's murder.

==Gone in the Night==

In 1996, a television film was released, entitled Gone in the Night. It was based on Jaclyn's disappearance and murder, and starred Kevin Dillon and Shannen Doherty as David and Cynthia Dowaliby.
