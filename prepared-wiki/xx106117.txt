[[Pantao]]

CATEGORIES: Barangays of Albay

Pantao is a community in the western coastal area of the Albay province in central Philippines.

==Language==

Like all of Albay, Bikol is the primary language.  Some residents may also speak English or Tagalog.  The dialect spoken in Pantao is akin to those spoken in the coastal towns of Camarines Sur, but also very similar to those spoken in Oas, Ligao, and Polangui.

==Transport==

The Pantao Regional Port is located in the center of the Bicol Peninsula. The Philippine Ports Authority(PPA) spent more than 82 million peso on this port in an attempt to boost the local infrastructure and raise Bicol from being the second poorest region in the Philippines.  This centrally located haven is smaller than the main ports of Legazpi and Tabaco but provides the region with access to the Visayan and Mindanao markets.
