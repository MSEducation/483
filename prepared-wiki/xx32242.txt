The Commodore PET (''Personal Electronic Transactor'') is a home/personal computer produced in 1977 by Commodore International.  A top-seller in the Canadian and United States educational markets, it was Commodore's first full-featured computer, and formed the basis for their entire 8-bit product line.

==History==

===Origins and the early models===

In the 1970s Commodore was one of many electronics companies selling calculators designed around Dallas-based Texas Instruments (TI) CPU chips.  However, in 1975 TI increased the price of these components to the point where the chip set cost more than an entire TI calculator, and the industry that had built up around it was frozen out of the market.
Commodore responded to this by searching for a chip set they could purchase outright.  They quickly found MOS Technology, who were in the process of bringing their 6502 microprocessor design to market, and with whom came Chuck Peddle's KIM-1 design, a small computer kit based on the 6502. At Commodore, Peddle convinced Jack Tramiel that calculators were a dead-end.
In September 1976 Peddle got a demonstration of Jobs and Wozniak's Apple II prototype, when Jobs was offering to sell it to Commodore, but Commodore considered Jobs' offer too expensive.Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs, 2011.
Tramiel demanded that Peddle, Bill Seiler, and John Feagans create a computer in time for the June 1977 Consumer Electronics Show, and gave them six months to do it.[tpl]Citation | last =Bagnall | first = Brian | title = On The Edge — The Spectacular Rise and Fall of Commodore | publisher = Variant Press | year =2006 | location =Winnipeg, Manitoba | page =53 | isbn =0-9738649-0-7[/tpl] Tramiel's son, Leonard, helped design the PETSCII graphic characters and acted as quality control.
The result was the first all-in-one home computer, the PET, the first model of which was the PET 2001.  Its 6502 processor controlled the screen, keyboard, cassette tape recorders and any peripherals connected to one of the computer's several expansion ports.[tpl]Harvnb|Anon|1978|p=1[/tpl]  The PET 2001 included either [tpl]nowrap|4 kB[/tpl] (2001-4) or [tpl]nowrap|8 kB[/tpl] (2001-8) of 8-bit RAM, and was essentially a single-board computer with discrete logic driving a small built-in monochrome monitor with [tpl]nowrap|40×25[/tpl] character graphics, enclosed in a sheet metal case that reflected Commodore's background as a manufacturer of office equipment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.portcommodore.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=larry:comp:commodore:pet:start|title=The Commodore PET[/tpl] Designed on an appliance computer philosophy similar to the original Macintosh [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.commodoremagazine.com/2010/05/pet2001-original-macintosh.html |title=PET2001: The Original Macintosh |publisher=Commodoremagazine |date=May 8, 2010[/tpl] the machine also included a built-in Datasette for data storage located on the front of the case, which left little room for the keyboard. The data transfer rate to cassette tape was 1500 baud, but the data was recorded to tape twice for safety, giving an effective rate of 750 baud.http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue57/turbotape.html  The computer's main board carried four expansion ports: extra memory, a second cassette tape recorder interface, a parallel port (mainly used for disk drives and printers) and an IEEE-488 port (mainly used for modems).[tpl]Harvnb|Anon|1978|pp=57–64[/tpl]
The PET 2001 was announced at the Winter CES[tpl]Citation |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa121598.htm |title=The First Hobby and Home Computers: Apple I, Apple II, Commodore PET, and TRS-80 |first=Mary |last=Bellis|publisher=about.com[/tpl] in January 1977 and the first 100 units were shipped later that year in October.[tpl]Citation | author = What's New |date=February 1978 | title = Commodore Ships First PET Computers | journal = BYTE | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | page = 190 | publisher = Byte Publications[/tpl]Commodore press release. "The PET computer made its debut recently as the first 100 units were shipped to waiting customers in mid-October 1977." However, the PET was back-ordered for months and to ease deliveries, early in 1978 Commodore decided to cancel the 4 kB version (also because the user would be left with barely [tpl]nowrap|3 kB[/tpl] of RAM).[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
Although the machine was fairly successful, there were frequent complaints about the tiny calculator-like keyboard, often referred to as a "chiclet keyboard" because the keys resembled the gum candy. The key tops also tended to rub off easily. Reliability was fairly poor, although that was not atypical of many early microcomputers. Because of the poor keyboard on the PET, external replacement ones quickly appeared.
In 1979, Commodore replaced the original PET 2001 with an improved model known as the 2001-N (the N was short for "New"). The new machine used a standard green-phosphor monitor in place of the light blue in the original 2001. It now had a conventional, full-sized keyboard and no longer sported the built-in cassette recorder. The kernel ROM was upgraded to add support for Commodore's newly introduced disk drive line. It was offered in 8kB, 16kB, or 32kB models as the 2001-N8, 2001-N16, and 2001-N32 (the 8kB models were dropped soon after introduction). Finally, Commodore added a machine-language monitor to the kernel ROM that could be accessed by jumping to any memory location with a BRK instruction. It did not include a built-in assembler and required the user to enter hexadecimal numbers for coding.
Sales of the newer machines were strong, and Commodore then introduced the models to Europe.  The result was the CBM 3000 series ('CBM' standing for Commodore Business Machines), which included the 3008, 3016 and 3032 models. Like the 2001-N-8, the 3008 was quickly dropped. The change to CBM occurred because of a trademark dispute with Philips over the PET name.

===Education, business, and computer science===

In 1980, the 4000-series PETs were launched. These used a larger 12" monitor with a redesigned CRT controller and also included the enhanced BASIC 4.0, which added commands for disk functions. By this point, Commodore discovered that people were buying cheaper [tpl]nowrap|8 kB[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|16 kB[/tpl] models of the 3000-series and upgrading the RAM rather than pay extra for the [tpl]nowrap|32 kB[/tpl] model. Because of this, they punched out the memory sockets in the 4016 (there was no [tpl]nowrap|8 kB[/tpl] 4000-series PET) to prevent that practice. The 4032 was a huge success in schools, where its tough all-metal construction and all-in-one design made it better able to stand up to the rigors of classroom use.[tpl]Citation |last=Forster |first=Winnie |authorlink=Winnie Forster |title=The encyclopedia of consoles, handhelds & home computers 1972 - 2005 |year=2005 |publisher=GAMEPLAN |isbn=3-00-015359-4|page=23[/tpl]  Just as important in this role was the PET's otherwise underutilized IEEE-488 port.  Used wisely, the port could be used as a simple local area network and allowed printers and disk drives (which were then very expensive) to be shared among all of the machines in the classroom.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]Unlike later Commodore machines, PETs had no kernel ROM functions for the IEEE-488 port and users had to write their own for using peripherals such as modems.
The PET's simple, rugged design and completely enclosed components made it an early favorite in the North American education market. At one point Commodore owned 67% of the Canadian education market.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archive.org/stream/run-magazine-30/Run_Issue_30_1986_Jun#page/n63/mode/2up|title=RUN Magazine Issue 30[/tpl] Schools preferred the 40-column models because the 40-column display's larger characters vs. the 80xx PETs were easier for young children to read. Commodore manufactured a variation on the PET called "Teacher's PET" - these were relabeled 2001-series PETs which were donated by Commodore as part of a "buy 2 get 1 free" program offered to schools as part of a promotion/tax write-off scheme.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.portcommodore.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=larry:comp:commodore:pet:pet_faq-models|title=PET/CBM FAQ - MODELS OF THE PET/CBM[/tpl]
Two more machines were released in the PET series.  The 8000 series included a new display chip which drove an 80×25 character screen, but this resulted in a number of software incompatibilities with programs designed for the 40 column screen, and it appears to have been unpopular as a result.  The machine shipped with 32 kB standard as the 8032, but allowed another 64 kB to be added externally.  Later the upgrade was installed from the factory, creating the 8096.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl] Unlike the 40-column models, 8000-series PETs came standard with a 1-channel speaker for sound generation.
2001/3000 and 4000-series PETs used what became known as the "graphics keyboard". Numbers were exclusively on the numeric keypad and the row above the alphabet keys had only punctuation symbols. The 3032 and 4032 were produced in two special variants known as the B models with the so-called "business keyboard", which had a conventional layout with mathematical symbols and numbers above the alphabet keys. The keypad contained only numerals. On the other hand, all 8000-series PETs sported the business layout.
The 4000/8000 PETs were more explicitly targeted at professional/business use than the 2001/3000. Business customers were the main target for the features of the enhanced BASIC 4.0. A large line of 5.25" and 8" floppy drives were made for the PET family, and even 5 and 7MB external hard disks. While they became fairly popular for business use in Europe, they failed to make much impact on the US market in part because the 6502-based PETs could not run CP/M, which had become the standard for business software.
As noted above, 4000 and 8000-series PETs used larger monitors and a different video controller than the 2001/3000 models. This created a notorious compatibility problem known as "the killer POKE". On 2001/3000 PETs, there was a register which when enabled did not allow reading/writing of the video RAM except during the vertical blanking in order to prevent snow on the screen (caused by the CPU and video controller trying to access the VRAM at the same time). Ordinarily, this feature was enabled on power-up. If the user didn't mind snow, he could turn it off and get faster text output. BASIC programs and some machine-language software commonly did this for performance reasons. 4000/8000 PETs used a video controller based on the Motorola 6845 CRTC chip (unlike the TTL logic circuit in 2001/3000s) that eliminated the snow problem, but also placed a CRT control register in place of where the VBLANK flag had been on the 2001/3000. Hence software that tried to disable it would end up throwing the monitor out of sync and destroying the flyback transformer. BASIC programs intended for the 2001/3000 thus had to be modified in order to run safely on the 4000/8000.
The last in the series was the SP9000, known as the SuperPET or MicroMainframe.  This machine was designed at the University of Waterloo for teaching programming.  In addition to the basic CBM 8000 hardware, the 9000 added a second CPU in the form of the Motorola 6809, more RAM and included a number of programming languages including BASIC in ROM for the 6502 and APL, COBOL, FORTRAN, Pascal and a 6809 assembler on floppies for the 6809.  It also included a terminal program which allowed the machine to be used as a "smart terminal" as well, so this single machine could replace many of the boxes currently in use at the university. Additionally this machine became a remote development environment where the user could later upload their creation to a mainframe after completing development and testing on the SuperPET.http://www.commodore.ca/products/pet/commodore_pet.htm
Commodore tried to update the PET line with a new redesign called the CBM-II series (also known as the B series). These were not as successful and were ultimately abandoned. However, due to demand, the original PET machines were revived and the CBM-II case style was retained. These were known as the SK's (due to the separated keyboard). They also had a swivel monitor. Originally, standard 8032 boards were retrofitted into these cases. Later the SK models got a new mainboard that already included the [tpl]nowrap|64 kB[/tpl] extension directly on the board and were sold as 8296 or, with a built-in 8250 dual disk drive, as 8296-D. The revived PET line also included a new pair of floppy drives, the SFD-1001 and 2031 (see below for more info).
Although not officially a member of the PET series, in 1983 Commodore packaged C64 motherboards in plastic cases similar to the PET 4000-series in order to create the Educator 64. This was an attempt to retake some of the education market they had largely lost by then to the Apple IIe.

===Graphics display===

In the home computer market the PET line was soon outsold by machines that supported high-resolution color graphics and sound, mainly the Apple II (which shipped in June 1977), Atari 400/800 (1979), and, in particular, Commodore's own bestselling VIC-20 (1980/81). Commodore released a High Resolution Graphic board for the PET using the Thomson EF936x graphics chip with a resolution of 512×512 pixels.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbmhardware.de/cbmwiki/index.php/PET-Grafikkarte_Commodore_ASSY_No._324402-01_für_CBM_8296 |title=PET-Grafikkarte Commodore ASSY No. 324402-01 für CBM 8296 |publisher=CBMPET.DE[/tpl] In addition, the Apple II and TRS-80 Model I could be expanded to a maximum of 48k of RAM while the PET was limited to 32k.
Without the board, the PET's graphics capabilities were limited to a character set hardwired in ROM. On many of the PET range's home computer rivals, the look-up address of the character graphics could be changed and pointed to RAM, where new characters could be defined by a programmer to create custom graphics shapes. From a programming point of view, this was a relatively simple method of producing good-looking graphics. BASIC programs often could not achieve acceptable speed animating bitmap graphics, but since this technique only involved moving character objects on the screen, BASIC could achieve acceptable performance. Many BASIC programs were made this way even on bitmap-capable machines. Still, the PET's lack of a remappable character set is a major weakness in the machine's design.
Somewhat offsetting this drawback, the PET's ROM-restricted character set—an ASCII-1963 deviation known as PETSCII—was one of the most varied and flexible of the era, allowing PET games with rudimentary graphics to be created, exemplified by clones of video games such as Space Invaders. This flexibility was achieved by the use of two switchable character sets, allowing the choice of either mixed-case characters, or uppercase with graphics; either could also be displayed as a reverse field, negative image. Also, this was an era in which many popular text adventure games did not need graphics at all. For specialized applications, alternative character sets could be programmed into an EPROM inserted in the character set ROM socket. Alternative character set EPROMs with diacritics and mathematical symbols were available in the aftermarket. A 2001-8B model with katakana keyboard and character set was sold in Japan. thumb|Commodore Pet Katakana Keyboard
Other than a PC speaker-class beeper, PETs did not have sound hardware (except for the 8000 models), but it was possible to rig a circuit up to the IEEE-488 port that could be used to output square wave tones to an external amplifier, and some games supported this feature.
The PET had two empty sockets on the motherboard for adding expansion ROMs, which could be a total of 8k in size. A predecessor to the cartridge slots on later Commodore machines, they allowed various software add-ons such as machine language monitors. In addition, it was common for commercial programs to include a copy protection ROM that had to be installed prior to running the application; something of an inconvenience to users owning multiple applications protected in this way, as the chips would have to be swapped in order to run their respective programs.

===Peripherals===

Commodore Business Machines made a variety of disk drives available for the PET, using the IEEE 488 interface, including:
The original lineup of disk drives for the PET were the dual-unit 4040, 8050, and 8250. Later (near the end of the PET's lifespan), single-unit 2031 and SFD-1001 drives were produced that used the same case as the 1540/1541, but sported the PET's parallel interface instead of the VIC-20/C64 IEC interface. The 4040/2031 used the same [tpl]nowrap|170 kB[/tpl] format as the 1541 and is completely read/write compatible (although software that performs low-level drive access will not work). 8050 and 8250 drives had an incompatible [tpl]nowrap|500 kB[/tpl]/[tpl]nowrap|1 MB[/tpl] format, but were popular well into the 1980s as server/BBS storage devices because of their large capacity.
In addition, Commodore had 8" 8280 drives which used MFM encoding instead of the GCR used on their other disk drives and was mainly intended to allow PET users to read disks written on IBM mainframes/minicomputers. [tpl]nowrap|5 MB[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|7.5 MB[/tpl] hard disks were produced as well. They have no directory support and are treated by the kernel ROM as simply a larger floppy disk.
All PET peripherals will work on VIC-20/C64/Plus 4/C128 machines with a parallel -> IEC adapter (reverse IEC -> parallel adapters were also made), and as mentioned above, 8050/8250 drives were sometimes used on C64s for BBS service because of their large capacity and faster interface.
An alternative option for adding floppy disk capability to the PET was the Computhink disk system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.commodore.ca/gallery/magazines/compute/Compute-002.pdf|title=Compute - The Journal of Progressive Computing - 002|page=19|date=January–February 1980|accessdate=2013-04-26|format=pdf[/tpl] Although references to this system are hard to find today, it was nevertheless popular at the time, as it was both cheaper than the Commodore system and available from an earlier date. Unlike the Commodore units, it did not use the IEEE488 interface, but instead required an extra circuit board to be installed inside the PET, connected to the PET's expansion connector, which used a Western Digital floppy controller chip to provide a standard Shugart interface.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.forum64.de/wbb3/board13-sonstige-commodore/board16-cbm-rechner/1328-pet-floppyplatine/|accessdate=2013-04-26|title=Pet Floppyplatine (in German)[/tpl] The board also held extra RAM for use as a disk transfer buffer, and ROM containing the disk operating software. This software was not compatible with Commodore standards and was somewhat awkward to use. Before using the disk system it had to be initialised manually by issuing the command SYS45056. This made available a set of "pseudo-BASIC" commands for performing disk operations, which bore little or no resemblance to the standard Commodore commands for the same operations and in addition had to be prefixed with $, thus breaking the rules of BASIC syntax. It had a severe limitation in that it was only possible to have one file open at a time which made many common tasks difficult and slow. The additional code hooked into the BASIC interpreter could slow the execution of BASIC programs by 20-30%, and it would break with programs which used the standard POKE to disable user breaks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://maben.homeip.net/static/S100/commodore/systems/PET/books/Programming%20the%20Commodore%20PET.pdf|title=Programming the Commodore PET|format=pdf|pages=205–217|accessdate=2013-04-26[/tpl] Nevertheless it was still a useful system and a great improvement over cassette storage.
