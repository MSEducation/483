[[Last Generation Sponsorship]]

CATEGORIES: Sponsorships

Last generation sponsorship is a term conceived by Kim Skildum-Reid to reflect the maturing and evolving of sponsorship.

==History==

The first generation of sponsorship, driven by gaining exposure and awareness, was the norm throughout the 70s and early 80s. The second generation emerged in the mid 80s to the early 90s and focused on sales; immediate gains were the primary consideration. Long-term benefits were rarely considered. This generation has largely disappeared, with the exception of brands that sponsor primarily to gain vending rights.
The third generation became popular in the early 90s, and is still in use today. Particular focuses of this generation are brand needs, integration, and the achievement of multiple marketing objectives.  It is good sponsorship, but its full potential will only be realized by shifting the focus from “what can we get?” to “what can we offer?”PROMO magazine, January 2008

==The fourth or last generation==

The focus of the last generation sponsorship is on nurturing a brand’s connection with a target market. The means of gaining this connection is by putting the needs of the target market first.  This is done utilizing emotional and relevant marketing media focusing on improving the relationship with the target market and the brand.PROMO Magazine, January 2008
