==Early life==

Beam was raised in Chapin, South Carolina, where his father worked in land management and his mother was a schoolteacher. When he was a child, his family took regular trips to the country, where his grandfather ran a farm. He attended Seven Oaks Elementary School, Chapin Middle School, and Chapin High School. While home from college, he was a waiter at California Dreaming restaurant in Columbia. Beam earned a bachelor's degree in art from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia. He specialized in painting. He graduated from the Florida State University Film School with an MFA degree. Before the release of the first Iron & Wine album, Beam's main source of income was as a professor of film and cinematography at the University of Miami and Miami International University of Art & Design.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2008-04-10/music/iron-and-wine/a | title= Iron and Wine, Jason Ferguson, Miami New Times, April 10, 2008[/tpl] He had been writing songs for over seven years before a friend lent him a four-track recorder. He began making demos and gave one to his friend Michael Bridwell, brother of Band of Horses lead singer, Ben Bridwell. Michael handed it to Mike McGonigal, editor of Yeti magazine, who chose "Dead Man's Will", later released on In the Reins, for inclusion on one of his magazine's compilation CDs. Beam later came to the attention of Sub Pop Records co-owner, Jonathan Poneman, who contacted Beam to propose a deal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.splendidezine.com/features/iron/ | title="Iron and Wine", Georgiana Cohen, splendidezine.com[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thehighhat.com/Pop&Clicks/002/iron_and_wine.html | title="Planting Together: An interview with Iron and Wine’s Sam Beam", Maud Newton[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pandora.com/music/artist/iron+wine | title="Iron & Wine: Biography", James Christopher Monger, Rovi[/tpl]

==Musical career==

Beam released his first Iron & Wine album, The Creek Drank the Cradle, on the Sub Pop label in 2002. Beam wrote, performed, recorded and produced the album in his home studio. Featuring acoustic guitars, banjo, and slide guitar, the album's music has been compared to that of Nick Drake,[tpl]cite web | last=Kearney | first=Ryan | title=Iron & Wine: The Creek Drank the Cradle | publisher=Pitchfork Media | date=2002-10-02 | url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4126-the-creek-drank-the-cradle/ | accessdate=2010-10-11 [/tpl] Simon and Garfunkel,[tpl]cite web | last=Bickford | first=B.R. | title=Iron & Wine: "The Creek Drank the Cradle" | publisher=Salon.com | date=2003-02-19 | url=http://dir.salon.com/story/audio/music/2003/02/19/iron_wine/index.html | accessdate=2006-05-14 [/tpl] Elliott Smith, Neil Young and John Fahey.
Also in 2002, Beam recorded a cover of The Postal Service's then-unreleased song "Such Great Heights". Rather than being included on an Iron & Wine release, the track was initially included as a b-side of the original version by The Postal Service. It was later included on the B-sides and rarities album, Around the Well. He then followed up on his debut album in 2003 with The Sea & The Rhythm, an EP containing other home-recorded tracks with a similar style to the songs on the debut.
Beam's second full-length album, Our Endless Numbered Days (2004), was recorded in a professional studio with a significant increase in fidelity. Produced in Chicago by Brian Deck, the focus was still on acoustic material, but the inclusion of other band members gave rise to a slightly different sound. That same year, he recorded the song "The Trapeze Swinger" for the film In Good Company, and had his version of "Such Great Heights" featured in an advertisement for M&M's and in the film and soundtrack for Garden State. This version was later used in a 2006 Ask.com advertisement, and eventually released as a single in 2006 backed with recordings of "The Trapeze Swinger" and "Naked as We Came" made for Radio Vienna.
In February 2005, he released an EP entitled Woman King, which expanded on the sounds of his previous LP with the addition of  electric guitars. Each track features a spiritual female figure, and had subtle Biblical undertones.
The EP In the Reins, a collaboration with the Arizona-based rock band Calexico, was released in September 2005. Beam wrote all of the EP's songs years earlier, but Calexico added their trademark fusion of southwestern rock, traditional Mexican music and jazz to the songs' arrangements. Several tracks, most notably, "Burn That Broken Bed", feature brass instruments, a first for Beam's music.[tpl]cite AV media notes |title=In The Reins |others=Iron & Wine |date=2011 |title=Burn That Broken Bed [/tpl]
