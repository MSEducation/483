=="Unofficial" practices==

Like many fraternal organizations, Omega Psi Phi has a rich tradition of terminology and practices that are officially unsanctioned by their national leadership.  While some traditions are naturally secret, many are freely expressed in public.  A popular one is referring to members as "Que Dogs" or "Ques" for short.[tpl]Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = "Q Dog" via Google Search returns Omega Psi Phi | url = http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&biw=1280&bih=834&q=%22Q+Dog%22&aq=f&aqi=g2g-c1g7&aql=f&oq= | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 14 April 2011 [/tpl]  Another is the practice of members voluntarily undergoing branding of the letters, or variations and designs based on them (such as two linked Omega symbols), on their skin.  The brands often are displayed in public as a matter of pride; some prospects first learn of the fraternity by seeing members bearing brands.[ref]
