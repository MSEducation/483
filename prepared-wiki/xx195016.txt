In a retrospective review of the single, Allmusic journalist Stewart Mason said that the layers of synths on the song and Ian McCulloch's overdubbed vocals on the chorus add to the "psychedelic haze of the track". Mason wrote: "Bring On the Dancing Horses has a dreamily catchy chorus and a nice melody."http://www.allmusic.com/song/bring-on-the-dancing-horses-mt0033752798
