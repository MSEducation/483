CKTS was an English language Canadian radio station located in Sherbrooke, Quebec. It broadcast on 900 kHz with a power of 10,000 watts as a class B station, using a directional antenna which had a slightly directional pattern during the day and a much tighter pattern at night.
The station was shut down in 2006 by its owner, Corus Entertainment.

==History==

CKTS went on the air on July 1, 1946. The station originally broadcast on 1240Â kHz, and was operated by Telegram Printing & Publishing, the owner of the local weekly Sherbrooke Telegram-Observer. It was an affiliate of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Trans-Canada Network by 1957. The station moved to 900 AM in 1959, and was sold to Telemedia in the late 1960s.
During the 1970s, it also aired programming produced by Radio Bishop's, the campus radio club of Bishop's University, which would later become CJMQ-FM. 
As the English-speaking population declined in the Eastern Townships, the station tried to appeal to francophones, and by the mid-1980s the station had a Top 40 format with minimal spoken word content. Most of the advertising on the station was in French and most listeners were francophones, much to the displeasure of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. 
In 1989, the CRTC forced CKTS to use only English.CRTC Decision 89-496 As a result, by 1992 the station was acting as a de facto rebroadcaster of Standard Broadcasting's news/talk station CJAD in Montreal, with its only local programming consisting of a church service that aired every Sunday morning for half an hour.
Standard Broadcasting acquired Telemedia in 2002, bringing CJAD and CKTS under common ownership. However, Standard soon sold CKTS to Corus Entertainment in January 2005. Despite the fact that Corus had its own English news/talk radio station in Montreal, CINW, CKTS continued to air programming from CJAD.
