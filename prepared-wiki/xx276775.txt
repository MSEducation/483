The deaths of the white settlers led to great panic with nearby Virginia City, NV.  A local militia force was quickly assembled under the leadership of William Ormsby.  Ormsby was defeated at the first Battle of Pyramid Lake which in turn led to a second, more sizeable, force led by John C. Hays to be assembled.  Haysâ€™ force returned to the site of Williams Station and won a small victory there before being united with U.S. Regular Army forces under Joseph Stewart.  
The site of Williams Station is now submerged beneath Lahontan Reservoir.
