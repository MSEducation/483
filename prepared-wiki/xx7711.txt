==History==

The land around Marquette was known to French missionaries of the early 17th century and the trappers of the early 19th century. Development of the area did not begin, however, until 1844, when William Burt and Jacob Houghton (the brother of geologist Douglass Houghton) discovered iron deposits near Teal Lake west of Marquette. In 1845, Jackson Mining Company, the first organized mining company in the region, was formed.Eckert, Kathryn Bishop (2000). The Sandstone Architecture of the Lake Superior Region, pp. 89–91. Detroit: Wayne State University Press. ISBN 0-8143-2807-5.
The village of Marquette began on September 14, 1849, with the formation of a second iron concern, the Marquette Iron Company. Three men participated in organizing the firm: Robert J. Graveraet, who had prospected the region for ore; Edward Clark, agent for Waterman A. Fisher of Worcester, Massachusetts, who financed the company, and Amos Rogers Harlow. The village was at first called New Worcester, with Harlow as the first postmaster. On August 21, 1850, the name was changed to honor Jacques Marquette, the French Jesuit missionary who had explored the region. A second post office, named Carp River, was opened on October 13, 1851 by Peter White, who had come there with Graveraet at age 18.Inland Seas - Google Boeken Harlow closed his post office in August 1852. The Marquette Iron Company failed, while its successor, the Cleveland Iron Mining Company, flourished and had the village platted in 1854. The plat was recorded by Peter White. White's office was renamed as Marquette in April 1856, and the village was incorporated in 1859. It was incorporated as a city in 1871.[tpl]cite book | last = Romig | first = Walter | year = 1986 | title = Michigan Place Names | origyear= 1973 | publisher = Wayne State University Press | location = Detroit, Michigan | isbn = 0-8143-1838-X[/tpl]
During the 1850s, Marquette was linked by rail to numerous mines and became the leading shipping center of the Upper Peninsula. The first ore pocket dock, designed by an early town leader, John Burt, was built by the Cleveland Iron Mining Company in 1859.Bogue, Margaret Beattie (2007). Around the Shores of Lake Superior: A Guide to Historic Sites, pp. 237–39. University of Wisconsin Press. ISBN 0-299-22174-1. By 1862, the city had a population of over 1,600 and a soaring economy.
In the late 19th century, during the height of iron mining, Marquette became nationally known as a summer haven. Visitors brought in by Great Lakes passenger steamships filled the city's hotels and resorts.
South of the city, K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base was an important Air Force installation during the Cold War, host to B-52H bombers and KC-135 tankers of the Strategic Air Command, as well as a fighter interceptor squadron. The base closed in September 1995, and is now the county's Sawyer International Airport.
Marquette continues to be a shipping port for hematite ores and, today, enriched iron ore pellets, from nearby mines and pelletizing plants. About 7.9 million gross tons of pelletized iron ore passed through Marquette's Presque Isle Harbor in 2005.
The Roman Catholic Bishop Frederic Baraga is buried at St. Peter's Cathedral, which is the center for the Diocese of Marquette.

==In film and literature==

Robert Traver (John Voelker) set his novels Anatomy of a Murder (1958) and Laughing Whitefish (1965) in Marquette. The film version of Anatomy of a Murder, dramatizing a 1952 murder that happened in the area and the subsequent trial, was partly filmed in Marquette and Big Bay. Much of it was filmed in the Marquette County Courthouse in Marquette, where the actual murder case had been tried.  Traver's Danny and the Boys (1951) is a collection of short stories set in and around Marquette.
Philip Caputo set his novel Indian Country (1987) in the Upper Peninsula and several scenes depict Marquette.

==Parks, sports and recreation==

The city of Marquette has a number of parks and recreational facilities which are used by city and county residents. Presque Isle Park is Marquette's most popular park located on the north side of the city. It includes [tpl]convert|323|acre|ha[/tpl] of mostly forested land and juts out into Lake Superior. The park was designed by Fredrick Law Olmsted, the same Olmsted that designed Central Park in New York. Amenities include a wooden band shell for concerts, a park pavilion, a gazebo, a marina, a concession stand, picnic tables, barbecue pits, walking/skiing trails, playground facilities, and Moosewood Nature Center.
The city has two popular beaches, South Beach Park and McCarty's Cove. McCarty's Cove, flanked by the red U.S. Coast Guard Station lighthouse on its south shore, serves as a reprieve from hot summer days, where city and county residents alike take advantage of the cool, but tolerable, water temperatures and the cooling effects of the lake-generated sea breeze. Both beaches have picnic areas, grills, children's playgrounds and lifeguard stands.
Other parks include Tourist Park, Founder's Landing, LaBonte Park, Mattson Lower Harbor Park, Park Cemetery, Shiras Park, Williams Park, Harlow Park, Pocket Park, Spring Street Park and Father Marquette Park.
There are also numerous other recreational facilities located within the city. Lakeview Arena is best known for its use as an ice hockey facility, but it also hosts a number of public events.  A skateboard park is located just outside of the arena and open during the summer. Lakeview Arena was home to the Marquette Electricians and Marquette Senior High School's Redmen hockey team. In 1974, the arena replaced the historic Palestra, which had been located a few blocks away. Gerard Haley Memorial Baseball field home of the Marquette Blues and Reds is located in the north side along with numerous little league and softball fields.
The city is also known for fishing for deep water lake trout, whitefish, salmon and brown trout.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
Marquette has the largest wooden dome in the world, the Superior Dome – unofficially but affectionately known as the YooperDome. (The second largest, located in Japan, is just one square foot smaller.) During the football season, the Dome is used primarily for football on its newly renovated astro turf field. The turf was installed in July 2009. Northern Michigan University holds its home football games in the Dome, as does the Michigan High School Athletic Association with the upper peninsula's High School football playoffs. The dome also hosts numerous private and public events which draw in thousands from around the region.
The Marquette Golf Club has brought international recognition to the area for its unique and dramatic Greywalls course, opened in 2005. The course features several panoramic views of Lake Superior and winds its way through rocky outcroppings, heaving fairways and a rolling valley, yet is located less than two miles (3 km) from the downtown area.
Marquette also has an extensive network of biking and walking paths throughout the city. The city has been gradually expanding the paths and has been promoting itself as a walkable and livable community. Cross Country ski trails are also located at Presque Isle Park and the Fit Strip.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.presqueisle.org/winter_activities.html|title= Presque Isle State Park – Winter Activities[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl]

==Climate==

Marquette has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) with four distinct seasons that is strongly moderated by Lake Superior and is located in Plant Hardiness zone 5b.[tpl]cite web | url = http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/ | title = USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map | publisher = United States Department of Agriculture | accessdate = May 10, 2013[/tpl] Winters are long and cold with a January average of [tpl]convert|18.8|°F|1[/tpl]. Winter temperatures are slightly warmer than inland locations at a similar latitude due to the release of the heat stored by the lake, which moderates the climate.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/atlas/glat-ch2.html#Climate | title = Natural Processes in the Great Lakes | work = The Great Lakes An Environmental Atlas and Resource Book | publisher = U.S Environmental Protection Agency | accessdate = May 10, 2013[/tpl] On average, there are 11.6 days where the temperature reaches below [tpl]convert|0|°F[/tpl] and most days during winter remain below freezing. However, mild spells of weather can occur time to time. Being located in the snowbelt region, Marquette receives a significant amount of snowfall during the winter months, mostly from lake-effect snow. Because Lake Superior rarely freezes over completely, this enables lake effect snow to persist throughout winter, making Marquette the third snowiest city in the contiguous United States as reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration with an average annual snowfall of [tpl]convert|148.9|in|cm[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url=http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ccd-data/CCD-2011.pdf |title=Comparative Climate Data For the United States Through 2011 |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |page=49 |accessdate=2012-08-01[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] The snow depth in winter usually exceeds [tpl]convert|10|in|cm[/tpl].
Summers are warm with the warmest months, July and August, each averaging [tpl]convert|66.6|°F|1[/tpl], showing somewhat of a seasonal lag. The surrounding lake cools summertime temperatures and as a result, temperatures above [tpl]convert|90|°F[/tpl] are rare, with only 3.4 days per year. Spring and fall are transitional seasons that are generally mild though highly variable due to the alternation of air masses moving quickly. Spring is usually cooler than fall because the surrounding lake is slow to warm than the land while in fall, the lake releases heat, warming the area.
Marquette receives [tpl]convert|29|in|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of precipitation per year, which is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, though September and October are the wettest months with January and February being the driest. The average window for nighttime freezes is October 15 thru May 7. The highest temperature ever recorded in Marquette was [tpl]convert|108|°F|0[/tpl] on July 15, 1901 and the lowest was [tpl]convert|-33|°F|0[/tpl] on February 8, 1861. Marquette receives an average of 2294 hours of sunshine per year or 51% of possible sunshine, ranging from a low of 29% in December to a high of 68% in July.
