Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine that emphasizes diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially the spine, under the belief that these disorders affect general health via the nervous system. Many chiropractors reject being characterized as complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). It is a healthcare profession and although chiropractors have many similarities to primary care providers, they are more similar to a medical specialty like dentistry or podiatry. The main chiropractic treatment technique involves manual therapy, including manipulation of the spine, other joints, and soft tissues; treatment may also includes exercises and health and lifestyle counseling. Traditional chiropractic assumes that a vertebral subluxation or spinal joint dysfunction interferes with the body's function and its innate intelligence. A large number of chiropractors want to separate themselves from the traditional vitalistic concept of innate intelligence.
Many studies of treatments used by chiropractors have been conducted, with conflicting results. Systematic reviews of this research have not demonstrated that chiropractic manipulation is effective, with the possible exception for the treatment of back pain. A critical evaluation found that collectively, spinal manipulation failed to show it was effective for any condition. A Cochrane review found very low to moderate evidence that spinal manipulation therapy was no more effective than inert interventions, sham SMT or as an adjunct therapy for acute low back pain. The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of maintenance chiropractic care are unknown. The evidence suggests that spinal manipulation therapy is safe but the rate of adverse events is unknown as there is under-reporting. It is frequently associated with mild to moderate adverse effects, with serious or fatal complications in rare cases. There is controversy surrounding the level of risk of stroke from cervical manipulation. It has been suggested that the relationship is causative, but this is disputed by many chiropractic proponents of this treatment modality, who believe the association between chiropractic therapy and vertebrobasilar artery stroke is unproven.
Chiropractic is well established in the U.S., Canada and Australia. It overlaps with other manual-therapy professions, including massage therapy, osteopathy, and physical therapy. Most who seek chiropractic care do so for low back pain.
D.D. Palmer founded chiropractic in the 1890s, and his son B.J. Palmer helped to expand it in the early 20th century. It has two main groups: "straights", now the minority, emphasize vitalism, innate intelligence and spinal adjustments, and consider vertebral subluxations to be the cause of all disease; "mixers", the majority, are more open to mainstream views and conventional medical techniques, such as exercise, massage, and ice therapy. Throughout its history, chiropractic has been controversial. For most of its existence it has been at odds with mainstream medicine, sustained by pseudoscientific ideas such as subluxation and innate intelligence that are not based on solid science. Despite the general consensus of public health professionals regarding the benefits of vaccination, among chiropractors there are significant disagreements over the subject, which has led to negative impacts on both public vaccination and mainstream acceptance of chiropractic. The American Medical Association called chiropractic an "unscientific cult" and boycotted it until losing an antitrust case in 1987. Chiropractic has had a strong political base and sustained demand for services; in recent decades, it has gained more legitimacy and greater acceptance among medical physicians and health plans in the U.S., and evidence-based medicine has been used to review research studies and generate practice guidelines. The practice remains at a crossroads between science and ideological dogma.

==Conceptual basis==

===Philosophy===

Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine which focuses on manipulation of the musculoskeletal system, especially the spine. Its founder, D.D. Palmer, called it "a science of healing without drugs".
Chiropractic's origins lie in the folk medicine of bonesetting, and as it evolved it incorporated vitalism, spiritual inspiration and rationalism. Its early philosophy was based on deduction from irrefutable doctrine helped distinguish chiropractic from medicine, provided it with legal and political defenses against claims of practicing medicine without a license, and allowed chiropractors to establish themselves as an autonomous profession. This "straight" philosophy, taught to generations of chiropractors, rejects the inferential reasoning of the scientific method, and relies on deductions from vitalistic first principles rather than on the materialism of science. However, most practitioners tend to incorporate scientific research into chiropractic, and most practitioners are "mixers" who attempt to combine the materialistic reductionism of science with the metaphysics of their predecessors and with the holistic paradigm of wellness. A 2008 commentary proposed that chiropractic actively divorce itself from the straight philosophy as part of a campaign to eliminate untestable dogma and engage in critical thinking and evidence-based research.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=18759966|doi=10.1186/1746-1340-16-10|url=http://chiroandosteo.com/content/pdf/1746-1340-16-10.pdf|date=Aug 2008|last1=Murphy|first1=DR|last2=Schneider|last3=Seaman|last4=Perle|last5=Nelson|title=How can chiropractic become a respected mainstream profession?

Although a wide diversity of ideas exist among chiropractors, they share the belief that the spine and health are related in a fundamental way, and that this relationship is mediated through the nervous system.[tpl]cite book|author= Gay RE, Nelson CF|chapter= Chiropractic philosophy|chapterurl=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=altrehab.section.336|editor= Wainapel SF, Fast A (eds.)|title= Alternative Medicine and Rehabilitation: a Guide for Practitioners|year=2003|isbn=1-888799-66-8|location= New York|publisher= Demos Medical Publishing[/tpl] Chiropractors examine the biomechanics, structure and function of the spine, along with its effects on the musculoskeletal and nervous systems and what they believe to be its role in health and disease.[tpl]cite web|title= History of chiropractic care|author= Physicians Group Management|accessdate=2014-03-22|url=http://www.pgmbilling.com/blog/199-history-of-chiropractic-care[/tpl] Some chiropactors say spinal manipulation can have an effect of a variety of ailments such as irritable bowel syndrome and asthma.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chiropractic/Pages/Introduction.aspx |title=Chiropractic |publisher=NHS Choices |date=1 May 2012 |accessdate=January 2014[/tpl]
Chiropractic philosophy includes the following perspectives:[tpl]cite book|chapterurl=http://chiroweb.com/archives/ahcpr/chapter2.htm|chapter= Chiropractic belief systems|author= Mootz RD, Phillips RB|year=1997|title= Chiropractic in the United States: Training, Practice, and Research|pages=9–16|editor= Cherkin DC, Mootz RD (eds.)|accessdate=2008-02-14|location= Rockville, MD|publisher= Agency for Health Care Policy and Research|oclc=39856366[/tpl] AHCPR Pub No. 98-N002.
Holism assumes that health is affected by everything in an individual's environment; some sources also include a spiritual or existential dimension.[tpl]cite journal |author=Freeman J |title=Towards a definition of holism |journal=Br J Gen Pract |volume=55 |issue=511 |pages=154–5 |date=February 2005 |pmid=15720949 |pmc=1463203[/tpl] In contrast, reductionism in chiropractic reduces causes and cures of health problems to a single factor, vertebral subluxation. Conservatism considers the risks of clinical interventions when balancing them against their benefits. It emphasizes noninvasive treatment to minimize risk, and avoids surgery and medication. Homeostasis emphasizes the body's inherent self-healing abilities. Chiropractic's early notion of innate intelligence can be thought of as a metaphor for homeostasis.[tpl]cite book|author= Keating JC Jr|chapter= Philosophy in chiropractic|pages=77–98|title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic|edition=3rd|editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B et al. (eds.)|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2005|isbn=0-07-137534-1[/tpl] Straights tend to use an approach that focuses on the chiropractor's perspective and the treatment model, whereas mixers tend to focus on the patient and the patient's situation.

===Straights and mixers===

Straight chiropractors adhere to the philosophical principles set forth by D.D. and B.J. Palmer, and retain metaphysical definitions and vitalistic qualities. Straight chiropractors believe that vertebral subluxation leads to interference with an "innate intelligence" exerted via the human nervous system and is a primary underlying risk factor for many diseases. Straights view the medical diagnosis of patient complaints (which they consider to be the "secondary effects" of subluxations) to be unnecessary for chiropractic treatment. Thus, straight chiropractors are concerned primarily with the detection and correction of vertebral subluxation via adjustment and do not "mix" other types of therapies into their practice style. Their philosophy and explanations are metaphysical in nature and they prefer to use traditional chiropractic lexicon terminology (i.e. perform spinal analysis, detect subluxation, correct with adjustment, etc.). They prefer to remain separate and distinct from mainstream health care. Although considered the minority group, "they have been able to transform their status as purists and heirs of the lineage into influence dramatically out of proportion to their numbers."
Mixer chiropractors "mix" diagnostic and treatment approaches from osteopathic, medical, and chiropractic viewpoints and make up the majority of chiropractors. Unlike straight chiropractors, mixers believe subluxation is one of many causes of disease, and hence they tend to be open to mainstream medicine.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kaptchuk TJ, Eisenberg DM |title=Chiropractic: origins, controversies, and contributions |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=158 |issue=20 |pages=2215–24 |date=November 1998 |pmid=9818801 |url=http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?volume=158&page=2215 |doi=10.1001/archinte.158.20.2215[/tpl] Many of them incorporate mainstream medical diagnostics and employ conventional treatments including techniques of physical therapy such as exercise, stretching, massage, ice packs, electrical muscle stimulation, therapeutic ultrasound, and moist heat. Some mixers also use techniques from alternative medicine, including nutritional supplements, acupuncture, homeopathy, herbal remedies, and biofeedback.
Although mixers are the majority group, many of them retain belief in vertebral subluxation as shown in a 2003 survey of 1100 North American chiropractors, which found that 88% wanted to retain the term "vertebral subluxation complex", and that when asked to estimate the percent of disorders of internal organs (such as the heart, the lungs, or the stomach) that subluxation significantly contributes to, the mean response was 62%. A 2008 survey of 6000 American chiropractors demonstrated that most chiropractors seem to believe that a subluxation-based clinical approach may be of limited utility for addressing visceral disorders, and greatly favored non-subluxation-based clinical approaches for such conditions. The same survey showed that most chiropractors generally believed that the majority of their clinical approach for addressing musculoskeletal/biomechanical disorders such as back pain was based on subluxation.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Journal of Chiropractic Humanities|year=2008|volume=15|issue=|pages=19–26|title=Survey of US Chiropractor Attitudes and Behaviors about Subluxation|author=Smith M, Carber LA|pmid=|url=http://archive.journalchirohumanities.com/Vol%2015/JChiroprHumanit2008v15-19-26.pdf|doi= [/tpl]

===Vertebral subluxation===

Palmer hypothesized that vertebral joint misalignments, which he termed vertebral subluxations, interfered with the body's function and its inborn (innate) ability to heal itself.[tpl]cite book|author= Keating JC Jr|chapter= A brief history of the chiropractic profession|pages=23–64|title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic|edition=3rd|editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B et al. (eds.)|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2005|isbn=0-07-137534-1[/tpl] D.D. Palmer repudiated his earlier theory that vertebral subluxations caused pinched nerves in the intervertebral spaces in favor of subluxations causing altered nerve vibration, either too tense or too slack, affecting the tone (health) of the end organ. D.D. Palmer, using a vitalistic approach, imbued the term subluxation with a metaphysical and philosophical meaning. He qualified this by noting that knowledge of innate intelligence was not essential to the competent practice of chiropractic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Forgotten_Theories1995.pdf|format=PDF|title= D.D. Palmer's forgotten theories of chiropractic|author= Keating JC Jr|publisher= Association for the History of Chiropractic|year=1995|accessdate=2008-05-14[/tpl] This concept was later expanded upon by his son, B.J. Palmer, and was instrumental in providing the legal basis of differentiating chiropractic medicine from conventional medicine. In 1910, D.D. Palmer theorized that the nervous system controlled health:
Vertebral subluxation, a core concept of traditional chiropractic, remains unsubstantiated and largely untested, and a debate about whether to keep it in the chiropractic paradigm has been ongoing for decades. In general, critics of traditional subluxation-based chiropractic (including chiropractors) are skeptical of its clinical value, dogmatic beliefs and metaphysical approach. While straight chiropractic still retains the traditional vitalistic construct espoused by the founders, evidence-based chiropractic suggests that a mechanistic view will allow chiropractic care to become integrated into the wider health care community.[tpl]cite journal |author=Keating JC, Charlton KH, Grod JP, Perle SM, Sikorski D, Winterstein JF |title=Subluxation: dogma or science? |journal=Chiropr Osteopat |volume=13 |issue= |pages=17 |date=August 2005 |pmid=16092955 |pmc=1208927 |doi=10.1186/1746-1340-13-17[/tpl] This is still a continuing source of debate within the chiropractic profession as well, with some schools of chiropractic still teaching the traditional/straight subluxation-based chiropractic, while others have moved towards an evidence-based chiropractic that rejects metaphysical foundings and limits itself to primarily neuromusculoskeletal conditions.[tpl]cite journal|journal=J Chiropr Educ|year=2000|volume=14|issue=2|pages=71–7|title=A survey of the use of evidence-based health care in chiropractic college clinics|author=Rose KA, Adams A|url=http://www.journalchiroed.com/2000/JCEFall2000Rose.PDF|format=PDF [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|journal=J Man Manip Ther|year=2006|volume=14|issue=2|pages=E14–8|title=Can chiropractors and evidence-based manual therapists work together? an opinion from a veteran chiropractor|author=Homola S|url=http://jmmtonline.com/documents/HomolaV14N2E.pdf|format=PDF [/tpl]
In 2005, the chiropractic subluxation was defined by the World Health Organization as "a lesion or dysfunction in a joint or motion segment in which alignment, movement integrity and/or physiological function are altered, although contact between joint surfaces remains intact. It is essentially a functional entity, which may influence biomechanical and neural integrity." This differs from the medical definition of subluxation as a significant structural displacement, which can be seen with static imaging techniques such as X-rays.[tpl]cite journal |author= World Health Organization|year=2005|title= WHO guidelines on basic training and safety in chiropractic|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Chiro-Guidelines.pdf|format=PDF|isbn= 92-4-159371-7|accessdate=2008-02-29[/tpl] The 2008 book Trick or Treatment states "X-rays can reveal neither the subluxations nor the innate intelligence associated with chiropractic philosophy, because they do not exist." Attorney David Chapman-Smith, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Chiropractic, has stated that "Medical critics have asked how there can be a subluxation if it cannot be seen on x-ray. The answer is that the chiropractic subluxation is essentially a functional entity, not structural, and is therefore no more visible on static x-ray than a limp or headache or any other functional problem."[tpl]cite book|page=160|chapter=Principles and Goals of Chiropractic Care|title=The Chiropractic Profession: Its Education, Practice, Research and Future Directions|author=David Chapman-Smith|year=2000|publisher=NCMIC Group|isbn=1-892734-02-8[/tpl] The General Chiropractic Council, the statutory regulatory body for chiropractors in the United Kingdom, states that the chiropractic vertebral subluxation complex "is not supported by any clinical research evidence that would allow claims to be made that it is the cause of disease."[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.gcc-uk.org/files/link_file/Guidance_on_claims_made_for_the_chiropractic_VSC_18August10.pdf| format=PDF|title=Guidance on claims made for the chiropractic vertebral subluxation complex| publisher=General Chiropractic Council|accessdate=2010-09-30[/tpl]

==Scope of practice==

Chiropractors emphasize the conservative management of the neuromusculoskeletal system without the use of medicines or surgery, with special emphasis on the spine.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Chiropr Osteopat |year=2005 |volume=13 |pages=9 |title=Chiropractic as spine care: a model for the profession |author=Nelson CF, Lawrence DJ, Triano JJ et al. |doi=10.1186/1746-1340-13-9 |pmid=16000175 |url=http://chiroandosteo.com/content/13/1/9 |pmc=1185558 |issue=1[/tpl] There is a range of opinions among chiropractors: some believed that treatment should be confined to the spine, or back and neck pain; others disagreed. For example, while one 2009 survey of American chiropractors had found that 73% classified themselves as "back pain/musculoskeletal specialists", the label "back and neck pain specialists" was regarded by 47% of them as a least desirable description in a 2005 international survey.[tpl]cite journal |author=Villanueva-Russell Y |title=Caught in the crosshairs: identity and cultural authority within chiropractic |journal=Soc Sci Med |volume=72 |issue=11 |pages=1826–37 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21531061 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.03.038[/tpl] Chiropractic combines aspects from mainstream and alternative medicine, and there is no agreement about how to define the profession: although chiropractors have many attributes of primary care providers, chiropractic has more of the attributes of a medical specialty like dentistry or podiatry.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Ann Intern Med |year=2002 |volume=136 |issue=3 |pages=216–27 |title=Chiropractic: a profession at the crossroads of mainstream and alternative medicine |author=Meeker WC, Haldeman S |pmid=11827498 |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/reprint/136/3/216.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-136-3-200202050-00010[/tpl] It has been proposed that chiropractors specialize in nonsurgical spine care, instead of attempting to also treat other problems, but the more expansive view of chiropractic is still widespread.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gleberzon BJ, Cooperstein R, Perle SM |title=Can chiropractic survive its chimerical nature? |journal=J Can Chiropr Assoc |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=69–73 |year=2005 |pmid=17549192 |pmc=1840015 [/tpl] Mainstream health care and governmental organizations such as the World Health Organization consider chiropractic to be complementary and alternative medicine (CAM); and a 2008 study reported that 31% of surveyed chiropractors categorized chiropractic as CAM, 27% as integrated medicine, and 12% as mainstream medicine.[tpl]cite journal |journal=J Altern Complement Med |year=2008 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=361–8 |title=Do chiropractors identify with complementary and alternative medicine? results of a survey |doi=10.1089/acm.2007.0766 |pmid=18435599 |author=Redwood D, Hawk C, Cambron J, Vinjamury SP, Bedard J [/tpl]

Chiropractic diagnosis may involve a range of methods including skeletal imaging, observational and tactile assessments, and orthopedic and neurological evaluation. A chiropractor may also refer a patient to an appropriate specialist, or co-manage with another health care provider. Common patient management involves spinal manipulation (SM) and other manual therapies to the joints and soft tissues, rehabilitative exercises, health promotion, electrical modalities, complementary procedures, and lifestyle advice.[tpl]cite book|chapterurl=http://chiroweb.com/archives/ahcpr/chapter3.htm|chapter= Content of practice|author= Mootz RD, Shekelle PG|year=1997|title= Chiropractic in the United States: Training, Practice, and Research|pages=67–91|editor= Cherkin DC, Mootz RD (eds.)|accessdate=2008-10-10|location= Rockville, MD|publisher= Agency for Health Care Policy and Research|oclc=39856366[/tpl] AHCPR Pub No. 98-N002.

==Treatments==

Spinal manipulation, which chiropractors call "spinal adjustment" or "chiropractic adjustment", is the most common treatment used in chiropractic care. Spinal manipulation is a passive manual maneuver during which a three-joint complex is taken past the normal range of movement, but not so far as to dislocate or damage the joint. Its defining factor is a dynamic thrust, which is a sudden force that causes an audible release and attempts to increase a joint's range of motion. High-velocity, low-amplitude spinal manipulation (HVLA-SM) thrusts have physiological effects that signal neural discharge from paraspinal muscle tissues, depending on duration and amplitude of the thrust are factors of the degree in paraspinal muscle spindles activation.

There are several schools of chiropractic adjustive techniques, although most chiropractors mix techniques from several schools. The following adjustive procedures were received by more than 10% of patients of licensed U.S. chiropractors in a 2003 survey: Diversified technique (full-spine manipulation, employing various techniques), extremity adjusting, Activator technique (which uses a spring-loaded tool to deliver precise adjustments to the spine), Thompson Technique (which relies on a drop table and detailed procedural protocols), Gonstead (which emphasizes evaluating the spine along with specific adjustment that avoids rotational vectors), Cox/flexion-distraction (a gentle, low-force adjusting procedure which mixes chiropractic with osteopathic principles and utilizes specialized adjusting tables with movable parts), adjustive instrument, Sacro-Occipital Technique (which models the spine as a torsion bar), Nimmo Receptor-Tonus Technique, Applied Kinesiology (which emphasises "muscle testing" as a diagnostic tool), and cranial.[tpl]cite book|title=Technique Systems in Chiropractic|author=Cooperstein R, Gleberzon BJ|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|year=2004|isbn=0-443-07413-5|ref=TSC [/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] Medicine-assisted manipulation, such as manipulation under anesthesia, involves sedation or local anesthetic and is done by a team that includes an anesthesiologist; a 2008 systematic review did not find enough evidence to make recommendations about its use for chronic low back pain.[tpl]cite journal |author=Dagenais S, Mayer J, Wooley JR, Haldeman S |title=Evidence-informed management of chronic low back pain with medicine-assisted manipulation |journal=Spine J |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=142–9 |year=2008 |pmid=18164462 |doi=10.1016/j.spinee.2007.09.010[/tpl]

===Practice guidelines===

Reviews of research studies within the chiropractic community have been used to generate practice guidelines outlining standards that specify which chiropractic treatments are "legitimate" (i.e., supported by evidence) and conceivably reimbursable under managed care health payment systems. Evidence-based guidelines are supported by one end of an ideological continuum among chiropractors; the other end employs antiscientific reasoning and makes unsubstantiated claims.[tpl]cite web|title= Chiropractic history: a primer|author= Joseph C.

===Safety===

Chiropractic care in general is safe when employed skillfully and appropriately. Manipulation is regarded as relatively safe, but as with all therapeutic interventions, complications can arise, and it has known adverse effects, risks and contraindications. Absolute contraindications to spinal manipulative therapy are conditions that should not be manipulated; these contraindications include rheumatoid arthritis and conditions known to result in unstable joints. Relative contraindications are conditions where increased risk is acceptable in some situations and where low-force and soft-tissue techniques are treatments of choice; these contraindications include osteoporosis. Although most contraindications apply only to manipulation of the affected region, some neurological signs indicate referral to emergency medical services; these include sudden and severe headache or neck pain unlike that previously experienced.[tpl]cite journal|journal=J Can Chiropr Assoc|year=2005|volume=49|issue=3|pages=158–209|title= Chiropractic clinical practice guideline: evidence-based treatment of adult neck pain not due to whiplash|author= Anderson-Peacock E, Blouin JS, Bryans R et al.|url=http://jcca-online.org/ecms.ashx/PDF/2005/2005-3/Chiropracticclinicalpracticeguideline-evidence-basedtreatmentofadultneckpainnotduetowhiplash.pdf|format=PDF|pmid=17549134|pmc=1839918 [/tpl] • [tpl]cite journal|journal=J Can Chiropr Assoc|year=2008|volume=52|issue=1|pages=7–8|title=A Clinical Practice Guideline Update from The CCA•CFCREAB-CPG|author= Anderson-Peacock E, Bryans B, Descarreaux M et al.|url=http://jcca-online.org/ecms.ashx/PDF/2008/2008-1/ClinicalPracticeGuidelineUpdatefromTheCCACFCREABCPG.pdf|format=PDF|pmid=18327295|pmc=2258235 [/tpl]

===Ethics===

The chiropractic oath is a modern variation of the classical Hippocratic Oath historically taken by physicians and other healthcare professionals swearing to practice their professions ethically.[tpl]cite pmid |21048880[/tpl] The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) has an ethical code "based upon the acknowledgement that the social contract dictates the profession’s responsibilities to the patient, the public, and the profession; and upholds the fundamental principle that the paramount purpose of the chiropractic doctor's professional services shall be to benefit the patient."[tpl]Cite web|author=Staff|title=Code of Ethics|publisher=American Chiropractic Association|url=http://www.acatoday.org/content_css.cfm?CID=719[/tpl] The International Chiropractor's Association (ICA) also has a set of professional canons.[tpl]Cite web|author=Staff|title=ICA code of Ethics|publisher=International Chiropractor's Association|url=http://www.chiropractic.org/ica/ethics.htm[/tpl]
A study of California disciplinary statistics during 1997–2000 reported 4.5 disciplinary actions per 1000 chiropractors per year, compared to 2.27 for medical doctors, and the incident rate for fraud was nine times greater among chiropractors (1.99 per 1000 chiropractors per year) than among medical doctors (0.20).[tpl]cite journal |author=Foreman SM, Stahl MJ |title=Chiropractors disciplined by a state chiropractic board and a comparison with disciplined medical physicians |journal=J Manipulative Physiol Ther |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=472–7 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15389179 |doi=10.1016/j.jmpt.2004.06.006[/tpl] According to a 2006 Gallup poll of U.S. adults, when asked how they would "rate the honesty and ethical standards of people in these different fields", chiropractic compared unfavorably with mainstream medicine. When chiropractic was rated, it "rated dead last amongst healthcare professions". While 84% of respondents considered nurses' ethics "very high" or "high," only 36% felt that way about chiropractors. Other healthcare professions ranged from 38% for psychiatrists, to 62% for dentists, 69% for medical doctors, 71% for veterinarians, and 73% for druggists or pharmacists.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Dynamic Chiropractic |volume=25 |issue=3 |date=29 January 2007 |title=Gallup Poll: Americans have low opinion of chiropractors' honesty and ethics |url=http://dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=52038[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=USA TODAY/Gallup poll |url=http://usatoday.com/news/polls/tables/live/2006-12-11-ethics.htm |work=USA Today |date=11 December 2006[/tpl]Gallup chart Similar results were found in the 2003 Gallup Poll."Public Rates Nursing as Most Honest and Ethical Profession."

Sustained chiropractic care is promoted as a preventative tool, but unnecessary manipulation could possibly present a risk to patients. Some chiropractors are concerned by the routine unjustified claims chiropractors have made. A 2010 analysis of chiropractic websites found the majority of chiropractors and their associations made claims of effectiveness not supported by scientific evidence, while 28% of chiropractor websites advocate lower back pain care, which has some sound evidence.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=20389316|year=2010|last1=Ernst|first1=E|last2=Gilbey|first2=A|title=Chiropractic claims in the English-speaking world|volume=123|issue=1312|pages=36–44 |journal=The New Zealand medical journal[/tpl]

The majority of U.S. chiropractors partake in some form of managed care. Although the majority of U.S. chiropractors view themselves as specialists in neuroleptic malignant syndrome conditions, many also consider chiropractic as a type of primary care. In the majority of cases, the care that chiropractors and physicians provide divides the market, however for some, their care is complementary.

==History==

Chiropractic was founded in 1895 by Daniel David (D.D.) Palmer in Davenport, Iowa. Palmer, a magnetic healer, hypothesized that manual manipulation of the spine could cure disease. The first chiropractic patient of D.D. Palmer was Harvey Lillard, a worker in the building where Palmer's office was located. He claimed that he had severely reduced hearing for 17 years, which started soon following a "pop" in his spine. A few days following his adjustment, Lillard claimed his hearing was almost completely restored. Chiropractic competed with its predecessor osteopathy, another medical system based on magnetic healing and bonesetting; both systems were founded by charismatic midwesterners in opposition to the conventional medicine of the day, and both postulated that manipulation improved health.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Med Anthropol Q |year=1987 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=176–93 |title=Divergence and convergence in two systems of manual medicine: osteopathy and chiropractic in the United States |author=Baer HA |doi=10.1525/maq.1987.1.2.02a00030 [/tpl] Although initially keeping chiropractic a family secret, in 1898 Palmer began teaching it to a few students at his new Palmer School of Chiropractic. One student, his son Bartlett Joshua (B.J.) Palmer, became committed to promoting chiropractic, took over the Palmer School in 1906, and rapidly expanded its enrollment.[tpl]cite journal |author=Martin SC |title=Chiropractic and the social context of medical technology, 1895-1925 |journal=Technol Cult |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=808–34 |date=October 1993 |pmid=11623404 |jstor=3106416 |doi=10.2307/3106416[/tpl]
Early chiropractors believed that all disease was caused by interruptions in the flow of innate intelligence, a vitalistic nervous energy or life force that represented God's presence in man; chiropractic leaders often invoked religious imagery and moral traditions. D.D. and B.J. both seriously considered declaring chiropractic a religion, which might have provided legal protection under the U.S. constitution, but decided against it partly to avoid confusion with Christian Science.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Religion-of-Chiro.pdf|format=PDF|author= Palmer DD|title= D.D. Palmer's Religion of Chiropractic: Letter to P.W. Johnson, D.C|date=1911-05-04|accessdate=2008-06-29[/tpl] Early chiropractors also tapped into the Populist movement, emphasizing craft, hard work, competition, and advertisement, aligning themselves with the common man against intellectuals and trusts, among which they included the American Medical Association (AMA).
Chiropractic has seen considerable controversy and criticism.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Clin Orthop Relat Res |year=2006 |volume=444 |pages=236–42 |title=Chiropractic: history and overview of theories and methods |author=Homola S |doi=10.1097/01.blo.0000200258.95865.87 |pmid=16446588 [/tpl] Although D.D. and B.J. were "straight" and disdained the use of instruments, some early chiropractors, whom B.J. scornfully called "mixers", advocated the use of instruments. In 1910 B.J. changed course and endorsed X-rays as necessary for diagnosis; this resulted in a significant exodus from the Palmer School of the more conservative faculty and students. The mixer camp grew until by 1924 B.J. estimated that only 3,000 of the U.S.'s 25,000 chiropractors remained straight. That year, B.J.'s invention and promotion of the neurocalometer, a temperature-sensing device, was highly controversial among B.J.'s fellow straights. By the 1930s chiropractic was the largest alternative healing profession in the U.S.
Chiropractors faced heavy opposition from organized medicine. Thousands of chiropractors were prosecuted for practicing medicine without a license, and D.D. and many other chiropractors were jailed. To defend against medical statutes B.J. argued that chiropractic was separate and distinct from medicine, asserting that chiropractors "analyzed" rather than "diagnosed", and "adjusted" subluxations rather than "treated" disease. B.J. cofounded the Universal Chiropractors' Association (UCA) to provide legal services to arrested chiropractors. Although the UCA won their first test case in Wisconsin in 1907, prosecutions instigated by state medical boards became increasingly common and in many cases were successful. In response, chiropractors conducted political campaigns to secure separate licensing statutes, eventually succeeding in all fifty states, from Kansas in 1913 through Louisiana in 1974. The longstanding feud between chiropractors and medical doctors continued for decades. The AMA labeled chiropractic an "unscientific cult" in 1966,[tpl]cite journal |author=Johnson C, Baird R, Dougherty PE, et al. |title=Chiropractic and public health: current state and future vision |journal=J Manipulative Physiol Ther |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=397–410 |year=2008 |pmid=18722194 |doi=10.1016/j.jmpt.2008.07.001[/tpl] and until 1980 advised its members that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate with "unscientific practitioners".[tpl]cite journal |author=Cherkin D |title=AMA policy on chiropractic |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=79 |issue=11 |pages=1569–70 |date=November 1989 |pmid=2817179 |pmc=1349822 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.79.11.1569-a[/tpl] This culminated in a landmark 1987 decision, Wilk v. AMA, in which the court found that the AMA had engaged in unreasonable restraint of trade and conspiracy, and which ended the AMA's de facto boycott of chiropractic.
Serious research to test chiropractic theories did not begin until the 1970s, and is continuing to be hampered by antiscientific and pseudoscientific ideas that sustained the profession in its long battle with organized medicine. By the mid 1990s there was a growing scholarly interest in chiropractic, which helped efforts to improve service quality and establish clinical guidelines that recommended manual therapies for acute low back pain.[tpl]cite web |title= Chiropractic history: a primer |author= Keating JC Jr, Cleveland CS III, Menke M |url=http://ahc.memberclicks.net/assets/documents/ChiroHistoryPrimer.pdf |format=PDF |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-06-16 |publisher= Association for the History of Chiropractic[/tpl] In recent decades chiropractic gained legitimacy and greater acceptance by medical physicians and health plans, and enjoyed a strong political base and sustained demand for services. However, its future seemed uncertain: as the number of practitioners grew, evidence-based medicine insisted on treatments with demonstrated value, managed care restricted payment, and competition grew from massage therapists and other health professions. The profession responded by marketing natural products and devices more aggressively, and by reaching deeper into alternative medicine and primary care.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cooper RA, McKee HJ |title=Chiropractic in the United States: trends and issues |journal=Milbank Q |volume=81 |issue=1 |pages=107–38, table of contents |year=2003 |pmid=12669653 |pmc=2690192 |doi=10.1111/1468-0009.00040[/tpl]

==Public health==

Some chiropractors oppose vaccination and water fluoridation, which are common public health practices. Within the chiropractic community there are significant disagreements about vaccination, one of the most cost-effective public health interventions available.[tpl]cite journal|author= Ehreth J|title= The global value of vaccination|journal=Vaccine|volume=21|issue=7–8|pages=596–600|year=2003|pmid=12531324|doi=10.1016/S0264-410X(02)00623-0[/tpl] Most chiropractic writings on vaccination focus on its negative aspects, claiming that it is hazardous, ineffective, and unnecessary. Some chiropractors have embraced vaccination, but a significant portion of the profession rejects it, as original chiropractic philosophy traces diseases to causes in the spine and states that vaccines interfere with healing. The extent to which anti-vaccination views perpetuate the current chiropractic profession is uncertain. The American Chiropractic Association and the International Chiropractors Association support individual exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws, and a 1995 survey of U.S. chiropractors found that about a third believed there was no scientific proof that immunization prevents disease.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Pediatrics|year=2000|volume=105|issue=4|pages=e43|title= Chiropractors and vaccination: a historical perspective|author= Campbell JB, Busse JW, Injeyan HS|pmid=10742364|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/105/4/e43|doi= 10.1542/peds.105.4.e43[/tpl] The Canadian Chiropractic Association supports vaccination;[tpl]cite journal|journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther|year=2005|volume=28|issue=5|pages=367–73|title= Chiropractic antivaccination arguments|author= Busse JW, Morgan L, Campbell JB|doi=10.1016/j.jmpt.2005.04.011|pmid=15965414|url= http://jmptonline.org/article/S0161-4754(05)00111-9/fulltext[/tpl] a survey in Alberta in 2002 found that 25% of chiropractors advised patients for, and 27% against, vaccinating themselves or their children.[tpl]cite journal|author= Russell ML, Injeyan HS, Verhoef MJ, Eliasziw M|title= Beliefs and behaviours: understanding chiropractors and immunization|journal=Vaccine|volume=23|issue=3|pages=372–9|year=2004|pmid=15530683|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2004.05.027[/tpl]
Early opposition to water fluoridation included chiropractors, some of whom continue to oppose it as being incompatible with chiropractic philosophy and an infringement of personal freedom. Other chiropractors have actively promoted fluoridation, and several chiropractic organizations have endorsed scientific principles of public health.[tpl]cite journal|journal= Am J Public Health|year=1989|volume=79|issue=10|pages=1405–8|title= Fluoridation referendum in La Crosse, Wisconsin: contributing factors to success|author= Jones RB, Mormann DN, Durtsche TB|pmid=2782512|pmc=1350185|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/79/10/1405.pdf|format=PDF|doi= 10.2105/AJPH.79.10.1405[/tpl] In addition to traditional chiropractic opposition to water fluoridation and vaccination, chiropractors' attempts to establish a positive reputation for their public health role are also compromised by their reputation for recommending repetitive lifelong chiropractic treatment.

==Controversy==

Palmer, the founder of chiropractic, subluxation is the sole cause of disease and manipulation is the cure for all diseases of the human race.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=18280103|date=May 2008|last1=Ernst|first1=E|title=Chiropractic: a critical evaluation|volume=35|issue=5|pages=544–62|issn=0885-3924|doi=10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2007.07.004|journal=Journal of pain and symptom management[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author= Palmer DD|title= The Chiropractor's Adjuster: Text-book of the Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic for Students and Practitioners|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/45233534/s-Adjuster-1910|location=Portland, OR|publisher= Portland Printing House Co|year=1910|oclc=17205743|quote=A subluxated vertebra ... is the cause of 95 percent of all diseases ... The other five percent is caused by displaced joints other than those of the vertebral column.[/tpl] A critical evaluation stated "Chiropractic is rooted in mystical concepts. This led to an internal conflict within the chiropractic profession, which continues today." Chiropractors, including D.D. Palmer, were jailed for practicing medicine without a license. For most of its existence, chiropractic has battled with mainstream medicine, sustained by antiscientific and pseudoscientific ideas such as subluxation.[tpl]cite web|title= Chiropractic history: a primer|author= Joseph C.

Chiropractic has been controversial, though to a lesser extent than in past years.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Clin Orthop Relat Res|year=2006|volume=444|pages=243–9|title=History and overview of theories and methods of chiropractic: a counterpoint|author=DeVocht JW|doi=10.1097/01.blo.0000203460.89887.8d|pmid=16523145 [/tpl]
