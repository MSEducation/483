[[Tanichthys]]

CATEGORIES: Cyprinidae, Fish of Asia

Tanichthys is a genus of freshwater fish in the carp family (family Cyprinidae) of order Cypriniformes. They are native to rivers and streams in China and Vietnam. Until recently, the type species, T. albonubes, was the only one known.  In 2001, however, Freyhof and Herder described a new and very similar species, T. micagemmae,  from the Ben Hai River in Vietnam and V. H. Nguyen & S. V. Ng√¥ described a third species from Vietnam.
The name Tanichthys comes from the name of the Chinese Boy Scout leader, Tan, who discovered the first specimen.
