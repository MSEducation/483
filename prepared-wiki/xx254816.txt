Mellow Touch 94.7 is one of the provincial station of FBS Radio Network. It is located in Jocar Complex, Guerrero St., Ma-a, Davao City.
The station closed in late 2006 due to poor management that led to bankruptcy. In June 2007, was re-opened under new management of J-TvR Tri-Media Services. It only managed DXLL for only a year due to conflict with lease contract. FBS took back the station and re-leased it to JKZ Adz Services on June 2008. In January 2010, FBS Radio Network took over the management of DXLL up to the present.
The station maintained the format of easy listen music and added new programs that help and entertain listeners in a new way. Today DXLL Mellow Touch 94.7 is slowly catching the ears of the listeners of Davao City and its neighboring cites and its gaining more and more listeners.
