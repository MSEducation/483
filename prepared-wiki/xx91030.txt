In particle physics, a Higgsino, symbol [tpl]Unicode|[tpl]SubatomicParticle|Higgsino[/tpl][/tpl], is the hypothetical superpartner of the Higgs boson, as predicted by supersymmetry.  The Higgsino is a Dirac fermion and that is a weak isodoublet with hypercharge half under the Standard Model gauge symmetries.  After electroweak symmetry breaking the Higgsino becomes a pair of neutral Majorana fermions called neutralinos and a charged Dirac fermion called a chargino (plus and minus). These states finally mix with the neutralinos (photino and zino) and chargino (charged wino plus and minus)resulting from electroweak symmetry breaking of the bino and wino 0, 1, 2 to form the predicted particles which are four neutralinos and two charginos (plus and minus each). Such a linear combination of the Higgsino, bino and wino makes up the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), which is a particle physics candidate for the dark matter of the universe.  In order to be such a candidate, it must be neutral (i.e. a neutralino rather than chargino).
In natural scenarios of SUSY, top squarks, bottom squarks, gluinos, and higgsino-enriched neutralinos and charginos are expected to be relatively light, enhancing their production cross sections. Higgsino searches have been performed by both the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, where physicists have searched for the direct electroweak pair production of Higgsinos. As of March 2014, no experimental evidence for Higginos has been reported.[tpl]cite web|url=https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasPublic/SupersymmetryPublicResults|title=ATLAS Supersymmetry Public Results| publisher=ATLAS, CERN |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/PhysicsResultsSUS|title=CMS Supersymmetry Public Results| publisher=CMS, CERN |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl]

==Higgsino Mass==

If Dark matter is composed only of Higgsinos then the Higgsino mass is 1.1 TeV. On other hand if dark matter has multi-components then the Higgsino mass, depends on the relevant multiverse distribution functions making the mass of the Higgsino lighter.
