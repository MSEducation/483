[[Criticism of Microsoft]]

CATEGORIES: Criticisms of companies, Microsoft criticisms and controversies, Criticisms of software and websites

Criticism of Microsoft has followed various aspects of its products and business practices. Issues with ease of use, robustness, and security of the company's software are common targets for critics. In the 2000s, a number of malware mishaps have targeted security flaws in Microsoft Windows and other programs. Microsoft is also accused of locking vendors and consumers into their products, and of not following and complying with existing standards in its software.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ecis.eu/documents/Finalversion_Consumerchoicepaper.pdf |title=Microsoft A History of Anticompetitive Behavior and Consumer Harm |accessdate=2009-05-25 |date=2009-03-31 |format=PDF |publisher=European Committee for Interoperable Systems [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/25/writing_history_with_microsofts_office/|title=Writing history with Microsoft's Office lock-in[/tpl] Total cost of ownership comparisons of Linux as well as Mac OS X to Windows are a continuous point of debate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cioupdate.com/article.php/10493_1477911 |title=Linux TCO: Less Than Half The Cost of Windows |accessdate=2009-05-29 |last=Orzech |first=Dan |date=2009-04-29 |work=CIO Updates [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link |date=January 2014[/tpl]
The company has been the subject of numerous lawsuits by several governments and other companies for unlawful monopolistic practices. In 2004, the European Union found Microsoft guilty in the European Union Microsoft competition case. Additionally, EULAs for Microsoft programs are often criticized as being too restrictive.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/columnists/420|accessdate=2009-07-16|first=Scott|last=Granneman|title=Surprises Inside Microsoft Vista's EULA[/tpl]

==Vendor lock-in==

From its inception, Microsoft defined itself as a platform company and understood the importance of attracting third-party programmers. It did so by providing development tools, training, access to proprietary APIs in early versions, and partner programs. Although the resulting ubiquity of Microsoft software allows a user to benefit from network effects, critics decry what they consider to be an "embrace, extend and extinguish" strategy by Microsoft of adding proprietary features to open standards, thereby using its market dominance to gain unofficial ownership of standards "extended" in this way.
Microsoft software is also presented as a "safe" choice for IT managers purchasing software systems. In an internal memo for senior management Microsoft's head of C++ development, Aaron Contorer, stated:[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1016-5197411.html|title=EU report takes Microsoft to task|accessdate=2006-06-06|archiveurl=http://archive.is/JPPH|archivedate=2012-07-11[/tpl]
More recently, Microsoft had their OOXML specification approved by the ISO standards body in a manner consistent with previous attempts to control standards.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20071023002351958 |title=How to Get Your Platform Accepted as a Standard - Microsoft Style |author=Pamela Jones |publisher=Groklaw News |date=2008-02-17 | accessdate=2010-03-30[/tpl]

==Copyright enforcement==

When Microsoft discovered that its first product, Altair BASIC, was subject to widespread illegal copying, Microsoft founder Bill Gates wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists that openly accused many hobbyists of stealing software. Gates' letter provoked many responses, with some hobbyists objecting to the broad accusation, and others supporting the principle of compensation.
This disagreement over whether software should be proprietary continues into the present day under the banner of the free software movement, with Microsoft characterizing free software released under the terms of the GPL as being "potentially viral"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/25/open_source_terror_stalks_microsofts/|title=Open source terror stalks Microsoft's lawyers[/tpl] and the GNU General Public License itself as a "viral license" which "infects" proprietary software and forces its developer to have to release proprietary source to the public.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/34292.html|title=The EULA, the GPL and the Wisdom of Fortune Cookies[/tpl]
The Halloween documents, internal Microsoft memos which were leaked to the open source community beginning in 1998, indicate that some Microsoft employees perceive "open source" software — in particular, Linux — as a growing long-term threat to Microsoft's position in the software industry. The Halloween documents acknowledged that parts of Linux are superior to the versions of Microsoft Windows available at the time, and outlined a strategy of "de-commoditizeing protocols & applications."Halloween Document 8
Microsoft stated in its 2006 Annual Report that it was a defendant in at least 35 patent infringement lawsuits.MSFT Annual Report 2006 The company's litigation expenses for April 2004 through March 2007 exceed $4.3 billion: over $4 billion in payouts, plus $300 million in legal fees.[tpl]cite news | first= | last= | title=Patent Payouts | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/patent-tax.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-05-19 | language = [/tpl]
Another concern of critics is that Microsoft may be using the distribution of shared source software to harvest names of developers who have been exposed to Microsoft code, as some believe that these developers could someday be the target of lawsuits if they were ever to participate in the development of competing products. This issue is addressed in published papers from several organizations including the American Bar Association and the Open Source Initiative.[tpl]cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.abanet.org/intelprop/spring2004/course_materials/02_webbink.pdf|title=Open Source Software - A Legal Framework |accessdate=2009-06-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opensource.org/advocacy/shared_source.php|title=Shared Source: A Dangerous Virus[/tpl]
Starting in the 1990s, Microsoft was accused of maintaining "hidden" or "secret" APIs: interfaces to its operating system software that it deliberately keeps undocumented to gain a competitive advantage in its application software products.[ref]
 (public comment on US v. Microsoft under the Tunney Act)[/ref]
Microsoft employees have consistently denied this;
they claim that application developers inside and outside Microsoft routinely reverse-engineered DOS and 16-bit versions of Windows without any inside help, creating legacy support problems that far exceeded any alleged benefit to Microsoft.[tpl]cite web|first=Raymond|last=Chen|title=What about BOZOSLIVEHERE and TABTHETEXTOUTFORWIMPS?|work=The Old New Thing|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/10/15/55296.aspx|accessdate=2007-09-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|first=Joel|last=Spolsky|title=How Microsoft Lost the API War|url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html[/tpl]
In response to court orders, Microsoft has published interfaces between components of its operating system software, including components like Internet Explorer, Active Directory, and Windows Media that sell as part of Windows but compete with application software.

==Licensing agreements==

A common complaint[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.bestpricecomputers.ltd.uk/products/nowindows.htm |title=Buying without Windows-Don't want Windows? |publisher=Best Price Computers Ltd |date=February 2007[/tpl] comes from those who want to purchase a computer without a copy of Windows pre-installed and without paying extra for the license either so that another operating system can be used or because a license was already acquired elsewhere, such as through the MSDN Academic Alliance program.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.racketware.info/msdnaa/call-on-students|title=Call on students | date=September 27, 2009[/tpl]  Microsoft encourages original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to supply computers with Windows pre-installed[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/11/28/ms_its_nearly_illegal/|title=MS: it's (nearly) illegal to buy PCs without Windows | date= November 28, 2000[/tpl] by presenting their dominance in computer sales[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2001/10/23/13219/110 |title=Microsoft's Dirty OEM-Secret | date=October 23, 2001[/tpl] and arguing that consumers benefit by not having to install an operating system. Because the price of the license varies depending on discounts given to the OEM and because there is no similar computer that the OEM offers without Windows, there is no immediate way to find the size of the refund.  In 2009, Microsoft stated that it has always charged OEMs about $50 for a Windows license on a $1,000 computer.[tpl]cite web|last=Protalinski|first=Emil|title=OEMs pay Microsoft about $50 for each copy of Windows|url=http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2009/09/microsoft-oems-pay-about-50-for-each-copy-of-windows/|work=Ars Technica|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=28 December 2012|date=2009-09-16[/tpl]

Microsoft: Court's Findings of Fact[/tpl]   Microsoft also once assessed license fees based on the number of computers an OEM sold, regardless of whether a Windows license was included; Microsoft was forced to end this practice due to a consent decree. In 2010, Microsoft stated that its agreements with OEMs to distribute Windows are nonexclusive, and OEMs are free to distribute computers with a different operating system or without any operating system.[tpl]cite web|last=Protalinski|first=Emil|title=Italian class-action suit targets unwanted Windows installs|url=http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2010/01/italian-class-action-suit-targets-unwanted-windows-installs/|work=Ars Technica|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=28 December 2012|date=2010-01-07|quote='However, consumers benefit from the preinstallation of Windows on PCs.

'It's also important to note that Microsoft's agreements with OEMs are nonexclusive.'[/tpl]
Microsoft does not provide refunds for Windows licenses sold through an OEM, including licenses that come with the purchase of a computer or are pre-installed on a computer.[tpl]cite web|title=Microsoft North American Retail Product Refund Guidelines|url=http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/productrefund/refund.mspx|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=27 August 2012[/tpl]
According to Microsoft's End User License Agreement for Windows 7 the ability to receive a refund for the operating system is determined by the hardware manufacturer:[tpl]Cite web|url=http://download.microsoft.com/Documents/UseTerms/Windows%207_Professional_English_b7a7153f-1a6c-498c-9350-c86926bb1aa9.pdf |title=Microsoft Software License Terms: Windows 7 Professional[/tpl][tpl]quote|By using the software, you accept these terms.

==Acquisitions==

Microsoft has acquired several companies and products during its history, including some that competed with earlier Microsoft products.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/msft/acquisitions/history.mspx|title=Microsoft's list of companies it has acquired[/tpl] Such acquired assets include DOS (Seattle Computer Products QDOS), FrontPage (Vermeer Technologies Incorporated FrontPage), WebTV (now MSN TV), Hotmail, Direct3D, Internet Explorer (Spyglass, Inc. Mosaic), Visio (Visio Corporation Visio), Windows Virtual PC (Connectix Virtual PC), and Windows Defender (GIANT Company Software, Inc. GIANT AntiSpyware). Microsoft rebrands the primary products of the companies it acquires, and in many cases offers them for free or bundles them with their operating system. Former Sun Microsystems chief executive Scott McNealy occasionally remarked that Microsoft never produced technology except by buying it: "R&D and development and M&A and acquisitions are the same thing over there."

==Litigation==

Microsoft's market dominance and business practices have attracted widespread resentment, which is not necessarily restricted to the company's competitors. In a 2003 publication, Dan Geer argued the prevalence of Microsoft products has resulted in a monoculture which is dangerously easy for viruses to exploit.[tpl]cite web|title=CyberInsecurity: The Cost of Monopoly|url=http://www.ccianet.org/papers/cyberinsecurity.pdf|archiveurl=http://cryptome.org/cyberinsecurity.htm|archivedate=unknown[/tpl]

==Labor practices==

While Microsoft's permanent workers enjoy some of the best corporate treatment, a large part of Microsoft's labor pool exists outside this privileged class.  This includes the use of permatemp employees (employees employed for years as "temporary," and therefore without medical benefits), use of forced retention tactics, where departing employees would be sued to prevent departure, as well as more traditional cost-saving measures, ranging from cutting medical benefits, to not providing towels in company locker rooms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_39/b3952001.htm|title=Troubling Exits At Microsoft[/tpl]
Historically, Microsoft has also been accused of overworking employees, in many cases, leading to burnout within just a few years of joining the company. The company is often referred to as a "Velvet Sweatshop", a term which originated in a 1989 Seattle Times article,[tpl]cite news | last=Andrews | first=Paul | title=A 'Velvet Sweatshop' or a High-Tech Heaven? | date=23 April 1989 | publisher=The Seattle Times | url=http://www.krsaborio.net/research/1980s/89/890423.htm[/tpl] and later became used to describe the company by some of Microsoft's own employees.[tpl]cite web | title=Editor's note, MSJ August 1997 | url=http://www.microsoft.com/msj/0897/ednote0897.aspx | accessdate=September 27, 2005 [/tpl] This characterization is derived from the perception that Microsoft provides nearly everything for its employees in a convenient place, but in turn overworks them to a point where it would be bad for their (possibly long-term) health. For example, the kitchenettes have free beverages and many buildings include exercise rooms and showers. However, the company has been accused of attempting to keep employees at the company for unreasonably long hours and working them too much. This is detailed in several books about Microsoft, including Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire.
A US state lawsuit was brought against Microsoft in 1992 representing 8,558 current and former employees that had been classified as "temporary" and "freelance", and became known as Vizcaino v. Microsoft. In 1993, the suit became a US Federal Class Action in the United States District Court Western District Of Washington At Seattle as No. C93-178C. The Final Settlement came in 2005. The case was decided on the (IRS-defined) basis that such "permatemps" had their jobs defined by Microsoft, worked alongside regular employees doing the same work, and worked for long terms. After a series of court setbacks including three reversals on appeal, Microsoft settled the suit for US $93 million.
A side effect of the "permatemp" lawsuit is that now contract employees are prevented from participating in team morale events and other activities that could be construed as making them "employees". They are also limited to one-year contracts and must leave after that time for 100 days before returning under contract.

==Advertising and public relations==

Critics have alleged that Microsoft has used funding to drum up support from think tanks and trade organizations such as the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution (AdTI), the Independent Institute, and Americans for Technology Leadership (ATL). During the antitrust case United States v. Microsoft, ATL sent a poll to 19 state attorneys general purporting to show that "the public believes state AGs should devote their energy to causes other than Microsoft".[tpl]cite web|last=Carney|first=Dan|url=http://www.businessweek.com/2000/00_20/b3681219.htm|title=Microsoft's All-Out Counterattack|publisher=Business Week|date=15 May 2000|accessdate=8 November 2012[/tpl] Also during the case the Independent Institute ran full-page advertisements in the New York Times and the Washington Post defending Microsoft, which was later revealed to have funded the ad campaign.[tpl]cite news|last=Brinkley|first=Joel|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/18/business/microsoft-covered-cost-of-ads-backing-it-in-antitrust-suit.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=Microsoft Covered Cost of Ads Backing It in Antitrust Suit|date=18 September 1999|accessdate=8 November 2012|work=The New York Times[/tpl] The institute published Winners, Losers, and Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology shortly thereafter.[tpl]cite book |title=Winners, Losers, and Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology |first1=Stan J. |last1=Liebowitz |first2=Stephen E. |last2=Margolis |publisher=Independent Institute |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-94599-980-5 |pages=344 |url=http://www.independent.org/store/book.asp?id=50[/tpl]

Microsoft has countered that it funds many think tanks besides the AdTI, such as the American Enterprise Institute, the Cato Institute, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the Heritage Foundation and that it does not fund any specific research.
In August 2004, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) of the United Kingdom ordered Microsoft to stop a run of print ads that claimed that the total cost of ownership of Linux servers was ten times that of Windows Server 2003. The comparison included the cost of hardware, and put Linux at a disadvantage by installing it on more expensive but poorer-performing hardware compared to that used for Windows.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/non_broadcast/Adjudication+Details.htm?adjudication_id=38475|title=Non-broadcast Adjudication|accessdate=2006-03-31|publisher=Advertising Standards Authority[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Kuchinskas|first=Susan|url=http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3400131|title=Microsoft Ordered to Pull Anti-Linux Ad|accessdate=2006-03-31|publisher=IT Business Edge|date=26 August 2004[/tpl]
On January 24, 2007, Rick Jelliffe made claim on his blog that a Microsoft employee offered to pay him to make corrections in Wikipedia articles concerning Office Open XML.

In 2011, Moneylife.in alleged that two "anonymous comments boosting their product"—one by a Nokia employee and another by a Microsoft employee—were posted on their review of Nokia Lumia 800, which was based only on the "technical specifications" and the reviewer "hadn't laid a finger on the phone".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/dec/19/nokia-microsoft-lumia-comments|title=Nokia and Microsoft fingered over comments on adverse Lumia review|publisher=The Guardian|date=2011-10-18|accessdate=2012-01-14|location=London|first=Charles|last=Arthur[/tpl] In conclusion, Charles Arthur argued "Nobody has come out of the episode looking good.

In 2014 details on a partnership between Machinima.com and Microsoft came to light regarding a marketing campaign for Xbox One. Machinima would offer some of its user's $3 per million views if the user showed 30 seconds of an Xbox One game and mentioned the system by name.[tpl]cite news|url=http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/stealth-marketing-microsoft-paying-youtubers-for-xbox-one-mentions/|title=Stealth marketing: Microsoft paying YouTubers for Xbox One mentions|publisher=arstechnicha|date=Jan 20, 2014|accessdate=Jan 21, 2014|first=Kyle|last=Orland[/tpl] Controversy arose when legal documents leaked detailing that participants were not allowed to disclose that they were being paid for said endorsements. Ars Technica, brought up the fact that this goes against FTC regulations which requires recipients to fully disclose when such actions occur. Problematically, they also require the reviewer not to disclose that they're getting paid (or mention anything negative), which breaks the FTC disclosure rules.

==Gay reference controversy==

Microsoft has come under some criticism for its attitude to homosexuality and Xbox Live. Users may not use the string "gay" in a gamertag (even in a non-homosexual context, for example as part of a surname), or refer to homosexuality in their profile (including self-identifying as such), as the company considers this "content of a sexual nature" or "offensive" to other users and therefore unsuitable for the service.Kotaku - "theGAYERGamer" Gets Xbox Live Ban, Microsoft Explains - Xbox LiveKotaku - Microsoft Explains "Gaywood" Ban - ControversyConsumerist - Identifying Yourself As A Lesbian Gets You Banned On XBOX Live - Gay  After banning 'Teresa', a lesbian gamer who had been harassed by other users for being a homosexual, this policy gained wide condemnation.
A senior Xbox Live team member, Stephen Toulouse, has clarified the policy, stating that "Expression of any sexual orientation ... is not allowed in gamertags" but that they are "examining how we can provide it in a way that won't get misused".Kotaku - Microsoft Looking To Change Xbox Live Sexual "Discrimination" - Xbox 360"Xbox LIVE policy and Gamertags/Profiles Redux"  GLAAD weighed in on the controversy as well, supporting the steps that Microsoft has taken over the years to engage the LGBT community."XBox Live, Homophobia, and Online Gaming Policy"

==Website concerns==

Polish users of Microsoft's Business Productivity Infrastructure website[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/businessproductivity/default.mspx |title=Microsoft: Optimize Your Business Productivity Infrastructure, English version |accessdate=2009-08-25 |work=Website |publisher=Microsoft Corporation  [/tpl] have noticed a white model's face has been photoshopped over the head of the African American model at center in the photograph on the main page of the Polish language version of the website.  The website Photoshop Disasters covered the story on 25 August 2009.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.psdisasters.com/2009/08/microsoft-poland-at-least-they-left.html |title=Photoshop Disasters: "Microsoft Poland: At Least They Left The Asian Guy In" |accessdate=2009-08-26 |work=Website |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |date=2009-08-25  [/tpl]
As of 1:00 A.M. GMT on 25 August, this has been changed and the image on the Polish website now reflects the image on the English website.  Microsoft later issued an apology regarding the incident.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.ciol.com/Global-News/News-Reports/Microsoft-apologizes-for-web-photo-racism/26809124128/0/ |title=Microsoft apologizes for web photo racism |accessdate=2009-08-26 |work=Website |publisher=CIOL News |date=2009-08-26[/tpl]  Spokesman Lou Gellos stated that Microsoft was "looking into the details of this situation."  The apology was later restated on Microsoft's official Twitter page:[tpl]cite web|url=http://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/3546312485 |title=The Official Microsoft Twitter[/tpl] "Marketing site photo mistake - sincere apologies - we're in the process of taking down the image."

==Outlook email service==

As of May 23, 2013, Microsoft's free email service Outlook, which has replaced the previous format Hotmail for all users, has been reported to be mostly dysfunctional in several discussion threads on answers.microsoft.com [tpl]cite web |url=http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive |title=Microsoft Community: Microsoft account, Outlook.com, SkyDrive |accessdate=2013-05-23 |work=Website |publisher=Microsoft Corporation  [/tpl] with several hundred individual complaints. For uniformly all users posting about the issue, login to their Outlook account and even access of the inbox is possible, and issues depending on browser, operating system or hardware have been excluded as the cause, but access to emails has been very limited and the message "We can't connect to Outlook at the moment. Please try again later" has been displayed. While the begin of the problem has been stated as varying from early May to immediately after the forced switch from Hotmail to Outlook, the occurrence has been reported to increase up to instances of "rarely accessible", depending on server.[tpl]cite web |url=http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-email/we-cant-connect-to-outlook-at-the-moment-please/aaffb383-12ee-4959-9624-0a728cbefdd9 |title=We can't connect to Outlook at the moment. Please try again later. |accessdate=2013-05-23 |work=Website |publisher=Microsoft Corporation  [/tpl] Microsoft has been widely criticized for failing to issue a statement as well as for the switch in general, while Microsoft Answers moderators have been criticized for recommending non-problem-related measures only.
