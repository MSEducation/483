The cd command, also known as chdir (change directory), is a command-line OS shell command used to change the current working directory in operating systems such as Unix, DOS, OS/2, AmigaOS (where if a bare path is given, cd is implied), Windows, and Linux. It is also available for use in shell scripts and batch files. The system call that effects the command in most operating systems is chdir(2) that is defined by POSIX.

==Usage==

A directory is a logical section of a file system used to hold files. Directories may also contain other directories. The cd command can be used to change into a subdirectory, move back into the parent directory, move all the way back to the root directory or move to any given directory.
Consider the following subsection of a Unix filesystem, which shows a user's home directory (represented as “~”) with a file (“text.txt”) and three subdirectories.
 
If the user's current working directory is the home directory (“~”), then entering the command ls followed by cd games might produce the following transcript:
The user is now in the “games” directory.
A similar session in DOS (though the concept of a “home directory” may not apply, depending on the specific version[tpl]Vague|date=February 2011[/tpl]) would look like this:
