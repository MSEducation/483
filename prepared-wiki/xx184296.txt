Harry August Jansen (October 3, 1883 - June 15, 1955), was born in Copenhagen, Denmark and settled in the United States. He traveled the world as a professional magician under the name Dante the Magician.

==Biography==

Jansen came to St. Paul, Minnesota at the age of 6 with his family.  
At the age of 16 Jansen made his stage debut under Charles Wagner.  He then set off on a world tour for 5 years as the Great Jansen.  In 1922, magician Howard Thurston, realizing Jansen's talent and possible competition to him, engaged Jansen to star in the #2 Thurston show. Thurston gave Jansen the stage name of Dante.  The name came from the original Dante, Oscar Eliason (1869–1899),[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.sydneymagic.net/eliason/oe-afterdante.html | title = OSCAR ELIASON - After Dante: | accessdate = 2010-10-02 | quote = The Great Jansen's success had already reached the stage where there were no less than three Jansens falsely using the name of Jansen, as well as his printing, and exploiting themselves to Managers with their wares of inferior quality. Mr. Thurston had knowledge of this and within the next few days, when negotiations were completed, pointed out this fact and expressed his liking for the name DANTE, and further said that he himself would have adopted it in 1906 it had it not been almost simultaneous with the death of Oscar Eliason who was accidentally shot in New South Wales, Australia, after having gained a reputation under the name of DANTE the Magician. However more than fifteen years had now elapsed and no one had perpetuated the name of Dante as a Magician, so Mr. Thurston as well as the Great Jansen thought this the opportune time and the logical title for the coming Master of Magic to be. Hence Dante the Magician Inc. came into being with Howard Thurston as the owner of the title.[/tpl] who had been killed in a tragic hunting accident in Australia years earlier.  In 1925, Dante the Magician Inc. came into being with Thurston as co-owner.  The 2nd unit Thurston show was built and co-produced by Jansen.
Dante was known throughout the world under the name Dante the Magician, working in vaudeville, burlesque, legitimate theatre, films, and in later years, television.  Dante and his troupe, consisting of between 25 to 40 performers, made several global trips and appeared in many U.S. theaters.  His stage trademark was to utter three nonsense words, "Sim Sala Bim" (taken from the lyrics of a Danish children's song[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU2x1W6trAk | title = YouTube - Højt På En Gren En Krage - Danish Children's song | accessdate = 2010-10-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se1xQvGPcv4 | title = YouTube - KRAUKA - Højt på en gren en krage (2010) | accessdate = 2010-10-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pAxaiQFcH8 | title = YouTube - Hoejt paa en gren en Krage | accessdate = 2010-10-01[/tpl]), during his performances to acknowledge applause. He can be seen using these words in the Swedish 1931 feature Dantes mysterier[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021783/ | title = Dantes mysterier (1931) - IMDb | accessdate = 2010-10-02[/tpl] (Dante's Mysteries[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMNPqVPV414 | title = YouTube - Dante's Mysteries | accessdate = 2010-10-02[/tpl]) and in the 1942 Laurel and Hardy comedy A-Haunting We Will Go. 
In 1940 he produced and starred the Broadway[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=1011 | title = Sim Sala Bim / IBDB: The official source for Broadway Information: | accessdate = 2010-10-02[/tpl] revue Sim Sala Bim[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL2c6XxFpUc | title = YouTube - Dante - Sim Sala Bim | accessdate = 2010-10-02 | date = 1940-09-09[/tpl] on the Morosco Theatre. With television, the public stayed home more often, and the world of variety theatre suffered drastically. As a result, Dante retired to his Southern California in the late 1940s.  
He died at his ranch in Northridge, California, of a heart attack, at the age of 71.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Dante, 'King of Magicians,' Dies at Home |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/524500662.html?dids=524500662:524500662&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&date=Jun+17%2C+1955&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=Dante%2C+%27King+of+Magicians%2C%27+Dies+at+Home&pqatl=google |quote=A native of Denmark, Dante's real name was Harry A.

==Legacy==

With Dante's death, what historically has been known as the "Golden Age of Magic" came to an end. Gone were the variety theaters of the world, and with it were the large traveling magic productions that had thrilled and mystified millions for generations. In prior decades, the magical lineage created by the American public had elevated magicians Alexander Herrmann, Harry Kellar, Thurston and Dante to the position of the #1 magician in the country.
Shortly before Dante's death, he approached a young magician, Lee Grabel, to be his successor in the lineage of great magicians. Plans were underway at the time of Dante's death. However, because Dante died before making a public announcement, some magical historians believe the lineage ended with Dante. This magician has since chosen a Las Vegas headliner magician, Lance Burton to be his successor, therefore carrying on the tradition of the magical lineage to another generation. Despite this, its authenticity is still questioned by some.
In 1991, magic historian Phil Temple published the definitive biography of Dante the Magician, Dante - The Devil Himself, based largely on Dante's personal records, and Temple's friendship with surviving family members who had toured with the show decades earlier. 
Years later, a memoir about life on the road with the Dante show was written by Marion Trikosko, who spent two years with Dante as an assistant. His book, Trouping with Dante, was published in 2006.
