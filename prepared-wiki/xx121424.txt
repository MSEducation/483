In Iberia the name eventually changed to the Spanish Juan and the Portuguese João. Johannes, Hannes, Hanns, Hans, and Johann are all possible variants in German. Johannes is also used in Finnish. János is Hungarian and Ion Romanian. In Czech, Jan, Honza, Honzík, Jeník, and Jenda are used. In Ethiopian, the term Zan, corresponding to title of sovereignty, seems related to Gianni.
