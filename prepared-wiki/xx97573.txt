The follow-up single "Razors Edge" released in April 1983 reached #36 on the national charts.
On 13 February 1983, Gordon Franklin & the Wilderness Ensemble performed "Let the Franklin Flow" at the People for Nuclear Disarmament Concert at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl. The ensemble included members of Goanna and fellow folk rock group Redgum, Peter Garrett of Midnight Oil (later Australian Federal Minister for Education) and Lucas. In May, "Let the Franklin Flow" was issued as a single with Lucas and Jeff Campbell as producers. Howard, the song's writer, was credited as F. River. The single reached No. 12 nationally. Proceeds supported the Tasmanian Wilderness Society's campaign against the proposed damming of Tasmania's Gordon and Franklin Rivers for a hydroelectricity project. Howard physically supported the protests by joining the picket lines. The B-side of the single, "Franklin River – World Heritage", was written and  recorded by the Society's director, Bob Brown who later became a senator and the leader of Australian Greens.
On 19 April 1983, Goanna won three Countdown Music and Video Awards for their work in 1982: Spirit of Place won 'Best Debut Album', "Solid Rock" won 'Best Debut Single' and the band itself won 'Best New Talent (Johnny O'Keefe Memorial Award)'. "Solid Rock" is the first charting rock record to feature extensive use of the didgeridoo, one of the world's oldest wood instruments, played by Billy Inda (No Fixed Address) and Bobby Djabanunga. The follow-up single, "Razor’s Edge" (a 1982 reworking of their 1979 EP's title track) was released in April 1983. The more acoustically based folk-rock track reached No. 36.
By late 1983 Goanna included new guitarists Ross Hannaford (Daddy Cool, Mighty Kong) and Russell Smith (Company Caine, Mighty Kong) with Robert Ross replaced by Geoff Bridgford (Bee Gees),(Jim Keays Band) on drums. In October they released a third single, "That Day (Is Coming Sooner)", which peaked at No. 67. Surprisingly WEA dropped the band from the label. Howard then travelled around the world looking for other record companies to pick them up. During this time he visited Ireland, the home of his ancestors and experienced another cultural awakening. [tpl]Quote|The whole experience of traveling through aboriginal Australia and awakening to that cultural reality made me ask the question, okay where do I fit here? In this landscape, in Australia, I'm not aboriginal, I'm not of the land, I'm not of this country - so I came from somewhere else. It made me want to look at where my own people had come from.|Shane Howard[/tpl] The band were just on the verge of signing a worldwide deal with CBS, when Warners in Australia contacted them and re-signed the band,who then spent much of 1984 recording a new album at John French's 'Fast Forward' studio in Melbourne,'The Music Farm' studio in Byron Bay and also in Los Angeles at George Massenburg's 'The Complex' studio with Little Feat's keyboard player Billy Payne.The band's second album, Oceania, produced by Billy Payne, was released in April 1985 and reached No. 29. The first single from this album, "Common Ground", had been released in December 1984 and peaked at No. 42. The second single, "Dangerous Dancing", released in May 1985 only reached No. 91. Throughout 1985, the band toured relentlessly in support of the album, with a constantly revolving line-up of members, including at one stage ex-Little River Band drummer Derek Pellicci. The band then released a non-album single, "Song for Africa", dedicated for famine relief, in September but it failed to chart. WEA dropped Goanna from their roster again.
On 13 July 1985, Goanna performed three songs for the Oz for Africa concert (part of the global Live Aid program) – "Common Ground", "Song for Africa", "Solid Rock". It was broadcast in Australia (on both Seven Network and Nine Network) and on MTV in the US.[tpl]cite web |url=http://liveaid.free.fr/pages/ozforafrika-uk.html |title=Oz for Africa |publisher=liveaid.free.fr |accessdate=3 December 2008[/tpl] In September, still promoting Oceania and the newly released "Song for Africa", Howard went "walkabout", and the band was forced to cancel $20,000 worth of bookings. Eventually a disillusioned Howard had travelled to South Australia to perform with indigenous musician and didgeridoo player Bart Willoughby (No Fixed Address). With Howard no longer involved, Goanna effectively disbanded but reformed for one final farewell tour of Victoria, NSW and Tasmania with aboriginal band Coloured Stone in October 1986.  The final gig of the tour was on 25 October 1986 for the Baha'i  Concert For Peace at the Geelong Performing Arts Centre. The live version of "Solid Rock" featured on the re-mastered release of "Spirit of place" comes from this performance. The final line-up consisted of Shane & Marcia Howard, Rose Bygrave; Dave Stewart drums; Jo Imbrol bass; Simon Curfy and Selwyn Burns guitars; Bunna Lawrie, Bart Willoughby, Tony Lovett and Nicky Moffatt on Didjeridu & percussion: Bill Dart F.O.H sound and recording engineer for db Concert Sound. On 24 & 25 January 1987 yet another final fling occurred when much the same ensemble played at the Tamworth Country Music Festival sponsored by Yamaha Music Australia.

==After Goanna==

Shane Howard started his solo career by releasing Back to the Track in 1988, other albums followed, River (1990), Time Will Tell (1993) and Clan (1996). In 1986 Rose Bygrave toured briefly playing Reggae with Australian Diva Wendy Saddington with Mick 'Python Lee' Liber on Guitar, Angelica Booth on Bass, Javier Fredis on Congas and Dezzy McKenna on Drums. At ENREC Studios in Tamworth they made one album Lightning Ridge which was never released. Bygrave then issued a solo single, "Maybe Midnight" in June 1989 and started worked on a solo album which was not released at the time. Bygrave's first solo album, White Bird, finally appeared in 1999 and was followed by Walking Home (2001) and North (2009). Marcia Howard released solo albums, Butterfly, in 2000 and Burning in the Rain, recorded in Ireland, and produced by Stephen Cooney, in 2004. Marcia's song 'Poison Tree' was recorded with Mary Black and released on the compilation C.D, 'A Woman's Heart- a Decade on ', in 2003.
In October 1998, Shane Howard, Marcia Howard and Bygrave reformed Goanna and recorded a third album Spirit Returns, released in November. Producing and joining the line-up as a musician and songwriter was Kerryn Tolhurst (The Dingoes), with other guest musicians on the album including Bill Jacobi (bass guitar) and Greg Sheehan (drums). The tracks ranged from the bluesy "What Else is a Life" (which was released as the first single), the country-inflected "This Old Town", to the politicised "Song for East Timor", as well as a cover of the Tolhurst-penned, The Dingoes track "Your Song". Marcia Howard's "Sorry", was written for Australia's 'stolen generation' of indigenous people and based upon Margaret Tuckers' story of a Cummeragunja woman taken from her family as a young girl. It was also influenced by the documentary Lousy Little Sixpence. Shane Howard continued the recording in Ireland with Stephen Cooney and Liam O'Maonlai (Hot House Flowers), while Tolhurst added the final touches in New York. Goanna were asked to perform the song at the first National Sorry Day at Parliament House in Canberra in 1998, the same morning the "Bringing Them Home" report was released. "Sorry" was released by Goanna both on CD and as a resource book and video as a Sorry Day resource by Fraynework . The video included live footage of Goanna performing at the Port Fairy Folk Festival inter-cut with footage of Lousy Little Sixpence.
In August–September 2006 Shane Howard performed "Solid Rock" as part of the Countdown Spectacular tour[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.acerarena.com.au/default.asp?flash=1&p=5&n=4|title=The Countdown Spectacular|publisher=Acer Arena|date=17 May 2006|accessdate=18 August 2010[/tpl] and was joined at the Melbourne concerts by his sister, Marcia, and Bygrave.
