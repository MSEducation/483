===Analog-to-digital conversion===

KVDA discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 60, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 38,[tpl]cite web|url=http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf |title=DTV Tentative Channel Designations for the First and the Second Rounds |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-03-24[/tpl]CDBS Print using PSIP to display KVDA's virtual channel as 60 on digital television receivers, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.

==News operation==

Noticiero 60 was the name of KVDA's news operation, which began with the station in 1989.  Within one ratings period, the station was challenging KWEX-TV for the position of the top-rated Spanish-language station, which KWEX had held for almost 30 years.
In 2007, budget cuts announced by NBC Universal resulted in the cancellation of Noticiero 60 and its replacement with a regional newscast based out of a new production center at KXTX-TV in Dallas.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl] This move attracted criticism from the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, including formal statements against NBC Universal.The National Association of Hispanic Journalists
