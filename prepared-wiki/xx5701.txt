==History==

Kuala Lumpur has its origins in the 1850s, when the Malay Chief of Klang, Raja Abdullah,[tpl]cite web|title=Kuala Lumpur History|url=http://all.talkmalaysia.com/kuala-lumpur/kuala-lumpur-history/|publisher=All Malaysia|accessdate=2009-09-15[/tpl] hired some Chinese labourers to open new and larger tin mines for tin prospectors. The miners landed at the confluence of Sungai Gombak (previously known as Sungai Lumpur, meaning "muddy river") and Sungai Klang (Klang River) to open mines at Ampang, Pudu and Batu. These mines developed into a trading post which became a frontier town.[tpl]cite web|url=http://yapahloy.tripod.com/yap_ah_loy%27s_administration.htm |title=Yap Ah Loy's Administration |publisher=Yapahloy.tripod.com |date=12 September 2000 |accessdate=2011-10-05[/tpl]
The tin prospectors settled in Ampang, and formed gangs within themselves.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kiat.net/malaysia/KL/history.html|title=From tin town to tower city|publisher=kiat.net|accessdate=2010-09-28[/tpl] The two largest Chinese gangsters, the Hakka-dominated Hai San and the Hokkien-dominated Ghee Hin, frequently engaged in warfare to gain control of tin production in the town. The incessant warfare between the two factions brought tin mine production to a standstill, prompting the British, who ruled Selangor as one of the Federated Malay States at the time, to appoint a Chinese Kapitan (headman) to administer Kuala Lumpur.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kuala-lumpur.ws/klhistory.htm|title=Kuala Lumpur History|publisher=Kuala-Lumpur.ws|accessdate=2010-09-28[/tpl] Hiu Siew, the owner of a mine in Lukut, was elected as the first Kapitan. As one of the first traders to arrive in Ampang (along with Yap Ah Sze), he sold provisions to the miners in exchange for tin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://yapahloy.tripod.com/the_first_traders_in_kl.htm|title=The First Traders in KL|publisher=Yap Ah Loy.tripod|accessdate=2010-09-18[/tpl]
During the early times, Kuala Lumpur had many problems, including the Selangor Civil War; it was also plagued by diseases and constant fires and floods. Around the 1870s, the third Chinese Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur, Yap Ah Loy, emerged as leader, and became responsible for the survival and subsequent systematic growth of this town. He began to develop Kuala Lumpur from a small, obscure settlement into a booming mining town.[tpl]cite web|title=Sejarah Malaysia|url=http://sejarahmalaysia.pnm.my/portalBI/detail.php?section=sm02&spesifik_id=15&ttl_id=3|publisher=Sejarah Malaysia|accessdate=2007-12-15[/tpl] In 1880, the state capital of Selangor was moved from Klang to the more strategically advantageous Kuala Lumpur.[tpl]cite web|title=Kuala Lumpur|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9046321/Kuala-Lumpur|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2007-12-06[/tpl]

===Redevelopment of modern Kuala Lumpur===

In 1881, a flood swept through the town, following a fire that had engulfed it earlier. These successive problems destroyed the town's structures of wood and atap (thatching). The aftermath had rendered the town in a muddy state. As the town lies in the confluence of two rivers: Klang River and Gombak River, the town was later given its name Kuala Lumpur, which means muddy estuary.[tpl]cite web|last=Britannica Academic Edition|title=Kuala Lumpur|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324134/Kuala-Lumpur>|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=Mar 4, 2014[/tpl] As a response, Frank Swettenham, the British Resident of Selangor, required that buildings be constructed of brick and tile. Hence, Kapitan Yap Ah Loy bought a sprawling piece of real estate for the setting up of a brick industry which would spur the rebuilding of Kuala Lumpur. This place is the eponymous Brickfields. Hence, destroyed atap buildings were replaced with brick and tiled ones. He restructured the building layout of the city. Many of the new brick buildings mirrored those of shop houses in southern China, characterised by "five foot ways" as well as skilled Chinese carpentry work. This resulted in a distinct eclectic shop house architecture typical to this region. A railway line increased accessibility into the growing town. Development intensified in the 1890s, leading to the creation of a Sanitary Board. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy spent a sum of $20,000 to expand road access in the city significantly, linking up tin mines with the city, these roads include the main arterial roads of Ampang Road, Pudu Road and Petaling Street.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
As Chinese Kapitan, he was vested with wide powers on par with Malay community leaders. He implemented law reforms and introduced new legal measures. He would also preside over a small claims court. With a police force amounting only 6, he was able to uphold to rule of law. He built a prison which could accommodate 60 prisoners at any time. Kapitan Yap Ah Loy also built Kuala Lumpur's first school and a major tapioca mill in Petaling Street of which the Selangor's Sultan Abdul Samad had an interest.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
In 1896, Kuala Lumpur was chosen as the capital of the newly formed Federated Malay States.[tpl]cite web|work=Nation History|publisher=National Library of Malaysia|title=The Federated Malay States (1896)|url=http://sejarahmalaysia.pnm.my/portalBI/detail.php?section=sm01&spesifik_id=437&ttl_id=60|accessdate=2007-12-06[/tpl] A mixture of different communities settled in various sections of Kuala Lumpur. The Chinese mainly settled around the commercial centre of Market Square, east of the Klang River, and towards Chinatown. The Malays, Indian Chettiars, and Indian Muslims resided along Java Street (now Jalan Tun Perak). The Padang, now known as Merdeka Square, was the centre of the British administrative offices.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Virtual Malaysia Magazine|accessdate=2007-12-18|title=Old-World Charm|url=http://magazine.virtualmalaysia.com/content.cfm/ID/17AD5478-79E7-4E6F-B76E41D642B3F579|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101150055/http://magazine.virtualmalaysia.com/content.cfm/ID/17AD5478-79E7-4E6F-B76E41D642B3F579 |archivedate=1 January 2008[/tpl]

==Cityscape==

===Architecture===

The architecture of Kuala Lumpur is a blend of old colonial influences, Asian traditions, Malay Islamic inspirations, modern, and postmodern architecture mix.[tpl]cite news|publisher=New York Times, Travel|accessdate=2007-12-18|date=23 September 1990|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DC143AF930A1575AC0A966958260|title=Landmarks of Kuala Lumpur | first1=Barbaralee | last1=Diamonstein | first2=New | last2=Jersey[/tpl] Being a relatively young city compared with other Southeast Asian capitals such as Bangkok, Jakarta and Manila, most of Kuala Lumpur's colonial buildings were built toward the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. These buildings have Moorish, Tudor, Neo-Gothic or Grecian-Spanish style or architecture.[tpl]cite book|title=British Colonial Architecture in Malaysia 1800–1930|last=Ahmad|first=A. Ghafar|publisher=Museums Association of Malaysia|location=Kuala Lumpur|year=1997[/tpl]extract Most of the styling has been modified to use local resources and acclimatised to the local climate, which is hot and humid all year around
Prior to the Second World War, many shophouses, usually two stories with functional shops on the ground floor and separate residential spaces upstairs, were built around the old city centre. These shop-houses drew inspiration from Straits Chinese and European traditions.  Some of these shophouses have made way for new developments but there are still many standing today around Medan Pasar (Old Market Square), Chinatown, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Doraisamy, Bukit Bintang and Tengkat Tong Shin areas.
Independence coupled with the rapid economic growth from the 1970s to the 1990s and with Islam being the official religion in the country, has resulted in the construction of buildings with a more local and Islamic flavour arise around the city. Many of these buildings derive their design from traditional Malay items such as the songkok and the keris. Some of these buildings have Islamic geometric motifs integrated with the designs of the building, signifying Islamic restriction on imitating nature through drawings.[tpl]cite book|title=World Architecture: An Illustrated History|author=Copplestone, Trewin|page=149|publisher=London, Hamlyn|year=1976|isbn=978-0-600-03954-9[/tpl] Examples of these buildings are Menara Telekom, Menara Maybank, Dayabumi Complex, and the Islamic Centre.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=t0cqkU5RxwgC&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71|title=Malaysia, Modernity and the Multimedia Super Corridor: A Critical Geography, page 74|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=2007-12-14|isbn=978-0-203-64736-3|date=12 March 2004[/tpl] Some buildings such as the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia and National Planetarium have been built to masquerade as a place of worship, complete with dome and minaret, when in fact it is a place of science and knowledge.

Late modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the late-1990s and early-2000s. With the economic development, old buildings such as Bok House have been razed to make way for new ones. Buildings with all-glass shells exist throughout the city, with the most prominent examples being the Petronas Twin Towers and Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre.  Kuala Lumpur's central business district today has shifted around the Kuala Lumpur city centre (KLCC) where many new and tall buildings with modern and postmodern architecture fill the skyline. According to the World Tallest 50 Urban Agglomeration 2010 Projection by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, Kuala Lumpur was ranked 10th among cities to have most buildings above 100 meters with a combined height of 34035 meters from its 244 high rise buildings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ctbuh.org/HighRiseInfo/TallestDatabase/50TallestAgglomerations/tabid/1006/language/en-GB/Default.aspx|title=The Worlds Tallest 50 Urban Agglomerations|work=CTBUH Journal|accessdate=2012-01-14|publisher=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat[/tpl]
