[[Clamping (graphics)]]

CATEGORIES: Computer graphics algorithms

In computer graphics, clamping is the process of limiting a position to an area. Unlike wrapping, clamping merely moves the point to the nearest available value.

To put clamping into perspective, pseudocode for clamping is as follows:

==Uses==

One of the many uses of clamping in computer graphics is the placing of a detail inside a polygonâ€”for example, a bullethole on a wall. It can also be used with wrapping to create a variety of effects.
Can also mean clamped to a certain value. For example, in OpenGL, the glClearColor takes a GLclampf value which is a gl float value 'clamped' to the range 0,1.
