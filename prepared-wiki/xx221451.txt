[[Annexation]]

CATEGORIES: International law, Political geography, Sovereignty

Annexation (Latin ad, to, and nexus, joining) is the permanent acquisition and incorporation of some territorial entity into another geo-political entity (either adjacent or non-contiguous).[tpl]Citation |first=David M. |last=Edelstein |title=Occupational Hazards: Why Military Occupations Succeed or Fail |journal=International Security |volume=29 |number=1 |date=Summer 2004 |pages=49–91[/tpl] Usually, it is implied that the territory and population being annexed is the smaller, more peripheral, and weaker of the two merging entities, barring physical size. It can also imply a certain measure of coercion, expansionism or unilateralism on the part of the stronger of the merging entities. Because of this, more positive euphemisms like political union/unification or reunification are sometimes seen in discourse. Annexation differs from cession and amalgamation, because unlike cession where territory is given or sold through treaty, or amalgamation (where the authorities of both sides are asked if they agree with the merge), annexation is a unilateral act where territory is seized and held by one state and legitimized via general recognition by the other international bodies (i.e. countries and intergovernmental organisations).[tpl]EB1911|inline=1| |wstitle=Annexation[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Annexation|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/26334/annexation|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=20 March 2014[/tpl]
During World War II, the use of annexation deprived whole populations of the safeguards provided by international laws governing military occupations. The authors of the Fourth Geneva Convention made a point of "giving these rules an absolute character", thus making it much more difficult for a state to bypass international law through the use of annexation.Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.

==International law after 1948==

The Fourth Geneva Convention (GCIV) of 1949 amplified the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 with respect to the question of the protection of civilians.[tpl]cite web|title=Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949.  Commentary - Art. 47. Part III : Status and treatment of protected persons #Section III : Occupied territories|url=http://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600054?OpenDocument|work=ICRC|accessdate=20 March 2014|quote=it was obvious that they were in fact always subservient to the will of the Occupying Power. Such practices were incompatible with the traditional concept of occupation (as defined in Article 43 of the Hague Regulations of 1907)[/tpl] GCIV also emphasised the United Nations Charter: the United Nations Charter (June 26, 1945) had prohibited war of aggression (See articles 1.1, 2.3, 2.4) and GCIV Article 47, the first paragraph in Section III: Occupied territories, restricted the effects of annexation on the rights of persons within those territories:
Article 49 prohibits mass movement of people out of or into occupied territory:Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. Geneva, 12 August 1949.Commentary on Part III : Status and treatment of protected persons #Section III : Occupied territories Art. 49 by the ICRC
Protocol I (1977): "Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts" has additional articles which cover military occupation, but many countries including the United States are not signatory to this additional protocol.

==Examples since 1948==

===Portuguese India===

In 1954, the residents of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, a Portuguese enclave within India, ended Portuguese rule with the help of nationalist volunteers. From 1954 to 1961, the territory enjoyed de facto independence. In 1961, the territory was merged with India after its government signed an agreement with the Indian government.
In 1961, India and Portugal engaged in a brief military conflict over Goa and Daman and Diu, Portuguese enclaves within India. India invaded and conquered the areas after 36 hours of fighting, ending 451 years of Portuguese colonial rule in India. The action was seen in India as a liberation of historically Indian territory. In Portugal however, the loss of Goa and the Daman and Diu was seen as a national tragedy. The United Nations condemned the annexation, with a veto from Russia.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/5033 |title=The United Nations Security Council S/5033 |publisher=www.un.org |date= |accessdate=28 March 2014[/tpl] Goa and Daman and Diu were incorporated into India.

===Sikkim===

In 1947, a popular vote rejected Sikkim's joining the Indian Union and the prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, agreed to a special protectorate status for Sikkim. Sikkim came under the suzerainty of India, which controlled its external affairs, defence, diplomacy and communications, but Sikkim otherwise retained autonomy. A state council was established in 1955 to allow for constitutional government under the Chogyal. Meanwhile trouble was brewing in the state after the Sikkim National Congress demanded fresh elections and greater representation for the Nepalese. In 1973, riots in front of the palace led to a formal request for protection from India. The Chogyal was proving to be extremely unpopular with the people. In 1975, the Kazi (Prime Minister) appealed to the Indian Parliament for a change in Sikkim's status so that it could become a state of India. In April, the Indian Army moved into Sikkim, seizing the city of Gangtok and disarming the Palace Guards. A referendum was held in which 97.5% of the voting people (59% of the people entitled to vote) voted to join the Indian Union. A few weeks later, on May 16, 1975, Sikkim officially became the 22nd state of the Indian Union and the monarchy was abolished.Department of Information and Public Relations, Government of Sikkim. 2005-09-29. http://www.sikkimipr.org/GENERAL/HISTORY/history_of_sikkim.htm.

===Ogaden===

In 1954, former British Ogaden (a Somali Region) was annexed by Abyssinia. Somali nationalists have waged wars of liberation since 1954. Currently, the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) leads this nationalist effort and is engaged in a fierce military confrontation with Ethiopia, the new name of Abyssinia.

===Rockall===

On 18 September 1955 at precisely 10:16 am, in what would be the final territorial expansion of the British Empire, Rockall was declared officially annexed by the British Crown when Lieutenant-Commander Desmond Scott RN, Sergeant Brian Peel RM, Corporal AA Fraser RM, and James Fisher (a civilian naturalist and former Royal Marine), were deposited on the island by a Royal Navy helicopter from [tpl]HMS|Vidal[/tpl] (coincidentally named after the man who first charted the island). The team cemented in a brass plaque on Hall's Ledge and hoisted the Union Flag to stake the UK's claim.[tpl]cite news|author=BBC staff |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/21/newsid_4582000/4582327.stm |title=On this day: 21 September 1955: Britain claims Rockall |publisher=BBC|accessdate=March 2012[/tpl]  However, any effect of this annexation on valuable maritime rights claims under UNCLOS in the waters beyond 12 nautical miles from Rockall are neither claimed by Britain nor recognised by Denmark (for the Faroe Islands), the Republic of Ireland or Iceland.

===East Timor===

Following an Indonesian invasion in 1975, East Timor was annexed by Indonesia and was known as Timor Timur. It was regarded by Indonesia as the country's 27th province, but this was never recognised by the United Nations. The people of East Timor resisted Indonesian forces in a prolonged guerilla campaign. (See: Indonesian rule in East Timor).
Following a referendum held in 1999 under a UN-sponsored agreement between the two sides, the people of East Timor rejected the offer of autonomy within Indonesia. East Timor achieved independence in 2002 and is now officially known as Timor-Leste.

===Western Sahara===

In 1975, and following the Madrid Accords between Morocco, Mauritania and Spain, the latter withdrew from the territory and ceded the administration to Morocco and Mauritania. This was challenged by an independentist movement, the Polisario Front that waged a guerrilla war against both Morocco and Mauritania. In 1979, and after a military putsch, Mauritania withdrew from the territory which left it controlled by Morocco. A United Nations peace process was initiated in 1991, but it has been stalled, and as of mid-2012, the UN is holding direct negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario front to reach a solution to the conflict.

===West Bank===

The part of former Mandatory Palestine occupied by the Jordanian Army during the Israeli War of Independence, which Israelis call "Judea and Samaria", was renamed "the West Bank". It was annexed to Jordan in 1950 at the request of a Palestinian delegation.http://www.jcpa.org.il/art/knesset6.htm It had been questioned, however, how representative that delegation was, and at the insistence of the Arab League Jordan was considered a trustee only.Arab League Session: 12-II Date: May 1950 Although only the United Kingdom and Pakistan recognized annexation by Jordan, the British did not consider it Sovereign to Jordan

Jordan did not officially relinquish its claim to rule the West Bank until 1988.[tpl]cite book |title=A Historical Atlas of Jordan |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |first=Amy |last=Romano |year=2003 |page=51 |isbn=978-0-8239-3980-0[/tpl] Israel has not taken the step of annexing the territory rather, there were enacted a complex (and highly controversial) system of military government decrees in effect applying Israeli law in many spheres to Israeli settlements and to them alone.

===East Jerusalem===

During the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel captured East Jerusalem, a part of the West Bank, from Jordan. On June 27, 1967, Israel unilaterally extended its law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem and some of the surrounding area, incorporating about 70 square kilometers of territory  into the Jerusalem Municipality. Although at the time Israel informed the United Nations that its measures constituted administrative and municipal integration rather than annexation, later rulings by the Israeli Supreme Court indicated that East Jerusalem had become part of Israel. In 1980, Israel passed the Jerusalem Law as part of its Basic Law, which declared Jerusalem the "complete and united" capital of Israel. In other words, Israel purported to annex East Jerusalem.Sela, Avraham.  "Jerusalem." The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East.  Ed. Avraham Sela.  New York: Continuum, 2002.  pp. 391-498.Frank, Mitch.  Understanding the Holy Land: Answering Questions about the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict.

UNISPAL - United Nations Information System on the Question of Palestine.  8 October 1980.  8 June 2008 The annexation was declared null and void by UNSC Resolutions 252, 267, 271, 298, 465, 476 UNSC Resolutions referred to in UNSC res 476 - 252, 267, 271, 298, 465 and  UNSC res 478UNSC res 478
Jewish neighborhoods have since been built in East Jerusalem, and Israeli Jews have since also settled in Arab neighborhoods there, though some Jews may have returned from their 1948 expulsion after the Siege of Jerusalem (1948).
No countries recognized Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem, except Costa Rica, and those who maintained embassies in Israel did not move them to Jerusalem.[tpl]cite journal|first=Ian S. |last=Lustick |title=Has Israel Annexed East Jerusalem?| journal=Middle East Policy Council Journal|volume=5 |date=16 January 1997|number=1|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4967.1997.tb00247.x[/tpl]
The United States Congress has passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act, which recognizes Jerusalem as the united capital of Israel and requires the relocation of the U.S. embassy there, but the bill has been waived by Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama on national security grounds.

===Golan Heights===

Israel captured two-thirds of the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War, and subsequently built Jewish settlements in the area. In 1981, Israel passed the Golan Heights Law, which extended Israeli "law, jurisdiction, and administration" to the area, including the Shebaa farms area. This declaration was declared "null and void and without international legal effect" by United Nations Security Council Resolution 497. The only state that recognized the annexation is the Federated States of Micronesia.
The vast majority of Syrian Druze in Majdal Shams, the largest Syrian village in the Golan, have held onto their Syrian passports. When Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981, 95% of the native Syrians refused Israeli citizenship, and are still firmly of that opinion, in spite of the 15 March 2011-present Syrian civil uprising.[tpl]cite web|title=Syria: 'We still feel Syrian,' say Druze of Golan Heights|url=http://www.ansamed.info/ansamed/en/news/sections/generalnews/2012/11/28/Syria-still-feel-Syrian-say-Druze-Golan-Heights_7869606.html[/tpl]
On 29 November 2012, the United Nations General Assembly reaffirmed it was "deeply concerned that Israel has not withdrawn from the Syrian Golan, which has been under occupation since 1967, contrary to the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions," and "stressed the illegality of the Israeli settlement construction and other activities in the occupied Syrian Golan since 1967."[tpl]cite web|title=UN Doc A/67/L.24|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/67/L.24[/tpl] The General Assembly then voted by majority, 110 in favour to 6 against (Canada, Israel, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, United States), with 59 abstentions, to demand a full Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Golan Heights.

===Kuwait===

After being allied with Iraq during the Iran – Iraq War (largely due to desiring Iraqi protection from Iran), Kuwait was invaded and declared annexed by Iraq (under Saddam Hussein) in August 1990. Hussein's primary justifications included a charge that Kuwaiti territory was in fact an Iraqi province, and that annexation was retaliation for "economic warfare" Kuwait had waged through slant drilling into Iraq's oil supplies. The monarchy was deposed after annexation, and an Iraqi governor installed.
United States President George H. W. Bush ultimately condemned Iraq's actions, and moved to drive out Iraqi forces. Authorized by the UN Security Council, an American-led coalition of 34 nations fought the Gulf War to reinstate the Kuwaiti Emir. Iraq's invasion (and annexation) was deemed illegal and Kuwait remains an independent nation today.

==Subnational annexation==

Within countries that are subdivided noncontiguously, annexation can also take place whereby a lower-tier subdivision can annex territory under the jurisdiction of a higher-tier subdivision. An example of this is in the United States, where incorporated cities and towns often expand their boundaries by annexing unincorporated land adjacent to them. Municipalities can also annex or be annexed by other municipalities, though this is less common in the United States. Laws governing the ability and the extent cities can expand in this fashion are defined by the individual states' constitutions.
Annexation of neighbouring communities occurs in Canada. The city of Calgary, for example, has in the past annexed the communities of Bridgeland, Riverside, Sunnyside, Hillhurst, Hunter, Hubalta, Ogden, Forest Lawn, Midnapore, Shepard, Montgomery, and Bowness."Annexation Policies and Urban Growth Management in Calgary." Tim Creelman. Accessed December 17, 2009.History of Annexation. City of Calgary. Accessed December 17, 2009.
