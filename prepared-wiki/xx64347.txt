Major League Lacrosse All-Star Game is the all-star game of the MLL. 
The inaugural 2001 All-Star Game, was not called the "All-Star Game"; instead it was titled the Major League Lacrosse LacrosseStar Game. From 2001–2003, the All-Star Game had the National Division playing the American Division. The league did not schedule an All Star Game in 2004. 
The 2005 game took place in Denver, Colorado on Saturday, July 2, 2005. The format for the 2005 game was "Old School" vs. "Young Guns". The rosters were determined by both fan and MLL team voting. Team "Old School" was composed of players who began their MLL careers in the league’s inaugural 2001 season. Members of the ‘Young Guns’ team began their playing careers in 2002 through the present.
The 2006 Major League Lacrosse All-Star game took place on July 6, 2006 at Boston University’s Nickerson Field. The MLL and US Lacrosse partnered to create the format for this All-Star game, pitting the MLL All-Stars against the United States National Team. The game was a final tune-up for the U.S. Team before they played in the 2006 World Lacrosse Championship.
The 2007 game was played on July 8 in Boston for the second year in row, but this time at Harvard Stadium. The format for the 2007 game was the Western Conference All-Stars against the Eastern Conference All-Stars.
The 2008 game was played in Denver, Colorado, in front of 10,124 people, with the Western Conference defeating the Eastern Conference 31–15, setting a league record for most points scored by an all-star team. Game MVP Ryan Powell scored a record six goals, and also had one assist.
The 2009 game used the "Young Guns vs Old School" format. The “Young Guns” squad was composed of players from the 2007–2009 classes, while the “Old School” squad was made up by those players from the classes prior to and including 2006.
The 2010 game was Team USA vs MLL All-Stars.
The 2011 game, the teams were selected by a pair of honorary captains, who earned the privilege after winning the “Ultimate MLL Fan Fantasy” Contest. "Team Warrior" by Nathan Solomon, a 14-year-old Chesapeake Bayhawks fan from Alpharetta, Georgia and "Team Authority" by Michael Hatala, a 13-year-old Long Island Lizards fan of Glen Cove, New York, selected the teams on the Friday night before the game.
