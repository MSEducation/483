Lisa Nicole Lopes (May 27, 1971 – April 25, 2002), better known by her stage name Left Eye, was an American rapper, dancer, musician, and singer-songwriter. She broke to fame as a member of the R&B girl group TLC. Lopes contributed her self-written raps to many of TLC's hit singles, including "Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg", "What About Your Friends", "Hat 2 da Back", "No Scrubs", "Waterfalls", "Girl Talk". Lopes won four Grammy Awards for her work with TLC.[tpl]cite web|title=Grammy.com|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=tlc&title=&year=All&genre=All|accessdate=May 16, 2012[/tpl] On April 25, 2002, Lopes was killed in a car crash in La Ceiba, Honduras. She was the driver of the vehicle when she rolled off the road and was thrown out; she died from her injuries. The last days of her life were filmed from March 30, 2002 until her death on April 25, 2002, including the accident that took her life; later the footage was made into a documentary called The Last Days of Left Eye which aired on VH1's rock docs on May 19, 2007; eight days prior to Lopes's 36th birthday.

==Early Life==

Lisa Lopes was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Wanda, a seamstress, and Ronald Lopes, an Army staff sergeant.[tpl]cite news|last= Smolowe |first= Jill |last2= Morrissey |first2= Siobhan |first3= Jill |last3= Westfall |first4= Michael |last4= Cohen |first5= Gail |last5= Wescott |first6= Lori |last6= Rozsa |first7= Lyndon |last7= Stambler |title= Sad Rap |url= http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20136985,00.html |accessdate=February 8, 2014|newspaper=People (magazine)[tpl]![/tpl]People|date=May 13, 2002[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Keeps|first=David A.|title=Life of Fiery Rapper Lisa Lopes Tragically Cut Short|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/life-of-fiery-rapper-lisa-lopes-tragically-cut-short-20120425|accessdate=February 8, 2014|newspaper=Rolling Stone|date=June 6, 2002[/tpl] She has two younger siblings, Ronald and   Raina  . Her father has been described by music journalist and academic Jacqueline Springer as an "oppressively" strict disciplinarian, and one of the few interests that he and Lopes shared was alcohol.[tpl]cite podcast|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03s718g |title= DJ Sara Cox nominates singer Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes |website= Great Lives |publisher= BBC Radio 4 |date= 31 January 2014 |accessdate= 5 March 2014 [/tpl] Lopes's parents separated when she was still at school and for the later years of her childhood she was raised by her paternal grandmother.

==Career==

===TLC===

At the age of 17, having heard of an open casting call for a new girl group through her boyfriend at the time, Lopes moved to Atlanta to audition. TLC started off as a female trio called 2nd Nature.[tpl]cite news|last=Noakes|first=Tim|title=T-Boz: the original tomboy|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/17255/1/t-boz-the-original-tomboy|accessdate=February 8, 2014|newspaper=Dazed & Confused (magazine)[tpl]![/tpl]Dazed & Confused|date=October 2013[/tpl] The group was renamed TLC – derived from the first initials of its then three members — Tionne, Lisa and Crystal.[tpl]cite news|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.|title=Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,623894,00.html|accessdate=February 8, 2014|newspaper=People|date=April 24, 2002|pages=1–2[/tpl] Things did not work out with Crystal Jones, and TLC's manager Perri "Pebbles" Reid brought in Damian Dame backup dancer Rozonda Thomas as a third member of the group. To keep the "initial" theme of the band's name, Rozonda needed a name starting with C, and so became Chilli—a name chosen by Lopes. Band mate Tionne Watkins became T-Boz which was derived from the first letter of her first name and "Boz," which is slang for "boss". Lopes was renamed "Left Eye", after a compliment from a man who once told her he was very attracted to her because of her left eye. Lopes emphasized her nickname by wearing a pair of glasses with the left lens covered with a condom, in keeping with the group's promotion of safe sex, wearing a black stripe under her left eye and, eventually getting her left eyebrow pierced.
The group arrived on the music scene in 1992 with the album Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip. With four singles, it sold six million copies worldwide; TLC became a household name. 1994 saw the release of CrazySexyCool, which sold over 23 million copies worldwide and cemented TLC as one of the biggest female groups of all time.[tpl]cite news|title=TLC Reveal Title and Track-listing For New Collection Inspired By Upcoming VH1 Biopic CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story|url=http://www.sony.com/SCA/company-news/press-releases/epic-records/2013/tlc-reveal-title-and-track-listing-for-new-collect.shtml|accessdate=February 8, 2014|newspaper=Sony|date=September 23, 2013|agency=PR Newswire[/tpl] TLC's third album, FanMail, was released in 1999 and sold over 14 million copies worldwide. Its title was a tribute to TLC's loyal fans and the sleeve contained the names of hundreds of them as a "thank you" to supporters.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9902/25/tlc/index.html?related|title=TLC's glam goddesses resurface with 'Fan Mail'|last=Freydkin|first=Donna|date=February 25, 1999|work=CNN|accessdate=July 24, 2008[/tpl]
During the recording of FanMail, a public conflict began amongst the members of the group. Lopes sent a message to Vibe magazine saying, "I've graduated from this era. I cannot stand 100 percent behind this TLC project and the music that is supposed to represent me."[tpl]cite book|last=Krulik|first=Nancy|title=Lisa Lopes: The Life of a Supernova|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2002|page=41|isbn=0-689-85690-3[/tpl] In response to Lopes' comments, Watkins and Thomas stated to Entertainment Weekly that Lopes "doesn't respect the whole group" and "Left Eye is only concerned with Left Eye". In turn, Lopes sent a reply through Entertainment Weekly issuing a "challenge" to Watkins and Thomas to release solo albums and let the public decide who was the "greatest" member of TLC:
[tpl]cquote|I challenge Tionne  Watkins (T-Boz) and Rozonda Thomas (Chilli) to an album entitled "The Challenge"... a 3-CD set that contains three solo albums. Each album... will be due to the record label by October 1, 2000...I also challenge Dallas 'The Manipulator' Austin to produce all of the material and do it at a fraction of his normal rate. As I think about it, I'm sure LaFace would not mind throwing in a $1.5 million dollar prize for the winner.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1434872/19991123/tlc.jhtml|title=TLC's Left Eye Challenges T-Boz, Chili To Solo Album Showdown|last=Gill|first=John|date=November 23, 1999|work=MTV|accessdate=September 29, 2008[/tpl][/tpl]

We have feelings for each other, which is why we get so mad at each other. I usually say that you cannot hate someone unless you love them. So, we love each other. That's the problem."[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]

===Solo Career===

After FanMail Lopes began to expand her solo career. She became a featured rapper on several singles, including former Spice Girl Melanie C's "Never Be the Same Again", which topped the charts in thirty five countries, including the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite news|last=Youngs|first=Ian|title=Left Eye's sideways look at life|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1952726.stm|accessdate=February 8, 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=April 26, 2002[/tpl] She was also featured on the first single from Donell Jones' second album, "U Know What's Up", and she sang "Space Cowboy" with 'N Sync on their 2000 album, No Strings Attached. In September 2000, she co-hosted the MOBO Awards in the UK alongside Trevor Nelson,[tpl]cite news|title='Shock' at Lisa Lopes death|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1953032.stm|accessdate=February 8, 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=April 26, 2002[/tpl] where she also performed "U Know What's Up" with Donnell Jones. Lopes also collaborated on "Gimme Some" by Toni Braxton from her 2000 album The Heat. In 2001, she appeared in two commercials for Gap Inc.. rappers, and rock bands competed against each other and were judged. The show's winner, which ended up being a male-female rap duo, was promised a record deal and funding to produce a music video, which would then enter MTV's heavy rotation. A then-unknown Anastacia finished in third place, but ended up securing a record deal after Lopes and the show's three judges were impressed by her performance. About nine months before her death, Lopes appeared on the singers' edition of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire along with Joey McIntyre, Tyrese, Nick Lachey, and Lee Ann Womack.[tpl]cite news|title=Who Knows?|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20134982,00.html|accessdate=February 8, 2014|newspaper=People|date=July 30, 2001[/tpl] She dropped from a $125,000 question and won $32,000 for charity. A year later, in 2002, the episode of her drop was shown and was dedicated to her.
Lopes created "Left Eye Productions" to discover new talent. She helped the R&B trio Blaque secure a record deal with Columbia Records. Their self-titled debut album was executive-produced by Lopes, who also made a cameo appearance on the album and in their music video "I Do". Lopes was also developing another new band called Ejypt. They worked on her second album under her new nickname, N.I.N.A, meaning New Identity Not Applicable.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,234794,00.html|title=Waterfalls of Tears|work=Entertainment Weekly|last=Cruz|first=Clarissa|last2=Sinclair|first2=Tom|date=May 2, 2002|accessdate=July 24, 2008[/tpl]

====Supernova====

Lopes spent much of her free time after the conclusion of TLC's first headlining tour supporting Fanmail recording her debut solo album, Supernova. It includes a song titled "A New Star is Born", which is dedicated to her late father. She told MTV News:
Other tracks covered personal issues, including her relationship with NFL football player Andre Rison. In 1994, Lopes infamously burned down Rison's Atlanta mansion, resulting in the loss of all his possessions. Among the album's twelve tracks was also a posthumous duet with Tupac Shakur that was assembled from the large cache of unreleased recordings done prior to his murder in 1996. Initially scheduled for release on a date to coincide with the tenth anniversary of her father's death, Arista Records decided to delay, then cancel the American release.[tpl]cite news|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|title=Suge Knight Plans To Release Left Eye's 'N.I.N.A.'

====N.I.N.A.====

After numerous talks with Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight, Lopes severed her solo deal with Arista (despite remaining signed to the label as a member of TLC) and signed with Knight's Tha Row Records,[tpl]cite news|first=Corey|last=Moss|first2=Tina|last2=Johnson|title=Left Eye Signs With Suge Knight's Tha Row|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451634/left-eye-signs-with-suge-knight.jhtml|accessdate=8 March 2014|newspaper=MTV News|date=Jan 3, 2002[/tpl] intending to record a second solo album under the pseudonym "N.I.N.A."

She was recording with David Bowie for the project,[tpl]cite news|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|last2=Vineyard|first2=Jennifer|title=Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes Killed In Car Accident|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1453611/lisa-left-eye-lopes-killed-car-accident.jhtml|accessdate=8 March 2014|newspaper=MTV News|date=Apr 26, 2002[/tpl] who she was also trying to get involved with the fourth TLC album. The project was also to include several songs recorded by and with Ray J along with close friend Missy Elliott.[tpl]cite news|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|title=Kurupt Hits Big Screen, Talks Lisa Lopes Album, Tha Row|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458608/kurupt-talks-lisa-lopes-release.jhtml|work=MTV|date=November 11, 2002|accessdate=June 26, 2013[/tpl] The album was never released after Lopes' death in April 2002. In 2011, the album was released as a download-only album featuring artists from Tha Row Records. The unreleased song, "Left Pimpin", was sampled for the song "Quickie", which is featured on TLC's fourth album, 3D.

===Eye Legacy, Forever... The EP and "Fantasies"===

In 2008, Lopes' family decided to work with producers at Surefire Music Group to create a posthumous album in her honor, Eye Legacy. Originally set to be released October 28, 2008, the release date was pushed back to November 11, then to January 27, 2009. The song "Crank It", which features Lopes's sister Reigndrop, was released as a promotional single. The first official single from the album, "Let's Just Do It", was released on January 13, 2009 and features Missy Elliott and TLC. The second official single, "Block Party", features Lil Mama and Clyde McKnight. The album largely consists of reworked versions of tracks from the Supernova album. In November 2009, Forever... The EP was released which contained international bonus tracks not used on the Eye Legacy album. The EP was only available to download. An unreleased track featuring Lopes was uploaded to SoundCloud on the eve of the 10-year anniversary of her death by Block Starz Music.https://soundcloud.com/blockstarztv/blockstarz-tv-bootleg-of-the?utm_source=soundcloud&utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=facebook A portion of the proceeds from the song "Fantasies", which features rapper Bootleg of The Dayton Family, will go to the Lisa Lopes Foundation.

==Personal Life==

Lopes was often vocal about her personal life and difficult past. She readily admitted that she had come from an abusive, alcoholic background and struggled with alcohol problems herself. These problems became headline news in 1994, when she set fire to Andre Rison's tennis shoes in a bathtub, which ultimately spread to the mansion they shared, destroying it. Lopes claimed that Rison had beaten her after a night out, and she set fire to his shoes to get back at him. However, she said burning down the house was an accident. Lopes later revealed that she did not have a lot of freedom within the relationship and was abused mentally and physically, having released all her frustrations on the night of the fire.[tpl]cite news|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|title=Lisa Lopes Documentary Captures Singer's Last Days|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1558031/lisa-lopes-film-captures-her-last-days.jhtml|accessdate=February 8, 2014|newspaper=MTV|date=April 25, 2007[/tpl]
Lopes, who was sentenced to five years probation and therapy at a halfway house, was never able to shake the incident from her reputation. Her relationship with Rison continued to make headlines, with rumors of an imminent wedding, later debunked by People magazine.[tpl]cite news|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.|title=Whither 'Left Eye' Lopes and Rison?|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,622182,00.html|accessdate=February 8, 2014|newspaper=People|date=June 7, 2001[/tpl] Lopes revealed on The Last Days of Left Eye documentary that her meeting with a struggling mother in rehab left a big impression on her. She subsequently adopted the woman's 8-year-old daughter. Ten years previously, she had adopted a 12-year-old boy (Jamal of the group Illegal).TLC time for Lisa Lopes Tour Dates. Retrieved April 29, 2009.
Lopes had several large tattoos. Most prominent was a large eagle on her left arm, which she said represented freedom. Later, she added the number "80" around the eagle, which was Rison's NFL number while in Atlanta.Interview with The Independent[tpl]dead link|date=November 2010[/tpl] She also had a tattoo of a moon with a face on her foot in reference to Rison's nickname, Bad Moon. On her upper right arm was a large tattoo of the name Parron, for her late step brother who died in a boating accident, arching over a large tattoo of a pierced heart. Her smallest tattoo was on her left ear and consisted of an arrow pointing to her left over the symbol of an eye, a reference to her nickname.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vanishingtattoo.com/tattoo/celeb-lopes.htm |title=entry |publisher=Vanishingtattoo.com |date=July 4, 2007 |accessdate=November 12, 2010[/tpl]
Roughly two weeks before her own death, Lopes was involved in a traffic accident that resulted in the death of a ten-year-old Honduran boy. As reported in Philadelphia Weekly, "It is commonplace for people to walk the roads that wind through Honduras, and it's often difficult to see pedestrians."[tpl]cite news|last=Jones|first=Solomon|title=Over the Waterfall|url=http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/news-and-opinion/cover-story/over_the_waterfall-38359394.html|accessdate=February 8, 2014|newspaper=Philadelphia Weekly|pages=1–2|date=August 14, 2002[/tpl] The boy, Bayron Isaul Fuentes Lopez, was following behind his brothers and sisters when he stepped off the median strip and was struck by the van driven by Lopes' personal assistant. Lopes' party stopped and loaded the boy into the car, and the Philadelphia Weekly goes on to explain that "Lisa cradled the dying boy's bleeding head in her arms" while "Someone gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as they rushed him to a nearby hospital." Lopez died the next day and Lopes paid approximately US$3,700 for his medical expenses and funeral, and later compensated the family around US$925 for their loss, although it was apparently agreed upon by the authorities and the boy's family that his death was an "unforeseeable tragedy", and no blame was placed on Lopes or the driver of the van. In the documentary The Last Days of Left Eye, Lopes is shown in a local funeral home choosing a casket for the child. Earlier in the documentary, Lopes mentioned that she felt the presence of a "spirit" following her, and was struck by the fact that the child killed in the accident shared her last name, even thinking that the spirit may have made a mistake by taking his life instead of hers.

===Charity===

Lopes started the Lisa Lopes Foundation, a charitable group dedicated to providing neglected and abandoned youth with the resources necessary to increase their quality of life. Her spiritual motto is the one that she used for her foundation: "Energy never dies...It just transforms." Her foundation went into various underdeveloped villages and gave away brand new clothes to needy children and their families. In 2012, the Foundation began hosting an annual music festival, known as "Left Eye Music Fest", in Decatur, Georgia.

==Death==

On April 25, 2002, in La Ceiba, Honduras, while driving a rented Mitsubishi Montero Sport around a bend in the road, Lopes swerved to the right slightly then again to the left as she tried to avoid a collision with another vehicle that was in her lane ahead of her (it's not clear as to the direction of travel of the other vehicle at the time of the accident). The vehicle rolled several times after hitting two trees, throwing Lopes and three others out of the windows. She died of neck injuries and severe head trauma, and was the only person fatally injured in the accident. Raina Lopes, in the front passenger seat, was videotaping at the time, so the last seconds leading up to the swerve that resulted in the fatal accident were recorded on video. In the video, Lisa appears not to be wearing a seatbelt.
Her funeral was held at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Lithonia, Georgia on May 2, 2002.[tpl]cite news|last=Susman|first=Gary|title=Bad Car-ma|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,234414,00.html|accessdate=February 8, 2014|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date=April 30, 2002[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Thousands Gather to Say Goodbye to Left Eye|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1453735/thousands-gather-left-eye-funeral.jhtml|accessdate=February 8, 2014|newspaper=MTV|date=May 2, 2002[/tpl] Thousands of people attended her funeral.[tpl]cite news|title=Thousands mourn 'Left Eye'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1964559.stm|accessdate=February 8, 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=May 3, 2002[/tpl] Engraved upon her casket were the lyrics to her portion of "Waterfalls": "Dreams are hopeless aspirations, in hopes of coming true, believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you."

In a statement to MTV, producer Jermaine Dupri remembered Lopes:
 She was determined to be something in life. She was a true Hip-Hop star. She cared about some press. She was the star out of the group. She was the one who would curse on TV. She had the tattoos. You could not expect the expected. When you see Lisa, you could expect something from her. That is the gift she carried.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1453634/chilli-t-boz-remember-tlcs-left-eye.jhtml|title=Chilli, T-Boz, Jermaine Dupri Remember TLC's Left Eye|work=MTV|date=April 26, 2002|accessdate=August 25, 2013[/tpl] 
Controversy over leaked autopsy photos led to a protest by NASCAR star Dale Earnhardt, Jr. In response, Earnhardt, Jr. and his DEI teammates Michael Waltrip and Steve Park painted a single black stripe next to the left headlight decals of their Chevrolet Monte Carlos for the Pontiac Excitement 400 at Richmond International Raceway to protest about the display of her autopsy photos.[tpl]cite news|last=Kurz Jr.|first=Hank|title=Earnhardt teams to honor Lopes at Richmond|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/motor/nascar/2002-05-03-earnhardt-lopes.htm|accessdate=February 8, 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=May 3, 2002|agency=Associated Press[tpl]![/tpl]AP[/tpl] A similar controversy had befallen Earnhardt, Jr. himself after his father's death in the Daytona 500 a year earlier.
A documentary showing the final 27 days of Lopes's life, titled The Last Days of Left Eye, premiered at the Atlanta Film Festival in April 2007, for an audience that included many of Lopes's contemporaries, including Monica, Ronnie DeVoe, 112, Big Boi, India.Arie, and CeeLo Green.[tpl]cite news|title="Last Days of Left Eye" and "Fay Grim" Bookend 31st Atlanta Film Fest|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/last_days_of_left_eye_and_fay_grim_bookend_31st_atlanta_film_fest|accessdate=February 8, 2014|newspaper=Indiewire|date=April 18, 2007[/tpl] VH1 and VH1 Soul broadcast the documentary on May 19, 2007.
