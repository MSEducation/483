Many critics reviewed the album, Pitchfork Media quotes "The Richard D.

James pitchfork review |accessdate=2008-10-28[/tpl] A review by the Chicago Sun-Times Jim DeRogatis said of the album: "James has turned inward for inspiration, painting aural pictures of real and imagined scenes from his West Country childhood." Jason Fine of Rolling Stone commented on the album as "combining jolting beats, pristine melodic fragments and random noises into elegant – if at times unnerving – futuristic pop". He also commented "Not all of Richard D. James goes down easy", explaining that there is "menace lurking beneath the jerking beat of "Peek 824545201"."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/244895/review/5942562 |title=Richard D.

==Track information==

Tracks from the original Warp Records release:

===Track listing===

The American, Canadian, and Australian versions of this album contain the following five extra tracks that had previously been released in the UK as the b-sides of the Girl/Boy EP.

===Song titles===

"Carn Marth" is frequently, albeit incorrectly, referred to as "Corn Mouth", mainly due to James' poor handwriting. The track is named after a hill in Cornwall, in the United Kingdom. Logan Rock is also a famous rock located in Cornwall, and is sometimes misspelt (due to the writing on the back) as "Logl/Rock Witch" or "Logon Rock Witch". Goon Gumpas is a village located near Redruth. The tracks "INKEY$" and "Peek 824545201" are named after keywords in the Spectrum's Sinclair BASIC programming language.
