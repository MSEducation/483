Michel Drucker, CQ (born 12 September 1942 in Vire) is a popular French journalist and TV host. He has been on screen for so long and so permanently (in various shows and on different networks, both public and private), that he once said that some people consider that he was included in the price of their TV sets.
Jacques Drucker, a doctor, is Michel's younger brother, and Jean Drucker, a TV top executive, is Michel's older brother. He started a journalistic career in 1965 at the ORTF as sports reporter and commentator. Although he kept doing live coverage of major soccer matches until 1986, he soon turned to hosting variety shows. He is known for his polite and toned-down attitude towards show-business stars, and best-known outside France for the incident between Serge Gainsbourg and megastar Whitney Houston in the Champs-Élysées TV show.Ina : Rencontre mémorable entre Whitney Houston et Serge Gainsbourg
He is married to the French actress Dany Saval and is an uncle of Léa Drucker, an actress, and Marie Drucker, a TV journalist on France 2.
He is noted for having helped many Quebecois singers get discovered in Europe. His current show is Vivement Dimanche, every Sunday afternoon on France 2 and TV5 Monde.
