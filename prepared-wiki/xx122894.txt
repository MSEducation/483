{{Quote|
"May I offer my most sincere apologies for my inappropriate and unprofessional behaviour at the end of our match with Bradford City on Tuesday evening. My actions were wholly unacceptable and inexcusable and it is something I deeply regret. I have been hurting since Tuesday when in reality I should have been proud of another great victory, I am deeply ashamed of what happened.
My behaviour at Bradford City was not only out of character but totally unacceptable. I am ashamed of my conduct and I would like to place on record my apologies to everyone at Crawley Town Football Club and especially our supporters who should never have had to watch such actions from a player at their club. I would also like to offer my sincerest apologies to my family who watched me behave in such a way. I accept I will be disciplined by the football club and the Football Association and I can only trust that my previous excellent disciplinary record is taken into consideration. I am proud to be a player at Crawley Town Football Club and can assure everyone that no such offence will ever happen again
