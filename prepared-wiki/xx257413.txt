==Resolution==

===Observations===

In the preamble of the resolution, the Council welcomed progress made by the Liberian government in rebuilding the country since January 2006. It noted decisions not to extend sanctions relating to timber and diamonds described in Resolution 1521 (2003). Despite progress, the Council regarded the situation in Liberia as a threat to peace and security in the region. The United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) had to continue to improve security throughout Liberia.

===Acts===

Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, travel restrictions and an arms embargo were extended for an additional twelve months. Financial sanctions imposed in 2004 were to remain in force, given the lack of progress in implementing financial measures. The Council declared that if conditions were met then the sanctions would be reviewed, which included the freezing of former President Charles Taylor's assets.[tpl]cite news|title=Liberia: UN demands Government take action to freeze former warlordâ€™s assets|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37107&Cr=&Cr1=|date=December 17, 2010|agency=United Nations News Centre[/tpl] 
Finally, the mandate of an expert panel monitoring the sanctions was extended for a year until December 16, 2011.
