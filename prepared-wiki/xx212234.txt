[[Puerto Rico Highway 167]]

CATEGORIES: Highways in Puerto Rico

Puerto Rico Highway 167 is one of the main highways in the San Juan–Caguas–Guaynabo metropolitan area of Puerto Rico. This Highway starts at Puerto Rico Highway 165 in Levittown and goes until Puerto Rico Highway 156 in Comerío. It is two-lane per direction all through Cataño and a vast area of Bayamón, and becomes rural a couple of kilometers before entering through Naranjito. During the rainy season this road is risky as there is chance of rock fall and debris onto the road. This happens mainly due to increase in moisture content in the soil, which loosens the suspending rocks adjacent to the highway. It is proposed to make this road fully parallel to the future tollway PR-5, which will be extended until Comerío. The future tollway will pass through the only cable-suspended bridge in the island in Bayamón near the border with Naranjito.
