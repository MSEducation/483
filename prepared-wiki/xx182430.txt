He signed a one-year contract with Gambrinus liga club FK SIAD Most (known as FK Baník Most from 2008 onwards) in August 2007, with an option of an extension until 2010. He made his debut in a 5–2 defeat against Baník Ostrava on 11 August 2007. The 2007–08 concluded with Most suffering relegation to the Czech 2.

The club entered negotiations over a deal for Webster to sign on loan for the rest of the 2008–09 season.

Webster had a trial with Bury in July 2009, before leaving to trial with Doncaster Rovers. He gave a "composed performance" in a pre-season friendly against Wolverhampton Wanderers and Doncaster manager Sean O'Driscoll was looking to complete a deal for him to sign for the club. He eventually signed for the Championship club on an initial two-year contract for an undisclosed fee on 5 August 2009. Webster made his Doncaster debut in a 1–0 victory away to Notts County in the League Cup first round on 11 August 2009.

On 4 July 2012, Webster's contract with Northampton Town was terminated by mutual consent and later that day signed for League One side Yeovil Town on a two-year contract. He scored his first goal for Yeovil in 2–1 victory over Bury, after an attempted clearance from a corner struck him, sending it into the goal. Webster played in the 2–1 victory over Brentford in the 2013 Football League One play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 19 May 2013, seeing Yeovil win promotion to the Championship for the first time in their history.
