[[North American English]]

CATEGORIES: English language, North American English

North American English (NAmE, NAE) is the variety of the English language of North America, including that of the United States and Canada. Because of their shared histories[tpl]cite book|last=Chambers|first=J.K.|title=The Canadian Oxford Dictionary|year=1998|edition=2nd|page=xi|chapter=Canadian English: 250 Years in the Making[/tpl] and the similarities between the pronunciation, vocabulary and accent of American English and Canadian English, the two spoken dialects are often grouped together under a single category.[tpl]cite book|last=Labov, William; Ash, Sharon; Boberg, Charles|title=Atlas of North American English: Phonetics, Phonology and Sound Change|year=2006|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin/New York|isbn=3-11-016746-8[/tpl]Trudgill, Peter & Jean Hannah.

Due to historical and cultural factors, Canadian English and American English retain numerous distinctions from each other, with the differences being most noticeable in the two languages' written forms. Canadian spellings are primarily based on British usage as a result of Canada's long-standing connections with the United Kingdom. Canadians are generally tolerant of both British and US spellings, with British spellings being favoured in more formal settings and in Canadian print media.Patti Tasko. (2004).  The Canadian Press Stylebook:  A Guide for Writers and Editors, 13th.  Toronto:  The Canadian Press.  ISBN 0-920009-32-8, p. 308.   Spellings in American English have been highly influenced by lexicographers like Noah Webster, who sought to create a standardized form of English that was independent of British English."Noah Webster's Spelling Reform," (2011) Merriam-Webster Online, http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/spelling-reform.htm .   Despite these differences, English as it is spoken in both Canada and the United States is similar, with the United Empire Loyalists who fled the American Revolution having had a large influence on the early spoken form of Canadian English.

Some terms in North American English are used almost exclusively in Canada and the United States (for example, the terms diaper and gasoline are widely used instead of nappy and petrol). Although many English speakers from outside North America regard such terms as distinct Americanisms, they are often just as ubiquitous in Canada, mainly due to the effects of heavy cross-border trade and cultural penetration by the American mass media.

There are a considerable number of different accents within the regions of both the United States and Canada, originally deriving from the accents prevalent in different English, Scottish and Irish regions and corresponding to settlement patterns of these peoples in the colonies. These were developed and built upon as new waves of immigration, and migration across the North American continent, brought new accents and dialects to new areas, and as these ways of speaking merged and assimilated with the population. It is claimed that despite the centuries of linguistic changes there is still a resemblance between the English East Anglia accents which would have been used by early English settlers in New England (including the Pilgrims), and modern Northeastern United States accents.
