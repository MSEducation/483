The Pincheira brothers (Spanish: Hermanos Pincheira) was an infamous royalist outlaw group in Chile and Argentina active from 1818 to 1832. The gang fought initially in the Chilean War of Independence as royalist guerrillas during the Guerra a muerte phase. After Vicente Benavides was executed and the royalist resistance collapsed they eventually became isolated as the only remaining royalist group in mainland Chile. Later they specialized on cattle raiding and robbery. With the surrender of Spanish controlled Chiloé Archipelago in 1826 they became the last remants of royalist resistance in South America. The Pincheira brothers formed an alliance with the Boroanos tribe that had settle in Salinas Grandes and Sierra de la Ventana and attacked with them Carmen de Patagones and Fortaleza Protectora Argentina. In 1832 the Chilean general Manuel Bulnes crossed the Andes and defeated the Pincheira brothers in the battle of Epulafquén.
