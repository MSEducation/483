==Early life and career==

Arad was born in Israel, to refugees from Poland, during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. He spent his childhood in Israel, and grew up on Superman and Spider-Man comics translated into Hebrew. In 1965, he was conscripted into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). He fought in and was wounded in the 1967 Six-Day War, and spent 15 days recuperating. Arad finished his military service in 1968.[tpl]cite news|last=Bowles|first=Scott|title=Marvel's chief: A force outside, 'a kid inside'|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2003-06-05-marvel_x.htm|newspaper=USA Today|date=6/5/2003[/tpl]
In 1970, Arad moved to the United States and enrolled at Hofstra University to study industrial management. He worked as a truck driver and Hebrew teacher to put himself through college, and graduated with a BBA in 1972.Hofstra University: Frank G. Zarb School of Business - Faces of Success: Avi Arad '72

==Marvel Comics==

Along with Toy Biz co-owner Isaac Perlmutter, Avi Arad came into conflict with Carl Icahn and Ron Perelman over control of Marvel Comics in the wake of its 1996 bankruptcy. In the end, Arad and Perlmutter came out on top, with Toy Biz taking over Marvel Comics in a complicated deal that included obtaining the rights to Spider-Man and other superheroes that Marvel had sold earlier. He was involved in Marvel's emergence from bankruptcy and the expansion of the company's profile through licensing and movies.
