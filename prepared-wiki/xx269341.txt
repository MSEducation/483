Oreste Piro is a dynamical systems theorist and biophysicist. He is at the Universitat de les Illes Balears (UIB) in Palma de Mallorca.
Piro is known for work including his studies of forced relaxation oscillators such as the exactly-solvable PiroGon oscillator,Diego L. Gonzalez and Oreste Piro, "Chaos in a Nonlinear Driven Oscillator with Exact Solution", Phys. Rev. Lett. 50, 870–872 (1983). the dynamics of passive scalars in fluid flows,Mario Feingold, Leo P.
