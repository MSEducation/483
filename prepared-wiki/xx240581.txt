Mafra is a town in Mafra Municipality in Portugal.
The town (2002 pop. 11,080) is 28 km north-west from the center of Lisbon. It is mostly known for the sumptuous Palácio de Mafra (Mafra Palace), which also makes it a popular tourist destination in the Lisbon area. Built in the baroque style, the Mafra National Palace also inspired Portuguese Nobel Prize laureate José Saramago to write his novel Baltasar and Blimunda (Memorial do Convento). Other points of interest around the city include the Tapada Nacional de Mafra, an enclosed wildlife and game reserve. 
The town of Maffra in Victoria, Australia, was named after Mafra.
