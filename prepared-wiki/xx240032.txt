Mirabilis alipes is a species of flowering plant in the four o'clock family known by the common name winged four o'clock. It is native to the southwestern United States from eastern California to western Colorado, where it grows in brush, woodland, and dry mountain slope habitat. It is a perennial herb growing in a clump near 40 centimeters tall and up to 80 centimeters wide. The leaves are oppositely arranged on the spreading stem branches. Each fleshy leaf has an oval or rounded blade up to 7 or 9 centimeters long and is hairless or sparsely hairy. The flowers occur in leaf axils on the upper branches. Five to nine flowers bloom from a cup-shaped involucre of several partly fused bracts. Each five-lobed flower is about 1.5 centimeters wide and magenta in color; cream-colored flowers are also known.
