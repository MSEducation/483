Grande Baroque is a sterling silver tableware pattern.

==Design==

Grande Baroque was designed by William S. Warren in 1941, – in his words – “To reflect the very essence of merriment and adventure, of artistic progress.” 
William S. Warren spent four years developing this pattern.
The Grande Baroque pattern was part four, of a six part pattern release,released from 1934–1950, by Wallace Silversmiths, called the “Third Dimension Beauty collection” all of them designed by William S. Warren. These patterns are called “three Dimension” because the design of these patterns, are apparent from the front, back, or profile.
Grand Baroque also was one of the five patterns, profiled in the book "Wallace Beauty Moods in Silver" written by William S. Warren in 1947, to discuss five of the six "Three Dimension" designs.
The design crowned by the acanthus leaf (acanthus leaf), includes classic symbols of the Renaissance period, five petaled flowers on the spoons, a narcissus on the forks, and a rose on the knives.

==Production==

The Grande Baroque flatware is produced by Wallace Silversmiths.
Originally conceived as only a flatware pattern, hollow ware was soon added to the line. As the demand for this pattern increased, a Golden Grand Baroque was introduced. 
Besides the traditional place settings in lunch, dinner, and Continental size, there are now over a hundred flatware pieces in this pattern.
