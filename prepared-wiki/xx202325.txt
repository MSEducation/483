Penguin Bank is the name given to a now-submerged shield volcano of the Hawaiian Islands.  Its coral-capped remains lie immediately west of the island of Moloka[tpl]okina[/tpl]i under relatively shallow water (see bathymetric map at right). Penguin Bank was one of the seven principal volcanoes (along with West Moloka[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, East Moloka[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, Lāna[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, West Maui, East Maui and Kaho[tpl]okina[/tpl]olawe) that formerly constituted the island of Maui Nui. The volcano is part of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain. The last eruption is unknown.
Plans to build wind turbines in Penguin Bank were called off in April 2009.[tpl]cite news |last=Perez |first=Rob|title=Penguin Bank project called off |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2009/Apr/21/ln/hawaii904210353.html |accessdate=26 October 2012|newspaper=The Honolulu Advertiser|date=21 April 2009[/tpl]
