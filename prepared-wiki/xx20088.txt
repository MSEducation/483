They are typified as free-swimming marine animals consisting of a gelatinous umbrella-shaped bell and trailing tentacles. The bell can pulsate for locomotion, while stinging tentacles can be used to capture prey. 
Jellyfish are found in every ocean, from the surface to the deep sea. A few jellyfish inhabit freshwater. Large, often colorful, jellyfish are common in coastal zones worldwide. Jellyfish have roamed the seas for at least 500 million years,Fossil Record Reveals Elusive Jellyfish More Than 500 Million Years Old. ScienceDaily (2007-11-02). and possibly 700 million years or more, making them the oldest multi-organ animal.[tpl]cite news|last=ANGIER|first=NATALIE|title=So Much More Than Plasma and Poison|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/07/science/07jellyfish.html?_r=1|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 6, 2011[/tpl]

==Terminology==

The English popular name jellyfish has been in use since 1796. It has traditionally also been applied to other animals sharing a superficial resemblance, for example ctenophores (members from another phylum of common, gelatinous and generally transparent or translucent, free-swimming planktonic carnivores now known as comb jellies) were included as "jellyfishes".[tpl]Cite book|last=Kelman|first=Janet Harvey|coauthors=Rev. Theodore Wood|title=The Sea-Shore, Shown to the Children|publisher=T. C. & E. C.  Jack|location=London|year=1910|page=146|url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL7043926M/The_sea-shore[/tpl] Even some scientists include the phylum ctenophora when they are referring to jellyfish. Other scientists prefer to use the more all-encompassing term gelatinous zooplankton, when referring to these, together with other soft-bodied animals in the water column.
As jellyfish are not vertebrates, let alone true fish, the word jellyfish is considered by some to be a misnomer. Public aquariums may use the terms jellies or sea jellies instead.Flower Hat Jelly, New York Aquarium. Indeed, it may be said that the term "jellies" has become more popular than "jellyfish".Van Patten, Peg. "Sting". (2004). Wrack Lines. Paper 11. In scientific literature, "jelly" and "jellyfish" are often used interchangeably.See, e.g., Brotz, Lucas. Changing Jellyfish Populations: Trends in Large Marine Ecosystems. 2011. p.1. Some sources may use the term "jelly" to refer to organisms in this taxon, as "jellyfish" may be considered inappropriate.[tpl]cite book|last=Coulombe|first=Deborah A.|title=Seaside Naturalist: A Guide to Study at the Seashore|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VOoqKMdI0ekC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA60#v=onepage|publisher=Simon & Schuster|accessdate=20 March 2013|page=60|date=14 February 1990|isbn=9780671765033[/tpl]
Many textbooks and sources refer to only scyphozoa as "true jellyfish".[tpl]cite web|url=http://animals.about.com/od/cnidarians/a/tenfactsjellyfi.htm|title=Ten Facts about Jellyfish|last=Klappenbach|first=Laura|accessdate=24 January 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://qanda.encyclopedia.com/question/some-determining-characteristics-jellyfish-class-scyphozoa-97854.html|title=What are some determining characteristics of jellyfish in the class, Scyphozoa?|accessdate=24 January 2010[/tpl]
A group of jellyfish is sometimes called a bloom or a swarm. "Bloom" is usually used for a large group of jellyfish that gather in a small area, but may also have a time component, referring to seasonal increases, or numbers beyond what was expected.
Another collective name for a group of jellyfish is a smack,"Smack: a smattering; a taste; a small quantity. Examples: smack of jellyfish – Lipton, 1970; of knowledge; of my muse, 1766; ..." from The Free Dictionary. For more detail see An exaltation of larks by James Lipton. although this term is not commonly used by scientists who study jellyfish. Jellyfish are "bloomy" by nature of their life cycles, being produced by their benthic polyps usually in the spring when sunshine and plankton increase, so they appear rather suddenly and often in large numbers, even when an ecosystem is in balance.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1011888006302 | last1 = Mills | first1 = C.E. | year = 2001 | title = Jellyfish blooms: are populations increasing globally in response to changing ocean conditions? | url = http://faculty.washington.edu/cemills/jellyblooms2001.pdf | journal = Hydrobiologia | volume = 451 | issue = | pages = 55–68 [/tpl] Using "swarm" usually implies some kind of active ability to stay together, which a few species such as Aurelia, the moon jelly, demonstrate.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Hamner|first=W.

Medusa jellyfish may be classified as scyphomedusae ("true" jellyfish), stauromedusae (stalked jellyfish), cubomedusae (box jellyfish), or hydromedusae, according to which clade their species belongs.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HzFiQFFQYw&feature=channel_video_title |title=There's no such thing as a jellyfish‏ |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2011-07-05[/tpl]
The term medusa was coined by Linnaeus in 1752, alluding to the tentacled head of Medusa in Greek mythology.jellyfish. Online Etymology Dictionary. Etymonline.com. Retrieved on 2013-01-10. This term refers exclusively to the non-polyp life-stage which occurs in many cnidarians, which is typified by a large pulsating gelatinous bell with long trailing tentacles. All medusa-producing species belong to the sub-phylum Medusozoa.
In biology, a medusa (plural: medusae) is a form of cnidarian in which the body is shaped like an umbrella, in contrast with polyps. Medusae vary from bell-shaped to the shape of a thin disk, scarcely convex above and only slightly concave below. The upper or aboral surface is called the exumbrella and the lower surface is called the subumbrella; the mouth is located on the lower surface, which may be partially closed by a membrane extending inward from the margin (called the velum). The digestive cavity consists of the gastrovascular cavity and radiating canals which extend toward the margin; these canals may be simple or branching, and vary in number from few to many. The margin of the disk bears sensory organs and tentacles as its said.
German biologist Ernst Haeckel popularized medusae through his vivid illustrations, particularly in Kunstformen der Natur.

==Anatomy==

Most jellyfish do not have specialized digestive, osmoregulatory, central nervous, respiratory, or circulatory systems. The manubrium is a stalk-like structure hanging down from the centre of the underside, with the mouth at its tip. This opens into the gastrovascular cavity, where digestion takes place and nutrients are absorbed. It is joined to the radial canals which extend to the margin of the bell.Medusa Encyclopedia Britannica. Retrieved 2011-12-08. Jellyfish do not need a respiratory system since their skin is thin enough that the body is oxygenated by diffusion. They have limited control over movement, but can use their hydrostatic skeleton to navigate through contraction-pulsations of the bell-like body; some species actively swim most of the time, while others are mostly passive.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl] Depending on the species, the body contains between 95 and 98% water.Hsieh, Yun-Hwa and Rudloe, Jack (1994) "Potential of utilizing jellyfish as food in Western countries" Trends in Food Science & Technology, 5 (7): 225–229. [tpl]doi|10.1016/0924-2244(94)90253-4[/tpl] Most of the umbrella mass is a gelatinous material — the jelly — called mesoglea which is surrounded by two layers of protective skin. The top layer is called the epidermis, and the inner layer is referred to as gastrodermis, which lines the gut.

===Nervous system===

Jellyfish employ a loose network of nerves, located in the epidermis, which is called a "nerve net".Satterlie RA (2002) "Neuronal control of swimming in jellyfish: a comparative story", Canadian Journal of Zoology, 80: 1654–1669. [tpl]doi|10.1139/z02-138[/tpl] Although traditionally thought not to have a central nervous system, nerve net concentration and ganglion-like structures could be considered to constitute one in most species.[tpl]cite journal|last=Satterlie|first=Richard A.|title=Do jellyfish have central nervous systems?|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|date=April 2011|volume=214|pages=1215–1223|doi=10.1242/jeb.043687|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/214/8/1215.long|accessdate=7 May 2013|issue=8[/tpl] A jellyfish detects various stimuli including the touch of other animals via this nerve net, which then transmits impulses both throughout the nerve net and around a circular nerve ring, through the rhopalial lappet, located at the rim of the jellyfish body, to other nerve cells.
Some species explicitly adapt to tidal flux. In Roscoe Bay, jellyfish ride the current at ebb tide until they hit a gravel bar, and then descend below the current. They remain in still waters until the tide rises, ascending and allowing it to sweep them back into the bay. They also actively avoid fresh water from mountain snowmelt, diving until they find enough salt.

===Vision===

Some jellyfish have ocelli: light-sensitive organs that do not form images but which can detect light and are used to determine up from down, responding to sunlight shining on the water's surface. These are generally pigment spot ocelli, which have some cells (not all) pigmented.
Certain species of jellyfish, such as the box jellyfish, have been revealed to have more advanced vision than their counterparts. The box jellyfish has 24 eyes, two of which are capable of seeing color, and four parallel information processing areas or rhopalia that act in competition,[tpl]cite journal|author=Wehner R |year=2005|url=http://www.imls.uzh.ch/static/CMS_publications/wehner/literatur/pdf05/wehner200510.pdf |title=Sensory physiology: brainless eyes|doi=10.1038/435157a|journal=Nature|volume=435|issue=7039|pages=157–9|pmid=15889076[/tpl] supposedly making it one of the few creatures to have a 360-degree view of its environment.Multi-eyed jellyfish helps with Darwin's puzzle. Newscientist.com (2005-05-14). Retrieved on 2013-01-10.
The eyes are suspended on stalks with heavy crystals on one end, acting like a gyroscope to orient the eyes skyward. They look upward to navigate from roots in mangrove swamps to the open lagoon and back, watching for the mangrove canopy, where they feed.

===Size===

Jellyfish range from about one millimeter in bell height and diameter to nearly two meters in bell height and diameter; the tentacles and mouth parts usually extend beyond this bell dimension.
The smallest jellyfish are the peculiar creeping jellyfish in the genera Staurocladia and Eleutheria, which have bell disks from 0.5 mm to a few mm diameter, with short tentacles that extend out beyond this, on which these tiny jellyfish crawl around on seaweed or the bottoms of rocky pools.[tpl]cite book|last=Mills|first=C.E.|coauthors=Hirano, Y.M.|title==Encyclopedia of Tidepools and Rocky Shores: Hydromedusae|year=2007|pages=286–288|isbn=0520251180|publisher=University of California Press[/tpl] Many of these tiny creeping jellyfish cannot be seen in the field without a hand lens or microscope; they can reproduce asexually by splitting in half (called fission). Other very small jellyfish, which have bells about one mm, are the hydromedusae of many species that have just been released from their parent polyps;[tpl]cite journal|last=Mills|first=C.E.|title=Podocoryne selena, a new species of hydroid from the Gulf of Mexico, and a comparison with Hydractinia echinata|journal=Biological Bulletin|year=1976|volume=151|pages=214–224|doi=10.2307/1540715[/tpl] some of these live only a few minutes before shedding their gametes in the plankton and then dying, while others will grow in the plankton for weeks or months. The hydromedusae Cladonema radiatum and Cladonema californicum are also very small, living for months, yet never growing beyond a few mm in bell height and diameter.[tpl]cite journal|last=Costello|first=J.|title=Laboratory culture and feeding of the hydromedusa Cladonema californicum Hyman (Anthomedusa: Cladonemidae)|journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology|year=1988|volume=123|issue=2|pages=177–188|doi=10.1016/0022-0981(88)90168-2[/tpl] Another small species of jellyfish is the Australian Irukandji, which is about the size of a fingernail.
The lion's mane jellyfish, Cyanea capillata, was long-cited as the largest jellyfish, and arguably the longest animal in the world, with fine, thread-like tentacles that may extend up to [tpl]convert|36.5|m[/tpl] long (though most are nowhere near that large).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.waterford-today.ie/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=933&Itemid=10177&ed=68 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100530112100/http://www.waterford-today.ie/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=933&Itemid=10177&ed=68 |archivedate=2010-05-30 |title=Rare sighting of a lion’s mane jellyfish in Tramore Bay |publisher=Waterford Today |date= 2007-08-01|accessdate=2010-10-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/education/reference_library/cnidaria/lions_mane_jellyfish/4326/index.html |title=Lion’s Mane Jellyfish – Reference Library |publisher=redOrbit |accessdate=2010-10-18[/tpl] They have a moderately painful, but rarely fatal, sting. Claims that this jellyfish may be the longest animal in the world are likely exaggerated; some other planktonic cnidarians called siphonophores may typically be tens of meters long and seem a more legitimate candidate for longest animal.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]
The increasingly common giant Nomura's jellyfish, Nemopilema nomurai, found in some, but not all years in the waters of Japan, Korea and China in summer and autumn is probably a much better candidate for "largest jellyfish", since the largest Nomura's jellyfish in late autumn can reach [tpl]convert|200|cm[/tpl] in bell (body) diameter and about [tpl]convert|200|kg[/tpl] in weight, with average specimens frequently reaching [tpl]convert|90|cm[/tpl] in bell diameter and about [tpl]convert|150|kg[/tpl] in weight.[tpl]cite journal|last=Omori|first=Makoto|coauthors=Kitamura, Minoru|title=Taxonomic review of three Japanese species of edible jellyfish (Scyphozoa: Rhizostomeae)|journal=Plankton Biology and Ecology|year=2004|volume=51|issue=1|pages=36–51|url=http://www.plankton.jp/PBE/issue/vol51_1/vol51_1_036.pdf | format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Uye|first=Shin-Ichi|title=Blooms of the giant jellyﬁsh Nemopilema nomurai: a threat to the ﬁsheries sustainability of the East Asian Marginal Seas|url=http://www.plankton.jp/PBR/issue/vol03_suppl/03suppl_125.pdf|journal=Plankton & Benthos Research|year=2008|volume=3 (Supplement)|pages=125–131|doi=10.3800/pbr.3.125[/tpl] The large bell mass of the giant Nomura's jellyfish[tpl]cite news|title=Giant Echizen jellyfish off Japan coast|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8385953.stm|publisher=BBC | date=2009-11-30[/tpl] can dwarf a diver and is nearly always much greater than the up-to-[tpl]convert|100|cm[/tpl] bell diameter Lion's Mane.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kramp|first=P.L.|title=Synopsis of the medusae of the world|journal=Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom|year=1961|volume=40|pages=1–469[/tpl]
The rarely encountered deep-sea jellyfish Stygiomedusa gigantea is another solid candidate for "largest jellyfish", with its thick, massive bell up to [tpl]convert|100|cm[/tpl] wide, and four thick, "strap-like" oral arms extending up to [tpl]convert|6|m[/tpl] in length,[tpl]cite news|title=Giant deep sea jellyfish filmed in Gulf of Mexico|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8638000/8638527.stm|work=BBC Earth News | date=2010-04-23 | first=Jody | last=Bourton[/tpl] very different from the typical fine, threadlike tentacles that rim the umbrella of more-typical-looking jellyfish, including the Lion's Mane.

==Taxonomy==

Jellyfish belong to Medusozoa, the clade of cnidarians which excludes Anthozoa (e.g., corals and anemones). This suggests that the medusa form evolved after the polyps.Cnidaria, Tree of Life. A comprehensive morphological cladistic analysis by Schuchert (1993) supports the basal position of Anthozoa with the Scyphozoa and Cubozoa being more closely related to each other than to Hydrozoa. Morphological, mtDNA, and 18S rDNA data separately and together also support the basal position of Anthozoa but do not resolve the relationships among Scyphozoa, Cubozoa and Hydrozoa (Bridge et al. 1995).
The phylogenetics of this group are complex and evolving. The Medusozoa and Octocorallia are proposed as sister groups according to research published in 2012. That research also proposes coronate Scyphozoa and Cubozoa as a sister clade to Hydrozoa and discomedusan Scyphozoa, which are themselves sister groups. The hydroidolinans are a sister group to Limnomedusae, also called Trachylina. Semaeostomae is paraphyletic with Rhizostomeae. The class Storozoa was the earliest group of Medusozoa to diverge and the Limnomedusae were the earliest Hydrozoa to diverge.[tpl]cite doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0051465[/tpl]
The four major classes of medusozoan Cnidaria are:
Some other animals are frequently associated with or mistaken for medusa jellyfish.
There are over 200 species of Scyphozoa, about 50 species of Staurozoa, about 20 species of Cubozoa, and in Hydrozoa there are about 1000–1500 species that produce medusae (and many more hydrozoa species that do not).[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7410.2004.tb00139.x|last=Marques|first=A.C.|coauthors=A.

Many scientists who work on relationships between these groups are reluctant to assign ranks, although there is general agreement on the different groups, regardless of their absolute rank. Here is one scheme, which includes all groups that produce jellyfish, derived from several expert sources:

==Life history/behavior==

===Phases===

Jellyfish development occurs in multiple phases. Eggs and sperm develop into larval planulae, become polyps, bud into ephyrae and then transform into adult medusae. In some species, specimens may skip some phases.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-do-jellyfish-reproduc |title=How do jellyfish reproduce? What effect does their sting have on humans? What's the difference between red and translucent jellyfish? |publisher=Scientific American |date=2013-10-15 |accessdate=2013-10-22[/tpl]
The planula is a small larva covered with cilia. It settles onto a firm surface and develops into a polyp.
The polyp is generally a small stalk with a mouth that is ringed by upward-facing tentacles. The polyps resemble the closely related Cnidaria anthozoan (sea anemones and corals) polyps. The jellyfish polyp may be sessile, living on the bottom or on another substrate such as floats or boat hulls, or it may be free-floating or attached to tiny bits of free-living plankton[tpl]Cite journal|last=Mills|first=C.

Polyps may be solitary or colonial. Polyp colonies form by strobilation, in which multiple polyps share a common stomach cavity.Jellyfish – The Life Cycle of a Jellyfish. Animals.about.com. Retrieved on 2013-01-10. Most polyps are only millimeters in size. They feed continuously. The polyp stage may last for years.
The next stage is the ephyra, which is a free-swimming precursor of the final adult stage.
The ephyra then develops into a medusa. The medusa is the life stage that is typically identified as a jellyfish.

===Reproduction===

Jellyfish reproduce both sexually and asexually.

====Spawning====

Upon reaching adult size, jellyfish spawn daily given enough food. In most species, spawning is controlled by light, so the entire population spawns at about the same time of day, often at either dusk or dawn.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Mills|first=Claudia|year=1983|title=Vertical migration and diel activity patterns of hydromedusae: studies in a large tank|journal=Journal of Plankton Research|volume=5|pages=619–635|doi=10.1093/plankt/5.5.619|issue=5[/tpl] Jellyfish are usually either male or female (with occasional hermaphrodites). In most cases, adults release sperm and eggs into the surrounding water, where the (unprotected) eggs are fertilized and mature into new organisms.

====Budding====

After a growth interval, the polyp begins reproducing asexually by budding and, in the Scyphozoa, is called asegmenting polyp, or a scyphistoma. Budding produces more scyphistomae and also ephyrae. Budding sites vary by species; from the tentacle bulbs, the manubrium (above the mouth), or the gonads of hydromedusae.
Polyps asexually produce free-swimming ephyra, which then become a medusa. New specimens (usually only a millimeter or two across) swim away from the polyp and then grow.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]

====Other development paths====

A few species can produce new medusae by budding directly from the medusan stage. Some hydromedusae reproduce by fission (splitting in half). A few omit the planula, polyp and ephyra phases and produce new medusae directly from eggs.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
Some polyps can asexually produce a creeping frustule larval form, which then develops into another polyp.

===Brooding===

In a few species, the sperm swim into the female's mouth, fertilizing the eggs within her body, where they remain during early development stages. In moon jellies, the eggs lodge in pits on the oral arms, which form a temporary brood chamber for the developing planula larvae.

===Lifespan===

Jellyfish lifespans typically range from a few hours (in the case of some very small hydromedusae) to several months. Life generally ends after the medusa has begun spawning. Life span varies by species. Most large coastal jellyfish live 2 to 6 months, during which they grow from a millimeter or two to many centimeters in diameter.
Aquarium jellyfish that are carefully tended, fed daily even when food might be seasonally rare in the wild, and sometimes treated with antibiotics if they develop infections, may live several years, though this would be very unusual in the wild.
One unusual species is reported to live as long as 30 years.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl] Another unusual species, Turritopsis dohrnii, formerly classified as T. nutricula,[tpl]cite journal|last=Miglietta|first=M. P.|coauthors=S. Piraino, S. Kubota, P. Schuchert|year=2006|title=Species in the genus Turritopsis (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa): a molecular evaluation|journal=Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research|volume=45|issue=1|pages=11–19|year=2007|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0469.2006.00379.x[/tpl] might be effectively immortal because of its ability under certain circumstances to transform from medusa back to the polyp stage, thereby escaping the death that typically awaits medusae post-reproduction if they have not otherwise been eaten by some other ocean organism. So far this reversal has been observed only in the laboratory.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1543022 | last1 = Piraino | first1 = S. | last2 = Boero | year = 1996 | first2 = F. | last3 = Aeschbach | first3 = B. | last4 = Schmid | first4 = V. | title = Reversing the life cycle: medusae transforming into polyps and cell transdifferentiation in Turritopsis nutricula (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa) | jstor = 1543022| journal = Biological Bulletin | volume = 190 | issue = 3| pages = 302–312 [/tpl]

===Movement===

Jellyfish move through the water by radially expanding and contracting their bell-shaped bodies to push water behind them. They pause between the contraction and expansion to create a vortex that pushes them forward. The displaced water creates a “hole” that when re-filled, propels them forward. The vortex allows the animal to travel 30 percent farther on each stroke. Jellyfish achieved a 48 percent lower cost of transport (the amount of food and oxygen consumed, versus energy spent in movement) than other animals in similar studies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/jellyfish-energy-efficiency-to-improve-bio-inspired-robotic-designs-for-navy |title=Jellyfish energy efficiency to improve bio-inspired robotic designs for Navy |doi=10.1073/pnas.1306983110 |publisher=KurzweilAI |accessdate=2013-10-22[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1073/pnas.1306983110[/tpl]

==Ecology==

===Diet===

Jellies are carnivorous, feeding on plankton, crustaceans, fish eggs, small fish and other jellyfish, ingesting and voiding through the same hole in the middle of the bell. Jellies hunt passively using their tentacles as drift nets.

===Predation===

Other species of jellyfish are among the most common and important jellyfish predators, some of which specialize in jellies. Other predators include tuna, shark, swordfish, sea turtles, and at least one species of Pacific salmon. Sea birds sometimes pick symbiotic crustaceans from the jellyfish bells near the sea's surface, inevitably feeding also on the jellyfish hosts of these amphipods or young crabs and shrimp.
