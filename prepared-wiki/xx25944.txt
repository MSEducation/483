Each of these is an eclipse cycle.  Less accurate cycles may be constructed by combinations of these.

==Eclipse cycles==

This table summarizes the characteristics of various eclipse cycles, and can be computed from the numerical results of the preceding paragraphs; cf. Meeus (1997) Ch.9 .  More details are given in the comments below, and several notable cycles have their own pages.
Notes:
Any eclipse cycle, and indeed the interval between any two eclipses, can be expressed as a combination of saros and inex intervals.
