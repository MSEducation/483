==Biography==

Ed Garland was born in New Orleans January 9, 1895. By about 1910, he was playing bass drum with brass bands including Frankie Duson's Eagle Band. He then took up tuba and string bass; like many New Orleans bassists of the era, he doubled on the two instruments which filled similar roles in different types of bands. He played with the Excelsior Brass Band and Manuel Perez's Imperial Orchestra. He joined other early New Orleans bands that played in Chicago and California, playing with Lawrence Duhé, Joe "King" Oliver, and Freddie Keppard. In 1916 Garland joined King Oliver and went to California. He led his own One-Eleven Jazz Band during the Depression.Rose, Al, and Souchon, Edmond, New Orleans Jazz: A Family Album.
