[[Age Positive]]

CATEGORIES: Ageism

Age Positive is a propaganda campaign from the Department for Work and Pensions in the United Kingdom to promote compliance with age discrimination regulations on the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006.
It encourages employers to make decisions about recruitment, training and retention that do not discriminate against someone because of their age. Age Positive uses publications, research, press, events and awards initiatives to get the message across - and to help employers comply with legislation to outlaw age discrimination in employment.
Support is given to promote Good Practice standards, prepared by the Department for Work and Pensions, to help employers recognise the business benefits of an age-diverse workforce. 
This is voluntary guidance to encourage employers to make decisions that do not discriminate against someone because of how old they are. The information covers good practice in six areas of employment. Each section contains guidance and indicators of success.
As well as engaging with employers nationwide, Age Positive works closely with the Job Centre Plus network, the LEP (Local Employer Partnership) initiative and other initiative within the Department for Work and Pensions; it also liaises closely with other cross-government agencies, Sector Skills Agencies and professional organisations and institutes across sectors - Institute of Directors (IOD), Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD); Road Haulage Association, ACAS, Business Links, Chambers of Commerce, The Employers Forum on age (EFA) and the Age and Employment Network (TAEN) to name a few.
It also has 153 employers signed up to being Age Positive Employer Champions - employers who do not discriminate on the basis of age in their recruitment, retention and retirement policies.
