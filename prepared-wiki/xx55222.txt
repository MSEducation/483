At Powell and Market Streets and California and Market Streets, three types of rail gauges come within a few hundred feet of each other: Bay Area Rapid Transit's [tpl]RailGauge|5ft6in|allk=on[/tpl] broad gauge (which is underground in the lower level of the tunnels), Muni Metro's [tpl]RailGauge|sg[/tpl] (also underground in the upper level of the tunnels), and the San Francisco cable car system's [tpl]RailGauge|3ft6in|lk=on[/tpl] narrow gauge (at street level a few hundred feet away to the north of Market Street in both cases). The F Market heritage railway is also present here, at street level on Market Street. The rail lines, however, do not physically intersect.
The F Market and Wharves line uses the same [tpl]RailGauge|sg[/tpl] as the Muni Metro, and in fact uses the J Church tracks to travel between its regular route and the storage facility near Balboa Park Station.
SF Muni, used by many in San Francisco, the greater bay area region and those visiting from around the world have often remarked upon the inefficiency of the transportation system. In fact, a report conducted by the San Francisco Municipal Transport Agency in early 2013 noted that Muni was on time only 58.7% of the time. It delayed its customers a total of 172,195 hours and reduced the city's economic activity by $50 million USD per year.

==Governance==

Since the passage of Proposition E in November 1999, Muni has been part of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), a semi-independent city agency created by that ballot measure. The agency, into which Muni, the Department of Parking and Traffic, and the Taxicab Commission were merged, is governed by a seven-member Board of Directors appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the Board of Supervisors.
The executive director and CEO of the SFMTA since August 15, 2011 has been Edward D. Reiskin, who previously headed the San Francisco Department of Public Works.  He replaced Debra A. Johnson, the acting executive director and CEO who replaced Nathaniel P. Ford, Sr. upon his resignation.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/cityinsider/detail?entry_id=91900 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Rachel | last=Gordon | title=Debra Johnson picked to serve as Muni's acting chief | date=June 28, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/08/14/BAIV1KLU96.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Rachel | last=Gordon | title=S.F. transit leader starts tough job at tough time | date=August 15, 2011[/tpl]

==History==

===Early years===

Muni has its origins in the period following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Until then the city had been served by a number of commercial horsecar, cable car and electric streetcar operators. Many of these had been amalgamated into the United Railroads of San Francisco (URR) company. In 1909, voters approved a municipal rail line down Geary. Three years later in 1912, the city declined to renew the franchise that bestowed cable car operator Geary Street, Park & Ocean Railway the privilege of operating on Geary Street, and converted the line into a municipal electric streetcar line,[ref]

Muni soon started on a large building program. On December 29, 1914, the new Stockton Street Tunnel under Nob Hill opened, allowing streetcars from downtown to go to North Beach and the new Marina District. On February 3, 1918, the Twin Peaks Tunnel opened, making the southwestern quarter of the city available for development. On October 21, 1928, the Sunset Tunnel opened, bringing the N Judah streetcar line to the Sunset District. These improvements plunged Muni into direct competition with the URR on the entire length of Market Street. The two operators each operated their own pair of rail tracks down that thoroughfare, which came to be known as the "roar of the four".[ref]

===1940s: The first trolleybuses===

In 1941, Muni introduced its first trolleybus line, the R-Howard line. Trolleybuses had been running in San Francisco since 1935, but operated only by the Market Street Railway Company, successor to the URR.  By 1944, the MSR was in financial difficulties. Thus, at 5 am on September 29, 1944, Muni acquired its commercial competitor. Along with the routes and equipment, Muni adopted its competitor's more expensive seven-cent fare.[ref]
