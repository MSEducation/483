==Club career==

===Alianza Lima===

Cruzado came up through the youth ranks of Academia Tito Drago. In 2002, he joined Alianza Lima. Later in the 2002 season he made his Peruvian First Division debut for Club Alianza Lima, which was his only appearance that year. He eventually established himself as an important player for Alianza and together with a young Jefferson Farfán went on to claim the 2003 Peruvian First Division League title. Again in the 2004 season he helped Alianza win the 2004 Peruvian League title. He made his Copa Libertadores debut on 11 February 2004 in a group stage match against São Paulo FC, which finished in a 2-1 loss for Alianza.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.terra.com/deportes/especiales/copalibertadores2004/articulo042.html | title = Sao Paulo derrotó a Alianza con el peso de la camiseta |accessdate =7 September 2011 |date = 11 February 2004 |language = Spanish |publisher = terra.com[/tpl] He played in all of the group stage matches in the 2004 Copa Libertadores. However, Alianza were eliminated in that stage as they only managed to finish in 3rd place. In the 2005 season, he played 35 games and scored 1 goal, but with the departure of key players like Jefferson Farfán and Walter Vilchez Alianza finished in 7th place in the overall standings. The next season Cruzado made the most appearances for Alianza in all his time there, with 42 games played and 3 goals scored. That year in the 2006 season he formed a strong partnership in midfield with Marko Ciurlizza and won his third Peruvian League title with Alianza. Cruzado played an important role in the final two-legged tie that determined the champions of the 2006 season. The first leg was won by Cienciano 1-0 in Cusco. In the second leg, Cruzado helped Alianza turn the tie around and defeat Cienciano 3-1 in Matute, with the winning goal being scored by teammate Flavio Maestri.

===Grasshopper Club Zürich===

In January 2007, he left Alianza and transferred to Swiss team Grasshopper Club Zürich. He made his Swiss League debut on 10 February 2007 in a goal-less draw against FC Zürich.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
