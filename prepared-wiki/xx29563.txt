</ref><ref>
</ref> that were soon published in other languages.<ref>
</ref><ref>
</ref> Starting from Michon's integrative approach, Crépieux-Jamin ended up with a holistic approach to graphology.
Alfred Binet was convinced to do research into graphology from 1893 to 1907. He ended up calling it "The science of the future", despite graphologists' rejecting the results of his research.
After World War I, interest in graphology continued to spread in Europe as well as the United States. In Germany during the 1920s, Ludwig Klages founded and published his finding in Zeitschrift für Menschenkunde (Journal for the Study of Mankind). His major contribution to the field can be found in Handschrift und Charakter.[ref]

</ref>
Thea Stein Lewinson and J. Zubin modified Klage's ideas, based upon their experience working for the U.S. Government, publishing their method in 1942.[ref]

In 1929 Milton Bunker founded The American Grapho Analysis Society teaching Graphoanalysis. This organization and its system split the American graphology world in two. Students had to choose between Graphoanalysis or Holistic Graphology. Whilst hard data is lacking, anecdotal evidence indicates that 10% of the members of International Graphoanalysis Society(IGAS) were expelled between 1970 and 1980.[ref]
</ref> By the time Peter Ferrera died in 1991, the decimation of IGAS members had resulted in a decline of the influence of Graphoanalysis, and IGAS on American graphology.
Klara G. Roman was the most prominent of the German refugee scholars. Her books are still considered to be foundations for contemporary American Holistic graphology. She taught at the New School for Social Research in New York, and was succeeded there by Daniel S. Anthony and Florence Anthony.
Handwriting Workshops Unlimited was organized by Charlie Cole as a series of lectures for advanced students of Graphoanalysis. These lectures featured holistic graphologists such as Thea Lewinson and Klara Roman. By 1960 all of the participants had been expelled by IGAS. These individuals went on to form the American Handwriting Analysis Foundation. Later mass expulsions of IGAS members led to the formation of other societies, such as the American Association of Handwriting Analysts that were orientated towards Holistic graphology.
In 1972 talks between the American Handwriting Analysis Foundation and the American Association of Handwriting Analysis started, with the aim to form a single organization. Those talks resulted in the creation of the Council of Graphological Societies in 1976.
Stephen Bongiovanni created a theoretical basis for graphology based on the correlation of graphic expressive elements and behavioral traits. According to his theory, a single personality characteristic is defined by the combination of the four primary graphic elements of the baseline, enclosure, imposed pattern and stroke. The theory is included in the 1998 resource center www.handwritingpro.com.. Bongiovanni, Stephen founder of www.handwritingpro.com is a handwriting analyst since 1956.
Since the rise of the Internet in the early 1990s, the graphology organizations have suffered major declines in membership. However, because of email lists, communication between graphologists representing different approaches has increased.

==Legal considerations==

===In Hungary===

A Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information report[ref]
</ref> states that handwriting analysis without informed consent is a privacy violation.

===In the United States===

====Privacy====

Graphologists often claim that handwriting analysis in the workplace is legal,[ref]
</ref> erroneously citing one or more of the following cases:
All of these cases are about Fifth Amendment rights in a criminal investigation. These cases do not address issues relating to psychological analysis of an individual. Neither do they address third party issues.

====Equal Employment Opportunity Commission====

Many graphologists claim [tpl]Weasel-inline|date=January 2014[/tpl] that handwriting analysis is non-discriminatory, since it cannot determine gender, age, ethnicity, or other Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Protected Classes.[ref]
</ref> However, thus far, there have been no studies demonstrating that the use of handwriting analysis in employment does not have a disparate impact upon EEOC protected classes.
There have been a number of studies on gender and handwriting.[ref]
</ref><ref>

</ref><ref>

</ref><ref>
</ref> 
Uniformly the research indicates that gender can be determined at a significant level. The published studies on ethnicity,[ref]
</ref><ref>
</ref><ref>
</ref> race,<ref>
</ref><ref>
</ref><ref>
</ref> age,<ref>
</ref><ref>
</ref><ref>
</ref> nationality,<ref>
</ref> gender orientation, weight, and their relationship to handwriting have had mixed results.

====Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990====

One of the rules of thumb in human resources[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] is that if an individual who has an ADA-defined disability cannot take a test, then nobody can. As a result, tests that cannot be adapted for use by those individuals will not be used by a company.
Handwriting clearly falls into the group of tests that cannot be adapted to be administered to individuals who fall within one or more ADA-defined disabilities. Blind people, for example, do not develop the required fluency in handwriting, for the writing to be correctly analyzed.
Questions that handwriting analysts ask before doing an analysis can be illegal under this act.[ref]
</ref>

====Graphology in court testimony====

Cameron v Knapp, 137 Misc. 2d 373, 520 N.Y.S.2d 917 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Co. 1987) (handwriting expert may testify as to the authenticity of a writing but not as to an individual's physical or mental condition based on a handwriting sample) is an example of current U.S. case law for the rejection of graphology as psychological testimony.
Carroll v State Ark 160; 634 SW 2d 99, 101-102 (1982) will be remembered for its implications on the propriety of allowing graphologists to testify. The opposing Handwriting Analysts displayed a distinct lack of professional courtesy to each other. In doing so, they undermined the scientific validity of both Integrative Graphology and Holistic Graphology.name = "beyerstein1992"/>

==Applications==

===Employment profiling===

A company takes a writing sample provided by an applicant, and proceeds to do a personality profile, matching the congruency of the applicant with the ideal psychological profile of employees in the position.
A graphological report is meant to be used in conjunction with other tools, such as comprehensive background checks, practical demonstration or record of work skills. Graphology supporters state that it can complement but not replace traditional hiring tools.
Research in employment suitability has ranged from complete failure[tpl]cite journal|last=Lighton |first=R.E. |title=A Graphological Examination of the Handwriting of Air Pilots|work=Thesis in the Faculty of Arts |publisher=University of Pretoria|year=1934[/tpl] to guarded
success.[tpl]Citation|author=Luca, E S.|title=Major Aptitudes and Personality Chracteristics of 42 Dental Students as Evaluated Through their Handwriting|journal=New York Journal of Dentistry|year=1973|volume=43|pages=281–283[/tpl]  The most substantial reason for not using handwriting analysis in the employment process is the absence of evidence of a direct link between handwriting analysis and various measures of job performance[tpl]cite paper |last1=Thomas |first1=Steven L. |last2=Vaught |first2=Steve |title=The write stuff: What the evidence says about using handwriting analysis in hiring |work=SAM Advanced Management Journal |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=31–35 |date=September 2001[/tpl]
The use of graphology in the hiring process has been criticized on ethical grounds[tpl]Cite journal |first=Daryl |last=Koehn|title=Handwriting Analysis In Pre-Employment Screening|journal=The Online Journal of Ethics|volume=1|issue=1[/tpl] and on legal grounds in the US.[tpl]Cite journal |first=Julie |last=Spohn|title=The Legal Implications of Graphology|journal=Washington University Law Quarterly|volume=73|issue=3|date=Fall 1997[/tpl]

===Business compatibility===

This is an additional service offered by some handwriting analysts.
The focus of these reports can be one, or more of the following:
The content of these reports can range from a simple perspectrograph, to a four wheel Wittlich Diagram and accompanying twenty five thousand word analysis.

===Psychological analysis===

Graphology has been used clinically by some European counselors[tpl]Weasel-inline|date=January 2014[/tpl] and psychotherapists. When it is used, it is generally used alongside other projective personality assessment tools, and not in isolation. It is often used within individual psychotherapy, couples' therapy, or vocational counseling.Poizner, Annette (2012). Clinical Graphology: An Interpretive Manual for Mental Health Practitioners. Springfield, IL: Charles C Thomas Publishers

===Marital compatibility===

In its simplest form only sexual expression and sexual response are examined. At its most complex, every aspect of an individual is examined for how it affects the other individual(s). The basic theory is that after knowing and understanding how each other is different, any commitment that is made will be more enduring. Typically done for couples, it is not unknown for a polyamorous group to obtain a report prior to the commitment ceremony of a new individual.[tpl]Weasel-inline|date=April 2011[/tpl]
A variety of books have been written on this specific subject.

===Medical diagnosis===

Medical graphology[ref]
</ref> is probably the most controversial aspect of handwriting analysis. Strictly speaking, such research is not graphology as described throughout this article but an examination of factors pertaining to motor control. Research studies have been conducted in which a detailed examination of handwriting factors, particularly timing, fluidity, pressure, and consistency of size, form, speed, and pressure are considered in the process of evaluating patients and their response to pharmacological therapeutic agents.<ref>
</ref> The study of these phenomena is a by-product of researchers investigating motor control processes and the interaction of nervous, anatomical, and biomechanical systems of the body.
The Vanguard Code of Ethical Practice, amongst others, prohibits medical diagnosis by those not licensed to do diagnosis in the state in which they practice.

===Jury screening===

A graphologist is given handwriting samples of a prospective jury and determines who should be struck, based upon their alleged personality profile. After the trial has begun, the graphologist advises counsel on how to slant their case, for the most favorable response from the jury.[ref]
</ref>

===Graphotherapy===

This is the practice of changing a person's handwriting with the goal of changing features of his or her personality. It was pioneered in France during the nineteen-thirties, spreading to the United States in the late fifties.[ref]

</ref><ref name="destpaul2">

</ref>
The therapy consists of a series of exercises which are similar to those taught in basic calligraphy courses, sometimes in conjunction with music or positive self-talk.

==Divination==

Some individuals believe that one can tell the future from handwriting analysis. Others believe that a handwriting analyst can provide spiritual guidance on situations that they face. These beliefs are claimed to be false for reasons ranging from the complete lack of either scientific or anecdotal evidence, to the application of Aristotelian logic to any of the numerous (and mutually incompatible) theories of handwriting analysis. Most graphologists reject supernatural insights from their assessment of handwriting.
The code of ethics for the International Graphoanalysis Society, British Association of Graphology and Association Déontologique Européenne de Graphologie prohibits the practice of anything related to the occult.
