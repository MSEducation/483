Tom Brown's School Days is a 1940 coming-of-age drama film about a teenage boy's experiences at Rugby School, Warwickshire in the early 19th century under the reforming headmastership of Thomas Arnold. It stars Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Freddie Bartholomew and Jimmy Lydon in the title role. The film was based on the 1857 novel of the same name by Thomas Hughes.
In this version, emphasis is placed on the development of Headmaster Thomas Arnold and his reformist ideas concerning the English public school.[tpl]cite journal|title= Tom Brown's School Days; Adventures at Rugby|date=January 1, 1940|publisher=Variety|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117795775.html|accessdate=December 6, 2008[/tpl] It was well received by critics, with Variety praising it in a January 1940 review as "sympathetically and skillfully made, with many touching moments and an excellent cast". Hardwicke's performance as Arnold was called "one of the best he has ever given," as the veteran actor convincingly tempered the headmaster's strict demeanor with "the underlying sympathy, tolerance, quiet humour and steadfast courage" for which Arnold was acclaimed. Jimmy Lydon as the title character was called "believable and moving in the early portions, but too young for the final moments".
The June 27, 1940, debut of the film version at New York City's Radio City Music Hall was chronicled in a photo spread by The New York Times, "showing some of the pastimes, curricular and otherwise", as the fight scene between Tom Brown and Flashman was captioned.[tpl]cite news|title=Reflections of passing events in the screen world|date=June 23, 1940|publisher=The New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=2&res=FA0C17FB345D10728DDDAA0A94DE405B8088F1D3|accessdate=2009-01-23 | format=PDF[/tpl]
