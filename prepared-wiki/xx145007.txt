[[Thick shelled river mussel]]

CATEGORIES: Unio (genus)

The thick shelled river mussel, scientific name Unio crassus, is a species of freshwater mussel, an aquatic bivalve mollusk in the family Unionidae, the river mussels.

==Ecology==

As part of newly discovered reproductive behaviour, this mollusc crawls up to the edge of the water, exposing its excurrent aperture, and then lets loose a stream of water. The fountain of water often contains glochidia, and it is suggested that this spurting behavior may facilitate dispersal of mussel larvae.

==Decline==

The thick shelled river mussel declined during the 20th century everywhere in Europe due to deteriorating water quality,Douda, K. 2010.
