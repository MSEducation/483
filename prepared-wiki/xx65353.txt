The province includes the small islands of Fårö and Gotska Sandön to the north, as well as the Karlsö Islands (Lilla and Stora) to the west, which are even smaller. The island of Gotland has an area of 2,994 km² (1,156 mi²), whereas the province has 3,183.7 km² (1,229.2 mi²) (1,217 mi²) of land excluding the lakes and rivers.Statistisk årsbok för Sverige 2009 The population is 57,221,Statistics Sweden (as of December 31, 2009) of which about 22,200 live in Visby, the main town.Statistics Sweden (as of December 31, 2005) The island's main sources of income are tourism, agriculture, and concrete production from locally mined limestone.

==Administration==

The traditional provinces of Sweden serve no administrative or political purposes, but are historical and cultural entities. In the case of Gotland, however, due to its insular position, the administrative county (län), Gotland County, and the municipality (kommun), Gotland Municipality, both cover the same territory as the province. Furthermore, the Diocese of Visby is also congruent with the province.

==Heraldry==

Gotland was granted its arms in about 1560.Clara Nevéus, Bror jacques de Wærn: Ny svensk vapenbok, 1992 The coat of arms is represented with a ducal coronet. Blazon: "Azure a ram statant Argent armed Or holding on a cross-staff of the same a banner Gules bordered and with five tails of the third." The county was granted the same coat of arms in 1936. The municipality, created in 1971, uses the same picture, but with other tinctures.
The Gotlandic flag displays the Gotlandic coat of arms, white on red ground, known from the 13th century in the shape of the seal of the Gutnish Republic with the proud ram. It reads: "Gutenses signo xpistus signatur in agno".

==Geography==

Visby is the seat of the municipality as well as the capital of the county. It has a population of approximately 22,200, around two-fifths of the island's population.
Gotland is located about 90 km (56 mi) east of the Swedish mainland and about 130 km (81 mi) from the Baltic States, Latvia being the nearest. Gotland is the name of the main island, but the adjacent islands are generally considered part of Gotland and the Gotlandic culture:
There are several shallow lakes located near shores of the island. The biggest is Lake Bästeträsk, located near Fleringe in the northern part of Gotland.
Gotland contains many popular beaches, such as Tofta Strand, and Hundfria strand.
The highest point of the island is Lojsta Hed which stands 82 m above sea level.

==Geology==

Gotland is made up of a sequence of sedimentary rocks of a Silurian age, dipping to the south-east.
The main Silurian succession of limestones and shales comprises thirteen units spanning 200–500 m of stratigraphic thickness, being thickest in the south, and overlies a 75- to 125-m thick Ordovician sequence.[ref]
