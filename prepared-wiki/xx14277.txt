10 milliseconds (a hundredth of a second) are called a centisecond, commonly seen on many stopwatches but often mistaken for milliseconds.
100 milliseconds (one tenth of a second) are called a decisecond.
To help compare orders of magnitude of different times, this page lists times between 10−3 seconds and 100 seconds (1 milli and one second). See also times of other orders of magnitude.
