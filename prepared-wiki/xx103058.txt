Hawaii Preparatory Academy (also known as HPA) is a coeducational, boarding, independent school in Kamuela, Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i teaching kindergarten through the twelfth grade.  Founded in 1949 by The Right Reverend Harry S. Kennedy, Episcopal Bishop of Honolulu, the school came of age under the leadership of James Monroe Taylor II, Headmaster from 1954-1974. Originally the school was located on the grounds of St. James Episcopal Church in Kamuela in buildings that were built as barracks for the United States Marines during World War II. 
Currently the nationally recognized high school features three dormitories- Anna's for girls, Hartwells' for boys, and Robertson's, the co-ed and smallest of the dorms.
As a side note, Kamuela, the town where HPA is located, is usually called Waimea by the locals. Kamuela is adopted since there are three towns called Waimea in the state of Hawai'i, and Kamuela is used to distinguish locations by USPS.
HPA is now divided into a lower school, middle school and upper school.  The lower and middle school together compose one campus in the ranch region of the Big Island of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i. The upper school is located at the foot of the Kohala Mountains.  The school is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.
The upper campus has a weight room, wrestling room, pool, school library, an indoor tennis facility, baseball field, gym, bookstore, as well as a new (2008) softball field, a newly repaired football/soccer field and a new rubber track.  The school also is host to a cross country course. Along with classrooms, an art building, multiple Mac equipped computer labs and a theater, and an Energy Lab, the only of its kind in the world.[tpl]cn|date=January 2013[/tpl] There is also a church on the property built before the school moved to its presents site.
The village campus is in the middle of the town of Waimea, and features the only school-owned professional art-gallery in the State, Isaacs Art Center. The village campus also has two soccer fields.
The school also has a successful boys cross country team. Two male champions in the recent years include Mac Crommett (Class of '07) and Emmett Weatherford (Class of '05). Their girls cross country team has also been successful.[tpl]cn|date=January 2013[/tpl]
The HPA robotics team is the recent state champions of the 2009 Botball competition.
The school colors are red and white. The school's mascot is Ka Makani, which is Hawaiian for "the wind". (The campus is noteworthy for the steady winds which blow around it at speeds averaging 20 MPH)
