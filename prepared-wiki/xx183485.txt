London Turkish Radio (LTR) is a Turkish radio station broadcasting to London on 1584 kHz AM specialising in music, news, and politics. 

==History==

The radio station was launched in 1990 and was called the Turkish Radio, broadcasting to the Turkish and Turkish speaking Communities for the first time under the name of Turkish Radio, for only one hour per day between the hours of 12 midnight to 1am.  Because the response to the small broadcast was so successful, a license to broadcast 24 hours a day was granted.
The name of the radio station changed in 1994 to London Turkish Radio (LTR), and has since grown in popularity, and is the only fully licensed radio station broadcasting in Turkish for a full 24hr period outside Turkey and Northern Cyprus.

==Coverage==

Coverage extends over most of the London Boroughs where large numbers of Turkish and Turkish speaking communities reside. According to Ofcom (Office of Communications), LTR has over 80,000 listeners in the London Borough of Haringey alone.  LTR's licence was re-awarded in November 2002 and commenced running in August 2003 until 2011.

==Internet radio service==

London Turkish Radio has through its online live Internet service, attracted popularity throughout the world, from the USA to Europe, and Asia, and as far as Australia and Japan.
