==Synopsis==

===Scene 1===

Albert is a young knight who devotes himself to jousting and courtly pleasures, but is now deeply in debt as a result.  His father, a very wealthy but equally frugal baron, refuses to support his son's lifestyle.  Albert's ability to maneuver in society is now limited, and he tries to obtain a loan from outside his family.  A money-lender denies Albert a loan, but instead offers Albert poison, to allow Albert to murder his father.  Albert is appalled at such a suggestion.  He resolves then to go to the Duke to make his appeal.

===Scene 2===

The Baron descends to his cellars, exultant now because he has accumulated enough gold to fill his sixth and final storage chest, and gloats before them.  However, he realizes that if he died soon, his son Albert could then claim the fortune and fritter it away on his sensual pleasures.  

===Scene 3===

Albert has appealed to the Duke for help in obtaining money from his father.  Albert hides, as the Duke summons the Baron to a meeting.  The Duke asks the Baron to support his son, but the Baron accuses Albert of wanting to steal from him.  Albert then angrily reveals his presence and accuses his own father of lying.  The Baron challenges Albert to a duel, and Albert accepts.  The duke rebukes the father, and banishes the son from his court.  However, stressed by this confrontation, the baron collapses fatally.  As the Baron dies, his last request is not for his son, but the keys to his chests of gold.
