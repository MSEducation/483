==Genealogy==

Before Nakamikado's ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (imina) was [tpl]nihongo|Yoshihito|慶仁[/tpl]Ponsonby-Fane, p. 10. or Yasuhito; and his pre-accession title was Masu-no-miya (長宮).
Nakamikado was the fifth son of Emperor Higashiyama. His mother was the lady-in-waiting Fujiwara no Yoshiko, but he was brought up as if he were the son of the Empress consort, Arisugawa no Yukiko.
Nakamikado's Imperial family lived with him in the Dairi of the Heian Palace. This family included at least 16 children:

==Events of Nakamikado's life==

In 1708, Nakamikado became Crown Prince.
Immediately after the abdication, Prince Yashuhito became the emperor.  Because of his youth, first his father, the retired Emperor Higashiyama, and then his grandfather, the retired Emperor Reigen exercised Imperial powers in his name.
Nakamikado reign corresponded to the period from the sixth shōgun, Tokugawa Ienobu, to the eighth shōgun, Tokugawa Yoshimune.  During this period, relations with the Bakufu were fairly good.  Talk of a marriage between Imperial Princess Yaso-no-miya Yoshiko (八十宮吉子内親王), daughter of Retired Emperor Reigen and the seventh shōgun, Tokugawa Ietsugu were halted by the sudden death of the shogun in Edo.Titsingh, p. 415; Ponsonby-Fane, p. 118.
In 1737, Nakamikado died.  His kami is enshrined in an Imperial mausoleum (misasagi), Tsukinowa no misasagi, at Sennyū-ji in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto.  Also enshrined in this location are his immediate Imperial predecessors since Emperor Go-Mizunoo – Meishō, Go-Kōmyō, Go-Sai, Reigen, and Higashiyama.  Nakamikado's immediate Imperial successors, including Sakuramachi, Momozono, Go-Sakuramachi and Go-Momozono, are enshrined here as well.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 423.

===Kugyō===

[tpl]nihongo|Kugyō|公卿[/tpl] is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.
In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Nakamikado's reign, this apex of the ''Daijō-kan included:
