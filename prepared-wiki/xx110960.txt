==Death and legacy==

Delaney had a lifelong history of helping others, and once paid for the funeral of a former teacher whose family could not afford a proper service. On June 29, 1983, Delaney, who was living in nearby Ruston, went with friends to Critter's Creek, an amusement center at Chennault Park in Monroe, Louisiana. While reportedly discouraging swimming children from venturing too far out in a pond, Delaney dove in to save three children who were screaming for help, floundering in a water hole left by recent construction work.Althaus, p. 139 The water hole, which covered two acres and was 20 feet deep,[tpl]cite web | title=No ordinary Joe | last=Reilly | first=Rick | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/rick_reilly/news/2003/07/01/reilly0707/ | work=Sports Illustrated | date=2003-07-03 | accessdate=2008-07-13[/tpl] was not intended for swimming but to add to the park's aesthetics.Althaus, p. 140 Despite his inability to swim,Minden Press-Herald, July 1, 1983, p. 1 Delaney nevertheless tried to rescue the children.[tpl]cite web | title=Chiefs should pause to honor a hero | last=Sangamino | first=Pat | url=http://www.kfoxtv.com/sh/sports/columnist/stories/columnists-89126020010726-140730.html | work=KFOX-TV (El Paso, TX) | date=2001-07-26 | accessdate=2008-07-13[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] One child managed to get out of the water without harm and another was taken to an emergency room where he later died; police recovered the body of Delaney and the remaining child.

A group of Chiefs fans in Kansas City formed the "37Forever Foundation," which works with the American Red Cross to provide swimming lessons for underprivileged children. The Kansas City Chiefs unofficially retired Delaney's jersey number 37 following his death, and he was elected to the team's Hall of Fame in 2004.
