The Division of Boothby is an Australian electoral division in South Australia. The division was one of the seven established when the former Division of South Australia was redistributed on 2 October 1903 and is named for William Boothby (1829â€“1903), the Returning Officer for the first federal election.Profile of the Electoral Division of Boothby, 4 January 2011, Australian Electoral Commission.

==History==

Before 1949 and the creation of the Division of Sturt, Boothby covered most of the southern and eastern suburbs of Adelaide, and changed hands several times between the Australian Labor Party and the conservative parties. This changed with the 1949 expansion of parliament, which saw most of its southern portion transferred to the newly created Division of Kingston, leaving the affluent south-eastern and gulfside suburbs in Boothby. It has been in the hands of the Liberal Party since then. From 1949 to 2001, it was generally one of the safest metropolitan seats for the Liberals. However, from the 2004 election onward it become increasingly marginal[ref]The AEC Seat 'safeness' ratings are: Seat status is generally based on the two-party-preferred results of the last election.

The seat has been held by Andrew Southcott since 1996. Its most prominent members were Sir John McLeay, who was Speaker 1956-66, his son John, Jr., a minister in the Fraser government, and former state premier Steele Hall.
The seat of Boothby gained national prominence in 2007 when the then opposition Labor Party preselected Nicole Cornes, an Advertiser columnist and wife of popular former footballer Graham Cornes.[tpl]cite web |title=Star ALP candidate battles for Boothby  |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2007/s2095142.htm |accessdate=2008-11-09 |author=Mike Sexton |work=ABC 7:30 Report |date=19 November 2007 [/tpl] Her bid for the seat was unsuccessful, though Southcott saw his margin decrease to 53 percent.
