[[Sumatran serow]]

CATEGORIES: Mammals of Indonesia

The Sumatran serow (Capricornis sumatraensis), also known as the southern serow, is a species of goat-antelope native to mountain forests in the Thai-Malay Peninsula and on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The former name of this species is "mainland serow", as all the mainland species of serow (Chinese, red and Himalayan) used to be considered subspecies of this species. The Sumatran serow is threatened due to habitat loss and hunting, leading to it being evaluated as vulnerable by the IUCN.
