[[Sixth Party System]]

CATEGORIES: Politics of the United States

The Sixth Party System is the era of American national politics that started in the late 1960s, following the collapse of the Fifth Party System and is currently unfolding.
Maisel and Brewer (2011) argue that the consensus among specialists is that the sixth System is underway:
A critical factor was the major transformation of the political system in the Reagan Era or "Age of Reagan" of the 1980s and beyond led by Ronald Reagan.Sean Wilentz, The Age of Reagan: A History, 1974-2008 (2008)

Opinions differ on when this Party System began, varying from elections of 1966-68 or the 1980s when both parties began to become more unified and partisan, to the 1990s over cultural divisions.
Craig argues for the 1972 elections, when Richard Nixon won a 49-state landslide. He notes that, "There seems to be consensus on the appropriate name for the sixth party system.... Changes that occurred during the 1960s were so great and so pervasive that they cry out to be called a critical-election period. The new system of candidate-centered parties is so distinct and so portentous that one can no longer deny its existence or its character."Stephen C. Craig, Broken Contract? Changing Relationships between Americans and Their Government (1996) p 105
The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History dates the start in 1980, with the election of Reagan and a Republican Senate.Michael Kazin, et al. eds, The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History'' (2009) Vol. 2 p 288

==History==

Richard Nixon produced Southern Strategy with his Republican Party, which helped him won the 1968 elections, with this election also ended the Democrats a century of rule in Southern United States. Nixon also won the 1972 re-elections in landslide.
Ronald Reagan produced a major realignment with his 1980 and 1984 landslide elections. The Democrats had control of Congress with two breaks since 1932. The Republican Party (GOP) took control of the Senate in 1980 and the House in 1994. It built a strong base in the white South, while losing the Northeastern base of the liberal and moderate Republicans.Nicol C. Rae, The Decline and Fall of the Liberal Republicans: From 1952 to the Present (1989)
Reagan's economic policies (dubbed "Reaganomics") and the implementation of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 called for sharply reduced federal budgets (he only partly achieved), sharply reduced federal regulation of business (which he achieved), and sharp cuts in the federal income tax rates (which he achieved). He lowered the top income tax rate on high incomes from 70% to 28% over the course of seven years.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdoc.cfm?index=5324&type=0&sequence=0 |title= Effective Federal Tax Rates: 1979–2001 | publisher = Bureau of Economic Analysis | date = July 10, 2007[/tpl] Reagan continued to downsize government taxation and regulation.[tpl]harvnb|Wilentz|2008|pp=140–141[/tpl] The US experienced a recession in 1982, but the negative indicators reversed, with the inflation rate decreasing from 11% to 2%, the unemployment rate decreasing from 10.8% in December 1982 to 7.5% in November 1984,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.miseryindex.us/urbymonth.asp |title=The United States Unemployment Rate |publisher=Miseryindex.us |date=November 8, 2008 |accessdate=January 31, 2010[/tpl] and the economic growth rate increasing from 4.5% to 7.2%.[tpl]harvnb|Wilentz|2008|p=170[/tpl]

Some of the characteristics for this era displays are:

==Issues==

Harris and Tichenor argue:

==Voter coalitions==

New voter coalitions included the emergence of the "religious right"—a combination of Catholics and fundamentalist Protestants united on opposition to abortion and gay rights. Southern white voters started voting for Republican presidential candidates in the 1960s, and Republican state and local candidates in the 1990s.J. David Woodard, The New Southern Politics (2006)For a graph of the movement of Southern white voters see [tpl]cite book|author=Brian F. Schaffner|title=Politics, Parties, and Elections in America |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Z7kcTUn1G40C&pg=PA341|year=2010|edition=7th|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=31[/tpl]
Democrats augmented their coalition with well educated voters, gays, and non-religious seculars. The Hispanic population grew very rapidly, reaching 15% of the population, but turnout was so low they were not a major factor in voting, except in California. Although George W. Bush made a special effort to reach Hispanics, their negative reaction to Republican nativism on the issue of immigration strengthened the Democratic affiliations of those Hispanics who voted.

==Rules of the game==

New rules changes involved campaign financing, as very large sums were raised and candidates spent much of their energy focused on raising money behind the scenes.  New campaign technologies involved the Internet, but television advertising continued to grow in importance, overshadowing the Internet as a campaign tool. Howard Dean in 2004 demonstrated that the Internet could be used to organize and finance a crusade, and this model was followed by most of the candidates for the 2008 election, with Barack Obama and Ron Paul the most successful.Anthony Corrado and Molly Corbett, “Rewriting the Playbook on Presidential Campaign Financing,” in Campaigning for President, 2008, edited by Dennis W. Johnson (Routledge, 2009) pp 126-46
