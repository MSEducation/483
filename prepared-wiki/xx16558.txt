[[Satellite temperature measurements]]

CATEGORIES: Satellite meteorology and remote sensing

The temperature of the atmosphere at various altitudes as well as sea and land surface temperatures can be inferred from satellite measurements. Weather satellites do not measure temperature directly but measure radiances in various wavelength bands. These measurements can be used to locate weather fronts, monitor the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, determine the strength of tropical cyclones, study urban heat islands and monitor the global climate. Wildfires, volcanos, and industrial hot spots can also be found via thermal imaging from weather satellites.
Since 1978 Microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration polar orbiting satellites have measured the intensity of upwelling microwave radiation from atmospheric oxygen, which is proportional to the temperature of broad vertical layers of the atmosphere. Measurements of infrared radiation pertaining to sea surface temperature have been collected since 1967.
Satellite datasets show that over the past four decades the troposphere has warmed and the stratosphere has cooled. Both of these trends are consistent with the influence of increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.

==Measurement==

Satellites do not measure temperature.  They measure radiances in various wavelength bands, which must then be mathematically inverted to obtain indirect inferences of temperature.[tpl]cite book |chapter=Atmospheric Soundings |title=Issues in the Integration of Research and Operational Satellite Systems for Climate Research: Part I.

As a result, different groups that have analyzed the satellite data  have produced differing temperature datasets. Among these are the UAH dataset prepared at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and the RSS dataset prepared by Remote Sensing Systems. The satellite series is not fully homogeneous - it is constructed from a series of satellites with similar but not identical instrumentation. The sensors deteriorate over time, and corrections are necessary for orbital drift and decay. Particularly large differences between reconstructed temperature series occur at the few times when there is little temporal overlap between successive satellites, making intercalibration difficult.

===Surface measurements===

Satellites may also be used to retrieve surface temperatures in cloud-free conditions, generally via measurement of thermal infrared from AVHRR. Weather satellites have been available to infer sea surface temperature (SST) information since 1967, with the first global composites occurring during 1970.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/100/mwr-100-01-0010.pdf|title=Global Sea-Surface Temperature Distribution Determined From an Environmental Satellite|author=P.

===Tropospheric and stratospheric measurements===

From 1979 to 2005 the microwave sounding units (MSUs) and since 1998 the Advanced Microwave Sounding Units on NOAA polar orbiting satellites have measured the intensity of upwelling microwave radiation from atmospheric oxygen. The intensity is proportional to the temperature of broad vertical layers of the atmosphere, as demonstrated by theory and direct comparisons with atmospheric temperatures from radiosonde (balloon) profiles. Upwelling radiance is measured at different frequencies; these different frequency bands sample a different weighted range of the atmosphere.Remote Sensing Systems 
The brightness temperature (TB) measured by satellite is given by:[tpl]cite journal|last=Mears|first=Carl A.|coauthors=Wentz, Frank J.|title=Construction of the Remote Sensing Systems V3.2 Atmospheric Temperature Records from the MSU and AMSU Microwave Sounders|journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology|volume=26|issue=6|pages=1040–1056|doi=10.1175/2008JTECHA1176.1|accessdate=30 April 2014[/tpl]
where W(S) is the surface weight,T(0) and T(Z) are the temperatures at the surface and at the atmospheric level z and W(Z) is the atmospheric weighting function.
Both the surface and atmospheric weights are dependent on the surface emissivity eS, the absorption coefficient κ(z) and the earth incidence angle θ; the surface weight is the product of eS and an attenuation factor:
where
The atmospheric weighting functions W(Z) can be written as:
The first term in this equation is related to the radiation emitted upward from the level z and attenuated along the path to the top of the atmosphere (∞), the second include the radiation emitted downward from the level z to the surface (0) and the radiation reflected back by the surface (proportional to eS) to the top of the atmosphere, the exact form of W(Z) is dependent upon the temperature,water vapor and liquid water content of the atmosphere.
MSU Channel 1 is not used to monitor atmospheric temperature because it's too much sensitive to the emission from the surface, furthermore it is heavily contaminated by water vapor/liquid water in the lowermost  troposphere.[tpl]cite web|last=Spencer|first=Roy|title=A TOVS Pathfinder Path C Product  Daily 2.5 Degree Gridpoint Layer Temperatures and Oceanic Rainfall for 1979-93|url=http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NASA/.msu/.dataset_documentation.html|accessdate=30 April 2014[/tpl]
Channel 2 or TMT is broadly representative of the troposphere, albeit with a significant overlap with the lower stratosphere (the weighting function has its maximum at 350 hPa and half-power at about 40 and 800 hPa). In an attempt to remove the stratospheric influence, Spencer and Christy developed the synthetic "2LT or TLT" product by subtracting signals at different view angles; this has a maximum at about 650 hPa. However this amplifies noise,[tpl]cite journal |last=Christy |first=John R. |authorlink= |coauthors=Spencer, Roy W.; Lobl, Elena S. |year=1998 |title=Analysis of the Merging Procedure for the MSU Daily Temperature Time Series |journal=Journal of Climate |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=2016–2041 |doi=10.1175/1520-0442(1998)0112.0.CO;2 |url= |issn=1520-0442 [/tpl] increases inter-satellite calibration biases and enhances surface contamination.[tpl]cite journal |last=Fu |first=Qiang |authorlink= |coauthors=Johanson, Celeste M. |year=2005 |title=Satellite-Derived Vertical Dependence Of Tropical Tropospheric Temperature Trends |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=32 |issue=10 |pages=L10703 |doi=10.1029/2004GL022266 |url= |bibcode=2005GeoRL..3210703F[/tpl]  The 2LT product has gone through numerous versions as various corrections have been applied.
Another methodology to reduce the influence of the stratosphere has been developed by Fu and Johanson, the  TTT(Total Troposphere Temperature) channel is a linear combination of the TMT and TLS channel: TTT=1.1*TMT-0.1*TLS
The T4 or TLS channel in representative of the temperature in the lower stratosphere with a peak weighting function at around 17Km above the earth surface.
Since 1979 the Stratospheric sounding units (SSUs) on the NOAA operational satellites provided near global stratospheric temperature data above the lower stratosphere.
The SSU is a far-infrared spectrometer employing a pressure modulation technique to make measurement in three channels in the 15 μm carbon dioxide absorption band. The three channels use the same frequency but different carbon dioxide cell pressure, the corresponding weighting functions peaks at 29 km for channel1, 37 km for channel2 and 45 km for channel3.http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/pod-guide/ncdc/docs/podug/html/c4/sec4-2.htm

==Trends from the record==

Records have been created by merging data from nine different MSUs, each with peculiarities (e.g., time drift of the spacecraft relative to the local solar time) that must be calculated and removed because they can have substantial impacts on the resulting trend.The Satellite Temperature Records: Parts 1 and 2 May 1996  The satellite record is short, which means adding a few years on to the record or picking a particular time frame can change the trends considerably.  The problems with the length of the MSU record is shown by the table to the right, which shows the UAH TLT (lower tropospheric) global trend (°C/decade) beginning with Dec 1978 and ending with December of the year shown.
The process of constructing a temperature record from a radiance record is difficult.  The satellite temperature record comes from a succession of different satellites and problems with inter-calibration between the satellites are important, especially NOAA-9, which accounts for most of the difference between various analyses.Remote Sensing Systems NOAA-11 played a significant role in a 2005 study by Mears et al. identifying an error in the diurnal correction that leads to the 40% jump in Spencer and Christy's trend from version 5.1 to 5.2.[tpl]cite journal |last=Mears |first=Carl A. |authorlink= |coauthors=Wentz, Frank J. |year=2005 |title=The Effect of Diurnal Correction on Satellite-Derived Lower Tropospheric Temperature |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5740 |pages=1548–1551 |doi=10.1126/science.1114772 |url= |pmid=16141071 |bibcode = 2005Sci...309.1548M [/tpl]  There are ongoing efforts to resolve differences in satellite temperature datasets.
Christy et al. (2007) find that the tropical temperature trends from radiosondes matches closest with his v5.2 UAH dataset.[tpl]cite journal |last=Christy |first=J.

Using the T2 channel (which include significant contributions from the stratosphere, which has cooled), Mears et al. of Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) find (through December 2013) a trend of +0.078 °C/decade.  Spencer and Christy of the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), find a smaller trend of +0.045 °C/decade.

The process of deriving trends from SSUs measurement has proved particularly difficult because of satellites drift, inter-calibration between different satellite with scant overlap and gas leak in the instrument carbon dioxide pressure cell, furthermore since the radiances measured by SSUs are due to emission by carbon dioxide the weighting functions move to higher altitudes as the carbon dioxide concentration in the stratosphere increase.
Mid to upper stratosphere temperature show strong negative trend interspersed by transient volcanic warming after the explosive volcanic eruptions of El Chichón and Mount Pinatubo, little temperature trend has been observed since 1995.

===Comparison to instrumental record===

The satellite records have the advantage of global coverage, whereas the radiosonde record is longer. There have been complaints of data problems with both records.
To compare to the trend from the surface temperature record (approximately +0.07 °C/decade over the past century and +0.17 °C/decade since 1979) it is most appropriate to derive trends for the part of the atmosphere nearest the surface, i.e., the lower troposphere. Doing this, through December 2013:

==Reconciliation with climate models==

Climate model results summarized by the IPCC in their third assessment show overall good agreement with the satellite temperature record.  In particular both models and satellite record show a global average warming trend for the troposphere (models range for TLT/T2LT 0.6 - 0.39 °C/decade; avg 0.2 °C/decade) and a cooling of the stratosphere (models range for TLS/T4 -0.7 - 0.08 °C/decade; avg -0.25 °C/decade).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap1-1/finalreport/sap1-1-final-execsum.pdf|author=Tom M.

Folland|title=Executive Summary: Temperature Trends in the Lower Atmosphere - Understanding and Reconciling Differences|date=2006-05-02|publisher=United States Global Climate Change Research Program|accessdate=2011-01-14[/tpl]
There remain, however, differences in detail between the satellite data and the climate models used.
Globally, the troposphere is predicted by models to warm about 1.2 times more than the surface; in the tropics, the troposphere should warm about 1.5 times more than the surface. Most climate models used by the IPCC in preparation of their third assessment show a slightly greater warming at the TLT level than at the surface (0.03 °C/decade difference) for 1979-1999[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf|title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report Summary for Policymakers|author=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2011-01-14|authorlink=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap1-1/finalreport/sap1-1-final-chap5.pdf|title=Temperature Trends in the Lower Atmosphere - Understanding and Reconciling Differences: Chapter 5|author=Benjamin D.

The expected trend in the lower troposphere, given the surface data, would be around 0.194 °C/decade.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
This greater global average warming in the troposphere compared to the surface (present in the models but not observed data) is most marked in the tropics. CCSP SAP 1.1 chapter 5 says:
"In the tropics, surface temperature changes are amplified in the free troposphere. Models and observations
show similar amplification behavior for monthly and interannual temperature variations, but not for decadal
temperature changes. Tropospheric amplification of surface temperature anomalies is due to the release of latent heat by moist, rising
air in regions experiencing convection."
Although all the datasets show the expected tropospheric amplification at seasonal and annual timescales it is still debated whether or not the long term trends are consistent with the expected moist adiabatic lapse rate[tpl]cite journal |last=Stone |first=P.H. |authorlink= |coauthors=J.

===Historic differences===

For some time the only available satellite record was the UAH version, which (with early versions of the processing algorithm) showed a global cooling trend for its first decade. Since then, a longer record and a number of corrections to the processing have revised this picture: the UAH dataset has shown an overall warming trend since 1998, though less than the RSS version. In 2001, an extensive comparison and discussion of trends from different data sources and periods was given in the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  (section 2.2.4).United Nations Environment Programme
