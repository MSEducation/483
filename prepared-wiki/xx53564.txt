CATEGORIES: Government

The word regime (also "régime", from the original French pronunciation) refers to a set of conditions, most often of a political nature.

==Politics==

In politics, a regime is the form of government: the set of rules, cultural or social norms, etc. that regulate the operation of government and its interactions with society. It's basically the time or period a person rules.
Modern usage
While the word regime originates as a synonym for any form of government, modern usage often gives the term a negative connotation, implying an authoritarian government or dictatorship. Webster's definition states that the word regime refers simply to a form of government,Regime as defined in the Merriam–Webster website while Oxford English Dictionary defines regime as "a government, especially an authoritarian one".Regime as defined in the Oxford English Dictionary Nowadays the political use of the word regime is most commonly[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] applied to any government that is most of the time not democratically elected and imposes strict and often arbitrary rules and laws on the people that are, because of the undemocratic nature of the government, non-negotiable.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] English language press journalists deploy it selectively to cue their news audiences to view particular foreign governments negatively.  For example, in a September 1, 2013 news story, Huffington Post reporter Christina Wilkie refers to the Syrian government as the "regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad"Saudi Arabia Backs Syria Strikes, Boosting White House Case Huffington Post. September 1, 2013. 
International regime
International political use of regime concerns international regulatory agencies (see International regime), which lie outside of the control of national governments. These have more power over a greater range than postal or telecommunications agreements, for example, and constrain national governments.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2008[/tpl]

==Science==

In scientific discussions, a regime is a class of physical conditions, usually parameterised by some specific measures, where a particular physical phenomenon or boundary condition is significant. Very often a regime corresponds to a limiting condition. The region of measurable parameter space that corresponds to a regime is very often loosely defined. Examples include "the superfluid regime",Fermi gases approach superfluid regime "the steady state regime"A. R. Kolovsky, Steady-state regime for the rotational dynamics of a molecule at the condition of quantum chaos, Phys. Rev. A 48 (1993) 3072 or "the femtosecond regime".M. Lenzner et al., Femtosecond Optical Breakdown in Dielectrics, PRL 80 (1998) 4076
In geography and hydrography, "regime" refers to the changing conditions of river beds and other features, such as systems of sandbars.
