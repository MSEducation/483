[[Shanty Point]]

CATEGORIES: Headlands of Graham Land, Loubet Coast

Shanty Point ([tpl]Coord|66|25|S|65|38|W||display=inline,title[/tpl]) is a small point within Darbel Bay, lying close west of the mouth of Cardell Glacier on the west coast of Graham Land. Photographed by Hunting Aerosurveys Ltd. in 1955-57, and mapped from these photos by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS). So named by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) because, when seen from a distance, a large rectangular boulder on the point has the appearance of a small hut with a crooked chimney.
