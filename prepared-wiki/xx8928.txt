In a 1999 interview, Kinski denied that her father had sexually molested her as a child, but said he had abused her "in other ways." In 2013, when interviewed about the allegations of sexual abuse made by her half-sister Pola Kinski, she confirmed that he tried with her, but did not succeed. She said: 
 "He was no father. 99 percent of the time I was terrified of him. He was so unpredictable that the family lived in constant terror." When asked what she would say to him now, if she had the chance, she replied: "I would do anything to put him behind bars for life. I am glad he is no longer alive."
After the age of ten, Kinski rarely saw her father. Her mother struggled financially to support them.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,290196,00.html|title=Daddy's Girl|publisher=Guardian|date=3 July 1999|accessdate=18 April 2010|location=London[/tpl] They eventually lived in a commune in Munich.
