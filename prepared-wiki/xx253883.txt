Lugaid Loídge "Lugaid of the Calf Goddess", also known as Lugaid mac Dáire, was a legendary King of Tara and High King of Ireland. He is a son of Dáire Doimthech, a quo the Dáirine, and gives his epithet to their principal royal sept, the Corcu Loígde. A descendant of Lugaid, with whom he may be to some extent identical, is the famous Mac Con,O'Rahilly, passim listed in the Old Irish kinglist Baile Chuinn Chétchathaig as Mac Con macc aui (moccu) Lugde Loígde.ed. Bhreathnach & Murray
In some later synchretic traditions, as Lugaid Laigde,simply a later spelling he is incorrectly made a son of Eochu mac Ailella, and given a son Rechtaid Rígderg. Another late emanation is Lugaid Luaigne.
