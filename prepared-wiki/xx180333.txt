[[Chocolate salami]]

CATEGORIES: Chocolate desserts, Portuguese cuisine

Chocolate salami is a traditional Portuguese dessert made from dark chocolate, broken cookies, butter, eggs and a bit of port wine or rum. The dessert became popular across Europe and elsewhere, often losing alcohol as an ingredient along the way.http://www.ifood.tv/network/chocolate_salami
Chocolate salami is not a meat product. The appellation "salami" stems from physical resemblance. Like salami, chocolate salami is formed as a long cylinder and is sliced across into discs for serving. These discs are a brown, chocolaty matrix (like the red meat of salami) peppered with bright bits of cookie (like the white flecks of fat in salami). Some varieties also contain chopped nuts, such as almonds or hazelnuts and may be shaped like truffles.
