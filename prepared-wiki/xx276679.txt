Sleep It Off is the second album from No Wave pop singer Cristina.

==Music==

Sleep It Off was produced by Don Was. The songs were written by Cristina (all lyrics, except for the covers) collaborating with Was and her backing musicians, Barry Reynolds and Ben Brierly (from Marianne Faithfull's band), and Doug Fieger (from The Knack). The music is beat-laden, sophisticated synth-pop, setting Was's detailed production against Cristina's expressive but sometimes less-than-perfect, cynical No Wave vocal style. At times the music is reminiscent of Blondie, or Madonna, and it does not forget the decadent disco of Crstina's eponymous debut. (opinion) Chris Connelly describes a record that is a "grimly hilarious gavotte through the upscale decadence of the titled apocalypso" with an effect "somewhere between Marianne Faithfull and the Flying Lizards with music more enjoyable than either".[tpl]cite journal|last=Connelly|first=Chris|title=Review of Sleep It Off|journal=Rolling Stone|year=1984[/tpl] 
The three cover songs on the record span a wide range: the R&B of Van Morrison's "Blue Money", Brecht and Weill's "Ballad of Immoral Earnings" from the Threepenny Opera, and John Conlee's country hit "She Can't Say that Anymore". (The bonus tracks on the CD release also include covers of Prince and Was (Not Was).)

==Sleeve==

The sleeve design is by Jean-Paul Goude, who later used a similar idea for Grace Jones's Slave to the Rhythm.
