[[No 6 mine]]

CATEGORIES: Anti-tank mines

The No 6 mine is an Israeli metal cased anti-tank blast mine. It is a direct copy of the Russian TM-46 mine, the only notable difference being the filling cap, which is domed on the TM-46 and flat on the No 6. It can be fitted with the No 61 pressure fuze or a No 62A tilt rod fuze. The mine is found in the Falkland Islands, Israel, Lebanon and Oman.
