[[Complex conjugate]]

CATEGORIES: Complex numbers

In mathematics, complex conjugates are a pair of complex numbers, both having the same real part, but with imaginary parts of equal magnitude and opposite signs.[tpl]MathWorld|ComplexConjugate|Complex Conjugates[/tpl][tpl]MathWorld|ImaginaryNumber|Imaginary Numbers[/tpl] For example, 3 + 4i and 3 âˆ’ 4i are complex conjugates.
For example,

==Properties==

These properties apply for all complex numbers z and w, unless stated otherwise, and can be proven by writing z and w in the form a + ib.
The latter formula is the method of choice to compute the inverse of a complex number if it is given in rectangular coordinates.

==Use as a variable==

These uses of the conjugate of z as a variable are illustrated in Frank Morley's book Inversive Geometry (1933), written with his son Frank Vigor Morley.

==Generalizations==

The other planar real algebras, dual numbers, and split-complex numbers are also explicated by use of complex conjugation.
Taking the conjugate transpose (or adjoint) of complex matrices generalizes complex conjugation. Even more general is the concept of adjoint operator for operators on (possibly infinite-dimensional) complex Hilbert spaces. All this is subsumed by the *-operations of C*-algebras.
Note that all these generalizations are multiplicative only if the factors are reversed: 
Since the multiplication of planar real algebras is commutative, this reversal is not needed there.
One example of this notion is the conjugate transpose operation of complex matrices defined above. It should be remarked that on generic complex vector spaces there is no canonical notion of complex conjugation.
