The UEFA Champions League [tpl]IPAc-en|juː|ˈ|eɪ|f|ə|_|ˈ|tʃ|æ|m|p|i|ən|z|_|ˈ|l|iː|g[/tpl], known simply as the Champions League, is an annual continental club football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) since 1992. It replaced the European Champion Clubs' Cup, or simply European Cup, which had run since 1955, adding a group stage to the competition and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries.[tpl]cite news |title=Football's premier club competition |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/history/index.html |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=31 January 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2010 [/tpl] It is one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football. The final of the 2012–13 tournament was the most watched UEFA Champions League final to date, as well as the most watched annual sporting event worldwide in 2013, drawing 360 million television viewers.[tpl]cite web |last=Chishti |first=Faisal |title=Champions League final at Wembley drew TV audience of 360 million |url=http://www.sportskeeda.com/2013/05/30/champions-league-final-at-wembley-drew-tv-audience-of-360-million/ |work=Sportskeeda |publisher=Absolute Sports Private Limited |accessdate=31 December 2013 |date=30 May 2013[/tpl]
Before 1992, the competition was officially called the "European Champion Clubs' Cup", but was usually referred to simply as the "European Cup". It was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champion club of each country. During the 1990s, the format was expanded, incorporating a round-robin group stage and more teams. Europe's strongest national leagues now provide up to four teams for the competition,[tpl]cite news |title=Clubs |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2012/clubs/country/index.html |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=31 January 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2010 [/tpl] and will provide up to five teams from the 2015–16 season onwards.[tpl]cite news |title=UEFA Europa League further strengthened for 2015–18 cycle |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/mediaservices/mediareleases/newsid=1956122.html |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=24 May 2013 |accessdate=2 August 2013 [/tpl]
In its present format, the UEFA Champions League begins in mid-July with three knockout qualifying rounds and a play-off round. The 10 surviving teams enter the group stage, joining 22 other teams qualified in advance. The 32 teams are drawn into eight groups of four teams and play each other in a double round-robin system. The eight group winners and eight runners-up proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in May.[tpl]cite news |title=Matches |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2012/matches/index.html |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=31 January 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2010 [/tpl] The winner of the UEFA Champions League qualifies for the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.[tpl]cite news |title=Club competition winners do battle |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefasupercup/history/index.html |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=31 January 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2010 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=FIFA Club World Cup |url=http://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/ |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association |accessdate=30 December 2013[/tpl]
Real Madrid is the most successful club in the competition's history, having won the tournament nine times, including its first five seasons. Spanish clubs have accumulated the highest number of victories (13 wins), followed by England and Italy (12 wins apiece). The competition has been won by 22 different clubs, 12 of which have won it more than once.[tpl]cite news |title=European Champions' Cup |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/ec1.html |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |date=31 January 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2010 [/tpl] Since the tournament changed name and structure in 1992, no club has managed consecutive wins; Milan were the last holders to successfully defend their title, in the 1989–90 season.[tpl]cite news |title=1989/90 European Champions Clubs' Cup |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1989/index.html |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=31 January 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2010 [/tpl] The reigning champions were Bayern Munich, who secured their fifth win in the competition after defeating Borussia Dortmund 2–1 in the 2013 Final."Robben ends Bayern's run of final misery".

==History==

The first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.[tpl]cite web |last1=García |first1=Javier |last2=Kutschera |first2=Ambrosius |last3=Schöggl |first3=Hans |last4=Stokkermans |first4=Karel |year=2009 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tableso/oost-habs-challenge.html |title=Austria/Habsburg Monarchy – Challenge Cup 1897–1911 |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |trans_title= |editor= |accessdate=5 September 2011 [/tpl] The Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927 by Zeid Edilbi and played between Central European clubs.[tpl]cite web |last1=Stokkermans |first1=Karel |year=2009 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesm/mit.html |title=Mitropa Cup |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation [/tpl] In 1930, the Coupe des Nations ([tpl]lang-fr|link=no|Nations Cup[/tpl]), the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was played and organised by Swiss club Servette.[tpl]cite web |last1=Ceulemans |first1=Bart |last2=Michiel |first2=Zandbelt |year=2009 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/coupedesnations30.html |title=Coupe des Nations 1930 |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |trans_title= |editor= |accessdate=5 September 2011 [/tpl] Held in Geneva, it brought together ten champions from across the continent. The tournament was won by Újpest of Hungary. Latin European nations came together to form the Latin Cup in 1949.[tpl]cite web |last1=Stokkermans |first1=Karel |last2=Gorgazzi |first2=Osvaldo José |year=2006 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesl/latin.html |title=Latin Cup |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |trans_title= |editor= |accessdate=5 September 2011 [/tpl] After receiving reports from his journalists over the highly successful Campeonato Sudamericano de Campeones of 1948, Gabriel Hanot, editor of L'Équipe, began proposing the creation of a continent-wide tournament.[tpl]cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=86xAxuxomoo&feature=related |title=Primeira Libertadores – História (Globo Esporte 09/02/20.l.08) |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=14 August 2010[/tpl] After the English press declared Wolverhampton Wanderers "Champions of the World" following a successful run of friendlies in the 1950s, Hanot finally managed to convince UEFA to put into practice such a tournament. It was conceived in Paris in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup.

===1955–1965: Beginnings===

The first edition of the European Cup took place during the 1955–56 season.[tpl]cite news |title=1955/56 European Champions Clubs' Cup |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1955/index.html |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=31 January 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2010 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=European Champions' Cup 1955–56 – Details |url=http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec195556det.html#cc |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |date=31 January 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2010 [/tpl] Sixteen teams participated: Milan (Italy), AGF Aarhus (Denmark), Anderlecht (Belgium), Djurgården (Sweden), Gwardia Warszawa (Poland), Hibernian (Scotland), Partizan (Yugoslavia), PSV (Netherlands), Rapid Wien (Austria), Real Madrid (Spain), Rot-Weiss Essen (West Germany), Saarbrücken (Saar), Servette (Switzerland), Sporting CP (Portugal), Stade de Reims (France), and Vörös Lobogó (Hungary). The first European Cup match took place on 4 September 1955, and ended in a 3–3 draw between Sporting CP and Partizan. The first goal in European Cup history was scored by João Baptista Martins of Sporting CP. The inaugural final took place at the Parc des Princes between Stade de Reims and Real Madrid.[tpl]cite news |title=Trofeos de Fútbol |url=http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/es/Club/1193040475224/PalmaresTotal/Palmares.htm |publisher=Real Madrid |date=31 January 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2010 [/tpl] The Spanish squad came back from behind to win 4–3 thanks to goals from Alfredo Di Stéfano and Marquitos, as well as two goals from Héctor Rial.
Real Madrid successfully defended the trophy next season in their home stadium, the Santiago Bernabéu, against Fiorentina.[tpl]cite news |title=1956/57 European Champions Clubs' Cup |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1956/index.html |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=31 January 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2010 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Champions' Cup 1956–57 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec195657det.html#cc |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |date=31 January 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2010 [/tpl] After a scoreless first half, Real Madrid scored twice in six minutes to defeat the Italians.

This was Real Madrid's fifth consecutive title, a record that still stands today.

==Anthem==

The UEFA Champions League anthem, officially titled simply as "Champions League", was written by Tony Britten, and is an adaptation of George Frideric Handel's Zadok the Priest (one of his Coronation Anthems).UEFA Champions League anthem UEFA.com. Retrieved 6 March 2011Media, democracy and European culture p.129. Intellect Books, 2009. Retrieved 6 March 2011 UEFA commissioned Britten in 1992 to arrange an anthem, and the piece was performed by London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and sung by the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. The chorus contains the three official languages used by UEFA: English, German, and French. The anthem's chorus is played before each UEFA Champions League game, as well as at the beginning and end of television broadcasts of the matches. The complete anthem is about three minutes long, and has two short verses and the chorus. For the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final in Rome, tenor Andrea Bocelli sang backing lyrics to the Champions League anthem, whilst similarly Juan Diego Flórez provided the tenor for the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final. Girl band All Angels performed at the 2011 UEFA Champions League Final. Jonas Kaufmann provided the tenor for 2012 UEFA Champions League Final, whilst David Garrett performed with his violin. The anthem has never been released commercially in its original version.

==Format==

===Qualification===

As of 2011, the UEFA Champions League commences with a double round-robin group stage of 32 teams, which is preceded by two qualification 'streams' for teams that do not receive direct entry to the tournament proper. The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing 2nd–4th in their national championship.
The number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the UEFA coefficients of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League and UEFA Europa League/UEFA Cup seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in.
Five of the remaining ten qualifying places are granted to the winners of a four round qualifying tournament between the remaining 39 or 38 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other five are granted to the winners of a two round qualifying tournament between the 15 clubs from the associations ranked 1 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, third, or fourth in their respective national league.
In addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions league. To obtain a license, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure, and finance requirements.
In 2005–06, Liverpool and Artmedia Bratislava became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds. In 2008–09, both BATE Borisov and Anorthosis Famagusta achieved the same feat. Manchester United holds the record for the most consecutive appearances in the group stage, having qualified 18 times, followed by Real Madrid with 17 and Arsenal with 16.http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2014/matches/round=2000478/match=2011748/prematch/preview/
Between 2003 and 2008, no differentiation was made between champions and non-champions in qualification. The 16 top ranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage. Prior to this, three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams, with different teams starting in different rounds.
An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/4613695.stm |title=Liverpool get in Champions League |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=10 June 2005 |accessdate=11 December 2007[/tpl] UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this means that if the Champions League winner falls outside of its domestic league's top four, it will qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. No association can have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind=64/newsid=698237.html?cid=rssfeed&att=index |title=EXCO approves new coefficient system |publisher=UEFA |date=20 May 2008 |accessdate=12 September 2010 |archivedate=21 May 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080521053931/http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind=64/newsid=698237.html?cid=rssfeed&att=index |deadurl=yes[/tpl] In May 2012, Tottenham Hotspur finished fourth in the Premier League, two places ahead of Chelsea, but failed to qualify for the 2012–13 Champions League, after Chelsea won the 2012 Champions League Final. Tottenham were demoted to the Europa League for the 2012–13 season.[tpl]cite news |title=Harry Redknapp and Spurs given bitter pill of Europa League by Chelsea |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/may/20/harry-redknapp-spurs-europa-league |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=20 May 2012 |accessdate=24 November 2012 [/tpl]
The top three leagues in Europe are currently allowed to enter four teams into the Champions League. Michel Platini, the UEFA president, had proposed taking one place from the top three leagues and allocating it to that nation's cup winners. This proposal was rejected in a vote at a UEFA Strategy Council meeting.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/11/13/sfnuef113.xml |title=Clubs force UEFA's Michel Platini into climbdown |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=13 November 2007 |accessdate=2 December 2007 |first=David |last=Bond[/tpl] In the same meeting, however, it was agreed that the third-placed team in the top four leagues would receive automatic qualification for the group stage, rather than entry into the third qualifying round, while the fourth-placed team would enter the play-off round for non-champions, guaranteeing an opponent from one of the top 15 leagues in Europe. This was part of Platini's plan to increase the number of teams qualifying directly into the group stage, while simultaneously increasing the number of teams from lower-ranked nations in the group stage.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7090646.stm |title=Platini's Euro Cup plan rejected |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=12 December 2007 |accessdate=11 December 2007[/tpl]

===Tournament===

The tournament proper begins with a group stage of 32 teams, divided into eight groups. Seeding is used whilst making the draw for this stage, whilst teams from the same country may not be drawn into groups together. Each team meets the others in its group home and away in a round-robin format. The winning team and the runners-up from each group then progress to the next round. The third-placed team enters the UEFA Europa League.
For this stage, the winning team from one group plays against the runners-up from another group, and teams from the same association may not be drawn against each other. From the quarter-finals onwards, the draw is entirely random, without association protection. The tournament uses the away goals rule: if the aggregate score of the two games is tied, then the team who scored more goals at their opponent's stadium advances.Regulations of the UEFA Champions League 2011/12, pg 10: http://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/competitions/Regulations/01/63/02/44/1630244_DOWNLOAD.pdf
The group stage is played through the autumn, whilst the knock-out stage starts after a winter break. The knock-out ties are played in a two-legged format, with the exception of the final. This is typically held in the final two weeks of May.

===Distribution (2013–14)===

Since the title holders (Bayern Munich) qualified for the Champions League group stage through their domestic league, the group stage spot reserved for the title holders is vacated, and the following changes to the default allocation system are made:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2014/accesslist/index.html|title=2013/14 UEFA Champions League access list|publisher=UEFA.com[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/access2013.html|title=Access list 2013/2014|publisher=Bert Kassies[/tpl]

==Referees==

===Ranking===

The UEFA Refereeing Unit is broken down into five experience-based categories. A referee is initially placed into Category 4 with the exception of referees from France, Germany, England, Italy, or Spain. Referees from these five countries are typically comfortable with top professional matches and are therefore directly placed into Category 3. Each referee's performance is observed and evaluated after every match; his category may be revised twice per season, but a referee cannot be promoted directly from Category 3 to the Elite Category.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/trainingground/referees/index.html |title=UEFA Referee |publisher=Uefa.com |date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2011[/tpl]

===Appointment===

In co-operation with the UEFA Refereeing Unit, the UEFA Referee Committee is responsible for appointing referees to matches. Referees are appointed based on previous matches, marks, performances, and fitness levels. To discourage bias, the Champions League takes nationality into account. No referee may be of the same origins as any club in his or her respecting groups. Referee appointments, suggested by the UEFA Refereeing Unit, are sent to the UEFA Referee Committee to be discussed and/or revised. After a consensus is made, the name of the appointed referee remains confidential up to two days before the match for the purpose of minimising public influence.

===Limitations===

Since 1990, a UEFA international referee cannot exceed the age of 45 years. After turning 45, a referee must step down at the end of his season. The age limit was established to ensure an elite level of fitness. Today, UEFA Champions League referees are required to pass a fitness test to even be considered at the international level.

==Prizes==

===Trophy and medals===

Each year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967. Any team that wins the Champions League three years in a row or five times overall wins the right to retain a full-sized replica of the trophy (UEFA retains the original at all times). Five clubs have earned this honour: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan and Liverpool.
The current trophy is [tpl]convert|74|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] tall and made of silver, weighing [tpl]convert|11|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]. It was designed by Jörg Stadelmann, a jeweller from Bern, Switzerland, after the original was given to Real Madrid in 1966 in recognition of their six titles to date, and cost 10,000 Swiss francs.
As of the 2012–13 season, 40 gold medals are presented to the Champions League winners, and 40 silver medals to the runners-up.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/competitions/Regulations/01/79/68/69/1796869_DOWNLOAD.pdf|title=2012/13 Season|work=Regulations of the UEFA Champions League: 2012–15 Cycle|publisher=UEFA|page=8|accessdate=22 September 2012[/tpl]

===Prize money===

As of 2012–13, UEFA awards €2.1 million to each team in the play-off round. For reaching the group stage, UEFA awards a base fee of €8.6 million. A win in the group is awarded €1 million and a draw is worth €500,000. In addition, UEFA pays teams reaching the first knockout round €3.5 million, each quarter-finalist €3.9 million, €4.9 million for each semi-finalist, €6.5 million for the runners-up and €10.5 million for the winners.[tpl]cite web |title=UEFA Champions League revenue distribution |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/management/finance/news/newsid=1845591.html |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=28 December 2012 [/tpl]
A large part of the distributed revenue from the UEFA Champions League is linked to the "market pool", the distribution of which is determined by the value of the television market in each country. For the 2012–13 season, Juventus, who were eliminated in the quarter-finals, earned nearly €65.3 million in total, of which €20.5 million was prize money, compared with the €55.0 million earned by Bayern Munich, who won the tournament and were awarded €35.9 million in prize money.[tpl]cite journal |date=July 2013 |title=Clubs benefit from Champions League revenue|journal=uefadirect |issue=1 |pages=1 |publisher=Union of European Football Associations|url=http://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/uefaorg/Finance/01/97/52/97/1975297_DOWNLOAD.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=26 July 2013[/tpl]

==Sponsorship==

Like the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations, in contrast to the single main sponsor typically found in national top-flight leagues. When the Champions League was created in 1992, it was decided that a maximum of eight companies should be allowed to sponsor the event, with each corporation being allocated four advertising boards around the perimeter of the pitch, as well as logo placement at pre- and post-match interviews and a certain number of tickets to each match. This, combined with a deal to ensure tournament sponsors were given priority on television advertisements during matches, ensured that each of the tournament's main sponsors was given maximum exposure.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Thompson |first1=Craig |last2=Magnus |first2=Ems |date=February 2003 |title=The Uefa Champions League Marketing |journal=Fiba Assist Magazine |pages=49–50 |url=http://www.ekospor.com/Sports-Marketing/Sport%20Marketing%20uefa.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=19 May 2008 [/tpl]
The advertising hoardings are a source of criticism, due to their larger size compared to those in other leagues such as the Premier League. Their larger size means that, at some grounds, such as Anfield, the Etihad Stadium, Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge, the front rows of seating cannot be used, as their views of the pitch are blocked by the extreme size of the boards; accordingly, some season ticket holders are not guaranteed tickets for games and have to sit in seats other than their usual ones for games.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Additionally, some stadiums use the flat area in front of the front rows of seating for wheelchairs and disabled seating, so the boards drastically reduce the disabled supporter capacity of these grounds.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] From the 2012–13 knockout phase, UEFA have utilised the LED advertising hoardings installed in most high-end stadia.  Traditional and, where available, static electronic hoardings are in use during the play-off rounds and the group stage.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
The tournament's current main sponsors are:
Adidas is a secondary sponsor and supplies the official match ball and referee uniform, as they do for all other UEFA competitions.
Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer is also a secondary sponsor as the official Champions League video game.
Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising, even if such sponsors conflict with those of the Champions League.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] However, only one sponsorship is permitted per jersey in addition to that of the kit manufacturer (exceptions are made for non-profit organisations, which can feature on the front of the shirt, incorporated with the main sponsor or in place of it; or on the back, either below the squad number or on the collar area.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Tech/uefaorg/General/01/75/63/78/1756378_DOWNLOAD.pdf |title=UEFA Kit Regulations Edition 2012 |publisher=UEFA |format=PDF |pages=37, 38 |accessdate=29 January 2014 [/tpl]
If clubs play a match in a country where the relevant sponsorship category is restricted (such as France's alcohol advertising restriction), then they must remove that logo from their jerseys. For example, when Rangers played French sides Auxerre and Strasbourg in the 1996–97 Champions League and the UEFA Cup, respectively, Rangers players wore the logo of Center Parcs instead of McEwan's Lager.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.truecoloursfootballkits.com/articles/an-alternative-to-alcohol|title=An alternative to alcohol|work=truecoloursfootballkits.com|publisher=True Colours|date=3 July 2009|last=Devlin|first=John|accessdate=5 June 2013|quote=Rangers have actually sported the Center Parcs logo during the course of two seasons.[/tpl]

==Media coverage==

The competition attracts an extensive television audience, not just in Europe, but throughout the world. The final of the tournament has been, in recent years, one of the most-watched annual sporting events in the world. With an estimated audience of 109 million people, the 2009 Champions League final surpassed that year's Super Bowl (106 million viewers), for the first time.[tpl]cite news |title=Champions League final tops Super Bowl for TV market |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8490351.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=31 January 2010 |accessdate=25 February 2010 [/tpl] The matches are broadcast in over 70 countries each year, with commentary provided in more than 40 languages.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]
