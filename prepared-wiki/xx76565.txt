[[Shadow congressperson]]

CATEGORIES: Home rule and voting rights of the District of Columbia, Legislative branch of the United States government

The offices of shadow U.S. Representative and shadow U.S. Senator are elective offices in the District of Columbia. While the holders of these offices are not seated in either house of the United States Congress, they promote the District's efforts to gain full voting rights. Historically, shadow congressmen were elected by organized incorporated territories prior to their admission to the Union.[tpl]cite web|title=A Brief History of the Shadow Senators of the United States|first=Paul|last=Strauss|authorlink=Paul Strauss|work=The Honorable Paul Strauss – United States Senator for the District of Columbia|url=http://senatordc.wdcnet.net/history.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030211130256/http://senatordc.wdcnet.net/history.html|archivedate=February 11, 2003[/tpl] The name was based on the traditional practice of the Official Opposition appointing shadow cabinets in parliamentary systems.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl]
The first shadow senators, William Blount and William Cocke of the Southwest Territory, were elected in March 1796, before being seated as senators representing the newly formed state of Tennessee. Michigan, California, Minnesota, Oregon, and Alaska likewise elected shadow senators before statehood. The Alaska Territory also elected the first shadow U.S. Representative, Ralph Julian Rivers, in 1956. All were eventually seated in Congress as voting members, except for Alaska Shadow Sen. William A. Egan, who instead became governor. The election of shadow congresspersons from the District of Columbia is authorized by a "state" constitution, which was ratified by D.C. voters in 1982 but was never approved by Congress.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/28/AR2008052802976.html|title=D.C.
