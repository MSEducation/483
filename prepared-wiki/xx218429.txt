[[Tablature]]

CATEGORIES: Musical notation

Tablature (or tabulature, or tab for short) is a form of musical notation indicating instrument fingering rather than musical pitches.
Tablature is common for fretted stringed instruments such as the lute, vihuela, or guitar, as well as many free reed aerophones such as the harmonica.  Tablature was common during the Renaissance and Baroque eras, and is commonly used in notating rock, pop, folk, ragtime, bluegrass, and blues music.
Three types of organ tablature were used in Europe: German, Spanish and Italian.  There are several types of ocarina tabulature.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hindocarina.com/enjoy/fingering.shtml |title=ocarina tabulature |publisher=Hindocarina.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-16[/tpl]
To distinguish standard musical notation from tablature, the former is usually called "staff notation" or just "notation".
An alternate usage of the word "tab" is common on the Internet, where it can also refer to conventional chord symbols (for harmony), or note names (for melody).

==Tablature==

===Etymology===

The word tablature originates from the Latin word tabulatura. Tabula is a table or slate, in Latin. To tabulate something means to put it into a table or chart.

===Origin===

The first known occurrence in Europe is around 1300, and was first used for notating music for the organ.See Willi Apel's book on music notation, The Notation of Polyphonic Music  (1942), for a fuller history.[tpl]Page needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]

==Concepts==

While standard notation represents the rhythm and duration of each note and its pitch relative to the scale based on a twelve tone division of the octave, tablature is instead operationally based, indicating where and when a finger should be placed to generate a note, so pitch is denoted implicitly rather than explicitly. Tablature for plucked strings is based upon a diagrammatic representation of the strings and frets of the instrument, keyboard tablature represents the keys of the instrument, and woodwind tablature shows whether each of the fingerholes is to be closed or left open.

===Advantages and disadvantages compared to standard notation===

Tablature is more easily read by a novice musician but it has some significant deficiencies compared to standard notation.

Lowercase letters or "glyphs"are placed on each of these lines to represent notes. If it is required to play an open D course, for instance, a small a will be placed on the appropriate line. For a note with the finger on the first fret a b, a note on the second fret a c, etc. However, as mentioned above, j was not used since it was not considered a separate letter from i, and c often looked more like r. Thus:
 F_c___
 D_a___
A_b___
F_c___
D_a___
A_b___
G - a
would represent a G-minor chord,
All open strings would represent a D-minor chord:

D- ///a
The strings below the sixth course are notated with additional short ledger lines: glyphs are placed below the staff. These courses are tuned in accordance with the key of each piece played:
 G- a
 F- /a
E- //a
D- ///a
C- 4
B- 5
A- 6

==German lute tablature==

The origins of German lute tablature can be traced back well into the 15th century. Blind organist Conrad Paumann is said to have invented it.Sebastian Virdung, Musica getutscht (Basel 1511), and Martin Agricola, Musica instrumentalis deudsch (Wittenberg 1529), quoted in: Oswald Körte, Laute und Lautenmusik bis zur Mitte des 16. Jahrhunderts. Unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der deutschen Lautentabulatur (Publikationen der Internationalen Musikgesellschaft. Beihefte 3. Leipzig: Breitkopf und Härtel, 1901), 76 seq. It was used in German-speaking countries until the end of the 16th century.

==Computer programs for writing tablatures==

See List of guitar tablature software
Various computer programs are available for writing tablature; some also write lyrics, guitar chord diagrams, chord symbols, and/or staff notation. ASCII tab files can be written (somewhat laboriously) with any ordinary word processor or text editor.

==Guitar tablature==

The following examples are labelled with letters on the left denoting the string names, with a lowercase e for the high E string. Tab lines may be numbered 1 through 6 instead, representing standard string numbering, where "1" is the high E string, "2" is the B string, etc.
The numbers that are written on the lines represent the fret used to obtain the desired pitch. For example, the number 3 written on the top line of the staff indicates that the player should press down at the third fret on the high E (first string). Number 0 denotes the nut — that is, an open string.
For chords, a letter above or below the tablature staff denotes the root note of the chord.
Examples of guitar tablature notation:
The chords E, F, and G:
 e|---0---1---3---
 B|---0---1---0---
G|---1---2---0---
D|---2---3---0---
A|---2---3---2---
E|---0---1---3---
     E   F   G</pre>
Tablature can use various lines, arrows, and other symbols to denote bends, hammer-ons, trills, pull-offs, slides, and so on. These are the tablature symbols that represent various techniques, though these may vary:
Guitar tablature is not standardized and different sheet-music publishers adopt different conventions. Songbooks and guitar magazines usually include a legend setting out the convention in use.
The most common form of lute tablature uses the same concept but differs in the details (e.g., it uses letters rather than numbers for frets). See below.
When circles are used to indicate fingering, sounded notes are white, an assumed root is grey, and a sounded root is black.Latarski, Don (1999). Ultimate Guitar Chords: First Chords, p.5. ISBN 978-0-7692-8522-1.Don Latarski, Aaron Stang (1993). Practical Theory for Guitar, p.6-7. ISBN 978-0-89898-692-1.

==Musette tablature==

The standard notation shown in the illustration is also taken from de Scellery; no explanation is given for the slur-like symbol; the comma , is explained as indicating a tremblement, starting on the note above. No explanation is given for the unusual beaming or the significance (if any) of where note-length symbols are repeated.

==Harmonica tablature==

For example, on a "C" diatonic instrument:
 Unbent    Bent lv1    Bent lv2    Bent  lv3
 3i (B)    3i|  (Bb)   3i|| (A)    3i||| (G#)
To indicate button-press on a chromatic instrument, a similar indication to first-level bending may be used.
The breath indicator may be placed right next to the hole number, or below the number. The same is true for bending or button-press indicators.
To indicate the beat, in the arrow system the length of the arrow may be varied. However, the more popular method is to use a slightly simplified rhythm-symbol notation, such as "o" for a semibreve, // for a minim, "/" for a crotchet, "." for quavers, and place them above the characters, while spacing them accordingly.
For chords, the numbers to play are shown, so, for example:
a C major (CEG) chord (on a C diatonic instrument): 456e
However, they may simplify it, especially when playing blues. For chords, it was common to just play three or two holes instead (sometimes even just one), especially when the instrument is not of the same key. For example, in the blues progression in G (G G G G7 C C G G D7 D7 G G) it is common to use a C diatonic instrument, and notate the following:
There are many harmonica tablature systems in use. The easiest tablature system works like this.
Diatonic Harmonica tablature
  2  = blow the 2 hole
 -2  = draw the 2 hole
-2' = draw the 2 hole with a half bend
-2" = draw the 2 hole with a full bend
chords are shown by grouping notes with parentheses
(2 3) = blow the 2 hole and the 3 hole at the same time
Chromatic Harmonica tablature
   2 = blow the 2 hole
  -2 = draw the 2 hole
 <2 = blow the 2 hole with the button in

Here is an example of harmonica tablature:
"Mack the Knife"
C Diatonic
 5   6   -6   -6   5  6   -6     -6
 Oh the shark has pretty teeth, dear
-4  -5  -6    -6  -4 -5   -6
And he shows them pearly white
 6  -7  -8    7   -7   -6  7     -4
Just a jack knife has MacHeath, dear
 5  -5   7   -4  7  -7  -6
And he keeps it out of sight

==Legal issues==

By early 2006, an unprecedented legal move was taken by the Music Publishers' Association (MPA), initiating legal action against tablature websites that hosted interpretations of songs and music. The MPA had been pushing for websites offering free tablatures to be shut down. MPA president Lauren Keiser said that their goal is for owners of free tablature services to face fines and even imprisonment.[tpl]cite web|last=Youngs |first=Ian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4508158.stm |title=BBC report |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-12-12 |accessdate=2011-12-16[/tpl] Several websites that offered free tablature have taken their tablature off-line until a solution or compromise is found. One of the proposed solutions is an alternative compensation system, which allows the widespread reproduction of digital copyrighted works while still paying songwriters and copyright owners. In addition, there are now a number of "legal" services offering guitar tablature that have been licensed by music publishers.[tpl]cite web|author=by Dave on August 5th, 2008 |url=http://www.fretbase.com/fretbase/2008/08/can-guitar-tabl.html |title=Fretbase, Can Guitar Tablature Go Legit? |publisher=Fretbase.com |date=2008-08-05 |accessdate=2011-12-16[/tpl]
One site, MetalTabs.com, contacts the bands themselves for permission to post tablature. Few bands have declined the request.[tpl]cite web|url=http://metaltabs.com/ |title=metaltabs.com |publisher=metaltabs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-16[/tpl]
The tablature debate was featured on NPR's Morning Edition in a segment entitled "Music Industry Goes after Guitar Tablature Websites" on August 7, 2006.[tpl]cite web|last=Arnold |first=Chris |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5622879 |title=NPR report |publisher=Npr.org |date=2006-08-07 |accessdate=2011-12-16[/tpl]
On April 10, 2010, Ultimate Guitar (UG), a Russia-based, free on-line tablature site, entered a licensing agreement with Harry Fox Agency.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.harryfox.com/public/userfiles/file/PressReleases/HFAUltimateGuitar_20100406_Final.pdf |title=harryfox.com |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-16[/tpl] The agreement included rights for lyrics display, title search and tablature display with download and print capabilities. HFA’s over 44,000 represented publishers have the opportunity to opt into the licensing arrangement with UG.

===Rise of legal guitar tablature sites===

In light of the legal questions surrounding user-created on-line guitar tablature, a number of companies have been formed that claim to offer consumers legal on-line tablature, which has been officially-licensed from songwriters and/or music publishers. These companies offering legal content generally fall into three categories:

===Mxtabs.net===

Mxtabs.net had been closed down because of complaints from copyright holders. However, as of February 23, 2006, the owners of Mxtabs put the website back on-line with a letter explaining their position. In short, they believe that the purpose of Mxtabs is to "aid musicians in learning their instruments". They say that Mxtabs has accounted for as much as $3000 a month in sheet music sales, and offers many tablatures that do not have equivalent sheet music published, so Mxtabs and similar sites are the only place that musicians can find a way to play these songs (other than figuring the songs out for themselves). The letter concludes by pointing out that tablatures have never been proven to be illegal, then requesting that sheet-music companies contact Mxtabs in order to create a system of tablature licensing.
On February 29, 2008, MXTabs.net relaunched as the first legitimately licensed site designed to provide musicians with access to free tablatures, while also compensating music publishers and songwriters for their intellectual property. As with other user generated content sites, MXTabs.net users are encouraged to create, edit, rate, and review their own tablature interpretations of their favourite songs. However, unlike other user-generated content sites, only songs that have received explicit permission from participating copyright owners will be made available on-line.

===Guitar Tab Universe===

On 17 July 2006, Guitar Tab Universe (GTU) posted a letter on its home page that its ISP had been jointly threatened with legal action by the National Music Publishers Association (NMPA) and the MPA "on the basis that sharing tablature constitutes copyright infringement".Guitar Tab Universe letter.
In response, GTU's site owner(s) immediately created a website named Music Student and Teacher Organization (MuSATO) to attempt to reposition themselves from an illegal-copyrighted-materials provider to an "education provider". MuSATO's main objective is to use fair use as their rationale to publish tablature free of charge. By claiming to be an educational provider, they do not have to obtain publication rights nor pay royalties to the original composers. MuSATO claims to be educational by classifying users downloading tablatures as "music students" and transcribers as "music teachers".
GuitarTabs.com has been contacted by the NMPA and MPA with similar copyright infringement allegations. The NMPA and MPA have also threatened Guitar Tab Universe with similar legal action. A copy of the certified letter received by the site owner, along with a brief note similar to the one posted on Mxtabs, has been posted on their website.Guitar Tab Universe MPA allegations.

===OLGA.net===

The On-line Guitar Archive (OLGA)—OLGA.net is another tablature site that has been removed after receiving letters from lawyers representing the NMPA and the MPA.[ref][tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.olga.net/ |title=The On-line Guitar Archive |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120524070949/http://www.olga.net/ |archivedate=May 24, 2012 |accessdate=June 11, 2012[/tpl]
 OLGA is currently offline while we attempt to resolve legal issues with the archive. 

 We received a 'take down' letter (pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 ) from lawyers representing the NMPA and the MPA. 

 We greatly appreciate your support and hope to return to providing resources to the aspiring guitarist as soon as possible. Contact rcwoods for more information. In the meantime, we recommend the usenet newsgroups rec.music.makers.guitar.tablature and alt.guitar.tab. [/ref]
