The 2000s, usually pronounced "two thousands",[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] was a decade that began on January 1, 2000, and ended on December 31, 2009.
The decade generally continued the technological and socioeconomic changes that started in the 1980s and accelerated in the 1990s. These changes had ended during the Great Recession. Globalization had accelerated in the 1990s after the fall of Communism and continued to be a force in the 2000s. Geopolitically, the century opened with the United States enjoying an economic peak that bestowed hegemonic political and military preeminence, a status that is quickly eroding. The growth of China's economic, military, cultural and scientific power confirms this. Also, China is going through many reforms that are changing the image of China's human rights record.
The growth of the Internet was one of the prime contributors to globalization during the decade, making it possible for people to interact with other people, express ideas, introduce others to different cultures and backgrounds, use goods and services, sell and buy online, and research and learn.Ludden D (1998).

==Names for the decade==

In the English-speaking world, a name for the decade was never universally accepted in the same manner as for decades such as the '80s, the '90s, etc.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews_deca/ynews_deca_ts1010 |first=Leah |last=Hitchings |title=Even with 10 years to decide, still no name for the decade |publisher=News.yahoo.com |date=December 8, 2000 |accessdate=February 13, 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theweek.com/article/index/103534/Why_cant_we_name_this_decade |title=Why can't we name this decade? |publisher=Theweek.com |date=November 30, 2009 |accessdate=February 13, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8436194.stm |work=BBC News | title=Decade dilemma | date=December 31, 2009 | accessdate=April 21, 2010 | first=Finlo | last=Rohrer[/tpl]
Orthographically, the decade can be written as the "2000s" or the "'00s". Some people read "2000s" as "two-thousands", and thus simply refer to the decade as the "Two-Thousands", the "Twenty Hundreds", or the "Twenty-ohs". Some read it as the "00s" (pronounced "Ohs", "Oh Ohs", "Double Ohs" or "Ooze"), while others referred to it as the "Zeros".Washington Examiner, December 1, 2009; modified March 16, 2012. Say goodbye to the aughts, zeros, 2000s, whatever. retrieved March 1, 2013. The single years within the decade are usually referred to as starting with an "Oh", such as "Oh-Seven" to refer to the year 2007.

A United States-led coalition invaded Iraq, and the Iraq war led to the end of Saddam Hussein's rule as Iraqi President and the Ba'ath Party in Iraq. Al-Qaeda and affiliated Islamist militant groups performed terrorist acts throughout the decade. These acts included the 2004 Madrid train bombings, 7/7 London bombings in 2005, and the Mumbai attacks related to al-Qaeda in 2008. The European Union expanded its sanctions amid Iran's failure to comply with its transparency obligations under the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty and UN resolutions.
The War on Terror generated extreme controversy around the world, with questions regarding the justification for U.S. actions leading to a loss of support for the American government, both in and outside the United States.[tpl]cite news | title = U.S. Losing War on Terror | publisher=NPR | date=August 21, 2007|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13818670|accessdate = June 1, 2010[/tpl] Additional armed conflict occurred in the Middle East, including between Israel and Hezbollah, then with Israel and the Hamas. The greatest loss of life due to natural disaster came from the 2004 tsunami, killing around a quarter-million people and displacing well over a million others. Cooperative international rescue missions by many countries from around the world helped in efforts by the most affected nations to rebuild and recover from the devastation. An enormous loss of life and property value came in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina flooded nearly the entire city of New Orleans. The resulting political fallout was severely damaging to the George W. Bush administration because of its perceived failure to act promptly and effectively. In 2008, Barack Obama was elected President of the United States and became the first African-American U.S. president when he succeeded Bush in 2009.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/obama_inauguration/7839229.stm |title=Historic moment as Obama sworn in |publisher=BBC News |date=January 20, 2009 |accessdate=February 13, 2012[/tpl]

The fact that over 800 men, women and children have been killed in horrific suicide bombings and other terror attacks clearly justifies the attempt to place a physical barrier in the path of terrorists. It should be noted that terrorism has been defined throughout the international community as a crime against humanity. As such, the State of Israel not only has the right but also the obligation to do everything in its power to lessen the impact and scope of terrorism on the citizens of Israel.

[/ref] in June 2002 Israel began the construction of the West Bank Fence along the Green Line border arguing that the barrier is necessary to protect Israeli civilians from Palestinian terrorism. The significantly reduced number of incidents of suicide bombings from 2002 to 2005 has been partly attributed to the barrier. The barrier's construction, which has been highly controversial, became a major issue of contention between the two sides. The Second Intifada has caused thousands of victims on both sides, both among combatants and among civilians – The death toll, including both military and civilian, is estimated to be 5,500 Palestinians and over 1,000 Israelis, as well as 64 foreign citizens.B'Tselem – Statistics – Fatalities, B'Tselem.

====Tropical cyclones, other weather, and bushfires====

====Epidemics====

Antibiotic resistance is a serious and growing phenomenon in contemporary medicine and has emerged as one of the eminent public health concerns of the 21st century, particularly as it pertains to pathogenic organisms (the term is not especially relevant to organisms which don't cause disease in humans).
The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom in 2001 caused a crisis in British agriculture and tourism. This epizootic saw 2,000 cases of the disease in farms across most of the British countryside. Over 10 million sheep and cattle were killed.
Between November 2002 and July 2003, an outbreak of Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in Hong Kong, with 8,273 cases and 775 deaths worldwide (9.6% fatality) according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Within weeks, SARS spread from Hong Kong to infect individuals in 37 countries in early 2003.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: the Office for National Statistics reported 1,629 MRSA-related deaths in England and Wales during 2005, indicating a MRSA-related mortality rate half the rate of that in the United States for 2005, even though the figures from the British source were explained to be high because of "improved levels of reporting, possibly brought about by the continued high public profile of the disease" during the time of the 2005 United Kingdom General Election. MRSA is thought to have caused 1,652 deaths in 2006 in UK up from 51 in 1993.
The 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) flu pandemic is also considered a natural disaster. On October 25, 2009 U.S. President Barack Obama officially declared H1N1 a national emergency[tpl]cite web | title=Obama declares swine flu a national emergency |url=http://heraldextra.com/news/national/article_a4de47bf-1dd4-52ea-9f2d-db535ba581b4.html | publisher=The Daily Herald | year=2009 | accessdate=October 26, 2009| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091029080742/http://www.heraldextra.com/news/national/article_a4de47bf-1dd4-52ea-9f2d-db535ba581b4.html| archivedate=29 October 2009[/tpl] Despite President Obama's concern, a Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll found in October 2009 that an overwhelming majority of New Jerseyans (74%) were not very worried or not at all worried about contracting the H1N1 flu virus.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://publicmind.fdu.edu/h1n1/release.pdf |title=New Jersewans not worried about H1N1 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University |date=October 8, 2009 |accessdate=February 13, 2012[/tpl]
A study conducted in coordination with the University of Michigan Health Service is scheduled for publication in the December 2009 American Journal of Roentgenology warning that H1N1 flu can cause pulmonary embolism, surmised as a leading cause of death in this current pandemic. The study authors suggest physician evaluation via contrast enhanced CT scans for the presence of pulmonary emboli when caring for patients diagnosed with respiratory complications from a "severe" case of the H1N1 flu.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mollura DJ, Asnis DS, Crupi RS, et al. |title=Imaging findings in a fatal case of pandemic swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=193 |issue=6 |pages=1500–3 |date=December 2009 |pmid=19933640 |pmc=2788497 |doi=10.2214/AJR.09.3365 |url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=19933640| accessdate=November 30, 2011 |ref=harv[/tpl]

Footnote:
The Walkerton Tragedy is a series of events that accompanied the contamination of the water supply of Walkerton, Ontario, Canada, by E. coli bacteria in May 2000.
Starting May 11, 2000, many residents of the community of about 5,000 people began to simultaneously experience bloody diarrhea, gastrointestinal infections and other symptoms of E. coli infection.
Seven people died directly from drinking the E. coli contaminated water, who might have been saved if the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission had admitted to contaminated water sooner, and about 2,500 became ill.
In 2001 a similar outbreak in North Battleford, Saskatchewan caused by the protozoan Cryptosporidium affected at least 5,800 people.

==Economics==

The most significant evolution of the early 2000s in the economic landscape was the long-time predicted breakthrough of economic giant China, which had double-digit growth during nearly the whole decade. To a lesser extent, India also benefited from an economic boom[tpl]cite news|title=India Reaps Benefits of Economic Boom |date=November 2, 2006 | publisher=CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/11/01/india.economy/index.html |accessdate=November 30, 2011[/tpl] which saw the two most populous countries becoming an increasingly dominant economic force.[tpl]cite web |title=A New World Economy |work=Bloomberg Business Week | date=August 22, 2005 | accessdate=June 1, 2011 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_34/b3948401.htm | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110522173400/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_34/b3948401.htm| archivedate=22 May 2011[/tpl]  The rapid catching-up of emerging economies with developed countries sparked some protectionist tensions during the period and was partly responsible for an increase in energy and food prices at the end of the decade. The economic developments in the latter third of the decade were dominated by a worldwide economic downturn, which started with the crisis in housing and credit in the United States in late 2007, and led to the bankruptcy of major banks and other financial institutions.[tpl]cite web|title=Iceland goes bankrupt |author=BusinessWeek |url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2008/10/iceland_goes_ba.html| archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5iStJVnPf|archivedate=July 22, 2009 |deadurl=no|accessdate=July 19, 2009[/tpl] The outbreak of this global financial crisis sparked a global recession, beginning in the United States and affecting most of the industrialized world.
The period takes its name from Gordon Brown, the then UK Chancellor of the Exchequer (who later became Prime Minister), who decided to sell approximately half of the UK's gold reserves in a series of auctions. At the time, the UK's gold reserves were worth about US$6.5 billion, accounting for about half of the UK's US$13 billion foreign currency net reserves.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/GoldReserves.PDF|date=October 2002|title=Review of the sale of part of the UK gold reserves|publisher=HM Treasury|ref=harv|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl]

Between 1999 to 2009, according to the World Bank statistics for GDP:[tpl]cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/GDP.pdf |title=The World Bank: World Development Indicators database, 1 July 2009.

===Globalization and its discontents===

The removal of trade and investment barriers, the growth of domestic markets, artificially low currencies, the proliferation of education, the rapid development of high tech and information systems industries and the growth of the world economy lead to a significant growth of offshore outsourcing during the decade as many multinational corporations significantly increased subcontracting of manufacturing (and increasingly, services) across national boundaries in developing countries and particularly in China and India, due to many benefits and mainly because the two countries which are the two most populous countries in the world provide huge pools from which to find talent and as because both countries are low cost sourcing countries. As a result of this growth, many of these developing countries accumulated capital and started investing abroad. Other countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Brazil and Russia, benefited from increased demand for their mineral and energy resources that global growth generated. The hollowing out of manufacturing was felt in Japan and parts of the United States and Europe which had not been able to develop successful innovative industries. Opponents point out that the practice of offshore outsourcing by countries with higher wages leads to the reduction of their own domestic employment and domestic investment. As a result, many customer service jobs as well as jobs in the information technology sectors (data processing, computer programming, and technical support) in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have been or are potentially affected.
While global trade rose in the decade (partially driven by China's entry into the WTO in 2001), there was little progress in the multilateral trading system. International trade continued to expand during the decade as emerging economies and developing countries, in particular China and South-Asian countries, benefited low wages costs and most often undervalued currencies. However, global negotiations to reduce tariffs did not make any progress, as member countries of the World Trade Organization did not succeed in finding agreements to stretch the extent of free trade.EFE Fracasan las negociaciones de la Ronda de Doha para liberalizar el comercio July 28, 2008, ABC (Spain) The Doha Round of negotiations, launched in 2001 by the WTO to promote development, failed to be completed because of growing tensions between regional areas.

The comparative rise of China, India, and other developing countries also contributed to their growing clout in international fora. In 2009, it was determined that the G20, originally a forum of finance ministers and central bank governors, would replace the G8 as the main economic council.
2007 Chinese export recalls
In 2007 a series of product recalls and import bans were imposed by the product safety institutions of the United States, Canada, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand against products manufactured in and exported from the mainland of the People's Republic of China (PRC) because of numerous alleged consumer safety issues.
Events in the confidence crisis included recalls on consumer goods such as pet food, toys, toothpaste, lipstick, and a ban on certain types of seafood. Also included are reports on the poor crash safety of Chinese automobiles, slated to enter the American and European markets in 2008. This created adverse consequences for the confidence in the safety and quality of mainland Chinese manufactured goods in the global economy.

===The age of turbulence===

The decade was marked by two financial and economic crises. In 2000, the Dot-com bubble burst, causing turmoil in financial markets and a decline in economic activity in the developed economies, in particular in the United States.BBC Mundo, Se contrae la economía mundial November 21, 2001 However, the impact of the crisis on the activity was limited thanks to the intervention of the central banks, notably the U.S. Federal Reserve System. Indeed, Alan Greenspan, leader of the Federal Reserve until 2006, cut the interest rates several times to avoid a severe recession,BBC Mundo, ¿Recesión global?, September 8, 2001 allowing an economic revival in the U.S.Agence France Presse Greenspan dijo que las tasas se mantienen bajas, La Nación, February 16, 2005
As the Federal Reserve maintained low interest rates to favor economic growth, a housing bubble began to appear in the United States. In 2007, the rise in interest rates and the collapse of the housing market caused a wave of loan payment failures in the U.S. The subsequent mortgage crisis caused a global financial crisis, because the subprime mortgages had been securitized and sold to international banks and investment funds.

===Energy crisis===

From the mid-1980s to September 2003, the inflation-adjusted price of a barrel of crude oil on NYMEX was generally under $25/barrel. During 2003, the price rose above $30, reached $60 by August 11, 2005, and peaked at $147.30 in July 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tfc-charts.com/chart/QM/W |title=Weekly Commodity Futures Price Chart: Crude Oil EmiNY |publisher=TFC-charts.com |accessdate=February 14, 2012[/tpl] Commentators attributed these price increases to many factors, including reports from the United States Department of Energy and others showing a decline in petroleum reserves, worries over peak oil, Middle East tension, and oil price speculation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,556519,00.html |first=Moira |last=Herbst |title=Speculation – But Not Manipulation |work=Der Spiegel  |date=May 30, 2008 |accessdate=February 14, 2012[/tpl]
For a time, geopolitical events and natural disasters indirectly related to the global oil market had strong short-term effects on oil prices. These events and disasters included North Korean missile tests, the 2006 conflict between Israel and Lebanon, worries over Iranian nuclear plants in 2006 and Hurricane Katrina. By 2008, such pressures appeared to have an insignificant impact on oil prices given the onset of the global recession. The recession caused demand for energy to shrink in late 2008 and early 2009 and the price plunged as well. However, it surged back in May 2009, bringing it back to November 2008 levels.Yahoo Finance[tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl] [tpl]WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5glwc7hoY|date = May 14, 2009| accessdate=November 30, 2011[/tpl]
Many fast-growing economies throughout the world, especially in Asia, also were a major factor in the rapidly increasing demand for fossil fuels, which—along with fewer new petroleum finds, greater extraction costs, and political turmoil—forced two other trends: a soar in the price of petroleum products and a push by governments and businesses to promote the development of environmentally friendly technology (known informally as "green" technology). However, a side-effect of the push by some industrial nations to "go green" and utilize biofuels was a decrease in the supply of food and a subsequent increase in the price of the same. It partially caused the 2007 food price crisis, which seriously affected the world's poorer nations with an even more severe shortage of food.Global Policy Global Policy Forum, Are We Approaching a Global Food Crisis?

===The rise of the Euro===

A common currency for most E.U.member states, the euro, was established electronically in 1999, officially tying all the currencies of each participating nation to each other. The new currency was put into circulation in 2002 and the old currencies were phased out. Only three countries of the then 15 member states decided not to join the euro (The United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden). In 2004 the E.U.undertook a major eastward enlargement, admitting 10 new member states (eight of which were former communist states). Two more, Bulgaria and Romania, joined in 2007, establishing a union of 27 nations.
The euro has since become the second largest reserve currency and the second most traded currency in the world after the US$.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/publ/rpfxf07t.pdf |title=Triennial Central Bank Survey 2007 – BIS – December 2007 |publisher=BIS |date=December 19, 2007 |accessdate=July 25, 2009[/tpl]
