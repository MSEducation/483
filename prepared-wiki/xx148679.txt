"Private Emotion" is a pop song written by Eric Bazilian and Rob Hyman and originally recorded by The Hooters, for their 1993 album, Out of Body. The song was picked up by Ricky Martin and included on his Ricky Martin album. It was released as a single on February 8, 2000 and featured Swedish singer Meja. As Turkey was one of the countries where Martin's popularity was at its peak, Ricky Martin sings the song with Sertab Erener instead of Meja in the Turkish edition of the album. 
The Australian maxi-single includes "Almost a Love Song", which is an English version of Martin's song "Casi un Bolero", taken from the Grammy-winning album Vuelve.
