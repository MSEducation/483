The South African Class GG 2-6-2+2-6-2 of 1925 is a South African steam locomotive from the 
South African Railways era.
In 1925 the South African Railways placed a single Class GG Garratt articulated steam locomotive with a 2-6-2+2-6-2 "Double Prairie" wheel arrangement in fast main line passenger service.

==Manufacturers==

The Class GG 2-6-2+2-6-2 Garratt locomotive was a development of the Class GB that was designed for the South African Railways (SAR) with large driving wheels for fast passenger service on main line duties. A single locomotive, number 2290, was delivered from Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1925. It was superheated, with a plate frame, a Belpaire firebox and Walschaerts valve gear. The Class GG was the only Garratt locomotive on the SAR that was intended primarily for passenger working.

==Characteristics==

The Class GG had the largest driving wheels yet seen on a Garratt locomotive in South Africa. An innovation was a coal pusher at the back of the coal bunker, designed to ease the work of the fireman by pushing the coal forward to the front of the bunker, as required. It was, however, the only instance of this appliance being used on any SAR locomotive.
In order to keep costs down, the cylinders were not enlarged to compensate for the increased wheel diameter, with the result that its tractive effort was inferior to that of the Class 15CA that was introduced on the same line a year later.
It was capable of speeds of [tpl]convert|57|mph|km/h|0|abbr=off[/tpl], but it was found to be unsteady at high speed due to the absence of a leading bogie on each engine unit. It could handle a load of [tpl]convert|1245|LT|t|0|abbr=off[/tpl] on 1 in 80 gradients and hauled [tpl]convert|340|LT|t|0|abbr=off[/tpl] in sixty-two minutes up the [tpl]convert|15|mi|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] of 1 in 40 gradient of the Hex River Pass without the help of a banking locomotive.

==Service==

It was initially placed in service at Touws River and employed to work the Union Limited and Union Express fast passenger trains south of De Aar, but because of its unsteadiness at speed it was taken off fast passenger traffic and demoted to ordinary passenger and goods train working out of Cape Town. No more Class GG locomotives were ordered and since it was a non-standard locomotive, it was staged by 1938 and scrapped in 1947.
