It is also reported to have occasionally worked with the Iranian opposition group, the People's Mujahedin of Iran.[tpl]cite news |title=Jailbird Saddam’s Overseas Profits Roll in, Lubricate Guerrilla War |url=http://www.debka-net-weekly.com/issue.pl?username=&inumber=144 |publisher=DEBKA-Net-Weekly |date=2004-02-06 |accessdate=2008-01-21[/tpl]  The last known director for Directorate 14 was  Muhammad Khudayr Sabah Al Dulaymi, and according to the Iraqi National Congress, was previously led by Brig Nouri Al Douri (Abu Ibrahim) from Jadriya.[tpl]cite web |title=The Structure of the Mukhabarat or Iraqi Intelligence Service |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iraq/1998/iisstructure.htm |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |work=Iraqi National Congress Reports |date=1998-03 |accessdate=2008-01-21[/tpl]
Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Directorate 14 was entrusted with oversight of the Challenge Project.  According to the Iraq Survey Group report:
 M14, directed by Muhammad Khudayr Sabah Al Dulaymi, was responsible for training and conducting special operations missions. It trained Iraqis, Palestinians, Syrians, Yemeni, Lebanese, Egyptian, and Sudanese operatives in counterterrorism, explosives, marksmanship, and foreign operations at its facilities at Salman Pak. Additionally, M14 oversaw the “Challenge Project,” a highly secretive project regarding explosives. Sources to date have not been able to provide sufficient details regarding the “Challenge Project.” 
The report also stated that the Directorate was engaged in assassination attempts, including those of US President George H. W. Bush and Husayn Kamil,[tpl]cite web |author=Duelfer, Charles |title=IIS Undeclared Research on Poisons and Toxins for Assassination |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/report/2004/isg-final-report/isg-final-report_vol3_cw-anx-a.htm |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |work=Iraq Study Group Final Report |date=2004-09-30 |accessdate=2008-01-21[/tpl] an Iraqi defector.[tpl]cite web |title=Iraq Weapons of Mass Destruction Programs |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/threat/whitepap.htm |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |date=1998-02-13 |accessdate=2008-01-21[/tpl] It may have also been behind the assassination of Talib Al Suheil, an Iraqi dissident killed in 1994 in Beirut.
Soon after the 2003 invasion, Newsweek reported that a memo from the Directorate, dated October 29, 2002, raised the possibility that they had an informant inside the US intelligence community before the war: "one of our sources in the United States, with a high level of reliability, says the CIA and the so-called opposition have a joint plan to bring 'quislings' to Iraq from the north and south to gather information and await future missions. Our informant will be one of them."[tpl]cite news |first=Melinda |last=Liu |coauthors=Nordland, Rod; Thomas, Evan |title=The Saddam Files |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/59117 |publisher=Newsweek |date=2003-04-28 |accessdate=2008-01-20[/tpl]
