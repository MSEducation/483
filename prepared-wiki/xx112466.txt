A changing table is a small raised platform designed to allow a person to change someone's diaper.
Typically made of wood (such as oak or pine), it is often part of a nursery set. The topmost surface is used to rest the person being changed, during the changing process while there are usually shelves or drawers to store necessary supplies such as diapers, baby wipes, baby powder and sometimes clothing as a dresser would have.

==Public changing tables==

Many public restrooms have public tables available should a diaper change be required in a public place. They are typically made of hard plastic and rest on hinges so they can be folded into the wall when not in use. They are usually not enclosed in a stall.
These became popular in the 1990. Originally they were mainly found in women's restrooms. Through the lobbying efforts of Eric Letts, now the director of the Fair Parenting Project, it became commonplace to find then in men's rooms across Canada and the United States.
