==House of Representatives==

Chambliss was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994 as one of the new conservative Republican congressmen whose elections caused the party to gain a majority in both houses of Congress. A long-time Congressman and fellow Georgian, Newt Gingrich, was the leader of the movement, and Chambliss and the other Republicans elected that year are known as the Class of '94.
Chambliss was elected from the Macon-based 8th District, after six-term incumbent J. Roy Rowland retired. He was elected with 62.65%1994 General Election Results U.S. Congress - 8th District, Georgia Secretary of State of the vote—an unexpectedly large margin since the 8th had never elected a Republican. He faced a tough re-election fight in 1996 against Macon attorney Jim Wiggins, but breezed to reelection in 1998 and 2000.
During his four terms in the House, Chambliss served on the United States House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and chaired the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security.
Less than a month after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security, which Chambliss chaired, investigated intelligence issues related to the attacks. The committee's investigation resulted in the first comprehensive report detailing critical shortfalls within the United States intelligence community's performance and technological capabilities.Rep. Saxby Chambliss: Anti-terrorism measures in the U.S., CNN.com, October 2, 2001
Chambliss was criticized for remarks he made during a November 19, 2001 meeting with first responders in Valdosta, Georgia, where he said that homeland security would be improved by turning the sheriff loose to "arrest every Muslim that crosses the state line." Chambliss apologized for the remarks.Melanie Eversley, "Chambliss apologizes for remark on Muslims", Atlanta Journal-Constitution, November 21, 2001.

===Elections===

====2002 race====

Upon urging from Karl Rove and the Bush administration who viewed the Democratic party of Georgia as vulnerable, Chambliss ran for the Senate in 2002, facing freshman Democratic incumbent Max Cleland.  Chambliss's political career would have likely ended if he hadn't run for the Senate; the state legislature had shifted his home in Moultrie (along with most of the southern portion of his district) to the nearby 1st district, represented by fellow Republican and friend Jack Kingston.
Chambliss focused on the issue of national defense and homeland security during his campaign, and released an ad that included Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, highlighting Cleland's record on the issues of war and terrorism.Chambliss Ad (Cleland), YouTube, August 2, 2006
Chambliss received criticism from Democrats and Republicans for this ad, pointing out that he, who hadn't served in the Vietnam War due to receiving military deferments, had attacked a Vietnam War veteran who lost three limbs during his service for not being tough enough on issues of war and homeland security.Politico: Cleland ad causes trouble for Chambliss.  November 12, 2008.  Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona said of one ad, "It's worse than disgraceful, it's reprehensible."The Atlantic: The Daily Dish: Quote for the Day.  November 12, 2008.  McCain, along with Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, made significant complaints to the Republican National Committee until the ads were taken down.The Orlando Sentinel: Ex-senator Boosts Kerry, Battles Critics.  June 13, 2004  Chambliss supporters disagreed with the criticism, saying the advertisement did not question Cleland's patriotism, but rather his judgment.[tpl]cite news|first=Michael|last=Crowley|authorlink=|author=|coauthors=|title=Former Sen.

Chambliss won the election, receiving 53 percent of the votes to Cleland's 46 percent.
Karl Rove stated in his 2010 memoirs that "Although Cleland personally blamed me for the ad, saying I was guilty of 'character assassination' and responsible for 'the biggest lie in America.' 
I did not conceive, create, or have anything to do with the Chambliss ad. But I thought it was effective because it was factual.
Chambliss had run a spot associating himself with Pres. Bush by suggesting Cleland had not supported creating the Homeland Security department. It was a clever tactic, since Bush was very popular in Georgia. Cleland had worked against Bush on creation of the new department.
Chambliss' ad morphed Osama bin Laden and Saddam into Cleland suggesting he supported them, followed by a scrolling list of the times he had voted against the homeland security bill."Rove, Karl. Courage and Consequence, p.312-313

====2008 race====

On November 4, 2008, Chambliss received 49.8% of the vote, while Democratic challenger Jim Martin received 46.8% and Libertarian Allen Buckley received 3.4% of the vote.[tpl]cite news  | title =  Georgia Election Results  | publisher = Secretary of State of Georgia  | date = 2008-11-04  | url = http://www.sos.georgia.gov/elections/election_results/2008_1104/swfed.htm  | accessdate = 2008-11-12 [/tpl]

====Imperial Sugar====

During the run-off period, Chambliss received a subpoena regarding the investigation of a lawsuit against Imperial Sugar that claims that Imperial "wrongfully" failed to remove hazards that caused the disaster of a Savannah-based sugar refinery that exploded on February 7, 2008. Chambliss was accused of "harassing"[tpl]cite news | last = Peterson | first = Larry | title = Chambliss in sugar furor | publisher = Savannah morning news| date = 2008-07-31| url = http://savannahnow.com/node/542481 | accessdate = 2008-11-25[/tpl] a former sugar company executive. In a statement, Chambliss said he has referred the matter to Senate lawyers. Chambliss has stated: "I continue to sympathize with the families who were devastated by this tragedy and I will continue to work to protect the interests of those families." Savannah attorney Mark Tate, "an active backer of Democratic candidates," insisted that "there is nothing political" about the timing of the subpoena. When Tate subpoenaed Chambliss to testify in the case, Chambliss claimed "legislative immunity."[tpl]cite news | last = Peterson | first = Larry | title = Chambliss subpoenaed in Imperial Sugar case | publisher = Savannah morning news| date = 2008-10-24| url = http://savannahnow.com/node/601053 | accessdate = 2008-11-25[/tpl][tpl]cite news | last = Peterson | first = Larry | title = Chambliss says he doesn't have to obey order to testify in Imperial Sugar lawsuit | publisher = Savannah morning news| date = 2008-11-16| url = http://savannahnow.com/node/618254 | accessdate = 2008-11-25[/tpl][tpl]cite news | last = ATKINS | first = MICHAEL| title = Imperial Sugar executive defends Chambliss | publisher = Savannah morning news| date = 2008-11-20| url = http://savannahnow.com/node/620312 | accessdate = 2008-11-25 [/tpl]
