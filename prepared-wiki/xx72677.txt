The Workers' Communist Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina ([tpl]lang-bs|Radničko-komunistička partija Bosne i Hercegovine[/tpl]) is a communist party from Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was formed in 2000 and strongly opposes the nationalism of the region and the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Some of their major aims are the introduction of workers' self-management and participatory democracy, as well as the establishment of a socialist federal Yugoslavia. They say they are not motivated by nostalgia, as they are critical of Josip Broz Tito.
They believe that socialism has to be democratic and strongly oppose the system of the former Soviet Union and other former governments. They have been particularly influenced by Rosa Luxemburg and Antonio Gramsci.
