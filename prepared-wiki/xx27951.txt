The Aral Sea ([tpl]lang-kz|Арал Теңізі[/tpl] Aral Teñizi; [tpl]lang-uz|Orol Dengizi[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ru|Аральскοе Мοре[/tpl] Aral'skoye Morye; [tpl]lang-tg|Баҳри Арал[/tpl] Bahri Aral; older [tpl]lang-fa|دریای خوارزم[/tpl] Daryâ-ye Khârazm) was a lake lying between Kazakhstan (Aktobe and Kyzylorda provinces) in the north and Karakalpakstan, an autonomous region of Uzbekistan, in the south. The name roughly translates as "Sea of Islands", referring to about 1,534 islands that once dotted its waters; in Old Turkic aral means "island" and "thicket".[tpl]cite book|title=Old Turkic Dictionary|place=Leningrad|publisher=Science|year=1969|page=50[/tpl]
Formerly one of the four largest lakes in the world with an area of [tpl]convert|68000|km2|sqmi|-2|abbr=on[/tpl], the Aral Sea has been steadily shrinking since the 1960s after the rivers that fed it were diverted by Soviet irrigation projects. By 2007, it had declined to 10% of its original size, splitting into four lakes – the North Aral Sea, the eastern and western basins of the once far larger South Aral Sea, and one smaller lake between the North and South Aral Seas.[tpl]cite news|author=Philip Micklin; Nikolay V.

==Formation==

The Aral Sea formed about 5.5 million years ago due to a fall in sea level and the uplift of the Elburz and Caucasus Mountains.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] It is generally believed that the Amu Darya did not flow into the shallow depression that now forms the Aral Sea until the beginning of the Holocene,Middleton, Nick; “The Aral Sea”; in Shahgedanova Maria; The Physical Geography of Northern Eurasia; pp. 497-498 and it is known that the Amu Darya flowed into the Caspian via the Uzboy channel until the Holocene. The Syr Darya formed a large lake in the Kyzyl Kum during the Pliocene known as the Mynbulak depressionVelichko, Andrey and Spasskaya, Irina; “Climatic Change and the Development of Landscapes”; in Shahgedanova Maria; The Physical Geography of Northern Eurasia; pp. 48-50

==History==

===Naval history===

Russian naval presence on the Aral Sea started in 1847, with the founding of Raimsk, which was soon renamed Aralsk, near the mouth of the Syr Darya. Soon, the Imperial Russian Navy started deploying its vessels on the sea. Owing to the Aral Sea basin not being connected to other bodies of water, the vessels had to be disassembled in Orenburg on the Ural River, shipped overland to Aralsk (presumably by a camel caravan), and then reassembled. The first two ships, assembled in 1847, were the two-masted schooners named Nikolai and Mikhail. The former was a warship; the latter was a merchant vessel meant to serve the establishment of the fisheries on the great lake. In 1848, these two vessels surveyed the northern part of the sea. In the same year, a larger warship, the Constantine, was assembled, as well. Commanded by Lt. Alexey Butakov (Алексей Бутаков), the Constantine completed the survey of the entire Aral Sea over the next two years.
The exiled Ukrainian poet and painter Taras Shevchenko participated in the expedition, and painted a number of sketches of the Aral Sea coast.
For the navigation season of 1851, two newly built steamers arrived from Sweden, again by caravan from Orenburg. As the geological surveys had found no coal deposits in the area, the Military Governor-General of Orenburg Vasily Perovsky ordered "as large as possible supply" of saxaul (a desert shrub, akin to the creosote bush) to be collected in Aralsk for use by the new steamers. Unfortunately, H. saxaul wood did not turn out a very suitable fuel, and in the later years, the Aral Flotilla was provisioned, at substantial cost, by Donets coal.

===Irrigation canals===

In the early 1960s,[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12416910.800-soviet-cotton-threatens-a-regions-sea--and-its-children.html|title=Soviet cotton threatens a region's sea - and its children|date=November 18, 1989|work=New Scientist|accessdate=January 27, 2010[/tpl] the Soviet government decided the two rivers that fed the Aral Sea, the Amu Darya in the south and the Syr Darya in the east, would be diverted to irrigate the desert, in an attempt to grow rice, melons, cereals, and cotton.
This was part of the Soviet plan for cotton, or "white gold", to become a major export. This temporarily succeeded, and in 1988, Uzbekistan was the world's largest exporter of cotton.[tpl]cite web|author=USDA-Foreign Agriculture Service|title=Cotton Production Ranking|url= http://www.cotton.org/econ/cropinfo/cropdata/rankings.cfm|publisher=National Cotton Council of America|year=2013|accessdate=Oct 14, 2013[/tpl]
The construction of irrigation canals began on a large scale in the 1940s. Many of the canals were poorly built, allowing water to leak or evaporate. From the Qaraqum Canal, the largest in Central Asia, perhaps 30 to 75% of the water went to waste. Today, only 12% of Uzbekistan's irrigation canal length is waterproofed.
Of the 47,750 km of interfarm irrigation channels in the basin, only 28% have antifiltration linings. Only 77% of farm intakes have flow gauges, and of the 268,500 km of onfarm channels, only 21% have antifiltration linings, which retain on average 15% more water than unlined channels.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.cawater-info.net/aral/aral0_e.htm|title=ca-water.net, a knowledge base for projects in the Central Asia|year=2003|accessdate=November 2010[/tpl]
By 1960, between [tpl]convert|20|and|60|km3|cumi|lk=out|abbr=on[/tpl] of water were going each year to the land instead of the sea. Most of the sea's water supply had been diverted, and in the 1960s, the Aral Sea began to shrink. From 1961 to 1970, the Aral's level fell at an average of [tpl]convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] a year; in the 1970s, the average rate nearly tripled to [tpl]convert|50|-|60|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] per year, and by the 1980s, it continued to drop, now with a mean of [tpl]convert|80|-|90|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] each year. The rate of water usage for irrigation continued to increase; the amount of water taken from the rivers doubled between 1960 and 2000, and cotton production nearly doubled in the same period.
The disappearance of the lake was no surprise to the Soviets; they expected it to happen long before. As early as 1964, Aleksandr Asarin at the Hydroproject Institute pointed out that the lake was doomed, explaining, "It was part of the five-year plans, approved by the council of ministers and the Politburo. Nobody on a lower level would dare to say a word contradicting those plans, even if it was the fate of the Aral Sea."
The reaction to the predictions varied. Some Soviet experts apparently considered the Aral to be "nature's error", and a Soviet engineer said in 1968, "it is obvious to everyone that the evaporation of the Aral Sea is inevitable."[tpl]cite book|last=Bissell|first=Tom|title=Eternal Winter: Lessons of the Aral Sea Disaster|pages=41–56|publisher=Harper's|year=2002|isbn=[/tpl] On the other hand, starting in the 1960s, a large-scale project was proposed to redirect part of the flow of the rivers of the Ob basin to Central Asia over a gigantic canal system. Refilling of the Aral Sea was considered as one of the project's main goals. However, due to its staggering costs and the negative public opinion in Russia proper, the federal authorities abandoned the project by 1986.[tpl]cite book|last=Glantz|first= Michael H.|title=Creeping Environmental Problems and Sustainable Development in the Aral Sea...|page=174|location=Cambridge, New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-521-62086-4|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2YXnBxZg7c4C|accessdate=May 17, 2008[/tpl]
From 1960 to 1998, the sea's surface area shrank by about 60%, and its volume by 80%. In 1960, the Aral Sea had been the world's fourth-largest lake, with an area around [tpl]convert|68000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] and a volume of [tpl]convert|1100|km3|cumi|abbr=on[/tpl]; by 1998, it had dropped to [tpl]convert|28687|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl], and eighth-largest. The amount of water it had lost is the equivalent of completely draining Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Over the same time period, its salinity increased from about 10 g/l to about 45 g/l.
In 1987, the continuing shrinkage split the lake into two separate bodies of water, the North Aral Sea (the Lesser Sea, or Small Aral Sea) and the South Aral Sea (the Greater Sea, or Large Aral Sea).
In 1991, Uzbekistan gained independence from the Soviet Union. Craig Murray, a UK ambassador to Uzbekistan in 2002, described the independence as a way for Islam Karimov to consolidate his power rather than a move away from a Soviet-style economy and its philosophy of exploitation of the land. Murray attributes the shrinkage of the Aral Sea in the 1990s to Karimov's cotton policy. The government maintained a massive irrigation system which Murray described as massively wasteful, with most of the water being lost through evaporation before reaching the cotton. Crop rotation was not used, and the depleted soil and monoculture required massive quantities of pesticides and fertilizer. The runoff from the fields washed these chemicals into the shrinking sea, creating severe pollution and health problems. Murray compared the system to the slavery system in the pre-Civil War United States; forced labor was used, and profits were siphoned off by the powerful and well-connected. Murray contrasts this to Kazakhstan, where the cotton industry had been privatized.[tpl]cite book|title=Dirty Diplomacy|author=Craig Murray|publisher=Scribner|year=2007[/tpl]
By summer 2003, the South Aral Sea was vanishing faster than predicted. In the deepest parts of the sea, the bottom waters were saltier than the top, and not mixing. Thus, only the top of the sea was heated in the summer, and it evaporated faster than would otherwise be expected. In 2003, the South Aral further divided into eastern and western basins.
In 2004, the Aral Sea's surface area was only [tpl]convert|17160|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl], 25% of its original size, and a nearly five-fold increase in salinity had killed most of its natural flora and fauna. By 2007, the sea's area had further shrunk to 10% of its original size, and the salinity of the remains of the South Aral had increased to levels in excess of 100 g/l. (By comparison, the salinity of ordinary seawater is typically around 35 g/l; the Dead Sea's salinity varies between 300 and 350 g/l.) The decline of the North Aral has now been partially reversed following construction of a dam (see below), but the remnants of the South Aral continue to disappear and its drastic shrinkage has created the Aralkum, a desert on the former lake bed.
The inflow of groundwater into the South Aral Sea will probably not in itself be able to stop the desiccation, especially without a change in irrigation practices.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ciesin.org/docs/006-238/006-238.html|title=Desiccation of the Aral Sea|publisher=CIESIN, Coulmbia University|author=Philip P.

==Impact on environment, economy, and public health==

Water diversion for irrigation clearly has significant short term benefits in terms of increased agricultural production and profit and it is logical that Central Asian governments have approved water diversion because they view such economic benefits as greater than economic losses, such as loss of fishing.
The ecosystems of the Aral Sea and the river deltas feeding into it have been nearly destroyed, not least because of the much higher salinity. The receding sea has left huge plains covered with salt and toxic chemicals – the results of weapons testing, industrial projects, and pesticides and fertilizer runoff – which are picked up and carried away by the wind as toxic dust and spread to the surrounding area. The land around the Aral Sea is heavily polluted, and the people living in the area are suffering from a lack of fresh water and health problems, including high rates of certain forms of cancer and lung diseases. Respiratory illnesses, including tuberculosis (most of which is drug resistant) and cancer, digestive disorders, anaemia, and infectious diseases are common ailments in the region. Tuberculosis is transmitted human-to-human and is caused by an infectious bacteria. It is not caused by the drying up and salination of inland waterways. Infectious diseases are usually transmitted human-to-human and are usually caused by bacteria or virii, and are not caused by the drying up and salination of inland waterways. Liver, kidney, and eye problems can also be attributed to the toxic dust storms. Health concerns associated with the region are a cause for an unusually high fatality rate amongst vulnerable parts of the population. The child mortality rate is 75 in every 1,000 newborns and maternity death is 12 in every 1,000 women. There is no evidence whatsoever that child and maternal mortality in childbearth has any relation whatsoever to the drying up and salination of an inland waterway. Given that such death rates are well known to correlate with access to and quality of provision of professional medical healthcare to pregnant women and women in labor, it is grossly irresponsible to manufacture a link to a supposed macro-environmental cause. All pregnant women should have access to a proper medical care, regardless of the environmental policies of the state in which they live.[tpl]cite web|url= http://enrin.grida.no/aral/aralsea/english/arsea/arsea.htm |title=Aral Sea - Aral Sea |archiveurl=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090316062917/http://enrin.grida.no/aral/aralsea/english/arsea/arsea.htm|archivedate=2009-03-16[/tpl] Crops in the region are destroyed by salt being deposited onto the land. Vast salt plains exposed by the shrinking Aral have produced dust storms, making regional winters colder and summers hotter.[tpl]cite web|author=Godwin O. P.

===Possible environmental solutions===

Many different solutions to the problems have been suggested over the years, varying in feasibility and cost, including:
In January 1994, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan signed a deal to pledge 1% of their budgets to help the sea recover.
In March 2000, UNESCO presented their "Water-related vision for the Aral Sea basin for the year 2025"[tpl]cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001262/126259mo.pdf |title=Water-related vision for the Aral Sea Basin for the year 2025; 2000 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12[/tpl] at the second World Water Forum in The Hague.

===Islamabad Initiative on Saving and Rehabilitation of Aral Sea===

An Islamabad-based think tank, Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI)http://www.sdpi.org/ has established a working group on saving the Aral Sea. which will focus only on transboundary water management and the environmental, economic and energy issues of Central Asia.[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl]

===Aral Sea Basin program===

The future of the Aral Sea, and the responsibility for its survival are now in the hands of the five countries: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan. In 1994, they adopted the Aral Sea Basin Program.  The Program’s four objectives are:

====ASBP: Phases One and Two====

The first phase of the plan effectively began with the first involvement from the World Bank in 1992, and was in operation until 1997.  It was ineffectual for a number of reasons, but mainly because it was focused on improving directly the land around the Aral Sea, whilst not intervening in the water usage upstream. There was considerable concern amongst the Central Asian governments, which realised the importance of the Aral Sea in the ecosystem and the economy of Central Asia, and they were prepared to cooperate, but they found it difficult to implement the procedures of the plan.
This is due in part to a lack of co-operation between the affected people. The water flowing into the Aral Sea has long been considered an important commodity, and trade agreements have been made to supply the downstream communities with water in the spring and summer months for irrigation. In return, they supply the upstream countries with fuel during the winter, instead of storing water during the warm months for hydroelectric purposes in winter. However, very few legal obligations are binding these contracts, particularly on an international stage.
Phase Two of the Aral Sea Basin program followed in 1998 and ran for five years. The main shortcomings of phase two were due to its lack of integration with the local communities involved. The scheme was drawn up by the World Bank, government representatives, and various technical experts, without consulting those who would be affected. An example of this was the public awareness initiatives, which were seen as propagandist attempts by people with little care or understanding of their situation.  These failures have led to the introduction of a new plan, funded by a number of institutions, including the five countries involved and the World Bank.

====ASBP: Phase Three====

In 1997, a new plan was conceived which would continue with the previous restoration efforts of the Aral Sea. The main aims of this phase are to improve the irrigation systems currently in place, whilst targeting water management at a local level. The largest project in this phase is the North Aral Sea Project, a direct effort to recover the northern region of the Aral Sea. The North Aral Sea Project’s main initiative is the construction of a dam across the Berg Strait, a deep channel which connects the North Aral Sea to the South Aral Sea. The Kok-Aral Dam is eight miles long and has capacity for over 29 cubic kilometres of water to be stored in the North Aral Sea, whilst allowing excess to overflow into the South Aral Sea.

===North Aral Sea restoration work===

Work is being done to restore in part the North Aral Sea. Irrigation works on the Syr Darya have been repaired and improved to increase its water flow, and in October 2003, the Kazakh government announced a plan to build Dike Kokaral, a concrete dam separating the two halves of the Aral Sea. Work on this dam was completed in August 2005; since then, the water level of the North Aral has risen, and its salinity has decreased.

Economically significant stocks of fish have returned, and observers who had written off the North Aral Sea as an environmental disaster were surprised by unexpected reports that, in 2006, its returning waters were already partly reviving the fishing industry and producing catches for export as far as Ukraine. The restoration reportedly gave rise to long-absent rain clouds and possible microclimate changes, bringing tentative hope to an agricultural sector swallowed by a regional dustbowl, and some expansion of the shrunken sea.[tpl]cite web|title=Miraculous Catch in Kazakhstan's Northern Aral Sea|url= http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P046045/syr-darya-control-northern-aral-sea-phase-project?lang=en|publisher=The World Bank|date=June 2006|accessdate=May 17, 2008[/tpl]
"The sea, which had receded almost [tpl]convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] south of the port-city of Aralsk, is now a mere [tpl]convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] away."

===Future of South Aral Sea===

The South Aral Sea, half of which lies in  Uzbekistan, was largely abandoned to its fate. Only excess water from the North Aral Sea is now periodically allowed to flow into the largely dried-up South Aral Sea through a sluice in the dike.[tpl]cite web|title=Saving a Corner of the Aral Sea|url= http://go.worldbank.org/IE3PGWPVJ0|publisher=The World Bank|date=2005-09-01|accessdate=May 17, 2008[/tpl]  Discussions had been held on recreating a channel between the somewhat improved North and the desiccated South, along with uncertain wetland restoration plans throughout the region, but political will is lacking. Uzbekistan shows no interest in abandoning the Amu Darya river as an abundant source of cotton irrigation, and instead is moving toward oil exploration in the drying South Aral seabed.
Attempts to mitigate the effects of desertification include planting vegetation in the newly exposed seabed; however, intermittent flooding of the eastern basin is likely to prove problematic for any development. Redirecting what little flow there is from the Amu Darya to the western basin may salvage fisheries there while relieving the flooding of the eastern basin.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.boku.ac.at/iwhw/onlinepublikationen/nachtnebel/EU_INTAS_0511_Rebasows/Files/Summary_report.pdf|title=The rehabilitation of the ecosystem and bioproductivity of the Aral Sea under conditions of water scarcity|format=PDF|date=August 2007|accessdate=[/tpl]
Processes to restore the deep coastal bays on the south shore around Muynak, specifically the creation of dam-like wetlands that prevent the spread of desertification and form a layer that stops the dust storms, have been undertaken. The project's purpose is the reestablishment of local fisheries, but is currently halted due to a lack of funds and the loss of water in the upper stream of the delta of the Amu-Darya river, where cropland is irrigated.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]

==Institutional bodies==

The Interstate Commission for Water Coordination of Central Asia (ICWC) was formed on February 18, 1992 to formally unite the five Central Asian countries in the hopes of solving environmental as well as socioeconomic problems in the Aral Sea region. These five states are the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Republic of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and the Republic of Uzbekistan. The River Basin Organizations (the BVOs) of the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers were institutions called upon by the ICWC to help manage water resources. According to the ICWC,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icwc-aral.uz/strategy.htm|title=Strategies suggested for implementation|publisher=ICWC|accessdate=January 6, 2013[/tpl] the main objectives of the body are:
The International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) was developed on March 23, 1993 by the ICWC to raise funds for the projects under Aral Sea Basin programs. The IFAS was meant to finance programs to save the sea and improve on environmental issues associated with the basin’s drying. This program has had some success with joint summits of the countries involved and finding funding from the World Bank, to implement projects; however, it faces many challenges, such as enforcement and slowing progress.

==Vozrozhdeniya==

Vozrozhdeniya, also known as "Rebirth Island", is a former island of the Aral Sea or South Aral Sea. Due to the ongoing shrinkage of the Aral, it became first a peninsula in mid-2001 and finally part of the mainland.NASA Visible Earth - “Rebirth” Island Joins the Mainland, Aral Sea Other islands like Kokaral and Barsa-Kelmes shared a similar fate. Since the disappearance of the Southeast Aral in 2008, Vozrozhdeniya effectively no longer exists as a distinct geographical feature. The area is now shared by Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.
In 1948, a top-secret Soviet bioweapons laboratory was established on the island in the center of the Aral Sea which is now disputed territory between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The exact history, functions and current status of this facility are still unclear, but bio-agents tested there included Bacillus anthracis, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, Brucella suis, Rickettsia prowazekii, Variola major (smallpox), Yersinia pestis, botulinum toxin, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus.[tpl]cite book|author=Bozheyeva, G., Y.

Yeleukenov|year=1999|title=Former Soviet Biological Weapons Facilities in Kazakhstan: Past, Present and Future|place=Monterey, Calif.|publisher=Monterey Institute of International Studies, Center for Nonproliferation Studies|work=Occasional Paper 1[/tpl] In 1971 a release of weaponized smallpox from the island allowed the virus to spread to the city of Aral. Ten people there were infected, of whom 3 died, and a massive vaccination effort involving 50,000 inhabitants ensued (see Aral smallpox incident). The bioweapons base was abandoned in 1992 following the disintegration of the Soviet Union the previous year. Scientific expeditions proved this had been a site for production, testing and later dumping of pathogenic weapons. In 2002, through a project organized by the United States and with Uzbekistan's assistance, 10 anthrax burial sites were decontaminated. According to the Kazakh Scientific Center for Quarantine and Zoonotic Infections, all burial sites of anthrax were decontaminated.[tpl]cite news|author=Khabar Television/BBC Monitoring|title=Kazakhstan: Vozrozhdeniya Anthrax Burial Sites Destroyed|url=http://www.nti.org/d_newswire/issues/newswires/2002_11_20.html|work= Global Security Newswire|publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative|date=November 20, 2002|accessdate=May 17, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080422205925/http://www.nti.org/d_newswire/issues/newswires/2002_11_20.html|archivedate=April 22, 2008 |deadurl=no[/tpl]

==Oil and gas exploration==

Ergash Shaismatov, the Deputy Prime Minister of Uzbekistan, announced on August 30, 2006, that the Uzbek government and an international consortium consisting of state-run Uzbekneftegaz, LUKoil Overseas, Petronas, Korea National Oil Corporation, and China National Petroleum Corporation signed a production-sharing agreement to explore and develop oil and gas fields in the Aral Sea, saying, "The Aral Sea is largely unknown, but it holds a lot of promise in terms of finding oil and gas. There is risk, of course, but we believe in the success of this unique project." The consortium was created in September 2005.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=10748305&PageNum=0|title=Uzbekistan, intl consortium ink deal on exploring Aral Sea|publisher=ITAR-Tass[/tpl]
As of June 1, 2010, 500,000 cubic meters of gas had been extracted from the region at a depth of 3 km.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.registan.net/index.php/2010/06/09/aral-gas/|title=Aral Gas|author= Michael Hancock-Parmer|publisher=Registan.net|date=2010-06-09[/tpl]

==Movies==

The plight of the Aral coast was portrayed in the 1989 film Psy ("Dogs") by Soviet director Dmitri Svetozarov.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.kinoexpert.ru/index.asp?comm=4&num=5583|title=Psy|publisher=Kino Expert|accessdate=September 18, 2009[/tpl] The film was shot on location in an actual ghost town, showing scenes of abandoned buildings and scattered vessels.
In 2000, the MirrorMundo foundation produced a documentary film called Delta Blues about the problems arising from the drying up of the sea.[tpl]cite web|date=November 5, 2008|url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0465vGRWhQE|title=Delta Blues (in a land of cotton)|publisher=YouTube|date=2008-11-05|accessdate=July 18, 2009[/tpl]
In June 2007, BBC World broadcast a documentary called Back From The Brink? made by Borna Alikhani and Guy Creasey that showed some of the changes in the region since the introduction of the Aklak Dam.
