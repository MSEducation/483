==Biography==

The Crystal Method is made up of two members, Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland. Before The Crystal Method was formed, Ken and Scott started working on music while working at the grocery store and while Ken was a local DJ in Las Vegas as well as the college radio program director at UNLV. Ken taught Scott how to DJ, and when Ken moved to L.A. to work for a producer, Scott took over his job DJ'ing at the local club. Scott would follow Ken out to L.A., and they formed The Crystal Method in 1993.

===Early days (1993–1995)===

By the early '90s, both Ken and Scott had moved from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland bought a house together, in Glendale, California, which had a small underground shelter beneath the front lawn. Originally intending to turn the shelter into a studio, it proved to be an unrealistic idea and the duo set up a studio in their house (which was located under a Los Angeles Overpass. They subsequently named their studio The Bomb Shelter. They were interviewed on the front lawn of the house in the documentary Better Living Through Circuitry.
After The Bomb Shelter was built, a tape of The Crystal Method's music found its way to a British DJ named Justin King. King was interested in starting a record label that would showcase American electronic dance acts. King teamed up with Scottish Steve Melrose to form the record label City of Angels. The first official release from the City of Angels label was The Crystal Method's "Now is the Time". The Crystal Method were signed to Outpost Recordings in 1996.

===The Crystal Method (2013–present)===

On February 22, 2013, TCM tweeted "We'll be playing tracks from the new album @BellyUp tonight!!! Thank you Aspen. Scott".
Originally scheduled for a June, 2013, release, the self-titled The Crystal Method was delayed by a surgery to remove a cyst in Scott Kirkland's brain.[tpl]cite web|last=Baltin |first=Steve |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-crystal-method-overcome-health-scare-for-new-album-20131004?print=true |title=The Crystal Method Overcome Health Scare for New Album | Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06[/tpl] The album was released on January 14, 2014.
When approximately halfway creating the next album process, Scott Kirkland received news that he had developed "what's called a benign posterior fossa arachnoid cyst that needed to be removed from my head." He explains, "It's a simple procedure as far as brain surgery goes, but they still had to cut into my skull and noodle around in there. The surgery wasn't as bad as the infection afterwards, which landed me in the ICU for ten days. Thankfully, I made it out okay. In hindsight, as weird as it sounds, I think we were able to make a better record because we came through this." Following his 2013 recovery, Scott regrouped with Ken Jordan and continued working on the album.
In late 2013, the duo was adding the final touches to their new self-titled album and asked to compose the score and opening theme of Almost Human, a science fiction android driven crime drama airing on the Fox Network.
