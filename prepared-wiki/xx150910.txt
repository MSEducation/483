==Route description==

The route begins at the Florida state line south of Statenville. The route travels north concurrent with US 129 through Statenville, Lakeland, Nashville, Ocilla, Fitzgerald, and Abbeville, before arriving in Hawkinsville. In Hawkinsville, SR 11 departs US 129 and runs concurrent with US 341 northwest to Perry. There, SR 11 departs and runs concurrent with US 41, and eventually, US 129 again, north to Macon. SR 11 leaves Macon concurrent with US 129 and SR 22. In Gray, SR 11 departs, and travels north, without being concurrent with a U.S. Highway. In Jefferson, the route again runs concurrent with US 129. The two routes continue north, passing through Gainesville. Further north, SR 11 and US 129 are joined by US 19. The three routes climb over and descend the mountains, and continues north to the North Carolina state line, where SR 11 meets its northern terminus.
