Cadney cum Howsham is a civil parish in North Lincolnshire, England, that consists of the small villages of Cadney and Howsham, several farms, and mainly arable farmland.
The parish boundary is defined by water on all sides, by the Old River Ancholme, Kettleby Beck and North Kelsey Beck.
Within the parish, at Newstead on the River Ancholme, lies the site of the Gilbertine Holy Trinity Priory, founded by Henry II in 1171, and endowed with the island of Ancholme, and lands around Cadney and Hardwick. The priory was limited to 13 canons and lay brothers. It was surrendered in 1538 under the act of suppression. On the site of the priory stands Newstead Priory Farmhouse, which retains the remains of a Norman vaulted room and a Perpendicular window.Cox, J. Charles (1916) Lincolnshire pp. 91, 92; Methuen & Co.
