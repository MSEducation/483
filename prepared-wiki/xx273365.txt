==Design and development==

The L-6A was developed as a motor glider version of the Lucas L6 light aircraft.
The L-6A is of all-metal construction. The [tpl]convert|14|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] span wing can be folded for ground transportation or storage and the wing tips are removable. The landing gear is of a retractable conventional landing gear configuration. The recommended engines are the Lycoming O-235 of [tpl]convert|75|to|100|kW|hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl] or the Limbach L2000 of [tpl]convert|60|kW|hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl].
The L-6A was only available as plans and no kits or completed aircraft were factory-made. The plans cost US$400 in 2002 and at that time two examples were reported complete and flying. The construction time is estimated as 4000 hours.
