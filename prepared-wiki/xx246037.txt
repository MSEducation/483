==Portraits==

Philipps was commissioned in 2002 to paint a large composition of Ken Follett surrounded by characters from his novels.
In 2005 Philipps was one of two portrait painters whose paintings were chosen to hang at the BP Exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery (London) and the Garrick Milne Exhibition at Christie's.
In 2012 Philipps was commissioned by Royal Mail to paint a portrait of H M The Queen for the first class stamp, for the stamp series celebrating the 60th Anniversary of the Coronation.  This was the first portrait to be commissioned by Royal Mail, and has been gifted to The Queen to hang as part of the Royal Collection.  Originally intended to be a head and shoulders portrait, it was Philipps' decision to paint a life size, full length figure and include Her Majesty's four dogs.
In early 2008 Philipps was commissioned by The Trustees of the National Portrait Gallery (London) to paint a  portrait of Princes William and Harry, sons of The Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales.
Her double-portrait of Britain's Princes William and Harry was unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery in London, on 6 January 2010. The two royals, are painted wearing the dress uniform of the Blues and Royals, one of the regiments of the Household Cavalry, in the setting of Clarence House, their official residence since 2002 and the home of their father, The Prince of Wales. "The first portrait of the princes captures them formally dressed, but informally posed. It is a delightful image which extends the tradition of royal portraiture," said National Portrait Gallery director Sandy Nairne.[tpl]cite news | title ='Brotherly banter' in portrait of Princes William and Harry  | work = | publisher = news.com.au | date =January 7, 2010  | url = http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,,26561593-5012777,00.html | accessdate = 2010-01-08[/tpl]
