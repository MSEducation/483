[[List of the most intense tropical cyclones]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of tropical cyclones, Lists of superlatives

In the available records, a total of 70 tropical cyclones attained a pressure of less than 900 hPa (mbar) (26.56 inHg), most of which occurred in the Western North Pacific Ocean. The strongest tropical cyclone recorded worldwide, as measured by minimum central pressure, was Typhoon Tip, which reached a pressure of 870 hPa (25.69 inHg) on October 12, 1979.[tpl]cite journal|volume=108|issue=11|pages=1915–1923|author=Dunnavan, George M|author2=Diercks, John W|date=November 1, 1980|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1980)1082.0.CO;2|journal=Monthly Weather Review|accessdate=February 24, 2013|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0493%281980%29108%3C1915%3AAAOSTT%3E2.0.CO%3B2|title=An Analysis of Super Typhoon Tip (October 1979)[/tpl] The following list is subdivided by basins. Data listed are provided by the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre, unless otherwise noted.

==North Atlantic Ocean==

Storms with an intensity of 925 hPa (27.32 inHg) or less are listed.

==Eastern Pacific Ocean==

Storms with an intensity of 925 hPa (27.46 inHg) or less are listed.

==Western North Pacific Ocean==

Storms with a minimum pressure below 900 hPa (26.58 inHg) are listed.

==North Indian Ocean==

Storms with an intensity of 950 hPa (28.1 inHg) or less are listed. Data for storms prior to 1990 is incomplete.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/bestrack.pdf|title=Best track data of tropical cyclonic disturbances over the north Indian Ocean|date=2009-07-14|publisher=India Meteorological Department|accessdate=2009-07-16[/tpl]

==South-West Indian Ocean==

Storms with an intensity of 920 hPa (27.17 inHg) or less are listed.

==Australian Region==

Storms with an intensity of 920 hPa (27.17 inHg) or less are listed.

==South Pacific Ocean==

Storms with an intensity of 925 hPa (27.3 inHg) or less are listed. Tropical Cyclones that have been recorded since the start of the 1969–70 Tropical Cyclone year and have reached their peak intensity to the west of 160E are included in the list. The most intense tropical cyclone in the south Pacific, is Cyclone Zoe which formed in 2002, is also the most intense storm in the Southern Hemisphere.

==South Atlantic Ocean==

Due to the fact that tropical cyclones in the South Atlantic are rare, there is no official tropical cyclone season for this region. Despite this, there have been several significant tropical cyclones in the South Atlantic region, notably Cyclone Catarina in March 2004. Tropical and subtropical cyclones with an intensity of below 1000 hPa (29.53 inHg) are listed.
