==Personal life and career==

Popeil was born in New York City in 1935. When he was 6 his parents divorced and he and his brother went to live in Florida with their grandparents. At age 17 in 1952, Ron went with his grandparents to work for his father (Samuel) at his company's (Popeil Brothers) manufacturing facility in Chicago. His grandparents later returned to Florida and Ron remained with his father. He learned his trade from his father, who was also an inventor and salesman of numerous kitchen-related gadgets such as the Chop-O-Matic and the Veg-O-Matic to major department stores. The Chop-O-Matic retailed for US$3.98 and sold over two million units. The invention of the Chop-O-Matic caused a problem that marked the entrance of Ron Popeil into television. The Chop-O-Matic was so efficient at chopping vegetables that it was impractical for salesmen to carry all the vegetables they needed to chop. The solution was to tape the demonstration. Once the demonstration was taped, it was a short step to broadcasting the demonstration as a commercial.
Ron initially operated as a distributor of his father's kitchen products and later formed his own company (Ronco) in 1964. He continued as a distributor for his father and later added additional products from other manufacturers.Mateja, Andrew. The Rise and Fall of the First Popeil Gadget Dynasty. (Mustang: Tate Publishing, 2013), 33 Ron and his father (Samuel) became competitors in the 1970s for the same retail store business.
Popeil received the Ig Nobel Prize in Consumer Engineering in 1993. The awards committee described him as the "incessant inventor and perpetual pitchman of late night television"http://improbable.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html#ig1993 [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2009[/tpl] and awarded the prize in recognition of his "redefining the industrial revolution" with his devices.
In August 2005, he sold his company, Ronco, to Fi-Tek VII, a Denver holding company, for US$55 million, with plans to continue serving as the spokesman and inventor while being able to spend more time with his family. As of 2006, he lived in Beverly Hills, California, with his wife, Robin Popeil and two of his five daughters. Ashley Tisdale is his cousin.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/1123530/Ashley_Tisdale|title= Ashley Tisdale Biography|accessdate= 2009-06-30|publisher= Hollywood.com|archiveurl=http://archive.is/Ok1An|archivedate=2013-01-25[/tpl], expand bio on other side of link.
Although Popeil often receives credit for having been the first to use this phrase, "But wait, there's more," its origin is attributed to the State Fair JAM Auctioneers. The JAM Auctioneers also were the first to use the phrase, "How much would you pay?" Ed Valenti, founder and seller of the Ginsu knife added the word "Now" to that phrase in the 1970s. Like the JAM Auctioneers of past, each time that question was asked, another item would be added to the sale, thus enhancing the audience's and potential buyers' perceived value of the purchase.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]
