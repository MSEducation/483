[[College of Bishops]]

CATEGORIES: Roman Catholic Church organisation, Episcopacy in Roman Catholicism

The term "College of Bishops" is used in Catholic theology to denote the bishops in communion with the Pope (the Bishop of Rome) as a body, not as individuals. The Bishop of Rome (the Pope) is an essential part of that body.

==Authority of the college of bishops==

In Roman Catholic teaching, the college of bishops is the successor to the college of the apostles.New Encyclopaedia Britannica (Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational 1983 ISBN 978-0-85229-400-0), vol. 1, p. 989
While the individual members of the college of bishops are each directly responsible for the pastoral care and governance their own particular Church, the college as whole has full supreme power over the entire church:
The college exercises this supreme and full power in a solemn manner in an ecumenical council, but also through united action even when not gathered together in one place.Code of Canon Law, canon 337 ยง1-2
By present-day canon law it is for the Pope to select and promote the ways in which the bishops are to act collegially, such as in an ecumenical council, and it is for him to convoke, preside over (personally or by his delegates), transfer, suspend, or dissolve such a council, and approve its decrees.Code of Canon Law, canons 337 ยง3 and 338
The Catholic Church teaches that the college of bishops, gathered in council or represented by the Pope, may teach some revealed truth as requiring to be held absolutely and definitively (infallibly).Alan Richardson, John Bowden (editors), The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology (Presbyterian Publishing 1983 ISBN 978-0-664-22748-7), p. 344

==Enunciation of the teaching by the Second Vatican Council==

The Second Vatican Council enunciated the doctrine of the collegiality of the bishops as follows:

==Unique relationship==

The relationship between the college of bishops and the individual bishops and in particular the Bishop of Rome has no secular counterpart, and its practical consequences cannot be deduced from secular models such as the various forms of governance of a state or of a corporation.George Weigel, The Courage to Be Catholic (Basic Books 2004 ISBN 978-0-465-09261-1), p. 119
The doctrine of the collegiality of the bishops as a body was enunciated by the Second Vatican Council which "desired to integrate all the elements which make up the Church, both the mystical and the institutional, the primacy and the episcopate, the people of God and the hierarchy, striking new notes and establishing new balances which would have to be worked out and theologized upon in the lived experience of the Church."Charles M. Murphy, "Collegiality: An Essay Towards Better Understanding" in Theological Studies 46 (1985), p. 41
