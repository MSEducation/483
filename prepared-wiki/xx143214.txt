[[Filespec]]

CATEGORIES: Files

In MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows, filespec is a term meaning a filename identifier that specifies both the name and location of a single file.
The filespec differs from the filename in that the filespec includes a complete specification, within a particular file system, of the file's location. Thus, win.com is a filename and C:\Windows\win.com is a filespec.
