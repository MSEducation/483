[[Climate change in New York City]]

CATEGORIES: Climate change in the United States, Environment of New York City

Climate change in New York City could affect buildings/structures, wetlands, water supply, health, and energy demand, due to the high population and extensive infrastructure in the region.What major climate change impacts are projected for the coming decades? ."CIESIN . Earth Institute at Columbia University , n.d. Web. 16 Oct.2009.  New York is especially at risk if the sea level rises, due to many of the bridges connecting to boroughs, and entrances to roads and rail tunnels. High-traffic locations such as the airports, the Holland Tunnel, the Lincoln Tunnel, and the Passenger Ship Terminal are located in areas vulnerable to flooding.[ref]"How will climate change affect the region’s transportation system?"

Rising temperatures could bring a higher risk of heat related deaths from heat waves and increased concentrations of ground-level ozone (potentially causing asthma and other health concerns).

==Mitigation==

New York has launched a task force to advise on preparing city infrastructure for flooding, water shortages, and higher temperatures."New York Launches Survival Strategy For Climate Change." The Earth Institute, Columbia University. N.p., n.d. Web. 17 Oct. 2009. . To provide for its water needs, the city has secured water rights, built reservoirs, and constructed transportation systems like water tunnels and securing safe drinking water for the near future.McGowan, Alan H.
