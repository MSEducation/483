The Buddha in Hinduism is viewed as an avatar of the god Vishnu. Buddha's teachings deny the authority of the Vedas and consequently Buddhism is generally viewed as a nāstika school (heterodox, literally "It is not so")"In Sanskrit philosophical literature, 'āstika' means 'one who believes in the authority of the Vedas' or 'one who believes in life after death'. ('nāstika' means the opposite of these). The word is used here in the first sense." Satischandra Chatterjee and Dhirendramohan Datta.  An Introduction to Indian Philosophy. Eighth Reprint Edition. (University of Calcutta: 1984). p. 5, footnote 1. from the perspective of orthodox Hinduism.

==Buddha in the Puranas==

The Buddha is described in important Hindu scriptures, including almost all the major Puranas. It is considered that not all of them refer to the same person: some of them refer to other persons, and some occurrences of "buddha" simply mean "a person possessing buddhi"; most of them, however, refer specifically to the founder of Buddhism.[tpl]Cite book | year=1997 | chapter=Buddha as depicted in the Purāṇas |  title = Encyclopaedia of Hinduism, Volume 7 | author1=Nagendra Kumar Singh | publisher=Anmol Publications PVT.

A partial list of major Puranic references of the Buddha is as follows:
In the Puranic texts, he is mentioned as one of the ten Avatars of Vishnu, usually as the ninth one.
Another important scriptures that mentions him as an Avatar is Rishi Parashara's Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra (2:1-5/7).
He is often described as a yogi or yogācārya, and as a sannyāsi. His father is usually called Śuddhodhana, which is consistent with the Buddhist tradition, while in a few places the Buddha's father is named Añjana or Jina. He is described as beautiful (devasundara-rūpa), of yellow skin, and wearing brown-red or red robes.Singh, pp. 262–264
Only a few statements mention the worship of Buddha, e.g. the Varahapurana states that one desirous of beauty should worship him.Singh, p.267
In some of the Puranas, he is described as having taken birth to "mislead the demons":

In the Bhagavata Purana Buddha is said to have taken birth to restore the devas to power:

In many Puranas, the Buddha is described as an incarnation of Vishnu who incarnated in order to delude either demons or mankind away from the Vedic dharma. The Bhavishya Purana contains the following:  At this time, reminded of the Kali Age, the god Vishnu became born as Gautama, the Shakyamuni, and taught the Buddhist dharma for ten years. Then Shuddodana ruled for twenty years, and Shakyasimha for twenty. At the first stage of the Kali Age, the path of the Vedas was destroyed and all men became Buddhists. Those who sought refuge with Vishnu were deluded.Wendy O'Flaherty, Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology. University of California Press, 1976, page 203. 

==Views of the Buddha in Hinduism==

===Buddha as an avatara of Vishnu===

In 8th-century royal circles, the Buddha started to be replaced by Hindu gods in pujas.Inden, Ronald. "Ritual, Authority, And Cycle Time in Hindu Kingship." In JF Richards, ed., Kingship and Authority in South Asia. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1998, p.67, 55 "before the eighth century, the Buddha was accorded the position of universal deity and ceremonies by which a king attained to imperial status were elaborate donative ceremonies entailing gifts to Buddhist monks and the installation of a symbolic Buddha in a stupa....This pattern changed in the eighth century. The Buddha was replaced as the supreme, imperial deity by one of the Hindu gods (except under the Palas of eastern India, the Buddha's homeland)...Previously the Buddha had been accorded imperial-style worship (puja). Now as one of the Hindu gods replaced the Buddha at the imperial centre and pinnacle of the cosmo-political system, the image or symbol of the Hindu god comes to be housed in a monumental temple and given increasingly elaborate imperial-style puja worship." This also was the same period of time the Buddha was made into an avatar of Vishnu.Holt, John. The Buddhist Visnu. Columbia University Press, 2004, p.12,15 "The replacement of the Buddha as the "cosmic person" within the mythic ideology of Indian kingship, as we shall see shortly, occurred at about the same time the Buddha was incorporated and subordinated within the Brahmanical cult of Visnu."
In the Dasavatara stotra section of his Gita Govinda, the influential Vaishnava poet Jayadeva (13th century) includes the Buddha amongst the ten principal avatars of Vishnu and writes a prayer regarding him as follows:
[tpl]quote|O Keshava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of Buddha! All glories to You! O Buddha of compassionate heart, you decry the slaughtering of poor animals performed according to the rules of Vedic sacrifice.|[tpl]cite web|author=John Marshall / Jaya Tirtha Charan Dasa |url=http://www.salagram.net/Dasavatara-page.htm#Sri |title=Dasavatara stotra |publisher=Salagram.net |date=1970-02-18 |accessdate=2012-08-14[/tpl][/tpl]
This viewpoint of the Buddha as  the avatar who primarily promoted non-violence (ahimsa) remains a popular belief amongst a number of modern Vaishnava organisations, including ISKCON.Lecture 1974 by founder of ISKCON - A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada "Because people were addicted so much in violence, in killing the animals, therefore Buddha philosophy was needed"
Additionally, there is the Vaishnava sect of Maharashtra, known as Varkari, who worship Lord Vithoba (also known as Vitthal, Panduranga). Though Vithoba is mostly considered to be a form of the little Krishna, there has been a deep belief for many centuries that Vithoba is a form of Buddha. Many poets of the Maharashtra (including Eknath, Namdev, Tukaram etc.) have explicitly mentioned him as Buddha.

===Buddha as an inspirational figure===

Other prominent modern proponents of Hinduism, such as Radhakrishnan and Vivekananda, consider the Buddha as a teacher of the same universal truth that underlies all religions of the world:
 
 Vivekananda:- May he who is the Brahman of the Hindus, the Ahura Mazda of Zoroastrians, the Buddha of Buddhists, the Jehovah of the Jews, the Father in Heavens of Christians, give strength to you to carry out your noble ideas!Hinduism, in The World's Parliament of Religions, J. H. Barrows (Ed.), Vol. II, Chicago 1893, p. 978.
 
 Radhakrishnan: If a Hindu chants the Vedas on the banks of the Ganges... if the Japanese worship the image of Buddha, if the European is convinced of Christ's mediatorship, if the Arab reads the Koran in the mosque... It is their deepest apprehension of God and God's fullest revelation to them.Eastern Religions and Western Thought, New York 1969, pp. 326–7.

A number of revolutionary figures in modern Hinduism, including Gandhi, have been inspired by the life and teachings of the Buddha and many of his attempted reforms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iop.or.jp/0414/anand.pdf |title=Mahatma Gandhi and Buddhism |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14[/tpl]
Steven Collins sees such Hindu claims regarding Buddhism as part of an effort - itself a reaction to Christian proselytizing efforts in India - to show that "all religions are one", and that Hinduism is uniquely valuable because it alone recognizes this fact.Steven Collins, Selfless Persons. Cambridge University Press, 1990, page 9.

==Interpretations==

According to Wendy Doniger, the Buddha avatar which occurs in different versions in various Puranas may represent an attempt by orthodox Brahminism to slander the Buddhists by identifying them with the demons.O'Flaherty, page 200. Helmuth von Glasenapp attributed these developments to a Hindu desire to absorb Buddhism in a peaceful manner, both to win Buddhists to Vaishnavism and also to account for the fact that such a significant heresy could exist in India.von Glasenapp 1962 page 113, cited in O'Flaherty, page 206.
The times ascribed to one "Buddha" figure are contradictory and some put him in approximately 500 CE, with a lifetime of 64 years, describe him as having killed some persons, as following the Vedic religion, and having a father named Jina, which suggest that this particular figure might be a different person from Siddhārta Gautama.Singh, p.266.

==Opinions and reactions==

Kumārila Bhaṭṭa disregarded the connection of Buddha with Hinduism, he regarded Buddha as the one who "transgressed dharma laid down for ksatriyas and he took himself to the profession of a religious teacher, one who 'deceives himself' and acts contrary to the Vedas."Hindu Response to Religious Pluralism, Page 34, by Pi. Es Ḍāniyēl
B. R. Ambedkar, denied that Buddha was an incarnation of Vishnu. Among the 22 vows he gave to the neo-Buddhists, the 5th vow is "I do not and shall not believe that Lord Buddha was the incarnation of Vishnu. I believe this to be sheer madness and false propaganda."[tpl]cite book|last=Ucko|first=Hans |authorlink=Hans Ucko |title=The people and the people of God|url=http://books.google.com/?id=BP2ZG22FPHYC&pg=PA101&dq=madness|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|page=101|isbn=978-3-8258-5564-2|year=2002[/tpl]
In 1999, at the Maha Bodhi Society in Sarnath, Shankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati of Kanchi matha and Vipassana Acharya, S. N. Goenka after having a mutual discussion, gave a joint communiqué agreeing on the following three points.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vridhamma.org/en1999-13 |title=Fostering Friendly Relations |publisher=Vridhamma.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14[/tpl]
