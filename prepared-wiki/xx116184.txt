Beary Basse (Beary language) is an Indian language mainly spoken by the Muslim communities mainly of "Karnataka (Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts)" and some parts of Kerala ( "in some parts of Kasaragod district" ) who are known as Bearys (Byaris).[tpl]Harvnb|Upadhyaya|1996[/tpl], p. ix Bearys speak a language made of Malayalam idioms with Tulu phonology and grammar. This dialect was traditionally known as Mappila Bashe because of Bearys' close contact with Mappilas. Due to the intensive influence of Tulu for centuries, it is today considered as a language close to both Tulu and Malayalam.On hearing it for the first time, a Malayali from Kasaragod district will feel some similarity to their language but not to a South Kerala Malayali.

==Features==

The language uses the Kannada alphabet for writing. Being a distant cousin of other dialects of Malayalam and surrounded by other linguistic groups for centuries, mainly Tulu and Kannada, the dialect exhibits ancient features as well as modern innovations not seen in other well-known dialects of Malayalam.[tpl]Harvnb|Upadhyaya|1996[/tpl], p. 63
Surrounded by Tulu speaking community, the impact of Tulu on the phonological, morphological and syntactical structure of the dialect is evident.[tpl]Harvnb|Upadhyaya|1996[/tpl], p. 64

===Distinction of ḻ, ṇ, ṟ===

Sounds peculiar to Malayalam such as 'ḻ', 'ṇ', 'ṟ' are not found in this dialect.[tpl]Harvnb|Upadhyaya|1996[/tpl], p.65 'ḷ' and  'ṇ'  are merged with l and n, respectively. 'ṟ' is merged with r and tt, 'tt' to t.[tpl]Harvnb|Upadhyaya|1996[/tpl], p.66 This resembles Tulu.

===Distinction of ‘v’ and ‘b’===

The initial ‘v’ of standard Malayalam corresponds to an initial ‘b’ of Beary Bashe.
The same change has taken place in Tulu, too.
'*'This orthographic representation is phonemic. On a phonetic level, it often becomes [tpl]IPA|ˈʋaːɖaɡə[/tpl], which is closer to the Tulu and Beary Bashe forms. This occurs because of a rule whereby voiced plosive consonants are intervocalic allophones of their unvoiced counterparts. However, this only applies to native Dravidian words, and as "vāṭaka" is a Sanskrit loanword, the prescriptively correct pronunciation is indeed [tpl]IPA|ˈʋaːʈakə[/tpl].

===Distinction of ‘a’ and ‘e’===

The final ‘a’ of standard Malayalam corresponds to the final ‘e’ in Beary Bashe.

===Distinction of ‘n’ and ‘m’===

The word final ‘n’ and ‘m’ of standard Malayalam are dropped in Beary Bashe.

===Degeminated consonants===

Geminated consonants occurring after a long vowel and also after a second short vowel of a word in standard Malayalam get degeminated in Beary Bashe.[tpl]Harvnb|Upadhyaya|1996[/tpl], p.67

===Lexical relations===

Almost all lexical items in Beary Bashe can be related to corresponding lexical items in Malayalam, Tulu or Perso-Arabic origin.[tpl]Harvnb|Upadhyaya|1996[/tpl], p.79
However, some equivalents can only be found in Mappila dialects of Malayalam in Kerala.

==Person endings==

Verbs in old Dravidian languages did not have any person marking.[tpl]Harvnb|Upadhyaya|1996[/tpl], p.68 Person endings of verbs observed in modern Dravidian languages are later innovations.
Malayalam is the only Dravidian language that does not show any verbal person suffixes, so Malayalam verbs can be said to represent the original stage of Dravidian verbs. Person suffixes in Beary Bashe closely resemble those of Tulu, although the past tense in this dialect agrees with that of standard Malayalam in shape as well as in the distribution of allomorphs.

==Arabic influence==

Beary Bashe is strongly influenced by the Arabic language.Arabic and other language influence Most of the Bearys especially in coastal area still use a lot of bearified Arabic words during their daily transaction. Saan, Pinhana, Gubboosu, Dabboosu, Pattir, Rakkasi, Seintaan, Kayeen, are the few words used in Beary Bashe that have their roots in Arabic. Beary Bashe also has words related to Tamil and Malayalam. Tamil and Malayalam Speakers can understand Beary up to an extent of 75%.

===Folk songs===

The Beary Bashe has its own songs and 'ghazals'. Although it is unique in its nature the songs bore resemblance to Moplah Patts (Mappila Songs). The Beary folk songs were rendered during marriage (Mangila) parties, and for many other occasions. Kolkkali patt is a song sung during a cultural play called Kolata which uses short sticks in both the hands while playing, Unjal patt is sung by the girls during the occasion of putting the child to cradle, Moyilanji patt is sung during marriage ceremonies.
Unfortunately modern day Bearys do not know the folk songs sung by their ancestors. Several Beary folk games have also vanished.
One of the famous folk songs sung by Beary women to tease the bride during her wedding celebrations is "appa chudu chudu patima". Elderly ladies of the neighbourhood gather around the bride on the day of Mangila (wedding) to sing those melodious teasing lines.  The first few lines are:
