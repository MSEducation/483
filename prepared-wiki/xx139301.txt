Kiss Alive! 1975–2000 is a collection of live recordings from American hard rock band Kiss. It was released by Universal Music on November 21, 2006. The Millennium Concert (recorded on December 31, 1999 at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, Canada) was originally to be released as Alive IV in 2000 but because Kiss' parent label Mercury was swallowed by the Universal/Vivendi merger, Alive IV was shelved. 
Universal later agreed to Kiss using Mercury to release what would become The Millennium Concert as Alive IV, but then it was shelved indefinitely and the band would release the Symphony: Alive IV album released on Kiss Records/Sanctuary Records in 2003. The 72-page booklet that comes with the set mistakenly credits songwriting for "Cold Gin" to Paul Stanley instead of Ace Frehley.
