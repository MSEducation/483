Tel Arza ([tpl]lang-he|תל ארזה|[/tpl]) is a Hareidi neighborhood in northern Jerusalem. It is bordered by Ezrat Torah on the north and west, Golda Meir Blvd. on the East, and Bar Ilan St. and Yirmiyahu St. on the South.
Tel Arza was established in 1931, as part of the expansion experienced in the Old Yishuv while recovering from the 1929 Palestine riots.
Its name is taken from the Mishna,Tractate Yevamos 16 where it is described as a place where Jews were murdered.
