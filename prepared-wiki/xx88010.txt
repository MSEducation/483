[[Iranian rial]]

CATEGORIES: Currencies of Iran, 1798 introductions, 1932 introductions

The rial (in Persian: ریال; ISO 4217 code IRR) is the currency of Iran and, as of 2014, remains the world's least valued currency unit.http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cur_lea_val_cur_uni_exc_rat_to_1_us_dol-exchange-rate-1-us-dollar
The name derives from the Spanish real, which was for several centuries, the currency in Spain (derived from Latin regalis regal).
Although the "toman" is no longer an official unit of Iranian currency, Iranians commonly express amounts of money and prices of goods in "tomans."  For this purpose, one "toman" equals 10 rials.  Despite this usage, amounts of money and prices of goods are virtually always written in rials.  For example, the sign next to a loaf of bread in a store would state the price in rials, e.g., "10,000 Rials," even though the clerk, if asked, would say that the bread costs "1,000 tomans."
There is no official symbol for the currency but the Iranian standard ISIRI 820 defined a symbol for use on typewriters (mentioning that it is an invention of the standards committee itself) and the two Iranian standards ISIRI 2900 and ISIRI 3342 define a character code to be used for it. The Unicode Standard has a compatibility character defined [tpl]unichar|FDFC|RIAL SIGN|html=[/tpl].For the proposal, see [tpl]cite web|last=Pournader|first=Roozbeh|date=2001-09-20|title=Proposal to add Arabic Currency Sign Rial to the UCS|url=http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n2373.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] It proposes the character under the name of ARABIC CURRENCY SIGN RIAL, which was changed by the standard committees to RIAL SIGN.

==History==

The rial was first introduced in 1798 as a coin worth 1250 dinar or one eighth of a toman. In 1825, the rial ceased to be issued, with the  qiran of 1000 dinars (one tenth of a toman) being issued as part of a decimal system. The rial replaced the qiran at par in 1932, although it was divided into one hundred (new) dinars.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
Prior to decimalisation in 1932, these coins and currencies were used, and some of these terms still have wide usage in Iranian languages and proverbs:[tpl]Cite news| title= Iranian Rial | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/seventhday/story/2007/02/070224_bs_money.shtml | publisher=BBC News Persian | date=2007-02-24 | accessdate=2007-06-10 | language= Persian [/tpl]
