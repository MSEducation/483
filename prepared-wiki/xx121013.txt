Open-Sharedroot is a single-system image clustering solution for Linux.
The Open-Sharedroot Project is based on a clustered filesystem like the Red Hat Global File System (GFS) or Oracle Cluster Filesystem 2 (OCFS2) to build a Shared Root Cluster. Network File System is also supported.
All nodes possess concurrent read/write access to the root filesystem.
Based upon this technology it is possible to boot a cluster directly out of a SAN. This Shared Root variant is known as Diskless Shared Root Cluster.
