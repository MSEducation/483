Mahābhūta is Sanskrit and Pāli for "great element."Or, more literally, "Great Natures." See Rhys Davids & Stede (1921–25), p. 507, entry for "Bhūta." In Buddhism, the "four great elements" (Pali: cattāro mahābhūtāni) are earth, water, fire and air. Buddhism adds a fifth element as explained as sunyata or emptiness whereas in Hinduism the fifth element is ether which relates directly to the 'Spiritual Sky' or Akash.

==Hinduism==

In Hinduism's sacred literature, the "great" or "gross" elements (mahābhūta) are fivefold: space (or "ether"), air, fire, water and earth.See, e.g., Monier-Williams Sanskrit Dictionary where Mahābhūta is defined as: "a great element, gross element (of which 5 are reckoned, viz. ether, air, fire, water, earth ..., as distinguished from the subtle element or Tanmātra...)."  Monier-Williams (1899), p. 798, entry for "Mahā-," retrieved 24 Dec 2008 from "U. Cologne" at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/MWScanpdf/mw0798-mahApheTkArIya.pdf.
For instance, the [tpl]IAST|Taittirīya Upaniṣad[/tpl] describes the five "sheaths" of a person (Sanskrit: puru[tpl]IAST|ṣ[/tpl]a), starting with the grossest level of the five evolving great elements:
In the [tpl]IAST|Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad[/tpl], God is identified as the source of the great elements:
The same Upanishad also mentions, "When earth, water fire, air and akasa arise, when the five attributes of the elements, mentioned in the books on yoga, become manifest then the yogi's body becomes purified by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness, old age and death." (Verse 2.12).Shvetashvatara Upanishad

==Buddhism==

In Buddhism, the four Great Elements (Pali: cattāro mahābhūtāni) are earth, water, fire and air.  Mahābhūta is generally synonymous with catudhātu, which is Pāli for the "Four Elements."Note that the Pāli word dhātu is used in multiple contexts in the Pāli canon.  For instance, Bodhi (2000), pp. 527–8, identifies four different ways that dhātu is used including in terms of the "eighteen elements" and, as in this article, in terms of "the four primary elements."  In early Buddhism, the Four Elements are a basis for understanding that leads one through unbinding of 'Rupa' or materiality to the supreme state of pure 'Emptiness' or Nirvana.

===Definitions===

In the Pali canon,These elaborations on the elements can be found in the Majjhima Nikaya discourses nos. 28, 62, 140.  See below for more information. the most basic elements are usually identified as four in number but, on occasion, a fifth and, to an even lesser extent, a sixth element may be also be identified.

====Four primary elements====

In canonical texts, the four Great Elements refer to elements that are both "external" (that is, outside the body, such as a river) and "internal" (that is, of the body, such as blood).  These elements are described as follows:
These four elements are described as "primary" or "underived" (no-upādā) matter (rūpa), meaning that they cannot be analysed into further atomistic units.  While underived, this does not mean that they are "unconditioned."E.g., see Hamilton (2001), pp. 5–6.  Thus, for instance, according to the 5th-century CE commentarial Visuddhimagga, "as to the proximate cause, each element has the other three as its proximate cause."Buddhaghosa (1999), Vism. XIV.35, p. 443.

====Fifth and sixth elements====

In addition to the above four elements of underived matter, two other elements are occasionally found in the Pali Canon:The "space element" is encountered more frequently in the canonical discourses than is the "consciousness element."  Examples of discourses that include both of these latter elements are DN 33 (Walshe, 1995, p. 500, para. 16), MN 140 (Thanissaro, 1997c), and SN 27.9 (Thanissaro, 1994). This "space element" has also been identified as 'Emptiness' in Buddhist translations. Indeed space and consciousness are similes of 'Emptiness' and are considered lesser expressions or qualities of 'Emptiness.' 'Emptiness' by definition does not exist because it represents the absence of all materiality,and so, to lend a temporal nature and/or material form to the 'Emptiness' element, some modern Buddhist interpretations are currently describing the 'Emptiness element' as space and consciousness. Certainly one does not need to derive a sixth element when the true fifth element of 'Emptiness' is understood which contains both space and consciousness and is beyond space and consciousness in its truer, more pure selfless 'Empty' nature.
According to the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the "space element" is identified as "secondary" or "derived" (upādā).Hamilton (2001), pp. 5, 35 n. 9.  For more information regarding "primary/underived" and "secondary/derived" matter, see the article Rupa (Buddhism).

===Sensory qualities, not substances===

Rūpa (matter) means both materiality and sensibility—it signifies, for example, a tactile object both insofar as that object is tactile and that it can be sensed. Rūpa is never a materiality which can be separated or isolated from cognizance; such a non-empirical category is incongruous in the context of early Buddhism. Rūpa is not a substratum or substance which has sensibility as a property. It functions in early Buddhist thought as perceivable physicality. Matter, or rūpa, is defined in terms of its function; what it does, not what it is.Dan Lusthaus, Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogācāra Buddhism and the Chʼeng Wei-shih Lun. Routledge, 2002, page 183. As such, the four great elements are conceptual abstractions drawn from the sensorium. They are sensorial typologies, and are not metaphysically materialistic.Dan Lusthaus, Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogācāra Buddhism and the Chʼeng Wei-shih Lun. Routledge, 2002, page 184. They are not meant to give an account of matter as constitutive of external, mind-independent reality.Noa Ronkin, Early Buddhist Metaphysics the Making of a Philosophical Tradition. Routledge, 2005, page 56.

===Soteriological uses===

The Four Elements are used in Buddhist texts to both elucidate the concept of suffering (dukkha) and as an object of meditation. The earliest Buddhist texts explain that the four primary material elements are the sensory qualities solidity, fluidity, temperature, and mobility; their characterisation as earth, water, fire, and air, respectively, is declared an abstraction – instead of concentrating on the fact of material existence, one observes how a physical thing is sensed, felt, perceived.Dan Lusthaus, "What is and isn't Yogacara." He specifically discusses early Buddhism as well as Yogacara. http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro-uni.htm.

====Understanding suffering====

The Four Elements pertinence to the Buddhist notion of suffering comes about due to:
Schematically, this can be represented in reverse order as:
Thus, to deeply understand the Buddha's Four Noble Truths, it is beneficial to have an understanding of the Great Elements.

====Meditation object====

In the Mahasatipatthana Sutta ("The Greater Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness," DN 22), in listing various bodily meditation techniques, the Buddha instructs:
In the Visuddhimagga's well-known list of forty meditation objects (kamma[tpl]IAST|ṭṭ[/tpl]hāna), the great elements are listed as the first four objects.
B. Alan Wallace compares the Theravada meditative practice of "attending to the emblem of consciousness" to the practice in Mahamudra and Dzogchen of "maintaining the mind upon non-conceptuality", which is also aimed at focusing on the nature of consciousness.B. Alan Wallace, The bridge of quiescence: experiencing Tibetan Buddhist meditation. Carus Publishing Company, 1998, page 257.

===Buddhist sources===

In the Pali canon, the Four Elements are described in detail in the following discourses (sutta):
The Four Elements are also referenced in:
In addition, the Visuddhimagga XI.27ff has an extensive discussion of the Four Elements.Buddhaghosa (1999), pp. 343ff.
