The Oakland Police Department (OPD) is a civilian law enforcement agency responsible for policing the city of Oakland, California. Since a 2003 incident involving alleged police misconduct, the Oakland Police Department has been under federal oversight.  Ever since, the department has struggled with a potential federal takeover.

==History==

The Oakland Police Department was formed in 1853. It succeeded law enforcement duties for Oakland, California from the Alameda County Sheriff's Office.  Beginning with World War II thousands of poor rural Southern African Americans migrated into Oakland to work in the shipyards.Theoharis, Jeanne F., and Komozi Woodard, eds. Groundwork: Local Black Freedom Movements in America. NYU Press, 2005, pg. 303. http://nyupress.org/books/book-details.aspx?bookId=9679#.UnHysyjevAY  During this same period the Oakland Police Department began to heavily recruit white police officers from the Deep South.Id.Hayes, Edward Cary. Power structure and urban policy: who rules in Oakland?. McGraw-Hill, 1971, pg. 46.  In the years that followed incidents of police brutality increased.Theoharis, Jeanne F., and Komozi Woodard, eds.

In the mid-1960s the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense was formed in Oakland largely to organize armed violent resistance to police brutality.http://www.pbs.org/hueypnewton/people/people_hutton.html  During their “Patrolling the Pigs” operation Black Panthers wearing a uniform of black clothes, black leather jackets, and black berets would follow Oakland police patrols while openly carrying statute books and firearms.[tpl]cite book|last=Self|first=Robert O.|title=American Babylon: Race and the Struggle for Postwar Oakland|date=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-12486-8|page=227[/tpl]   In October 1967 Black Panther founder Huey Newton shot and killed an Oakland police officer during a traffic stop.People v.

Oakland encountered major funding challenges in the years following and the police department became understaffed.  Additionally, community activists say too many OPD officers live outside the city and commute, thus separating themselves from Oakland's daily life. By 2012 over 90% of Oakland police officers resided outside of Oakland.[tpl]cite news|last=BondGraham|first=Darwin|title=The High Costs of Outsourcing Police|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/the-high-costs-of-outsourcing-policeandnbsp/Content?oid=3306199|accessdate=31 October 2013|newspaper=East Bay Express|date=8 August 2012[/tpl]  In an attempt to increase community involvement and address police officer understaffing the people of Oakland in 2004 passed a major tax increase known as Measure Y.http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/CityAdministration/d/MeasureY/  Some have viewed the measure as unsuccessful.http://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR546.html  Oakland is currently the third most dangerous city in the United States.http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-most-dangerous-cities-in-america-2013-06-22
In July 2000 evidence emerged that the respected veteran police officers known as the “Rough Riders” had over the past four years made false arrests, planted evidence, used excessive force, and falsified police reports.http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/OPD/o/BureauofInvestigation/DOWD004998  Scores of drug cases were dropped because of tainted evidence.  The alleged leader of the Riders, Frank Vazquez, fled to Mexico shortly after his criminal indictment and remains a fugitive from justice.[tpl]cite news|last=Zamora|first=Jim Herron|title=Fugitive cop at trial's core|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Fugitive-cop-at-trial-s-core-Veteran-s-absence-2770419.php|accessdate=31 October 2013|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=13 September 2002[/tpl]
The Riders actions resulted in Oakland settling a federal civil rights case, Allen v. City of Oakland,  for nearly $11 million.http://www.oaklandcityattorney.org/PDFS/Riders/Background%20Fact%20Sheet%20on%20NSA.pdf  As part of the Negotiated Settlement Agreement the Oakland Police Department is required to make major reforms to ensure constitutional policing.http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca1/groups/police/documents/webcontent/dowd022066.pdf  The court appointed an independent monitor to oversee implementation of these reforms.
The 2009 Oakland police shootings killed four officers and marked the deadliest day for Californian law enforcement in 40 years.http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca/groups/police/documents/webcontent/dowd005731.pdf
Nine years after the Riders case Negotiated Settlement Agreement the federal court found the Oakland Police Department had failed to fully implement required reforms.http://www.oaklandcityattorney.org/PDFS/Riders/Court%20Order%20re%20Compliance%20Director.pdf  To guarantee compliance with the settlement the U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson appointed former Baltimore Police Department Commissioner Tomas Frazier as Compliance Director in March 2013.[tpl]cite web|last=Artz|first=Matthew|title=Oakland Police Department avoids federal takeover, but agrees to unprecedented control over police|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_22134081/oakland-police-department-avoids-federal-takeover-agrees-unprecedented|work=Oakland Tribune|accessdate=10 May 2013[/tpl]http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/3:2000cv04599/41858/911  The Compliance Director holds unprecedented powers to require corrective action even for conduct not specified in the Negotiated Settlement Agreement.http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/3:2000cv04599/41858/924

==Uniform & Equipment==

The uniform of the OPD consists of a dark navy blue shirt. On the left side of the chest, the badge is pinned. The type of badge differs upon rank. Higher ranks tend to have nicer more detailed badges compared to lower ranking officers. Officers are also issued a standard police hat. Navy blue pants are worn with a blue stripe going down them. They also have belts holding their equipment. For crowd control, OPD officers normally have helmets and more protective gear. Most SWAT uniforms are standard.

===Weapons===

Oakland officers are allowed to carry .40 caliber firearms. They are given a list of certain firearms that they may or may not carry during the academy. The department also issues Glock 19 chambered in 9mm.http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/opd-recalls-hundreds-of-recently-issued-guns/nD3sw/ The X26 taser is often carried with most officers. Officers also carry pepper spray and batons as do most other officers. Cruisers may be armed with Remington 870 shotguns. SWAT Teams often have Colt AR-15 style weapons and H&K UMP.

===Vehicles and Air Support===

Police cruisers normally consist of Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors. Most vehicles are standard. The helicopter for the Oakland Police is named ARGUS after a character in Greek mythology.http://www.oaklandmofo.com/blog/oakland-police-helicopter-to-fly-again/

==Salary==

The salary of Oakland officers is another controversial issue. Police Officer Entry Level current annual salary is $69,912 to $98,088, the second highest in the country.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/johnson/article/Oakland-police-firefighter-pay-devouring-budget-2389276.php | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Chip | last=Johnson | date=11 March 2011[/tpl] Additional pay increases are granted to higher-ranking officers.  Average total compensation for an OPD employee is $162,000.[tpl]cite web|last=Barro|first=Josh|title=Of Course Oakland Can't Afford These Cops|url=http://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2010/07/20/of_course_oakland_cant_afford_these_cops_98581.html|publisher=RealClearMarkets|accessdate=31 October 2013[/tpl]  In 2012, 179 Oakland police officers took home over $200,000 in total compensation.[tpl]cite news|last=BondGraham|first=Darwin|title=Throwing More Money at Police|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/throwing-more-money-at-police/Content?oid=3560590&storyPage=1|accessdate=31 October 2013|newspaper=East Bay Express|date=29 May 2013[/tpl]  Three patrol officers, a sergeant, and a captain each took home over $300,000.  In 2011 the Police Department's costs make up 44% of the city's $400 million general budget.
Unfunded police pension liabilities are a separate high cost to the city.  In 2010 the Oakland Police and Fire Retirement system granted $70 million in benefits to 1,086 pensioners.[tpl]cite news|last=Kuruvila|first=Matthai|title=Oakland's financial time bomb: pensions|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-s-financial-time-bomb-pensions-3743946.php#page-1|accessdate=31 October 2013|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=29 July 2012[/tpl]   In 2012 the city successfully sued the city's pension system to end an estimated $11.5 million in unlawful overpayment to retired police and fire fighters.http://www.oaklandcityattorney.org/news/Press%20releases/PFRS%20ruling.html

==Ranking structure==

All new officers begin at the rank of police officer.  There are civil service promotional opportunities all the way up to captain, then all remaining positions are appointed. The department is headed by a chief. The current interim Chief of the Oakland Police Department Sean Whent, who replaced interim chief Anthony Toribio after only two days,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/breaking-news/ci_23216309/oakland-interim-police-chief-toribio-out-just-two|title=Interim Police Chief Toribio out just two days after appointment|date=2013-05-10|author=Matthew Artz|publisher=Oakland Tribune[/tpl] following Howard Jordan's medical retirement.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/breaking-news/ci_23199564/oakland-police-chief-howard-jordan-announces-medical-retirement|title=Police Chief Howard Jordan announces medical retirement|author=Matthew Artz|publisher=Oakland Tribune|date=2013-05-08[/tpl] Howard had served since 2011, succeeding Anthony Batts. Typically, each division is headed by a captain. A lieutenant will head a division if a captain is not present or non-existent. Lieutenant's duties consist of normal patrol and leadership of lower ranks and sometimes (as specified above) entire divisions. Sergeants, normally don't have any positions in leadership, considering the rank is mainly a promotional opportunity.

==Number of police officers==

On Friday, August 15, 2007, Oakland swore in 22 new graduates from the department's 161st Basic Police Academy, increasing the ranks of the department to 741 filled positions, the most since 1999. At least five veteran officers were expected to be granted disability retirements by the end of the month and up to 20 more were expected to leave by the end of the year. Forty-one potential Oakland officers were in Oakland Police Academy training academy that graduated in January 2008, and another academy was scheduled to start in October. Even with that graduation, there were still more than 60 vacancies in the department where the authorized strength increased by 63 to 802 officers after the passage of Measure Y in November 2004.http://www.insidebayarea.com/search/ci_6657477?source=email

==Controversies==

In 1991 the Oakland Police Department paid a $42,000 settlement to rapper Tupac Shakur after allegedly brutally beating him for jaywalking.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/14/arts/tupac-shakur-25-rap-performer-who-personified-violence-dies.html?pagewanted=2 | work=The New York Times | first=Jon | last=Pareles | title=Tupac Shakur, 25, Rap Performer Who Personified Violence, Dies | date=14 September 1996[/tpl]
In 2003, the city paid $10.9 million to 119 plaintiffs who reportedly had been victimized by members of Oakland Police.

As of 2009, the department has lost 51 officers in the line of duty, 32 officers died as a result of gunfire.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.odmp.org/agency/2872-oakland-police-department-california|title=Oakland Police Department, California, Fallen Officers|accessdate=2009-10-16|publisher=The Officer Down Memorial Page[/tpl]
The 2009 shooting of Oakland police officers took place on Saturday, March 21, 2009, when four Oakland, California, police officers were killed by a felon wanted on a no-bail warrant for a parole violation. The felon, Lovelle Mixon, shot and killed four Oakland police officers, two during a routine traffic stop and two when SWAT team officers attempted to apprehend him two hours later. Mixon staged an ambush of the police from his hiding place and was killed in a barrage of gunfire as officers returned fire in self-defense.Doomed SWAT sergeants didn't expect the rifle, San Francisco Chronicle, March 23, 2009
The 2009 killings made it one of the worst days for law enforcement in California's history. It was the single deadliest attack on California's police officers since the Newhall massacre in 1970, when four California Highway Patrol officers were shot and killed by two men in the Santa Clarita Valley. It was also the deadliest attack on U.S. law enforcement since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/apr/04/3-officers-killed-in-pittsburgh-shooting/ |title=3 officers killed in Pittsburgh shooting |author=Associated Press |publisher=Las Vegas Sun |date=April 4, 2009 |accessdate=April 6, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/cityregion/s_619316.html |title=Shooting ranks as one of deadliest in U.S. law enforcement in decades |publisher=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review |date=April 5, 2009 |accessdate=April 6, 2009[/tpl]  This incident brings to 51 the total number of Oakland police officers killed in the line of duty since 1867.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.odmp.org/agency/2872-oakland-police-department-california |title= Honoring all fallen members of the Oakland Police Department |accessdate=2009-03-22 |work= |publisher= The Officer Down Memorial Page, Inc[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oaklandpolice.com/geninfo/memorial.html |title= Oakland Police Department Memorial Wall | publisher = Oakland Police Department |accessdate=2009-03-22 [/tpl]
