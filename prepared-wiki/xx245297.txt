CATEGORIES: Japanese architecture, Historic districts

[tpl]Nihongo|Groups of Traditional Buildings|伝統的建造物群|Dentōteki Kenzōbutsu-gun[/tpl] is a Japanese category of historic preservation introduced by a 1975 amendment of the law which mandates the protection of groups of traditional buildings which, together with their environment, form a beautiful scene. They can be post towns, castle towns, mining towns, merchant quarters, ports, farming or fishing villages, etc.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/pdf/h23_chapter_06.pdf| title =Preservation and Utilization of Cultural Properties| date =1 April 2011| work = | publisher =Agency for Cultural Affairs| accessdate  =2012-02-20| page = 43[/tpl] The Japanese government's Agency for Cultural Affairs recognizes and protects the country's cultural properties under the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties. 
Municipalities can designate items of particular importance as [tpl]Nihongo|Preservation Districts for Groups of Traditional Buildings|伝統的建造物群保存地区|Dentōteki Kenzōbutsu-gun Hozon-chiku[/tpl] and approve measures to protect them. Items of even higher importance are then designated [tpl]Nihongo|Important Preservation Districts for Groups of Traditional Buildings|重要伝統的建造物群保存地区|Jūyō Dentōteki Kenzōbutsu-gun Hozon-chiku[/tpl] by the central government. The Agency for Cultural Affairs then provides guidance, advice, and funds for repairs and other work. Additional support is given in the form of preferential tax treatment.
As of August 20, 2012, 98 districts have been classified as Important Preservation Districts for Groups of Traditional Buildings, and about 15,300 buildings have been thus designated as Traditional Buildings. An additional district has been designated at prefectural and eighty-three at municipal levels.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/shiteibunkazai/kensu.html |title=Counts of prefectural and municipal cultural properties |language=Japanese |publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs |date=1 May 2010 |accessdate=2012-02-20[/tpl]
