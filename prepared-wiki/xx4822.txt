[[Indium]]

CATEGORIES: Chemical elements, Poor metals, Indium

Indium is a chemical element with symbol In and atomic number 49. This rare, very soft, malleable and easily fusible other heavy metal is chemically similar to gallium and thallium, and shows intermediate properties between these two. Indium was discovered in 1863 and named for the indigo blue line in its spectrum that was the first indication of its existence in zinc ores, as a new and unknown element. The metal was first isolated in the following year. Zinc ores continue to be the primary source of indium, where it is found in compound form. Very rarely the element can be found as grains of native (free) metal, but these are not of commercial importance.
Indium's current primary application is to form transparent electrodes from indium tin oxide (ITO) in liquid crystal displays and touchscreens, and this use largely determines its global mining production. It is widely used in thin-films to form lubricated layers (during World War II it was widely used to coat bearings in high-performance aircraft). It is also used for making particularly low melting point alloys, and is a component in some lead-free solders.
Indium is not known to be used by any organism. In a similar way to aluminium salts, indium(III) ions can be toxic to the kidney when given by injection, but oral indium compounds do not have the chronic toxicity of salts of heavy metals, probably due to poor absorption in basic conditions. Radioactive indium-111 (in very small amounts on a chemical basis) is used in nuclear medicine tests, as a radiotracer to follow the movement of labeled proteins and white blood cells in the body.

==Characteristics==

===Physical===

Indium is a very soft, silvery-white, highly ductile, relatively rare other metal with a bright luster. It is so soft (Mohs hardness 1.2) that the metal can be cut with a knife, as can sodium. It also leaves a visible line on paper.[tpl]cite book |last=Binder |first=Harry H. |year=1999 |title=Lexicon der chemischen Elemente |publisher=S. Hirzel Verlag |isbn=3-7776-0736-3 |language=de [/tpl] Like tin, when it is bent indium emits a high-pitched "cry". Like gallium, indium is able to wet glass. Like both, indium has a low melting point,  156.60 °C (313.88 °F); higher than its lighter homologue, gallium, but lower than its heavier homologue, thallium, and lower than tin. Only mercury, gallium, and most of the alkali metals have lower melting points.[tpl]cite book |last=Dean |first=John A.  |title=Lange's handbook of chemistry (Fifteenth edition) |publisher=McGraw-Hill, Inc|year=523|isbn=0-07-016190-9[/tpl] Its boiling point is, however, moderate, being 2072 °C (3762 °F), which is higher than that of thallium, but lower than that of gallium, showing opposition to the melting points trend. Indium thus has a very large liquid range of around 2000 °C. The density of indium, 7.31 g·cm−3, is also higher than that of gallium, but lower than that of thallium. Below its critical temperature of 3.41 K, indium becomes a superconductor. At standard temperature and pressure, indium crystallizes in the tetragonal crystal system in the space group I4/mmmm (lattice parameters: a = 325 pm, c = 495 pm).

===Chemical===

Indium is an other metal and chemically, is the intermediate element between its group 13 neighbors gallium and thallium. An indium atom has 49 electrons, having an electronic configuration of Kr]4d105s25p1. In its compounds, indium most commonly loses its three outermost electrons, becoming indium(III) ions, In3+, but in some cases the pair of 5s-electrons can stay within the atom, indium thus being oxidized only to indium(I), In+. This happens due to the inert pair effect, which occurs because of the stabilization of 5s-orbital due to relativistic effects, which are stronger closer to the bottom of the periodic table. In(III) is the more stable oxidation state. Thallium (indium's heavier homolog) shows an even stronger effect, making oxidation to thallium(I) more likely than to thallium(III), making +1 the more likely oxidation state,[tpl]de icon[/tpl]  [tpl]cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|year = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 892–893|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman|coauthors = Wiberg, Egon; Wiberg, Nils|chapter =Thallium[/tpl] while gallium (indium's lighter homolog) commonly shows only the +3 oxidation state. Thus while thallium(III) being a moderately strong oxidizing agent, indium(III) is stable and indium(I) is a powerful reducing agent.[tpl]ru icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite book| title = Химия индия| author = Bleshinsky, S. V.; Abramova, V. F.|publisher = Frunze|page=252|year =1958[/tpl]
A number of standard electrode potentials, depending on the reaction under study,[tpl]RubberBible92nd|page=8.20[/tpl] are reported for indium:
Indium does not react with water, but it is oxidized by stronger oxidizing agents, such as halogens or oxalic acid, to give indium(III) compounds. It does not react with boron, silicon or carbon, and the corresponding boride, silicide or carbide are not known. Similarly, reaction between indium and hydrogen has not been observed, but both indium(I) and indium(III) hydrides are known.[tpl]ru icon[/tpl] [tpl]cite book| title = Химия индия| author = Bleshinsky, S. V.; Abramova, V. F.|publisher = Frunze|page=301|year =1958[/tpl]
Indium(III) oxide is formed at high temperatures during reaction between indium and oxygen, with blue flame. It is amphoteric, i. e. it can react with both acids and bases. Its reaction with water results in insoluble indium(III) hydroxide, which is also amphoteric, reacting with alkalies to give indates(III) and with acids to give indium(III) salts:
The hydrolysis of sodium indate(III) gives weak indic acid, HInO2. Out of common indium(III) salts, chloride, sulfate and nitrate are soluble. In water solutions, In3+ and InO2- ions are hydrolyzed to give InOH2+ and HInO2 due to generally amphoteric character of indium(III) ions. Indium(III) compounds are not well-soluble, similarly to thallium(III) compounds; however, indium(III) salts of strong acids, such as chloride, sulfate and nitrate are soluble, hydrolyzing in water solutions. The In3+ ion is colorless in solution because of the absence of unpaired electrons in the d- and f-electron shells.[tpl]cite book| title = Химия индия| author = Bleshinsky, S. V.; Abramova, V. F.|publisher = Frunze|pages=22–37|year =1958| language = Russian[/tpl]
Indium(I) compounds are not as common as indium(III) ones; only chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfide and cyclopentadienyl are well-characterized.  Indium(I) sulfide is the product of reaction between indium and sulfur or indium and hydrogen sulfide, and can be received at 700—1000 °C. Indium(I) oxide black powder is received at 850 °C during reaction between indium and carbon dioxide or during decomposition of indium(III) oxide at 1200 °C. Cyclopentadienylindium(I), which was the first organoindium(I) compound reported,[tpl]cite journal| doi =10.1002/ange.19570692008| title =Metall-cyclopentadienyle des Indiums| year =1957| last1 =Fischer| first1 =E.

P.| journal =Angewandte Chemie| volume =69| issue =20| pages =639–640| language =German[/tpl] is polymer consisting of zigzag chains of alternating indium atoms and cyclopentadienyl complexes.
Less frequently, indium shows intermediate oxidation state +2, which lies between the common ones, most notably in halides, In2X4 and In2X62-.[tpl]cite journal| doi =10.1139/v82-102| title =Neutral complexes of the indium dihalides| year =1982| last1 =Sinclair| first1 =Ian| last2 =Worrall| first2 =Ian J.| journal =Canadian Journal of Chemistry| volume =60| issue =6| pages =695–698[/tpl] Several other compounds are known to combine indium(I) and indium(III), such as InI6(InIIICl6)Cl3,[tpl]cite journal |doi = 10.1002/anie.199108241 |title = In7Cl9—A New"Old" Compound in the System In-Cl |year = 1991 |last1 = Beck |first1 = Horst Philipp |last2 = Wilhelm |first2 = Doris |journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English |volume = 30 |issue = 7 |pages = 824–825[/tpl] InI5(InIIIBr4)2(InIIIBr6),[tpl]cite journal| doi =10.1002/anie.199511261| title =Synthesis, Structure, and Decay of In4Br7| year =1995| last1 =Dronskowski| first1 =Richard| journal =Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English| volume =34| issue =10| pages =1126–1128[/tpl] InIInIIIBr4.
In organic synthesis it is used for indium mediated allylation.

===Isotopes===

Indium occurs naturally on Earth only in two primordial nuclides, indium-113 and indium-115. Indium-115 makes up 95.7% of all indium but it is radioactive, decaying to tin-115 via beta decay with half-life of 4.41[tpl]e|14[/tpl] years, four orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe and nearly 50,000 times longer than that of natural thorium.[tpl]cite journal| last = Audi|first =  Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and  Decay Properties|journal = Nuclear Physics A|volume = 729|pages = 3–128| publisher =  Atomic Mass Data Center|year = 2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.H.[/tpl] This situation is uncommon among stable chemical elements; only indium, tellurium, and rhenium have been shown to have most-abundant isotopes that are radioactive. The less common natural isotope of indium, indium-113, is stable.
Indium has 39 known isotopes, ranging in mass between 97 and 135. Only one of them is stable and one has half-life exceeding 1014 years; these are the only naturally occurring isotopes. The most stable artificial indium isotope is indium-111, which has half-life of approximately 2.8 days. All other isotopes have half-lives shorter than 5 hours. Indium also has 47 meta states, out of which indium-114m1 is the most stable, being more stable than the ground state of any indium isotope (except for the primordial ones).

===Creation and occurrence===

Indium is created via the long-lasting, (up to thousands of years), s-process in low-medium mass stars (which range in mass between 0.6 and 10 masses of Sun). When a silver-109 atom (the isotope of which approximately half of all silver in existence is composed), catches a neutron, it undergoes a beta decay to become cadmium-110. Capturing further neutrons, it becomes cadmium-115, which decays to indium-115 via another beta decay. This explains why the radioactive isotope predominates in abundance compared to the stable one.[tpl]cite journal|first= A. I. | last= Boothroyd| title = Heavy elements in stars| journal= Science| volume= 314 | issue= 5806| year= 2006 | pages= 1690–1691 | doi= 10.1126/science.1136842 | pmid = 17170281[/tpl]
Indium is 61st most abundant element in the Earth's crust at approximately 49 ppb, making indium approximately as abundant as mercury.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/elterr.html| title = Elements, Terrestrial Abundance| publisher = www.daviddarling.info| accessdate = 2007-04-14[/tpl]
Fewer than 10 indium minerals are known, such as dzhalindite (In(OH)3) and indite (FeIn2S4),[tpl]cite journal|journal = The Canadian Mineralogist|year = 1971|volume = 10|issue = 5|pages = 781–786|title = A second occurrence of dzhalindite|first = J. K.|last = Sutherland|url = http://canmin.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/5/781[/tpl] but none of these occurs in significant deposits.
Based on content of indium in zinc ore stocks, there is a worldwide reserve of approximately 6,000 tonnes of economically viable indium.[tpl]cite web|title = Mineral Commodities Summary 2007: Indium|publisher = United States Geological Survey|format = PDF|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/indium/indiumcs07.pdf|accessdate = 2007-12-26[/tpl]  However, the Indium Corporation, the largest processor of indium, claims that, on the basis of increasing recovery yields during extraction, recovery from a wider range of base metals (including tin, copper and other polymetallic deposits) and new mining investments, the long-term supply of indium is sustainable, reliable and sufficient to meet increasing future demands.
This conclusion may be reasonable considering that silver, which is one-third as abundant as indium in the Earth's crust,[tpl]cite web|date=September 6, 2009|title = Indium Price Supported by LCD Demand and New Uses for the Metal|url = http://geology.com/articles/indium.shtml[/tpl] is currently mined at approximately 18,300 tonnes per year,[tpl]cite web|title = Top World Silver Producers|url = http://www.nma.org/pdf/g_silver_producers.pdf|format = PDF|work = World Silver Survey 2007[/tpl] which is 40 times greater than current indium mining rates.

==History==

In 1863, the German chemists Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter were testing ores from the mines around Freiberg, Saxony. They dissolved the minerals pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena and sphalerite in hydrochloric acid and distilled raw zinc chloride. As it was known that ores from that region sometimes contain thallium they searched for the green emission lines with spectroscopy. The green lines were absent but a blue line was present in the spectrum. As no element was known with a bright blue emission they concluded that a new element was present in the minerals. They named the element with the blue spectral line indium, from the indigo color seen in its spectrum.[tpl]cite journal|title = Ueber das Indium|author = Reich, F.|coauthors = Richter, T.|journal = Journal für Praktische Chemie|volume = 90|issue = 1|pages = 172–176|year = 1863|doi = 10.1002/prac.18630900122|language=German[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title = Indium|last = Venetskii|first = S.|journal = Metallurgist|volume = 15|issue = 2|pages = 148–150|year = 1971|doi = 10.1007/BF01088126[/tpl] Richter went on to isolate the metal in 1864.[tpl]cite journal|title = Ueber das Indium|author = Reich, F.|coauthors = Richter, T.|journal = Journal für Praktische Chemie|volume = 92 |issue = 1 |pages = 480–485 |year = 1864|doi = 10.1002/prac.18640920180|language=German[/tpl] At the World Fair 1867 an ingot of [tpl]convert|0.5|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] was presented.[tpl]cite book|title = Indium: Geology, Mineralogy, and Economics|first = Ulrich|last = Schwarz-Schampera|coauthors = Herzig, Peter M.|publisher = Springer|year = 2002|isbn = 978-3-540-43135-0|url = http://books.google.com/?id=k7x_2_KnupMC&pg=PA1[/tpl] 
In 1924, indium was found to have a valuable ability to stabilize non-ferrous metals, which was the first significant use for the element.[tpl]cite journal |doi = 10.1021/ed011p270 |title = A story of indium |year = 1934 |last1 = French |first1 = Sidney J. |journal = Journal of Chemical Education |volume = 11 |issue = 5 |page = 270|bibcode = 1934JChEd..11..270F [/tpl] It took until 1936 for the U.S. Bureau of Mines to list indium as a commodity, and even in early the 1950s only very limited applications for indium were known, the most important of which was making light-emitting diodes and coating bearings for aircraft engines during World War II. The start of production of indium-containing semiconductors started in 1952. The development and widespread use of indium-containing nuclear control rods increased demand during the 1970s, and the use of indium tin oxide in liquid crystal displays increased and became the major application by 1992.[tpl]cite book | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=k7x_2_KnupMC&pg=PA1 | page =1 | chapter = history | title = Indium: Geology, mineralogy, and economics | isbn = 978-3-540-43135-0 | author1 = Schwarz-Schampera | first1 = Ulrich | last2 = Herzig | first2 = Peter M | last3 = Rohstoffe | first3 = Bundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften und | date = 2002-06-10[/tpl][tpl]cite book | url = http://ia600402.us.archive.org/30/items/unitedstatesmine00brob/unitedstatesmine00brob.pdf | editor = Brobst, Donald Albert; Pratt, Walden P.| author = Weeks, R.A. | title =  Mines and mineral resources | year = 1973 | chapter =  Gallium, germanium, and indium | pages = 237–246[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Mineral Commodity Profile Indium| first1 =John D. |last1= Jorgenson |first2 = Micheal W. |last2= George | url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1300/2004-1300.pdf| publisher = United States Geological Survey[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title= Canadian Minerals Yearbook | year =2007 | url = http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/mms-smm/busi-indu/cmy-amc/content/2007/31.pdf| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110927172018/http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/mms-smm/busi-indu/cmy-amc/content/2007/31.pdf| archivedate = 2011-09-27[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Recycling Rates of Metals: A Status Report|url=http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/metals_recycling/files/pdf/Metals_Recycling_Rates_110412.pdf|publisher=United Nations Environmental Programme|accessdate=August 2, 2011[/tpl]

==Production==

The lack of indium mineral deposits and the fact that indium is enriched in sulfidic lead, tin, copper, iron and predominately in zinc deposits, makes zinc production the main source for indium. The indium is leached from slag and dust of zinc production. Further purification is done by electrolysis. The exact process varies with the exact composition of the slag and dust.
Indium is produced mainly from residues generated during zinc ore processing but is also found in iron, lead, and copper ores.[tpl]cite journal|journal = Minerals Engineering|volume = 16|issue = 8|year = 2003|pages = 687–694|doi = 10.1016/S0892-6875(03)00168-7 |title = Processing of indium: a review|first = A.

It has been estimated that there are fewer than 14 years left of indium supplies, based on current rates of extraction, demonstrating the need for additional recycling.[tpl]cite web|title=How much is left?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-much-is-left|publisher=ScientificAmerican|accessdate=16 January 2013[/tpl]

==Applications==

The first large-scale application for indium was as a coating for bearings in high-performance aircraft engines during World War II. Afterward, production gradually increased as new uses were found in fusible alloys, solders, and electronics. In the 1950s, tiny beads of it were used for the emitters and collectors of PNP alloy junction transistors. In the middle and late 1980s, the development of indium phosphide semiconductors and indium tin oxide thin films for liquid crystal displays (LCD) aroused much interest. By 1992, the thin-film application had become the largest end use.[tpl]cite web|title = Mineral Yearbook 2007: Indium|publisher = United States Geological Survey|format = PDF |first = Amy C.|last = Tolcin|url =http://minerals.usgs.gov/mineralofthemonth/indium.pdf|accessdate = 200-02-03[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title = Chemistry of Aluminium, Gallium, Indium, and Thallium |first =Anthony John|last = Downs|publisher = Springer|year = 1993|isbn = 978-0-7514-0103-5|pages = 89 and 106|url = http://books.google.com/?id=v-04Kn758yIC[/tpl]

==Precautions and health issues==

Pure indium in metal form is considered nontoxic by most sources. In the welding and semiconductor industries, where indium exposure is relatively high, there have been no reports of any toxic side-effects. Indium compounds, like aluminum compounds, complex with hydroxyls to form insoluble salts in basic conditions, and are thus not well-absorbed from food, giving them fairly low oral toxicty. Soluble indium(III) is toxic when delivered parenterally, however, causing damage primarily to the kidney (both inner and outer parts), but additionally to heart and liver, and may be teratogenic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/in.htm |title = Indium|publisher = Lenntech.com|year = 1998[/tpl] Other indium compounds are toxic when administered outside the gastrointestinal tract: for example, anhydrous indium trichloride (InCl3) and indium phosphide (InP) are quite toxic when delivered into the lungs (the latter is a suspected carcinogen).[tpl]cite journal|last = Tanaka|first = A.|coauthors = Hirata, M.; Omura, M., |title = Pulmonary toxicity of indium-tin oxide and indium phosphide after intratracheal instillations into the lung of hamsters|journal = Journal of the Occupational Health|year = 2002|volume = 44|pages = 99–102|doi = 10.1539/joh.44.99|issue = 2[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last = Blazka|first = M.
