(Leading American microeconomics college textbook)</ref>[tpl]r|ec20110127[/tpl] the burger methodology has some limitations. In many countries, eating at international fast-food chain restaurants such as [[McDonald's]] is relatively expensive in comparison to eating at a local restaurant, and the demand for Big Macs is not as large in countries such as [[India]] as in the United States. Social status of eating at fast food restaurants such as McDonald's in a local market, what proportion of sales might be to expatriates, local taxes, levels of competition, and import duties on selected items may not be representative of the country's economy as a whole.
In addition, there is no theoretical reason why non-tradable goods and services such as property costs should be equal in different countries: this is the theoretical reason for PPPs being different from market exchange rates over time. The relative cost of high-margin products, such as essential pharmaceutical products, or cellular telephony might compare local capacity and willingness to pay, as much as relative currency values.
Nevertheless, McDonald's is also using different commercial strategies which can result in huge differences for a product. Overall, the price of a Big Mac will be a reflection of its local production and delivery cost, the cost of advertising (considerable in some areas), and most importantly what the local market will bear — quite different from country to country, and not all a reflection of relative currency values.
In some markets, a high-volume and low-margin approach makes most sense to maximize profit, while in others a higher margin will generate more profit. Thus the relative prices reflect more than currency values. For example, a hamburger costs only [tpl]€|1[/tpl] in France, and [tpl]€|1.50[/tpl] in Belgium, but overall, McDonald's restaurants are cheaper in Belgium.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] Prices of Big Macs can also vary greatly between different areas within a country. For example, a Big Mac sold in New York City will be more expensive than one sold at a McDonald's located in a rural area of a neighboring state.
One other example is that Russia has one of the cheapest Big Macs, at the same time as Moscow usually is near the top on lists of costs for visiting business people. Standard food ingredients are cheap in Russia, while restaurants suitable for business dinners with English speaking staff are expensive.

===Manipulation===

Critics of the presidency of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in Argentina and many economists believe that the government has for years falsified consumer price data to understate the country's true inflation rate.[tpl]r|politi20111124[/tpl] The Economist stated in January 2011 that Big Mac index "does support claims that Argentina’s government is cooking the books. The gap between its average annual rate of burger inflation (19%) and its official rate (10%) is far bigger than in any other country."[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/node/18014576?story_id=18014576 | title=Lies, flame-grilled lies and statistics | work=The Economist | date=27 January 2011 | accessdate=10 June 2012[/tpl] That year the press began reporting on unusual behavior by the more than 200 Argentinean McDonald's restaurants. They no longer prominently advertised Big Macs for sale and the sandwich, both individually and as part of value meals, was being sold for an unusually low price compared to other items. Guillermo Moreno, Secretary of Commerce in the Kirchner government, reportedly forced McDonald's to sell the Big Mac at an artificially low price to manipulate the country's performance on the Big Mac index.[tpl]r|sanguinetti20120608[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/24/argentinas-big-mac-attack/ | title=Argentina’s Big Mac Attack | work=The New York Times | date=24 November 2011 | accessdate=10 June 2012 | author=Politi, Daniel[/tpl] In June 2012 the price of the Big Mac value meal suddenly rose by 26%, closer to that of other meals, after The Economist, The New York Times, and other media reported on the unusual pricing. A Buenos Aires newspaper stated "Moreno loses the battle".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cronista.com/economiapolitica/Moreno-pierde-la-batalla-el-Big-Mac-sale-del-freezer-y-aumenta-26-su-precio-20120608-0012.html | title=Moreno pierde la batalla: el Big Mac sale del freezer y aumenta 26% su precio | language=Spanish | work=El Cronista | date=8 June 2012 | accessdate=15 June 2012 | author=Sanguinetti, Andrew | location=Buenos Aires, Argentina[/tpl]

===Comparison issues===

The Big Mac (and virtually all sandwiches) vary from country to country with differing nutritional values, weights and even nominal size differences.
Not all Big Mac burgers offered by the chain are exclusively beef. In India — which is a predominantly Hindu country — beef burgers are not available at any McDonald's outlets. The chicken Maharaja Mac serves as a substitute for the Big Mac.
There is a lot of variance with the exclusively Beef "Big Mac": the Australian version of the Big Mac has 22% less energy than the Canadian version, and is 8% lighter than the version sold in Mexico.[tpl]cite news|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Big Mac?

On 1 November 2009, all three of the McDonald's in Iceland closed, primarily due to the chain's high cost of importing most of the chain's meat and vegetables from the Eurozone. At the time, a Big Mac in Iceland cost 650 krona ($5.29), and the 20% price increase that would have been needed to stay in business would have increased that cost to 780 krona ($6.36).Iceland Says Bye to the Big Mac, CBS News, 26 October 2009McDonalds leaves Iceland.
