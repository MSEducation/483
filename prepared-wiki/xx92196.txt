The body of water called Lake Placid is in the Adirondack Mountains in northern New York in the United States of America.   The lake is approximately [tpl]convert|2170|acre|km2[/tpl], and has an average depth of about [tpl]convert|50|ft|m[/tpl].  It is located in the towns of North Elba and St. Armand, both in Essex County.
The lake, which borders the northern part of the village of Lake Placid, New York, is a source of drinking water for the town, and maintaining water quality in the lake is a major local issue. The lake is fed by springs and mountain streams, and because most of the houses are unoccupied much of the year, the water remains clean. 
There are nearly 300 houses on the lake shore. 
Local efforts to combat aquatic invasive species have been successful, aided by a boat cleaning station where powerboats are put into the water.  
The lake has produced record lake trout.
