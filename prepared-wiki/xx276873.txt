Science Expo is a Canadian non-profit organization connecting high school students to the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) community and opportunities in the field. Known for its annual conferences, Science Expo has attracted hundreds of high school students across Ontario to convene and connect with fellow like-minded students as well as leading innovators and scientists. 

==History Science Expo's History http://www.science-expo.org/about-us/history/ 2012.==

In 2009 at the Canadian Wide Science Fair (CWSF), five individuals wanted to create an organization to put on their high school resumes.Youth Science Ontario. "Science Fair Alumni Give Back By Creating Science Expo." http://www.youthscienceontario.ca/success-stories/science-fair-alumni-give-back-creating-science-expo 2013. Founded in the following year by Susie Pan and Hillary Dawkins as co-presidents, Science Expo began as a symposium in Guelph, Ontario and garnered 200 attendees.
As of 2012, it has since expanded into full-day conferences at the Ontario Science Centre, attracting students all over the Greater Toronto Area. In addition, Science Expo placed second in the Youth Social Innovation Capital Fund (YSI-CF Langille, Allison. "The Youth Social Innovation Capital Fund Launches with Pitch Competition." http://socialfinance.ca/blog/post/the-youth-social-innovation-capital-fund-launches-with-pitch-competition) in 2012. However, Science Expo has always remained student-run and is organized by high school and university students.

Furthermore, Science Expo has created additional programs such as meriSTEM, a two-stage design competition for any high school student to creatively showcase any aspect of STEM. Launched in 2013, the winner of the first meriSTEM competition was Netra Unni whose project displayed nuclear programming to create stem cells.WNN.
