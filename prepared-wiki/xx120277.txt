The Lure of the Grand Canyon is the eleventh album by country singer Johnny Cash.  It was released in 1961 (see 1961 in music) by Columbia Records, and Cash's contribution was only that of spoken narration. 
The album consists primarily of a recording of Ferde Grof√©'s Grand Canyon Suite, conducted by Andre Kostelanetz, and includes authentic sounds recorded in the Grand Canyon itself. The spoken commentary by Cash is the sixth and last track, preceded by the five movements of the suite, and describes a day spent visiting the famous canyon. While The Lure of the Grand Canyon is sometimes considered one of the earliest concept albums in country music history, its country music content is minimal, and Cash had already released a concept album entitled Ride This Train the year before.
