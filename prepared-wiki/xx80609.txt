The White River is a tributary of the Green River, approximately [tpl]convert|195|mi[/tpl] long,U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed March 18, 2011 in the U.S. states of Colorado and Utah. Flows vary from 450 ft³/s (13 m³/s) late summers in dry years to well over 12,000 ft³/s (340 m³/s) in spring.
It rises in two forks in northwestern Colorado in northeastern Garfield County in the Flat Tops Wilderness Area in the White River National Forest. The North Fork rises in Wall Lake, and flows northwest, then southwest. The South Fork rises ten miles south of the north, flows southwest, then northwest, past Spring Cave. The two forks join near Buford in eastern Rio Blanco County, forming the White. It flows west, then northwest, past Meeker (site of the White River Museum), and across the broad valley between the Danforth Hills on the north and the Roan Plateau on the south. Downstream from Meeker, it is joined by Piceance Creek and Yellow Creek. In western Rio Blanco County, it turns southwest, flows past Rangely, where it is joined by Douglas Creek, and into Uintah County, Utah, where it joins the Green two miles south of Ouray.
The White River is navigable by small boats throughout most of its length. But in low water years the water level may be too low for navigation for a period of several months.
