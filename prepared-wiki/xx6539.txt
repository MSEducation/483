[[List of literary cycles]]

CATEGORIES: Literature lists

Literary cycles are groups of stories grouped around common figures, often (though not necessarily) based upon mythical figures or loosely on historic ones. Cycles which deal with an entire country are sometimes referred to as matters. A fictional cycle is often referred to as a mythos.
