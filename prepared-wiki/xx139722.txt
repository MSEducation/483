[[Artist Placement Group]]

CATEGORIES: British art

The Artist Placement Group (APG) was conceived by Barbara Steveni in London in 1965,[tpl]cite web| title = e-flux: Artist Placement Group, APG | url = http://e-flux.com/timebank/event/artist-placement-group-apg | date = 2012-02-14 | accessdate = 02/01/2014[/tpl] and established in 1966 as an artist-run organisation seeking to refocus art outside the gallery, predominantly through attaching an artist in a business or governmental context for a period of time.
As well as these placements, the organisation exhibited in galleries - for example in INN70 at the Hayward Gallery in London,1971 and other venues including a retrospective review at Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1977 and at documenta 6 in the same year.
Among the participants were Barbara Steveni, John Latham, Barry Flanagan, David Hall, Jeffrey Shaw, Stuart Brisley, Hugh Davies, Andrew Dipper, David Toop and Ian Breakwell.
After 1989 the organisation became known as Organisation and Imagination (O+I). John Latham died in 2006 just after the Tate gallery in London purchased the APG archives.
In 2012 Raven Row Gallery, London, revisited APG's early years by staging a major retrospective of work carried out including examples of some of its placements together with related documentation much of it loaned by the Tate.
