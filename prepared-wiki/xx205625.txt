The Oxfam Glamour Models are a noise rock band from Middlesbrough in the North East of England. They signed to Marquis Cha Cha records in 2006 but split in 2007. As of August 2011 they are once again active. Members include Emmett (Vocals), Paul Dye (Guitar), Peachy (Guitar)(2004-2007) and Ryan Pilot (Drums).  The band are often referred to as The Oxford Glamour Girls for obvious reasons.  As of 2012 Oli Heffernan (Year of Birds, Idiot Savant, British Lichen Society) has been playing bass for the band.

It was described as "energetic and inventive and wild-eyed and noisy and suggestive of glamour and attitude",[tpl]cite web | last=Holliy | url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/7385/reviews/791871 | title=Oxfam Glamour Models: Kick Out The Grams/Postmodern Stars | work=Drowned in Sound | date=2 May 2006[/tpl] with Emmet's vocals described as "the sound of a sleazy Brett Anderson being injected with Johnny Rottenâ€™s bile".[tpl]cite web | last=Cummings | first=Bill | url=http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/content/content_detail.php?id=208&type=Singles | title=The Oxfam Glamour Models  - Kick Out The Grams | work=God is in the TV | date=1 May 2006[/tpl] Following the singles success the band embarked on a lengthy tour of the UK and an appearance at the 2006 London Calling Festival at the Paradiso Amsterdamn with label mates Bromheads Jacket. 
Having appeared on the cover of both the NME and Artrocker in the summer by November 2006, they released the follow-up to "Kick out the Grams", "8 Cans Yeah", described by Drowned in Sound as "a lo-fi mashup of The Rakes on a bender and Eddie Argos with the rage".Marwood, Ben (2006) "Oxfam Glamour Models: 8 Cans Yeah / Book Club", Drowned in Sound, 5 December 2006 
After more gigs, the band arranged studio time to record tracks for a possible album. These included 'Crack', a re-recording of 'Loves Young Scum' and several others. However, these tracks were scrapped and the band finally decided not to make an album or any other future release at present.
Following a year of line up problems, relocations and lost momentum, The Oxfam Glamour Models split in December 2007.
Paul Dye and Peter Holt went on to form, British Lichen Society. Paul was later replaced by Oli Heffernan, who has since replaced Luke Tanner in the current Oxfam Glamour Models line up.
Paul Emmett and Lucian Tanner went on to form, Education Education Education.
In July 2011 a new Facebook was set up to announce a reformation. In November, a gig was announced at the Georgian Theatre in Stockton on Tees for 16 December, the same venue they played their last gig almost exactly four years earlier.
According to the Facebook site, Peter "Peachy" Holt will not be involved in the new line up.
