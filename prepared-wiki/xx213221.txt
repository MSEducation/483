"Real Face" is a song written by Shikao Suga, Joker, Tak Matsumoto and Chokkaku for the debut single and debut album of the Japanese boy band, KAT-TUN. It was released on March 22, 2006, and debuted on the Oricon daily and weekly singles charts at number 1 where it stayed on the latter for 3 weeks. The song would eventually sell over a million copies by the end of 2006 and was named Japan's best-selling single of the year.

==Song information==

There are two different versions of the song in KAT-TUN's discography. The single version is not the same song on Best of KAT-TUN which is named "Real Face #1" and features a different arrangement. "Real Face #1" was used as the theme song to band member Junnosuke Taguchi's drama two-part television movie, Happy!, aired by TBS on April 7, 2006 and December 26, 2006 respectively.

==Release and promotion==

The single was released in two pressings - a normal edition containing the instrumental versions of all the songs released in this single and six limited editions containing the three songs with a music video of the single focusing on each respective member. As such, there are seven different covers. It was part of a tripartite release by the group and became available in stores on the same day as KAT-TUN's debut album, Best of KAT-TUN, and the tie-in DVD for the single, Real Face Film. All three releases were also available as a box set which has since gone out of print.Box Set: "Real Face" + "Best of KAT-TUN" + "Real Face Film" (Single + Album + DVD) (Limited Release), CD Japan; retrieved on July 28, 2008.
