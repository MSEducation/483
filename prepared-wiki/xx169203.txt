==History==

===Early years===

The organization traces its roots to 1904 when representatives of the Broadway theatres working with New York publicists organized the Press Agents' Association to exchange lists of people who were fraudulently receiving complimentary passes to shows.The Story of The Friars from friarsclub.com Shortly thereafter it began its tribute dinners to theatrical celebrities with the first being Clyde Fitch; impresario Oscar Hammerstein was toasted in 1908, the year the Friars moved into a club house at 107 West 47th Street.  
The first Friars Frolics were held in 1911, with Abbott George M. Cohan working with Will Rogers, Irving Berlin (who wrote "Alexander's Ragtime Band" for the event), and Victor Herbert; the money generated by the Frolics enabled them to purchase 106-108-110 West 48th Street. Under Abbott Cohan it laid a cornerstone on the building in 1915. In 1924 Walter Donaldson wrote the music for "My Blue Heaven" one afternoon while waiting in the club for his turn at the billiard table.[tpl]cite book| first= David|last= Ewen | title=All the Years of American Popular Music | location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey | publisher= Prentice-Hall | year=1977[/tpl] In 1950 Sam Levenson and fellow comedian Joe E.

In the 1960s, The Friars' Club, The Lambs Club, and The Players Club were often confused. Columnist Earl Wilson put it this way in 1964: "Long ago a New Yorker asked the difference between the Lambs, Friars, and Players, since the membership was, at the time, predominantly from Broadway." It was left to "a wit believed to have been George S. Kaufman" to draw the distinction: "The Players are gentlemen trying to be actors, the Lambs are actors trying to be gentlemen, and the Friars are neither trying to be both."
Michael Gyure is the Executive Director of the Friars Club and of its charitable arm the Friars Foundation.

==Roasts==

Between 1998 and 2002, the roasts were aired on Comedy Central.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]
