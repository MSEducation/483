[[European Papers on the New Welfare]]

CATEGORIES: Works of sociology

The European Papers on the New Welfare are a series of papers in English (with an Italian version) published since 2005 by The Risk Institute (Geneva, Trieste, Zagreb). The subtitle of the series, "The Counter-ageing Society", underlines the major goal: to promote and to publish studies, based on academic analyses and practical experiences, on issues related to the lengthening of the life cycle. This involves the understanding and monitoring of the impact of scientific advances in many fields (biology, medicine, gerontology, communications, etc.). Key is the promotion of an active life well beyond 60 years of age, and developing adequate learning and education systems as societal integration tools. All this in view of many reforms needed to develop a sustainable New Welfare (including employment, pensions schemes, health and ageing, etc.)
