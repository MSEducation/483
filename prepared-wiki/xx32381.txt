Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area is a census area located in the U.S. state of Alaska.  It is part of the unorganized borough and therefore has no borough seat. Its largest communities are Craig and Metlakatla. It was formerly part of the Census Bureau's Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan Census Area, but the name was changed in 2008 after most of the Outer Ketchikan (except the parts near the community of Hyder, and Annette Island) was lost to annexation by the Ketchikan Gateway Borough.  As of the 2000 census, the population of the then-Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan Census Area was 6,146.
