The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma, meaning "red people". It is also known informally by its nickname, The Sooner State, honoring the European settlers, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory.  The name was settled upon statehood,  Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name.  On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as Oklahomans or, informally "Okies", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City.
A major producer of natural gas, oil, and agricultural products, Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation, energy, telecommunications, and biotechnology. In 2007, it had one of the fastest growing economies in the nation, ranking among the top states in per capita income growth and gross domestic product growth.[tpl]cite web |url=http://staging.okcommerce.gov/test1/dmdocuments/Gross_Domestic_Product_by_State_2000_0706071891.pdf| title= Gross Domestic Product by State (2005–2006) | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Commerce| format=PDF|accessdate=August 1, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070808074216/http://staging.okcommerce.gov/test1/dmdocuments/Gross_Domestic_Product_by_State_2000_0706071891.pdf|archivedate=August 8, 2007[/tpl] Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma's primary economic anchors, with nearly two-thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/metro_general/2006/CBSA-EST2006-01.csv | title=Annual Estimates of the Population of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2006 | work=United States Census Bureau | format=csv | accessdate=September 15, 2007|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5QE4IXsae |archivedate = July 10, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
With small mountain ranges, prairie, mesas, and eastern forests, most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains and the U.S. Interior Highlands—a region especially prone to severe weather. In addition to having a prevalence of English, German, Scottish, Scotch-Irish and Native American ancestry, more than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma, second only to California.
Oklahoma is located on a confluence of three major American cultural regions and historically served as a route for cattle drives, a destination for southern settlers, and a government-sanctioned territory for Native Americans.

==Etymology==

The name Oklahoma comes from the Choctaw phrase okla humma, literally meaning red people. Choctaw Chief Allen Wright suggested the name in 1866 during treaty negotiations with the federal government regarding the use of Indian Territory, in which he envisioned an all-Indian state controlled by the United States Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Equivalent to the English word Indian, okla humma was a phrase in the Choctaw language used to describe the Native American race as a whole. Oklahoma later became the de facto name for Oklahoma Territory, and it was officially approved in 1890, two years after the area was opened to white settlers.[tpl]cite web| title = Chronicles of Oklahoma| first= Muriel | last=Wright | publisher=Oklahoma State University|date=June 1936 | url = http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v014/v014p156.html | accessdate = July 31, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | year=2007| url=http://www.state.ok.us/osfdocs/stinfo2.html | title=Oklahoma State History and Information | work=A Look at Oklahoma | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation | accessdate=June 7, 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060716115959/http%3A//www.state.ok.us/osfdocs/stinfo2.html |archivedate = July 16, 2006|deadurl=yes[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last=Merserve | first=John | year=1941 | url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v019/v019p314.html | title=Chief Allen Wright| work=Chronicles of Oklahoma | accessdate=June 7, 2006[/tpl]

==Geography==

Oklahoma is the 20th-largest state in the United States, covering an area of 69,898 square miles (181,035 km2), with 68,667 square miles (177847 km2) of land and 1,281 square miles (3,188 km2) of water.[tpl]cite web| title = Land and Water Area of States, 2000| publisher=Information Please| year = 2000| url = http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0108355.html | accessdate = November 22, 2006[/tpl] It is one of six states on the Frontier Strip, and lies partly in the Great Plains near the geographical center of the 48 contiguous states. It is bounded on the east by Arkansas and Missouri, on the north by Kansas, on the northwest by Colorado, on the far west by New Mexico, and on the south and near-west by Texas.
The western edge of the Oklahoma panhandle is out of alignment with its Texas border.  The Oklahoma/New Mexico border is actually 2.1 to 2.2 miles east of the Texas line.  The border between Texas and New Mexico was set first as a result of a survey by Spain in 1819.  It was then set along the 103rd Meridian.  In the 1890s, when Oklahoma was formally surveyed using more accurate surveying equipment and techniques, it was discovered that the Texas line was not set along the 103rd Meridian.  Surveying techniques were not as accurate in 1819, and the actual 103rd Meridian was approximately 2.2 miles to the east.  It was much easier to leave the mistake as it was than for Texas to cede land to New Mexico to correct the original surveying error.  The placement of the Oklahoma/New Mexico border represents the true 103rd Meridian.
Cimarron County in Oklahoma's panhandle is the only county in the United States that touches four other states: New Mexico, Texas, Colorado and Kansas (about two miles worth).

===Topography===

Oklahoma is between the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau in the Gulf of Mexico watershed,[tpl]cite web | date=April 17, 2003 | publisher=USGS | accessdate=July 31, 2007 | url=http://tapestry.usgs.gov/physiogr/physio.html | title=A Tapestry of Time and Terrain[/tpl] generally sloping from the high plains of its western boundary to the low wetlands of its southeastern boundary.[tpl]cite web | date=July 31, 2007 | publisher=Netstate | accessdate=July 31, 2007 | url=http://www.netstate.com/states/geography/ok_geography.htm| title=The Geography of Oklahoma[/tpl][tpl]cite web | year=2006 | publisher=geology.com | accessdate=August 1, 2007 | url=http://geology.com/state-map/oklahoma.shtml | title=Oklahoma State Map Collection[/tpl] Its highest and lowest points follow this trend, with its highest peak, Black Mesa, at 4,973 feet (1,516 m) above sea level, situated near its far northwest corner in the Oklahoma Panhandle. The state's lowest point is on the Little River near its far southeastern boundary near the town of Idabel, OK, which dips to 289 feet (88 m) above sea level.[tpl]cite web | date=January 1, 2003 | first=Derek |last=Arndt| publisher=Oklahoma Climatological Survey| accessdate=July 31, 2007 | url=http://cig.mesonet.org/climateatlas/doc60.html | title=The Climate of Oklahoma[/tpl]
Among the most geographically diverse states, Oklahoma is one of four to harbor more than 10 distinct ecological regions, with 11 in its borders – more per square mile than in any other state.[tpl]cite web | date=January 12, 2006 | url=http://www.travelok.com/atv/index.asp | title= Oklahoma, All Terrain Vacation | work=TravelOK | publisher=TravelOK.com | accessdate=July 15, 2006 [/tpl] Its western and eastern halves, however, are marked by extreme differences in geographical diversity: Eastern Oklahoma touches eight ecological regions and its western half contains three.
Oklahoma has four primary mountain ranges: the Ouachita Mountains, the Arbuckle Mountains, the Wichita Mountains, and the Ozark Mountains. Contained within the U.S. Interior Highlands region, the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains mark the only major mountainous region between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians.[tpl]cite web | date=March 7, 2007 | url=http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/4159/about/HotSpringsOffice.htm | title=Managing Upland Forests of the Midsouth | publisher=USD Forest Service| accessdate=July 31, 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] A portion of the Flint Hills stretches into north-central Oklahoma, and near the state's eastern border, Cavanal Hill is regarded by the Oklahoma Tourism & Recreation Department as the world's tallest hill; at 1,999 feet (609 m), it fails their definition of a mountain by one foot.[tpl]cite web |year=2007| url=http://www.travelok.com/about/index.asp | title=About Oklahoma | publisher=TravelOK.com | accessdate=July 10, 2006 [/tpl]
The semi-arid high plains in the state's northwestern corner harbor few natural
forests; the region has a rolling to flat landscape with intermittent canyons and mesa ranges like the Glass Mountains. Partial plains interrupted by small mountain ranges like the Antelope Hills and the Wichita Mountains dot southwestern Oklahoma, and transitional prairie and woodlands cover the central portion of the state. The Ozark and Ouachita Mountains rise from west to east over the state's eastern third, gradually increasing in elevation in an eastward direction.
More than 500 named creeks and rivers make up Oklahoma's waterways, and with 200 lakes created by dams, it holds the highest number of artificial reservoirs in the nation. Most of the state lies in two primary drainage basins belonging to the Red and Arkansas rivers, though the Lee and Little rivers also contain significant drainage basins.

===Flora and fauna===

Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass prairie, harbor expansive ecosystems in the state's central and western portions, although cropland has largely replaced native grasses. Where rainfall is sparse in the western regions of the state, shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems, though pinyon pines, red cedar (junipers), and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in the far western reaches of the panhandle.
Marshlands, cypress forests and mixtures of shortleaf pine, loblolly pine and deciduous forests dominate the state's southeastern quarter, while mixtures of largely post oak, elm, red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) and pine forests cover northeastern Oklahoma.[tpl]cite web | year=2003|url=http://www.odl.state.ok.us/almanac/2005/3-inbrief.pdf| title=Oklahoma in Brief | publisher=State of Oklahoma | format=PDF|accessdate=August 4, 2007 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ok.gov/~okag/forestry-okforestshome.htm| title=Oklahoma Ecoregional Maps | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Agriculture | accessdate=August 2, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070816235959/http%3A//www.ok.gov/%7Eokag/forestry-okforestshome.htm |archivedate = August 16, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
The state holds populations of white-tailed deer, mule deer, antelope,  coyotes, mountain lions, bobcats, elk, and birds such as quail, doves, cardinals, bald eagles, red-tailed hawks, and pheasants] In prairie ecosystems, American bison, greater prairie chickens, badgers, and armadillo are common, and some of the nation's largest prairie dog towns inhabit shortgrass prairie in the state's panhandle. The Cross Timbers, a region transitioning from prairie to woodlands in Central Oklahoma, harbors 351 vertebrate species. The Ouachita Mountains are home to black bear, red fox, grey fox, and river otter populations, which coexist with a total of 328 vertebrate species in southeastern Oklahoma. Also, in southeastern Oklahoma lives the American Alligator.[tpl]cite web | year=2005|url=http://www.travelok.com/about/StudentGuide.pdf| title=A Look at Oklahoma: A Student's Guide | publisher=State of Oklahoma | format=PDF|accessdate=August 14, 2007[/tpl]

===Climate===

Oklahoma is located in a temperate region and experiences occasional extremes of temperature and precipitation typical of a continental climate. Most of the state lies in an area known as Tornado Alley characterized by frequent interaction between cold and warm air masses producing severe weather. An average 54 tornadoes strike the state per year—one of the highest rates in the world.[tpl]cite web | publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center | accessdate=October 24, 2006 | url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/severeweather/tornadoes.html | title=Tornado Climatology[/tpl]
Because of Oklahoma's position between zones of differing prevailing temperature and winds, weather patterns within the state can vary widely over relatively short distances and can change drastically in a short time.  As an example, on November 11, 1911, the temperature at Oklahoma City reached [tpl]convert|83|°F|°C|abbr=on[/tpl] in the afternoon (the record high for that date), then an incoming squall line resulted in a drop to [tpl]convert|17|°F|°C|abbr=on[/tpl] at midnight (the record low for that date); thus, both the record high and record low for November 11 were set on the same date.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mesonet.org/index.php/news/article/november_11_1911_a_palindrome_to_remember |title=News | November 11, 1911: A Palindrome to Remember |publisher=Mesonet |accessdate=February 6, 2013[/tpl] This type of phenomenon is also responsible for many of the tornadoes in the area, such as the 1912 Oklahoma tornado outbreak, when a warm front travelled along a stalled cold front, resulting in an average of about one tornado per hour over the course of a day.
The humid subtropical climate (Koppen Cfa) of the eastern part of Oklahoma is influenced heavily by southerly winds bringing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, but transitions progressively to a semi-arid zone (Koppen BSk) in the high plains of the Panhandle and other western areas from about Lawton westward, less frequently touched by southern moisture. Precipitation and temperatures decline from east to west accordingly, with areas in the southeast averaging an annual temperature of 62 °F (17 °C) and an annual rainfall of [tpl]convert|56|in|mm|-1[/tpl], while areas of the panhandle average 58 °F (14 °C), with an annual rainfall under [tpl]convert|17|in|mm|-1[/tpl].
All of the state frequently experiences temperatures above 100 °F (38 °C) or below 0 °F (−18 °C),[tpl]cite web | publisher=University of Oklahoma| accessdate=August 1, 2007 | url=http://climate.mesonet.org/county_climate/Products/oklahoma_climate_overview.pdf| title=Oklahoma's Climate: an Overview|format=PDF[/tpl] and snowfall ranges from an average of less than [tpl]convert|4|in|cm|0[/tpl] in the south to just over [tpl]convert|20|in|cm|0[/tpl] on the border of Colorado in the panhandle. The state is home to the Storm Prediction Center, the National Severe Storms Laboratory, and the Warning Decision Training Branch, all part of the National Weather Service and located in Norman.[tpl]cite web | first=Chris|last=Novy|publisher=NOAA | accessdate=August 1, 2007 | url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/misc/about.html| title=SPC and its Products[/tpl] Oklahoma's highest recorded temperature of [tpl]convert|120|F|C[/tpl] was recorded at Tipton on June 27, 1994 and the lowest recorded temperature of [tpl]convert|-31|F|C[/tpl] was recorded at Nowata on February 10, 2011.

==History==

Evidence exists that native peoples traveled through Oklahoma as early as the last ice age.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1980/2/80.02.07.x.html| first=Valerie|last=Palino|title= Early Man in North America: The Known to the Unknown| publisher=Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute | accessdate=August 1, 2007[/tpl] Ancestors of the Wichita and Caddo lived in what is now Oklahoma. The Panhandle culture peoples were precontact residents of the panhandle region. The westernmost center of the Mississippian culture was Spiro Mounds, in what is now Spiro, Oklahoma, which flourished between AD 850 and 1450.[tpl]cite web |year=2007| url=http://www.myspiro.com/spiroMounds.asp|title= The Historic Spiro Mounds| publisher=Spiro Area Chamber of Commerce | accessdate=August 1, 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070801115959/http%3A//www.myspiro.com/spiroMounds.asp |archivedate = August 1, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~oknowata/PreHIn.htm|title= Prehistory of Oklahoma| publisher=rootsweb| accessdate=August 1, 2007[/tpl] Spaniard Francisco Vásquez de Coronado traveled through the state in 1541,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ok.gov/osfdocs/stinfo2.html|title= Oklahoma's History| publisher=Government of Oklahoma| accessdate=August 1, 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070801115959/http%3A//www.ok.gov/osfdocs/stinfo2.html |archivedate = August 1, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] but French explorers claimed the area in the 1700s[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~oknowata/FrSPEX.htm|title= French and Spanish Explorations| publisher=rootsweb| accessdate=August 1, 2007[/tpl] and it remained under French rule until 1803, when all the French territory west of the Mississippi River was purchased by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase.
During the 19th century, thousands of Native Americans were expelled from their ancestral homelands from across North America and transported to the area including and surrounding present-day Oklahoma. The Choctaw was the first of the Five Civilized Tribes to be removed from the southeastern United States. The phrase "Trail of Tears" originated from a description of the removal of the Choctaw Nation in 1831, although the term is usually used for the Cherokee removal.
A total of 17,000 Cherokees and 2,000 of their black slaves were deported.Carter (III), Samuel (1976). Cherokee sunset: A nation betrayed: a narrative of travail and triumph, persecution and exile. New York: Doubleday, p. 232. The area, already occupied by Osage and Quapaw tribes, was called for the Choctaw Nation until revised Native American and then later American policy redefined the boundaries to include other Native Americans. By 1890, more than 30 Native American nations and tribes had been concentrated on land within Indian Territory or "Indian Country".
Many Native Americans served in the Union and Confederate military during the American Civil War. The Cherokee Nation had an internal civil war. Slavery in Indian Territory was not abolished until 1866.[tpl]cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bqIJ278VHuwC&pg=PA127&dq=Slaves+1866+Oklahoma&hl=en&ei=NNYATq_lFOTx0gH_nq2xDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Slaves%201866%20Oklahoma&f=false |title=Hornsby, A Companion to African-American History, p.127 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2008-04-15 |accessdate=2014-04-23[/tpl]
In the period between 1866 and 1899, cattle ranches in Texas strove to meet the demands for food in eastern cities and railroads in Kansas promised to deliver in a timely manner. Cattle trails and cattle ranches developed as cowboys either drove their product north or settled illegally in Indian Territory. In 1881, four of five major cattle trails on the western frontier traveled through Indian Territory.[tpl]cite web | url=http://genealogytrails.com/main/cattletrails1881map.html|title= Map of Cattle Drives in 1881| publisher=Genealogy Trails History Group| accessdate=August 1, 2007[/tpl]
Increased presence of white settlers in Indian Territory prompted the United States Government to establish the Dawes Act in 1887, which divided the lands of individual tribes into allotments for individual families, encouraging farming and private land ownership among Native Americans but expropriating land to the federal government. In the process, railroad companies took nearly half of Indian-held land within the territory for outside settlers and for purchase.[tpl]cite web | first=Robert|last=Hamilton|url=http://itech.fgcu.edu/&/issues/vol3/issue1/united.htm|title= United States and Native American Relations | publisher=Florida Gulf Coast University| accessdate=August 1, 2007[/tpl]
Major land runs, including the Land Run of 1889, were held for settlers where certain territories were opened to settlement starting at a precise time. Usually land was open to settlers on a first come first served basis.[tpl]cite web |year=1999|url=http://aaae.okstate.edu/proceedings/1999/Factors%20Influencing%20Enrollment.doc|title= Factors Influencing Enrollment in Agricultural Education Classes of Native American Students in Oklahoma | publisher=Oklahoma State University| format=DOC |accessdate=August 1, 2007[/tpl] Those who broke the rules by crossing the border into the territory before the official opening time were said to have been crossing the border sooner, leading to the term sooners, which eventually became the state's official nickname.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nationalcowboymuseum.org/research/r_virt_landrun5.html|title= Rushes to Statehood | publisher=National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum|accessdate=August 1, 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070801115959/http%3A//www.nationalcowboymuseum.org/research/r_virt_landrun5.html |archivedate = August 1, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
Deliberations to make the territory into a state began near the end of the 19th century, when the Curtis Act continued the allotment of Indian tribal land.

===20th century===

Attempts to create an all-Indian state named Oklahoma and a later attempt to create an all-Indian state named Sequoyah failed but the Sequoyah Statehood Convention of 1905 eventually laid the groundwork for the Oklahoma Statehood Convention, which took place two years later.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.willrogers.com/new/articles/exhibits/Sequoyah_Centennial/Sequoyah_exhibit.html|title= Clem Rogers | publisher=Will Rogers Museum Association| accessdate=August 1, 2007[/tpl] On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was established as the 46th state in the Union.
The new state became a focal point for the emerging oil industry, as discoveries of oil pools prompted towns to grow rapidly in population and wealth. Tulsa eventually became known as the "Oil Capital of the World" for most of the 20th century and oil investments fueled much of the state's early economy.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.tulsalibrary.org/tulsahistory/communities.htm#tul| title= Tulsa Area History |publisher=Tulsa County Library| accessdate=April 25, 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070108010448/http://www.tulsalibrary.org/tulsahistory/communities.htm| archivedate = January 8, 2007[/tpl] In 1927, an Oklahoman businessman Cyrus Avery, known as the "Father of Route 66", began the campaign to create U.S. Route 66. Using a stretch of highway from Amarillo, Texas to Tulsa, Oklahoma to form the original portion of Highway 66, Avery spearheaded the creation of the U.S. Highway 66 Association to oversee the planning of Route 66, based in his hometown of Tulsa.[tpl]cite web | url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG02/carney/avery.html | title=The Father of Route 66 | publisher=University of Virginia | accessdate=April 20, 2007[/tpl]
Oklahoma also has a rich African American history. There were many black towns that thrived in the early 20th century because of black settlers moving from neighboring states, especially Kansas. The politician Edward P. McCabe encouraged black settlers to come to what was then Indian Territory. He discussed with President Theodore Roosevelt the possibility of making Oklahoma a majority-black state.

Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, $1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ok-history.mus.ok.us/trrc/file1.pdf| title= Tulsa Race Riot, A Report by the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921, February 28, 2001 |publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society | accessdate=June 10, 2008|format=PDF|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080624204404/http://www.ok-history.mus.ok.us/trrc/file1.pdf |archivedate = June 24, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.[tpl]cite web | first=Larry|last=O'Dell|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/K/KU001.html| title= Ku klux klan |publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society | accessdate=June 26, 2008[/tpl]
During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practices, extended drought and high winds. Known as the Dust Bowl, areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States.[tpl]cite web | date=August 5, 2005|url=http://www.ccccok.org/museum/dustbowl.html|title= 1930s Dust Bowl | publisher=Cimarron County Chamber of Commerce| accessdate=August 1, 2007[/tpl] Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl.
Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.[tpl]cite web | year=2007|url=http://www.history.com/states.do?action=detail&state=OK&contentType=State_Generic&contentId=54146|title= History of the States: Oklahoma, The Sooner State | publisher=The History Channel| accessdate=August 9, 2007[/tpl]
In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols detonated an explosive outside of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children.

His wife, Lori Fortier, who has since died, was granted immunity from prosecution in return for her testimony in the case.

===State government===

The Legislature of Oklahoma consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives. As the lawmaking branch of the state government, it is responsible for raising and distributing the money necessary to run the government. The Senate has 48 members serving four-year terms, while the House has 101 members with two-year terms. The state has a term limit for its legislature that restricts any one person to a total of twelve cumulative years service between both legislative branches.[tpl]cite web | publisher=U.S. Term Limits| accessdate=August 9, 2007 | url=http://www.ustl.org/leglong.html| title=Legislative Longevity Limits[/tpl]
Oklahoma's judicial branch consists of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, and 77 District Courts that each serves one county. The Oklahoma judiciary also contains two independent courts: a Court of Impeachment and the Oklahoma Court on the Judiciary. Oklahoma has two courts of last resort: the state Supreme Court hears civil cases, and the state Court of Criminal Appeals hears criminal cases (this split system exists only in Oklahoma and neighboring Texas). Judges of those two courts, as well as the Court of Civil Appeals are appointed by the Governor upon the recommendation of the state Judicial Nominating Commission, and are subject to a non-partisan retention vote on a six-year rotating schedule.[tpl]cite web | date=June 7, 2007 | publisher=Netstate| accessdate=August 1, 2007 | url=http://www.netstate.com/states/government/ok_government.htm| title=Oklahoma State Government[/tpl]

Thirty-nine Native American tribal governments are based in Oklahoma, each holding limited powers within designated areas. While Indian reservations typical in most of the United States are not present in Oklahoma, tribal governments hold land granted during the Indian Territory era, but with limited jurisdiction and no control over state governing bodies such as municipalities and counties. Tribal governments are recognized by the United States as quasi-sovereign entities with executive, judicial, and legislative powers over tribal members and functions, but are subject to the authority of the United States Congress to revoke or withhold certain powers. The tribal governments are required to submit a constitution and any subsequent amendments to the United States Congress for approval.[tpl]cite news |first=Robert|last=Henry| url=http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=61934| date=March 22, 1989|title= Oklahoma Attorney General's Opinions: Question Submitted by: The Honorable Enoch Kelly Haney, Oklahoma State Senate| publisher=The Oklahoma State Courts Network | accessdate=August 21, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|first=Lindsay|last=Robertson|url=http://thorpe.ou.edu/guide/robertson.html| year=2001|title= Native Americans and the Law: Native Americans Under Current United States Law| publisher=University of Oklahoma| accessdate=August 21, 2007[/tpl]

===National politics===

Oklahoma has been politically conservative for much of its history, especially recently. During the first half century of statehood, it was considered a Democratic stronghold, being carried by the Republican Party in only two presidential elections (1920 and 1928). During this time, it was also carried by every winning Democratic candidate up to Harry Truman. However, Oklahoma Democrats were generally considered to be more conservative than Democrats in other states.
After the 1948 election, the state turned firmly Republican. Although registered Republicans are a minority in the state,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ok.gov/elections/documents/reg_0111.pdf | title=Registration by Party as of January 15, 2011 | format=PDF | publisher=Oklahoma State Election Board| accessdate=February 17, 2011[/tpl] starting in 1952, Oklahoma has been carried by Republican presidential candidates in all but one election (1964). This is not to say that every election has been a landslide for Republicans: Jimmy Carter lost the state by less than 1.5% in 1976, while Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton both won 40% or more of the state's popular vote in 1988 and 1996 respectively. Al Gore in 2000, though, was the last Democrat to even win any counties in the state. Oklahoma was the only state where Barack Obama failed to carry any of its counties in both 2008 and 2012.
Generally, Republicans are strongest in Oklahoma City, Tulsa and their close-in suburbs, as well as the Panhandle. Democrats are strongest in the eastern part of the state and Little Dixie.
Following the 2000 census, the Oklahoma delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives was reduced from six to five representatives, each serving one congressional district. For the 112th Congress (2011–2013), there were no changes in party strength, and the delegation included four Republicans and one Democrat. In the 112th Congress, Oklahoma's U.S. senators were Republicans Jim Inhofe and Tom Coburn, and its U.S. Representatives were John Sullivan (R-OK-1), Dan Boren (D-OK-2), Frank D. Lucas (R-OK-3), Tom Cole (R-OK-4), and James Lankford (R-OK-5).
In 2012, Dan Boren (D-OK-2) retired from Congress, therefore making the seat vacant. This district, which covers most of the 'Little Dixie', is the Democrats best region of the state, and has been represented by a Democrat for almost 15 years. Republican Markwayne Mullin won the election making the states' congressional delegation all Republican.

Under Oklahoma law, municipalities are divided into two categories: cities, defined as having more than 1,000 residents, and towns, with under 1,000 residents. Both have legislative, judicial, and public power within their boundaries, but cities can choose between a mayor-council, council-manager, or strong mayor form of government, while towns operate through an elected officer system.[tpl]cite web |year=2005| url= http://www.odl.state.ok.us/almanac/2005/12-muni.pdf | title=Oklahoma Municipal Government | publisher=Oklahoma Department of Libraries | format=PDF| accessdate=August 7, 2007[/tpl]

State law codifies Oklahoma's state emblems and honorary positions;[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/index.asp?ftdb=STOKST&level=1 | title=OCIS Document Index | publisher=The Oklahoma Supreme Court Network | accessdate=May 11, 2007 [/tpl] the Oklahoma Senate or House of Representatives may adopt resolutions designating others for special events and to benefit organizations. Currently the State Senate is waiting to vote on a change to the state's motto. The House passed HCR 1024, which will change the State motto from "Labor Omnia Vincit" to "Oklahoma-In God We Trust!" The author of the resolution stated that a constituent researched the Oklahoma Constitution and found no "official" vote regarding "Labor Omnia Vincit", therefore opening the door for an entirely new motto.
