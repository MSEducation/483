The Kingdom includes two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. At [tpl]convert|43,094|km2|sqmi|lk=in|sigfig=7[/tpl],Denmark Area – Geography – Index Mundi. Retrieved 5 June 2012. with a population of around 5.6 million inhabitants, Denmark consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and the Danish archipelago of 407 islands,[tpl]cite web|title=Denmark in numbers 2010|url=http://www.dst.dk/pukora/epub/upload/14847/dkital.pdf|publisher=Statistics Denmark|accessdate=2 May 2013[/tpl] of which around 70 are inhabited. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. The national language, Danish, is closely related to and mutually intelligible with Swedish and Norwegian.
The Kingdom of Denmark is a unitary constitutional monarchy, with Margrethe II as queen regnant, organised as a parliamentary democracy. The Constitution of Denmark was signed on 5 June 1849, ending the absolute monarchy which had begun in 1660. The Constitution has been revised four times, most recently in 1953. The seat of government is in the capital of Copenhagen. Denmark[tpl]efn|name="proper"[/tpl] exercises hegemonic influence in the Danish Realm, devolving political powers to handle internal affairs. Denmark became a member of the European Union in 1973, maintaining four opt-outs from European Union policies, as outlined in the 1992 Edinburgh Agreement. Both the Faroe Islands and Greenland remain outside the Union.
The unified kingdom of Denmark emerged in the 8th century as a proficient seafaring nation in the struggle for control of the Baltic Sea. Denmark was part of the Kalmar Union, established in 1397, ended with Swedish secession in 1523. The following year, Denmark entered into a union with Norway, which lasted nearly three centuries until its dissolution in 1814. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several cessions of Danish territory; these culminated in the 1830s with a surge of nationalist movements, which were defeated in the 1864 Second Schleswig War. Denmark remained neutral during World War I. In April 1940, Denmark was invaded by Germany with brief, military skirmishes while the Danish resistance movement was active from 1943 until the German surrender in May 1945. Denmark joined NATO in 1949, relinquishing its historically neutral stance. An industrialized exporter of agricultural produce in the second half of the 19th century, Denmark introduced social and labour-market reforms in the early decades of the 20th century, making the basis for the present welfare state with a highly developed mixed market economy. The Danish krone has been pegged to the euro since 1 January 1999.

==Etymology==

The etymology of the word Denmark, and especially the relationship between Danes and Denmark and the unifying of Denmark as a single kingdom, is a subject which attracts debate.Kristian Andersen Nyrup, Middelalderstudier Bog IX. Kong Gorms SagaIndvandrerne i Danmarks historie, Bent Østergaard, Syddansk Universitetsforlag 2007, ISBN 978-87-7674-204-1, pp. 19–24 This is centred primarily on the prefix "Dan" and whether it refers to the Dani or a historical person Dan and the exact meaning of the -"mark" ending. The issue is further complicated by a number of references to various Dani people in Scandinavia or other places in Europe in Greek and Roman accounts (like Ptolemy, Jordanes, and Gregory of Tours), as well as mediaeval literature (like Adam of Bremen, Beowulf, Widsith, and Poetic Edda).
Most handbooks deriveJ. de Vries, Altnordisches etymologisches Wörterbuch, 1962, 73; N. Å. Nielsen, Dansk etymologisk ordbog, 1989, 85–96. the first part of the word, and the name of the people, from a word meaning "flat land", related to German Tenne "threshing floor", English den "cave", Sanskrit dhánuṣ- (धनुस्; "desert"). The -mark is believed to mean woodland or borderland (see marches), with probable references to the border forests in south Schleswig.Navneforskning, Københavns Universitet [tpl]Wayback |date=20060716144406 |url=http://navneforskning.ku.dk/stednavne.doc/betydninger.doc |title=Udvalgte stednavnes betydning [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]
The first recorded use of the word Danmark within Denmark itself is found on the two Jelling stones, which are runestones believed to have been erected by Gorm the Old (c. 955) and Harald Bluetooth (c. 965). The larger stone of the two is popularly cited as Denmark's baptismal certificate (dåbsattest),[tpl]cite book |last=O'Donoghue |first=Heather |authorlink= |title=Old Norse-Icelandic Literature: A Short Introduction |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lY-g2MTFh9gC&pg=PT27 |accessdate=2014-02-27 |year=2008 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location= |isbn=9780470776834 |page=27[/tpl] though both use the word "Denmark", in the form of accusative [tpl]runic|ᛏᛅᚾᛘᛅᚢᚱᚴ[/tpl] "tanmaurk" ([tpl]IPA|danmɒrk[/tpl]) on the large stone, and genitive [tpl]runic|ᛏᛅᚾᛘᛅᚱᚴᛅᚱ[/tpl] "tanmarkar" (pronounced [tpl]IPA|danmarkaɽ[/tpl]) on the small stone.The dative form tąnmarku (pronounced [tpl]IPA|danmarkʊ[/tpl]) is found on the contemporaneous Skivum stone. The inhabitants of Denmark are there called "tani" ([tpl]IPA|danɪ[/tpl]), or "Danes", in the accusative.

==History==

===Prehistory===

The earliest archaeological findings in Denmark date back to the Eem interglacial period from 130,000–110,000 BC.Michaelsen (2002), p. 19. Denmark has been inhabited since around 12,500 BC and agriculture has been evident since 3900 BC.[tpl]cite web|last=Nielsen|first=Poul Otto|date=May 2003|url=http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap6/6-1.asp|title=Denmark: History, Prehistory|publisher=Royal Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=1 May 2006 |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20051122020555/http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap6/6-1.asp |archivedate=22 November 2005[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] The Nordic Bronze Age (1800–600 BC) in Denmark was marked by burial mounds, which left an abundance of findings including lurs and the Sun Chariot.
During the Pre-Roman Iron Age (500 BC – AD 1), native groups began migrating south, although the first Danish people came to the country between the Pre-Roman and the Germanic Iron Age,Busck and Poulsen (ed.) (2002), p. 20. in the Roman Iron Age (AD 1–400). The Roman provinces maintained trade routes and relations with native tribes in Denmark, and Roman coins have been found in Denmark. Evidence of strong Celtic cultural influence dates from this period in Denmark and much of North-West Europe and is among other things reflected in the finding of the Gundestrup cauldron.
Historians believe that before the arrival of the precursors to the Danes, who came from the east Danish islands (Zealand) and Skåne and spoke an early form of North Germanic, most of Jutland and the nearest islands were settled by Jutes. They were later invited to Great Britain as mercenaries by Brythonic King Vortigern and were granted the south-eastern territories of Kent, the Isle of Wight among other areas, where they settled. They were later absorbed or ethnically cleansed by the invading Angles and Saxons, who formed the Anglo-Saxons. The remaining population in Jutland assimilated in with the Danes.
A short note about the Dani in "Getica" by the historian Jordanes is believed by some[tpl]Who|date=June 2012[/tpl] to be an early mention of the Danes, one of the ethnic groups from whom modern Danes are descended.[tpl]cite web|author=Jordanes|coauthors=translated by Charles C. Mierow|date=22 April 1997|url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/jordgeti.html#III |title=The Origin and Deeds of the Goths, chapter III|accessdate=1 May 2006[/tpl]Busck and Poulsen (ed.) (2002), p. 19. The Danevirke defence structures were built in phases from the 3rd century forward and the sheer size of the construction efforts in AD 737 are attributed to the emergence of a Danish king.Michaelsen (2002), pp. 122–23. A new runic alphabet was first used around the same time and Ribe, the oldest town of Denmark, was founded about AD 700.

===Viking and Middle Ages===

From the 8th to the 10th century, the Danes, Norwegians and Swedes, were known as Vikings. They colonized, raided, and traded in all parts of Europe. Viking explorers first discovered Iceland by accident in the 9th century, on the way towards the Faroe Islands and eventually came across "Vinland" (Land of wine), also known today as Newfoundland, a province in Canada. The Danish Vikings were most active in the British Isles and Western Europe. They conquered and settled parts of England (known as the Danelaw) under King Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013, Ireland, and France where they founded Normandy. More Anglo-Saxon pence of this period have been found in Denmark than in England.[ref]*[tpl]cite web| last =Lund| first =Niels| date =May 2003| url =http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap6/6-2.asp| archiveurl =//web.archive.org/web/20060510174200/http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap6/6-2.asp| archivedate =10 May 2006| title =Denmark – History – The Viking Age| work =Denmark| publisher =Royal Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs| accessdate =24 June 2012 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]
As attested by the Jelling stones, the Danes were united and Christianised about 965 by Harald Bluetooth. It is believed that Denmark became Christian for political reasons so as not to get invaded by the rising Christian power in Europe, Germania, which was an important trading area for the Danes. In that case Harald built six fortresses around Denmark called Trelleborg and built a further Danevirke. In the early 11th century, Canute the Great won and united Denmark, England, and Norway for almost 30 years.
Throughout the High and Late Middle Ages, Denmark also included Skåneland (Skåne, Halland, and Blekinge) and Danish kings ruled Danish Estonia, as well as the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. Most of the latter two now form the state of Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany.
In 1397, Denmark entered into a personal union with Norway and Sweden, united under Queen Margaret I. The three countries were to be treated as equals in the union. However, even from the start Margaret may not have been so idealistic—treating Denmark as the clear "senior" partner of the union.Lauring, Palle (1960) A History of the Kingdom of Denmark, Host & Son Co.: Copenhagen, p. 108. Thus, much of the next 125 years of Scandinavian history revolves around this union, with Sweden breaking off and rejoining repeatedly. The issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 June 1523, as Swedish King Gustav Vasa conquered the city of Stockholm.
The Protestant Reformation came to Scandinavia in the 1530s, and following the Count's Feud civil war, Denmark converted to Lutheranism in 1536. Later that year, Denmark entered into a union with Norway.

===Early modern history (1536–1849)===

After Sweden permanently broke away from the Kalmar Union in 1523, Denmark tried on two occasions to reassert control over Sweden. The first was in the Northern Seven Years' War which lasted from 1563 until 1570. The second occasion was the Kalmar War when King Christian IV attacked Sweden in 1611 but failed to accomplish his main objective of forcing Sweden to return to the union with Denmark. The war led to no territorial changes, but Sweden was forced to pay a war indemnity of 1 million silver riksdaler to Denmark, an amount known as the Älvsborg ransom.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smb.nu/svenskakrig/1611.asp|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20071011111014/http://smb.nu/svenskakrig/1611.asp|archivedate=11 October 2007 |title=Kalmarkriget 1611–1613 |accessdate=4 May 2007 |publisher=Svenskt Militärhistoriskt Bibliotek[/tpl]
King Christian used this money to found several towns and fortresses, most notably Glückstadt (founded as a rival to Hamburg), Christiania (following a fire destroying the original city of Oslo), Christianshavn, Christianstad, and Christiansand. Christian also constructed a number of buildings, most notably Børsen, Rundetårn, Nyboder, Rosenborg, a silver mine, and a copper mill. Inspired by the Dutch East India Company, he founded a similar Danish company and planned to claim Ceylon as a colony, but the company only managed to acquire Tranquebar on India's Coromandel Coast. Denmark's large colonial aspirations were limited to a few key trading posts in Africa and India.
In the Thirty Years' War, Christian tried to become the leader of the Lutheran states in Germany but suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Lutter.Parker, pp. 69–70. The result was that the Catholic army under Albrecht von Wallenstein was able to invade, occupy, and pillage Jutland, forcing Denmark to withdraw from the war.Parker, p. 70. Denmark managed to avoid territorial concessions, but Gustavus Adolphus' intervention in Germany was seen as a sign that the military power of Sweden was on the rise while Denmark's influence in the region was declining. Swedish armies invaded Jutland in 1643 and claimed Skåne in 1644. According to Geoffrey Parker, "The Swedish occupation caused a drop in agricultural production and a shortage of capital; harvest failure and plague ravaged the land between 1647 and 1651; Denmark's population fell by 20 per cent."Geoffrey Parker (2001). Europe in crisis, 1598–1648. Wiley-Blackwell. p.205. ISBN 0-631-22028-3
In the 1645 Treaty of Brømsebro, Denmark surrendered Halland, Gotland, the last parts of Danish Estonia, and several provinces in Norway. In 1657, King Frederick III declared war on Sweden and marched on Bremen-Verden. This led to a massive Danish defeat and the armies of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden conquered both Jutland, Funen, and much of Zealand before signing the Peace of Roskilde in February 1658 which gave Sweden control of Skåne, Blekinge, Trøndelag, and the island of Bornholm. Charles X Gustav quickly regretted not having destroyed Denmark completely and in August 1658 he began a two-year long siege of Copenhagen but failed to take the capital. In the following peace settlement, Denmark managed to maintain its independence and regain control of Trøndelag and Bornholm.
Denmark tried to regain control of Skåne in the Scanian War (1675–79) but this attempt was a failure. Following the Great Northern War (1700–21), Denmark managed to restore control of the parts of Schleswig and Holstein ruled by the house of Holstein-Gottorp in 1721 and 1773, respectively. In the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark originally tried to pursue a policy of neutrality and trade with both France and the United Kingdom and joined the League of Armed Neutrality with Russia, Sweden, and Prussia. The British considered this a hostile act and attacked Copenhagen in both 1801 and 1807, in one case carrying off the Danish fleet, in the other, burning large parts of Copenhagen.
This led to the so-called Danish-British Gunboat War. The British control of the waterways between Denmark and Norway proved disastrous to the union's economy and in 1813, Denmark-Norway went bankrupt. The Danish-Norwegian union was dissolved by the Treaty of Kiel in 1814. Norway entered a new union with Sweden which lasted until 1905. Denmark kept the colonies of Iceland, Faroe Islands, and Greenland. Apart from the Nordic colonies, Denmark ruled over Danish India (Tranquebar in India) from 1620 to 1869, the Danish Gold Coast (Ghana) from 1658 to 1850, and the Danish West Indies (the U.S. Virgin Islands) from 1671 to 1917.

===Constitutional monarchy (1849–present)===

A nascent Danish liberal and national movement gained momentum in the 1830s; after the European Revolutions of 1848, Denmark peacefully became a constitutional monarchy on 5 June 1849. A two-chamber parliament was established. After the Second War of Schleswig in 1864, Denmark was forced to cede Schleswig and Holstein to Prussia, in a defeat that left deep marks on the Danish national identity.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] After these events, Denmark pursued a policy of neutrality in Europe.
Denmark remained neutral during World War I. After the defeat of Germany, the Versailles powers offered to return the region of Schleswig-Holstein to Denmark. Fearing German irredentism, Denmark refused to consider the return of the area without a plebiscite. The two Schleswig Plebiscites took place on 10 February and 14 March 1920, respectively. On 10 July 1920, Northern Schleswig (Sønderjylland) was recovered by Denmark, thereby adding some 163,600 inhabitants and [tpl]convert|3984|km2|sqmi[/tpl]. The reunion day (Genforeningsdag) is celebrated every 15 June on Valdemarsdag.
Denmark signed a 10-year non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany in 1939. Germany's invasion of Denmark on 9 April 1940 – code-named Operation Weserübung – met only two hours of military resistance before the Danish government surrendered. Economic co-operation between Germany and Denmark continued until 1943, when the Danish government refused further co-operation and its navy scuttled most of its ships and sent as many of their officers as they could to Sweden.
During the war, the government was helpful towards the Danish Jewish minority and the Danish resistance performed a daring rescue operation that managed to get most of them to Sweden and safety shortly before the Germans planned to round up the Danish Jews. Danish doctors refused to treat German citizens fleeing from Germany, which resulted in the deaths of 13,000 people.Manfred Ertel. A Legacy of Dead German Children Spiegel Online, 16 May 2005[tpl]cite web|last=Lindbjerg|first=Søren|title=IMDB – Kun en tysker|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0351197/|accessdate=30 January 2013[/tpl] Danish citizens volunteered to fight Russia in co-operation with Germany as part of Frikorps Danmark.[tpl]cite web|last=Rugg|first=Andy|title=Traitor Danes: most soldiers return heroes, but this lot came home total zeroes|url=http://cphpost.dk/culture/through-looking-glass/traitor-danes-most-soldiers-return-heroes-lot-came-home-total-zeroes|work=Cophenagen Post|accessdate=30 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] Iceland severed ties to Denmark and became an independent republic in 1944; in 1948, the Faroe Islands gained home rule.

====Post-war (1945–present)====

After World War II, Denmark became one of the founding members of the European Free Trade Association, NATO, and the United Nations. During the 1960s, the EFTA countries were often referred to as the Outer Seven, as opposed to the Inner Six of what was then the European Economic Community (EEC).[tpl]cite news |title=Finland: Now, the Seven and a Half |work=TIME |date=7 April 1961 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874317,00.htm |accessdate=18 July 2009 [/tpl]
In 1973, along with Britain and Ireland, Denmark joined the European Economic Community after a public referendum. The Maastricht Treaty, which involved further European integration, was rejected by the Danish people in 1992; it was only accepted after a second referendum in 1993 and the addition of certain opt-out provisions for Denmark. The Danes rejected the euro as the national currency in a referendum in 2000. Greenland gained home rule in 1979 and was awarded self-determination in 2009. Neither Greenland nor the Faroe Islands are members of the European Union, the Faroese having declined membership of the EEC in 1973 and Greenland in 1986, in both cases because of fisheries policies.
Constitutional change in 1953 led to a single-chamber parliament elected by proportional representation, female accession to the Danish throne, and Greenland becoming an integral part of Denmark. The Social Democrats led a string of coalition governments for most of the second half of the 20th century in a country generally known for its liberal traditions. Poul Schlüter then became the first Danish prime minister from the Conservative People's Party in 1982, leading a centre-right coalition until 1993, when he was succeeded by the Social Democrat Poul Nyrup Rasmussen.
A centre-right coalition, headed by Anders Fogh Rasmussen, came to power in 2001 promising tighter immigration controls. A third successive centre-right leader, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, was prime minister from 2009 to 2011 due to Anders Fogh Rasmussen resigning as Prime Minister of Denmark to become the Secretary General of NATO. The Rasmussen governments were dependent on the right-wing populist Danish People's Party throughout the 2000s to push through legislation, during which time immigration and integration emerged as major issues of public debate. Helle Thorning-Schmidt from the Social Democrats became Denmark's first female prime minister in 2011, ending a decade of centre-right rule.
Despite its modest size, Denmark has participated in generally UN-sanctioned, and often NATO-led, military and humanitarian operations, including: Cyprus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Korea, Egypt, Croatia, Kosovo, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and Libya.

==Geography of Denmark==

Located in Northern Europe, Denmark consists of the peninsula of Jutland and 443 named islands (1,419 islands above [tpl]convert|100|m2|sqft[/tpl] in total).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.kms.dk/C1256AED004EA666/(AllDocsByDocId)/1D7EE8822587E667C1256AEF0030ABF6?open&page=strste&omr=KORT_DK_I_TAL |title=Landet i tal  – Største øer |accessdate=14 July 2007 |date=23 September 2003 |publisher=National Survey and Cadastre of Denmark[/tpl] Of these, 72 are inhabited,Statistikbanken.dk/bef4 with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The island of Bornholm is located east of the rest of the country, in the Baltic Sea. Many of the larger islands are connected by bridges; the Øresund Bridge connects Zealand with Sweden; the Great Belt Bridge connects Funen with Zealand; and the Little Belt Bridge connects Jutland with Funen. Ferries or small aircraft connect to the smaller islands. The largest cities with populations over 100,000 are the capital Copenhagen on Zealand; Aarhus and Aalborg in Jutland; and Odense on Funen.

Phytogeographically, the Kingdom of Denmark (including Greenland and the Faroe Islands) belongs to the Boreal Kingdom and is shared between the Arctic, Atlantic European, and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the territory of metropolitan Denmark can be subdivided into two ecoregions: the Atlantic mixed forests and Baltic mixed forests. The Faroe Islands are covered by the Faroe Islands boreal grasslands, while Greenland hosts the ecoregions of Kalaallit Nunaat high arctic tundra and Kalaallit Nunaat low arctic tundra.

There are short days during the winter with sunrise coming around 8:45 am and sunset 3:45 pm (standard time), as well as long summer days with sunrise at 4:30 am and sunset at 10 pm (daylight saving time).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/kobenhavn.html|title=Copenhagen, Denmark  – Sunrise, sunset, dawn and dusk times for the whole year|work=Gaisma|accessdate=24 June 2012[/tpl]

===Environment===

Denmark has historically taken a progressive stance on environmental preservation; in 1971 Denmark established a Ministry of Environment and was the first country in the world to implement an environmental law in 1973.The law of environmental damage: liability and reparation. Marie-Louise Larsson. To mitigate environmental degradation and global warming the Danish Government has signed the following international agreements: Antarctic Treaty; Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol etc.

Copenhagen's most important environment research institutions are the University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen Business School,[tpl]cite web |title=The win-win ways of Cleantech business |work=CBS Observer |date=26 March 2009 |url=http://cbsobserver.dk/win-win-ways-cleantech-business |accessdate=24 July 2009[/tpl] Risø DTU National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy and the Technical University of Denmark, which Risø is now part of. Leading up to the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference (Copenhagen Summit), the University of Copenhagen held the Climate Change: Global Risks, Challenges and Decisions conference where the need for comprehensive action to mitigate climate change was stressed by the international scientific community. Notable figures such as Rajendra K. Pachauri, Chairman of the IPCC, Professor Nicholas Stern, author of the Stern Report, and Professor Daniel Kammen all emphasised the good example set by Copenhagen and Denmark in capitalising on cleantech and achieving economic growth while stabilising carbon emissions.

==Governance==

The Kingdom of Denmark is a constitutional monarchy, in which Queen Margrethe II is head of state, but royal power has long been limited to ceremonial functions.The Monarchy today – The Danish Monarchy (kongehuset.dk). Access date: 16 June 2012 The monarch is not answerable for his or her actions, and the monarch's person is sacrosanct."The King shall not be answerable for his actions; his person shall be sacrosanct." The Constitution of Denmark – Section 13.
The Danish political system operates under a framework laid out in the Constitution of Denmark. Changes to it require an absolute majority in two consecutive parliamentary terms and majority approval through a referendum (and the referendum majority must constitute at least 40 per cent of the electorate).[tpl]cite web|author=Tschentscher, Axel  |url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/da00000_.html |title=The Constitution of Denmark – Section 88 |publisher=Servat.unibe.ch |accessdate=5 July 2012[/tpl]  The Constitution lays out a political system based on the separation of powers into the three branches of government; the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary branches.

===Political system===

The Folketing is the national Parliament, the supreme legislative body of the kingdom. In theory it has the ultimate legislative authority according to the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, it is able to legislate on any matter and not bound by decisions of its predecessors. However questions over sovereignty have been brought forward because of Denmark's entry into the European Union.  Parliament consists of 175 members elected by proportional majority, plus two members each from Greenland and the Faroe Islands.[tpl]harvnb|Jørgensen|1995|p=16.[/tpl] Parliamentary elections are held at least every four years, but it is within the powers of the Prime Minister to ask the monarch to call for an election before the term has elapsed. On a vote of no confidence, the Parliament may force a single Minister or the entire government to resign."A Minister shall not remain in office after the Parliament has passed a vote of no confidence in him." The Constitution of Denmark – Section 15.
The Danish political system has traditionally generated coalitions. Most Danish post-war governments have been minority coalitions ruling with the support of non-government parties.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.b.dk/din-mening/radikale-ved-historisk-skillevej|title=Radikale ved historisk skillevej|work=Berlingske Tidende|date=17 June 2007|accessdate=17 August 2007[/tpl]
The Prime Minister is formally appointed by the monarch, on the advice of party leaders following an election or collapse of a government. In practice the Prime Minister is chosen through negotiation between the parliament party leaders, customarily with the leader of the largest party in a coalition being appointed. Executive authority is exercised on behalf of the monarch by the Prime Minister and other cabinet ministers who head departments. The Cabinet, Prime Minister and other Ministers collectively make up the government of Denmark.
Lars Løkke Rasmussen was the Prime minister from April 2009 until September 2011. He headed a right-wing government coalition consisting of Venstre (a conservative liberal party) and the Conservative People's Party, with parliamentary support from the national-conservative Danish People's Party. Following the September 2011 election the right wing lost to the opposing left-wing coalition, led by Helle Thorning-Schmidt, who on 3 October 2011 formed a new government consisting of the Social Democrats, the Danish Social Liberal Party and the Socialist People's Party.

===Judicial system===

Judicial authority remains separate from the executive and legislature and lies with the courts of justice. The Kingdom of Denmark does not have a single unified judicial system – Denmark proper has one system, Greenland another, and the Faroe Islands a third.[tpl]harvnb|Gammelgaard|Sørensen|1998|p=18.[/tpl] However, decisions by the highest courts in Greenland and the Faroe Islands may be appealed to the Danish High Courts. The Danish Supreme Court is the highest civil and criminal court responsible for the administration of justice in the kingdom.
Articles 62 and 64 of the Danish Constitution ensure judicial independence from Government and Parliament by providing that judges shall only be guided by the law, including acts, statutes and practice."The administration of justice shall always remain independent of the executive power.  Rules to this effect shall be laid down by Statute ..." The Constitution of Denmark – Sections/Articles 62 and 64.

===Foreign relations and military===

Danish foreign policy is based on its identity as a sovereign nation in Europe. As such its primary foreign policy focus is on its relations with other nations as a sovereign independent nation. Denmark has long had good relations with other nations. It has been involved in coordinating Western assistance to the Baltic states (Estonia,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ambtallinn.um.dk/en/menu/TheEmbassy/DanishEstonianDefenceCooperation/DanishEstonianDefenceCooperation.htm|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090309101430/http://www.ambtallinn.um.dk/en/menu/TheEmbassy/DanishEstonianDefenceCooperation/DanishEstonianDefenceCooperation.htm|archivedate=9 March 2009|title=Danish – Estonian Defence Cooperation|author=Danish embassy in Tallinn, Estonia|accessdate=22 February 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] Latvia, and Lithuania).[tpl]cite web |url=http://litauen.um.dk/en/about-us/defence/newsletters/newsdisplaypage/?newsid=00f13429-6dd9-484e-9646-4aa73b9040ba |title=Danish – Latvian Defence Cooperation|author=Danish embassy in Riga, Latvia|accessdate=8 June 2012[/tpl]
Following World War II, Denmark ended its two-hundred-year policy of neutrality. Denmark has been a member of NATO since its founding in 1949, and membership in NATO remains highly popular.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3167.htm|title= US Department of State: Denmark|author= Government of the United States|accessdate=16 June 2012[/tpl] There were several serious confrontations between the U.S. and Denmark on security policy in the so-called "footnote era" (1982–88), when an alternative parliamentary majority forced the government to adopt specific national positions on nuclear and arms control issues. With the end of the Cold War, however, Denmark has been supportive of U.S. policy objectives in the Alliance.
Denmark's armed forces are known as the Danish Defence ([tpl]lang-da|Forsvaret[/tpl]). During peacetime, the Ministry of Defence in Denmark employs around 33,000 in total. The main military branches employ almost 27,000: 15,460 in the Danish Army, 5,300 in the Royal Danish Navy and 6,050 in the Royal Danish Air Force (all including conscripts).
The Danish Emergency Management Agency ([tpl]lang|da|Beredskabsstyrelsen[/tpl]) employs 2,000 (including conscripts), and about 4,000 are in non-branch-specific services like the Danish Defence Command, the Danish Defence Research Establishment and the Danish Defence Intelligence Service. Furthermore around 55,000 serve as volunteers in the Danish Home Guard ([tpl]lang|da|Hjemmeværnet[/tpl]).
The country is a strong supporter of international peacekeeping. The Danish Defence has around 1,400[tpl]cite web|url=http://forsvaret.dk/FMN/Verdenskort/ |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20071227125607/http://forsvaret.dk/FMN/Verdenskort/ |archivedate=27 December 2007 |title=Forsvarsministerens Verdenskort |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=27 December 2007 |accessdate=20 August 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] staff in international missions, not including standing contributions to NATO SNMCMG1. The three largest contributions are in Afghanistan (ISAF), Kosovo (KFOR) and Lebanon (UNIFIL). Between 2003 and 2007, there were approximately 450 Danish soldiers in Iraq.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2007/02/200852514261678446.html |title=Denmark follows UK Iraq pullout |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=21 February 2007 |accessdate=20 August 2009[/tpl]
Denmark is today pursuing an active foreign policy, where human rights, democracy and other crucial values are to be defended actively. In recent years Greenland and the Faroe Islands have been guaranteed a say in foreign policy issues such as fishing, whaling, and geopolitical concerns.

===Administrative divisions===

Denmark proper, with a total area (land and water) of 42,972.53 square kilometers (of which Ertholmene 0.39 km2), is divided into five regions ([tpl]lang-da|regioner[/tpl], singular: region) and a total of 98 municipalities. The regions were created on 1 January 2007 to replace the former counties. At the same time, smaller municipalities were merged into larger units, cutting the number of municipalities from 270 to 98. Most municipalities have a population of at least 20,000 people to give them financial and professional sustainability, although a few exceptions were made to this rule.Denmark: Regions, Municipalities, Cities & Major Urban Areas – Statistics and Maps on City Population.
The most important area of responsibility for regions is the national health service. Unlike the former counties, the regions are not allowed to levy taxes, and the health service is primarily financed by a national health care contribution of eight per cent ([tpl]lang-da|sundhedsbidrag[/tpl]) combined with funds from both government and municipalities.Taxes[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] – Expat In Denmark. Retrieved 13 March 2012.  Municipalities and regions are led by directly elected councils, elected every four years. The most recent Danish local elections were held on 19 November 2013.
The easternmost land in Denmark, the Ertholmene archipelago, with a population of 90 (2014) and area of 39 hectares, is neither part of a municipality nor a region but belongs to the Ministry of Defence.[tpl]cite news |first=Jonas |last=Michael Kjær |title=Christiansø betaler ikke sundhedsbidrag |date=15 November 2006 |url=http://www.dr.dk/Regioner/Bornholm/Nyheder/Christiansoe/2006/11/15160130.htm |work=dr.dk |accessdate=12 August 2007[/tpl] [tpl]da icon[/tpl]
 [tpl]Danish regions[/tpl] 
Note. The Total Area shown in the table is only for the regions and is 42972.14 square kilometers. This number is without Ertholmene (Christiansø) archipelago, 0.39 square kilometers, because it is neither part of a region nor a municipality. Denmark's total area therefore: 42972.53. It is taken from 'Municipal Key Figures' (www.noegletal.dk). Land area of Denmark: around 42394 km2.

====Greenland and the Faroe Islands====

The Kingdom of Denmark is a unitary state, however the Faroe Islands and Greenland were granted home rule (political autonomy)[tpl]cite web|title=Constitution of Denmark Ch 1 Sec 1|url=http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Publications/My%20Constitutional%20Act%20with%20explanations/Chapter%201.aspx|work=The Danish Parliament[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]  in 1948 and 1979 respectively, having previously had the status of counties.The working autonomies in Europe – Gesellschaft für bedrohte Völker (GFBV). Retrieved 13 March 2012.The unity of the Realm – Statsministeriet – stm.dk. Retrieved 13 March 2012.  Extensive powers have been devolved to the Faroe Islands and Greenland, which have their own governments and legislatures and are effectively self-governing in regards to domestic affairs. However, the devolved legislatures are subordinate to the Folketing where the two territories are represented by two seats each. High Commissioners ([tpl]lang-da|Rigsombudsmand[/tpl]) act as representatives of the Danish government in the Faroese Løgting and in the Parliament of Greenland, but they can not vote. The Faroese government is defined to be an equal partner with the Danish government in the act of 2005 (Act on the Faroese authorities acquisition of affairs and fields)retsinformation.dk Lov om de færøske myndigheders overtagelse af sager og sagsområder[tpl]da icon[/tpl] Denne lov bygger på en overenskomst mellem Færøernes landsstyre og den danske regering som ligeværdige parter.Logir.fo LÓG NR. 79 FRÁ 12.

==Economy==

Denmark has a modern, prosperous and developed mixed market economy, ranking 21st in the world in terms of GDP (PPP) per capita and 10th in nominal GDP per capita.  A liberalisation of import tariffs in 1797 marked the end of mercantilism and further liberalisation in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century established the Danish liberal tradition in international trade that was only to be broken by the 1930s.Henriksen, Ingrid.

===Transport===

Significant investment has been made in building road and rail links between regions in Denmark, most notably the Great Belt Fixed Link, which connects Zealand and Funen. It is now possible to drive from Frederikshavn in northern Jutland to Copenhagen on eastern Zealand without leaving the motorway. The main railway operator is DSB for passenger services and DB Schenker Rail for freight trains. The railway tracks are maintained by Banedanmark. The North Sea and the Baltic Sea are intertwined by various, international ferry links. Construction of the Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link, connecting Denmark and Germany with a second link, will start in 2015.
Copenhagen has a Metro system, the Copenhagen Metro, and the Greater Copenhagen area has an extensive electrified suburban railway network, the S-train. In the four biggest cities - Copenhagen, Århus, Odense, Aalborg - light rail systems are planned to be in operation around 2020. The light rail in Greater Copenhagen will traverse 11 municipalities, providing a much needed corridor from Lyngby in the north to Ishøj in the south .[tpl]cite web|title=Ring 3 summary report|url=http://www.ringtre.dk/fileadmin/filer/freesites/ringtre/filer/Letbane/Dokumenter/Resume_UK_final03.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2014[/tpl] With Norway and Sweden, Denmark is part of the Scandinavian Airlines, and Copenhagen Airport forms the largest hub in Scandinavia.

Private vehicles are increasingly used as a means of transport. Because of the high registration tax (180%), VAT (25%), and one of the world's highest income tax rates, new cars are very expensive. The purpose of the tax is to discourage car ownership. The car fleet has increased by 45% over the last 30 years.
In 2007, an attempt was made by the government to favour environmentally friendly cars by slightly reducing taxes on high mileage vehicles. However, this has had little effect, and in 2008 Denmark experienced an increase in the import of fuel inefficient old cars[tpl]cite news |title=Tyske miljøzoner sender gamle biler til Danmark |date=9 January 2009 |url=http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE626918/tyske-miljoezoner-sender-gamle-biler-til-danmark/ |work=Politiken.dk |accessdate=29 November 2010 |language=Danish[/tpl] primarily from Germany, as the cost for older cars—including taxes—keeps them within the budget of many Danes.

After deregulating the labour market in the 1990s, Denmark has one of the most free labour markets among the European countries. According to World Bank labour market rankings, the labour market flexibility is at the same levels as the United States. Around 80% of employees belong to unions and the unemployment funds that are attached to them. Labour market policies are mainly determined by negotiations between the workers' unions and employers' unions, and the government only interferes if labour strikes extend for too long.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Despite the success of the trade unions, a growing number of people make contracts individually rather than collectively, and many (four out of ten employees) are contemplating dropping especially unemployment fund but occasionally even union membership altogether. The average employee receives a benefit at 47% of their wage level if they have to claim benefits when unemployed. With low unemployment, very few expect to be claiming benefits at all. The only reason then to pay the earmarked money to the unemployment fund would be to retire early and receive early retirement pay (efterløn), which is possible from the age of 60 provided an additional earmarked contribution is paid to the unemployment fund.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ugebreveta4.dk/2008/200826/Baggrundoganalyse/LoenmodtagereKlarTilNyeDagpengeregler.aspx |title=LO's ugebrev/2008 |publisher=Ugebreveta4.dk |accessdate=20 August 2009[/tpl]

The level of unemployment benefits is dependent on former employment (the maximum benefit is at 90% of the wage) and at times also on membership of an unemployment fund, which is almost always—but need not be—administered by a trade union, and the previous payment of contributions. However, the largest share of the financing is still carried by the central government and is financed by general taxation, and only to a minor degree from earmarked contributions.

Denmark follows the Nordic model of a mixed economy, characterised by a large welfare state, a high level of public expenditure and a universal social system (including health care), financed by taxes and not by social contributions. The welfare model is accompanied by a taxation system that is both broad based (25% VAT, not including excise, duty and tax) and with a progressive income tax model, meaning the more money that is earned, the higher income tax percentage that gets paid (minimum tax rate for adults is 42% scaling to over 60%, except for the residents of Ertholmene that escape the otherwise ubiquitous 8% healthcare tax fraction of the income taxes[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.skat.dk/SKAT.aspx?oId=133800 |title=Skattesatser; bundgrænser, procenter og fradrag |publisher=Skat.dk |accessdate=29 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.skm.dk/tal_statistik/kommuneskatter/procenter/?year=2009 |title=Kommuneskatter 2007, 2008 og 2009 |publisher=Skm.dk |accessdate=29 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]).

==Demographics==

According to 2012 figures from Statistics Denmark, 89.6% of Denmark's population of over 5,580,516 is of Danish descent (defined as having at least one parent who was born in Denmark and has Danish citizenship).
 Many of the remaining 10.4% are immigrants—or descendants of recent immigrants—that came mainly from Turkey, Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, South Asia and the Middle East. Of the 10.4%, approximately 200,000 (34%) are of a Western background, and approx. 390,000 (66%) have a non-Western background.Immigrants and their descendants – Statistcs Denmark.

===Education===

The Danish education system provides access to primary school, secondary school and higher education. All college and university education in Denmark is free of charges; there are no tuition fees to enroll in courses. Students in secondary school or higher and aged 18 or above may apply for state educational support grants, known as Statens Uddannelsesstøtte (SU) which provides fixed financial support, disbursed monthly. The Education Index lists Denmark 16th in 2011 based on mean years of schooling (of adults) and expected years of schooling (of children).[tpl]cite web|title=Education index (expected and mean years of schooling)|url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/indicators/103706.html|publisher=UN HDRO|accessdate=20 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Primary school is known as the folkeskole. Attendance at primary school is not compulsory, but most Danish children go to primary school for 10 years, from the age of 6 to 16. Whilst attending a primary school is not compulsory, receiving education at primary school-level is and must be provided for nine years. There are no final exams, but pupils in primary schools can choose to go to a test when finishing ninth grade. The test is obligatory if further education is to be attended. Pupils can alternatively attend a private independent school ([tpl]lang|da|friskole[/tpl]), or a private school ([tpl]lang|da|privatskole[/tpl]) – schools that are not under the administration of the municipalities, such as Christian schools or Waldorf schools.
Following graduation from primary school, there are several educational opportunities; the Gymnasium (STX) attaches importance in teaching a mix of humanities and science, Higher Technical Examination Programme (HTX) focuses on scientific subjects and the Higher Commercial Examination Programme emphasizes on subjects in economics. Higher Preparatory Examination (HF) is similar to Gymnasium (STX), but is one year shorter.
For specific professions, there is the vocational education, training young people for work in specific trades by a combination of teaching and apprenticeship.
Danish universities and other higher education institutions offer international students a range of opportunities for obtaining an internationally recognised qualification in Denmark. Many programmes may be taught in the English language, the academic lingua franca, in bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, Ph.D.s and student exchange programmes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://studyindenmark.dk/ |title=Study in Denmark, official government website on international higher education in Denmark[/tpl]

===Health care===

Along with Sweden and Norway, Denmark has a universal health care system, financed by taxes and not by social contributions. This system is largely financed through local, municipal taxation with integrated funding and provision of health care at the regional level. It is the most important area of responsibility for the local regions. Unlike the former counties, the regions are not allowed to levy taxes, and the health service is primarily financed by a national health care contribution of 8 percent ([tpl]lang-da|sundhedsbidrag[/tpl]) combined with funds from both government and municipalities. Denmark spends 9.8 percent of GDP on healthcare. The life expectancy in Denmark is 78.6 years, and there is one doctor for every 294 persons in Denmark.[tpl]cite web|url=http://floathaven.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=179|title=Social responsibility in a technocracy|publisher=FloatHaven/TEL|year=2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]

From the mid-1990s, Danish films have attracted international attention, especially those associated with Dogme 95 like those of Lars von Trier.

===Popular media===

Danish cinema dates back to 1897 and since the 1980s has maintained a steady stream of product due largely to funding by the state-supported Danish Film Institute.  The three big internationally important waves of Danish cinema have been the erotic melodrama of the silent era, the increasingly explicit sex films of the 1960s and 1970s, and lastly, the Dogme 95 movement of the late 1990s.  Danish films have been noted for their realism, religious and moral themes, sexual frankness and technical innovation. The Danish filmmaker Carl Th. Dreyer (1889–1968) is considered one of the greatest directors of early cinema.[tpl]cite web|title=Carl Dreyer:Day of Wrath, Ordet, Gertrud|url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/29/carldreyer.php|work=Bright Lights Film Journal|accessdate=1 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Ebert|first=Robert|title=The Passion of Joan of Arc|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-passion-of-joan-of-arc-1928|work=Chicago Sun Times|accessdate=1 July 2013|date=16 February 1997|quote=...Carl Theodor Dreyer (1889–1968), the Dane who was one of the greatest early directors.[/tpl]
Other Danish filmmakers of note include Erik Balling, the creator of the popular Olsen-banden films; Gabriel Axel, an Oscar-winner for Babette's Feast in 1987; and Bille August, the Oscar-, Palme d'Or- and Golden Globe-winner for Pelle the Conqueror in 1988. In the modern era, notable filmmakers in Denmark include Lars von Trier, who co-created the Dogme film movement, and multiple award-winners Susanne Bier and Nicolas Winding Refn. Mads Mikkelsen is a world-renowned Danish actor, having starred in films such as King Arthur, Casino Royale, the Danish film The Hunt, and currently in the American TV series Hannibal.
Danish mass media and news programming are dominated by a few large corporations. In printed media JP/Politikens Hus and Berlingske Media, between them, control the largest newspapers Politiken, Berlingske Tidende and Jyllands-Posten and major tabloids B.T. and Ekstra Bladet. In television, publicly owned stations DR and TV 2 have large shares of the viewers.TNS-Gallup meter; Television station viewer statistics, figures for July 2012 (week 28). Retrieved 20 July 2012. Especially DR is famous for its high quality TV-series often sold to foreign broadcast and often with strong leading female characters like internationally known actresses Sidse Babett Knudsen and Sofie Gråbøl. In radio, DR has a near monopoly, currently broadcasting on all four nationally available FM channels, competing only with local stations. The mainstream media is still very much dominant in Denmark, but the share of Danes going online for news is steadily growing.
Copenhagen and its multiple outlying islands have a wide range of folk traditions. The Royal Danish Orchestra is among the world's oldest orchestras. Denmark's most famous classical composer is Carl Nielsen, especially remembered for his six symphonies and his Wind Quintet, while the Royal Danish Ballet specializes in the work of the Danish choreographer August Bournonville. Danes have distinguished themselves as jazz musicians, and the Copenhagen Jazz Festival has acquired an international reputation.
Victor Borge, a Danish comedian and musician, achieved world renown in stage, radio and television appearances spanning 60 years, with his unique blend of comedy and piano playing.
In the early days of rock and beat, Danish artists quickly adapted this new type of music with success and jazz's popularity waned. The modern pop and rock scene has produced a few names of note, including Aqua, Volbeat, D-A-D, Nekromantix, Dizzy Mizz Lizzy, The Raveonettes, Michael Learns to Rock, Tina Dico, Alphabeat, Outlandish, Efterklang, Medina, Oh Land, Kashmir, Mew and Dúné. All together, Lars Ulrich, the drummer of the band Metallica, has become the first Danish musician to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
More recently, in 2013 Denmark entered the Eurovision Song Contest and won with Emmelie de Forest's song 'Only Teardrops'. The Eurovision song contest 2014 will be held in Denmark.

===Architecture and design===

Denmark's architecture became firmly established in the Middle Ages when first Romanesque, then Gothic churches and cathedrals sprang up throughout the country. From the 16th century, Dutch and Flemish designers were brought to Denmark, initially to improve the country's fortifications, but increasingly to build magnificent royal castles and palaces in the Renaissance style.
During the 17th century, many impressive buildings were built in the Baroque style, both in the capital and the provinces. Neoclassicism from France was slowly adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style. A productive period of Historicism ultimately merged into the 19th-century National Romantic style.[tpl]Wayback |date=20110719130528 |url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/irland/en-ie/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/arkitektur/danish-architecture-an-overview.htm |title="Danish Architecture: An Overview" [/tpl], Visit Denmark. Retrieved 3 September 2011.
The 20th century brought along new architectural styles; including expressionism, best exemplified by the designs of architect Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint, which relied heavily on Scandinavian brick Gothic traditions; and Nordic Classicism, which enjoyed brief popularity in the early decades of the century. It was in the 1960s that Danish architects such as Arne Jacobsen entered the world scene with their highly successful Functionalist architecture. This, in turn, has evolved into more recent world-class masterpieces including Jørn Utzon's Sydney Opera House and Johan Otto von Spreckelsen's Grande Arche de la Défense in Paris, paving the way for a number of contemporary Danish designers such as Bjarke Ingels to be rewarded for excellence both at home and abroad.[tpl]Wayback |date=20100206051248 |url=http://www.ambhanoi.um.dk/en/menu/InfoDenmark/Danish+Culture/Architecture/ |title="Architecture" [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl], Embassy of Denmark, Hanoi.

Danish design is also a well-known brand, often associated with world-famous designers and architects such as Børge Mogensen (1914–1972), Finn Juhl (1912–1989), Hans Wegner (1914–2007), Arne Jacobsen (1902–1971), Poul Kjærholm (1929–1980), Poul Henningsen (1894–1967) and Verner Panton (1926–1998)."Danish by Design", DDC. Retrieved 4 September 2011. Georg Jensen (1866–1935) is noted for his modern design in silver.
Other designers of note include Kristian Solmer Vedel (1923–2003) in the area of industrial design, Jens Harald Quistgaard (1919–2008) for kitchen furniture and implements and Ole Wanscher (1903–1985) who had a classical approach to furniture design.

===Literature and philosophy===

The first known Danish literature is myths and folklore from the 10th and 11th century. Saxo Grammaticus, normally considered the first Danish writer, worked for bishop Absalon on a chronicle of Danish history (Gesta Danorum). Very little is known of other Danish literature from the Middle Ages. With the Age of Enlightenment came Ludvig Holberg whose comedy plays are still being performed.
In the late 19th century, literature was seen as a way to influence society. Known as the Modern Breakthrough, this movement was championed by Georg Brandes, Henrik Pontoppidan (awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature) and J. P. Jacobsen. Romanticism influenced the renowned writer and poet Hans Christian Andersen, known for his stories and fairy tales, e.g. The Ugly Duckling, The Little Mermaid and The Snow Queen. In recent history Johannes Vilhelm Jensen was also awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Karen Blixen is famous for her novels and short stories. Other Danish writers of importance are Herman Bang, Gustav Wied, William Heinesen, Martin Andersen Nexø, Piet Hein, Hans Scherfig, Klaus Rifbjerg, Dan Turèll, Tove Ditlevsen, Inger Christensen and Peter Høeg.
Danish philosophy has a long tradition as part of Western philosophy. Perhaps the most influential Danish philosopher was Søren Kierkegaard, the creator of Christian existentialism. Kierkegaard had a few Danish followers, including Harald Høffding, who later in his life moved on to join the movement of positivism. Among Kierkegaard's other followers include Jean-Paul Sartre who was impressed with Kierkegaard's views on the individual, and Rollo May, who helped create humanistic psychology. Another Danish philosopher of note is Grundtvig, whose philosophy gave rise to a new form of non-aggressive nationalism in Denmark, and who is also influential for his theological and historical works.

===Painting and photography===

While Danish art was influenced over the centuries by trends in Germany and the Netherlands, the 15th- and 16th-century church frescos, which can be seen in many of the country's older churches, are of particular interest as they were painted in a style typical of native Danish painters.Wall Paintings in Danish Churches from Panoramas.dk. Retrieved 12 August 2009. Adopting the Biblia pauperum approach, they present many of the most popular stories from the Old and New Testaments.
The Danish Golden Age, which began in the first half of the 19th century, was inspired by a new feeling of nationalism and romanticism. Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg was not only a productive artist in his own right but taught at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where his students included notable painters such as Wilhelm Bendz, Christen Købke, Martinus Rørbye, Constantin Hansen, and Wilhelm Marstrand. The sculpture of Bertel Thorvaldsen was also significant during this period."Guide to the Danish Golden Age"[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]. Retrieved 4 September 2011.
In 1871, Holger Drachmann and Karl Madsen visited Skagen in the far north of Jutland where they quickly built up one of Scandinavia's most successful artists' colonies specializing in Naturalism and Realism rather than in the traditional approach favoured by the Academy. Hosted by Michael and his wife Anna, they were soon joined by P.S. Krøyer, Carl Locher and Laurits Tuxen. All participated in painting the natural surroundings and local people.Art Encyclopedia: Skagen. Retrieved 9 December 2008.

Danish photography has developed from strong participation and interest in the very beginnings of the art in 1839 to the success of a considerable number of Danes in the world of photography today. Pioneers such as Mads Alstrup and Georg Emil Hansen paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during the last half of the 19th century while both artistic and press photographers made internationally recognised contributions. Today Danish photographers such as Astrid Kruse Jensen and Jacob Aue Sobol are active both at home and abroad, participating in key exhibitions around the world.Contemporary Danish Photography.

===Cuisine===

The cuisine of Denmark, like that of the other Nordic countries and of Northern Germany, consists mainly of meat and fish. This stems from the country's agricultural past, its geography, and its climate of long, cold winters. With [tpl]convert|145.9|kg|1|abbr=on[/tpl] of meat per person consumed in 2002, Denmark has the highest consumption of meat per person of any country in the world.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/meat-consumption-per-capita-climate-change |title=Meat consumption per capita |work=The Guardian |accessdate=10 May 2012 |first=Felicity |last=Brown |date=2 September 2009[/tpl]
The open sandwiches, known as smørrebrød, which in their basic form are the usual fare for lunch, can be considered a national speciality when prepared and decorated with a variety of fine ingredients. Hot meals traditionally consist of ground meats, such as frikadeller (meat balls), or of more substantial meat and fish dishes such as flæskesteg (roast pork with crackling) or kogt torsk (poached cod) with mustard sauce and trimmings. Denmark is known for its Carlsberg and Tuborg beers and for its akvavit and bitters although imported wine is now gaining popularity.
Danish chefs, inspired by continental practices, have in recent years developed an innovative series of gourmet dishes based on high-quality local produce. As a result, Copenhagen and the provinces now have a considerable number of highly acclaimed restaurants of which several have been awarded Michelin stars.

===Sports===

Sports are popular in Denmark, and its citizens participate in and watch a wide variety. The national sport is football.[tpl]cite web |title=Danish Football - The National Sport of Denmark |url=http://denmark.dk/en/lifestyle/sport/danish-football-the-national-sport-of-denmark/|work=denmark.dk |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark |accessdate=5 March 2014[/tpl] Denmark qualified six times in a row between 1984 and 2004 for the European Championships, and won the Championship in 1992. Other significant achievements include winning the Confederations Cup in 1995 and reaching the quarter-final of the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Notable Danish footballers include Peter Schmeichel, named the "World's Best Goalkeeper" in 1992 and 1993, and Michael Laudrup, named the best Danish player of all time by the Danish Football Association in 2006.[tpl]cite web |title=Michael Laudrup bedste spiller gennem tiderne |publisher=DBU |date=13 November 2006 |url= http://www.dbu.dk/news/newsShow.aspx?id=235647 |accessdate=18 November 2012[/tpl]
There is much focus on handball, too. The women's national team celebrated great successes during the 1990s, while in the last decade, the men's team have been more successful. Denmark has qualified for numerous semifinals and finals at the European and World Championships and is often on top of the official world rankings.EHF's national teams ranking
In recent years, Denmark's best tennis and golf players have had some remarkable results. Caroline Wozniacki has been world number one in women's tennis, and in 2012, Frederik Løchte Nielsen surprisingly won the Wimbledon doubles tournament together with a British player. In golf, Thomas Bjørn has twice finished as a runner-up at British Open, and counts as one of Europe's best players since the mid-1990s. Other strong players are Anders Hansen, Søren Hansen, Søren Kjeldsen, and Thorbjørn Olesen.
Denmark has had a strong tradition within the sport of cycling, too. However, the successes of riders such as Rolf Sørensen, Bjarne Riis and Michael Rasmussen have shown to have been based on the use of doping.
In motorsports, Denmark has primarily excelled in speedway racing, winning several world championships since the 1970s. Tom Kristensen then put car racing on top of the Danish sports agenda, as he took his first trophy at the 24 hour race in Le Mans in 1997. He has now (2014) been a member of the winning team nine times, an all-time record.
Boxing has also been a focus in Denmark. Mikkel Kessler, "The Viking Warrior", has become a staple icon in boxing circles. Kessler is a five-time world champion, having held the WBA title two additional times and the WBC super middleweight championship twice as well.
Other popular sports in Denmark include sailing and rowing (Denmark specialize in light-weight rowing and are particularly known for their light-weight coxless four, having won six gold and two silver World Championship medals and three gold and two bronze Olympic medals). Denmark's numerous beaches and resorts are popular locations for fishing, canoeing, kayaking, windsurfing, and many other water-themed sports. Many female Danish swimmers have had great results in recent years, including Rikke Møller Pedersen and Jeanette Ottesen.
Indoors, sports such as badminton, table tennis and gymnastics attract many Danes, too. An interest which is reflected in great results at international competitions. However, when asking the average Dane about active hobbies, he or she is most likely to mention running or fitness as preferred activities.Danskernes sports- og motionsvaner 2011
