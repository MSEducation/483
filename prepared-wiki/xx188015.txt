==Design and construction==

General John McE. Hyde was among the hundreds of small vessels acquired after the Spanish American War and during the early part of the Twentieth Century to support overseas outposts that were owned and operated by the US Army for specific logistical purposes.
This vessel along with a sister-ship, General Frank M. Coxe, was designed and built shortly after World War I, to ferry army personnel within strategic harbors. It was designed by the New York firm of Cox & Stevens, who were renowned Naval Architects specializing in yachts and small commercial and military craft. The Hyde was built in 1921, followed in 1922 by General Frank M. Coxe, to Cox & Stevens design  #244. The ships were built on the Kanawha River, by Charles Ward Engineering Works of Charleston, West Virginia, a firm which specialized in shallow draft vessels such as ferries, riverboats, and tugs.[tpl]cite web |url=http://shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/5small/inactive/ward.htm |title=Ward Engineering, Charleston WV |author=T.
