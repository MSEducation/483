Sildenafil citrate, sold as Viagra, Revatio and under various other trade names, is a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). It was originally developed by British scientists and then brought to market by the US-based pharmaceutical company Pfizer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Boolell M, Allen MJ, Ballard SA, Gepi-Attee S, Muirhead GJ, Naylor AM, Osterloh IH, Gingell C | title = Sildenafil: an orally active type 5 cyclic GMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor for the treatment of penile erectile dysfunction | journal = Int. J. Impot. Res. | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 47–52 |date=June 1996 | pmid = 8858389 | doi = [/tpl] It acts by inhibiting cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), an enzyme that promotes degradation of cGMP, which regulates blood flow in the penis. Since becoming available in 1998, sildenafil has been the prime treatment for erectile dysfunction; its primary competitors on the market are tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra).

==Medical uses==

===Sexual dysfunction===

The primary indication of sildenafil is treatment of erectile dysfunction (inability to sustain a satisfactory erection to complete intercourse). Its use is now standard treatment for erectile dysfunction in all settings, including diabetes.[tpl]cite journal | author = Vardi M, Nini A | title = Phosphodiesterase inhibitors for erectile dysfunction in patients with diabetes mellitus | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 1 | pages = CD002187 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17253475 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002187.pub3 | editor1-last = Vardi | editor1-first = Moshe [/tpl]
People on antidepressants may experience sexual dysfunction, either as a result of their illness or as a result of their treatment. A 2003 study showed that sildenafil improved sexual function in men in this situation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nurnberg HG, Hensley PL, Gelenberg AJ, Fava M, Lauriello J, Paine S |title=Treatment of antidepressant-associated sexual dysfunction with sildenafil: a randomized controlled trial |journal=JAMA |volume=289 |issue=1 |pages=56–64 |date=January 2003 |pmid=12503977 |doi= 10.1001/jama.289.1.56|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=195700[/tpl] Following up reports from 1999,[tpl]cite journal |author=Nurnberg HG, Hensley PL, Lauriello J, Parker LM, Keith SJ |title=Sildenafil for women patients with antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction |journal=Psychiatr Serv |volume=50 |issue=8 |pages=1076–8 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10445658 |doi= |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=83269[/tpl] the same researchers found that sildenafil improved sexual function in female patients on antidepressants as well.[tpl]cite journal | author=Nurnberg HG, Hensley PL, Heiman JR, Croft HA, Debattista C, Paine S | title=Sildenafil Treatment of Women With Antidepressant-Associated Sexual Dysfunction | journal=JAMA | year=2008 | volume=300 | issue=4 | pages=395–404 | doi=10.1001/jama.300.4.395 | pmid=18647982[/tpl]

===Pulmonary hypertension===

As well as erectile dysfunction, sildenafil citrate is also effective in the rare disease pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). It relaxes the arterial wall, leading to decreased pulmonary arterial resistance and pressure. This, in turn, reduces the workload of the right ventricle of the heart and improves symptoms of right-sided heart failure. Because PDE5 is primarily distributed within the arterial wall smooth muscle of the lungs and penis, sildenafil acts selectively in both these areas without inducing vasodilation in other areas of the body. Pfizer submitted an additional registration for sildenafil to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and sildenafil was approved for this indication in June 2005. The preparation is named Revatio, to avoid confusion with Viagra, and the 20 milligram tablets are white and round. Sildenafil joins bosentan and prostacyclin-based therapies for this condition.[tpl]Cite press release|title = FDA Approves Pfizer's Revatio as Treatment for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension|publisher = Pfizer|url = http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/are/news_releases/2005pr/mn_2005_0606.jsp|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050828190033/http://www.pfizer.com/pfizer/are/news_releases/2005pr/mn_2005_0606.jsp|date = June 6, 2005|archivedate = August 28, 2005[/tpl]

===Altitude sickness===

Sildenafil has been shown to be useful for the prevention and treatment of high-altitude pulmonary edema associated with altitude sickness such as that suffered by mountain climbers.[tpl]cite journal |author=Richalet JP, Gratadour P, Robach P, et al. |title=Sildenafil inhibits altitude-induced hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension |journal=Am.

===Dosage===

Viagra pills are blue and diamond-shaped with the word "Pfizer" engraved on one side, and "VGR xx" (where xx stands for "25", "50" or "100", the dose of that pill in milligrams) engraved on the other. It is taken not more than once per day between 30 minutes and 4 hours prior to sexual intercourse.
The dosage for pulmonary arterial hypertension (Revatio) is three times a day. Revatio pills are white, round, film-coated tablets imprinted with "RVT 20" embossed on one side.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/pill_identification.html |title=Pill Identifier |publisher=Drugs.com |quote=This site is intended for viewing by the USA audience only.

==Adverse effects==

In clinical trials, the most common adverse effects of sildenafil use included headache, flushing, dyspepsia, nasal congestion and impaired vision, including photophobia and blurred vision.[tpl]cite web|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CBFCX3lQ|archivedate=14 November 2012|url=http://www.pfizer.com/files/products/uspi_viagra.pdf |format=PDF|title=Viagra Prescribing Information |date=October 2007 |publisher=Pfizer |accessdate=14 November 2012[/tpl]

Rare but serious adverse effects found through postmarketing surveillance include priapism, severe hypotension, myocardial infarction (heart attack), ventricular arrhythmias, stroke, increased intraocular pressure, and sudden hearing loss. As a result of these postmarketing reports, in October 2007, the FDA announced that the labeling for all PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil, required a more prominent warning of the potential risk of sudden hearing loss.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2007/NEW01730.html |title=FDA Announces Revisions to Labels for Cialis, Levitra and Viagra |date=18 October 2007 |publisher=United States Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=10 February 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070711031126/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2007/NEW01730.html|deadurl = yes|archivedate = 11 July 2007[/tpl]

===Interactions===

Care should be exercised by patients that are also taking protease inhibitors for the treatment of HIV. Protease inhibitors inhibit the metabolism of sildenafil, effectively multiplying the plasma levels of sildenafil, increasing the incidence and severity of side effects. It is recommended that patients using protease inhibitors limit their use of sildenafil to no more than one 25 mg dose every 48 hours.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pfizer.com/files/products/uspi_viagra.pdf|title=Viagra (sildenafil citrate) tablets|date=October 2007|publisher=Pzifer|accessdate=2009-10-25|location=page 29[/tpl] Other drugs that interfere with the metabolism of sildenafil include erythromycin and cimetidine, both of which can also lead to prolonged plasma half life levels.
Concomitant use of sildenafil and an alpha blocker may lead to low blood pressure, but this effect does not occur if they are taken at least four hours apart.[tpl]cite journal|author=Kloner RA|title=Pharmacology and drug interaction effects of the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors: focus on alpha-blocker interactions|journal=Am J Cardiol|year=2005|volume=96|issue=12B|pages=42M–46M|pmid=16387566 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjcard.2005.07.011[/tpl]

===Recreational use===

Sildenafil's popularity with young adults has increased over the years.[tpl]cite news|author=Peterson K|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2001-03-21-viagra-abuse.htm|title=Young men add Viagra to their drug arsenal|publisher=USAToday|date=2001-03-21[/tpl] Sildenafil's trade name "Viagra" is widely recognized in popular culture, and the drug's association with treating erectile dysfunction has led to its recreational use.[tpl]cite journal | author = Smith KM, Romanelli F | title = Recreational use and misuse of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors | journal = J Am Pharm Assoc (2003) | volume = 45 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–72; quiz 73–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15730119 | doi = 10.1331/1544345052843165 [/tpl] The reasons behind such use include the belief that the drug increases libido, improves sexual performance, or permanently increases penis size.Sildenafil Will Not Affect Libido - Fact! Studies on the effects of viagra when used recreationally are limited, but suggest that it has little effect when used by those not suffering from erectile dysfunction. In one study, a 25 mg dose was shown to cause no significant change in erectile quality, but did reduce the post-ejaculatory refractory time.[tpl]cite journal | author = Mondaini N, Ponchietti R, Muir GH, Montorsi F, Di Loro F, Lombardi G, Rizzo M | title = Sildenafil does not improve sexual function in men without erectile dysfunction but does reduce the postorgasmic refractory time | journal = Int.

Some users mix it with methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy), other stimulants, or opiates in an attempt to compensate for the common side effect of erectile dysfunction, a combination known as "sextasy", "rockin' and rollin'," or "trail mix." Mixing with amyl nitrite is particularly dangerous and potentially fatal.

===Use in sports===

Professional athletes have been documented using sildenafil, believing the opening of their blood vessels will enrich their muscles. In turn, they believe that it will enhance their performance.[tpl]cite news |authors=Teri Thompson, Christian Red, Michael O'Keefffe, and Nathaniel Vinton |title=Source: Roger Clemens, host of athletes pop Viagra to help onfield performance |publisher=Daily News |work=Daily News |date=10 June 2008 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/source-roger-clemens-host-athletes-pop-viagra-onfield-performance-article-1.171270 |accessdate=2009-02-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author = Busbee J | url=http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/bears-brandon-marshall-says-nfl-players-viagra-field-184549686--nfl.html | title = Bears’ Brandon Marshall says some NFL players use Viagra … ON THE FIELD | publisher = Yahoo!

===Cut flowers===

Israeli and Australian researchers discovered that 1 mg of the drug dissolved in a vase of water can extend the shelf life of cut flowers, making them stand up straight for up to a week beyond their natural life span. The drug also slows down plant ripening; tests were done strawberries, legumes, roses, carnations, broccoli, and other perishables. Viagra increases the vase life of the flowers by slowing the breakdown of cGMP by cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5. The Viagra acts on the cGMP in a fashion similar to nitric oxide (which also slows down the ripening process), but was found to be easier to use with cut flowers.[tpl]cite journal | author = Siegel-Itzkovich J | title = In brief: Viagra makes flowers stand up straight | journal = BMJ | volume = 319 | issue = 7205 | pages = 274B |date=July 1999 | pmid = 10426724 | pmc = 1126921 | doi =10.1136/bmj.319.7205.274a [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/lehre/bza/molnews/sildenafil/sildenafil.htm | title = Prolongation of the shelf life of fruits and flowers | publisher = Biology Department, University of Hamburg | accessdate = 28 November 2012 [/tpl]

===Analogs===

Acetildenafil is a structural analog of sildenafil, one of the PDE5 inhibitors found in a number of "herbal" aphrodisiac products sold over-the-counter. This class of analogs has not undergone any of the rigorous testing that drugs like sildenafil have passed, and, thus, has an unknown side-effect profile.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15287390600751355 | author = Oh SS, Zou P, Low MY, Koh HL.

==Detection in biological fluids==

Sildenafil and/or N-desmethylsildenafil, its major active metabolite, may be quantitated in plasma, serum or whole blood to assess pharmacokinetic status in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage.R. Baselt, Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man, 9th edition, Biomedical Publications, Seal Beach, CA, 2011, pp. 1552–1553. http://www.biomedicalpublications.com/dt9.pdf

==Mechanism of action==

The mechanism of action of sildenafil involves the protection of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from degradation by cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum of the penis binds to guanylate cyclase receptors, which results in increased levels of cGMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation (vasodilation) of the intimal cushions of the helicine arteries. This smooth muscle relaxation leads to vasodilation and increased inflow of blood into the spongy tissue of the penis, causing an erection.[tpl]cite journal|author=Webb, D.J.; Freestone, S.; Allen, M.J.; Muirhead, G.J.|title=Sildenafil citrate and blood-pressure-lowering drugs: results of drug interaction studies with an organic nitrate and a calcium antagonist|date=March 4, 1999|journal=Am. J. Cardiol.|volume=83|issue=5A|pages=21C–28C|pmid=10078539|doi=10.1016/S0002-9149(99)00044-2[/tpl] Robert F. Furchgott, Ferid Murad and Louis Ignarro won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1998 for their independent study of the metabolic pathway of nitric oxide in smooth muscle vasodilation.
Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. The molecular structure of sildenafil is similar to that of cGMP and acts as a competitive binding agent of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in more cGMP and better erections. Without sexual stimulation, and therefore lack of activation of the NO/cGMP system, sildenafil should not cause an erection. Other drugs that operate by the same mechanism include tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra).
Sildenafil is broken down in the liver by hepatic metabolism using cytochrome p450 enzymes, mainly CYP450 3A4(major route),but also by CYP2C9(minor route) hepatic isoenzymes. The major product of metabolisation by these enzymes is N-desmethylated sildenafil, which is metabolised further. This metabolite also has an affinity for the PDE receptors, about 40% of that of sildenafil. Thus, the metabolite is responsible for about 20% of sildenafil's action. Sildenafil is excreted as metabolites predominantly in the feces (approximately 80% of administered oral dose) and to a lesser extent in the urine (approximately 13% of the administered oral dose).  If taken with a high-fat meal, absorption is reduced; the time taken to reach the maximum plasma concentration increases by around one hour, and the maximum concentration itself is decreased by nearly one-third.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.rxlist.com/viagra-drug/clinical-pharmacology.htm | title = Viagra Clinical Pharmacology | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2008-08-20 | publisher = RxList.com[/tpl]

==History==

===Origins===

Sildenafil (compound UK-92,480) was synthesized by a group of pharmaceutical chemists working at Pfizer's Sandwich, Kent, research facility in England. It was initially studied for use in hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina pectoris (a symptom of ischaemic heart disease). The first clinical trials were conducted in Morriston Hospital in Swansea.[tpl]cite web| title=Research | url=http://www.abm.university-trust.wales.nhs.uk/page.cfm?orgId=743&pid=29457 | date= 4 July 2008 | accessdate=6 August 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080926034946/http://www.abm.university-trust.wales.nhs.uk/page.cfm?orgId=743&pid=29457|deadurl = yes|archivedate = 26 September 2008|publisher = Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board|website = ABM|quote = Our clinicians regularly offer patients the opportunity to take part in trials of new drugs and treatments.

The drug was patented in 1996, approved for use in erectile dysfunction by the FDA on March 27, 1998, becoming the first oral treatment approved to treat erectile dysfunction in the United States, and offered for sale in the United States later that year.[tpl]cite journal|author=Kling J|title=From hypertension to angina to Viagra|journal=Mod.

===Marketing and sales===

On November 8, 2012 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Pfizer's patent 2,163,446 on Viagra was invalid from the beginning because the company did not provide full disclosure in its application.

Pfizer Canada Inc., pointed to section 27(3)(b) of The Patent Act which requires that disclosure must include sufficient information "to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it pertains" to produce it. It added further: "As a matter of policy and sound statutory interpretation, patentees cannot be allowed to 'game' the system in this way.
