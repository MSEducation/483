Equality Maryland (EQMD) is a non-profit organization formerly headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland, now based in Baltimore.  It is the largest organization in Maryland whose activities focus on advocacy and education with regard to LGBT social and political movements. Its mission includes: the passage of laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender expression, and gender identity; the expansion of Maryland's hate-crimes statute; the increase of domestic partner benefits; and the legal recognition of same-sex marriage in Maryland.

==Structure==

The organization began operations in 1990 under the name of Free State Justice, inspired by the Baltimore Justice Campaign that organized the successful amendment to the city's human rights law for gays and lesbians in 1988. The organization was renamed Equality Maryland in 2004. Equality Maryland has three divisions, which share offices, staff, and other resources: two non-profit organizations, each of which has its own mission and board of directors, and a related political action committee.
The organization is a member of the Equality Federation.[tpl]cite web | url=http://equalityfederation.org/members | title=Member Organizations | work=Equality Federation | accessdate=January 14, 2014[/tpl]
