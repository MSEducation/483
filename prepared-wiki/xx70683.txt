William Archibald Spooner (22 July 1844 – 29 August 1930) was a famous Oxford don whose name is given to the linguistic phenomenon of spoonerism.

==Biography==

Spooner was born at 17 Chapel Street, Grosvenor Place, London, SW1. He was educated at Oswestry School (where he was a contemporary of Frederick Gustavus Burnaby) and New College, Oxford, where he was the first non-Wykehamist to become an undergraduate. He was ordained deacon in the Church of England in 1872 and priest in 1875. He had five children, William Wycliffe, Frances Catherine, Rosemary, Ellen Maxwell and Agnes Mary.
He remained at New College for more than sixty years, serving as Fellow (1867), Lecturer (1868), Tutor (1869), Dean (1876–1889), and Warden (1903–1924). He lectured on ancient history, divinity, and philosophy (especially on Aristotle's ethics).
Spooner was well liked and respected, described as "an albino, small, with a pink face, poor eyesight, and a head too large for his body". It was said that "his reputation was that of a genial, kindly, hospitable man."Reader's Digest (February 1995)
In the opinion of Roy Harrod, William Spooner exceeded all the heads of Oxford and Cambridge colleges he had known "having regard to his scholarship, devotion to duty, and wisdom."Hayter, W. (1977). Spooner: A biography. London: W.H. Allen. (See page 135)

==Spoonerisms==

Spooner has become famous for his (real or alleged) "spoonerisms", plays on words in which corresponding consonants, vowels, or morphemes are switched. Few, if any, of his own spoonerisms were deliberate, and many of those attributed to him are apocryphal.
The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations (3rd edition, 1979) lists only one substantiated Spoonerism – "The weight of rages will press hard upon the employer". Spooner himself admitted to uttering "Kinkering Congs Their Titles Take" in a 1930 interview.Fun-With-Words History Spooner is said to have disliked the reputation gained for getting his words muddled.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]
After the concept of Spoonerisms became popularized, Spooner denounced a crowd that had gathered to hear him speak by saying, "You haven't come for my lecture, you just want to hear one of those...things."
Spooner is supposed to have committed other absent-minded gaffes. He was said to have invited a don to tea, "to welcome Stanley Casson, our new archaeology Fellow". "But, sir," the man replied, "I am Stanley Casson". "Never mind," Spooner said, "Come all the same."Reader's Digest (February 1995); John Hanbury Angus Sparrow, Words on the Air, "Memory".
At a party in North Oxfordshire his wife sustained a cut on her finger.  When concerned friends asked him "Did she lose her finger permanently?", he is supposed to have answered "She lost her finger permanently, for a time."[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]
One recorded incident had Spooner write a note asking for a fellow lecturer at New College to see him immediately about a matter. The note had a postscript informing the lecturer that the matter had been resolved and he no longer needed to see him.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]
Another story tells of Spooner preaching a sermon about St. Paul, but substituted the name Aristotle for St. Paul.  When he finished, he came down from the pulpit, paused, went back up, and told his bewildered congregation, "Did I say Aristotle? I meant St. Paul."[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]  Some versions of this story have Spooner substituting Aristotle for Aquinas.
It is said that Canon Spooner not only mixed up words, but entire concepts upon occasion. Reportedly, he once spilled salt at a dinner and absentmindedly poured some wine on it, a reversal of the usual procedure.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl] According to sources, he once remarked of a widow that "her husband was eaten by missionaries."
He was once found by an undergraduate attempting to inflate a flat tire on his bicycle. However he was attempting to inflate the inflated tire and not the flat one.  Taxed, he apparently exclaimed "Do they not communicate?".
His attitude towards his unintentional fame softened in his final years, even granting the occasional reprint for humour's sake, regardless of validity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2009[/tpl]
On his death, the Times recorded that, "He was not afraid of conversation."J.A.Gere and John Sparrow (ed.), Geoffrey Madan's Notebooks, Oxford University Press, 1981
