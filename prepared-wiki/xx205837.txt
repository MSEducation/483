CATEGORIES: BBC music, BBC Radio

BBC Introducing is the brand for new music programmes across the BBC radio stations, showcasing unsigned, self signed and other emerging musical talent primarily from the UK. Launched in 2007 the Introducing brand brings programming from across the BBC under a unified brand with each show retaining its own identity. Introducing has also been extended to the BBC's stages at major festivals such as Glastonbury. Introducing shows can now be found on most BBC Radio stations from national to local. In 2010 BBC Introducing was awarded the best new platform to discover music at the BT Digital Music Awards.[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] In May 2011, BBC Introducing won the Gold award for Best Use of Multiplatform at the Sony Radio Academy Awards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.radioawards.org/Nominees/index.cfm?nominees_year=2011&winners_award_group_id=4&winners_award_category_id=29 |title=The Sony Radio Academy Awards |publisher=Radioawards.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-12[/tpl]

==History==

The initial idea was to introduce a BBC new music discovery proposition consistent across all local and network radio.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] BBC Introducing was created and selected as the  brand name by Jason Carter, the former Head Of Live Music at Radio 1, he continues to lead the proposition for the BBC. The creation followed research via a pan BBC music steering group.  It was developed as a property that could be added to existing show names, or used as a signpost for features within programming.
BBC Introducing was launched in 2007, and by this period  many BBC local radio stations had launched a weekly local music show to share and champion local bands. As shows such as The Box Office on BBC Three Counties Radio, The Download on BBC Radio Oxford, The Friday Session on BBC Hereford and Worcester, Raw Talent on BBC Radio Humberside and The Weekender on BBC Radio Nottingham proved popular there was interest in developing a more coherent structure and brand for new music on the BBC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/introducing/shows/#regional_shows |title=Music - Introducing - Radio Shows and Podcasts |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2011-08-12| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110723142110/http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/introducing/shows/| archivedate= 23 July 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
In September 2010 all BBC local radio shows that had not renamed themselves as part of the 'Introducing' were re-branded.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/09_september/29/introducing.shtml |title=Press Office - BBC Local Radio rebrands BBC Introducing shows |publisher=BBC |date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2011-08-12[/tpl]

==Festival stages==

BBC Introducing has hosted a stage at Glastonbury Festival every year since 2007.  The 2011 incarnation featured Ed Sheeran, F-Block, The Good Natured, Sharks Took the Rest, Vessels and Shammi Pithia, amongst others.
BBC Introducing has also hosted stages at the Reading and Leeds festivals since 2008, Radio 1's Big Weekend since 2008 and T in the Park since 2009.http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p010j8y5/profiles/festivals

==A national network==

With most BBC Local Radio stations now featuring an Introducing show, the music team at BBC Radio 1 are seeking to make use of the local knowledge available across the corporation. In essence the national station has access to local experts across the country who are able to act as a filter and recommend artists for national attention. For big events, such as the BBC Introducing stage at the Glastonbury festival, local show producers submit acts for consideration to a central panel.[tpl]cite web|last=McCormick |first=Neil |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/culture/neilmccormick/100001961/bbc-introducing-tomorrows-stars-today |title=BBC Introducing: tomorrow's stars today – Telegraph Blogs |publisher=Blogs.telegraph.co.uk |date=2009-07-30 |accessdate=2011-08-12[/tpl]

==Upload tool==

During February 2009, an upload tool was launched on the BBC Introducing website to allow users to upload their music direct to BBC Introducing producers and presenters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/04_april/22/introducing.shtml |title=Press Office - BBC Introducing uploader reaches 20,000 unique artists |publisher=BBC |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2011-08-12[/tpl] Artists/bands enter their postcode at the point of registering and notifications about any songs they upload are sent to BBC staff working on their nearest Introducing radio show, as well as their choice of national show on BBC Radio 1, BBC 6 Music, BBC Radio 1Xtra or BBC Asian Network.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/introducing/faq/#what |title=Music - Introducing - Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2011-08-12[/tpl]

The upload tool was the subject of a complaint to the BBC Trust from a commercial organisation Amazing Tunes that had launched a similar service in 2005. Amazing Tunes provides the musical content for a UK national digital radio station, Amazing Radio. The complaint described the BBC upload mechanism as "to all intents and purposes a direct copy of our privately funded concept". The BBC disputed this description, but advised artists to "explore all the avenues open to them."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/nov/09/amazing-radio-bbc|title=Amazing Radio complains about BBC service 'copying our concept'|date=2009-11-09|accessdate=2009-11-25|publisher=The Guardian | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091112093223/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/nov/09/amazing-radio-bbc| archivedate= 12 November 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
