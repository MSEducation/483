Beats Electronics, LLC is an American producer of audio products and equipment headquartered in Santa Monica, California. The company was founded by rapper and hip-hop producer Andre "Dr. Dre" Young and Interscope-Geffen-A&M Records chairman Jimmy Iovine and primarily produces products under the brand "Beats by Dr. Dre". The company has also licensed audio technology to other companies for use in their own products, and also acquired MOG in 2012 to expand into the online music market.
From 2009 to 2012, its products were exclusively manufactured by the consumer electronics company Monster Cable. Following the expiration of its contract, Beats began to self-manufacture its products.

==History==

The company was formally established in 2008,http://th.beatsbydre.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-beats-Intl-Site/th_TH/CustomerService-Company beatsbydre.com About us section. Retrieved 2013-12-26) and debuted its first product, Beats by Dr. Dre Studio headphones, in late 2008. Monster Cable was granted exclusive rights under a 5-year contract to manufacture and develop the first Beats-branded products. To promote its products, Beats primarily relied on endorsements by pop and hip-hop music performers, product placement within music videos, and partnering with musicians and other celebrities to develop co-branded products.[tpl]cite news |title=Beats Electronics Is Breaking Up with Monster |author=Cliff Edwards |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/beats-electronics-is-breaking-up-with-monster-01122012.html?campaign_id=rss_null |newspaper=Business Week |date=January 12, 2012 |accessdate=13 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=From Lemmy to Snooki, celebs are desperate to sell you headphones|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20970495|work=BBC|accessdate=27 August 2013|date=10 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=How Dr. Dre Made $300 Headphones a Must-Have Accessory|url=http://business.time.com/2013/01/16/how-dr-dre-made-300-headphones-a-must-have-accessory/|work=Time|accessdate=27 August 2013|date=16 January 2013[/tpl]
In August 2011, mobile phone manufacturer HTC acquired a 50.1% majority share in Beats for $309 million. The purchase was intended to allow HTC to compete with other cellphone makers by associating themselves with the Beats brand, as the purchase also granted HTC exclusive rights to manufacture smartphones with Beats-branded audio systems.[tpl]cite web|last=Sandoval|first=Greg|title=HTC to acquire majority stake in Dr. Dre's Beats|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-20090967-261/htc-to-acquire-majority-stake-in-dr-dres-beats/|publisher=CNET|accessdate=20 March 2012[/tpl] Despite its majority acquisition, HTC would still allow Beats to operate as an autonomous company.
On January 12, 2012, BusinessWeek reported that Beats and Monster would not renew their production contract and would be ending their partnership by the end of 2012. As a result, Beats took its manufacturing operations in-house, and aimed to double its workforce to around 300 employees. Monster would ultimately begin marketing its own competing line of premium headphones aimed towards an older demographic. In October 2012, Beats unveiled its first two self-developed products; Iovine believed that the company would now have to "control its own destiny" in order to continue its growth. Iovine also commented on how other headphone makers had attempted to emulate Beats' business model of celebrity endorsements (including Monster themselves, who unveiled Earth, Wind and Fire and Miles Davis-themed headphones at that year's Consumer Electronics Show), stating that "some of our competitors are cheap engineers who have never been to a recording studio. You can't just stick someone's name on a headphone that doesn't know anything about sound."[tpl]cite web|title=Jimmy Iovine on Beats by Dre Parting With Monster: 'We Have to Control Our Own Destiny'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/511582/jimmy-iovine-on-beats-by-dre-parting-with-monster-we-have-to-control-our-own|work=Billboard|accessdate=27 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Beats By Dre Debuts First Post-Monster Cable Products|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1083371/beats-by-dre-debuts-first-post-monster-cable-products|work=Billboard|accessdate=27 August 2013[/tpl]

==Products==

===Personal audio===

Beats' original product line were Beats by Dr. Dre headphones. In promotional materials, Dr. Dre outlined the line's advantages by alleging that listeners were not able to hear "all" of the music with most headphones, and that Beats would allow people to "hear what the artists hear, and listen to the music the way they should: the way I do." In comparison to most headphones, Beats products were characterized by an emphasis towards producing larger amounts of bass, and are particularly optimized towards hip-hop and pop music.[tpl]cite web|title=Are Beats by Dr. Dre headphones worth the money?|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2013/05/are-beats-by-dr-dre-headphones-worth-the-money/index.htm|publisher=Consumer Reports|accessdate=29 November 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=How Beats by Dre knocked out better headphones|url=http://www.theage.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/how-beats-by-dre-knocked-out-better-headphones-20130913-2tola.html|work=The Age|accessdate=29 November 2013|location=Melbourne[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Evans|first=Joel|title=Review: Beats by Dr. Dre headphones|url=http://www.geek.com/articles/gadgets/review-beats-by-dr-dre-headphones-20080730/|publisher=Geek.com|accessdate=23 May 2012[/tpl] In October 2012, Beats unveiled its first two self-developed products, the Beats Executive noise-cancelling headphones (to compete with similar offerings by Bose and Sennheiser) and the Beats Pill portable speaker.

===BeatsAudio===

The company has also licensed the Beats brand, under the name Beats Audio, and technology to other manufacturers. In 2011, HP began to offer personal computers equipped with Beats Audio systems. The system features a software equalizer with a preset that HP marketed as being optimized for higher quality sound output.[tpl]cite web |title=HP Envy 14: Plenty of Power in a Stylish Package |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/203364/hp_envy_14_plenty_of_power_in_a_stylish_package.html |publisher=PC World |accessdate=2012-03-20[/tpl]  Originally reserved for its premium Envy line of laptops, HP now offers the system in nearly all of its consumer-oriented personal computers.
Following its acquisition of a stake in the company, most new HTC smartphones began to be released with Beats Audio software, beginning with the HTC Sensation XE/XL with Beats Audio in September 2011.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/14/htc-sensation-xe-gets-official-packing-1-5ghz-dual-core-cpu-and |title=HTC Sensation XE gets official, packing 1.5GHz dual-core CPU and Beats Audio |author=Amar Toor |date=September 14, 2011 |publisher=Engadget |accessdate=January 13, 2012[/tpl] The software was to be included in most new HTC devices, such as the One series.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2400755,00.asp |title=Hands On With the HTC One X, S, and One V |publisher=PC Magazine |date=February 26, 2012 |accessdate=February 26, 2012 |author=Segan, Sascha[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/19/htc-8x-windows-phon |title=HTC Officially Reveals The 8X: 4.3-Inch 720p Display, 1.5GHz Dual-Core Processor, Beats Audio |publisher=TechCrunch |date=September 19, 2012 |accessdate=September 19, 2012 |author=Velazco, Chris[/tpl] The Sensation XE and Rezound were also bundled with Beats by Dre earbuds, but HTC abandoned the practice on future devices. An HTC product executive claimed that despite the prominence of the Beats brand, "an accessory like the headphone doesn't factor in when someone is buying a smartphone."[tpl]cite web|title=More HTC handsets with Beats headphones?

In 2011, Beats reached a deal with Chrysler LLC to feature Beats-branded audio systems in its vehicles. The first vehicle under the partnership was its 2012 Chrysler 300S luxury vehicle, which included a 10-speaker Beats by Dr. Dre sound-system.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/worldviews/2012/02/27/meet-the-boss-behind-chryslers-image-makeover-he-is-french/|title=Meet The Boss Behind Chrysler's Image Makeover; He Is French |publisher=Forbes|accessdate=2012-03-20 |first=Nicole |last=Kekeh[/tpl] BeatsAudio also may incorporate their speakers into Fiat and Dodge cars.

===Beats Music===

On July 2, 2012, Beats announced it had acquired the online music service MOG, in a purchase reported to have been between $10 million to $16 million. Beats stated that the acquisition was part of the company's goal to develop a "truly end-to-end music experience." The acquisition did not include the company's blog and advertising network, the MOG Music Network,[tpl]cite news|title=Beats Electronics acquires MOG music service|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/technologylive/post/2012/07/beats-electronics-accquires-mog-music-service/1|accessdate=13 October 2012|newspaper=USA Today|date=2 July 2012|author=Mike Snider[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Beats Electronics Acquires Mog Rapper Dr. Dre's headphone makers scoop up digital streaming service|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/beats-electronics-acquires-mog-141575|work=Adweek|publisher=Adweek|accessdate=13 October 2012|author=Charlie Warzel|date=2 July 2012[/tpl] which was sold in a separate transaction to the broadcasting company Townsquare Media in August 2012.[tpl]cite web|title=Remaining half of Mog Music Network sells to Townsquare Media Group|url=http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/remaining-half-of-mog-music-network-sells-to-townsquare-media-group/051510|work=MusicWeek|publisher=Intent Media|accessdate=13 October 2012|author=Rhian Jones|date=24 August 2012[/tpl]
While MOG indicated that it would continue to operate independently with no immediate change in service, Beats subsequently announced a new, subscription-based online music service known as Beats Music, which launched in January 2014. In comparison to its competitors, such as Spotify and Google Play Music, the service emphasizes recommendations by music professionals alongside algorithmic recommendations.[tpl]cite web|title=Beats Music Beefs Up Curation Team, Says Service Is 'Coming Soon'|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/5645363/beats-music-beefs-up-curation-team-says-service-is|work=Billboard.biz|accessdate=27 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Beats Music arrives January 21st, family plan exclusive to AT&T customers|url=http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/11/5298562/beats-music-arrives-january-21st-family-plan-exclusive-to-at-t|work=The Verge|accessdate=12 January 2014[/tpl]
