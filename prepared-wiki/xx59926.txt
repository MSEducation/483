==History==

===1969 to 1987: Early years===

Samsung Electric Industries was established as an industry Samsung Group in 1969 in Suwon, South Korea.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/corporateprofile/history06.html|title=History – Corporate Profile – About Samsung – Samsung| publisher =Samsung|accessdate=10 July 2011[/tpl] Its early products were electronic and electrical appliances including televisions, calculators, refrigerators, air conditioners and washing machines. In 1970, Samsung Group established another subsidiary, Samsung-NEC, jointly with Japan's NEC Corporation to manufacture home appliances and audiovisual devices. In 1974, the group expanded into the semiconductor business by acquiring Korea Semiconductor, one of the first chip-making facilities in the country at the time. The acquisition of Korea Telecommunications, an electronic switching system producer, was completed at the start of the next decade in 1980.
By 1981, Samsung Electric Industries had manufactured over 10 million black-and-white televisions. In February 1983, Samsung's founder, Lee Byung-chull, made an announcement later dubbed the "Tokyo declaration", in which he declared that Samsung intended to become a DRAM (dynamic random access memory) vendor. One year later, Samsung became the third company in the world to develop a 64kb DRAM.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] In 1988, Samsung Electric Industries merged with Samsung Semiconductor & Communications to form Samsung Electronics.

===1988–1995: Consumer struggles===

Samsung Electronics launched its first mobile phone in 1988, in the South Korean market.[tpl]cite book |title=Samsung Electronics: And the Struggle For Leadership of the Electronics Industry|first1=Tony|last1=Michell|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2010 |isbn=978-0-470-82266-1 |page=153|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vgZim29J3awC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Samsung+Electronics:+And+the+Struggle+For+Leadership+of+the+Electronics+Industry+AuthorIty+Michell&source=bl&ots=KQmkVB2Lw9&sig=5BtGpchoAJ9-0RJwUYRwBQAiEBU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SARJUIGOK8Kk0QWFqYGYBg&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Samsung%20Electronics%3A%20And%20the%20Struggle%20For%20Leadership%20of%20the%20Electronics%20Industry%20AuthorIty%20Michell&f=false[/tpl] Sales were initially poor and by the early 1990s Motorola held a market share of over 60 percent in the country's mobile phone market compared to just 10 percent for Samsung. Samsung's mobile phone division also struggled with poor quality and inferior products until the mid-1990s and exit from the sector was a frequent topic of discussion within the company.
Samsung Electronics acquired a 40 percent stake in AST Research, a United States-based personal computer maker, for US$378 million in February 1995.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/21/business/international-business-koreans-seen-buying-more-us-concerns.html|title=Koreans Seen Buying More U.S. Concerns|accessdate=6 September 2012|publisher=The New York Times|date=21 July 1995[/tpl]

===1995–2008: Component manufacturing===

It was decided by Lee Kun-Hee that Samsung needed to change strategy. The company shelved the production of many under-selling product lines and instead pursued a process of designing and manufacturing components and investing in new technologies for other companies. In addition, Samsung outlined a 10-year plan to shrug off its image as a "budget brand" and to challenge Sony as the world's largest consumer electronics manufacturer. It was hoped in this way Samsung would gain an understanding of how products are made and give a technological lead sometime in the future. This patient vertical integration strategy of manufacturing components has born fruit for Samsung in the late-2000s.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2009/11/moto_droid_off.html |title=Moto Droid off to a Good Start.

As Samsung shifted away from consumer markets, the company devised a plan to sponsor major sporting events to remain in the public eye. One such sponsorship was for the 1998 Winter Olympics held in Nagano, Japan.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/161740/samsung-extends-sponsorship-of-olympic-games-until-2016|title= Samsung Extends Sponsorship of Olympic Games until 2016 |date=24 April 2007 |publisher = Sportbusiness [/tpl]
As a chaebol, Samsung Group wielded wealth that allowed the company to invest and develop new technology rather than build products at a level which would not have a detrimental impact on Samsung's finances.[tpl]cite news |title=Samsung: The next big bet |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21530976 |date=1 October 2011 |accessdate=2013-05-09[/tpl]
Samsung had a number of technological breakthroughs particularly in the field of memory which are commonplace in most electrical products today. This includes the world's first 64Mb DRAM in 1992, 256 Mb DRAM in 1994, 1Gb DRAM in 1996.[tpl]cite web |title=Samsung – Company History – 1992–1996 |url=http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/corporateprofile/history02.html |work=Samsung[/tpl] In 2004, Samsung developed the world's first 8Gb NAND Memory chip and a manufacturing deal was struck with Apple in 2005. A deal to supply Apple for memory chips was sealed in 2005 and, as of October 2013, Samsung remains a key supplier of Apple components, manufacturing the A7 processors that are inside the iPhone 5s model.[tpl]cite web |title=Apple supplier Samsung's rise is Steve Jobs' worst nightmare come true |url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/apple-supplier-samsungs-rise-is-steve-jobs-worst-nightmare-come-true-328947 |work=gadgets.ndtv.com |date=10 February 2013 |accessdate=2013-05-09[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Samsung’s Record Pressures Rivals as HTC Posts Loss|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-03/samsung-profit-beats-estimates-on-cheaper-galaxy-smartphones.html|accessdate=5 October 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=4 October 2013|author=Jungah Lee|author2=Lulu Yilun Chen[/tpl]

Despite consistent growth, Samsung, along with its chairman Lee Kun-hee, has developed a reputation for insecurity regarding its financial stability and the potential for future crises to arise. After returning from a temporary retirement period in March 2010, Kun-hee stated that "Samsung Electronics' future is not guaranteed because most of our flagship products will be obsolete in 10 years from now."[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/worldbiz/archives/2010/03/25/2003468850|title= Lee Kun-hee Returns to Samsung |date=25 March 2010 |work= Taipei Times[/tpl]
