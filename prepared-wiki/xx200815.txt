 During the late 60s and early 70s the station aired a TOP-40 format under the callsign WTXL.  Although it was programmed very well, it never achieved rating success due to the heavy competition from crosstown WHYN 560.
Later, the station tried the NBC all-news radio format under the callsign WNUS.
The station was assigned the WACM call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on September 15, 1983.[tpl]cite web |title=Call Sign History |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=60390&Callsign=WACM |work=FCC Media Bureau CDBS Public Access Database[/tpl]
