[[Geek Code]]

CATEGORIES: Internet self-classification codes, Internet culture

The Geek Code is a series of letters and symbols used by self-described "geeks" to inform fellow geeks about their personality, appearance, interests, skills, and opinions. The idea is that everything that makes a geek individual and different from all the other geeks in the world can be written down (encoded) in this very compact format. Then other geeks can read the geek code and work back from that to discover what the writer looks like, what interests they have, and so forth. This is deemed to be efficient in some sufficiently geeky manner.[tpl]citation |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Mgw7-M7t63MC |pages=10–20 | title=The cultures of computing |author=Susan Leigh Star |year=1995[/tpl]
Once created, geeks can use their geek codes anywhere they please. Geek codes are known to be used on emails, Usenet posts, websites, letters, art, programming language comments, and even T-shirts. Nowadays[tpl]when|date=August 2013[/tpl], personal websites are the most common area[tpl]cn|date=August 2013[/tpl], particularly "about me" sections.

==History==

The Geek Code was invented by Robert A. Hayden in 1993 and is defined at geekcode.com.geekcode.com This concept is used in many other occupations and groups such as goths (Goth Code) and even the Schlock Mercenary webcomic.
A few years before the Geek Code was published, similar codes existed for other purposes. The Natural Bears Classification System, first documented in 1989, is a similar code for the bear subculture. Like the Geek Code, it generally uses a single letter for the attribute and + or − signs for the grade. It was inspired by the Yerkes spectral classification system for describing stars. Unlike the Geek Code, the Yerkes system uses classes, subclasses and peculiarities for categorization. These systems differ in their orthogonality: the Geek Code is very orthogonal in the computer science sense (where variables may be projected onto basis vectors), where the Yerkes system is very orthogonal in the taxonomic sense (represent mutually exclusive classes).
In some parts of the net, it was once common practice to use a geek code as one's email or Usenet signature. One of the consequences of being so old in such a fast-moving field is that much of the geek code now looks rather dated, with the World Wide Web being described as "relatively new and little understood".
Hayden's own geek code is:
