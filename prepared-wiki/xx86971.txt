Barbara Berjer (June 12, 1920 — October 20, 2002) was a well-known American television actress born in Seattle, Washington.
Among her many soap opera credits were her roles as alcoholic actress Lynn Franklin on From These Roots (1958–1961); Claire English Lowell Cassen Shea #4 on As the World Turns (1965–1971); Barbara Norris Thorpe #2 on Guiding Light (1971–1981; she reprised the role for a few episodes in 1989 and on a recurring basis from 1995–1996); and Scottish nanny Bridget Connell on Another World (1985–1996).  Berjer is one of the few actors in daytime history to be featured on two soaps at the same time ("Guiding Light" and "Another World", both Procter & Gamble-owned shows).
She was born as Barbara Berger, but as her surname was so often mispronounced as "burger", she changed it to "Berjer", which is how it is pronounced phonetically. [tpl]citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]
At the time of her death, in 2002 in New York City, she was ill with pneumonia.
