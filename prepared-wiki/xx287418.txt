The 1878 Invercargill by-election was a by-election during the 6th New Zealand Parliament in the Southland electorate of Invercargill. The by-election occurred following the resignation of MP George Lumsden and was won by Henry Feldwick.

==Background==

George Lumsden, who was first elected to represent Invercargill in the 1875 election, resigned in 1878. This triggered the Invercargill by-election, which was held on 17 July 1878. Two independent candidates contested the election, Henry Feldwick and James Walker Bain. Feldwick obtained 51.22% of the votes and was successful.
