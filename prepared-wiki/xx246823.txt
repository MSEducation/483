Kajal born as Sunita Kulkarni in a middle class Marathi family [tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] was chosen by Nasir Hussain to play the lead in his romantic comedy Hum Kisise Kum Naheen (1977). The movie turned out to be one of the biggest successes of that year but it did not help boost Kajal's career. Though she was paired opposite Rishi Kapoor her pairing with him did not work out as they were not cast opposite each other again.
She was seen as Mithun Chakraborty's heroine in Wardaat & Humse Badhkar Kaun which were declared hits at the box office.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] In spite of the success of her films she never managed to reach the height of successful heroines of her time. She was seen in Ramsay Brothers Horror Films like Saboot, Dahshat, Haveli & Saaya. She was also paired opposite Mohanlal in the Malayalam film Uyarangalil and with Mammootty in the film Ee Lokam Evide Kure Manushyar. She did item songs and supporting roles in the late 80's.
