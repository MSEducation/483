[[Air Force Space Surveillance System]]

CATEGORIES: Radar networks

The Air Force Space Surveillance System, colloquially known as the Space Fence, was[tpl]when|date=September 2013[/tpl] a U.S. government multistatic radar system built to detect orbital objects passing over America.  It is a component of the US space surveillance network, and was claimed[tpl]by whom|date=September 2013[/tpl] to be able to detect objects as small as 10 cm (four inches) at heights up to 30,000 km (15,000 nautical miles.)[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl]
The system ceased operation in September 2013.
The operation's headquarters are at Dahlgren, Virginia, and radar stations are spread out across the continental United States at roughly the level of the 33rd parallel north.

==Description==

There are three transmitter sites in the system:47CFR§2.106 Footnote US229. Accessed May 24, 2006.
The master transmitter at Lake Kickapoo is said to be the most powerful continuous wave (CW) station in the world, at 768 kW radiated power on 216.97927 MHz.
When the system became operational in 1961, the original frequency was 108.50 MHz (just above the FM broadcast band). In 1965 the "Fence" system was modernized with the operating frequency doubled to 216.98 MHz (just above Channel 13 in the VHF TV broadcast band) to obtain higher resolution and to locate smaller objects. This frequency was used until the Fence was decommissioned in 2013. Fill-in transmitter sites at Gila River and Jordan Lake used offset frequencies listed above from the early 1990s to 2013 to help better detect which transmitter "illuminated" an object in space, as multiple transmitters could have illuminated the same object at the same time. Overhead imagery (see coordinates given above) of the Gila River and Jordan Lake sites shows the original design at the lower frequency.
There were six receiving stations:
The following receiving stations were placed in cold storage in April 2013:
The receiving stations at Elephant Butte and Hawkinsville were considered to be "High Altitude" stations with longer and more complex antenna systems that are designed to see targets at higher altitudes than the other four receiving stations.

==History==

Author Curtis Peebles notes that the original Space Fence or Space Surveillance System began operations in 1959.[tpl]cite book|author=Curtis Peebles|title=High Frontier: The U.S. Air Force and the Military Space Program|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cMgdYypcPc8C&pg=PA39|date=1 June 1997|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-0-7881-4800-2|pages=39–[/tpl] The system predated the formation of NORAD and was known as the U.S. Navy Space Surveillance System or SPASUR but also as NAVSPASUR (Naval Space Surveillance System).US Naval Space Command Space Surveillance System. From 1960 until the early 1990's the system was used in conjunction with a network of with Baker-Nunn cameras that could see "an object the size of a basketball at 25,000 miles."Hill AFB Repairs Cameras that Spy on Satellites The Desert News,  March 23, 1977, page 2D.  Although formerly operated by the U.S. Navy for NORAD from 1961 until October 2004,  command passed to the Air Force 20th Space Control Squadron on October 1, 2004.Navy newsstand.

In 2009, the operations and maintenance contract for the day-to-day management and operation of the Fence was awarded to Five Rivers Services, LLC, based out of Colorado Springs, Colorado. On September 30, 2011, Five Rivers Services was awarded a $7,022,503 firm fixed price with cost reimbursable line items contract modification to manage, operate, maintain, and logistically support the nine Air Force Space Surveillance System field stations, presumably for Fiscal Year 2012.http://www.defense.gov/contracts/contract.aspx?contractid=4634

===Plans for system upgrade: 2009-2012===

The 850th Electronic Systems Group, Electronic Systems Center awarded 3 $30-million contracts to Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon on 11 June 2009.USAF News http://archive.is/20120719190145/http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123161377
The Space Fence is envisaged to be a system of two or three S-band ground-based radars designed to perform uncued detection, tracking and accurate measurement of orbiting space objects. The Space Fence is intended to replace the Air Force Space Surveillance System, or VHF Fence, that was transferred from the Navy to the Air Force in 2004. The shorter wavelength of the S-band Space Fence allows for detection of much smaller satellites and debris.
The February 10, 2009, collision of a U.S. Iridium communications satellite (Iridium 33) and a Russian Cosmos 2251 communications satellite, which added hundreds more pieces of debris to the atmosphere, highlighted the need for more precise tracking of space objects.Aviation News - Collision http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/COLLIDE021109.xml&headline=Orbital%20Collision%20Was%20The%20Worst%20Ever&channel=space&gclid=CI7MrZu22JgCFQUWGgodnSEscw
Data collected from the Space Fence's sensors would potentially feed into the Joint Space Operations Center Mission System, which is used to track objects orbiting the Earth, monitor space weather and assess foreign launches. Used by operators at the 614th Air and Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., the 614 AOC's 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week support provides vigilance of global and theater operations and equips the Joint Functional Component Command for space operations with the tools to conduct command and control of space forces.
Plans to award the final contract have been stalled by U.S. budget sequestration in early 2013"Budget Cuts Threaten The Air Force's New 'Space Fence'" and the AFSSS system is likely to be discontinued in October 2013 due to budget cuts.http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/466832/air-force-space-command-to-discontinue-space-surveillance-system.aspx

===2013 Shutdown===
