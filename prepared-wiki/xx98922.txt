Freaked Out and Small is the fourth album by The Presidents of the United States of America. It was released in 2000 by MUSICBLITZ Records, which was a web based label. Copies of the album distributed through MUSICBLITZ included in the liner notes a special thanks to anyone who pre-ordered it from the MUSICBLITZ website. These fans are listed individually, by name.
An interesting note about this album is that all of the songs were played with normal guitars and bass guitars. This is different from all of the other albums by the band, as they usually played with guitbasses and basitars, which were guitars with fewer strings that were tuned differently than usual.
This album was re-released in 2004 on the band's own label, PUSA Inc. with bonus tracks that included 8 of the 12 songs on the album, as well as 2 other songs, as Chris Ballew originally recorded them between 1989 and 1996.
