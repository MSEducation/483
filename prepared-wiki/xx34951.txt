Tarlo River is a national park in New South Wales (Australia), 134Â km southwest of Sydney. Created in 1982, it contains a rugged, unusual landscape not found elsewhere in the region. Vehicular access is limited to a short stretch of Towrang Road that crosses its southern edge near the locality of Greenwich Park; the rest of the park is surrounded by private properties.
