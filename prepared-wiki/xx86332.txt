==Early life==

Lamas-Craig was born in Santa Monica, California, the son of Argentine actor Fernando Lamas and Norwegian-American actress Arlene Dahl. He is the stepson of swimming film star Esther Williams, who married his father when Lorenzo was 11 years old. Williams was also the best friend of Jane Wyman, who would later play along with Lamas-Craig on Falcon Crest. Lamas-Craig was brought up in Pacific Palisades, California, and moved to New York City in 1971, when he was 13 years old. He graduated from the Admiral Farragut Academy in Pine Beach, New Jersey, in 1975.

==Acting career==

Longing to be an actor since the age of five, Lamas first studied acting in Tony Barr's Film Actors Workshop and quickly thereafter obtained his first TV acting role in 1976. He had a supporting role in the 1978 film Grease. Early in his career, he also had guest-starring parts in Switch, Sword of Justice, Dear Detective, Secrets of Midland Heights, Fantasy Island, The Love Boat and Hotel. Before all that, growing up as a teenager, he was also a fan of all the Jack Webb's TV shows, Dragnet, Adam-12 and Emergency!, though he did not guest-star, off-set, he would visit the set, and became acquainted with series' leads, Julie London (who was married to Webb earlier) and her second husband Bobby Troup.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
In 1980, Lamas auditioned for and won the role of Jane Wyman's playboy grandson and henchman, Lance Cumson, for the pilot of a new series entitled The Vintage Years. The pilot was later retooled to become the hit prime time drama series Falcon Crest. During a 2006 TV interview with a Norwegian television team, Lamas said that to get the role on Falcon Crest, he had auditioned twice and beat out five other guys for the part. During his stint on Falcon Crest, Lamas was nominated for two Soap Opera Digest Awards and a Golden Globe Award. Lamas was the only actor to appear in all 227 episodes of the series. In an interview, Lamas said that Jane Wyman's persona was more of a hard-working legend, not a diva, who referred to her as a friendly woman on Falcon Crest: "With Jane, she expected you to know your lines, but she played poker with the crew at lunch. She was just a great gal; and I think that set the tone for the rest of us. She wasn't a 'spoiled diva,' and believe me, if anybody had a right to be a 'spoiled diva,' it was Jane because she has done so much, Oscar Award-winner, I mean, incredible actress, and she was just like clockwork, right there on time, always knew her lines, always ready to rehearse and she had this great affable quality. You just never talked about Ronald Reagan, that's all, that was one thing we never did, everything else was opened." At the beginning of the ninth and final season of Falcon Crest, off-camera, Lamas received some devastating news about his TV grandmother when she was sent to the hospital that he paid visit to see her to offer her some words of comfort. After cancellation, he did not keep in touch with her for years; on September 10, 2007, he lost his TV grandmother and decades-long friend. Prior to Wyman's death, Lamas released a statement: "Next to my parents, Jane was the most influential person in my young career," he added, "She has left an incredible body of work and accomplishments that cannot go without being recognized and celebrated. I will miss her greatly."[tpl]cite web|author=Meredy |url=http://www.meredy.com/janewyman/janewymanobituary.htm |title='Johnny Belinda' Actress Jane Wyman Dies |publisher=Meredy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05[/tpl]
