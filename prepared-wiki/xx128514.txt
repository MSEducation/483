Saab Bofors Dynamics, located in Karlskoga and Link√∂ping, Sweden, is a subsidiary of Saab AB that specializes in military materiel such as missile systems and anti-tank systems. 
Its corporate heritage goes back to Bofors, which was founded in 1873. In 1999 Saab purchased the Celsius Group, the parent group of Bofors. In September 2000 United Defense Industries (UDI) purchased Bofors Weapon Systems from Saab (the tube artillery interests), while Saab retained the missile interests. 
The weapon systems include sensors based on radar, IR and laser.
Several public campaigns, including civil disobedience actions, have targeted production sites as a protest against Swedish arms export.
