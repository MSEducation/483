CATEGORIES: Government of feudal Japan, Officials of the Tokugawa shogunate

[tpl]nihongo|Kyoto ''machi-bugyō|京都町奉行|[/tpl] were officials of the Tokugawa shogunate in Edo period Japan.  Appointments to this prominent office were usually fudai daimyō, but this was amongst the senior administrative posts open to those who were not daimyō.Beasley, William G. (1955). Select Documents on Japanese Foreign Policy, 1853-1868,'' p. 325. Conventional interpretations have construed these Japanese titles as "commissioner" or "overseer" or "governor."
This bakufu title identifies a magistrate or municipal administrator with responsibility for governing and maintaining order in the shogunal city of Kyoto.Hall, John Wesley. (1955) Tanuma Okitsugu: Forerunner of Modern Japan, p. 201
The Kyoto machi-bugyo were the central public authorities in this significant urban center.  These men were bakufu-appointed officials fulfilling a unique role.  They were an amalgam of chief of police, judge, and mayor.  The machi-bugyo were expected to manage a full range of administrative and judicial responsibilities.Cunningham, Don. (2004). Taiho-Jutsu: Law and Order in the Age of the Samurai, p. 42.
Each machi-bugyo was involved in tax collection, policing, and firefighting; and at the same time, each played a number of judicial roles –- hearing and deciding both ordinary civil cases and criminal cases.
In this period, the machi-bugyo were considered equal in status to the minor daimyō.  At any one time, there were as many as 16 machi-bugyo located throughout Japan; and there was always at least one in Kyoto.

==Shogunal city==

During this period, Kyoto ranked with the largest urban centers, some of which were designated as a  "shogunal city."  The number of such cities rose from three to eleven under Tokugawa administration.Cullen, William. (2003). A History of Japan, 1582-1941: Internal and External Worlds, p. 159.
