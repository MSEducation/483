[[Language technology]]

CATEGORIES: Speech processing, Natural language processing

Language technology, often called human language technology (HLT), consists of natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics (CL) on the one hand, and speech technology on the other. It also includes many application oriented aspects of these.  Language technology is closely connected to computer science and general linguistics.
In 2013, the Globalization and Localization Association (GALA), released the independent platform LT Advisor for users to search for language technology and review translation tools. The platform was developed in collaboration with the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI).[tpl]cite web|last=Foster|first=Lauren|title=LT Advisor|url=http://www.multilingual.com/newsDetail.php?id=8758|work=MultiLingual Magazine|publisher=MultiLingual|accessdate=9 September 2013[/tpl]
