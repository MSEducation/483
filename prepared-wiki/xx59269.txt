Munich Airport [tpl]Airport codes|MUC|EDDM[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-de|Flughafen München[/tpl], [tpl]lang-bar|Flughofm Minga[/tpl]), is the international airport of Munich, the capital of the state of Bavaria in Germany. It is the second busiest airport in Germany in terms of passenger traffic behind Frankfurt Airport, and the seventh busiest airport in Europe, handling 38,360,604 passengers in 2012. It is the world's 12th busiest airport in terms of international passenger traffic,Airports Council International - Year to date International Passenger Traffic Data and was the 30th busiest airport worldwide in 2013.http://www.aci.aero/Data-Centre/Monthly-Traffic-Data/Passenger-Summary/Year-to-date Munich Airport serves as the secondary hub for Lufthansa including Lufthansa Regional and its Star Alliance partners besides Frankfurt. The biggest foreign carrier in Munich in terms of passenger numbers is Air Dolomiti.http://www.aero.de/news-18584/Groesste-internationale-Fluglinie-in-Muenchen.html
The airport is located [tpl]convert|28.5|km|abbr=on[/tpl] northeast of Munich near the old city of Freising and is named in memory of the former Bavarian Prime minister Franz Josef Strauss. The airport is located on the territory of four different municipalities: Oberding (location of the terminals; district of Erding), Hallbergmoos, Freising and Marzling (district of Freising).

==History==

From 1939 to 1992, Munich was served by Munich-Riem Airport. First plans to expand or build a new airport were made in 1954 (traffic flow-rate, population density in the proximity). The decision for building the new airport at Erdinger Moos was made on 5 August 1969 by the Bavarian government. When construction started on 3 November 1980, a village named Franzheim was demolished and their ~500 inhabitants were resettled.
The airport commenced operation on 17 May 1992, when operations moved from the former site at Munich-Riem Airport, which was closed shortly before midnight on the day before. As Lufthansa's home base at Frankfurt Airport had capacity limits, Lufthansa established a second hub offering connections through Munich as well as Frankfurt.
Between 1995 and 2006, passenger numbers doubled from under 15 million per annum to over 30 million, despite the impact of the 11 September attacks in 2001 and 2002. In 1996, the airport overtook Düsseldorf as Germany’s second busiest airport and currently handles almost twice as many passengers as the country’s third busiest airport.
In June 2003, Terminal 2 was finished, housing Star Alliance partners exclusively.
Due to the rapid increase in traffic Munich is currently slot constrained and a third runway is now being planned. Not uncommon for such a project, there is considerable opposition from the nearby residents. Lawsuits against the runway have already been announced.
The airport is named after Franz Josef Strauß, who played a prominent, albeit sometimes controversial role in politics of the Federal Republic of Germany from the 1950s until his death in 1988. Among other positions, Strauß was a long-time Minister-President (Governor) of the state of Bavaria, where the airport is located and was initiated under his government. Strauß, having been a private pilot himself, had a particular interest in the aviation industry. He is regarded one of the fathers of Airbus and served as initial chairman of its supervisory board.Company history on Airbus.com - Early days (1967-1969)
Naming the airport by its full name "Flughafen München Franz Josef Strauß" is fairly uncommon. The company that owns and operates the airport is named "Flughafen München GmbH" and brands itself as "M - Flughafen München" respectively "M - Munich Airport". In the Munich area, most people use the term "Flughafen München" (Munich Airport), sometimes "Flughafen München II" in order to distinguish from the earlier airport or simply "MUC" for its IATA-code.

==Terminals and facilities==

Most of the airport's facilities are located in the area between the two runways. The approach road and railway divide the west part into a southern half, which contains cargo and maintenance facilities, and a northern half, which contains mostly administrative buildings, a holiday long-term parking lot and the Visitors' Centre. It is followed by the west apron and Terminal 1, then the Munich Airport Center (MAC), Terminal 2 and the east apron.

===Terminal 1===

Terminal 1 is the older terminal and commenced operation when the airport was opened on 17 May 1992. It has a total capacity of 25 million passengers per year and is subdivided into five modules designated A, B, C, D and E. Modules A through D provide all facilities necessary to handle departures and arrivals, including individual landside driveways and parking, whereas module E is only equipped to handle arrivals. This design essentially makes each module a self-contained sub-terminal of its own. Modules A and D are used for flights within the Schengen-area, while modules B and C handle those to destinations outside of it. Hall F is separate, located near Terminal 2 and handles flights with increased security requirements, i.e. those to Israel. Furthermore, the checkin counters for some flights departing from Terminal 1 are located in the central area Z ([tpl]lang-de|Zentralbereich[/tpl]) where also most of the shopping and restaurant facilities of this Terminal as well as the airport's suburban railway station are located.
The [tpl]convert|1081|m|abbr=on[/tpl] pier features 21 jet bridges, two of which have been rebuilt into waiting halls for bus transfers. There are further 60 aircraft stands on the apron, some of which are equipped with specially-designed apron jet bridges ([tpl]lang-de|Vorfeldfluggastbrücken[/tpl]), to which passengers are brought by bus. This unique concept allows passengers to board with full protection from the weather but without the high investments required for full satellite terminals connected through a passenger transport system.
Terminal 1 currently handles all flights from airlines that are not members of Star Alliance. However, due to lack of capacity at Terminal 2, Lufthansa's subsidiary Germanwings and former affiliate Condor moved back to Terminal 1. Some of the major users at Terminal 1 are Air Berlin, Emirates, Air France, Delta Air Lines, British Airways, and easyJet.

===Terminal 2===

Terminal 2 commenced operation on 29 June 2003. It has a design capacity of 25 million passengers per year. However, having been designed as a hub terminal for Lufthansa and Star Alliance members, it is not divided into modules. Instead, all facilities are arranged around a central Plaza.
Due to security regulations imposed by the European Union, the terminal has been equipped with facilities to handle passengers from countries considered insecure, i.e. not implementing the same regulations. This required the construction of a new level as, unlike other airports, the terminal does not have separate areas for arriving and departing passengers. The new level 06 opened on 15 January 2009.
The pier, which is [tpl]convert|980|m|abbr=on[/tpl] long, is equipped with 24 jet bridges. As the total number of 75 aircraft stands on the east apron is not always sufficient, Terminal 2 sometimes also uses parking positions on the west apron, to which passengers are carried by airside buses.
Terminal 2 has two main departure level, 04 and 05 and additional bus gates on the lower level 03. Gates on level 05 (H) are designated non-Schengen gates. Until the new level 06 opened the northernmost gates were behind an additional security checkpoint for departures to the USA most of the day. The lower level 04 (G) contains Schengen gates. The bus gates on level 03, also designated G, are Schengen gates, too.
The terminal is operated by Terminal-2-Betriebsgesellschaft (German for Terminal 2 Operating Company), which is owned by Flughafen München GmbH (60%) and Lufthansa (40%). This makes Terminal 2 the first terminal in Germany which is co-operated by an airline.

====Terminal 2 extension====

Construction for the satellite building has started in 2012 and will be completed by 2015. This extension to Terminal 2 will see the baggage sorting hall on the east apron upgraded to become a satellite terminal. This will allow an additional 11 million passengers to be handled per year, adding 52 gates and 27 passenger air bridges. This plan was approved in December 2010. An expansion for the satellite building into a 'T' shape is also planned for the future along with another satellite and room for a possible 3rd Terminal to the east.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/12/23/351282/lufthansa-and-munich-operator-approve-terminal-2-satellite.html|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Lufthansa and Munich operator approve Terminal 2 satellite[/tpl]
While Terminal 1 still has plenty of capacity left - in 2007, it only handled about 9 m passengers - the extension of Terminal 2 is required by Lufthansa and its Star Alliance partners to allow easy transfers within a single terminal. When Terminal 2 and its east apron were built, preparations for a satellite terminal had already been made. Besides the baggage transport tunnel, there are three more tunnels beneath the Terminal 2 apron that can receive a people mover and extensions to the current S-Bahn rail tunnel and unused inter-city rail tunnel respectively. The preparations also allow construction of a second satellite or an independent third terminal further to the east.

===Munich Airport Centre===

The Munich Airport Centre (sometimes shortened to MAC) is a shopping, business and recreation area that connects the two terminals. The older Central Area ([tpl]lang-de|Zentralbereich[/tpl]), which was originally built as part of Terminal 1, hosts a shopping mall and the S-Bahn station. The newer MAC Forum built with Terminal 2 is a large outdoor area with a tent-like, partly transparent roof. Next to it is the airport hotel managed by Kempinski.
Munich Airport is the only location in the entire state of Bavaria where one can shop at Edeka, a supermarket, from 05.30 until midnight every day, including on Sunday.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.munich-airport.de/en/consumer/shops/a-z/E/edeka_Z/index.jsp |title=Munich Airport - Edeka |publisher=Munich-airport.de |date= |accessdate=2013-07-04[/tpl] This supermarket is given an exception from the Bavarian 'Shop Closing Law' (Ladenschlussgesetz).[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladenschlussgesetz |title=Ladenschlussgesetz - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-04[/tpl]

===Runways===

The Franz-Josef Strauss Airport has two parallel runways and one helipad. The two runways at Munich’s airport are 08R/26L and 26R/08L, made of concrete and the same size, at [tpl]convert|4000|m|ft|sigfig=4[/tpl] long, and [tpl]convert|60|m|ft|sigfig=2[/tpl] wide.Munich Airport Facts and Figures: 2011/2012 There is also a concrete helipad.

====Planned third runway====

A third runway would increase the number schedulable aircraft movements per hour from 90 to 120.MUC Airport - Facts and Figures 2010/2011 (p.10) It would run in parallel to the existing runways and be located to the northeast of the current north runway, significantly extending the total area occupied by the airport. According to Flughafen München GmbH (FMG), the airport's operator, the current two-runway system is already operating at full capacity during peak hours, and requests for additional slots from airlines have been denied. Further increase in air traffic is expected as Munich is to become a second major hub in Germany after Frankfurt.
In August 2007, the airport operator applied for a planning permission from the government of Upper Bavaria. As more than 60,000 objections have been filed during public display of the plans, the procedures are expected not to conclude before 2013.
While according to ICAO Regulations (Annex XIV) the new runway would have to be named 08L/26R (renaming the existing north runway to 08C/26C), it is currently assigned the working title 09/27 in all plans.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.muc-ausbau.de/downloads/gutachten_PFV/B001_LU_01Techn_Beschreibg.pdf|author=DC Airports|title=Erläuterungsbericht Technische Planung Luftseite|work=Planfeststellungsverfahren 3.

===Visitor viewing facilities===

The airport authorities have set out to cater for visitors and sight-seers by creating a 'Visitors Park' which includes a 'Visitors Hill' from which a good view can be obtained of the westerly aircraft apron and Terminal 1. This is served by a railway station named 'Besucherpark'. The view from the hill is shown in the above image. There are three historic aircraft on display in the park, a Super Constellation, a Douglas DC-3 and a Junkers Ju 52/3m.
There is also a visitors viewing terrace on the roof of Terminal 2 that features a wide glassed balcony with seating areas and gives a view of the easterly aircraft apron. As of September 2013 the entrance fee has been abolished.

===Road===

Munich Airport is accessible via nearby Motorway A 92, which connects to motorway A9 (towards Nuremberg) and Munich's ring motorway A99.
Bavarian State Road St. 2584 connects A 92's exit 6 (Flughafen München) - an incomplete interchange that can only be used by traffic to and from the west - to the terminals. Access from the east is possible via exit 8 (Freising Ost) and Bavarian State Road St. 2580, which connects to St. 2584 in the east of the airport.

===Railway===

Munich Airport is connected to the city by Munich suburban railway (S-Bahn) lines S1 and S8. The ride takes approximately 45 minutes to the Marienplatz station in the city centre. While the S1 runs from the airport through the nortwestern suburbs and reaches the city centre from the west (Central station - Marienplatz - East station), the S8 comes in from the eastern suburbs passing the stations from the opposite direction. The S-Bahn from the airport to the city runs approx. 20 hours a day with a short break between 01:30 and 04:00.http://www.mvv-muenchen.de/en/on-tour-with-the-mvv/air-travellers/index.html
Furthermore, a scheduled bus service (MVV line 635) connects the airport within 20 minutes to the Freising railway station, providing access to regional trains to destinations like Munich, Nuremberg, Regensburg and Prague.
Munich Airport Terminal station is located in a tunnel beneath the central area. A second station called Besucherpark (German for Visitors' Park) connects the cargo and maintenance areas, long-term parking, administrative buildings and the name-giving Visitors' Park.
A second tunnel beneath the terminals is currently unused. Originally, there were plans to use it for intercity railway, then for a Transrapid maglev train making the trip to Munich Central Station in 10 minutes. However, this project was cancelled in March 2008 due to cost escalation.

===Bus===

MVV bus lines connect the airport to the nearby city of Freising as well as Erding and Markt Schwaben. Lufthansa Airport Bus provides an alternative to the S-Bahn, stopping at Nordfriedhof U-Bahn station and Munich Central Station.
