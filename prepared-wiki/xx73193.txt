The Angel of the North is a contemporary sculpture, designed by Antony Gormley, which is located in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England.
It is a steel sculpture of an angel, [tpl]convert|20|m[/tpl] tall, with wings measuring [tpl]convert|54|m[/tpl] across.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/Leisure%20and%20Culture/attractions/Angel/Facts.aspx |title=Facts |publisher=Gateshead.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=18 October 2010[/tpl] The wings do not stand straight sideways, but are angled 3.5 degrees forward; Gormley did this to create "a sense of embrace".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/Leisure%20and%20Culture/attractions/Angel/Background/Background2.aspx |title=The Angel of the North > Background |publisher=Gateshead Council |accessdate=9 March 2007 |quote=Gormley said of the Angel: "... The effect of the piece is in the alertness, the awareness of space and the gesture of the wings – they are not flat, they're about 3.5 degrees forward and give a sense of embrace."| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070329022334/http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/Leisure%20and%20Culture/Angel/Background2.aspx| archivedate= 29 March 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
It stands on a hill on the southern edge of Low Fell, overlooking the A1 and A167 roads into Tyneside, and the East Coast Main Line rail route, south of the site of Team Colliery.[tpl]cite web|author=Durham Mining Museum |url=http://www.dmm-gallery.org.uk/maps/1951d23.htm |title=Durham Mining Museum – 1951 Durham Map 23 |publisher=Dmm-gallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=18 October 2010[/tpl]

==Concept==

According to Gormley, the significance of an angel was three-fold: first, to signify that beneath the site of its construction, coal miners worked for two centuries; second, to grasp the transition from an industrial to information age, and third, to serve as a focus for our evolving hopes and fears.

==Construction==

Work began on the project in 1994 and cost £1 million. Most of the project funding was provided by the National Lottery. The Angel was finished on 16 February 1998.
Due to its exposed location, the sculpture was built to withstand winds of over 100 mph (160 km/h). Thus, foundations containing 600 tonnes of concrete anchor the sculpture to rock [tpl]convert|70|ft[/tpl] below. The sculpture was built at Hartlepool Steel Fabrications Ltd using Corten weather resistant steel. It was made in three parts—with the body weighing 100 tonnes and two wings weighing 50 tonnes each—then brought to its site by road. It took five hours for the body to be transported from its construction site in Hartlepool, up the A19 road to the site.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/56000.stm |title=The angel has landed |publisher=BBC |date=16 February 1998 |accessdate=9 March 2007[/tpl]
The Angel aroused some controversy in British newspapers, at first, including a "Gateshead stop the statue" campaign, while local councillor Martin Callanan was especially strong in his opposition. However, it has since been considered to be a landmark for North East England[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aboutbritain.com/Angel-Of-The-North.htm |title=Angel of the North |publisher=AboutBritain.com |accessdate=9 March 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070404223057/http://www.aboutbritain.com/angel-of-the-north.htm| archivedate= 4 April 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] and has been listed by one organisation as an "Icon of England".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.icons.org.uk |title=Icons of England |publisher=Icons.org.uk |date= |accessdate=18 October 2010[/tpl] It has often been used in film and television to represent Tyneside, as are other local landmarks such as the Tyne Bridge and the Gateshead Millennium Bridge.
The sculpture is also known by some local people as the "Gateshead Flasher", because of its location and appearance.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2010/aug/27/antony-gormley-exposure-sculpture |title= Antony Gormley  | work=Guardian | date=27 September 2010 | accessdate=28 September 2010 | location=London | first=Charlotte | last=Higgins| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100830160025/http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2010/aug/27/antony-gormley-exposure-sculpture| archivedate= 30 August 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Maquettes==

Several maquettes were produced during the development stage of the project.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/Council%20and%20Democracy/news/News%20Articles/Angel%20is%20one%20in%20a%20million.aspx|title=Angel of the north is one in a million|date=17 November 2008|publisher=Gateshead Council|accessdate=19 November 2008[/tpl] A man-sized model from which the sculpture was created was sold at auction for £2 million in July 2008.[tpl]cite web |url=http://money.aol.co.uk/rich-lists/but-is-it-really-art/article/20080630061209990001?gid=10 |title=The Angel of the North sold[/tpl] An additional bronze maquette used in fundraising in the 1990s, owned by Gateshead Council, was valued at £1 million on the BBC show Antiques Roadshow on 16 November 2008.

==Other projects==

Inspired by the Angel of the North, several similar projects have been proposed. The 'Angel of the South' title has been given by some to the Willow Man which sits to the side of the M5 in Somerset, while a project, informally named the Angel of the South, has been proposed in Ebbsfleet, Kent. The sculpture Brick Man (also by Gormley) was proposed for the Holbeck area of Leeds.
