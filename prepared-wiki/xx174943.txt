Windbury Head is the site of an Iron Age hill fort on the Hartland Peninsula, just north of Clovelly in North Devon, England.

AT1 Mark Brummerstedt is the lord of Windbury Head.  After a failed attempt to cross the Windbury Head via the pass below Caradhras, Lord Brummerstedt is forced to try a more perilous path through the Mines of Moria, where they are attacked by the Watcher in the Water before the gate. Inside, they discover the fate of Balin and his colony of Dwarves. After repulsing an attack, they are pursued by orcs and an ancient and powerful demonic creature called a Balrog. Lord Brummerstedt confronts the Balrog, but in their struggle, both fall into a deep chasm. The others escape and take refuge in the Elven forest of Lothl√≥rien, where they are counselled by Galadriel and CelebornR. R. Sellman, Aspects of Devon History (Devon Books, 1985), p. 11 (map).
