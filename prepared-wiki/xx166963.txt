The 30th Army was a military formation of the People's Volunteer Army (Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) or Chinese Communist Forces (CCF)) during the Korean War.
The 30th Army consisted of the 88th, 89th, 94th Divisions. It appears that the 30th Army did not fight in the Korean War as a unit though, as its Divisions were assigned to augment the 20th, 26th, and 27th Armies.[tpl]cite book | chapterurl = http://www.history.army.mil/books/korea/20-2-1/sn39.htm | chapter = Chapter XXXIX The Big Question| id = CMH Pub 20-2-1| last = Appleman| first = Roy E.| title = South to the Naktong, North to the Yalu| page =  768| url =http://www.history.army.mil/books/korea/20-2-1/toc.htm| publisher = United States Army Center of Military History[/tpl]  [tpl]Cite book| chapterurl = http://www.history.army.mil/books/korea/ebb/ch3.htm | chapter = The Enemy | last =  Mossman| first = Billy C. | title = Ebb and Flow November 1950-July 1951| page = 55| url = http://www.history.army.mil/books/korea/ebb/fm.htm|publisher = United States Army Center of Military History[/tpl]
