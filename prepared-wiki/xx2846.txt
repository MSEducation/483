[[Transport in Ethiopia]]

CATEGORIES: Transport in Ethiopia

Transportation infrastructure in Ethiopia is overseen by the Government of Ethiopia. Over the last seven years, the Ethiopian government has significantly increased funding for road construction. Road projects now represent around a quarter of the annual infrastructure budget. Additionally, through the Road Sector Development Program (RSDP), the government has earmarked $4 billion to construct, repair and upgrade roads over the next ten years.[tpl]cite web|title=Infrastructure|url=http://www.ethiopia.gov.et/infrastructure|publisher=Government of Ethiopia|accessdate=13 March 2014[/tpl]

As the first part of a 10-year Road Sector Development Program, between 1997 and 2002 the Ethiopian government began a sustained effort to improve its infrastructure of roads. As a result, as of 2002 Ethiopia has a total (Federal and Regional) 33,297 km of roads, both paved and gravel. The share of Federally managed roads in good quality improved from 14% in 1995 to 31% in 2002 as a result of this program, and to 89% in 2009 the road density increased from 21 km per 1000 km2 (in 1995) to 889 km; per 1000 km2 (in 2009) however, this is much greater than the average of 50 km per 1000 km2 for Africa."Ethiopia - Second Road Sector Development Program Project", p.3 (World Bank Project Appraisal Document, 19 May 2003)
The Ethiopian government has begun second part of the Road Sector Development Program, which was completed in 2007. This will involve the upgrading or construction of over 7,500 km of roads, with the goal of improving the average road density for Ethiopia to 35 km per 1000 km2, and reduce the proportion of the country area that is more than 5 km from an all-weather road from 75% to 70%.World Bank, "Second Road Sector", p.11
The Ethiopian Roads Authority and China Communications Construction Consultancy are presently building a new six-lane expressway between Addis Ababa and Adama (Nazaret). The expressway will be 80 km long, will shorten the Addis to Adama distance by 20 km. To build this expressway will cost Ethiopia US$350 million. The expressway will begin at Ayat, Addis Ababa and end in north part of Adama. 150 km/h is the limited speed at the expressway, the journey will take about 30–40 minutes. The expressway will be completed in 2014.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.addisfortune.com/Ministry%20to%20Sign%20for%20350m%20dollar%20Loan%20from%20Bank%20of%20China%20for%20New%20Road.htm |title=Ministry to Sign for 350m dollar Loan from Bank of China for New Road |publisher=Addis Fortune |date=27 June 2009 |first=Wudineh |last=Zenebe |accessdate=27 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Addis Adaba Adama (Nazareth) Expressway, Ethiopia|url=http://www.roadtraffic-technology.com/projects/addis-adaba-adama-nazareth-expressway/|publisher=Roadtraffic-technology|accessdate=13 March 2014[/tpl]

==Ports and harbours==

Ethiopia is landlocked and was by agreement with Eritrea using the ports of Asseb and Massawa; since the Eritrean-Ethiopian War, Ethiopia has used the port of Djibouti for nearly all of its imports.  Only one river, the Baro is used for transport.
