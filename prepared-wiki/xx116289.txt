==History==

The station is located along the Montclair-Boonton Line, a former alignment of the New York and Greenwood Lake Railway, run by the Erie Railroad. The line ran from the Erie's Pavonia Terminal in Jersey City to Sterling Forest station on the New Jersey / New York state line. The station was the second of three built in Little Falls, with Great Notch station in the Great Notch district and the Singac station.[tpl]cite map|title=Map of Erie Railroad Stations|year=1920|publisher=Erie Railroad|cartography=Erie Railroad[/tpl] The current railroad depot was built by the Erie in 1915, a one-story brick structure. The line was cut back to Wanaque-Midvale station in 1935 and the cut entirely in 1966 after being rechristened as the Boonton Line, a mix of the New York and Greenwood Lake and the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad's Boonton Branch. In 1983, seven years after the death of the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad, New Jersey Transit took over railroad operations and maintenance of the building. Formerly the third station in Little Falls, it has become the only one in downtown Little Falls, after Great Notch was closed by New Jersey Transit in January 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.njtransit.com/tm/tm_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=PressReleaseTo&PRESS_RELEASE_ID=2574|title=New Jersey Transit Announces Closure of Great Notch Station|date=December 21, 2009|publisher=New Jersey Transit|accessdate=21 December 2009|location=Newark, New Jersey[/tpl]
