[[Maran]]

CATEGORIES: Orthodox rabbinic roles and titles, Aramaic words and phrases

Maran is a title for exceptionally respected rabbis. The term is more prevalent among Sephardi Jews, but is also widely used by Ashkenazi Haredi Jews.
It is an Aramaic word used frequently in the Talmud which means 'our master' ([tpl]Lang|arc|מָרַן[/tpl], [tpl]Transl|arc|māran[/tpl], 'our master'). Most often, as the translation indicates, it is given to rabbis who are considered influential teachers and leaders.
Maran is also a surname used by people, mostly in the United States of America, such as the family of Josie Maran.
The most common use of the term is in reference to "Maran Beth Yosef", Rabbi Yosef Karo.  In fact, when used without further qualification, Maran usually refers to Rabbi Karo. Amongst contemporary Rabbis, Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv and Rabbi Ovadia Yosef is most closely associated with the honorific.
In contemporary parlance Maran is often attributed to Rabbis who serve as founding heads of a particular ideological/cultural movement.  This use is usually limited to communication within that particular movement. For example, within their respective communities Rabbi Elazar Shach (Maran HaRav Shach), Rosh Yeshivas Ponevitch, and Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, Satmar Rebbe often receive the title.
As with most honorifics, this title precedes the name: for example, one might say "Maran Rabbi Ovadia Yosef". Similarly to honorifics like doctor, it can also be used for direct addressing by itself when there is no ambiguity. When used with a name, it will almost always be followed by the (technically redundant) "Rabbi", as in the above example. It is never preceded by "the" in correct usage, though some journalists will make that mistake.
Syriac Christians, who use the Syriac variety of Aramaic, make reference to Jesus using exactly the same title (see Mar).
Apart from that, in Tamil Literature Maran lexically refers to "Desperado/Saviour/Couragious soldier/Defender" and similar meanings and pronounced as "Maarun". Tamil Peots at times, use this name with reference to Love as well. People in Southern Part of India and predominantly Tamil people who are fond of this language's taste use to name their descendants with this name, for instance, Dayanidhi Maran, Tamil Maran, ManiMaran, Marudhamaran, ElaMaran, Murasoli Maran etc.
Some peoples of MEENA Caste also write MARAN in Madhya Pradesh in place of MEENA Caste, for instance  SwaDesh Maran,  DevRaj Maran  etc. of Meena Caste Write Maran.
