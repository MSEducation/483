Alexander "Alex" McLeish (born 21 January 1959),[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.4thegame.com/club/glasgow-rangers-fc/manager-profile/29192/alex_mcleish.html |title=Manager Profile – Alex McLeish |work=4thegame |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080306112803/http://www.4thegame.com/club/glasgow-rangers-fc/manager-profile/29192/alex_mcleish.html |archivedate=6 March 2008[/tpl] is a Scottish former professional football player. Born in Glasgow, McLeish played as a central defender for Aberdeen during their 1980s glory years, making nearly 500 League appearances for the club, and won 77 caps for Scotland.
He started his managerial career with spells at Motherwell and Hibernian, before guiding Rangers to two championships and five cup wins in five years. McLeish spent ten months as manager of the Scotland national team which narrowly failed to qualify for the finals of the 2008 UEFA European championship. He then resigned this post in November 2007 to become manager of Birmingham City, who were in the Premier League at the time. Though Birmingham were relegated at the end of the season, McLeish guided them back to the Premier League in 2009. Birmingham then won the 2011 Football League Cup Final, but were relegated again from the Premier League at the end of the 2010–11 season.
Following this relegation he resigned his post at Birmingham to become manager at their city rivals, Aston Villa. This made him the first manager to move directly from Birmingham City to Aston Villa, and only the second manager after Ron Saunders to manage both clubs. Having only narrowly avoided relegation in the 2011–12 Premier League season, his contract was terminated by Villa at the end of his first season. McLeish was appointed manager of Championship club Nottingham Forest in December 2012, but left after 40 days by mutual consent.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21338533|title=Alex McLeish: Nottingham Forest manager exits City Ground|publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 February 2013 |accessdate=5 February 2013[/tpl]
In recognition of his distinguished service to Scottish sport, in 2008 McLeish was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Aberdeen.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/birmingham-city-fc/birmingham-city-fc-news/2008/07/03/alex-mcleish-honoured-by-university-of-aberdeen-97319-21220729/ |title=Alex McLeish honoured by University of Aberdeen |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=3 July 2008 |accessdate=4 July 2008[/tpl]

==Early years==

McLeish was born in Duke Street Hospital, Glasgow to parents Alex, a shipyard worker, and Jean.[tpl]cite book |last= McLeish |first= Alex |author2= Alastair Macdonald |title= The Don of an Era |publisher= John Donald Publishers |year= 1988 |month= |isbn= 0-85976-242-4[/tpl] He has younger siblings Angela and Ian. After living in the Parkhead and Kinning Park districts of the city, the family moved to Barrhead, Renfrewshire soon after McLeish had reached school age. He attended Springhill Primary, Barrhead High School, where he was one year below future Aberdeen and Scotland teammate Peter Weir, and John Neilson High School in Paisley.
As a juvenile he played for Barrhead Youth Club, alongside Weir, and Glasgow United as well as training for a short period with Hamilton Accies. After a local cup final with Glasgow United in 1976 which was watched by a delegation from Aberdeen, including then manager Ally MacLeod, McLeish signed for the Pittodrie club the following day.

==Playing career==

===Aberdeen years===

McLeish spent the majority of his first two seasons at Aberdeen in the reserves and also had a loan spell at local Junior side Lewis United. He made his competitive debut under Billy McNeill in a New Year fixture against Dundee United on 2 January 1978. His first major final appearance was under the management of Alex Ferguson as a substitute in a 2–1 defeat to Rangers in the 1978–79 League Cup. Over the next seven seasons however, he enjoyed great success winning eight domestic and two European trophies. Highlights included scoring in a 4–1 victory over Rangers in the 1982 Scottish Cup Final on his 200th Dons appearance and a European Cup Winners' Cup win over Real Madrid in 1983.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/1704404.stm |title=Alex McLeish Factfile |date=11 December 2007 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl]
During this period, McLeish formed a formidable defensive triumvirate with Willie Miller and Jim Leighton for both club and country. When Ferguson left in 1986 to go to Manchester United, he tried to get McLeish to sign, but it did not work out; he also had talks with Tottenham Hotspur. He won the Scottish player of the year in 1990, after a season in which Aberdeen won both domestic cups. He was captain of Aberdeen after the retirement of Willie Miller.
Even after he had won his first Scotland cap, McLeish's father asked then Aberdeen boss Alex Ferguson to persuade him to continue training as an accountant.

===International career===

McLeish is Scotland's third most capped player, having gained 77 international caps between 1980 and 1993.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football.cfm?curpageid=350 |title=International Roll of Honour |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=Scottish Football Association| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071024132216/http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football.cfm?curpageid=350| archivedate= 24 October 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] He was first capped for the Scotland U-21 team while still a reserve player at Aberdeen by his former club manager Ally MacLeod, eventually gaining six caps at that level. His full international debut came on 26 March 1980 against Portugal, manager Jock Stein playing him in midfield alongside Archie Gemmill and Graeme Souness. He played in three World Cups with Scotland, in 1982, 1986 and 1990. He is a member of both the Scottish Football Hall of Fame and the Scotland national football team roll of honour. On the occasion of his 50th cap, against Luxembourg in 1987, McLeish was appointed team captain for the game. His final cap came on 17 February 1993 in a 3–0 win over Malta at Hampden Park during the 1994 World Cup qualifiers. He never scored in his 77 appearances for Scotland.http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/scotland/alex-mcleish-4800/scottish-caps-part-2-1986-93_a11925/

==Management career==

===Motherwell===

After his successful playing career he quickly went into football management with Motherwell in 1994, one year before he retired as a player. His first season at Motherwell saw him take the Lanarkshire club to second in the Premier Division behind Walter Smith's Rangers. However, he failed to build on this success and the next two season were spent in relegation battles. He resigned as manager to take over at Hibernian in 1998.

===Hibernian===

McLeish took over a struggling Hibernian side, which was relegated from the Scottish Premier Division in 1998 despite a slight upturn in fortunes under McLeish. He then guided the Edinburgh team back to the Scottish Premier League at the first attempt by winning the First Division championship.
Hibernian consolidated in their first season back in the top division, finishing mid-table and reaching the Scottish Cup semi-final. In the 2000–01 season, Hibs started very strongly. Eventually they had to settle for third place and a Scottish Cup final appearance. This performance attracted the attention of bigger clubs, including West Ham United and Rangers.
McLeish attracted top players such as Russell Latapy and former French international Franck Sauzée to Hibs. He also helped develop young striker Kenny Miller, who would later go on to play for Scotland.
During this period McLeish worked towards and was awarded a UEFA Pro Licence.[tpl]cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20001105/ai_n13953165/ |title=Andy caps his return to the big time |first=Michael |last=Grant |date=5 November 2000 |accessdate=25 March 2010 |newspaper=Sunday Herald |format=reprint |publisher=FindArticles[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/scotland/2327013/England-could-learn-from-Scottish-system.html |title=England could learn from Scottish system |first=Henry |last=Winter |date=29 November 2007 |accessdate=25 March 2010 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph[/tpl]

===Rangers===

His work at Hibs was noticed, and he was linked with several moves to England, before he was appointed as Rangers manager in December 2001[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/1701609.stm |title=Rangers unveil McLeish |date=11 February 2001 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl] after outgoing Rangers manager Dick Advocaat recommended McLeish to chairman David Murray.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/advocaat-s-vested-interest-in-the-improbable-dream-1.866731 |title=Advocaat's vested interest in the improbable dream |date=9 October 2007 |accessdate=25 March 2010 |work=The Herald |first=Darryl |last=Broadfoot |authorlink=Darryl Broadfoot[/tpl]
McLeish was an instant success at Rangers, winning both the Scottish Cup[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scottish_cup/1966673.stm |title=Rangers win Old Firm final |date=4 May 2002 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl] and Scottish League Cup[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/cis_ins_cup/1875551.stm |title=Rangers lift CIS Cup |date=17 March 2002 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl] in his first season, but the big prize of the league title was essentially lost before his arrival. His second season saw him go one better when he won the domestic treble, with the help of players such as Ronald de Boer and Barry Ferguson.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/2946904.stm |title=Rangers complete Treble |date=31 May 2003 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl]
Rangers' worsening financial state saw many of his top players leave in the summer of 2003. Celtic won the league comfortably in season 2003–04, and Rangers failed to win any trophies.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rangers.premiumtv.co.uk/page/formermanagers/0,,5~1555142,00.html |title=Past Managers – Alex McLeish |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=Rangers F.C[/tpl] McLeish was consequently put under pressure from fans after his poor signings and a record run of seven consecutive derby losses to Celtic.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/3997583.stm |title=Bosses talk up Old Firm meeting |date=9 November 2004 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl]
The high profile Bosman signings of Jean-Alain Boumsong and Dado Pršo in the close season of 2004–05 gave Rangers renewed hope of regaining the title from Celtic's grasp.[tpl]cite news |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/top-stories/Prso-capture-sees-McLeish-celebrate.2527597.jp |title=Prso capture sees McLeish celebrate |date=10 May 2004 |accessdate=25 March 2010 |work=The Scotsman |first=Angus |last=Wright[/tpl] McLeish's team won the 2005 league title on a dramatic last day, an outcome that had looked highly unlikely after Rangers fell five points behind leaders Celtic with just four games remaining.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/4570627.stm |title=Rangers in dramatic title triumph |date=22 May 2005 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl]
After this unexpected success, McLeish and his Rangers team headed into the 2005–06 SPL campaign as favourites to retain the championship. McLeish made a number of signings, including Julien Rodriguez and Ian Murray, despite having little money to spend. After a reasonable start to the season, including a win over Celtic,[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/4164472.stm |title=Rangers 3–1 Celtic |date=20 October 2005 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl] Rangers suffered a series of poor results between September and November. This period included a club record of 10 games without a win. However the tenth match of this run, a 1–1 draw with Inter Milan in the Champions League, took Rangers into the knockout stages of the tournament for the first time.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4494912.stm |title=Rangers 1–1 Inter Milan |date=6 December 2005 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl]
Despite the poor domestic form, McLeish guided Rangers to the last 16 of the Champions League, where they were defeated on the away goals rule by Villarreal.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4778246.stm |title=Villarreal 1–1 Rangers (agg 3–3) |date=7 March 2006 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl] They became the first Scottish team to progress this far in the European Cup since 1993, and the first Scottish team to progress through a European group stage. In December, chairman David Murray publicly announced his support for McLeish.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/4503564.stm |title=McLeish receives Murray's backing |date=8 February 2005 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl] Rangers then went on a good run of results in December and January.
This run of good results came to a sudden halt when they were defeated 3–0 by Hibernian in the Scottish Cup,[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_cups/4676068.stm |title=Rangers 0–3 Hibernian |date=4 February 2006 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl] prompting protests outside Ibrox against both McLeish and David Murray.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/4685366.stm |title=Fans expect more Ibrox protests |date=6 February 2006 |accessdate=16 October 2007|publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl] On 9 February 2006, it was announced by chairman David Murray that McLeish would be standing down as manager at the end of that season.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/4697444.stm |title=McLeish to leave Rangers in May |date=9 February 2006 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl]
It was later announced that he would be succeeded by former Olympique Lyonnais manager Paul Le Guen. Rangers beat Hearts 2–0 at Ibrox Stadium in his final match as manager.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/4976560.stm |title=Rangers 2–0 Hearts |date=7 May 2006 |accessdate=16 October 2007|publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl]

===Scotland===

McLeish said after leaving Rangers that he would not manage another Scottish club, because he felt that he had achieved everything in the Scottish game.[tpl]cite news |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/rangersfc/Im-a-Rangers-man-.2750134.jp |title='I'm a Rangers man – I couldn't manage another Scottish club' |first=Glenn |last=Gibbons |date=11 February 2006 |accessdate=25 March 2010 |newspaper=The Scotsman[/tpl] He was linked in the media with a number of managerial positions in England while he worked as a television pundit for the BBC and Setanta Sports.
McLeish took charge of the Scotland national team on 29 January 2007.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6289073.stm |title=McLeish unveiled as Scotland boss |date=29 January 2007 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl] His assistants in the job were Roy Aitken and Andy Watson.
McLeish's first game in charge of the national team was a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match, a 2–1 victory against Georgia on 24 March 2007 at Hampden Park.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6449543.stm |title=Scotland 2–1 Georgia |first=Julian |last=Taylor |date=24 March 2007 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071022213733/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6449543.stm| archivedate= 22 October 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] His second game was an away fixture against Italy on 28 March 2007 which ended in a 2–0 defeat.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6495949.stm |title=Italy 2–0 Scotland |first=Colin |last=Moffat |date=28 March 2007 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071012183043/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6495949.stm| archivedate= 12 October 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
McLeish's Scotland side then went on to defeat the Faroe Islands away in June,[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6713997.stm |title=Faroe Islands 0–2 Scotland |first=Julian |last=Taylor |date=6 June 2007 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071120045635/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6713997.stm| archivedate= 20 November 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Lithuania at home in September[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6981599.stm |title=Scotland 3–1 Lithuania |first=Colin |last=Moffat |date=8 September 2007 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071119000413/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6981599.stm| archivedate= 19 November 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] before recording a historic victory in Paris four days later by defeating France 1–0 in the Parc des Princes.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6986781.stm |title=France 0–1 Scotland |first=Thomas |last=McGuigan |date=12 September 2007 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl] James McFadden's 64th-minute strike from 30 yards was enough to earn Scotland the win and returned them to the top of Group B with three games to play. This result has been hailed as one of the Scotland national team's greatest victories.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6986215.stm |title=McLeish proud of superb Scotland |date=13 September 2007 |accessdate=16 October 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport[/tpl] Scotland's next success was at home to Ukraine, winning 3–1 at Hampden on 13 October. McLeish suffered his second defeat as manager, away in Georgia on 17 October. This result left him facing a decider against the World Champions, Italy. Scotland lost the game, McLeish's last, and Italy qualified for the finals.

===Birmingham City===

Premier League Birmingham City's approach to the SFA for permission to speak to McLeish about their managerial vacancy was refused,[tpl]cite news |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=1660&id=1860622007 |title=SFA reject official approach for McLeish |work=The Scotsman |date=27 November 2007 |accessdate=28 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071202224850/http://sport.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=1660&id=1860622007| archivedate= 2 December 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

McLeish changed the club's backroom staff and training procedures, appointed David Watson as goalkeeping coach, and overhauled the scouting setup, bringing in Paul Montgomery – the scout who recommended a relatively unknown Didier Drogba to West Ham United – to oversee player recruitment.
