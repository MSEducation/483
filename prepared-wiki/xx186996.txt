[[Leofeld, Saskatchewan]]

CATEGORIES: Unincorporated communities in Saskatchewan

Leofeld, Saskatchewan was founded in 1903 by catholic German settlers. It is located seven miles south east of Cudworth, Saskatchewan in the rural municipality of  Hoodoo 401. Shortly after the time of settlement a store, school, church and post office sprang up. The village started to shrink because of the railroad choosing to go through Cudworth, Saskatchewan instead. Today all that remains are the church and a few farmyards.What's in a Name by E.T. Russel
