Pothos Argyros (also Argyrus; [tpl]lang-it|Potone Argiro[/tpl]) was the catepan of Italy during the eventful years of 1029 to 1031. Pothos replaced Christophoros Burgaris as catepan and immediately had to deal with new Saracen assaults. In 1031, he was defeated at Cassano allo Ionio and replaced by Michael Protospatharios.
