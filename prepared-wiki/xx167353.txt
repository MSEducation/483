Sunshine Studios is an International dance organisation with Studios, Schools, Agencies and Camps around the world. Started in Manchester, England, and open since 2006, Sunshine Studios  the brainchild of hip-hop teacher-turned-entrepreneur Jerry Tse (aka JV).
Sunshine Studios gives artists of various performing and visual arts a place to base themselves from and the chance to run classes for the benefit of the public who are able to come to a central place. This is a similar business model as that used by other dance studios such as Pineapple Studios in London and Steps On Broadway in New York City.
The studios offer a variety of workshops and nearly 100 classes per week. These include urban art, live music, hip-hop, ballet, tap, jazz, salsa, pilates, pole-dancing, flamenco, cheerleading, contemporary dance, breakdancing and other forms of performing arts.Sunshine-Studios - Home

==History==

The idea for a dance studio in Manchester had been nurtured by hip-hop teacher and entrepreneur Jerry since 2002. It now has studios in not only Manchester but also Blackburn UK, Stavanger Norway, Beijing China, Cairo Egypt and LA USA.
The business overcame slight obstacles in its infancy—a fire at its Dale St premises in June 2007 and then their second building succumbed to arson in August 2007—but went on to become part of the creative fabric that makes up Manchester.  Sunshine now has a franchise in Bolton.
The studios has since become a haven for artists of all genres of dance, music and art to run classes and develop their passions. It is open to everyone 7 days a week and is looking to give the public of Manchester UK, Blackburn UK, Stavanger Norway, Beijing China, Cairo Egypt and LA USA a world-leading dance classes.
Sunshine Studios has helped nurture talents such as Britain's Got Talent winner George Sampson.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1012/1012954_dance_studio_wrecked_again.html|title=Dance studio wrecked, again|date=7 August 2007|work=Manchester Evening News[/tpl]
