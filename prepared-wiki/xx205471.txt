The Fortune Global 500, also known as Global 500, is an annual ranking of the top 500 corporations worldwide as measured by revenue. The list is compiled and published annually by Fortune magazine.
Until 1989 it listed only non-US industrial corporations under the title "International 500", while the Fortune 500 contained and still contains exclusively US corporations. In 1990, US companies were added to compile a truly global list of top industrial corporations as ranked by sales. Since 1995, the list has had its current form, listing also top financial corporations and service providers by revenue.
From 2001 to 2012, there has been significant change in the geographical distribution of the companies in the Global 500 rankings. The number of North American–based companies have reduced from 215 in 2001 to 144 in 2011, whereas the contribution of Asian-based companies have increased rapidly from 116 in 2001 to 188 in 2012. The share of European-based companies have increased marginally from 158 to 160 over the decade.[tpl]cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/|title=A New Perspective on the Corporate World|accessdate=8 July 2013|publisher=CNN Money, Fortune Magazine[/tpl]

==Controversy==

It has been reported that several inconsistencies exist in Fortune's ranking of cities with "the most Fortune 500 headquarters."  On June 3, 2011, the Atlanta Business Chronicle stated examples of Fortune including regional headquarters for some cities, not including regional headquarters for other cities, and in some cases, not including headquarters that are physically located inside a city limit.[tpl]cite web|title=Some cities rankings are overstated|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/print-edition/2011/06/03/fortune-500-list-overstates-atlantas.html?page=all|publisher=Atlanta Business Chronicle|accessdate=28 October 2012[/tpl]
