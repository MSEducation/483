===Glee===

Morris was taking acting classes and actively pursuing an acting career when she was asked by Woodlee to teach the choreography for Beyoncé's "Single Ladies" dance to the Glee actors. At the same time, the show was looking for a third cheerleader, and Morris ended up landing the role of Brittany.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.mybuffalo.com/_Young-Entertainers-Get-a-Taste-of-Hollywood/blog/1663704/85283.html| title = Young Entertainers Get a Taste of Hollywood| publisher = My Buffalo| date = December 31, 2009| accessdate = January 8, 2010[/tpl] Initially a background character who hardly ever spoke, the role grew as writers discovered Morris had a gift for delivering one-liners.[tpl]cite web|url=http://scrippsnews.com/content/tv-heather-morris-has-become-reliable-comic-voice-glee |title=TV: Heather Morris has become a reliable comic voice on 'Glee' |publisher=ScrippsNews |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09[/tpl] Jarrett Wieselman of the New York Post opined that Morris has "emerged as one of the funniest second bananas on TV right now"[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/glee_secret_weapon_F5TBDx5xqrS369UoZU7BEP |title='Glee's' secret weapon |last=Wieselman|first=Jarrett |date=November 19, 2009 |work=New York Post |accessdate=8 January 2010[/tpl] and the LA Times wrote of having a "comedy crush on Morris, who plays the galactically dim Glee Club cheerleader Brittany".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/theguide/events-and-festivals/la-ca-overunder25-20100425,0,661163.story | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Underrated / Overrated | date=April 25, 2010[/tpl]
When a promotional clip for the episode "Sectionals" indicated that Brittany Pierce and Santana Lopez had slept together, Dorothy Snarker, writing for lesbian entertainment website After Ellen, praised the pairing, referring to them by the portmanteau "Brittana".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.afterellen.com/blog/dorothysnarker/glee-spoils-us-with-unexpected-coupling |title="Glee" spoils us with an unexpected coupling |last=Snarker|first=Dorothy |date=December 7, 2009 |publisher=After Ellen |accessdate=7 December 2009|archiveurl=http://archive.is/hEJS|archivedate=30 June 2012[/tpl] Snarker called the two her "new favorite Glee pairing", commenting that: "While Heather Morris (Brittany) and Naya Rivera (Santana) have had minimal screen time, they've made it count. Heather in particular has brought the laughs as the Cheerio least likely to get a Mensa invitation. Never mind Finn and Rachel — I'm on Team Brittana now."
Morris' role became more prominent during the final nine episodes of season one and, due to the overwhelmingly positive response to her character, was promoted to official series regular status during season two.[tpl]cite web|last=Hibberd |first=James |url=http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2010/04/27/glee-promotes-brittany-santana/ |title='Glee' exclusive: Brittany and Santana poised for major promotions | Inside TV | EW.com |publisher=Ausiellofiles.ew.com |date=2010-04-27 |accessdate=2011-11-09[/tpl] She was at the center of the second episode, "Britney/Brittany", (a tribute to Britney Spears) where she made her singing debut covering Spears' "I'm a Slave 4 U" solo and dueting with Naya Rivera on "Me Against the Music". She later got many other singing and dancing solos. The second half of season two saw Morris' character engage in a lesbian storyline with Rivera's character. Both the arc along with Rivera's and Morris' performances were met with critical acclaim. As on Glee, Morris is best friends in real life with co-star Rivera.[tpl]cite news |title=Glee's Summer Fun  |work=OK!

In Season 3, she and Rivera's character continue with the lesbian storyline, and others. For example, she had a large role in the episode "Prom-asaurus". During the season finale, she reveals that she had an 0.0 GPA and that she would not be graduating.
During the 2011 Glee Tour, Heather performed Britney Spears' song "I'm a Slave 4 U". She also had a dance spotlight with castmate Harry Shum Jr. during Naya Rivera's performance of "Valerie," and was one of the dancers in the Single Ladies and Safety Dance numbers.
Morris co-wrote and appeared in a January 2011 video for Funny or Die, "Nuthin' But A Glee Thang," a take-off of the Dr. Dre/Snoop Dogg collaboration "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang". Co-written with actresses Ashley Lendzion and Riki Lindhome, the video features appearances from Modern Family's Sofia Vergara and Morris's Glee castmates Matthew Morrison, Cory Monteith, Harry Shum, Jr., and Naya Rivera.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/a73c447356/nuthin-but-a-glee-thang-with-heather-morris-matthew-morrison-sofia-vergara?playlist=featured_videos |title=Nuthin' But A Glee Thang with Heather Morris, Matthew Morrison & Sofia Vergara from Heather Morris, Sofia Vergara, Matthew Morrison, Cory Monteith, Naya Rivera, Harry Shum Jr, Riki Lindhome, Ashley Lendzion, David Bernad, Isaac Hagy, BoTown Sound, Shauna O'Toole, Funny Or Die, Keith Schofield, Brian Mulchy, and Christin Trogan |publisher=Funnyordie.com |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2011-11-09[/tpl]
