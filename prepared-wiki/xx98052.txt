Frank Zappa briefly owned a Jazzmaster very early in his career (prior to his joining The Mothers). John Lennon was photographed playing a white Jazzmaster (belonging to Jacky Spelter) during an Austrian hotel lounge jam with The Beatles in March 1965.

==Imitations and reissues==

There are a wide array of budget-priced overseas Jazzmaster imitations, particularly from the 1960s and '70s.  Dillion, Yamaha, Framus, Teisco, Aria, Jansen, Harmony, National and Demel are some of the companies who indulged, mainly to capitalize on the surf rock sound of the 1960s. Many of the modern copies replace the Jazzmaster's bridge and tremolo setup with a Stratocaster-derived assembly, altering the character of the guitar considerably but making it more palatable to players used to the Strat. The vintage copies are rising in price, with guitars costing under $100 as little as 5 years ago now selling for as much as $600. Fender eventually got the offset-waist body shape patented, putting an end to the 'copy era'.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl]
Fender's Japanese facility is noted for the high quality of its offset-waist guitars.  These MIJ or CIJ (Made or Crafted In Japan) reissues have been sporadically available outside Japan since the late 1980s, either from Japanese dealers willing to ship overseas, or from US dealers who have imported them. However, these Japanese-made Jazzmasters, except for those with JV-prefix serial numbers, are often criticized for essentially having narrow Stratocaster pickups inside the wide soapbar Jazzmaster housings, thus giving the guitar a Strat/Jaguar "honk" rather than the classic, mellow Jazzmaster sound. Since 1996, its Squier offshoot has manufactured a budget version called the Jagmaster, though its humbucker pickups and Stratocaster-style bridge give it a much different, "hard rock" sound.
In May 2008 Fender introduced the Classic Player Series Jazzmaster, which is made in Mexico. Fender have made numerous changes to the original design, replacing the bridge with a Tune-o-matic type, giving it a 9.5" fretboard radius, moving the tremolo plate closer to the bridge and installing special designed P-90-type high-output single-coil pickups with a bar magnet at the base instead of the more Strat-like magnetized polepieces of the original pickups.http://www.fender.com/products//view_specs.php?full_partno=0141600&name=Classic+Player+Jazzmaster%26reg%3B+Special
September 2010 saw the introduction of the Mexican-made Black Top Jazzmaster HS. This guitar sports a Duncan Designed single-coil Jazzmaster neck pickup and a hot vintage alnico humbucking bridge pickup, with other distinctive touches including skirted black amp knobs, a Jazzmaster tremolo tailpiece and a three-way toggle switch. Other features include an alder body, maple neck with 9.5‚Äù-radius rosewood fretboard, 21 medium-jumbo frets, gloss polyester finish and chrome hardware.
In January 2013 Fender added the Carved Maple Top Jazzmaster HH to its premium Select series. The instrument features an alder body with a carved maple top, a pair of new Wide Range Special humbuckers controlled by a three-way switch, volume and tone (with push-pull S-1 switch), and an Adjusto-Matic bridge and tailpiece arrangement. It also features an innovative "channel-bound" rosewood fingerboard, in which the fingerboard itself is inlaid into the maple neck.http://www.fender.com/series/fender-select/fender-select-carved-maple-top-jazzmaster-hh/

==Signature editions==

In July 2007, Fender released the J Mascis signature Jazzmaster, in honour of the Dinosaur Jr frontman. This model is much the same as previous Jazzmaster models aside from its Adjust-o-matic bridge (the Fender equivalent of the Gibson Tune-o-matic bridge), and its unusual purple sparkle finish. It is currently the only model of Jazzmaster in production with a matching headstock.[ref]There will be a new Squier version in White with A gold Anodized Pickguard out soon.

April 2008 saw the introduction of the Elvis Costello Jazzmaster,[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.fender.com/products/search.php?partno=0115900892|title = Elvis Costello Jazzmaster |date = May 2008 |publisher = Fender[/tpl] the second signature Jazzmaster model made at the Corona facility - a faithful replication of Elvis Costello's 1960s Jazzmaster used during his 1977 debut album, My Aim is True. This signature Jazzmaster guitar features a solid walnut-stain finished alder body and a modified tremolo bridge for Costello's trademark "spy movie" sound.
In June 2009, Fender announced Lee Ranaldo and Thurston Moore signature Jazzmasters, in honour of the guitarists of Sonic Youth.  These models were released on July 1, 2009.  Both editions are stripped down to have only one volume knob and a pickup switch that goes side to side and have a black headstock.  The difference lies in the pickup, bridge, colour, and the relative placement of the volume knob to the jack input.  Ranaldo's instrument has a Sapphire Blue finish and features dual Fender Wide Range humbucking pickups that are re-spec'd to Ranaldo's specifications and a Mustang bridge.  Moore's version features a Forest Green finish, a pair of Seymour Duncan Antiquity II Jazzmaster single-coil pickups and a Tune-o-matic bridge.
In October 2011, Fender introduced the Squier J Mascis signature Jazzmaster with gold anodized aluminum pickguard, featuring several custom specifications from J Mascis including slightly warmer "P90" sounding pickups, fast satin finished neck, and nonfloating bridge.

Additionally, but NOT limited to the following:
Vintage Jazzmasters have been seen in most of the common Fender Custom Colors of the era, and as Fender would sometimes paint guitars in any shade the owner requested, one cannot list the full range of colors made.

Jazzmasters featured bound necks with block pearloid inlays from 1966 until the end of their original run in 1977; the headstocks were also larger ("CBS-style") in this era.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl]
They have featured matching headstocks (headstocks painted the same color as the body) at several points throughout the guitar's history.  Matched-headstock versions generally fetch a higher price and are currently not in production, except for the special J. Mascis edition.
