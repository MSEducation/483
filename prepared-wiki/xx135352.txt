[[Gonggi]]

CATEGORIES: Korean games, Children's games

Gonggi (공기, pronounced gong-gee) is a popular Korean children's game that is traditionally played using 5 or more small grape-sized pebbles. Nowadays, children buy colourful plastic stones instead of finding pebbles. It can be played alone or with friends.  The stones are called gonggitdol ([tpl]lang|ko-Hang|공깃돌[/tpl]), which means "gonggi stones."  Since only a few stones and a flat surface are needed for play, the game can be played by anyone almost anywhere.

==Game Play==

The game generally begins with each player tossing the stones from the palm of their hand into the air. While airborne, the player switches his hand backside up. The gonggi stones are then caught on the back of the hand. The person with the leading amount plays first.

==Playing Calls==

There are many playing calls in the Gonggi game. The standard calls have been listed here. The penalty for a "mess–up" requires that the player who has perpetrated it pass the stones  to the next player.
