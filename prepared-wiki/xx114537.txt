[[Marine Corps Intelligence Command]]

CATEGORIES: Military intelligence, Commands of the United States Marine Corps

The Marine Corps Intelligence Command (MCIC) was created in 1988 by then Commandant of the Marine Corps Alfred M. Gray, Jr.
He created this organization to address the lack of expeditionary intelligence support for policy, acquisition, and operations, as each of the service intelligence centers focused only on their needs. Colonel Walter Breede III was the first Director.

The flagship study of the Center, "Planning and Programming Factors for Expeditionary Operations in the Third World", was published by the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) in March 1990, and was unusual for relying exclusively on open sources of information for creating a matrix of 143 mission area factors that could be objectively evaluated in relation to five degrees of difficulty, and for being published as an unclassified rather than a classified study.
