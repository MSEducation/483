[[Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship]]

CATEGORIES: Medical education in India

Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship (CRRI) refers to one-year compulsory work in the hospital attached to the medical college or in any other approved hospital as allowed in some medical colleges(also known as Teaching Hospital), for a period of one year.Rules and regulations for medical graduates from the Medical Council of India website This is required for the award of the Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MB BS) medical degree in India.

==Description==

An Intern (also called an Internee or a CRRI) is posted in all the clinical departments of the hospital on a rotation basis. This gives him the basic clinical experience in all the disciplines of medicine and enables him to work as a General Physician.
The intern is also given a monthly stipend. The amount may vary from one college to another, based on ownership by State or private entity. Completion of internship is a necessary pre-requisite for award of the degree, license to practice medicine and for postgraduate studies or higher specialty training.
On passing the final MBBS examination at the end of 41/2 years, a medical student is first awarded a Provisional registration certificate by the Medical Council of India (MCI) or the State medical council and he can start the internship. The Permanent registration certificate along with the "MCI Registration number" (i.e., the license to practice) and the final Medical degree (i.e., the MBBS degree) is given only after obtaining a CRRI completion certificate endorsing the successful and satisfactory completion of the CRRI.

==Comparison==

The Internship is different from the House Officership (which may follow Internship) in the UK and many other countries, where it is not a compulsory tenure. The House Physician or the House Surgeon unlike an Intern, works in a particular department of his or her choice and is paid a monthly 'salary' for his work in the hospital (especially, in the UK). The American counterpart is simply called a "Resident" or a "Resident Doctor" (i.e., a Resident Physician or a Resident Surgeon, etc.). In some parts of the world, they are also called a "Senior House Officer".
In comparison, in India, the Internship or the House Surgeoncy or the House Officership - all are considered to be the same. And, there is no such term in common parlance as "House Physician" in India. This is because, in India, the doctor who is undergoing higher specialty training following Internship is called a "Post-Graduate student" (i.e., a Medicine PG student or a Surgery PG student, etc.).
This is because in India, specialty training is considered to be a period of 'learning' (and hence called a student and paid a stipend. And he pays a "tuition fee" for his education) whereas in other countries, it is considered as a period of 'training' (and hence called a resident doctor and paid a salary. And he does not pay any form of fee for this 'training'). Nevertheless, some institutions in India have begun to adopt the changing patterns in the world and have started calling their 'PG students' as 'Residents' (or as "Junior residents") but they still pay them stipend and not a salary besides collecting tuition fees.
Also note that in the United States, a first-year resident (c.f.: 1st year PG student, in India) is called an "Intern". This is because the American medical students do not undergo the Indian type of CRRI rotation in a hospital at the end of their medical school (c.f.: called a medical college, in India). It is also interesting to note that the American medical students are awarded the "M.D." degree at the end of 4 (four) years of medical school.American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) website So, essentially the American M.D. is equal to the Indian MBBS (despite the US-MD being 11/2 years short of the Indian-MBBS). Whereas an Indian-MBBS can practice independently, an US-MD cannot practice without completing the residencyECFMG ERAS website training (c.f.: called Post-graduate higher specialty training, in India).

==Responsibilities==

The Interns are entrusted with clinical responsibilities under the supervision of a Medical teacher (a Consultant/ Chief) and/ or a Resident (a PG student/ Senior medical officer). They do not work independently but can treat patients. Interns are not supposed to issue medical certificates, death certificates or medico-legal documents under their own signatures because they do not have a MCI Registration number.
