The Cleveland Indians are a professional baseball team based in Cleveland, Ohio.
They were a founder member of the American League in 1901 as the Cleveland Blues and Cleveland Naps, and established themselves in professional baseball during the 1900s and 1910s. They won the first of two World Series in 1920 at their first attempt.
Since then, the Indians have had two major periods of success. The first was from 1947 to 1956, when they had winning records in every season and won their only other World Series in 1948, including a 111-43 record in 1954, which remains the best Major League Baseball regular season record since the 1909 Pirates. The Indiansâ€™ other highly successful period was from 1994 to 2001, when they had eight consecutive winning seasons but were unable to win a third World Series, losing in both of their appearances during this stretch (1995 and 1997).
The Indians have also experienced failure in their history. From the split of the American League into two divisions in 1969 until 1993, the Indians did not make a single postseason appearance and played only four winning seasons. They posted 100 losses four times during the era. Since 2002, the Indians have declined with only three winning seasons and two postseason appearances.
