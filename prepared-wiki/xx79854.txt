Michael Edwards (born 5 December 1963), better known as Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards, is a British skier who in 1988 became the first competitor to represent Great Britain in Olympic ski jumping. At the time, Edwards was the British ski jumping record holder (a record later broken by others"British ski jumper gets Olympic nod," BBC, 2002-01-11.

==Background==

Edwards was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. A good downhill skier, he narrowly missed out on the GB team for that event for the 1984 Games. To improve his chances to qualify for Calgary in 1988, he moved to Lake Placid in the US to train and enter races of a higher standard, but he quickly found himself short on funds. To realize his Olympic dream he decided to switch to ski jumping for reasons of cost and easier qualification as there were no other British ski jumpers with whom to compete for a place.Calgary '88 icon Eddie the Eagle returns to carry 2010 Olympic torch Yahoo! Sports Canada
Eddie began jumping under the watchful eye of Chuck Berghorn in Lake Placid, NY, using Berghorn's equipment, although he had to wear six pairs of socks to make the boots fit. Edwards was handicapped by his weight—at about 82 kg (181 lb), more than 9 kg (20 lb) heavier than the next heaviest competitor—and by his lack of financial support for training—he was totally self-funded. Another problem was that he is very farsighted, requiring him to wear his eyeglasses at all times, which during ski jumps fogged to such an extent that he could not see."Last man standing wins gold". Daily Mail.Retrieved 21 February 2014
Eddie was informed of his qualification for the Games while working as a plasterer and residing temporarily in a Finnish mental hospital due to lack of funds for alternative accommodation (rather than as a patient).Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards - Olympic legend YouTube Edwards first represented Great Britain at the 1987 World Championships, and was ranked 55th in the world and this performance qualified him, as the sole British applicant, for the 1988 Winter Olympics ski jumping competition.
Edwards was the best ski jumper in the United Kingdom, setting a British record of 73.5 m in one of his Calgary jumps in 1988.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/4546420.stm | work=BBC News | title=Eddie the Eagle backs ski plans | date=20 December 2005 | accessdate=1 May 2010[/tpl]

==1988 Olympics==

In the 1988 Olympics, Edwards competed in, and finished last in, both the 70 m and 90 m events. From the beginning, though, his legend was embroidered with falsehoods.

However, his lack of success endeared him to people around the globe. The worse he performed, the more popular he became. He subsequently became a media celebrity and appeared on talk shows around the world, appearing on The Tonight Show during the Games. The press nicknamed him "Mr. Magoo", and one Italian journalist called him a "ski dropper".[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/stories/indepth.shtml?/story/olympics/national/2006/01/20/Sports/eddie-eagle-qa060120.html | title=CBC.CA - Torino 2006[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]
The widespread attention that Edwards received in Calgary turned was embarrassing to some in the ski jumping establishment. Many athletes and officials felt that Edwards was "making a mockery" of the sport.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl] Shortly after the Olympics finished, the entry requirements were strengthened in order to making it nearly impossible for anyone to follow his example.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl]
At the closing ceremony, the president of the Organizing Committee, Frank King, singled out Edwards for his contribution: "At these Games, some competitors have won gold, some have broken records, and some of you have even soared like an eagle."Eddie "The Eagle" lights up Calgary in 1988 BBC Sport, 9 December 2009

==The Eddie "The Eagle" Rule==

In response to the Edwards phenomenon, in 1990, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) instituted what became known as the Eddie the Eagle Rule, which requires Olympic hopefuls to compete in international events and place in the top 30 percent or the top 50 competitors, whichever is fewer.
Edwards failed to qualify for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France and the 1994 Games in Lillehammer, Norway. He managed to get a five-year sponsorship from Eagle Airlines, a small British charter company, to fund his attempt to reach the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan but failed to qualify for those as well.[ref]

==Return to Calgary==

On 13 February 2008, Edwards made a return visit to Calgary to take part in festivities marking the twentieth anniversary of the Games. During his visit, he rode the zip-line at Canada Olympic Park with a member of the Jamaican bobsled team (the ride simulates the speed of a ski-jumper) and led a procession of skiers down the slopes of the park while carrying an Olympic torch.Doug McIntyre, here "Golden Memories Fired Up!" Calgary Sun, 14 February 2008, (accessed 14 February 2008)Zip-line ride: Global News Calgary (television broadcast), 13 February 2008

==Torchbearer==

==Creative efforts==

Edwards subsequently released a book (and a video) called On the Piste.On the Piste, ISBN 0-233-99497-1 He recorded a song in Finnish entitled "Mun nimeni on Eetu" ("My name is Eetu"), though he does not speak Finnish. Eddie's less-than-perfect pronunciation added to its appeal. Later, he recorded another Finnish language song: "Eddien Siivellä" ("On Eddie's Wing"). Both of these songs were composed and written by a popular Finnish artist Irwin Goodman.

==Commercial success==

Edwards appeared in a number of advertising campaigns, e.g. on television, promoting cars. He was able to command fees of £10,000 an hour. Nevertheless, he declared bankruptcy in 1992, claiming a trust fund for his earnings was not set up properly. He earned a degree in law at De Montfort University in Leicester. "I've been interested in law since taking out a civil action against my trustees 10 years ago," he remarked in a 2001 interview.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/1194090.stm | work=BBC News | title=Take a look at me now | date=1 March 2001 | accessdate=1 May 2010[/tpl]

==Planned biopic==

A film chronicling the life story of Edwards has been planned by Irish director Declan Lowney since 2007. Comedian Steve Coogan was originally slated for the title role.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6937217.stm|title=Coogan to play Eddie 'The Eagle'|publisher=BBC News Online|date=8 August 2007|accessdate=8 August 2007[/tpl] Edwards was said to be pleased with the choice but also joked that Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise would be better suited for the role. In 2009, Lowney announced that Rupert Grint would instead play the role. The film was scheduled to begin production once Grint completed work on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Part 2 but did not go ahead.[tpl]cite news|author=Sweeney, Ken|date=22 November 2009|url=http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/nov/22/the-diary-ken-sweeney/|title= The Diary: Irish director makes leap of faith in casting for 'Eagle' biopic|work= Sunday Tribune|publisher= Tribune Newspapers[/tpl]
