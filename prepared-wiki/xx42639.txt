"Jump Jim Crow" is a song and dance from 1828 that was done in blackface by white comedian Thomas Dartmouth (T.D.) "Daddy" Rice. The first song sheet edition appeared in the early 1830s, published by E. Riley. The number was supposedly inspired by the song and dance of a crippled African slave named Jim Cuff or Jim Crow, who is variously claimed to have resided in St. Louis, Cincinnati, or Pittsburgh.[ref]
, see pages 137-138[/ref] The song became a great 19th century hit and Rice performed all over the country as "Daddy Jim Crow".
"Jump Jim Crow" was a key initial step in a tradition of popular music in the United States that was based on the imitation of African-Americans. The first song sheet edition appeared in the early 1830s, published by E. Riley. A couple of decades would see the mockery genre explode in popularity with the rise of the minstrel show.  It was also the initial step in the extant tradition in popular music of incorporating African styles and subject matter.
The tune became very well known not only in the United States but internationally; in 1841 the US ambassador to Central America, John Lloyd Stephens, wrote that upon his arrival in Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico, the local brass band played "Jump Jim Crow" under the mistaken impression that it was the US national anthem.
As a result of Rice's fame, the term Jim Crow had become a pejorative meaning African American by 1838Woodward, C. Vann and McFeely, William S. The Strange Career of Jim Crow. 2001, page 7, ISBN 978-0-19-514690-5 and from this the laws of racial segregation became known as Jim Crow laws.
The expression to jump Jim Crow came to mean "to act like a stereotyped stage caricature of a black person".  See Uncle Tom.

==Lyrics==

The song originally printed used 'floating verses', which appear in altered forms in other popular folk songs. The chorus of the song is closely related to the traditional Uncle Joe / Hop High Ladies; some folklorists consider Jim Crow and Uncle Joe to be a single, continuous family of songs.Alternative lyrics at Blugrassmessenger.com

==Variants==

As he extended it from a single song into an entire minstrel revue, Rice routinely wrote additional verses for "Jump Jim Crow". Published versions from the period run as long as 66 verses; one extant version of the song, as archived by American Memory includes 150 verses.Alternative lyrics at Blugrassmessengers.com Verses range from the boastful doggerel of the original version, to an endorsement of President Andrew Jackson (known as "Old Hickory"); his Whig opponent in the 1832 election was Henry Clay:[tpl]Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=92–93[/tpl]
Other verses, also from 1832, demonstrate anti-slavery sentiments and cross-racial solidarity that were rarely found in later blackface minstrelsy:

==Origins==

Jim Crow was the name of a black character created by a white actor, Thomas Rice, in 1836. The actor would wear blackface make-up and sing and dance across the stage. The term "Jim Crow" therefore became used as an offensive term for African Americans.
The folk concept of a dancing crow predates the Jump Jim Crow minstrelsy and has its origins in the old farmer's practice of soaking corn in whiskey and leaving it out for the crows. The crows eat the corn and become so drunk they cannot fly, but wheel and jump helplessly near the ground where the farmer can kill them with a club."Sometimes he made the crows drunk on corn soaked in whiskey, and as they reeled among the hillocks, knocked them on the head", "A Legend of Crow Hill".

After partaking one such meal and getting pretty thoroughly corned, they will never return to it again.” The Old Farmers Almanac, 1864.
