The Brindley Water Mill is a water mill situated in the town of Leek, Staffordshire, England.
The current structure was built on the site of previous corn-grinding mills in 1752 by James Brindley. Owned now by the Brindley Mill Preservation Trust, they restored and now maintain and operate it as a working museum. The site also includes a small museum dedicated to Brindley's life and achievements.[tpl]cite web | title = Brindley Water Mill - history of the mill | url = http://www.brindleymill.net/htmlfiles/history.html | publisher = Brindley Mill Preservation Trust | accessdate = August 1, 2006 [/tpl]
