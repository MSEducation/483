Monaco Grand Prix known in Europe as Monaco Grand Prix: Racing Simulation 2 is a Formula one racing game for the Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and Dreamcast. It was released in 1999. The game is based on the Formula One World Championship, but does not have the licence to use drivers names, official cars, etc. (the licence was held by Video System at the time, who made F-1 World Grand Prix and F-1 World Grand Prix II). The game does however have a licence to use Formula One's official sponsors; Schweppes and Castrol among others[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]. This helps to add to the authenticity of the game.
The sequel to F1 Racing Simulation recreates the 1998 season, featuring 17 authentic tracks, 11 teams and cars with their 22 drivers. The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided. Telemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to Grand Prix 2, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which the player starts with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor for the players to create their own tracks.
