The shells of Discus rotundatus in the adult stage measure [tpl]convert|5.7|-|7|mm[/tpl] in diameter and [tpl]convert|2.4|-|6|mm[/tpl] in height.AnimalBase Shells are reddish brown with darker cross bands, flat and densely ribbed. The umbilicus is quite wide, reaching about 1/3 of the shell diameter. 
Among the species of Discus in Europe and North America, Discus rotundatus is recognized by the alternating pattern of reddish brown spots, tight coiling of the whorls and broad and shallow umbilicus.
The body of this gastropod is bluish black on the upperside, while the lower side is greyish white. They mainly feed on plant debris, humus, algae and fungi.

Usually they lay 20-50 eggs in rotting wood or below decaying leaves. Eggs are white and flattened, measure about 1 mm and hatch after 10–30 days. These gastropods reach their maturity only in the second or third season and can live 2–3 years.

The species has been introduced to Canada and the USA, and has become established in a few places. It does not appear to have the capability to become an invasive pest species in North American, as it lives in leaf litter and forms colonies where the individuals do not tend to spread widely.

==Habitat==

These gastropods live in forests and humid shady places, in dead wood logs, under stones, on humus and in soil litter, sometimes in colonies, at an elevation of [tpl]convert|0|-|2100|m[/tpl] above sea level.
