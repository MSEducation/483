The Rush Line Corridor is a transport corridor and proposed commuter rail service that will run from Union Depot in downtown Saint Paul to Hinckley, Minnesota. It roughly follows the path of U.S. Route 61 and Interstate 35. Along with the Red Rock Corridor in the southeast and the Southwest Corridor in the southwest metro, it is considered a "Tier Two" commuter rail project with scheduled implementation after 2020.[tpl]Citation| title=2030 Transportation Policy Plan| publisher=Metropolitan Council| origyear=2004|date=January 2009| chapter=Chapter 7 – Transit| chapterurl=http://www.metrocouncil.org/planning/transportation/TPP/2008/Ch7Transit.pdf| url=http://www.metrocouncil.org/planning/transportation/TPP/2008/index.htm| [/tpl] Efforts to improve the corridor are coordinated by the Rush Line Corridor Task Force, formed in 1999 and composed of 22 elected officials from counties and municipalities along the corridor.
Commuter rail costs are expected to be high if implemented, due to the multiple railroads operating the tracks, additionally some sections of rail would have to be rebuilt on county-owned abandoned rights-of-way.[tpl]Cite web| title=2030 Transit Master Study: Twin Cities Metropolitan Area| publisher=Metropolitan Council| date=August 8, 2008| url=http://www.metrocouncil.org/planning/transportation/tpp/2008/TMSReport.pdf| format=pdf| accessdate=June 10, 2010[/tpl] Existing rail is a combination of Class I and Class III railroads.[tpl]Cite web| title=Rush Line Corridor 2008 Annual Report| publisher=Ramsey County Regional Rail Authority| date=January 2009| url=http://www.rushline.org/Docs/2008%20Rush%20Line%20Annual%20Report.pdf| format=pdf| accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl] Despite a relatively high population density, projected ridership is lower than originally anticipated because commuters are split in their final destination, mostly downtown Saint Paul or downtown Minneapolis. If built, it could connect with the proposed Northern Lights Express in Hinckley and provide a more direct link between Saint Paul and Duluth.

==Alternatives==

Alternatives to commuter rail have been presented, including the implementation bus rapid transit throughout the corridor or light rail in the Ramsey County portion, from Union Depot to White Bear Lake.[tpl]Cite web| last=Rogers| first=Mike| title=Rush Line Corridor Alternatives Analysis Fact Sheet| publisher=Ramsey County Regional Rail Authority| date=June 2009| url=http://www.rushline.org/Docs/2009%20Rush%20Line%20Handout%20Flyer.pdf| format=pdf| accessdate=June 5, 2010[/tpl] Despite having significantly lower operating costs than commuter rail, light rail would require taking lanes on East Seventh Street in downtown Saint Paul, additionally track right of way would run close to residential structures.
Currently,[tpl]when|date=November 2013[/tpl] the Ramsey and Washington county portions of the corridor are served by local Metro Transit bus routes. In September 2009, the Metropolitan Council awarded $3.4 million to extend the existing park and ride facilities at Maplewood Mall.[tpl]Cite news| title=Council allocates funding to transit corridors| newspaper=Transportation - October 2009 (Newsletter)| publisher=Metropolitan Council| date=January 15, 2010| url=http://www.metrocouncil.org/directions/transit/transit2009/BondingOct09.htm| accessdate=June 10, 2010[/tpl] In September 2010, a commuter bus service is expected to begin service in the corridor. Originating from Columbus and Forest Lake, the route is planning a stop in White Bear Township en route to multiple stops in downtown Saint Paul before terminating at Union Depot. Ridership is expected at 200 persons a day. The Rush Line Task Force and the Metropolitan Council are looking for access to county and federal funds to cover capital costs.[tpl]Cite news| last=Buchan| first=Cliff| title=Rush Line bus service eyes September start| newspaper=Forest Lake Times| publisher=ECM Publisher, Inc.| date=June 2, 2010| url=http://forestlaketimes.com/content/view/5085/1/| accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl]
