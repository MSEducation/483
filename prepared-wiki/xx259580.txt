Laserdance was a Dutch spacesynth-project that was popular in the 1980s with hits such as "Laserdance", "Power Run" and "Humanoid Invasion". Group members were composer Michiel van der Kuy and producer Erik van Vliet. Michiel van der Kuy's first track for Laserdance was "Goody's Return" in 1984, which was influenced by the demise of the Goody record label. After his first release, Michiel developed his sound further on Laserdance's first LP Future Generation (1987), a concept-album, which became the milestone for the spacesynth sound.
The song "Laserdance" was based upon the song "Laserdance" (1979) by the group Sponooch.
