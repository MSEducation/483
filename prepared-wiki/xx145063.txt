The Ventana Wilderness of Los Padres National Forest is a Federally designated wilderness area located in the Santa Lucia Mountains along the Central Coast of California. This wilderness was established in 1969 when the Ventana Wilderness Act abolished the [tpl]convert|55800|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] Ventana Primitive Area and replaced it with the [tpl]convert|98000|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] Ventana Wilderness. In 1978, the Endangered American Wilderness Act added [tpl]convert|61000|acre|km2[/tpl], increasing the total wilderness area to about [tpl]convert|159000|acre|km2[/tpl]. The California Wilderness Act of 1984 added about [tpl]convert|2750|acre|km2|0[/tpl]. In 1992, the Los Padres Condor Range and River Protection Act created the approximately [tpl]convert|14500|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] Silver Peak Wilderness and added about [tpl]convert|38800|acre|km2[/tpl] to the Ventana Wilderness.
The bill also designated the Big Sur River as a wild and scenic river. Most recently, the Big Sur Wilderness and Conservation Act of 2002 expanded the wilderness for the fifth time, adding nearly [tpl]convert|35000|acre|km2[/tpl], increasing the total acreage of the wilderness to its present size of [tpl]convert|240026|acre|km2|0[/tpl].[tpl]cite journal |url=http://www.ventanawild.org/news/se03/index.html |title=A Brief Land Status History of the Monterey Ranger District |edition=Fall 2002 |journal=Double Cone Quarterly |publisher=Ventana Wilderness Society |accessdate=June 22, 2010[/tpl] A very small part of it, [tpl]convert|736|acre|km2|0[/tpl], is located on Bureau of Land Management territory.

==Name origin==

The Ventana Wilderness is named for the unique notch called "The Window" on a ridge near Ventana Double Cone. According to local legend, this notch was once a natural stone arch.[tpl]cite web |title=Hiking in Big Sur |publisher=Big Sur Chamber of Commerce |url=http://www.bigsurcalifornia.org/hiking.html |accessdate=April 30, 2009[/tpl]

==Topography==

The topography of the Ventana Wilderness is characterized by steep-sided, sharp-crested ridges separating V-shaped youthful valleys. Most streams fall rapidly through narrow, vertical-walled canyons over bedrock or a veneer of boulders. Waterfalls, deep pools and thermal springs are found along major streams. Elevations range from [tpl]convert|600|ft|m[/tpl], where the Big Sur River leaves the Wilderness, to about [tpl]convert|5750|ft|m[/tpl] at the wilderness boundary near Junipero Serra Peak.

==Vegetation==

Marked vegetation changes occur within the Wilderness, attributable to dramatic climatic and topographic variations coupled with an extensive fire history.  Much of the Ventana is covered by dense communities of chaparral, a group of fire-prone plant species, consisting largely of chamise and various species of manzanita and ceanothus. Other plant communities found in area include oak woodland (Coast Live Oak, Valley Oak, etc.) and pine woodlands (Coulter Pine and Knobcone Pine). Poison oak is found throughout the area. Deep narrow canyons cut by the fast moving Big Sur and Little Sur rivers support stands of coastal redwood (some old growth), Big Leaf Maple, and Sycamore. Small scattered stands of the rare, endemic Bristlecone Fir may be found on rocky slopes and canyon bottoms. Mountain lion, bear, deer, fox and coyotes range the wilderness, as does the California condor, reintroduced to the region by the Ventana Wildlife Society.

==Human use==

thumb|Pico BlancoThe area was first occupied by the Esselen American Indians who followed local food sources seasonally, living near the coast in winter, where they harvested rich stocks of mussels, abalone and other sea life. In the summer and fall they moving inland to harvest acorns gathered from the Black Oak, Canyon Live Oak and Tanbark Oak, primarily on upper slopes in areas on the upper slopes of the steep canyons.[tpl]cite book|last=Henson|first=Paul|others=Donald J.

Pico Blanco, which splits the north and south forks of the Little Sur River, was sacred in the native traditions of the Rumsien and the Esselen, who revered the mountain as a sacred place from which all life originated.[tpl]cite book|last=Elliot|first= Analise |title=Hiking & Backpacking Big Sur: A Complete Guide to the Trails of Big Sur |publisher=Wilderness Press|date=January 2005|pages=323|isbn=0-89997-326-4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=748WcMN8NsMC[/tpl] The Spanish mission system led to the virtual destruction of the Indian population. Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. Alfred L. Kroeber suggests a 1770 population for the Esselen of 500.Kroeber, p.883 Sherburne F. Cook raises this estimate to 750.Cook, p.186 A more recent calculation (based on baptism records and density) is that they numbered 1,185-1,285.Breschini & Haversat
During the 1930s, the United States Civilian Conservation Corp constructed an extensive network of trails and trailheads that provide access to the Wilderness. The Pine Ridge trailhead at Big Sur Station near Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park is by far the most popular starting point.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] Other trailheads include Bottchers Gap, Los Padres Dam, China Camp, and Arroyo Seco.  Much of the area is very rugged and trails within the Wilderness are frequently overgrown and challenging to follow. Off-trail travel can be extremely difficult due to the steep, unstable terrain, and dense vegetation, like Madrone, manzanita, and Ceanothus. As is the case in most designated Wilderness areas, motorized equipment and mechanized transport are not allowed. Hunting of feral pigs (Sus scrofa) or European boar, which were introduced into the Carmel Valley area in 1927,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ventanawild.org/aboutus/where-we-stand/182-ventana-wilderness-alliance-hunting-and-fishing-policy-.html |publisher=Ventana Wilderness Society |title=Ventana Wilderness Alliance Hunting And Fishing Policy |date=27 May 2004 |accessdate=2009-11-01[/tpl] is permitted by license.
