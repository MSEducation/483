CreateDebate changed hands in December of 2010.  The new owner operates the site from Illinois.

==Functionality==

The CreateDebate platform runs on a structure that intends to allow users to see what are, in theory, the most convincing arguments within each debate, and which side of a debate has the most popular support.  
Users are allowed to create three types of debates around any topic. Other users then post responses, referred to as "arguments". The CreateDebate community then votes the arguments "up" or "down". In theory, over time, the arguments that the community perceives as the most convincing rise to the top of the debate, which distills out the central points and most relevant factors.  CreateDebate categorizes debates into various topics including: Politics, Technology, Shopping, Religion, Travel, Science, World, Sports, Business, and Comedy, although users are allowed to create debates about any topic they are interested in.  The creator of the debate, referred to as the "Debate Moderator", chooses the title, information, category, and end date of the debate, and has the power to ban users from the debate.  
Each user has a user profile, which automatically builds itself over time. There are several relationships, referred to as "Allies", "Enemies", and "Hostiles". http://www.createdebate.com/about/faq Debate and arguments activity is also automatically tracked.  A points system rewards users for certain activities on the site. http://www.createdebate.com/about/faq The research feature allows people to pipe RSS content from the web into any debate.

===Debate Types===

There are currently three types of debates available for creation on the site; the 2-Sided Debate, the Perspective Debate, and the Challenge Debate.  The 2-Sided Debate Consists of two different columns, each representing a viewpoint pertinent to the motion. These "sides" are expressed as the debate creator sees fit, but mostly fall into the categories Yes/Agree and No/Disagree, relative to the motion. The default argument tags in a 2-sided debate are identical to the side the user posts their argument on, though new tags can be created at users' discretion.  A Perspective style debate allows for more than two viewpoints and includes only one column for all arguments. The Challenge Debate is similar to a 2-Sided Debate, but only 2 users can participate.  In the three types of debate, the creator of the debate, referred to as the "Moderator", can choose whether the debate will end at a specific point or continue indefinitely.

===Reception===

CreateDebate received generally favorable reviews from critics. 
Technology and social media blog Mashable praised the website as being a "worthwhile place in which to spend oneâ€™s argumentative energies", and called the website an "interesting invention". http://mashable.com/2008/04/29/createdebate-argument-made-easy-the-startup-review/
