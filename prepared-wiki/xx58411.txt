==Engineering interests==

Clarkson is passionate about engineering, especially pioneering work. In Inventions That Changed the World Clarkson showcased the invention of the gun, computer, jet engine, telephone and television. He has previously criticised the engineering feats of the 20th century as merely improvements on the truly innovative inventions of the Industrial Revolution. He cites the lack of any source of alternative power for cars, other than by "small explosions". In Great Britons, as part of a public poll to find the greatest historical Briton, Clarkson was the chief supporter for Isambard Kingdom Brunel, a prominent engineer during the Industrial Revolution credited with numerous innovations. Despite this, he also has a passion for many modern examples of engineering. In Speed and Extreme Machines Clarkson rides and showcases numerous vehicles and machinery. Clarkson was awarded an honorary degree from Brunel University on 12 September 2003, partly because of his work in popularising engineering, and partly because of his advocacy of Brunel.
In his book, I Know You Got Soul he describes many machines that he believes possess a soul. He cited the Concorde crash as his inspiration, feeling a sadness for the demise of the machine as well as the passengers. Clarkson was a passenger on the last BA Concorde flight on 24 October 2003. Paraphrasing Neil Armstrong he described the retirement of the fleet as "This is one small step for a man, but one huge leap backwards for mankind", and that the challenge of building Concorde had been a greater human feat than landing a man on the Moon.[ref]

He briefly acquired an English Electric Lightning F1A jet fighter XM172, which was installed in the front garden of his country home. The Lightning was subsequently removed on the orders of the local council, which "wouldn't believe my claim that it was a leaf blower", according to Clarkson on a Tiscali Motoring webchat. In fact, the whole affair was set up for his programme Speed, and the Lightning is now back serving as gate guardian at Wycombe Air Park (formerly RAF Booker).http://www.thunder-and-lightnings.co.uk/lightning/survivorspics1.html English Electric Lightning – Pictures – Survivors. Retrieved 27 April 2007.
In a Top Gear episode, Clarkson drove the Bugatti Veyron in a race across Europe against a Cessna private aeroplane. The Veyron was an £850,000 technology demonstrator project built by Volkswagen to become the fastest production car, but a practical road car at the same time. In building such an ambitious machine, Clarkson described the project as "a triumph for lunacy over common sense, a triumph for man over nature and a triumph for Volkswagen over absolutely every other car maker in the world."Time Online Bugatti Veyron – Utterly, stunningly, jaw droppingly brilliant, 27 November 2005 After winning the race, Clarkson announced that "It's quite a hollow victory really, because I've got to go for the rest of my life knowing that I'll never own that car. I'll never experience that power again."

==Cars==

===Ownership===

Clarkson owns or has owned:
Clarkson wanted to purchase the Ford GT after admiring its inspiration, the Ford GT40 race cars of the 1960s. Clarkson was able to secure a place on the shortlist for the few cars that would be imported to Britain to official customers, only through knowing Ford's head of PR through a previous job. After waiting years and facing an increased price, he found many technical problems with the car. After "the most miserable month's motoring possible," he returned it to Ford for a full refund. After a short period, including asking Top Gear fans for advice over the Internet, he bought back his GT. He called it "the most unreliable car ever made", because he was never able to complete a return journey with it.Top Gear, Season 8, Episode 1 7 May 2006 In 2006 Clarkson ordered a Gallardo Spyder and sold the Ford GT to make way for it. In August 2008 he sold the Gallardo because "idiots in Peugeots kept trying to race him in it".Jeremy Clarkson – "The Italian Job" DVD In October, he announced that he had sold his Volvo XC90. In January 2009, in a review of the car printed in The Times, he wrote: "I’ve just bought my third Volvo XC90 in a row and the simple fact is this: it takes six children to school in the morning."

===Likes===

Clarkson has spoken very highly of the Czech-made Škoda Yeti, calling it possibly the best car in the world; and used 20 minutes of a Top Gear episode putting the Yeti through a number of challenges to support his point.Clarkson drives a Skoda Yeti[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl], Top Gear, BBC Worldwide Ltd., Series 16, Episode 1|date=July 2011 Clarkson called the Brera, Alfa's latest sports car, "Cameron Diaz on wheels".Alfa Romeo Brera marketing video released at Autoblog. Retrieved 27 April 2007. Clarkson has expressed fondness for late-model V8 Holdens, available in the UK rebadged as Vauxhalls. Of the Monaro he said, "It's like they had a picture of me on their desk and said Australian accent 'Let's build that bloke a car!'" and "I can't believe it... I've fallen in love... with a Vauxhall!" Clarkson suffered two slipped discs that he attributed to driving the Monaro, which he described as being "back-breakingly marvellous"."Vauxhall Monaro VXR: It's back-breakingly marvellous", The Sunday Times Online, 10 July 2005.

===Dislikes===

One of Clarkson's most infamous dislikes was of the British car brand Rover, the last major British owned and built car manufacturer. This view stretched back to the company's time as part of British Leyland. Describing the history of the company up to its last flagship model, the Rover 75, he paraphrased Winston Churchill and stated "Never in the field of human endeavour has so much been done, so badly, by so many.", citing issues with the rack and pinion steering system. In the latter years of the company Clarkson blamed the "uncool" brand image as being more of a hindrance to sales than any faults with the cars. On its demise, Clarkson stated "I cannot even get teary and emotional about the demise of the company itself – though I do feel sorry for the workforce." Jeremy is also famous for his hatred for the Toyota Prius.
Clarkson is also well known for his criticism of Vauxhalls and has described Vauxhall's parent company, General Motors, as a "pensions and healthcare" company which sees the "car making side of the business as an expensive loss-making nuisance". Clarkson has expressed particular disdain for the Vauxhall Vectra, describing it as "One of my least favourite cars in the world. I've always hated it because I've always felt it was designed in a coffee break by people who couldn't care less about cars" and "one of the worst chassis I've ever come across". After a Top Gear piece by Clarkson for its launch in 1995, described by The Independent as "not doing GM any favours", Vauxhall complained to the BBC and announced, "We can take criticism but this piece was totally unbalanced."

==Controversy==

Clarkson's comments and actions have sometimes resulted in complaints from viewers, car companies, and national governments. In October 1998, Hyundai complained to the BBC about what they described as "bigoted and racist" comments he made at the Birmingham Motor Show, where he was reported as saying that the people working on the Hyundai stand had "eaten a dog" and that the designer of the Hyundai XG had probably eaten a spaniel for his lunch. Clarkson also allegedly referred to those working on the BMW stand as "Nazis", although BMW said they would not be complaining. In a later incident during a Top Gear episode broadcast on 13 November 2005, Clarkson, while talking about a Mini design that might be "quintessentially German", made a mock Nazi salute, and made references to the Hitler regime and the German invasion of Poland by setting the GPS system to Poland.[tpl]cite news | last = Hall | first = Alan | title = Germans up in arms over Clarkson's mocking Nazi salute |work=The Scotsman |location=UK | publisher=Johnston Press | date = 15 December 2005 | url = http://news.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=2408932005 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070603195501/http://news.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=2408932005 | archivedate = 3 June 2007 | accessdate =2 August 2006 | quote = Clarkson raised his arm Nazi-style as he spoke about the German company BMW's Mini. Then, mocking the 1939 invasion that triggered the Second World War, he said it would have a satellite navigation system "that only goes to Poland". Finally, in a reference to Adolf Hitler's boast that his Third Reich would last ten centuries, Clarkson said the fan belt would last for 1,000 years. The German government is said to be highly displeased: diplomats pointed out that, had Clarkson made the Nazi salute on German television, he could be facing six months behind bars as, joking or not, such behaviour is illegal under the country's post-war constitution. The German motoring press, initially sharply critical of Clarkson's constant anti-German diatribes, nowadays portrays him as a sore loser, i.e. someone who simply hasn't understood yet that English carmaking is as much a thing of the past as tophats and the colonial empire. | location=Edinburgh[/tpl]
In April 2007, he was criticised in the Malaysian parliament for having described one of their cars, the Perodua Kelisa, as the worst in the world, "its name was like a disease and suggested it was built in jungles by people who wear leaves for shoes". A Malaysian government minister countered, pointing out that no complaints had been received from UK customers who had bought the car.
While in Australia, Clarkson made disparaging remarks aimed at the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, in February 2009, calling him a "one-eyed Scottish idiot" and accused him of lying. These comments were widely condemned by the Royal National Institute of Blind People and also Scottish politicians who requested that he should be taken off air.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/feb/06/jeremy-clarkson-gordon-brown |title=Scottish politicians urge BBC to take Jeremy Clarkson off air over Gordon Brown jibes | Politics | guardian.co.uk |work=Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=16 December 2009 | first=Deborah | last=Summers | date=6 February 2009[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=December 2009[/tpl][ref]

He subsequently apologised for referencing Brown's monocular blindness, but insisted: "I haven't apologised for calling him an idiot."[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7873624.stm |title=Clarkson apologises for PM remark |publisher=BBC News |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=16 December 2009[/tpl]
In July 2009, Clarkson was reported to have called Prime Minister Brown "a silly cunt" during a warm-up while recording a Top Gear show. Although several newspapers reported that he had subsequently argued with BBC Two controller Janice Hadlow,Leigh Holmwood and Chris Tryhorn "Clarkson crashes into trouble with C-word attack on PM", The Guardian, 24 July 2009. who was present at the recording, the BBC denied that he had been given a "dressing down"."Clarkson in new Brown insult row ", BBC News, 25 July 2009 John Whittingdale, Conservative chair of the Culture Select Committee remarked: "Many people will find that offensive, many people will find that word in particular very offensive ... I am surprised he felt it appropriate to use it."
On 6 July 2010, Clarkson reportedly angered gay rights campaigners after he made a remark on Top Gear that did not get aired on the 4 July's episode. But guest Alastair Campbell wrote about it on Twitter. Clarkson apparently said he "Demanded the right not to get bummed". The BBC later said that they cut this remark out as they "edited down" the interview as it was too long to fit into the show.
His 4 September 2011 column for The Sun newspaper drew angry remarks[tpl]cite web|last=Gaskell |first=Simon |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2011/09/04/tv-motormouth-clarkson-under-fire-over-call-for-welsh-language-to-be-abolished-91466-29358957/ |title=Jeremy Clarkson under fire over call for Welsh language to be abolished |publisher=WalesOnline |date= |accessdate=18 January 2012[/tpl] in response to Clarkson's call to abolish the Welsh language: "I think we are fast approaching the time when the United Nations should start to think seriously about abolishing other languages. What’s the point of Welsh for example? All it does is provide a silly maypole around which a bunch of hotheads can get all nationalistic."
On 30 November 2011 while being interviewed on the BBC's The One Show, Clarkson commented on the UK's public sector strike that day, lauding the capital's empty roads. After mentioning the BBC's need for balance, he said, "I would take them outside and execute them in front of their families." The programme later apologised for his remarks, with further apologies issued by Clarkson and the BBC.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15993549|title=Jeremy Clarkson apologises over strike comment|publisher=BBC News|date=1 December 2011[/tpl] These remarks had attracted 21,335 complaints to the BBC within 36 hours; the BBC also received 314 messages of support for Clarkson.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15999234 |title=BBC News – Complaints over Clarkson One Show comments reach 21,000 |publisher=BBC News|date=2 December 2011 |accessdate=18 January 2012[/tpl]
Clarkson was criticised by the mental health charity Mind for his 3 December 2011 column for The Sun,  in which he described those who jump in front of trains as "Johnny Suicide" and argues that following a death, trains should carry on their journeys as soon as possible. He adds: "The train cannot be removed nor the line re-opened until all of the victim's body has been recovered. And sometimes the head can be half a mile away from the feet." ... "Change the driver, pick up the big bits of what's left of the victim, get the train moving as quickly as possible and let foxy woxy and the birds nibble away at the smaller, gooey parts that are far away or hard to find."[tpl]cite news|title=Jeremy Clarkson: Train Suicides Are 'Selfish' |publisher=Sky News HD |date=3 December 2011 |accessdate=17 April 2013 |url=http://news.sky.com/story/906447/jeremy-clarkson-train-suicides-are-selfish[/tpl]
On 12 January, the Indian High Commission lodged a formal complaint with the BBC over the "tasteless" antics of Clarkson's Top Gear Christmas special where he mocked India's culture and people. During the 90-minute special, which was aired twice over the Christmas break, Clarkson made a string of jokes about Indian food, clothes, toilets, trains and history.[tpl]cite news|author=Mark Sweney |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jan/12/jeremyclarkson-top-gear?INTCMP=SRCH |title=Top Gear special prompts complaint from Indian high commission |work=The Guardian|date=12 January 2012|accessdate=18 January 2012 |location=London[/tpl]
On an episode of Top Gear broadcast on 5 February 2012, Clarkson compared a Japanese car/camper van to a person with a growth on their face. A major UK charity that supports people with facial disfigurements, Changing Faces, complained to the BBC and Ofcom after Clarkson's remarks.[tpl]cite web|last=Dowell|first=Ben|title=Jeremy Clarkson's 'facial growth' comment prompts complaints|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/feb/10/jeremy-clarkson-facial-growth-comment-complaints|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 February 2012|date=10 February 2012[/tpl]

===Road safety===

Clarkson often discusses high speed driving on public roads, criticising road safety campaigns involving cameras and speed bumps. In 2002, a Welsh Assembly Member Alun Pugh wrote to BBC director general Greg Dyke to complain about Clarkson's comments that he believed encouraged people to use Welsh roads as a high speed test track. A BBC spokesman said that suggestions Clarkson had encouraged speeding were "nonsense". Clarkson has also made similar comments about driving in Lincolnshire.MSN.com News Jeremy Clarkson in new road safety row, 27 October 2005 As of 2004 Clarkson was reported as having a clean licence.[tpl]cite episode | title = Top Gear | episodelink = Top Gear (current format) |series = series 7, episode 4, Italian supercar for £10,000 challenge | serieslink = List of Top Gear episodes#Series 7 | airdate = 4 December 2005 | network = BBC Two[/tpl] In a November 2005 Times article, Clarkson wrote on the Bugatti Veyron, "On a recent drive across Europe I desperately wanted to reach the top speed but I ran out of road when the needle hit 240 mph," and "From the wheel of a Veyron, France is the size of a small coconut.

===Activities on Top Gear===

In 2004, the BBC apologised unreservedly and paid £250 in compensation to a Somerset parish council, after Clarkson damaged a 30-year-old horse-chestnut tree by driving into it to test the strength of a Toyota Hilux.BBC News – BBC stumps up for tree stunt, 21 February 2004 In December 2006 the BBC complaints department upheld the complaint of four Top Gear viewers that Clarkson had used the phrase "ginger beer" (rhyming slang for "queer") in a derogatory manner, when Clarkson picked up on and agreed with an audience member's description of the Daihatsu Copen as being a bit "gay".[tpl]cite web | title = ECU ruling: Top Gear, BBC Two | work=BBC Complaints | date = 15 December 2006 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/news/2006/12/15/39038.shtml | accessdate =18 December 2006 | quote = In this instance there was no editorial purpose which would have served to justify the potential offence, and the complaints were therefore upheld. |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070110205422/http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/news/2006/12/15/39038.shtml |archivedate = 10 January 2007[/tpl] The Top Gear: Polar Special was criticised by the BBC Trust for glamorising drink driving in a scene showing Clarkson and James May in a vehicle, despite Clarkson saying to the camera "And please do not write to us about drinking and driving, because I am not driving I am sailing." (as they were on top of international, frozen waters.)BBC News Top Gear rapped for alcohol use, 2 July 2008 They stated the scene "was not editorially justified" despite occurring outside the jurisdiction of any drink driving laws.
In November 2008, Clarkson attracted over 500 complaints to the BBC when he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes.Jeremy Clarkson sparks fresh BBC row The Times, 4 November 2008Staff writer (6 November 2008). "MP calls for Clarkson to lose job", BBC News Online. Retrieved 6 November 2008. The BBC stated the comment was a comic rebuttal of a common misconception about lorry drivers and was within the viewer's expectation of Clarkson's Top Gear persona. Chris Mole, the Member of Parliament for Ipswich, where five prostitutes were murdered in 2006, wrote a "strongly worded" letter to BBC Director-General Mark Thompson, demanding that Clarkson be sacked. Clarkson dismissed Mole's comments in his Sunday Times column the following weekend, writing, "There are more important things to worry about than what some balding and irrelevant middle-aged man might have said on a crappy BBC2 motoring show."Clarkson, Jeremy (9 November 2008).
