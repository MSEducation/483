Don't Tell Me and From the Top.

Red River Radio provides local news weekday mornings during Morning Edition. In 2005, news producer Kate Archer pioneered a community news-gathering effort called the Community Correspondent program in which residents of the community borrow equipment from the network to produce local stories for broadcast during the local newscasts.
Some of the programs aired on RRR are produced locally, at the KDAQ studio. For instance, Wally Derleth hosts Evening Jazz, featuring nights dedicated to big band, contemporary  and other sub-genres of jazz music. Other locally produced programs include Blues After Hours, hosted by John Ellis and Regional Symphony Broadcasts, hosted by Kermit Poling.Red River Radio Program Guide A previously-aired local program, Soul Review, dedicated to classic soul and R&B from the 1960s to the 1980s, was hosted by Eric Jenkins from 2008 to 2011.

Currently, these short radio segments include A Moment of Science, Get It Growing, Earth and Sky, History Matters, Eco Tech Minute, What Was I Thinking?, Dr. Archie McDonald's Commentary, The Big Picture With Alexandyr Kent, Stardate, and Spotlights.

==Station operation and development==

Like most public radio stations, RRR is funded primarily by its members.  Twice each year, the network conducts a membership campaign pledge drive to pay for programming and ongoing operational costs. For the past several pledge drives, RRR has met or exceeded its membership goals, and at the halfway point through fiscal year 2009 had recorded its best support ever, despite the uncertain economy. 
For over two decades, Red River Radio operated out of cramped quarters in a temporary building at the LSUS campus.  However, a separate funding campaign was launched in 2007 to construct a new building on campus, that would house production and on-air studios, as well as a small concert hall.KDAQ Needs New Home. LSUS Magazine, Premier Issue, Spring, 2007, pg.22. Keeping in step with technological advances in broadcasting, RRR was already sending out two of its signals via the new technology called HD Radio, by mid-2007.[ref]

The long-awaited move of the radio station into new facilities, located in a renovated building on the edge of the LSUS campus, was completed on December 5, 2012.The Day Draws Near: Our Move Is Near Completion. Red River Radio, November 29, 2012. Retrieved November 29, 2012.
