==Songs==

Two of the original Van Morrison songs included on the album, "My Lonely Sad Eyes" and "Hey Girl", can be seen as precursors to the poetic musings of Morrison's later Astral Weeks album, released in 1968. "My Lonely Sad Eyes" begins with the words, "Fill me my cup, and I'll drink your sparkling wine/Pretend that everything is fine, 'til I see your sad eyes."  The title implies that the sad eyes belong to the singer but the lyrics address the singer's love interest. The song "Hey Girl" has a pastoral feel to it, enhanced by the addition of flutes and in Brian Hinton's opinion is a "dry run for 'Cyprus Avenue'" from Astral Weeks. The cover version of Bob Dylan's "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue", is considered by author Clinton Heylin to be "that genuine rarity, a Dylan cover to match the original."[tpl]cite book|author=Heylin, C.|pages=134â€“135|year=2003|title=Can You Feel the Silence?

Like "Gloria" from the first LP, "I Can Only Give You Everything" was a popular song performed by a number of US garage bands around the country, and was covered by groups like The Iguanas, The Little Boy Blues, The MC5, The Ambertones an obscure garage band from San Jose, CA called The Heros. The song was also covered by English hitmakers The Troggs.
