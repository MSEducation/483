[[Elastography]]

CATEGORIES: Medical imaging

Elastography is a medical imaging modality that maps the elastic properties of soft tissue. This modality emerged in the last decade. It includes Ultrasound Elasticity Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Elasticity Imaging and Tactile Imaging.

==Ultrasound Elasticity Imaging==

The Ultrasound Elasticity Imaging can be subdivided into strain and shear wave Elasticity Imaging.

===Transient elastography===

Transient elastography is a 1D medical imaging modality based on mechanical tissue excitation and ultrasound measurements. Transient elastography uses a special probe that consists of an ultrasound transducer array mounted on the axis of a motor vibrator. The vibrator generates shear wave within the tissue, which is detected by pulse-wave ultrasound imaging in a manner similar to M-mode Doppler imaging[tpl]cite journal |author=Gomez-Dominguez E |title=Diagnosis of cirrhosis by transient elastography (FibroScan): a prospective study |journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=513-518 |year=2006 |doi=10.1136/gut.2005.069153 |author-separator=, |author2= E Chanteloup|author3= J Vergniol|author4= L Castéra|author5= B Le Bail|author6=  X Adhoute|author7=  J Bertet|author8=  P Couzigou|author9=  V de Lédinghen[/tpl]. It is used for liver assessment[tpl]cite journal |author=Ganne-Carrié N |title=Accuracy of liver stiffness measurement for the diagnosis of cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver diseases |journal=Hepatology |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=1511–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17133503 |doi=10.1002/hep.21420 |author-separator=, |author2=Ziol M |author3=de Ledinghen V |display-authors=3 |last4=Douvin |first4=Catherine |last5=Marcellin |first5=Patrick |last6=Castera |first6=Laurent |last7=Dhumeaux |first7=Daniel |last8=Trinchet |first8=Jean-Claude |last9=Beaugrand |first9=Michel[/tpl], for example, to diagnose cirrhosis.

===Strain Imaging===

Ultrasound Elasticity Imaging is used for breast examination with a number of high-resolution linear transducers.Mendelson EB, Chen J, Karstaedt P. Assessing tissue stiffness may boost breast imaging specificity. Diagnostic Imaging. 2009;31(12):15-17.

===Acoustic Radiation Force===

Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) Imaging is another imaging modality being researched to non-invasively characterize liver stiffness.[tpl]cite journal|pmc=2362504|title=Quantifying Hepatic Shear Modulus In Vivo Using Acoustic Radiation Force|year=2008|volume=34|issue=4|pmid=18222031|last1=Palmeri|first1=ML|last2=Wang|first2=MH|last3=Dahl|first3=JJ|last4=Frinkley|first4=KD|last5=Nightingale|first5=KR|pages=546–58|doi=10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2007.10.009|journal=Ultrasound in medicine & biology[/tpl]http://kathynightingalelab.pratt.duke.edu/research/liver_fibrosishttp://radiology.rsna.org/content/256/2/640.abstract
The key difference from transient elastography is that ARFI makes use of ultrasound beams to push the target tissue (called pushing beams), in additional to the conventional ultrasound beams for imaging (called tracking beams).

==Magnetic Resonance Elasticity Imaging==

Magnetic Resonance Elastography allows measurement of the propagation of shear waves in tissue using magnetic resonance imaging.Muthupillai R, Lomas DJ, Rossman PJ, et al.

==Tactile Imaging==

Tactile Imaging is a medical imaging modality that translates the sense of touch into a digital image. Tactile Imaging is used for imaging of the prostate,Weiss RE, Egorov V, Ayrapetyan S, Sarvazyan N, Sarvazyan A. Prostate mechanical imaging: a new method for prostate assessment.
