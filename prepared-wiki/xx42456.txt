Constantine X Doukas or Dukas, Latinized as Ducas ([tpl]lang-el|Κωνσταντίνος Ι΄ Δούκας[/tpl], Kōnstantinos X Doukas) (1006 – May 1067) was emperor of the Byzantine Empire from 1059 to 1067.

==Reign==

Constantine Doukas was the son of Andronikos Doukas, a Paphlagonian nobleman who may have served as governor of the theme of Moesia.  Addicted to endless debates about philosophy and theology,Canduci, pg. 271 Constantine gained influence after he married, as his second wife, Eudokia Makrembolitissa, was the niece of Patriarch Michael Keroularios.Kazhdan, pg. 504  In 1057, Constantine supported the usurpation of Isaac I Komnenos, gradually siding with the court bureaucracy against the new emperor's reforms.Kazhdan, pg. 504  In spite of this tacit opposition, Constantine was chosen as successor by the ailing Isaac in November 1059, under the influence of Michael Psellos.Norwich, pg. 337  Isaac abdicated, and on November 24, 1059, Constantine X Doukas was crowned emperor.Finlay, pg. 15
The new emperor quickly associated two of his young sons in power, Michael VII Doukas and Konstantios Doukas,Canduci, pg. 271 appointed his brother John Doukas as kaisar (Caesar), and embarked on a policy favorable to the interests of the court bureaucracy and the church.Kazhdan, pg. 504  Severely undercutting the training and financial support for the armed forces, Constantine X fatally weakened Byzantine defencesCanduci, pg. 271 by disbanding the Armenian local militia of 50,000 men at a crucial point of time, coinciding with the westward advance of the Seljuk Turks and their Turcoman allies.Norwich, pg. 341 Undoing many of the necessary reforms of Isaac I, he bloated the military bureaucracy with highly paid court officials and crowded the Senate with his supporters.Finlay, pg. 17
His decisions to replace standing soldiers with mercenariesNorwich, pg. 339 and leaving the frontier fortifications unrepaired led Constantine to become naturally unpopular with the supporters of Isaac within the military aristocracy, who attempted to assassinate him in 1061.Canduci, pg. 271 He also became unpopular with the general population after he raised taxes to try to pay the army.Kazhdan, pg. 504
Constantine lost most of Byzantine Italy to the Normans under Robert Guiscard,Canduci, pg. 271 except for the territory around Bari, though a resurgence of interest in retaining Apulia occurred under his reign, and he appointed at least four catepans of Italy: Miriarch, Maruli, Sirianus, and Mabrica. He also suffered invasions by Alp Arslan in Asia Minor in 1064, resulting in the loss of the Armenian capital,Norwich, pg. 342 and by the Oghuz Turks in the Balkans in 1065,Finlay, pg. 27 while Belgrade was lost to the Hungarians.Finlay, pg. 24 
Already old and unhealthy when he came to power, Constantine died on May 22, 1067. His final act was to demand that only his sons succeed him, forcing his wife Eudokia Makrembolitissa to take a vow not to remarry.Norwich, pg. 343
