The attack on Kolašin caused numerous political problems and diplomatic complications, which would later become known as the "Kolašin Affair" (Kolašinska afera). Disagreements were put aside with the engagement of diplomatic representatives of the Great Powers, who showed a great interest in the situation occurring in the Balkans.
