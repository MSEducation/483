A vector space is a mathematical structure formed by a collection of elements called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers, called scalars in this context. Scalars are often taken to be real numbers, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex numbers, rational numbers, or generally any field. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called axioms, listed below. An example of a vector space is that of Euclidean vectors, which may be used to represent physical quantities such as forces: any two forces (of the same type) can be added to yield a third, and the multiplication of a force vector by a real multiplier is another force vector. In the same vein, but in a more geometric sense, vectors representing displacements in the plane or in three-dimensional space also form vector spaces. Vectors in vector spaces do not necessarily have to be arrow-like objects as they appear in the mentioned examples: vectors are best thought of as abstract mathematical objects with particular properties, which in some cases can be visualized as arrows.
Vector spaces are the subject of linear algebra and are well understood from this point of view, since vector spaces are characterized by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. A vector space may be endowed with additional structure, such as a norm or inner product. Such spaces arise naturally in mathematical analysis, mainly in the guise of infinite-dimensional function spaces whose vectors are functions. Analytical problems call for the ability to decide whether a sequence of vectors converges to a given vector. This is accomplished by considering vector spaces with additional structure, mostly spaces endowed with a suitable topology, thus allowing the consideration of proximity and continuity issues. These topological vector spaces, in particular Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces, have a richer theory.
Historically, the first ideas leading to vector spaces can be traced back as far as 17th century's analytic geometry, matrices, systems of linear equations, and Euclidean vectors. The modern, more abstract treatment, first formulated by Giuseppe Peano in 1888, encompasses more general objects than Euclidean space, but much of the theory can be seen as an extension of classical geometric ideas like lines, planes and their higher-dimensional analogs.
Today, vector spaces are applied throughout mathematics, science and engineering. They are the appropriate linear-algebraic notion to deal with systems of linear equations; offer a framework for Fourier expansion, which is employed in image compression routines; or provide an environment that can be used for solution techniques for partial differential equations. Furthermore, vector spaces furnish an abstract, coordinate-free way of dealing with geometrical and physical objects such as tensors. This in turn allows the examination of local properties of manifolds by linearization techniques. Vector spaces may be generalized in several ways, leading to more advanced notions in geometry and abstract algebra.

==Introduction and definition==

The concept of vector space will first be explained by describing two particular examples:

===First example: arrows in the plane===

The first example of a vector space consists of arrows in a fixed plane, starting at one fixed point. This is used in physics to describe forces or velocities. Given any two such arrows, v and w, the parallelogram spanned by these two arrows contains one diagonal arrow that starts at the origin, too. This new arrow is called the sum of the two arrows and is denoted [tpl]nowrap|v + w[/tpl]. Another operation that can be done with arrows is scaling: given any positive real number a, the arrow that has the same direction as v, but is dilated or shrunk by multiplying its length by a, is called multiplication of v by a. It is denoted [tpl]nowrap|av[/tpl]. When a is negative, [tpl]nowrap|av[/tpl] is defined as the arrow pointing in the opposite direction, instead.
The following shows a few examples: if [tpl]nowrap|1=a = 2[/tpl], the resulting vector [tpl]nowrap|aw[/tpl] has the same direction as w, but is stretched to the double length of w (right image below). Equivalently 2w is the sum [tpl]nowrap|w + w[/tpl]. Moreover, [tpl]nowrap|1=(−1)v = −v[/tpl] has the opposite direction and the same length as v (blue vector pointing down in the right image).

===Second example: ordered pairs of numbers===

A second key example of a vector space is provided by pairs of real numbers x and y. (The order of the components x and y is significant, so such a pair is also called an ordered pair.) Such a pair is written as [tpl]nowrap|(x, y)[/tpl]. The sum of two such pairs and multiplication of a pair with a number is defined as follows:
and 

===Definition===

To qualify as a vector space, the set V and the operations of addition and multiplication must adhere to a number of requirements called axioms.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, p. 27[/tpl] In the list below, let u, v and w be arbitrary vectors in V, and a and b scalars in F.
These axioms generalize properties of the vectors introduced in the above examples. Indeed, the result of addition of two ordered pairs (as in the second example above) does not depend on the order of the summands:
Likewise, in the geometric example of vectors as arrows, [tpl]nowrap|1=v + w = w + v[/tpl], since the parallelogram defining the sum of the vectors is independent of the order of the vectors. All other axioms can be checked in a similar manner in both examples. Thus, by disregarding the concrete nature of the particular type of vectors, the definition incorporates these two and many more examples in one notion of vector space.
Subtraction of two vectors and division by a (non-zero) scalar can be defined as
When the scalar field F is the real numbers R, the vector space is called a real vector space. When the scalar field is the complex numbers, it is called a complex vector space. These two cases are the ones used most often in engineering. The most general definition of a vector space allows scalars to be elements of any fixed field F. The notion is then known as an F-vector spaces or a vector space over F. A field is, essentially, a set of numbers possessing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations.Some authors (such as [tpl]Harvard citations|last = Brown|year = 1991|nb=yes[/tpl]) restrict attention to the fields R or C, but most of the theory is unchanged over an arbitrary field. For example, rational numbers also form a field.
In contrast to the intuition stemming from vectors in the plane and higher-dimensional cases, there is, in general vector spaces, no notion of nearness, angles or distances. To deal with such matters, particular types of vector spaces are introduced; see below.

===Alternative formulations and elementary consequences===

The requirement that vector addition and scalar multiplication be binary operations includes (by definition of binary operations) a property called closure: that [tpl]nowrap|u + v[/tpl] and av are in V for all a in F, and u, v in V. Some older sources mention these properties as separate axioms.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = van der Waerden|year = 1993|nb = yes|loc=Ch. 19[/tpl]
In the parlance of abstract algebra, the first four axioms can be subsumed by requiring the set of vectors to be an abelian group under addition. The remaining axioms give this group an F-module structure. In other words there is a ring homomorphism f from the field F into the endomorphism ring of the group of vectors. Then scalar multiplication av is defined as [tpl]nowrap|(f(a))(v)[/tpl].[tpl]Harvard citations|last=Bourbaki|year=1998|nb=yes|loc=§II.1.1[/tpl]. Bourbaki calls the group homomorphisms f(a) homotheties.
There are a number of direct consequences of the vector space axioms. Some of them derive from elementary group theory, applied to the additive group of vectors: for example the zero vector 0 of V and the additive inverse −v of any vector v are unique. Other properties follow from the distributive law, for example av equals 0 if and only if a equals 0 or v equals 0.

==History==

Vector spaces stem from affine geometry, via the introduction of coordinates in the plane or three-dimensional space. Around 1636, Descartes and Fermat founded analytic geometry by equating solutions to an equation of two variables with points on a plane curve.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Bourbaki|year = 1969|nb = yes|loc = ch. "Algèbre linéaire et algèbre multilinéaire", pp. 78–91[/tpl] To achieve geometric solutions without using coordinates, Bolzano introduced, in 1804, certain operations on points, lines and planes, which are predecessors of vectors.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Bolzano|year = 1804|nb = yes[/tpl] This work was made use of in the conception of barycentric coordinates by Möbius in 1827.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Möbius|year = 1827|nb = yes[/tpl] The foundation of the definition of vectors was Bellavitis' notion of the bipoint, an oriented segment one of whose ends is the origin and the other one a target. Vectors were reconsidered with the presentation of complex numbers by Argand and Hamilton and the inception of quaternions and biquaternions by the latter.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Hamilton|year = 1853|nb = yes[/tpl] They are elements in R2, R4, and R8; treating them using linear combinations goes back to Laguerre in 1867, who also defined systems of linear equations.
In 1857, Cayley introduced the matrix notation which allows for a harmonization and simplification of linear maps. Around the same time, Grassmann studied the barycentric calculus initiated by Möbius. He envisaged sets of abstract objects endowed with operations.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Grassmann|year = 2000|nb = yes[/tpl] In his work, the concepts of linear independence and dimension, as well as scalar products are present. Actually Grassmann's 1844 work exceeds the framework of vector spaces, since his considering multiplication, too, led him to what are today called algebras. Peano was the first to give the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps in 1888.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Peano|year = 1888|nb = yes |loc = ch. IX[/tpl]
An important development of vector spaces is due to the construction of function spaces by Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Banach|year = 1922|nb = yes[/tpl] At that time, algebra and the new field of functional analysis began to interact, notably with key concepts such as spaces of p-integrable functions and Hilbert spaces.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Dorier|year = 1995|nb = yes[/tpl], [tpl]Harvard citations|last = Moore|year = 1995|nb = yes[/tpl] Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started making use of this concept.

==Examples==

===Coordinate spaces===

The most simple example of a vector space over a field F is the field itself, equipped with its standard addition and multiplication. More generally, a vector space can be composed of
n-tuples (sequences of length n) of elements of F, such as
A vector space composed of all the n-tuples of a field F is known as a coordinate space, usually denoted Fn. The case [tpl]nowrap|1=n = 1[/tpl] is the above mentioned simplest example, in which the field F is also regarded as a vector space over itself. The case [tpl]nowrap|1=F = R[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|1=n = 2[/tpl] was discussed in the introduction above.

===The complex numbers and other field extensions===

In fact, the example of complex numbers is essentially the same (i.e., it is isomorphic) to the vector space of ordered pairs of real numbers mentioned above: if we think of the complex number [tpl]nowrap|x + i y[/tpl] as representing the ordered pair (x, y) in the complex plane then we see that the rules for sum and scalar product correspond exactly to those in the earlier example.

===Function spaces===

Functions from any fixed set Ω to a field F also form vector spaces, by performing addition and scalar multiplication pointwise. That is, the sum of two functions f and g is the function [tpl]nowrap|(f + g)[/tpl] given by
and similarly for multiplication. Such function spaces occur in many geometric situations, when Ω is the real line or an interval, or other subsets of R. Many notions in topology and analysis, such as continuity, integrability or differentiability are well-behaved with respect to linearity: sums and scalar multiples of functions possessing such a property still have that property.e.g. [tpl]Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1993|loc = ch. XII.3., p. 335|nb = yes[/tpl]  Therefore, the set of such functions are vector spaces. They are studied in greater detail using the methods of functional analysis, see below. Algebraic constraints also yield vector spaces: the vector space Fx is given by polynomial functions:

===Linear equations===

Systems of homogeneous linear equations are closely tied to vector spaces.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|loc = ch. VI.3.|nb = yes[/tpl] For example, the solutions of 
|-
| style="text-align:right;"| a 
| + 
| 3b
| + 
| style="text-align:right;"| c
| = 0
|-
| 4a 
| + 
| 2b
| + 
| 2c
| = 0
|}
are given by triples with arbitrary a, [tpl]nowrap|1=b = a/2[/tpl], and [tpl]nowrap|1=c = −5a/2[/tpl]. They form a vector space: sums and scalar multiples of such triples still satisfy the same ratios of the three variables; thus they are solutions, too. Matrices can be used to condense multiple linear equations as above into one vector equation, namely
yields [tpl]nowrap|1=f(x) = a e−x + bx e−x[/tpl], where a and b are arbitrary constants, and ex is the natural exponential function.

==Basis and dimension==

Bases allow the introduction of coordinates as a means to represent vectors. A basis is a (finite or infinite) set [tpl]nowrap|1=B = {bi}i ∈ I[/tpl] of vectors bi, for convenience often indexed by some index set I, that spans the whole space and is linearly independent. "Spanning the whole space" means that any vector v can be expressed as a finite sum (called a linear combination) of the basis elements:
where the ak are scalars, called the coordinates of the vector v with respect to the basis B, and bik [tpl]nowrap|1=(k = 1, ..., n)[/tpl] elements of B. Linear independence means that the coordinates ak are uniquely determined for any vector in the vector space.
For example, the coordinate vectors [tpl]nowrap|1=e1 = (1, 0, ..., 0)[/tpl], [tpl]nowrap|1=e2 = (0, 1, 0, ..., 0)[/tpl], to [tpl]nowrap|1=en = (0, 0, ..., 0, 1)[/tpl], form a basis of Fn, called the standard basis, since any vector [tpl]nowrap|(x1, x2, ..., xn)[/tpl] can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these vectors:
The corresponding coordinates x1, x2, ..., xn are just the Cartesian coordinates of the vector.
Every vector space has a basis. This follows from Zorn's lemma, an equivalent formulation of the Axiom of Choice.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=Theorem 1.9, p. 43[/tpl] Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the existence of bases is equivalent to the axiom of choice.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Blass|year = 1984|nb=yes[/tpl] The ultrafilter lemma, which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or cardinality (cf. Dimension theorem for vector spaces).[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Halpern|year = 1966|nb = yes|loc=pp. 670–673[/tpl] It is called the dimension of the vector space, denoted dim V. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Artin|year = 1991|nb = yes|loc=Theorem 3.3.13[/tpl]
The dimension of the coordinate space Fn is n, by the basis exhibited above. The dimension of the polynomial ring Fx introduced above is countably infinite, a basis is given by 1, x, x2, ... A fortiori, the dimension of more general function spaces, such as the space of functions on some (bounded or unbounded) interval, is infinite.The indicator functions of intervals (of which there are infinitely many) are linearly independent, for example. Under suitable regularity assumptions on the coefficients involved, the dimension of the solution space of a homogeneous ordinary differential equation equals the degree of the equation.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Braun|year = 1993|nb = yes|loc=Th. 3.4.5, p. 291[/tpl] For example, the solution space for the above equation is generated by e−x and xe−x. These two functions are linearly independent over R, so the dimension of this space is two, as is the degree of the equation.
A field extension over the rationals Q can be thought of as a vector space over Q (by defining vector addition as field addition, defining scalar multiplication as field multiplication by elements of Q, and otherwise ignoring the field multiplication). The dimension (or degree) of the field extension Q(α) over Q depends on α. If α satisfies some polynomial equation
("α is algebraic"), the dimension is finite. More precisely, it equals the degree of the minimal polynomial having α as a root.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Stewart|year = 1975|nb = yes|loc=Proposition 4.3, p. 52[/tpl] For example, the complex numbers C are a two-dimensional real vector space, generated by 1 and the imaginary unit i. The latter satisfies i2 + 1 = 0, an equation of degree two. Thus, C is a two-dimensional R-vector space (and, as any field, one-dimensional as a vector space over itself, C). If α is not algebraic, the dimension of Q(α) over Q is infinite. For instance, for α = π there is no such equation, in other words π is transcendental.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Stewart|year = 1975|nb = yes|loc=Theorem 6.5, p. 74[/tpl]

==Linear maps and matrices==

The relation of two vector spaces can be expressed by linear map or linear transformation. They are functions that reflect the vector space structure—i.e., they preserve sums and scalar multiplication:
An isomorphism is a linear map [tpl]nowrap|f : V → W[/tpl] such that there exists an inverse map [tpl]nowrap|g : W → V[/tpl], which is a map such that the two possible compositions [tpl]nowrap|f ∘ g : W → W[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|g ∘ f : V → V[/tpl] are identity maps. Equivalently, f is both one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective).[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. IV.4, Corollary, p. 106[/tpl]  If there exists an isomorphism between V and W, the two spaces are said to be isomorphic; they are then essentially identical as vector spaces, since all identities holding in V are, via f, transported to similar ones in W, and vice versa via g.
For example, the "arrows in the plane" and "ordered pairs of numbers" vector spaces in the introduction are isomorphic: a planar arrow v departing at the origin of some (fixed) coordinate system can be expressed as an ordered pair by considering the x- and y-component of the arrow, as shown in the image at the right. Conversely, given a pair (x, y), the arrow going by x to the right (or to the left, if x is negative), and y up (down, if y is negative) turns back the arrow v.
Linear maps V → W between two fixed vector spaces form a vector space HomF(V, W), also denoted L(V, W).[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=Example IV.2.6[/tpl] The space of linear maps from V to F is called the dual vector space, denoted V∗.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. VI.6[/tpl] Via the injective natural map [tpl]nowrap|V → V∗∗[/tpl], any vector space can be embedded into its bidual; the map is an isomorphism if and only if the space is finite-dimensional.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Halmos|year =1974|nb = yes|loc=p. 28, Ex. 9[/tpl]
Once a basis of V is chosen, linear maps [tpl]nowrap|f : V → W[/tpl] are completely determined by specifying the images of the basis vectors, because any element of V is expressed uniquely as a linear combination of them.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=Theorem IV.2.1, p. 95[/tpl] If [tpl]nowrap|1=dim V = dim W[/tpl], a 1-to-1 correspondence between fixed bases of V and W gives rise to a linear map that maps any basis element of V to the corresponding basis element of W. It is an isomorphism, by its very definition.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=Th. 2.5 and 2.6, p. 49[/tpl] Therefore, two vector spaces are isomorphic if their dimensions agree and vice versa. Another way to express this is that any vector space is completely classified (up to isomorphism) by its dimension, a single number. In particular, any n-dimensional F-vector space V is isomorphic to Fn. There is, however, no "canonical" or preferred isomorphism; actually an isomorphism [tpl]nowrap|φ : Fn → V[/tpl] is equivalent to the choice of a basis of V, by mapping the standard basis of Fn to V, via φ. The freedom of choosing a convenient basis is particularly useful in the infinite-dimensional context, see below.

===Matrices===

Matrices are a useful notion to encode linear maps.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. V.1[/tpl]  They are written as a rectangular array of scalars as in the image at the right. Any m-by-n matrix A gives rise to a linear map from Fn to Fm, by the following
or, using the matrix multiplication of the matrix A with the coordinate vector x:
Moreover, after choosing bases of V and W, any linear map [tpl]nowrap|f : V → W[/tpl] is uniquely represented by a matrix via this assignment.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. V.3., Corollary, p. 106[/tpl]
The determinant det (A) of a square matrix A is a scalar that tells whether the associated map is an isomorphism or not: to be so it is sufficient and necessary that the determinant is nonzero.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=Theorem VII.9.8, p. 198[/tpl] The linear transformation of Rn corresponding to a real n-by-n matrix is orientation preserving if and only if its determinant is positive.

===Eigenvalues and eigenvectors===

Endomorphisms, linear maps [tpl]nowrap|f : V → V[/tpl], are particularly important since in this case vectors v can be compared with their image under f, f(v). Any nonzero vector v satisfying [tpl]nowrap|1=λv = f(v)[/tpl], where λ is a scalar, is called an eigenvector of f with eigenvalue λ.The nomenclature derives from German "eigen", which means own or proper.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 8, p. 135–156[/tpl] Equivalently, v is an element of the kernel of the difference [tpl]nowrap|f − λ  · Id[/tpl] (where Id is the identity map [tpl]nowrap|V → V)[/tpl]. If V is finite-dimensional, this can be rephrased using determinants: f having eigenvalue λ is equivalent to
By spelling out the definition of the determinant, the expression on the left hand side can be seen to be a polynomial function in λ, called the characteristic polynomial of f.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. IX.4[/tpl]  If the field F is large enough to contain a zero of this polynomial (which automatically happens for F algebraically closed, such as [tpl]nowrap|1=F = C[/tpl]) any linear map has at least one eigenvector. The vector space V may or may not possess an eigenbasis, a basis consisting of eigenvectors. This phenomenon is governed by the Jordan canonical form of the map.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 8, p. 140[/tpl]. See also Jordan–Chevalley decomposition. The set of all eigenvectors corresponding to a particular eigenvalue of f forms a vector space known as the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue (and f) in question. To achieve the spectral theorem, the corresponding statement in the infinite-dimensional case, the machinery of functional analysis is needed, see below.

==Basic constructions==

In addition to the above concrete examples, there are a number of standard linear algebraic constructions that yield vector spaces related to given ones. In addition to the definitions given below, they are also characterized by universal properties, which determine an object X by specifying the linear maps from X to any other vector space.

===Subspaces and quotient spaces===

A nonempty subset W of a vector space V that is closed under addition and scalar multiplication (and therefore contains the 0-vector of V) is called a subspace of V.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, p. 29[/tpl] Subspaces of V are vector spaces (over the same field) in their own right.  The intersection of all subspaces containing a given set S of vectors is called its span, and is the smallest subspace of V containing the set S. Expressed in terms of elements, the span is the subspace consisting of all the linear combinations of elements of S.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, p. 35[/tpl]
The counterpart to subspaces are quotient vector spaces.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 3, p. 64[/tpl] Given any subspace [tpl]nowrap|W ⊂ V[/tpl], the quotient space V/W ("V modulo W") is defined as follows: as a set, it consists of [tpl]nowrap|1=v + W = {v + w, w ∈ W},[/tpl] where v is an arbitrary vector in V. The sum of two such elements [tpl]nowrap|v1 + W[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|v2 + W[/tpl] is [tpl]nowrap|(v1 + v2) + W,[/tpl] and scalar multiplication is given by [tpl]nowrap|1=a · (v + W) = (a · v) + W[/tpl]. The key point in this definition is that [tpl]nowrap|1=v1 + W = v2 + W[/tpl] if and only if the difference of v1 and v2 lies in W.Some authors (such as [tpl]Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes[/tpl]) choose to start with this equivalence relation and derive the concrete shape of V/W from this. This way, the quotient space "forgets" information that is contained in the subspace W.
The kernel ker(f) of a linear map [tpl]nowrap|f : V → W[/tpl] consists of vectors v that are mapped to 0 in W.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. IV.3.[/tpl] Both kernel and image [tpl]nowrap|1=im(f) = {f(v), v ∈ V} [/tpl] are subspaces of V and W, respectively.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 2, p. 48[/tpl] The existence of kernels and images is part of the statement that the category of vector spaces (over a fixed field F) is an abelian category, i.e. a corpus of mathematical objects and structure-preserving maps between them (a category) that behaves much like the category of abelian groups.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Mac Lane|year = 1998|nb = yes[/tpl] Because of this, many statements such as the first isomorphism theorem (also called rank–nullity theorem in matrix-related terms)
and the second and third isomorphism theorem can be formulated and proven in a way very similar to the corresponding statements for groups.
An important example is the kernel of a linear map [tpl]nowrap|x ↦ Ax[/tpl] for some fixed matrix A, as above. The kernel of this map is the subspace of vectors x such that [tpl]nowrap|1=Ax = 0[/tpl], which is precisely the set of solutions to the system of homogeneous linear equations belonging to A. This concept also extends to linear differential equations
In the corresponding map
the derivatives of the function f appear linearly (as opposed to f′′(x)2, for example). Since differentiation is a linear procedure (i.e., [tpl]nowrap|1=(f + g)′ = f′ + g ′[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|1=(c·f)′ = c·f′[/tpl] for a constant c) this assignment is linear, called a linear differential operator. In particular, the solutions to the differential equation [tpl]nowrap|1=D(f) = 0[/tpl] form a vector space (over R or C).

===Direct product and direct sum===

The direct product of vector spaces and the direct sum of vector spaces are two ways of combining an indexed family of vector spaces into a new vector space.

===Tensor product===

The tensor product [tpl]nowrap|V ⊗F W[/tpl], or simply [tpl]nowrap|V ⊗ W[/tpl], of two vector spaces V and W is one of the central notions of multilinear algebra which deals with extending notions such as linear maps to several variables. A map [tpl]nowrap|g : V × W → X[/tpl] is called bilinear if g is linear in both variables v and w.  That is to say, for fixed w the map [tpl]nowrap|v ↦ g(v, w)[/tpl] is linear in the sense above and likewise for fixed v.
The tensor product is a particular vector space that is a universal recipient of bilinear maps g, as follows. It is defined as the vector space consisting of finite (formal) sums of symbols called tensors
subject to the rules 
These rules ensure that the map f from the [tpl]nowrap|V × W[/tpl] to [tpl]nowrap|V ⊗ W[/tpl] that maps a tuple [tpl]nowrap|(v, w)[/tpl] to [tpl]nowrap|v ⊗ w[/tpl] is bilinear. The universality states that given any vector space X and any bilinear map [tpl]nowrap|g : V × W → X[/tpl], there exists a unique map u, shown in the diagram with a dotted arrow, whose composition with f equals g: [tpl]nowrap|1=u(v ⊗ w) = g(v, w)[/tpl].[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=Th. 14.3[/tpl]. See also Yoneda lemma. This is called the universal property of the tensor product, an instance of the method—much used in advanced abstract algebra—to indirectly define objects by specifying maps from or to this object.

==Vector spaces with additional structure==

From the point of view of linear algebra, vector spaces are completely understood insofar as any vector space is characterized, up to isomorphism, by its dimension. However, vector spaces per se do not offer a framework to deal with the question—crucial to analysis—whether a sequence of functions converges to another function. Likewise, linear algebra is not adapted to deal with infinite series, since the addition operation allows only finitely many terms to be added. Therefore, the needs of functional analysis require considering additional structures. Much the same way the axiomatic treatment of vector spaces reveals their essential algebraic features, studying vector spaces with additional data abstractly turns out to be advantageous, too.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl]
A first example of an additional datum is an order ≤, a token by which vectors can be compared.[tpl]Harvard citations|last1 = Schaefer|last2=Wolff|year = 1999|loc = pp. 204–205|nb = yes[/tpl] For example, n-dimensional real space Rn can be ordered by comparing its vectors componentwise. Ordered vector spaces, for example Riesz spaces, are fundamental to Lebesgue integration, which relies on the ability to express a function as a difference of two positive functions
where f+ denotes the positive part of f and f− the negative part.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Bourbaki|year = 2004|nb = yes|loc=ch. 2, p. 48[/tpl]

===Normed vector spaces and inner product spaces===

Coordinate space Fn can be equipped with the standard dot product:
In R2, this reflects the common notion of the angle between two vectors x and y, by the law of cosines:

===Topological vector spaces===

Convergence questions are treated by considering vector spaces V carrying a compatible topology, a structure that allows one to talk about elements being close to each other.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes[/tpl][tpl]Harvard citations|last = Bourbaki|year = 1987|nb = yes[/tpl] Compatible here means that addition and scalar multiplication have to be continuous maps.  Roughly, if x and y in V, and a in F vary by a bounded amount, then so do [tpl]nowrap|x + y[/tpl] and ax.This requirement implies that the topology gives rise to a uniform structure, [tpl]Harvard citations|last = Bourbaki|year = 1989|loc = ch. II|nb = yes[/tpl] To make sense of specifying the amount a scalar changes, the field F also has to carry a topology in this context; a common choice are the reals or the complex numbers.
In such topological vector spaces one can consider series of vectors.  The infinite sum
denotes the limit of the corresponding finite partial sums of the sequence (fi)i∈N of elements of V. For example, the fi could be (real or complex) functions belonging to some function space V, in which case the series is a function series. The mode of convergence of the series depends on the topology imposed on the function space. In such cases, pointwise convergence and uniform convergence are two prominent examples.
A way to ensure the existence of limits of certain infinite series is to restrict attention to spaces where any Cauchy sequence has a limit; such a vector space is called complete. Roughly, a vector space is complete provided that it contains all necessary limits. For example, the vector space of polynomials on the unit interval 0,1, equipped with the topology of uniform convergence is not complete because any continuous function on 0,1 can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of polynomials, by the Weierstrass approximation theorem.[tpl]harvnb|Kreyszig|1989|loc=§4.11-5[/tpl]  In contrast, the space of all continuous functions on 0,1 with the same topology is complete.[tpl]harvnb|Kreyszig|1989|loc=§1.5-5[/tpl] A norm gives rise to a topology by defining that a sequence of vectors vn converges to v if and only if
Banach and Hilbert spaces are complete topological vector spaces whose topologies are given, respectively, by a norm and an inner product. Their study—a key piece of functional analysis—focusses on infinite-dimensional vector spaces, since all norms on finite-dimensional topological vector spaces give rise to the same notion of convergence.[tpl]Harvard citations|last =Choquet|year = 1966|nb = yes|loc=Proposition III.7.2[/tpl] The image at the right shows the equivalence of the 1-norm and ∞-norm on R2: as the unit "balls" enclose each other, a sequence converges to zero in one norm if and only if it so does in the other norm. In the infinite-dimensional case, however, there will generally be inequivalent topologies, which makes the study of topological vector spaces richer than that of vector spaces without additional data.
From a conceptual point of view, all notions related to topological vector spaces should match the topology. For example, instead of considering all linear maps (also called functionals) [tpl]nowrap|V → W[/tpl], maps between topological vector spaces are required to be continuous.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes|loc=p. 34–36[/tpl] In particular, the (topological) dual space V∗ consists of continuous functionals [tpl]nowrap|V → R[/tpl] (or to C). The fundamental Hahn–Banach theorem is concerned with separating subspaces of appropriate topological vector spaces by continuous functionals.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Lang|year =1983|nb = yes|loc=Cor. 4.1.2, p. 69[/tpl]

====Banach spaces====

Banach spaces, introduced by Stefan Banach, are complete normed vector spaces.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes|loc=ch. 11[/tpl] A first example is the vector space ℓ p consisting of infinite vectors with real entries [tpl]nowrap|1=x = (x1, x2, ...)[/tpl] whose p-norm [tpl]nowrap|(1 ≤ p ≤ ∞)[/tpl] given by 
is finite. The topologies on the infinite-dimensional space ℓ p are inequivalent for different p. E.g. the sequence of vectors [tpl]nowrap|1=xn = (2−n, 2−n, ..., 2−n, 0, 0, ...)[/tpl], i.e. the first 2n components are 2−n, the following ones are 0, converges to the zero vector for [tpl]nowrap|1=p = ∞[/tpl], but does not for [tpl]nowrap|1=p = 1[/tpl]:
More generally than sequences of real numbers, functions [tpl]nowrap|1=f: Ω → R[/tpl] are endowed with a norm that replaces the above sum by the Lebesgue integral
The space of integrable functions on a given domain Ω (for example an interval) satisfying {{nowrap|[tpl]![/tpl]f[tpl]![/tpl]p p(Ω).The triangle inequality for |−|p is provided by the Minkowski inequality. For technical reasons, in the context of functions one has to identify functions that agree almost everywhere to get a norm, and not only a seminorm.  These spaces are complete.[tpl]Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes|loc=Theorem 11.2, p. 102[/tpl] (If one uses the Riemann integral instead, the space is not complete, which may be seen as a justification for Lebesgue's integration theory."Many functions in L2 of Lebesgue measure, being unbounded, cannot be integrated with the classical Riemann integral. So spaces of Riemann integrable functions would not be complete in the L2 norm, and the orthogonal decomposition would not apply to them. This shows one of the advantages of Lebesgue integration.", [tpl]Harvard citations|last = Dudley|year = 1989|nb = yes|loc=§5.3, p. 125[/tpl]) Concretely this means that for any sequence of Lebesgue-integrable functions [tpl]nowrap|f1, f2, ...[/tpl] with
