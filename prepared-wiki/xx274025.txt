Maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) is the value representing the highest level of negative pressure a person can generate on their own during an inhalation.[tpl]cite journal| author=Coast JR, Clifford PS, Henrich TW, Stray-Gundersen J, Johnson RL| title=Maximal inspiratory pressure following maximal exercise in trained and untrained subjects. | journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc | year= 1990 | volume= 22 | issue= 6 | pages= 811–5 | pmid=2287259 | doi= | pmc= | url= [/tpl] Represented by centimeters of water pressure (cmH2O) and measured with a manometer. Maximum inspiratory pressure is an important and noninvasive index of diaphragm strength and an independent tool for diagnosing many illnesses.[tpl]cite journal| author=Sachs MC, Enright PL, Hinckley Stukovsky KD, Jiang R, Barr RG, Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Lung Study| title=Performance of maximum inspiratory pressure tests and maximum inspiratory pressure reference equations for 4 race/ethnic groups. | journal=Respir Care | year= 2009 | volume= 54 | issue= 10 | pages= 1321–8 | pmid=19796411 | doi= | pmc= | url= [/tpl]
Typical maximum inspiratory pressures in adult males can be estimated from the equation, MIP = 142 - (1.03 x Age) cmH2O, where age is in years.http://thorax.bmj.com/content/39/7/535.full.pdf "Predicted normal values for maximal respiratory pressures in caucasian adults and children", SH Wilson, NT Cooke, RHT Edwards, SG Spiro
