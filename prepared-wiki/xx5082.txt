[[Jewish eschatology]]

CATEGORIES: Jewish eschatology

Jewish eschatology is concerned with events that will happen in the end of days, according to the Hebrew Bible and Jewish thought. This includes the ingathering of the exiled diaspora, the coming of Jewish Messiah, afterlife, and the revival of the dead Tsadikim.
Eschatology is the area of theology and philosophy concerned with the final events in the history of the world, the ultimate destiny of humanity, and related concepts.
In Judaism, end times are usually called the "end of days" (aḥarit ha-yamim, אחרית הימים), a phrase that appears several times in the Tanakh. The idea of a messianic age has a prominent place in Jewish thought, and is incorporated as part of the end of days.

==Overview and textual sources==

In Judaism, the main textual source for the belief in the end of days and accompanying events is the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible. In the Five Books of Moses, references are made in Deuteronomy 28-31, that the Jews will not be able to keep the Laws of Moses in the Land of Israel and will be subsequently exiled but ultimately redeemed. The books of the Hebrew Prophets elaborated and prophesied about the end of days.
In rabbinic literature, the Rabbis elaborated and explained the prophecies that were found in the Hebrew Bible along with the oral law and Rabbinic traditions about its meaning.[tpl]cite web|title=Jewish Eschatology|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5849-eschatology|work=Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate=1 May 2012[/tpl]
The main tenets of Jewish eschatology are the following, in no particular order, elaborated in the Books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel:
It is also believed that history will complete itself and the ultimate destination will be reached when all mankind returns to the Garden of Eden.[tpl]cite web|title=End of Days|url=http://www.aish.com/ci/a/48925077.html|work=End of Days|publisher=Aish|accessdate=1 May 2012[/tpl]

==Jewish messianism==

The Hebrew word mashiach (or moshiach) refers to the Jewish idea of the messiah. Like the English word messiah, mashiach means anointed. The Messiah is to be a human leader, physically descended from the Davidic line, who will rule and unite the people of IsraelMegillah 17b-18a, Taanit 8b and will usher in the Messianic AgeSotah 9a of global and universal peace. While the name of Jewish Messiah is considered to be one of the things that precede creation,The Personality of Mashiach; web-look-up: 18-11-2011. he is considered neither divine nor the return of Jesus, in contrast to Christianity.
In biblical times the title mashiach was awarded to someone in a high position of nobility and greatness. For example, [tpl]unicode|Cohen ha-Mašíaḥ[/tpl] means High Priest. In the Talmudic era the title mashiach or מלך המשיח, [tpl]unicode|Méleḫ ha-Mašíaḥ[/tpl] (in the Tiberian vocalization is pronounced [tpl]unicode|Méleḵ haMMāšîªḥ[/tpl]) and literally means "the anointed King". It is a reference to the Jewish leader and king that will redeem Israel in the end of days and usher in a messianic era of peace and prosperity for both the living and deceased.What is the Jewish Belief About Moshiach?; web-look-up: 03-10-2010.

===In the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible)===

Most textual requirements concerning the Messiah and his reign are in the Book of Isaiah, although aspects are mentioned in other prophets as well.

===In the Talmud===

The Babylonian Talmud, tractate Sanhedrin, contains a long discussion of the events leading to the coming of the Messiah, for example:

Throughout Jewish history Jews have compared these passages (and others) to contemporary events in search of signs of the Messiah's imminent arrival, continuing into present times. For example, many Orthodox Jewish leaders[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] have suggested that the devastation among Jews wrought by the Holocaust may represent a sign of hope for the Messiah's present imminent arrival.
The Talmud tells many stories about the Messiah, some of which represent famous Talmudic rabbis as receiving personal visitations from Elijah the Prophet and the Messiah. For example:

===In Rabbinic commentaries===

The Medieval rabbinic figure Maimonides (Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon), also known as the Rambam, wrote a commentary to tractate Sanhedrin stressing a relatively naturalistic interpretation of the Messiah and de-emphasizing miraculous elements. His commentary became widely (although not universally) accepted in the non- or less-mystical branches of Orthodox Judaism:[tpl]cite web|title=MOSES BEN MAIMON (RaMBaM; usually called MAIMONIDES):|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11124-moses-ben-maimon|work=Jewish Encyclopedia|accessdate=4 January 2014[/tpl]

====Advent of the messianic era====

According to the Talmud,Babylonian Talmud Rosh Hashana 31a and Sanhedrin 97a the Midrash,Pirke De Rabbi Eliezer, Gerald Friedlander, Sepher-Hermon Press, New York, 1981, p. 141. and the Kabbalistic work, the Zohar,Zohar (1:117a) and Zohar Vayera 119a the 'deadline' by which the Messiah must appear is 6000 years from creation. Orthodox and Hasidic Jews believe that the Hebrew calendar dates back to the time of creation; the year 2009-2010 (the Hebrew New Year begins during September or October) of the Gregorian calendar corresponds to the Hebrew year 5770.
There is a kabbalistic traditionZohar, Vayera 119a, Ramban on Genesis 2:3 that maintains that the seven days of creation in Genesis 1 correspond to seven millennia of the existence of natural creation. The tradition teaches that the seventh day of the week, Shabbat or the day of rest, corresponds to the seventh millennium (Hebrew years 6000 - 7000), the age of universal 'rest' - the Messianic Era.
The Talmud comments:
The Midrash comments:
"Six eons for going in and coming out, for war and peace. The seventh eon is entirely Shabbat and rest for life everlasting ".
The Zohar explains:
Elaborating on this theme are numerous early and late Jewish scholars, including the Ramban,Ramban on Genesis (2:3) Isaac Abrabanel,Abarbanel on Genesis 2 Abraham Ibn Ezra,Ramban quoting Ibn Ezra at Leviticus (25:2) Rabbeinu Bachya,Bachya on Genesis 2:3 the Vilna Gaon,Safra D'Tzniusa, Ch. 5 the Lubavitcher Rebbe,Sefer HaSichos 5750:254 the Ramchal,Derech Hashem 4:7:2 Aryeh Kaplan,[tpl]cite book|title=The Aryeh Kaplan - Anthology: Illuminating Expositions on Jewish Thought and practice|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=7vxjgVY33LkC&pg=PA318&lpg=PA318&dq=aryeh+kaplan+1840&source=bl&ots=2_mGLTFniN&sig=6dCWdOjPDl-YAyELmmdj-FBMHg0&hl=en&ei=GQo0TI6UOZSqcYaq0bsD&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=4 January 2014[/tpl] and Rebbetzin Esther Jungreis.[tpl]cite news|last=Fleisher|first=Malkah|title=Rebbetzin Jungreis: By the Year 6,000, Mashiach Has to be Here|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/128104#.Ush6XItS2pg|accessdate=4 January 2014|newspaper=Arutz 7[/tpl]

===Orthodox Judaism===

The belief in a personal Messiah of the Davidic line is a universal tenet of faith among Orthodox Jews and one of Maimonides' thirteen principles of faith.
Some authorities in Orthodox Judaism believe that this era will lead to supernatural events culminating in a bodily resurrection of the dead. Maimonides, on the other hand, holds that the events of the messianic era are not specifically connected with the resurrection. (See the Maimonides article.)

===Conservative Judaism===

Conservative Judaism varies in its teachings. While it retains traditional references to a personal redeemer and prayers for the restoration of the Davidic line in the liturgy, Conservative Jews are more inclined to accept the idea of a messianic era:

===Reform Judaism===

Reform Judaism generally concurs with the more liberal Conservative perspective of a future messianic era rather than a personal Messiah.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] Reflecting its philosophical position, Reform Judaism, unlike Conservative Judaism, has altered the traditional prayers to refer to "redemption" rather than a "redeemer" and removed petitions for restoration of the House of David.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]

==The days of the Messiah==

According to Jewish tradition, the messianic era will be one of global harmony, a future era of universal peace and brotherhood on earth, and one conducive to the furtherment of the knowledge of the Creator. In this context, the earliest meaning of the word "messianic" is derived from notion of Yemot HaMashiach meaning "the days of the Messiah", meaning "related to the Jewish Messiah". The Jewish Messiah ushering in an era of universal peace is given expression in two scriptural passages from the Book of Isaiah:
According to the Book of Jeremiah, Moab and Biblical Elam which were exiled during the Babylonian Exile, will be brought back from their captivity in the end of days.[tpl]cite book|title=Book of Jeremiah|pages=Chapters 48 and 49.[/tpl]
In the Book of Jeremiah, it is referenced by Jeremiah, who, speaking in the days of Josiah (Jer. 3:16), prophesied a future time, possibly the end of days, when the Ark will no longer be talked about or be made again:
Rashi comments on this verse that "The entire people will be so imbued with the spirit of sanctity that God's Presence will rest upon them collectively, as if the congregation itself was the Ark of the Covenant."[tpl]cite book|title=Jeremiah 3:16, Tanach|publisher=ArtScroll|location=Brooklyn, New York|page=1078[/tpl]

==Gog and Magog==

According to some commentators,[tpl]who|date=December 2012[/tpl] the war of Gog and Magog envisioned in Ezekiel 38 is expected to occur in the end of days. This is described to be a climactic war that is said to occur at the end of the Jewish exile. Radak comments on Zechariah 14, that in the end of days Jerusalem will be the battle ground of Gog and Magog.
According to other commentators[tpl]who|date=December 2012[/tpl] the long exile has already made up for it[tpl]clarify|date=December 2012[/tpl] and it will no longer occur.[tpl]cite web|title=What is Gog and Magog?|url=http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/227,2272972/What-is-Gog-and-Magog.html|work=What is Gog and Magog?|publisher=Ask Moses|accessdate=11 May 2012[/tpl]

=="The world to come"==

Although Judaism concentrates on the importance of the Earthly world (Olam Ha'zeh — "this world"), all of classical Judaism posits an afterlife. The hereafter is known as 'olam ha-baCraig L. Blomberg, Sung Wook Chung A case for historic premillennialism 2009 "In certain sources, Olam Ha-Ba is uniquely associated with teachings about collective redemption and resurrection, but in other places Olam Ha-Ba is conceived of as an afterlife realm for the individual."Elliot Kiba Ginsburg The Sabbath in the classical Kabbalah 1989 p145 "More frequently the Rabbis used 'olam ha-ba' with reference to the hereafter:" (the "world to come", עולם הבא in Hebrew), and related to concepts of Gan Eden (the Heavenly "Garden of Eden", or paradise) and Gehinom.They are told to live their life on earth to the full as their body will stay there but their soul live on.Jewish Afterlife Beliefs at SimpleToRemember.com[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/afterlife.html |title=Afterlife at |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm |title=Olam Ha-Ba: The Afterlife at |publisher=Jewfaq.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02[/tpl] According to religious Judaism, any non-Jew who lives according to the Seven Laws of Noah is regarded as a righteous gentile, and is assured of a place in the world to come, the final reward of the righteous.Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot M'lakhim 8:14Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, entry Ben Noah, end of article); note the variant reading of Maimonides and the references in the footnote

===Hebrew Bible===

The Hebrew Bible, at least as seen through interpretation such as Bavli Sanhedrin, contains frequent reference to resurrection of the dead.Jacob Neusner The Documentary History of Judaism and Its Recent Interpreters 2012 - Page 138 - "... tense in Scripture, proof of the resurrection is drawn from numerous passages: Exodus 15.1; Joshua 8.30; 1 Kings 11.7; Psalm 84.5; Isaiah 52.8; Deuteronomy 33.6; Daniel 12.2 and 12.13. The grave and womb in Proverbs 30.16 are likewise ...
The phrase 'olam ha-ba, (עולם הבא) "world to come", does not occur in the Hebrew Bible.

===Late Second Temple period===

In the late Second Temple period, beliefs about the ultimate fate of the individual were diverse. Pharisees believed in resurrection, while Essenes believed in the immortality of the soul, and Sadducees, apparently, believed in neither.ed. Jacob Neusner, Alan Jeffery Avery-Peck ''Judaism in Late Antiquity: Part Four: Death, Life-After-Death," 2000 Page 187 III. THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS 8. DEATH, RESURRECTION, AND LIFE AFTER DEATH IN THE QUMRAN THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS. chapter by Philip R. Davies University of Sheffield. "In the late Second Temple Period, beliefs about the ultimate fate of the individual were diverse. It is well-known that Josephus, in his description of the four Jewish "sects" (and supported by Matt. ... in the resurrection while the Pharisees did, and the Essenes subscribed to the doctrine of the immortality of the soul (War 2.154: "...although bodies are corruptible and their matter unstable, souls are immortal and live forever...")" The Dead Sea Scrolls, Jewish Pseudepigrapha and Jewish magical papyri reflect this diversity.

===Talmudic views===

The Mishnah (c. 200) lists belief in the resurrection of the dead as one of three essential beliefs necessary for a Jew to participate in it:

The Gemara (Berachos 18b) relates several stories of people who visited cemeteries and either overheard conversations among dead people or actually conversed with the dead themselves, and received information that was later verified as factually correct.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]
The Shem HaGedolim by Chaim Joseph David Azulai, (entry on Rebbe Eliezer bar Nosson), relates and discusses several incidents of dead Sages returning to our world to visit their families and friends.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]

===Medieval rabbinical views===

While all classic rabbinic sources discuss the afterlife, the classic Medieval scholars dispute the nature of existence in the "End of Days" after the messianic period. While Maimonides describes an entirely spiritual existence for souls, which he calls "disembodied intellects," Nahmanides discusses an intensely spiritual existence on Earth, where spirituality and physicality are merged. Both agree that life after death is as Maimonides describes the "End of Days." This existence entails an extremely heightened understanding of and connection to the Divine Presence. This view is shared by all classic rabbinic scholars.[tpl]cite web|last=Simcha Paull Raphael, Summary by Rabbi Dr. Barry Leff|title=Summary of Jewish Views of the Afterlife|url=http://www.neshamah.net/images/jewish-views-of-the-afterlife.pdf|work=The Neshamah Center|accessdate=4 January 2014[/tpl]
There is much rabbinic material on what happens to the soul of the deceased after death, what it experiences, and where it goes. At various points in the afterlife journey, the soul may encounter: Hibbut ha-kever, the pains of the grave; Dumah, the angel of silence; Satan as the angel of death; the Kaf ha-Kela, the catapult of the soul; Gehinom (purgatory); and Gan Eden (heaven or paradise). All classic rabbinic scholars agree that these concepts are beyond typical human understanding. Therefore, these ideas are expressed throughout rabbinic literature through many varied parables and analogies.
Gehinom is fairly well defined in rabbinic literature. It is sometimes translated as "hell", but is much closer to the Catholic view of purgatory than to the Christian view of hell, which differs from the classical Jewish view. Rabbinic thought maintains that souls are not tortured in gehinom forever; the longest that one can be there is said to be eleven months, with the exception of heretics, and unobservant Jews. This is the reason that even when in mourning for near relatives, Jews will not recite mourner's kaddish for longer than an eleven-month period. Gehinom is considered a spiritual forge where the soul is purified for its eventual ascent to Gan Eden ("Garden of Eden").[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/06-Jewish-Thought/ |title=soc.culture.jewish FAQ: Jewish Thought (6/12) |publisher=Faqs.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02[/tpl]

===In Orthodox Judaism===

Orthodox Judaism maintains the tenet of the bodily resurrection of the dead, including traditional references to it in the liturgy.[tpl]cite web|title=What Orthodox Jews Believe|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/2001/06/What-Orthodox-Jews-Believe.aspx|work=BeliefNet|accessdate=4 January 2014[/tpl]  In explaining the Orthodox view of the afterlife, Irving Greenberg, a Modern Orthodox rabbi, discussed both the "world to come" and the belief in punishment and reward in a Moment Magazine "Ask the Rabbis" forum:

===In Conservative Judaism===

Conservative Judaism has generally retained the tenet of the bodily resurrection of the dead, including traditional references to it in the liturgy. However, many Conservative Jews interpret the tenet metaphorically rather than literally.Emet Ve-Emunah: Statement of Principles of Conservative Judaism. Conservative Judaism both affirms belief in the world beyond (as referenced in the Amidah and Maimonides' Thirteen Precepts of Faith) while recognizing that human understanding is limited and we cannot know exactly what the world beyond consists of.

===Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism===

Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism have altered traditional references to the resurrection of the dead ("who gives life to the dead") to refer to "who gives life to all". Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism affirm belief in the afterlife, though they downplay the theological implications in favor of emphasizing the importance of the "here and now," as opposed to reward and punishment. Rabbi Laura Novak Winer, a member of the Union for Reform Judaism, explains the Reform attitude towards the afterlife by quoting Abraham Joshua Heschel:  True, this world is only a 'vestibule to the world to come,' where we must prepare ourselves before we enter the 'banquet hall.' Yet in the eyes of God, the endeavor and the participation are greater than the achievement and perfection. 
The "this world" orientation is not limited to the Reform and Reconstructionist movements. Orthodox Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, in expounding the Chabad view of the afterlife, also affirms the necessity of focusing on one's legacy, along with Chabad's traditional belief in bodily resurrection in the Messianic era:  ...none would dispute that a man's good acts live on as an eternal legacy after him, which is why Judaism has always emphasized the importance of positive action...just as the Talmud says the patriarch Jacob never died because his children continue the tradition he taught them, the same can be said of Martin Luther King Jr., whose commitment to racial harmony we continue to embrace, or of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, whose pioneering work in returning Jews to their heritage continues to influence every strand of world Jewry. 

==Reincarnation==

The notion of reincarnation, while held as a mystical belief by some, is not an essential tenet of traditional Judaism. It is not mentioned in traditional classical sources such as the Tanakh ("Hebrew Bible"), the classical rabbinic works (Mishnah and Talmud), or Maimonides' 13 Principles of Faith. While one might contend the idea of reincarnation is not outlined in the Tanakh, there exist references to resurrection throughout Isaiah. However, books of Kabbalah — Jewish mysticism — teach a belief in gilgul, transmigration of souls, and hence the belief is universal in Hasidic Judaism, which regards the Kabbalah as sacred and authoritative.
Among well-known Rabbis who rejected the idea of reincarnation are Saadia Gaon, David Kimhi, Hasdai Crescas, Yedayah Bedershi (early 14th century), Joseph Albo, Abraham ibn Daud and Leon de Modena. Among the Geonim, Hai Gaon argued with Saadia Gaon in favour of gilgulim.
Rabbis who accepted the idea of reincarnation include, from Medieval times: the mystical leaders Nahmanides (the Ramban) and Rabbenu Bahya ben Asher; from the 16th-century: Levi ibn Habib (the Ralbah), and from the mystical school of Safed Shelomoh Alkabez, Isaac Luria (the Ari) and his exponent Hayyim Vital; and from the 18th-century: the founder of Hasidism Yisrael Baal Shem Tov, later Hasidic Masters, and the Lithuanian Jewish Orthodox leader and Kabbalist the Vilna Gaon.
With the 16th-century rational systemisation of Cordoveran Kabbalah by the Ramak, and the subsequent new paradigm of Lurianic Kabbalah by the Ari, Kabbalah replaced "Hakirah" (Rationalistic Medieval Jewish Philosophy) as the mainstream traditional Jewish theology, both in scholarly circles and in the popular imagination. Isaac Luria taught new explanations of the process of gilgul, and identification of the reincarnations of historic Jewish figures, which were copiled by Haim Vital in his Shaar HaGilgulim.
In Kabbalistic understanding of gilgul, which differs from many Eastern-religious views, reincarnation is not fatalistic or automatic, nor is it essentially a punishment of sin, or reward of virtue. In Judaism, the Heavenly realms could fulfill Maimonides' Principle of faith in Reward and Punishment. Rather, it is concerned with the process of individual Tikkun (Rectification) of the soul. In Kabbalistic interpretation, each Jewish soul is reincarnated enough times only in order to fulfil each of the 613 Mitzvot. The souls of the righteous among the Nations may be assisted through gilgulim to fulfil their Seven Laws of Noah. As such gilgul is an expression of Divine compassion, and is seen as a Heavenly agreement with the individual soul to descend again. This stress on physical performance and perfection of each Mitzvah is tied to the Lurianic doctrine of Cosmic Tikkun of Creation. In these new teachings, a cosmic catastrophe occurred at the beginning of creation called the "Shattering of the Vessels" of the Sephirot in the "World of Tohu (Chaos)". The vessels of the Sephirot broke and fell down through the spiritual worlds until they were embedded in our physical realm as "sparks of holiness" (Nitzutzot). The reason in Lurianic Kabbalah that almost all Mitzvot involve physical action is that through their performance, they elevate each particular spark of holiness associated with that commandment. Once all the sparks are redeemed to their spiritual source, the Messianic Era begins. This metaphysical theology gives cosmic significance to the life of each person, as each individual has particular tasks that only they can fulfil. Therefore, gilgulim assist the individual soul in this cosmic plan. This also explains the Kabbalistic reason why the future eschatological Utopia will be in this world, as only in the lowest, physical realm is the purpose of creation fulfilled.
The idea of gilgul became popular in folk belief, and is found in much Yiddish literature among Ashkenazi Jews.

==The last judgment==

In Judaism, the day of judgment happens every year on Rosh HaShana, therefore the belief in a last day of judgment for all mankind is disputed. Some Rabbis hold that there will be such a day following the resurrection of the dead. Others hold that there is no need for that because of Rosh HaShana. While yet others hold that this accounting and judgment happens when one dies. Yet others hold that the last judgment only applies to the gentile nations and not the Jewish people.[tpl]cite web|title=Will there be trial and judgment after the Resurrection?|url=http://www.askmoses.com/en/article/215,2097883/Will-there-be-trial-and-judgment-after-the-Resurrection.html|work=Will there be trial and judgment after the Resurrection?|publisher=Askmoses.com|accessdate=2 May 2012[/tpl]
