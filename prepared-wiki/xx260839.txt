Insoumise (French: Librairie l'Insoumise) is an anarchist bookstore in Montreal, Canada.

==History==

From the late 1970s on, Alternative bookshop moved to and rented space at this location. The non-profit association (known by the acronym "AEELI") that presently owns the Insoumise bookstore was formed in 1982, and bought the building a year later, thus ensuring that a bookstore could continue without paying high downtown rents. 
From the 1990s on, the Alternative bookshop collective became the object of numerous criticisms for its management and its poor relations with certain groups and currents of anarchism in Montreal.International Communist Group, letter "Librairie Alternative", date yet unknown (90s), www.leftcom.org.

The Coalition was involved in a bitter struggle to bring about changes or oust Alternative from the bookstore space.Hour magazine, 26 Aug 2004, Meg Hewings, "It's Anarchy", Montreal, p. 5. http://www.hour.ca/news/news.aspx?iIDArticle=3978The Link, 14 Sept 2004, Gabriel Sigler, "Anarchy doesn't live here anymore", Montreal, Concordia University.
The bookstore's French name l'Insoumise means "The Insubordinate", a derogatory moniker given to Louise Michel by the powers that be; she was a French anarchist and participant in the Paris Commune.

The bookstore is self-managed by a bookstore committee (the comité libraire) mandated by the non-profit organisation.General Assembly of the AEELI, "Principles and Structures of the New Bookstore", 10 Aug 2004, Montreal.  http://aeeli.blogspot.com/p/principes-et-structures-de-la-nouvelle.html It is open to individual anarchists or anarchist distribution projects, through their delegates. Since 2004, the great majority of Montreal's anarchist distributors, writers or publishing projects have become active members, or leave their material on consignment.
In the same building as the bookstore, there is a lending library and reading room, the DIRA, which stands for Documentations, Informations, Références et Archives.
