Rollins-Crane wrote an essay refuting the idea that no sites in the United States deserved the serious attention of archaeologists, saying that La Casa Grande (today the Montezuma Castle National Monument) in Arizona did deserve this attention, and that even in the 16th century, the local native peoples had no tradition as to its builders.The Prehistoric Ruins of Casa Grande, Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine, Volume 36, Issue 214
It was also during this time that Rollins-Crane became a devotee of Chinese herbal medicine as an alternative to surgical procedures.FROM THE FROZEN NORTH: Alice Rollins-Crane's Experience. Los Angeles Herald, February 12, 1899

==Time in Alaska and the Yukon==

In Dawson City, Alice worked as a writer, author, and miner while still continuing to perform some ethnological work. In 1900, she was employed as a prison inspector, and was sent by the bureau of ethnology of the Smithsonian Institute to study and report on the prison life. The Smithsonian Institution also commissioned her to study the tribal traditions of the Yukon and Alaska. Though none of her notes have survived, she is known to have performed interviews with Yukon Tagish First Nations on death row about their religious beliefs, and concluded that they may have been sun-worshippers.For Revenge: The Reason the Indians Killed the White Man at Tagish: An Interview Had to Find Out Their Legends, Traditions, and Religious Belief - Are These Northern Tribes Sun-Worshippers?

Rollins-Crane became the domestic partner of William Galpin,Dawson Daily News, Wednesday February 24, 1904 an author and miner living in Dawson City. In 1903, however, she launched a lawsuit against him for assault and threatening to kill her. According to her testimony, she and Galpin had become estranged when they disputed over the authorship of The Widow of Dawson, both claiming to be the author. She sent the manuscript to publishers, and he ordered it sent back. The assault charges against Galpin were dismissed on May 13, 1903.GALPIN-CRANE CASE AT AN END: Charge of Assault Against Captain Dismissed in Police Court This Morning. Dawson Daily News, May 13, 1903 However, Galpin would later charge Alice with perjury.
It was during this period that Alice met her third husband, Victor Moraczewski, a man who claimed to be a Russian count, but who was more likely Polish. According to newspaper reports of the time, William Galpin had been pursuing Rollins-Crane with propositions of marriage. She sought shelter in a roadhouse kept by Moraczewski, where he allegedly protected her from assault by Galpin.Out for Damages: Count Morajeski, of Dawson, Busy. TO SUE UNCLE SAM.

In 1905, Victor Moraczewski told newspapers that he would sue the American government on the grounds that his wife had been the victim of mistreatment and personal violence at the hands of government officials.
During this time she also wrote for National Geographic Magazine[tpl]cite web|url=http://archive.org/stream/nationalgeograph12natiuoft/nationalgeograph12natiuoft_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "National geographic" |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-13[/tpl] and the Dawson Daily News.Golden Cleanup Edition, Dawson Caily News, September 1902

==Mining Activities==

In 1898, Alice organized and became the manager of the Los Angeles Woman's Mining Syndicate, a group of about fifty women who advanced $2500 for the development of Yukon mining properties. According to the contract, the property would be owned by Alice Rollins-Crane, but a certain percentage would be paid back to the syndicate. The syndicate was never officially incorporated, but in 1900, the same women organized the Los Angeles and Yukon Mining Company, and acquired an interest in Alice's mining properties,ALICE GETS THE BOUNCE: Captain Galpin Said to Be Responsible: WRITES THINGS ABOUT HER: Los Angeles Women Decide That Female Promoter, Writer of Stories, and Wife of Russian Count is Entirely Too Clever.

William Galpin, Alice's erstwhile domestic partner, wrote to stockholders in 1903 to tell them that Alice "was no lady" and "was not working in the interests of other stockholders." Alice was forced to step down from the management of the company, although she retained her interests in it.
