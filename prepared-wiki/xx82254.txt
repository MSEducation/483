</ref> The enantiomeric ratio of the chiral lithium species is often influenced by the differences in rates of deprotonation. In the example below, treatment of ''N''-Boc-''N''-benzylamine with ''n''-butyllithium in the presence of (-)-sparteine affords one enantiomer of the product with high [[enantiomeric excess]]. Transmetalation with trimethyltinchlroride affords the opposite enantiomer.<ref name=NBocbenzylamines>

===Lithium enolates===

Lithium enolates are formed through deprotonation of a C-H bond α to the carbonyl group by an organolithium species. Lithium enolates are widely used as nucleophiles in carbon-carbon bond formation reactions such as aldol condensation and alkylation. They are also an important intermediate in the formation of silyl enol ether.
Lithium enolate formation can be generalized as an acid-base reaction, in which the relatively acidic proton α to the carbonyl group (pK =20-28 in DMSO) reacts with organolithium base. Generally, strong, non-nucleophilic bases, especially lithium amides such LDA, LiHMDS and LiTMP are used. THF and DMSO are common solvents in lithium enolate reactions.
The stereochemistry and mechanism of enolate formation have gained much interest in the chemistry community. Many factors influence the outcome of enolate stereochemistry, such as steric effects of substituents, coordination of solvent and polar additives and types of organolithium bases. Among the many models used to explain and predict the selectivity in stereochemistry of lithium enolates is the Ireland model.
In this assumption, a monomeric LDA reacts with the carbonyl substrate and form a cyclic Zimmerman-Traxler type transition state. The (E)-enolate is favored due to an unfavorable syn-pentane interaction in the (Z)-enolate transition state.
Experimental results suggest that addition of polar additives such as HMPA or DMPU favors the formation of (Z) enolates. The Ireland model argues that these donor ligands coordinate to the lithium cations, as a result, carbonyl oxygen and lithium interaction is reduced, and the transition state is not as tightly bound as a six-membered chair. The percentage of (Z) enolates also increases when lithium bases with bulkier side chains (such as LiHMDS) are used. However, the mechanism of how these additives reverse stereoselectivity is still being debated.
There have been some challenges to the Ireland model, as it depicts the lithium species as a monomer in the transition state. In reality, a variety of lithium aggregates are often observed in solutions of lithium enolates, and depending on specific substrate, solvent and reaction conditions, it can be difficult to determine which aggregate is the actual reactive species in solution.

===Lithium-Halogen exchange===

Lithium halogen exchange is a metathesis reaction between an organohalide and organolithium species. Gilman and Wittig first discovered this method independently in the late 1930s.[tpl]cite journal|last=Gilman|first=H|coauthor=et al.|title=Metalation as a Side Reaction in the Preparation of Organolithium Compounds|journal=JACS.|year=1939|volume=61|pages=106–109|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ja01870a036|doi=10.1021/ja01870a036[/tpl]
There is still some debate on the mechanism of lithium-halogen exchange.
One possible pathway involves a nucleophilic mechanism that generates a reversible “ate-complex” intermediate. Farnham and Calabrese were able to isolate “ate-complex” lithium bis(pentafluorophenyl) iodinate complexed with TMEDA and obtain an X-ray crystal structure.
The “ate-complex” further reacts with electrophiles and provides pentafluorophenyl iodide and C6H5Li. A number of kinetic studies also support a nucleophilic pathway in which the carbanion on the lithium species attacks the halogen atom on the aryl halide.
Another possible mechanism involves single electron transfer and the generation of radicals. In reactions of secondary and tertiary alkyllithium and alkyl halides, Electron-Spin Resonance Spectroscopy detected radical species.
However, whether these radicals are reaction intermediates is not definitive. The mechanistic studies of lithium -halogen exchange is also complicated by the formation of aggregates of organolithium species.
The rate of lithium halogen exchange is extremely fast. It is usually faster than nucleophilic addition and can sometimes exceed the rate of proton transfer. In the example below, the exchange between lithium and primary iodide is almost instantaneous, and outcompetes proton transfer from methanol to tert-butyllithium. The major alkene product is formed in over 90% yield.
[tpl]cite journal|last=Bailey|first=W.F.|coauthor=et al.|title=Metal—halogen interchange between t-butyllithium and 1-iodo-5-hexenes provides no evidence for single-electron transfer|journal=Tetrahedron.Lett..|year=1986|volume=27|pages=1861–1864|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0040403900843956/1-s2.0-S0040403900843956-main.pdf?_tid=75fe4632-4025-11e3-8b4b-00000aab0f6b&acdnat=1383001719_f60b1be282673297d7d6222e4c4a06ba[/tpl]
Lithium-halogen exchange is very useful in preparing new organolithium reagents. The trend of exchange rates usually follows I > Br> Cl, while alkyl- and arylfluoride are generally not reactive toward organolithium reagents. Lithium halogen exchange is kinetically controlled, and the rate of exchange is primarily influenced by the stabilities of the carbanion intermediates (sp > sp2 > sp3) of the organolithium reagents.The Preparation of Organolithium Reagents and Intermediates Leroux.F., Schlosser. M., Zohar. E., Marek. I., Wiley, New York. 2004. ISBN 978-0-470-84339-0  For example, the more basic tertiary organolithium reagents (usually n-butyllithium, sec-butyllithium or tert-butyllithium) are the most reactive, and will react with primary alkyl halide (usually bromide or iodide) to form the more stable organolithium species. Therefore, lithium halogen exchange is most frequently used to prepare vinyl- aryl- and primary alkyllithium reagents. Lithium halogen exchange is also facilitated when alkoxy groups or heteroatoms are present to stabilize the carbanion, and this method is especially useful for the preparation of functionalized lithium reagents which cannot tolerate the harsher conditions required for reduction with lithium metal. 
Substrates such as vinyl halides usually undergo lithium-halogen exchange with retention of the stereochemistry of the double bond.
[tpl]cite journal|last=Seebach|first=D|coauthor=Neumann H.|title=Stereospecific preparation of terminal vinyllithium derivatives by Br/Li-exchange with t-butyllithium|journal=Tetrahedron.Lett..|year=1976|volume=52|pages=4839–4842|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S004040390078926X/1-s2.0-S004040390078926X-main.pdf?_tid=04e5eaa4-4025-11e3-b1b3-00000aacb360&acdnat=1383001529_b90bfc642f16f9585e16e01c9356123c[/tpl]
Below is an example of the use of lithium-halogen exchange in the synthesis of morphine. Here, n-butyllithium is used to perform lithium-halogen exchange with bromide. The nucleophilic carbanion center quickly undergoes carbolithiation to the double bond, generating an anion stabilized by the adjacent sulfone group. An intramolecular SN2 reaction by the anion forms the cyclic backbone of morphine.
Lithium halogen exchange is a crucial part of Parham cyclization. In this reaction, an aryl halide (usually iodide or bromide) exchanges with organolithium to form a lithiated arene species. If the arene bears a side chain with an electrophilc moiety, the carbanion attached to the lithium will perform intramolecular nucleophilic attack and cyclize. This reaction is a useful strategy for heterocycle formation. In the example below, Parham cyclization was used to in the cyclization of an isocyanate to form isoindolinone, which was then converted to a nitrone. The nitrone species further reacts with radicals, and can be used as "spin traps" to study biological radical processes.

===Transmetalation===

Organolithium reagents are often used to prepare other organometallic compounds via transmetalation. Organocopper, organotin, organosilicon, organoboron, organophosphorus, organocerium and organosulfur compounds are frequently prepared by reacting organolithium reagents with appropriate electrophiles.
Common types of transmetalation include Li/Sn, Li/Hg, and Li/Te exchange, which are fast at low temperature. The advantage of Li/Sn exchange is that the tri-alkylstannane precursors undergo few side reactions, as the resulting n-Bu3Sn byproducts are unreactive toward alkyllithium reagents."Organolithium Reagents'' Reich, H.J. 2002 http://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/handouts/lireagents/orgli-primer.pdf In the following example, vinylstannane, synthesized from terminal alkyne, forms vinyllithium through transmetalation with n-BuLi.
Organolithium can also be used in to prepare organozinc compounds through transmetalation with zinc salts.
Llithium diorganocuprates can be formed by reacting alkyl lithium species with copper(I) halide. The resulting organocuprates are generally less reactive toward aldehydes and ketones than organolithium reagents or Grignard reagents.

==Preparation==

Most simple alkyllithium reagents, and common lithium amides are commercially available in a variety of solvents and concentrations. Organolithium reagents can also be prepared in the laboratory. Below are some common methods for preparing organolithium reagents.

===Reaction with lithium metal===

Reduction of alkyl halide with metallic lithium can afford simple alkyl and aryl organolithium reagents.
Industrial preparation of organolithium reagents is achieved using this method by treating the alkyl chloride with metal lithium containing 0.5-2% sodium. The conversion is highly exothermic.  The sodium initiates the radical pathway and increases the rate."Organometallics in Organic Synthesis", Schlosser, M., Ed, Wiley: New York, 1994. ISBN 0-471-93637-5 The reduction proceeds via a radical pathway. Below is an example of the preparation of a functionalized lithium reagent using reduction with lithium metal. Sometimes, lithium metal in the form of fine powders are used in the reaction with certain catalysts such as naphthalene or 4,4’-di-t-butylbiphenyl (DTBB). Another substrate that can be reduced with lithium metal to generate alkyllithium reagents is sulfides. Reduction of sulfides is useful in the formation of functionalized organolithium reagents such as alpha-lithio ethers, sulfides, and silanes.[tpl]cite journal|last=Cohen|first=T|coauthors=Bhupathy. M|title=Organoalkali compounds by radical anion induced reductive metalation of phenyl thioethers|journal=Acc.Chem.Res.|year=1989|volume=22|pages=152–161|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ar00160a006|doi=10.1021/ar00160a006[/tpl]

===Metalation===

See Metalation.(under Reactivity and applications)
A second method of preparing organolithium reagents is through metalation (lithium hydrogen exchange). The relative acidity of hydrogen atoms controls the position of lithiation.
This is the most common method for preparing alkynyllithium reagents, because the terminal hydrogen bound to the sp carbon is very acidic and easily deprotonated. For aromatic compounds, the position of lithiation is also determined by the directing effect of substituent groups.[tpl]cite journal|last=Snieckus|first=V|title=Directed ortho metalation. Tertiary amide and O-carbamate directors in synthetic strategies for polysubstituted aromatics|journal=Chem.Rev.|year=1990|volume=90|pages=879–933|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/cr00104a001|doi=10.1021/cr00104a001[/tpl] Some of the most effective directing substituent groups are alkoxy, amido, sulfoxide, sulfonyl. Metalation often occurs at the position ortho to these substituents. In heteroaromatic compounds, metalation usually occurs at the position ortho to the heteroatom.

===Lithium halogen exchange===

See lithium-halogen exchange (under Reactivity and applications)
A third method to prepare organolithium reagents is through lithium halogen exchange.
tert-butyllithium or n-butyllithium are the most commonly used reagents for generating new organolithium species through lithium halogen exchange. Lithium-halogen exchange is mostly used to convert aryl and alkenyl iodides and bromides with sp2 carbons to the corresponding organolithium compounds. The reaction is extremely fast, and often proceed at -60 to -120 °C.

===Transmetalation===

See transmetalation (under Reactivity and applications)
The fourth method to prepare organolithium reagents is through transmetalation. This method can be used for preparing vinyllithium.

===Shapiro reaction===

In the Shapiro reaction, two equivalents of strong alkyllithium base react with p-tosylhydrazone compounds to produce the vinyllithium, or upon quenching, the olefin product.

==Handling==

Organolithium compounds are highly reactive species and require specialized handling techniques. They are often corrosive, flammable, and sometimes pyrophoric (spontaneous ignition when exposed to oxygen or moisture).[tpl]cite journal|last=Letchford|first=R.J.|coauthor= Schwindeman.

Ann.Chem.|year=1950|volume=567|pages=179–185|doi=10.1002/jlac.19505670110[/tpl]  Organolithium reagents are typically stored below 10 °C. Reactions are conducted using air free techniques. The concentration of alkyllithium reagents is often determined by titration:[tpl]cite journal|last=Kofron|first=W.G.|coauthor=Baclawski, L.M.|title=A convenient method for estimation of alkyllithium concentrations|journal=J.Org.Chem|year=1976|volume=41|pages=1879–1880|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jo00872a047|doi=10.1021/jo00872a047[/tpl]
