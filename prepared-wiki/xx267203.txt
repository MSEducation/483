It was formed in 2011 by seven members of the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference and independent Berry College.[tpl]cite web|title=Eight Division III Southeastern Colleges Form Southern Athletic Association|url=http://www.rhodeslynx.com/news/2011/8/19/BB_0819114423.aspx?path=baseball|publisher=Rhodes College|accessdate=22 September 2011[/tpl]

==Member schools==

===Full members===

===Affiliate members===

Two schools, the University of Chicago and Washington University in St. Louis, have announced their intention to become affiliate members of the conference for football, effective in 2015. Both are members of the University Athletic Association (UAA), which is currently in a football scheduling alliance with the North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC). However, after the 2012 season, the NCAC will adopt a full round-robin football schedule, making it impossible for that conference to fill in all of its non-conference dates with the four UAA members that sponsor the sport.
