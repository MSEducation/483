The Ram Jam Inn is a pub on the A1 in Rutland between Stamford and Grantham.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/centralengland/722050/Paddy-Burt-The-Ram-Jam-Inn-Rutland.html|title=The Ram Jam Inn, Rutland|last=Burt|first=Paddy|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=4 March 2000|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] It was frequented by the highwayman Dick Turpin in the 18th century, and it is alleged that one of his confidence tricks inspired the pub's name.
The pub originally opened as a coaching inn called the Winchelsea Arms, but became known as the Ram Jam Inn by the early 19th century.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EuAuAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA83&dq=%22ram+jam+inn%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=neQIUsbvF8id0QXg0oDwBA&ved=0CF4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22ram%20jam%20inn%22&f=false|page=83|author=John Britton, Edward Wedlake Brayley, Joseph Nightingale, John Evans, James Norris Brewer, John Hodgson, John Bigland, Francis Charles Laird, Frederic Shoberl, John Harris, Thomas Rees, Thomas Hood|title=The Beauties of England and Wales, or, Delineations, topographical, historical, and descriptive, of each county, Volume 12, Part 2|publisher=Thomas Maiden, for Vernor and Hood|year=1813|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] Turpin was a temporary lodger at the inn, and resided here when he first found notoriety. He showed his landlady, Mrs Spring, how to draw mild and bitter ale from a single barrel, stating "ram one thumb in here whilst I make a hole ... now jam your other thumb in this hole while I find the forgotten spile pegs." Turpin subsequently disappeared without paying his bill, while Spring was trapped with two thumbs in the barrel.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_v31lEduNzIC&pg=PA120&dq=ram+jam+inn&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JN4IUubZDfSA0AWX_IHoDQ&ved=0CDkQuwUwAQ#v=onepage&q=ram%20jam%20inn&f=false|title=It's a Small World: Rutland and Her Diaspora|last=Dolby|first=Peter|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2008|pages=119-120| isbn=9781434319562[/tpl] An alternative, similar, account is that an unnamed con-artist, not specifically named as Turpin, made the landlord fall for the trick so the trickster could try and seduce the landlady. A third tale is that by the 19th century "ram-jam" was a term that meant both eating to capacity and a place full of people.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k-4SrdUPNFoC&pg=PA320&dq=ram+jam+inn&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iN0IUojiN6jX0QWWoYHgCQ&ved=0CDQQuwUwAA#v=onepage&q=ram%20jam%20inn&f=false|title=Dictionary of Pub Names|last=Rothwell|first=David|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|page=320|year=2006|isbn=9781840222661[/tpl]

When reviewing the inn in 2000, The Telegraph's Paddy Burt described the meals as "simple food, well done". Author Margaret Drabble enjoys staying at the inn, noting that the double glazing effectively masks the sound of traffic on the A1.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BL-sRzyVoNUC&pg=PA34&dq=%22ram+jam+inn%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=neQIUsbvF8id0QXg0oDwBA&ved=0CEgQuwUwBA#v=onepage&q=%22ram%20jam%20inn%22&f=false|title=The Pattern in the Carpet: A Personal History with Jigsaws|last=Drabble|first=Margaret|page=34|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2010|isbn=9780547386096[/tpl]
In August 2013 the pub was closed and put on the market for an estimated value of £550,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://corporateinternational.colliers-uk.com/Modules/Shared/OpenDocument.aspx?F=c8b6a2c6-60bb-4312-b36c-9bc6fee2573b.pdf&p=documents&HID=306060&PID=-1&departmentID=17|title=Confidential sale : Substantial freehold for sale|publisher=Colliers International|date=12 August 2013|accessdate=16 September 2013[/tpl]
