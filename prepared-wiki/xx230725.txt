[[Interpersonal compatibility]]

CATEGORIES: Interpersonal relationships, Philosophy of love

Interpersonal compatibility is the long-term interaction between two or more individuals in terms of the ease and comfort of communication.

==Existing concepts==

Although various concepts of interpersonal compatibility have existed from ancient times (see, e.g., Plato's Lysis), no general theory of interpersonal compatibility has been proposed in psychology. Existing concepts are contradictory in many details, beginning with the central point—whether compatibility is caused by matching psychological parameters or by their complementarity. At the same time, the idea of interpersonal compatibility is analyzed in non-scientific fields (see, e.g., Astrological compatibility).
Among existing psychological tools for studying and/or measuring interpersonal compatibility, the following are noteworthy:
Socionics has proposed a theory of intertype relationships between psychological types based on a modified version of C.G. Jung's theory of psychological types. Communication between types is described using the concept of information metabolism proposed by Antoni Kępiński. However, socionic theory is somewhat controversial because of a lack of experimental data (although socionic data are much more representative than, e.g., those of Ackoff and Emery).
Alternative hypotheses of intertype relationships were later proposed by adherents of MBTI (D. Keirsey's hypothesis of compatibility between Keirsey temperaments,[tpl]cite book |author=Keirsey, David |origyear=1978 |date=May 1, 1998 |title=Please Understand Me II: Temperament, Character, Intelligence |publisher=Prometheus Nemesis Book Co |edition=1st |isbn=1-885705-02-6[/tpl] an intertype relationships chart by Joe Butt and Marina Margaret Heiss,http://www.typelogic.com LoveTypes by Alexander Avilahttp://www.lovetypes.com and some other theorieshttp://www.personalitypage.com/relationships.htmlhttp://www.massmatch.com/MBTI-2.php?id=3http://www.humanmetrics.com/). Neither of these hypotheses are commonly accepted in the Myers–Briggs type theory. MBTI in Russia is often confused with socionics, although the 16 types in these theories are described differently and do not correlate exactly.

==Controversy==

The following problems may be reasons for the absence of a theory of psychological compatibility:

==MHC and sexual mating==

It has been suggested that MHC plays a role in the selection of potential mates, via olfaction. MHC genes make molecules that enable the immune system to recognize invaders; generally, the more diverse the MHC genes of the parents, the stronger the immune system of the offspring. It would therefore be beneficial to have evolved systems of recognizing individuals with different MHC genes and preferentially selecting them to breed with.
Yamazaki et al. (1976) showed this to be the case for male mice, which show a preference for females of different MHC. Similar results have been obtained with fish.[tpl]cite journal |title=MHC peptides and the sensory evaluation of genotype |last=Boehm |first=T. |coauthors=Zufall, F. |year=2006 |journal=Trends Neurosci |issue=2 |volume=29 |pages=100–107 |pmid=16337283 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2005.11.006[/tpl]
In 1995, Swiss biologist Claus Wedekind determined MHC influences both body odors and body odor preferences in humans, and that the women's preferences depend on their hormonal status. In an experiment, a group of female college students smelled T-shirts that had been worn by male students for two nights, without deodorant, cologne or scented soaps. Overwhelmingly, the women preferred the odors of men with dissimilar MHCs to their own. However, their preference was reversed if they were taking oral contraceptives.[tpl]cite journal |title=MHC-dependent mate preferences in humans |last=Wedekind |first=C. |coauthors=Seebeck, T.; Bettens, F.; Paepke, A.J. |date=June 1995 |journal=Proc Biol Sci |volume=260 |issue=1359 |pages=245–249 |pmid=7630893 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1995.0087[/tpl] The hypothesis is that MHCs affect mate choice and that oral contraceptives can interfere with the preference for variation. A study in 2005 on 58 test subjects confirmed that taking oral contraceptives made women prefer men with MHCs similar to their own.[tpl]cite journal |title=New evidence that the MHC influences odor perception in humans: a study with 58 Southern Brazilian students |last=Santos |first=P.S. |coauthors=Schinemann, J.A.; Gabardo, J.; Bicalho, Mda G. |journal=Horm Behav. |date=April 2005 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=384–388 |pmid=15777804 |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2004.11.005[/tpl] Several follow up studies have confirmed the belief that paternally inherited HLA-associated odors influence odor preference and may serve as social cues.The pill makes women pick bad mates[tpl]cite journal |author=Jacob S., McClintock M.K., Zelano B., Ober C. |title=Paternally inherited HLA alleles are associated with women's choice of male odor |journal=Nat.

==Complementarity==

Complementarity in social psychology is defined on the basis of the interpersonal circle (Carson, 1969), according to which interpersonal behaviors fall on a circle with two dimensions, namely dominance (i.e. dominant–submissive) and warmth (i.e. hostile–friendly). It states that each interpersonal behavior invites certain responses of another interactant. The behavior and the response it invites are said to be complementary (Horowitz, Dryer, & Krasnoperova, 1997) when friendly behavior begets hostile behavior, and dominant behavior begets submissive behavior. When people fail to give the invited response, it is said to be a non-complementary interaction. If the first person's behavior invites a reaction from the second person that matches the second person's goals, then the second person is satisfied; otherwise, the second person is frustrated (Dryer & Horowitz, 1997).
