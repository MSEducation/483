Kalat-i-nadiri is a massive natural fortress located about 44 miles north of Sousia in the Kalat, Khorasan region of Iran.

It is essentially a massive plateau about 4 miles in circumference that has been used as a fortress since before the Achaemenid era.  It is surrounded on 3 sides by high cliff walls ranging from 1500 feet on the south side to 2000 feet on the west side with lower eastern walls and a gently sloping plain leading up to the heights from the north.
It is famous as the only fortress ever to withstand a siege by Tamerlane.
Alexander the Great's army laid siege to it.  While Alexander left to deal with a rebellious Persian chieftain, he ordered Craterus to command the majority of the army and take the fortress.
