==Music video==

During the video, Forrest is near the middle of the classroom. After listening to the teacher's (Mark Derwin) rant of no-one going up against jock Blake in the nominations for president, Forrest shyly waves at the girl he likes, Wendy, while she's looking in his direction. The teacher thinks Forrest is raising his hand to be a nominee, and he is placed against Blake in the vote for class-president. The students leave and Wendy drops her book which Forrest in turn picks up. Having her name and locker number on it, he waits until finally she comes and he gives it to her, running off. Blake wins the election to Forrest's dismay. When Blake imitates "doing" Wendy to Forrest whilst her back is turned, Forrest gets angry and begins to slam "Game Cancelled" signs all over the school. The other bandmembers then place Wendy on the empty bleachers when the game should be on, and on come Hellogoodbye playing their instruments with the school band in front. When the football team come charging out, they see no-one but the band and the coach sends them to fight. This goes on whilst Hellogoodbye continue to play, with the scene ending with Forrest and Wendy happily together.
