==Career==

Kippax was born in Sydney in 1920.  He failed to complete an Arts degree at the University of Sydney and became a cadet journalist with The Sydney Morning Herald before the start of World War II.  He served overseas in the 2nd AIF in the Signals Corps 1942-45.
On return to Australia, he rejoined the Herald as a war and foreign correspondent, serving in London, Germany, Greece, Spain and Portugal.  He was News Editor in Sydney from 1950 to 1954.  For the next three years he worked overseas again, reporting from London, France, Russia, and the Middle East, where he covered the 1956 Suez Crisis. He was in Sydney from 1958 for the rest of his career, where he became renowned as a theatre and literary critic while holding more senior editorial roles.
Kippax was an early champion of the plays of Patrick White, being one of the few critics who wrote favourably of The Ham Funeral.  Of its 1961 Adelaide premiere, he wrote that the play ... brilliantly suggests a way out of the impasse in which the Australian drama finds itself.  After the 1962 Sydney premiere, he wrote: I am not going to mince words or hedge against the future.  I believe the professional performance of The Ham Funeral at the Palace ... is an epoch-making event.David Marr, Patrick White: A Life, p. 394 But he and White fell out over more negative critiques of some later White plays.  David Marr writes "he had come to think all White's later plays were trash".David Marr, Patrick White: A Life, p. 626  They also had diametrically opposing views of the plays of Louis Nowra - what Kippax loved in Nowra, White was sure to hate; and vice-versa.
He was said to have "spotted the talent" of the actors John Bell, Robyn Nevin, Mel Gibson and Judy Davis; and the playwright David Williamson.The Australian, 2 December 2006; Retrieved 12 August 2013
