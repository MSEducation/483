==Plot outline==

Erky Perky was a comedy series about two bugs; the Scottish-accented, Erky and his friend, the cowardly and impressionable Perky who live an idyllic life on a downtown hot dog stand - a cornucopia of crumbs, relish and wieners. They live the high life until one day they are swept away in a take-out bag and end up in a sterile suburban kitchen with no food in sight. The two bickering, dimwitted and lazy bugs are forced to survive in the new and scary "Land of Kitchen". Every day, they are obsessed with finding food, and eventually finding their way home to "Hot Dog Stand". Their quests are almost always befouled by 'Mad' Margaret, the self-appointed ruler of Kitchen, and her 'sidekick' Cecil.

==Main character descriptions==

Erquhart "Erky" Windsor (Jason Barr) Erky is a Scottish accented bug who normally takes Perky for granted and makes him try and get food in a dangerous Scheme, he is blue with yellow spots. It was revealed in the episode Perky vs. McBuggy Z that he is a natural born rapper and dancer
Percival "Perky" Rosendahl (Neil Crone) Perky is Erky's friend and partner, he is very cowardly and very weak. It was made quite obvious that Perky has a crush on Margaret's niece, Sajuica. He is yellow with blue spots.
Cecil: (Adrian Truss) Cecil who, despite being a tenth Margaret's size, appears to be somewhat smitten with the tyrant, becoming extremely jealous of her having affairs with newcomer Pablomo, and Erky (when he was under the influence of the Love Crumb).
Mad Margret: (Judy Marshak) She is the self-appointed ruler of kitchen, and usually stops Erky and Perky's plans and when they find food, she generally steals it.
Sajuica: (Melissa Jane Shaw) is apparently the 'babe' of Kitchen, attracting flies, and being flirty. Even the childish Stinks (named for his flight-inducing farts) thinks she is 'fine'.  She fancies Perky.
Frenzel: (Ron Rubin) While Stinks may be smart, it's another bug named Frenzel who takes the cake (literally) when it comes to devising food-getting plans. He always has profitable schemes on the go, preying on other bugs' naivet√© or weaknesses to get himself ahead. Often, Perky is the one suffering, being a very gullible and trusting bug. An example of this is when Frenzel was showing young bugs the dangers of Kitchen, and for the final show he tricked Perky into being the German-accented spider, Delila's 'dinner', not telling the frightened bug that it was all an act, and that there wasn't really any danger (unlike most of Frenzel's plans).
Moldy van Oldy: (Keith Knight) is a senile old bug, Moldy van Oldy, who loves to talk and talk for hours, sometimes it's about actual events, sometimes it's nothing more than senseless ramblings. One true story he did tell, however, was the tale of Margaret's acquired hydrophobia. When she was about Sajuica's age, and living in an outdoor garden (along with Moldy and presumably other bugs as well), Margaret was sprayed with water from a hose, getting knocked out of the air.
Stinks: (Annick Obonsawin) A running gag is that Stinks would appear whenever anyone said his 'name' (or any other word that sounds similar, such as thinks), often this happens when they are bemoaning some misfortune ('This stinks').
Delils: (Diana Brooke) is a German-accent spider who tells fortunes.
Boof: (Carter Hayden) is Frenzel's assistant, he is a digger bug and was born from an egg that Perky found.
The Grand Armandor: (Andrew Pifko) is Magaret's personal wing and purse designer.
