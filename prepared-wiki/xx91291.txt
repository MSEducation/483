The National Congress ([tpl]lang-es|Congreso Nacional[/tpl]) of Chile is the legislative branch of the government of the Republic of Chile.
The National Congress of Chile was founded on July 4, 1811. It is a bicameral legislature comprised by the Chamber of Deputies (lower house), of 120 Deputies and by the Senate (upper house), formed by 38 Senators. 
The organisation of Congress and its powers and duties are defined in articles 42 to 59 of the current constitution and by the Constitutional Organic Law No. 18,918. Congress meets in the Chile Congress building, which was built during the last years of the Pinochet regime and stands in the port city of Valpara√≠so, some 140 km west of the capital, Santiago. This new building replaced the Former National Congress Building, located in downtown Santiago.
