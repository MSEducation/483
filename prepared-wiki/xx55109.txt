He was considered the most revered female impersonator in ancient Rome.Arms of Nemesis, Steven Saylor, Macmillan, 2008, pg. 69. He is known for having been the lover of Lucius Cornelius Sulla[tpl]fact|date=February 2014[/tpl], the famed general and Dictator, and is mentioned twice by Plutarch, who clearly disapproves of him "and he never lost his love for an actor called Metrobius" and later "And Metrobius, (who specialized in camp transvestite roles) Although Metrobius was past the age of youthful bloom, Sulla remained to the end of his life in love with him, and made no secret of that fact."
