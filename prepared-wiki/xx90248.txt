He succeeded his father in the earldom in 1977 but does not use the title. This is an Irish peerage and did not bar him from sitting in the House of Commons. At the 1979 general election, he was returned as Member of Parliament for Chippenham in Wiltshire. He was one of the "Wiltshire Wets", Conservative MPs from the county who expressed concern at the perceived loss of jobs resulting from the "monetarist" policies of Margaret Thatcher.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] His constituency was abolished for the 1983 general election, when he was returned to the House of Commons for the new North Wiltshire constituency.

He was the longest serving British government Northern Ireland minister.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl] In 1994 he was sworn of the Privy Council. In his book Battling for Peace (1999), he recalls attending a service at Westminster Abbey in 1991:  The former chairman of the county council and high sheriff for the year, Nigel Anderson, was a redoubtable old soldier who had a profound dislike of Mrs Thatcher and kept muttering "Well done, keep it up" in a loud whisper at every opportunity when there was a lull in the service.Richard Needham, Battling for Peace: Northern Ireland's Longest-Serving British Minister (Blackstaff Press, 1999) p. 214
