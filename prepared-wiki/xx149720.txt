The Monarchist National Party (Partito Nazionale Monarchico, PNM) was a political party in Italy founded in 1946, uniting conservatives, liberal conservatives, conservative liberals and nationalists. It was a right-wing competitor to Christian Democracy and was especially strong in Southern Italy.Massimo L. Salvadori, Enciclopedia storica, Zanichelli, Bologna 2000, pp. 1199-1200
The party's best electoral result was in the 1953 general election, when the party scored 6.9% and came fourth after Christian Democracy, the Italian Communist Party and the Italian Socialist Party.http://elezionistorico.interno.it/index.php?tpel=C&dtel=07/06/1953&tpa=I&tpe=A&lev0=0&levsut0=0&es0=S&ms=S
