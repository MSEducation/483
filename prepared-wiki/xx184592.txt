Hulland Ward is a village and civil parish in the Derbyshire Dales district of Derbyshire  roughly 7 miles west of Belper, Derbyshire England on the A517 road. The parish includes the hamlets of Biggin, Nether Biggin and Millington Green. Hulland Ward itself contains about 400 houses and has a population of just under 1000 inhabitants.
In the Domesday Survey it is listed as Hoilant in the care of Geoffrey d'Alselin. It was part of the lands bestowed upon Henry de Ferrers after the Norman Conquest, and became part of Duffield Frith, with two enclosed royal parks - Mansell Park and Ravensdale Park. The latter is now a civil parish in its own right.Turbutt, G., (1999) A History of Derbyshire. Volume 2: Medieval Derbyshire, Cardiff: Merton Priory Press
