iChat (or iChat AV) was an instant messaging software application developed by Apple Inc. for use on its Mac OS X operating system. It supported instant text messaging over XMPP/Jingle or OSCAR (AIM) protocol; it also featured audio, video and screen-sharing capabilities. It also allowed for local network discussion with users discovered through Bonjour protocols.
As of February 16, 2012, iChat has been discontinued, and has been replaced in OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion" by Messages. Users used to be able to download a public beta version of Messages on Apple's website as of February 16, 2012, the same day Apple introduced a preview to OS X Mountain Lion.

==Interface==

iChat incorporates Apple's Aqua interface and uses speech bubbles and pictures to personify the online chatting experience. With iChat, green (available), yellow (idle), and red (away) icons can be displayed next to the name of each connected user on the buddy list. For color-blind users, this can be altered to show different shapes, circle (available), triangle (idle), and squares (away), to illustrate status rather than color.

==History==

iChat was first released in August 2002 with the introduction of Mac OS X v10.2. It featured integration with the Address Book and Mail applications and was the first officially-supported AIM client that was native to Mac OS X (the first-party AIM application at the time was still running in Classic emulation).

===iChat AV===

In June 2003, Apple announced iChat AV, the second major version of iChat. It added video and audio conferencing capabilities based on the industry-standard Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The final version of the software was shipped with Mac OS X v10.3 and became available separately on the same day for Mac OS X v10.2 for $29.95.[ref]

===iChat AV 2===

In February 2004, AOL introduced AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) version 5.5 for Windows users, which enabled video, but not audio,  chats over the AIM protocol and was compatible with Apple's iChat AV. On the same day, Apple released a public beta of iChat AV 2.1 to allow Mac OS X users to video conferencing with AIM 5.5 users.

===iChat AV 3===

In June 2004, Steve Jobs announced that the next version of iChat AV would be included with Mac OS X v10.4.  iChat AV 3 added additional support to allow up to four people in a single video conference and ten people in an audio conference. Additionally, the new version of iChat used the H.264/AVC codec, which offers superior quality video compared to the older H.263 codec used in previous versions. This release supports the XMPP protocol, which can be directly used to connect to Google Talk and indirectly be used to connect to users of services including Facebook Chat, and Yahoo! Messenger.[ref]
