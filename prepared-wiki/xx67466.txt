==Military career==

===Hungarian campaign===

In pursuit of his military career, with his West Country cousins, Godolphins, Carews, Killigrews, Champernownws, Basets, etc., Grenville fought against the Turks in Hungary for the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian in 1566. After petitioning Elizabeth I in 1565 to leave England for service abroad to a foreign prince. Greynvile and his West Country cousins paid for and recruited a Troop of West Countryman to accompany them.

===Activity in Ireland===

In 1569, he arrived in Ireland with Sir Warham St. Leger (c.1525-1597) to arrange for the settlement of lands in the Barony of Kerricurrihy.  These had been mortgaged [tpl]Clarify|date=November 2011[/tpl] to St Leger by Gerald Fitzgerald, 15th Earl of Desmond.  At about this time Grenville also seized lands for colonisation at Tracton, to the west of Cork harbour.  Sir Peter Carew had asserted his claim to lands in south Leinster.  St Leger settled nearby, and Humphrey Gilbert pushed westward from Idrone along the Blackwater River.  All of these English efforts to take over land in the south of Ireland led to bitter disputes.  They escalated into the first of the Desmond rebellions, led by James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald.
As Sheriff of Cork, Grenville witnessed the rebellion in which Fitzmaurice, along with the Earl of Clancar, James Fitzedmund Fitzgerald (the Seneschal of Imokilly); Edmund Fitzgibbon (the White Knight); and others, attacked Tracton.  They overcame the English defence with pickaxes and killed nearly the entire garrison.  The three surviving English soldiers were hanged the next day by the Irish.  Fitzmaurice threatened the imminent arrival of Spanish forces.  Having robbed the citizens of Cork, he boasted that he could also take the artillery of the city of Youghal.
In June 1569, soon after Grenville's sailing for England, Fitzmaurice camped outside the walls of Waterford and demanded that Grenville's wife and Lady St Leger be given over to him, along with all the English and all prisoners; the citizens refused.  His forces put local English farmers to the sword.  As Cork ran low on provisions, the people of Youghal expected an attack at any minute.  The rebellion continued, but Grenville remained in England.

==Return to England==

Grenville sided with the Earl of Arundel and the Duke of Norfolk in 1569 against the Queen's secretary. He was elected MP for Cornwall in 1571 and appointed High Sheriff of Cornwall for 1576.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/grenville-richard-ii-1542-91| title= GRENVILLE, Richard II (c.1542-91), of Stowe in Kilkhampton, Cornw. and Buckland Abbey, Devon.|publisher= History of Parliament Online|accessdate = 31 May 2013[/tpl]  "Undeviatingly Protestant", he arrested the Catholic priest Cuthbert Mayne at the home of the Tregians in 1577.  Mayne was martyred as a result.

===Development of Bideford===

During this period Grenville played a major role in the transformation of the small fishing port of Bideford in north Devon into what became a significant trading port with the new American colonies, later specialising in tobacco importation. A Charter had been granted to his ancestor  Richard Grenville in 1272, creating the Town's first Council. In 1575 he created the Port of Bideford. Grenville was never elected as Mayor of Bideford, preferring instead to support John Salterne in that role, but he was Lord of the Manor, a title held by the Grenvilles since 1126 and finally ceded by his descendants in 1711 to the Town Council he established. He was again elected as MP for Cornwall in 1584 (sitting until 1586).

==Development of Irish estate==

Following a period of supporting Sir Walter Raleigh's venture in America (see below) he returned to Munster to arrange the estate granted him under the plantation of the province.  Following the suppression of the Second Desmond Rebellion in 1583, he had purchased some 24,000 acres (97 km²) in Kinalmeaky and brought settlers over.  His renewed efforts beginning in 1588 yielded little success, and Grenville returned to England late in 1590.

==Privateering plan==

In 1574 Grenville submitted a proposal to the Privy Council to take a single ship to plunder Spanish treasure ships and plant colonies in South America and from there to sail across the 'South Sea' (i.e. Pacific Ocean) in hope of finding a short cut to the Spice Islands. The patent was initially granted, but was rescinded a year later after the protests of Philip of Spain. Grenville's plan  was eventually executed by Sir Francis Drake when he circumnavigated the world in 1577.

==New World and Roanoke Colony==

In 1585, Grenville was admiral of the seven-strong fleet that brought English settlers to establish a military colony on Roanoke Island, off the coast of modern North Carolina in North America.  He was heavily criticised by Ralph Lane, general of the expedition, who referred to Grenville's "intolerable pride and unsatiable ambition". Lane's remark was prompted by a bitter legal feud he then had with Grenville. On his return, Grenville captured a Spanish ship, the 'Santa Maria de Vincenze', which he later brought to Bideford to be converted into the 'Galleon Dudley'. The cannons from that Spanish ship are thought to be those erroneously labelled 'Armada cannons' in Bideford's Victoria Park.
In 1586 Grenville returned to Roanoke to find that the surviving colonists had departed with Drake. Grenville left 15 of his own men to defend Raleigh's New World territory. During his return voyage to England, Grenville raided various towns in the Azores Islands. At about this time, a description was given of his behaviour while dining with Spanish captains:  "He would carouse three or four glasses of wine, and in a  bravery take the glasses between his teeth and crash them in pieces and swallow them down, so that often the blood ran out of his mouth without any harm at all unto him"."Revenge"  

==Spanish Armada==

In 1587 he was asked by the Privy Council to organize the defences of Devon and Cornwall in preparation for the expected attack by the Spanish Armada the following year.
In 1588, Grenville equipped seven ships at Bideford with supplies and more colonists for Raleigh's 'Planters' Colony settled at Roanoke the previous year. However, a stay of shipping due to the impending arrival of the Spanish Armada meant that the fleet did not sail. Grenville led five of these ships to Plymouth to join the English defences and returned to Bideford where he provisioned the remaining two ships for Roanoke, a voyage that later turned back after being raided by the French. Later that year, Grenville was commissioned to keep watch at sea on the western approaches to the Bristol Channel in case of the return of the Spanish Armada.

==Command of the Revenge and death==

Grenville was appointed Vice-Admiral of the Fleet under Thomas Howard.  He was charged with maintaining a squadron at the Azores to waylay the return to Spain of the South American Spanish treasure fleets.  He took command of Revenge, a galleon considered to be a masterpiece of naval construction.
At Flores Island the English fleet was surprised by a much larger squadron sent by King Philip II of Spain. Howard retreated to safety, but Grenville faced the 53 enemy ships alone, leading his single ship in what amounted to a suicide mission, stating that he "utterly refused to turn from the enimie...he would rather chose to die than to dishonour himselfe".Milton, p.271  His crew was reduced by nearly 100 men due to sickness on shore, but he chose nonetheless to confront the far superior Spanish force. For twelve hours he and his crew fought-off the Spanish, causing heavy damage to fifteen galleons.  According to Raleigh's account, Grenville and his soldiers fought for hour after hour:
The fight was later romanticized by the  poet Alfred Lord Tennyson in his work The Revenge: A Ballad of the Fleet: "Out-gunned, out-fought, and out-numbered fifty-three to one",The Revenge: A Ballad of the Fleet by Alfred, Lord Tennyson Grenville was said to have wished to blow up his ship rather than give up the fight, as Tennyson wrote:  "Sink me the ship, Master Gunner! — sink her! split her in twain! ... Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain! ". Grenville's crew however refused to obey these suicidal orders and his officers surrendered what was left of their vessel to the Spanish, on a promise of fair treatment.
Grenville died of his wounds several days later, screaming that his men were "traitors and dogs",Milton, p.272 but the Spanish were not to enjoy their success, nor would Grenville's men survive their deliverance. The Spanish fleet was caught by a cyclone soon after and during a week-long storm Revenge and fifteen Spanish warships and merchant vessels were lost.Paine p. 150  Revenge sank with her mixed prize-crew of seventy Spaniards and English prisoners near the island of Terceira, at the approximate position [tpl]coord|38|46|9|N|27|22|42|W[/tpl].Earle p. 159

==Marriage and progeny==

In 1565 Grenville married Mary St Leger (c.1543-1623), daughter of Sir John St Ledger and heir to her brother. She  outlived her husband and died aged about 80 on 9 November 1623 and was buried at St Mary's Church, Bideford. The family initially lived at Buckland Abbey before moving to a newly built house at Bideford. They had 4 sons, including Bernard Grenville.

==Legacy and honours==

"Thus slain thy valiant Ancestor did ly   
When his one bark a navy did defy 
When now encompas't round the victor stood 
And bath'd his pinnace in his co'quering blood 
Till all his purple current dry'd and spent 
He fell and made the waves his monument 
Where shall ye next fam'd Granvill's ashes stand 
Thy grand syre fills the seas and thou ye land
