DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, US, is a private, national liberal arts college and School of Music with an enrollment of approximately 2,400 students. The school has a Methodist heritage and was originally known as Indiana Asbury University. DePauw is a member of both the Great Lakes Colleges Association and the North Coast Athletic Conference. The Society of Professional Journalists was founded at DePauw. DePauw is home to both the first modern-day sorority and the two longest continuously-running fraternities in the world.

==History==

Indiana Asbury University was founded in 1837 in Greencastle, Indiana, and was named after Francis Asbury, the first American bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The people of Greencastle raised $25,000, equivalent to around $500,000 in 2007 terms, to entice the Methodists to found the college in Greencastle, which was little more than a village at the time.  It was originally established as an all men's school, but began admitting women in 1867.
In 1884 Indiana Asbury University changed its name to DePauw University in honor of Washington C. DePauw, who made a sequence of substantial donations throughout the 1870s, which culminated in his largest single donation that established the School of Music during 1884. Before his death in 1887, Mr. DePauw donated over $600,000 to Indiana Asbury, equal to around $13 million in 2007. In 2002, the school received the largest-ever gift to a liberal arts college, $128 million by the Holton family. Sigma Delta Chi, known today as the Society of Professional Journalists, was founded at the university in 1909 by a group of student journalists, including Eugene C. Pulliam. The world's first Greek-letter sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta, was also founded at DePauw in 1870. DePauw is home to the two longest continually running fraternity chapters in the world, the Delta Chapter of Beta Theta Pi and the Lambda Chapter of Phi Gamma Delta.DePauw Chapters – DePauw University DePauw is home to Indiana's first chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.

==Academics==

DePauw University has an enrollment of about 2,400 students. Students hail from 42 states and 32 countries with a 20.4% multicultural enrollment. DePauw's liberal arts education gives students a chance to gain general knowledge outside of their direct area of study. Students are able to do this by taking classes outside of their degrees and engaging in Winter Term classes and trips.

===East College===

A historic structure located at the center of campus, East College is known to many as the architectural symbol of DePauw's tradition of excellence and learning. The cornerstone for the building was laid on October 20, 1871. The building hosted commencement exercises in June 1874, and in September 1875 all college classes were moved to the building, according to the book, DePauw Through the Years. But work on East College continued until 1882, when the building's basement was completed. East College was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

DePauw was named one of The 50 Best Colleges for young women by CosmoGirl magazine in October 2006. This ranking was based upon such factors as small class size, quality of professor instruction, and the strength of alumni networks.
On August 2, 2010, Princeton Review ranked DePauw as the #10 party school in the US for the 2010–2011 school year, which includes all colleges and universities.

===Greek organizations===

DePauw's Greek system began just eight years after the founding of Indiana Asbury College in 1837. The Delta Chapter of Beta Theta Pi fraternity was established here in 1845, Phi Gamma Delta (commonly known as Fiji) in 1856, Sigma Chi in 1859, Phi Kappa Psi in 1865, Delta Kappa Episilon in 1866, Phi Delta Theta in 1868, Delta Tau Delta in 1871, and Delta Upsilon in 1887.
Women were first admitted to Indiana Asbury in 1867. The first Greek letter fraternity for women soon followed. In January 1870, Kappa Alpha Theta was founded at DePauw as the world's first Greek letter fraternity known among women. Kappa Kapa Gamma established a chapter at DePauw in 1875. Notably, Alpha Chi Omega became the second Alpha Chapter established at DePauw, after Theta, when it was founded here in 1885.
Since their founding, DePauw's Greek organizations have placed a strong emphasis on scholarship and philanthropy, while providing important opportunities to socialize and interact with members of DePauw's diverse community through scheduled projects and social gatherings.
Nationally, DePauw's Greek community makes up one of the largest percentages of a college student body.

===Greek life===

For 2014, DePauw University was again ranked #1 in Greek Life by the Princeton Review.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/09/colleges-biggest-greek-life-2013-14_n_3731846.html|title=Colleges Biggest On Greek Life According To Princeton Review 2013-14 Ranking |publisher=huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26[/tpl] U.S. News & World Report ranked DePauw #3 in the nation for highest percentage of male students belonging to fraternities and #4 in the nation for highest percentage of female students in sororities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/the-short-list-college/articles/2013/12/31/10-universities-with-the-most-students-in-fraternities |title=10 Universities With the Most Students in Fraternities  |publisher=usnews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/most-sororities |title=Most Students in Sororities |publisher=usnews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26[/tpl]
The Greek community consists of fourteen national social fraternities (eleven of which have houses on campus) and ten sororities (six of which have houses on campus).  DePauw has an extensive and substantial Greek history, with both Kappa Alpha Theta, the first Greek-letter organization for women, and Alpha Chi Omega being founded at the school. The Lambda Chapter is the longest continuing chapter of Phi Gamma Delta.
Formal IfC (North-American Interfraternity Conference) and Panhel (National Panhellenic Conference) recruitment for women is held early second semester. Membership intake for National Pan-Hellenic Council organizations (historically black Greek-lettered organizations) usually occurs in the fall and/or the spring.  First-year students are not permitted onto fraternity or sorority property for a period of time at the beginning of each school year.
Greek-letter organizations that formerly maintained chapters on DePauw's campus include the fraternities Delta Chi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, and Lambda Chi Alpha, and the sororities Delta Zeta, Delta Delta Delta, Alpha Omicron Pi and Alpha Gamma Delta.

====Fraternities====

====Sororities====

===Controversy===

In 2006, the national organization of the Delta Zeta sorority reorganized the DePauw chapter, reducing twenty-three of its thirty-five current members (including the chapter president) to alumna status and giving them six weeks to vacate the sorority house. Of the twelve remaining members, six chose to take alumna status. The Delta Zeta national organization explained that its decisions were based on member commitment, but the evicted members said that they were forced to take alumna status because the chapter members were perceived as physically unattractive and "brainy".
Subsequently, on Monday, March 12, 2007, DePauw President Robert G. Bottoms announced that the University would sever its ties with Delta Zeta's national organization, effective at the end of the 2006–2007 academic year.  President Bottoms was quoted as saying, "I came to the conclusion that our approaches to these issues are just incompatible."

==Athletics==

The DePauw Tigers compete in the NCAA Division III North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC). Every year since 1890, DePauw University has competed in American football against its rival Wabash College in what has become the Monon Bell Classic.  The traveling trophy, a 300-pound train bell from the Monon Railroad, made its debut in the rivalry in 1932.  The DePauw-Wabash series is one of the nation's oldest college football rivalries.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl]
In 1933, head coach Ray "Gaumey" Neal led the DePauw Tigers football team to an unbeaten, untied, and unscored opening season. The Tigers compiled a 7–0–0 record and outscored their opponents 136–0. Neal nearly duplicated this feat in 1943, but DePauw, 5–0–1, finished the season with one scoreless tie and six points allowed in a different game. The only points surrendered that season were in a 39–6 victory over Indiana State and the only non-win was a 0–0 tie against Oberlin. The Tigers outscored their opponents, 206–6.
DePauw had been a member of the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference from 1997 to 2011, and won numerous conference championships, most notably in women's basketball, where the school is a Division III power.  DePauw's program had also won the conference's overall "President's Trophy" seven times in that span, including six consecutive President's Trophies from 2005–06 to 2010–11.DEPAUW EXITS SCAC WITH SIXTH CONSECUTIVE PRESIDENTS TROPHY VICTORY, "DEPAUW EXITS SCAC WITH SIXTH CONSECUTIVE PRESIDENTS TROPHY VICTORY", SCAC, retrieved October 14, 2008.  In 2007, the Tigers defeated Washington University in St. Louis to win the Division III title in women's basketball.  The women's softball team won the regional title, advancing to the Division III College World Series for the first time in school history.
DePauw University's women's golf program is the best of any NCAA Division III college in the nation for students seeking a "balanced" experience, according to Golf Digest's third annual College Golf Guide, which appeared in the September 2007 issue.
The DePauw University women's basketball team won the Division III National Championship for the 2006–07 year.  They defeated Washington University in Springfield, Massachusetts to win the first team national championship in the school's history.
In 2012–2013, the women's basketball team won its second Division III National Championship with a 69 to 51 victory over the University of Wisconsin, Whitewater, in the title game in Holland, Michigan. The Tigers finished 34–0 on the season, which is the winningest basketball season at the Division III level for men's or women's basketball.
Over the years, DePauw has sent several players to the NFL, including Dave Finzer (1982), a punter for the Chicago Bears and Seattle Seahawks, and Greg Werner (1989), a tight end for the New York Jets.

Past guests have included Billy Joel, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, The Carpenters, America, and Harry Chapin.

===Society of Professional Journalists===

On May 6, 1909, Sigma Delta Chi was founded by a group of DePauw University student journalists.  The organization officially changed its name to the Society of Professional Journalists in 1988. Today it is the nation's most broad-based journalism organization, encouraging the free practice of journalism and stimulating high standards of ethical behavior. SPJ promotes the free flow of information vital to a well-informed citizenry; works to inspire and educate the next generation of journalists; and protects First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech and press. In 2012, SPJ returned to the DePauw campus with the assistance of Eugene S. Pulliam Distinguished Visiting Professor of Journalism Mark Tatge "Freedom of the Prez » Mark Tatge ".
DePauw's strong tradition of graduating leaders in the field of journalism continues.  Alumni include: "business journalist of the century" Bernard Kilgore and his Wall Street Journal colleague Kenneth C. Hogate; Eugene C. Pulliam and Eugene S. Pulliam of the Indianapolis Star and Central Newspapers chain; Donald Maxwell, former editor of the Chicago Tribune; WCVB-TV/Boston news anchor Heather Unruh;"Boston TV News Anchor Heather Unruh '89 Featured in Nantucket Magazine", Depauw News & Media, September 29, 2008 Robert Giles, curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University and former editor of the Detroit News; John McWethy, ABC News national security correspondent; James B.

===Rector Scholarships===

Since 1919, the Rector Scholar Program has recognized DePauw students of exceptional scholarship and character. To be named a Rector Scholar is to join a prestigious tradition more than 4,000 graduates strong. Rector Scholarships are offered to the top academic applicants offered admission to DePauw. A limited number of full tuition Presidential Rector Scholarships are available.

===Ubben Lecture series===

Endowed by a gift from Timothy H. and Sharon (Williams) Ubben, both 1958 graduates of DePauw, the speakers' series "brings the world to Greencastle". Begun in 1986 and presented free of charge and open to all, Ubben Lecturers have included Bill Clinton, Benazir Bhutto, Margaret Thatcher, Jane Goodall, Tony Blair, and Mikhail Gorbachev. Ron Paul spoke on September 10, 2013 at DePauw, and Fox News Channel anchor Bret Baier, a 1992 DePauw graduate, was an Ubben guest on October 12. Martin Luther King III was on campus November 21, 2013, the night before the 50th anniversary of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
Acclaimed physicist and bestselling author Michio Kaku will speak on May 5, 2014.
The Ubben Series has hosted nearly 100 events in its 28-year history.

===Monon Bell Classic===

Voted "Indiana's Best College Sports Rivalry" by viewers of ESPN in 2005, DePauw University and Wabash College play each November—in the last regular season football game of the year for both teams—for the right to keep or reclaim the Monon Bell.  The two teams first met in 1890.  In 1932, the Monon Railroad donated its approximately 300-pound locomotive bell to be offered as the prize to the winning team each year.  The series is as close as a historic rivalry can be: by virtue of winning the 119th game on November 10, 2012, Wabash leads the all-time series, 58–53–9; since the Monon Bell was introduced, Wabash leads 39–37–6.  The game routinely sells out (up to 11,000 seats, depending upon the venue and seating arrangement) and has been televised by ABC, ESPN2, and AXS TV (where it has appeared for the past eight years, 2006–2013, as well as in 2003).  Each year, alumni from both schools gather at more than 60 locations around the United States for telecast parties, and a commemorative DVD (including historic clips known as "Monon Memories") is produced (there are discs of the 1977, 1993, 1994 and 2000–2013 games).
In 1999, GQ listed the Monon Bell game as reason #3 on its "50 Reasons Why College Football is Better Than Pro Football" list.

===Little 5 Bike Race===

Held in late April every year, DePauw's Little 5 bike race has been a campus tradition since the first race in 1956. The first race was sponsored by Union Board as a fund raiser for the American Cancer Fund. Fourteen teams of male riders from various living units competed. The race has changed some since 1956 as a criterium style scoring system has been put into effect. Individual cyclists compete in a week-long series of events, including Time Trials, Street Sprints, and the actual Little 5 Bicycle race. Composite scores for each individual rider and their respective teams determine individual, as well as team champions.  Today, in addition to the men's events, women compete in the same series of competitive events.  As recently as 2010, the race was held at Blackstock Stadium. However, in 2011 Little 5 events have shifted focus campus. The race is currently held on DePauw University's streets encircling the GCPA and Julian Science and Mathematics Center.

===Boulder Run===

thumb|right|Boulder next to East CollegeThe Boulder Run has become a tradition at DePauw University. Students, streaking from their respective residences, run to and from the Columbia Boulder, located in the center of the campus near the East College building.  Students today perform the Boulder Run for a variety of reasons, though it was originally performed on the day or night of the first snowfall on campus by Phi Kappa Psi, the Greek house nearest the boulder. This tradition was mentioned in Playboy magazine's September 1972 issue. The DePauw police are usually tolerant of the tradition, but students have been arrested when caught.

===Campus Golf===

It is not unusual to see students playing a game of Campus Golf when the weather is nice.  The game of campus golf requires a golf club and a tennis ball.  Players attempt to hit their golf ball against various targets on campus within a number of strokes. The game is similar to frisbee golf, where players attempt to hit targets ranging from trees to buildings with a frisbee.
While playing campus golf, students often wear traditional golf attire, including plaid pants, shirts and sweaters.  Many living units have established "courses" which are played by residents.

===Marvin's===

Marvin's is a small restaurant serving mainly American food such as hamburgers and fries. Marvin's is an important part of student culture, employing students and remaining open later than most restaurants in Greencastle. The garlic cheeseburger (commonly referred to by its initialism, GCB) is considered its specialty.  The popularity of Marvin's extended outside the Greencastle community after an obscure reference was made to the restaurant on the television show Joan of Arcadia.

===World War II===

During World War II, DePauw University was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.depauw.edu/library/archives/dpuinventories/Navy_V12.htm |title=Archives of DePauw University |publisher=Greencastle, Indiana: DePauw University |last= |first= |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |year=2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl]
