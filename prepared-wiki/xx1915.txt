[[Christianity and homosexuality]]

CATEGORIES: Christian law, Christianity-related controversies, LGBT topics and Christianity, Christian belief and doctrine

Within Christianity there are a variety of views on the issues of sexual orientation and homosexuality. The many Christian denominations vary in their position, from condemning homosexual acts as sinful, through being divided on the issue, to seeing it as morally acceptable. Even within a denomination, individuals and groups may hold different views. Further, not all members of a denomination necessarily support their church's views on homosexuality.
The Bible refers several times to homosexual acts. In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, however, the extent to which the Bible mentions the subject - and whether or not it is condemned - has become the subject of debate.  This debate concerns, at the very least, the proper interpretation of the Levitical code; the story of Sodom and Gomorrah; and various Pauline passages, and whether these verses condemn same-sex sexual activities.

==Scriptural views==

The Bible refers to sexual practices that may be called "homosexual" in today's world, but the original language texts of the Bible do not refer explicitly to homosexuality as a sexual orientation. For example, passages in the Old Testament book Leviticus prohibit "lying with mankind as with womankind" and the story of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19) has been interpreted by some as condemning homosexual practice.
The story of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah  does not explicitly identify homosexuality as the sin for which they were destroyed. Most interpreters find this story and a similar one in Judges 19 to condemn the violent rape of guests, rather than homosexuality,Mark Allan Powell, HarperCollins Bible Dictionary (HarperCollins 2011 ISBN 978-0-06207859-9), entry "homosexuality" but the passage has historically been interpreted within Judaism and Christianity as a punishment for homosexuality due to the interpretation that the men of Sodom wished to rape the angels who retrieved Lot.
The New Testament refers to "sexual immorality" on multiple occasions including Matthew 15:19, Mark 7:21, Acts 15:20 and 29, and many more. The definition of "sexual immorality" is disputed among scholars, but it is often included in lists along with adultery (e.g. Matthew 15:19) indicating it is much more than just adultery. Many scholars believe that everything in Leviticus referring to immoral "sexual relations" would be included in the New Testament's "sexual immorality". As such, homosexuality would be included in all of these passages which condemn sexual immorality.
Other interpreters, however, maintain that the Bible does not condemn homosexuality, arguing any of several points: (i) that the passages yield different meanings if placed in historical context, for instance the historical interpretation of Sodom's sins as being other than homosexuality; (ii) there may be questions surrounding the translation of rare or unusual words in the passages that some interpret as referring to homosexuals; (iii) both the Old Testament and New Testament contain passages that describe same-sex relationships; and/or (iv) that loving and committed relationships are not condemned in the passages.Religion Dispatches magazine, Candace Chellew-Hodge  All of these assertions are disputed by other scholars, however.

Other Christian denominations do not view monogamous same-sex relationships as sinful or immoral, and may bless such unions and consider them marriages. These include the United Church of Canada, and the United Church of Christ.,NYTimes.com "United Church of Christ Backs Same-Sex Marriage" all German Lutheran, reformed and united churches in EKD,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ekd.de/EKD-Texte/lebensgemeinschaft_2000.html |title=EKD:Verantwortung und Verlässlichkeit stärken (german) |publisher=Ekd.de |accessdate=2011-11-12[/tpl]  all Swiss reformed churches, the Protestant Church in the Netherlands, the Church of Denmark, the Church of Sweden, the Church of Iceland and the Church of Norway.

The Global Alliance of Affirming Apostolic Pentecostals (GAAAP), traces its roots back to 1980, making it the oldest LGBT-affirming Apostolic Pentecostal denomination in existence.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.affirmingapostolic.com |title=GAAAP |publisher=Affirmingapostolic.com |accessdate=2011-11-12[/tpl] Another such organization is the Affirming Pentecostal Church International, currently the largest affirming Pentecostal organization, with churches in the US, UK, Central and South America, Europe and Africa.
Some denominations state opposing positions. Various parts of the Lutheran Church hold stances on the issue ranging from declaring homosexual acts as sin to acceptance of homosexual relationships. For example, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, the Lutheran Church of Australia, and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod recognize homosexual behavior as intrinsically sinful and seek to minister to those who are struggling with homosexual inclinations.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.lcms.org/graphics/assets/media/LCMS/wa_homosexuality.pdf| title = What about Homosexuality?|publisher = Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod|accessdate = 2009-11-22[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url = http://www.wels.net/what-we-believe/questions-answers/christian-living/acceptance-homosexuals| title = Are homosexuals accepted in WELS?|publisher = Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|accessdate = 2009-11-22[/tpl] However, the Church of Sweden conducts same-sex marriages, while the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America opens the ministry of the church to gay pastors and other professional workers living in committed relationships.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Three-Expressions/Churchwide-Organization/Communication-Services/News/Releases.aspx?a=4253| title = ELCA Assembly Opens Ministry to Partnered Gay and Lesbian Lutherans|publisher = Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|accessdate = 2009-11-22[/tpl] The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) is also much like Lutheranism in regards to homosexuality.

LGBT-affirming denominations regard homosexuality as a natural occurrence. The United Church of Christ celebrates gay marriage,[tpl]cite web  | coauthors =   | title = Stances of Faiths on LGBT Issues: United Church of Christ   | publisher = Human Rights Campaign   | url = http://www.hrc.org/issues/5055.htm   | accessdate = 2010-01-22 [/tpl] and some parts of the Anglican and Lutheran churches allow for the blessing of gay unions. The United Church of Canada also allows same-sex marriage, and views sexual orientation as a gift from God. Within the Anglican communion there are openly gay clergy, for example, Gene Robinson is an openly gay Bishop in the US Episcopal Church. Within the Lutheran communion there are openly gay clergy, for example, bishop Eva Brunne is an openly lesbian Bishop in the Church of Sweden. Such religious groups and denominations interpretation of scripture and doctrine leads them to accept that homosexuality is morally acceptable, and a natural occurrence. For example, in 1988 the United Church of Canada, that country's largest Protestant denomination, affirmed that "a) All persons, regardless of their sexual orientation, who profess Jesus Christ and obedience to Him, are welcome to be or become full member of the Church; and b) All members of the Church are eligible to be considered for the Ordered Ministry."Chronology of Marriage and Equality Rights in the United Church[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] In 2000, the Church's General Assembly further affirmed that "human sexual orientations, whether heterosexual or homosexual, are a gift from God and part of the marvelous diversity of creation.""Same-Sex Marriage Legislation Offers a Win-Win Solution, Says The United Church of Canada," 2005-FEB-01, United Church of Canada, at: http://www.united-church.ca/
In addition, some Christian denominations such as the Moravian Church, believe that the Holy Bible speaks negatively of homosexual acts but, as research on the matter continues, the Moravian Church seeks to establish a policy for ordination and homosexuality.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.moravianseminary.edu/FaithOrder/STHomosexuality1st.html| title = On Homosexuality and Ordination|publisher = The Moravian Interprovincial Faith & Order Commission|accessdate = 2009-11-22[/tpl]

In the 20th century, theologians like Jürgen Moltmann, Hans Küng, John Robinson, Bishop David Jenkins, Don Cupitt, Bishop Jack Spong and Matthew Vines challenged traditional theological positions and understandings of the Bible; following these developments some have suggested that passages have been mistranslated or that they do not refer to what we understand as "homosexuality."See generally http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bibl.htm and subpages therein.  Clay Witt, a minister in the Metropolitan Community Church, explains how theologians and commentators like John Shelby Spong, George Edwards and Michael England interpret injunctions against certain sexual acts as being originally intended as a means of distinguishing religious worship between Abrahamic and the surrounding pagan faiths, within which homosexual acts featured as part of idolatrous religious practices: "England argues that these prohibitions should be seen as being directed against sexual practices of fertility cult worship. As with the earlier reference from Strong’s, he notes that the word 'abomination' used here is directly related to idolatry and idolatrous practices throughout the Hebrew Testament. Edwards makes a similar suggestion, observing that 'the context of the two prohibitions in  [tpl]bibleverse||Leviticus|18:22|KJV|[/tpl] and [tpl]bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV|[/tpl] suggest that what is opposed is not same-sex activity outside the cult, as in the modern secular sense, but within the cult identified as Canaanite'".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hrmcc.org/Resources/StudyDocuments/bibleand.htm |title=Homosexuality and the Bible, Rev.

Some Christians believe that Biblical passages have been mistranslated or that these passages do not refer to LGBT orientation as currently understood.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sisterfriends-together.org/the-bible-and-homosexuality/ |title=The Bible and Homosexuality |accessdate=2008-07-04 |work=SisterFriends Together |publisher=Grace Unfolding Ministries [/tpl]  Liberal Christian scholars, like conservative Christian scholars, accept earlier versions of the texts that make up the Bible in Hebrew or Greek. However, within these early texts there are many terms that modern scholars have interpreted differently from previous generations of scholars. There are concerns with copying errors, forgery, and biases among the translators of later Bibles. They consider some verses such as those they say support slavery[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/sla_bibl.htm |title=What the Bible says about slavery |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |accessdate=2011-11-12[/tpl] or the inferior treatment of womenReligiousTolerance.org. as not being valid today, and against the will of God present in the context of the Bible. They cite these issues when arguing for a change in theological views on sexual relationships to what they say is an earlier view. They differentiate among various sexual practices, treating rape, prostitution, or temple sex rituals as immoral and those within committed relationships as positive regardless of sexual orientation. They view certain verses, which they believe refer only to homosexual rape, as not relevant to consensual homosexual relationships.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ksWrErBqRVUC&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=homosexual+rape+sodom+and+gomorrah&source=bl&ots=9cHm0_jzYf&sig=hhQ7rpPMveL-dK0XJMS9NLjmPBg&hl=en&ei=icdXSr6aPJuZjAf94cTNDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4 |title=Jesus, the Bible, and homosexuality; by Jack Rogers |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=2011-11-12[/tpl]
Yale scholar John Boswell has argued that a number of Early Christians entered into homosexual relationships,[tpl]Citation | last= Boswell | first= John | title= The Marriage of Likeness.

Having partaken in such a rite, a person was prohibited from entering into marriage or taking monastic vows, and the choreography of the service itself closely parallelled that of the marriage rite.Robin Darling Young, "Gay Marriage: Reimagining Church History", First Things 47 (November 1994), p. 43-48.Paul Halsall, Reviewing Boswell (1995). His views have not found wide acceptance, and opponents have argued that this rite sanctified a Platonic brotherly bond, not a homosexual union. He also argued that condemnation of homosexuality began only in the 12th century.John Boswell, The Church and the Homosexual- An Historical Perspective (1979). Critics[tpl]who|date=March 2011[/tpl] of Boswell have pointed out that many earlier doctrinal sources condemn homosexuality in ethical terms without prescribing a punishment, and that Boswell's citations reflected a general trend towards harsher penalties from the 12th century onwards.

He explains on his ministry website: "Inclusive Orthodoxy is the belief that the Church can and must be inclusive of LGBT individuals without sacrificing the Gospel and the Apostolic teachings of the Christian faith."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.truthsetsfree.net/about.htm |title=INCLUSIVE ORTHODOXY: Gay Christian Ministry- Bible and Homosexuality? |publisher=Truthsetsfree.net |accessdate=2011-11-12[/tpl] Cannon's ministry takes a unique approach quite distinct from modern liberal Christians, yet which still supports homosexual relations. His ministry affirms the divine inspiration of the Bible, the authority of Tradition, and says "...that there is a place within the full life and ministry of the Christian Church for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Christians, both those who are called to lifelong celibacy and those who are partnered."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.truthsetsfree.net/index.html |title=Inclusive Orthodoxy ~ The Rev.

==Homosexual Christians and organizations==

George Barna, a conservative Christian author and researcher, conducted a survey in the United States in 2009 that found gay and lesbian people having a Christian affiliation were more numerous than had been presumed.  He characterized some of his leading conclusions from the data as follows:-Quoted in Chellew-Hodge, Candace. "New Poll Shows Gays and Lesbians Believe in God." ReligionDispatches. 25 June 2009. . Retrieved 2009-06-27. "People who portray gay adults as godless, hedonistic, Christian bashers are not working with the facts. A substantial majority of gays cite their faith as a central facet of their life, consider themselves to be Christian, and claim to have some type of meaningful personal commitment to Jesus Christ active in their life today. The data indicate that millions of gay people are interested in faith but not in the local church and do not appear to be focused on the traditional tools and traditions that represent the comfort zone of most churched Christians. Gay adults clearly have a different way of interpreting the Bible on a number of central theological matters, such as perspectives about God. Homosexuals appreciate their faith but they do not prioritize it, and they tend to consider faith to be individual and private rather than communal."   The study of 20 faith-oriented attributes revealed significant differences between the United States heterosexual and homosexual populations sampled, homosexual respondents being less likely to be born again Christians than heterosexual respondents (27% compared to 47%), and the degree of commitment to their faith and families also differed. Other significant contrasts were seen in regards to "liberal" versus "conservative" social positions, as well as in one’s understanding of God, with 43% of homosexual participants sharing the "orthodox, biblical" understanding of God which 71% of heterosexual participants indicate they do. Respondents were not asked to describe themselves as  "born again", but as is standard in Barna studies, this classification was defined according to basic standard criteria. Barna concluded, “The data indicates that millions of gay people are interested in faith but not in the local church and do not appear to be focused on the traditional tools and traditions that represent the comfort zone of most churched Christians." And that "Gay adults clearly have a different way of interpreting the Bible on a number of central theological matters, such as perspectives about God."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/13-culture/282-spiritual-profile-of-homosexual-adults-provides-surprising-insights |title=Spiritual Profile of Homosexual Adults Provides Surprising Insights |publisher=Barna.org |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=2011-11-12[/tpl]
Candace Chellew-Hodge, liberal Christian lesbian founder of online magazine Whoseoever, responded to the findings:
 All in all, I'm grateful for Barna even wandering into the subject of gay and lesbian religious belief. I think his study is important and can go a long way to dispelling the old "gays vs. God" dichotomy that too often gets played out in the media. However, his overall message is still harmful: Gays and lesbians are Christians – they're just not as good as straight ones.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/1590/new_poll_shows_gays_and_lesbians_believe_in_god |title=New Poll Shows Gays and Lesbians Believe in God, Candace Chellew-Hodge, ReligionDispatches, 25 June 2009 (accessed 2009-06-27) |publisher=Religiondispatches.org |accessdate=2011-11-12[/tpl] 
She argued that Barna had formulated his report with undue irony and skepticism, and that he had failed to take into account the reasons for the data which enkindled his "arrière pensée."  The reason why far fewer homosexuals attend church, she argued, is that there are far fewer churches who will accept them. Equally, gays and lesbians do not see the Bible as unequivocally true because they are forced by its use against them to read it more closely and with less credulity, leading them to note its myriad contradictions.
Organizations for homosexual Christians exist across a wide range of beliefs and traditions. The interdenominational Gay Christian Network has some members who affirm same-sex relationships and others who commit themselves to celibacy, groups it refers to as "Side A" and "Side B", respectively.GCN Homepage (website). Gay Christian Network. Retrieved 2008-03-05.[tpl]cite news| title = The Believers| first = Tim| last = Murphy| newspaper = The Advocate| date = 17 June 2008| pages = 52–58[/tpl] According to founder Justin Lee,  "We're just trying to get people together who experience attraction to the same sex, however they have handled that, and who love Jesus and say, OK, you are welcome here, and then let's pray together and figure out where God wants us to take it."Transcript of 18 December 2006 episode of Anderson Cooper 360 
Some organizations cater exclusively to homosexual Christians who do not want to have gay sex, or attraction; the goals of these organizations vary. Some Christian groups focus on simply refraining from gay sex, such as Courage International and North Star.[tpl]cite web|url=http://northstarlds.org |title=North Star web site |publisher=Northstarlds.org |accessdate=2011-11-12[/tpl]  Other groups additionally encourage gay members to reduce or eliminate same-sex attractions.  Exodus International and the associated Love Won Out are examples of such ministries. These groups are sometimes referred to as ex-gay organizations, though many no longer use the term.  Alan Chambers, the president of Exodus, says the term incorrectly implies a complete change in sexual orientation,[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/18/nation/na-exgay18 |title=Approaching agreement in debate over homosexuality |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=18 June 2007 |accessdate=2011-11-12[/tpl] though the group Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays and Gays continues to use the term.
Gay Christian writer and actor Peterson Toscano argues that organizations promoting orientation change are a "ruse."[tpl]cite news |title=Turning off gays |first=Mark |last=Benjamin |newspaper=Salon.com |date=18 July 2005 |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/18/ungay/index.html[/tpl] An organization he co-founded, Beyond Ex-Gay, supports people who feel they have been wounded by such organizations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beyondexgay.com/ |title=Beyond Ex-Gay Group for survivors of Ex-Gay ministries |publisher=Beyondexgay.com |accessdate=2011-11-12[/tpl]
Other groups support or advocate for gay Christians and their relationships.

Sociologist Richard N. Pitt argues that these organizations are only available to LGBT members of liberal denominations, as opposed to those in conservative denominations. His review of the literature on gay Christians suggests that these organizations not only represent the interests of Christians who attend their churches, but (like gay-friendly and gay-affirming churches) also give these members useful responses to homophobic and heterosexist rhetoric.  His research shows that those GLBT Christians who stay at homophobic churches "kill the messenger"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/123306098/HTMLSTART |title=Pitt, Richard N.
