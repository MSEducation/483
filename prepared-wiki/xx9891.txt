[[Poultry]]

CATEGORIES: Poultry, Meat, Livestock, Domesticated birds

Poultry, pronounced (pōl′trē), are domesticated birds kept by humans for the  eggs they produce, their meat, their feathers, or sometimes as pets. These birds are most typically members of the superorder Galloanserae (fowl), especially the order Galliformes (which includes chickens, Guinea fowl, quails and turkeys) and the family Anatidae, in order Anseriformes, commonly known as "waterfowl" and including domestic ducks and domestic geese. Poultry also includes other birds that are killed for their meat, such as the young of pigeons (known as squabs) but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as game. The word "poultry" comes from the French/Norman word poule, itself derived from the Latin word pullus, which means small animal.
The domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago. This may have originally been as a result of people hatching and rearing young birds from eggs collected from the wild, but later involved keeping the birds permanently in captivity. Domesticated chickens may have been used for cockfighting at first and quail kept for their songs, but soon it was realised how useful it was having a captive-bred source of food. Selective breeding for fast growth, egg-laying ability, conformation, plumage and docility took place over the centuries, and modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors. Although some birds are still kept in small flocks in extensive systems, most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises. Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat globally and, along with eggs, provides nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat. All poultry meat should be properly handled and sufficiently cooked in order to reduce the risk of food poisoning. There is some concern that poultry farmers who come in intimate contact with their birds could be exposed to avian influenza, and that new strains of the disease, transmissible man to man, may develop and could pose risks of a pandemic.

==Definition==

The word "poultry" comes from the Middle English "pultrie", from Old French pouletrie, from pouletier, poultry dealer, from poulet, pullet. The word "pullet" itself comes from Middle English pulet, from Old French polet, both from Latin pullus, a young fowl, young animal or chicken.[tpl]cite dictionary | title = Pullet | encyclopedia = The American Heritage: Dictionary of the English Language | volume = 4th edition | pages = | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company | year = 2009 | url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pullet[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fowl |title=Fowl | work=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com  |accessdate=2014-02-12[/tpl] The word "fowl" is of Germanic origin (cf.

"Poultry" is a term used for any kind of domesticated bird, captive-raised for its utility, and traditionally the word has been used to refer to wildfowl (Galliformes) and waterfowl (Anseriformes). "Poultry" can be defined as domestic fowls, including chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks, raised for the production of meat or eggs and the word is also used for the flesh of these birds used as food.[tpl]cite dictionary | title = Poultry | encyclopedia = The American Heritage: Dictionary of the English Language | volume = 4th edition | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company | year = 2009 | url = http://www.thefreedictionary.com/poultry[/tpl] The Encyclopædia Britannica lists the same bird groups but also includes guinea fowl and squabs (young pigeons).[tpl]cite encyclopedia | title = Poultry | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Britannica | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | date = 2013-06-06 | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/472991/poultry [/tpl] In R. D. Crawford's Poultry breeding and genetics, squabs are omitted but Japanese quail and common pheasant are added to the list, the latter frequently being bred in captivity and released into the wild.[tpl]cite book |title=Poultry Breeding and Genetics |last=Crawford |first=R.

==Chickens==

Chickens are medium-sized, chunky birds with an upright stance and are characterised by fleshy red combs and wattles on their heads. Males, known as cocks, are usually larger, more boldly coloured and have more exaggerated plumage than females (hens). Chickens are gregarious, omnivorous, ground-dwelling birds that in their natural surroundings search among the leaf litter for seeds, invertebrates and other small animals. They seldom fly except as a result of perceived danger, preferring to run into the undergrowth if approached. Today's domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is mainly descended from the wild Red Junglefowl of Asia, with some additional input from the Grey Junglefowl.[tpl]Citation | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000010.eor | last1 = Eriksson | first1 = Jonas | last2 = Larson | first2 = Greger | last3 = Gunnarsson | first3 = Ulrika | last4 = Bed'hom | first4 = Bertrand | last5 = Tixier-Boichard | first5 = Michele | last6 = Strömstedt | first6 = Lina | last7 = Wright | first7 = Dominic | author8 = Eriksson J, Larson G, Gunnarsson U, Bed'hom B, Tixier-Boichard M, et al | last9 = Vereijken | first9 = Addie | last10 = Randi | first10 = Ettore | last11 = Jensen | first11 = Per | last12 = Andersson | first12 = Leif | title = Identification of the yellow skin gene reveals a hybrid origin of the domestic chicken | pages = e1000010 | year = 2008 | journal = PLoS Genetics |volume=4 | issue=2[/tpl] Domestication is believed to have taken place between 7,000 and 10,000 years ago and what are thought to be fossilized chicken bones have been found in northeastern China and dated to around 5,400 B.C. Archaeologists believe that domestication was originally for the purpose of cockfighting, the male bird being a doughty fighter. By 4,000 years ago, chickens seem to have reached the Indus Valley and 250 years later, they arrived in Egypt. They were still used for fighting and were regarded as symbols of fertility. The Romans used them in divination, and the Egyptians made a breakthrough when they learned the difficult technique of artificial incubation.[tpl]cite news |title=How the Chicken Conquered the World |author=Adler, Jerry; Lawler, Andrew |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-chicken-conquered-the-world-87583657/?no-ist |newspaper=Smithsonian Magazine |date=2012-06-01 |accessdate=2014-04-14[/tpl] Since then, the keeping of chickens has spread around the world for the production of food with the domestic fowl being a valuable source of both eggs and meat.[tpl]cite journal |author=Storey, A.

Since their domestication, a large number of breeds of chicken have been established but, with the exception of the white Leghorn, most commercial birds are of hybrid origin.[tpl]cite book |title=Poultry Production |last=Card |first=Leslie E. |year=1961 |publisher=Lea & Febiger |isbn=978-0812112412 |url=http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19610102428.html [/tpl] In about 1800, chickens began to be kept on a larger scale, and modern high output poultry farms were present in the United Kingdom from around 1920 and became established in the United States soon after the Second World War. By the mid-20th century, the poultry meat producing industry was of greater importance than the egg-laying industry. Poultry breeding has produced breeds and strains to fulfil different needs; light-framed, egg-laying birds that can produce 300 eggs a year; fast-growing, fleshy birds destined for consumption at a young age, and utility birds which produce both an acceptable number of eggs and a well-fleshed carcase. Male birds are unwanted in the egg-laying industry and can often be identified as soon as they are hatch for subsequent culling. In meat breeds, these birds are usually castrated (often chemically) to prevent aggression and to make them grow larger, yet less tough.
A bantam is a small variety of domestic chicken, either a miniature version of a member of a standard breed, or a "true bantam" with no larger counterpart. The name derives from the town of Bantam in Java[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bantam&allowed_in_frame=0 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2014-02-21[/tpl] where European sailors bought the local small chickens for their shipboard supplies. Bantams may be a quarter to a third of the size of standard birds and lay similarly small eggs. They are kept by small-holders and hobbyists for egg production, for use as broody hens, for ornamental purposes and showing.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.poultryclub.org/breed-gallery/ |title=Breed gallery |publisher=The Poultry Club of Great Britain |accessdate=2014-02-21[/tpl]

==Ducks==

Ducks are medium-sized aquatic birds with broad bills, eyes on the side of the head, fairly long necks, short legs set far back on the body and webbed feet. Males, known as drakes, are often larger than females (simply known as ducks) and are differently coloured in some breeds. Domestic ducks are omnivores eating a variety of animal and plant materials such as aquatic insects, molluscs, worms, small amphibians, waterweed and grasses. They feed in shallow water by dabbling, with their heads underwater and their tails upended. Most domestic ducks are too heavy to fly, and they are social birds, preferring to live and move around together in groups. They keep their plumage waterproof by preening, a process that spreads the secretions of the preen gland over their feathers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rspca.org.uk/ImageLocator/LocateAsset?asset=document&assetId=1232730067367&mode=prd |title=Information sheet: The Welfare of Farmed Ducks |date=2012-07-01 |publisher=RSPCA |accessdate=2014-03-08[/tpl]
Clay models of ducks found in China dating back to 4000 BC may indicate that the domestication of ducks took place there during the Yangshao culture. Even if this is not the case, domestication of the duck took place in the Far East at least 1500 years earlier than in the West. Lucius Columella, writing in the first century BC, advised those who sought to rear ducks to collect wildfowl eggs and put them under a broody hen, because when raised in this way, the ducks "lay aside their wild nature and without hesitation breed when shut up in the bird pen". Despite this, ducks did not appear in agricultural texts in Western Europe until about 810 AD when they begin to be mentioned alongside geese, chickens and peafowl as being used for rental payments made by tenants to landowners.[tpl]cite book |title=Domestic Duck Production: Science and Practice |last=Cherry |first=Peter |last2=Morris |first2=T.

It is widely agreed that the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is the ancestor of all breeds of domestic duck (with the exception of the Muscovy Duck (Cairina moschata), which is not closely related to other ducks). Ducks are farmed mainly for their meat, eggs and down. As is the case with chickens, various breeds have been developed, selected for egg-laying ability, fast growth and a well-covered carcase. The most common commercial breed in the United Kingdom and the United States is the Pekin duck, which can lay two hundred eggs a year and can reach a weight of [tpl]convert|3.5|kg|1|abbr=on[/tpl] in forty-four days. In the Western world, ducks are not as popular as chickens, because the latter produce larger quantities of white, lean meat and are easier to keep intensively, making the price of chicken meat lower than that of duck meat. While popular in haute cuisine, duck appears less frequently in the mass-market food industry. However, things are different in the East. Ducks are more popular there than chickens and are mostly still herded in the traditional way and selected for their ability to find sufficient food in harvested rice fields and other wet environments.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.duckhealth.com/dmstduck.html |title=Domestic ducks |author=Dean, William F.; Sandhu, Tirath S. |year=2008  |publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=2014-02-15[/tpl]

==Geese==

The Greylag Goose (Anser anser) was domesticated by the Egyptians at least three thousand years ago[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/Y4359E/y4359e03.htm |title=Origins and Breeds of Domestic Geese |author=Buckland, R.; Guy, G. |publisher=FAO Agriculture Department |accessdate=2014-02-17[/tpl] and a different wild species, the Swan Goose (Anser cygnoides), was domesticated in Siberia about a thousand years later and is known as a Chinese goose.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bird-friends.com/BirdPage.php?name=White%20Chinese%20Goose |title=White Chinese Goose |author=Streit, Scott |year=2000 |work=Bird Friends Of San Diego County |accessdate=2014-02-17[/tpl] The two hybridise with each other and the large knob at the base of the beak, a noticeable feature of the Chinese goose, is present to a varying extent in these hybrids. The hybrids are fertile and have resulted in several of the modern breeds. Despite their early domestication, geese have never gained the commercial importance of chickens and ducks.
Domestic geese are much larger than their wild counterparts and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture and large bodies with broad rear ends. The Greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production. The fine down of both is valued for use in pillows and padded garments. They forage on grass and weeds, supplementing this with small invertebrates, and one of the attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and can be used as a guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein but the skin has a high fat content, although this contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. The birds are killed at either around ten weeks or about twenty-four weeks. Between these ages there are problems with dressing the carcase because of the presence of developing pin feathers.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.calu.bangor.ac.uk/Technical%20leaflets/040803seasonalgeese.pdf |title=CALU factsheet: Meat geese seasonal production |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2014-03-09[/tpl]
In some countries, geese and ducks are force-fed to produce livers with an exceptionally high fat content for the production of foie gras. Over 75% of world production of this product occurs in France, with lesser industries in Hungary and Bulgaria and a growing production in China.[tpl]cite news |title=China to boost foie gras production |author=Mo Hong'e |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-04/11/content_4409586.htm |newspaper=China View |date=2006-04-11 |accessdate=2014-03-09[/tpl] Foie gras is considered a luxury in many parts of the world, however the process of feeding the birds in this way is banned in many countries on animal welfare grounds.[tpl]cite web |url=http://foodfancy.net/docs/out17_en.pdf |title=Welfare Aspects of the Production of Foie Gras in Ducks and Geese |date=1998-12-16 |work=Report of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare |accessdate=2014-03-09[/tpl]

==Turkeys==

Turkeys are large birds, their nearest relatives being the pheasant and the guineafowl. Males are larger than females and have spreading, fan-shaped tails and a distinctive fleshy wattle, called a snood, that hangs from the top of the beak and is used in courtship display. Wild turkeys can fly but seldom do so, preferring to run with a long, straddling gait. They roost in trees and forage on the ground, feeding on seeds, nuts, berries, grass, foliage, invertebrates, lizards and small snakes.
The modern domesticated turkey is descended from one of six subspecies of Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) found in the present Mexican states of Jalisco, Guerrero and Veracruz.C. Michael Hogan. 2008. Wild turkey: Meleagris gallopavo, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg  Pre-Aztec tribes in south-central Mexico first domesticated the bird around 800 BC, and Pueblo Indians inhabiting the Colorado Plateau in the United States did likewise around 200 BC. They used the feathers for robes, blankets and ceremonial purposes.  It was more than 1,000 years later before they became an important food source.[tpl]cite news |title=Native Americans First Tamed Turkeys 2,000 Years Ago |author=Viegas, Jennifer |url=http://news.discovery.com/history/us-history/native-americans-turkeys-domestication.htm |newspaper= |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2014-02-19[/tpl]  The first Europeans to encounter the bird misidentified it as a guineafowl, a bird that was known as a "turkey fowl" at that time because it had been introduced into Europe via Turkey.[tpl]cite book |title=The Turkey: An American Story |last=Smith |first=Andrew F. |year=2006 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=978-0-252-03163-2 |pages=4–5, 17 |url=http://books.google.de/books?id=J0L3PdUtydEC&pg=PT48&dq=turkey+bird+name&lr=&as_brr=3#v=onepage&q=turkey%20bird%20name&f=false [/tpl]
Commercial turkeys are usually reared indoors under controlled conditions. These are often large buildings, purpose-built to provide ventilation and low light intensities (this reduces the birds' activity and thereby increases the rate of weight gain).  The lights can be switched on for 24-hrs/day, or a range of step-wise light regimens to encourage the birds to feed often and therefore grow rapidly. Females achieve slaughter-weight at about 15 weeks of age and males at about 19. Mature commercial birds may be twice as heavy as their wild counterparts. Many different breeds have been developed but the majority of commercial birds are white as this improves the appearance of the dressed carcass, the pin feathers being less visible.[tpl]cite book |title=Turkeys: Behavior, Management and Well-Being|last=Pond |first=Wilson, G. |last2=Bell |first2=Alan, W.

However, they are increasingly becoming part of the everyday diet in many parts of the world.

==Quail==

The quail is a small to medium-sized cryptically coloured bird. In its natural environment it is found in bushy places, in rough grassland, among agricultural crops and in other places with dense cover. It feeds on seeds, insects and other small invertebrates.[tpl]cite book |title=Coturnix (Coturnix coturnix japonica): standards and guidelines for the breeding, care, and management of laboratory animals |last=Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources (U.S.).

It was known to the Egyptians long before the arrival of chickens and was depicted in hieroglyphs from 2575 BC. It migrated across Egypt in vast flocks and the birds could sometimes be picked up off the ground by hand.[tpl]cite book |title=Quail, Past and Present |last=Roberts |first=Michael |year=1999 |publisher=Domestic Fowl Research |isbn=0-947870-12-1 |pages=11–18 [/tpl] These were the Common Quail (Coturnix coturnix), but modern domesticated flocks are mostly of Japanese Quail (Coturnix japonica) which was probably domesticated as early as the 11th century AD in Japan. They were originally kept as songbirds, and it is thought that they were regularly used in song contests.[tpl]cite journal |last=Mills |first=A. D. |last2=Crawford |first2=L.

In the early twentieth century, Japanese breeders began to selectively breed for increased egg production. By 1940, the quail egg industry was flourishing but the events of World War II led to the complete loss of quail lines bred for their song type, as well as almost all of those bred for egg production. After the war, the few surviving domesticated quail were used to rebuild the industry, and all current commercial and laboratory lines are considered to have originated from this population. Modern birds can lay upward of three hundred eggs a year and countries such as Japan, India, China, Italy, Russia and the United States have established commercial Japanese quail farming industries.[tpl]cite book|last=Hubrecht |first=R. |last2=Kirkwood |first2=J. |title=The UFAW Handbook on the Care and Management of Laboratory and Other Research Animals |year=2010 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |pages=655–674[/tpl] Japanese quails are also used in bio-medical research in fields such as genetics, embryology, nutrition, physiology, pathology and toxicity studies.[tpl]cite book|title=Coturnix (Coturnix coturnix japonica): standards and guidelines for the breeding, care, and management of laboratory animals |year=1969 |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |pages=1–47[/tpl] These quails are closely related to the common quail (Coturnix coturnix) and many young hybrid birds are released into the wild each year to replenish dwindling wild populations.[tpl]cite journal |author=Puigcerver, Manel; Vinyoles, Dolors; Rodríguez-Teijeiro, José Domingo |year=2007 |title=Does restocking with Japanese quail or hybrids affect native populations of common quail Coturnix coturnix? |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=136 |issue=4 |pages=628–635 |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2007.01.007 [/tpl]

==Other poultry==

Guinea fowl originate in Africa and the species most often kept as poultry is the helmeted guinea fowl (Numinidae meleagris). It is a medium size grey or speckled bird with a small naked head with colourful wattles and a knob on top and was domesticated by the time of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators. Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready for the table at the age of about four months.

A squab is the name given to the young of domestic pigeons that are destined for the table. Like other domesticated pigeons, birds used for this purpose are descended from the rock pigeon (Columba livia). Special utility breeds with desirable characteristics are used. Two eggs are laid and incubated for about seventeen days. When they hatch, the squabs are fed by both parents on "pigeon's milk", a thick secretion high in protein produced by the crop. Squabs grow rapidly but are slow to fledge and are ready to leave the nest at 26 to 30 days weighing about [tpl]convert|500|g|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. By this time, the adult pigeons will have laid and be incubating another pair of eggs and a prolific pair should produce two squabs every four weeks during a  breeding season lasting several months.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/213221/Squab-raising.pdf |title=Primefacts: Squab raising |author=Bolla, Gerry |date=2007-04-01 |issn=1832-6668 |publisher=NSW Department of Primary Industries |accessdate=2014-03-09[/tpl]

==Poultry farming==

Worldwide, more chickens are kept than any other type of poultry, with over fifty billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ciwf.org.uk/farm_animals/poultry |title=Compassion in World Farming: Poultry |publisher=Ciwf.org.uk |accessdate=2014-02-12 [/tpl] Traditionally such birds would have been kept extensively in small flocks, foraging during the day and housed at night. This is still the case in developing countries where it is often the women who make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping poultry. However, rising world populations and urbanization have led to the bulk of production being in larger, more intensive specialist units. These are often situated close to where the food is grown or near to where the meat is needed, and result in cheap, safe food being made available for urban communities.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/themes/en/poultry/home.html |title=Animal production and health: Poultry |date=2012-09-25 |publisher=FAO |accessdate=2014-02-27[/tpl] Profitability of production depends very much on the price of feed, which has been rising. High feed costs could limit further development of poultry production.[tpl]cite web|last=Agritrade|title=Poultry Brief 2013|url=http://agritrade.cta.int/Agriculture/Commodities/Poultry/Executive-Brief-Update-2013-Poultry-sector|publisher=CTA|accessdate=28 February 2014-02-28[/tpl]
Free range is a method of husbandry where the birds can roam freely outdoors for at least part of the day. Often this is in large enclosures but the birds have access to natural conditions and can exhibit their normal behaviours. A more intensive system is yarding in which the birds have access to a fenced yard and poultry house at a higher stocking rate. Poultry can also be kept in a barn system, with no access to the open air but with the ability to move around freely inside the building. The most intensive system for egg-laying chickens is battery cages, often set in multiple tiers. In these, several birds share a small cage which restricts their ability to move around and behave in a normal manner. The eggs are laid on the floor of the cage and roll into troughs outside for ease of collection. Battery cages for hens have been illegal in the EU since January 1, 2012.
Chickens raised intensively for their meat are known as "broilers". Breeds have been developed that can grow to an acceptable carcass size ([tpl]convert|2|kg|1|abbr=on[/tpl]) in six weeks or less.  Broilers grow so fast that their legs cannot always support their weight and their hearts and respiratory systems may not be able to supply enough oxygen to their developing muscles. Mortality rates at 1% are much higher than for less-intensively reared laying birds which take eighteen weeks to reach similar weights.[tpl]cite news |title=Ten weeks to live |author=Browne, Anthony |url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/mar/10/foodanddrink.features1 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2002-03-10 |accessdate=2014-02-21[/tpl] Processing the birds is done automatically with conveyor-belt efficiency. They are hung by their feet, stunned, killed, bled, scalded, plucked, have their heads and feet removed, eviscerated, washed, chilled, drained, weighed and packed,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.poultryhub.org/anatomy-and-physiology/meat-chicken-farm-sequence/ | title=Meat chicken farm sequence (processing) | publisher=Poultry Hub | date=2010-08-20 | accessdate=2014-02-21[/tpl] all within the course of little over two hours.
Both intensive and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns. In intensive systems, cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking can be common with some farmers using beak trimming as a preventative measure.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sherwin, C.

In extensive systems the birds are exposed to adverse weather conditions and are vulnerable to predators. Barn systems have been found to have the worst bird welfare. In South-East Asia, a lack of disease control in free range farming has been associated with outbreaks of Avian influenza.[tpl]cite web | url=http://wspa-international.org/publicfiles/Free_range_farming_and_avian_flu__3_.pdf | title=Free-range farming and avian flu in Asia |publisher=WSPA International | accessdate=2014-02-12[/tpl]

==Poultry shows==

In many countries, national and regional poultry shows are held where enthusiasts exhibit their birds which are judged on certain phenotypical breed traits as specified by their respective breed standards. The idea of poultry exhibition may have originated after cock-fighting was made illegal, as a way of maintaining a competitive element in poultry husbandry. Breed standards were drawn up for egg-laying, meat and for purely ornamental birds, aiming for uniformity.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.poultryclub.org/poultry/history-of-poultry/ |title=History of poultry |publisher=Poultry Club of Great Britain |accessdate=2014-02-23[/tpl] Sometimes poultry shows are part of general livestock shows and sometimes they are separate events such as the annual "National Championship Show" in the United Kingdom organised by the Poultry Club of Great Britain.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.poultryclub.org/showing/types-of-show/ |title=Types of Show |publisher=Poultry Club of Great Britain |accessdate=2014-02-23[/tpl] In the United States the largest show was the International Poultry Expo organised by the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association. In 2013, this was amalgamated with the International Feed Expo and the International Meat Expo to give the world's largest livestock trade fair, the International Production & Processing Expo. IPPE attracts exhibitors from around the world and includes an International Poultry Scientific Forum.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ippexpo.com/ |title=International Production & Processing Expo |accessdate=2014-02-23[/tpl]

==Poultry as food==

===Trade===

Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat in the world, accounting for about 30% of total meat production worldwide compared to pork at 38%. Sixteen billion birds are raised annually for consumption, more than half of these in industrialised, factory-like production units.Raloff, Janet. Food for Thought: Global Food Trends. Science News Online. May 31, 2003. Global broiler meat production rose to 84.6 million tonnes in 2013. The largest producers were the United States (20%), China (16.6%), Brazil (15.1%) and the European Union (11.3%).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thepoultrysite.com/reports/?id=1788 |title=USDA Livestock & Poultry: World Markets & Trade  |date=2013-04-30 |publisher=The Poultry Site |accessdate=2014-02-24[/tpl] There are two distinct models of production; the European Union supply chain model seeks to supply products which can be traced back to the farm of origin. This model faces the increasing costs of implementing additional food safety requirements, welfare issues and environmental regulations. In contrast, the United States model turns the product into a commodity.[tpl]cite journal |author=Manning, Louise; Baines, R. N.; Chadd, S. A. |year=2007 |title=Trends in the global poultry meat supply chain |journal=British Food Journal |volume=109 |issue=5 |pages=332–342 |doi=10.1108/00070700710746759 [/tpl]
World production of duck meat was about 4.2 million tonnes in 2011 with China producing two thirds of the total,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thepoultrysite.com/reports/?id=3234 |title=USDA International Livestock & Poultry: World Duck, Goose and Guinea Fowl Meat Situation |date=2013-12-19 |publisher=The Poultry Site |accessdate=2014-03-09[/tpl]  some 1.7 billion birds. Other notable duck-producing countries in the Far East include Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia and South Korea (12% in total). France (3.5%) is the largest producer in the West, followed by other EU nations (3%) and North America (1.7%). China was also by far the largest producer of goose and guinea fowl meat, with a 94% share of the 2.6 million tonne global market.
Global egg production was expected to reach 65.5 million tonnes in 2013, surpassing all previous years.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thepoultrysite.com/articles/2653/global-poultry-trends-world-egg-production-sets-a-record-despite-slower-growth |title=Global Poultry Trends: World Egg Production Sets a Record Despite Slower Growth  |date=2013-01-16 |publisher=The Poultry Site |accessdate=2014-02-24[/tpl] Between 2000 and 2010, egg production was growing globally at around 2% per year, but since then growth has slowed down to nearer 1%.

===Cuts of poultry===

Poultry is available fresh or frozen, as whole birds or as joints, with bone-in or de-boned, seasoned in various ways, raw or ready cooked. The meatiest parts of a bird are the flight muscles on its chest, called "breast" meat, and the walking muscles on the legs, called the "thigh" and "drumstick". The wings are also eaten (Buffalo wings are a popular example in the United States) and may be split into three segments, the meatier "drumette", the "wingette" (also called the "flat"), and the wing tip (also called the "flapper").[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.feedcousa.com/poultrymeatcuts.htm |title=Poultry meat cuts |publisher=FeedCo USA |accessdate=2014-03-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chow.com/food-news/105062/america-youre-getting-two-thirds-of-the-chicken-wing/ |title=America, You’re Getting Two-Thirds of the Hot Wing |accessdate=2014-04-03[/tpl] In Japan, the wing is frequently separated, and these parts are referred to as 手羽元 (teba-moto "wing base") and 手羽先 (teba-saki "wing tip").[tpl]cite book |title=日本料理用語辞典 (英文): Ingredients & Culture |last=Hosking |first=Richard|year=1996 |publisher=Tuttle Publishing |isbn=9780804820424 |page=156 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1avA7zEYCQ0C&pg=PA156&lpg=PA156&dq=teba-moto+teba-saki&source=bl&ots=8A4AcgHlzF&sig=h1DI13kcemqZd081UXYstkzGnnc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=N8URU_6IIY-qhQfSoYDQCQ&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=teba-moto%20teba-saki&f=false [/tpl]
Dark meat, which avian myologists refer to as "red muscle," is used for sustained activity—chiefly walking, in the case of a chicken. The dark colour comes from the protein myoglobin, which plays a key role in oxygen uptake within cells. White muscle, in contrast, is suitable only for short, ineffectual bursts of activity such as, for chickens, flying. Thus the chicken's leg and thigh meat are dark while its breast meat (which makes up the primary flight muscles) is white. Other birds with breast muscle more suitable for sustained flight, such as ducks and geese, have red muscle (and therefore dark meat) throughout.[tpl]cite web |url=http://dwb.unl.edu/teacher/nsf/c10/c10links/www.fsis.usda.gov/oa/pubs/mpcolor.htm |title=The color of meat and poultry |date=2000-05-01 |publisher=USDA: Food Safety and Inspection Service |accessdate=2014-03-01[/tpl]  Some cuts of meat including poultry expose the microscopic regular structure of intracellular muscle fibrils which can diffract light and produce iridescent colours, an optical phenomenon sometimes called structural colouration.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/2/4/499 | title=Foods | work=Iridescence in Meat Caused by Surface Gratings | year=2013 | author=Martinez-Hurtado, J.

==Health and disease (humans)==

Poultry meat and eggs provide nutritionally beneficial food containing protein of high quality. This is accompanied by low levels of fat which have a favourable mix of fatty acids.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/themes/en/poultry/human_health.html |title=Poultry and human heath |date=2013-08-01 |publisher=FAO |accessdate=2014-02-25[/tpl] Chicken meat contains about two to three times as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured by weight.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nuinfo-proto4.northwestern.edu/nutrition/factsheets/lipids.html |title=Feinberg School: Nutrition Fact Sheet: Lipids |publisher=Northwestern University |accessdate=2009-08-24 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110720014201/http://nuinfo-proto4.northwestern.edu/nutrition/factsheets/lipids.html |archivedate=2011-07-20[/tpl] However, for boneless, skinless chicken breast, the amount is much lower. A 100g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 grams of fat and 31 grams of protein, compared to 10 grams of fat and 27 grams of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.Nutrition Data - 100g Chicken BreastNutrition Data - 100g Lean Skirt Steak
A 2011 study by the Translational Genomics Research Institute showed that 47% of the meat and poultry sold in United States grocery stores was contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus, and 52% of the bacteria concerned showed resistance to at least three groups of antibiotics. Thorough cooking of the product would kill these bacteria, but there is still a risk of cross-contamination from improper handling of the raw product.[tpl]cite news |title=US meat and poultry is widely contaminated with drug-resistant Staph bacteria, study finds |author=The Translational Genomics Research Institute |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110415083153.htm |newspaper=Science Daily |date=2011-04-15 |accessdate=2014-02-27[/tpl]  There is also some risk to consumers of poultry meat and eggs of infections caused by bacterial infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter. Poultry products may become contaminated by these bacteria during handling, processing, marketing or storage resulting in food poisoning in humans if the product is improperly cooked or handled.
In general, avian influenza is a disease of birds caused by bird-specific influenza A virus that is not normally transferred to people; however, people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest risk of becoming infected with the virus and this is of particular concern in areas such as southeastern Asia where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected. It is possible that the virus could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/ |title=Information on Avian Influenza |work=Seasonal Influenza (Flu) |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=2014-03-03[/tpl]
Bacteria can be grown in the laboratory on nutrient culture medium, but viruses need living cells in which to replicate. It has been found that many vaccines to infectious diseases can be grown in fertilised chicken eggs. Millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements, a complex process that takes about six months after the decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine. A problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised, but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm336267.htm |title=The evolution, and revolution, of flu vaccines |date=2013-01-18 |work=FDA: Consumer updates |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=2014-03-06[/tpl] Cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when it may be difficult to acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile, fertilised eggs.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/vaccines-pandemic-threats |title=Vaccines for pandemic threats |date=2014-01-15 |work=The History of Vaccines |accessdate=2014-03-05[/tpl]
