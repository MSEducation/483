[[Hydrus]]

CATEGORIES: Hydrus (constellation), Constellations, Southern constellations

Hydrus [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|d|r|ə|s[/tpl] is a small constellation in the deep southern sky. It was first depicted on a celestial atlas by Johann Bayer in his 1603 Uranometria. The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille  charted the brighter stars and gave their Bayer designations in 1756. Its name means "male water snake", as opposed to Hydra, a much larger constellation that represents a female water snake. It remains below the horizon for most Northern Hemisphere observers.
The brightest star is the 2.8-magnitude Beta Hydri, also the closest reasonably bright star to the south celestial pole. Pulsating between magnitude 3.26 and 3.33, Gamma Hydri is a variable red giant some 60 times the diameter of our Sun. Lying near it is VW Hydri, one of the brightest dwarf novae in the heavens. Four star systems have been found to have exoplanets to date, most notably HD 10180, which could bear up to nine planetary companions.

==History==

Hydrus was one of the twelve constellations established by the Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius from the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman, who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the Eerste Schipvaart, to the East Indies. It first appeared on a 35-cm (14 in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in the German cartographer Johann Bayer's Uranometria of 1603.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer%20southern.htm | title=Johann Bayer's Southern Star Chart|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|author-link=Ian Ridpath|publisher=self-published |work=Star Tales | accessdate= 23 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url = http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/constellations/hydrus.html |title = Hydrus (Water Snake) |publisher = Chandra X-ray Observatory |accessdate =10 July 2012[/tpl] De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue the same year under the Dutch name De Waterslang, "The Water Snake",[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/startales1c.htm#houtman | title=Frederick de Houtman's Catalogue|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|publisher=self-published  |work=Star Tales | accessdate= 11 September 2013[/tpl] it representing a type of snake encountered on the expedition rather than a mythical creature.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/hydrus.htm | title=Hydrus—the Lesser Water Snake|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|author-link=Ian Ridpath|publisher=self-published  |work=Star Tales| accessdate= 29 September 2013[/tpl] The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille called it l’Hydre Mâle on the 1756 version of his planisphere of the southern skies, distinguishing it from the feminine Hydra. The French name was retained by Jean Fortin in 1776 for his Atlas Céleste, while Lacaille Latinised the name to Hydrus for his revised Coelum Australe Stelliferum in 1763.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm | title=Lacaille’s Southern Planisphere of 1756|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|author-link=Ian Ridpath|publisher=self-published  |work=Star Tales | accessdate= 29 September 2013[/tpl]

==Characteristics==

Irregular in shape, Hydrus is bordered by Mensa to the southeast, Eridanus to the east, Horologium and Reticulum to the northeast, Phoenix to the north, Tucana to the northwest and west, and Octans to the south; Lacaille had shortened Hydrus' tail to make space for this last constellation he had drawn up. Covering 243 square degrees and 0.589% of the night sky, it ranks 61st of the 88 constellations in size.[tpl]cite book |last=Bagnall |first=Philip M. |title=The Star Atlas Companion: What You Need to Know about the Constellations |publisher=Springer  |location=New York, New York |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-4614-0830-7 |page=251|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KcIg02TKW6QC&pg=PA251[/tpl] The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is 'Hyi'.[tpl]cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris |author-link=Henry Norris Russell | title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=30 | page=469 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922 [/tpl] The official constellation boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 12 segments.

===Stars===

Keyzer and de Houtman assigned 15 stars to the constellation in their Malay and Madagascan vocabulary, with a star that would be later designated as Alpha Hydri marking the head, Gamma the chest and a number of stars that were later allocated to Tucana, Reticulum, Mensa and Horologium marking the body and tail.[tpl]cite journal | title = On Frederick de Houtman's Catalogue of Southern Stars, and the Origin of the Southern Constellations | author= Knobel, Edward B. |journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume= 77| pages=414–32 422 | bibcode = 1917MNRAS..77..414K |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1917MNRAS..77..414K/0000414.000.html |year=1917[/tpl] Lacaille charted and designated 20 stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Tau in 1756. Of these, he used the designations Eta, Pi and Tau twice each, for three sets of two stars close together, and omitted Omicron and Xi. He assigned Rho to a star that subsequent astronomers were unable to find.[tpl]cite book  | last = Wagman  | first = Morton  | year = 2003  | title = Lost Stars: Lost, Missing and Troublesome Stars from the Catalogues of Johannes Bayer, Nicholas Louis de Lacaille, John Flamsteed, and Sundry Others  | publisher = The McDonald & Woodward Publishing Company  | location = Blacksburg, VA  | isbn = 978-0-939923-78-6 |pages=176–77[/tpl]
Beta Hydri, the brightest star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth.[tpl]cite web |url = http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=Beta+hyi&NbIdent=1&Radius=2&Radius.unit=arcmin&submit=submit+id |title = Beta Hydri |work = SIMBAD Astronomical Database|publisher=Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg |accessdate = 11 September 2013[/tpl] It has about 104% of the mass of the Sun and 181% of the Sun's radius, with more than three times the Sun's luminosity.[tpl]Cite journal | last1=Brandão | first1=I.

As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant star to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun may look like in the far distant future, making it an object of interest to astronomers. It is also the closest bright star to the south celestial pole.

Hydrus contains only faint deep-sky objects. IC 1717 was a deep-sky object discovered by the Danish astronomer John Louis Emil Dreyer in the late 19th century.
