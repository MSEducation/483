==Review==

It may be more intellectual and fact finding. Though some facts were not shown like in Ayodhya Dispute episode,the fact was not aired that many kar sevaks were gunned down by the police on 30 October 1990 on orders of the then Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, when they gathered in Ayodhya as participants of the Rath-Yatra and their bodies were thrown in the river Saryu.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1990-decision-to-order-firing-on-kar-sevaks-painful-Mulayam-Singh-Yadav-says/articleshow/21092809.cmshttp://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mulayam-singh-yadav-ayodhya-remark-a-ploy-ahead-of-polls-jdu/1/291580.htmlhttp://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2022/stories/20031107007900600.htm
