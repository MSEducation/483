Russians ([tpl]lang-ru|русские[/tpl], russkiye) are an East Slavic ethnic group native to Russia,"Slav." Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 30 July 2011. speaking the Russian language and primarily live in Russia and neighboring countries.
They are the most numerous ethnic group in Russia constituting more than 80% of the country's population according to the census of 2010, and the most numerous ethnic group in Europe.

==Ethnonym==

There are two Russian words which are commonly translated into English as "Russians": "русские" (russkiye), which means "ethnic Russians" and "россияне" (rossiyane), which means "citizens of Russia". The first word refers to all ethnic Russians, regardless of what country they live in and irrespective of whether or not they hold Russian citizenship, and does not include members of Russia's ethnic minorities. The second word refers to all people holding citizenship of Russia, regardless of their ethnicity, and does not include ethnic Russians living outside of Russia. English translations do not always distinguish these two words.

==Origins==

The modern Russian is formed from two groups, Northern and Southern, which were made up of Krivichs, Ilmen Slavs, Radimichs, Vyatiches and Severians East Slavic tribes. Genetic studies show that modern Russians do not differ significantly from Poles, Slovenians, or Ukrainians. Some ethnographers, like Zelenin, affirm that Russians are more similar to Belarusians and Ukrainians than southern Russians are to northern Russians. Russians in northern European Russia share moderate genetic similarities with Uralic peoples,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/28sep2005/russians.html |title=Новости NEWSru.com :: Ученые завершили масштабное исследование генофонда русского народа (Фотороботы) |publisher=Newsru.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22[/tpl] who lived in modern north central European Russia and were partly assimilated by the Slavs as the Slavs migrated northeastwards. Among those peoples were Merya*Aleksey Uvarov, "Étude sur les peuples primitifs de la Russie. Les mériens" (1875) and Muromian.[tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl]
Outside archaeological remains, little is known about the predecessors to Russians in general prior to 859 AD when the Primary Chronicle starts.The Primary Chronicle is a history of the Ancient Rus' from around 850 to 1110 originally compiled in Kiev about 1113 It is thought that by 600 AD, the Slavs had split linguistically into southern, western, and eastern branches. The eastern branch was settled between the Southern Bug and the Dnieper Rivers in what is now Ukraine; from the 1st century AD through almost the millennium, they spread peacefully northward to the Baltic region, forming the Dregovich, Radimich and Vyatich Slavic tribes on the Baltic substratum, therefore having language features such as vowel reduction. Later, both Belarusians and South Russians formed themselves on this ethnic linguistic ground.Pivtorak. Formation and dialectal differenciaton of the Old Rus language. 1988
Since the 6th century, another group of Slavs moved from Pomerania to the northeast of the Baltic Sea, where they encountered the Varangians of the Rus' Khaganate and established the important regional center of Novgorod. The same Slavic ethnic population also settled the present-day Tver Oblast and the region of Beloozero. With the Uralic substratum, they formed Krivichs and Ilmen Slavs.

==Population==

In 2010 year the Russians population in the world was 129 million people (of which 86% in Russia, CIS and Baltic countries - 11.5%, other country - 2.5%).журнал «Демоскоп Weekly» № 571 - 572 14 - 31 октября 2013.

Russians are the most numerous ethnic group in Europe and one of the largest in the world with a population of about 150 million people worldwide.

===Russia===

Roughly 111 million ethnic Russians live in Russia, from which 80% lives in the European part of Russia and 20% of Russian citizens live in the Asian part of the country.

===Russians outside of Russia===

Ethnic Russians historically migrated throughout the area of former Russian Empire and Soviet Union, sometimes encouraged to re-settle in borderlands by Tsarist and later Soviet government.Russians left behind in Central Asia. BBC News. November 23, 2005. On some occasions ethnic Russian communities, such as Lipovans who settled in the Danube delta or Doukhobors in Canada, emigrated as religious dissidents fleeing the central authority.
After the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War starting in 1917, many Russians were forced to leave their homeland fleeing the Bolshevik regime, and millions became refugees. Many white émigrés were participants in the White movement, although the term is broadly applied to anyone who may have left the country due to the change in regime.
Today the largest ethnic Russian diasporas outside of Russia live in former Soviet states such as Ukraine (about 8 million), Kazakhstan (about 3.8 million), Belarus (about 785,000), Latvia (about 556,000) with the most Russian settlement out of the Baltic States which includes Lithuania and Estonia, Uzbekistan (about 650,000) and Kyrgyzstan (about 419,000).
Over a million Russian Jews emigrated to Israel during and after the Refusenik movements; some brought ethnic Russian relatives along with them. Over a million Russian-speaking immigrants live in Israel,Study: Soviet immigrants outperform Israeli students. Haaretz.com. 10/02/2008. around two-thirds of them Jewish.Q&A Lily Galili on 'The Russians in Israel'. Haaretz.com There are also small Russian communities in the Balkans, including Lipovans in the Danube delta,"Saving the souls of Russia's exiled Lipovans". The Daily Telegraph. April 9, 2013. Central European nations such as Germany and Poland, as well Russians settled in China, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina and Australia. These communities may identify themselves either as Russians or citizens of these countries, or both, to varying degrees.
People who had arrived in Latvia and Estonia during the Soviet era, including their descendants born in these countries, mostly Russians, became stateless after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and were provided only with an option to acquire naturalised citizenship. The language issue is still contentious, particularly in Latvia, where ethnic Russians have protested against plans to liquidate education in minority languages, including Russian. Since 1992, Estonia has naturalized some 137,000 residents of undefined citizenship, mainly ethnic Russians. 136,000, or 10 percent of the total population, remain without citizenship. Both the European Union and the Council of Europe, as well as the Russian government, expressed their concern during the 1990s about minority rights in several countries, most notably Latvia and Estonia. In Moldova, the Transnistria region (where 30.4% of population is Russian) broke away from government control amid fears the country would soon reunite with Romania. In June 2006, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the plan to introduce a national policy aiming at encouraging ethnic Russians to immigrate to Russia.[tpl]cite web|last=Bigg |first=Claire |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1070573.html |title=Latvia: Ethnic Russians Divided On Moscow's Repatriation Scheme |publisher=Rferl.org |date=2006-08-15 |accessdate=2012-07-22[/tpl]
Significant numbers of Russians emigrated to Canada, Australia and the United States. Brighton Beach, Brooklyn and South Beach, Staten Island in New York City is an example of a large community of recent Russian and Jewish Russian immigrants. Other examples are Sunny Isles Beach, a northern suburb of Miami, and in  West Hollywood of the Los Angeles area.
At the same time, many ethnic Russians from former Soviet territories have emigrated to Russia itself since the 1990s. Many of them became refugees from a number of states of Central Asia and Caucasus (as well as from the separatist Chechen Republic), forced to flee during political unrest and hostilities towards Russians.
After the Russian Revolution in 1917, many Russians who were identified with the White army moved to China — most of them settling in Harbin and Shanghai. By the 1930s, Harbin had 100,000 Russians. Many of these Russians had to move back to the Soviet Union after World War II. Today, a large group of people in northern China can still speak Russian as a second language.
Russians (eluosizu) are one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People's Republic of China (as the Russ); there are approximately 15,600 Russian Chinese living mostly in northern Xinjiang, and also in Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang.

==Culture==

Russian culture originated from that of the East Slavs, who were largely polytheists, and had a specific way of life in the wooded areas of Eastern and Northern Europe. The Scandinavian Vikings, or Varangians, also took part in forming the Russian identity and state in the early Kievan Rus' period of the late 1st millennium AD. The Rus' accepted Christianity from the Byzantine Empire in 988, and this largely defined Russian culture for the next millennium, namely as a synthesis of Slavic and Byzantine cultures.[tpl]cite web|last=excerpted from Glenn E. Curtis (ed.)|title=Russia: A Country Study: Kievan Rus' and Mongol Periods|publisher=Washington, DC: Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress|year=1998|url=http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Kievan.html|accessdate=2007-07-20[/tpl] After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Russia remained the largest Orthodox nation in the world and claimed succession to the Byzantine legacy in the form of the Third Rome idea.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] At different points of its history, the country was strongly influenced by European culture, and since the reforms of Peter the Great Russian culture largely developed in the context of Western culture. For most of the 20th century, Marxist ideology shaped the culture of the Soviet Union, where Russia, i.e. the Russian SFSR, was the largest and leading part.
Russian culture is varied and unique in many respects. It has a rich history and a long tradition in all of the arts,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia|title=Russia|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2008-01-31[/tpl] especially in fields of literature[tpl]cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564269/Russian_Literature.html|title=Russian Literature|last=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007|accessdate=2008-01-07[/tpl] and philosophy, classical music[tpl]cite web|title=Russia::Music|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2009-10-05|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia/38636/Music[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://petersburgcity.com/news/culture/2005/11/18/theatre/|title=A Tale of Two Operas|publisher=Petersburg City|accessdate=2008-01-11[/tpl] and ballet,[tpl]cite book|author=Garafola, L|title=Diaghilev's Ballets Russes|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=576|isbn=0-19-505701-5|year=1989[/tpl] architecture and painting, cinema[tpl]cite web|title=Russia::Motion pictures|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2007|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia|accessdate=2007-12-27[/tpl] and animation, all of which had considerable influence on world culture.
Russian literature is known for such notable writers as Aleksandr Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Anton Chekhov, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Boris Pasternak, Anna Akhmatova, Joseph Brodsky, Maxim Gorky, Vladimir Nabokov, Mikhail Sholokhov, Mikhail Bulgakov, Andrei Platonov, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Varlam Shalamov. Russians also gave the classical music world some very famous composers, including Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and his contemporaries, the Mighty Handful, including Modest Mussorgsky and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. In the 20th-century Russian music was credited with such influential composers as Dmitri Shostakovich, Sergei Prokofiev, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Igor Stravinski, Georgy Sviridov, and Alfred Schnittke. 

===Language===

Russian ([tpl]lang|ru|русский язык[/tpl] (help·info), transliteration: [tpl]transl|ru|ALA|Russkiy yazyk[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-ru|ˈruskʲɪj jɪˈzɨk|[/tpl]) is the most geographically widespread language of Eurasia and the most widely spoken of the Slavic languages. Russian belongs to the family of Indo-European languages and is one of three (or, according to some authorities[tpl]who|date=September 2012[/tpl], four) living members of the East Slavic languages, the others being Belarusian, Ukrainian and Rusyn.
Examples of Old East Slavonic are attested from the 10th century onwards, and while Russian preserves much of East Slavonic grammar and a Common Slavonic word base, modern Russian exhibits a large stock of borrowed international vocabulary for politics, science, and technology. Due to the status of the Soviet Union as a super power, Russian had great political importance in the 20th century, and is one of the official languages of the United Nations.
Russian has palatal secondary articulation of consonants, the so-called soft and hard sounds. This distinction is found in almost all consonant phonemes and is one of the most distinguishing features of the language. Another important aspect is the reduction of unstressed vowels, not entirely unlike a similar process present in most forms of English. Stress in Russian is generally quite unpredictable and can be placed on almost any syllable, one of the most difficult aspects for foreign language learners.
