==Early life==

Born and raised in the Turner's Cross area of Cork, Martin was the son of Paddy Martin (1923–2012), a former Irish international boxer and CIÉ employee, and Eileen "Lana" Corbett (1929–2010). The third child in a family of five, Martin's eldest brother Seán and his twin brother Pádraig subsequently became involved in local politics in Cork.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] His two younger sisters, Eileen and Máiréad, have remained apolitical.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] Martin attended Coláiste Chríost Rí before studying arts at University College Cork.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
It was during his time at university that Martin became involved in politics. He was a prominent member of the cumann of Ógra Fianna Fáil, the youth wing of the party before later serving as national chairman of Ógra.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] After graduating with a BA degree, Martin later completed his MA in political history. Martin subsequently completed a higher diploma in education and began a career as a history teacher in Presentation Brothers College.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
In 2009, he published his masters thesis as a book: Freedom to Choose: Cork and Party Politics in Ireland 1918–1932.ISBN 184889001X

==Early political career==

Martin's time as a teacher was short-lived as he left after just one year to become a full-time politician when he secured election to Cork Corporation as a Fianna Fáil candidate in 1985.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] It was from this local base that he decided to embark on a career in national politics a little under two years later.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] Martin was one of four candidates who secured the Fianna Fáil nomination to run in the Cork South–Central constituency in the 1987 general election, however, he polled the fewest first preference votes out of the four and failed to be elected.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] He became a member of the Fianna Fáil national executive in 1988.
In 1989, Taoiseach Charles Haughey called a snap election and Martin was once again added to the Fianna Fáil ticket in Cork South–Central. On that occasion, he secured the most first preference votes out of any Fianna Fáil candidate and secured election to Dáil Éireann.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] He has been re-elected at each subsequent election.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=3923|title=Micheál Martin|publisher=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=2 October 2009[/tpl]
In his first few years as a TD, he served on a number of Oireachtas committees, including those dealing with Irish language, crime and finance.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] Martin served as Lord Mayor of Cork in 1992.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] Two years later in December 1994, Bertie Ahern was elected as the new leader of Fianna Fáil as the party lost power and went into opposition in the Dáil. Martin, however, joined Ahern's new front bench at the start of 1995 as spokesperson on Education and the Gaeltacht.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]

==Cabinet career (1997–2011)==

===Minister for Education and Science  (1997–2000)===

When Fianna Fáil returned to power following the 1997 general election, Martin was appointed to the newly-expanded position of Minister for Education and Science. At 36, he was the youngest member of Bertie Ahern's first cabinet.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] As minister, his tenure was characterised by an increase in spending at all levels of education, while a number of educational initiatives, such as a review of the primary school curriculum and the introduction of special needs assistants, were also initiated.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/1999/0727/funding.html|title=Record £160m funding for third-level institutions|date=27 July 1999|publisher=RTÉ News and Current Affairs|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|accessdate=1 March 2010[/tpl]

===Minister for Health and Children (2000–04)===

In a cabinet reshuffle in January 2000, Martin was appointed Minister for Health and Children. Martin's predecessor, Brian Cowen, described the position as ‘like being in Angola’, because landmines can go off at any time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2007/11/11/story28122.asp|title=The HSE – Angola all over again|work=The Sunday Business Post|date=11 November 2007[/tpl]
In spite of tough opposition, Martin introduced a ban on tobacco smoking in all Irish workplaces, including pubs and restaurants. The Minister announced on 30 January 2003 his intention to have the ban in place on 1 January 2004.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2003/0130/smoking.html|title=Martin to introduce smoking ban 2004|date=30 January 2003|publisher=RTÉ News and Current Affairs|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|accessdate=1 March 2010[/tpl] He visited New York in September 2003 to look at how a similar ban worked there and signed the UN's framework convention on tobacco control at their headquarters.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2003/0914/smoking.html|title=Martin to assess NY smoking ban|date=14 September 2003|publisher=RTÉ News and Current Affairs|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|accessdate=1 March 2010[/tpl] The smoking ban was introduced on 29 March 2004,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/categories/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/health-and-safety/ban_on_smoking_in_the_workplace_in_ireland|title=Ban on smoking in the workplace in Ireland|work=Citizens Information Ireland|accessdate=2 October 2009[/tpl] making Ireland the first country in the world to introduce a blanket ban on smoking in the workplace.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,115581,00.html|publisher=Fox News Channel|title=Ireland's Smoking Ban Declared a Success|date=30 March 2004[/tpl] Martin was presented with an award by the European Respiratory Society in Glasgow on 4 September 2004 for his work on the smoking ban.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2004/0904/smoking.html|title=Martin to receive award for smoking ban|date=4 September 2004|publisher=RTÉ News and Current Affairs|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|accessdate=1 March 2010[/tpl]
He introduced the first overhaul[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl] of the health system in 30 years. It included the abolition of the health boards and establishment of the Health Service Executive. He deregulated the country's pharmacies from 31 January 2002.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2002/0131/pharmacy-business.html|title=Pharmacy deregulation begins|date=31 January 2002|publisher=RTÉ News and Current Affairs|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|accessdate=1 March 2010[/tpl]

===Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (2004–08)===

In September 2004, Martin exchanged government positions with Mary Harney to become Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In September 2005 the government's economic record on the cost of living came under scrutiny from the RTÉ television programme Rip-Off Republic. This led to Martin abolishing the controversial Groceries Order 1987, a piece of legislation which prohibited the sale of groceries below cost price.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/grocery-prices-to-drop-from-today-after-orders-abolition-108597.html|title=Grocery prices to drop from today after order's abolition|work=Irish Independent|date=20 March 2006[/tpl]

===Minister for Foreign Affairs (2008–11)===

In a cabinet reshuffle in May 2008, following the election of Brian Cowen as Taoiseach, Martin became Minister for Foreign Affairs. One of the first issues that he had to deal with was the referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] Martin led the Government campaign. Despite the overwhelming majority of Government and Opposition parties being supporting a Yes vote, the electorate rejected the Government's recommendation. Martin and Cowen failed to convince the Irish public to support the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon and this protest expressed in the referendum on 12 June 2008 plunged the government into a major political crisis.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/lisbon-treaty/cowen-disaster-little-authority-and-no-leadership-1410607.html|title=Cowen disaster: little authority and no leadership|work=Irish Independent|date=15 June 2008[/tpl]

====Criticism of Gaza blockade====

As Minister for Foreign Affairs Martin was critical of the blockade of Gaza, particularly after being denied access to the area in 2009. He wrote to Spain (as President of the EU) to suggest that the body send a team of foreign ministers to the area in 2010.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/1221/mideast.html|title=Martin critical of Gaza 'open prison'|publisher=RTÉ News|date=21 December 2009|accessdate=21 December 2009[/tpl] He made his first visit there himself on 25 February 2010, on a one-day humanitarian mission through the Egyptian border.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0225/gaza.html|title=Martin to visit UN projects in Gaza|publisher=RTÉ News|date=25 February 2010|accessdate=25 February 2010[/tpl] In doing so, Martin became the first Western foreign minister to visit Gaza since Hamas took control in 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://arabnews.com/middleeast/article22374.ece|title=Irish foreign minister makes ground-breaking Gaza visit|date=25 February 2010|accessdate=25 February 2010|publisher=ArabNews[/tpl] While in Gaza, the Minister toured hospitals and schools.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=119486&sectionid=351020202|title=Irish delegation examines Gaza misery|date=25 February 2010|accessdate=25 February 2010|publisher=Press TV[/tpl] He was accompanied by United Nations vehicles.

==Leadership of Fianna Fáil and 2011 general election==

In September 2010, doubts about Brian Cowen's abilities and political judgement as Taoiseach and party leader emerged following a disastrous early-morning radio interview on Morning Ireland. Cowen survived, however, that same month Martin admitted that he and other cabinet members, namedly Brian Lenihan and Dermot Ahern, harboured ambitions to lead the party should a vacancy arise.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/kfmhkfojaukf/rss2/|title=Martin admits leadership ambition|work=Irish Examiner |date=22 September 2010|accessdate=29 January 2011[/tpl] While some backbench rebel Fianna Fáil TD's called for Cowen to go, no cabinet minister publicly came forward to challenge the incumbent. In spite of this, Martin once again expressed an interest in running for the leadership of Fianna Fáil once the vacancy arises in December 2010 on RTÉ's Saturday View radio programme.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/1204/breaking12.html |title=Martin 'interested' in FF role|work=The Irish Times |date=4 December 2010 |accessdate=8 December 2010[/tpl]
On 16 January 2011, Martin announced that he would vote against Brian Cowen in the upcoming confidence motion in his leadership of the party. He offered to resign as Minister for Foreign Affairs, but his resignation was initially refused by Cowen.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0116/politics.html |title=Martin calls for Fianna Fáil to change leader |publisher=RTÉ News |date=16 January 2011 |accessdate=16 January 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0116/breaking2.html |title=Martin to vote against Cowen |work=The Irish Times |date=16 January 2011 |accessdate=16 January 2011[/tpl] Following the result of the motion, which Cowen won, the resignation was accepted.
On 22 January 2011, just days after winning a vote of confidence, Brian Cowen announced that he was stepping down as leader of Fianna Fáil but would remain as Taoiseach. On a special RTÉ News programme that day, a number of Fianna Fáil TDs came on the air and publicly backed Martin for the leadership. Later that evening, Martin formally announced his intention to seek support for the leadership of Fianna Fáil.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0124/fiannafail.html|title=Four candidates to replace Cowen as FF leader|date=24 January 2011|publisher=RTÉ News|accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl] He was immediately seen as the front-runner; however, a number of other candidates entered the field to ensure a contest.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] Finance Minister Brian Lenihan was seen as Martin's biggest rival for the position, however, his position was weakened due to his public declaration of support for Cowen the previous week.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] Éamon Ó Cuív and Mary Hanafin, while both having different support bases within the party, were both seen as outsiders.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]
On 26 January 2011, the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party met to elect their new leader. Martin was proposed by Dara Calleary and seconded by Áine Brady and received 33 first preference votes.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] It was more than double that of his nearest rival Ó Cuív, however, he was still short of winning the election.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] After Hanafin and Lenihan had been eliminated from the contest and their surplus votes distributed, Martin emerged with 50 votes and was duly elected the eighth leader of Fianna Fáil.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0126/breaking8.html|title=Micheál Martin elected as eighth leader of Fianna Fáil|date=26 January 2011|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/micheal-martin-elected-new-leader-of-fianna-fail-2512319.html|title=Micheal Martin elected new leader of Fianna Fáil |date=26 January 2011|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl] Upon election he pledged to reinvigorate Fianna Fáil from its traditional centre ground roots, believing that Fianna Fáil has never delivered to the Irish people through the labels of left and right.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0126/breaking8.html |title=Micheál Martin elected as eighth leader of Fianna Fáil – The Irish Times – Wed, 26 January 2011 |work=The Irish Times |date= 1 January 2011|accessdate=18 September 2011[/tpl]
Martin led the party into the 2011 general election, which saw Fianna Fáil swept from power in the worst defeat of a sitting government in the history of the Irish state. The party saw its first-preference vote more than halved, and lost 57 seats, representing a decline of 75%, being the worst electoral performance in its 85-year history.
Martin and other Fianna Fáil leaders concluded early on that they would not be reelected to another term in government, and had hoped to hold onto at least 30 seats. In the wake of what has been described as "defeat on a historic scale", Martin pledged to renew the party "at every level".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2011/0301/1224291075967.html |title=Recapturing relevance a huge challenge for FF |work=The Irish Times |date=1 March 2011 |accessdate=18 September 2011 |first=Diarmaid |last=Ferriter[/tpl]
During the Seanad elections, Martin recommended support for 10 candidates, in an attempt to bring new blood into the parliamentary party. This caused resentment from Fianna Fáil councillors and incumbent Fianna Fáil senators.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0428/1224295622276.html |title=Martin's choices a cause of 'resentment'|work=The Irish Times |date=28 April 2011 |accessdate=18 September 2011 |first1=Michael |last1=O'Regan |first2=Jimmy |last2=Walsh[/tpl] Only five of the recommended ten were elected, although the party performed better than expected winning fourteen seats.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2011/0429/1224295675478.html |title=Fianna Fáil on course to beat Seanad election expectations |work=The Irish Times |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=18 September 2011 |first=Stephen |last=Collins[/tpl]
In August 2011, Martin approached Gay Byrne as a possible nominee for the Presidential election, but this approached caused controversy within his party, who favoured an internal candidate, Brian Crowley, which was exacerbated on the declining of the nomination by Byrne and the withdrawal from the process by Crowley.[tpl]cite news|author=Rustic retreats |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/fionnan-sheahan-another-fateful-blow-dealt-to-the-soldiers-of-destiny-2879609.html |title=Another fateful blow dealt to the Soldiers of Destiny |work=The Irish Independent |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=18 September 2011[/tpl]
In an opinion poll in September 2011, Martin's party, Fianna Fáil's popularity fell to 10%, several points lower than their performance in the February 2011 election.[tpl]cite news|author=Dublin v Kerry |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/ff-slumps-to-10pc-in-poll-but-norris-can-lift-party-2880209.html |title=FF slumps to 10pc in poll |work=The Irish Independent |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=18 September 2011[/tpl]
