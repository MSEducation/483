==History==

===Ancient era===

The region surrounding Užice was settled by Illyrians, specifically the Parthini and Autariatae tribes. Their tombs are found throughout the region.  In the 3rd century BC, Scordisci were formed here after the Gallic invasion of the Balkans. The region was conquered by the Roman Empire in 168 BC, being organized into the Illyricum province in 32-27 BC, and after 10 AD, the province of Dalmatia. The town municipium Capedunum existed here during Roman times, its name point at Celtic origin, (dun, fortress),p. 340 similarly to Singidunum, the founding of Belgrade.

===Middle Ages===

Slavs are mentioned in the region since the 520s, when tribes pillaged the Eastern Roman Empire; during Justinian I's rule (527–565), up to 100,000 Slavs raided Thessalonica.  The region (Drina župania) was part of the Vlastimirović dynasty when they established the Serbian Principality, the first Serb state. Across the Drina, the army of Časlav fought the invading Magyars in ca 950-960. The region was annexed by the Byzantine Empire after 969, becoming part of the katepanate of Ras, then the Theme of Sirmium.
The region may have been returned to Serbian hands in the 1040s, during the revolt against the Byzantines led by Stefan Vojislav, progenitor of the Vojislavljević dynasty. In 1083, Vukan and Marko are appointed vassal princes in Rascia. In 1091, Vukan becomes independent, while Duklja (up until this, the most powerful Serbian principality) slowly crumbles, eventually coming under the rule of "Rascia" - The Serbian Grand Principality stays in the hands of the Vukanović dynasty until another line of the same dynasty is put to rule by Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143-1180). Zavida, thought to be a brother of Uroš II and Desa, fled after trying to acquire an appanage or the throne itself for himself. Zavida's four sons divided the rule, each holding česti (parts): Stracimir ruled West Morava (of which Užice is part of), Miroslav ruled Zahumlje and Travunia, and Stefan Nemanja was given Toplica, Ibar, Rasina and Reke.p. 31 Stefan Nemanja eventually wrestled the rule when defeating Tihomir in 1171, Stracimir continued ruling in Nemanja's name. The Nemanjić dynasty is named after Nemanja, who began the prospering of Serbia in the Middle Ages.
When King Dragutin abdicated in favor of his brother Milutin, he retained control of Užice region and was given the Mačva region by the Hungarian king, of which he formed the Kingdom of Srem. When King Dragutin died, his lands were annexed to Serbia. The old Fortress, on the hill, was founded in the mid 14th century. After the death of Emperor Dušan the Mighty, in the period known as the "fall of the Serbian Empire", Užice came under the control of Vojislav Vojinović, a nobleman in the service of Emperor Uroš the Weak. When Vojislav died, his nephew Nikola Altomanović controls the region. When child-less Uroš died, the former Imperial provincial lords begin fighting each other. Serbian Autokrator Lazar Hrebeljanović and Tvrtko I of Bosnia defeated Nikola Altomanović, and divided his lands between themselves. Nikola was blinded in the fortress on the orders of Stefan Musić. Užice came under the control of Lazar, then the Serbian Despotate under his son Stefan Lazarević.

===Ottoman conquests===

Užice fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1463, and was part of the Sanjak of Smederevo until 1807, when it was liberated by the Serbian revolutionaries, during the First Serbian Uprising. It was the administrative seat of the region and district, with many merchants and craftsmen. Only at the end of the 19th century, it has started developing as an industrial town. So, a small factory making blankets and homespun felt started operating in Užice in 1868, and a leather factory was founded in 1880. Nevertheless, Užice was the first town in Serbia with a hydroelectric power plant producing alternating current. It was built on the Đetinja River in 1900.

===World War II===

In 1941, Užice was liberated by the Partizans, who chose it as the capital of the Republic of Užice. This republic was a short-lived military mini-state that existed in the autumn of 1941 in the western part of Nazi-occupied Serbia.
The Republic of Užice comprised almost the whole of western Serbia, with a population of more than 300,000 people. It was located between the Skrapež river in the north, the river Drina in the west, the river Zapadna Morava in the east, and the Uvac river in the south.
At that time, the factories and workshops in Užice mainly produced items for military use; trains and roads were functioning, books and newspapers were published, while war was engulfing both Yugoslavia and the world in general.
In November 1941, the German army re-occupied this territory, while the majority of Partisan forces escaped to Bosnia, Sandžak and Montenegro.

===Yugoslav era===

Within the former Yugoslavia (established after the Second world War), Užice was renamed "Titovo Užice" (Титово Ужице). From 1992, following the collapse of the pro-communist administration, "Titove" (meaning Tito's) was removed, leaving the original city name Užice. It was one of eight towns renamed Tito's town in Yugoslavia. Due to being "Titove" and central-planning communist system, Užice received significant amounts of investments in infrastructure and local factories, which made the city one of the most highy developed for its size in former Yugoslavia. Following the break-up of the region, all the towns dropped the "Titove" title.
