==History==

Under its old name of Chen ([tpl]CJKV|t=陳|s=陈|p=Chén[/tpl]), during the Warring States period Jiangling became the capital of the  State of Chu after the Qin army captured their old capital at Ying. Chen itself was sacked in 241 BC and the capital moved to Shouchun (壽春/寿春). Jiangling then served as late capital of the Southern Liang Dynasty.
Under the Tang dynasty, it served as the southern capital and was known as Nandu ([tpl]lang|zh|南都[/tpl]).Theobald, Ulrich. China Knowledge. "Chinese History - Tang Dynasty 唐 (618-907): Map and Geography". Accessed 19 Oct 2012.
