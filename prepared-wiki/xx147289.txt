Gilbert Cosme (born May 25, 1975) better known by his ring names El Mesías and Ricky Banderas, is a Puerto Rican professional wrestler. He began his career in the International Wrestling Association based on Puerto Rico. While performing in the company, he won the IWA World Heavyweight Championship on five instances and held minor championships on fifteen separate occasions, before leaving the company in 2006. On March 12, 2006 he debuted in Asistencia Asesoría y Administración, a promotion based in Mexico as a character named Muerte Cibernetica and was involved in an angle where this character was "killed." In November 2006, Cosme was involved in the tapings of the Wrestling Society X television series, where he was the second and last wrestler to win the WSX Championship.
Following a month of performing in the International Wrestling Association, Cosme returned to Asistencia Asesoría y Administración in a special event presented by the company, this time under the ring name of El Mesías. In September 2007, the company organized a unification tournament where all of the champions and first contenders participated. Over the course of the tournament, he won the GPCW Super-X Monster Championship and IWC World Heavyweight Championship, and on the tournament's finale, he became the first wrestler to win the AAA World Heavyweight Championship. While working in Mexico, Cosme signed a contract with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) where he debuted as Judas Mesias on September 13, 2007. In March 2008 his association with TNA came to an end and he focused most of his time on AAA. In 2010 Cosme debuted for Puerto Rican World Wrestling Council, where he won the Universal Heavyweight Championship.

==Professional wrestling career==

===International Wrestling Association (1999–2009)===

Cosme began wrestling training in 1996, when he was instructed by a former wrestler. During this time he was enrolled in the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico located in Bayamón, his major concentration was in computer technology, after completing two years of study, he decided to begin wrestling as a profession after meeting Victor Quiñones in the gym. In 1997, after working in the independent circuit he moved to Mexico and performed there, and became involved in a project to develop Hispanic talent organized by the World Wrestling Federation.
Cosme subsequently debuted in the International Wrestling Association (IWA) in 1999. He was given the gimmick of "El Patriota" Ricky Banderas, a name that, according to Cosme, was created by fusing the artistic names of Latin musician Ricky Martín and actor Antonio Banderas.[tpl]cite web|title=IWA: Entrevista a Ricky Banderas|url=http://www.prwrestling.com/entrevistas/banderas.html|language=Spanish|accessdate=2007-05-06[/tpl] He debuted in Extreme Championship Wrestling on that year, where he worked in a televised match. Following a period of teaming with Los Boricuas, his character was teamed with Germán Figueroa who wrestled as Gran Apolo, and formed a tag team dubbed La Nueva Generacion, which won the IWA Tag Team Championship three times. On August 21, 2000, in a show in Levittown, Puerto Rico, Cosme's character turned on Gran Apolo. Following this, he joined the company's dominant heel stable, Los Intocables, along with Miguel Pérez and Jesús Castillo. After the stable's dissolution, he was involved in another stable named Starr Corporation, where after Cosme's insistence his character became darker and was renamed "El Mesías" Ricky Banderas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGh2ZJ0CM8c|title=Se Confiesa Judas Mesias|author=Javier Gonzalez|publisher=Lucha Libre Online|language=Spanish|date=2008-01-08|accessdate=2008-07-14[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Following this, he was teamed up with Shane Sewell in a stable known as Los Hermanos en Dolor. In 2001, Cosme performed in a tryout match for the World Wrestling Federation and in a pay per view event on Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling. He won the IWA heavyweight title for a third time on June 15, 2002, and remained champion until Ray González debuted with the company as "Rey Fénix", in a match that he describes as the best match he had wrestled at the moment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://iwapr.net/nm/publish/news_39.html|title=Resultados Golpe De Estado – Carolina|publisher=International Wrestling Association|language=Spanish|date=2002-09-15|accessdate=2008-01-09 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020917114045/http://iwapr.net/nm/publish/news_39.html |archivedate=2002-09-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=IWA:Ricky Banderas contesta sus preguntas|url=http://www.prwrestling.com/entrevistas/banderas2.html| language=Spanish|accessdate=2007-06-07[/tpl]
Cosme's gimmick underwent another change when it joined then-dominant heel stable "La Compania" led by Savio Vega (Juan Rivera). This was followed by his fourth title run after he defeated Gran Apolo on January 6, 2003. He was booked as a heel until October 9, 2003, when Vega's group turned on him. Following this, he feuded with Christopher Kindred under his "Slash Venom" gimmick, which peaked when Vampiro (Ian Richard Hodgkinson) was brought by the company to form a stable which feuded with Gran Apolo and Venom. In 2004, he feuded with Hangman Hughes (Mike Hughes), Kasey James (Kurt Sellers), El Diamante (Julio César Cruz), and Bison. In 2005, he turned heel again, this time leading a stable known as La Cruz del Diablo which feuded with other groups led by Savio Vega and Ray Gonzalez. Following an angle where he feuded over a number one contender spot, Cosme departed from the company and signed a contract to wrestle in Mexico. Subsequently, he continued making sporadic appearances for the company, including a brief stay in 2007. On July 19, 2009, Cosme was booked to defeat Dennis Rivera in the promotion's tenth anniversary event.

===Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (2006–present)===

Following the culmination of his contract with the International Wrestling Association, Cosme signed a contract with Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA). He debuted on March 12, 2006, as "Muerte Cibernética" a rudo (villanous) enforcer supposedly brought to the company by Octavio López Arriola under his "Cibernético" gimmick to feud with "La Parka". This gimmick consisted of Cosme wearing a traditional Mexican wrestling mask, often a modified version of the one used by La Parka. This character was placed in a feud with La Parka, which lasted several months. This angle came to a conclusion at Triplemania XIV, where Cosme's character was booked to lose a Mask vs. Mask match.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prwrestling.com/noticias/4754.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070704065523/http://www.prwrestling.com/noticias/4754.php|title=MEXICO: La Parka vence a Banderas en TripleManía|publisher=Puerto Rico Wrestling|date=2006-06-19|archivedate=2007-07-07|accessdate=2007-05-15[/tpl]
Following a legitimate injury suffered by López, Cosme's gimmick was slightly changed, launching into an angle where he pursued the leadership of Cibernético's stable, which then went by the name of La Secta Cibernetica. The character was booked to be the leader of the stable after supposedly convincing several members of the group to join him changing the name of the group to La Secta Diabólica. The events of the angle were used to hype an eventual feud between López and Cosme's characters that took place in December 2006. In the angle, Cosme won the first encounter between the two with help of his stable. The angle culminated in a Casket match between the two characters. Cibernético was booked to win the match and subsequently "kill" his opponent by throwing him into an active volcano.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingobserver.com/wo/news/headlines/default.asp?aID=18320|title=AAA Guerra de Titanes report|publisher=Wrestling Observer|accessdate=2007-06-07[/tpl] This was used to explain Cosme's absence when he departed from the company to wrestle in the International Wrestling Association. During this time he also wrestled for Panama Wrestling Crew in Panama and in Ecuador.
Following a month of performing in Puerto Rico, Cosme returned to Asistencia Asesoría y Administración in an annual event entitled Rey de Reyes under a new gimmick, changing his name to El Mesías.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.luchalibreonline.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=5078|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070322171028/http://www.luchalibreonline.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=5078|archivedate=2007-03-22|title=AAA : Resultados Rey de Reyes| author=Javier Gonzalez| publisher=Lucha Libre Online|language=Spanish|date=2007-03-19|accessdate=2008-01-25[/tpl] From then on, he started to get a bigger push as a main event heel, feuding with Cibernético and his stable "Los Hell Brothers". During the feud, Cosme was both leader of La Secta del Mesías and member of La Legión Extranjera. Later, Cosme took both the IWC heavyweight championship from Cibernético and the GPCW SUPER-X Monster Title from La Parka in the preliminary rounds of the AAA World Heavyweight Title tournament.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas_deportes/noticia_v1.php?id_noticia=5729 |title=El Mesías, nuevo Campeón Completo IWC|publisher=Medio Tiempo|language=Spanish|date=2007-08-20|accessdate=2007-09-30 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071213044515/http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas_deportes/noticia_v1.php?id_noticia=5729 |archivedate = 2007-12-13[/tpl] As Mesías, he became the first wrestler to win the AAA World Heavyweight Championship in AAA's pay-per-view event Verano de Escandalo after defeating Chessman(Kevin Citlali Zamora) by disqualification.[tpl]cite web|url=http://triplea.com.mx/ESP/verano.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071012110515/http://triplea.com.mx/ESP/verano.htm|archivedate=2007-10-12|title=Verano de Escandalo| publisher=Asistencia Asesoría y Administración|language=Spanish|accessdate=2007-09-30[/tpl] On November 29, 2007, he successfully defended the company's championship in a triple threat match at a pay-per-view titled Guerra de Titanes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/estO/notas/n516250.htm|title=Brutal "Guerra de Titanes IX"|author=Alfredo Ascencio|publisher=Organización Editorial Mexicana|language=Spanish|date=2007-12-07|accessdate=2008-07-14[/tpl] In March 2008, he returned to AAA after several months of inactivity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/esto/notas/n619329.htm|title=Reaparece el Mesías|publisher=Organización Editorial Mexicana|language=Spanish|date=2008-03-07|accessdate=2008-07-14[/tpl] On March 16, 2008, Cosme dropped the championship to Cibernético.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/esto/notas/n631858.htm|title=Cibernético aplaca a El Mesías|publisher=Organización Editorial Mexicana|language=Spanish|date=2008-03-17|accessdate=2008-07-14[/tpl] He was subsecuently involved in an angle with Vampiro, leding to a match at Triplemania XVI, which concluded as a time-limit draw.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.todosports.com/inicio/articulos/extremo/14484.aspx|title=AAA: Llegó el día de Triplemanía XVI|author=Carlos Martínez|publisher=todosports.com|language=Spanish|date=2008-06-13|accessdate=2008-07-14|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080618165944/http://www.todosports.com/inicio/articulos/extremo/14484.aspx |archivedate = June 18, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] On October 24, 2008, Cosme won the Copa Antonio Peña, defeating six other wrestlers in the process.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/noticias/mesias-ganador-copa-antonio.html|title=Mesías obtiene la Copa Antonio Peña|publisher=Asistencia Asesoría y Administración|language=Spanish|date=2008-10-25|accessdate=2008-10-28|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081027003209/http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/noticias/mesias-ganador-copa-antonio.html |archivedate=2008-10-27[/tpl] Joaquín Roldán, was responsible for presenting the relevant trophy.

Cosme participated as Banderas in the Wrestling Society X television series (taped in Los Angeles, California), with the gimmick of a disgruntled and kayfabe disfigured man pursuing a feud with Vampiro.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.luchalibreonline.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=4989|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070310024346/http://www.luchalibreonline.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=4989|archivedate=2007-03-10|title=WSX: Resultados Programa #4|author=David Rivera|publisher=Lucha Libre Online|date=2007-02-28|accessdate=2008-01-25[/tpl] The booking of the feud commenced after Banderas threw a fireball at Vampiro's face, which resulted in MTV pulling the episode from its original airdate, with concerns that viewers would try it at home.[tpl]cite web|title=Amidst network turmoil and qualms over content, MTV pulls Wrestling Society X from the air, complete details|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=22952&p=1|publisher=PWInsider|accessdate=16 April 2014[/tpl]
The reason behind the pursuit was explained in the following episode in a promo, where he claimed that Vampiro rigged a casket with explosives during a match, with the explosion resulting in the damage done to his face. On the eighth episode (which was taped on November 15, 2006) of the series, Banderas won the WSX Championship in his debut match for the promotion. Beforehand, he was involved in a series of brawls with Youth Suicide (Andre Verdun), as well as an allusion to a partnership with 6-Pac (Sean Waltman).

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2007–2008, 2013)===

As noted on the "TNA Mobile" service, Cosme signed a contract with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Cosme was billed as James Mitchell's kayfabe son and thus Abyss' brother. Beginning on July 1, 2007, vignettes began to air for this "monster-like" character. His name was eventually billed as Judas Mesias.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.prwrestling.com/noticiasprw/4291.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080201011332/http://www.prwrestling.com/noticiasprw/4291.php|archivedate=2008-02-01| title=TNA: Nueva promo de la llegada de Banderas|accessdate=2007-07-23[/tpl] At No Surrender, he pulled Abyss under the ring by cutting a hole through it with a knife and pulling him underneath.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/banderas.html|title=Wrestling – Judas Mesias|author=Rob McCormick|publisher=Slam!

On September 21, 2007, it was reported that Cosme was suffering from sciatica and that the condition's treatment required several weeks of rest, followed by physical therapy to recover. This injury was the result of a fall from a ladder during a championship match at AAA's Verano de Escandalo pay-per-view, which also knocked him out.[tpl]cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/2007/09/21/el-mesias-fuera-de-accion/|title=El Mesías Fuera de Acción|date=2007-09-21|accessdate=2010-06-13|publisher=Superluchas.net[/tpl]
Mesias returned on the December 13, 2007, episode of Impact! where he attacked Abyss by strangling him with a piece of barbed wire, which he also used to cut his forehead open. He then repeatedly hit Abyss in the head with a chair. He finished his assault by delivering his finisher, Straight to Hell to Abyss on the same chair.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/results/tnaimpact/tnaimpact2006/1197611710.shtml|title=Impact Results – 12/13/07 (Daniels fired, 2-on-1 main event, & more)|last=Martin|first=Adam|date=2007-12-14|accessdate=2010-06-13|publisher=WrestleView.com[/tpl] In his TNA pay-per-view debut, Mesias defeated Abyss at Final Resolution after hitting Abyss with his finisher onto a barbed wire steel chair.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2006/1199678261.shtml|title=Final Resolution PPV Results – 1/6 – Orlando, FL (Angle vs Cage, more)|last=Martin|first=Adam|date=2008-01-06|accessdate=2008-07-14|publisher=WrestleView.com[/tpl] This feud continued at Against All Odds, organized on February 10, 2008.

===World Wrestling Council and La Revancha del Siglo (2009–2012)===

An agreement between Cosme and the World Wrestling Council was first rumored on November 26, 2009.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.prwrestling.com/noticiasprw2/1375.php| title=Cerca la llegada de Banderas a WWC| author=McGyver| publisher=Puerto Rico Wrestling| language=Spanish| date=2009-11-26| accessdate=2009-11-29[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The promotion made the official announcement two days later, including highlights of his career in a compilation video displayed during a special event titled Crossfire. His debut was scheduled for January 16, 2010, being booked as Ricky Banderas in a contest against Carly Colón.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.prwrestling.com/noticiasprw2/1379.php| title=Oficial: Banderas vs. Carlito en enero| author=McGyver| publisher=Puerto Rico Wrestling| language=Spanish| date=2009-11-28| accessdate=2009-11-29[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Ray González was subsequently included, winning a three-way-contest where the WWC's first winner of the "Wrestler of the Decade Cup" was to be decided. The following week, both were booked in a rematch, with Banderas winning the cup. On July 11, 2010, Banderas was booked to act as special referee at Aniversario 2010, but was subsequently included in a stipulation match against Colón. His character made a heel turn in this event, attacking both Colón and Hugo Savinovich.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.prwrestling.com/noticiasprw2/2160.php| title=Aniversario WWC en Bayamón 7/11| publisher=Puerto Rico Wrestling| language=Spanish| date=2010-07-11| accessdate=2010-07-16| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100715053920/http://www.prwrestling.com/noticiasprw2/2160.php | archivedate=2010-07-15[/tpl] On January 8, 2011, Banderas defeated Colón, with help from an interfering Shane Sewell, to win the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship for the first time.[tpl]cite web| url=http://superluchas.net/2011/01/09/resultados-euphoria-2011-%E2%80%93-mesias-se-corona-campeon-universal-mascarita-dorada-vence-a-pierrothito-mvp-en-puerto-rico-%E2%80%93-shane-the-glamour-boy-regresa-a-wwc%E2%80%A6/ | title=Resultados: Euphoria 2011 – Mesías se corona Campeón Universal- Mascarita Dorada vence a Pierrothito- MVP en Puerto Rico – Shane the Glamour Boy regresa a WWC… | author= Piñeiro, Anthony | publisher=SuperLuchas Magazine| language=Spanish| date=January 9, 2011| accessdate=January 9, 2011[/tpl] Cosme was stripped of the title upon returning to the IWA, headlining an angle that revisited the promotion's first decade. His sole match took place on April 2, 2011, where he defeated González, who had since returned to his masked "Rey Fénix" persona, in the main event of the evening.[tpl]cite web| url=http://superluchas.net/2011/04/03/resultados-juicio-final-2011-coliseo-de-toa-baja-ricky-banderas-logra-vencer-a-ray-fenix-tua-despoja-a-escobar-del-campeonato-mundial-de-la-iwa-%E2%80%93-inicia-nueva-rina-entre-diabolico-y-chris/ | title=Resultados: Juicio Final 2011 Coliseo de Toa Baja- Ricky Banderas logra vencer a Ray Fénix – Tua despoja a Escobar del Campeonato Mundial de la IWA – Inicia nueva riña entre Diabólico y Chris Ángel | author= Piñeiro, Anthony | publisher=SuperLuchas Magazine| language=Spanish| date=April 3, 2011| accessdate=April 3, 2011[/tpl] Following this match Cosme's involvement in the IWA concluded, remaining inactive in Puerto Rico until  January 7, 2012, when he reappeared in WWC programming asking for an opportunity to challenge Carly Colón for the Universal Heavyweight Championship. The challenge was accepted and took place at Euphoria 2012, but was inconclusive after Savio Vega interrupted by distrating Colón, which drained what was left of the preestablished time.
