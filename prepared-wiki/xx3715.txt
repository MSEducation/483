Hamburg ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|m|b|ɜr|ɡ[/tpl]; [tpl]IPA-de|ˈhambʊʁk[/tpl], local pronunciation [tpl]IPA-dedia|ˈhambʊɪ̯ç|[/tpl]; Low German/Low Saxon: Hamborg [tpl]IPA-dedia|ˈhaˑmbɔːx|[/tpl]), officially Freie und Hansestadt HamburgConstitution of Hamburg [tpl]Citation |title=Verfassung der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg |url=http://hh.juris.de/hh/gesamt/Verf_HA.htm#Verf_HA_rahmen |date=6 June 1952 |edition=11th |accessdate=21 September 2008[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl]  (Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg), is the second largest city in Germany and the eighth largest city in the European Union.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.citymayors.com/features/euro_cities1.html |title=Europe's largest cities |work=City Mayors Statistics |accessdate=29 December 2009[/tpl] It is also the thirteenth largest German state.  It is home to over 1.8 million people, while the Hamburg Metropolitan Region (including parts of the neighbouring Federal States of Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein) has more than 5 million inhabitants. On the river Elbe, the port of Hamburg is the second largest port in Europe (after the Port of Rotterdam) and tenth largest worldwide.
The official name reflects its history as a member of the medieval Hanseatic League, as a free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire, and that it is a city-state,  and one of the 16 states of Germany. Before the 1871 Unification of Germany, it was a fully sovereign state. Prior to the constitutional changes in 1919, the stringent civic republic was ruled by a class of hereditary grand burghers or Hanseaten.
Hamburg is a major transport hub and is one of the most affluent cities in Europe. It has become a media and industrial centre, with plants and facilities belonging to Airbus, Blohm + Voss and Aurubis. The radio and television broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk and publishers such as Gruner + Jahr and Spiegel-Verlag are pillars of the important media industry in Hamburg. Hamburg has been an important financial centre for centuries, and is the seat of the world's second oldest bank, Berenberg Bank. There are more than 120,000 enterprises.
The city is a major tourist destination for both domestic and overseas visitors; it ranked 17th in the world for livability in 2012,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mercer.com/qualityoflivingpr#city-rankings |title=2012 Quality of Living survey |publisher=Mercer.com |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013[/tpl] and in 2010 it ranked 10th in the world.

==Geography==

Hamburg is on the southern point of the Jutland Peninsula, between Continental Europe to the south and Scandinavia to the north, with the North Sea to the west and the Baltic Sea to the north-east. It is on the River Elbe at its confluence with the Alster and Bille. The city centre is around the Binnenalster ("Inner Alster") and Außenalster ("Outer Alster"), both formed by damming the River Alster to create lakes. The island of Neuwerk and two small neighbouring islands Scharhörn and Nigehörn, in the Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park, are also part of Hamburg.Hamburg Wadden Sea National Park Act [tpl]Citation |title=Gesetz über den Nationalpark Hamburgisches Wattenmeer |url=http://www.landesrecht.hamburg.de/jportal/portal/page/bshaprod.psml?doc.id=jlr-WattMGHArahmen&st=lr&showdoccase=1&paramfromHL=true#focuspoint|date=9 April 1990 |accessdate=26 February 2011[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl]

===Climate===

Hamburg has an oceanic climate (Cfb), influenced by its proximity to the coast and marine air masses that originate over the Atlantic Ocean. Nearby wetlands also enjoy a maritime temperate climate. Snowfall is rare, generally occurring once or twice a year.
The warmest months are June, July, and August, with high temperatures of [tpl]convert|19.9|to|22.2|C|F[/tpl]. The coldest are December, January, and February, with low temperatures of [tpl]convert|-1.4|to|0.0|C|F[/tpl].

==History==

===Origins===

Claudius Ptolemy (2nd century CE) reported the first name for the vicinity as Treva.
The name Hamburg comes from the first permanent building on the site, a castle which the Emperor Charlemagne ordered constructed in AD 808. It rose on rocky terrain in a marsh between the River Alster and the River Elbe as a defence against Slavic incursion, and acquired the name Hammaburg, burg meaning castle or fort. The origin of the Hamma term remains uncertain,[ref][tpl]Citation |last1=Verg |first1=Erich |last2=Verg|first2=Martin|year=2007 |title=Das Abenteuer das Hamburg heißt |edition=4th |location=Hamburg |publisher=Ellert&Richter |isbn=978-3-8319-0137-1 |page=8[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl]

===Medieval Hamburg===

In 834, Hamburg was designated as the seat of a bishopric. The first bishop, Ansgar, became known as the Apostle of the North. Two years later, Hamburg was united with Bremen as the bishopric of Hamburg-Bremen.Verg (2007), p.15 
Hamburg was destroyed and occupied several times. In 845, 600 Viking ships sailed up the River Elbe and destroyed Hamburg, at that time a town of around 500 inhabitants. In 1030, King Mieszko II Lambert of Poland burned down the city. Valdemar II of Denmark raided and occupied Hamburg in 1201 and in 1214. The Black Death killed at least 60% of the population in 1350.
Hamburg experienced several great fires, most notably in 1284 and 1842. 
In 1189, by imperial charter, Frederick I "Barbarossa" granted Hamburg the status of an Imperial Free City and tax-free access up[tpl]clarify|date=November 2013[/tpl] the Lower Elbe into the North Sea. In 1265, an allegedly forged letter was presented to or by the Rath of Hamburg.Verg (2007), p. 26 This charter, along with Hamburg's proximity to the main trade routes of the North Sea and Baltic Sea, quickly made it a major port in Northern Europe. Its trade alliance with Lübeck in 1241 marks the origin and core of the powerful Hanseatic League of trading cities. On 8 November 1266, a contract between Henry III and Hamburg's traders allowed them to establish a hanse in London. This was the first time in history that the word hanse was used for the trading guild of the Hanseatic League.[ref]Verg (2007), p. 30
[/ref]
In 1270, the solicitor of the senate of Hamburg, Jordan von Boitzenburg, wrote the first description of civil, criminal and procedural law for a city in Germany in the German language, the Ordeelbook (Ordeel: sentence). On 10 August 1410, civil unrest forced a compromise (German: Rezeß, literally meaning: withdrawal). This is considered the first constitution of Hamburg.Verg (2007), p. 39 In 1529, the city embraced Lutheranism, and it received Reformed refugees from the Netherlands and France and, in the 17th century, Sephardi Jews from Portugal.

===Modern times===

When Jan van Valckenborgh introduced a second layer to the fortifications to protect against the Thirty Years War in the seventeenth century, he extended Hamburg and created a "New Town" (Neustadt) whose street names still date from the grid system of roads he introduced.History of the area, accessed 3 November 2012
Upon the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Free Imperial City of Hamburg was not incorporated into a larger administrative area while retaining special privileges (mediatised), but became a sovereign state with the official title of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. Hamburg was briefly annexed by Napoleon I to the First French Empire (1810–1814). Russian forces under General Bennigsen finally freed the city in 1814. Hamburg re-assumed its pre-1811 status as a city-state in 1814. The Vienna Congress of 1815 confirmed Hamburg's independence and it became one of 39 sovereign states of the German Confederation (1815–1866).
In 1842, about a quarter of the inner city was destroyed in the "Great Fire." The fire started on the night of 4 May and was not extinguished until 8 May. It destroyed three churches, the town hall, and many other buildings, killing 51 people and leaving an estimated 20,000 homeless. Reconstruction took more than 40 years.
After periodic political unrest, particularly in 1848, Hamburg adopted in 1860 a democratic constitution that provided for the election of the Senate, the governing body of the city-state, by adult taxpaying males. Other innovations included the separation of powers, the separation of Church and State, freedom of the press, of assembly and association. Hamburg became a member of the North German Confederation (1866–1871) and of the German Empire (1871–1918), and maintained its self-ruling status during the Weimar Republic (1919–1933). The city experienced its fastest growth during the second half of the 19th century, when its population more than quadrupled to 800,000 as the growth of the city's Atlantic trade helped make it Europe's second-largest port. The Hamburg-America Line, with Albert Ballin as its director, became the world's largest transatlantic shipping company around the start of the 20th century. Shipping companies sailing to South America, Africa, India and East Asia were based in the city. Hamburg was the departure port for most Germans and Eastern Europeans to emigrate to the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Trading communities from all over the world established themselves there.
A major outbreak of cholera in 1892 was badly handled by the city government, which retained an unusual degree of independence for a German city. About 8,600 died in the largest German epidemic of the late 19th century, and the last major cholera epidemic in a major city of the Western world.

===Second World War===

In the Third Reich (1933–1945), Hamburg was a Gau from 1934 until 1945. During World War II, Hamburg suffered a series of Allied air raids which devastated much of the city and the harbour. On 23 July 1943, a firestorm developed as a result of Allied firebombing and, spreading from the Hauptbahnhof (central train station) and quickly moving south-east, completely destroyed entire boroughs, such as Hammerbrook, Billbrook or Hamm-south. These densely populated working-class boroughs underwent a dramatic demographic change as thousands of people perished in the flames. While some of the destroyed boroughs were rebuilt as residential areas after the war, others such as Hammerbrook are nowadays purely commercial areas with almost no residential population. The raids, codenamed Operation Gomorrah by the RAF, killed at least 42,600 civilians; the precise number is not known.
About 1 million civilians were evacuated in the aftermath of the raids.
The Hamburg Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery is in the greater Ohlsdorf Cemetery in the north of Hamburg.
At least 42,900 people are thought to have perished[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kz-gedenkstaette-neuengamme.de |title=Gedenkstätte Konzentrationslager Neuengamme |publisher=Kz-gedenkstaette-neuengamme.de |date= |accessdate=14 September 2013[/tpl] in the Neuengamme concentration camp (about [tpl]convert|25|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] outside the city in the marshlands), mostly due to epidemics and in the bombing of evacuation vessels by the Royal Air Force at the end of the war.

===Postwar history===

Hamburg surrendered without a fight to British Forces on 3 May 1945.[ref]
Ortwin Pelc, Kriegsende in Hamburg, Hamburg 2005[/ref] After World War II, Hamburg formed part of the British Zone of Occupation; it became a state of the then Federal Republic of Germany in 1949. From 1960 to 1962, the Beatles launched their career by playing in various music clubs in the city. On 16 February 1962, a North Sea flood caused the Elbe to rise to an all-time high, inundating one-fifth of Hamburg and killing more than 300 people.
The Inner German border — only [tpl]convert|50|km|mi|-1[/tpl] east of Hamburg — separated the city from most of its hinterland and reduced Hamburg's global trade. Since German reunification in 1990, and the accession of several Central European and Baltic States into the European Union in 2004, the Port of Hamburg has restarted ambitions for regaining its position as the region's largest deep-sea port for container shipping and its major commercial and trading centre.

==Demographics==

===Ancestry of Hamburg residents===

The ancestry of Hamburg residents as at 31 December 2010 is as follows:

===Religion===

In late 2009, 30% of the population belonged to the North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church, the largest religious body, and 10% to the Roman Catholic Church.http://www.ekd.de/download/Ber_Kirchenmitglieder_2009.pdf
According to one 2011 estimate based on ethnic origin, there are 200,000[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article108636429/Warum-Hamburger-Muslime-drei-Feiertage-erhalten.html |title=Staatsvertrag : Warum Hamburger Muslime drei Feiertage erhalten – Nachrichten Politik – Deutschland – DIE WELT |publisher=Welt.de |date=23 November 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2013[/tpl] Muslims of whom 50,000 are Alevis, although Alevis do not always identify themselves as Muslims.

==Government==

The city of Hamburg is one of 16 German states, therefore the Mayor of Hamburg's office corresponds more to the role of a minister-president than to the one of a city mayor. As a German state government, it is responsible for public education, correctional institutions and public safety; as a municipality, it is additionally responsible for libraries, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply and welfare services.
Since 1897, the seat of the government has been the Hamburg Rathaus, with the office of the mayor, the meeting room for the Senate and the floor for the Hamburg Parliament.[tpl]Citation |title=Kleiner Rathausführer |location=Hamburg |publisher=State Chancellery |year=2006[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl] From 2001 until 2010, the mayor of Hamburg was Ole von Beust,[tpl]Citation |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-02-24-Germany-elections_N.htm |title=German conservatives win most votes |accessdate=13 August 2008 |publisher=USA today |date=24 February 2008[/tpl] who governed in Germany's first state-wide "black-green" coalition, consisting of the conservative CDU and the alternative GAL, which are Hamburg's regional wing of the Alliance '90/The Greens party.[tpl]Citation |last=Kopp |first=Martin |title=Geheime Absprachen zwischen CDU und Grünen |year=2007 |location=Hamburg |publisher=Die Welt |url=http://www.welt.de/hamburg/arti2318261/Geheime_Absprachen_zwischen_CDU_und_Gruenen.html |date=12 August 2008|accessdate=13 August 2008 |postscript=.[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl] Von Beust was briefly succeeded by Christoph Ahlhaus in 2010, but the coalition broke apart on November, 28. 2010.Schwarz-Grün in Hamburg am Ende in Die Zeit – online, revisited on November, 28. 2010.

===Boroughs===

Hamburg is made up of seven boroughs (German: Bezirke) and subdivided into 104 quarters (German: Stadtteile). There are 181 localities (German: Ortsteile). The urban organization is regulated by the Constitution of Hamburg and several laws.[ref]Borough Administration Act 
 [tpl]de icon[/tpl][/ref] Most of the quarters were former independent cities, towns or villages annexed into Hamburg proper. The last large annexation was done through the Greater Hamburg Act of 1937, when the cities Altona, Harburg and Wandsbek were merged into the state of Hamburg.Greater Hamburg Act [tpl]Citation |title=Groß-Hamburg-Gesetz |url=http://www.verfassungen.de/de/hh/hamburg37.htm |date=26 January 1937 |accessdate=24 September 2008[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl] The Act of the Constitution and Administration of Hanseatic city of Hamburg established Hamburg as a state and a municipality.Reich Act of the Constitution and Administration of Hanseatic city of Hamburg [tpl]Citation |title=Reichsgesetz über die Verfassung und Verwaltung der Hansestadt Hamburg |url=http://www.verfassungen.de/de/hh/hamburg37-1.htm |date=9 December 1937 |accessdate=24 September 2008[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl] Some of the boroughs and quarters have been rearranged several times.
Each borough is governed by a Borough Council (German: Bezirksversammlung) and administered by a Municipal Administrator (German: Bezirksamtsleiter). The boroughs are not independent municipalities: their power is limited and subordinate to the Senate of Hamburg. The borough administrator is elected by the Borough Council and thereafter requires confirmation and appointment by Hamburg's Senate. The quarters have no governing bodies of their own.
In 2008, the boroughs were Altona, Bergedorf, Eimsbüttel, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord, Harburg and Wandsbek.Hamburg Act of Areal Organization [tpl]Citation |title=Gesetz über die räumliche Gliederung der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg (RäumGiG) |date=6 July 2006 |url=http://hh.juris.de/hh/gesamt/RGlG_HA.htm |accessdate=24 September 2008[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl]
Altona is the westernmost urban borough, on the right bank of the Elbe river. From 1640 to 1864, Altona was under the administration of the Danish monarchy. Altona was an independent city until 1937.

==Cityscape==

===Architecture===

Hamburg has architecturally significant buildings in a wide range of styles and only a few skyscrapers. Churches are important landmarks, such as St Nicholas', which for a short time in the 19th century was the world's tallest building. The skyline features the tall spires of the most important churches (Hauptkirchen) St Michael's (nicknamed “Michel"), St Peter's, St James's (St. Jacobi) and St. Catherine's covered with copper plates, and the Heinrich-Hertz-Turm, the radio and television tower (no longer publicly accessible).
The many streams, rivers and canals are crossed by over 2300 bridges, more than London, Amsterdam and Venice put together.[tpl]Citation |title=Hamburg – Grüne Metropole am Wasser |url=http://www.hamburg.de/umwelt/wasser/150782/stadt-am-wasser.html |date=1 July 2007 |author=Staff |publisher=Behörde für Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt |location=Hamburg |accessdate=24 September 2008[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2065153/Germany-city-breaks-Hamburg-heart-style--lot-bridges.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Sebastian | last=Lander | title=Hello Hamburg: Christmas markets, cuisine and cocktails in Germany's elegant port | date=23 November 2011[/tpl] Hamburg has more bridges inside its city limits than any other city in the world and more canals than Amsterdam and Venice combined.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.europeupclose.com/article/hamburg-germanys-window-to-the-world/#.T4dDRoHXhwQ |title=Hamburg: Germany’s Window to the World |publisher=EuropeUpClose.com |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=12 March 2013[/tpl] The Köhlbrandbrücke, Freihafen Elbbrücken, and Lombardsbrücke and Kennedybrücke dividing Binnenalster from Aussenalster are important roadways.

The many parks are distributed over the whole city, which makes Hamburg a very verdant city. The biggest parks are the Stadtpark, the Ohlsdorf Cemetery and Planten un Blomen. The Stadtpark, Hamburg's "Central Park", has a great lawn and a huge water tower, which houses one of Europe's biggest planetaria. The park and its buildings were designed by Fritz Schumacher in the 1910s.

===Parks and gardens===

The Alter Botanischer Garten Hamburg is a historic botanical garden, located in the Planten un Blomen park, which now consists primarily of greenhouses. The Botanischer Garten Hamburg is a modern botanical garden maintained by the University of Hamburg.

==Culture and contemporary life==

Hamburg has more than 40 theatres, 60 museums and 100 music venues and clubs. In 2005, more than 18 million people visited concerts, exhibitions, theatres, cinemas, museums, and cultural events. More than 8,552 taxable companies (average size 3.16 employees) were engaged in the culture sector, which includes music, performing arts and literature. There are five companies in the creative sector per thousand residents (Berlin three, London 37).[tpl]Citation |author=Institut für Kultur- und Medienmanagement |url=http://www.hamburg.de/servlet/contentblob/182046/kwb-hh-2006-neu/data.pdf |format=PDF|title=Kulturwirtschaftsbericht 2006 |date= August 2006|publisher=Behörde für Kultur, Sport und Medien |location=Hamburg |accessdate=13 August 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl]

Hamburg has several large museums and galleries showing classical and contemporary art, for example the Kunsthalle Hamburg with its contemporary art gallery (Galerie der Gegenwart), the Museum for Art and Industry (Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe) and the Deichtorhallen/House of Photography. The Internationales Maritimes Museum Hamburg opened in the HafenCity quarter in 2008. There are various specialised museums in Hamburg, such as the Archaeological Museum Hamburg (Archäologisches Museum Hamburg) in Hamburg-Harburg, the Museum of Labour (Museum der Arbeit), and several museums of local history, for example the Kiekeberg Open Air Museum (Freilichtmuseum am Kiekeberg). Two museum ships near Landungsbrücken bear witness to the freight ship (Cap San Diego) and cargo sailing ship era (Rickmer Rickmers).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.museen-in-hamburg.de/ |title=Museums in Hamburg |accessdate=29 December 2009[/tpl] The world's largest model railway museum Miniatur Wunderland with [tpl]convert|12|km|2|abbr=on[/tpl] total railway length is also situated near Landungsbrücken in a former warehouse.
BallinStadt Emigration City is dedicated to the millions of Europeans who emigrated to North and South America between 1850 and 1939. Visitors descending from those overseas emigrants may search for their ancestors at computer terminals.

===Music===

Hamburg State Opera is a leading opera company. Its orchestra is the Philharmoniker Hamburg. The city's other well-known orchestra is the North German Radio Symphony Orchestra. The main concert venue is the Laeiszhalle, Musikhalle Hamburg, pending completion of the new Elbe Philharmonic Hall. The Laeiszhalle also houses a third orchestra, the Hamburger Symphoniker. György Ligeti and Alfred Schnittke taught at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg.[tpl]Citation |title=Transcript of the John Tusa Interview with Gyorgy Ligeti |author=Staff |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/johntusainterview/ligeti_transcript.shtml |year=1999 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=24 September 2008[/tpl][tpl]Citation |title=Alfred Schnittke |author=Staff |url=http://www.boosey.com/pages/cr/composer/composer_main.asp?composerid=2731&ttype=BIOGRAPHY&ttitle=Biography/ |publisher=Boosey & Hawkes |accessdate=24 September 2008[/tpl]
Since the German premiere of Cats in 1985, there have always been musicals running, including The Phantom of the Opera, The Lion King, Dirty Dancing, and Dance of the Vampires. This density, the highest in Germany, is partly due to the major musical production company Stage Entertainment being based in the city.
Hamburg is the birthplace of Johannes Brahms, who spent his formative early years in the city, and the birthplace and home of the famous waltz composer Oscar Fetrás, who wrote the well-known "Mondnacht auf der Alster" waltz.
Prior to the group's initial recording and widespread fame, Hamburg provided residency and performing venues for The Beatles from 1960 to 1962. Hamburg has produced a number of pop musicians. Identical twins Bill Kaulitz and Tom Kaulitz from the rock band Tokio Hotel live and maintain a recording studio in Hamburg, where they recorded their second and third albums, Zimmer 483 and Humanoid. Singer Nena also lives in Hamburg. There are German hip hop acts, such as Fünf Sterne deluxe, Samy Deluxe, Beginner and Fettes Brot. There is a substantial alternative and punk scene, which gathers around the Rote Flora, a squatted former theatre located in the Sternschanze. Hamburg is famous for an original kind of German alternative music called Hamburger Schule ("Hamburg School"), a term used for bands like Tocotronic, Blumfeld, Tomte or Kante.
The city was a major centre for heavy metal music in the 1980s. Helloween, Gamma Ray, Running Wild and Grave Digger started in Hamburg.[tpl]Citation |title=allmusic (((Helloween> Biography ))) |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4471|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |first=Eduardo |last=Rivadavia |publisher=allmusic |accessdate=24 September 2008[/tpl] The industrial rock band KMFDM was also formed in Hamburg, initially as a performance art project. The influences of these and other bands from the area helped establish the subgenre of power metal.
Hamburg has a vibrant psychedelic trance community, with record labels such as Spirit Zone.[tpl]Citation |title=Spirit Zone Recordings |author=Staff |url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Spirit+Zone+Recordings |publisher=www.discogs.com |accessdate=24 September 2008[/tpl]

===Cuisine===

[tpl]Main|Cuisine of Hamburg[/tpl]
Original Hamburg dishes are Birnen, Bohnen und Speck (green beans cooked with pears and bacon),[tpl]Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/07/05/43504.html |title=Birnen, Bohnen, Speck – Schmeckt vorzüglich |date=5 July 2002 |accessdate=11 August 2008[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl] Aalsuppe (Hamburgisch Oolsupp) is often mistaken to be German for “eel soup“ (Aal/Ool translated ‘eel’), but the name probably comes from the Low Saxon allns [tpl]IPA|aˑlns[/tpl], meaning “all”, “everything and the kitchen sink”, not necessarily eel. Today eel is often included to meet the expectations of unsuspecting diners.[tpl]Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39651.html |title=Aalsuppe – Frage des Geschmacks |date=25 June 2002|accessdate=11 August 2008[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl] There is Bratkartoffeln (Low Saxon Brootkartüffeln, pan-fried potato slices), Finkenwerder Scholle (Low Saxon Finkwarder Scholl, pan-fried plaice), Pannfisch (pan-fried fish),[tpl]Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39713.html |title=Maischollen – Zart gebraten |date=25 June 2002 |accessdate=11 August 2008[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl] Rote Grütze (Low Saxon Rode Grütt, related to Danish rødgrød, a type of summer pudding made mostly from berries and usually served with cream, like Danish rødgrød med fløde)[tpl]Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendbla |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39656.html |title=Grütze – Mit kalter Milch |date=25 June 2002 |accessdate=11 August 2008[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl] and Labskaus (a mixture of corned beef, mashed potatoes and beetroot, a cousin of the Norwegian lapskaus and Liverpool's lobscouse, all offshoots off an old-time one-pot meal that used to be the main component of the common sailor's humdrum diet on the high seas).[tpl]Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/06/25/39664.html |title=Labskaus – Essen der Matrosen |date=25 June 2002 |accessdate=11 August 2008[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl]
Alsterwasser (in reference to the city's river, the Alster) is the local name for a type of shandy, a concoction of equal parts of beer and carbonated lemonade (Zitronenlimonade), the lemonade being added to the beer.[tpl]Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/08/01/52867.html |title=Alsterwasser – Bier und Limonade |date=10 August 2002 |accessdate=11 August 2008[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl]
There is the curious regional dessert pastry called Franzbrötchen. Looking rather like a flattened croissant, it is similar in preparation but includes a cinnamon and sugar filling, often with raisins or brown sugar streusel. The name may also reflect to the roll's croissant-like appearance – franz appears to be a shortening of französisch, meaning "French", which would make a Franzbrötchen a “French roll.”
Ordinary bread rolls tend to be oval-shaped and of the French bread variety. The local name is Schrippe (scored lengthways) for the oval kind and, for the round kind, Rundstück (“round piece” rather than mainstream German Brötchen, diminutive form of Brot “bread”),[tpl]Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt |url=http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/08/05/53895.html |title=Rundstück – Hamburger Brötchen |date=5 August 2002 |accessdate=6 June 2008[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl] a relative of Denmark's rundstykke. In fact, while by no means identical, the cuisines of Hamburg and Denmark, especially of Copenhagen, have a lot in common. This also includes a predilection for open-faced sandwiches of all sorts, especially topped with cold-smoked or pickled fish. The American hamburger seems to have developed from Hamburg's Frikadelle: a pan-fried patty (usually larger and thicker than its American counterpart) made from a mixture of ground beef, soaked stale bread, egg, chopped onion, salt and pepper, usually served with potatoes and vegetables like any other piece of meat, not usually on a bun. The Oxford Dictionary defined a Hamburger steak in 1802: a sometimes-smoked and -salted piece of meat, that, according to some sources, came from Hamburg to America.[tpl]Citation |last=Stradley |first=Linda |title=History of Hamburgers |url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/HamburgerHistory.htm |year=2004 |accessdate=23 August 2008[/tpl] There are different restaurants in all parts of the city, which offer most of these famous dishes, especially in the Hafencity, which started to be built in 2008 with 155ha and 13 quarters. This new district increases the city centre by about 40%, with new restaurants and apartments.[tpl]Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Restaurants in Hamburg |url=http://restaurant-in-hamburg.info/ |title=specialities and restaurants in Hamburg |date=11 February 2013 |accessdate=11 February 2013[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl]

===Language===

Like elsewhere in Germany, Standard German is spoken in Hamburg, but as typical for northern Germany, the original language of Hamburg is Low German, usually referred to as Hamborger Platt (German Hamburger Platt) or Hamborgsch. Since large-scale Germanization beginning in earnest within the 18th century, various Low German-colored dialects have developed (contact-varieties of German on Low Saxon substrates). Originally, there was a range of such Missingsch varieties, the best-known being the low-prestige ones of the working classes and the somewhat more bourgeois Hanseatendeutsch (Hanseatic German), although the term is used in appreciation.[tpl]Citation |contribution=Die deutsche Sprache—eine Dialektlandschaft |title=Nationalatlas Bundesrepublik Deutschland |last=Bausch |first=Karl-Heinz |contribution-url=http://www.ifl-nationalatlas.de/download/bsppdf/Band_6_bsp.pdf |year=2007 |accessdate=24 September 2008 |publisher=Leibniz-Institut für Länderkunde |location=Leipzig |isbn=3-8274-0947-0 |pages=94–95[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl] All of these are now moribund due to the influences of Standard German used by education and media. However, the former importance of Low German is indicated by several songs, such as the famous sea shanty Hamborger Veermaster, written in the 19th century when Low German was used more frequently. Many toponyms and street names reflect Low Saxon vocabulary, partially even in Low Saxon spelling, which is not standardised, and to some part in forms adapted to Standard German.Several places are named ...brook (Billbrook, Brooktor, Grasbrook, Hammerbrook, Hellbrook, Iserbrook) rather than Standard German ...bruch (neutr.; =brook riverscape), Bullenhusen rather than Bullenhausen, Lohbrügge rather than Lohbrücke, several localities starting with Nien... (Niendorf, Nienstedten) rather than Neuen..., or ending ...hude (Dockenhuden, Harvestehude, Winterhude) rather than ...hutung (fem.; =pasture), Uhlenhorst rather than Eulenhorst, several places and water bodies are named ...bek (Barmbek, Eilbek, Fischbek, Flottbek, Goldbek, Isebek, Kirchsteinbek, Langenbek, Osterbek, Pepermölenbek, Wandsbek) rather than ...bach, several places and water bodies are called ...fleet (Alsterfleet, Bleichenfleet, Moorfleet) rather than ...fließ (=brook, stream). Further toponyms with no close Standard German correspondents appear, such as ...büttel (=inhabited place; Eimsbüttel, Fuhlsbüttel, Hummelsbüttel, Poppenbüttel, Wellingsbüttel) or Twiete (=alley wedged between buildings). Like in other parts of Northern Germany ...stedt (Bergstedt, Billstedt, Duvenstedt, Eidelstedt, Lokstedt, Mellingstedt, Nienstedten, Ohlstedt, Rahlstedt) prevails over ...stadt (=town, originally simply stead).

===Tourism===

Tourists play a significant role in the city's economy. In 2007, Hamburg attracted more than 3,985,105 visitors with 7,402,423 overnight stays.[tpl]Citation |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburg Tourismus GmbH |url=http://www.hamburg-tourism.de/fileadmin/files/B2B/Zahlen_und_Fakten/Tourismusmonitor/Newsletter/Newsletter_Nr18.pdf |format=PDF|title=Newsletter Nr. 18 |date=29 February 2008 |accessdate=13 August 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl] The tourism sector employs more than 175,000 people full-time and brings in revenue of €9.3 billion, making the tourism industry a major economic force in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region. Hamburg has one of the fastest-growing tourism industries in Germany. From 2001 to 2007, the overnight stays in the city increased by 55.2% (Berlin +52.7%, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania +33%).[tpl]Citation |publisher=Behörde für Kultur, Sport und Medien |url=http://www.hamburg.de/daten-fakten/349180/aktuelles.html |title=Umsatzbringer und Jobmotor Tourismus |author=Staff |date=11 July 2008 |accessdate=13 August 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2013[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl]
A typical Hamburg visit includes a tour of the city hall and the grand church St. Michaelis (called the Michel), and visiting the old warehouse district (Speicherstadt) and the harbour promenade (Landungsbrücken). Sightseeing buses connect these points of interest. As Hamburg is one of the world's largest harbours many visitors take one of the harbour and/or canal boat tours (Große Hafenrundfahrt, Fleetfahrt) which start from the Landungsbrücken. Major destinations also include museums.
The area of Reeperbahn in the quarter St. Pauli is Europe's largest red light district and home of strip clubs, brothels, bars and nightclubs. The singer and actor Hans Albers is strongly associated with St. Pauli, and wrote the neighbourhood's unofficial anthem, "Auf der Reeperbahn Nachts um Halb Eins" ("On the Reeperbahn Half Past Midnight") in the 1940s. The Beatles had stints on the Reeperbahn early in their careers. Others prefer the laid-back neighbourhood Schanze with its street cafés, or a barbecue on one of the beaches along the river Elbe. Hamburg's famous zoo, the Tierpark Hagenbeck, was founded in 1907 by Carl Hagenbeck as the first zoo with moated, barless enclosures.[tpl]Cite news |publisher=National Audubon Society |work=Audubon Magazine |title=The New Zoo |url=http://audubonmagazine.org/features0111/newzoo.html |author=Rene S.

In 2005, the average visitor spent two nights in Hamburg.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] The majority of visitors come from Germany. Most foreigners are European, especially from the United Kingdom (171,000 overnight stays), Switzerland (about 143,000 overnight stays), Austria (about 137,000 overnight stays) and the Netherlands (about 80,000 overnight stays). The largest group from outside Europe comes from the United States (129,000 overnight stays).[tpl]Citation |title=Zahlen,Fakten,Trends 2007 |url=http://www.hamburg-tourism.de/fileadmin/files/B2B/Zahlen_und_Fakten/Studien_Publikationen/Zahlen-Fakten-Trends_2007.pdf |format=PDF |year=2008 |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburg Tourismus GmbH |accessdate=24 September 2008[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl]Ulrich Gaßdorf: Engländer wollen in den Hafen, Amerikaner in gute Restaurants.

===HafenCity===

The HafenCity is a new large urban development project in the Hamburg-Mitte district. It consists of the area of the Great Grasbrook, the northern part of the former Elbe island Grasbrook, and the warehouse district on the former Elbe island Kehrwieder and Wandrahm. It is bordered to the north, separated by the customs channel to Hamburg's city center, west and south by the Elbe and to the east, bounded by the upper harbor, Rothenburgsort. The district is full of rivers and streams and is surrounded by channels, and has a total area of about 2.2 square-kilometers.
HafenCity has 155 hectares in the area formerly belonging to the free port north of the Great Grasbrook. Until around the mid-2020s residential units for up to 12,000 people are planned to be built on the site, and jobs for up to 40,000 people, mainly in the office sector should be created. It is the largest ongoing urban development project in Hamburg.
Construction work started in 2003, and in 2009 the first part of the urband development project was finished with the completion of the Dalmannkai / Sandtorkai neighborhood – which is the first stage of the HafenCity project. According to the person responsible for the development and commercialization of HafenCity, HafenCity Hamburg GmbH, half of the master plan underlying structural construction is already completed, whereas the other half is either under construction or is in the construction preparation stages.

Hamburg's license plate prefix was "HH" (Hansestadt Hamburg; English: Hanseatic City of Hamburg) between 1906 and 1945 and from 1956, rather than the single letter normally used for large cities since the federal registration reform in 1956, such as B for Berlin or M for Munich. "H" was Hamburg's prefix in the years between 1945 and 1947 (used by Hanover since 1956);other prefixes used between 1945 and 1956 were "MGH" (Military Government, Hamburg: 1945 only), "HG" (1947 only) and "BH" (British Zone, Hamburg) between 1948 and 1956.

====Public transport====

Public transport by rail, bus and ships is organised by the Hamburger Verkehrsverbund ("Hamburg transit authority") (HVV).  Tickets sold by one company are valid on all other HVV companies' services. The HVV was the first organisation of this kind worldwide.[tpl]Citation |title=HVV – Mehr als ein Ziel – Historie |url=http://www.hvv.de/ueber-uns/historie/ |author=Staff |publisher=Hamburger Verkehrsverbund |accessdate=25 September 2008[/tpl] [tpl]de icon[/tpl]
Nine mass transit rail lines across the city are the backbone of public transport. The S-bahn (heavy railway system) comprises six lines and the U-bahn four lines – U-Bahn is short for Untergrundbahn (underground railway). Approximately [tpl]convert|41|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of [tpl]convert|101|km|mi|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of the U-bahn is underground; most is on embankments or viaduct or at ground level. Older residents still speak of the system as Hochbahn (elevated railway), also because the operating company of the subway is the Hamburger Hochbahn. The AKN railway connects satellite towns in Schleswig-Holstein to the city. On some routes regional trains of Germany's major railway company Deutsche Bahn AG and the regional metronom trains may be used with an HVV ticket. Except at the three bigger stations in the centre, Hauptbahnhof, Dammtor and Altona, regional trains do not  stop inside the city. The tram network was shut down in 1978.
Gaps in the rail network are filled by more than 600 bus routes, operated by single-deck two-, three- and four-axle diesel buses. Hamburg has no trams or trolley-buses, but has hydrogen-fueled buses operating pilot services. The buses run frequently during working hours, with buses on some routes as often as every 2 minutes. In suburban areas and on special weekday night lines the intervals can be 30 minutes or longer.
There are six ferry lines along the River Elbe, operated by HADAG, that fall under the aegis of the HVV. While mainly used by citizens and dock workers, they can also be used for sightseeing tours.
The international airport at Hamburg Fuhlsbüttel, official name "Hamburg Airport" (IATA: HAM, ICAO: EDDH) is the fifth biggest and oldest airport in Germany, having been established in 1912. It is about [tpl]convert|5|mi|0|abbr=off[/tpl] from the city centre. About 60 airlines provide service to 125 destination airports, including some long distance destinations like Newark, New Jersey on United Airlines, Dubai on Emirates, and Tehran on Iran Air. Lufthansa is the hub carrier, with the most flights, followed by Air Berlin. Lufthansa operates one of its biggest maintenance facilities at the Hamburg airport.
The second airport is Hamburg-Finkenwerder (IATA: XFW, ICAO: EDHI). It is about [tpl]convert|10|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] from the city centre and is a nonpublic airport for the Airbus plant. It is the second biggest Airbus plant, after Toulouse, and the third biggest aviation manufacturing plant after Seattle and Toulouse. The Finkenwerder plant houses the final assembly lines for A318, A319, A321 and A380 aircraft.[tpl]Citation |title=Airbus in Germany |url=http://www.airbus.com/company/worldwide-presence/airbus-in-germany/ |author=Staff |publisher=Airbus |accessdate=27 January 2012[/tpl]

==People from Hamburg==

[tpl]Quotation|In Hamburg it's hard to find a native Hamburger. A hurried and superficial search turns up only crayfish, people from Pinneberg, and those from Bergedorf. One accompanies the contented little kippers of a striving society; mackerels from Stade, sole from Finkenwerder, herrings from Cuxhaven swim in expectant throngs through the streets of my city and lobsters patrol the stock exchange with open claws.... The first so-called unguarded glance always lands on the bottom of the sea and falls into twilight of the aquarium. Heinrich Heine must have had the same experience when he tried, with his cultivated scorn and gifted melancholy, to find the people of Hamburg.|Siegfried Lenz||in Leute von Hamburg (People from Hamburg) ISBN 978-3-423-11538-4.[tpl]Citation |first=Jennifer |last=Jenkins |title=Provincial modernity: local culture and liberal politics in fin-de-siècle Hamburg |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-8014-4025-4[/tpl][/tpl]
