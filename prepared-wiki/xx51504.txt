==Brands==

Black & Decker (the corporation) is distinct from "Black & Decker" the brand; more than one corporation uses the brand. In particular, "Black & Decker" branded household products in the Americas (but outside of Brazil) are marketed by a division of Spectrum Brands, a consumer products corporation based in Madison, Wisconsin.  In December 2012, Spectrum Brands also purchased Black & Decker's hardware and home improvement division.http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=75225&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1767908

==Company timeline==

Black & Decker Corporation was founded in 1910 by S. Duncan Black and Alonzo G. Decker as a small machine shop in Baltimore. Decker, who had a seventh grade education, had met Black in 1906, when they were both 23 year-old workers at Rowland Telegraph Co. 
In 1917, Black & Decker invented the familiar portable electric drill, obtaining a patent for a hand-held drill combining a pistol grip and trigger switch.[tpl]US patent reference|number=1,245,860|m=11|d=06|y=1917|title=Electrically driven tool|inventor=S.
