Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease (HD), is a chronic infection caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081124141047.htm | title=New Leprosy Bacterium: Scientists Use Genetic Fingerprint To Nail 'Killing Organism'|work=ScienceDaily | date=2008-11-28 | accessdate=2010-01-31[/tpl] Initially infections are without symptoms and typically remain this way for 5 to as long as 20 years.[tpl]cite web|title=Leprosy Fact sheet N°101|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs101/en/|work=World Health Organization|date=Jan 2014[/tpl] Symptoms that develop include granulomas of the nerves, respiratory tract, skin, and eyes. This may result in a lack of ability to feel pain and thus loss of parts of extremities due to repeated injuries. Weakness and poor eyesight may also be present.
There are two main types of disease based on the number of bacteria present: paucibacillary and multibacillary. The two types are differentiated by the number of poorly pigmented numb skin patches present, with paucibacillary having five or fewer and multibacillary having more than five. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding acid-fast bacilli in a biopsy of the skin or via detecting the DNA by polymerase chain reaction. It occurs more commonly among those living in poverty and is believed to be transmitted by respiratory droplets. It is not very contagious.
Leprosy is curable with treatment. Treatment for paucibacillary leprosy is with the medications dapsone and rifampicin for 6 months. Treatment for multibacillary leprosy consists of rifampicin, dapsone, and clofazimine for 12 months. These treatments are provided for free by the World Health Organization. A number of other antibiotics may also be used. Globally in 2012 the number of cases of leprosy was 180,000, having decreased a great deal since the 1960s.[tpl]cite journal |author= |title=Global leprosy situation, 2012|journal=Wkly. Epidemiol.

In the past 20 years, 16 million people worldwide have been cured of leprosy.
Leprosy has affected humanity for thousands of years. The disease takes its name from the Latin word Lepra, which means "scaly", while the term "Hansen's disease" is named after the physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen.[tpl]cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=K|coauthors=Akama, T; Kawashima, A; Yoshihara, A; Yotsu, RR; Ishii, N|title=Current status of leprosy: epidemiology, basic science and clinical perspectives.|journal=The Journal of dermatology|date=February 2012|volume=39|issue=2|pages=121–9|pmid=21973237|doi=10.1111/j.1346-8138.2011.01370.x[/tpl] Separating people in leper colonies still occurs in countries like India, where there are more than a thousand;[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6510503.stm | author=Walsh F |title=The hidden suffering of India's lepers |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-03-31[/tpl] China, where there are hundreds;[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=117&art_id=qw1158139440409B243|title=Ignorance breeds leper colonies in China |author=Lyn TE |publisher=Independat News & Media |date=2006-09-13 |accessdate=2010-01-31[/tpl] and in the continent of Africa.[tpl]cite book|last=Byrne|first=Joseph P.|title=Encyclopedia of pestilence, pandemics, and plagues|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.u.a.|isbn=9780313341021|page=351|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=5Pvi-ksuKFIC&pg=PA351[/tpl] However, most colonies have closed. Leprosy has been associated with social stigma for much of history, which remains a barrier to self-reporting and early treatment.

==Signs and symptoms==

Leprosy is primarily a granulomatous disease of the peripheral nerves and mucosa of the upper respiratory tract; skin lesions are the primary external sign.[tpl]cite book | editor = Ryan KJ, Ray CG | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | pages = 451–3 | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 |isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 | author = Kenneth J. Ryan, C. George Ray, editors. | oclc = 52358530 61405904[/tpl] Left untreated, leprosy can be progressive, causing permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs and eyes. Contrary to folklore, leprosy does not cause body parts to fall off, although they can become numb or diseased as a result of secondary infections; these occur as a result of the body's defenses being compromised by the primary disease.[tpl]cite book |title = Textbook of Orthopedics and Trauma | edition = 2 | page = 779 | publisher = Jaypee Brothers Publishers | year = 2008 | isbn = 9788184482423 | author = Kulkarni GS[/tpl] Secondary infections, in turn, can result in tissue loss causing fingers and toes to become shortened and deformed, as cartilage is absorbed into the body.[tpl]cite journal |author= |title=Lifting the stigma of leprosy: a new vaccine offers hope against an ancient disease |journal=Time |volume=119 |issue=19 |page=87 |date=May 1982 |pmid=10255067 |doi= |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925377,00.html[/tpl]

==Cause==

===Mycobacterium leprae===

Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis are the causative agents of leprosy. M. lepromatosis is a relatively newly identified mycobacterium isolated from a fatal case of diffuse lepromatous leprosy in 2008.
An intracellular, acid-fast bacterium, M. leprae is aerobic and rod-shaped, and is surrounded by the waxy cell membrane coating characteristic of the Mycobacterium genus.[tpl]cite book | author = McMurray DN | title = Mycobacteria and Nocardia. in: Baron's Medical Microbiology (Baron S et al., eds.)| edition = 4th | publisher = Univ of Texas Medical Branch | year = 1996 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.1833 | isbn = 0-9631172-1-1 | oclc = 33838234 [/tpl]
Due to extensive loss of genes necessary for independent growth, M. leprae and M. lepromatosis are obligate pathogens, and unculturable in the laboratory, a factor that leads to difficulty in definitively identifying the organism under a strict interpretation of Koch's postulates.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bhattacharya S, Vijayalakshmi N, Parija SC |title=Uncultivable bacteria: Implications and recent trends towards identification |journal=Indian journal of medical microbiology |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=174–7 |date=1 October 2002|pmid=17657065 |url=http://www.ijmm.org/article.asp?issn=0255-0857;year=2002;volume=20;issue=4;spage=174;epage=177;aulast=Bhattacharya [/tpl] The use of non-culture-based techniques such as molecular genetics has allowed for alternative establishment of causation.
While the causative organisms have to date been impossible to culture in vitro, it has been possible to grow them in animals.
Naturally occurring infection also has been reported in non-human primates including the African chimpanzee, sooty mangabey, and cynomolgus macaque, as well as in
armadillos.

===Genetics===

Several genes have been associated with a susceptibility to leprosy. It is believed that around 95% of people are naturally immune.[tpl]cite web |title=Functional Haplotypes That Produce Normal Ficolin-2 Levels Protect against Clinical Leprosy|url=http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/199/6/801.full|publisher=Oxford Journals |accessdate=March 8, 2014[/tpl] Recent research suggests that there is a defect in cell-mediated immunity that causes susceptibility to leprosy. The region of DNA responsible for this variability is also involved in Parkinson's disease, giving rise to current speculation that the two disorders may be linked in some way at the biochemical level.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Buschman |first1=Ellen |last2=Skamene |first2=Emil |title=Linkage of leprosy susceptibility to Parkinson's disease genes |journal=International journal of leprosy and other mycobacterial diseases | volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=169–70 |date=Jun 2004 |issn=0148-916X |pmid=15301585 |doi= 10.1489/1544-581X(2004)0722.0.CO;2|url=http://www.leprosy-ila.org/leprosyjournal/pdf/72/i0148-916X-72-2.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=January 31, 2011[/tpl]

===Risk factors===

At highest risk are those living in areas with polluted water and poor diet or people suffering from diseases that compromise immune function.
There appears to be little interaction between HIV and the risk of leprosy.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lockwood|first=DN|coauthors=Lambert, SM|title=Human immunodeficiency virus and leprosy: an update.|journal=Dermatologic clinics|date=January 2011|volume=29|issue=1|pages=125–8|pmid=21095536|doi=10.1016/j.det.2010.08.016[/tpl]

===Transmission===

Although the mode of transmission of leprosy remains uncertain, many think that M. leprae is usually spread from person to person in nasal droplets. Studies have shown that leprosy can be transmitted to humans by armadillos.[tpl]cite web |title=Probable Zoonotic Leprosy in the Southern United States|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010536|publisher=The New England Journal of Medicine |accessdate=April 28, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/04/27/armadillos.spreading.leprosy/index.html?hpt=Sbin | work=CNN | title=Armadillos linked to leprosy in humans | date=2011-04-28[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last=Truman |first=Richard W. |title=Probable Zoonotic Leprosy in the Southern United States |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=364 |date=April 2011 |pages=1626–1633 |publisher=Massachusetts Medical Society |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010536 |accessdate=3 May 2011 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1010536 |last2=Singh |first2=Pushpendra |last3=Sharma |first3=Rahul |last4=Busso |first4=Philippe |last5=Rougemont |first5=Jacques |last6=Paniz-Mondolfi |first6=Alberto |last7=Kapopoulou |first7=Adamandia |last8=Brisse |first8=Sylvain |last9=Scollard |first9=David M. |issue=17 |pmid=21524213 |pmc=3138484[/tpl] Leprosy is not known to be either sexually transmitted or highly infectious after treatment. Approximately 95% of people are naturally immune and sufferers are no longer infectious after as little as two weeks of treatment.

==Pathophysiology==

The precise mechanism of transmission of leprosy is unknown; however, both prolonged close contact and transmission by nasal droplet are thought to be implicated.  In addition to humans, leprosy has been observed in the nine-banded armadillo, (which, it has recently been confirmed, is among the primary sources of new cases of leprosy in the population of North America),http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010536 and three species of non-human primates.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rojas-Espinosa O, Løvik M |title=Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepraemurium infections in domestic and wild animals |journal=Rev. - Off. Int. Epizoot. |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=219–51 |year=2001 |pmid=11288514 |doi=[/tpl] The bacterium can also be grown in the laboratory by injection into the footpads of mice.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hastings RC, Gillis TP, Krahenbuhl JL, Franzblau SG |title=Leprosy |journal=Clin. Microbiol. Rev. |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=330–48 |date=1988-07-01 |pmid=3058299 |pmc=358054 [/tpl] There is evidence that not all people who are infected with M. leprae develop leprosy, and genetic factors have long been thought to play a role, due to the observation of clustering of leprosy around certain families, and the failure to understand why certain individuals develop lepromatous leprosy while others develop other types of leprosy.[tpl]cite journal |author=Alcaïs A, Mira M, Casanova JL, Schurr E, Abel L |title=Genetic dissection of immunity in leprosy |journal=Curr. Opin. Immunol. |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=44–8 |year=2005 |pmid=15653309 |doi=10.1016/j.coi.2004.11.006[/tpl] It is estimated that due to genetic factors, only 5% of the population is susceptible to leprosy.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.kfsm.com/Global/story.asp?S=7845322| title=AR Dept of Health debunks leprosy fears| date=2008-02-08| accessdate=2008-04-08[/tpl] This is mostly because the body is naturally immune to the bacteria, and those persons that do become infected experience severe allergic reactions to the disease. However, the role of genetic factors is not entirely clear in determining this clinical expression. In addition, malnutrition and prolonged exposure to infected persons may play a role in development of the overt disease.
The most widely held belief is that the disease is transmitted by contact between infected persons and healthy persons.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kaur H, Van Brakel W |title=Dehabilitation of leprosy-affected people—a study on leprosy-affected beggars |journal=Leprosy review |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=346–55 |year=2002 |pmid=12549842 |doi=[/tpl] In general, closeness of contact is related to the dose of infection, which in turn is related to the occurrence of disease. Of the various situations that promote close contact, contact within the household is the only one that is easily identified, although the incidence among contacts and the relative risk for them appear to vary considerably in different studies. In incidence studies, infection rates for contacts of lepromatous leprosy have varied from 6.2 per 1000 per year in Cebu, Philippines[tpl]cite journal | author = Doull JA | title = The incidence of leprosy in Cordova and Talisay, Cebu, Philippines | journal = International Journal of Leprosy | year = 1942 | volume = 10 | pages = 107–131 | url= | author-separator =  | author2 =  Guinto RA | author3 =  Rodriguez RS | author4 = and others | displayauthors = 3 [/tpl] to 53 per 1000 per year in part of Western India to 55.8 per 1000 per year in a part of Southern India.[tpl]cite journal |author=Noordeen S, Neelan P |title=Extended studies on chemoprophylaxis against leprosy |journal=Indian J Med Res |volume=67 |issue= |pages=515–27 |year=1978 |pmid=355134[/tpl]
Two exit routes of M. leprae from the human body often described are the skin and the nasal mucosa, although their relative importance is not clear. Lepromatous cases show large numbers of organisms deep in the dermis, but whether they reach the skin surface in sufficient numbers is doubtful. Although there are reports of acid-fast bacilli being found in the desquamating epithelium (sloughing of superficial layer of skin) of the skin, Weddell et al. had reported in 1963 that they could not find any acid-fast bacilli in the epidermis, even after examining a very large number of specimens from patients and contacts.[tpl]cite journal |author=Weddell G, Palmer E |title=The pathogenesis of leprosy. An experimental approach |journal=Leprosy Review |volume=34 |issue= |pages=57–61 |year=1963 |pmid=13999438[/tpl] In a recent study, Job et al. found fairly large numbers of M. leprae in the superficial keratin layer of the skin of lepromatous leprosy patients, suggesting that the organism could exit along with the sebaceous secretions.[tpl]cite journal |author=Job C, Jayakumar J, Aschhoff M |title="Large numbers" of Mycobacterium leprae are discharged from the intact skin of lepromatous patients; a preliminary report |journal=Int J Lepr Other Mycobact Dis |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=164–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10472371[/tpl]
The importance of the nasal mucosa was recognized as early as 1898 by Schäffer, in particular that of the ulcerated mucosa.Arch Dermato Syphilis 1898; 44:159–174 The quantity of bacilli from nasal mucosal lesions in lepromatous leprosy was demonstrated by Shepard as large, with counts ranging from 10,000 to 10,000,000.[tpl]cite journal |author=Shepard C |title=Acid-fast bacilli in nasal excretions in leprosy, and results of inoculation of mice |journal=Am J Hyg |volume=71 |issue= |pages=147–57 |year=1960 |pmid=14445823[/tpl] Pedley reported that the majority of lepromatous patients showed leprosy bacilli in their nasal secretions as collected through blowing the nose.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pedley J |title=The nasal mucus in leprosy |journal=Lepr Rev |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=33–5 |year=1973 |pmid=4584261[/tpl] Davey and Rees indicated that nasal secretions from lepromatous patients could yield as much as 10 million viable organisms per day.[tpl]cite journal |author=Davey T, Rees R |title=The nasal discharge in leprosy: clinical and bacteriological aspects |journal=Lepr Rev |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=121–34 |year=1974 |pmid=4608620[/tpl]
The entry route of M. leprae into the human body is also not definitively known: The skin and the upper respiratory tract are most likely. While older research dealt with the skin route, recent research has increasingly favored the respiratory route. Rees and McDougall succeeded in the experimental transmission of leprosy through aerosols containing M. leprae in immune-suppressed mice, suggesting a similar possibility in humans.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rees R, McDougall A |title=Airborne infection with Mycobacterium leprae in mice |journal=J Med Microbiol |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=63–8 |year=1977 |pmid=320339 |doi=10.1099/00222615-10-1-63[/tpl] Successful results have also been reported on experiments with nude mice when M. leprae were introduced into the nasal cavity by topical application.[tpl]cite journal |author=Chehl S, Job C, Hastings R |title=Transmission of leprosy in nude mice |journal=Am J Trop Med Hyg |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=1161–6 |year=1985 |pmid=3914846[/tpl] In summary, entry through the respiratory route appears the most probable route, although other routes, particularly broken skin, cannot be ruled out.
In leprosy, both the reference points for measuring the incubation period and the times of infection and onset of disease are difficult to define, the former because of the lack of adequate immunological tools and the latter because of the disease's slow onset. Even so, several investigators have attempted to measure the incubation period for leprosy. The minimum incubation period reported is as short as a few weeks and this is based on the very occasional occurrence of leprosy among young infants.[tpl]cite journal |author=Montestruc E, Berdonneau R |title=2 New cases of leprosy in infants in Martinique |journal=Bull Soc Pathol Exot Filiales |volume=47 |issue=6 | language = French | pages=781–3 |year=1954 |pmid=14378912[/tpl] The maximum incubation period reported is as long as 30 years, or over, as observed among war veterans known to have been exposed for short periods in endemic areas but otherwise living in non-endemic areas. It is generally agreed that the average incubation period is between three and five years.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis in the U.S. is often delayed because healthcare providers are unaware of leprosy and its symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment prevents nerve involvement, the hallmark of leprosy, and the disability it causes.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration. (n.d.). National Hansen's disease (leprosy) program Retrieved from http://www.hrsa.gov/hansens/
There are many kinds of leprosy but there are common symptoms, including: runny nose; dry scalp; eye problems; skin lesions; muscle weakness; reddish skin; smooth shiny diffuse thickening of facial skin, ear, and hand; loss of sensation in fingers and toes; thickening of peripheral nerves; and flat nose due to destruction of nasal cartilage. There is also phonation and resonation of sound during speech. Often there is atrophy of the testes and impotency.

===Classification===

There are several different approaches for classifying leprosy; however, parallels exist.
There is a difference in immune response to the tuberculoid and lepromatous forms.[tpl]cite journal|author=Modlin RL |title=Th1-Th2 paradigm: insights from leprosy |journal=J. Invest. Dermatol. |volume=102 |issue=6|pages=828–32 |date=June 1994 |pmid=8006444 |doi= 10.1111/1523-1747.ep12381958|url=[/tpl]
Leprosy may also be divided into the following types:[tpl]cite book |author=James, William D. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location=|year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=|last2=Berger |first2=Timothy G. |author4=and others |displayauthors=3 [/tpl][tpl]Rp|344–346|date=November 2012[/tpl]
This disease may also occur with only neural involvement, without skin lesions.[tpl]cite journal |author=Jardim MR |title=Criteria for diagnosis of pure neural leprosy |journal=J. Neurol. |volume=250 |issue=7 |pages=806–9 |date=July 2003 |pmid=12883921|doi=10.1007/s00415-003-1081-5 |url=|author-separator= |author2= Antunes SL |author3= Santos AR |author4=and others |displayauthors=3 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Mendiratta V, Khan A, Jain A|title=Primary neuritic leprosy: a reappraisal at a tertiary care hospital |journal=Indian J Lepr |volume=78 |issue=3|pages=261–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17120509 |doi= |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Ishida Y, Pecorini L, Guglielmelli E |title=Three cases of pure neuritic (PN) leprosy at detection in which skin lesions became visible during their course |journal=Nihon Hansenbyo Gakkai Zasshi |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=101–6 |date=July 2000|pmid=10979277 |doi= 10.5025/hansen.69.101|url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Mishra B, Mukherjee A, Girdhar A, Husain S, Malaviya GN, Girdhar BK |title=Neuritic leprosy: further progression and significance|journal=Acta Leprol |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=187–94 |year=1995 |pmid=8711979 |doi= |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Talwar S, Jha PK, Tiwari VD |title=Neuritic leprosy: epidemiology and therapeutic responsiveness |journal=Lepr Rev |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=263–8 |date=September 1992 |pmid=1406021|doi= |url=[/tpl] This disease is also known as Hansen's disease.
The first symptom of leprosy which is most obvious is excess eye fluid.

==Prevention==

Medications can decrease the risk of those living with people with leprosy from acquiring the disease and likely those with whom people with leprosy come into contact outside the home.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rodrigues LC, Lockwood DNj |title=Leprosy now: epidemiology, progress, challenges, and research gaps |journal=Lancet Infect Dis |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=464–70 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21616456 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(11)70006-8 |url=[/tpl] There are however concerns of resistance, cost, and disclosure of a person's infection status when doing follow up of contacts, thus the WHO however recommends that people who live in the same household be examined for leprosy and only be treated if symptoms are present.
The Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine offers a variable amount of protection against leprosy in addition to tuberculosis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Duthie MS, Gillis TP, Reed SG |title=Advances and hurdles on the way toward a leprosy vaccine |journal=Hum Vaccin |volume=7 |issue=11 |pages=1172–83 |date=November 2011 |pmid=22048122 |pmc=3323495 |doi=10.4161/hv.7.11.16848 |url=[/tpl] It appears to be 26 to 41% effective (based on controlled trials) and about 60% effective based on observational studies with two doses possibly working better than one.[tpl]cite journal |author=Setia MS, Steinmaus C, Ho CS, Rutherford GW |title=The role of BCG in prevention of leprosy: a meta-analysis |journal=Lancet Infect Dis |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=162–70 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16500597 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70412-1 |url=[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1586/ERV.09.161[/tpl] Development of a more effective vaccine is ongoing as of 2011.

==Treatment==

A number of leprostatic agents are available for treatment. For paucibacillary (PB or tuberculoid) cases treatment with daily dapsone and monthly rifampicin for six months is recommended.[tpl]cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=K|coauthors=Akama, T; Kawashima, A; Yoshihara, A; Yotsu, RR; Ishii, N|title=Current status of leprosy: epidemiology, basic science and clinical perspectives.|journal=The Journal of dermatology|date=February 2012|volume=39|issue=2|pages=121–9|pmid=21973237|doi=10.1111/j.1346-8138.2011.01370.x[/tpl] While for multibacillary (MB or lepromatous) cases treatment with daily dapsone and clofazimine along with monthly rifampicin for twelve months is recommended.
MDT remains highly effective, and people are no longer infectious after the first monthly dose. It is safe and easy to use under field conditions due to its presentation in calendar blister packs. Relapse rates remain low, and there is no known resistance to the combined drugs.
