Country Soul contains recordings of a prestardom Glen Campbell, which were made around 1960-1961. This album, just like the other Starday album Country Music Star No. 1, was released after Glen Campbell rose to international fame with hits like Gentle on My Mind, By the Time I Get to Phoenix and Wichita Lineman. After a successful lawsuit by Campbell against these releases both albums were retracted.[tpl]cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=9 June 1969|title=Glen Campbell Sues Starday for $700,000 |trans_title= |journal=Los Angeles Times|volume= |issue= |pages=E22 |id= |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/595657792.html?dids=595657792:595657792&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Jun+09%2C+1969&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=GLEN+CAMPBELL+SUES+STARDAY+FOR+%24700%2C000&pqatl=google |accessdate=2009-09-19 |quote= [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author1= Nielsen Business Media, Inc |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=9 August 1969|title=Stay Campbell Suit Vs.
