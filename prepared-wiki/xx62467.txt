===Television and film career===

After his success in modeling, Kutcher moved to Los Angeles after his first audition,[tpl]cite web|title=Ashton Kutcher- Biography|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/person/ashton-kutcher/biography.html|work=Yahoo! Movies|accessdate=December 29, 2012[/tpl] was cast as Michael Kelso in the television series That '70s Show, from 1998 and to 2006.

(2000), Just Married (2003), and Guess Who (2005). He appeared in the 2003 family film, Cheaper By The Dozen, playing a self-obsessed actor. His 2004 film The Butterfly Effect was a dramatic role for Kutcher, playing a conflicted young man who time travels; the film received mixed to negative reviews, but was a box office success.[tpl]cite web|last=Frey |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061003/NEWS/610030305/1021/RSS06&source=RSS |title=Ashton Kutcher: More than meets the eye? |publisher=Theledger.com |date=October 3, 2006 |accessdate=August 18, 2013[/tpl]
In 2003, Kutcher produced and starred in his own series, MTV's Punk'd, as the host. The series involved hidden camera tricks performed on celebrities. He is also an executive producer of the reality television shows Beauty and the Geek, Adventures in Hollyhood (based around the rap group Three 6 Mafia), The Real Wedding Crashers, and the game show Opportunity Knocks. Many of his production credits, including Punk'd, come through Katalyst Films, a production company he runs with partner Jason Goldberg."Two New Producers, Lots of New Projects"  A 2004 interviewer described Kutcher as a "hunky young actor who is heading in all different directions at once", including "the hot L.A. restaurant Dolce":
 "If anything, I'm a trier," says Kutcher between puffs of filtered Lucky Strikes. "I think, more than anything, it comes from the fact that my father always had several irons in the fire. Also, I don't want to fail. If something doesn't work out—if That '70s Show got canceled or if I wasn't going to have a film career—I always wanted to have backup contingency plans. So I just started doing other things; and on a half-hour sitcom, you're really only working for 30 hours a week. It allows a lot of time for sitting around, which I always kind of filled with work."[tpl]cite news |last= Strauss |first=  Bob |title= Dramatic Ashton - Comedic Kutcher Gets Serious in The Butterfly Effect |work= Los Angeles Daily News |date= January 23, 2004 |url= |page= U6 |accessdate= May 7, 2013[/tpl]
