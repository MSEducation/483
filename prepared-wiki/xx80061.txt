The Quebec general election of 1956 was held on June 20, 1956 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec, Canada.

This was the fifth and final time (and the fourth in a row) that Duplessis led his party to a general election victory. No party has since been able to win more than three elections in a row.  Duplessis died in office in 1959.
It was Lapalme's second (and final) loss in a row as Liberal leader.  The Liberals did not manage to improve on their performance in the previous 1952 election.
