Her reports include Investment Funds in Canada and Consumer Protection, released in 1998, which called for greater transparency and disclosure to retail investors, but she is perhaps best known for her 1995 report [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.osc.gov.on.ca/About/Publications/op_stromberg.jsp|title=Regulatory Strategies for the Mid-90s -- Recommendations for Regulating Investment Funds in Canada. |first=Glorianne |last=Stromberg |publisher=Ontario Securities Commission |year=1995|accessdate=2008-08-18 [/tpl] on the lack of mutual fund regulation in Canada. The 1995 report triggered the creation of the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada, a self-regulatory organization.
Previously, the mutual fund industry had been mostly unregulated, although their peers in brokerages had long been regulated by the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (now being phased out and replaced by the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada)
