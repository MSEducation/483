Karl Hinds is a British rapper and producer within the British Hip Hop scene. He has pursued his musical interest since he was 15, Karl had and still remains with his sights set high and began his venture by setting up his own label, Assassin Records. Although intentions were to break through the Hip Hop scene Karl developed a craft in a style of Dance music called Jungle to accommodate the genre at date.
‘Roughneck Sister Sue’ the first official single released in 1993 which is credited under the name of R.A.W, was an underground success but proved to be a steep learning curve for Karl on how to structure the labels expenditure and profits. Following singles included ‘Cock Out & Ride’, ‘Feelin (Gal A Fuss)/Zero’ and by the time Karl had produced and released the fourth single the label had been established as a Drum & Bass record label, which led Karl into perfecting this brand and released 20 singles through Assassin Records all under different alliances.
Whilst building his empire and reclaiming successful hits within the Dance genres, Karl decided to broaden his music horizons with a sister label, Ill Flava Records, where he focused on Hip Hop.Kwaku (2001) "Karl Hinds "Relate to Me"", Billboard, 2 June 2001, p. 42, retrieved 2011-01-01 In 2000 the classic record ‘Don Gramma’ which earned Karl UKHH award nominations for Best Newcomer, Best Single 2001 and won the award for Best Video of that year.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl] Like many great producers Karl had created a unique sound that distinguishes him as an artist and producer, and he began to challenge the convention sound of UK Hip Hop.
