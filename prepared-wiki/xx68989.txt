Fahd bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, ([tpl]lang-ar|فهد بن عبد العزيز السعود[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|Fahd ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz Āl Sa‘ūd[/tpl]) (16 March 1921 – 1 August 2005) was the King of Saudi Arabia from 1982 to 2005.

==Early life and education==

Fahd's education took place at the Princes' School in Riyadh, a school established by Ibn Saud specifically for the education of members of the House of Saud.

==Early political positions==

Prince Fahd was made a member of the royal advisory board at his mother's urging.[tpl]cite news|title=The Political Leadership - King Fahd|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SAUDI+ARABIA+-+The+Political+Leadership+-+King+Fahd.-a057816188|accessdate=16 March 2013|work=APS Review Gas Market Trends|date=29 November 1999[/tpl] In 1945, Prince Fahd traveled on his first state visit to San Francisco for the signing of the UN charter.[tpl]cite web|title=Saudi Foreign Policy|url=http://www.saudiembassy.net/files/PDF/Publications/Magazine/2001-Fall/Working.htm|work=Saudi Embassy Magazine|accessdate=18 July 2013|date=Fall 2001[/tpl] On this trip he served under his brother, Prince Faisal, who was at the time Saudi Arabia's foreign minister. In 1953, Fahd led his first official state visit, attending the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II on behalf of the House of Saud.[tpl]cite journal|title=King Fahd - his first 20 years|url=http://www.saudiembassy.net/files/PDF/Publications/Magazine/2002-Winter/King%20Fahd.htm|publisher=Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia|accessdate=29 June 2012|location=Washington DC, US|date=Winter 2002|volume=18|issue=4|journal=Saudi Arabia[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=King Fahd 1923-2005:|url=http://www.saudiembassy.net/archive/2005/news/page365.aspx|publisher=Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia|accessdate=29 June 2012|location=Washington DC, US|date=1 August 2005[/tpl] On 24 December 1953, Prince Fahd was appointed education minister, being the first person holding this post in the country.[tpl]cite web|title=Educational system in Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.sacm.org/Publications/58285_Edu_complete.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Higher Education|accessdate=21 July 2013|year=2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Sicherman|first=Harvey|title=King Fahd's Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2005/0709/sich/sich_saudi.html|work=American Diplomacy|accessdate=8 August 2013|date=August 2005[/tpl]
Prince Fahd led the Saudi delegation to the League of Arab States in 1959, signifying his increasing prominence in the House of Saud—and that he was being groomed for a more significant role. In 1962, Fahd was given the important post of interior minister. As interior minister he headed the Saudi delegation at a meeting of Arab Head of States in Egypt in 1965. He was named second deputy prime minister in 1967, which was created for the first time by King Faisal.[tpl]cite book|author=Nadav Safran|title=Saudi Arabia: The Ceaseless Quest for Security|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zSkIi_1T1FsC&pg=PR17|accessdate=4 April 2013|year=1985|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-9484-0|pages=17[/tpl]

==Crown Prince==

After the death of King Faisal in 1975, Fahd was named first deputy prime minister and concurrently crown prince in 1975.[tpl]cite web|last=Henderson|first=Simon|title=After King Fahd|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PP_37_AFTERKINGFAHD.pdf|work=Washington Institute|accessdate=2 February 2013|format=Policy Paper|year=1994[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Anthony H.

By contrast, Prince Fahd had served as minister of education from 1954 to 1960 and minister of interior from 1962 to 1975.
Appointment of Prince Fahd as both crown prince and first deputy prime minister made him a much more powerful figure in contrast to the status of King Khaled when he had been crown prince during King Faisal's reign.[tpl]cite news|title=New Saudi king shuffles cabinet|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4m9kAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iH0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=2381,3734868&dq=prince+fahd+interior+minister&hl=en|accessdate=2 February 2013|newspaper=The Calgary Herald|date=29 March 1975|agency=AP|location=Riyadh[/tpl]

==Reign==

When King Khalid died on 13 June 1982, Fahd succeeded to the throne. He was the fifth king of Saudi Arabia.[tpl]cite news|last=De Borchgrave|first=Arnaud|title=Analysis: Arabian Medicis|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2006/12/27/Analysis-Arabian-Medicis/UPI-28221167225848/|accessdate=11 February 2013|newspaper=UPI|date=27 December 2006|location=Washington DC[/tpl] However, the most active period of his life was not his reign, but when he was Crown Prince.[tpl]cite news|title=King Fahd|url=http://www.economist.com/node/4246122|accessdate=8 August 2013|newspaper=The Economist|date=4 August 2013[/tpl] He adopted the title "Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques" in 1986, replacing "His Majesty", to signify an Islamic rather than secular authority.

===Foreign policy===

Fahd was a supporter of the United Nations. He supported foreign aid and gave 5.5% of Saudi Arabia's national income through various funds especially the Saudi Fund for Development and the OPEC Fund for International Development. He also gave aid to foreign groups such as the Bosnian Muslims in the Yugoslav Wars, as well as the Nicaraguan Contras, providing "a million dollars per month from May to December 1984".[tpl]cite web|title=Robert Busby: The Scandal that Almost Destroyed Ronald Reagan|url=http://hnn.us/node/136285|work=History News Network|accessdate=3 June 2012[/tpl] King Fahd was also a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause and an opponent of the State of Israel.[tpl]cite web|title= Palestine-Israel Issue – King Fahd Bin Abdulaziz|url=http://www.kingfahdbinabdulaziz.com/main/l500.htm|accessdate=1 January 2009[/tpl] Fahd was staunch ally of the United States, and once said "After Allah, we can count on the United States."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cia.gov|title=Welcome to the CIA Web Site|work=CIA|date=19 October 2012|accessdate=33 October 2012[/tpl]

In addition, he led the Arab world against the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. He developed a special bond with both Syrian President Hafez Assad and Egyptian President Hosni Mobarak during his reign.[tpl]cite journal|title=No news -- good news?|journal=Al Ahram Weekly|date=2–8 June 2005|issue=745|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/745/re8.htm|accessdate=26 August 2013[/tpl]

===Islamic activities===

Fearing that the 1979 Revolution in Iran could lead to similar Islamic upheaval in Saudi Arabia, Fahd spent considerable sums, after ascending the throne in 1982, to support Saddam Hussein's Iraq in its war with Iran.Obituary: King Fahd, BBC News,  1 August 2005. Retrieved 10 June 2008. He also changed his royal title to "Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques", and took steps to support the conservative Saudi religious establishment, including spending millions of dollars on religious education, further distancing himself from his inconvenient past.Wood, Paul. Life and legacy of King Fahd, BBC News, 1 August 2005. Retrieved 10 June 2008.

===Recreational activities===

At the same time as King Fahd presided over a more strict Islamic policy at home he was known to enjoy luxurious living abroad, even in ways that would not be allowed in his own kingdom. He visited the ports of the French Riviera, in his [tpl]convert|147|m|ft|sing=on[/tpl] yacht, the $100 million Abdul Aziz. The ship featured two swimming pools, a ballroom, a gym, a theatre, a portable garden, a hospital with an intensive-care unit and two operating rooms, and four American Stinger missiles.Simons, Geoff, Saudi Arabia, St. Martins, (1998), p.28 The king also had a personal $150 million Boeing 747 jet, equipped with his own fountain. In his visits to London he reportedly lost millions of dollars in the casinos and was even known to circumvent the curfew imposed by British gaming laws by hiring his own blackjack and roulette dealers to continue gambling through the night in his hotel suite.Marie Colvin, `The Squandering Sheikhs, Sunday Times, 29 August 1993

===Persian Gulf War, 1991===

In 1990, Iraqi forces under Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, placing the Iraqi army (then the largest in the Middle East) on the Saudi-Kuwaiti border. King Fahd agreed to host American-led coalition troops in his Kingdom, and later allowed American troops to be based there.[tpl]cite journal|last=Abir|first=Mordechai|title=The Succession of Saudi King Abdallah, the Oil Market, and Regional Politics|journal=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs|date=3 August 2005|volume=5|issue=2|url=http://www.jcpa.org/brief/brief005-2.htm|accessdate=1 February 2013[/tpl] This decision brought him considerable criticism and opposition from many Saudi citizens, who objected to the presence of foreign troops on Saudi soil; this was a casus belli against the Saudi royal family prominently cited by Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. His decision was also objected to by his full brothers or the Sudairi Seven.

===Reform and industrialization===

In regard to reform, King Fahd showed little tolerance for reformists. In 1992, a group of reformists and prominent Saudi intellectuals petitioned King Fahd for wide ranging reforms, including widening political representation, and curbing the royal family's wasteful spending. King Fahd first responded by ignoring their requests and when they persisted, reformists were harshly persecuted, imprisoned and fired from their jobs.
During King Fahd's rule, the royal family's lavish spending of the country's wealth reached its height. In addition, the biggest and most controversial military contract of the century, the Al-Yamamah arms deal was signed on his watch.[tpl]cite book|last=Taylor|first=Michael J.H.|title=Flight International World Aircraft and Systems Directory|url=http://www.amazon.com/Flight-International-Aircraft-Systems-Directory/dp/061701289X|accessdate=16 August 2007|edition=3rd Edition|year=2001|publisher=Reed Business Information|location=United Kingdom|isbn=0-617-01289-X|pages=189–190[/tpl] The contract has cost the Saudi treasury more than $90 billion. These funds were originally allocated to building hospitals, schools, universities and roads. As a result, Saudi Arabia endured a stagnation in infrastructure development from 1986 till 1999 when the new King, Abdullah, fully came into power.
Like all the countries bordering the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia under King Fahd has focused its industrial development on hydrocarbon installations. Up to this day, the country is reliant on imports for nearly all its light and heavy machinery.
King Fahd established a Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs directed by senior family members and technocrats in 1994. The council was planned to function as an ombudsman of Islamic activity concerning educational, economic and foreign policy matters. The chairman of the council was Prince Sultan. Prince Nayef, Prince Saud and a technocrat Mohammed Ali Aba al Khayl were appointed to the newly established council. One of the covert purposes of the council was thought to be to reduce the power of the Ulemas Council had been increasing its power.[tpl]cite news|last=Ibrahim|first=Youssef M.|title=Saudi King Trying to Dilute Islamic Radicalism|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/06/world/saudi-king-trying-to-dilute-islamic-radicalism.html?src=pm|accessdate=4 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 October 1994[/tpl]

===Succession mechanism===

In an effort to institutionalize succession King Fahd issued a decree on 1 March 1992.[tpl]cite journal|last=Wihbey|first=Paul Michael|title=Succession in Saudi Arabia: The not so Silent Struggle|journal=IASPS Research Papers in Strategy|date=July 1997|issue=4|url=http://www.iasps.org/strategic4/SA.htm[/tpl] The decree expanded the criteria for succession, which had been only seniority and family consensus, and led to speculations. The most significant change by the edict was that the King did acquire the right to appoint or dismiss his heir apparent based on suitability rather than seniority and that the grandsons of Abdulaziz became eligible for the throne.

===Rule after the 1995 stroke===

King Fahd was a heavy smoker, overweight for much of his adult life, and in his sixties began to suffer from arthritis and severe diabetes. He suffered a debilitating stroke on 29 November 1995 and became noticeably frail, and decided to delegate the running of the Kingdom to Crown Prince Abdullah on 2 January 1996.[tpl]cite news|title=King Fahd of Saudi Arabia dies|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4734175.stm|accessdate=2 February 2013|work=BBC|date=1 August 2005[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Saudi Crown Prince to Take over while King Rests|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/02/world/saudi-crown-prince-to-take-over-while-king-rests.html|accessdate=26 August 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 January 1996|author=Youssef M.

In November 2003, according to government media, King Fahd was quoted as saying to "strike with an iron fist" at terrorists after deadly bombings in Saudi Arabia, although he could hardly utter a word because of his debilitating stroke and deteriorating health. However, it was Crown Prince Abdullah who took official trips; when King Fahd traveled it was for vacations, and he was sometimes absent from Saudi Arabia for months at a time. When his oldest son and International Olympic Committee member Prince Faisal bin Fahd died in 1999, the King was in Spain and did not return for the funeral.Saudi Arabia's King Fahd Dies; Abdullah Named New Leader, New York Times, 1 August 2005. Retrieved 11 June 2008.
In a speech to an Islamic conference on 30 August 2003, King Fahd condemned terrorism and exhorted Muslim clerics to emphasize peace, security, cooperation, justice, and tolerance in their sermons.[tpl]cite web|last=Prados|first=Alfred B.|title=Saudi Arabia: Current Issues and|url=http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/IB93113_20030915.pdf|publisher=CRS Issue Brief for Congress|accessdate=22 April 2012|year=2003[/tpl]

===Funeral===

King Fahd was buried in the last thawb (traditional Arab robe) he wore. Fahd’s body was carried to Imam Turki bin Abdullah Mosque, and funeral prayers were held at around 3:30pm local time (12:30 GMT) on 2 August. The prayers for the late monarch were led by the Kingdom’s grand mufti, Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al Sheikh.
The "funeral prayer", during which worshipers remain standing, was performed after afternoon prayers. The ceremony was replicated in other mosques across the Kingdom, where the "prayers for the absentee" were held.
The body was carried by King Fahd's son, Abdul Aziz bin Fahd to the mosque and to the Al Oud cemetery some two kilometres away, a public cemetery where Fahd’s four predecessors and other members of the Al Saud ruling family are buried.[tpl]cite news|last=Shaheen|first=Abdul Nabi|title=Sultan will have simple burial at Al Oud cemetery|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/sultan-will-have-simple-burial-at-al-oud-cemetery-1.916706|accessdate=29 July 2012|newspaper=Gulf News|date=23 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Sturcke|first=James|title=Saudi king dies|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/01/saudiarabia.jamessturcke|accessdate=8 August 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 August 2005[/tpl]
Arab and Muslim dignitaries who attended the funeral were not present at the burial. Only ruling family members and Saudi citizens were on hand as the body was lowered into the grave.
Muslim leaders offered condolences at the mosque, while other foreign dignitaries and leaders who came after the funeral paid their respects at the royal court.
According to the regulations and social traditions, Saudi Arabia declared a national mourning period of three days during which all offices were closed. Government offices remained closed for the rest of the week. The state flag was not lowered (since the flag of Saudi Arabia bears the Shahada, the Islamic declaration of faith, the flag's protocol requires the flag not to be lowered)
After his death, many Arab countries declared mourning periods.[tpl]cite web|title=King Fahd Brought Vision of Progress|url=http://www.aramcoexpats.com/articles/2005/08/king-fahd-brought-vision-of-progress/|work=Aramco ExPats|location=Riyadh|date=5 August 2005[/tpl] Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Syria, Yemen, the Arab League in Cairo, and the Palestinian Authority all declared three-day mourning periods.
