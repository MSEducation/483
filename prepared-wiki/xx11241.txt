[[Shot reverse shot]]

CATEGORIES: Cinematography, Film editing, Film techniques, Television terminology

Shot reverse shot (or shot/countershot) is a film technique where one character is shown looking at another character (often off-screen), and then the other character is shown looking back at the first character. Since the characters are shown facing in opposite directions, the viewer assumes that they are looking at each other.[tpl]cite web|title=Editing guide|publisher=Yale University|author=Film Studies Program|year=2002|url=http://classes.yale.edu/film-analysis/htmfiles/editing.htm|accessdate=2010-03-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Film lexicon|publisher=MIT|author=Staff of "Hamlet on the Ramparts" Project|date=date unknown|url=http://shea.mit.edu/ramparts/commentaryguides/glossary/filmlexicon.htm#shotreverse|accessdate=2010-03-30[/tpl]

==Context==

Shot reverse shot is a feature of the "classical" Hollywood style of continuity editing, which deemphasizes transitions between shots such that the spectator perceives one continuous action that develops linearly, chronologically, and logically. It is an example of an eyeline match.
