==Football career==

Having arrived at AFC Ajax at age 18, Hosé appeared very rarely for the first team of the Eredivisie powerhouse during his five-year spell. His top division debut occurred on 15 November 1998, as he came on as a substitute for Benni McCarthy for the second half of an eventual 2–2 home draw against PSV Eindhoven.
Hosé also represented De Graafschap, HFC Haarlem, Sparta Rotterdam (all loans from the Amsterdam team), FC Dordrecht, Poseidon Nuon Perron (Greece), Al-Wakrah Sports Club (Qatar), Sarawak FA (Malaysian Super League) and VV Haaglandia, retiring from professional football in 2010 at the age of only 30.
