==Demographics==

==Education==

All tenth grade students follow the same curriculum, with approximately half of their 35 fifty-minute classes per week taught in English. Students attend seven classes per day, five days a week. Prior to entering the eleventh grade, students choose a course of study that reflects where they intend to pursue university studies.
Those students wishing to attend non-Japanese universities and who are deemed capable of embracing a rigorous academic program and workload enter the American College Preparation(ACP)program. This prepares students for undergraduate study in western universities, whilst also providing continued language support in ESL classes. In the senior year, students have the opportunity to take Advanced Placement(AP)courses in either Calculus or Studio Art. 
KLAS students who plan to return to Japan for undergraduate studies take the Japanese College Preparation(JCP)program. Nevertheless, up to half of their weekly classes are offered in English, reflecting the core mission of KLAS as a bilingual educational institution. JCP students prepare for study at a Japanese university but, with their ever-developing English skills, the possibility for further studies at a non-Japanese university remains very strong.
