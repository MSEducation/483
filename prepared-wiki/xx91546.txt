</ref> During production, the A40 Sports' aluminium bodies were built by Jensen and transported to Austin's [[Longbridge plant]] for final assembly.<ref name="austmem1">
</ref> The A40 Sports had been intended as more of a sporty touring car and not a sports car per se,<ref name="candriv"/> and over 4000 examples were manufactured from 1951–1953.
Austin-Healey 100: Although Jensen's design for a new Austin-based sports-car was rejected by the British Motor Corporation (BMC) in 1952 in favour of a design provided by Donald Healey, Jensen did win the BMC contract to build the bodies for the resultant Austin-Healey 100 from 1952 until 1956.
Volvo P1800: In 1960 Jensen won a contract from Volvo to assemble and finish the bodies for their P1800 coupé.  Pressed Steel manufactured the body-shells at their Linwood plant in Scotland and shipped them to Jensen in West Bromwich to be finished, painted and trimmed, before then being shipped to Sweden where Volvo completed the final build.
Sunbeam Tiger: In the early 1960s Jensen were also involved in the development and production of the Sunbeam Tiger.

==Changing ownership==

The company had come under the control of the Norcros Group in 1959[tpl]cite book |last=Robson |first=Graham |title=A to Z British cars 1945–1980 |year=2006 |publisher=Herridge |location=Devon, UK |isbn=0-9541063-9-3[/tpl] and following disagreements Alan and Richard Jensen resigned in 1966. The American car distributor Kjell Qvale became the majority shareholder in 1970 and brought in Donald Healey as chairman.
By 1975, the company's future was under threat, with the redundancy of 700 workers – two thirds of its workforce.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.expressandstar.com/days/1950-75/1975.html |title=Those were the days |publisher=Expressandstar.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-05[/tpl]
Jensen Motors ceased trading in May 1976. Two new companies: Jensen Special Products (JSP) and Jensen Parts & Service Limited (JP&S) were created to pick up the pieces of Jensen Motors.  JSP was created as a specialist engineering and design company from Jensen's development department. JP&S was created to provide parts and service to the existing Jensen customer base.  Both JSP and JP&S were bought by a holding company, Britcar Holdings. In 1982 JP&S, with the rights to use the Jensen brand names, was sold to Ian Orford who put the Interceptor back into production as the Mk IV.
Jensen Parts and Service was renamed Jensen Cars Ltd and 11 cars were made before the company was sold to Unicorn Holdings of Stockport and a Mk V Interceptor was proposed but never materialised although a few more Mk IVs were built.

==Revival hopes==

A revival in 2001 was short lived. By the end of 2002 production on their only model – the £40,000 S-V8 – had ceased.
After a £10 million investment, including Liverpool City Council and the Department of Trade and Industry, a two-seater convertible, the Jensen S-V8 was launched at the 1998 British International Motor Show, with an initial production run of 300 deposit paid vehicles planned at a selling price of £40,000 each, but by October 1999 it was confirmed that 110 orders had been placed.[tpl]cite web|title=Jensen roars back|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/472252.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=10 October 2012|date=12 October 1999[/tpl]
The new Liverpool factory in Speke commenced production in August 2001[tpl]cite web|title=New Jensen S-V8 enters production|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/4752501/New-Jensen-S-V8-enters-production.html|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=10 October 2012|date=25 August 2001[/tpl]  but troubles with manufacture meant production ceased with only 20 ever leaving the factory and another 18 cars left partially completed. The company went into administration in July 2002.
The Jensen name and partially completed cars were later sold to SV Automotive of Carterton, Oxfordshire, in 2003 who decided to complete the build of 12 of the cars, retaining the others for spare parts, and finally selling them for £38,070.[tpl]cite web|title=The tragic tale of the Jensen S-V8|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/carreviews/2722797/The-tragic-tale-of-the-Jensen-S-V8.html|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=10 October 2012|date=14 June 2003[/tpl]
In April 2010 Jensen International Automotive (JIA) was founded. This new company will buy old Jensen Interceptors, and sell them as new ones after a complete restoration, with new engine and interior trim.Charles Dunstone invests in Jensen Interceptor relaunch, BBC
In September 2011 CPP, a specialist sports car manufacturer announced they were planning to make a new Jensen, expected to go on sale to the public sometime in 2014.[tpl]cite news|last=Knapman|first=Chris|title=New Jensen Interceptor to be built in Britain|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/8776461/New-Jensen-Interceptor-to-be-built-in-Britain.html|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=20 September 2011[/tpl]  The new Interceptor will be based around an all-aluminium chassis and will feature alloy panels, "echoing the four-seat grand tourer layout of the much-loved original", according to the official press release.

==The Next Chapter==

In October 2013 Jensen Motors Limited was formed once again.  Based in north Oxfordshire under the ownership and direction of Steve Barby and Gregg Alvarez - formerly of Cropredy Bridge Cars Independent Jensen Specialists,  they offer servicing, cars sales and restoration.  The story continues.
