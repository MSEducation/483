A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square only once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed, otherwise it is open. The exact number of open tours on an 8x8 chessboard is still unknown.
The knight's tour problem is the mathematical problem of finding a knight's tour. Creating a program to find a knight's tour is a common problem given to computer science students.H. M. Deitel, P. J. Deitel. "Java How To Program Fifth Edition." Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, pp. 326–328. 2003. Variations of the knight's tour problem involve chessboards of different sizes than the usual 8 × 8, as well as irregular (non-rectangular) boards.

==Theory==

The knight's tour problem is an instance of the more general Hamiltonian path problem in graph theory. The problem of finding a closed knight's tour is similarly an instance of the Hamiltonian cycle problem. Note, however, that unlike the general Hamiltonian path problem, the knight's tour problem can be solved in linear time.[tpl]Cite journal |first=A. |last=Conrad |first2=T. |last2=Hindrichs |first3=H. |last3=Morsy |lastauthoramp=yes |first4=I. |last4=Wegener |title=Solution of the Knight's Hamiltonian Path Problem on Chessboards |journal=Discrete Applied Mathematics |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=125–134 |year=1994 |doi=10.1016/0166-218X(92)00170-Q [/tpl]

==History==

The earliest known reference to the Knight's Tour problem dates back to the 9th century AD.  In Rudraṭa's Kavyalankara (5.15), a Sanskrit work on Poetics, the pattern of a knight's tour on a half-board has been presented as an elaborate poetic figure ("citra-alaṅkāra") called the "turagapadabandha" or 'arrangement in the steps of a horse.' The same verse in four lines of eight syllables each can be read from left to right or by following the path of the knight on tour. Since the Indic writing systems used for Sanskrit are syllabic, each syllable can be thought of as representing a square on a chess board. Rudrata's example is as follows:
से ना ली ली ली ना ना ना ली
ली ना ना ना ना ली ली ली ली
न ली ना ली ली ले ना ली ना
ली ली ली ना ना ना ना ना ली
se nā lī lī lī nā nā lī
lī nā nā nā nā lī lī lī
na lī nā lī le nā lī nā
lī lī lī nā nā nā nā lī
For example, the first line can be read from left to right or by moving from the first square to second line, third syllable (2.3) and then to 1.5 to 2.7 to 4.8 to 3.6 to 4.4 to 3.2.
One of the first mathematicians to investigate the knight's tour was Leonhard Euler. The first procedure for completing the Knight's Tour was Warnsdorff's rule, first described in 1823 by H. C. von Warnsdorff.
In the 20th century, the Oulipo group of writers used it among many others. The most notable example is the [tpl]nowrap|10 × 10[/tpl] Knight's Tour which sets the order of the chapters in Georges Perec's novel Life: A User's Manual. The sixth game of the 2010 World Chess Championship between Viswanathan Anand and Veselin Topalov saw Anand making 13 consecutive knight moves (albeit using both knights) -– online commentors jested that Anand was trying to solve the Knight's Tour problem during the game.

==Existence==

Schwenk proved that for any [tpl]nowrap|m × n[/tpl] board with m ≤ n, a closed knight's tour is always possible unless one or more of these three conditions are met:
Cull et al. and Conrad et al. proved that on any rectangular board whose smaller dimension is at least 5, there is a (possibly open) knight's tour.

==Number of tours==

On an [tpl]nowrap|8 × 8[/tpl] board, there are exactly 26,534,728,821,064 directed closed tours (i.e. two tours along the same path that travel in opposite directions are counted separately, as are rotations and reflections).[ref]
 Remark: The authors later admitted that the announced number is incorrect. According to McKay's report, the correct number is 13,267,364,410,532 and this number is repeated in Wegener's 2000 book.[/ref][ref]
