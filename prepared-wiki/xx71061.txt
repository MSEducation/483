The Westin Peachtree Plaza, Atlanta is a skyscraper hotel on Peachtree Street in downtown Atlanta, Georgia adjacent to the Peachtree Center complex and the former Davison's/Macy's flagship store. At [tpl]convert|220.37|m|abbr=on[/tpl] and 73 stories and a [tpl]convert|57|m|abbr=on[/tpl] diameter, the tower is the second-tallest all-hotel skyscraper in the Western Hemisphere, and the 17th tallest all-hotel building in the world.[tpl]cite web | author= | title=Official World's 20 Tallest High-rise Buildings (Hotel use) | url=http://www.emporis.com/en/bu/sk/st/tp/ty/ho/ | work=Emporis | year=2011 | accessdate=17 November 2011[/tpl]

==History==

The first building on the site was the first official Georgia Governor's Mansion in Atlanta, a Victorian-style home purchased by the state in 1870 at the southwest corner of Peachtree Street and Cain Street (later International Boulevard, now Andrew Young International Boulevard).  After housing 17 governors of Georgia (each limited to a single term of office) until 1921, it was demolished in 1923 for the Henry Grady Hotel, named for Atlanta Constitution newspaper journalist/magnate and philanthropist Henry W. Grady.  That and the Roxy Theatre were in turn demolished for the current building.
Designed by developer/architect John Portman, the building gained landmark status within the city as Atlanta's tallest building from its completion, in 1976, to 1987 when it was overtaken by One Atlantic Center. The building opened as the tallest hotel in the world; in 1977, however, it was surpassed by its architectural twin, the central hotel tower of the Portman-designed Renaissance Center in Detroit. The Peachtree Plaza Hotel opened as the tallest building in the southeastern United States, surpassing One Shell Square in New Orleans. It lost that title in 1983, when the Southeast Financial Center in Miami surpassed it.  It was the tallest building in downtown Atlanta for 13 years until it was surpassed by 191 Peachtree Tower first, which in turn was surpassed by SunTrust Plaza (then One Peachtree Center).
The hotel was heavily featured in the 1981 film Sharky's Machine starring Burt Reynolds.  Stuntman Dar Robinson, doubling for Henry Silva at the end of the film, dropped [tpl]convert|220|ft|m[/tpl] from what appeared to be the Westin Peachtree Plaza, setting a record for the highest freefall (unrestrained) jump from a building in a film.  In actuality, however, the stunt scene was filmed at the nearby Hyatt Regency Hotel, using its shorter but similar cylindrically-shaped Radius Tower.

==Architectural details==

The building is cast in reflective glass in a cylindrical shape that reflects much of the downtown skyline (though each of the around 5600 windows are flat and not convex). Another small cylinder runs the full height of the building on one side, and accommodates two scenic elevators. The uppermost floors hold the Sun Dial Restaurant and Bar, a revolving restaurant that offers panoramic views of the city and its environs. The top floor of the restaurant completes a full revolution every 30 minutes, and the bottom every 60 minutes.

==Broadcasting==

Several local broadcasters have transmitted from an antenna mast atop the building, beginning when it became Atlanta's tallest, but declining since others have been built around it.
The original antenna once carried the signal of WUPA TV 69 from the time it first went on-air as WVEU, but that station moved because the Westin tower lacked space for an antenna to send the station's digital television signal.  Two LPTV stations currently transmit from the top: analog WTBS-LP 26, and digital-only WTHC-LD 42.1.FCC database for TV stations within 100m of this location [tpl]As of|2009[/tpl], WTBS-LP is moving to the Bank of America Plaza, from the same antenna as co-owned WANN-LP/WANN-CD, and possibly future digital WTBS-LD 30.
The main FM antenna (the four large elements seen at the top of the mast in both outdoor pictures on this page) recently belonged to WZGC FM 92.9 ("Dave FM"), while a smaller antenna still carries backup signals for that station and previously for WVEE FM 103.3 ("V-103"), both owned by CBS Radio.  WWWQ FM 100.5 ("Q100", now WNNX FM "Rock 100.5") first used the same antenna when it moved to Atlanta, before it upgraded and relocated within the city, but it has since switched back. WSTR FM 94.1 ("Star 94") also shared the main FM antenna with 92.9 when it was originally installed, with the power from both stations' transmitters being combined into a single antenna through a diplexer.  Both WSTR and WZGC still list this as their allotment location.FCC database for FM stations within 100m of this location
There is also an XM Satellite Radio repeater.

==2008 tornado==

On March 14, 2008, the Westin, along with other neighboring skyscrapers, sustained moderate damage when a tornado tore through downtown Atlanta, with over 500 windows broken.  It was the first tornado to have hit the downtown area.[tpl]cite news | author=Tim Eberly and Paul Shea | title=Tornado Kills 2, Pummels Downtown | url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/atlanta/stories/2008/03/14/domeburst_0315.html?cxntlid=homepage_tab_newstab | work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution | date=March 15, 2008 | accessdate=14 October 2010[/tpl]  The building reportedly swayed back and forth about two feet (more than half a meter) in either direction, as it was designed.[tpl]cite press release | title=Westin Fun Facts | url=http://www.sundialrestaurant.com/pr/Westin-Fun-Facts-Aug09.php | publisher=Sundial Restaurant | date=28 August 2009 | accessdate=14 October 2010[/tpl]
By 2009, the Westin was the only building to still have not replaced its broken windows, instead still being covered with black-painted plywood on the outside, and drywall on the inside. This is because the ¼-inch (6mm) uninsulated glass was no longer made by PPG Industries, and even identical new windows would look mismatched because of weathering due to three decades of hot sunshine.  Additionally, new building codes require insulated glass that can withstand winds up to [tpl]convert|90|mph|km/h|0[/tpl] instead of [tpl]convert|75|mph|km/h|-1[/tpl], necessitating heavier and more expensive glass.  Replacement of all 6,350 windows was expected to begin in June or July 2009 and continue from the top down until summer 2010 at a cost of over $20 million.[tpl]cite news | author=Bill Torpy  | title=Drywall used in Westin's storm-damaged windows | url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/atlanta/stories/2008/10/10/atlanta_tornado_window.html Most of downtown’s tornado-damaged windows patched up | work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution | date=10 October 2008 | accessdate=9 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news | author=Bill Torpy | title=Drywall used in Westin's storm-damaged windows | url=http://www.ajc.com/business/content/business/stories/2008/06/02/glass_0531.html | work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution | date=2 June 2008 | accessdate=9 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news | author=Alexis Stevens | title=Window pains: Glass on the way for Peachtree Plaza | url=http://www.ajc.com/living/content/metro/atlanta/stories/2009/04/23/windows_peachtree_plaza.html | work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution | date=April 23, 2009 | accessdate=9 April 2012[/tpl]  Like the original, the new windows are also mirrored, but feature a slight bronze tint.  Each pane measures [tpl]convert|52|x|110|in|cm|abbr=on[/tpl] and weighs [tpl]convert|270|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] with four panes required for each room.  More than 600 tons of glass will be recycled.[tpl]cite news | author=Douglas Sams | title=Storm-torn Westin to be reborn | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2009/08/31/story1.html | work=The Atlanta Business Chronicle | date=Monday, August 31, 200 | accessdate=9 April 2012[/tpl]
