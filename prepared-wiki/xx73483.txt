==Life and career==

Spencer Tunick was born in  Middletown, Orange County, New York into a Jewish family. His father Earl owned a keychain photo-viewer franchise in the Catskills.Naked Ambition: Spencer Tunick's Catskill Roots Run Deep. Gunkguide.com.  In 1986, he visited London, where he took photographs of a nude at a bus stop and of scores of nudes in Alleyn's School's Lower School Hall in Dulwich, Southwark. He earned a Bachelor of Arts from Emerson College in 1988.

==Photography==

In 1992, Tunick began documenting live nudes in public locations in New York through video and photographs. His early works from this period focus more on a single nude individual or small groups of nudes. Tunick cites 1994, when he posed and photographed 28 nude people in front of the United Nations building in midtown Manhattan, as a turning point in his career: "It all started there, moving my work from just photography into installation and performance photography," he says. Since then, he has organized and photographed over 65 temporary site-related installations in the United States and abroad.
Tunick's philosophy is that "individuals en masse, without their clothing, grouped together, metamorphose into a new shape. The bodies extend into and upon the landscape like a substance. These grouped masses which do not underscore sexuality become abstractions that challenge or reconfigure one's views of nudity and privacy."Spencer Tunick catalogue. Artnet.com (September 17, 2011). After gathering his subjects together, Tunick grades them by gender, long hair, age or other characteristics. Registration for modeling on his website includes questions about skin tone. A colour chart shows seven boxes ranging from stark white to baby-powder pink and dark chocolate. In his work, he plays off different flesh tones or groups people of the same colour.In the studio: Spencer Tunick. Telegraph.co.uk. Tunick is also interested in the juxtaposition between the organic and the mechanical, and often chooses famous buildings or unusual structures as his backdrop.

2007 
In 2007 Spencer Tunick was commissioned by the Dream Amsterdam Foundation to realize art projects for the artistic event Dream Amsterdam.Dream Amsterdam. BBC News. On April 15, 2007, Tunick organized an installation in a tulip field in Schermerhorn. On June 3, 2007, he photographed installations with 2000 participants in Amsterdam: 2000 people in a car park; 250 men at a nearby gas station; and 250 women on bicycles on the Lijnbaansgracht — Lauriergracht. A small group of participants was photographed on a canal, Leliegracht, requiring a special bridge construction to create the illusion that the people were floating over the water.
On May 6, 2007, approximately 18,000 people posed for Tunick in Mexico City's principal square, the Zócalo, setting a new record,[tpl]Cite news | title=Thousands strip for photo shoot | author=Tomas Sarmiento | publisher=Reuters | year=2007  | date= May 7, 2008 | url= http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN0626494920070507 | accessdate=September 19, 2010 | postscript=   [/tpl] and more than doubling the previous highest number of 7,000 people who had turned out in Barcelona in 2003. Male and female volunteers of different ages stood and saluted, lay down on the ground, crouched in the fetal position, and otherwise posed for Tunick's lens in the city's massive central plaza, the Plaza de la Constitución. Here, the specific problems of photographing great numbers of people outside became clear: as Tunick could only shoot from buildings located west of the square (the three other sides of the square are government buildings and the cathedral), there was a rush to take the pictures before dawn to avoid getting sunflare in the lens.  An accompanying documentary 'Naked in Mexico: Spencer Tunick' was also shot on, and around, the date of the photo shoot.
On August 18, 2007, Tunick used 600 nude people in a "living sculpture" on the Aletsch Glacier in an installation intended to draw attention to global warming and the shrinking of the world's glaciers in a collaboration with Greenpeace. The temperature was about 10 °C.[tpl]Cite news | title=Volunteers strip off to fight climate change | publisher=Swiss Info | date= August 18, 2007 | url= http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/front/detail/Volunteers_strip_down_to_fight_climate_change.html?siteSect=105&sid=8116840 | accessdate=September 19, 2010 | postscript=   [/tpl] The Aletsch glacier retreated by 100 m between 2005 and 2006. The environment-oriented installation was reported in several languages and media outlets around the world, Swiss politicians were playfully encouraged to demonstrate their green credentials by participating in Tunick's installation, and Euro RSCG Zurich, Switzerland received the AME Grand Trophy for Public Service and Not-For-Profit, for their campaign for Tunick and Greenpeace Switzerland, "Naked Testimony to Global Warming".[ref]

Another photoshoot was organised for four days later (Saturday June 21) in Dublin, on the South Wall near the Poolbeg Lighthouse, with over 2500 nude people taking part. The South Wall event was somewhat washed out, with one of the proposed set-ups having to be cancelled. However, people praised the organisers for an event well run.

==Media reception==

Tunick is the subject of three HBO documentaries, Naked States,Naked States Naked World,Naked World. and Positively Naked.Positively Naked. Positively Naked.
It has been observed that there may be an ambiguity in Tunick's work between "transgression" and "obedience". A "regimented" quality has been observed in the arrangement of figures in some of Tunick's work, but this it has been observed, may be offset by the social transgression that accrues to public nakedness.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/art/2008/01/naked_ambition.single.html|title=Naked Ambition: Why doesn't Spencer Tunick get any respect?|author=Fineman, Mia|publisher=Slate Magazine|date=2008-01-16|accessdate=01/04/13[/tpl]
