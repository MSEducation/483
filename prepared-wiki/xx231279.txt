Priscilla Bowman (May 30, 1928 â€“ July 24, 1988) was an American jazz and rhythm and blues singer, who had a #1 hit single on the US Billboard R&B chart in 1955 as the lead singer with Jay McShann's band with the song, "Hands Off".
She was born in Kansas City, and has been called the city's "original rock 'n' roll mama."Vee-Jay: The Early Years  She joined the Jay McShann band in the early 1950s.  In 1955 the band signed to Vee-Jay Records, and Bowman recorded two sessions with them.  One of the songs, "Hands Off", became a hit, staying at number 1 on the R&B chart for three weeks in December 1955.  The single was notable as the last single to hit number one on the R&B charts without making the Billboard Hot 100.[tpl]cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=392[/tpl]
