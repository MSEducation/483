==Biography==

Renny Harlin was born in Riihimäki, Finland to a nurse and a physician.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/83/Renny-Harlin.html|title=Renny Harlin Biography (1959-)|publisher=Film Reference[/tpl]
The Adventures of Ford Fairlane and Die Hard 2 were edited simultaneously and released a week apart in 1990. The former flopped, but the latter was a commercial success. Harlin achieved critical acclaim the following year when he produced Rambling Rose through his own Midnight Sun Pictures for director Martha Coolidge. The film won Best Feature at the 1992 Independent Spirit Awards and earned its star and Harlin's then-partner Laura Dern a Best Actress Oscar nomination at the 1992 Academy Awards.
Harlin's next project after Driven was to be a movie adaptation of the Ray Bradbury short story A Sound of Thunder, but Harlin left the project after a disagreement with Bradbury.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/harlin-fired-from-thunder_article_31514.html|title=Harlin Fired From THUNDER?|first=Frank|last=Kurtz[/tpl] Although the director was changed, Harlin was credited as a producer when the finished film was released in 2005.
Harlin took over directing the action mystery film Mindhunters when the original director Peter Howitt dropped out, but the release was delayed by studio conflicts. Harlin went on to re-shoot a more traditional horror version of Exorcist: The Beginning when the studio was unhappy with the psychological drama cut by director Paul Schrader.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/98/2798.php|title=Nothing left of Paul Schrader's EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING|accessdate=22 July 2007|author=Variety|publisher=MovieWeb.com[/tpl] Due to the delays with Mindhunters, both films ended up being released in 2004 and both were moderate successes.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
In 2006, Harlin collaborated with Markus Selin to direct a biopic of the Finnish President and Marshall of Finland Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, but budget constraints put the project on hold.  Instead, Harlin made another foray into low-budget horror with The Covenant, which was another moderate commercial success. In 2007 the Mannerheim film project resumed temporarily and Harlin returned to Finland. Production began in 2008 with Mikko Nousiainen starring as Mannerheim. However, 30% of the funding was cut by one of the financiers due to the global economic recession, and the delay meant that the time window for shooting the winter scenes during the spring of 2009 passed. Pre-production finally commenced in 2010, and the project was assigned to Dome Karukoski in August 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Dome+Karukoski+will+produce+Mannerheim+film+with+a+smaller+budget+than+Renny+Harlin/1135269745581|title=Dome Karukoski will produce Mannerheim film with a smaller budget than Renny Harlin[/tpl]
