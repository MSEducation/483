==Medalists==

==Archery==

A single male archer secured qualification by winning the individual competition at the Final World Qualification Tournament, in Boé, France.

==Athletics==

As in previous editions, the Portuguese Olympic team's biggest share of competitors will compete in athletics events. Twenty-seven athletes (13 men and 14 women) will perform in a wide range of track and field disciplines, including the long-distance events, where Portugal holds its best record, but also the more technical events, where national athletes have achieved international-level results in the build-up to the Beijing Games.
Notable male athletes include the 2004 Olympic 100 metres silver medalist, Francis Obikwelu, and the 2007 triple jump world champion, Nelson Évora. Susana Feitor—bronze in the 20 km walk at the 2005 World Championships—and Naide Gomes—2008 world and 2007 European indoor long jump champion—are featured among the women's contingent.

==Badminton==

Marco Vasconcelos qualified for his third consecutive Olympic Games in virtue of a 64th place in the Badminton World Federation (BWF) men's ranking list, which allowed him to be the 32nd qualified player in a total of 41 individual players. For the first time, women's national badminton will be represented at the Olympics, thanks to the 59th place of Ana Moura in the BWF women's ranking, which converted her in the 31st qualified player from a total of 47 individual players.

==Canoeing==

Having reached the K-1 1000 metres final and the K-1 500 metres semifinal in his first Olympic appearance, in 2004, Emanuel Silva will be participating in the same two events, in Beijing.
Portugal will be represented in the women's kayak events for the first time, with Teresa Portela and the pair Beatriz Gomes and Helena Rodrigues in the 500 metres distance. All competitors were granted qualification by allocation of spare athlete quota places.

===Sprint===

Qualification Legend: QS = Qualify to semi-final; QF = Qualify directly to final

==Cycling==

A maximum of three places were allocated to Portugal in the men's road event, due to a tenth place in the 2006-2007 UCI Europe Tour nations ranking, which corresponded to a second place in terms of continental Olympic qualification. A quota place was available for the men's time trial event, but it was not taken.
The national cycling federation chose to send 2004 Olympic silver medalist Sérgio Paulinho together with André Cardoso and Nuno Ribeiro. However, just five days before the road race event, it was announced that Paulinho would not compete in Beijing due to asthma problems, and that he would not be replaced by another rider.[tpl]cite news |url=http://noticias.sapo.pt/lusa/artigo/f3ba0c9be28a1df40a4e32.html |title=Sérgio Paulinho vai falhar Jogos devido a problemas de saúde |publisher=Agência Lusa |date=2008-08-04 |accessdate=2008-08-04 |language=Portuguese[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

===Road===

==Equestrian==

Three horse riders qualified for the individual dressage competition—hence for the team competition, as well—, by benefiting from Switzerland's decision of not competing in the dressage events, but also from allocation of unused quota places. Daniel Pinto returns to the Olympic Games after his debut in Sydney 2000, while his brother Carlos Pinto will make his first Olympic appearance.

===Dressage===

==Fencing==

For the second time, since Rome 1960, Portugal qualified a female fencer for the individual foil competition. Débora Nogueira secured her place in Beijing by coming second in the European qualification tournament, held in Lisbon. She is joined by Joaquim Videira, a silver medalist in the men's individual épée at the 2006 World Fencing Championships, who qualified in virtue of his third place in the FIE individual adjusted official ranking (AOR).

==Gymnastics==

Portugal had qualified two places in trampoline gymnastics.

===Trampoline===

==Judo==

In the wake of Nuno Delgado's bronze medal in 2000 (the first Olympic judo medal), the national judo scene developed considerably and new stars emerged, achieving international results of credit. Among notable judokas competing in Beijing are 2008 under-81 kg European champion, João Neto, and two-time under-52 kg European champion and 2007 World Judo Championships runner-up, Telma Monteiro.

==Rowing==

A national crew achieved qualification for the men's lightweight double sculls event, by reaching second place in the Final Olympic Qualification Regatta, held in Poznan.

==Swimming==

Portuguese swimmers have achieved qualifying standards in the swimming events (up to a maximum of two swimmers per event with the Olympic Qualifying Time (OQT), and potentially one with the Olympic Selection Time (OST)). Additionally, Portugal had qualified one male and one female swimmer to the inaugural open-water marathon.

==Table tennis==

For the first time in Olympic history, Portugal had qualified in table tennis. A maximum of three players participated in the men's singles: João Monteiro, qualified via Continental Qualification Tournament, Marcos Freitas and Tiago Apolónia, qualified due to allocation of unused team quota places.

==Taekwondo==

Taekwondo was the second Olympic sport where Portuguese competitors entered for the first time, in Beijing. The feat was achieved by Pedro Póvoa, following his victory in the European Qualification Tournament, held in Istanbul.

==Triathlon==

The nation's second consecutive presence in the Olympic triathlon competition will be expanded to both events, with the qualification of two male triathletes. They will join Vanessa Fernandes, eight place in Athens, who is aiming to grab the Olympic gold medal, following a world title, in 2007, and a fifth consecutive European title, in 2008.
