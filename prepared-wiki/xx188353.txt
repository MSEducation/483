The Gilbert Arizona Temple is a temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), in the town of Gilbert, Arizona.  The announcement of the temple on April 26, 2008 came concurrently with the Gila Valley Arizona Temple and were the first new temples announced after Thomas S. Monson assumed responsibilities as LDS Church president.[tpl]cite news |first= Mike |last= Branom |title= New Mormon temple slated for Gilbert |url= http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/114955 |publisher= East Valley Tribune |date= 2008-04-27 |accessdate= 2008-04-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080429141617/http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/114955|archivedate = 2008-04-29[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://www.azcentral.com/community/gilbert/articles/2009/08/06/20090806gr-temple0807.html#reply18070445 |title= Gilbert begins process for approving new LDS temple |date= 2009-08-06 |accessdate= 2009-08-06 |first= Katherine |last= Green |newspaper= The Arizona Republic[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/09/03/20090903gr-temple0904.html |title= Panel paves way for new Mormon temple in Gilbert |date= 2009-09-03 |accessdate= 2009-09-30 |last= Green |first= Katherine |newspaper= The Arizona Republic[/tpl]
The temple is near the intersection of Pecos and Greenfield roads in a rapidly growing part of the southeast Phoenix metropolitan area. The temple was built in response to the high concentration of church members in the area and will help ease the load on the nearby Mesa Arizona Temple.[tpl]citation |title= LDS Church announces two new temples in Arizona. |url= http://www.sltrib.com/lds/ci_9071215?source=rss |newspaper= The Salt Lake Tribune |date= 2008-04-27 |accessdate= 2012-11-02 [/tpl] 
The Gilbert town council gave unanimous approval to requested zoning changes in a meeting on September 29, 2009.  Key among the requests was an allowance to build to a height of 85 feet, higher than the existing restriction at 45 feet.  The temple's planned [tpl]convert|180|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall[/tpl] steeple did not require an exemption, as the town does not restrict the height of steeples.  While not providing a specific timeframe for construction, an anticipated completion within three years was repeated at the meeting.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.azcentral.com/community/gilbert/articles/2009/09/30/20090930gr-temple1002.html#reply18448642 |title= Gilbert Council OKs Mormon temple zoning changes |date= 2009-09-30 |accessdate= 2009-09-30 |first= Alia |last= Beard Rau |newspaper= The Arizona Republic [/tpl]
