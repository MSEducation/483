[[Everingham Executive]]

CATEGORIES: Northern Territory ministries

The Everingham Executive was the fifth ministry to come from the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. It was also the last to have been officially referred to as an executive rather than a ministry, and the last to have the rather limited powers that came with holding office in the Northern Territory before the granting of full self-government in 1978.
It came into existence after the bizarre events of the 1977 election; while the Country Liberal Party government was easily re-elected, five of its seven executive members, including its leader, Dr Goff Letts, lost their seats. This required significant changes to their executive, including the election of Paul Everingham as party leader, the promotion to higher-profile positions of the two other surviving members, Marshall Perron and Ian Tuxworth, and the promotion of two other members, Jim Robertson and Roger Steele to the executive. The executive then governed the Territory under new Majority Leader Everingham from September 1977 until the granting of self-government in June 1978.
