==HUAC Testimony==

O'Connell was openly a long-time progressive socialist and communist fellow traveler. In 1955, he appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee. The Committee questioned him widely, including Henry Wallace's bid for President in 1948.  The Committee gained no new evidence, which lessened its reputation. After the hearings, O'Connell had a heart attack and died.[ref]
