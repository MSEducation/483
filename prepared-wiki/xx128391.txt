Jean-Paul Saari is a writer, songwriter, producer, engineer, musician, and sometime painter.  Saari was born in suburban Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1967, the son of the Mechanical Engineer Robert Saari and Jean Saari, and the brother of Howard and (the writer) Laura Saari. The ancestry is from the far north of Finland, and the actual family name is not "Saari."

==Life==

The family moved to Southern California in the early 1980s. Somewhat alienated by the culture he found in Southern California, he found a home in California's early Punk rock movement, and developed his talent for writing his own songs. He was and is the creator of several bands, beginning with young combos such as the Coroners on through his creation and authorship of the San Francisco trio Fox-Glove Bell in 1995 (dissolved in 2003). 
In 1992, he was the musical director of the Los Angeles and Orange County Gridiron Show. The last half of the 1980s saw him studying poetry at the University of California, Berkeley, under the tutelage of the likes of Peter Dale Scott and Sandra Cisneros. His history in the United States Library of Congress dates back to 1989, and his catalog of music includes over 50 pieces of music. Saari is registered with Broadcast Music Incorporated as a songwriter and publisher. 
Saari broke away from the work with Fox-Glove Bell in 2003 to create the unusual melodic sonic disturbance "aa," which saw its eponymous release produced at Berkeley's Fantasy Studios in 2004.
He is currently working on a multitude of creative projects, and divides his time between Japan, California, and the American Midwest.
