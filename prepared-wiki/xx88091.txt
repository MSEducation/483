Speak English or Die is the debut studio album by the crossover thrash band Stormtroopers of Death (S.O.D.), released in December 1985. After Anthrax finished recording Spreading the Disease, there was still some studio time left, so members Scott Ian and Charlie Benante called some friends, practiced some songs, and recorded it all within a week. 
The album was re-released by Megaforce in August 1995 and a platinum edition of the album was released in February 2000. Speak English or Die has sold over 1 million copies worldwide.http://www.megaforcerecords.com/store/product.php?productid=16155 The album had some controversy due to the politically incorrect lyrics. Dan Lilker stated, "The lyrics were never intended to be serious, just to piss people off."
