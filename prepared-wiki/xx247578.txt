The UK Singles Chart is a music chart compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling singles of the week in the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/ |title=The Official UK Charts Company |publisher=Official Charts Company |accessdate=2 January 2010[/tpl] Since 2004 the chart has been based on the sales of both physical singles and digital downloads, with airplay figures excluded from the official chart.
This is a list of singles that peaked in the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart during 2010 (see 2010 in British music). The date is when the song entered the top 10 for the first time. Songs that were still in the top 10 at the beginning of 2010 but peaked in 2009 are listed in List of top 10 singles in 2009 (UK). Songs that entered the top 10 in 2010 but did not peak until 2011 will be listed in List of top 10 singles in 2011 (UK). An asterisk (*) in the "Weeks in Top 10" column shows that the song is in the top 10 as of 26 December 2010 and therefore the number of weeks could change. For the current top 10, see 2010 in British music.
