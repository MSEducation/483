===Why is John Lennon Wearing A Skirt?===

This play follows the story of a 14 year-old girl who wears trousers and would rather play football than share the sudden awakening interests of her friends. Claire Dowie says of her piece: "It's about growing up in the late 60s and early 70s. It's my time, but not necessarily my story. It was the beginning of the feminist movement – bra burning, etc., they just started. Mental one was torn between 'Man from UNCLE' and 'Batman': All the girls had as a role model was Barbie." The quote is a newspaper article by Terry Grimley (2004) found  The play was enacted at many German theatres.
Premiere: Traverse Theatre Edinburgh 1990

===Adult Child/Dead Child===

Written in 1987
Adult Child/Dead Child is the story of a young person growing up with their parent's impossibly high standards – "One hundred percent do it right, do it the best, be brainy, be talented, be sporty, be good, academic athlete, well-mannered, polite, know it all, do it all, one hundred percent do it right, do it the best", harsh punishments, overshadowment from their sister, people they cannot stand and their imaginary friend, who they name "Benji", after a much loved dog living on the same street. Benji is considered a friend at first until a cruel comment from neighbours results in Benji prompting the child to throw a brick through the neighbours' window. It is at this point that the child declares Benji a "monster, and a horror and a terror." Throughout childhood, Benji is kept a secret, even throughout therapy sessions for fear of ending up in "The Snake Pit". Eventually, in the second half of the monologue, the child leaves home and is forced to face a world which expects them to behave in an adult manner, despite their feelings that they are still a child and thus need the support of one. Eventually, due to Benji causing trouble, the child is sectioned and begins to shake off Benji and their fears and begins to live on their own in the "adult" manner which so confused them before, although at the end it is left ambiguous as to whether the character has made a full recovery.
Premiere: Finborough Theatre Club, London 1987
