Cardinal Newman High School, also commonly referred to as Cardinal Newman or simply Newman, is a private Catholic coeducational secondary school located in West Palm Beach Florida, USA.  It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Palm Beach.  Founded in September 1961, and named for the Cardinal John Henry Newman, it is one of two private Catholic high schools in Palm Beach County, Florida. In 2005, Cardinal Newman was the first Catholic high school in Florida, and one of only a dozen in America, to offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.

==History==

Cardinal Newman High School traces its roots to St. Ann's Catholic School of St. Ann's Parish, located in downtown West Palm Beach. St. Ann's School opened its doors in 1925 to serve parishes in central Palm Beach County. This school would serve the educational needs of Catholic high school students until the early 1960s. This changed when Archbishop Coleman F. Carroll announced construction of a new high school in West Palm Beach.
In September 1961, a small number of Adrian Dominicans moved from St. Ann's School to the new  single building Cardinal Newman High School. "A second classroom building was added within five years, and Archbishop Carroll dedicated a new cafeteria and gymnasium in 1973."[tpl]Cite web | title = A Brief History of Cardinal Newman High School | url = http://www.cardinalnewman.com/history.jsp | accessdate = 2010-04-23[/tpl]
Later years saw a number of additions and modernizations, including the John P. Raich Athletic Building in 1985, Crusader Stadium in 1993, and the addition and updating of the lacrosse and softball fields in 2003. In 2006, a track and field facility was added, and the gymnasium was renovated. In 2010, the cafeteria underwent an extensive renovation, and the gym was further updated in the 2012-2013 school year. The school added a dance studio in 2012.
