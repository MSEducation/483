The India national rugby union team represents India in rugby union. India is currently Division 3 champion of Asian 5 Nations.
The Indian national rugby union team was admitted to the IRB in 2001, but it took three years before India managed to win a match, beating Pakistan 56-3 in the third tier competition of the Asian Biennial tournament.
In 2005, they started their attempt to qualify for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, but a 22-36 loss to Kazakhstan sent them out of the running for that tournament. They also disappointed with an 8-8 tie in Guam, but still finished second in their group of four teams thanks to beating Malaysia 48-12. However, as only the top team in the group qualified for the next stage, India were out. Their current record in IRB-recognised internationals is ten wins, one tie, and twenty four losses.

==History==

Rugby Union in India dates back to a scratch match or two played in Kolkata and Madras during the visit of MS Galatea in 1871. The first recorded match was played on Christmas Day 1872, at CFC in Kolkata, it was played between England and a combined team of Scotland, Ireland and Wales.
The national team was not started till 1998 however when the India national team played Singapore in Singapore, they lost 85-0. The team were then admitted into the International Rugby Board in 2001 and then in 2003 the team undertook its first UK tour. This consisted of playing three sides from the Midlands which all resulted in large defeats, including a staggering 153-0 defeat from a Leicester Tigers XV at Welford Road. They also failed to score a single try during their visit. Despite the sheer lack of success, the head did have some positive words, stating: "It's all a learning process for us. The difference in size and body weight between the two teams was huge, but when we get back to Asia we'll be playing against teams roughly our own size." In 2007 India attempted to qualify for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, Scotland, and Wales. They were placed in Asian Division 3, Pool B for the qualifiers in which India finished second of four teams with 1 win, 1 tie, and 1 loss. As only the first place team moved on to the second qualification round India was officially knocked out of the 2007 World Cup.
In 2008 the India Rugby Union Team attempted to qualify for the Rugby World Cup again. This time though qualification was different as instead of the group stage India had to play in the 2008 Asian Five Nations and win it in order to move on to Round 2 in qualification. India though lost their first match against Thailand and had to settle for 3rd place after a 2rd[tpl]Clarify|date=July 2013|reason=Should this be '2nd' or '3rd'?[/tpl] place match win against Pakistan in which India achieved their biggest ever victory as they beat Pakistan 92–0.
