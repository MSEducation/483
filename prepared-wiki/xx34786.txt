==Geography==

Ulverston is a comparatively large civil parish. It is bounded in the east by the Leven estuary, Crake, Coniston Water, and Yewdale Beck. To the west the boundary follows a chain of hills, and beyond that lie the towns of Kirkby-in-Furness and Askam and Ireleth. To the south is relatively low land, but it rises quickly. In the north are hills such as Coniston Old Man. The settlements of the parish are mainly concentrated in the eastern part.[tpl]cite book|author=Eilert Ekwall|publisher=Manchester University Press|title=The Place-Names of Lancashire|year=1922|accessdate=2008-09-19[/tpl]

===Earthquake===

On 28 April 2009, Ulverston was near the epicentre of an earthquake measuring 3.7 on the Richter scale. Tremors were felt across south Cumbria and parts of north Lancashire at 11.22 BST, although virtually no damage was caused by them. A spokesman for the British Geological Survey said that earthquakes of around that magnitude occur roughly once a year in Britain.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/8022583.stm|title=Tremor strikes north-west England|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-04-28|accessdate=2009-04-28[/tpl] It was the largest seismic event in the region since a magnitude 4.4 earthquake struck Lancaster in 1835.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/barrow/biggest_earthquake_for_174_years_1_547801?referrerPath=home|title=Biggest earthquake in 174 years hits South Cumbria|publisher=North-West Evening Mail|date=2009-04-30|accessdate=2009-04-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Earthquake-In-Ulverston-Cumbria-According-To-British-Geological-Survey/Article/200904415270843?f=rss|title=Earthquake Shakes Buildings In Cumbria|publisher=Sky News|date=2009-04-28|accessdate=2009-04-30[/tpl]

==History==

The name Ulverston, first recorded in the Domesday Book (1086) as Ulurestun, is derived from two elements: the first is either the Old Norse personal name Úlfarr, or the Old English Wulfhere; the second element is the Old English tūn, meaning "farmstead" or "village".[tpl]cite book|author=A.D. Mills|year=2003|title=Dictionary of British Place Names|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=475[/tpl] The personal names Úlfarr and Wulfhere both translate roughly as "wolf warrior" or "wolf army",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/ONMensNames.shtml#u|title=Viking Answer Lady Webpage - Old Norse Men's Names|author=Viking Answer Lady|accessdate=2007-11-04[/tpl] which explains the presence of a wolf on the town's coat of arms. The loss of the 'W' in Wulfhere can be attributed to the historic Scandinavian influence in the region. Locally, the town has traditionally been known as Oostan.Rollinson, W. (1997), The Cumbrian Dictionary of Dialect, Tradition and Folklore, Smith Settle Ltd, p115 Other variations of the name recorded throughout history include Oluestonam (1127), and Uluereston (1189).
The town's market charter was granted in 1280 by Edward I.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitcumbria.com/sl/ulverst.htm|title=Ulverston, Cumbria|publisher=Visit Cumbria|accessdate=2010-07-09[/tpl] This was for a market every Thursday; modern Ulverston keeps its old market town appearance, and market days are now held on both Thursdays and Saturdays.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.southlakeland.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=350|title=Ulverston Street Markets|publisher=South Lakeland District Council|accessdate=2008-09-21[/tpl] The charter also allowed for all public houses to open from 10:30 am until 11:00 pm irrespective of any other statute on the books. During the summer months the Saturday market day is themed with craft stalls, charity stalls and locally produced wares on "Made in Cumbria" stalls.
Historically, the ancient parish included several other chapelries or townships which later became separate civil parishes: Blawith, Church Coniston, Egton with Newland, Lowick, Mansriggs, Osmotherley, Subberthwaite and Torver. From 1894 to 1974 the town constituted an urban district in the administrative county of Lancashire. It became a successor parish in the Cumbria district of South Lakeland under the Local Government Act 1972.[tpl]cite book|author=Frederic A. Youngs|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|title=Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Volume 2[/tpl]
Over the years the town has been the birthplace of several famous people. Sir John Barrow, born at Dragley Beck, Ulverston, was the Admiralty's Second Secretary: a much more important position than First Secretary. A monument to him—a replica of the third Eddystone Lighthouse—stands on Hoad Hill overlooking the town. Famous Ulverstonians include Norman Birkett,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Norman-Birkett-Life-Ulverston-Crime/dp/0140113452|title=Norman Birkett: The Life of Lord Birkett of Ulverston|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=2008-09-21[/tpl] who represented Britain at the Nuremberg Trials; Maude Green, the mother of Rock and Roll music legend, Bill Haley;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/haley.html|title=Bill Haley and his Comets|publisher=Classic Bands|accessdate=2006-01-18[/tpl] Norman Gifford,[tpl]cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/13365.html|title=Norman Gifford|publisher=cricinfo.com|accessdate=2008-02-01[/tpl] an England test cricketer; Francis Arthur Jefferson, a soldier awarded with the Victoria Cross;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lancs-fusiliers.co.uk/feature/jefferson/Frankjeffersonvc.htm|title=Feature Page of Francis Arthur Jefferson VC|publisher=Lancashire Fusiliers|accessdate=2008-02-01[/tpl] and comedian Stan Laurel,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0491048/|title=Stan Laurel|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2008-02-01[/tpl] of Laurel and Hardy fame.

One of Ulverston's lesser known sons is the late Bryan Martin, senior BBC Radio 4 newsreader and presenter of the 70s and 80s, who announced on the "Today" programme the death of Elvis Presley in 1977 and broke the news of the Iranian Embassy siege in 1980. He appeared in The News Quiz, occasionally introduced The Goon Show, and read the spoof "news bulletin" which always featured in the middle of the comedy The Men From the Ministry.
