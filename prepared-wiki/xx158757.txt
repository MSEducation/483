[[Acremonium strictum]]

CATEGORIES: Hypocreales, Fungal plant pathogens and diseases

Acremonium strictum is a pathogenic fungus of plants, fungi, humans, and other animals. 
The genus Acremonium contains around 100 species, most of which are saprophytic, being isolated from dead plant material and soil. Some species cause diseases in humans and animals such as mycetoma, onychomycosis, and hyalohyphomycosis. 
A. strictum is a parasite of other fungi, including Helminthosporium solani, which causes disease in potato crops.Rivera-Varas, V. V., et al. (2007). Mycoparasitism of Helminthosporium solani by Acremonium strictum. Phytopathology 97(10) 1331-37. It can occasionally become a human pathogen, especially in immunocompromised or otherwise weakened individuals.Yalaz, M., et al. (2003). Fatal disseminated Acremonium strictum infection in a preterm newborn: a very rare cause of neonatal septicaemia. Journal of Medical Microbiology 52(9) 835-37.
