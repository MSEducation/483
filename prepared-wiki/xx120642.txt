[[Area code 662]]

CATEGORIES: Area codes in the United States, Area codes in Mississippi

Area code 662 is the telephone area code serving northern Mississippi, including five counties (Tunica, Tate, Desoto, Marshall, and Benton) that are part of the Memphis metro area. In 1999 the area code was split off from the original 601 area code, which had until 1997 covered the entire state. The split came in part because the Memphis LATA extends some distance into northern Mississippi, meaning a large block of numbers in Memphis' area code 901 are not available for use.
