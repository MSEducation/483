The Pageant, sometimes called The Pageant Concert NightClub, is a music venue in the Delmar Loop district. It sits on the western edge of Saint Louis, Missouri, just east of the University City part of the Loop.
The Pageant is St. Louis' premier midsize venue, with ample space for the audience and stage room and lighting options for performers. It hosts touring national acts in pop, indie rock, hip-hop, jazz, blues, and more.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/locations/the-pageant-18005/ |title=The Pageant - St. Louis Music Venues - St. Louis - Skinker/DeBaliviere |publisher=Riverfront Times |date= |accessdate=2009-10-18[/tpl] In 2008, the Pageant sold more tickets than all but three other clubs in the world, according to Pollstar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ishootshows.com/2008/10/12/pollstars-top-100-clubs-2008|title=Pollstarâ€™s Top 100 Clubs 2008|accessdate=2012-03-16[/tpl]
