==History==

Charleston Town Center opened in 1983 in downtown Charleston, West Virginia, as the largest downtown-based shopping mall located east of the Mississippi River.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.charlestontowncenter.com/about/index.html |title=About Us |accessdate=2008-10-06 |work=Charleston Town Center[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] At the time, it included four anchor stores: JCPenney, Sears, Kaufmann's and Montgomery Ward. The mall remained largely unchanged until Stone & Thomas opened next to Montgomery Ward, moving from an existing location downtown. This Stone & Thomas store was later renamed Elder-Beerman when the chain was purchased in 1998, but Elder-Beerman closed it in 2000, the same year that Montgomery Ward closed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/society-social/communities-neighborhoods-cities/11445592-1.html |title=Charleston Town Center working to fill rash of empty storefronts |accessdate=2008-10-06 |last=Elmer |first=Joann C. |date=2001-07-09 |work=The State News[/tpl]
In 2002, plans were announced to renovate the mall. Under these plans, Dillard's (which, at the time, had no locations in West Virginia) would have opened in the former Montgomery Ward space.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8960827_ITM |title=Charleston, W.Va., Mall to Attract Upscale Retailers. |accessdate=2008-10-06 |last=Finn |first=Scott |date=2002-10-25 |work=The Charleston Gazette[/tpl] In return, the Dillard's chain asked for a $1-a-year lease as part of an incentive package,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8763245_ITM |title=Dillard's Wants Hefty Incentive Package to Open in Charleston, W.Va.

In 2005, the retail bookstore chain Books-A-Million also expressed interest in replacing the former Montgomery Ward,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8246057_ITM |title=Books-A-Million looks at Charleston Town Center space. |accessdate=2008-10-06 |last= Wilson |first=Paul |date=2005-02-01 |work=Charleston Gazette[/tpl] although this store also never came to fruition. Finally, by 2006, it was announced that BrickStreet Insurance would locate its offices in the former Montgomery Ward space.[tpl]cite web |url=http://wowktv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&storyid=17083 |title=BrickStreet Insurance May Move into Charleston Town Center |accessdate=2008-10-06 |last=Walters |first=Nicky |date=2006-12-05 |work=WOWK TV[/tpl] A year later, Kaufmann's was converted to Macy's due to the acquisition of Kaufmann's then-parent company, May Department Stores. The Steve & Barry's, along with all other Steve & Barry's stores in West Virginia, was closed in September 2008 due to bankruptcy.  In 2011, television station WOWK sub-leased some unused space in the Brickstreet area to relocate its TV studio.
