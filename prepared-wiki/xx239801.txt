[[ECTF]]

CATEGORIES: Telecommunications organizations

ECTF (The Enterprise Computer Telephony Forum) was formed in
1995 by telephony equipment and software suppliers to
improve the interoperability of various vendors’ CT solutions.
Until ECTF was formed, the computer telephony industry was an
alphabet soup of competing software and hardware platforms.
ECTF has sought to improve this situation, and to enhance
the “scaleability” of CT standards so that telephony systems
serving the needs of small businesses as well as large, multinational
corporations can be built using the same technology.Michael Thomas Bayer, "Computer telephony demystified: putting CTI, media services, and IP", McGraw-Hill Professional, 2001, ISBN 9780071359870
