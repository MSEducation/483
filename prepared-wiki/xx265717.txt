==History==

One version of the song is credited to Lillian Bowles and Winifred O'Hoyle, though it existed as a traditional folk song for longer than that, likely a negro spiritual of indeterminate origin.  An early version of the song was collected in a 1929 book, Old Songs Hymnal by Dorothy G. Bolton; the song is described has having a calypso feel to it, leading to speculation that it may have originated in Florida or the Caribbean.[ref]

The song became popularly associated with Southern gospel music when The Carter Family recorded in 1934 for Bluebird Records; this version is copyrighted to A. P. Carter.  Bill Monroe, the father of bluegrass music, added it to his regular set-list due to numerous requests from fans, and because he appreciated the construction metaphor in the song's lyrics.  It is believed that the Carter version was itself based on a much older version which the folklorist John Wesley Work III later included in his 1940 collection American Negro Songs and Spirituals.[tpl]cite book | title = A Tennessee folklore sampler: selections from the Tennessee folklore society | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=0Z90XdzMKE0C&pg=PA324&dq=i'm+working+on+a+building+song&hl=en&ei=flZ7TvlDiqK2B9vqse4P&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CFcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=i'm%20working%20on%20a%20building%20song&f=false| chapter = Field Recordings of Southern Black Music | last = Nemerov | first = Bruce | pages = 323â€“324 | year = 2009 | publisher = Univ. of Tennessee Press | accessdate = 2011-09-22[/tpl]
