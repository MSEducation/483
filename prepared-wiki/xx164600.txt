It was founded in 2001 by Ryan Hreljac with the focus of raising funds to enable clean water projects and health-related initiatives in African nations and other developing countries. Ryan's Well has completed over 500 projects bringing access to clean water and sanitation to over 750,000 people in 16 developing countries. The Ryanâ€™s Well Foundation grew from Ryan's interest at a young age of clean and safe water in developing countries, who raised money to build a well in Africa. His first well was built at Angolo Public School in northern Uganda.Ryan's Well Foundation

==Philosophy and work==

The Foundation's "BUILD" program supports water, sanitation and hygiene education projects in partnership with local non-governmental and community based organizations in developing countries. Their current focus is to the communities of West Africa (Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Togo), East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda), and Haiti. Their "EMPOWER" program aims to educate students at the elementary and secondary level about the need to conserve water and to understand the importance of safe water and sanitation and raises awareness about the issues.  The foundation has three ways to educate school children about water issues, the Youth in Action program, the Getting Involved program and the School Challenge program.
