Scots is the Germanic language variety  spoken in Lowland Scotland and parts of Ulster (where the local dialect is known as Ulster Scots).[tpl]Cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ListeDeclarations.asp?NT=148&CV=1&NA=&PO=999&CN=999&VL=1&CM=9&CL=ENG |title=List of declarations made with respect to treaty No. 148 |publisher=Conventions.coe.int |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09[/tpl] It is sometimes called Lowland Scots to distinguish it from Scottish Gaelic, the Celtic language historically restricted to most of the Highlands, the Hebrides and Galloway after the middle ages.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Because there are no universally accepted criteria for distinguishing languages from dialects, scholars and other interested parties often disagree about the linguistic, historical and social status of Scots.A.J. Aitken in The Oxford Companion to the English Language, Oxford University Press 1992. p.894 Although a number of paradigms for distinguishing between languages and dialects do exist, these often render contradictory results. Broad Scots is at one end of a bipolar linguistic continuum, with Scottish Standard English at the other.Stuart-Smith J. Scottish English: Phonology in Varieties of English: The British Isles, Kortman & Upton (Eds), Mouton de Gruyter, New York 2008. p.47 Consequently, Scots is generally regarded as one of the ancient varieties of English, yet it has its own distinct dialects. Alternatively, Scots is sometimes treated as a distinct Germanic language, in the way Norwegian is closely linked to, yet distinct from, Danish.
A 2010 Scottish Government study of "public attitudes towards the Scots language" found that 64% of respondents (around 1,000 individuals being a representative sample of Scotland's adult population) "don't really think of Scots as a language", but it also found that "the most frequent speakers are least likely to agree that it is not a language (58%) and those never speaking Scots most likely to do so (72%)".[tpl]Cite web|last=The Scottish Government|title=Public Attitudes Towards the Scots Language|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/01/06105123/0|accessdate=3 January 2010[/tpl] In the 2011 Scottish census, a question on Scots language ability was featured.

===Etymology===

Scots is a contraction of Scottis, the Older Scots[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/dsl/getent4.php?plen=46309&startset=34713072&query=SCOTS&fhit=Scots&dregion=form&dtext=snd#fhit |title=SND: Scots |publisher=Dsl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09[/tpl] and northern version of late Old English Scottisc (modern English "Scottish"), which replaced the earlier i-mutated version Scyttisc.OED online, Scots, a. (n.)OED online, Scottish, a. and n. Prior to the end of the 15th century, English speech in Scotland was known as  "English" (written Ynglis or Inglis at the time), whereas "Scottish" (Scottis) referred to Gaelic.
By the beginning of the 15th century, the English language used in Scotland had arguably become a distinct language[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl], albeit one lacking a name which clearly distinguished it from all the other English variants and dialects spoken in Britain. From 1495 the term Scottis was increasingly used to refer to the Lowland vernacular and Erse, meaning Irish, as a name for Gaelic. For example, towards the end of the 15th century, William Dunbar was using Erse to refer to Gaelic and, in the early 16th century, Gavin Douglas was using Scottis as a name for the Lowland vernacular.The Stewart Kingdom of Scotland 1371–1603,  Caroline Bingham, 1974Companion to the Oxford English Dictionary, Tom McArthur, Oxford University Press, 1994  The Gaelic of Scotland is now usually called Scottish Gaelic.
