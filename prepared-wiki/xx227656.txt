The buildings constructed before World War II are detailed in a neo-Georgian style characteristic of the early 20th century period of construction, while elements built in the postwar era have no historical or ornamental detailing.

==History==

The Highland Park General Hospital is a significant landmark in the history of Highland Park.  The hospital was one of the first two institutions established when Highland Park incorporated as a city in 1916.  The main building was constructed in the period from 1918â€“1921, and the growth and usage of the hospital contributed to the strong municipal identity of Highland Park, particularly as Detroit grew and annexed the surrounding suburbs.  The Highland Park General Hospital served the city as a hospital until its closing in 1976.
