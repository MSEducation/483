[[List of defunct rugby league clubs]]

CATEGORIES: Rugby league-related lists, Defunct rugby league teams, Lists of defunct sport organizations

This is a list of defunct professional rugby league clubs. It does not include reformed rugby league clubs, like the Sheffield Eagles or York City Knights. In these cases the spirit of the clubs, and their location, were unchanged, but the club was a new legal entity with a new administration. Where the club relocated to a significantly different town or area, this club can be considered defunct. This eliminates Fulham RLFC, who became the London Crusaders, then the London Broncos who became Harlequins Rugby League
