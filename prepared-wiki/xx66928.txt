I connect with an aura, with energy. And if the person with whom I connect happens to be a female, that's just the way it is. That's what makes my wheels turn."[tpl]cite news | publisher = Curve | url = http://backup.curvemag.com/Detailed/703.html| title = Kristanna Loken Headlines Dyke-Friendly New Film, BloodRayne | first = Tim | last = Nasson | accessdate = July 28, 2006 [/tpl]
