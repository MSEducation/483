The llawt'u or llawthu (Quechua,Diccionario Quechua - Español - Quechua, Academía Mayor de la Lengua Quechua, Gobierno Regional Cusco, Cusco 2005Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary) hispanicized spellings llauto, llautu) was an outfit of the ruling Sapa Incas. It was a variety of turban with the colours of the Tahuantinsuyo. The llawt'u was traditionally woven from the wool of the vicuña with different-colored plaits. On the front was a stripe of wool called the maskapaycha. The symbol of the quriqinqi was displayed on the front. It has been said that small dried frogs were worn under the garment as part of a tradition whose origins have been long lost.
