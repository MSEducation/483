Reading Street is a hamlet approximately 3 miles (4.8Â km) south east of Tenterden in Kent, England. It is situated on the B2080 road between Tenterden and Appledore at a point where a bridge crosses the Reading Sewer, and tributary of the River Rother.
Its church, dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, was originally moved from the nearby hamlet of Ebony in the 19th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.romneydeanery.org.uk/Ebony.shtml |title=Ebony.shtml |publisher=Romneydeanery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05[/tpl]
