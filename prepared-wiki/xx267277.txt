==Death==

Having regularly received death threats, he continued to criticize the local government.[tpl]cite web|author=Source: Unescopress |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/director_general_condemns_murder_of_peruvian_journalist_julio_castillo_narvaez/ |title=Director-General condemns murder of Peruvian journalist Julio Castillo Narváez | United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-19[/tpl] 
On May 3, 2011 Castillo was shot six times by four men during lunch at a restaurant.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ifj.org/en/articles/ifj-condemns-cold-blooded-murder-of-journalist-in-peru |title=IFJ Global - IFJ Condemns ‘Cold Blooded' Murder of Journalist in Peru |publisher=IFJ.org |date=2011-05-06 |accessdate=2011-10-19[/tpl] Despite the public nature of his murder, his assailants escaped immediate capture. 
Irina Bokova, the director-general of UNESCO, condemned Castillo's slaying: "This crime is an attack on the basic human right of journalists and citizens to speak their mind and hold free debates about issues that concern them. The tragedy of this killing is made all the more poignant for occurring on a day dedicated to the celebration of press freedom. I urge the authorities to investigate this killing and bring its culprits to justice.”
Despite the pressure applied by UNESCO and NGOs, no progress has been made in the case. However, there have been two additional shootings, one of them with a similar motive to Castillo's murder.[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/peru-second-journalist-murdered-this-09-09-2011,40953.html |title=Three murder suspects arrested amid growing risk of pressure on investigators - Reporters Without Borders |publisher=En.rsf.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-19[/tpl]

===Reaction===

Many journalism groups have spoken out and condemned Castillo's murder, and have called for authorities to tighten and continue the investigation. Reporters Without Borders said, “The political aspects of the case will almost certainly result in attempts to pressure the investigation." International Federation of Journalists Jim Boumelha said, "This is a shocking cold blooded murder and we urge the authorities to leave no stone unturned in the hunt for our colleague's killers who must face justice, it appears that the victim received threats prior to his murder, suggesting he was targeted for his journalistic work. The fact that he was killed on World Press Freedom Day adds to the hurt and the suffering from this tragedy but should also strengthen our resolve to stop violence against journalists".
