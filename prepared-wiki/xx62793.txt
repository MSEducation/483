The Whitechapel Bell Foundry is a bell foundry in Whitechapel in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, and is the oldest manufacturing company in Great Britain."500 Years of History" Whitechapel Bell Foundry website, accessed 26 December 2013. The foundry's main business is the bellfounding and manufacture of church bells and their fittings and accessories, although it also provides single tolling bells, carillon bells and handbells. 
The foundry's premises are a Grade II* listed building.

==Origins==

The company dates back to 1570. The present premises on Whitechapel Road and Plumbers Row dates from 1670 and was formerly a coaching inn called "The Artichoke" which ceased fading in 1738. The following year, the Whitechapel Bell Foundry moved in and occupied the site to the present day.Winn, p. 201.

==Notable bells==

In 1752 the foundry cast the Liberty Bell which was commissioned to celebrate the 50th anniversary of William Penn's 1701 Charter of Privileges, Pennsylvania's original constitution. The bell cracked in 1846 when it was first rung to mark the birthday of George Washington.  From 2003, the bell has been housed at the Liberty Bell Centre near Independence Hall.
Big Ben which tolls the hour at the Palace of Westminster was cast in 1858 and rung for the first time on 31 May 1859. "Big Ben" weighs 13Â½ tons and is the largest bell ever cast at the foundry. This bell also cracked because too heavy a hammer was initially used. The crack and the subsequent retuning gives Big Ben its distinctive present tone. A profile template of Big Ben surrounds the entrance door while Big Ben's original moulding gauge is retained near the foundry's furnaces.Whitechapel Bell Foundry The Story of Big Ben accessed 21 May 2007
Whitechapel supplied peals of 10 bells (later augmented to 12) for Guildford Cathedral in Surrey"Bell Ringing", Guildford Cathedral website, accessed 26 December 2013. in the years following the Second World War, recast and augmented the bells of Canterbury Cathedral to a peal of 14 in 1981,"Bells of Canterbury Cathedral", Canterbury Cathedral website, accessed 26 December 2013. and for the National Cathedral in Washington DC in 1964.Foreman and Foreman, p. 181.
The foundry produced "Great Tom" at Christ Church, Oxford, which can be heard from a distance of 13 miles, the "Clock Bells" at St Paul's Cathedral, the bells of Westminster Abbey and the 13 bells located at Liverpool's Anglican cathedral which are notable for being the heaviest change-ringing peal of bells in the world.Winn, p. 202.

The Whitechapel Bell Foundry designed the Olympic Bell seen at the opening ceremony for the London 2012 Olympic Games, although it was not cast on the premises. The furnaces at Whitechapel could not provide the 23 tons of molten metal required to make the bell, so it was manufactured at a factory in the Netherlands which normally produces ship's propellers."London 2012: Olympic bell made in Holland", The Telegraph (online edition), 20 April 2012, accessed 26 December 2013.
The Foundry also cast the bells used on the lead barge for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee water pageant in June 2012, [tpl]cite news|title=Thank you one and all: the people who helped make the Jubilee happen|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/the_queens_diamond_jubilee/9321258/Thank-you-one-and-all-the-people-who-helped-make-the-Jubilee-happen.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=10 June 2012[/tpl] which now hang in the church of St James Garlickhythe.
