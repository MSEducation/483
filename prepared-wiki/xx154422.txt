CATEGORIES: Villages in Kent, Sevenoaks

Well Hill is a small relatively rural settlement, a large hamlet or possibly a small village, in the Sevenoaks district of Kent. It lies immediately east of the Greater London border, is [tpl]convert|16|mi|km|0[/tpl] southeast of Charing Cross, London, and is within and very close to the M25 motorway. The hamlet is in the Kent, Sevenoaks District, but is close to Chelsfield and other parts of outer Orpington, in the London Borough of Bromley; Orpington is also the post town.
The Hamlet consists of several small cross roads on minor country roads which are mostly without street lighting or pavement and some are single track for a length and lined with trees. There are many detached houses with fairly large gardens, scattered with trees, a public house and a small church; further out there are several farms with many fields, and larger, denser woodland.
Well Hill is sometimes referred to as a village but usually a hamlet; although not an absolute definition, it does not have its own parish at present. Well Hill along with Crockenhill to the north make the electoral ward Crockenhill and Well Hill Ward; however the settlement is within the Shoreham Parish not Crockenhill Parish.
