Andy Kubiszewski (born on September 30, 1961) is an American musician, songwriter, remixer and producer. He has worked with bands Exotic Birds and Stabbing Westward, contributed to several other bands, and composed music for TV shows and films.

==Early life & band formation==

Kubiszewski was born in Charleston, South Carolina, United States. His start in rock music came while attending the Cleveland Institute of Music when he and a pair of classmates (later joined by Trent Reznor, of Nine Inch Nails fame) formed the new wave band Exotic Birds. The group was quickly picked to open shows for acts such as Culture Club, Information Society and the Eurythmics. The band existed in several formations through the 1980s with Kubiszewski consistent as the group's vocalist and leader.  The band released three albums before disbanding in the early 90s.

Kubiszewski is probably best known for his work with the band Stabbing Westward. After joining the band in 1995, he contributed to the band not only as a drummer, but also on guitars, programming, background vocals and songwriting, writing the bands biggest hit "What Do I Have To Do" (a demo clip of this song exists featuring Andy on vocals and, presumably, all other instruments).SW FaqEntertainment Ave!Musician Guide He has also contributed drums to several well-known acts both in the studio (Nine Inch Nails, Prick, t.A.T.u.) and on the road (Crowded House, The The).
