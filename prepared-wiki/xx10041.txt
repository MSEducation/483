CATEGORIES: Rosales, Angiosperm orders

Rosales is an order of flowering plants.Peter F. Stevens (2001 onwards). "Rosales". At: Trees At: Angiosperm Phylogeny Website. At: Missouri Botanical Garden Website. (see External links below) It is sister to a clade consisting of Fagales and Cucurbitales.[tpl]citation | author = Hengchang Wang, Michael J. Moore, Pamela S. Soltis, Charles D. Bell, Samuel F.

Rosales comprise nine families, the type family being the rose family, Rosaceae. The largest of these families are Rosaceae (90/2500) and Urticaceae (54/2600). The order Rosales is divided into three clades that have never been assigned a taxonomic rank. The basal clade consists of the family Rosaceae; another clade consists of four families, including Rhamnaceae; and the third clade consists of the four urticalean families.Douglas E. Soltis, et alii. (28 authors). 2011. "Angiosperm Phylogeny: 17 genes, 640 taxa". American Journal of Botany 98(4):704-730. [tpl]doi|10.3732/ajb.1000404[/tpl]
The order Rosales is strongly supported as monophyletic in phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences, such as those carried out by members of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group.Walter S. Judd, Christopher S. Campbell, Elizabeth A. Kellogg, Peter F. Stevens, and Michael J. Donoghue. 2008. Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach, Third Edition. Sinauer Associates: Sunderland, MA, USA. ISBN 978-0-87893-407-2 In their APG III system of plant classification, they defined Rosales as consisting of the nine families listed in the taxobox on the right. The relationships of these families were uncertain until 2011, when they were resolved in a molecular phylogenetic study based on two nuclear genes and ten chloroplast genes.Shu-dong Zhang, Douglas E. Soltis, Yang Yang, De-zhu Li, and Ting-shuang Yi. "Multi-gene analysis provides a well-supported phylogeny of Rosales". Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 60(1):21-28.

Well-known members of Rosales include: roses, strawberries, blackberries and raspberries, apples and pears, plums, peaches and apricots, almonds, rowan and hawthorn, jujube, elms, banyans, figs, mulberries, breadfruit, nettles, hops, and cannabis.

==Cronquist system==

In the obsolete Cronquist system, the order Rosales was many times polyphyletic. It consisted of the family Rosaceae and 23 other families that are now placed in various other orders.Arthur John Cronquist. 1981. An Integrated System of Classification of Flowering Plants. Columbia University Press: New York, NY, USA. ISBN 978-0-231-03880-5 These families and their placement in the APG III system are:
