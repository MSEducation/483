The Big Ten Conference (B1G), formerly Western Conference and Big Nine Conference, is the oldest Division I collegiate athletic conference in the United States. (The conference uses the "B1G" character combination in its labelling, noting that it "allows fans to see 'BIG' and '10' in a single word.")[ref]

Its twelve member institutions (which are primarily flagship research universities in their respective states, well-regarded academically, and with relatively large student enrollment) are located primarily in the Midwest, stretching from Nebraska in the west to Pennsylvania in the east. The conference competes in the  NCAA's Division I; its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A, the highest level of NCAA competition in that sport. Member schools of the Big Ten (or, in two cases, their parent university systems) also are members of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation, a leading educational and research consortium.
Despite the conference's name, the Big Ten actually consists of 12 schools, following the addition of Pennsylvania State University in 1990 and the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln in 2011.  In 2014, the conference will expand to 14 full members with the additions of the University of Maryland and Rutgers University, and one affiliate member with the addition of Johns Hopkins University in men's lacrosse. It is not to be confused with the Big 12 Conference, which has ten schools and represents a different region of the country, save for the state of Iowa.
