[/ref] Foley is a principal city of the Daphne–Fairhope–Foley Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Baldwin County.

==History==

Foley was named for its founder, John B. Foley of Chicago.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=11935|title= Profile for Foley, Alabama, AL|publisher=ePodunk|accessdate=2012-03-07[/tpl] As Foley was traveling to President McKinley's funeral in 1901, he met a railroad agent who told him of the area in South Baldwin County.  Foley came down the following year, and he  liked what he saw and bought up between [tpl]convert|40000|acre|km2[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|50000|acre|km2[/tpl] of land. He then returned to Chicago and formed the Magnolia Land Company.  As he began to sell off acreage, he realized the need for a better way for the people to come to Foley.  Foley used some of his own money to lay the rails so the train could come from Bay Minette. The first railroad station was built in 1905. The original station burned in 1908 and was replaced the following year by the station that is now the City's museum. John Foley donated parcels of land for a school and churches.  The first train to service Foley was a wood burner called the "Pine Knot Special."  It would leave Foley in the morning and make a return trip in the afternoon.  As people cleared the land, they would place liter knots in a wood box for the engineer to use as was needed. Foley was incorporated in 1915 with G. I. Weatherly serving as its first mayor.
