The Rockway Institute is a non-partisan, national center for LGBT research and public policy affiliated with the California School of Professional Psychology at Alliant International University in San Francisco. Rockway Institute brings together scientific research and professional expertise to counter anti-gay prejudice and inform public policies affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people.
A primary goal is to organize the most knowledgeable social scientists, mental health professionals, and physicians in the United States to provide accurate information about LGBT issues to the media, legislatures, and courts.
To assist balanced media coverage, the Institute provides links for reporters and others to important resources on LGBT research and public policy, including links to the policy statements of major mental health and medical professional associations.  Working with GLAAD, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, Rockway conducts media trainings for members of such organizations such as the Association of Gay and Lesbian Psychiatrists and Division 44 (the Society for the Psychological Study of LGBT Issues) of the American Psychological Association.
The Institute partners with groups such as Soulforce and AFFIRM to promote the use of accurate research in public policy discussions.
Rockway also conducts targeted research projects to address the nation's most pressing LGBT public policy questions.

==Name==

The institute is named in memory of the late Alan Rockway, a pioneering psychologist who helped write and defend the first LGBT employment non-discrimination ordinance to be approved in a major urban area in the US (Dade County, Florida, 1977). Passage of this ordinance became a major public event in LGBT history because of the widely televised efforts by Anita Bryant, Jerry Falwell and other opponents of same-sex marriage to repeal it. Dr. Rockway also started two of the nation's first LGBT mental health programs—in Miami, Florida, and Berkeley, California.http://www.alliant.edu/wps/wcm/connect/website/Home/Research+and+Public+Services/Research+Institutes/Rockway+Institute/
