A union territory, the political administration of the NCT of Delhi today more closely resembles that of a state of India, with its own legislature, high court and an executive council of ministers headed by a Chief Minister. New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal government of India and the local government of Delhi, and is the capital of the NCT of Delhi.
Delhi has been continuously inhabited since the 6th century BC.[tpl]cite book|last=Asher|first=Catherine B|editor=James D.

This is why Delhi is sometimes called the City of cities.

Delhi was the site of ancient Indraprastha (Khandavprastha), the mythical capital of the  Pandavas during the Mahabharata.

==Toponymy and idioms==

There are a number of legends associated with the origin of the name Delhi. One is that it is derived from Dhillu or Dilu, a king who built a city at this location in 50 BC and named it after himself.[tpl]cite book |last=Bakshi|first=S.R.|title=Delhi Through Ages|origyear=2002|publisher=Whispering Eye Bangdat |isbn=978-81-7488-138-0|page=2|year=1995 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Smith|first=George|title=The Geography of British India, Political & Physical |url=http://books.google.com/?id=C20DAAAAQAAJ&dq=raja+delhi+BC|accessdate=1 November 2008|publisher=J. Murray|pages=216–217|year=1882[/tpl] Another legend holds that the name of the city is based on the Hindi/Prakrit word dhili (loose) and that it was used by the Tomaras to refer to the city because the Iron Pillar of Delhi had a weak foundation and had to be moved. The coins in circulation in the region under the Tomaras were called dehliwal. According to the Bhavishya Purana, King Prithiviraja,of Indraprastha built a new fort in the modern-day Purana Qila area for the convenience of all four castes in his kingdom. He ordered the construction of a gateway to the fort and later named the fort dehali.Delhi City The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 11, p. 236.. Some historians believe that the name is derived from Dilli, a corruption of dehleez or dehali—both terms meaning 'threshold' or 'gateway'—and symbolic of the city as a gateway to the Gangetic Plain.A Dictionary of Urdu, Classical Hindi, and English.

==History==

The area around Delhi was probably inhabited before the second millennium BC, and there is evidence of continuous inhabitation since at least the 6th century BC. The city is believed to be the site of Indraprastha, the legendary capital of the Pandavas in the Indian epic Mahabharata. The earliest architectural relics date back to the Maurya period (c. 300 BC); in 1966, an inscription of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (273–236 BC) was discovered near Srinivaspuri. Remains of eight major cities have been discovered in Delhi. The first five cities were in the southern part of present-day Delhi. Anang Pal of the Tomara dynasty founded the city of Lal Kot in AD 736. The Chauhans conquered Lal Kot in 1180 and renamed it Qila Rai Pithora.
