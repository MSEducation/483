The Minister of Finance (de facto Deputy Prime Minister) was a member of the Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland (Cabinet) in the Parliament of Northern Ireland which governed Northern Ireland from 1921 to 1972.  The post was combined with that of the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland for a brief period in 1940 - 41 and was vacant for two weeks during 1953, following the death of incumbent Minister John Maynard Sinclair.  The Office was often seen as being occupied by the Prime Minister's choice of successor.  Two Ministers of Finance went on to be Prime Minister, while two more, Maginness and Jack Andrews were widely seen as possible successors to the Premiership.
