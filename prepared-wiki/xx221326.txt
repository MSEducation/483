[[Military of the British Virgin Islands]]

CATEGORIES: Military of the British Virgin Islands

The defence of the British Virgin Islands is the responsibility of the United Kingdom.  
The history of the islands is relatively free from armed conflict, and people of the British Virgin Islands have served in foreign militaries with great distinction.  Foremost amongst these is Samuel Hodge (grandson of notorious historical figure, Arthur William Hodge), who won the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest military honour, whilst serving in the Gambia Campaign for the British Army.
