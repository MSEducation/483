The college is located in the borough of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, 11 miles (17.7 km) southwest of Philadelphia. 
Founded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a Committee of Quakers from three Hicksite yearly meetings: Baltimore, New York, and Philadelphia.  Many of the founders were prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements and other social concerns and included Edward Parrish, Deborah and Joseph Wharton, Benjamin Hallowell, and James and Lucretia Mott.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/Library/friends/SCArchives/Biographies2.htm |title=Swarthmore College: About the Founders... |accessdate=2011-08-21[/tpl]  Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/news/history/index1.html |title=An Onward Spirit: A Brief History of Swarthmore College |accessdate=2011-08-21[/tpl] By 1906 Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation, becoming officially non-sectarian.
Today, the college is known for a rigorous intellectual character, shaped by a commitment to social responsibility and the legacy of its Quaker heritage."A glance at Swarthmore's Quaker roots”, The Daily Gazette.   Ninety percent of graduates eventually attend graduate or professional school, and over twenty percent of graduates attain a Doctor of Philosophy degree in their lifetime, rates among the highest of US institutions.
Swarthmore is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr, and Haverford Colleges. The consortium shares an integrated library system of more than three million volumes, and students are able to cross-register in courses at all three institutions. A common Quaker heritage exists amongst the consortium schools and the University of Pennsylvania also extends this cross-registration agreement to classes at the University of Pennsylvania's College of Arts and Sciences.Swarthmore: Quick Facts”, Swarthmore College website, June 2008.

==History==

The name "Swarthmore" has its roots in early Quaker history. In England, Swarthmoor Hall in the town of Ulverston, Cumbria was the home of Thomas and Margaret Fell in 1652 when George Fox, fresh from his epiphany atop Pendle Hill in 1651, came to visit. The visitation turned into a long association, as Fox persuaded Thomas and Margaret Fell and the inhabitants of the nearby village of Fenmore of his views. Swarthmoor was used for the first meetings of what became known as the Religious Society of Friends.
The school was founded in 1864 by a committee of Quakers who were members of the Philadelphia, New York and Baltimore Yearly Meetings of the Religious Society of Friends (Hicksite).  Edward Parrish was its first president. Lucretia Mott and Martha Ellicott Tyson[tpl]cite web|title=Maryland Women's Hall of Fame: Martha Ellicott Tyson|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/educ/exhibits/womenshall/html/tyson.html|publisher=Maryland State Archives|accessdate=7 March 2014[/tpl]  were among those who insisted that Swarthmore be coeducational. Edward Hicks Magill, the second president, served for 17 years.Margaret Hope Bacon (1980), Valiant Friend: The Life of Lucretia Mott, page 199, ISBN 1-888305-09-6 His daughter, Helen Magill, was in the first class to graduate in 1873; in 1877 she was the first woman in the United States to earn a PhD - hers was in Greek from Boston University.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/wgs/community/womens-studies-family/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131012035256/http://www.bu.edu/wgs/community/womens-studies-family/|archivedate=2013-10-12|title=Women’s, Gender, & Sexuality Studies Faculty » Women's, Gender & Sexuality Studies Program – Boston University|publisher=web.archive.org|accessdate=23 January 2014[/tpl]
In the early 1900s, the College had a major football program (playing Navy, Princeton, Columbia, and other larger schools) and an active fraternity and sorority life.[ref]
