The focus is on evacuation, rather than long-term survival, distinguishing the bug-out bag from a survival kit, a boating or aviation emergency kit,  or a fixed-site disaster supplies kit.  The kits are also popular in the survivalism subculture.Rawles, James Wesley, Rawles on Retreats and Relocation, The Clearwater Press, Kooskia, ID, 2007, p. 5
The term "bug-out bag" is related to, and possibly derived from, the "bail-out bag" emergency kit many military aviators carry. In the United States, the term refers to the Korean War practice of the U.S. Army designating alternate defensive positions, in the event that the units had to displace. They were directed to "bug-out" when being overrun was imminent. The concept passed into wide usage among other military and law enforcement personnel, though the "bail-out bag" is as likely to include emergency gear for going into an emergency situation as for escaping an emergency.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bluesheepdog.com/2009/07/16/the-bail-out-bag/ |title=The Bail Out Bag |publisher=BlueSheepdog.com |date=2009-07-16 |accessdate=2011-06-18[/tpl]

==Rationale==

The primary purpose of a bug-out bag is to allow one to evacuate quickly if a disaster should strike.Dr. Bruce Clayton, Life After Doomsday, Chapter 3 (To Flee of Not To Flee), p. 39, Paladin Press, Boulder, CO, 1980 It is therefore prudent to gather all of the materials and supplies that might be required to do this into a single place, such as a bag or a few storage containers. The recommendation that a bug-out bag contain enough supplies for seventy-two hours arises from advice from organizations responsible for disaster relief and management that it may take them up to seventy-two hours to reach people affected by a disaster and offer help.  The bag's contents may vary according to the region of the user, as someone evacuating from the path of a hurricane may have different supplies from someone who lives in an area prone to tornadoes or wildfires.
In addition to allowing one to survive a disaster evacuation, a bug-out bag may also be used when sheltering in place as a response to emergencies such as house fires, blackouts, tornadoes, and other severe natural disasters.
Some survivalists also recommend keeping a 'get me home' kit in the car and/or at work. This is a kit to enable getting back home from work in an emergency where all transport cars and public transport has broken down and is designed around personal circumstances where, for example, a walk of 25 kilometres might be required from work to home. The 'get me home' kit can include, for example, enough water to get home, suitable walking shoes, a map (not electronic), enough food for 12 hours, clothing for adverse weather, etc.
