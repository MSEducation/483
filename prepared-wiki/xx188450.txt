[tpl]nihongo|Jingisukan|ジンギスカン||"Genghis Khan"[/tpl] is a Japanese grilled mutton dish prepared on a convex metal skillet or other grill. The dish is particularly popular on the northern island of Hokkaidō and in China, Thailand.

==Etymology==

The dish is rumored to be so named because in prewar Japan, lamb was widely thought to be the meat of choice among Mongolian soldiers, and the dome-shaped skillet is meant to represent the soldiers' helmets that they purportedly used to cook their food. 
In 1918, according to the plan by the Japanese government to increase the flock to one million sheep, five sheep farms were established in Japan. However, all of them were demolished except in Hokkaido (Takikawa and Tsukisamu). 
Because of this, Hokkaido's residents first began eating the meat from sheep that they sheared for their wool.
There is a dispute over from where the dish originated; candidates include Tokyo, Zaō Onsen, and Tōno. The first Jingisukan dedicated restaurant was a [tpl]nihongo|Jingisu-sō吉思荘||"Genghis House"[/tpl] that opened in Tokyo in 1936.
