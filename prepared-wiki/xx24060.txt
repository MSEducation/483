Nepali or Nepalese (नेपाली), is a language in the Indo-Aryan languages. It is the official language and de facto lingua franca of Nepal and is also spoken in Bhutan. Nepali has official language status in the Indian state of Sikkim and in West Bengal's Darjeeling district as well as Assam. Nepali developed in proximity to a number of Indo-Aryan languages, most notably Pahari and Magahi, and shows Sanskrit influences. However, owing to Nepal's geographical area, the language has also been influenced by Tibeto-Burman. Nepali is mainly differentiated from Central Pahari, both in grammar and vocabulary, by Tibeto-Burman idioms owing to close contact with the respective language group. Nepali language shares 40% lexical similarity with Bengali language. British Resident at Kathmandu Brian Houghton Hodgson has observed that it is, in eight-tenths of its vocables, substantially Hindi.[tpl]cite book |last= Hodgson |first= Brian Houghton |year=2013 |title= Essays on the Languages, Literature, and Religion of Nepál and Tibet |url= http://books.google.com.np/books?id=DuUxTMez9n4C&dq=hodgson+essays+on+the+languages&source=gbs_navlinks_s |edition=Reprint |publisher= Cambridge University Press |page=2 |isbn=9781108056083 |accessdate=27 March 2014[/tpl]
Historically, the language was first called the Khas language (Khas kurā), then Gorkhali or Gurkhali (language of the Gorkha Kingdom) before the term Nepali (Nepālī bhāṣā) was taken from Nepal Bhasa. Other names include Parbatiya ("mountain language", identified with the Parbatiya people of Nepal) and Lhotshammikha (the "southern language" of the Lhotshampa people of Bhutan).[tpl]cite book |last=Clark |first=T.

==Literature==

Nepali developed a significant literature within a short period of a hundred years in the 19th century. This literary explosion was fueled by Adhyatma Ramayana; Sundarananda Bara (1833); Birsikka, an anonymous collection of folk tales; and a version of the South Asian epic Ramayana by Bhanubhakta. The contribution of trio-laureates Lekhnath Poudyal, Laxmi Prasad Devkota Muna Madan, and Balkrishna Sama took Nepali to the level of other world languages. Laxmi Prasad Devkota is Greatest Poet of Nepali. The contribution of expatriate writers outside Nepal, especially in Darjeeling and Varanasi in India, is also notable.
In the past decade, there have been many contributions to Nepali literature from the Nepali diaspora in Asia, Europe, and America.

==Number of speakers==

According to the 2011 national census, 44.6 percent of the population of Nepal speak Nepali as a native language.[tpl]cite web | last =| first =| url = http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Major-Finding.pdf| title =Major highlights|page =4 | publisher =Central Bureau of Statistics| year=2013| accessdate =12 September 2013[/tpl] The Ethnologue website counts more than 17 million (2007) and 42 million (2012) speakers worldwide, 17 million within Nepal (from the 2001 census).Ethnologue Report for Nepali (Accessed 1 February 2009).
Nepali is traditionally spoken in the Hill Region of Nepal (Pahad, पहाड), especially in the western part of the country. Though Nepal Bhasa was the dominant language in the Kathmandu valley, Nepali is currently the most dominant. Nepali is used in government and as the everyday language of a growing portion of the local population.  Nevertheless, the exclusive use of Nepali in the courts and government of Nepal is being challenged. Recognition of other ethnic languages in Nepal was one of the objectives of the Maoist insurgency.[tpl]cite web | last =Gurung| first =Dr. Harka| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:_EjPx16iamMJ:ilo-mirror.library.cornell.edu/public/french/standards/norm/egalite/itpp/activity/nepal/maoist.pdf+maoist+ethnic+languages&hl=en&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESh5Rv-hnGuft7SgUZ4q4klwfV3w2JAr6MS1kzAjZ_miPx8mx5lxWslhcgk4ZmGnLIiOtdKdn_xf2aJsm9---j-tmG6QxzWJDOCIt9XiECNjQdQlNzlBoyEuBr44ntEtunobpdnk&sig=AHIEtbSV2Hzu8wkZ0wDFbDlhDijQdcptbg| title =Social Exclusion and Maoist Insurgency| work = | publisher = | date=19–20 January 2005| accessdate = 13 April 2012[/tpl] Page 5.
In Bhutan, those who speak Nepali (known as Lhotshampa) are estimated at about 35 percent [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35839.htm |title=Background Note: Bhutan |date=2010-02-02 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=2010-10-02[/tpl] of the population. This number includes displaced Bhutanese refugees, with unofficial estimates of the ethnic Nepali population as high as 30 to 40 percent, constituting a majority in the south (about 242,000 people).[tpl]cite book|last1=Worden |first1=Robert L. |last2=Savada |first2=Andrea Matles (ed.) |title=Nepal and Bhutan: Country Studies |chapter=Chapter 6: Bhutan - Ethnic Groups |edition=3rd |year=1991 |pages=424 |publisher=Federal Research Division, United States Library of Congress |isbn=0-8444-0777-1 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/bttoc.html |accessdate=2010-10-02[/tpl]) Since the late 1980s, over 100,000 Lhotshampas have been forced out of Bhutan, accused by the government of being illegal aliens. A large portion of them were expelled in an "ethnic cleansing" campaign, and presently live in refugee camps in eastern Nepal.
In India, there is a large number of Nepali-speaking people. In North-East India (states of Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh), there are several million Nepali speakers. A considerable number of Nepali-speaking people are also present in many Indian cities such as Kolkata, Delhi, Bangalore, Visakhapatnam, Goa, Bihar, Darjeeling, Sikkim, Chennai, Mumbai, and Hyderabad.
Combining the Ethnologue figures  with strong population growth in Nepal and India, the assumption of 20 million people with Nepali as their native language is a reasonable estimate for 2006.[tpl]clarify|date=August 2013[/tpl]

==History of the language==

Around 500 years ago, Khas from the Karnali-Bheri-Seti basin migrated eastward, bypassing inhospitable Kham highlands to settle in lower valleys of the Gandaki basin that were well suited to rice cultivation. One notable extended family settled in Gorkha, a small principality about halfway between Pokhara and Kathmandu. In 1559 AD a Lamjunge prince Dravya Shah established him in the throne of Gorkha with the help of local Khas and Magars. He raised an army of khas with the commandership of Bhagirath Panta. Later, in the late 18th century his heir Prithvi Narayan Shah raised and improvised an army of Khasa (Chhetri), Thakuri, Gurungs, and Magars and possibly other hill tribesmen and set out to conquer and consolidate dozens of small principalities in the Himalayan foothills. Since Gorkha had replaced the original Khas homeland as thary initiative, Khaskura was redubbed Gorkhali, i.e. language of the Gorkhas. [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
The most notable military achievement of Prithvi Narayan was conquest of the urbanized Kathmandu Valley, on the eastern rim of the Gandaki basin. This region was also called Nepal at the time. Kathmandu became Prithvi Narayan's new capital, from which he and his heirs extended their domain east across the Koshi basin, north to the Tibetan Plateau, south into the plains of northern India, and west across the Karnali/Bheri basin and beyond.

Expansion – particularly to the north, west, and south – brought the growing state into conflict with the British and Chinese. This led to wars that trimmed back the territory to an area roughly corresponding to Nepal's present borders. Both China and Britain understood the value of a buffer state and did not attempt to further reduce the territory of the new country. Since the Kathmandu Valley or Nepal had become the new center of political initiative, this word gradually came to refer to the entire realm and not just the Kathmandu Valley. And so Gorkhali, language of Gorkha, again came to be known as Nepali.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
In all these years, Nepali has had influences from many languages. While Nepali is technically from the same family as languages like Hindi and Bengali, it has taken many loan words. Words like Dhoka (door), Jhyaal (window), Pasal (shop), Kukhura (rooster), Raango (Water buffalo) have Tibeto-Burmese roots. Words like Saheed (martyr) and Kaanun (law) come from Arabic, Turkish and Persian roots. Many English words are in use nowadays due to the rising popularity of America in the region and the previous British aid in schools and other fields. But overall, Nepali still retains its Sanskrit roots.
Khaskura/Gorkhali/Nepali is spoken indigenously over most of Nepal west of the Kaligandaki River, then progressively less further to the east.  This is shown graphically in detailed language maps of western http://www.ethnologue.com/show_map.asp?name=NP&seq=30 and eastern http://www.ethnologue.com/show_map.asp?name=NP&seq=20 Nepal as language number 73.
