The Ozark Highlands Trail roams [tpl]convert|218|mi[/tpl] through parts of seven counties in northwest Arkansas. It stretches from Lake Fort Smith State Park, across the Ozark National Forest, to the Buffalo National River. The trail passes through some of the most remote and scenic portions of the Ozark Mountains, like the Hurricane Creek Wilderness Area. It also crosses White Rock Mountain, Hare Mountain, the Marinoni Scenic Area, and many other breathtaking spots.  Long term plans to connect the similarly named Ozark Trail in Missouri to the Ozark Highlands Trail in Arkansas, resulting in over [tpl]convert|700|mi[/tpl] of continuous trails through the Ozarks, have been vetoed by the National Park Service.
