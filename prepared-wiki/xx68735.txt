==Playing career==

Barfield had by far the best outfield arm of the 1980s.James, Bill. The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract. The Free Press. 2001. p. 299.  He led American League outfielders in assists three times (1985–87). Along with George Bell (LF) and Lloyd Moseby (CF), Barfield starred in what many analysts considered the best all-around outfield of the 1980s.[tpl]Weasel-inline|date=April 2009[/tpl]
Selected by the Blue Jays in the ninth round of the 1977 amateur draft, Barfield debuted in the majors in 1981 and was a regular the following season. In 1985, he helped Toronto reach the playoffs for the first time. He also topped 20 home runs six times, became the first Blue Jay to hit a pinch grand slam (1982), and the first to hit 20 homers and steal 20 bases in the same season (1985).
Despite the Blue Jays' failure to defend their division title from the previous year, Barfield enjoyed his best personal season in 1986. He collected career-highs in batting average (.289), RBI (108), runs (107), hits (170) doubles (35), and wRC+ (147). He also hit a career-best 40 home runs, leading the major leagues and setting a team record which lasted one year. In addition, Barfield was awarded the Gold Glove Award and selected to the American League All-Star team.
Barfield was traded to the Yankees for pitcher Al Leiter on April 30, [tpl]by|1989[/tpl]. He won his second Gold Glove in 1987, but his offensive numbers declined noticeably. He hit 25 home runs for New York in 1990, but never produced like the club had hoped. Injuries and general ineffectiveness forced his retirement in 1992, at age 32, after he hit just .137 in 30 games. In [tpl]By|1993[/tpl], he played in Japan with the Yomiuri Giants, reuniting with Moseby, but batted just .215 in 114 games and was released.
He joined the Houston Astros for spring training in [tpl]By|1994[/tpl] and was projected to be the opening-day right-fielder, but injuries prevented him from making the ballclub.
Throughout his career Barfield was a free swinger and racked up more than 140 strikeouts in five seasons ('85, '86, '87, '89 and '90). For most of his time in the major leagues his productivity overshadowed his strikeouts; however by 1990, 1 in 3 Barfield at bats resulted in a strikeout.
Barfield was a career .256 hitter with 241 home runs, 716 RBI, and 39 WAR in 1428 games. He was inducted in the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 1990.

==Quotes==

From the book Baseball Quotations (ISBN 0-345-38123-8) edited by David H. Nathan:
"One time I dropped a fly ball in Milwaukee and, after the game, the writers asked me what happened. I told them, 'Well, I was looking up and a UFO flew right across. It was weird. I never saw anything like that in my life.' Man, I was only joking and they wrote it up and put it in the paper." - Jesse Barfield, Toronto Blue Jays outfielder, 1986
