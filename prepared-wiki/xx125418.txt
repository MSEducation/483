==Policing and Crime Act==

The English Collective of Prostitutes spearheaded campaigning against the Policing and Crime Act 2009,[tpl]cite web|url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2008-09/policingandcrime.html |title=Parliament UK: Bills before Parliament |publisher=Services.parliament.uk |date=2009-11-12 |accessdate=2010-10-06[/tpl] which included proposals to criminalise anyone involved in the sex industry whether or not there is force or coercion; target safer premises; seize and retain money and assets, even without a conviction; increase arrests against street workers; arrest men on "suspicion"; imprison sex workers who breach a compulsory rehabilitation order."WI enlisted in fight against prostitution", Independent, 26 November 2008. The E.C.P. argues that these measures will force prostitution underground, exposing sex workers to greater danger and preventing them coming forward to report violence and access health and other services.

==Trafficking==

The ECP argues that discredited academic work has falsely labelled most sex workers as victims of "trafficking". Its website provides critiques of such work.More or Less BBC Radio 4 1:30pm Friday 9 January 2009.

==Local issues==

The ECP has been involved in local campaigns aimed at making life safer for prostitutes following incidents in certain areas, for example, the Ipswich Murders of 2006 in which all the victims are alleged to have been prostitutes. It also objects to the actions of Reading Borough Council and the Thames Valley Police, which have been targeting prostitutes working in the Oxford Road area of Reading, Berkshire, for several years.[tpl]cite web|last=Prior |first=Malcolm |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/berkshire/2972595.stm |title=UK | England | Berkshire | 'Saving' the street-walkers |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-04-24 |accessdate=2010-10-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/berkshire/4132349.stm |title=UK | England | Berkshire | Photos of prostitutes condemned |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-12-29 |accessdate=2010-10-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/berkshire/6506445.stm |title=UK | England | Berkshire | Vice crackdown sees 22 arrested |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-03-29 |accessdate=2010-10-06[/tpl]
