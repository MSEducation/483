Samaritans (until 2002 known as The Samaritans) is a registered charity aimed at providing emotional support to anyone in emotional distress, struggling to cope, or at risk of suicide throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland, often through their telephone helpline.  The name comes from the Biblical parable of the Good Samaritan, though the organisation is secular.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.samaritans.org/ |title=If Christmas starts to hurt, weâ€™ll be here |publisher=Samaritans |date= |accessdate=2013-12-21[/tpl] Its international network exists under the name Befrienders Worldwide, which is part of the Volunteer Emotional Support Helplines (VESH) with Lifeline International and the International Federation of Telephone Emergency Services (IFOTES).

==History==

Samaritans was founded in 1952 by Chad Varah, a vicar in the London Diocese.  His inspiration came from an experience he had had some years earlier as a young curate in the Diocese of Lincoln. He had taken a funeral for a girl of fourteen who had killed herself because she feared she had contracted an STD. In reality, she was menstruating. Varah placed an advertisement in a newspaper encouraging people to volunteer at his church, listening to people contemplating suicide. The movement grew rapidly: within ten years there were 40 branches and there are now 203 branches across the UK and Ireland, deliberately organised without regard to national boundaries on the basis that a service which is not political or religious should not recognise sectarian or political divisions.[ref]
