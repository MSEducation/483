Hazel Meyers was an American classic female blues and country blues singer. She spent most of her career in black vaudeville, although on recordings she was billed as a blues artist. Her more famous numbers included "Heartbreaking Blues" and "Blackville After Dark", both sung in her contralto voice.

==Biography==

Meyers' recording career composed of a total of forty-one sides, the majority waxed between September 1923 and August 1924.  She saw her output released by several record labels, including Ajax, Brunswick (issued under the Vocalion banner) PathÄ—, Banner, Bell, and Emerson, with her final couple of releases appearing on Okeh in June 1926. Meyers had gramophone record releases on six different labels in 1924.  Her accompanists variously included Fletcher Henderson, Porter Grainger, James "Bubber" Miley, Leslie "Hutch" Henderson and Don Redman, plus on one recording, Fats Waller. Meyers' tracks included the first female vaudeville artist recording of the satirical song, "Black Star Line", released in May 1924.  The song was recorded by both Meyers and Rosa Henderson within a twenty four hour period. 
One source speculated that Meyers also recorded under the pseudonyms of Mae Harris for Domino, and Louella Smith for Oriole.
Meyers appeared in vaudeville throughout the 1920s.  Detailed information is not available, but she did appear in Steppin' High, a variety show staged in Harlem, New York, where she was backed by the orchestra of Fletcher Henderson.  More generally, she is believed to have made regular appearances in the theater until the early 1930s.
However, little is known of life outside of her professional engagements.[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p201904|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=Hazel Meyers|author=Uncle Dave Lewis |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=September 26, 2011[/tpl]
