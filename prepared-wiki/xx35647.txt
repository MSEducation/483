 [[File:Barton Broad.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Barton Broad]] As the river nears [[Barton Broad]] it passes a triangular island called the Heater. The channels either side lead to Barton Turf staithe and its boatyard. The river now enters [[Barton Broad]], the second largest of the Broads. Its crystal clear waters are the result of considerable effort and money spent to clean the broad up over the last few years. Barton Broad is unique in that it has an island, called “Pleasure Hill”.

==The last stretch==

The Ant leaves Barton Broad at its south east corner and enters a stretch called “The Shoals”. All around this area can be seen numerous drainage mills. The river meanders through the flat Broadland countryside, passing the drainage mills of Clayrack and Boadman’s on the east bank, and Turf Fen Drainage mill on the west bank. Here the river passes How Hill nature reserve, which is open to the public. From here it makes a wide horseshoe bend, passing Neaves Drainage mill as it heads towards Ludham Bridge. The Ant passes under the bridge carrying the A1062 road, and turns sharply east before straightening out a little. It then turns south and enters the river Bure at Ant Mouth, close to the ruins of St Benet’s Abbey."Rivers of East Anglia, By James Turner: Publisher: Cassell & Company Limited (1954):ASIN B0007JD6TQ

==Saxon discovery==

The remains of a Saxon boat were found by the Environment Agency in August 2010 when working on the river during vital flood defence work. The boat, around 3 m (9.8 ft) long, had been hollowed out by hand from a single piece of oak and was found at the bottom of the river between Horning Hall and Brown's Hill. Five animal skulls were found near the boat, which was taken to specialists in York to be treated with special preservatives. Once the treatment has been completed the boat will be delivered to the Castle Museum in Norwich and put on display to the public.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-11187207 |title=Saxon boat uncovered in Norfolk's River Ant |publisher=BBC |date=4 Sep 2010[/tpl]
