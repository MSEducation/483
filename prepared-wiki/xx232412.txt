[[X-ray notation]]

CATEGORIES: Atomic physics

X-ray notation is a method of labeling atomic orbitals that grew out of X-ray science. It is still traditionally used with most X-ray spectroscopy techniques including AES and XPS. In X-ray notation, every principal quantum number is given a letter associated with it.
