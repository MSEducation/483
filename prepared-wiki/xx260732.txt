In December 1935, the University of Nevada, Reno hired Dashiell as the head coach of its football team.Dashiell New Nevada Coach, Christian Science Monitor, December 18, 1935.

Through his first two seasons, Nevada recorded a 6–10 mark. During the 1938 season, the Wolf Pack amassed a 2–2–1 record with one game remaining against the College of the Pacific. Dashiell resigned on the eve of that game, October 27, 1938, bowing to pressure from an "open rebellion" amongst the student body. Forty football players, the team manager, and student president had signed a petition for the ouster of Dashiell, line coach Duane Keller, and athletic director J. E. Martie. The group stated: "Our complaint against Martie is that he has refused to provide us with the proper equipment, that he is disrupting the whole athletic setup and that no football coach can hope to succeed so long as Martie is director of athletics ... So far as Doug Dashiell and Duane Keller are concerned, we have nothing against them personally. We believe them to be fine men, but we do not believe they know how to coach football. Their stuff will not work for a college team."  The basketball team, however, requested the retention of Martie as its coach.Nevada Coach Ousted, Berkeley Daily Gazette, October 25, 1938. The final game against Pacific was "coachless", but led through pre-game practices by veteran tackle Harry Bradley and injured tackle Ray Garamendi.
