The Octopus Automatic Add Value Service (AAVS) is another method by which cardholders may add value to their cards. This service allows for money to be automatically deducted from a credit card and added to an Octopus card when the value of the Octopus card is less than zero dollars. The credit card used must be one offered by one of 22 financial institutions that participate in AAVS.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/payment/reload/en/aavs.jsp|title=Automatic Add Value Service|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=25 March 2007[/tpl] Participating banks include HSBC, Bank of China, and Hang Seng Bank. HK$250 is added to the card each time value is automatically added; six participating financial institutions offer an option of adding a value of HK$500 instead.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/payment/reload/en/financialinst.jsp|title=List of Participating Financial Institutions|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=25 March 2007[/tpl]
An Octopus card may be returned to any MTR Customer Service Centre for a refund of the remaining value stored on it. A handling fee may be charged for the refund; HK$7 for an anonymous On-Loan card that had been in use for fewer than three months, and HK$10 for a Personalised On-Loan card that was issued on or after 1 November 2004. A refund is immediately provided at the time an anonymous On Loan card is returned, unless it has more than HK$500 stored on it. A Personalised On-Loan card or an anonymous On-Loan card with more than HK$500 stored on it needs to be sent back to Octopus Cards Limited for refund processing, in which case, the refund for a Personalised On-Loan card would be available in eight days, and that of an anonymous On-Loan card would be available in five days. If a damaged card is returned for refund, a HK$30 levy would be charged to the cardholder.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/faq/en/refund.jsp|title=FAQ: Refund Procedures|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=25 March 2007[/tpl]

==Technology==

The Octopus system was designed by Australia-based company ERG Group (now Vix Technology). The company was selected in 1994 to lead the development of the Octopus project and was responsible for the building and installation of the components of the Octopus system.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.erggroup.com/projects/hongkong.htm|title=Projects: Hong Kong|publisher=ERG Group|accessdate=9 April 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061110130259/http://www.erggroup.com/projects/hongkong.htm |archivedate = 10 November 2006|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Operations, maintenance and development was undertaken by Octopus Cards Limited, and in 2005, it replaced the central transaction clearing house with its own system.
The Octopus card uses the Sony 13.56 MHz FeliCa radio frequency identification (RFID) chip,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/article/articleview/374/1/1/|title=RFID Smart Cards Gain Ground|publisher=RFID Journal|date=9 April 2003|accessdate=8 July 2007[/tpl] with Hong Kong being the world's first major public transport system using this technology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/Products/felica/pdf/data/FeliCa_E.pdf|title=FeliCa|publisher=Sony Corporation|format=PDF|accessdate=11 April 2007[/tpl] It is a "touch and go" system, so users need only hold the card in close proximity of the reader, and thus physical contact is not required. Data is transmitted at up to 212 kbit/s (the maximum speed for Sony FeliCa chips), compared to 9.6 kbit/s for other smart card systems like Mondex and Visa Cash. The card has a storage capacity of 1 KB to 64 KB compared to the 125 bytes provided by traditional magnetic stripe card.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/digital21/eng/knowledge/smarttech.html|title=Smart Card Technology|publisher=Hong Kong SAR Government Information Centre|date=31 January 2007|accessdate=11 April 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071015170810/http://www.info.gov.hk/digital21/eng/knowledge/smarttech.html |archivedate = 15 October 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
Octopus uses a nonstandard system for RFID instead of the more popular ISO/IEC 14443 standards, since there were no standards in the nascent industry during its development in 1997. The operating range of the reader/writer is between 30 and 100 mm (1.18 and 3.94 in) depending on the type of model being used.
Octopus is specifically designed so that card transactions are relayed for clearing on a store and forward basis, without any requirement for reader units to have realtime round-trip communications with a central database or computer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-05/bh-us-05-mahaffey.pdf|title=Passive RFID Security|author=Kevin Mahaffey|publisher=BlackHat|page=20|date=July 2005|accessdate=11 April 2007|format=PDF[/tpl] The stored data about the transaction may be transmitted by network after hours, or in the case of offline mobile readers may be retrieved by a hand held device, for example a Pocket PC.
In practice, different data collection mechanisms are used by different transport operators, depending on the nature of their business. The MTR equips its stations with local area networks that connect the components that deal with Octopus cards—turnstiles, Add Value Machines, value-checking machines and customer service terminals. Transactions from these stations are relayed to the MTR's Kowloon Bay headquarters through a frame relay wide area network, and hence onwards to the central clearing house system (CCHS) for clearing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN007495.pdf|title=Integrated Transport and Land Use Planning as a Success Factor for Metros|author=Jack So|publisher=UNPAN|accessdate=11 April 2007|format=PDF[/tpl] Similar arrangements are in place for retailers such as 7-Eleven. Handheld devices are used to scan offline mobile readers, including those installed on minibuses. Buses either use handheld devices or a wireless system, depending on operator.

===Security===

The Octopus card uses encryption for all airborne communication and performs mutual authentication between the card and reader based on the ISO 9798-2 three-pass mutual authentication protocol.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/files/epfiles/FeliCaRC.pdf|title=FeliCa RC-S860 Contactless Smart Card Security Target (Public Version)|date=20 August 2002|author=FeliCa Division, Sony Corporation|authorlink=Sony|format=PDF|page=61|accessdate=23 October 2008[/tpl] In other words, data communications are only established when the card and reader have mutually authenticated based on a shared secret access key. This means that the security of the Octopus card system would be jeopardized should the access key be exposed. A stolen Octopus card reader could be used with stolen Octopus software, for example, to add value (up to HK$1,000) to any Octopus card without authorization.[tpl]cite news|title=Drunken pilot stole Octopus machine|first=Loretta|last=Fong|coauthors=Parry, Simon|date=18 October 2008|work=South China Morning Post|location=Hong Kong|page=3[/tpl] Nevertheless, as of 2003, the Octopus card and system have never been successfully hacked.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bigchief.com/whitepapers/rfid-world-2003-05-13.pdf|title=Security and Authentication Technologies|author=Peter Winer|publisher=Big Chief Partners, Inc.|page=20|date=13 May 2003|accessdate=11 April 2007|format=PDF[/tpl]
Octopus card reader includes a fail-safe that prevents reader from initiating transaction when more than one card is being detected at the same time. On 11 February 2009, Sing Tao Daily reported that the fail-safe has been abused for fare evasion through the railway station turnstile. A large amount of dishonest passengers at Sheung Shui Station and Lo Wu Station were stacking up 4 or more cards before breaking through the turnstile, pretending their cards have been touched with the reader correctly but triggering the fail-safe deliberately to avoid card value deduction. Because of this, if they get caught by the station staff, they can make an excuse of a hardware malfunction and offer the Octopus card with an unsuccessful transaction.

==Operator==

The Octopus card system is owned and operated by Octopus Cards Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Octopus Holdings Limited.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/company/en/index.jsp|title=Our Company|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|accessdate=15 May 2007[/tpl] The company was founded as Creative Star Limited in 1994 to oversee the development and implementation of the Octopus card system, and was renamed as its current name of Octopus Cards Limited in 2002. Creative Star was formed as a joint-venture company by five major transit companies in Hong Kong—MTR Corporation, Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, Kowloon Motor Bus, Citybus, and Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry. In January 2001, the shares of Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry in the company was transferred to New World First Bus and New World First Ferry.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/investrelation/2003frpt_e/F131.pdf|title=Interest in non-controlled subsidiary|page=27|publisher=MTR Corporation|accessdate=24 April 2007|format=PDF[/tpl] In the same year, together with MTR Corporation, the company was transformed from its previous non-profit making status to a profit making enterprise.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr06-07/english/sec/library/0607in08-e.pdf|title=Operation of the Octopus Card in Hong Kong|publisher=Legislative Council Secretariat|year=2007|accessdate=25 April 2007|format=PDF[/tpl]
Due to the expansion of the company's businesses, Octopus Holdings Limited was established in 2005 and Octopus Cards Limited was restructured as its subsidiary. The business of Octopus Cards Limited, being a payment business, is regulated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, while Octopus' non-payment businesses are not subjected to such regulation and are operated by other subsidiaries of Octopus Holdings Limited that are independent of Octopus Cards Limited. As of 2007, Octopus Holdings Limited was a joint-venture business owned by five transport companies in Hong Kong; 54.4% by the MTR Corporation, 22.1% by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, 12.4% by Kowloon Motor Bus, 5% by Citybus, and 3.1% by New World First Bus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/company/en/operators.jsp|title=The Joint Venture of Five Major Transport Operators|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|accessdate=15 April 2007[/tpl] Since the Government of Hong Kong owns 76.54% of the MTR Corporation (as of 31 December 2005) and wholly owns the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/investrelation/shareholder_services.php|title=Investors' Information|publisher=MTR Corporation|accessdate=15 April 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kcrc.com/html/eng/corporate/about_kcrc/history/index.asp|title=History|publisher=Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation|accessdate=15 April 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070403124553/http://www.kcrc.com/html/eng/corporate/about_kcrc/history/index.asp |archivedate = 3 April 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] it is the biggest effective shareholder of Octopus Holdings Limited, and thus also the biggest effective shareholder of Octopus Cards Limited.
Initially, Octopus Cards Limited, then known as Creative Star Limited, was restricted to having at most 15 percent of Octopus card transactions for non-transport transactions, as it operated under the Hong Kong government's Banking Ordinance. On 20 April 2000, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority authorised the company for deposit-taking, which allowed for 50 percent of Octopus card transactions to be unrelated to transport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr00-01/english/hc/papers/ls-1.pdf|title=Legal Service Division Reports on Subsidiary Legislation tabled in the Legislative Council from 7 June to 26 June and on 4 October 2000|publisher=Legislative Council of the HKSAR|page=36|date=4 October 2000|accessdate=16 April 2007|format=PDF[/tpl] HK$416 million (US$53.3 million) is deposited in the Octopus system at any given time as of 2000.[ref]

==Taxis==

Although a popular form of transport, taxis in Hong Kong do not accept the Octopus card. On 27 June 2006, after 10 years of negotiations between Octopus Cards Limited and the taxi industry, the first trial of taxis equipped with Octopus card readers was launched in the New Territories with taxis operated by the Yellow Taxi Group.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20060627.jsp|title=Octopus To Be Used In Hong Kong By First Batch of Taxis|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|date=27 June 2006|accessdate=29 April 2007[/tpl] But it was reported on 30 October that of the 20 taxis that participated in the trial, eight had dropped out. Part of the reason was technical—drivers must return to the office every day for accounting. The Octopus card company said it would be upgrading the system to allow automatic account updating in the future.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lifeofguangzhou.com/node_10/node_37/node_83/2006/10/31/116225881510438.shtml|title=Setback for Octopus Card Trial in Taxis in HK|publisher=Life of GuangZhou|date=30 October 2006|accessdate=29 April 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928200619/http://www.lifeofguangzhou.com/node_10/node_37/node_83/2006/10/31/116225881510438.shtml |archivedate = 28 September 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Wong Yu-ting, managing director of the Yellow Taxi Group, also noted that they had been "trying to convince restaurants and retailers" to offer discounts to Octopus taxi passengers, but the Transport Department had been a major obstacle. The Transport Department is against this approach for legal reasons.

==Alternative designs==

Other than the Octopus card itself, operator Octopus Cards Limited also sells watches and mobile phone covers that function as anonymous Octopus cards. The types of watches available include wrist watches, pocket watches, and watch key chains. The mobile phone covers were specifically designed for Nokia models 3310 and 3330, and iPhone 4 and 4S.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/products/other/en/index.jsp|title=Other Octopus Products|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=27 March 2007[/tpl] As with the card itself, these products are used by waving them over a card reader. They may be reloaded with money value the same way as the card itself, including automatic reloading via the Automatic Add Value Service, with the exception that they cannot be reloaded at Add Value Machines due to their shapes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopuscards.com/consumer/help/faq/en/other.jsp|title=FAQ: Other Octopus Products|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=27 March 2007[/tpl] An Octopus watch or mobile phone cover may be stored with a maximum of HK$1,000, but do not have any initial stored value at the time of its purchase. It may have a maximum negative value of HK$35 as with an Octopus card. These products are not refundable for their costs, but the remaining value stored on them may be refunded if they are damaged, with the damaged product itself also returned to the customer.
In June 2007, a new set of limited edition products was announced, featuring Mini Octopus cards and Child Octopus Wristbands. The Mini Octopus cards, available in Adult and Elder editions, measure 4.7 cm by 3 cm (1.85 in by 1.18 in) and work as regular (anonymous) Adult and Elder, respectively, Octopus cards. The Child Octopus Wristbands are plastic wristbands with a watch-like round face and work as regular Child Octopus cards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20070614.jsp|title=Mini Octopus|publisher=Octopus Cards Limited|accessdate=25 June 2007[/tpl] The same value-adding abilities and limitations as the aforementioned watches and mobile phone apply.
They also would cooperate with different companies. Octopus can be tailored to promotional needs with companies logo or special design. In 2008, Octopus has cooperate with Commercial Radio Hong Kong, launched a collection of "903 20 Plus Octopus".

==Outside Hong Kong==

Usage of the Octopus card was extended to the Chinese cities of Shenzhen and Macau in 2006. In collaboration with China UnionPay, Octopus Cards Limited introduced Octopus card usage to two Fairwood restaurants in Shenzhen in August 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20060814.jsp|title=Octopus Joins Forces with Fairwood and China UnionPay to Introduce Octopus to Shenzhen|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|date=14 August 2006|accessdate=1 May 2007[/tpl] In 2008, five Café de Coral locations in Shenzhen also started accepting Octopus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20080131.jsp|title=Octopus joins forces with China UnionPay and Café de Coral to Expand Octopus Payment Service in Shenzhen|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|date=31 January 2008|accessdate=3 February 2008[/tpl] Value cannot be reloaded to Octopus cards in Shenzhen, but the Automatic Add Value Service is available to automatically deduct money value from a customer's credit card to reload an Octopus card. The two Fairwood restaurants in Shenzhen that were enabled for Octopus card payments are located at Luohu Commercial City and Shenzhen Railway Station. Shenzhen became the first city outside Hong Kong in which Octopus cards may be accepted as payment. In Macau, the Octopus card was introduced in December 2006 when two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in the territory adopted its usage as payment. Similar to its usage in Shenzhen, an Octopus card may not be reloaded in Macau, and the currency exchange rate between the Macanese pataca and the Hong Kong dollar when using an Octopus card is MOP1:HKD1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.octopus.com.hk/release/detail/en/20061210.jsp|title=Octopus Extends to Macau with First Acceptance of Octopus Payments at KFC|publisher=Octopus Holdings Limited|date=10 December 2006|accessdate=1 May 2007[/tpl] The two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in Macau that adopted the Octopus card for payment are located at the Rua Do Campo and the Sands Casino.

==EPS add-value glitch==

In February 2007 it was found that when customers added value to their cards at self-service add-value points located in MTR and KCR stations, their bank accounts were debited even if the transactions had been cancelled.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/20070204/news_20070204_56_376306.htm|title=MTR and KCR Octopus EPS Add-Value Services suspended|publisher=RTHK News|date=4 February 2007|accessdate=27 July 2007[/tpl] Octopus Cards Limited claimed that the fault was due to an upgrade of communication systems. Initially, two cases were reported. The company then announced that the use of the payment system, Electronic Payment Services (EPS), at add-value service points would be suspended until further notice, and that it had started an investigation into the reasons for the problem.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gbcode.rthk.org.hk/gb/app2.rthk.org.hk/pda/news/content.php?id=379458|title=Octopus company ordered to submit auditor's report after complaints over EPS add-value losses|publisher=RTHK News|date=17 February 2007|accessdate=27 July 2007[/tpl]
On 27 July 2007 it was announced that the faulty transactions could be traced back to 2000, and that a total of 3.7 million Hong Kong dollars had been wrongly deducted in 15,270 cases. The company reported that there might be cases dating to before 2000, but that only transactions from the past seven years were kept. The company stated that it would co-operate with EPS Company Limited, operator of Electronic Payment Services, and banks, to contact customers involved and arrange a refund within ten weeks' time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/20070727/news_20070727_56_419225.htm|title= Octopus Card company to refund customers|publisher=RTHK News|date=27 July 2007|accessdate=27 July 2007[/tpl]
