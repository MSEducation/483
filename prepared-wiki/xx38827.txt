</ref> With the election of [[George H. W. Bush]], Scowcroft returned to the White House as National Security Adviser in 1989, and he asked Rice to become his Soviet expert on the [[United States National Security Council]]. According to [[R. Nicholas Burns]], President Bush was "captivated" by Rice, and relied heavily on her advice in his dealings with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[Boris Yeltsin]].<ref name = "Baker, 20080403"/>
Because she would have been ineligible for tenure at Stanford if she had been absent for more than two years, she returned there in 1991. She was taken under the wing of George P. Shultz (Ronald Reagan's Secretary of State from 1982â€“1989), who was a fellow at the Hoover Institution. Shultz included Rice in a "luncheon club" of intellectuals who met every few weeks to discuss foreign affairs. In 1992, Shultz, who was a board member of Chevron Corporation, recommended Rice for a spot on the Chevron board. Chevron was pursuing a $10 billion development project in Kazakhstan and, as a Soviet specialist, Rice knew the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev. She traveled to Kazakhstan on Chevron's behalf and, in honor of her work, in 1993, Chevron named a 129,000-ton supertanker SS Condoleezza Rice. During this period, Rice was also appointed to the boards of Transamerica Corporation (1991) and Hewlett-Packard (1992).
At Stanford, in 1992, Rice volunteered to serve on the search committee to replace outgoing president Donald Kennedy. The committee ultimately recommended Gerhard Casper, the Provost of the University of Chicago. Casper met Rice during this search, and was so impressed that in 1993, he appointed her as Stanford's Provost, the chief budget and academic officer of the university in 1993 and she also was granted tenure and became full professor.[tpl]cite news |title=Condoleezza Rice |url=http://www.forbes.com/2001/10/15/crice.html |publisher=Forbes |date=October 18, 2001 |accessdate=October 27, 2008[/tpl] Rice was the first female, first minority, and youngest Provost in Stanford history.[tpl]cite news |title=Condoleezza Rice: U.S. national security adviser |url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2002/black.history/stories/13.rice/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020223173824/http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2002/black.history/stories/13.rice/index.html|archivedate=Feb 23, 2002|publisher=CNN |date=February 2002 |accessdate=October 27, 2008[/tpl] She was also named a senior fellow of the Institute for International Studies, and a senior fellow (by courtesy) of the Hoover Institution.

===Provost promotion===

Former Stanford President Gerhard Casper said the university was "most fortunate in persuading someone of Professor Rice's exceptional talents and proven ability in critical situations to take on this task. Everything she has done, she has done well; I have every confidence that she will continue that record as provost."[tpl]cite press release |title=Casper selects Condoleezza Rice to be next Stanford provost |publisher=Stanford University |date=May 19, 1993 |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/93/930519Arc3267.html |accessdate=October 27, 2008[/tpl] Acknowledging Rice's unique character, Casper told the New Yorker in 2002 that it "would be disingenuous for me to say that the fact that she was a woman, the fact that she was black and the fact that she was young weren't in my mind."[tpl]cite news|date=October 14, 2002|publisher=New Yorker|title=Condoleezza Rice|page=181[/tpl]

===Balancing school budget===

As Stanford's Provost, Rice was responsible for managing the university's multi-billion dollar budget. The school at that time was running a deficit of $20 million. When Rice took office, she promised that the budget would be balanced within "two years." Coit Blacker, Stanford's deputy director of the Institute for International Studies, said there "was a sort of conventional wisdom that said it couldn't be done... that deficit was structural, that we just had to live with it." Two years later, Rice announced that the deficit had been eliminated and the university was holding a record surplus of over $14.5 million.[tpl]cite journal |last=Robinson |first=James |date=June 9, 1999 |title=Velvet-glove forcefulness: Seven years of provostial challenges and achievements |journal=Stanford Report |publisher=Stanford University |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/1999/june9/rice-69.html |accessdate=October 27, 2008[/tpl]

==Music==

Rice is an accomplished pianist and has performed in public since she was a young girl. At the age of 15, she played Mozart with the Denver Symphony, and while Secretary of State she played regularly with a chamber music group in Washington. She does not play professionally, but has performed at diplomatic events at embassies, including a performance for Queen Elizabeth II,Condoleezza Rice plays piano for the Queen, Daily Telegraph, December 1, 2008Rice performs recital for the Queen, BBC News, December 2, 2008 and she has performed in public with cellist Yo-Yo Ma and singer Aretha Franklin.Washington Post.

She has stated that her favorite composer is Johannes Brahms, because she thinks Brahms's music is "passionate but not sentimental." On a complementary note, on Friday, April 10, 2009 on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, she stated that her favorite band is Led Zeppelin.
As Secretary of State, Rice was ex officio a member of the Board of Trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. As the end of their tenures approached in January 2009, outgoing President Bush appointed her to a six-year term as a general trustee, filling a vacancy on the board.

==Private sector==

Rice headed Chevron's committee on public policy until she resigned on January 15, 2001, to become National Security Advisor to President George W. Bush. Chevron, for unspecified reasons, honored Rice by naming an oil tanker Condoleezza Rice after her, but controversy led to its being renamed Altair Voyager.[tpl]cite news |first=Carla |last=Marinucci |authorlink=Carla Marinucci |title=Chevron redubs ship named for Bush aide |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/05/05/MN223743.DTL |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=May 5, 2001 |accessdate=October 13, 2008[/tpl]
She also served on the board of directors for the Carnegie Corporation, the Charles Schwab Corporation, the Chevron Corporation, Hewlett Packard, the Rand Corporation, the Transamerica Corporation, and other organizations.
In 1992, Rice founded the Center for New Generation, an after-school program created to raise the high school graduation numbers of East Palo Alto and eastern Menlo Park, California.[tpl]cite news |title=Condoleezza Rice to visit program she started |url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/show_story.php?id=5083 |work=Palo Alto Online News |date=May 22, 2007 |accessdate=October 27, 2008[/tpl] After her tenure as secretary of state, Rice was approached in February 2009 to fill an open position as a Pac-10 Commissioner, but chose instead to return to Stanford University as a political science professor and the Thomas and Barbara Stephenson Senior Fellow on Public Policy at the Hoover Institution.

==Early political career==

In 1986, while an international affairs fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations, Rice served as Special Assistant to the Director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
From 1989 through March 1991 (the period of the fall of Berlin Wall and the final days of the Soviet Union), she served in President George H.W. Bush's administration as Director, and then Senior Director, of Soviet and East European Affairs in the National Security Council, and a Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. In this position, Rice helped develop Bush's and Secretary of State James Baker's policies in favor of German reunification. She impressed Bush, who later introduced her to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, as the one who "tells me everything I know about the Soviet Union."[tpl]cite news |first=Steve |last=Kettmann |authorlink=Steve Kettmann |title=Bush's secret weapon |url=http://archive.salon.com/politics2000/feature/2000/03/20/rice/index.html |work=Salon.com |date=May 20, 2000 |accessdate=November 3, 2008[/tpl]
In 1991, Rice returned to her teaching position at Stanford, although she continued to serve as a consultant on the former Soviet Bloc for numerous clients in both the public and private sectors. Late that year, California Governor Pete Wilson appointed her to a bipartisan committee that had been formed to draw new state legislative and congressional districts in the state.
In 1997, she sat on the Federal Advisory Committee on Gender-Integrated Training in the Military.
During George W. Bush's 2000 presidential election campaign, Rice took a one-year leave of absence from Stanford University to help work as his foreign policy advisor. The group of advisors she led called itself The Vulcans in honor of the monumental Vulcan statue, which sits on a hill overlooking her hometown of Birmingham, Alabama. Rice would later go on to give a noteworthy speech at the 2000 Republican National Convention. The speech asserted that "...America's armed forces are not a global police force. They are not the world's 911."[tpl]cite news |title=Exclusive Interview: Conversation with Terror |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,174550,00.html |work=Time |date=January 11, 1999 |accessdate=November 3, 2008[/tpl]

On January 18, 2003, the Washington Post reported that Rice was involved in crafting Bush's position on race-based preferences. Rice has stated that "while race-neutral means are preferable," race can be taken into account as "one factor among others" in university admissions policies.[tpl]cite news |title=Rice says race can be 'one factor' in considering admissions |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/01/17/rice.action/ |publisher=CNN |date=January 18, 2003 |accessdate=November 3, 2008[/tpl]

===Terrorism===

During the summer of 2001, Rice met with CIA Director George Tenet to discuss the possibilities and prevention of terrorist attacks on American targets. On July 10, 2001, Rice met with Tenet in what he referred to as an "emergency meeting"[tpl]cite news |first=Philip |last=Shenon |coauthors=Mark Mazzetti |title=Records Show Tenet Briefed Rice on Al Qaeda Threat |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/02/washington/03ricecnd.html |work=The New York Times |date=October 2, 2006 |accessdate=November 3, 2008[/tpl] held at the White House at Tenet's request to brief Rice and the NSC staff about the potential threat of an impending al Qaeda attack.

When asked in 2006 about the July 2001 meeting, Rice asserted she did not recall the specific meeting, commenting that she had met repeatedly with Tenet that summer about terrorist threats. Moreover, she stated that it was "incomprehensible" to her that she had ignored terrorist threats two months before the September 11 attacks.
In 2003, Rice received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.National Winners | public service awards. Jefferson Awards.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-17.

===Subpoenas===

In March 2004, Rice declined to testify before the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (the 9/11 Commission). The White House claimed executive privilege under constitutional separation of powers and cited past tradition. Under pressure, Bush agreed to allow her to testify[tpl]cite news |title=Transcript of Rice's 9/11 commission statement |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/08/rice.transcript/ |publisher=CNN |date=May 19, 2004 |accessdate=November 3, 2008[/tpl] so long as it did not create a precedent of presidential staff being required to appear before United States Congress when so requested. Her appearance before the commission on April 8, 2004, was accepted by the Bush administration in part because she was not appearing directly before Congress. She thus became the first sitting National Security Advisor to testify on matters of policy.
In April 2007, Rice rejected, on grounds of executive privilege, a House subpoena regarding the prewar claim that Iraq sought yellowcake uranium from Niger.[tpl]cite news |title=Rice says Saddam questions answered |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/apr/26/20070426-120513-8451r/ |work=The Washington Times |date=April 26, 2007 |accessdate=November 3, 2008[/tpl]

===Iraq===

Rice was a proponent of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. After Iraq delivered its declaration of weapons of mass destruction to the United Nations on December 8, 2002, Rice wrote an editorial for The New York Times entitled "Why We Know Iraq Is Lying".[tpl]cite news |first=Condoleezza |last=Rice |title=Why We Know Iraq Is Lying |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E5DF1E30F930A15752C0A9659C8B63 |work=The New York Times |date=January 23, 2003 |accessdate=November 3, 2008[/tpl]  In a January 10, 2003, interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Rice made headlines by stating regarding Iraqi president Saddam Hussein's nuclear capabilities: "The problem here is that there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he can acquire nuclear weapons.

Leading up to the 2004 presidential election, Rice became the first National Security Advisor to campaign for an incumbent president. She stated that while: "Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with the actual attacks on America, Saddam Hussein's Iraq was a part of the Middle East that was festering and unstable, and was part of the circumstances that created the problem on September 11."[tpl]cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Rice defends decision to go to war in Iraq |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/22/rice.speech.ap/ |publisher=CNN |date=October 22, 2004 |accessdate=November 3, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041117054631/http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/22/rice.speech.ap/ |archivedate=November 17, 2004[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot[/tpl]

===Role in authorizing use of controversial interrogation techniques===

A Senate Intelligence Committee reported that on July 17, 2002, Rice met with CIA director George Tenet to personally convey the Bush administration's approval of the proposed waterboarding of alleged Al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah.

In 2003 Rice, Vice President Dick Cheney and Attorney General John Ashcroft met with the CIA again and were briefed on the use of waterboarding and other methods including week-long sleep deprivation, forced nudity and the use of stress positions. The Senate report says that the Bush administration officials "reaffirmed that the CIA program was lawful and reflected administration policy".
The Senate report also "suggests Miss Rice played a more significant role than she acknowledged in written testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee submitted in the autumn." At that time, she had acknowledged attending meetings to discuss the CIA interrogations, but she claimed that she could not recall the details, and she "omitted her direct role in approving the programme in her written statement to the committee."[tpl]cite news| last = Associated Press| title = As Bush Adviser, Rice Gave OK to Waterboard| publisher = Fox News| date = April 22, 2009| url = http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/22/bush-adviser-rice-gave-ok-waterboard/| accessdate = May 8, 2009[/tpl]
In a conversation with a student at Stanford University in April 2009, Rice stated that she did not authorize the CIA to use the enhanced interrogation techniques. Rice said, "I didn't authorize anything. I conveyed the authorization of the administration to the agency that they had policy authorization, subject to the Justice Department's clearance. That's what I did."Kessler, Glenn, "Rice Defends Use Of Enhanced Techniques", Washington Post, May 1, 2009, p. 4. She added, â€œWe were told, nothing that violates our obligations under the Convention Against Torture. And so, by definition, if it was authorized by the president, it did not violate our obligations under the Conventions Against Torture."

==Secretary of State (2005â€“2009)==

On November 16, 2004, Bush nominated Rice to be Secretary of State. On January 26, 2005, the Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 85â€“13.[tpl]cite web|author=Associated Press|title=Rice sworn in as secretary of state|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6862922/ns/politics/t/rice-sworn-secretary-state/|work=NBCNews.com|accessdate=January 29, 2013[/tpl]  The negative votes, the most cast against any nomination for Secretary of State since 1825, came from Senators who, according to Senator Barbara Boxer, wanted "to hold Dr. Rice and the Bush administration accountable for their failures in Iraq and in the war on terrorism."[tpl]cite web|author=Boxer, Barbara|title=This is just the beginning|url=http://www.barbaraboxer.com/diary?id=0012|publisher=PAC for a Change|accessdate=January 29, 2013|date=January 27, 2005[/tpl]  Their reasoning was that Rice had acted irresponsibly in equating Saddam's regime with Islamist terrorism and some could not accept her previous record. Senator Robert Byrd voted against Rice's appointment, indicating that she "has asserted that the President holds far more of the war power than the Constitution grants him."[tpl]cite press release |title=Standing for the Founding Principles of the Republic: Voting No on the Nomination of Dr. Rice as Secretary of State |publisher=Robert Byrd |date=January 25, 2005 |url=http://byrd.senate.gov/speeches/byrd_speeches_2005_january/byrd_speeches_2005_january_lis/byrd_speeches_2005_january_lis_0.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409005135/http://byrd.senate.gov/speeches/byrd_speeches_2005_january/byrd_speeches_2005_january_lis/byrd_speeches_2005_january_lis_0.html|archivedate=April 9, 2010[/tpl]
As Secretary of State, Rice championed the expansion of democratic governments.

After the end of the Bush Administration, Rice returned to academia and joined the Council on Foreign Relations.Council on Foreign Relations Roster
She appeared as herself in 2011 on the NBC sitcom 30 Rock in the fifth-season episode "Everything Sunny All the Time Always," in which she engages in a classical-music duel with Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin). Fictionally, Donaghy had had a relationship with Rice at an unspecified point in the past.

===Speculation on 2008 presidential campaign, views on successor===

There had been previous speculation that Rice would run for the Republican nomination in the 2008 primaries, which she ruled out on Meet the Press. On February 22, 2008, Rice played down any suggestion that she may be on the Republican vice presidential ticket, saying, "I have always said that the one thing that I have not seen myself doing is running for elected office in the United States."[tpl]cite news |title=Rice says has no plan to run for vice president |date=February 22, 2008 |work=Reuters |accessdate=March 28, 2008 |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2262518020080222?feedType=RSS&feedName=politicsNews&rpc=22&sp=true |quote=I have always said that the one thing that I have not seen myself doing is running for elected office.

Republican strategist Dan Senor said on ABC's This Week on April 6, 2008, that "Condi Rice has been actively, actually in recent weeks, campaigning for" the vice presidential nomination. He based this assessment on her attendance of Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform conservative leader's meeting on March 26, 2008.[tpl]cite news |title=Dan Senor: Condoleezza Rice Is Pursuing the VP Spot |work=ABC News |date=April 6, 2008 |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/04/dan-senor-condo.html [/tpl] In response to Senor's comments, Rice's spokesperson denied that Rice is seeking the vice presidential nomination, saying, "If she is actively seeking the vice presidency, then she's the last one to know about it."[tpl]cite news |first=Glenn |last=Kessler |authorlink=Glenn Kessler (journalist) |title=Rice: Still Not Running for VP |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/44/2008/04/07/rice_still_not_running_for_vp.html |work=The Washington Post |date=April 7, 2008 |accessdate=November 3, 2008 |quote=McCormack dismissed both as perfectly ordinary.

In August 2008, the speculation about a potential McCain-Rice ticket finally ended when then-Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska was selected as McCain's running-mate.
In early December 2008, Rice praised President-elect Barack Obama's selection of New York Senator Hillary Clinton to succeed her as Secretary of State, saying "she's terrific". Rice, who has spoken to Clinton since her selection, said Clinton "is someone of intelligence and she'll do a great job".[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2008/12/rice-on-hillary.html|title=Rice on Hillary: 'She's Terrific'|publisher=ABC News|first=George|last=Stephanopoulos|date=December 7, 2008|accessdate=December 7, 2008[/tpl]

==Political positions==

===Terrorist activity===

Rice's policy as Secretary of State viewed counter-terrorism as a matter of being preventative, and not merely punitive. In an interview on December 18, 2005, Rice stated: "We have to remember that in this war on terrorism, we're not talking about criminal activity where you can allow somebody to commit the crime and then you go back and you arrest them and you question them. If they succeed in committing their crime, then hundreds or indeed thousands of people die. That's why you have to prevent, and intelligence is the long pole in the tent in preventing attacks."U.S. State Department Interview on Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace[tpl]Dead link|date=March 2010[/tpl]. December 18, 2005.
Rice has also been a frequent critic of the intelligence community's inability to cooperate and share information, which she believes is an integral part of preventing terrorism. In 2000, one year after Osama bin Laden told Time â€œhostility toward America is a religious duty," and a year before the September 11 terrorist attacks, Rice warned on
WJR Detroit: "You really have to get the intelligence agencies better organized to deal with the terrorist threat to the United States itself. One of the problems that we have is a kind of split responsibility, of course, between the CIA and foreign intelligence and the FBI and domestic intelligence." She then added: "There needs to be better cooperation because we don't want to wake up one day and find out that Osama bin Laden has been successful on our own territory."Rice Quotes Contradict Clarke Account. NewsMax. March 24, 2004.
Rice also has promoted the idea that counterterrorism involves not only confronting the governments and organizations that promote and condone terrorism, but also the ideologies that fuel terrorism. In a speech given on July 29, 2005, Rice asserted that "securing America from terrorist attack is more than a matter of law enforcement. We must also confront the ideology of hatred in foreign societies by supporting the universal hope of liberty and the inherent appeal of democracy."U.S. State Department Remarks With Senator Richard Lugar on the U.S. Department of State and the Challenges of the 21st century July 29, 2005. Retrieved June 26, 2012.
In January 2005, during Bush's second inaugural ceremonies, Rice first used the term "outposts of tyranny" to refer to countries felt to threaten world peace and human rights. This term has been called a descendant of Bush's phrase, "Axis of Evil", used to describe Iraq, Iran and North Korea. She identified six such "outposts" in which she said the United States has a duty to foster freedom: Cuba, Zimbabwe, Burma and Belarus, as well as Iran and North Korea.

===Abortion===

Rice said "If you go back to 2000 when I helped the president in the campaign. I said that I was, in effect, kind of libertarian on this issue. And meaning by that, that I have been concerned about a government role in this issue. I am a strong proponent of parental choiceâ€”of parental notification. I am a strong proponent of a ban on late-term abortion. These are all things that I think unite people and I think that that's where we should be. I've called myself at times mildly pro-choice."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30282-2005Mar12.html |title=Washington Post, March 2005 |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=March 13, 2005 |accessdate=May 27, 2009 | first=Mike | last=Allen[/tpl] She would not want the federal government "forcing its views on one side or the other."2008 run, abortion engage her politically Washington Post, March 2005
Rice said she believes President Bush "has been in exactly the right place" on abortion, "which is we have to respect the culture of life and we have to try and bring people to have respect for it and make this as rare a circumstance as possible" However, she added that she has been "concerned about a government role" but has "tended to agree with those who do not favor federal funding for abortion, because I believe that those who hold a strong moral view on the other side should not be forced to fund" the procedure.

==Discrimination==

Rice experienced firsthand the injustices of Birmingham's discriminatory laws and attitudes. She was instructed to walk proudly in public and to use the facilities at home rather than subject herself to the indignity of "colored" facilities in town. As Rice recalls of her parents and their peers, "they refused to allow the limits and injustices of their time to limit our horizons.""Birmingham native Condoleezza Rice confirmation vote delayed as next U.S. Secretary of State" Birmingham Times January 20, 2005.
However, Rice recalls various times in which she suffered discrimination on account of her race, which included being relegated to a storage room at a department store instead of a regular dressing room, being barred from going to the circus or the local amusement park, being denied hotel rooms, and even being given bad food at restaurants.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/people/shows/rice/timeline.html|title=CNN Programs: People in the News|accessdate=June 25, 2010[/tpl] Also, while Rice was mostly kept by her parents from areas where she might face discrimination, she was very aware of the civil rights struggle and the problems of Jim Crow laws in Birmingham. A neighbor, Juliemma Smith, described how "Condi used to call me and say things like, 'Did you see what Bull Connor did today?' She was just a little girl and she did that all the time. I would have to read the newspaper thoroughly because I wouldn't know what she was going to talk about." Rice herself said of the segregation era: "Those terrible events burned into my consciousness. I missed many days at my segregated school because of the frequent bomb threats."
During the violent days of the Civil Rights Movement, Reverend Rice armed himself and kept guard over the house while Condoleezza practiced the piano inside. According to J. L.

===Time and Forbes magazines===

Rice has appeared four times on the Time 100, Time magazine's list of the world's 100 most influential people. Rice is one of only nine people in the world whose influence has been considered enduring enough to have made the listâ€”first compiled in 1999 as a retrospective of the 20th century and made an annual feature in 2004â€”so frequently. However, the list contains people who have the influence to change for better or for worse, and Time has also accused her of squandering her influence, stating on February 1, 2007, that her "accomplishments as Secretary of State have been modest, and even those have begun to fade" and that she "has been slow to recognize the extent to which the U.S.'s prestige has declined.""Rice's Toughest Mission", Time, February 1, 2007.

===Criticism from Senator Barbara Boxer===

California Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer has also criticized Rice in relation to the war in Iraq: "I personally believeâ€”this is my personal viewâ€”that your loyalty to the mission you were given, to sell the war, overwhelmed your respect for the truth.""Why the Crass Remarks About Rice?". The Washington Post, January 22, 2005.
On January 11, 2007, Boxer, in a debate over the war in Iraq, said, "Now, the issue is who pays the price, who pays the price? I'm not going to pay a personal price. My kids are too old, and my grandchild is too young. You're not going to pay a particular price, as I understand it, within immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families, and I just want to bring us back to that fact."
The New York Post and White House Press Secretary Tony Snow called Boxer's statement an attack on Rice's status as a single, childless female and referred to Boxer's comments as "a great leap backward for feminism.""White House Spokesman Blasts Sen. Boxer's Exchange With Secretary Rice", Fox News, January 13, 2007. Rice later echoed Snow's remarks, saying "I thought it was okay to not have children, and I thought you could still make good decisions on behalf of the country if you were single and didn't have children." Boxer responded to the controversy by saying "They're getting this off on a non-existent thing that I didn't say. I'm saying, she's like me, we do not have families who are in the military.""Exchange Turns Into Political Flashpoint", The New York Times, January 12, 2007

===Conservative criticism===

According to the Washington Post in late July 2008, former Undersecretary of State and U.N. Ambassador John R. Bolton was referring to Rice and her allies in the Bush Administration whom he believes have abandoned earlier hard-line principles when he said: "Once the collapse begins, adversaries have a real opportunity to gain advantage. In terms of the Bush presidency, this many reversals this close to the end destroys credibility... It appears there is no depth to which this administration will not sink in its last days."[ref]
</ref>
Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld repeatedly criticized Rice after their terms in office ended. In his book Known and Unknown: A Memoir, he portrayed her as a young, inexperienced academic who didnâ€™t know her place. In 2011 she finally responded, saying that Rumsfeld "Doesn't know what he's talking about."
In his book In My Time, Dick Cheney suggested that Rice had misled the president about nuclear diplomacy with North Korea, saying she was naÃ¯ve. He called her advice on the issue â€œutterly misleading."
He also chided Rice for clashing with White House advisers on the tone of the president's speeches on Iraq and said that she, as the Secretary of State, ruefully conceded to him that the Bush administration should not have apologized for a claim the president made in his 2003 State of the Union address, on Saddam's supposed search for yellowcake uranium. She â€œcame into my office, sat down in the chair next to my desk, and tearfully admitted I had been right," Cheney wrote.
Rice responded: "It certainly doesn't sound like me, now, does it?", saying that she viewed the book as an â€œattack on my integrity."http://www.csmonitor.com, September 1, 2011, Condi Rice fires back at Dick Cheney by Husna Haq, http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2011/0901/Condi-Rice-fires-back-at-Dick-Cheney

===Views within the black community===

Rice's ratings decreased following a heated battle for her confirmation as Secretary of State and following Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. Rice's rise within the George W. Bush administration initially drew a largely positive response from many in the black community. In a 2002 survey, then National Security Advisor Rice was viewed favorably by 41% of black respondents, but another 40% did not know Rice well enough to rate her and her profile remained comparatively obscure.Jonathon Tilove. For Black America, The Thrill of Powell and Rice Is Gone. Newhouse News Service, March 11, 2004. Retrieved June 26, 2011. As her role increased, some black commentators began to express doubts concerning Rice's stances and statements on various issues. In 2005, liberal Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson asked, "How did Rice come to a worldview so radically different from that of most black Americans?"Eugene Robinson. What Rice Can't See. The Washington Post, October 25, 2005.
Other writers have also noted what they perceive to be a distance between Rice and the black community. The Black Commentator magazine described sentiments given in a speech by Rice at a black gathering as "more than strangeâ€”they were evidence of profound personal disorientation. A black woman who doesn't know how to talk to black people is of limited political use to an administration that has few black allies."Condoleezza's Crimes. The Black Commentator, April 1, 2004. When Rice invoked the civil rights movement to clarify her position on the invasion of Iraq, Margaret Kimberley, another writer for The Black Commentator, felt that her use of the rhetoric was "offensive." Stan Correy, an interviewer from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, characterized many blacks involved with civil rights and politics as viewing this rhetoric as "cynical."Stan Correy. Condoleezza, Condoleezza. ABC Radio National, April 3, 2005. Rice was also described by Bill Fletcher, Jr., the former leader of the TransAfrica Forum, a foreign policy lobbying organization in Washington, D.C., as "very cold and distant and only black by accident." In August 2005, American musician, actor, and social activist Harry Belafonte, who serves on the Board of TransAfrica, referred to blacks in the Bush administration as "black tyrants."Marc Merano.
