===Scotland===

Scotland emerged as a prominent economic power during the Scottish Enlightenment of the 18th century.  This era established a great herring fishing industry resulting in Scotland becoming a European leader in that industry.

==19th century==

During the First Schleswig War (1848–51), the  Crimean War (1854–56) and the Second Schleswig War (1864), belligerents took steps to reduce or eliminate commerce in the North Sea by their enemies.   In the first Schleswig War, Denmark was able to halt maritime commerce by Germany in the North Sea and in the second, imposed tolls on ships crossing through the Danish straits between the Baltic and North Seas. The Crimean War saw British and French expeditions sent into the Baltic to prevent Russian ships' egress into the North Sea though they saw little action.
The Austro-Prussian War (1866) resulted in Prussia's gaining full control of the Kiel Canal, allowing their Baltic ports access to the North Sea.
France declared war on Prussia 19 July 1870 which initiated the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871).  The French Navy was, at the time far larger and superior to the Norddeutsche Bundesmarine, the Navy of the North German Confederation.  Though the French did take a number of merchant ships bound to and from North Germany, shortages of manpower and coal, as well as conflicting orders, made the attempted blockade of Prussian ports ineffective.  The French had planned a seaborne assault on the North Sea coast in order to relieve expected pressure on the front in Alsace and Lorraine.  However, this coast, which was difficult to navigate to begin with, had been heavily fortified before the war.[tpl]cite book|last=Wawro|first=Geoffrey|title=The Franco-Prussian War: The German Conquest of France 1870-1871|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|pages=190–192.[/tpl]  The ironclads of this time consisted of broadside turret and the new casemate ironclads which protected the revolving turret.
A convention passed in November 1887 came to the aid of fishermen of the North Sea.  This law restricted liquor traffic from bum boats. The island of Heligoland was ceded to Germany 1890 when the United Kingdom and Germany signed the Treaty of Heligoland.  The Cod War of 1893 erupted between Denmark and Britain over fishing territories.  Denmark declared a fishing territory of 13 nautical miles (24 km) around their shores which included Iceland and the Faroe Islands.  Britain did not acknowledge this claim.

==20th century==

===The Dogger Bank Incident===

Tensions in the North Sea were again heightened in 1904 by the Dogger Bank incident, in which Russian naval vessels mistook British fishing boats for Japanese ships and fired on them, and then upon each other.  The incident, combined with Britain's alliance with Japan and the Russo-Japanese War led to an intense diplomatic crisis.  The crisis was defused when Russia was defeated by the Japanese and agreed to pay compensation to the fishermen.[ref]

===The First World War===

Main articles: World War I and Naval Warfare of World War I
During the First World War, Great Britain's Grand Fleet based at Scapa Flow and Germany's Kaiserliche Marine faced each other across the North Sea.
Due to its numerical advantage in dreadnoughts, the Grand Fleet obtained Naval superiority and was able to establish a sea blockade of Germany's coast.  The goal of the blockade was to deny Germany access to maritime trade including war materials and to guarantee the undisturbed ferrying of British troops.  Because of the strong defensive fortress of Heligoland, the Germans controlled the German Bight, while the rest of the North Sea and the English Channel were controlled by the Royal Navy for the duration of the war. left|thumb|upright|The German Cruiser SMS Blücher sinks in the Battle of Dogger Bank on 25 January 1915. 
6 August 1914 saw the start of the German U-boat Campaign - two days after the United Kingdom declared war on Germany over the German invasion of Belgium, ten German U-boats left their base in Heligoland to attack Royal Navy warships in the North Sea.
The first sea battle, the Battle of Heligoland Bight took place on 28 August 1914 and ended in a clear British victory.  Because of British surface naval superiority, the Germans initiated submarine warfare.  After several failures, the German submarine [tpl]SMU|U-9[/tpl] succeeded in sinking three British armored cruisers about [tpl]convert|50|km|nmi[/tpl] north of Hoek van Holland, near the North Sea entrance to the English Channel.

This ended British complacency about submarines.
In November 1914, the British declared the entire North Sea a war zone and from there on out it was mined.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Ships that sailed the North Sea under the flags of neutral countries without giving the British prior warning could be the target of British attack. right|thumb|upright|The German battlecruiser SMS Seydlitz, took part in the battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland of World War I, scuttled at Scapa Flow, 1919
In the Battle of Dogger Bank (1915), the Germans suffered another defeat on the 24 January 1915 and in the aftermath, all attempts to break the allied blockade failed.  Due to these failures, on 4 February 1915, the Germans initiated unrestricted submarine warfare, in which, in addition to enemy ships, all neutral ships could be attacked.
On 31 May and 1 June 1916, the Battle of Jutland, if measured by the number of participating ships (238), the largest naval battle in world history took place.  The German goal of significantly weakening the British Navy by sinking a large part of it and ending the blockade was not achieved.  Although the Germans won a tactical victory, their main fleet narrowly escaped destruction and they once again laid their hopes on the unrestricted submarine warfare.[ref]

As the war was ending and contrary to the wishes of the new German regime, a final attack on the British Navy on 28 October 1918 was ordered. However, the outbreak of the Wilhelmshaven mutiny  in Kiel ended the naval war.  The mutiny was also a crucial step in the initiation of the November Revolution.

===The Second World War===

The Second World War was, in terms of naval warfare, again mostly a submarine war on the German side.  However, this time the main action was not in the North Sea but rather the Atlantic.  Also different from the first war, the North Sea was no longer the exclusive territory of the Allies.  Rather, it was, above all in the first years of the war, the stage for an intensive coastal war, featuring mainly small vessels like submarines, minesweepers, and Fast Attack Craft.[ref]
</ref>  However, despite early successes, which brought about a supply crisis in Britain, the Germans did not succeed in breaking the British resistance.   Like in the first war, the allies soon controlled the seas, especially due to air superiority and cut Germany off from supplies coming overseas.
On 14 October 1939, Korvettenkapitän Günther Prien of [tpl]GS|U-47|1938|2[/tpl] managed to sink the warship [tpl]HMS|Royal Oak|08|6[/tpl] in the Scapa Flow with 1400 men aboard.
On 9 April 1940 the Germans initiated Operation Weserübung in which almost the entire German fleet was focused north toward Scandinavia. The military objectives of the operation were soon achieved (occupation of Norwegian ports, securing of iron supply, and the prevention of a northern front) and Norway and Denmark.[ref]
