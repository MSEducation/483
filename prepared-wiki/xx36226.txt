Before the Kommunalreformen ("The Municipality Reform" of 2007), Aabybro Municipality was a municipality (Danish, kommune) in North Jutland County on the island of Vendsyssel-Thy, part of the Jutland peninsula, in northern Denmark.  The municipality included several small islands in the Limfjord, the waterway that separates the main body of the Jutland peninsula from the island of Vendsyssel-Thy, including Tagholme. Because Aabybro municipality was located on the north shore of the Limfjord, its southern neighbor Aalborg, which is partially located on the Jutland mainland, is partly separated from Aabybro by water. The waters in this area are called Gjøl Bredning.  The cove Vejlen helps to define part of its southern border.
The Aabybro Municipality covered an area of 171 km², and had a total population of 11,388 (2005).  Its latest mayor was Ole Lykkegaard Andersen, a member of the Venstre (Liberal Party) political party.
The main town and the site of its municipal council was the town of Aabybro.
On January 1, 2007 Aabybro municipality was merged with existing Brovst, Fjerritslev, and Pandrup municipalities to form the new Jammerbugt municipality.  This created a municipality with an area of 863 km² and a total population of 38,864 (2005).  The new municipality will belong to the new Region Nordjylland ("North Jutland Region").
