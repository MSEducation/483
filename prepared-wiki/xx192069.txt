==Features==

As well as convenient, accessible credit, credit cards offer consumers an easy way to track expenses, which is necessary for both monitoring personal expenditures and the tracking of work-related expenses for taxation and reimbursement purposes. Credit cards are accepted worldwide, and are available with a large variety of credit limits, repayment arrangement, and other perks (such as insurance protection, rewards schemes in which points earned by purchasing goods with the card can be redeemed for further goods and services or cashback).
Some countries, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, limit the amount for which a consumer can be held liable due to fraudulent transactions as a result of a consumer's credit card being lost or stolen.

==Security problems and solutions==

Credit card security relies on the physical security of the plastic card as well as the privacy of the credit card number. Therefore, whenever a person other than the card owner has access to the card or its number, security is potentially compromised. Once, merchants would often accept credit card numbers without additional verification for mail order purchases. It's now common practice to only ship to confirmed addresses as a security measure to minimise fraudulent purchases. Some merchants will accept a credit card number for in-store purchases, whereupon access to the number allows easy fraud, but many require the card itself to be present, and require a signature. A lost or stolen card can be cancelled, and if this is done quickly, will greatly limit the fraud that can take place in this way. European banks can require a cardholder's security PIN be entered for in-person purchases with the card.
The PCI DSS is the security standard issued by The PCI SSC (Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council). This data security standard is used by acquiring banks to impose cardholder data security measures upon their merchants.
The goal of the credit card companies is not to eliminate fraud, but to "reduce it to manageable levels".Thrive Business Solutions, http://www.thrivesolution.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=28&Itemid=33 This implies that high-cost low-return fraud prevention measures will not be used if their cost exceeds the potential gains from fraud reduction – as would be expected from organisations whose goal is profit maximisation.
Internet fraud may be by claiming a chargeback which is not justified ("friendly fraud"), or carried out by the use of credit card information which can be stolen in many ways, the simplest being copying information from retailers, either online or offline. Despite efforts to improve security for remote purchases using credit cards, security breaches are usually the result of poor practice by merchants. For example, a website that safely uses SSL to encrypt card data from a client may then email the data, unencrypted, from the webserver to the merchant; or the merchant may store unencrypted details in a way that allows them to be accessed over the Internet or by a rogue employee; unencrypted card details are always a security risk. Even encryption data may be cracked.
Controlled Payment Numbers which are used by various banks such as Citibank (Virtual Account Numbers), Discover (Secure Online Account Numbers, Bank of America (Shop Safe), 5 banks using eCarte Bleue and CMB's Virtualis in France, most banks using MBNET from SIBS in Portugal and Swedbank of Sweden's eKort product are another option for protecting against credit card fraud. These are generally one-time use numbers that front one's actual account (debit/credit) number, and are generated as one shops on-line.  They can be valid for a relatively short time, for the actual amount of the purchase, or for a price limit set by the user.  Their use can be limited to one merchant. If the number given to the merchant is compromised, it will be rejected if an attempt is made to use it again.
A similar system of controls can be used on physical cards. Technology provides the option for banks to support many other controls too that can be turned on and off and varied by the credit card owner in real time as circumstances change (i.e., they can change temporal, numerical, geographical and many other parameters on their primary and subsidiary cards). Apart from the obvious benefits of such controls: from a security perspective this means that a customer can have a Chip and PIN card secured for the real world, and limited for use in the home country. In this eventuality a thief stealing the details will be prevented from using these overseas in non chip and pin EMV countries. Similarly the real card can be restricted from use on-line so that stolen details will be declined if this tried. Then when card users shop online they can use virtual account numbers. In both circumstances an alert system can be built in notifying a user that a fraudulent attempt has been made which breaches their parameters, and can provide data on this in real time. This is the optimal method of security for credit cards, as it provides very high levels of security, control and awareness in the real and virtual world.
Additionally, there are security features present on the physical card itself in order to prevent counterfeiting. For example, most modern credit cards have a watermark that will fluoresce under ultraviolet light. Most major credit cards have a hologram. A Visa card has a letter V superimposed over the regular Visa logo and a MasterCard has the letters MC across the front of the card. Older Visa cards have a bald eagle or dove across the front. In the aforementioned cases, the security features are only visible under ultraviolet light and are invisible in normal light.
The United States Secret Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and U.S. Postal Inspection Service are responsible for prosecuting criminals who engage in credit card fraud in the United States,[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] but they do not have the resources to pursue all criminals. In general, federal officials only prosecute cases exceeding $5,000. Three improvements to card security have been introduced to the more common credit card networks but none has proven to help reduce credit card fraud so far. First, the on-line verification system used by merchants is being enhanced to require a 4 digit Personal Identification Number (PIN) known only to the card holder. Second, the cards themselves are being replaced with similar-looking tamper-resistant smart cards which are intended to make forgery more difficult. The majority of smart card (IC card) based credit cards comply with the EMV (Europay MasterCard Visa) standard. Third, an additional 3 or 4 digit Card Security Code (CSC) is now present on the back of most cards, for use in card not present transactions. Stakeholders at all levels in electronic payment have recognized the need to develop consistent global standards for security that account for and integrate both current and emerging security technologies.  They have begun to address these needs through organizations such as PCI DSS and the Secure POS Vendor Alliance.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Secure POS Vendor Alliance is launched by Hypercom, Ingenico and VeriFone|url=http://www.ecommerce-journal.com/news/14854_secure_pos_vendor_alliance_is_launched_by_hypercom_ingenico_and_verifone|publisher=ECommerce Journal|year=2009|postscript=[/tpl]

===Code 10===

Code 10 calls are made when merchants are suspicious about accepting a credit card.
The operator then asks the merchant a series of YES or NO questions to find out whether the merchant is suspicious of the card or the cardholder. The merchant may be asked to retain the card if it is safe to do so. The merchant may receive a reward for returning a confiscated card to the issuing bank, especially if an arrest is made.[tpl]cite web|url=http://usa.visa.com/merchants/risk_management/code.html|title=Code 10|accessdate=2012-11-28|publisher=Visa Inc.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mastercard.com/uk/merchant/en/security/datasecurityrules/card_id_sec_features.html|title=MasterCard Card Identification Features|accessdate=2012-11-28|publisher=Mastercard[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.discovernetwork.com/common/pdf/CARD_ID_FEATURES_MERCHANT.pdf|title=CARD_ID_FEATURES_MERCHANT.PDF|accessdate=2012-11-28|publisher=Discover Card[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.umsbanking.com/pdfs/AmericanExpress_AcceptanceProcedures.pdf|title=American Express Fraud Prevention Handbook|accessdate=2012-11-28|publisher=American Express[/tpl]

==Profits and losses==

In recent times, credit card portfolios have been very profitable for banks, largely due to the booming economy of the late 1990s. However, in the case of credit cards, such high returns go hand in hand with risk, since the business is essentially one of making unsecured (uncollateralized) loans, and thus dependent on borrowers not to default in large numbers.

==Costs==

Credit card issuers (banks) have several types of costs:

===Interest expenses===

Banks generally borrow the money they then lend to their customers. As they receive very low-interest loans from other firms, they may borrow as much as their customers require, while lending their capital to other borrowers at higher rates. If the card issuer charges 15% on money lent to users, and it costs 5% to borrow the money to lend, and the balance sits with the cardholder for a year, the issuer earns 10% on the loan. This 10% difference is the "net interest spread" and the 5% is the "interest expense".

===Operating costs===

This is the cost of running the credit card portfolio, including everything from paying the executives who run the company to printing the plastics, to mailing the statements, to running the computers that keep track of every cardholder's balance, to taking the many phone calls which cardholders place to their issuer, to protecting the customers from fraud rings. Depending on the issuer, marketing programs are also a significant portion of expenses.

===Charge offs===

When a consumer becomes severely delinquent on a debt (often at the point of six months without payment), the creditor may declare the debt to be a charge-off. It will then be listed as such on the debtor's credit bureau reports (Equifax, for instance, lists "R9" in the "status" column to denote a charge-off.)
A charge-off is considered to be "written off as uncollectable." To banks, bad debts and even fraud are simply part of the cost of doing business.
However, the debt is still legally valid, and the creditor can attempt to collect the full amount for the time periods permitted under state law, which is usually 3 to 7 years. This includes contacts from internal collections staff, or more likely, an outside collection agency. If the amount is large (generally over $1,500–2,000), there is the possibility of a lawsuit or arbitration.

===Rewards===

Many credit card customers receive rewards, such as frequent flyer points, gift certificates, or cash back as an incentive to use the card.  Rewards are generally tied to purchasing an item or service on the card, which may or may not include balance transfers, cash advances, or other special uses.  Depending on the type of card, rewards will generally cost the issuer between 0.25% and 2.0% of the spread.  Networks such as Visa or MasterCard have increased their fees to allow issuers to fund their rewards system. Some issuers discourage redemption by forcing the cardholder to call customer service for rewards.  On their servicing website, redeeming awards is usually a feature that is very well hidden by the issuers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] With a fractured and competitive environment, rewards points cut dramatically into an issuer's bottom line, and rewards points and related incentives must be carefully managed to ensure a profitable portfolio. Unlike unused gift cards, in whose case the breakage in certain US states goes to the state's treasury, unredeemed credit card points are retained by the issuer.

===Fraud===

In relative numbers the values lost in bank card fraud are minor, calculated in 2006 at 7 cents per 100 dollars worth of transactions (7 basis points).Credit Card Issuer Fraud Management, Report Highlights, December, 2008[tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl] In 2004, in the UK, the cost of fraud was over £500 million.Plastic fraud loss on UK-issued cards 2004/2005. Cardwatch.org.uk. site retrieved 7 July 2006
When a card is stolen, or an unauthorized duplicate made, most card issuers will refund some or all of the charges that the customer has received for things they did not buy. These refunds will, in some cases, be at the expense of the merchant, especially in mail order cases where the merchant cannot claim sight of the card. In several countries, merchants will lose the money if no ID card was asked for, therefore merchants usually require ID card in these countries. Credit card companies generally guarantee the merchant will be paid on legitimate transactions regardless of whether the consumer pays their credit card bill.
Most banking services have their own credit card services that handle fraud cases and monitor for any possible attempt at fraud. Employees that are specialized in doing fraud monitoring and investigation are often placed in Risk Management, Fraud and Authorization, or Cards and Unsecured Business. Fraud monitoring emphasizes minimizing fraud losses while making an attempt to track down those responsible and contain the situation. Credit card fraud is a major white collar crime that has been around for many decades, even with the advent of the chip based card (EMV) that was put into practice in some countries to prevent cases such as these. Even with the implementation of such measures, credit card fraud continues to be a problem.

==Revenues==

Offsetting the costs are the following revenues:

===Interchange fee===

In addition to fees paid by the card holder, merchants must also pay interchange fees to the card-issuing bank and the card association.United States Securities and Exchange Commission FORM S-1, November 9, 2007.Debit Cards Cash In On Rewards Riches Tampa Tribune, Feb. 15, 2008. For a typical credit card issuer, interchange fee revenues may represent about a quarter of total revenues.
These fees are typically from 1 to 6 percent of each sale, but will vary not only from merchant to merchant (large merchants can negotiate lower ratesThe Interchange Debate: Issues and Economics James Lyon, Jan. 19, 2006), but also from card to card, with business cards and rewards cards generally costing the merchants more to process. The interchange fee that applies to a particular transaction is also affected by many other variables including: the type of merchant, the merchant's total card sales volume, the merchant's average transaction amount, whether the cards were physically present, how the information required for the transaction was received, the specific type of card, when the transaction was settled, and the authorized and settled transaction amounts. In some cases, merchants add a surcharge to the credit cards to cover the interchange fee, encouraging their customers to instead use cash, debit cards, or even cheques.

===Interest on outstanding balances===

Interest charges vary widely from card issuer to card issuer. Often, there are "teaser" rates in effect for initial periods of time (as low as zero percent for, say, six months), whereas regular rates can be as high as 40 percent. In the U.S. there is no federal limit on the interest or late fees credit card issuers can charge; the interest rates are set by the states, with some states such as South Dakota, having no ceiling on interest rates and fees, inviting some banks to establish their credit card operations there. Other states, for example Delaware, have very weak usury laws. The teaser rate no longer applies if the customer doesn't pay their bills on time, and is replaced by a penalty interest rate (for example, 23.99%) that applies retroactively.

===Fees charged to customers===

The major fees are for:

[/ref] The variation of exchange rates applied by different credit cards can be very substantial, as much as 10% according to a Lonely Planet report in 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/tonywheeler/my_lists/why_we_cut_up_our_credit_cards/ |title=Comparison of exchange rates using Visa and Diners Club cards in Bali |publisher=Lonelyplanet.com |date=2010-03-03 |accessdate=2011-07-28[/tpl]

===Fee increases and changes===

The Credit CARD Act of 2009, which was signed into law by President Obama, specified that credit card companies must send cardholders a notice 45 days before they can increase or change certain fees. This includes annual fees, cash advance fees, and late fees.[ref]
  
</ref>

==Over limit charges==

Consumers who keep their account in good order by always staying within their credit limit, and always making at least the minimum monthly payment will see interest as the biggest expense from their card provider.  Those who are not so careful and regularly surpass their credit limit or are late in making payments are exposed to multiple charges that were typically as high as £25–35[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/credit-and-loans/article.html?in_article_id=407583&in_page_id=9 |title=This is Money Card charges to be slashed |publisher=Thisismoney.co.uk |date=2006-03-13 |accessdate=2011-07-28[/tpl] until a ruling from the Office of Fair Trading[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2006/68-06 |title=Current credit card default charges unfair |publisher=Oft.gov.uk |accessdate=2011-07-28[/tpl] that they would presume charges over £12 to be unfair which led the majority of card providers to reduce their fees to £12.

===United States===

The Credit CARD Act of 2009 requires that consumers "opt-in" to over-limit charges.  Some card issuers have therefore commenced solicitations requesting customers to opt into overlimit fees, presenting this as a benefit as it may avoid the possibility of a future transaction being declined.  Other issuers have simply discontinued the practice of charging overlimit fees.  Whether a customer opts into the overlimit fee or not, banks will in practice have discretion as to whether they choose to authorize transactions above the credit limit or not.  Of course, any approved over limit transactions will only result in an overlimit fee for those customers who have opted into the fee.  This legislation took effect on February 22, 2010. Following this Act, the companies are now required by law to show on a customer's bills how long it would take them to pay off the balance.

===United Kingdom===

The higher level of fees originally charged were claimed to be designed to recoup the costs of the card operator's overall business and to ensure that the credit card business as a whole generated a profit, rather than simply recovering the cost to the provider of the limit breach which has been estimated as typically between £3–4. Profiting from a customer's mistakes is arguably not permitted under UK common law, if the charges constitute penalties for breach of contract, or under the Unfair Terms In Consumer Regulations 1999.
Subsequent rulings in respect of personal current accounts suggest that the argument that these charges are penalties for breach of contract is weak, and given the OFT's ruling it seems unlikely that any further test case will take place.
Whilst the law remains in the balance, many consumers have made claims against their credit cards providers for the charges that they have incurred, plus interest that they would have earned had the money not been deducted from their account.  It is likely that claims for amounts charged in excess of £12 will succeed, but claims for charges at the OFT's £12 threshold level are more contentious.

==Neutral consumer resources==

===Canada===

The Government of Canada maintains a database of the fees, features, interest rates and reward programs of nearly 200 credit cards available in Canada. This database is updated on a quarterly basis with information supplied by the credit card issuing companies. Information in the database is published every quarter on the website of the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC).
Information in the database is published in two formats. It is available in PDF comparison tables that break down the information according to type of credit card, allowing the reader to compare the features of, for example, all the student credit cards in the database.
The database also feeds into an interactive tool on the FCAC website.FCAC - Interactive Tools - Credit Card Selector Tool The interactive tool uses several interview-type questions to build a profile of the user's credit card usage habits and needs, eliminating unsuitable choices based on the profile, so that the user is presented with a small number of credit cards and the ability to carry out detailed comparisons of features, reward programs, interest rates, etc.

==Controversy==

Credit card debt has increased steadily. Since the late 1990s, lawmakers, consumer advocacy groups, college officials and other higher education affiliates have become increasingly concerned about the rising use of credit cards among college students. The major credit card companies have been accused of targeting a younger audience, especially college students, many of whom are already in debt with college tuition fees and college loans and who typically are less experienced at managing their own finances. Credit card debt may also negatively affect their grades as they are likely to work more both part and full-time positions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
Another controversial area is the universal default feature of many North American credit card contracts. When a cardholder is late paying a particular credit card issuer, that card's interest rate can be raised, often considerably. With universal default, a customer's other credit cards, for which the customer may be current on payments, may also have their rates and/or credit limit changed. The universal default feature allows creditors to periodically check cardholders' credit portfolios to view trade, allowing these other institutions to decrease the credit limit and/or increase rates on cardholders who may be late with another credit card issuer. Being late on one credit card will potentially affect all the cardholder's credit cards. Citibank voluntarily stopped this practice in March 2007 and Chase stopped the practice in November 2007.[tpl]cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200712032215DOWJONESDJONLINE000777_FORTUNE5.htm|title=Senate Report Says Credit Scores Used To Justify Card Rate Hikes|date=December 3, 2007| publisher=CNN |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071209023905/http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200712032215DOWJONESDJONLINE000777_FORTUNE5.htm|archivedate=December 9, 2007[/tpl] 
The fact that credit card companies can change the interest rate on debts that were incurred when a different rate of interest was in place is similar to adjustable rate mortgages where interest rates on current debt may rise. However, in both cases, this is agreed to in advance, and is a trade off that allows a lower initial rate as well as the possibility of an even lower rate (mortgages, if interest rates fall) or perpetually keeping a below-market rate (credit cards, if the user makes their debt payments on time). The universal default practice was encouraged by federal regulators, particularly those at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), as a means of managing the changing risk profiles of cardholders.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
Another controversial area is the trailing interest issue. Trailing interest is the practice of charging interest on the entire bill no matter what percentage of it is paid. US Senator Carl Levin raised the issue of millions of Americans affected by hidden fees, compounding interest and cryptic terms. Their woes were heard in a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing which was chaired by Senator Levin, who said that he intends to keep the spotlight on credit card companies and that legislative action may be necessary to purge the industry.[tpl]cite web|author=Joseph S. Enoch |url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/03/senate_credit_cards02.html |title=Credit Card Executives Tough Out Senate Hearing |publisher=Consumeraffairs.com |accessdate=2011-07-28[/tpl] In 2009, the C.A.R.D. Act was signed into law, enacting protections for many of the issues Levin had raised.
In the United States, some have called for Congress to enact additional regulations on the industry to expand the disclosure box clearly disclosing rate hikes, use plain language, incorporate balance payoff disclosures, and also to outlaw universal default. At a congress hearing around March 1, 2007, Citibank announced it would no longer practice this, effective immediately. Opponents of such regulation argue that customers must become more proactive and self-responsible in evaluating and negotiating terms with credit providers. Some of the nation's influential top credit card issuers, which are among the top fifty corporate contributors to political campaigns, successfully opposed it.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl]

===Hidden costs===

In the United Kingdom, merchants won the right through The Credit Cards (Price Discrimination) Order 1990[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1990/Uksi_19902159_en_1.htm |title=Statutory Instrument 1990 No. 2159: The Credit Cards (Price Discrimination) Order 1990 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |accessdate=2011-07-28[/tpl] to charge customers different prices according to the payment method. As of 2007, the United Kingdom was one of the world's most credit-card-intensive countries, with 2.4 credit cards per consumer, according to the UK Payments Administration Ltd."Plastic cards in the UK and how we used them in 2007"[tpl]dead link|date=July 2011[/tpl]
In the United States until 1984, federal law prohibited surcharges on card transactions. Although the federal Truth in Lending Act provisions that prohibited surcharges expired that year, a number of states have since enacted laws that continue to outlaw the practice; California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maine, New York, Oklahoma, and Texas have laws against surcharges. As of 2006, the United States probably had one of the world's highest if not the top ratio of credit cards per capita, with 984 million bank-issued Visa and MasterCard credit card and debit card accounts alone for an adult population of roughly 220 million people.[tpl]cite web|author=American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_S0101&-ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_ |title=US Census: 2005–2007 American Community Survey 3-Year Estimates |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=2011-07-28[/tpl] The credit card per US capita ratio was nearly 4:1 as of 2003[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalscoreindex.com/ViewAllGraphs.aspx |title=Experian's National Score Index |publisher=Nationalscoreindex.com |accessdate=2011-07-28[/tpl] and as high as 5:1 as of 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4207 |title=Prime Numbers: The Plastic Revolution |publisher=Foreign Policy |date=2008-02-19 |accessdate=2011-07-28[/tpl]

==Credit card numbering==

The numbers found on credit cards have a certain amount of internal structure, and share a common numbering scheme.
The card number's prefix, called the Bank Identification Number, is the sequence of digits at the beginning of the number that determine the bank to which a credit card number belongs. This is the first six digits for MasterCard and Visa cards.  The next nine digits are the individual account number, and the final digit is a validity check code.
In addition to the main credit card number, credit cards also carry issue and expiration dates (given to the nearest month), as well as extra codes such as issue numbers and security codes. Not all credit cards have the same sets of extra codes nor do they use the same number of digits.

==Credit cards in ATMs==

Many credit cards can also be used in an ATM to withdraw money against the credit limit extended to the card, but many card issuers charge interest on cash advances before they do so on purchases. The interest on cash advances is commonly charged from the date the withdrawal is made, rather than the monthly billing date. Many card issuers levy a commission for cash withdrawals, even if the ATM belongs to the same bank as the card issuer. Merchants do not offer cashback on credit card transactions because they would pay a percentage commission of the additional cash amount to their bank or merchant services provider, thereby making it uneconomical.
Many credit card companies will also, when applying payments to a card, do so, for the matter at hand, at the end of a billing cycle, and apply those payments to everything before cash advances. For this reason, many consumers have large cash balances, which have no grace period and incur interest at a rate that is (usually) higher than the purchase rate, and will carry those balances for years, even if they pay off their statement balance each month.

==Credit cards as funding for entrepreneurs==

Credit cards are a risky way for entrepreneurs to acquire capital for their start ups when more conventional financing is unavailable. It's widely reported that Len Bosack and Sandy Lerner used personal credit cards[tpl]cite web|url=http://pdp10.nocrew.org/docs/cisco.html |title=A start-up's true tale |publisher=Pdp10.nocrew.org |accessdate=2011-07-28[/tpl]  to start Cisco Systems.  It is rumoured that Larry Page and Sergey Brin's start up of Google was financed by credit cards to buy the necessary computers and office equipment, more specifically "a terabyte of hard disks".Google About Page under 1998 page retrieved 30 May 2007.[tpl]Failed verification|date=February 2011[/tpl]  Similarly, filmmaker Robert Townsend financed part of Hollywood Shuffle using credit cards.Hollywood Shuffle trivia at IMDB page retrieved 7 July 2006 Director Kevin Smith funded Clerks in part by maxing out several credit cards. Actor Richard Hatch also financed his production of Battlestar Galactica: The Second Coming partly through his credit cards. Famed hedge fund manager Bruce Kovner began his career (and, later on, his firm Caxton Associates) in financial markets by borrowing from his credit card.  UK entrepreneur James Caan (as seen on Dragons' Den) financed his first business using several credit cards.

==Problems==

Travellers from the US have encountered problems abroad because many countries have introduced smart cards, but the US has not. [tpl]As of|2010[/tpl], the US banking system had not updated the cards and associated readers in the US, stating that the costs would be prohibitive.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2010-06-01-1B_travelcreditcard01_ST_N.htm |title=Americans abroad run into trouble using credit cards |work=USA Today| first=Roger |last=Yu |date=2010-06-02[/tpl]
