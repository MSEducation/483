[[Dietary fiber]]

CATEGORIES: Nutrition, Dietary supplements

Dietary fiber, dietary fibre, or sometimes roughage and ruffage is the indigestible portion of food derived from plants and waste of animals that eat dietary fiber.
There are two main components:
Dietary fibers can act by changing the nature of the contents of the gastrointestinal tract and by changing how other nutrients and chemicals are absorbed. Some types of soluble fiber absorb water to become a gelatinous, viscous substance which is fermented by bacteria in the digestive tract. Some types of insoluble fiber have bulking action and are not fermented.[tpl]cite journal |author=Anderson JW, Baird P, Davis RH et al. |title=Health benefits of dietary fiber |journal=Nutr Rev |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=188–205 |year=2009 |pmid=19335713 |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2009.00189.x[/tpl] Lignin, a major dietary insoluble fiber source, may alter the rate and metabolism of soluble fibers.  Other types of insoluble fiber, notably resistant starch, are fully fermented.[tpl]cite journal|last=Nugent|first=Anne P|title=Health properties of resistant starch|journal=Nutrition Bulletin|year=2005|volume=30|issue=1|pages=27–54|doi=10.1111/j.1467-3010.2005.00481.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-3010.2005.00481.x/full[/tpl]
Chemically, dietary fiber consists of non-starch polysaccharides such as arabinoxylans, cellulose, and many other plant components such as resistant starch, resistant dextrins, inulin, lignin, waxes, chitins, pectins, beta-glucans, and oligosaccharides. A novel position has been adopted by the US Department of Agriculture to include functional fibers as isolated fiber sources that may be included in the diet. The term "fiber" is something of a misnomer, since many types of so-called dietary fiber are not actually fibrous.
Food sources of dietary fiber are often divided according to whether they provide (predominantly) soluble or insoluble fiber. Plant foods contain both types of fiber in varying degrees, according to the plant's characteristics.
Advantages of consuming fiber are the production of healthful compounds during the fermentation of soluble fiber, and insoluble fiber's ability (via its passive hygroscopic properties) to increase bulk, soften stool, and shorten transit time through the intestinal tract.
Disadvantages of a diet high in fiber is the potential for significant intestinal gas production and bloating. Constipation can occur if insufficient fluid is consumed with a high-fiber diet.

==Definition==

Originally, fiber was defined to be the components of plants that resist human digestive enzymes, a definition that includes lignin and polysaccharides. The definition was later changed to also include resistant starch, along with inulin and other oligosaccharides.
Official definition of dietary fiber differs a little among different institutions:

==Types and sources of dietary fiber==

===Fiber contents in food===

Dietary fiber is most found in vegetables and fruit. The exact amount of fiber contained in the food can be seen in the following table of expected fiber in USDA food groups/subgroupsFiber data derived from USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 17.
Dietary fiber is found in plants. While all plants contain some fiber, plants with high fiber concentrations are generally the most practical source.
Fiber-rich plants can be eaten directly. Or, alternatively, they can be used to make supplements and fiber-rich processed foods.
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND), formerly the American Dietetic Association, recommends consuming a variety of fiber-rich foods.

===Plant sources of fiber===

Some plants contain significant amounts of soluble and insoluble fiber. For example plums and prunes have a thick skin covering a juicy pulp.  The skin is a source of insoluble fiber, whereas soluble fiber is in the pulp. Grapes also contain a fair amount of fiber.[tpl]cite journal |author=Stacewicz-Sapuntzakis M, Bowen PE, Hussain EA, Damayanti-Wood BI, Farnsworth NR |title=Chemical composition and potential health effects of prunes: a functional food? |journal=Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr. |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=251–86 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11401245 |doi=10.1080/20014091091814 [/tpl]
The root of the konjac plant, or glucomannan, produces results similar to fiber and may also be used to relieve constipation. Glucomannan is sold in various forms, and while safe in some forms, it can be unsafe in others, possibly leading to throat or intestinal blockage.http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-205-Konjac+GLUCOMANNAN.aspx?activeIngredientId=205&activeIngredientName=Konjac+(GLUCOMANNAN)&source=2
Soluble fiber is found in varying quantities in all plant foods, including:
Sources of insoluble fiber include:

===Fiber supplements===

These are a few example forms of fiber that have been sold as supplements or food additives. These may be marketed to consumers for nutritional purposes,  treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders, and for such possible health benefits as lowering cholesterol levels, reducing risk of colon cancer, and losing weight.
Soluble fiber supplements may be beneficial for alleviating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, such as diarrhea or constipation and abdominal discomfort.[tpl]cite journal |author=Friedman G |title=Nutritional therapy of irritable bowel syndrome |journal=Gastroenterol Clin North Am. |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=513–24 |date=September 1989 |pmid=2553606 [/tpl]  Prebiotic soluble fiber products, like those containing inulin or oligosaccharides, may contribute to relief from inflammatory bowel disease,[tpl]cite journal |author=Ewaschuk JB, Dieleman LA |title=Probiotics and prebiotics in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases |journal=World J Gastroenterol. |volume=12 |issue=37 |pages=5941–50 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17009391 |url=http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/12/5941.asp[/tpl] as in Crohn's disease,[tpl]cite journal |author=Guarner F |title=Inulin and oligofructose: impact on intestinal diseases and disorders |journal=Br J Nutr. |volume=93 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=S61–5 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15877897 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0007114505000826 |doi=10.1079/BJN20041345[/tpl] ulcerative colitis,[tpl]cite journal |author=Seidner DL, Lashner BA, Brzezinski A, et al. |title=An oral supplement enriched with fish oil, soluble fiber, and antioxidants for corticosteroid sparing in ulcerative colitis: a randomized, controlled trial |journal=Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=358–69 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15822041 |doi=10.1016/S1542-3565(04)00672-X [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Rodríguez-Cabezas ME, Gálvez J, Camuesco D, et al. |title=Intestinal anti-inflammatory activity of dietary fiber (Plantago ovata seeds) in HLA-B27 transgenic rats |journal=Clin Nutr. |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=463–71 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14512034 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0261561403000451 |doi=10.1016/S0261-5614(03)00045-1[/tpl] and Clostridium difficile,[tpl]cite journal |author=Ward PB, Young GP |title=Dynamics of Clostridium difficile infection.

====Inulins====

Chemically defined as oligosaccharides occurring naturally in most plants, inulins have nutritional value as carbohydrates, or more specifically as fructans, a polymer of the natural plant sugar, fructose. Inulin is typically extracted by manufacturers from enriched plant sources such as chicory roots or Jerusalem artichokes for use in prepared foods.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kaur N, Gupta AK |title=Applications of inulin and oligofructose in health and nutrition |journal=J Biosci. |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=703–14 |date=December 2002 |pmid=12571376 |url=http://www.ias.ac.in/jbiosci/dec2002/703.pdf |format=PDF|doi=10.1007/BF02708379[/tpl] Subtly sweet, it can be used to replace sugar, fat, and flour, is often used to improve the flow and mixing qualities of powdered nutritional supplements, and has significant potential health value as a prebiotic fermentable fiber.[tpl]cite journal |author=Roberfroid MB |title=Inulin-type fructans: functional food ingredients |journal=J Nutr. |volume=137 |issue=11 Suppl |pages=2493S–2502S |pmid=17951492 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17951492 |date= November 1, 2007 [/tpl]
Inulin is advantageous because it contains 25–30% the food energy of sugar or other carbohydrates and 10–15% the food energy of fat. As a prebiotic fermentable fiber, its metabolism by gut flora yields short-chain fatty acids (see below) which increase absorption of calcium,[tpl]cite journal | author = Abrams S, Griffin I, Hawthorne K, Liang L, Gunn S, Darlington G, Ellis K | title = A combination of prebiotic short- and long-chain inulin-type fructans enhances calcium absorption and bone mineralization in young adolescents | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 82 | issue = 2 | pages = 471–6 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16087995[/tpl] magnesium,[tpl]cite journal | author = Coudray C, Demigné C, Rayssiguier Y | title = Effects of dietary fibers on magnesium absorption in animals and humans | journal = J Nutr | volume = 133 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12514257[/tpl] and iron,[tpl]cite journal | author = Tako E, Glahn RP, Welch RM, Lei X, Yasuda K, Miller DD. | title = Dietary inulin affects the expression of intestinal enterocyte iron transporters, receptors and storage protein and alters the microbiota in the pig intestine | journal = Br J Nutr. | issue = Sep | pages = 1–9 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17868492 | volume = 99 | doi = 10.1017/S0007114507825128[/tpl] resulting from upregulation of mineral-transporting genes and their membrane transport proteins within the colon wall. Among other potential beneficial effects noted above, inulin promotes an increase in the mass and health of intestinal Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium populations.

====Vegetable gums====

Vegetable gum fiber supplements are relatively new to the market. Often sold as a powder, vegetable gum fibers dissolve easily with no aftertaste. In preliminary clinical trials, they have proven effective for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.[tpl]cite journal | author = Parisi GC, Zilli M, Miani MP, Carrara M, Bottona E, Verdianelli G, Battaglia G, Desideri S, Faedo A, Marzolino C, Tonon A, Ermani M, Leandro G. | title = High-fiber diet supplementation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): a multicenter, randomized, open trial comparison between wheat bran diet and partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) | journal = Dig Dis Sci. | volume = 47 | issue = 8 | pages = 1697–704 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12184518 | doi = 10.1023/A:1016419906546[/tpl] Examples of vegetable gum fibers are guar gum and acacia Senegal gum.

==Mechanism==

Dietary fibers have three primary mechanisms: bulking, viscosity and fermentation.[tpl]cite book|last=Gallaher|first=Daniel D.|title=Dietary Fiber|year=2006|publisher=ILSI Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-1-57881-199-1|pages=102–110[/tpl]  Dietary fibers can change the nature of the contents of the gastrointestinal tract, and to change how other nutrients and chemicals are absorbed through bulking and viscosity. Some types of soluble fibers bind to bile acids in the small intestine, making them less likely to re-enter the body; this in turn lowers cholesterol levels in the blood from the actions of cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation of cholesterol. Viscous soluble fibers may also attenuate the absorption of sugar, reduce sugar response after eating, normalize blood lipid levels and, once fermented in the colon, produce short-chain fatty acids as byproducts with wide-ranging physiological activities (discussion below). Insoluble fiber is associated with reduced diabetes risk, but the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown.[tpl]cite journal |author=Weickert MO, Pfeiffer AF |title=Metabolic effects of dietary fiber consumption and prevention of diabetes |journal=J Nutr |volume=138 |issue=3 |pages=439–42 |year=2008 |pmid=18287346 [/tpl]  One type of insoluble dietary fiber, resistant starch has been shown to directly increase insulin sensitivity in healthy people,[tpl]cite journal|last=Robertson|first=M.

Not yet formally proposed as an essential macro-nutrient, dietary fiber is nevertheless regarded as important for the diet, with regulatory authorities in many developed countries recommending increases in fiber intake.[tpl]cite journal |author=Eastwood M, Kritchevsky D |title=Dietary fiber: how did we get where we are? |journal=Annu Rev Nutr |volume=25 |issue= |pages=1–8 |year=2005 |pmid=16011456 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.25.121304.131658 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Dietary reference values for carbohydrates and dietary fiber| publisher = European Food Safety Authority | url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/DocumentSet/nda_op_drv_carbohydrates_draft_en_released%20for%20consultation,0.pdf?ssbinary=true[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |journal=Appl Physiol Nutr Metab |year=2008 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=118–23 |title=Are functional foods redefining nutritional requirements? |author=Jones PJ, Varady KA |doi=10.1139/H07-134 |pmid=18347661 |url=http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/RPViewDoc?issn=1715-5312&volume=33&issue=1&startPage=118 |format=PDF [/tpl]

===Physicochemical properties===

Dietary fiber has distinct physicochemical properties. Most semi-solid foods, fiber and fat are a combination of gel matrices which are hydrated or collapsed with microstructural elements, globules, solutions or encapsulating walls. Fresh fruit and vegetables are cellular materials.Hermansson AM. Gel structure of food biopolymers In:  Food Structure, its creation and evaluation.JMV Blanshard and JR Mitchell, eds. 1988 pp. 25-40Butterworths, London.Rockland LB, Stewart GF. Water Activity: Influences on Food Quality. Academic Press, New York. 1991[tpl]cite journal | author = Eastwood MA, Morris ER | year = 1992 | title = Physical properties of dietary fibre that influence physiological function: a model for polymers along the gastrointestinal tract | url = | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 55 | issue = | pages = 436–442 [/tpl]

===Dietary fiber and the upper gastrointestinal tract===

A slowly eaten meal will enter the absorptive phase of the gastrointestinal tract more slowly than a rapidly eaten meal of similar composition. Many of the differences between low and high glycemic foods would disappear if a meal was eaten slowly.[tpl]cite journal | author = Heaton KW, Marcus SN, Emmett PH, Bolton DH | year = 1988 | title = Particle size of wheat, maize, oat test meals;  effects on plasma glucose and insulin responses and rate of starch digestion in vitro | url = | journal = Am J Clin Nutr | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 675–82 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Jenkins DJA, Wolever TMS, Leeds AR et al. | year = 1978 | title = Dietary fibres, fibre analogues and glucose tolerance:  importance of viscosity | url = | journal = Br Med J | volume = 1 | issue = 6124| pages = 1392–94 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.6124.1392 [/tpl]
The chemical and physico-chemical nature (lipid, protein, carbohydrate) of the meal will also influence the gastric emptying of the food multiphase system. Fatty foods and hypertonic solutions empty slowly.
The movement of food, i.e., chyme, along the gastrointestinal tract is typical of flow in a disperse system. As chyme moves along the gastrointestinal tract, polymer flow and diffusion becomes important.Edwards CA, Johnson IT, Read NW. Do viscous polysaccharides reduce absorption by inhibiting diffusion or convection? Eur J Clin Nutr 1988;42:307-12.
Following a meal, the stomach and upper gastrointestinal contents consist of
Micelles are colloid-sized clusters of molecules which form in conditions as those above, similar to the critical micelle concentration of detergents.Carey MC, Small DM and Bliss CM. Lipid digestion and Absorption. Annual Review of Physiology. 1983.45:651-677.
In the upper gastrointestinal tract, these detergents consist of bile acids and di- and monoacyl glycerols which solubilize triacylglycerols and cholesterol.
Two mechanisms bring nutrients into contact with the epithelium:
The multiple physical phases in the intestinal tract slow the rate of absorption compared to that of the suspension solvent alone.
Adding viscous polysaccharides to carbohydrate meals can reduce post-prandial blood glucose concentrations.  Wheat and maize but not oats modify glucose absorption, the rate being dependent upon the particle size. The reduction in absorption rate with guar gum may be due to the increased resistance by viscous solutions to the convective flows created by intestinal contractions.
Dietary fiber interacts with pancreatic and enteric enzymes and their substrates.  Human pancreatic enzyme activity is reduced when incubated with most fiber sources.  Fiber may affect amylase activity and hence the rate of hydrolysis of starch. The more viscous polysaccharides extend the mouth-to-cecum transit time; guar, tragacanth and pectin being slower than wheat bran.Schneeman BO, Gallacher D. Effects of dietary fibre on digestive enzyme activity and bile acids in the small intestine.  Proc Soc Exp Biol Med 1985;  180 409-14.

===Fiber in the colon===

The colon may be regarded as two organs,
The presence of bacteria in the colon produces an ‘organ’ of intense, mainly reductive, metabolic activity, whereas the liver is oxidative.
The substrates utilized by the cecal have either passed along the entire intestine or are biliary excretion products.
The effects of dietary fiber in the colon are on
Enlargement of the cecum is a common finding when some dietary fibers are fed and this is now believed to be normal physiological adjustment. Such an increase may be due to a number of factors, prolonged cecal residence of the fiber, increased bacterial mass, or increased bacterial end-products.
Some non-absorbed carbohydrates, e.g. pectin, gum arabic, oligosaccharides and resistant starch, are fermented to short-chain fatty acids (chiefly acetic, propionic and n-butyric), and carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. The cecal fermentation of 40–50 g of complex polysaccharides will yield 400–500 mmol total short-chain fatty acids, 240–300 mmol acetate, and 80–100 mmol of both propionate and butyrate.[tpl]fact|date=October 2013[/tpl] Almost all of these short-chain fatty acids will be absorbed from the colon. This means that fecal short-chain fatty acid estimations do not reflect cecal and colonic fermentation, only the efficiency of absorption, the ability of the fiber residue to sequestrate short-chain fatty acids, and the continued fermentation of fiber around the colon, which presumably will continue until the substrate is exhausted.
The production of short-chain fatty acids has several possible actions on the gut mucosa. All of the short-chain fatty acids are readily absorbed by the colonic mucosa, but only acetic acid reaches the systemic circulation in appreciable amounts. Butyric acid appears to be used as a fuel by the colonic mucosa as the preferred energy source for colonic cells.

===Dietary fiber and cholesterol metabolism===

Dietary fiber may act on each phase of ingestion, digestion, absorption and excretion to affect cholesterol metabolism,[tpl]cite journal | author = Brown L, Rosner B, Willett WW and Sacks FM | year = 1999 | title = Cholesterol-lowering effects of dietary fiber: a meta-analysis | journal = Amer J Clin Nutr | volume = 69 | pages = 30–42 | pmid = 9925120 | issue = 1[/tpl] such as the following:
An important action of some fibers is to reduce the reabsorption of bile acids in the ileum and hence the amount and type of bile acid and fats reaching the colon. A reduction in the reabsorption of bile acid from the ileum has several direct effects.
The fibers that are most effective in influencing sterol metabolism (e.g. pectin) are fermented in the colon. It is therefore unlikely that the reduction in body cholesterol is due to adsorption to this fermented fiber in the colon.

===Dietary fiber and fecal weight===

Feces consist of plasticine-like material, made up of water, bacteria, lipids, sterols, mucus and fiber.
Water is distributed in the colon in three ways:
Fecal weight is dictated by:
Wheat bran is minimally fermented and binds water and when added to the diet increases fecal weight in a predictable linear manner and decreases intestinal transit time. The particle size of the fiber is all-important, coarse wheat bran being more effective than fine wheat bran. The greater the water-holding capacity of the bran, the greater the effect on fecal weight. For most healthy individuals, an increase in wet fecal weight, depending on the particle size of the bran, is generally of the order of 3–5 g/g fiber.
The fermentation of some fibers results in an increase in the bacterial content and possibly fecal weight. Other fibers, e.g. pectin, are fermented and have no effect on stool weight.

==Effects of fiber intake==

Research has shown that fiber may benefit health in several different ways. Lignin and probably related materials that are resistant to enzymatic degradation, diminish the nutritional value of foods.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.arplant.54.031902.134938 | title = Ligninbiosynthesis | year = 2003 | last1 = Boerjan | first1 = Wout | last2 = Ralph | first2 = John | last3 = Baucher | first3 = Marie | journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology | volume = 54 | pages = 519–46 | pmid = 14503002[/tpl]

Fiber does not bind to minerals and vitamins and therefore does not restrict their absorption, but rather evidence exists that fermentable fiber sources improve absorption of minerals, especially calcium.[tpl]cite journal |author=Greger JL |title=Nondigestible carbohydrates and mineral bioavailability |journal=J Nutr. |volume=129 |issue=7 Suppl |pages=1434S–5S |date=July 1999 |pmid=10395614 |doi= |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10395614[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Raschka L, Daniel H |title=Mechanisms underlying the effects of inulin-type fructans on calcium absorption in the large intestine of rats |journal=Bone |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=728–35 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16126464 |doi=10.1016/j.bone.2005.05.015 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Scholz-Ahrens KE, Schrezenmeir J |title=Inulin and oligofructose and mineral metabolism: the evidence from animal trials |journal=J Nutr. |volume=137 |issue=11 Suppl |pages=2513S–2523S |date=Nov 2007 |pmid=17951495[/tpl] Some plant foods can reduce the absorption of minerals and vitamins like calcium, zinc, vitamin C, and magnesium, but this is caused by the presence of phytate (which is also thought to have important health benefits), not by fiber.
An experiment designed with a large sample and conducted by NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study studied the correlation between fiber intake and colorectal cancer. The analytic cohort consisted of 291 988 men and 197 623 women aged 50–71 y. Diet was assessed with a self-administered food-frequency qustionnaire at baseline in 1995-1996; 2974 incident colorectal cancer cases were identified during 5 y of follow-up.
The result was that total fiber intake was not associated with colorectal cancer. But on the other hand, the analyses of fiber from different food sources showed that fiber from grains was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer.Dietary fiber and whole-grain consumption in relation to colorectal cancer in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, Arthur Schatzkin, Traci Mouw, etc, http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/85/5/1353.full.pdf+html?sid=daf916fc-14c9-42c6-bd0f-d61335975d9b
Although many researchers believe that dietary fiber intake reduces risk of colon cancer, one study conducted by researchers at the Harvard School of Medicine of over 88,000 women did not show a statistically significant relationship between higher fiber consumption and lower rates of colorectal cancer or adenomas.[tpl]cite journal |author=Fuchs CS, Giovannucci EL, Colditz GA, et al. |title=Dietary fiber and the risk of colorectal cancer and adenoma in women |journal=N Engl J Med. |volume=340 |issue=3 |pages=169–76 |date=January 1999 |pmid=9895396 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=9895396&promo=ONFLNS19 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199901213400301[/tpl]  Similarly, a 2010 study of 58,279 men found no relationship between dietary fiber and colorectal cancer.[tpl]cite journal |author=Simons CCJM et al, |title=Bowel Movement and Constipation Frequencies and the Risk of Colorectal Cancer Among Men in the Netherlands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer |journal=Am J Epidemiol |volume=172 |issue=12 |pages=1404–14 |date=October 2010 |url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/10/27/aje.kwq307.full |doi=10.1093/aje/kwq307 |pmid=20980354[/tpl]

==Dietary fiber and obesity==

Dietary fiber has many functions in diet, one of which may be to aid in energy intake control and reduced risk for development of obesity. The role of dietary fiber in energy intake regulation and obesity
development is related to its unique physical and chemical properties that aid in early signals of satiation and enhanced or prolonged signals of satiety. Early signals of satiation may be induced through cephalic- and gastric-phase responses related to the bulking effects of dietary fiber on energy density and palatability, whereas the viscosity-producing effects of certain fibers may enhance satiety through intestinal-phase events related to modified gastrointestinal function and subsequent delay in fat absorption. In general, fiber-rich diets, whether achieved through fiber supplementation or incorporation of high fiber foods into meals, have a reduced energy density compared with high fat diets. This is related to fiber’s ability to add bulk and weight to the diet. There are also indications that women may be more sensitive to dietary manipulation with fiber than men. The relationship of body weight status and fiber effect on energy intake suggests that obese individuals may be more likely to reduce food intake with dietary fiber inclusion.Britt Burton-Freeman, Amgen, Incorporated, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320-1799, Symposium: Dietary Composition and Obesity: Do We Need to Look beyond Dietary Fat?

==Guidelines on fiber intake==

Current recommendations from the United States National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine, suggest that adults should consume 20–35 grams of dietary fiber per day, but the average American's daily intake of dietary fiber is only 12–18 grams.Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State Universityfiber: Nutrition Source, Harvard School of Public Health
The AND (Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, previously ADA) recommends a minimum of 20–35 g/day for a healthy adult depending on calorie intake (e.g., a 2000 Cal/8400 kJ diet should include 25 g of fiber per day). The AND's recommendation for children is that intake should equal age in years plus 5 g/day (e.g., a 4 year old should consume 9 g/day). No guidelines have yet been established for the elderly or very ill. Patients with current constipation, vomiting, and abdominal pain should see a physician. Certain bulking agents are not commonly recommended with the prescription of opioids because the slow transit time mixed with larger stools may lead to severe constipation, pain, or obstruction.
The British Nutrition Foundation has recommended a minimum fiber intake of 18 g/day for healthy adults.Dietary fibre. British Nutrition Foundation.

===Fiber recommendations in the US===

On average, North Americans consume less than 50% of the dietary fiber levels recommended for good health. In the preferred food choices of today's youth, this value may be as low as 20%, a factor considered by experts as contributing to the obesity levels seen in many developed countries.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lustig RH |title=The 'skinny' on childhood obesity: how our western environment starves kids' brains |journal=Pediatr Ann. |volume=35 |issue=12 |pages=898–902, 905–7 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17236437 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Suter PM |title=Carbohydrates and dietary fiber |journal=Handb Exp Pharmacol. |issue=170 |pages=231–61 |year=2005 |pmid=16596802 |url=http://www.springerlink.comopenurl.asp?genre=chapter&issn=0171-2004&volume=&page=231 |doi=10.1007/3-540-27661-0_8 |volume=170 |series=Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology |isbn=3-540-22569-2[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=October 2009[/tpl]

Recognizing the growing scientific evidence for physiological benefits of increased fiber intake, regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States have given approvals to food products making health claims for fiber.

Soluble (fermentable) fiber sources gaining FDA approval are:
Other examples of fermentable fiber sources (from plant foods or biotechnology) used in functional foods and supplements include inulin, resistant dextrins, fructans, xanthan gum, cellulose, guar gum, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), and oligo- or polysaccharides.
Consistent intake of fermentable fiber through foods like berries and other fresh fruit, vegetables, whole grains, seeds, and nuts is now known to reduce risk of some of the world’s most prevalent diseases[tpl]cite journal |author=Venn BJ, Mann JI |title=Cereal grains, legumes and diabetes |journal=Eur J Clin Nutr. |volume=58 |issue=11 |pages=1443–61 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15162131 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601995 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Lee YP, Puddey IB, Hodgson JM |title=Protein, fiber and blood pressure: potential benefit of legumes |journal=Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=473–6 |date=April 2008 |pmid=18307744 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1681.2008.04899.x [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Theuwissen E, Mensink RP |title=Water-soluble dietary fibers and cardiovascular disease |journal=Physiol.

In this last category are constipation, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, hemorrhoids, Crohn's disease, diverticulitis, and colon cancer—all disorders of the intestinal tract where fermentable fiber can provide healthful benefits.
Insufficient fiber in the diet can complicate defecation.WebMD Constipation Low-fiber feces are dehydrated and hardened, making them difficult to evacuate—defining constipation and possibly leading to development of hemorrhoids or anal fissures.

===Fiber recommendations in the UK===

In June 2007, the British Nutrition Foundation issued a statement to define dietary fiber more concisely and list the potential health benefits established to date:British Nutrition Foundation defines 'fibre'British Nutrition Foundation
 ‘Dietary fibre’ has been used as a collective term for a complex mixture of substances with different chemical and physical properties which exert different types of physiological effects.
 The use of certain analytical methods to quantify dietary fiber by nature of its indigestibility results in many other indigestible components being isolated along with the carbohydrate components of dietary fiber. These components include resistant starches and oligosaccharides along with other substances that exist within the plant cell structure and contribute to the material that passes through the digestive tract. Such components are likely to have physiological effects.
Yet, some differentiation has to be made between these indigestible plant components and other partially digested material, such as protein, that appears in the large bowel. Thus, it is better to classify fiber as a group of compounds with different physiological characteristics, rather than to be constrained by defining it chemically.
Diets naturally high in fiber can be considered to bring about several main physiological consequences:
Therefore, it is not appropriate to state that fiber has a single all encompassing physiological property as these effects are dependent on the type of fiber in the diet. The beneficial effects of high fiber diets are the summation of the effects of the different types of fiber present in the diet and also other components of such diets.
Defining fiber physiologically allows recognition of indigestible carbohydrates with structures and physiological properties similar to those of naturally occurring dietary fibers.

==Fiber and calories==

Fiber contributes less energy—usually measured in kilojoules (kJ) or kilocalories (kcal), also known as dietary Calories (Cal)—than sugars and starches because it cannot be fully absorbed by the body. Sugars and starches provide [tpl]convert|17|kJ/g|kcal/g|abbr=on[/tpl],United Kingdom The Food Labelling Regulations 1996 – Schedule 7: Nutrition labelling and the human body has specific enzymes to break them down into glucose, fructose, and galactose, which can then be absorbed by the body. The human body lacks enzymes to break down fiber.  Insoluble fiber does not change inside the body, so the body cannot absorb it and it provides no energy. Soluble fiber is partially fermented, with the degree of fermentability varying with the type of fiber, and contributes some energy when broken down and absorbed by the body. Dietitians have not reached a consensus on how much energy is actually absorbed, but some approximate [tpl]convert|8|kJ/g|kcal/g|abbr=on[/tpl]. Regardless of the type of fiber, the body absorbs less than [tpl]convert|17|kJ/g|kcal/g|abbr=on[/tpl], which can create inconsistencies for actual product nutrition labels. In some countries fiber is not listed on nutrition labels and is considered to provide no energy. In other countries all fiber must be listed and is simplistically considered to provide [tpl]convert|17|kJ/g|kcal/g|abbr=on[/tpl] (because chemically fiber is a type of carbohydrate and other carbohydrates provide that amount of energy). In the US, soluble fiber must be counted as [tpl]convert|4|kcal/g|kJ/g|abbr=on[/tpl], but insoluble fiber may be (and usually is) treated as not providing energy and not mentioned on the label.

==Soluble fiber fermentation==

The American Association of Cereal Chemists has defined soluble fiber this way:
"the edible parts of plants or similar carbohydrates resistant to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine with complete or partial fermentation in the large intestine."http://www.aaccnet.org/DietaryFiber/pdfs/dietfiber.pdf  In this definition:
As an example of fermentation, shorter-chain carbohydrates (a type of fiber found in legumes) cannot be digested, but are changed via fermentation in the colon into short-chain fatty acids and gases (which are typically expelled as flatulence).
According to a 2002 journal article,Tungland BC, Meyer D, Nondigestible oligo- and polysaccharides (dietary fiber): their physiology and role in human health and food, Comp Rev Food Sci Food Safety, 3:73-92, 2002 (Table 3)http://webdev.ift.org/NR/rdonlyres/7F1901F3-743E-4C1A-8A3A-38473B8A1037/0/crfsfsv01n3p073077ms20001598.pdf
fibers compounds with partial or low fermentability include:
fiber compounds with high fermentability include:

==Short-chain fatty acids==

When soluble fiber is fermented, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are produced. SCFAs are involved in numerous physiological processes promoting health, including:
SCFAs that are absorbed by the colonic mucosa pass through the colonic wall into the portal circulation (supplying the liver), and the liver transports them into the general circulatory system.
Overall, SCFAs affect major regulatory systems, such as blood glucose and lipid levels, the colonic environment, and intestinal immune functions.[tpl]cite journal |author=Roy CC, Kien CL, Bouthillier L, Levy E |title=Short-chain fatty acids: ready for prime time? |journal=Nutr Clin Pract. |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=351–66 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16870803 |url=http://ncp.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16870803 |doi=10.1177/0115426506021004351[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Scholz-Ahrens KE, Ade P, Marten B, et al. |title=Prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics affect mineral absorption, bone mineral content, and bone structure |journal=J Nutr. |volume=137 |issue=3 Suppl 2 |pages=838S–46S |pmid=17311984 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17311984 |date= March 1, 2007 [/tpl]
The major SCFAs in humans are butyrate, propionate, and acetate, where butyrate is the major energy source for colonocytes, propionate is destined for uptake by the liver, and acetate enters the peripheral circulation to be metabolized by peripheral tissues.

==FDA-approved health claims==

The FDA allows producers of foods containing 1.7g per serving of psyllium husk soluble fiber or 0.75g of oat or barley soluble fiber as beta-glucans to claim that reduced risk of heart disease can result from their regular consumption.FDA/CFSAN A Food Labeling Guide: Appendix C Health Claims, April 2008
The FDA statement template for making this claim is: Soluble fiber from foods such as of soluble fiber source, and, if desired, name of food product, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease. A serving of of food product supplies __ grams of the daily dietary intake for the benefit soluble fiber from of soluble fiber source necessary per day to have this effect.
Eligible sources of soluble fiber providing beta-glucan include:
The allowed label may state that diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and that include soluble fiber from certain of the above foods "may" or "might" reduce the risk of heart disease.
As discussed in FDA regulation 21 CFR 101.81, the daily dietary intake levels of soluble fiber from sources listed above associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease are:
Soluble fiber from consuming grains is included in other allowed health claims for lowering risk of some types of cancer and heart disease by consuming fruit and vegetables (21 CFR 101.76, 101.77, and 101.78).

==Potential longevity==

A study of 388,000 adults ages 50 to 71 for nine years found that the highest consumers of fiber were 22% less likely to die over this period.[tpl]cite journal| journal = Arch Intern Med | date = Feb 14, 2011 | author = Park Y, Subar AF, Hollenbeck A, Schatzkin A | title = Dietary fiber intake and mortality in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study | pmid = 21321288 | doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2011.18| volume = 171| issue = 12| pages = 1061–8 | pmc=3513325[/tpl] In addition to lower risk of death from heart disease, adequate consumption of fiber-containing foods, especially grains, was also associated with reduced incidence of infectious and respiratory illnesses, and, particularly among males, reduced risk of cancer-related death.
