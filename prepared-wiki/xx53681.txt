Sowerby is a small village and civil parish in the Hambleton district of North Yorkshire, England, it is situated immediately south of Thirsk. The parish boundary merges with that of Thirsk, so the village could be described as a suburb. The author James Herriot lived in the village.

==History==

The lines of a Roman road can still be seen in the fields to the north and east of the village along the Green Lane and was known as The Saxty Way.
The village is mentioned twice in the Domesday Book as Sorebi in the Yarlestre hundred. The land was split across both the head manors of Easingwold and Newsham. At the time of the Norman invasion, the manors were split between Earl Morcar and Ligulf, who granted land to Orm. Afterwards, the lands became Crown property.[tpl]OpenDomesday|OS=SE4285|name=sowerby|display=Sowerby|accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl] The overlordship was granted to the Mowbray family, who granted land to William Lascelles in 1228. The Lascelles family held their manor until 1602, when it was sold to the Meynell family. The manor has followed the inheritance of the manor at North Kilvington since then. William de Vescy of Kildare held a mesne lordship in the area in the 14th century.[tpl]cite book|title=Bulmer's Topography, History and Directory (Private and Commercial) of North Yorkshire 1890 |pages=796â€“798|year=1890 |publisher= S&N Publishing|isbn= 1-86150-299-0|accessdate=11 November 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=64612|title=History|accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl]
The Lascelles (Lassels) family were also credited with building a terrace of houses at the north end of the village, still known as Blue (or Bribery) Terrace, since tenants were expected to vote for the candidate who supported the Tory cause.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
Sowerby's name comes from the Norse language, in which it means 'Farmstead (by the) muddy/sour ground', which is the origin of the word sewer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/county/Yorkshire+NR|title=Topynomy|accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl]
In the south of the parish, the Cod Beck is crossed by a 17th-century pack horse bridge at Blakey Lane, which is a Grade II listed building.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-501295-blakey-bridge-sowerby-north-yorkshire|title=Blakey Bridge|accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl] Further south, Cod Beck is crossed again on South Moor Lane, by another 17th century pack horse bridge, which is also a Grade II Listed building.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-333273-town-end-bridge-sowerby-north-yorkshire/osmap|title=Town end Bridge|accessdate=27 January 2013[/tpl]

==Geography==

The boundary of the civil parish runs from the A168/A19 junction north to the Moor Lane Stell. From here it runs west, crossing Cod Beck and down Chapel Lane to then follow the A61 as far as Millbank Court. Here it runs south of the housing to cross the East Coast Main Line and then runs south to the boundary of Topcliffe airfield. It then runs east to include most of the small hamlet of Thorpefield and on to Ox Moor plantation. The boundary then follows the southerly route of the Cod Beck as far as, but not including, the hamlet of Westholme. It returns northwards to encompass Sowerby Parks to the A19 at Mile House and then to the A168/A19 junction. Paradise Beck lies wholly within the parish and joins Cod Beck near Sowerby Parks Farm.
The centre of the village has an avenue of English lime trees, planted to celebrate the jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887. To the east of the village is the open pasture of Sowerby Flats. The fields show rig and furrow cultivation marks (i.e. dug with a spade rather than a plough) and the river shows signs of the abandoned project (started c. 1768) to build a canal from the centre of the town to connect with the River Swale.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=64612|title=Parishes: Thirsk |author=William Page (editor)|authorlink=William Henry Page |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1923 |work=Victoria County History: A History of the County of York North Riding: Volume 2|accessdate=14 February 2013[/tpl]
