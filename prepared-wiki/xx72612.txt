The Facts of Life is an American sitcom that originally ran on the NBC television network from August 24, 1979, to May 7, 1988, making it one of the longest running sitcoms of the 1980s. A spin-off of the sitcom Diff'rent Strokes, the series' premise focuses on Edna Garrett (Charlotte Rae) as she becomes a housemother (and after the second season, a dietitian as well) at the fictional Eastland School, an all-female boarding school in Peekskill, New York.New York Times

==Premise==

===Season 1===

A spin-off of Diff'rent Strokes, the series featured the Drummonds' housekeeper, Edna Garrett (Charlotte Rae) as the housemother of a dormitory at Eastland School, a private all-girls school. The girls in her care included spoiled rich girl Blair Warner (Lisa Whelchel); the youngest, gossipy Dorothy "Tootie" Ramsey (Kim Fields); and impressionable Natalie Green (Mindy Cohn).
The pilot for the show originally aired as the last episode of Diff'rent Strokes' first season and was called "The Girls' School (aka Garrett's Girls)." The plotline for the pilot had Kimberly Drummond requesting that Mrs. Garrett help her sew costumes for a student play at East Lake School for Girls, the school Kimberly attended in upstate New York, as her dorm's housemother had recently quit. Mrs. Garrett agrees to help, puts on a successful play, and also solves a problem for Nancy. Mrs. Garrett is asked to stay on as the new housemother but states she would rather remain working for the Drummonds at the end of the pilot.
Following the pilot, the name of the school was changed to Eastland and characters were replaced, with Natalie, Cindy, and Mr. Bradley becoming part of the main group featured. Although Kimberly Drummond is featured as a student at East Lake, her character did not cross over to the spinoff series with Mrs. Garrett.
In the show's first season, episodes focus on the troubles of seven girls, with the action  usually set in a large, wood-paneled common room of a girls' dormitory. Also appearing was the school's headmaster, Mr. Steven Bradley (John Lawlor), and Ms. Emily Mahoney (Jenny O'Hara), an Eastland teacher who was dropped after the first four episodes. Early episodes of the show typically revolve around a central morality-based or "lesson teaching" theme. The show's pilot episode plot included a story line in which Blair Warner insinuates that her schoolmate Cindy Webster is a lesbian because she is a tomboy and frequently shows affection for other girls. Other season-one episodes deal with issues including drug use, sex, eating disorders, parental relationships, and peer pressure.

===Seasons 2–8===

After the first season the show was retooled extensively, creating an instant surge in ratings - catapulting harder hitting episodes like "fear strikes back", where Natalie escapes a rapist - into the week's top 5. The producers felt that there were too many characters given the limitations of the half-hour sitcom format, and that the plotlines should be more focused to give the remaining girls more room for character development. Four of the original actresses—Julie Anne Haddock (Cindy), Julie Piekarski (Sue Ann), Felice Schachter (Nancy), and Molly Ringwald (Molly)—were written out of the show (although the four did make periodic appearances in the second and third seasons, and one "reunion" in the eighth season). Mr. Bradley's character was also dropped and replaced with a generally unseen headmaster named Mr. Harris. (Mr. Harris actually appeared in an early second season episode, "Gossip", played by Kenneth Mars) and Mr. Parker for the rest of the series. In addition to being housemother to the remaining girls, Mrs. Garrett became the school dietitian as the second season began. Jo Polniaczek, a new student originally from the Bronx, arrived at Eastland on scholarship. A run-in with the law forced the four to be separated from the other girls, and work in the cafeteria, living together in a spare room next to Mrs. Garrett's bedroom.
In 1983, Jo and Blair graduated Eastland Academy in the season 4 finale "Graduation" (placing #5 for the week). To keep the four girls under one roof in Season 5, Mrs. Garrett went into business for herself and opened a gourmet food venture named Edna's Edibles. The four girls come to work for her and live in one of the rooms in the house attached to the store. The season 5 premiere placed #9 in the week's TV ratings.
In September 1985 NBC moved the 7th season of the series to its burgeoning Saturday night lineup at 830PM, lead-in for the new series Golden Girls at 9PM. In an attempt to refresh the "ratings work horse" and increase ratings, Mrs. Garrett's store, Edna's Edibles is gutted by fire in the season seven premiere "Out of the Fire", placing #11 for the week — giving the series a strong start for the season. The follow-up episode "Into the Frying Pan" (placing #8 for the week) had the girls band together to rebuild the store with a pop culture-influenced gift shop that the girls ran together, called Over Our Heads. By the end of the season, TV Guide reported, "Facts[tpl]'[/tpl] success has been so unexpected that scions of Hollywood are still taken aback by it. ... Facts has in fact been among NBC's top-ranked comedies for the past five years. It finished twenty-third overall for the 1985–1986 season, handily winning its time slot against its most frequent competitors, Airwolf and Benson. Lisa Whelchel stated, 'We're easily overlooked because we've never been a huge hit; we just sort of snuck in there.'"TV Guide July 5–11, 1985
Charlotte Rae initially reduced her role in seasons six and seven, and later decided to leave the series altogether. In season eight's heavily promoted one-hour premiere "Out of Peekskill", Mrs. Garrett married the man of her dreams and joined him in Africa while he works for the Peace Corps. Mrs. Garrett convinces her sister, Beverly Ann Stickle (Cloris Leachman), to take over the shop and look after the girls. Beverly Ann later legally adopted Over Our Heads worker Andy Moffett (Mackenzie Astin) in the episode "A Boy About the House" which became the highest rated regular episode of the season with an 18.3 rating/31 share.Variety March 4, 1987, Weekly Ratings Scorecard, page 93  Describing the new changes to The Facts of Life Brandon Tartikoff, NBC Entertainment President, said
"I was surprised that The Facts of Life performed well this season, as, with a major cast change and all, I thought it might not perform as it had in the past. Facts has been renewed for next season.""Web Brass Dissect Past Season" Variety April 22, 1987

===Final season===

In the final season, the series aired on NBC's Saturday night lineup at 8 p.m. NBC still had confidence in the series, making it the 8 p.m. anchor - kicking off the network's 2nd highest-rated nights (runner up to Cosby Thursdays). For February sweeps the writers created a storyline in this season for the episode titled "The First Time", in which Natalie became the first of the girls to lose her virginity. Lisa Whelchel refused this particular storyline that would have made her character, not Natalie, the first among the four young women in the show to lose her virginity. Having become a Christian when she was 10, Whelchel refused because of her Christian convictions. Whelchel appeared in every episode but asked to be written out of "The First Time".[tpl]cite book|last=Whelchel|first=Lisa |title=The Facts of Life: And Other Lessons My Father Taught Me|year=2001|publisher=Multnomah Books |isbn=1-576-73858-2|pages=35–37[/tpl]
In an article titled "Ratings Top with Teens" appearing in the January 19, 1988 edition of USA Today, The Facts of Life was ranked as one of the top 10 shows in a survey of 2,200 American teenagers.USA Today Information Network, Jan 19, 1988 When teenagers watch TV, they like to laugh.

==Cast==

===Casting===

Actress Geri Reischl ("Fake Jan" of The Brady Bunch Hour) was given the role of Blair Warner in the television pilot Garrett's Girls (later renamed The Facts of Life), but was forced to give it up due to her contract with General Mills.[tpl]cite book|title=Love To Love You Bradys: The Bizarre Story Of The Brady Bunch Variety Hour|year=2009|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-888-5|pages=267[/tpl]

===Recurring characters===

A key recurring character was Geri Tyler (Geri Jewell), Blair's cousin who has cerebral palsy. Other recurring characters included the judgment-impaired Miko Wakamatsu (Lauren Tom), the snobbish Boots St. Clair (Jami Gertz), and the royal princess Alexandra (Heather McAdam). Shoplifter Kelly (Pamela Segall) was billed as a regular during the fifth season. Other guest roles included the boyfriends of the girls; Jo's parents, played by Alex Rocco and Claire Malis; Blair's parents, played by Nicolas Coster and Marj Dusay (Blair's mother was played by Pam Huntington in one episode during the first season); Tootie's parents, played by Kim Fields' real-life mother, actress Chip Fields, and Robert Hooks; and Natalie's parents, played by Norman Burton and Mitzi Hoag. (Natalie's grandmother was played by Molly Picon, and appeared in two episodes.) A 1984 episode was built around Natalie coming to terms with the sudden death of her father. Characters from Diff'rent Strokes also appeared in some episodes of both season one and season two. Shawnte Northcutte from The New Mickey Mouse Club appeared as Madge in the 1980 episode "Who Am I?".

==Controversy==

===Geri Jewell===

The Facts of Life was one of the first television shows to feature a person with cerebral palsy as a recurring character.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0422434/bio|title=Geri Jewell – Biography @imdb| accessdate = 2008-07-18[/tpl] Indeed, actress Geri Jewell was the first person with a disability to have a regular role on a prime time series.http://www.greatwomenspeakers.com/Pages/speaker-pages/geri-jewell/Geri-Jewell.htm In an interview as part of an episode of E! True Hollywood Story, Jewell stated that she believed her character "cousin Geri" was going to continue as a recurring character on the show during the sixth season, but the producers offered her only one episode for the season because viewers would immediately assume that any episode with cousin Geri would be a "very special episode". Jewell stated that she stopped appearing on the show for that reason.

===Weight===

Another issue during the show's early seasons concerned the stars' appearances. Lisa Whelchel has stated in various interviews, including on E! True Hollywood Story, that the cast spent a lot of time on set doing nothing, so the natural inclination for many of them was to eat, as food was readily available all over the set. This noticeably affected the girls' appearances, leading Joan Rivers to dub them "The Fats of Life" during the cast's appearance at the Emmy Awards; the producers eventually restricted what the actors could eat while on set, and in an April 2011 interview, Lisa Whelchel stated that the producers sent her to various weight loss programs in an effort to help her lose weight.
Mindy Cohn, in the E! True Hollywood Story, stated that the situation was the exact opposite for her. She had been losing weight during this period due to an interest in dancing, and the producers asked her to stop because much of her character's identity hinged on the fact that she was overweight. Cohn said the producers compromised with her regarding her weight by dressing her in baggy clothing to make her appear heavier than she was.

==Ratings==

The Facts of Life was originally not a ratings winner on Friday nights in its summer debut in 1979 or in its second tryout in the spring of 1980. It ranked #74 out of 79 shows on the air in the year-end Nielsen ratings, and was NBC's lowest-rated series. The show was retooled in hiatus and brought back in a Wednesday time slot, where it flourished in its second season, ranking a respectably moderate #26 in the ratings. At the time, it was NBC's fourth highest-rated scripted series, after Little House on the Prairie, ' parent series Diff'rent Strokes, and CHiPs.1980-81 television ratings
The show ranked in the mid- and upper-20s in the ratings for its entire run. For its 7th season, it was moved to Saturdays at 8:30 PM, to bolster the premiering series The Golden Girls at 9 PM. The following season, the series was moved back a half-hour to the toughest time slot on television -  Saturday at 8 PM, which brought the ratings down to #31 in 1986–87 and #37 in 1987–88 - but Facts still easily won its timeslot.

==Attempted spin-offs==

The various attempts at spin-offs were backdoor pilots, which were shown as episodes of The Facts of Life.

==Production notes==

The Facts of Life was produced first by T.A.T. Communications Company, later known as Embassy Television (Norman Lear's production companies), and then as Embassy Communications, and Columbia Pictures Television (through ELP Communications) on January–May 1988 episodes of the series. Sony Pictures Television currently owns the distribution rights to the sitcom.
From 1979 to 1982, the show was produced at Metromedia Square in Los Angeles, California. In 1982, production moved to Universal City Studios and then to Sunset Gower Studios in 1985.

===Theme music===

The show's theme was composed by Al Burton, Gloria Loring, and her then-husband, Alan Thicke. The well-known opening lyric "You take the good, you take the bad..." came later as the first season lyrics, some of them performed by Rae, differed from those that followed. The original lyrics eventually shifted to the closing credits before being dropped entirely. Burton, Loring, and Thicke had previously composed the theme to Diff'rent Strokes, which was sung by Thicke.
