The Letter of Aristeas or Letter to Philocrates is a Hellenistic work of the 2nd century BCE, assigned by Biblical scholars to the Pseudepigrapha.Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. (Palo Alto: Mayfield) 1985; André Pelletier, SJ, La Lettre d'Aristée à Philocrate (Paris) 1962. JosephusAntiquities XII:ii passim (Online in Greek and English at York University) who paraphrases about two-fifths of the letter, ascribes it to Aristeas and to have been written to a certain Philocrates, describing the Greek translation of the Hebrew Law by seventy-two interpreters sent into Egypt from Jerusalem at the request of the librarian of Alexandria, resulting in the Septuagint translation. Though some have argued that its story of the creation of the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible is fictitious,The narrative is "open to the gravest suspicion, and the letter abounds with improbabilities and is now generally regarded as more or less fabulous," observed The Classical Review 335/6 (August–September 1919:123), reporting H. St.J. Thackeray's The Letter of Aristeas, with an Appendix of the Ancient Evidence on the Origin of the LXX.. it is the earliest text to mention the Library of Alexandria.

==History==

The letter of Aristeas, called so because it was a letter addressed from Aristeas to his brother Philocrates,[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/34391/Letter-of-Aristeas|title = Letter of Aristeas|publisher = Ecyclopedia Britannica Online |year = 2012 |accessdate= 14 August 2012[/tpl] deals primarily with the reason the Greek translation of the Hebrew Law, also called the Septuagint, was created, as well as the people and processes involved. Over twenty manuscripts of this letter are preserved. The letter is often mentioned and quoted in other texts, most notably Josephus's Antiquities of the Jews (c. 93 AD), Aristobolus writing in a passage preserved by Eusebius, and by Philo of Alexandria.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.veritasbible.com/resources/articles/Septuagint_Version|title = Origin of the Septuigant according to Tradition| first1=Achille| last1=Hereen| first2=Grande| last2 = Seminaire| first3=Belgium| last3=Bruges |publisher = Veritas Bible |date = 2009–2012 |work = Bible Source Texts Septuigant Version|accessdate= 14 August 2012 [/tpl] The letter's author alleges to be a courtier of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (reigned 281-246 BCE).
In detail, the work relates how the king of Egypt, presumably Ptolemy II Philadelphus, is urged by his chief librarian Demetrios of Phaleron to have the Hebrew Law translated into Greek, and so add the knowledge of the Hebrews to the vast collection of books the empire had already collected. The king responds favorably, including giving freedom to Jews who had been taken into captivity by his predecessors, and sending lavish gifts (which are described in great detail) to the Temple in Jerusalem along with his envoys. The high priest chooses exactly six men from each of the twelve tribes, giving 72 in all; he gives a long sermon in praise of the Law. When the translators arrive in Alexandria the king weeps for joy and for the next seven days puts philosophical questions to the translators, the wise answers to which are related in full. The 72 translators then complete their task in exactly 72 days. The Jews of Alexandria, on hearing the Law read in Greek, request copies and lay a curse on anyone who would change the translation. The king then rewards the translators lavishly and they return home.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.abu.nb.ca/courses/ntintro/intest/hist1.htm |title = Jewish History from Alexander to the Death of Seleucus IV Eupator (333-175 BCE)|author = Smith, Prof. Barry D. |publisher = Crandall University |date = 2 September 20010 |work = The Intertestamental Period |accessdate= 14 August 2012 [/tpl]
A main goal of the 2nd-century author seems to be to establish the superiority of the Greek Septuagint text over any other version of the Hebrew Bible. The author is noticeably pro-Greek, portraying Zeus as simply another name for the god of Israel, and while criticism is lodged against idolatry and Greek sexual ethics, the argument is phrased in such a way as to attempt to persuade the reader to change, rather than as a hostile attack. The manner in which the author concentrates on describing Judaism, and particularly its temple in Jerusalem could be viewed as an attempt to proselytise.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2012|reason=unsupported claims about author intention or implied purpose[/tpl]

==Criticism==

Demetrius, a client of Ptolemy I Soter, is not a good candidate as a collaborator with Ptolemy II Philadelphus. Roger S. Bagnall notes that he made the strategic mistake at the beginning of the reign of supporting Ptolemy's older half-brother, and was punished with internal exile, dying soon afterwards."Alexandria: Library of Dreams", Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 146.4 (December 2002:348-362) p. 348;
Philological analysis by Luis Vives, published in XXII libros de Civitate Dei Commentaria (1522), proposed that the pseudepigraphic letter was a forgery, being written by an author living half a century after Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285-246 B.C) and assuming the name of Aristeas. The inconsistencies and anachronisms of the author, examined and exposed first by Humphrey Hody (1659—1706);,Hody, Contra historiam Aristeae de LXX (Oxford) 1705, a reprint of his dissertation, Oxford, 1685. place the writing closer to 170-130 BCE. Hody's Oxford dissertation of 1685 provoked an "angry and scurrilous reply" from Isaac Vossius(1618–1689), who had been librarian to Queen Christina of Sweden, in the appendix to his Observations on Pomponius Mela, 1686, to which Hody conclusively replied in notes to his reprint of 1705.Sidney Jellicoe, The Septuagint and Modern Study, 1993:31. Due to this, the author of the letter of Aristeas is most often referred to as pseudo-Aristeas.Prosographia Ptolemaica 
Modern scholarship is unanimously with Hody. Victor Tcherikover (Hebrew University) summed up the scholarly consensus in 1958:
 "Modern scholars commonly regard the “Letter of Aristeas” as a work typical of Jewish apologetics, aiming at self-defense and propaganda, and directed to the Greeks.  Here are some instances illustrating this general view.  In 1903.  Friedlander wrote that the glorification of Judaism in the letter was no more than self-defense, though “the book does not mention the antagonists of Judaism by name, nor does it admit that its intention is to refute direct attacks.”   Stein sees in the letter “a special kind of defense, which practices diplomatic tactics,” and Tramontano also speaks of “an apologetic and propagandist tendency.”  Vincent characterizes it as “a small unapologetic novel written for the Egyptians” (i.e. the Greeks in Egypt).  Pheiffer says: “This fanciful story of the origin of the Septuagint is merely a pretext for defending Judaism against its  heathen denigrators, for extolling its nobility and reasonableness, and first striving to convert Greek speaking Gentiles to it.”  Schürer classes the letter with a special kind of literature, “Jewish propaganda in Pagan disguise,” whose works are “directed to the pagan reader, in order to make propaganda for Judaism among the Gentiles.”  Andrews, too, believes that the role of a Greek was assumed by Aristeas in order “to strengthen the force of the argument and commend it to non-Jewish readers. Even Gutman, who rightly recognizes that the Letter sprang 'from an inner need of the educated Jew,' sees in it 'a strong means for making Jewish propaganda in the Greek world.' ”V. Tcherikover, "The Ideology of the Letter of Aristeas" Harvard Theological Review 51.2 (April 1958), pp. 59-85 (JSTOR ref.) 
But Tcherikover continues,
 "In this article an attempt will be made to prove that the Letter of Aristeas was not written with the aim of self-defense or propaganda, and was addressed not to Greek, but to Jewish readers." 
In 2001, Bruce Metzger writes:
 Most scholars who have analyzed the letter have concluded that the author cannot have 
 been the man he represented himself to be but was a Jew who wrote a fictitious account in 
order to enhance the importance of the Hebrew Scriptures by suggesting that a pagan king had 
recognized their significance and therefore arranged for their translation into Greek.Metzger, B., The Bible in Translation (Baker Academic, 2001), p. 15.
Scholars avid for the scant information about the Library and the Musaeum of Alexandria, have depended on ps-Aristeas, who "has that least attractive quality in a source: to be trusted only where corroborated by better evidence, and there unneeded," Roger Bagnall concluded.Bagnall 2002:352.
