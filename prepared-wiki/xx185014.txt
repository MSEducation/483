Pinewood Halt railway station was a station on the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway in England. It served the northern parts of Hermitage and Oare both in Berkshire. The halt was opened on 11 September 1933 in the hope of increasing passenger traffic from people unwilling to walk the long distance to the next station. It closed in 1962.

==Facilities==

There was a single platform and shelter but an additional platform, also with a shelter, was later built with the addition of a passing loop. The station itself had no goods facilities,[tpl]cite book |last=Judge |first=C.W. |title=An Historical Survey of the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway |year=1984 |publisher=Oxford Publishing Co |location=Poole |isbn=0-86093-149-8 |page=43 |ref=harv [/tpl] but a couple of sidings were built to the north east of the station to serve the brickworks near the site.

Evidence of the trackwork for the brickworks sidings can still be seen, although these had been built privately and they predated the halt.Karau, P., Parsons, M. and Robertson, K.
