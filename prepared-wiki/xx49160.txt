==Biography==

===Early life===

Koji Kondo was born in Nagoya, Japan, on August 13, 1961. He began taking lessons in the electronic organ from the age of five. He improved his skills in the instrument in a cover band that played jazz and rock music. Kondo studied at the Art Planning Department of Osaka University of Arts,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.music4games.net/News_Display.aspx?id=506|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071110004822/http://www.music4games.net/News_Display.aspx?id=506|archivedate=2007-11-10|title=Mario and Zelda composer Koji Kondo shares all at GDC '07|publisher=Music4Games|date=2007-01-19|accessdate=2009-09-18[/tpl] but was never classically-trained or particularly dedicated to music. However, he gained some experience in composing and arranging pieces, using both the piano and a computer to assist him. During his senior year, Nintendo sent a recruitment message to his university stating that they were interested in hiring people dedicated to composition and sound programming. An LCD and arcade gamer, Kondo successfully applied for the job in 1984 without requiring any demo tapes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/composers/kondo/index.shtml|title=Koji Kondo|publisher=Square Enix Music Online|author=Chris|accessdate=2009-09-17[/tpl]

===Career===

Kondo was the first person hired by Nintendo for the purpose of creating compositions, and was to play an integral role in making the company's games and music recognizable worldwide. The first game he scored was the arcade game Punch-Out!!. Despite creating mostly jingles and sound effects, he was able to overcome the challenges of early arcade sound hardware. As the Famicom had become highly popular in Japan, Kondo was assigned to compose music for the console's subsequent games at Nintendo's new development team, Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development (EAD). Kondo also wrote an instruction manual on how to program Japanese popular music into the Famicom using the peripheral Family BASIC. To conclude his first year at Nintendo, he created the music to Devil World alongside Akito Nakatsuka. In 1985, Nintendo started marketing the Famicom abroad under the name the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) to capitalize on the 1983 video game crash that devastated Atari, Inc. He composed the music for the hit releases Super Mario Bros. (1985)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/super-mario-bros/techinfo|title=Super Mario Bros. Tech Info|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2009-09-18[/tpl] and The Legend of Zelda (1986)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/legendofzelda/techinfo|title=The Legend of Zelda Tech Info|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2009-09-18[/tpl] which helped the system to sell 60 million copies in total and established some of the most well-known melodies in the video game industry.
Super Mario Bros., for many years the best-selling video game of all time, was Kondo's first major score. The game's melodies were created with the intention that short segments of music could be endlessly repeated during the same gameplay without causing boredom. Kondo's soundtrack to Super Mario Bros. gained worldwide recognition, and is to this day the most well-known video game score. The main theme is iconic in popular culture and has been featured in over 50 concerts, been a best-selling ringtone,[tpl]cite web|url=http://moconews.net/article/top-selling-ringtones-in-us-for-2006/|title=Top Selling Ringtones In US For 2006|publisher=mocoNews|first=James Quintana|last=Pearce|date=2007-01-04|accessdate=2009-09-21[/tpl] and been remixed or sampled by various musicians. Kondo's work on The Legend of Zelda scores has also become highly recognized. He produced four main pieces of background music for the first installment of the series; the overworld theme has become comparable in popularity with the Super Mario Bros. main theme. Following the success of The Legend of Zelda, he provided the score for two Japanese-exclusive titles, Nazo no Murasame Jō (1986) and Shin Onigashima (1987). He also created the soundtrack to Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic (1987), which was later rebranded outside of Japan as Super Mario Bros. 2 in 1988.[tpl]cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/833/833615p2.html|title=IGN Presents The History of Super Mario Bros.|publisher=IGN|first=Rus|last=McLaughlin|date=2007-11-08|accessdate=2009-09-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/super-mario-bros-2/techinfo|title=Super Mario Bros. 2 Tech Info|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2009-09-21[/tpl]
Kondo returned to the Super Mario series to produce the scores to Super Mario Bros. 3 (1988) and the SNES launch title Super Mario World (1990). Koichi Sugiyama directed a jazz arrangement album of Super Mario World[tpl]'[/tpl]s music and oversaw its performance at the first Orchestral Game Music Concert in 1991. After finishing the soundtrack to Super Mario World, Kondo was in charge of the sound programming for Pilotwings, and created the sound effects for Star Fox. In 1995 he composed for the sequel to Super Mario World, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. Until the Nintendo 64 era, Kondo would usually write all compositions for a game, ending with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time as the last score on which he worked alone.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/03/72971 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wSqL8j29 |archivedate=2011-02-13 |title=Behind the Mario Maestro's Music |date=2007-03-15 |author=Kohler, Chris |work=Wired |publisher=Condé Nast Digital |accessdate=2011-02-13[/tpl] Since then, he has been collaborating with other staff members at Nintendo EAD, supervising music created by others, as well as providing additional compositions for games such as Super Mario Galaxy, The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks and The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword.[tpl]cite AV media notes |title=Super Mario Galaxy Original Sound Track Platinum Version |url=http://vgmdb.net/album/5411 |year=2008 |publisher=Nintendo Co., Ltd.[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/news/mario-music |title=How Mario Music Gets Made |author=Gifford, Kevin |date=2010-02-24 |work=1UP.com |publisher=UGO Entertainment, Inc. |accessdate=2010-12-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.originalsoundversion.com/koji-kondo-talks-ocarina-of-time-gives-details-on-skyward-sword/ |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zdCAJDVF |archivedate=June 22, 2011 |title=Koji Kondo Talks Ocarina of Time, Gives Details on Skyward Sword |date=June 21, 2011 |author=Napolitano, Jayson |work=Original Sound Version |accessdate=June 22, 2011[/tpl]
