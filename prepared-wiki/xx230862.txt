When the Society reached its 150th birthday in 2011, it celebrated with a year of special events including a ‘Big Birthday Bash’ playing host to Lulu and indie rock band Scouting For Girls. It renovated a 1970s ‘birthday bus’ and an exhibition was held at The Museum of Lincolnshire Life, showcasing the Society’s eventful history and a memory book, where members had shared comments about their Co-op from over the years.
