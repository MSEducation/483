Irún is located on the northeastern coast of Spain, between the French border and the city of San Sebastian.  The town was defended by 3,000 Republicans, including CNT militia, Asturian miners, Basque nationalists, and French communist volunteers.  Major Beorlegui's force was smaller, but it included 155 mm artillery, German light tanks, [[Junkers Ju 52|Junkers 
Ju 52]] bombers, and a 700-man bandera from the Spanish Foreign Legion.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1931-1939. Penguin Books. 2006. London. p.116

==The battle==

The Nationalist ships España (battleship), Almirante Cervera (cruiser), and Velasco (destroyer) bombarded the town on August 11.  The main fighting took place on the Puntza ridge south of the town.  The peak of the battle occurred at the convent of San Marcial, which was defended by Asturian miners and militia who threw dynamite and rocks when they ran out of ammunition.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1931-1939. Penguin Books. 2006. London. p.116
The French had closed the border with Spain on August 8, leading to a shortage of ammunition and supplies on the Republican side.  When the Republicans finally abandoned the town, they set it on fire to destroy anything that might aid the Nationalists.  During the duration of the war, when the Nationalists would bombard, then occupy a town, they would announce that the Republicans had destroyed it, citing the example of Irún.  Beorlegui was wounded by a sniper's bullet when he entered the town.  He refused to have the wound treated and soon died from gangrene.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1931-1939. Penguin Books. 2006. London. p.117
