Flying Officer Raimund Sanders Draper (born London, England, 1914; died age 29, 24 March 1943), known as "Smudge", was an American volunteer World War II Royal Air Force (RAF) pilot of No. 64 Squadron. He deliberately crashed his Spitfire aircraft, in order to avoid hitting a school, after losing control on take-off from RAF Hornchurch, and was killed.

The aircraft bounced and a wing stuck the building.
Only one student, 13 year old Richard (Dick) Burton (sometimes Barten,) was injured, with 5 other students treated for minor shock.
One of the students who witnessed the accident recalled:Sanders Draper History
 At 10.45am an aircraft crashed on the playing field, the main parts being ricocheted onto the drive, fragments breaking a total of 9 windows in three classrooms. Splinters from the 'plane scored the wall and injured the playing field and shrubbery. Richard Burton received a cut on the leg from flying glass needing medical attention and five boys were treated from primary shock. The boy with the injured leg was conveyed to his home by ambulance, under Dr. Heath's orders. School was evacuated to shelter for 15 mins. owing to probability of danger from fire and exploding ammunition. By 11.15am the school had resumed normal work. 
In 1973 the school was renamed Sanders Draper School in his honour.A History of the County of Essex: Volume 7 A plaque on the building marks the point of impact and the schools's badge incorporates a Spitfire. An annual memorial service is held at his grave by men who were pupils at the school at the time of his death.
