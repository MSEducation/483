==Overview==

===Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell===

Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell was developed in 2 years after which it was published and released by  Ubisoft for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, Windows, and Mac OS X in North America on November 19, 2002. It uses an Unreal Engine 2 that was modified to allow the light-and-dark based gameplay. A HD remastered edition of the game was released on the  PlayStation Network in late 2010. To date the game has sold over 3 million copies and won IGN's Best of 2002: Xbox Game of The Year.

===Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow===

Pandora Tomorrow was developed by Ubisoft Shanghai and introduced multiplayer gameplay to the Splinter Cell series. In single-player mode, the game AI adapts to adjust to the player's skill level.[tpl]cite web|last=Thorsen |first=Tor |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6086055.html |title=Pandora Tomorrow to adopt adaptive AI – News at GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=January 5, 2004 |accessdate=August 26, 2011[/tpl]S.

===Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory===

Ubisoft Montreal was again responsible for the third game in the series, Chaos Theory. It adds a cooperative multiplayer mode.[tpl]cite web|last=Surette |first=Tim |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6120913.html |title=Splinter Cell Chaos Theory golden – News at GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=March 22, 2005 |accessdate=August 26, 2011[/tpl] Originally announced to be released in Fall 2004, its initial releases were made at the end of March 2005. Again the Unreal Engine was heavily modified, this time from version 2.5.

===Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Essentials===

Essentials extends the Splinter Cell series to the PSP platform. Through a series of flashback missions, the player learns more about Sam Fisher's back story. The game's critical reception was much worse than the other games in the series. While the graphics were considered high-quality for the PSP, the multiplayer was considered almost unplayable. The game was also criticized for not being able to be played on the go, because it requires a dark environment. [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]

===Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent===

For the series' fourth installment, two separate versions were created, one for generation six consoles and the Wii and the other for Xbox360 and PC. Double Agent features a "trust system"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/splintercell4/review.html |title=Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent Review for Xbox 360 |publisher=GameSpot |date=October 17, 2006 |accessdate=August 26, 2011[/tpl] that presents the player with moral dilemmas. It is the first game in the series with a hub like area, where Sam can explore and do objectives between missions. This is also the only game in the series to have different endings, based on player decisions. Only one ending is used to continue the storyline.

===Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction===

Conviction was officially announced on May 23, 2007 when Ubisoft released a trailer for the game. The game was due for release on November 16, 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://xbox.joystiq.com/2007/06/19/ubisoft-dates-its-winter-titles/|title=Ubisoft dates its winter titles|last=Mitchell|first=Richard| date=June 19, 2007|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=December 20, 2009[/tpl] However, the game missed its initial launch date, and on May 19, 2008, it was reported that Splinter Cell: Conviction was "officially on hold" and that the game had been taken "back to the drawing board".[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=189247| work=CVG| title=Splinter Cell Conviction "back to the drawing board"|date=May 19, 2008|accessdate=April 6, 2009[/tpl] Ubisoft announced that the game had been pushed back to the 2009–10 fiscal year.
At E3 2009, the developers confirmed that the "new" Conviction had been in development since early 2008, commenting that "the gameplay has evolved a lot" and "the visual direction is simply much better".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/09/22/rumor-splinter-cell-conviction-escapes-original-gameplay-visu/| work=Joystiq| title=Splinter Cell: Conviction escapes original gameplay, visual design|date=September 22, 2008|accessdate=April 6, 2009[/tpl] The game's release date was pushed back several times.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/sc-conviction-delayed-for-polish|title=Splinter Cell delayed|publisher=Eurogamer| date=January 14, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6249491.html|title=Splinter Cell: Conviction infiltrates April 13|publisher=GameSpot|date=February 4, 2010|accessdate=February 5, 2010[/tpl] On March 18, 2010, the demo was released for Xbox 360.[tpl]cite web|last=Fajardo |first=Mark |url=http://www.justpushstart.com/2010/03/18/splinter-cell-conviction-demo-now-available/ |title=Splinter Cell: Conviction Demo Now Available |publisher=Just Push Start |date=March 18, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2011[/tpl]
Ubisoft wanted to make the fifth game more accessible.[tpl]cite web|author=Tom Ivan |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/ubisoft-felt-splinter-cell-was-too-hardcore |title=Ubisoft Felt Splinter Cell Was Too Hardcore' – Edge Magazine |publisher=Next-gen.biz |date=April 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2011[/tpl] so Conviction was designed around the new core elements "Mark and Execute" and "Last Known Position", while stealth elements present in the previous games were omitted, such as the ability to whistle, lock picking, hiding bodies, etc. Conviction uses a cover system and adds simple interrogation sequences to the series.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/tomclancyssplintercellconviction/review.html |title=Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction Review for Xbox 360 |publisher=GameSpot |date=April 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2011[/tpl]

===Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist===

Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist is the sixth installment in the Splinter Cell series developed by Ubisoft Toronto and published by Ubisoft and was released on August 20, 2013. Splinter Cell: Blacklist boasts new features combining gameplay from Chaos Theory and Conviction. Series veteran Michael Ironside was replaced in his role as Sam Fisher by actor Eric Johnson. In the game, Sam Fisher has been appointed as the commander of the new "Fourth Echelon", a clandestine unit that answers solely to the President of the United States. She has denied any existence of the agency and Fourth Echelon is working to stop a new terror plot known as the 'Blacklist'.  Fourth Echelon also has the secondary objective of stopping all operations in which Third Echelon is still running. Features returning include a moving "Mark and Execute", Sam's signature goggles and a new knife, the Karambit, and the ability to perform "abduction" stealth melee takedowns.

===Future===

According to an interview with Blacklist art director Scott Lee in March 2013, a seventh Splinter Cell is in development for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles. “For next-gen there are a lot of plans in the works, obviously we can’t talk about that at the moment but I definitely look forward to seeing Sam in new adventures, bigger and better as we go along." Lee stated during the interview. “Sam will be back.”[tpl]cite web|last=Seeto|first=Damian|title=Splinter Cell Will Be Back On PS4 And Xbox One In The Near Future|url=http://www.justpushstart.com/2013/05/splinter-cell-will-be-back-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-in-the-near-future/|publisher=Just Push Start|accessdate=5 November 2013[/tpl]

The book starts off with a ship by the name of Trego sailing towards the American east coast.  Sam Fisher is called in from a training mission to disable the ship.  After Fisher stops the ship from disemboweling the American west coast with nuclear waste he is informed that a town by the name of Slipstone has just been radioactively attacked and 5,000+ people are dead.

==Common elements==

===Plot and themes===

The first game explains that "Splinter Cell" refers to an elite recon-type unit of single covert operatives (such as Sam Fisher) who are supported in the field by a high-tech remote team.
In the first three games (Splinter Cell, Pandora Tomorrow, Chaos Theory), terrorists are planning attacks, usually by use of information warfare, which Sam Fisher, an operative for Third Echelon, a secret branch of the NSA, must prevent. The missions range from gathering intelligence to capturing and/or eliminating terrorists.
In the fourth game, Double Agent, Fisher assumes the identity of a wanted criminal in order to infiltrate a terrorist ring.
The fifth game, Conviction, starts after events in the conclusion of Double Agent: Sam has abandoned Third Echelon. When he discovers that the death of his daughter Sarah had not been an accident (as had been purported at the beginning of Double Agent), he strikes out on his own in search of those responsible until Sam's investigation uncovers a conspiracy within his old agency.
In the sixth and most recent game, Blacklist, Third Echelon has been disbanded by the President of the United States. A new outfit, Fourth Echelon, is formed by the President and placed under the command of Sam Fisher with the mission of stopping the Blacklist attacks and the organization behind them.

====Trident goggles====

A device used for seeing in the dark features strongly in the series. Originally, Tom Clancy had rejected the idea of Sam Fisher having these "trident goggles", having stated that such goggles (with both thermal vision and night vision) were impossible to make. The creators argued that having two separate sets of goggles would have made for awkward gameplay and convinced Clancy to allow it. This also gave the Splinter Cell series a recognizable signature, a desirable feature.[tpl]cite video game |title=Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory Limited Edition |developer=Ubisoft Montreal |publisher = Ubisoft |date=March 28, 2005 |platform=Xbox [/tpl] Chaos Theory added a third view that shows the path of electricity in the area, mainly electrical cables and any device that has electrical power, like TVs, computers, etc. Conviction allows a third module to be accessed, a sonar module that can scan through walls for interactable objects, such as weapons, people, and consoles.
The trident goggles however, didn't remain completely fictional. In 2004, Northrop Grumman produced and delivered one such device. The device, called Fused Multispectral Weapon Sight (FMWS) was capable of combining thermal and intensified imaging.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irconnect.com/noc/press/pages/news_releases.html?d=65353 |title=Northrop Grumman Delivers First Fused Multispectral Weapon Sight to U.S. Army |publisher=Irconnect.com |date=October 12, 2004 |accessdate=August 26, 2011[/tpl] Later in 2007, ITT Industries developed another such device, designated AN/PSQ-20.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Electro-Optic-Systems/ITT-Night-Vision-AN-PSQ-20-Enhanced-Night-Vision-Goggle-ENVG-United-States.html|title=ITT Night Vision AN/PSQ-20 Enhanced Night-Vision Goggle (ENVG) (United States), Land systems – Observation and surveillance – Image intensifier goggles (NVGs)|date=October 19, 2009|publisher=Jane's Information Group|accessdate=March 16, 2010[/tpl]

===Characters===

The characters of the games, as well as the organization "Third Echelon", were created by J. T. Petty. The main recurring ones are:

===Gameplay===

The encouraged way to progress through the games is to remain hidden, select non-obvious routes, and utilize diversions to pass guards. The first game in the series only features a single-player mode, Pandora Tomorrow introduces a two-on-two multiplayer mode. Chaos Theory further develops that mode and introduces a cooperative mode. Cooperative mode plays similarly to the single player mode, but adds situations that can only be overcome as a team. The cooperative storylines in Chaos Theory and the sixth generation version of Double Agent parallel those of Sam's actions in the single-player modes, letting players act on information he obtained or provide support in the field.
Double Agent introduces a morality factor: Fisher may now encounter conflicting objectives between his superiors and the terrorists. For example, the terrorists may assign a mission to assassinate someone, while the NSA simultaneously instructs the player to prevent the assassination. This creates a delicate balancing act between gaining the trust of the terrorists and fulfilling the mission assignments. In addition, Fisher must not do anything to reveal to the terrorists that he is a double agent (such as let himself be seen with an NSA gadget), otherwise he will lose instantly.
Conviction utilizes a much faster and more violent form of stealth action gameplay than previous games in the series. It retains the cooperative multiplayer mode of the two preceding games.
The weapons that Sam Fisher uses are based more accurately on current real-world weapons which behave accordingly and all weapons can be upgraded by a points system. This points system is secondary to the main storyline and is achievement based. These points may be used to add silencers, sights, upgraded ammo, laser targeting and other upgrades, with up to three upgrades per weapon.
This game provides an interactive mission update sequence that is built into the levels themselves. Instead of getting an objective-bar popup, the objective may appear in bold white text on the side of a building or in front of a barricade. This adds to the immersion and keeps the HUD uncluttered. The stealth element of the game allows Fisher to hide in the shadows and become almost invisible. Guards may be assassinated by unsuppressed or silenced weapons, gadgets, or hand-to-hand combat. After successfully completing a hand-to-hand kill, the player is provided with an 'execution' bonus, which allows the player to mark two to four targets (depending on the weapon selected) such as enemies or objects, and trigger the execution animation. Fisher will then dispatch all targets within a few seconds in an extraordinary fashion.
Interactive interrogation cutscenes where Fisher beats up a target for information do not require the player to do anything other than press Interrogate. Though if the player happens to be near an interactive object like a television or table, Fisher may use that to alter the standard animation.

==Development and history==

===Origin===

According to Splinter Cell series producer Mathieu Ferland, the original game was developed so that Ubisoft's Montreal studio could demonstrate its full potential.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/splintercell/news.html?sid=2882240&mode=previews|title=Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Q&A|date=October 2, 2002|accessdate=February 21, 2011[/tpl] After Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six and Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon, "special ops was the natural next step" for Tom Clancy-endorsed games.

===Graphics and technology===

The first game in the series modified the Unreal Engine to allow the light-and-dark-based gameplay style. The other games continued this, using updated versions of the engine.
By the release of the latest game – Blacklist – the engine had been upgraded to the LEAD engine, a heavily modified version of the Unreal Engine 2.5. The game had active shadows on all consoles not simply as a graphical function – as in most games – but as a gameplay enhancer for the sake of the game's stealth features. This meant that more coding for the game was required and overall, required a powerful desktop computer in order to get the best clarity and performance.
