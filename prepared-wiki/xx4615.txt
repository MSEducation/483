The Institut des hautes études scientifiques (I.H.É.S.) (English: Institute of Advanced Scientific Studies) is a French institute supporting advanced research in mathematics and theoretical physics. It is located in Bures-sur-Yvette just south of Paris.

==History==

The IHÉS, was founded in 1958 by businessman and mathematical physicist Léon Motchane with the help of Robert Oppenheimer and Jean Dieudonné as a research centre in France, on model to the renowned Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, United States.[tpl]cite web|title=On the occasion of receiving the Seki Takakazu Prize|url=http://mathsoc.jp/publication/tushin/1203/IHES12-3.pdf|publisher=Mathematical Society of Japan[/tpl]
The strong personality of Alexandre Grothendieck and the broad sweep of his revolutionizing theories were a dominating feature of the first ten years at the IHÉS.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] René Thom received an invitation from IHÉS in 1963 and after his appointment remained there until his retirement in 1988.[tpl]cite book|last=edited by Lawrence D..

The IHÉS runs a highly regarded mathematical journal, Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS.
IHÉS celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008
