Ben Alexander (13 September 1971 â€“ 21 June 1992) was an Australian rugby league player for the Penrith Panthers in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership, he was the younger brother of Australian Rugby League international Greg Alexander. His position of choice was at hooker or in the halves.
He made his first grade debut in the 1990 season. On 21 June 1992, at the age of just 20, Alexander was killed in a car accident in Colyton, a suburb in western Sydney. It was later reported that his blood alcohol level was 0.14, almost three times the legal limit of 0.05. The tragic event occurred on a night that was meant to be one of celebration for the Panthers - as it was the night they were presented with premiership blazers for their 1991 success.
