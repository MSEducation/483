The 44th Infantry Regiment was formed in 1921 and became a Philippine Scout unit and joined the Philippine Division. In 1922, the unit was deactivated.
The Philippine Division, now redesignated the 12th Infantry Division (PS), was reactivated in 1946, along with its component units, primarily to compensate for the demobilization of American army units.
