===Queen of the South===

When Gordon Chisholm was promoted to the role as manager of Dumfries club Queen of the South in the 2007 close season, he appointed Brannigan as his assistant. This coincided with chairman Davie Rae announcing that the club would go full-time. Chisholm and Brannigan guided Queens to only their second ever Scottish Cup semi-final appearance with a 2–0 quarter final victory against Dundee. Queens followed this with a 4–3 win against Aberdeen in the semi-final, which meant that they reached their first ever Scottish Cup Final appearance. Despite second half Queens goals by Steve Tosh and Jim Thomson, Rangers ran out 3–2 winners in the final.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.qosfc.com/History |title=Club History |publisher=Qosfc.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-21[/tpl]

Brannigan was reported as saying that the promotion had come "as a bit of a surprise".[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/q/queen_of_the_south/8580203.stm |title=Kenny Brannigan surprised to be Queen of the South boss  |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=23 March 2010 [/tpl]
