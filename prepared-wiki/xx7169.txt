The International Numbering System (INS) for Food Additives is a European-based naming system for food additives, aimed at providing a short designation of what may be a lengthy actual name."Class Names and the International Numbering System for Food Additives", CAC/GL 36-1989
==Numbering system==

The International Numbering System numbers (INS) consist of three or four digits, optionally followed by an alphabetical suffix to further characterize individual additives. On packaging in the European Union, approved food additives are written with a prefix of 'E'. Australia and New Zealand do not use a prefix letter when listing additives in the ingredients. An additive that appears in the INS does not automatically have a corresponding E-number.
The International Numbering System numbers below (INS #) are assigned by the committee to identify each food additive. The INS numbers generally correspond to E numbers for the same compound – e.g. INS 102, Tartrazine, is also E-102. INS numbers are not unique and, in fact, one number may be assigned to a group of like compounds.
