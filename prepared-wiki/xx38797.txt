===Rural America in a New Century===

Rural America in a New Century was an October 1999 report by Mark Drabenstott, for the Center for the Study of Rural America's newsletter The Main Street Economist.
In the introduction the report notes that the farm economy is in a deep slump and that there are major economic challenges facing rural communities within the U.S.. The second section is titled, "A new farm crisis?" and argues that it is important that the government expands its assistance to rural communities. The article also questions whether concentrated and corporatized agriculture will be beneficial to the majority of rural communities and states, "Agricultural policy no longer cures rural ills."
