[[Pairing function]]

CATEGORIES: Set theory

In mathematics a pairing function is a process to uniquely encode two natural numbers into a single natural number.
Any pairing function can be used in set theory to prove that integers and rational numbers have the same cardinality as natural numbers. In theoretical computer science they are used to encode a function defined on a vector of natural numbers f:Nk → N into a new function g:N → N.

==Definition==

A pairing function is a primitive recursive bijection

==Cantor pairing function==

The Cantor pairing function is a pairing function 
defined by 
This definition can be inductively generalized to the Cantor tuple function
as

===Inverting the Cantor pairing function===

Suppose we are given z with 
and we want to find x and y. It is helpful to define some intermediate values in the calculation: 
where t is the triangle number of w. If we solve the quadratic equation 
for w as a function of t, we get 
which is a strictly increasing and continuous function when t is non-negative real. Since 
we get that 
and thus 
So to calculate x and y from z, we do:
Since the Cantor pairing function is invertible, it must be one-to-one and onto.
