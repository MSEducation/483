Spike Island is an island in the estuary of the River Mersey, in North West England, flanked by the Sankey Canal.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.penninewaterways.co.uk/sankey/sa49.htm |title=Spike Island and Widnes Lock - Sankey Canal |publisher=penninewaterways.co.uk |accessdate=8 March 2013[/tpl] It is a reclaimed toxic waste site, considered a birthplace of the British chemical industry, and forms a part of Widnes in the Halton borough of Cheshire. 
Its maze of abandoned chemical factories, rail lines, canal and industrial dockage, and industrial pollution, which had declined into a rust belt toxic wilderness, was reclaimed as woodland, wetlands and green space between 1975 and 1982. A surviving warehouse is now the home of the Catalyst Museum, the only science museum in the UK solely devoted to chemistry.
Spike Island was the site of a famous outdoor concert by The Stone Roses in May 1990. A film about the concert was released in 2013, and is called Spike Island.[tpl]cite web|last=Wright |first=Jade |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-entertainment/echo-entertainment/2012/03/26/new-film-to-relive-the-stone-roses-classic-gig-at-spike-island-in-widnes-100252-30622394/ |title=New film to relive The Stone Rosesâ€™ classic gig at Spike Island in Widnes - ECHO Entertainment News - Entertainment |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |date=26 March 2012 |accessdate=31 March 2012[/tpl]
