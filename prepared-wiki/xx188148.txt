[[Amar de Nuevo]]

CATEGORIES: 1999 albums

Amar De Nuevo is a 1999 album by Chilean Group Inti-Illimani,
in which they explore the heritage of Latin American Creole music in lush,
sensual arrangements that sound as if they've come directly from the '40s 
or '50s--quite remarkable for what are mostly original compositions.
