===Accident===

Wallis became comatose when he suffered a major automobile accident where his pickup truck skidded off a small bridge near Stone County, Arkansas, on July 13, 1984, which resulted in one of his friends being killed. The pickup truck was found upside down in a dry riverbed and Wallis smashed into a railing fence and fell 25 feet. He was found to be unresponsive and was immobilized but breathing. The accident left him a quadriplegic. Within a year of the accident, the coma stabilized into a minimally conscious state but doctors believed his condition would never recover.[tpl]citeweb|title=US man wakes from 19-year coma|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3052433.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=July 9, 2003[/tpl][tpl]citeweb|title=Man speaks after 19-year silence|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2003-07-07/us/mute.no.more_1_nursing-home-terry-wallis-pickup-truck?_s=PM:US|publisher=CNN|accessdate=July 8, 2003[/tpl][tpl]citeweb|title=Mute 19 Years, He Helps Reveal Brain's Mysteries|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/04/health/psychology/04coma.html?_r=1|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=July 4, 2006[/tpl][tpl]citeweb|title=Man's brain rewired itself, doctors contend|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/07/04/mans_brain_rewired_itself_doctors_contend/|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=July 4, 2006[/tpl]
In 2003 he awakened from his minimal conscious state and began to talk; when a nurse asked him who the lady walking toward him was, he replied "mama". He believed that he was still 20 and that it was still 1984. His muscles remained weak as his family could not afford physiotherapy, but he gradually recovered over a three day "awakening period" in which he regained the ability to control some parts of his body and to speak to others. However, he remains disabled from injuries suffered during the original accident, including the motor disorder dysarthria. 
Wallis was the subject of the BodyShock special for 2005 "The Man Who Slept For 19 Years" made for Channel 4 in the UK.Body and Mind It shows his mother and daughter encouraging him to talk to neurologists to try to find out how Wallis had regained speech after such a long time. The program featured several well-known doctors, including Dr. Caroline McCagg, the medical director of the JFK Center for head injury in New Jersey, Dr. Joe Giacino, a neuropsychologist who said Terry's brain retained lots of information from before 1984 but hardly any after 1984 because Wallis lost the ability to store new memories and was essentially amnestic, and Dr. Martin Gizzi, a neurologist who showed that, owing to damage to the frontal lobes, he could not process experiences into memories. Also featured in the program was the neuropsychologist professor Roger Llewellyn Wood.
Using new technology, brain scans were done on Wallis by Nicholas Schiff of Weill Cornell Medical College.'Rewired brain' revives patient after 19 years from New Scientist Accessed July 2006 The hypothesis built from the imaging studies is that Wallis's brain reconnected neurons which remained intact and formed new connections to circumvent damaged areas.
