More than 80% of men will develop prostate cancer by the age of 80.Bostwick, David G.; Eble, John N. (2007). Urological Surgical Pathology. St. Louis: Mosby. p. 468. ISBN 0-323-01970-6.  However, in the majority of cases, it will be slow-growing and harmless.  In such men, diagnosing prostate cancer is overdiagnosis—the needless identification of a technically aberrant condition that will never harm the patient—and treatment in such men exposes them to all of the adverse effects, with no possibility of extending their lives.

==History==

Although the prostate was first described by Venetian anatomist Niccolò Massa in 1536, and illustrated by Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius in 1538, prostate cancer was not identified until 1853.[tpl]cite journal | author = Adams J | title = The case of scirrhous of the prostate gland with corresponding affliction of the lymphatic glands in the lumbar region and in the pelvis | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue =  | pages =  | year = 1853 | pmid =  | doi =  [/tpl][tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] Prostate cancer was initially considered a rare disease, probably because of shorter life expectancies and poorer detection methods in the 19th century. The first treatments of prostate cancer were surgeries to relieve urinary obstruction.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lytton B | title = Prostate cancer: a brief history and the discovery of hormonal ablation treatment | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 165 | issue = 6 Pt 1 | pages = 1859–62 |date=June 2001 | pmid = 11371867 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-5347(05)66228-3 [/tpl] Removal of the entire gland (radical perineal prostatectomy) was first performed in 1904 by Hugh H. Young at Johns Hopkins Hospital.[tpl]cite journal | author = Young HH | title = Four cases of radical prostatectomy | journal = Johns Hopkins Bull. | volume = 16 | issue =  | pages =  | year = 1905 | pmid =  | doi =  [/tpl] Surgical removal of the testes (orchiectomy) to treat prostate cancer was first performed in the 1890s, but with limited success. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) replaced radical prostatectomy for symptomatic relief of obstruction in the middle of the 20th century because it could better preserve penile erectile function. Radical retropubic prostatectomy was developed in 1983 by Patrick Walsh.[tpl]cite journal | author = Walsh PC, Lepor H, Eggleston JC | title = Radical prostatectomy with preservation of sexual function: anatomical and pathological considerations | journal = The Prostate | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 473–85 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6889192 | doi = 10.1002/pros.2990040506 [/tpl] This surgical approach allowed for removal of the prostate and lymph nodes with maintenance of penile function.
In 1941, Charles B. Huggins published studies in which he used estrogen to oppose testosterone production in men with metastatic prostate cancer. This discovery of "chemical castration" won Huggins the 1966 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.[tpl]cite journal | author = Huggins CB, Hodges CV | title = Studies on prostate cancer: 1.

Schally and Roger Guillemin, who both won the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work. GnRH receptor agonists, such as leuprolide and goserelin, were subsequently developed and used to treat prostate cancer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Schally AV, Kastin AJ, Arimura A | title = Hypothalamic follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH)-regulating hormone: structure, physiology, and clinical studies | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 22 | issue = 11 | pages = 703–21 |date=November 1971 | pmid = 4941683 | doi =  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Tolis G, Ackman D, Stellos A, Mehta A, Labrie F, Fazekas AT, Comaru-Schally AM, Schally AV | title = Tumor growth inhibition in patients with prostatic carcinoma treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists | journal = Proc.

Radiation therapy for prostate cancer was first developed in the early 20th century and initially consisted of intraprostatic radium implants. External beam radiotherapy became more popular as stronger X-ray radiation sources became available in the middle of the 20th century. Brachytherapy with implanted seeds (for prostate cancer) was first described in 1983.[tpl]cite journal | author = Denmeade SR, Isaacs JT | title = A history of prostate cancer treatment | journal = Nature Reviews Cancer | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | pages = 389–96 |date=May 2002 | pmid = 12044015 | doi = 10.1038/nrc801 [/tpl]
Systemic chemotherapy for prostate cancer was first studied in the 1970s. The initial regimen of cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil was quickly joined by multiple regimens using a host of other systemic chemotherapy drugs.[tpl]cite journal | author = Scott WW, Johnson DE, Schmidt JE, Gibbons RP, Prout GR, Joiner JR, Saroff J, Murphy GP | title = Chemotherapy of advanced prostatic carcinoma with cyclophosphamide or 5-fluorouracil: results of first national randomized study | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 114 | issue = 6 | pages = 909–11 |date=December 1975 | pmid = 1104900 | doi =  [/tpl]

===Cell-of-origin===

A series of studies published in Science involved introduced viruses known to cause cancerous mutation in prostate cells: AKT, ERG, and AR into isolated samples of basal and luminal cells and grafted the treated tissue into mice. After 16 weeks, none of the luminal samples had undergone malignant mutation, while the basal samples had mutated into prostate-like tubules which had then developed malignancy and formed cancerous tumors, which appeared identical to human samples under magnification. This led to the conclusion that the prostate basal cell may be the most likely "site of origin" of prostate cancer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Goldstein AS, Huang J, Guo C, Garraway IP, Witte ON | title = Identification of a cell of origin for human prostate cancer | journal = Science | volume = 329 | issue = 5991 | pages = 568–71 |date=July 2010 | pmid = 20671189 | pmc = 2917982 | doi = 10.1126/science.1189992 [/tpl]

==Society and culture==

People with prostate cancer generally encounter significant disparities in awareness, funding, media coverage, and research—and therefore, inferior treatment and poorer outcomes—compared to other cancers of equal prevalence.[tpl]cite web|last=Arnst |first=Catherine |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2007/tc20070612_953676.htm |title=A Gender Gap in Cancer |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=2007-06-13 |accessdate=2011-08-29[/tpl] In 2001, The Guardian noted that Britain had 3,000 nurses specializing in breast cancer, compared to only one for prostate cancer. It also discovered that the waiting time between referral and diagnosis was two weeks for breast cancer but three months for prostate cancer.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2001/oct/07/cancercare | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Anthony | last=Browne | title=Cancer bias puts breasts first | date=2001-10-07[/tpl] A 2007 report by the U.S.-based National Prostate Cancer Coalition stated that for every prostate cancer drug on the market, there were seven used to treat breast cancer. The Times also noted an "anti-male bias in cancer funding" with a four to one discrepancy in the United Kingdom by both the government and by cancer charities such as Cancer Research UK.Men lose out in battle for cancer cash - Times Online[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] Equality campaigners such as author Warren Farrell cite such stark spending inequalities as a clear example of governments unfairly favouring women's health over men's health.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=mRkqAAAAYAAJ&dq=prostate+cancer+misandry&q=prostate#search_anchor |title=Does feminism discriminate against ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=2008-07-24 |accessdate=2011-08-29|isbn=978-0-19-531283-6[/tpl]
Disparities also extend into areas such as detection, with governments failing to fund or mandate prostate cancer screening while fully supporting breast cancer programs. For example, a 2007 report found 49 U.S. states mandate insurance coverage for routine breast cancer screening, compared to 28 for prostate cancer.[tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] Prostate cancer also experiences significantly less media coverage than other, equally prevalent cancers, with a study by Prostate Coalition showing 2.6 breast cancer stories for each one covering cancer of the prostate.
Prostate Cancer Awareness Month takes place in September in a number of countries. A light blue ribbon is used to promote the cause.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2010/10/05/breast-cancer-receives-much-more-research-funding-publicity-than-prostate-cancer-despite-similar-number-of-victims/ |title=Breast cancer receives much more research funding, publicity than prostate cancer despite similar number of victims |publisher=The Daily Caller |date=2010-10-05 |accessdate=2011-08-29[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7258393/ns/health-cancer/ |title=Prostate cancer in shadow of female counterpart - Health - Cancer - msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2005-03-28 |accessdate=2011-08-29[/tpl]

===Prostate cancer models===

Scientists have established a few prostate cancer cell lines to investigate the mechanism involved in the progression of prostate cancer. LNCaP, PC-3 (PC3), and DU-145 (DU145) are commonly used prostate cancer cell lines. The LNCaP cancer cell line was established from a human lymph node metastatic lesion of prostatic adenocarcinoma. PC-3 and DU-145 cells were established from human prostatic adenocarcinoma metastatic to bone and to brain, respectively. LNCaP cells express androgen receptor (AR); however, PC-3 and DU-145 cells express very little or no AR. AR, an androgen-activated transcription factor, belongs to the steroid nuclear receptor family. Development of the prostate is dependent on androgen signaling mediated through AR, and AR is also important during the development of prostate cancer. The proliferation of LNCaP cells is androgen-dependent but the proliferation of PC-3 and DU-145 cells is androgen-insensitive. Elevation of AR expression is often observed in advanced prostate tumors in patients.[tpl]cite journal | author = Linja MJ, Savinainen KJ, Saramäki OR, Tammela TL, Vessella RL, Visakorpi T | title = Amplification and overexpression of androgen receptor gene in hormone-refractory prostate cancer | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 61 | issue = 9 | pages = 3550–5 |date=May 2001 | pmid = 11325816 | doi =  | url = http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=11325816 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Ford OH, Gregory CW, Kim D, Smitherman AB, Mohler JL | title = Androgen receptor gene amplification and protein expression in recurrent prostate cancer | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 170 | issue = 5 | pages = 1817–21 |date=November 2003 | pmid = 14532783 | doi = 10.1097/01.ju.0000091873.09677.f4 [/tpl] Some androgen-independent LNCaP sublines have been developed from the ATCC androgen-dependent LNCaP cells after androgen deprivation for study of prostate cancer progression. These androgen-independent LNCaP cells have elevated AR expression and express prostate specific antigen upon androgen treatment. The paradox is that androgens inhibit the proliferation of these androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.[tpl]cite journal | author = Kokontis J, Takakura K, Hay N, Liao S | title = Increased androgen receptor activity and altered c-myc expression in prostate cancer cells after long-term androgen deprivation | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 54 | issue = 6 | pages = 1566–73 |date=March 1994 | pmid = 7511045 | doi =  | url = http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7511045 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Umekita Y, Hiipakka RA, Kokontis JM, Liao S | title = Human prostate tumor growth in athymic mice: inhibition by androgens and stimulation by finasteride | journal = Proc.

===Diagnosis===

At present, an active area of research and non-clinically applied investigations involve non-invasive methods of prostate tumor detection. Adenoviruses modified to transfect tumor cells with harmless yet distinct genes (such as luciferase) have proven capable of early detection. So far, however, this area of research has been tested only in animal and LNCaP cell models.[tpl]cite journal | author = Iyer M, Salazar FB, Lewis X, Zhang L, Wu L, Carey M, Gambhir SS | title = Non-invasive imaging of a transgenic mouse model using a prostate-specific two-step transcriptional amplification strategy | journal = Transgenic Res. | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–55 |date=February 2005 | pmid = 15865048 | doi = 10.1007/s11248-004-2836-1 [/tpl]
Presence of the EN2 (gene) in urine has been correlated to a high probability of prostate cancer.[tpl]cite journal | author = Morgan R, Boxall A, Bhatt A, Bailey M, Hindley R, Langley S, Whitaker HC, Neal DE, Ismail M, Whitaker H, Annels N, Michael A, Pandha H | title = Engrailed-2 (EN2): a tumor specific urinary biomarker for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer | journal = Clin.

Another potential non-invasive method of early prostate tumor detection is through a molecular test that detects the presence of cell-associated PCA3 mRNA in fluid massaged from the prostate by the doctor and first-void urinated out within a limited amount of urine into the specimen container. PCA3 mRNA is expressed almost exclusively by prostate cells and has been shown to be highly over-expressed in prostate cancer cells. The test result is currently reported as a specimen ratio of PCA3 mRNA to PSA mRNA. Although not a replacement for serum PSA level, the PCA3 test is an additional tool to help decide whether, in men suspected of having prostate cancer (especially if an initial biopsy fails to explain the elevated serum PSA), a biopsy/rebiopsy is really needed. The higher the expression of PCA3 in the sample, the greater the likelihood of a positive biopsy; i.e., the presence of cancer cells in the prostate.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bourdoumis A, Papatsoris AG, Chrisofos M, Efstathiou E, Skolarikos A, Deliveliotis C | title = The novel prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) biomarker | journal = Int Braz J Urol | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 665–8; discussion 669 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21176272 | doi =10.1590/S1677-55382010000600003  [/tpl]

Thrombophlebitis is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer and may be a good way for physicians to remind themselves to screen patients with thrombophlebitis for prostate cancer as well since these two are closely linked.[tpl]cite journal | author = van Weert HC, Pingen F | title = Recurrent thromboflebitis as a warning sign for cancer: a case report | journal = Cases J | volume = 2 | issue =  | pages =  153| year = 2009 | pmid = 19946524 | pmc = 2783109 | doi = 10.1186/1757-1626-2-153 [/tpl]
Epithelial cells of the prostate secrete prostasomes as well as PSA. Prostasomes are membrane–surrounded, prostate-derived organelles that appear extracellularly, and one of their physiological functions is to protect the sperm from attacks by the female immune system. Cancerous prostate cells continue to synthesize and secrete prostasomes, and may be shielded against immunological attacks by these prostasomes. Research of several aspects of prostasomal involvement in prostate cancer has been performed.[tpl]cite journal | author = Nilsson BO, Carlsson L, Larsson A, Ronquist G | title = Autoantibodies to prostasomes as new markers for prostate cancer | journal = Ups.
