Catherine of Aragon (Castilian: Catalina de Aragón; [tpl]lang-an|Catarina d'Aragón[/tpl]; 16 December 1485 – 7 January 1536) was Queen of England from 1509 until 1533 as the first wife of King Henry VIII; she was previously Princess of Wales as the wife of Prince Arthur.
The daughter of Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon, Catherine was three years old when she was betrothed to Prince Arthur, heir apparent to the English throne. They married in 1501, but Arthur died five months later. In 1507, she held the position of ambassador for the Spanish Court in England, becoming the first female ambassador in European history.[tpl]sfn|Weir|1991|p=59[/tpl] Catherine subsequently married Arthur's younger brother, the recently succeeded Henry VIII, in 1509. For six months in 1513, she served as regent of England while Henry VIII was in France. During that time the English won the Battle of Flodden, an event in which Catherine played an important part.[tpl]sfn|Catherine of Aragon, Queen of England[/tpl]
By 1525, Henry VIII was infatuated with his mistress, Anne Boleyn, and dissatisfied that his marriage to Catherine had produced no surviving sons, leaving their daughter, the future Mary I of England, as heiress presumptive at a time when there was no established precedent for a woman on the throne. He sought to have their marriage annulled, setting in motion a chain of events that led to England's schism with the Catholic Church. When Pope Clement VII refused to annul the marriage, Henry defied him by assuming supremacy over religious matters. In 1533 their marriage was declared invalid and Henry married Anne on the judgment of clergy in England, without reference to the Pope. Catherine refused to accept Henry as Supreme Head of the Church of England and considered herself the King's rightful wife and queen, attracting much popular sympathy.[tpl]sfn|Catherine of Aragon (1485–1536)[/tpl] Despite this, she was acknowledged only as Dowager Princess of Wales by Henry. After being banished from court, she lived out the remainder of her life at Kimbolton Castle, and died there on 7 January 1536.
Catherine's English subjects held her in high esteem, thus her death set off tremendous mourning among the English people.[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=295[/tpl]
The controversial book "The Education of Christian Women" by Juan Luis Vives, which claimed women have the right to an education, was  commissioned by and dedicated to her. Such was Catherine's impression on people, that even her enemy, Thomas Cromwell, said of her "If not for her sex, she could have defied all the heroes of History."[tpl]sfn|Chapuys|1533|p=737[/tpl] She successfully appealed for the lives of the rebels involved in the Evil May Day for the sake of their families.[tpl]sfn|Deutscher & Bietenholz|1987|p=283[/tpl] Furthermore, Catherine won widespread admiration by starting an extensive programme for the relief of the poor.[tpl]sfn|Catherine of Aragon Biography[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Deutscher & Bietenholz|1987|p=283[/tpl] She was also a patron of Renaissance humanism, and a friend of the great scholars Erasmus of Rotterdam and Thomas More.[tpl]sfn|Catherine of Aragon Biography[/tpl]

==Early life==

Catherine was born at the Archbishop's Palace in Alcalá de Henares near Madrid, on the night of 16 December 1485. She was the youngest surviving child of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile.[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=283[/tpl] Catherine was quite short in stature[tpl]sfn|Fraser|1992|p=24[/tpl] with long red hair, wide blue eyes, a round face, and a fair complexion.[tpl]sfn|Weir|1991|p=15[/tpl]She was descended, on her maternal side, from the English royal house; her great-grandmother Catherine of Lancaster, after whom she was named, and her great-great-grandmother Philippa of Lancaster were both daughters of John of Gaunt and granddaughters of Edward III of England. Consequently she was third cousin of her father-in-law, Henry VII of England,[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=284[/tpl] and fourth cousin of her mother-in-law Elizabeth of York.
Catherine was educated by a tutor, Alessandro Geraldini, who was a clerk in Holy Orders. She studied religion, the classics, Latin histories, canon and civil law, heraldry, and genealogy. She had a strong religious upbringing and developed a faith that would play a major role in later life.[tpl]sfn|Fraser|1992|p=12[/tpl] She learned to speak, read and write in Spanish and Latin, and spoke French and Greek. She was also taught domestic skills, such as needlepoint, lace-making, embroidery, music and dancing.[tpl]sfn|Weir|1991|p=20[/tpl] The great scholar Erasmus would later say that Catherine "loved good literature which she had studied with success since childhood".[tpl]sfn|Dowling|1986|p=17[/tpl]
At an early age, Catherine was considered a suitable wife for Arthur, Prince of Wales, heir apparent to the English throne, due to the English ancestry she inherited from her mother. By means of her mother, Catherine had a stronger legitimate claim to the English throne than King Henry VII himself through the first two wives of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster: Blanche of Lancaster and Constance of Castile. In contrast, Henry VII was the descendant of Gaunt's third marriage to Katherine Swynford, whose children were born out of wedlock and only legitimised after the death of Constance and the marriage of John to Katherine. The children of John and Katherine, while legitimised, were barred from ever inheriting the English throne, a stricture that was ignored in later generations. Because of Henry's descent through illegitimate children barred from succession to the English throne, the Tudor monarchy was not accepted by all European kingdoms. At the time, the house of Trastámara was the most prestigious in Europe,[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=284[/tpl]  due to the rule of the Catholic Monarchs, so the alliance of Catherine and Arthur validated the House of Tudor in the eyes of European royalty and also strengthened the Tudor claim to the English throne via Catherine of Aragon's ancestry. It would also have given a male heir an indisputable claim to the throne. The two were married by proxy on 19 May 1499 and corresponded in Latin until Arthur turned fifteen, when it was decided that they were old enough to be married.[tpl]sfn|Sanders & Low|1910|p=235[/tpl]
When Catherine of Aragon travelled to London she brought a group of her African attendants with her, including one identified as the trumpeter John Blanke.[tpl]sfn|John Blanke[/tpl] They are the first recorded Africans to arrive in London at the time, and were considered luxury servants. They caused a great impression about the princess and the power of her family.[tpl]sfn|Goodwin|2008|p=166[/tpl]

==As wife and widow of Arthur==

The couple met on 4 November at Dogmersfield in Hampshire. Little is known about their first impressions of each other, but Arthur did write to his parents-in-law that he would be "a true and loving husband" and told his parents that he was immensely happy to "behold the face of his lovely bride". Unfortunately, the couple found that they could not understand each other, since they had learned different pronunciations of Latin.[tpl]sfn|Fraser|1992|p=25[/tpl] Ten days later, on 14 November 1501, they were married at Old St. Paul's Cathedral.[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=284[/tpl] A dowry of 200,000 crowns had been agreed, and half was paid shortly after the marriage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.historyonthenet.com/Chronology/timelinecatherine.htm |title=Catherine of Aragon Timeline |publisher=Historyonthenet.com |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2013-09-16[/tpl]
Once married, Arthur was sent to Ludlow Castle on the borders of Wales to preside over the Council of Wales and the Marches, as was his duty as Prince of Wales, and his bride accompanied him. The couple stayed at Castle Lodge, Ludlow. A few months later, they both became ill, possibly with the sweating sickness which was sweeping the area. Arthur died on 2 April 1502; Catherine recovered to find herself a widow.[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=285[/tpl]
At this point, Henry VII faced the challenge of avoiding the obligation to return her dowry[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl], half of which he had not yet received, to her father. To settle the matter, it was agreed that Catherine would marry Henry VII's second son, Henry, Duke of York, who was five years younger than she was. The death of Catherine's mother, however, meant that her "value" in the marriage market decreased. Castile was a much larger kingdom than Aragon, and it was inherited by Catherine's mentally unstable elder sister, Joanna. Ostensibly, the marriage was delayed until Henry was old enough, but Henry VII procrastinated so much over payment of the remainder of Catherine's dowry that it became doubtful that the marriage would take place. She lived as a virtual prisoner at Durham House in London.[tpl]sfn|Williams|1971|p=15[/tpl] Some of the letters she wrote to her father complaining of her treatment have survived. In one of these letters she tells him that "I choose what I believe, and say nothing. For I am not as simple as I may seem." She had little money and struggled to cope, as she had to support her ladies-in-waiting as well as herself. In 1507 she served as the Spanish ambassador to England, the first female ambassador in European history.[tpl]sfn|Weir|1991|p=59[/tpl] While Henry VII and his councillors expected her to be easily manipulated, Catherine went on to prove them wrong.[tpl]sfn|Weir|1991|p=59[/tpl]
Marriage to Arthur's brother depended on the Pope granting a dispensation because canon law forbade men to marry their brother's widow. Catherine testified that her marriage to Arthur was never consummated as, also according to canon law, a marriage was not valid until consummated.[tpl]sfn|Weir|1991|p=34[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=290[/tpl]

==Queen of England (1509–1533)==

===Wedding===

Catherine's wedding took place on 11 June 1509,[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=287[/tpl]  seven years after Prince Arthur's death. She married Henry VIII, who had only just acceded to the throne, in a private ceremony at Greenwich Church. She was 23 years of age. The king was just days short of his 18th birthday.[tpl]sfn|Eagles|2002|p=194[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=287[/tpl]

===Coronation===

On Saturday 23 June, the traditional eve-of-coronation procession to Westminster was greeted by a large and enthusiastic crowd. As was the custom, the couple spent the night before their coronation at the Tower of London. On Midsummer's Day, Sunday, [tpl]Nowrap|24 June[/tpl] 1509, Henry VIII and Catherine were anointed and crowned together by the Archbishop of Canterbury at a lavish ceremony at Westminster Abbey. The coronation was followed by a banquet in Westminster Hall. Many new Knights of the Bath were created in honour of the coronation.[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=287[/tpl]
In that month that followed, many social occasions presented the new Queen to the English public. She made a fine impression and was well received by the people of England.[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=285[/tpl]

===Pregnancies and children===

On 31 January 1510, Catherine gave birth prematurely to a stillborn daughter. A son, Henry, Duke of Cornwall, was born on New Year's Day 1511. On 23 February 1511 the young prince died suddenly, living only 52 days. The cause of his death was not recorded. In 1513, Catherine was pregnant again.[tpl]sfn|Rymer|1741|p=48[/tpl] Catherine had lost another son when Henry returned from France. He was either stillborn or died shortly after birth. In December 1514, she had another son, Prince Henry who died shortly after birth. On 18 February 1516, Catherine delivered a healthy girl.[tpl]sfn|Eagles|2002|p=195[/tpl] She was named Mary and christened three days later with great ceremony at the Church of Observant Friars. In 1518, Catherine became pregnant for the last time. She gave birth to a daughter on 10 November, but the child was weak and lived either only a few hours or at most a week. Catherine was pregnant six times altogether.[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=288[/tpl]

===Influence===

On 11 June 1513, Henry appointed Catherine Regent or Governor of England while he went to France on a military campaign.Rymer, Thomas, ed., Foedera, vol. 13 (1712), p. 370, Catherine was appointed "Rectrix" and "Gubernatrix" of England.
When Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Longueville, was captured at Thérouanne, Henry sent him to stay in Catherine's household. She wrote to Wolsey that she and her council would prefer the Duke to stay in the Tower of London as the Scots were "so busy as they now be" and she added her prayers for "God to sende us as good lukke against the Scotts, as the King hath ther."[tpl]sfn|Ellis|1846|p=152-154[/tpl] The war with Scotland occupied her subjects, and she was "horrible busy with making standards, banners, and badges" at Richmond Palace. The Scots invaded and on 3 September she ordered Thomas Lovell to raise an army in the midland counties.[tpl]sfn|Rymer|1741|p=49[/tpl]
Catherine rode north in full armour to address the troops, despite being heavily pregnant at the time. (She gave birth to a stillborn son c. October.) Her fine speech was reported to the historian Peter Martyr d'Anghiera in Valladolid within a fortnight.Letters & Papers vol. 1 (1920), no. 2299: Catherine was issued with banners at Richmond on 8 September, Letters & Papers, vol.1 (1920), no.2243 Although an Italian newsletter said she was 100 miles north of London when news of the victory at Battle of Flodden Field reached her, she was near Buckingham.Letters & Papers Henry VIII vol. 1 (1920) no. 2278: Calendar State Papers Venice, vol.2, no. 340: Hall, Edward, Chronicle, (1809), 564.  From Woburn Abbey she sent a letter to Henry along with a piece of the bloodied coat of King James IV of Scotland, who died in the battle, for Henry to use as a banner at the siege of Tournai.[tpl]sfn|Ellis|1846|p=82-84, 88-89[/tpl]
Catherine's religious dedication increased as she aged, as did her interest in academics. She continued to broaden her knowledge and provide training for her daughter. Education among women became fashionable, partly because of Catherine's influence. She also donated large sums of money to several colleges. Henry, however, still considered a male heir essential. The Tudor dynasty was new, and its legitimacy might still be tested.[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=288-289[/tpl]  A long civil war (1135–54) had been fought the last time a woman, (Empress Matilda), had inherited the throne. The disasters of civil war were still fresh in living memory from the Wars of the Roses.[tpl]sfn|Wilkinson|2009|p=70[/tpl]
In 1520, Catherine's nephew Holy Roman Emperor Charles V[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=291[/tpl] paid a state visit to England, and she urged Henry to enter an alliance with Charles rather than with France. Immediately after his departure, she accompanied Henry to France on the celebrated visit to Francis I, the so-called Field of the Cloth of Gold. Within two years, war was declared against France and the Emperor was once again welcome in England, where plans were afoot to betroth him to Catherine's daughter Mary.

==The King's "great matter"==

In 1525, Henry VIII became enamoured  of Anne Boleyn, a lady-in-waiting to Queen Catherine who was 10 years younger than Henry. Henry began pursuing her;[tpl]sfn|Scarisbrick|1997|p=154[/tpl] Catherine was no longer able to bear children by this time. Henry began to believe that his marriage was cursed and sought confirmation from the Bible, which he interpreted to say that if a man marries his brother's wife, the couple will be childless.Leviticus 20:21[tpl]sfn|Catherine of Aragon Biography[/tpl] Even if her marriage to Arthur had not been consummated (and Catherine would insist to her dying day that she had come to Henry's bed a virgin), Henry's interpretation of that biblical passage meant that their marriage had been wrong in the eyes of God.[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=290[/tpl] Whether the Pope at the time of Henry and Catherine's marriage had had the right to overrule Henry's claimed scriptural impediment would become a hot topic in Henry's campaign to wrest an annulment from the present Pope.[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=290[/tpl]  It is possible that the idea of annulment had been suggested to Henry much earlier than this, and is highly probable that it was motivated by his desire for a son. Before Henry's father ascended the throne, England was beset by civil warfare over rival claims to the English crown, and Henry may have wanted to avoid a similar uncertainty over the succession.[tpl]sfn|Lacey|1972|p=70[/tpl]
It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry's desires to secure an annulment.[tpl]sfn|Brigden|2000|p=114[/tpl] Catherine was defiant when it was suggested that she quietly retire to a nunnery, saying, "God never called me to a nunnery. I am the King's true and legitimate wife".[tpl]sfn|Farquhar|p=61[/tpl] He set his hopes upon an appeal to the Holy See, acting independently of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, whom he told  nothing of his plans. William Knight, the King's secretary, was sent to Pope Clement VII to sue for an annulment, on the grounds that the dispensing bull of Pope Julius II was obtained by false pretences.
As the Pope was, at that time, the prisoner of Catherine's nephew, Emperor Charles V, following the Sack of Rome in May 1527, Knight had difficulty in obtaining access to him. In the end, Henry's envoy had to return without accomplishing much. Henry now had no choice but to put this great matter into the hands of Thomas Wolsey, and Wolsey did all he could to secure a decision in Henry's favour.[tpl]ws|"Henry VIII" in the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia[/tpl]
thumb|Catherine and Henry's daughter The Lady Mary  Wolsey went so far as to convene an ecclesiastical court in England with a representative of the Pope presiding, and Henry and Catherine herself in attendance. The Pope had no intention of allowing a decision to be reached in England, and his legate was recalled. (How far the pope was influenced by Charles V is difficult to say, but it is clear Henry saw that the Pope was unlikely to annul his marriage to the Emperor's aunt.[tpl]sfn|Morris|1998|p=166[/tpl] The Pope forbade Henry to marry again before a decision was given in Rome. Wolsey had failed and was dismissed from public office in 1529. Wolsey then began a secret plot to have Anne Boleyn forced into exile and began communicating with the Pope to that end. When this was discovered, Henry ordered Wolsey's arrest and, had he not been terminally ill and died in 1530, he might have been executed for treason.[tpl]sfn|Haigh|1993|p=92[/tpl] A year later, Catherine was banished from court, and her old rooms were given to Anne Boleyn. When Archbishop of Canterbury William Warham died, the Boleyn family's chaplain, Thomas Cranmer, was appointed to the vacant position.[tpl]ws|"Clement VII" in the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia[/tpl]
When Henry decided to annul his marriage to Catherine, John Fisher became her most trusted counsellor and one of her chief supporters. He appeared in the legates' court on her behalf, where he shocked people with the directness of his language, and by declaring that, like John the Baptist, he was ready to die on behalf of the indissolubility of marriage. Henry was so enraged by this that he wrote a long Latin address to the legates in answer to Fisher's speech. Fisher's copy of this still exists, with his manuscript annotations in the margin which show how little he feared Henry's anger. The removal of the cause to Rome ended Fisher's role in the matter, but Henry never forgave him.[tpl]sfn|Jestice|2004|p=277[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Rex|2003|p=27[/tpl] Other people who supported Catherine's case included Thomas More, Henry's own sister Mary Tudor, Queen of France - though as a member of the Tudor family and of royal blood, she was safe from any punishment and execution - Maria de Salinas, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Pope Paul III and Protestant Reformers Martin Luther[tpl]sfn|Brecht|1994|p=44[/tpl] and William Tyndale.[tpl]sfn|Rees|2006|p=77[/tpl]

==Banishment and death==

Upon returning to Dover from a meeting with King Francis I of France in Calais, Henry married Anne Boleyn in a secret ceremony.[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=292[/tpl] Some sources speculate that Anne was already pregnant at the time (and Henry did not want to risk a son being born illegitimate), but others testify that Anne (who had seen her sister Mary Boleyn taken up as the king's mistress and summarily cast aside) refused to sleep with Henry until they were married. Henry defended the legality of their union by pointing out that Catherine had previously been married. If she and Arthur had consummated their marriage, Henry by canon law had the right to remarry.[tpl]sfn|Starkey|2003|pp=462-464[/tpl]On 23 May 1533, Cranmer, sitting in judgement at a special court convened at Dunstable Priory to rule on the validity of Henry's marriage to Catherine, declared the marriage illegal, even though Catherine testified she and Arthur had never had physical relations. Cranmer ruled Henry and Anne's marriage valid five days later, on 28 May 1533.[tpl]sfn|Williams|1971|p=124[/tpl]
Until the end of her life, Catherine would refer to herself as Henry's only lawful wedded wife and England's only rightful queen, and her servants continued to address her by that title. However, Henry refused her the right to any title but "Dowager Princess of Wales" in recognition of her position as his brother's widow.[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=292[/tpl]
Catherine went to live at The More castle in the winter of 1531/32.[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=293[/tpl]
In 1535 she was transferred to Kimbolton Castle. There, she confined herself to one room (which she left only to attend Mass), dressed only in the hair shirt of the Order of St. Francis, and fasted continuously. While she was permitted to receive occasional visitors, she was forbidden to see her daughter Mary. They were also forbidden to communicate in writing, but sympathizers discreetly ferried letters between the two. Henry offered both mother and daughter better quarters and permission to see each other if they would acknowledge Anne Boleyn as his new Queen. Both refused.[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=293[/tpl]
In late December 1535, sensing her death was near, Catherine made her will, and wrote to her nephew, the Emperor Charles V, asking him to protect her daughter. She then penned one final letter to Henry, her "most dear lord and husband":Sharon Turner, The History of England from the Earliest Period to the Death of Elizabeth (Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green,1828)

Catherine died at Kimbolton Castle on [tpl]Nowrap|7 January[/tpl] 1536.[tpl]sfn|Eagles|2002|p=202[/tpl] The following day, news of her death reached the king. At the time there were rumours that she was poisoned,Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII, vol. X, no. 190Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII, vol. X, no. 59Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII, vol. X, no. 230 possibly by Gregory di Casale.Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII, vol. X, no. 200 According to the chronicler Edward Hall, Anne Boleyn wore yellow for the mourning, which has been interpreted in various ways; Polydore Vergil interpreted this to mean that Anne did not mourn.[tpl]sfn|Warnicke|1991|p=187[/tpl] However, Chapuys reported that it was actually King Henry who decked himself in yellow, celebrating the news and making a great show of his and Anne's daughter, Elizabeth, to his courtiers.[tpl]sfn|Warnicke|1991|p=188[/tpl] This was seen as distasteful and vulgar by many. Another theory is that the dressing in yellow was out of respect for the late queen-princess dowager as yellow was said to be the Spanish colour of mourning. Certainly, later in the day it is reported that Henry and Anne both individually and privately wept for her death. On the day of Catherine's funeral, Anne Boleyn miscarried a son. Rumours then circulated that Catherine had been poisoned by Anne or Henry, or both, as Anne had threatened to murder both Catherine and Mary on several occasions. The rumours were born after the apparent discovery during her embalming that there was a black growth on her heart that might have been caused by poisoning.[tpl]sfn|Lofts|1979|p=139[/tpl] Modern medical experts are in agreement that her heart's discolouration was due not to poisoning, but to cancer, something which was not understood at the time.[tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=294[/tpl]
Catherine was buried in Peterborough Cathedral with the ceremony due to a Dowager Princess of Wales, not a queen. Henry did not attend the funeral and forbade Mary to attend.[tpl]sfn|B. Deutscher & P.G. Bietenholz|2003|p=284[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Lehman|2011|p=294[/tpl]

==Faith==

Catherine was a member of the Third Order of Saint Francis and she was punctilious in her religious obligations in the Order, integrating without demur her necessary duties as queen with her personal piety.
The outward celebration of saints and holy relics formed no major part of her personal devotions, which  she rather expressed in the Mass, prayer, confession and penance. Privately, however, she was aware of what she identified as the  shortcomings of the papacy and church officialdom.[tpl]Citation|last1=Davies|first1=C. S. L. |last2=Edwards|first2=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|date=January 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|chapter=Katherine (1485–1536)|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4891[/tpl] Her doubts about Church improprieties certainly did not extend so far as to support the allegations of corruption made public by Martin Luther in Wittenberg in 1517, which were soon to have such far-reaching consequences in initiating the Protestant Reformation.
In 1523 Alfonso de Villa Sancta, a learned friar of the Observant (reform) branch of the Friars Minor and friend of the king's old advisor Erasmus, dedicated to the queen his book De Liberio Arbitrio adversus Melanchthonem denouncing  Philipp Melanchthon, a supporter of Luther. Acting as her confessor, he was able to nominate her for the title of "Defender of the Faith" for denying Luther's arguments.[tpl]sfn|Fraser|1992|p=95[/tpl]

==Appearance==

Catherine was of a very fair complexion, had blue eyes, and had a hair colour that was between reddish-blonde and auburn like her mother and sister Joanna.[tpl]sfn|Viguer|1900|p=68[/tpl] During her lifetime she was described as "The most beautiful creature in the world"[tpl]sfn|Weir|1991|p=81[/tpl] and that there was "Nothing lacking in her that the most beautiful girl should have."[tpl]sfn|Fraser|1992|p=24[/tpl]  Thomas More and Lord Herbert would reflect later in her lifetime that in regard to her appearance "There were few women who could compete with the Queen Catherine in her prime."[tpl]sfn|Weir|1991|p=104[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Strickland|p=493[/tpl]

==Legacy, memory, and historiography==

The controversial book "The Education of Christian Women" by Juan Luis Vives, which claimed women have the right to an education, was dedicated to and commissioned by her. Such was Catherine's impression on people, that even her enemy, Thomas Cromwell, said of her "If not for her sex, she could have defied all the heroes of History."[tpl]sfn|Chapuys|1533|p=737[/tpl] She successfully appealed for the lives of the rebels involved in the Evil May Day for the sake of their families.[tpl]sfn|Deutscher &  Bietenholz|p=283[/tpl] Furthermore, Catherine won widespread admiration by starting an extensive programme for the relief of the poor.[tpl]sfn|Deutscher &  Bietenholz|p=283[/tpl] She was also a patron of Renaissance humanism, and a friend of the great scholars Erasmus of Rotterdam and Saint Thomas More. Some saw her as a martyr.Letters and Papers of Henry VIII, vol. X, no. 212Letters and Papers of Henry VIII, vol. X, no. 232
In the reign of her daughter Mary I of England, her marriage to Henry VIII was declared "good and valid." Her daughter Queen Mary also had several portraits commissioned of Catherine, and it would not by any means be the last time she was painted. After her death, numerous portraits were painted of her, particularly of her speech at the Legatine Trial, a moment accurately rendered in Shakespeare's play about Henry VIII.
Her tomb in Peterborough Cathedral[tpl]sfn|Froude|1981|p=389[/tpl] can be seen and there is hardly ever a time when it is not decorated with flowers or pomegranates, her heraldic symbol. It bears the title Katharine Queen of England.
In the 20th century, George V's wife, Mary of Teck, had her grave upgraded and there are now banners there denoting Catherine as a Queen of England. Every year at Peterborough Cathedral there is a service in her memory. There are processions, prayers, and various events in the Cathedral including processions to Catherine's grave in which candles, pomegranates, flowers and other offerings are placed on her grave. On the service commemorating the 470th anniversary of her death, the Spanish Ambassador to the United Kingdom attended. During the 2010 service a rendition of Catherine of Aragon's speech before the Legatine court was read by Jane Lapotaire.

Catherine has remained a popular biographical subject to the present day. The American historian Garrett Mattingly was the author of a popular biography Katherine of Aragon in 1942. In 1966, Catherine and her many supporters at court were the subjects of Catherine of Aragon and her Friends, a biography by John E. Paul. In 1967, Mary M. Luke wrote the first book of her Tudor trilogy, Catherine the Queen which portrayed her and the controversial era of English history through which she lived.

In recent years, the historian Alison Weir covered her life extensively in her biography The Six Wives of Henry VIII, first published in 1991. Antonia Fraser did the same in her own 1992 biography of the same title; as did the British historian David Starkey in his 2003 book Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII.[tpl]sfn|Starkey|2003|p=1[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Weir|1991|p=1[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Fraser|1992|p=1[/tpl] Giles Tremlett's biography Catherine of Aragon: The Spanish Queen of Henry VIII came out in 2010, and Julia Fox's 2011 dual biography Sister Queens: The Noble, Tragic Lives of Katherine of Aragon and Juana, Queen of Castile.

===Spelling of her name===

Her baptismal name was "Catalina", but "Catherine" was soon the accepted form in England after her marriage to Arthur (who later died of natural causes). Catherine herself signed her name "Katherine", "Katherina", "Katharine" and sometimes "Katharina". In a letter to her, Arthur, her husband, addressed her as "Princess Katerine". Her daughter Queen Mary I called her "Quene Kateryn", in her will. Rarely were names, particularly first names, written in an exact manner during the sixteenth century and it is evident from Catherine's own letters that she endorsed different variations.Catherine's endorsement of different spellings can be identified in numerous letters, signing herself as 'Katharine the Quene' in a letter to Wolsey in 1513 and as 'Katharine' in her final letter to Henry VIII dating to [tpl]Nowrap|Jan 1536[/tpl].
Loveknots built into his various palaces by her husband, Henry VIII, display the initials "H & K",As Latin inscriptions were used in structures, a "C" represented the numeral 100, so a "K" was used instead. The same was applied during the time of Henri II and his wife Catherine during her state entry in Paris in 18 June 1549. as do other items belonging to Henry and Catherine, including gold goblets, a gold salt cellar, basins of gold, and candlesticks. Her tomb in Peterborough Cathedral is marked "Katharine Queen of England.[tpl]sfn|Fraser|1992|pp=57-58[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&GRid=6943310&PIpi=354770 |title=Find A Grave |publisher=Find A Grave |date=2002-11-23 |accessdate=2013-09-16[/tpl]

==In art and media==

Over the years, numerous artistic and cultural works have been dedicated to her, written about her, or mentioned her, including some by her husband Henry VIII, who wrote "Grene growth the holy"[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HUUgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=grene+growth+the+holy&source=bl&ots=fKpCPsdzwB&sig=ZG93Dk1LgPF-FbLzXV57qpngdUg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NC_oUJGcK8zK0AHnn4DACQ&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q=grene%20growth%20the%20holy&f=false |title=Early Sixteenth Century Lyrics - Frederick Morgan Padelford - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-19[/tpl] about and for her, and Juan Luis Vives, who dedicated "The Education of Christian Women" to her.[tpl]sfn|Weir|1991|p=123[/tpl]
Catherine of Aragon has been portrayed in film, television, plays, books, and other forms many times, and as a result she has stayed very much in popular memory. There has never been a film or television series where she is the main character although an arguable exception is the first episode of The Six Wives of Henry VIII which is told from her point of view and where she is portrayed by Annette Crosbie. There are also many novels, songs, and poems written about her.  Shakespeare's play Henry VIII is tremendously successful in recreating, with great accuracy, Catherine's statement about the legitimacy of her marriage at the court in Blackfriars before King Henry, and Catherine's portrayal is very sympathetic therein.  However, most of the rest of the play is an attempt to absolve many, especially Henry VIII, and the timing of key incidents (including Catherine's death) is changed and other events are avoided (the play makes Henry nearly an innocent pawn in the hands of a dastard Cardinal Wolsey, and the play stops short of Anne Boleyn's execution).
Although Catherine is often portrayed in film and on stage as having possessed the stereotypical Spanish traits of dark hair and eyes as well an olive complexion, existing portraits and contemporary descriptions depict her as having had blue eyes, fair skin, and reddish-blonde hair, not uncommon for Spaniards from the northern regions of Spain, such as those from her father's land of Aragon. Furthermore, she was part English, through her ancestors, Katherine of Lancaster and Philippa of Lancaster, who were both daughters of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster.
She is often played with a Spanish accent; from most reports, this is accurate, as she never fully mastered the English language.
In January 2013 the National Portrait Gallery in London revealed that its curators had recently discovered a portrait of Catherine at Lambeth Palace. Formerly believed to be a portrait of Catherine Parr, the canvas was, in fact, a portrait of Catherine of Aragon. The National Portrait Gallery announced that the painting, which had hung in a private sitting room of the Archbishop of Canterbury since at least the 19th century, would be paired with a portrait of Henry VIII, already in the museum's collection, and would remain at the museum on loan.[tpl]cite web|last=Brown|first=Mark|title=National Portrait Gallery reunites Henry VIII with Catherine of Aragon|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2013/jan/24/henry-viii-catherine-aragon-portrait|work=The Guardian|date=24 January 2013|accessdate=25 January 2013[/tpl]
