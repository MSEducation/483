Carrie Johnston, writing in the Washington Post, reported that Ziaulhaq and two other Afghans,
Bashir Ahmad and Mohammad Rafi accepted an invitation to come to a conference in the United States, that turned out to be a ploy to hold them in the USA as potential witnesses against their employers.
The three men worked for Afghan construction firms that are suspected of bribing American GIs.
She reported that the three Afghan men came to America in the summer of 2008.
Since then they have shared a hotel suite in Chicago.
She reported that the Prosecution finally said they would need to interview him for only an hour.

The article described him as "gaunt", and stated he testified for two hours.  He testified he had no knowledge of kickbacks, and that he had no signing authority or other responsibilities in the finances of the firm he worked for.  Under cross examination by the contractors' defense counself he was asked to confirm an estimate that during the fourteen months he had been held as a material witness the prosecution may have spent $60,000 to $70,000 on his per diem, travel and other expenses associated with his detention.  He replied: ''"I don't understand what the problem with this is," Ziaulhaq testified. "I didn't ask to be here. If it was up to me, I would return to my country."
