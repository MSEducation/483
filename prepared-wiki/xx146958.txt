Jonathan James "Jon" Scheyer (born August 24, 1987) is an American former basketball player, currently on the coaching staff of the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team. Scheyer led his high school team to an Illinois state basketball championship as a high school All American, and was one of the starters on the 2009–10 Duke Blue Devils that won the 2010 NCAA Basketball Championship, as a college All American. He was a prolific high school scorer, and later an Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) leader in numerous statistical categories, ranging from free throw percentage and three point shots/game to assists/turnover ratio.
A high school All American, he once scored 21 points in a game's final 75 seconds of play in an attempt to spark a comeback.  The 4th-leading scorer in Illinois high school history, he led his team to a state championship in 2005, and was named Illinois Mr. Basketball in 2006.  Also in 2006, Scheyer was voted as one of the 100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament, a group of former players and coaches in honor of the 100 anniversary of the IHSA boys basketball tournament.
He chose to attend Duke for college, for whom he moved from shooting guard to point guard towards the end of the 2008–09 season, and was the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the 2009 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament.[tpl]cite news|last=Bannon|first=Terry|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-12-16/sports/0712150477_1_greg-paulus-jon-scheyer-blue-devils |title=He's caught off guard; Scheyer adjusting to new role as sub for No. 6 Blue Devils |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=December 16, 2007 |accessdate=March 15, 2010[/tpl]

He was not drafted in the 2010 NBA Draft, was a 2010 Los Angeles Clippers training camp invitee but was waived in the team's reduction to its final roster, and in 2011 played shooting guard for the Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the NBA D-League.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-spt-0625-locals-nba-draft--20100624,0,7188179.story |title=Evan Turner: As expected, Ohio State-St. Joseph product goes second in NBA draft |work=Chicago Tribune|date= June 24, 2010|accessdate=June 25, 2010 | first=Shannon | last=Ryan[/tpl]

==High school career==

Because Scheyer's talent was obvious by the time he was set to start high school, many people encouraged his parents to move so he could attend a high school with a powerhouse basketball program.  The move was recommended so that he would have a greater chance of success. Scheyer shrugged off the suggestion, telling his parents:  "We'll just do it here. We'll build the success at Glenbrook North." His father said:  "I get chills thinking about it.  That wasn't my vision.  It wasn't Laury's. It wasn't his coaches'.  That was Jon's vision, and it never occurred to him that anything else would happen."
Scheyer attended Glenbrook North High School and led the Spartans to an Illinois High School Association Class AA state basketball championship as a junior, a 3rd-place finish in 2003 as a freshman, and an Elite Eight appearance in the state playoffs three out of four years from 2003–06.[tpl]cite news|last=Sakamoto |first=Bob |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-03-24/sports/0603240300_1_class-aa-title-simeon-scorer-in-state-history |title=First Team – Gym rats raise game – Countless hours of extra practice pay off for Scheyer, Beverley |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=March 24, 2006 |accessdate=April 27, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Sakamoto |first=Bob |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-04-02/sports/0604020177_1_mr-basketball-jacobs-dance |title=Mr. Basketball of Illinois – Scheyer born to be the best – Tireless competitive spirit carried standout through 4 successful years at Glenbrook N.|newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=April 2, 2006 |accessdate=April 27, 2010[/tpl]  Scheyer was known as the "Jewish Jordan", and the Spartans' state championship team is the only high school state championship basketball squad in the nation known to have included an all-Jewish starting line-up.[tpl]cite news|last=Evans |first=Thayer |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/sports/ncaabasketball/30duke.html |title=Jon Scheyer Is Quiet Leader for Duke |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 30, 2010 |page=B13 |accessdate=March 30, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=King |first=Jason |url=http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/basketball/news?slug=jn-scheyer040110 |title=The fun has just begun for Duke's Scheyer |publisher=Rivals.com |date=April 2, 2010 |accessdate=April 4, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Pollick |first=Josh |url=http://www.jpost.com/Sports/Article.aspx?id=54903 |title=Jon Scheyer stands out for Duke |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=March 16, 2007 |accessdate=April 1, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url= |title=These Kids Can Jump |first=Rick |last=Harrison |newspaper=The Forward |date=March 25, 2005 |accessdate=April 23, 2010[/tpl]
As a freshman, Scheyer led Glenbrook North in scoring and assists and was First Team All-State as a sophomore in 2004.  Scheyer was the only non-senior among those First Team All-State selections and was the only underclassman on any of the first three All-State squads. As a junior, he averaged 26 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goduke.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=4200&ATCLID=620661 |title=Jon Scheyer |date=September 28, 2006 |publisher=GoDuke.com |accessdate=March 15, 2010[/tpl]  His coach David Weber said:  "I call him a combination of Larry Bird and 'Pistol' Pete (Maravich).

One example of his dogged pursuit of excellence is that while in high school, Scheyer refused to leave the gym one night until he made 50 consecutive free throws.[tpl]cite web|last=King |first=Jason |url=http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/basketball/news?slug=jn-scheyer040110 |title=The fun has just begun for Duke's Scheyer - College Basketball - Rivals.com |publisher=Rivals.yahoo.com |date=April 6, 2010 |accessdate=April 27, 2010[/tpl]  After finally hitting 49 in a row, he missed on his final attempt.  His father encouraged him to join him and go home, but – as his coach recalled – “Jon looked at him and said, ‘No. I’m starting over.’ Then he stayed until he made 50 in a row.”
Scheyer is the 4th-leading scorer in Illinois history with 3,034 points, and he is the only player in state history to finish his career ranked in the all-time top 10 in points (4th), rebounds, assists (6th), and steals (7th).  He was named Illinois Mr. Basketball in 2006 by an overwhelming margin (receiving 217 votes, to 17 for the 2nd-place finisher), a high school All-American, a two-time Gatorade state Player of the Year, and a three-time All-State selection. He had a reputation as an exceptional 3-point shooter, a rangy, slick passer, a good defensive rebounder, and a big-game performer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.highschoolelite.com/2006/scheyer.html |title=Jon Scheyer  |publisher=Highschoolelite.com |accessdate=March 15, 2010[/tpl] In naming him to the Illinois First-Team for the decade, ESPN wrote that he was "one of the greatest Illinois high school players of all-time".  He was also named to the century-list, the "100 Legends of Illinois Basketball (1908–2007)". Illinois Warriors coach Larry Butler said: "Jon Scheyer is one of the most prolific scorers I've seen in Illinois high school basketball. He was just the ultimate team player.

 Scheyer's offensive game is amazing ... He hits jumpers from all manner of pogo-stick angles. He can hit runners while shooting back across his body. He can drive and finish in acrobatic ways. His offensive repertoire of ways to score is like a magician's bag of tricks. Offensively, he is a modern-day 'Pistol' Pete Maravich.[tpl]cite news |title=Prep Insider |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=March 10, 2006 |accessdate=March 20, 2010 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1608743.html[/tpl][tpl]subscription required[/tpl] 

==College career==

Scheyer's final four college choices were Arizona, Duke, Illinois, and Wisconsin.  On the one hand, his connection with Illinois was strengthened by the fact that his high school coach was Illinois coach Bruce Weber's brother.  In addition, when he had been in junior high school, he had really disliked Duke's team, because all his friends liked Duke and he wanted to be different.[tpl]cite news |last=Patrick |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Patrick |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/danpatrick/blog/103241/index.html?loc=interstitialskip|title=Scheyer admits he once hated Duke; talks about Purdue|date=March 23, 2010|work=The Dan Patrick Show|work=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=March 23, 2010[/tpl]  Militating in favor of Duke, however, was the fact that its assistant coach Chris Collins had also attended Glenbrook North.  He also believed that playing for the Blue Devils provided him with the best chance of playing in the Final Four.[tpl]cite web |last=Powers |first=Scott |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/ncb/columns/story?columnist=powers_scott&id=5050422 |title=Making memories – After three NCAA disappointments, Duke's Scheyer living his childhood dream |publisher=ESPN |date=April 2, 2010 |accessdate=April 27, 2010[/tpl]  He ultimately chose to attend Duke, where he majored in History.

===2006–07===

In the 2006–07 season he started all 33 Blue Devils games as a freshman, and scored a season-high 26 points in a loss to North Carolina on February 7, 2007.[tpl]cite news | title= Jon Scheyer|work=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/ncaa/men/players/60215/ |accessdate=March 9, 2007[/tpl]  He led all freshmen in the ACC with an .846 free throw percentage,[tpl]cite book |url=http://www.theacc.com/sports/m-baskbl/0910accmbkguide.html |title=2009–10 Men's Basketball Media Guide |publisher=Atlantic Coast Conference |volume=57 |issue=2 |accessdate=March 31, 2010[/tpl] and was eighth in the ACC in minutes per game (33.7).  He was an ACC All-Freshman Team selection, and was named "ACC Rookie of the Week" three times. He tied for second on the team with 39 steals, and averaged 12.2 points per game (third-best on the team).  He also tied the Duke freshman record by making 115 free throws, and holds the third-longest streak for consecutive free throws made in Duke history at 40.  Though not naturally a point guard, Scheyer spent some time playing the point due to lack of depth at that position.  He felt it made him more of a complete player, and was a learning experience that made him more confident bringing the ball up court.

===2007–08===

Despite the fact that he was a starter as a freshman, Coach Mike Krzyzewski (Coach K) chose to start Gerald Henderson, Jr., in Scheyer's place for the majority of the season.  Scheyer started only once during his sophomore year, but played in all 34 games.  On December 20, 2007, he grabbed a career-high 12 rebounds against Pittsburgh.[tpl]cite web|url=http://goduke.statsgeek.com/basketball-m/players/career-highs.php?playerid=518 |title=Duke Blue Devils Basketball Statistical Database – Jon Scheyer |publisher=GoDuke.com |accessdate=April 7, 2010[/tpl]  He scored 27 points at Miami on February 20, 2008, matching the most points by a player off the bench in Duke history.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores108/108051/NCAAB781578.htm |title=Hurricanes earn breakthrough win over No. 5 Duke 96–95 |work=USA Today |date=November 29, 2007 |accessdate=March 15, 2010[/tpl]  His free throw percentage (.889) was 2nd in the ACC for the season, 12th in the nation, and 5th-best in school history.

Scheyer was named one of three captains for the Blue Devils for the 2008–09 season.[tpl]cite web |title=Paulus, Henderson & Scheyer Named Captains For 2008–09 Season |publisher=GoDuke.com |url=http://www.goduke.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=4200&ATCLID=1575393 |accessdate=September 12, 2008[/tpl]  He scored a then-career-high 30 points against Wake Forest on February 22, 2009. On February 19, Scheyer was moved from shooting guard, where he had played 91 games, to point guard; there he played well for the last 9 games of the season and into the post-season.[tpl]cite news |last=Collins |first=Dan |url=|title=On Point: Position swap good for Scheyer |newspaper=Winston-Salem Journal |date=March 15, 2009 |accessdate=March 15, 2010[/tpl]  As a point guard, he averaged 19.7 points and 2.5 assists per game, and committed 1 turnover a game.  Florida State Seminoles men's basketball coach Leonard Hamilton said he thought Scheyer had a "calming" influence on the team's offense. He was big enough, when pressured, to put a smaller defender on his hip, and still bring the ball up court.  Once he got up court and gave up the ball, he became an option himself on the perimeter for other driving players.  And on defense he was big enough to bother most guards attempting to shoot over him.[tpl]cite news |url=http://hamptonroads.com/2009/03/coach-k-pulls-surprise-and-duke-goes-roll |last=Miller |first=Ed |date=March 21, 2009 |title=Coach K pulls a surprise, and Duke goes on a roll |newspaper=The Virginian-Pilot |accessdate=January 25, 2010[/tpl]
Scheyer was 7th in the ACC in free throw percentage (.841) for the season, 8th in minutes per game (32.8), tied for 8th in steals per game (1.6) and three-point field goals made per game (2.1), and 18th in points per game (14.9).

He handles the ball real well. He scores—he scored more when he was bringing the ball up than when he didn't bring the ball up. I think the more the ball is in Jon's hands, the better."  Reflecting his off-the-court accomplishments, Scheyer was a 2009 ACC Academic Honor Roll selection.[tpl]cite web|title=Jon Scheyer |url=http://www.seniorclassaward.com/athletes/jon_scheyer/ |publisher=Lowe's Senior CLASS Award |accessdate=March 15, 2010[/tpl]

Scheyer was again named captain along with Lance Thomas.  Commenting on his play, Coach Krzyzewski said:  "He understands, which most kids, believe me, do not, the value of the ball.

Doug Gottlieb of ESPN opined in early January 2010 that Scheyer "is probably not an NBA player, but his Jewish faith allows him to get an Israeli passport, and he would be a highly coveted player for a team like Maccabi Tel Aviv."[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/1570/gottlieb-on-gts-upset-of-duke |title=Gottlieb on GT's upset of Duke |first=Doug |last=Gottlieb |publisher=ESPN |date=January 9, 2010 |accessdate=January 10, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Mittleman |first=Jerry |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1159015.html |title=In an unpredictable tournament, Duke's Scheyer is one player to count on |newspaper=Haaretz |date=December 24, 2006 |accessdate=March 26, 2010[/tpl]
David Thorpe, ESPN's resident expert on NBA rookies and noted trainer of NBA prospects, differed with Gottlieb. He noted most NBA teams would benefit by having Scheyer on their team as a sixth man.  Chad Ford, ESPN's draft expert, rated Scheyer within the top-60 NBA prospects.  Asked in March 2010 whether he feels he can make it in the NBA, Scheyer said he was confident he can.
By early April, most NBA draft analysts had him going somewhere in the second round, but Larry Butler, his former AAU coach with the Illinois Warriors who has also coached Andre Iguodala, Quentin Richardson, and Dwyane Wade, said:   Talking to all my NBA resources in the last couple of weeks, he's moved up the ladder.  He could be a late first-round pick. He's shown his toughness, his will to win. He brings all those little intangibles to the table that the elite players do. He's always making the right pass, always making the big shots, always making the big plays, always making his free throws....  The kid is a winner. He's always been a winner. 
Eamonn Brennan of ESPN announced the results of his College Basketball Production-Only Mock Draft in late May, meant to indicate how NBA teams would draft if they focused only at how college basketballs players played in college.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=5226116 |title=NBA mock draft based solely on college production  |author= Eamonn Brennan|publisher=ESPN|date=May 27, 2010 |accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl]  He ranked Scheyer 6th, saying that as a college player, Scheyer was "ruthlessly effective".
The Chicago Sun-Times opined that coaches Phil Jackson of the Los Angeles Lakers and Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs might value Scheyer's ability to move without the ball, pass, and spot up for jumpers.  And one scout pointed to his poise, leadership, feel for the game, threat from the perimeter, smooth stroke, textbook form, and the vital role he played in the championship run, saying Scheyer can hold his own in the NBA and could be a solid backup point guard/no-stats-All-Star similar to Shane Battier.[tpl]cite web |last=Jones |first=Mike |url=http://www.csnwashington.com/04/07/10/Mike-Jones-Who-Will-The-Wizards-Take-In-/landing_wizards.html?blockID=211584&feedID=273 |title=Mike Jones: Who Will Wizards Take In Draft? |publisher=Comcast SportsNet Washington |date=April 7, 2010 |accessdate=April 8, 2010[/tpl]
Scheyer signed with Mark Bartelstein of Priority Sports.  Scheyer missed the NBA draft combine in late May and lost 10 pounds as he battled mononucleosis, which had him out for approximately three weeks and also forced him to miss his graduation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story/8017948/article-Former-Blue-Devils-hoping-to-fulfill-NBA-dreams?instance=most_popular |title=Former Blue Devils hoping to fulfill NBA dreams |work=The Herald Sun |date= |accessdate=June 25, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-06-23/sports/ct-spt-0624-locals-nba-draft--20100623_1_white-house-mock-drafts-list-draft-day |title=Scheyer looking to overcome odds again |work=Chicago Tribune |date= June 23, 2010|accessdate=June 25, 2010 | first=Shannon | last=Ryan[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Mcgavin |first=Patrick Z. |url=|title=Eldridge among crop looking for a way in |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date= |accessdate=June 25, 2010[/tpl] In June he participated in pre-draft workouts for ten teams, including the Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, Milwaukee Bucks, New Jersey Nets, San Antonio Spurs, Utah Jazz, Portland Trail Blazers, Sacramento Kings, and Phoenix Suns.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sacramentopress.com/headline/30851/Kings_work_out_final_prospects |title= Kings work out final prospects |publisher=Sacramento Press |date= |accessdate=June 25, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Enlund |first=Tom |url=http://www.jsonline.com/sports/bucks/95480684.html |title=Bucks carefully look at a batch of unknowns |work=JS Online |date= |accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://ktar.com/?sid=1307950&nid=112 |title=Final workout group includes Duke star |publisher=KTAR.com |date= |accessdate=June 25, 2010[/tpl]  "I've spent more time at airports than with teams", said Scheyer, "but it's such a great opportunity."
The Dallas Morning News reported in May 2010 that a NBA draft projection of NBADraft.net had the Dallas Mavericks selecting Scheyer with their first pick of the draft (the draft's 50th overall pick).[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/stories/051710dnspomockdraft.e676b89.html |title=Mock draft: Mavericks to take former Duke star in next month's NBA draft |work=The Dallas Morning News |date= |accessdate=May 18, 2010[/tpl]  Bleacher Report carried a mock draft article predicting him being drafted 51st by Oklahoma City, and Yahoo carried one predicting he would be drafted 53rd by the Atlanta Hawks.[tpl]cite web|last=Mike |first=By |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=ys-mockdraft2round062410 |title=Mock draft: Take 6, Round 2 – NBA  |publisher= Yahoo!

Draft Express compared 19 top shooting guards in the draft, on the basis of detailed points-per-possession statistics generated by Synergy Sports Technology.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.draftexpress.com/article/Situational-Statistics-This-Yearas-Shooting-Guard-Crop-3502/ |title=Situational Statistics: This Year's Shooting Guard Crop |publisher=Draft Express |date= |accessdate=June 11, 2010[/tpl]  It found that Scheyer ranked as the most efficient overall scorer (at 1.054 PPP). His jump shooting ability when open gave him success in spot-up situations (1.16 PPP), but he also ranked well above average in isolation (.938 PPP; 3rd), and was the most effective pick and roll player on the list (1.16 PPP).
Duke Coach K said he could be a second-round pick,  but I'm not sure if that's even the best thing for him because when you're a second-round pick, you belong to a team....  I think it would be better to go to the team that really wants him because there will be teams that want He's going to be a good pro. 
He was not drafted, however, in the 2010 NBA Draft.  Coach K elaborated on what he had said before the draft:  "In the second round, it's better not to be drafted. As soon as the draft is over, if you are good enough, you will be invited by five or six teams, and you will have a chance to choose who you will play summer league ball with.  I would be a little bit surprised if is not on an NBA roster playing next season."[tpl]cite web|last=Stern |first=Rachel |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/06/29/556448/hes-still-coaching.html#ixzz0ssUkMpdL |title=He's still coaching  |work=NewsObserver.com |date=June 29, 2010 |accessdate=July 6, 2010[/tpl]

===Miami Heat summer league team; Eye injury===

Scheyer played on the Miami Heat's 19-man 2010 NBA Las Vegas Summer League team.[tpl]cite web|author=Ira Winderman  |url=|title=Heat's Beasley and Chalmers linked to trade speculation |work=Sacramento Bee  |date=June 18, 2010 |accessdate=July 6, 2010[/tpl]  He hit the game-winning shot in the team's first game.  In the team's second game, however, in mid-July, he was poked in the eye by Golden State's Joe Ingles.  He suffered a serious, life-changing right eye injury.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/summerleague2010/players/sl_jon_scheyer/|title=Jon Scheyer-#13-Guard-Heat|accessdate=July 24, 2010|publisher=NBA.com[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Rick Behren |url=http://www.cslinsider.com/news/scheyerstillhealingfromfreakeyeinjury.aspx |title=News |publisher=Cslinsider.com |date=August 10, 2010 |accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl]  He needed five stitches to close a cut to his right eyelid, his eye's optic nerve was injured, and he suffered a tear in its retina, which was re-attached surgically.[tpl]cite web|author= Rick Behren |url=http://www.cslinsider.com/news/scheyerstillhealingfromfreakeyeinjury.aspx |title=Scheyer still healing from 'freak' eye injury |publisher=CSL Insider  |date=August 10, 2010 |accessdate=August 11, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/sports/ci_16223139 |title=Clippers Notebook: Undrafted rookie Scheyer has taken his lumps |work=Pasadena Star-News |date=March 9, 2010 |accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story/14231018/article-Scheyer-remains-optimistic-about-future-in-NBA?instance=most_popular |title=Scheyer remains optimistic about future in NBA |work=The Herald-Sun |date=June 15, 2011 |author= Steve Weisman|accessdate=June 28, 2011[/tpl]

===LA Clippers training camp===

On September 22, 2010, Scheyer accepted a training camp invitation with the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nba.fanhouse.com/2010/09/22/jon-scheyer-to-attend-training-camp-with-clippers/|author= Scott Schroeder|title=Jon Scheyer to Attend Training Camp With Clippers |publisher=NBA FanHouse |date=September 22, 2010 |accessdate=October 2, 2010[/tpl]  Coach Vinny Del Negro observed:
 He just knows how to play, and that's a basketball skill. He's got such a nice feel for the game, and works so hard. There's not much maintenance with him. He doesn't make a lot of mistakes.  This is a good chance to take a long look, and see what he can do here. 
It was just two months following his serious eye injury, however, and he was not 100%.  On October 9, he was waived.[tpl]cite news|url=http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/10/09/clippers-cut-jake-voskuhl-and-jon-scheyer/ |title=Clippers cut Jake Voskuhl and Jon Scheyer |publisher=NBC |author=Rob Mahoney |date=October 9, 2010 |accessdate=March 24, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/clippers/news/breakingnews_101009.html|title=Clippers Waive Three|accessdate=October 23, 2010|date=October 9, 2010|publisher=NBA.com[/tpl]

===Houston Rockets' D-League team===

After taking time off to let his eye heal fully, on February 17, 2011, Scheyer signed a contract with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers, the Houston Rockets D-League team, which had 16 games left in their season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.themonitor.com/sports/scheyer-47304-duke-former.html |title=Former Duke star Scheyer to make Vipers debut |work=The Monitor |author= David Hinojosa|date=February 21, 2011 |accessdate=March 24, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/nba/news/story?id=6129620 |title=Former Duke star Jon Scheyer signed an NBADL contract with Rio Grande |author=Jon Greenberg|publisher=ESPN |date=February 16, 2011 |accessdate=March 24, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Payne |first=Terrence |url=http://dimemag.com/2011/03/now-in-the-d-league-jon-scheyer-is-one-step-closer-to-the-nba/ |title=Now In The D-League, Jon Scheyer Is One Step Closer To The NBA |work=Dime Magazine |author= |date=March 9, 2011 |accessdate=March 24, 2011[/tpl]  He had turned down several offers from overseas, and offers from other D-League teams.
Scheyer said his eye had healed from the traumatic injury that he suffered in the NBA Summer League.  He wore goggles on the court, but said that he didn't notice them, for the most part.  On March 14, he had a D-League career-high 21 points and 7 assists against Sioux Falls Skyforce, the next night he broke those personal records with 24 points and 8 assists, and four nights later he scored a new career-high 27 points which included five three-pointers.[tpl]cite news|author=From Vipers Reports |url=http://www.themonitor.com/sports/vipers-48021-doom-free.html |title=Free throws doom Vipers |work = The Monitor |date=March 15, 2011 |accessdate=March 24, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.keloland.com/Sports/NewsDetail7986.cfm?Id=112246 |title=Skyforce Fall To Vipers By Nine |author=Jonah Goldberg |publisher=Keloland.com |date=March 15, 2011 |accessdate=March 24, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.krgv.com/sports/story/Ole-Vipers-Tame-Austin-Toros/3xa8RjazykeQpA63WZL85g.cspx |title=Ole!

Coach K said:  "He got back on the horse. He did very well.... I'd like to see him go play internationally and be a key guy."

===Maccabi Tel Aviv===

In June 2011, Scheyer signed a two-year contract worth a reported $450,000 with Euroleague contender Maccabi Tel Aviv, the European league's 2011 runner-up and five-time champion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.euroleague.net/news/i/86139/180/maccabi-electra-adds-promising-guard-scheyer |title=Maccabi Electra adds promising guard Scheyer |publisher=Euroleague.net |date= June 19, 2011|author= |accessdate=June 28, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.maccabi.co.il/News.asp?id=3012&language=english |title=Maccabi Electra Tel Aviv BasketBall Club |publisher=Maccabi.co.il |date=June 20, 2011 |author= |accessdate=June 28, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=June 20, 2011 |url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2011/06/20/3088214/maccabi-tel-aviv-basketball-team-signs-jon-scheyer |title=Ex-Duke guard Jon Scheyer signs with Maccabi Tel Aviv |publisher=JTA |date=June 20, 2011 |accessdate=June 28, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Gershman |first=Andrew |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/sports/article/former_duke_basketball_star_jon_scheyer_joins_maccabi_tel-aviv_20110622/ |title=Former Duke basketball star Jon Scheyer joins Maccabi Tel-Aviv |work=Jewish Journal |date=June 22, 2011 |accessdate=June 28, 2011[/tpl] Maccabi Tel Aviv was 26–1 in 2010–11, and includes NBA guard Jordan Farmar and former American college players Richard Hendrix (Alabama), Shawn James (Duquesne), and David Blu (University of Southern California).[tpl]cite news|url=http://heraldsun.com/view/full_story/14379666/article-Scheyer-to-play-in-Israel?instance=main_article |title=Scheyer to play in Israel |work=The Herald-Sun |date=June 20, 2011 |author=Steve Wiseman |accessdate=June 28, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.euroleague.net/euroleaguenews/transactions/2011-12-signings/i/86177/5611/maccabi-electra-reels-in-swingman-smith |title=Maccabi Electra reels in swingman Smith – 2011–12 Signings |author= Yarone Arbel|publisher=Euroleague.net |date= June 23, 2011|accessdate=June 28, 2011[/tpl]  He began playing for Maccabi Tel Aviv when its season started on October 1, 2011.http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?id=marquja01&year=Career&t=b
