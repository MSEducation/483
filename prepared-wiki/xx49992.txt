CATEGORIES: Prime Ministers of Norway, 1873 introductions

The Prime Minister of Norway ([tpl]lang-no|statsminister[/tpl], literally "state minister") is the political leader of Norway and the Head of the Government of Norway.  The Prime Minister and Cabinet (consisting of all the most senior government department heads) are collectively accountable for their policies and actions to the Monarch, to Stortinget (Parliament), to their political party, and ultimately the electorate.
Norway has a constitution, which was adopted on 17 May 1814.[tpl]cite news |title=NORWAY'S STRUGGLE WITH HER KING.|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9507E0D9143DE533A25752C1A9679D94639FD7CF|work=The New York Times |date=11 November 1882 |language=|accessdate=3 February 2009 | format=PDF[/tpl]  The position of Prime Minister is the result of legislation. Modern Prime Ministers have few statutory powers, but provided they can command the support of their parliamentary party, they can control both the legislature and the executive (the Cabinet) and hence wield considerable de facto powers. As of [tpl]CURRENTYEAR[/tpl], the Prime Minister of Norway is Erna Solberg, of the Conservative Party.
