[[Puerto Rico Highway 189]]

CATEGORIES: Highways in Puerto Rico

Puerto Rico Highway 189 is a [tpl]convert|15|km|0[/tpl] long main highway which parallels very closely the first half of Puerto Rico Highway 30 from Caguas, Puerto Rico near downtown to Juncos, Puerto Rico passing through all three business centers of Caguas, Gurabo and Juncos. It ends at Puerto Rico Highway 31, and has no direct intersection with Puerto Rico Highway 198 although they are not separated by more than half a kilometer. It is not a good option to bypass the frequent traffic jams in PR-30 and is seriously damaged with holes and cracks, this being a sign of not been well maintained by the government agencies in the municipalities it goes through.
