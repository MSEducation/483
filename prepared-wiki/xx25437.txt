VESA ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|v|eɪ|s|ə[/tpl]; Video Electronics Standards Association) is an international standards body for computer graphics formed in 1988 by NEC Home Electronics, maker of the MultiSync monitor line, and eight video display adapter manufacturers: ATI Technologies, Genoa Systems, Orchid Technology, Renaissance GRX, STB Systems, Tecmar, Video 7 and Western Digital/Paradise Systems.NEC Forms Video Standards Group, InfoWorld, Nov 14, 1988
VESA's initial goal was to produce a standard for 800x600 SVGA resolution video displays. Since then VESA has issued a number of standards, mostly relating to the function of video peripherals in personal computers.
In November 2010, VESA announced a cooperative agreement with the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig)  for sharing technology expertise and specifications to develop multi-gigabit wireless DisplayPort capabilities. DisplayPort is a VESA technology that provides digital display connectivity.

==Criticisms==

VESA has been criticized for their policy of charging non-members for some of their published standards. Some people[tpl]Who|date=June 2011[/tpl] believe the practice of charging for specifications has undermined the purpose of the VESA organization. According to Kendall Bennett, developer of the VBE/AF standard, the VESA Software Standards Committee was closed down due to a lack of interest resulting from charging high prices for specifications.Re: vm86 in kernel  At that time no VESA standards were available for free. Although VESA now hosts some free standards documents, the free collection does not include newly developed standards. Even for obsolete standards, the free collection is incomplete. As of 2010, current standards documents from VESA cost hundreds, or thousands, of dollars each.  Some older standards are not available for free, or for purchase. As of 2010, the free downloads require mandatory registration.VESA PUBLIC STANDARDS DOWNLOAD REGISTRATION  While not all standards bodies provide specifications freely available for download, many do, including: ITU, JEDEC, DVI, and HDMI (through HDMI 1.3a).
At the time DisplayPort was announced, VESA was criticized for developing the specification in secret and having a track record of developing unsuccessful digital interface standards, including Plug & Display and Digital Flat Panel.Commentary: Will VESA survive DisplayPort?
