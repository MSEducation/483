==Commissioners==

Mike Tranghese retired at the end of the 2008–09 academic year, which he announced in June 2008, and was replaced by former senior associate commissioner John Marinatto. On May 7, 2012, John Marinatto resigned as commissioner. He was replaced by Joseph Bailey on an interim basis.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/7899745/big-east-commish-john-marinatto-quits-amid-shifting-landscape |title=Big East commish John Marinatto quits amid shifting landscape - ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2012-05-07 |accessdate=2012-07-19[/tpl] Mike Aresco, the Executive Vice President of CBS Sports' Programming, was named Commissioner of The Big East on August 14, 2012.[tpl]cite web|title=Mike Aresco Named BIG EAST Conference Commissioner|url=http://www.bigeast.org/News/tabid/435/Article/236098/Mike-Aresco-Named-BIG-EAST-Conference-Commissioner.aspx|publisher=bigeast.org|accessdate=14 August 2012[/tpl]  After the old Big East changed its name to the American Athletic Conference, Aresco continued as commissioner.  The new Big East named Val Ackerman as commissioner on July 1, but reckons her as its fifth commissioner.

==Sports==

The Big East Conference sponsored championship competition in eleven men's and thirteen women's NCAA sanctioned sports.http://www.bigeast.org Temple was an Associate member for football, and Loyola, Maryland was an Associate member for women's lacrosse.
NOTE: Under NCAA rules reflecting the large number of male scholarship participants in football and attempting to address gender equity concerns (see also Title IX), each football playing member institution is required to provide two more women's varsity sports than men's.[tpl]cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/che-data/articles.dir/articles-39.dir/issue-41.dir/41a03502.htm |title=Title IX rules related to SEC participation |publisher=The Chronicle |accessdate=December 6, 2011[/tpl]

==Men's basketball==

The Big East was founded by seven charter schools in 1979 (Providence, St. John's, Georgetown, Syracuse, Seton Hall, Connecticut, and Boston College).[tpl]cite web| title=about the Big East|url =http://www.bigeast.org/AbouttheBIGEAST.aspx |accessdate =August 27, 2012[/tpl] Villanova joined the following year, followed by Pittsburgh in 1982.
Georgetown, led by senior Sleepy Floyd and freshman Patrick Ewing, made the NCAA Championship Game in 1982. Just two years later, in 1984, Georgetown won the Big East's first NCAA basketball championship with a victory over the University of Houston.
The following year three Big East teams (Villanova, St. John's, and Georgetown) all advanced to the Final Four, culminating in Villanova's stunning championship game victory over the heavily favored Georgetown Hoyas. The conference's 1985 success was nearly duplicated in 1987, when Syracuse and a surprising Providence both made the Final Four, followed by the Orangemen's narrow loss to Indiana University in the tournament final. Two years later, the Seton Hall Pirates also advanced to the NCAA Championship Game, but were defeated by the Michigan Wolverines in an overtime heartbreaker.
Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Georgetown, Villanova, St. John's, and Syracuse were the primary powers in the conference. UConn became a power in 1990 with a # 1 seed and a trip to the Elite 8 before being defeated by Duke. Georgetown was led by John Thompson Jr., who was named three times as the conference Coach of the Year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2007/02/10/GR2007021000283.html|title=A Century of Georgetown Basketball|work=The Washington Post |accessdate=March 4, 2008|date=February 10, 2007[/tpl] They won five regular season conference championships and six Big East Tournaments to go with their 1984 national title.[tpl]cite web|url=http://guhoyas.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/gu/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/gu-mbb-mg0708-trad|title=Tradition|work=Georgetown Hoyas Men's Basketball Media Guide|publisher=Georgetown University|format=PDF|accessdate=March 4, 2008[/tpl]  Villanova was coached by Rollie Massimino, who led them to the 1985 NCAA Championship in a historic 66–64 win over No. 1 ranked Georgetown where forward Ed Pinckney was named the Most Outstanding Player.  In their first 11 seasons in the Big East, Villanova made 9 trips to the NCAA Tournament including advancing to the NCAA Elite Eight in 1982, 1983 and 1988 as well as their 1985 Championship season. Massimino coached for 19 seasons at Villanova, compiling a record of 357–241 (.596). In the NCAA Tournament, Massimino had an incredible 20–10 record (.667).  St. John's was led by Lou Carnesecca, who won the National Coach of the Year honor in 1983 and 1985. He led the Redmen (now the Red Storm) to the 1985 Final Four, and made a post-season appearance in each of his 24 years at the helm. Syracuse has been led by alumnus Jim Boeheim since the 1977 season. He was named conference Coach of the Year in 1984 and 1991. During this period, the Orangemen won five regular season conference championships, three Big East Tournaments, and were invited to the NCAA Tournament every year but two (1981 and 1982), losing the 1987 National Final to Indiana. Syracuse eventually won its first national title in 2003, led by coach Boeheim and freshman Carmelo Anthony.
Beginning with their first Big East championship in 1990, Connecticut has become the preeminent power in the Big East. Over the past two decades, UConn has made many deep runs in NCAA tournament, playing in the Elite 8 nine times and making four appearances in the Final Four.  Hall of Fame coach Jim Calhoun's program, led by such stars as Ray Allen, Richard "Rip" Hamilton, Caron Butler, Emeka Okafor and Kemba Walker, averaged nearly 26 wins per year during that time span, won numerous Big East regular season and tournament championships, and claimed the National Championship in 1999, 2004 and 2011.
The conference got a then record eight teams into the NCAA Men's Tournament in 2006 and again matched their own record in both 2008 and 2010. At the start of the 2008–2009 season, many sports analysts predicted that the conference would surpass the record by sending 10 teams to the 2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. When the brackets were revealed, seven made it, but three of them (Louisville, Pittsburgh and Connecticut) gained No. 1 seeds, and Louisville earned the top seed overall. Connecticut and Villanova (a No. 3 seed) both reached the Final Four. At the finish of the 2010–11 season, the Big East eclipsed its record, sending 11 teams to the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament[tpl]cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/bracketology|title=Bracketology with Joe Lunardi|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=March 6, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110303155719/http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/bracketology| archivedate= March 3, 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/bracketology|title=Predicting the 2011 NCAA tournament field|publisher=CBSSports|accessdate=March 6, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110208222913/http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/bracketology| archivedate= February 8, 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/andy_glockner/03/06/sunday.bubble.watch/index.html|title=Bubble Watch: Power leagues have fingers crossed for tourney week|publisher=CNNSI|accessdate=March 6, 2011|date=March 6, 2011[/tpl]
The conference has a number of former players currently playing in the National Basketball Association with some of the most recent being Ray Allen, Caron Butler, Carmelo Anthony, Ryan Gomes, Austin Croshere, Richard "Rip" Hamilton, Ben Gordon, Emeka Okafor, Troy Murphy, Hakim Warrick, Quincy Douby, Dante Cunningham, Randy Foye, Kyle Lowry, Rudy Gay, Matt Carroll, Jake Voskuhl, Etan Thomas, Samuel Dalembert, Charlie Villanueva, Donte Greene, Ron Artest, Chris Quinn, Jason Hart, Tim Thomas, Aaron Gray, Sam Young, DeJuan Blair, Wilson Chandler, Jeff Green, Joe Alexander, Marcus Williams, Jonny Flynn, Terrence Williams, Earl Clark, Roy Hibbert, Wesley Johnson, Wesley Matthews, Lazar Hayward, Jimmy Butler, Steve Novak, Jae Crowder, Maalik Wayns, and Darius Johnson-Odom.

==Women's basketball==

Big East women's basketball was nearly as powerful as the conference's men's programs.[tpl]Who|date=April 2010[/tpl] Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma has led his women's team to eight national championships (including four between 2000 and 2004) and four undefeated seasons (1995, 2002, 2009, and 2010). Connecticut set the record for longest winning streak in all of NCAA women's basketball history with a 70-game winning streak stretching from 2001–2003. This streak was ended in 2003 when Villanova beat Connecticut for the Big East tournament title, in what is considered one of the biggest upsets in women's basketball (Villanova would go on to reach the Elite Eight that year). The Huskies broke their own record with consecutive unbeaten championship seasons in 2009 and 2010, and stretched their streak to 90, a Division I record for both sexes, before losing to Stanford during the 2010–11 season.
Due to the strength of the Connecticut program, 2001 national champion and 2011 and 2012 national runner-up Notre Dame, and 2007 national runner-up Rutgers, the Big East has emerged as one of the major powers in women's college basketball. In 2009 two Big East schools met in the national championship game (Connecticut and Louisville) and the South Florida women's basketball team defeated Kansas to become the WNIT champions. 
In 2011, UConn and Notre Dame both made the Final Four; the Irish defeated the Huskies in their semifinal but lost to Texas A&M in the NCAA Championship Game. The Irish returned to the championship game in 2012, losing there to unbeaten Baylor.
The final season under the original conference structure, 2012–13, saw three Big East teams make the Final Four—UConn, Notre Dame, and Louisville. UConn first defeated Notre Dame in the semifinals and, in a rematch of the 2009 final, defeated Louisville for the national title.

==Football==

Big East began football during the 1991–1992 season with the addition of Miami and was a founding member of the Bowl Championship Series.[tpl]cite web| title=BCS Chronology | url=http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history | work=bcsfootball.org | publisher=Fox Sports | accessdate=November 12, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080418091328/http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history |archivedate = April 18, 2008[/tpl] The league obtained immediate legitimacy with the addition of powerhouse Miami.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
In the league's early years the University of Miami dominated, winning nine of the first thirteen championships and two national championships in 1991 and 2001. Virginia Tech also did well, winning the conference in 1995, 1996, and in 1999, when they also earned a No. 2 national ranking. West Virginia and Syracuse were the only other teams to win conference titles during the league's original alignment.
The conference experienced a major reconstruction when Miami and Virginia Tech left for the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2004, followed by Boston College in 2005. Initially, Syracuse University was in place to make the jump instead of Virginia Tech, but in 2003, the governor of Virginia Mark Warner put pressure on the ACC (via the vote of the University of Virginia) to ensure that Virginia Tech was not left out of the conference expansion. Syracuse, then, was not invited to the ACC and was left to remain in the Big East. 
Temple had joined the Big East for football only in 1991, but found it difficult to compete with the other league teams and drew very poor attendance to its games. The conference was compelled to expel the Owls voluntarily in 2004 (after playing two seasons as an independent, Temple joined the MAC in 2007).
The universities that replaced them were Louisville, South Florida and Cincinnati from Conference USA. The league also invited the University of Connecticut to play football a year earlier than planned. At about this time, the BCS announced that it would adjust the automatic bids granted to its six founding conferences based on results from 2004–07, and that there would be five, six, or seven such bids starting in 2008. The obvious inference was that soon the Big East might lose its bid.
The conference’s fortunes improved in 2005. The three new teams from Conference USA began play that year, restoring the league to eight teams. West Virginia won the conference title and the Sugar Bowl,[tpl]cite web| title=All-Time Results | url=http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/results | work=bcsfootball.org | publisher=Fox Sports | accessdate=November 12, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080418005305/http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/results |archivedate = April 18, 2008[/tpl] and finished 11–1 and finished No. 5 in the AP poll. Newcomer Louisville also ranked in the Top 20.
In 2006, West Virginia, Louisville, and Rutgers all entered November undefeated. However, they did not stay that way, as in a trio of exciting games over the next month, Louisville defeated West Virginia 44–34, Rutgers defeated Louisville 28–25, and West Virginia defeated Rutgers 41–39 in three overtimes. Rutgers’ resurgence after a century of mostly futile play was a national story,[tpl]Who|date=April 2010[/tpl] but Louisville won the conference title in the end. In bowl action, the Big East went 5–0, including an Orange Bowl victory for Louisville over Wake Forest and a win by West Virginia over Georgia Tech in the Gator Bowl. Louisville would finish the season ranked 6th, West Virginia 10th, and Rutgers 12th in the final AP Poll.
In 2007, USF rose to No. 2 in the BCS rankings. They lost their next three games, however, to drop out of the rankings. They eventually finished the season No. 21 in the final BCS polls. The Connecticut Huskies, getting as high as No. 13, and West Virginia remained in the top 25. Cincinnati also rose as high as No. 15 in the rankings eventually finishing the season with 10 wins and a No. 17 ranking.  Connecticut lost subsequent games and dropped substantially in the rankings, ultimately finishing 25th. On the final day of the season, Pittsburgh upset No. 2 WVU 13–9 in the 100th edition of the Backyard Brawl to give the Huskies a share of the conference championship, while WVU was stopped on the doorstep of the BCS National Championship Game. In bowl games, WVU upset the Big 12 Champion Oklahoma in the Fiesta Bowl, despite having lost their highly touted coach, Rich Rodriguez to Michigan less than a month before the game. West Virginia finished the season ranked No. 6 and Cincinnati finished ranked #17.
The 2009 season saw Cincinnati finish the regular season undefeated at 12–0 and climb to No. 3 in the final BCS standings. After completing a fourth quarter comeback to beat Pittsburgh on the final day of the season, the Bearcats narrowly missed a spot in the BCS national championship game, as No. 2 Texas pulled out a last second win in the Big 12 Championship Game. The Bearcats would go on to lose the Sugar Bowl to No. 5 Florida and finish the year 12–1.
On September 18, 2011, both Pittsburgh and Syracuse were accepted as Atlantic Coast Conference members although the exact date of the move is still uncertain. ("ESPN".) There are also rumors that UConn is also looking to leave the Big East and join Pittsburgh and Syracuse in the ACC. ("ESPN".) On October 28, 2011, West Virginia announced it was leaving the Big East to join the Big 12 in 2012.  TCU, who had accepted an invitation to join the Big East in the 2012 season, withdrew its acceptance and instead accepted an invitation to join the Big 12.
In 2011, as a response to major shifts in the college football conference landscape, the conference added five new members to help offset the losses of Pittsburgh, Syracuse, and West Virginia. On December 7, 2011, the conference officially added the University of Houston, Southern Methodist University, and the University of Central Florida as all-sports members. Additionally, Boise State and San Diego State of the Mountain West Conference were added as football-only members,[tpl]cite web | date = December 7, 2011 | title = Big East Conference Goes West, Announces The Addition of Five Universities | publisher=Big East Conference | url = http://www.bigeast.org/News/tabid/435/Article/229956/big-east-conference-goes-west-announces-the-addition-of-five-universities.aspx | accessdate =December 12, 2011[/tpl] but Boise State eventually decided not to join the Big East, which allowed San Diego State to withdraw without penalty.

===Champions===

No official championship awarded in 1991 and 1992, as the conference did not start full league play until 1993.
Louisville received the BCS bid since they were the highest ranked team in the final BCS poll.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bigeast.org/News/tabid/435/Article/239827/Louisville-Tops-Rutgers-to-Earn-BIG-EAST-Title-and-BCS-Berth.aspx | title=Louisville Tops Rutgers to Earn BIG EAST Title and BCS Berth | accessdate=December 15, 2012[/tpl]

==Men's lacrosse==

In 2010, the Big East created a men's lacrosse league with Georgetown, Notre Dame, Providence, Rutgers, St. John’s, Syracuse, and Villanova participating.BIG EAST Announces the Formation of Men’s Lacrosse League for 2010 Season – BIG EAST Conference Athletics  Men's lacrosse is the 24th sport sponsored by the Big East Conference and is the 11th men's sport. The teams play a six-game single round-robin regular-season schedule. There was no Big East men's lacrosse championship tournament in 2010 and 2011. Instead, the Big East champion was determined by conference-game winning percentage at the conclusion of the regular season. This winner received the league's automatic bid to the 16-team NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship.  The first Big East championship tournament was played beginning in the 2012 season.
Of the Big East men's lacrosse schools in the 2013 season, the final season under the original conference structure:

==Cross country==

The Big East Conference first crowned men's cross country champions in 1979 and women's cross country champions in 1982. During the history of the original Big East, six different women's teams won Big East Championships: Boston College, Georgetown, Notre Dame, Providence, Villanova and West Virginia. On the men's side six teams won Big East Championships as well: Georgetown, Louisville, Notre Dame, Providence, Syracuse and Villanova.[tpl]dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl]
In both the 2009 and 2010 season, the Villanova women captured the NCAA Cross Country Team Championship as they have largely dominated the Big East over the years with numerous Conference Titles. Led by Sheila Reid, a junior from New Market,Ont. who won the 2010 individual champion, the top-ranked Wildcats captured their second straight NCAA Division I women’s cross country championship.  Reid sprinted past Georgetown’s Emily Infeld and Oregon's Jordan Hasay in the final 200 meters to win the individual title.  It was the Villanova Women’s ninth NCAA Team Championship overall in Cross Country.  The Wildcats captured six consecutive NCAA Championships from 1989–94 and also won the title again in 1998, 2009 and 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.delcotimes.com/articles/2010/11/22/sports/doc4ceab103a2d71574675863.txt |title=Villanova women win NCAA cross country championship |publisher=delcotimes.com |date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=2012-07-19[/tpl]

Notes:
 
1 For certain high-profile home games, Cincinnati uses the Cincinnati Bengals' Paul Brown Stadium. In 2010, Cincinnati hosted the University of Oklahoma at Paul Brown Stadium. In 2011, Cincinnati used Paul Brown Stadium as an alternate home field for games against Louisville and West Virginia.
 
2 Late in 2006, Rutgers added approximately 3,000 temporary end zone seats that remained for the 2007 season (total 45,000). In 2008, Rutgers began a stadium expansion project which is expected to increase capacity to over 55,000 seats and add luxury and club seats. The premium seating is projected to be ready for the 2008 season and the additional 12,000 end zone seats are expected for the 2009 season. The stadium is also expected to receive a new name as part of the financing package depends on a name sponsorship.
 
3 St. John's men generally play their Big East home schedule in Madison Square Garden and their non-conference home schedule on campus at Carnesecca Arena. In 2005–06, St. John's played only one non-conference game at MSG and one Big East game on campus.
 
4 For Syracuse basketball games in the Carrier Dome, the court is laid out on one end of the field and stands are erected beside it. This makes the Carrier Dome the largest on-campus venue for college basketball in the nation.
 
5 For certain high-profile home games, Villanova uses the Wells Fargo Center, and previously used the Spectrum. In 2005–06, Villanova played three home games at the Wells Fargo Center and the rest on campus at The Pavilion. In 2006, the Wells Fargo Center was also a first-round site for the NCAA Tournament. Under NCAA rules, a venue is not considered a home court unless a school plays four or more regular-season games there; this enabled Villanova to play its first two tournament games at the Wells Fargo Center (but Villanova was not considered the host school for that sub-region – the Atlantic 10 Conference was). This situation occurred again in 2009, with Villanova playing (and winning) its first two tournament games at Wells Fargo Center.
