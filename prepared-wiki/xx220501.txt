Between independence in 1966 and the 1990s, Barbados has used a pro business and investment policy to expand its influence in the world.  Through the usage of its network of international bilateral relations, the country has been able to maintain an independent foreign policy.  Barbados' recent policy has been to focus and strengthen ties with nations that country feels will enhance its diplomacy or foreign trade. Barbados has sought to engage in multilateral diplomacy through the United Nations, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), the group of ACP countries, the Organization of American States, and several other agencies which it is engaged.  In 2008 Barbados and the other members of CARICOM signed an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union and its European Commission.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cbc.bb/index.pl/article1?id=2195973|title=Barbados stands to benefit significantly from its services under the EPA between Europe and Caricom |publisher=Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=2009-05-15[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The deal covers CARICOM's membership in the Caribbean Forum (CARIFORUM).
