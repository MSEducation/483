Fisher More Academy (formerly Regina Coeli Academy) is a Catholic, online homeschooling school in the United States.  It serves students from grade 4 to grade 12 through audio, text, and other online media.

==History==

The school was founded in 1995 by Linda Robinson, Allen Taylor, and David Manley of St. Agnes Catholic Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana as a mission of the Institute for Study of the Liberal Arts and Sciences (ISLAS), a non-profit corporation dedicated to the development of internet programs for home educators and small schools.
In 2012, Regina Coeli Academy merged with Fisher More College to provide online learning for students from elementary through college.

==Curriculum==

Its stated mission is to "support, but not to supplant, the homeschool parent as primary educator by providing a rigorous college preparatory and classical homeschool curriculum which challenges the intellect and nourishes the spirit with the riches of the Catholic tradition. Our homeschool curriculum contains both live interactive courses as well as self-directed study courses hence allowing structure but also flexibility as sometimes needed for the homeschool student."Regina Coeli Academy website
The school's high school curriculum includes:
The school also operates a program called the Agnus Dei Junior Program, which covers a basic junior-high curriculum.

==Hereditas Magazine==

Fisher More Academy publishes a Catholic literary magazine titled "Hereditas". It was started on September 11, 2004, and publishes submissions from the school's students, faculty parents, as well others outside the school, such as clergy, essayists and novelists. Submissions range from scholarly essays, to humorous works, film and book reviews, and Latin poetry. The magazine is published quarterly.

==Miscellany & traditions==

The school received the Apostolic Blessing from Pope John Paul II.
Because of the wide dispersion of faculty and students, numerous gatherings have been orchestrated. A recent gathering took place in Washington DC at the March for Life.
