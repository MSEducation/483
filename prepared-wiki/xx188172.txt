[[Benedikt syndrome]]

CATEGORIES: Stroke, Rare diseases, Syndromes

Benedikt syndrome, also called Benedikt's syndrome or paramedian midbrain syndrome, is a rare type of posterior circulation stroke of the brain, with a range of neurological symptoms affecting the midbrain, cerebellum and other related structures.

==Characterization==

It is characterized by the presence of an  oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsy and cerebellar ataxia including tremor.  Neuroanatomical structures affected include CNIII nucleus, Red nucleus, corticospinal tracts, brachium conjunctivum, and the superior cerebellar peduncle decussation. It is very similar in etiology, morphology and clinical presentation to Weber's syndrome; the main difference between the two being that Weber's is more associated with hemiplegia (i.e. paralysis), and Benedikt's with hemiataxia (i.e. disturbed coordination of movements).

==Causes==

Benedikt syndrome is caused by a lesion ( infarction, hemorrhage, tumor, or tuberculosis) in the tegmentum of the midbrain and cerebellum. Specifically, the median zone is impaired. It can result from occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery [tpl]cite journal |pmid=15607218 |date=Jan 2005 |author=Akdal G, Kutluk K, Men S, Yaka E |title=Benedikt and "plus-minus lid" syndromes arising from posterior cerebral artery branch occlusion |volume=228 |issue=1 |pages=105–107 |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2004.09.029 |journal=Journal of the neurological sciences[/tpl] or paramedian penetrating branches of the basilar artery.AMA citation: Greenberg DA, Simon RP.

==Treatment==

Deep brain stimulation may provide relief from some symptoms of Benedikt syndrome, particularly the tremors associated with the disorder.[tpl]cite journal |pmid=18826349 |date=Oct 2008 |author=Bandt SK, Anderson D, Biller J |title=Deep brain stimulation as an effective treatment option for post-midbrain infarction-related tremor as it presents with Benedikt syndrome |volume=109 |issue=4 |pages=635–639 |doi=10.3171/JNS/2008/109/10/0635 |journal=Journal of neurosurgery[/tpl]
