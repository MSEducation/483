Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]iōlani Hale is a building located in downtown Honolulu, Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i, currently used as the home of the Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i State Supreme Court. It is the former seat of government of the Kingdom of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i and the Republic of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i.
Located in the building's courtyard is the famed gold-leaf statue of Kamehameha the Great.

==Establishment and monarchy period==

The Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]iōlani Hale was designed by Australian Thomas Rowe in an Italian Renaissance Revival  as the royal palace for King Kamehameha V.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hawaiiforvisitors.com/oahu/attractions/aliiolani-hale.htm |title=Historic Aliiolani Hale - Hawaii State Judiciary Building |publisher=Hawaiiforvisitors.com |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2013[/tpl] In the Hawaiian language, Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]iōlani Hale means "House of the heavenly King"; also, the name "Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]iōlani" was one of the given names of Kamehameha V.
Although the building was designed to be a palace, Kamehameha V realized that the Hawaiian government desperately needed a government building. At that time, the several buildings in Honolulu used by the government were very small and cramped, clearly inadequate for the growing Hawaiian government. Thus, when Kamehameha V ordered construction of Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]iōlani Hale, he commissioned it as a government office building instead of a palace.
Kamehameha V laid the cornerstone for the building on February 19, 1872.[tpl]cite news|last=Song|first=Jaymes|title=Search Begins for Hawaiian King's Long Lost Time Capsule|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate |date= December 11, 2005 |page=4C[/tpl][tpl]cite news |author=Jaymes Song |title=Radar to search for royal time capsule |newspaper= Honolulu Star-Bulletin |date= December 10, 2005 |url= http://archives.starbulletin.com/2005/12/10/news/story04.html |accessdate= December 3, 2010 [/tpl] He died before the building was completed, and it was dedicated in 1874 by one of his successors, King David Kalākaua. At the time, Hawaiian media criticized the building's extravagant design, suggesting that the building be converted into a palace as originally designed.
Until 1893, the building held most of the executive departments of the Hawaiian government as well as the Hawaiian legislature and courts.

==Overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy==

It was from Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]iōlani Hale in 1893 that the Committee of Safety, under the leadership of Lorrin A. Thurston, deposed Queen Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani by public proclamation.
After the establishment of the Hawaiian provisional government in 1893 and the Republic of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i in 1894, some of the offices in Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]iōlani Hale were moved to [tpl]okina[/tpl]Iolani Palace, including the Hawaiian legislature. As a result, Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]iolani Hale became primarily a judicial building.

==Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]iōlani Hale since 1900==

thumb|left|Kamehameha Statue The growing size of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i's government continued to be a problem for the building, however, especially after Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i became a United States territory in 1900. In 1911, the building was extensively renovated to help solve these space problems. The entire interior of the building was gutted and rebuilt, giving the building's interior a completely new floorplan. Since the building was originally designed to be a palace, its floorplan was not adequate for its later usage as a judicial building. The new layout of the building fixed this problem.
The size of the territorial government continued to grow. In the 1940s, a new wing was added to the building to help alleviate the growing problem of overcrowding. The architects who designed the new wing tried to blend it in with the original building that dated back to the 1870s.
Over the next many decades, most of the state judiciary functions moved out of Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]iōlani Hale to various other buildings around Honolulu (including the state district, family, and circuit courts). Today, the building houses the Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i State Supreme Court and is the administrative center of the Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i State Judiciary. It also houses the Judiciary History Center, a museum featuring a multimedia presentation of Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i's judiciary, a restored historic courtroom, and other exhibits dealing with Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i's judicial history. The building also houses Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i's largest law library.  In 2010, John Andreoni's firm of King's Custom Koa won the contract to replace the koa wood doors.[tpl]cite news|last=Chiem|first=Linda|title=Hawaii woodworker carves a new business niche |newspaper=Pacific Business News |date= August 29, 2010[/tpl]
In December 2005, a capsule buried by Kamehameha V when he laid the cornerstone was located, at the direction of the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, by Professor Larry Connors of the University of Denver using ground penetrating radar. The capsule contained photos of royal families and the constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom, Hawaiian postage stamps, Hawaiian and foreign coinage, newspapers, a calendar and books.  The capsule was located to protect it during future renovations, and not retrieved due to concerns of damaging the structure of the building itself.[tpl]cite news|last=Song|first=Jaymes |title=Time Capsule of Hawaiian King Located |newspaper=The Victoria Advocate |date= December 12, 2005|page=A3[/tpl][tpl]cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Radar quickly pinpoints site of Kamehameha V capsule |newspaper= Honolulu Star-Bulletin |date= December 11, 2005 |url= http://archives.starbulletin.com/2005/12/11/news/story08.html |accessdate= December 3, 2010 [/tpl]

In the 2010 version of Hawaii Five-0, Ali[tpl]okina[/tpl]iōlani Hale is depicted as the headquarters for the Five-0 task force with exterior shots of the building being used throughout the series.
