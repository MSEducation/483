Whixall is a small and rural village and civil parish in Shropshire, England. 
The nearest towns are Whitchurch, to the north, and Wem, to the south.
The parish lies on the border with the county borough of Wrexham, Wales. Its close proximity to Wales is shown by a hamlet called Welsh End. 
Within the parish boundaries (encompassing seven square miles) are various hamlets including Abbey Green. The Llangollen Canal of the Shropshire Union Canal, as well as the short Prees Branch of the Ellesmere Canal, run through the parish.
Prees was the intended destination of the Prees Branch, however the arm was only completed as far as Quina Brook.  The arm is now known as the Prees Branch of the Llangollen Canal, and is navigavable for about a mile to Whixall Marina, the following 3/4 mile is still followable on the towpath as it passes through Prees Branch Canal Nature Reserve.http://www.wild-net.org/ukwebsite/TWTReserveDetails2.aspx?id=2974 The canal is crossed by Dobson's Bridge, a fixed humpback bridge, was classified in 1987 as a Grade Il listed building.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-428422-shropshire-union-canal-edstaston-branch-
