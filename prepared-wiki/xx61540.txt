The Peugeot 406 is a large family car made by the French automaker Peugeot from 1995 to 2004. Available in saloon, estate and coupé bodystyles with a choice of petrol or turbodiesel engines, the 406 replaced the Peugeot 405 in Peugeot's lineup, and was itself replaced by the Peugeot 407. It used the same platform as the Citroën Xantia, though without that car's sophisticated hydropneumatic suspension system.

==The project==

The styling of the 406 is heavily influenced by its predecessor, the 405, which remained on sale for a year in most Western markets while stocks were exhausted. The 405 estate even remained in production for over a year after the 406 went on sale.
Initially, the car was available with 1.8 L and 2.0 L petrol and 1.9 L turbodiesel engines, followed by a 110 bhp 2.1 L turbodiesel, turbocharged 2.0 L and 3.0 L petrol (2946cc) V6 engines. The diesel versions were very popular, and the 406 became one of Europe's best-selling diesel-powered cars.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl]
The 2-door coupé was both designed and manufactured by Italian design studio Pininfarina, with choices of a 2.0 L 4-cylinder engine or a 3.0 L V6, and from 2001, a 2.2 L HDi diesel engine. Major assembly was undertaken by Pininfarina, with final assembly, including trim and engines, being undertaken by Peugeot in France. On later models, a 2.2 L petrol engine was available.  Total of 107,633 coupés were made.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pininfarina.it/repository/Gruppo/Produzionecomplessiva.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110605081310/http://www.pininfarina.it/repository/Gruppo/Produzionecomplessiva.pdf|archivedate=2011-06-05|format=PDF|title=PRODUZIONE COMPLESSIVA|accessdate=2007-08-03|work=pininfarina.it[/tpl]
For its final year on sale in the United Kingdom, the model was simply called the Peugeot Coupé, with the 406 branding dropped from the name.
The 406 was notably successful in the United Kingdom, having broken into the key UK fleet sales market,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/carreviews/usedcartests/37507/peugeot_406.html |title=Peugeot 406 | Used Car Tests | Car Reviews |publisher=Auto Express |date=2003-06-17 |accessdate=2009-12-12[/tpl] with a high percentage of units becoming company cars and taxis.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl]
In 2002, a Peugeot 406 HDi set the world record for the longest distance driven on a single tank of fuel. The car travelled across Australia between Melbourne to Rockhampton, with a total distance of 2,348 km. http://www.fuelacademy.com/world_record_drives.html http://www.peugeot.co.nz/fuel-economy-world-records/
Knock-down kit versions of the car were also built at the Yontrakit Industrial Factory in Lad Krabang, Bangkok, Thailand.

The facelifted 406 sedan was introduced in 1999 and safety, strength and speed enhancements resulted in improved Euro NCAP performance. Where the old 406 had one star and a struck off star, the post facelift models gained 3 stars.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/results/peugeot/406.aspx |title=Euro NCAP |publisher=euroncap.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01[/tpl] The changes included the new and improved EW/DW Engine Family HDI with greater power, torque and fuel efficiency along with increased refinement, making it comparatively quiet for a diesel. A downside was an increase in the car's insurance group from 9 to 12.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.autotrader.co.uk/articles/2009/03/cars/peugeot/406/peugeot-406-car-review |title=Autotrader |publisher=autotrader.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-13[/tpl]
The exterior look was amended as the 406 featured more pronounced ribs, clear headlights, chrome trim and a new honeycomb grill. The rear lights were finished in red with a strip of the car's paint colour across the centre.
The interior was also redesigned to improve comfort and space. New equipment included automated digital climate control/air conditioning on most models except the most basic and a multi-function display for warning messages, trip computer, radio and external temperature. There was a more extensive use of wooden trim, better quality plastics, including soft touch plastics, and in addition some models received electrically folding mirrors, with automatic headlights and wipers. The top-of-the-range Executive model was specified a 10 speaker JBL sound system, electrically adjusted and heated leather seats, a memory position for the seats and mirrors, headlight washer jets, a rear sun blind, thicker carpeting, lights in the sun visors, satellite navigation and ambient lighting.
406 ended production in 2004.
