===Angulo===

Angulo is adjusting to a new trainer in Nacho Beristain. After his victory of Joachim Alcine in July 2010, he was deported to Mexico and went into a year long lay-off. He resumed fighting in August in Mexicali only because immigration issues prevent him from re-entering the states[tpl]cite web|last=Idec|first=Keith|title=Schaefer discusses Alfredo Angulo's Future, U.S. return|work=|publisher=Boxing Scene|date =August 23, 2011|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/schaefer-discusses-alfredo-angulos-future-us-return--42932|accessdate=September 22, 2011[/tpl] Angulo has knocked out all five opponents over the course of as many consecutive wins since losing to Kermit Cintron in May 2009.

===Kirkland===

Kirkland, 27, missed two years of his career from March 2009 to March of this year after being convicted of gun possession by a felon. While most expected him to emerge from prison like a man possessed, his performances have been uneven at times, culminating in the nightmarish performance against Nobuhiro Ishida on the Erik Morales-Marcos Maidana undercard. He rejoined with trainer Ann Wolfe, with whom he enjoyed his best success, and severed ties with Kenny Adams, who was designated as his trainer after his release from prison. Kirkland has scored two straight knockouts since being stopped in the first round in April by light-hitting Ishida.
