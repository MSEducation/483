[[Method of complements]]

CATEGORIES: Computer arithmetic

In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers. 
The nines' complement of a number is formed by replacing each digit with nine minus that digit. To subtract a decimal number y (the subtrahend) from another number x (the minuend), the nines' complement of y is added to x and one is added to the sum.  The leading digit  '1' of the result is then discarded. Discarding the initial '1' is especially convenient on calculators or computers that use a fixed number of digits: there is nowhere for it to go so it is simply lost during the calculation. The nines' complement plus one is known as the tens' complement.
The method of complements can be extended to other number bases (radixes); in particular, it is used on most digital computers to perform subtraction and represent negative numbers in base 2 or binary arithmetic.

==Numeric complements==

In the decimal numbering system, the radix complement is called the ten's complement and the diminished radix complement the nines' complement. In binary, the radix complement is called the two's complement and the diminished radix complement the ones' complement. The naming of complements in other bases is similar.  Some people, notably Donald Knuth, recommend using the placement of the apostrophe to distinguish between the radix complement and the diminished radix complement.  In this usage, the four's complement refers to the radix complement of a number in base four while fours' complement is the diminished radix complement of a number in base 5. However, the distinction is not important when the radix is apparent (nearly always), and the subtle difference in apostrophe placement is not common practice. Most writers use one's and nine's complement, and many style manuals leave out the apostrophe, recommending ones and nines complement.

==Decimal example==

To subtract a decimal number y from another number x using the method of complements, the ten's complement of y (the nines' complement plus 1) is added to x.  The nines' complement  of a decimal digit is the number that must be added to it to produce 9; the complement of 3 is 6, the complement of 7 is 2, and so on, see table. To form the nines' complement of a larger number, each digit is replaced by its nines' complement. For example, given the subtraction problem:
   873  (x, the minuend)
 - 218  (y, the subtrahend)
we compute the nines' complement of 218, which is 781. Because 218 is three digits long, this is the same as subtracting 218 from 999.
Next, the sum of x and the nines' complement of y is taken:
   873  (x)
 + 781  (nines' complement of y)
 =====
  1654
The leading "1" digit is then dropped, giving 654. 
  1654
 -1000  (y + nines' complement of y + 1) 
 =====
   654
This is not yet correct. We have essentially added 999 to the equation in the first step. Then we removed 1000 when we dropped the leading 1 in the result 1654 above. This will thus make the answer we get (654) one less than the correct answer. To fix this, we must add 1 to our answer:
  654
   +1
 ====
  655
Adding a 1 gives 655, the correct answer to our original subtraction problem.
If the subtrahend, y, has fewer digits than the minuend, x, leading zeros must be added, which will become leading nines when the complement is taken. For example:
   48032  (x)
 -   391  (y)
can be rewritten
   48032  (x)
 - 00391  (y with leading zeros)
Replacing 00391 with its nines' complement and adding 1 produces the sum:
   48032  (x)
 + 99608  (nines' complement of y)
 +     1
 =======
  147641
Dropping the leading "1" gives the correct answer: 47641.

==Binary example==

The method of complements is especially useful in binary (radix 2) since the ones' complement is very easily obtained by inverting each bit (changing '0' to '1' and vice versa). And adding 1 to get the two's complement can be done by simulating a carry into the least significant bit. For example:
   01100100  (x, equals decimal 100)
 - 00010110  (y, equals decimal 22)
becomes the sum:
   01100100  (x)
 + 11101001  (ones' complement of y)
 +        1  (to get the two's complement)
 ==========
  101001110
Dropping the initial "1" gives the answer: 01001110 (equals decimal 78)

==Negative number representations==

The method of complements normally assumes that the operands are positive and that y â‰¤ x, logical constraints given that adding and subtracting arbitrary integers is normally done by comparing signs, adding the two or subtracting the smaller from the larger, and giving the result the correct sign.
   185  (x)
 - 329  (y)
Complementing y and adding gives:
   185  (x)
 + 670  (nines' complement of y)
 +   1
 =====
   856
This is obviously the wrong answer; the expected answer is -144. But it isn't as far off as it seems; 856 happens to be the ten's complement of 144. This issue can be addressed in three ways:

==Practical uses==

The method of complements was used in many mechanical calculators as an alternative to running the gears backwards. For example:

===In computers===

Use of the method of complements is ubiquitous in digital computers, regardless of the representation used for signed numbers. However, the circuitry required depends on the representation:

===Manual uses===

The method of complements was used to correct errors when accounting books were written by hand. To remove an entry from a column of numbers, the accountant could add a new entry with the ten's complement of the number to subtract. A bar was added over the digits of this entry to denote its special status. It was then possible to add the whole column of figures to obtain the corrected result.
Complementing the sum is handy for cashiers making change for a purchase from currency in a single denomination of 1 raised to an integer power of the currency's base.  For decimal currencies that would be 10, 100, 1,000, etc., e.g. a $10.00 bill.

==In grade school education==

In grade schools, students are sometimes taught the method of complements as a shortcut useful in mental arithmetic.[tpl]cite book | title = Principles of Arithmetic and Geometry for Elementary School Teachers | author = Carl Barnett Allendoerfer | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1971 | url =  [/tpl]  Subtraction is done by adding the ten's complement of the subtrahend, which is the nines' complement plus 1.  The method is generally only applied when it is clear that the difference will be positive.  The same technique works for subtracting on an adding machine.
