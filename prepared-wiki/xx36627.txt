The first period, a two day strike, began at 18:00 hrs GMT, on Wednesday 13 November and ended at 18:00 on Friday 15 November. In the event that reconciliation could not be brokered, further industrial action was planned.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2446643.stm - Retrieved: May 29, 2007
The armed forces provided emergency cover during the strike, using vintage Green Goddess engines, and modern red fire appliances as part of Operation Fresco.  The armed forces also fielded small breathing apparatus rescue teams (BART) and rescue equipment support teams (REST) headed by professional firefighters of the RAF and staffed by specially trained members of all three services.http://www.operations.mod.uk/fresco/ - Retrieved: May 29, 2007
Each side placed the responsibility entirely with the other; the FBU said that their employers' failure to meet their demands was the cause of the strike. Many feared that lives would be lost in fires because of a lack of a prompt response by emergency services.  There were numerous examples of striking firefighters responding to emergency calls from the picket line and several rescues were made in this way.

==Negotiations==

The first few weeks of the planned action were postponed while negotiation took place. The FBU rejected an offer that would amount to 11 percent over two years from a review body headed by Sir George Bain, and were unwilling to accept reforms to their working conditions. The FBU was widely criticised for its initial demand for a 40 percent pay-rise for both firefighters and support workers; indeed, it refused to abandon this demand despite mounting public disquiet concerning the FBU's stance.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl]
On March 19, 2003, leaders of the FBU and negotiators for the local authority employers reached a provisional agreement based on a three year pay settlement and an understanding that modernisation measures would be subject to some measure of local negotiation.  To the surprise of many observers, this was voted down by local area FBU representatives the following day.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl]
On June 12, 2003, the dispute ended with the firefighters accepting a pay deal worth 16 percent over three years linked to changes to working conditions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl]
Tensions were raised again in 2004, when the FBU and local authority employers clashed over whether the deal brokered in 2003 was being honoured. However, this round of negotiations was settled without recourse to industrial action in August of that year.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3240811.stm - Retrieved: May 29, 2007
