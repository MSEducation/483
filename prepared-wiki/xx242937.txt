[[Linksys routers]]

CATEGORIES: Hardware routers

Linksys manufactures a series of network routers. Many models are shipped with Linux-based firmware and can run third-party firmware. The first model to support third-party firmware was the very popular Linksys WRT54G series.
The Linksys WRT160N/WRT310N series is the successor to the WRT54G series of routers from Linksys. The main difference is the draft 802.11n wireless NIC, providing a maximum speed of 270 Mbit/s over the wireless network when used with other 802.11n devices.

==Specifications and versions==

===WRT54G series===

The Linksys WRT54G and variants WRT54GS, WRT54GL, and WRTSL54GS are Wi-Fi capable residential gateways from Linksys. The device is capable of sharing Internet connections among several computers via 802.3 Ethernet and 802.11b/g wireless data links.
The WRT54GL is capable of running Linux-based third-party firmware for added features. Supported software includes Tomato, OpenWrt, and DD-WRT

===WRT310N===

Similar to WRT350N with a Gigabit Ethernet switch, hardware crypto acceleration for IPSec, SSL, and WPA/WPA2. The WRT310N has an integrated wireless chipset rather than the external PC Card adapter found on the WRT350N.http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1175239525280&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper&lid=2528039789B02 The Cisco Valet Plus M20 replaced this model.

===WRT320N===

802.11n "draft" MIMO router with gigabit switch and non-simultaneous dual-band. The E2000 replaced this model. Due to the hardware being very similar, it is possible to upgrade the WRT320N to an E2000 by replacing the CFE.Converting a WRT320N into E2000 - DD-WRT forum

===WRT330N===

Based on a different platform, but also has a Gigabit Ethernet switch according to the product specifications listed on the manufacturers website.http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&childpagename=US%2FLayout&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper&cid=1166859632665

===WRT350N===

Similar to WRT300N, but with a Gigabit Ethernet switch, hardware crypto acceleration for IPSec, SSL, and WPA/WPA2, and a USB 2.0 port for connecting hard drive or flash-based USB storage devices directly to your network to share music, video, or data files.

===WRT400N===

A simultaneous dual-band non-gigabit model.

===WRT600N===

A simultaneous dual-band gigabit model. It looks like WRT350N including USB 2.0 storage link except that the WRT600N is black.

===WRT610N===

A special system menu can be accessed by browsing to . 
″Vista Premium" (ability to turn off 6to4) and EGHN (Entertainment Grade Home Network = Linksys/Cisco UPnP QoS solution) can be configured in this page.

===WRT1900AC===

The WRT1900AC is a dual band router inspired by the original WRT54G iconic blue/black stackable form factor.[tpl]cite web|title=Linksys WRT revolutionizes wireless networking with next generation router|url=http://www.linksys.com/en-us/press/releases/2014-01-06_Linksys_wrt_revolutionizes_wireless_networking[/tpl]

This model also includes a USB port for storage, UPnP media streaming or a print server.
The E4200 also marks the first radical change in design of the Linksys series since Cisco launched the winged "spaceship" design first seen on the WRT400N. The E4200 features a minimalistic, streamlined design with only a white status LED visible on the top. All traffic activity LEDs and buttons have been relocated to the rear of the device.
A special system menu can be accessed by browsing to . This menu shows all kinds of system statistics  and settings. No settings can be changed from this menu. This is only found in the original version, and not available in the v2 model.
The E4200V2 has a Marvell 88W8366/88W8063 wireless chipset.
In previous Tomato builds (a popular 3rd-party firmware for Linksys routers), only the 2.4 GHz radio was properly supported. However, simultaneous dual-band radio can now be achieved using Tomato RAF, Tomato Shibby and Tomato Toastman's builds.
