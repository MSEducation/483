Chippenham is a market town situated in Wiltshire, England, which lies [tpl]convert|13|mi[/tpl] east of Bath and [tpl]convert|101|mi[/tpl] west of London.OS Explorer Map 156, Chippenham and Bradford-on-Avon Scale: 1:25 000.Publisher: Ordnance Survey A2 edition (2007). ISBN 978-0319239438 In the 27 March 2011 census, the town's population was recorded at 45,337,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.intelligencenetwork.org.uk/EasysiteWeb/getresource.axd?AssetID=55526&type=full&servicetype=Attachment | title=Chippenham Census 2011 Selected Statistics Profile | work=Wiltshire Census 2011 results | publisher=intelligencenetwork.org.uk | format=PDF[/tpl] superseding Salisbury as Wiltshire's second-largest town.
The town was established on a crossing of the River Avon and is believed to have existed as some form of settlement since before Roman times. It was a royal vill, and probably a royal hunting lodge,[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/?id=4GafAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22alfred%22chippenham+%22hunting+lodge%22&q=hunting+lodge | title=In Search of the Dark Ages | author=Michael Wood | publisher=BBC | year=1981 | page=111 | isbn=0-56-317835-3[/tpl] under Alfred the Great. The primary school, King's Lodge School, gets its name from this tradition.
The town continued to grow when the Great Western Railway arrived in 1841, and while historically a market town the economy has changed to that of a commuter town.
Chippenham is twinned with La Flèche in France and Friedberg in Germany.
The town's motto is Unity and Loyalty.

==Geography==

===Situation===

Chippenham is situated in western Wiltshire, set on a prominent crossing of the River Avon and lies between the Marlborough Downs to the east, the southern Cotswolds to the north and west and Salisbury Plain to the southeast.
The town is surrounded by sparse countryside and there are several woodlands in or in close proximity to the town, for example, Bird's Marsh, Vincients Wood and Briars Wood.

===Suburbs===

Suburbs include Cepen Park (North & South), Hardenhuish, Monkton Park, Lowden, Pewsham, Primrose Hill, Englands, Frogwell, Derriads, The Folly, Redlands, Queens Crescent, Lackham, Fenway Park, and Hill Rise, loosely corresponding to local government wards.

===Transport===

Chippenham lies 4 miles south of the M4 motorway, which links the town to Bristol, Swindon, South Wales and London. The A4 former coach road, A420 and B4069 provide further road links to Bath, Bristol and Oxford.
The town is bypassed to the west by the A350, which links the M4 motorway with Chippenham and nearby towns to the south, such as Melksham, Warminster and Trowbridge.
The A4 national route crosses the southern part of the town, and councillors have called for an eastern extension linking the A4 to the A350 north of Cepen Park although this has been opposed by many residents.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.gazetteandherald.co.uk/news/674792.readers_back_call_for_a_bypass | title=Readers back call for a bypass | newspaper=Gazette and Herald | date=19 January 2006 | author=Zoe Mills[/tpl]
Chippenham has a bus station with several routes and companies serving it. These Include Stagecoach with the route 55 to Swindon, First group with the 232 to Bath and 234 to Frome. Faresaver with the X31 to Bath and X34 to Trowbridge as well as several other local routes, Andybus with the 92 to Malmesbury. APLtravel with the 33 to Devizes.
Chippenham railway station is on the Great Western Main Line and is served by services between London Paddington and the West Country via Bristol Temple Meads or [tpl]stnlnk|Swindon[/tpl], and is famous for its railway arches and other buildings engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel as part of the Great Western Railway development. It is served by main line services and a smaller service to [tpl]Stnlnk|Southampton Central[/tpl] via Westbury and Salisbury. It is being electrified to make train times faster from London to the West Country. National Express Coach services connect at Chippenham to London, Wales, South West England, the Midlands and East Anglia. Bus services connect the town to Bath, Calne, Devizes, Trowbridge, Swindon and nearby villages.

===Landmarks===

The original Buttercross, a stone structure, was erected in c. 1570 and stood in the current location of Barclays Bank, where it served as the centre of the Shambles. The Buttercross was used for the sale of meat and dairy products.
In 1889, Mr E.C. Lowndes bought the Buttercross for £6 and re-erected it as a gazebo in the kitchen garden of the Castle Combe Manor House, where it subsequently fell into disrepair.
The Buttercross was re-erected in 1995 by the Chippenham Civic Society with funding provided by a wide range of local individuals and organisations.From the inscription on the Buttercross itself. It currently stands as the centre-piece of the pedestrianised area of the town centre, where a market is held each Friday and Saturday.
The Yelde Hall is one of very few remaining medieval timber framed buildings in the town. It was originally divided up internally for use as a market hall. Both the hall and its meeting room upstairs were used by the burgess and bailiff for a variety of meetings and trials as well as for Council meetings. The space under the Council Chamber was used as the town gaol.
After the Council and Burgess (now Mayor) moved to the Town Hall, on the High Street, in 1841, the hall had various uses:

===Bird's Marsh===

Bird's Marsh is a large woodland, approximately [tpl]convert|24|ha|acre[/tpl] in size, to the north of the town. It is home to many kinds of wildlife, and a popular place for walkers, due to its fairly large size and surrounding countryside. One entrance into Bird's Marsh can be found through a field close to the Morrisons supermarket, just south of the roundabout on the A350 Malmesbury Road. There are also access points off Hill Corner Road (via fields) and Jacksom's Lane.
Although not technically a marsh, the ground can be very boggy off the well-marked paths, a feature which has protected this area from housing development.
In 2008, developers made a planning enquiry about building 800 homes around the Bird's Marsh area.
In 2012, developers won the right to build on this area despite fierce opposition from resident groups.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.gazetteandherald.co.uk/news/4011618.Protesters_fight_to_save_Chippenham_beauty_spot | title=Protesters fight to save Chippenham beauty spot | newspaper=Gazette and Herald | date=1 January 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/wdp/home/wiltshire/Facebook-campaign-save-Birds-Marsh-Wood-development/article-583017-detail/article.html | title=Facebook campaign to save Birds Marsh Wood from development | newspaper=Bristol Post | date=2 January 2009[/tpl]

==Population and demographics==

Chippenham's population has grown rapidly in recent years to 28,065 (2001 census), an increase of 11% from the 1991 figure of 25,376.[tpl]cite web | url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getcensus.php?item=Chippenham | title=Chippenham Census Information | website=Wiltshire Council[/tpl] This rapid expansion can be attributed to the development of large housing estates (indeed, entirely new suburbs) such as the vast Cepen Park district to the west of the town, and the Pewsham development to the east (Pewsham is also the name of a small village just to the east of Chippenham). By 2007 the figure had reached 34,820.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/wiltshire_2026_chippenham_display_boards.pdf | title=What do we already know about Chippenham community area? | website=Wiltshire Council | format=PDF[/tpl] Further housing developments also progressed, though on a smaller scale. Council projections for 2009 estimated a population of 42,060,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/chippenham-community-childcare-plan.pdf | title=Childcare Sufficiency 2011–2014 Community Childcare Plan for Chippenham September 2011 | website=Wiltshire Council | format=PDF[/tpl] the actual figure was 43,880.[tpl]cite web | url=http://cms.wiltshire.gov.uk/documents/s4345/Health%20Issues%20in%20Our%20Area.pdf | title=Chippenham Community Area Joint Strategic Needs Assessment | website=Wiltshire Council | format=PDF[/tpl] Projections for 2012 estimated a population of 44,820, and would have made Chippenham the highest town population in Wiltshire, with the exception of Swindon (which is no longer within Wiltshire proper). The 2011 census revealed this figure to also have been exceeded, the census also predicts, using a trend-based projection, by 2026, a total mid-year population of 49,340.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.intelligencenetwork.org.uk/EasysiteWeb/getresource.axd?AssetID=49651&type=full&servicetype=Attachment | title=Chippenham  | work=Community Area Estimates and Projections 2001 to 2026: Trend-based | publisher=intelligencenetwork.org.uk | format=XLSX[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.intelligencenetwork.org.uk/EasysiteWeb/getresource.axd?AssetID=49645&type=full&servicetype=Attachment | title=Wiltshire Population 2011 report | work=Wiltshire and Community Area Population Estimates and Projections 2001 to 2026: Trend-based | publisher=intelligencenetwork.org.uk | format=PDF[/tpl]

==History==

There are believed to have been settlements in the Chippenham region since before Roman times. Remains of Romano-British settlements are visible in the wall behind the former magistrates court and recent redevelopments of the town have shown up other evidence of the earliest settlements.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chippenham.gov.uk/chippenham-timeline.2773.aspx | title=Chippenham Timeline | publisher=Chippenham Town Council | work=Museum & Heritage[/tpl]

===Toponymy===

The town proper was believed to have been founded by Anglo Saxons around 600. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records the town as Cippanhamme and this could refer to Cippa who had his Hamm, an enclosure in a river meadow. An alternative theory suggests that the name is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word Ceap, meaning market.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xfw6FGTvOVsC | title=Chippenham: Some Notes on Its History | author=Joseph Archibald Chamberlain | publisher=Charter Trustees | year=1976 | pages=199pp | isbn=0-95-054510-4 | id=BRN0066062[/tpl][tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=06FzOwAACAAJ | title=The history of Chippenham, A.D. 853-1946 | author=Arnold Platts | publisher=Wiltshire Gazette Printing Works | year=1946 | pages=98pp | id=BRN0141031[/tpl] The name is recorded variously as Cippanhamm (878), Cepen (1042), Cheppeham (1155), Chippenham (1227), Shippenham (1319) and Chippyngham (1541).[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6oLFYgEACAAJ | title=A Chippenham Collection | author=Sally Jefferies | publisher=Chippenham Civic Society | year=1987 | pages=107pp | id=BRN0541107[/tpl] On John Speed's map of Wiltshire (1611), the name is spelt both Chippenham (for the hundred) and Chipnam (for the town itself). (There is another Chippenham, Cambridgeshire and Cippenham, Berkshire near Slough).

===Early Medieval===

In AD 853, Ethelswitha (sister to Alfred the Great) married the King of Mercia in Chippenham. Alfred was then a boy of four and the wedding was held on the site of St. Andrew's church. According to Bishop Asser's Life of King Alfred Chippenham was, under Alfred's reign, a royal vill;[ref][tpl]cite journal | url=http://books.google.com/?id=0xcq_Ejp6pEC&pg=PA415&dq=%22alfred%22chippenham+%22hunting+lodge%22 | title=Antiquarian researches | journal=The Gentleman's Magazine | year=1855 | volume=198-199 | page=415[/tpl]
[/ref] historians have also argued, from its proximity to the royal forests at Melksham and Barden, that it was probably a hunting lodge. Alfred's daughter was also married in Chippenham.[ref][tpl]cite web | url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getcom2.php?id=54 | title=Chippenham | publisher=Wiltshire Council | work=Wiltshire Community History[/tpl]
[/ref]
Danish Vikings successfully besieged Chippenham in 878, though Alfred escaped. Later that year Alfred decisively defeated the Danes at the Battle of Ethandun, whose forces then surrendered to Alfred at Chippenham (ushering in the establishment of the Danelaw).
In 1042 the Royal holding in Chippenham makes mention of a church. The Domesday Book listed Chippenham as Cepen, with a population of 600 to 700 people in 1086.

===High and Late Medieval===

In Norman times the Royal properties were separated into the manors of Sheldon, Rowden and Lowden. Records show that the town expanded into Langstret (now the Causeway) from 1245 onwards and in 1406 onwards the town pushed into Le Newstret (now the New Road) area of town. Throughout this period Chippenham continued to have a thriving market in the town centre.
The A4 that runs through Chippenham incorporates parts of the 14th century medieval road network that linked London to Bristol. This was an important road for the English cloth trade and its upkeep was funded in part by cloth merchants from Bristol due to its importance to the trade.
Chippenham was represented in the Parliament of England from 1295 onwards and Queen Mary granted the town a Charter of Incorporation in 1554.
Analysis of the wood used to build the Yelde Hall indicates that the market hall was built after 1458. The Shambles and Buttercross were built after 1570. The Shambles were destroyed in a fire in 1856 and the Yelde Hall survived.
The parish of Chippenham Without encompasses the deserted medieval village of Sheldon, devastated by plague; all that remains today is Sheldon Manor, Wiltshire's oldest inhabited manor house, dating from 1282.

===16th to 18th centuries===

The wool industry took off in the 16th century due, in part, to the river. The plague hit the town hard in 1611 and 1636. This, a recession in the woollen industry, and a drop in corn production in 1622 and 1623, caused massive hardship for the town's population. The trade in cloth faced further problems during the English Civil War due to a Royalist proclamation that prohibited the sale of cloth to the Parliamentarian controlled London.
In 1747 a bribery and corruption scandal (involving two members of parliament for Chippenham) led to the downfall of Sir Robert Walpole's government.

===19th and 20th centuries===

A spur off the Wilts & Berks Canal was built to Chippenham in 1798 with a wharf at the current site of the bus station (Timber Street) with the main commodity traded being coal. Pewsham Way now follows the line of the old canal. The Great Western Railway arrived in Chippenham in 1841 which in turn attracted many new businesses to Chippenham. The arrival of these businesses required new housing which led to the expansion of Chippenham into the land north of the railway line, which in turn led to the growth of further industries to support the building work.
The arrival of the railway promoted the growth of industrial agricultural businesses. In the middle of the 19th century Chippenham was a major centre for the production of dairy and ham products; this led, later, to Nestle and Matteson's to have factories in the town centre. The railway also led to the growth of railway engineering works in Chippenham. The first of these was Roland Brotherhood in 1842.
A variety of companies then took over part or all of the business on the site until in 1935 Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company Ltd took over the business site fully. The signalling side of the business remains at the Chippenham site and is now owned by Siemens Rail Automation Group; the brakes business was taken over by the German company Knorr-Bremse,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.investegate.co.uk/article.aspx?id=200004251238495290J | title=Westinghouse Brakes sold to Knorr-Bremse[/tpl] and is based at a site in nearby Melksham.
On 17 April 1960, American singers Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent, and songwriter Sharon Sheeley were involved in a car crash in Chippenham at Rowden Hill. Cochran died as a result of his injuries and a memorial plaque was erected near the site. Each year Chippenham hosts an Eddie Cochran festival (see below).
On 13 February 1998, two unexploded bombs from World War II were discovered in the field behind Hardens Mead during preparations for the building of Abbeyfield School. About 1,100 residents living in the east of Chippenham had to be evacuated for two nights to friends and relatives or emergency accommodation until the Army carried out a controlled explosion. The Army initially attempted to defuse the larger [tpl]convert|750|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] device but it was decided that owing to the bomb's orientation in the ground it would be too dangerous.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/56543.stm | title=Army to detonate wartime bomb | website=BBC News UK | date=14 February 1998[/tpl]

==Governance==

The offices of North Wiltshire District Council were based in the town until 2009, when the council was merged with four other Wiltshire local authorities. The offices in Monkton Park were adopted by the replacement unitary Wiltshire Council, which is based in Trowbridge.
The office of Town Mayor was established in 1835, prior to which Chippenham was governed by a Bailiff supported by Burgesses. Currently elected annually by the Town Council, the Mayor is generally appointed to office in May of each year, at the "Mayor Making" ceremony. As part of their duties as the first citizen of a town, the Mayor visits organisations, charities and groups representing all parts of the local community, acting as a figurehead to promote goodwill, cultural exchange, trade and commerce. The Mayor also gives the name of a specific charity which they will support throughout their year of office. Other tasks throughout the year include presiding over Town council meetings and acting as President for a variety of local organisations, such as the Twinning Association, and Sea Cadets. In 2013, Councillor Sylvia Gibson became the 30th Mayor of Chippenham.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chippenham.gov.uk/mayor.2611.aspx | title=The new Mayor is: Councillor Sylvia Gibson | work=The Mayor’s Office | publisher=Chippenham Town Council[/tpl]
In 1812, Sir Robert Peel, the creator of the modern police force, served as MP for Chippenham.
Until 2010, the town of Chippenham was within the parliamentary constituency of North Wiltshire, traditionally a Tory stronghold, although in the 19th century some Liberal members elected. Boundary changes for the 2010 general election saw (Liberal Democrat) candidate, Duncan Hames, become the new Member of Parliament for Chippenham, a newly created constituency formed from parts of three neighbouring constituencies, while James Gray (Conservative) held the North Wiltshire constituency.

==Economy==

Historically a market town, Chippenham's economy has since changed to that of a commuter town with residents travelling to workplaces in Bath, Bristol, Swindon and even London (almost 100 miles to the east).
Several large businesses have been located in the region, with the biggest former employer being Westinghouse, now owned by Siemens, whose factory complex lies next to the railway station. The company undertakes railway signalling contracts for Network Rail, London Underground as well as railway operators is other parts of the world, e.g. Beijing Subway, Oslo Public Transport Administration, SMRT Corporation, Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, MTR Corporation and many others. Parts of the Westinghouse site are occupied by a range of companies. There are a number of other industrial sites around the town, Bumpers Farm being the largest.
In 2005, Europe's second largest logistics organisation, Wincanton PLC, consolidated its head office operations and moved to the newly developed Methuen Park office development in west Chippenham, where it employs around 350 people.

===Market===

Chippenham is a market town, with street markets taking place most Fridays and Saturdays around Market Place and along the pedestrianised High Street. A Farmers' Market for the sale of fresh, locally produced foodstuffs is also held here once a fortnight.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.localauthoritypublishing.co.uk/councils/chippenham/shopping.html | title=Town Markets | publisher=Local Authority Publishing | work=Chippenham Official Guide, Wiltshire[/tpl] The original Cattle Market, which closed in 2004, is now being redeveloped by Linden Homes Western Limited as one of the UK's largest eco-housing projects.

===Shopping===

Chippenham's major retail area surrounds the pedestrianised High Street and Market Place, which consists of numerous shops of various categories. Two shopping centres lie on either side of the High Street; the enclosed Emery Gate Shopping Centre and the open air Borough Parade Shopping Centre. Of all the shops in the High Street and nearby alleys there are very few independent stores as franchises dominate, however some independent stores (Jewellers, Nail Bars, Florists, Bridal Gowns, Hairdressers) are located along The Causeway and the Upper Market Place.
Retail parks, such as the Hathaway Retail Park, are located on the edge of town containing larger superstores and fast-food outlets.
The Chippenham Co-operative Society was founded in 1890. Over the years it played an increasing role in the local economy, becoming deeply involved in agriculture and dairy farming, and for most of the 20th century, its department store dominated the lower end of the High Street. However, by the 1960s the co-operative was facing increasing competition and found it necessary to join forces with other co-operatives, first locally, then nationally, forming The Co-operative Group. In the 80s, this flagship store was sold and became a Wilkinson store, but the Co-operative Group diversified into other areas, such as insurance and funeral services, they still operate through many local branches.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.co-operative.coop/find-us/?q=chippenham&lat=51.458058&long=-2.1160738999999467&filters=Food,Bank,Travel,Pharmacy,Funerals,Motor,Britannia,Misc,Nonfood,Post,Homestore,Petrol&options= | title=Find a Store | website=The Co-Operative Group Online[/tpl]

==Tourism==

Surrounding the town are a number of stone-built villages, including Lacock (National Trust), Biddestone, Bremhill and Castle Combe. The great house and art treasures of Longleat, Bowood House, Lacock Abbey, Sheldon Manor and Corsham Court are within easy reach.

===Twinned towns===

Chippenham is twinned with La Flèche in France[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.completefrance.com/language-culture/twin-towns | title=British towns twinned with French towns | work=Archant Community Media Ltd | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130705094933/http://www.completefrance.com/language-culture/twin-towns | archivedate=5 July 2013[/tpl]  Archived at Wayback Machine and Friedberg in Germany.
La Flèche lies on the banks of the Loir, [tpl]convert|42|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from Le Mans and [tpl]convert|72|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from Tours. Set amongst woods and farmland, La Flèche offers a wealth of recreational facilities including a zoological park. Le Prytane Militaire public school dates back to the time of the French King Henri IV and consequently La Flèche enjoys the status of a University Town. In 1630, people from La Flèche founded Montreal in Canada.
Friedberg is [tpl]convert|64|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from Munich and the Bavarian Alps. Herzog Ludwig the severe and his nephew Conradin founded the town in 1264. The magnificent Town Hall follows the architectural style of Elias Holl's Town Hall, built in 1674, in neighbouring Augsburg. Friedberg is a walled town, renowned for its many sporting and cultural events such as the 17th century Street Festival.

==Culture==

The Chippenham Folk Festival[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chippfolk.co.uk | title=Chippenham Folk Festival homepage[/tpl] takes place every year, usually over the Whitsuntide weekend.
The town holds an annual festival in remembrance of American rock and roll singer Eddie Cochran, who died on 17 April 1960 following a car accident shortly before midnight the previous day, while travelling through Chippenham on his way back to London during a British tour. Singer Gene Vincent and songwriter Sharon Sheeley survived the accident.
From 25 October 1963 until 1999, the Town Museum was housed in the Yelde Hall. It had, by this time, outgrown the site and moved to the former Magistrates' Court in the Market Place (opened on 23 March 2000).
The museum charts the history of the town from Neolithic times until today. By 2005, the museum had attracted over 90,000 visitors.

==Education==

===17th to 18th Century===

In his will of 1661 a Richard Scott directed that his house in Cooke's Street should be used as a school, and William Woodruffe gave an annuity of £5 in 1664 for the teaching of ten poor boys. In 1713 it was re-opened with a benefaction of £10 per annum for 24 boys.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pxSkPgAACAAJ | title=The History of Chippenham | author1=Rev. John Jeremiah Daniell | author2=Canon Jackson | publisher=R.F. Houlston | year=1894 | location=Paternoster Square, London[/tpl]

===Late 19th Century===

From 1875 a private venture grammar school existed in Chippenham, conducted in St. Mary Street by a Mr. Wilson and from 1883 by a Mr. Cruikshank.[tpl]cite web | url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getschool.php?id=333 | title=Wiltshire Community History | website=Wiltshire County Council[/tpl]
In 1891, the Technical Instruction Acts (1889 & 1891) provided financial assistance[tpl]cite web | url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/details?Uri=C5938635 | title=Chippenham District County School (S 8460): Sale of property - Order (Ref: ED 27/5268) | website=The National Archives[/tpl] for evening classes in various science and arts subjects. Earlier voluntary classes that had existed were now coordinated, and this became the beginning of a national system of technical education. Subjects included Shorthand, Animal Physiology, Chemistry, Physics, Hygiene, Carpentry and Dressmaking.
In 1893, Mr. Edward Newall Tuck was appointed by the Education Committee of the Borough of Chippenham to organise technical classes in Chippenham and district. Classes were held in rented premises at No. 21 London Road and at the Jubilee Institute, as well as villages including Grittleton and Yatton Keynell. Teachers from elementary schools attended classes in a School of Art on Saturdays at the Jubilee Institute. Mr. Tuck, in addition, gave talks on Wiltshire history and nature study, he also served as town councillor and was Mayor of Chippenham from 1931 to 1932. In 1894, pupils were not admitted to classes until they reached the age of 11. Pupils from day schools were admitted free from aged 11 to 16. The fees at this time were fixed at 6d per month, the whole expenses of the school being met by fees and grants from the Science and Art Department and the County Council. Higher grade classes for boys, including Woodwork and Chemistry, were held at No. 21 London Road.
In 1896, under the provisions of the Technical and Industrial Institutions Act (1892), the Borough of Chippenham established the Chippenham and District County School,[tpl]cite web | url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/details?Uri=C5938636 | title=Chippenham District County School (S 8460): Proposed appropriation of sum from… (Ref: ED 27/5269) | website=The National Archives[/tpl] subsequently known as the Chippenham County Secondary School for Boys and Girls, with Mr. Tuck as the first headmaster (He would remain in this post until 1939). The first Chair of Governors was former mayor Alderman John Coles.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.gazetteandherald.co.uk/news/9678518.Blue_plaque_to_salute_founder_of_John_Coles_Park/ | title=Salute to the man behind Chippenham's John Coles park | newspaper=Gazette and Herald | date=30 April 2012 | author=Staff reporter[/tpl]
The premises were still located at No. 21 London Road and the Jubilee Institute. As the tenancy of the private venture school was to end on 25 March 1896, the Town Council paid Mr. Cruikshank £10 for the desks, books and goodwill of his school. Boys were drawn from three elementary schools in Chippenham, the British, National and St. Paul's Schools. In addition twelve boys had previously attended the private grammar school. Others were from other private schools in Chippenham, Corsham, Devizes, Calne and surrounding villages. 39 boys aged 11 to 16 were on the admission register from 13 April 1896. The curriculum included Latin, French, Science, History, Geography, Grammar, Book-keeping, Shorthand, Arithmetic, Writing, Geometry and Freehand Drawing.
In September 1898, a girls' school was established, against some opposition, in the Temperance Hall, Foghamshire. 22 girls were admitted at opening, from the schools of Mrs. Parry (Market Place), Miss Alexander (Monkton Hill), Mrs. White (Marshfield Road), from private tuition and from local National and British schools.

===20th Century===

On 24 September 1900, the Chippenham District County School opened in Cocklebury Lane, now part of Wiltshire College (built on an acre of land purchased in 1896 by the County, Urban and Rural District Councils). The ceremony was attended by the Mayor and Aldermen of Chippenham. In addition to Mr. Edward Newall Tuck the headmaster, the staff included three masters and one mistress, there were 99 pupils. The total cost of the project was £6,000.[tpl]cite web | url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/details?Uri=C5938637 | title=Chippenham District County School (S 8460): Endowed Schools Scheme for administration of… (Ref: ED 27/5270) | website=The National Archives[/tpl] In addition to the buildings and playground, four acres of adjoining land were rented for playing fields. All day classes were consolidated here and pupil numbers increased rapidly.
On 1 May 1901 the decision was taken by the Governors for the school to become a Science School. 4 scholarships were granted to 3 female and 1 male students. In July it was decided to establish a centre for pupil-teachers at the school. In 1902, Local Education Authorities were established and Wiltshire County Council became responsible for education in Chippenham. Latin was omitted from the curriculum. By 1904 there were 101 pupils, 50 from urban and 51 from rural areas. In addition 49 pupil teachers were attending, 9 from urban and the remainder from rural schools, and the evening classes had 139 pupils. From 1905 girls from elementary schools attended Cookery classes at the Cocklebury Road site.
By October 1907 the school had 128 pupils, 64 boys and 64 girls. The age of admission was 9, and the leaving age 17 to 18. In addition to the yearly fees paid by pupils the school was financed by County and Government grants.[tpl]cite web | url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/details?Uri=C3593395 | title=Chippenham District County School (S.8460): Scheme 14th July, 1909 (Ref: ED 35/2686) | website=The National Archives[/tpl] In 1908 the fees were £5 5s. 0d. a year, including books. However, there were a number of scholarships available and figures for the year show that of 115 pupils, 66 girls and 49 boys, 57 held scholarships, one a free place, and only 57 were fee-payers.
In 1922, the school received further County and Government grants.[tpl]cite web | url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/details?Uri=C5942095 | title=Chippenham District County School (S 8460): Charitable Trusts Scheme 1922 (Ref: ED 27/8728) | website=The National Archives[/tpl] In the interwar years, numbers of pupils on roll increased steadily, and by 1929 there were 262. The Junior department was reorganised as a Kindergarten and Preparatory Form, catering for 61 children aged 8 to 10. However, the number of pupils over the age of 16 was proportionally small in comparison with the average for Wiltshire Grammar Schools, consequently there was no discrete sixth form, although a small number of pupils did progress to University, some with the aid of County Scholarships.
By the early 1930s the buildings were presenting difficulties of overcrowding and by 1935 pupil numbers had reached 288, Hardenhuish Park was purchased from the Clutterbuck family by Wiltshire County Council in order to implement the educational requirements of the growing town. In 1938, the Secondary Grammar School moved from Cocklebury Road to new buildings (since demolished), erected on the east side of Hardenhuish House.[tpl]cite web | url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/details?Uri=C3597145 | title=Chippenham Secondary School (formerly Chippenham District County School) (S.8460) (Ref: ED 35/6392) | website=The National Archives[/tpl] The old Manor House became the headmaster's room, the school library and some classrooms. The new school extended over 40 acres of Hardenhuish Park, new buildings contained a hall, gymnasium, laboratories, classrooms, and cloakrooms. In 1939, the Preparatory department closed.
By 1940 there were 414 pupils, of whom 25 were evacuees, 10 percent were under the age of 11 and, still, only 2 percent over 16. The Cocklebury Road premises became Chippenham County Secondary Modern School, a senior mixed school taking children aged 11 and over from the primary schools of Chippenham and district.
