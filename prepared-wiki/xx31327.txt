Sarnia is a city in Southwestern Ontario, Canada, and had a 2011 population of 72,366.Census Profile - Place name search results It is the largest city on Lake Huron and in Lambton County. Sarnia is located on the eastern bank of the junction between the Upper and Lower Great Lakes where Lake Huron flows into the St. Clair River, which forms the Canada-United States border, directly across from Port Huron, Michigan. The city's natural harbour first attracted the French explorer La Salle, who named the site "The Rapids" when he had horses and men pull his 45-tonne barque "Le Griffon" up the almost four-knot current[tpl]cite web |url=http://glakesonline.nos.noaa.gov/glcurrents/Composite_gl0301.html |title=Great Lakes Currents |publisher=NOAA/NOS/CO-OPS |accessdate=30 March 2012[/tpl] of the St. Clair River on 23 August 1679.[tpl]cite web|title=La Salle and the Griffon|url=http://www.maritimehistoryofthegreatlakes.ca/documents/hgl/default.asp?ID=c007|accessdate=23 August 2013[/tpl]

==Name==

The name "Sarnia" is Latin for Guernsey, which is a  British Channel Island.[tpl]cite book |title=Mare Clausum |author=John Selden |year=1635 |page=333[/tpl] In 1829 Sir John Colborne, a former governor of Guernsey, was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=4359 |title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online, Sir John Colborne |publisher=University of Toronto |year=2000 |accessdate=12 April 2012[/tpl] In this capacity, he visited two small settlements in 1835 that had been laid out on the shores of Lake Huron. One of these, named "The Rapids," consisted then of 44 taxpayers, nine frame houses, four log houses, two brick dwellings, two taverns and three stores.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.city.sarnia.on.ca/visit.asp?sectionid=117 |title=City of Sarnia-About Our Name |publisher=City of Sarnia |date=21 December 2005 |accessdate=12 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://virtualwalk.ca/index.php/Sarnia-Ontario/History-Geography.html |title=History-Geography of Sarnia |publisher=VirtualWalk.ca |accessdate=5 April 2012[/tpl] The villagers wished to change its name but were unable to agree on an alternative.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lambtonshield.com/voices-from-lambtons-past-part-3-of-old-home-week/ |title=Voices from Lambton's Past: Part 3 of 'Old Home Week' |date=2 September 2011 |accessdate=25 June 2013[/tpl] The English settlers favoured the name "Buenos Aires" and the Scottish "New Glasgow". Sir John Colborne suggested Port Sarnia. On 4 January 1836, the name was formally adopted by a vote of 26 to 16, and Colborne also named the nearby village Moore after British military hero Sir John Moore.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thetimesherald.com/article/20120226/OPINION02/202260318/Resolute-stoic-Jim-Acheson-perseveres?nclick_check=1 |title=Resolute and stoic, Jim Acheson perseveres |publisher=The Times-Herald Newspaper |date=26 February 2012 |accessdate=23 June 2013[/tpl] Sarnia adopted the nickname "The Imperial City" on 7 May 1914 because of the visit of Canada's Governor General, H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, and his daughter Princess Patricia.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.city.sarnia.on.ca/visit.asp?sectionid=117 |title=City of Sarnia |publisher=City of Sarnia |date=21 December 2005 |accessdate=23 April 2012[/tpl]

==History==

First Nations peoples have lived, hunted, and traveled across the area for at least 10,000 years, as shown by archaeological evidence on Walpole Island.[tpl]cite web |url=http://library.utoronto.ca/champlain/gdw_lytwyn6.htm |title=Waterworld: The Aquatic Territory Of The Great Lakes First Nations |publisher=The Champlain Society |author=Victor P. Lytwyn, Ph.D |accessdate=22 June 2013[/tpl]  These peoples were drawn from an amalgamation of Ojibwa, Ottawa, and Potowatami  clans, which formed  the Three Fires Confederacy, also called the Council of Three Fires, in A.D.796.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/~ojibwe/lessons/semester-one/introduction/ |title=Aaniipiish Aayaayang? (Where are we?) |publisher=University of Michigan |year=2011 |accessdate=22 June 2013[/tpl] These clans came together through common links in both language and culture, developing a self-sufficient society where tasks and responsibilities were equally shared among all members.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.visualheritage.ca/lambton/threefires.htm |title=Sarnia-Lambton-The Three Fires Confederacy |publisher=Ontario Visual Heritage Project |accessdate=1 April 2012[/tpl]
During the 1600s and 1700s, The Three Fires Confederacy controlled much of the area known as the hub of the Great Lakes, which included the Canadian shore where Sarnia is now located. During this time, it maintained relations with many of the First Nations, including Huron, Sioux, and Iroquois, as well as the countries of Great Britain and France. In fact, their trading partners, the Huron, welcomed La Salle and the Griffon in 1679 after he sailed into Lake Huron. The Ontario Heritage Trust erected a sign under the Bluewater Bridge in commemoration of the voyage, as shown by the photo of the sign.
Because of this beginning of the incursion of Europeans into the area, the members of the Confederacy helped shape the development of North America throughout the 18th Century, becoming a center of trade and culture.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lionsdistrict11a2.org/Mi_Hist/Files/Michigans%20Past.pdf |title=Introducing Michigan's Past-an Overview for Teachers |publisher=Michigan History Magazine |year=2001 |accessdate=1 April 2012[/tpl] Great Britain supported this strengthening of the tribes in the area as a set of allies against the French and the Iroqouis. The people of the Three Fires Confederacy, however, sided with the French during the Seven Years' War and only made peace with Great Britain after the Treaty of Fort Niagara in 1764.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbpindiantribe.com/historical-timeline.aspx |title=Historical Timeline |publisher=The Potowatami Nation |year=2009 |accessdate=22 June 2013[/tpl] It also fought on the side of the British during the War of 1812.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=T0TJL25k_ykC&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=%22Three+Fires%22%22+War+of+1812%22&source=bl&ots=3pbH-_HtfN&sig=No13ijRz-cZGnSPS1-hrMz9iqMI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=PPfFUffQPO6o4AOnuICIAg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22Three%20Fires%22%22%20War%20of%201812%22&f=false |title=When We Both Got to Heaven: James Atkey Among the Anishnabek at Colpoy's Bay |author=Mel Atkey |page=49 |year=2002 |accessdate=22 June 2013[/tpl] The Three Fires Confederacy also broke several treaties with the United States prior to 1815, but finally signed the Treaty of Springwells in September of that year and ceased all hostilities directed at the United States.[tpl]cite book |title=History of Ionia and Montclam Counties Michigan |author=John S.

After the War of 1812, the first Europeans in the area were French settlers loyal to the British Crown who moved north from Detroit.  They successfully traded with the Three Fires Confederacy, which contributed to the growth of the area.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.visualheritage.ca/lambton/french.htm |title=Sarnia-Lambton-The French |publisher=Ontario Visual Heritage Project |accessdate=1 April 2012[/tpl]  After its foundation, Port Sarnia expanded throughout the 19th Century; on 19 June 1856, the residents passed the Act to Incorporate the Town of Sarnia and the name Port Sarnia was officially changed to Sarnia effective 1 January 1857. The Act mentioned 1,000 inhabitants in three wards.[tpl]cite book |title=Statutes of the Province of Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |page=258[/tpl]  The wealth of adjoining stands of timber, the discovery of oil in nearby Oil Springs in 1858 by James Miller Williams, and the arrival of the Great Western Railway in 1858 and the Grand Trunk Railway in 1859 all stimulated Sarnia's growth.[tpl]cite web |url=http://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2013/05/07/sarnia-turns-99-today/ |title=Sarnia Turns 99 today |publisher=Blackburnnews.com |date=7 May 2013 |accessdate=23 June 2013[/tpl] The rail lines were later linked directly to the United States by the opening of the St. Clair Tunnel under the St. Clair River at Sarnia in 1890, by the Grand Trunk Railway, which was the first railroad tunnel ever constructed under a river.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.deepfoundations.ca/docs/tech/tech_StClairTunnel.pdf |title=Saint Clair River Tunnel, Sarnia.Evolution of the Design and Construction Methods for the TBM Cutterhead Retrieval |author=Peter McDonald, Brian Isherwood, and Nadir Ansari |accessdate=26 March 2012[/tpl]  The tunnel was an engineering marvel in its day, achieved through the development of original techniques for excavating in a compressed air environment.
Canada Steamship Lines formed in 1913 from many previous companies that plied the waters of the St. Clair River.

On 1 January 1991, Sarnia and the neighbouring town of Clearwater were amalgamated as the new city of Sarnia-Clearwater. The amalgamation was originally slated to include the village of Point Edward, although that village's residents resisted and were eventually permitted to remain independent of the city. On 1 January 1992, the city reverted to the name Sarnia.
Sarnia's population experienced a continual growth from 1961 to 1991, with a 1991 population of 74,376. In 2001 the population had declined by approximately 3,000. Since 2001 Sarnia's population has been growing slowly, with a 2011 population count of 72,366.http://www.city.sarnia.on.ca/pdf/Display_Board_Information_May_2011.pdf, City of SarniaStatistics Canada 2011 census  Despite these modest gains, an April 2010 report "Sarnia-Lambton's Labour Market" states:  "Large petrochemical companies are the community's main economic drivers. Over the recent past, several plants have shutdown, and of those still in operation, increased automation and outsourcing has led to significantly fewer workers.".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sltb.org/documents/SL_LabourMrkt_final.pdf |title=Sarnia-Lambton's Labour Market |publisher=Employment Ontario |date=April 2010 |accessdate=18 April 2012[/tpl]  These shutdowns and the resulting loss of jobs, and therefore population as workers search for employment elsewhere, will contribute to a general decline shown by one August 2011 study, which shows that the population will decline by 17% over the next twenty-five years.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.city.sarnia.on.ca/pdf/IntensificationCentresCorridorsStudyFINAL.pdf |title=Intensification in Centres and Corridors Study |publisher=Monteith and Brown, Planning Consultants |date=August 2011 |accessdate=4 April 2012[/tpl]  The Monteith-Brown study cited outlines a plan for restructuring the city based on hybrid zoning areas, which will bring work opportunities closer to the neighborhoods where people live.

==Geography==

Sarnia is located on the eastern shore of Lake Huron at its extreme southern point where it flows into the St. Clair River. Most of the surrounding area is flat, and the elevation ranges from [tpl]convert|169|m|ft[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|281|m|ft[/tpl] above sea level.[tpl]cite web|title=Atlas of Lambton County|url=http://www.lambtongis.ca/pdfmaps/Coloured_Shaded_Relief.pdf|publisher=Lambton County|accessdate=20 July 2013[/tpl] The soil mostly comprises clay.[tpl]cite web|title=Soil Survey of Lambton County|url=http://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/publications/surveys/on/on22/on22_report.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Agriculture and Food|accessdate=10 September 2013|pages=11, Table 2[/tpl]  Despite this high percentage of clay, the soil is remarkably rich for cultivation. Prior to the Ice Age, glaciers covered most of the area, as can be seen not only by the existence of the Great Lakes themselves but also of alluvial sand deposits, terminal moraines, and rich oil reserves, the entire area was submerged and plant and animal matter formed many layers of sediment as they settled after the waters receded.[tpl]cite web|title=Atlas of Lambton County|url=http://www.lambtongis.ca/pdfmaps/Surficial_Geology.pdf|publisher=Lambton County|accessdate=20 July 2013[/tpl]  Sarnia is not part of the Canadian Shield and is located just beyond its southernmost reaches, [tpl]convert|290|km|mi|0|[/tpl] West of Toronto and [tpl]convert|106|km|mi|0|[/tpl] North of Detroit.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.liveinlambton.ca/newcomers/AboutLambton/Sarnia-Lambton/locationsarnia/Pages/default.aspx |title=Location and Geography of Sarnia-Lambton |publisher=Ontario Ministry of Citizenship |author=Live In Lambton |accessdate=7 April 2012[/tpl]

===Neighbourhoods===

Wiltshire Park, Woodland, Oak Acres, Wees Beach, Oakwood Corners, Woodrow Shores, and Blackwell, are part of the North End of Sarnia, which begins immediately north of Ontario Highway 402 and terminates at the shore of Lake Huron.  Coronation Park, Heritage Park, College Park, The Tree Streets, and Sherwood Village are some of the neighbourhoods south of the highway.

The village of Blue Water was built to house workers and their families in Chemical Valley during the construction of Polymer Corporation and at one point had nearly 3,000 residents. In 1961, all the residents were relocated, mostly to the North End, to make way for expansion of the chemical industry. The village was demolished, and all that remains now is an historical marker at the corner of Vidal Street and Huron Avenue. This neighbourhood was largely forgotten until historian Lorraine Williams penned two books about it and was instrumental in the dedication of the plaque.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.intelligencer.ca/PrintArticle.aspx?e=715197|author=Dan McCaffery|title=Gone but not forgotten|publisher=Belleville Intelligencer|year=2008|accessdate=5 May 2012[/tpl]

===Climate===

Sarnia has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb),[tpl]cite web|title=Koeppen-Geiger Climate Classification|url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/present.htm|publisher=Koeppen-Geiger|accessdate=7 July 2013[/tpl] which is mild by Canadian standards. Winters are cold with a few short-lasting Arctic air masses that dip far enough south and bring with them daily high temperatures lower than [tpl]Convert|−10|C|0[/tpl].  Sarnia is located in a snowbelt and sometimes receives large quantities of lake-effect snow. Snowbelts, like the one that stretches from the south of Sarnia through London to Woodstock, are created by lake effects—largely defined by water and wind.[tpl]cite web |title=Lake effect fuels winter storm |url=http://www2.canada.com/windsorstar/news/story.html?id=94adf5b7-7ad9-4109-81d0-10a3f164d451|publisher=Windsor Star|accessdate=10 September 2013[/tpl] Sarnia averages 112.0 cm of snow per year, while London averages 194.3.
The lake creates a seasonal lag, and compared to the rest of Canada and inland Ontario, Sarnia has a noticeably longer warm period following summer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sarnia.ca/visit.asp?sectionid=432 |title=Sarnia Climate and Location |publisher=City of Sarnia |date=22 June 2011 |accessdate=17 April 2012[/tpl] However, cooler temperatures tend to prevail for longer after winter. Lake Huron can also create large temperature differences within the city in spring and early summer, particularly on hot days in late May, early June. Finally, extreme temperatures, particularly lows, are rarely ever seen.
