[[Exterior derivative]]

CATEGORIES: Differential forms, Differential operators, Generalizations of the derivative

On a differentiable manifold, the exterior derivative extends the concept of the differential of a function to differential forms of higher degree. The exterior derivative was first described in its current form by Élie Cartan; it allows for a natural, metric-independent generalization of Stokes' theorem, Gauss's theorem, and Green's theorem from vector calculus.
If a k-form is thought of as measuring the flux through an infinitesimal k-parallelepiped, then its exterior derivative can be thought of as measuring the net flux through the boundary of a (k+1)-parallelepiped.

==Definition==

The exterior derivative of a differential form of degree k is a differential form of degree [tpl]nowrap|1=k + 1.[/tpl]
If f is a smooth function (a 0-form), then the exterior derivative of f is the differential of f. That is, df is the unique 1-form such that for every smooth vector field X, [tpl]nowrap|df(X) [tpl]=[/tpl] dXf[/tpl], where dXf is the directional derivative of f in the direction of X.
There are a variety of equivalent definitions of the exterior derivative of a general k-form.

===Axioms for the exterior derivative===

The exterior derivative is defined to be the unique R-linear mapping from k-forms to (k+1)-forms satisfying the following properties:
The second defining property holds in more generality: in fact, [tpl]nowrap|1=d(dα) = 0[/tpl] for any k-form α; more succinctly, [tpl]nowrap|1=d2 = 0[/tpl].  The third defining property implies as a special case that if f is a function and α a k-form, then [tpl]nowrap|1=d(fα) = d(f∧α) = df∧α + f∧dα[/tpl] because functions are 0-forms, and scalar multiplication and the exterior product are equivalent when one of the arguments is a scalar.

===Exterior derivative in local coordinates===

Alternatively, one can work entirely in a local coordinate system (x1, ..., xn). First, the coordinate differentials dx1, ..., dxn form a basic set of one-forms within the coordinate chart. The formulas in this section rely on the Einstein summation convention. Given a multi-index [tpl]nowrap|I [tpl]=[/tpl] (i1, ..., ik)[/tpl] with [tpl]nowrap|1 ≤ ip ≤ n[/tpl] for [tpl]nowrap|1 ≤ p ≤ k[/tpl], the exterior derivative of a k-form 
over Rn is defined as
The definition of the exterior derivative in local coordinates follows from the preceding definition. Indeed, if [tpl]nowrap|ω [tpl]=[/tpl] fI dxi1∧···∧dxik[/tpl], then
Here, we have interpreted fI as a 0-form, and then applied the properties of the exterior derivative.

===Invariant formula===

Alternatively, an explicit formula can be given for the exterior derivative of a k-form ω, when paired with [tpl]nowrap|k + 1[/tpl] arbitrary smooth vector fields V0,V1, ..., Vk'':
In particular, for 1-forms we have: [tpl]nowrap|1=dω(X,Y) = Xω(Y) − Yω(X) − ω(X,Y)[/tpl], where X and Y are vector fields.

==Stokes' Theorem on manifolds==

If M is a compact smooth orientable n-dimensional manifold with boundary, and ω is an (n−1)-form on M, then the generalized form of Stokes' Theorem states that:
Intuitively, if one thinks of M as being divided into infinitesimal regions, and one adds the flux through the boundaries of all the regions, the interior boundaries all cancel out, leaving the total flux through the boundary of M.

==Examples==

===1===

Consider [tpl]nowrap|1=σ = u dx1∧dx2[/tpl] over a 1-form basis [tpl]nowrap|1=dx1,...,dxn[/tpl].
The exterior derivative is:
The last formula follows easily from the properties of the wedge product.  Namely, [tpl]nowrap|1=dxi ∧ dxi = 0[/tpl].

===2===

For a 1-form [tpl]nowrap|1=σ = u dx + v dy[/tpl] defined over R2. We have, by applying the above formula to each term (consider [tpl]nowrap|1=x1 = x[/tpl] and [tpl]nowrap|1=x2 = y[/tpl]) the following sum,

==Further properties==

===Closed and exact forms===

A k-form ω is called closed if dω is 0; closed forms are the kernel of d. ω is called exact if ω = dα for some (k−1)-form α; exact forms are the image of d. Because [tpl]nowrap|1=d2 = 0[/tpl], every exact form is closed. The Poincaré lemma states that in a contractible region, the converse is true.

===de Rham cohomology===

Because the exterior derivative d has the property that [tpl]nowrap|1=d2 = 0[/tpl], it can be used as the differential (coboundary) to define de Rham cohomology on a manifold.  The kth de Rham cohomology (group) is the vector space of closed k-forms modulo the exact k-forms; as noted in the previous section, the Poincaré lemma states that these vector spaces are trivial for a contractible region, for k > 0.  Integration of forms gives a natural homomorphism from the de Rham cohomology to the singular cohomology over the real numbers R of a smooth manifold. The theorem of de Rham shows that this map is actually an isomorphism, a far-reaching generalization of the Poincaré lemma. As suggested by the generalized Stokes' theorem, the exterior derivative is the "dual" of the boundary map on singular simplices.

===Naturality===

The exterior derivative is natural in the technical sense: if [tpl]nowrap|1=f: M → N[/tpl] is a smooth map and Ωk is the contravariant smooth functor that assigns to each manifold the space of k-forms on the manifold, then the following diagram commutes
so [tpl]nowrap|1=d(f*ω) = f*dω,[/tpl] where f* denotes the pullback of f. This follows from that f*ω(·), by definition, is ω(f*(·)), f* being the pushforward of f. Thus d is a natural transformation from Ωk to Ωk+1.

==Exterior derivative in vector calculus==

Most vector calculus operators are special cases of, or have close relationships to, the notion of exterior differentiation.

===Gradient===

A smooth function f: Rn → R is a 0-form. The exterior derivative of this 0-form is the 1-form
That is, the form df acts on any vector field V by outputting, at each point, the scalar product of V with the gradient ∇f of f.
The 1-form df is a section of the cotangent bundle, that gives a local linear approximation to f in the cotangent space at each point.

===Divergence===

A vector field V = (v1, v2, ... vn) on Rn has a corresponding (n−1)-form
(For instance, when n = 3, in three-dimensional space, the 2-form ωV is locally the scalar triple product with V.)  The integral of ωV over a hypersurface is the flux of V over that hypersurface.  
The exterior derivative of this (n−1)-form is the n-form

===Curl===

A vector field V on Rn also has a corresponding 1-form
Locally, ηV is the dot product with V. The integral of ηV along a path is the work done against −V along that path. 
When n = 3, in three-dimensional space, the exterior derivative of the 1-form ηV is the 2-form

===Invariant formulations of grad, curl, div, and Laplacian===

On any Riemannian manifold, the standard vector calculus operators can be written in coordinate-free notation as follows:
