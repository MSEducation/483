The Dakota was designated a New York City Landmark in 1969.Birmingham, Stephen. (1996). Life at the Dakota: New York's Most Unusual Address, pp. 130-131.  The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1976.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/72000869.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory: Dakota Apartments|author=Carolyn Pitts|format=PDF|date=August 10, 1976|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=June 21, 2009|postscript=[/tpl] and [tpl]PDFlink|Accompanying photos, exterior, undated|1.65 MB[/tpl] 

==Features==

The Dakota is square, built around a central courtyard. The arched main entrance is a porte cochère large enough for the horse-drawn carriages that once entered and allowed passengers to disembark sheltered from the weather. Many of these carriages were housed in a multi-story stable building built in two sections, 1891–94, at the southwest corner of 77th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, where elevators lifted them to the upper floors. The "Dakota Stables" building was in operation as a garage until February 2007, when it was slated to be transformed by the Related Companies into a condominium residence.Christopher Gray: "Streetscapes: The Dakota Stables; A 'Soft-Site' Garage on the Booming West Side", The New York Times, May 24, 1987 accessed December 7, 2010. Since then, the large condominium building The Harrison occupies its spot.
The general layout of the apartments is in the French style of the period, with all major rooms not only connected to each other, in enfilade, in the traditional way, but also accessible from a hall or corridor, an arrangement that allows a natural migration for guests from one room to another, especially on festive occasions, yet gives service staff discreet separate circulation patterns that offer service access to the main rooms. The principal rooms, such as parlors or the master bedroom, face the street, while the dining room, kitchen, and other auxiliary rooms are oriented toward the courtyard. Apartments thus are aired from two sides, which was a relative novelty in Manhattan at the time.[tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl] Some of the drawing rooms are [tpl]convert|49|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] long, and many of the ceilings are [tpl]convert|14|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] high; the floors are inlaid with mahogany, oak, and cherry.[tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl]
Originally, the Dakota had 65 apartments with four to 20 rooms, no two being alike.[tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl] These apartments are accessed by staircases and elevators placed in the four corners of the courtyard. Separate service stairs and elevators serving the kitchens are located in mid-block. Built to cater for the well-to-do, the Dakota featured many amenities and a modern infrastructure that was exceptional for the time. The building has a large dining hall; meals also could be sent up to the apartments by dumbwaiters. Electricity was generated by an in-house power plant and the building has central heating. Beside servant quarters, there was a playroom and a gymnasium under the roof. In later years, these spaces on the tenth floor were converted into apartments for economic reasons. The Dakota property also contained a garden, private croquet lawns, and a tennis court behind the building between 72nd and 73rd Streets.
All apartments were let before the building opened,[tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl] but it was a long-term drain on the fortune of Clark, who died before it was completed, and his heirs. For the high society of Manhattan, it became fashionable to live in the building, or at least to rent an apartment there as a secondary city residence, and the Dakota's success prompted the construction of many other luxury apartment buildings in Manhattan.[tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl]
An entrance to the 72nd Street station ([tpl]NYCS trains|Eighth center local[/tpl]) is outside the building.

==Death of John Lennon==

The Dakota was the home of former Beatle John Lennon from 1973 until his murder. On the night of December 8, 1980, Mark David Chapman shot Lennon in the Dakota's 72nd Street entryway as the singer was returning home from a recording session. Lennon was pronounced dead upon arrival at nearby Roosevelt Hospital. As of 2010, Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, still has several apartments in the building. The Strawberry Fields memorial was laid out in memory of Lennon in Central Park directly across Central Park West.

Although historically home to many creative or artistic people, the building and its co-op board of directors were criticized in 2005 by former resident Albert Maysles.  He attempted to sell his ownership to actors Melanie Griffith and Antonio Banderas, but they were rejected.  Maysles expressed his "disappointment with the way the building seems to be changing" by telling The New York Times: "What's so shocking is that the building is losing its touch with interesting people.  More and more, they're moving away from creative people and going toward people who just have the money."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/realestate/19deal.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=New Co-op for Soup Executive | first=William | last=Neuman | date=June 19, 2005 | accessdate=May 25, 2010[/tpl]  Even prior to this, Gene Simmons,Tony Schwartz.
