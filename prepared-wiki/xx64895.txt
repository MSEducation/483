Donald Lamont Jack (6 December 1924 – 2 June 2003) was a Canadian novelist and playwright. 
He was born in Radcliffe, Bury, England and grew up in Britain, attending the well regarded Bury Grammar School and Marr College and later serving in the RAF in World War II (1943–47).
After the war he emigrated to Canada in 1951, and became a Canadian citizen in 1964. From 1955-57 he was a scriptwriter for Crawley Films. After 1957 he became a full-time freelance writer.
He wrote for the stage, radio, and for television programs such as General Motors Theatre, The Unforeseen, Playdate, Hatch's Mill, The Forest Rangers, and On Camera, but he is most famous for his novels, the Bandy Papers, which recount the humorous adventures of Bartholomew Bandy, a World War I fighter pilot. His play The Canvas Barricade was the first Canadian play produced at the Stratford Festival of Canada. Other stage plays included Exit Muttering, Crash, and Minuet for Brass Band. He had 39 TV plays produced, 22 radio plays, and numerous documentaries. Most of Jack's book-length works are being re-published, or published for the first time, by Sybertooth.
Jack died of a stroke.
