Bryan is also a radio news presenter for The Radio Network. He began with the IRN News Centre as breakfast newsreader, and then became part of the Newstalk ZB News team when IRN combined with the Newstalk ZB Newsroom. He was part of the Affiliates unit, which is based in the Auckland newsroom of Newstalk ZB, and produces bulletins for many commercial stations around the country, including other stations of The Radio Network. He remained a breakfast newsreader for the Affiliates unit until mid-2009, when his position was combined with another role, and he was made redundant. However, he remains working on contract and is a regular fill-in newsreader on both the Newstalk ZB Network, and the Affiliates bulletins.
He is married with four young adult children and lives in Auckland, and is also a sought after and entertaining speaker.
