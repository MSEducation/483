==Reception==

A Place in the Sun received mixed reviews. Allmusic's Leslie Matthew gave it two stars out of five, and describes it as "an album that is sonically more focused, but it also unfortunately makes the band sound like replicas of a dozen of their post-grunge contemporaries: neither Better Than Ezra or Less Than Jake."
