John Milton Hay (October 8, 1838 – July 1, 1905) was an American statesman, diplomat, author, journalist, and private secretary and assistant to Abraham Lincoln.  Hay's highest office was serving as United States Secretary of State under Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.

==Early life==

Hay was born in Salem, Indiana,[tpl]cite web|url=http://johnhaycenter.org/index.asp?mod=2 |title=Birthplace of John Milton Hay |publisher=The John Hay Center |date=July 1, 1905 |accessdate=September 28, 2012[/tpl] of Scottish ancestry, the third son of Dr. Charles Hay and Helen Leonard from Middleborough, Massachusetts, who had come to Salem to live with her sister. He was raised in Warsaw, Illinois, and educated first at the private school of the Reverend Stephen Childs, an Episcopal clergyman. In 1851 John went to an academy at Pittsfield in Pike County, where he met an older student, John G. Nicolay, with whom he would later work as private secretary to Abraham Lincoln. In 1852 John Hay went to the college at Springfield, (later known as Carthage College) and in 1855 was sent to Brown University, where he joined Theta Delta Chi and Phi Beta Kappa. At Brown, he developed an interest in poetry, and Hay became a part of Providence's literary circle which included Sarah Helen Whitman and Nora Perry. As a salutation to each issue of Benjamin Tucker's Liberty, these lines of poetry by Hay were printed: For always in thine eyes, O Liberty!/ Shines that high light whereby the world is saved;/ And though thou slay us, we will trust in thee.
When he graduated, he was named Class Poet. He graduated in 1858 with a master of arts degree and went home to Warsaw to study law with his uncle, Milton Hay."Hay, John" Encyclopedia BrunonianaWilliam Roscoe Thayer, John Hay: In Two Volumes, Volume 1, 1915, page 49J.

===Lincoln's secretary===

Abraham Lincoln's law office was next door to the law office of Milton Hay, John's uncle, and Lincoln thus became acquainted with John Hay. When Lincoln won election as president, his secretary, John G. Nicolay, recommended John Hay to Lincoln as assistant private secretary.  Though technically a clerk in the Interior Department, he served as Lincoln's secretary until 1864. He lived in the northeast corner bedroom on the second floor of the White House, which he shared with his fellow secretary and Pittsfield Academy schoolmate, Nicolay.
For a few months, he served in the Union Army under Generals David Hunter and Quincy Adams Gillmore. He rose to the rank of major and was later brevetted lieutenant colonel and colonel. Hay's diary and writings during the Civil War are basic historical sources. Some have credited Hay with being the real author of Lincoln's Letter to Mrs. Bixby, consoling her for the loss of her sons in the war.American Heritage magazine
Hay was present when Lincoln died after being shot at Ford's Theatre. Hay and Nicolay wrote a formal 10-volume biography of Lincoln (Abraham Lincoln: A History, 1890) and prepared an edition of his collected works.
Portions of Hay's diaries and letters from 1861–1870, published in the book Lincoln and the Civil War, show Lincoln in a far more intimate light.

===Legal career===

In 1861, he was admitted to practice in the Supreme Court of Illinois.

===Diplomatic career===

Between 1865 and 1870, he was secretary of legation at Paris (1865–7) and Madrid (1867–8), and chargé d'affaires at Vienna (1868–70). In 1878 he became assistant secretary of state in the Hayes administration. Hay was named U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1897 when William McKinley became President. Some of the recognition of the longstanding community of interests between the United Kingdom and the United States was the  result of Hay's diplomatic tenure.[tpl]cite book |title= The Life and Letters of John Hay, Vol. II |last= Thayer |first= William Roscoe |authorlink= William Roscoe Thayer |year= 1915 |publisher= Houghton Mifflin Co. |location= Boston and New York |asin= B00117061E |chapter= chapter XXIII |pages= 448 pp[/tpl]

===Journalism career===

In 1870 he left government and worked for 6 years as an editor for the New York Tribune under Whitelaw Reid.[tpl]cite book|title=Famous American Statesmen & Orators|editor=Alexander K. McClure|publisher=F. F. Lovell Publishing Company|location=New York|year=1902|volume=VI|page=193[/tpl]

===Secretary of State===

In August 1898, Hay was named by President McKinley as Secretary of State and helped negotiate the Treaty of Paris of 1898, which ended the Spanish–American War. He was involved in the Perdicaris incident.
Hay continued serving as Secretary of State after Theodore Roosevelt succeeded McKinley, serving until his own death in 1905. He established the Open Door Policy in China.

==Legacy==

His contributions included the adoption of an Open Door Policy in China (announced on January 2, 1900) and the preparations for the Panama Canal. He negotiated the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty (1901), the Hay–Herrán Treaty (1903), and the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty (1903), all of which were instrumental in clearing the way for the construction and use of the Canal. In all, he brought about more than 50 treaties, including the settlement of the Samoan dispute, as a result of which the United States secured Tutuila, with a harbor in the Pacific;  a definitive Alaskan boundary treaty in 1903; the negotiation of reciprocity treaties with Argentina, France, Germany, Cuba, and the British West Indies; the negotiation of new treaties with Spain; and the negotiation of a treaty with Denmark for the cession of the Danish West India Islands.New International Encyclopedia.
In 1904, Hay was one of the first seven chosen for membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters.
Hay is also known for his comment, written in a letter to President Theodore Roosevelt, describing the Spanish–American War as a "splendid little war".
Hay appears as a prominent character in Gore Vidal's historical novels Lincoln and Empire and in William Safire's historical novel Freedom. He appears, portrayed by John Huston, in the 1975 film The Wind and the Lion, a fictionalization of the Perdicaris Affair in Morocco in 1904.  Steven Culp portrayed John ("Johnny") Hay in the 1988 miniseries Lincoln, based on Vidal's book.  He is portrayed in the 1997 miniseries Rough Riders by actor and retired United States Marine R. Lee Ermey. In the 2012 motion picture Lincoln he is played by actor Joseph Cross and is seemingly still Lincoln's assistant secretary despite the events of the film taking place entirely in 1865 (Hay held the position until 1864), although his position is never overtly stated.
After Roosevelt signed an executive order setting aside land in the Benguet region of the Philippines for a military reservation under the United States Army, Camp John Hay of Baguio City was established on October 25, 1903 and named in his honor. It was re-designated John Hay Air Base in 1955. The base was used for rest and recreation for U.S. military personnel and the dependants of U.S. military personnel in the Philippines as well as Department of Defense employees and their dependents. The 690-hectare property was finally turned over to the Philippines in 1991 upon the expiration of the Philippine-U.S. Bases Agreement. Since 1997 it has been in the hands of a private developer, on a long-term lease, which has transformed the property into a world class resort.
The mountain resort still carries John Hay's name to this day.
Hay was a close friend of Henry Brooks Adams, American historian and author. In 1884, architect Henry Hobson Richardson designed adjoining townhouses for Hay and Adams on Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C. The houses were demolished in 1927 and the site is now occupied by the Hay–Adams Hotel.
Brown University's John Hay Library housed the entire library collection from its construction in 1910 until the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Library was built in 1964. In 1971, when physical science materials were transferred to the new Sciences Library, the John Hay Library became exclusively a repository for the library's Special Collections.
Hay's New Hampshire estate has been conserved as part of the John Hay National Wildlife Refuge, the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests' John Hay Land Studies Center, and The Garden Conservancy's Fells Reservation.  The Fells, a local nonprofit organization that has maintained and managed the John Hay Estate on Lake Sunapee for over a decade, acquired the northern half of the property from the US Fish and Wildlife Service on March 25, 2008.
Hay and Abraham Lincoln are depicted in a larger-than-life bronze sculpture by Mark Martino, entitled A Learning Moment, in the Sesquicentennial Plaza at Carthage College.  Hay was an alumnus of the Illinois State University in Springfield (previously Hillsboro College), which later became Carthage College when it moved to Carthage, Illinois in 1870.
Hay was a correspondent member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters from 1900 until his death.
He received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from: Case Western Reserve University (1894); Brown University (1897); Princeton University (1901); Dartmouth College (1901); Yale University (1901); and Harvard University (1902).[tpl]Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular|day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 September 1901 |page_number 7 |issue=36570| [/tpl][tpl]Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=United States|day_of_week=Thursday |date=24 October 1901 |page_number=3 |issue=36594| [/tpl]Lorenzo Sears, John Hay, Author and Statesman, 1915, page 22
