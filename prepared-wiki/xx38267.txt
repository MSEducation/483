Tefillin (Askhenazic: [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|t|f|ɪ|l|ɨ|n[/tpl]; Israeli Hebrew: [tpl]IPA-he|tfiˈlin|[/tpl], [tpl]lang|tmr|תפילין[/tpl]) also called phylacteries ([tpl]IPAc-en|f|ɪ|ˈ|l|æ|k|t|ər|iː|z[/tpl] from Ancient Greek phylacterion, form of phylássein, φυλάσσειν meaning "to guard, protect") are a set of small black leather boxes containing scrolls of parchment inscribed with verses from the Torah, which are worn by observant Jews during weekday morning prayers. Although "tefillin" is technically the plural form (the singular being "tefillah"), it is loosely used as a singular as well. The hand-tefillin, or shel yad, is placed on the upper arm, and the strap wrapped around the arm, hand and fingers; while the head-tefillin, or shel rosh, is placed above the forehead. The Torah commands that they should be worn to serve as a "sign" and "remembrance" that God brought the children of Israel out of Egypt.
The scriptural texts for tefillin are obscure in literal meaning. For example, the verse in Deut. 11:18 does not designate what specifically to "bind upon your arm," and the definition of totafot is not obvious. It is the Talmud, the authoritative oral tradition for Rabbinic Judaism, which explains what are to be bound to the body and the form of tefillin.

==Biblical source==

The obligation of tefillin, as expounded by the Oral Law, is mentioned four times in the Torah: twice when recalling the The Exodus from Egypt:
[tpl]quote|And it shall be for a sign for you upon your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that the law of the [tpl]LORD[/tpl] may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand did the [tpl]LORD[/tpl] bring you out of Egypt.|Exodus 13:9[/tpl]
[tpl]quote|And it shall be for a sign upon your hand, and as totafot between your eyes; for with a mighty hand did the [tpl]LORD[/tpl] bring us forth out of Egypt.|Exodus 13:16[/tpl]
and twice in the shema passages:

==Etymology==

The ultimate origin of Hebrew "tefillin" is uncertain.[tpl]cite book|author=Sol Steinmetz|title=Dictionary of Jewish usage: a guide to the use of Jewish terms|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Nk_RFL9LYg0C&pg=PA165|accessdate=30 June 2011|date=August 2005|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-4387-4|page=165[/tpl] The word "tefillin" is not found in the Bible, which calls them ṭoṭafot. The Septuagint renders "ṭoṭafot" ἀσαλευτόν, "something immovable."Phylacteries, Jewish Encyclopedia (1906). Some believe it refers to a charm, similar to the Hebrew neṭifot, "round jewel." The Talmud (Sanhedrin 4b) explains that the word ṭoṭafot is combination of two foreign words: Tot means "two" in the "Caspi" language and Fot means "two" in the "Afriki" language,The Targum often substitutes the word Afriki for Tarshish, see Kings I 10:22  hence tot and fot means "two and two", corresponding to the four compartments of the head-tefillin.Exodus 13:16, s.v. U'letotafot bein ei'neicha Menahem ben Saruq explains that the word is derived from the Hebrew Ve'hateif and Tatifoo, both expressions meaning "speech", "for when one sees the tefillin it causes him to remember and speak about The Exodus from Egypt."Rashi to Exodus 13:16, s.v. U'letotafot bein ei'neicha
The first texts to use "tefillin" are the Targumim and Peshitta and it is also used in subsequent Talmudic literature, although the word "ṭoṭafah" was still current, being used with the meaning of "frontlet." "Tefillin" may have derived from the Aramaic palal, "to plead, pray," a word closely related to the Hebrew tefillah, "prayer." Jacob ben Asher (14th century) suggests that "tefillin" is derived from the Hebrew pelilah, "justice, evidence," for tefillin act as a sign and proof of God's presence among the Jewish people.[tpl]cite book|author1=Dovid Meisels|author2=Avraham Yaakov Finkel|title=Bar mitzvah and tefillin secrets: the mysteries revealed|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hGYRAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=30 June 2011|date=30 April 2004|publisher=Dovid D.

The only instance of the name "phylacteries" in ancient times occurs once in the Greek New Testament ([tpl]bibleverse||Matthew|23:5|131[/tpl]) whence it has passed into the languages of Europe. "Phylacteries" derives from the Greek phulaktērion - φυλακτήριον, "defences," and in late Greek, "amulets" or "charms."[tpl]cite book|title=The Cambridge Bible for schools and colleges|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Rs4LAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=30 June 2011|year=1908|publisher=University press|page=175[/tpl] Neither Aquila nor Symmachus use the word "phylacteries."

==Purpose==

The tefillin are to serve as a reminder of God's intervention at the time of the Exodus from Egypt.[tpl]cite book|author=Abraham P.

The Sefer ha-Chinuch (14th century) adds that the purpose of tefillin is to help subjugate a person's worldly desires and encourage spiritual development.[tpl]cite book|author=Stephen Bailey|title=Kashrut, tefillin, tzitzit: studies in the purpose and meaning of symbolic mitzvot inspired by the commentaries of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ye2KAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=30 June 2011|date=15 June 2000|publisher=Jason Aronson|isbn=978-0-7657-6106-4|page=31[/tpl] Joseph Caro (16th century) explains that tefillin are placed on the arm adjacent to the heart and on the head above the brain to demonstrate that these two major organs are willing to perform the service of God.[tpl]cite book|author=Mosheh Ḥanina Naiman|title=Tefillin: an illustrated guide to their makeup and use|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0R04LgKkhfYC&pg=PA118|accessdate=30 June 2011|date=June 1995|publisher=Feldheim Publishers|isbn=978-0-87306-711-9|page=118[/tpl]

==Manufacture and contents==

The manufacturing process of both the boxes and the parchment scrolls are intricate and governed by hundreds of detailed rules.[tpl]cite book|author=Zeʾev Grinṿald|title=Shaarei halachah: a summary of laws for Jewish living|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Txt4EidAVFEC&pg=PA39|accessdate=1 July 2011|date=1 July 2001|publisher=Feldheim Publishers|isbn=978-1-58330-434-1|page=39[/tpl] In earlier Talmudic times, tefillin were either cylindrical or cubical, but later the cylindrical form became obsolete.[tpl]cite book|author=Norman Kiell|title=The psychodynamics of American Jewish life: an anthology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eG1CAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=4 July 2011|year=1967|publisher=Twayne Publishers|page=334[/tpl] Nowadays the boxes should be fashioned from a single piece of animal hide and form a base with an upper compartment to contain the parchment scrolls.[tpl]cite book|author=Shimon D.

The most basic form, called peshutim ("simple"), are made using several pieces of parchment to form the inner walls of the head tefillin. The higher quality tefillin, namely dakkot ("thin"), made by stretching a thin piece of leather, and the more durable gassot ("thick") are both fashioned from the single piece of hide.[tpl]cite book|author=Shimon D.

On both sides of the head-tefillin, the Hebrew letter shin ([tpl]Hebrew|ש[/tpl]) is moulded. The knot of the head-tefillin strap forms the letter dalet ([tpl]Hebrew|ד[/tpl]) or double dalet ([tpl]Hebrew|ד[/tpl]) (known as the square-knot) while the strap that is passed through the arm-tefillin is formed into a knot in the shape of the letter yud ([tpl]Hebrew|י[/tpl]). These three letters spell Shaddai ([tpl]Hebrew|ש[/tpl][tpl]Hebrew|ד[/tpl][tpl]Hebrew|י[/tpl]), one of the names of God.

===Parchment scrolls===

Four biblical passages which refer to the tefillin are placed inside the leather boxes. 
They are written by a scribe with special ink on parchment scrolls (klaf). The Hebrew Ashuri script must be and there are three main styles of lettering used: Beis Yosef – generally used by Ashkenazim; Arizal – generally used by Hasidim; Velish – used by Sefardim.[tpl]cite book|author=Shimon D. Eider|title=Student Edition of Halachos of Tefillin|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FrbbdzcfTxkC&pg=PA14|accessdate=1 July 2011|date=September 1985|publisher=Feldheim Publishers|isbn=978-1-58330-050-3|pages=13–14[/tpl] The passages contain 3,188 letters usually take between 10–15 hours to complete.What is Tefillin?, www.stam.net. Retrieved 1 July 2011, The arm-tefillin has one large compartment, which contains all four biblical passages written upon a single strip of parchment. The head-tefillin has four separate compartments in each of which one scroll of parchment is placed.
There was considerable discussion among the commentators of the Talmud as to the order in which the scrolls should be inserted into the four compartments of the head-tefillin. In the Middle Ages, a famous debate on the issue was recorded between Rashi and his grandson Rabbeinu Tam. Rashi held that the passages are placed according to the chronological order as they appear in the Torah: Kadesh Li, Ve-haya Ki Yeviehcha, Shema, Ve-haya Im Shemoa, while according to Rabbeinu Tam, the last two passages are switched around.[tpl]cite book|author=Louis Jacobs|title=The book of Jewish belief|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pFpZgMzsEWYC&pg=PA128|accessdate=1 July 2011|date=November 1984|publisher=Behrman House, Inc|isbn=978-0-87441-379-3|page=128[/tpl] Sets of tefillin dating from the 1st-century CE discovered at Qumran in the Judean Desert revealed that some were made according to the order understood by Rashi and others in the order of Rabbeinu Tam. The prevailing custom is to arrange the scrolls according to Rashi's view, but some pious Jews are also accustomed to briefly lay the teffilin of Rabbeinu Tam as well, a custom adopted by the Hasidim.[tpl]cite book|author=Tzvi Rabinowicz|title=The encyclopedia of Hasidism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OprXAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 July 2011|year=1996|publisher=Jason Aronson|isbn=978-1-56821-123-7|page=482[/tpl]  The placement of the protrusion of a tuft of the sinew (se'ar eigel) identifies as to which opinion the tefillin were written.[tpl]cite book|author=Shimon D.

==Obligation==

The duty of laying tefillin rests upon males after the age of thirteen years. Although women are exempt from the obligation, some early codifers allowed them to do so.Maimonides, Hilkhot Tzitzit 3:9; Rashba Teshuva 123; Sefer Hachinuch, Mitzvah 421; Rabbenu Tam. See Grossman, Avraham (2004). Pious and Rebellious - Jewish Women in Medieval Europe. Brandeis Univ. Moses Isserles (16th century), however, strongly discourages it.Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim, 38:3. See also Targum Yerushalmi on Deuteronomy 22:5. Historically, the mitzvah of tefillin was not performed by women, but the ritual was apparently kept by some women in medieval France and Germany.Baumgarten, Elisheva (2004). Mothers and Children - Jewish Family Life in Medieval Europe. Princeton. Traditions exist of some prominent women laying tefillinRashi's daughters allegedly wore tefillin, as did the wife of Chaim ibn Attar and the female Hasidic Rebbe known as Maiden of Ludmir. http://www.beki.org/womentefillin.html and the idea is gaining a following among women affiliated to the Conservative movement.Women and Tefillin : The United Synagogue for Conservative Judaism (USCJ) In 2013 SAR High School in Riverdale, New York began allowing girls to wrap tefillin during Shacharit-morning prayer; it is probably the first Modern Orthodox high school in the U.S. to do so. http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/nyc-orthodox-high-school-lets-girls-put-on-tefillin/2014/01/20/
Others who are not obliged to lay tefllin include a mourner during the first day of his mourning period, and a bridegroom on his wedding-day. A sufferer from stomach-trouble or one who is otherwise in pain and can not concentrate his mind is also exempt. One who is engaged in the study of the Law and scribes of and dealers in tefillin and mezuzot while engaged in their work if it can not be postponed, are also free from this obligation.
The codes view the commandment of tefillin as important and call those who neglect to observe it "transgressors."[tpl]cite book|author=Isaac David Essrig|title=The fountain of wisdom|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0DhDAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=1 July 2011|year=1932|page=18[/tpl] Maimonides counts the commandment of laying the arm-tefillin and head-tefillin as two separate positive mitzvot.Tefillin, Mezuzah, ve'Sefer Torah ch 5-6. The Talmud cites Rav Sheshet who said that by neglecting the precept, one transgresses eight positive commandments.Menahot 44a A report of widespread laxity in its observance is reported by Moses of Coucy in 13th century Spain. It may have arisen from the fear of persecution, similar to what had occurred to the Jews living in the Land of Israel under Roman rule in the 2nd-century.

==Performance==

Originally tefillin were worn all day, but not during the night. Nowadays the prevailing custom is to wear them only during the weekday morning service,Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 37:2 although some individuals wear them at other times during the day as well.
Tefillin are not donned on Shabbat and the major festivals  because these holy days are themselves considered "signs" which render the need of the "sign" of tefillin superfluous. On Chol HaMoed (intermediate days) of Pesach and Sukkot, there is a great debate among the early halachic authorities as to whether tefillin should be worn or not. Those who forbid it consider the "sign" of intermediate days as having the same status as the festival itself, making the ritual of tefillin redundant. Others argue and hold that Chol HaMoed does not constitute a "sign" in which case tefillin must be laid. Three customs evolved resulting from the dispute:
In light of the conflicting opinions, the Mishna Berura (20th-century) recommends Ashkenazim make the following stipulation before donning tefillin: "If I am obligated to don tefillin I intend to fulfill my obligation and if I am not obligated to don tefillin, my doing so should not be considered as fulfilling any obligation" and that the blessing not be recited.Mishna Berura 31:8
On the fast day of Tisha B'Av, tefillin are not worn in the morning as tefillin are considered an "adornment", symbols of beauty, which is deemed inappropriate for a day of mourning. They are worn instead at the afternoon Mincha service.[tpl]cite book|author=Hayim Donin|title=To Be a Jew: A Guide to Jewish Observance in Contemporary Life|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=efJoMK8RhAAC|accessdate=1 July 2011|year=1991|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-08632-0|page=265[/tpl] There are those however who have a Custom(Jews from Allepo,Syria) on Tisha B'Ab to privately put on tefillin at home and pray privately, say the Amida and take off the tefilin and go to synagogue to finish the prayers.

===How to put on tefillin===

Ashkenazim put on and remove the tefillin while standing, while Sephardim do so while sitting.[tpl]cite book|author=Zeʾev Grinṿald|title=Shaarei halachah: a summary of laws for Jewish living|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Txt4EidAVFEC&pg=PA36|accessdate=4 July 2011|date=1 July 2001|publisher=Feldheim Publishers|isbn=978-1-58330-434-1|page=36[/tpl] It is forbidden to speak or be distracted while putting on the tefillin.  An Ashkenazi says two blessings when laying tefillin, the first before he ties the arm-tefillin: ...lehani'ach tefillin, and the second after placing the head tefillin: ...al mitzvat tefillin, thereafter he tightens the head straps and says "Baruch Shem Kovod...."[tpl]cite book|author=Eliyahu Kitov|title=The Jew and His Home|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NQNG3I9ZLVUC&pg=PA488|accessdate=4 July 2011|year=2000|publisher=Feldheim Publishers|isbn=978-1-58330-711-3|page=488[/tpl] The Sephardic custom is that no blessing is said for the head-tefillin, the first blessing sufficing for both.  Many members of the Chabad Orthodox movement only recite the blessing on the Head-Tefillah if they spoke about something not related to tefillin since reciting the blessing on the Hand-Tefillah.(this is also the Sephardic custom).
The arm-tefillin is laid on the inner side of the bare left arm, two finger breadths above the elbow, so that when the arm is bent the tefillin faces towards the heart. If one is left-handed, it is placed on the right arm in the same place. After the blessing is said, the arm-tefillin is tightened, and the strap wound seven times round the arm. Then the head-tefillin is placed on the middle of the head just above the forehead, so that no parts rests below the hairline.[tpl]cite book|author=Louis Jacobs|title=The book of Jewish practice|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qPW0BFLYb4kC&pg=PA35|accessdate=4 July 2011|date=1 June 1987|publisher=Behrman House, Inc|isbn=978-0-87441-460-8|page=35[/tpl] The knot of the head-tefillin sits at the back of the head, upon the part of the occipital bone that protrudes just above the nape, directly opposite the optic chiasm.[tpl]cite book|author=Michael L. Munk|title=The wisdom in the Hebrew alphabet: the sacred letters as a guide to Jewish deed and thought|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2jdXCGxQOysC&pg=PA173|accessdate=4 July 2011|date=April 1983|publisher=Mesorah Publications|isbn=978-0-89906-193-1|page=173[/tpl] The two straps of the head-tefillin are brought in front of the shoulders, with their blackened side facing outwards. Now the remainder of the arm-tefillin straps are wound  three times around the middle finger and around the hand to form the shape of the Hebrew letter of either a shin ([tpl]Hebrew|ש[/tpl]) according to Ashkenazim, or a dalet ([tpl]Hebrew|ד[/tpl]) according to Sephardim. There are various customs regarding winding the strap on the arm and hand. In fact, the arm strap is looped for clockwise wrapping with Ashkenazi tefillin while it is knotted for counter clockwise wrapping with Sephardic and Chabad tefillin. On removing the tefillin, the steps are reversed.
