CATEGORIES: Typographical symbols, Punctuation

The section sign (Unicode [tpl]unichar|00A7|Section sign[/tpl], HTML &sect;, TeX \S) is a typographical character used mainly to refer to a particular section of a document, such as a legal code.[tpl]cite web | title = Legal Research and Citation Style in USA, by Ronald M. Standler | url = http://www.rbs0.com/lawcite.htm#anchor333333 | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2009-12-15[/tpl] It is also called "double S", "hurricane", and "sectional symbol".
The likely origin of the section sign is the digraph formed by the combination of two S glyphs (from the Latin signum sectiōnis).
When duplicated, as §§, it is read as the plural "sections" (e.g. "§§ 13–21"), much as "pp." (pages) is the plural of "p.".
It is frequently used along with the pilcrow (¶), or paragraph sign. 
Like the dagger (†) and double dagger (‡), it is also sometimes used to link to a footnote where the asterisk (*) is already in use on a given page; however, these usages are declining[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] in favor of numbered footnotes, usually put in superscript or square brackets.
