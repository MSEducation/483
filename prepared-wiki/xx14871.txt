Kenneth Charles Williams (22 February 1926 – 15 April 1988) was an English comic actor and comedian. He was one of the main ensemble in 26 of the Carry On films and appeared in numerous British television shows and radio comedies with Tony Hancock and Kenneth Horne.

==Life and career==

Kenneth Charles Williams was born on 22 February 1926 in Bingfield Street, King's Cross, London,GRO Register of Births: March 1926 1b 408 Islington - Kenneth C. Williams the son of Louisa ("Lou" or "Louie") Morgan and Charles Williams, a barber. Williams had a half-sister, Alice Patricia "Pat", born illegitimately before Louie had met Charlie Williams.  He was educated at Lyulph Stanley School, later becoming apprenticed as a draughtsman to a mapmaker. He joined the Army in 1944 at 18. As part of the Royal Engineers survey section in Bombay; he first performed on stage in the Combined Services Entertainment alongside Stanley Baxter and Peter Nichols.Army http://www.britmovie.co.uk/actors/Kenneth-Williams Retrieved 8 October 2007 He was a voracious reader able to quote poems or literary extracts from memory. Excerpts from the diaries he kept as an adult show that he adored his supportive and theatrical mother but despised his homophobic, morose and selfish father.

===Comic performer===

Williams's professional career began in 1948 in repertory theatre. Failure to become a serious dramatic actor disappointed him, but his potential as a comic performer gave him his break when he was spotted playing the Dauphin in George Bernard Shaw's St Joan in 1954 by radio producer Dennis Main Wilson. Main Wilson was casting Hancock's Half Hour, a radio series starring Tony Hancock. Playing mostly funny voice roles, Williams stayed in the series almost to the end, five years later.Hancock's Half Hour http://www.britmovie.co.uk/actors/w/004.html Retrieved 8 October 2007 His nasal, whiny, camp-cockney inflections (epitomised in his "Stop messing about ... !" catchphrase) became popular with listeners.Stop messing about.. http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thekennethwilliamsshow/ Retrieved 8 October 2007 Despite the success and recognition the show brought him, Williams thought theatre, film and television were superior forms of entertainment.
When Hancock moved the show away from what he considered gimmicks and silly voices, Williams had less to do on the programme. Tiring of his reduced status, he joined Kenneth Horne in Beyond Our Ken (1958–1964), and its sequel, Round the Horne (1965–1968). His roles in Round the Horne included Rambling Syd Rumpo, the eccentric folk singer; Dr Chou En Ginsberg, MA (failed), Oriental criminal mastermind; J. Peasemold Gruntfuttock, telephone heavy breather and dirty old man; and Sandy of the camp couple Julian and Sandy (Julian was played by Hugh Paddick). Their double act contained double entendres and Polari, the homosexual argot.
Williams appeared in West End revues including Share My Lettuce with Maggie Smith, written by Bamber Gascoigne, and Pieces of Eight with Fenella Fielding. The latter included material written by Peter Cook, then a student at Pembroke College, Cambridge. Cook's "One Leg Too Few" and "Interesting Facts" were part of the show and became routines in his own performances. Williams' last revue was One over the Eight, with Sheila Hancock. In 1972, Williams starred opposite Jennie Linden in My Fat Friend. He also appeared with Ingrid Bergman in a stage production of George Bernard Shaw's Captain Brassbound's Conversion in 1971.

===Carry On===

Williams worked regularly in British film during the 1960s and 1970s, mainly in the Carry On series (1958–1978) with its double entendre humour. He appeared in the series more than any other actor.http://www.britmovie.co.uk/actors/w/004.html Retrieved 8 October 2007 The films were commercially successful but Williams and the rest of the cast were poorly paid. In his diaries, Williams wrote that he earned more in a British Gas advert than for any Carry On film. He often criticised Carry On films, his own performances and those of others, considering them beneath him. This was the case with many of the films, television programmes, stage plays and radio shows in which he appeared. He was quick to find fault with his own work. Despite this, he spoke fondly of the Carry On films in interviews. Peter Rogers, producer of the series, recollected, "Kenneth was worth taking care of because, while he cost very little – £5,000 a film, he made a great deal of money for the franchise."Kenneth Williams Unseen by Wes Butters and Russell Davies, HarperCollins 2008, p224

===Radio and television shows===

Williams was a regular on the BBC radio panel game Just a Minute from its second season in 1968 until his death. From 1972, when he felt he wasn't being appreciated, he would scream, "I've come all the way from Great Portland Street." (It was a short distance to the studio from his home.) He also talked for almost a minute[tpl]cite web|url=http://just-a-minute.info/jam279.html |title=JAM:KWilliams,DNimmo,CFreud,AMelly |publisher=Just-a-minute.info |date=1971-02-09 |accessdate=11 September 2011[/tpl] about a supposed Austrian psychiatrist called Heinrich Swartzberg, correctly guessing that show creator Ian Messiter had just made the name up.My Life and Other Games, Ian Messiter, 1990 ISBN 1-872180-61-2
On television he was a frequent contributor to the 1973–1974 revival of What's My Line?, hosted the weekly entertainment show International Cabaret and was a regular narrator for the children's story-reading series Jackanory on BBC1. He appeared on Michael Parkinson's chat show on eight occasions, during which he told anecdotes from his career. Williams was a stand-in host on the Wogan talk show in 1986. Williams also voiced the cartoon "Willo the Wisp".

==Personal life and death==

On 14 October 1962, Williams's father, Charlie, was taken to hospital after drinking carbon tetrachloride that had been stored in a cough mixture bottle. Williams refused to visit him, and the following day went out for lunch and then to the cinema. Charlie died that afternoon and, an hour after being informed, Williams went on stage in the West End. The coroner's court recorded a verdict of accidental death due to corrosive poisoning by carbon tetrachloride.[tpl]Cite news|work=Daily Mail | location=London|date=30 November 2005|title=Did Kenneth Kill Himself?|author=Geoffrey Wansell|page=32|quote=... in October 1962, Charlie Williams died after drinking a bottle of carbon tetrachloride in mysterious circumstances—a death that has eerie echoes of Kenneth Williams's own. He drank from a bottle labelled Gees Linctus but which actually contained poison, and the coroner recorded a verdict of death by misadventure, due to bronchial pneumonia and carbon tetrachloride poisoning, self-administered, by accident. Many, perhaps Kenneth included, believed it was suicide.[/tpl]
Several years later Williams turned down work with Orson Welles in America because he did not like the country and had no desire to work there.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] Many years after his death, The Mail on Sunday, quoting Wes Butters, co-writer of the book Kenneth Williams Unseen: The Private Notes, Scripts And Photographs, claimed Williams had been denied a visa because Scotland Yard considered him a suspect in his father's death."Did Kenneth Williams poison his father?" Daily Mail, 31 October 2008
Williams insisted that he was celibate, and his diaries substantiate his claims – at least from his early 40s onwards. He lived alone all his adult life and had few close companions apart from his mother, and no romantic relationships of significance. His diaries contain references to unconsummated or barely consummated homosexual dalliances, which he describes as "traditional matters" or "tradiola" (since male homosexual activity was a criminal offence in the UK before 1967, outright admission would have been held against him if anyone had read the diaries). He befriended gay playwright Joe Orton, who wrote the role of Inspector Truscott in Loot (1966) for him, and had holidays with Orton and his lover, Kenneth Halliwell, in Morocco. Other friends included Stanley Baxter, Gordon Jackson and his wife Rona Anderson, Sheila Hancock, Maggie Smith and her playwright husband, Beverley Cross.[tpl]cite book | last = Davies | first = Russell | year = 1993 | title = The Kenneth Williams diaries | publisher = HarperCollins | location =  | isbn = 0-00-255023-7 [/tpl]
Williams lived in a succession of small rented flats in central London from the mid-1950s. After his father died, his mother, Louisa, lived close by him and, finally, in the flat next to his. His last home was a flat on Osnaburgh Street, now demolished. Williams was fond of fellow Carry On regulars Barbara Windsor, Kenneth Connor, Hattie Jacques, Joan Sims and Bernard Bresslaw.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
Williams rarely revealed details of his private life, though he spoke openly to Owen Spencer-Thomas about his loneliness, despondency and sense of underachievement in two half-hour documentary programmes entitled Carry On Kenneth on BBC Radio London.Radio Times (London edition) 23–29 July 1977 In later years his health declined, along with that of his elderly mother, and his depression deepened. He died on 15 April 1988 in his flat - his last words (recorded in his diary) were "Oh, what's the bloody point?"GRO Register of Deaths: JUN 1988 14 1873 CAMDEN - Kenneth Charles Williams, DoB = 22 Feb 1926 aged 62 - the cause of death was an overdose of barbiturates.Overdose http://www.britmovie.co.uk/actors/w/004.html Retrieved 8 October 2007 An inquest recorded an open verdict, as it was not possible to establish whether his death was a suicide or an accident.[tpl]Cite news|work=The Guardian | location=London|date=17 June 1988|title=Open verdict recorded on Williams|quote=Dr John Elliott, deputy coroner for inner north London said: The cause of death was a barbiturate overdose. Where Mr Williams would have got these from we would not be able to establish. There is no indication given as to why he should have taken this overdose and therefore I record an open verdict.[/tpl] His diaries reveal he had often had suicidal thoughts and as far back as his earliest diaries he noted there were times when he could not see any point in existence. His authorised biography argues that Williams did not take his own life but died of an accidental overdose. The actor had doubled his dosage of antacid without discussing this with his doctor, which, combined with the aforementioned mixture of medication, is the widely accepted cause of death. He had a stock of painkilling tablets and it is argued that he would have taken more of them if he had been intending suicide.[ref]

===Diaries and biographies===

Posthumous publication of his diaries and letters, edited by Russell Davies, caused controversy—particularly Williams's caustic remarks about fellow professionals—and revealed bouts of despair, often primed by feelings of personal isolation and professional failure. Williams wrote his diaries from the age of 14 in 1940 until his death 48 years later, although the earliest to survive to publication was for 1942 when he reached 16. Williams kept pocket-sized diaries for 1942 and 1947 (he kept no diaries for 1943 to 1946 as he was touring the Far East in the army); a desk diary for 1948; pocket-sized diaries for 1949 and 1950; desk diaries for 1951 to 1965; standard edition desk diaries for 1966 to 1971, and finally A4-sized executive desk diaries for 1972 to 1988. He claimed that writing in his diaries eased the loneliness he often felt. The day before his death, the final entry in his diary read, "Oh - what's the bloody point?"[tpl]cite web|last=Quirk|first=Justin|title=In praise of Kenneth Williams|url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/apr/08/kennethwilliams|work=TV&Radio Blog|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=22 February 2014|archivedate=8 April 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Thomson|first=Ian|title=Born Brilliant: The Life of Kenneth Williams by Christopher Stevens: review|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/8090239/Born-Brilliant-The-Life-of-Kenneth-Williams-by-Christopher-Stevens-review.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=22 February 2014|archivedate=31 October 2010[/tpl] 
In April 2008 Radio 4 broadcast the two-part The Pain of Laughter: The Last Days of Kenneth Williams. The programmes were researched and written by Wes Butters and narrated by Rob Brydon. Butters purchased a collection of Williams's personal belongings from the actor's godson, Robert Chidell, to whom they had been bequeathed."The truth behind that famous smile", Radio Times 5–11 April 2008
The first of the programmes said that, towards the end of his life and struggling with depression and ill health, Williams abandoned Christian faith following discussions with the poet Philip Larkin. Williams had been a Methodist, though he spent much of his life struggling with Christianity's teachings on homosexuality.[tpl]cite web |title=The Pain of Laughter; The Last Days of Kenneth Williams |accessdate=2 November 2009 |publisher=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/painoflaughter/pip/om8uw/[/tpl]
