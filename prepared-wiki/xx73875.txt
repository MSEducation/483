The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (Libertad) Act of 1996 (Helms–Burton Act, [tpl]USPL|104|114[/tpl], [tpl]USStat|110|785[/tpl], [tpl]USC|22|6021|6091[/tpl]) is a United States federal law which strengthens and continues the United States embargo against Cuba. The act extended the territorial application of the initial embargo to apply to foreign companies trading with Cuba, and penalized foreign companies allegedly "trafficking" in property formerly owned by U.S. citizens but confiscated by Cuba after the Cuban revolution. The act also covers property formerly owned by Cubans who have since become U.S. citizens.http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp98/rp98-114.pdf
The Act is named for its original sponsors, Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana.
The law was passed on March 12, 1996 by the 104th United States Congress.  The bill, which had been tabled in late 1995 after Senator Helms was unable to overcome several Democratic filibusters, was reintroduced prompted by an episode that happened a month earlier.  On February 24, 1996, Cuban fighter jets shot down two private planes operated by a Miami based anti-Castro Cuban refugee support group called Brothers to the Rescue ([tpl]lang-es|Hermanos al Rescate[/tpl]).[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9602/cuba_shootdown/27/ | work=CNN | title=Clinton moves to punish Cuba for downing planes[/tpl]

==Content==

This law includes a wide variety of provisions intended to bring about "a peaceful transition to a representative democracy and market economy in Cuba":

===Notes===

==Summary==

Title I strengthened sanctions against the current Cuban Government. Among many other provisions, it codified the U.S. embargo on trade and financial transactions which had been in effect pursuant to a Presidential proclamation since the Kennedy Administration.
Title II describes U.S. policy toward and assistance to a free and independent Cuba. It required the President to produce a plan for providing economic assistance to a transition or democratic government in Cuba. (The President delivered the plan to Congress in January 1997.)
Title III creates a private cause of action and authorizes U.S. nationals with claims to confiscated property in Cuba to file suit in U.S. courts against persons that may be "trafficking" in that property. The Act grants the President the authority to suspend the lawsuit provisions for periods of 6 months if it is necessary to the national interest of the United States and will expedite a transition to democracy in Cuba. The President has exercised this authority several times, most recently in January 2013.http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/31/presidential-memorandum-delegation-authority-suspend-provisions-title-ii
Title IV requires the denial of visas to and exclusion from the U.S. of persons who, after March 12, 1996, confiscate or "traffic" in confiscated property in Cuba claimed by U.S. nationals. The objective of this provision is to protect the status of confiscated U.S. property and to support existing sanctions against the current regime. The State Department reviews a broad range of economic activity in Cuba to determine the applicability of Title IV. The results of this effort appear not only in the actual determinations of "trafficking," but also in the deterrent to investment in confiscated U.S. property and in the exacerbation of the uncertainty of investing in Cuba.

==Legislative history==

==Reactions==

The Helms–Burton Act was condemned by the Council of Europe, the European Union, Britain, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and other U.S. allies that enjoy normal trade relations with Cuba. The governments argued that the law ran counter to the spirit of international law and sovereignty.
After a complaint by the European Union with the World Trade Organization, a dispute settlement panel was established. Later, the work of the panel was suspended to find a solution through negotiations. After a year, the panel lost its jurisdiction over the matter, and the EU did not pursue the matter any further before the WTO.
The law has also been condemned by humanitarian groups because these groups argue that sanctions against an entire country will affect only the innocent population.
The law provides for compensation of only the largest of claims for confiscated property, primarily only the claims of large multinational companies (valued at roughly $6 billion).  It fails to provide for the claims of individuals of the exiled Cuban-American community whose personal residences were confiscated.
The European Union introduced a Council Regulation (No 2271/96)http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31996R2271:EN:HTML (law binding all member states) declaring the extraterritorial provisions of the Helms–Burton Act to be unenforceable within the EU, and permitting recovery of any damages imposed under it. The EU law also applied sanctions against US companies and their executives for making Title III complaints.
The United Kingdom had previously introduced provisions by statutory instrumenthttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1992/2449/contents/made extending its Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (originally passed in the wake of extraterritorial claims by the U.S. in the 1970s) to United States rules on trade with Cuba. United Kingdom law was later extended to counter-act the Helms–Burton Act as well. This included criminal sanctions for complying with certain provisions[tpl]clarify|date=February 2013[/tpl] of the Helms–Burton Act whilst in the UK.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/3171/contents/made[tpl]failed verification|date=February 2013[/tpl]
Mexico passed a law in October 1996 aimed at neutralizing the Helms–Burton Act.  The law provides for a fine of 2.2 million pesos, or $280,254, against anyone who while in Mexican territory obeys another country's laws aimed at reducing Mexican trade or foreign investment in a third country.
Similarly, Canada passed a law to counteract the effect of Helms-Burton.  In addition, its legislature proposed (but did not pass) the Godfrey-Milliken Bill that satirized Burton-Helms.  Sponsored by a Loyalist descendant, it demanded recompense for United Empire Loyalists and proposing similar travel restrictions on those "trafficking" in property confiscated during the American Revolution.
Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush both signed a provision allowing for a waiver of the law.[tpl]Vague|date=July 2010[/tpl]  Effective May 10, 1999, with CFR Title 31 Part 515, the act was amended.[tpl]Vague|date=July 2010[/tpl]
The following are laws that were passed in different countries to counteract the effects of Helms-Burton:
