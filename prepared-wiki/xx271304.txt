[[Fake minerals and fossils]]

CATEGORIES: Mineralogy

The fake minerals and fossils are minerals (or gems, that is to say outstanding minerals) and fossils not natural, man-made. This can be either a natural mineral or fossil transformed by man into another, or an entirely artificial mineral or fossil. Also referred to as false to the synonyms. In short, counterfeiting may be partial (sample processed) or total (sample created by humans) or cover the name given to the sample.
They have always existed, their marketing is growing very rapidly. There are now numerous examples of fakes in mineralogy, gemmology and paleontology.
If there are criteria for authentication of minerals and fossils, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between fake and genuine ones. Fake samples are sold for real deception, but when the infringement is found, it may have a financial interest, decorative or teaching for the buyer. Although rocks and meteors are not, strictly speaking, minerals or fossils, they are treated in this article.
