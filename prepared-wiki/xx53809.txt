The Ouija board  ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|w|iː|dʒ|ə[/tpl] [tpl]respell|WEE|jə[/tpl]) also known as a spirit board or talking board, is a flat board marked with the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0–9, the words "yes", "no", "hello" (occasionally), and "goodbye", along with various symbols and graphics. It uses a planchette (small heart-shaped piece of wood) or movable indicator to indicate the spirit's message by spelling it out on the board during a séance. Participants place their fingers on the planchette, and it is moved about the board to spell out words. "Ouija" has become a trademark that is often used generically to refer to any talking board.
Following its commercial introduction by businessman Elijah Bond on July 1, 1890,[tpl]cite web |title=US Trademark Registration Number 0519636 under First Use In Commerce |url=http://tess2.uspto.gov/ |publisher=Tess2.uspto.gov [/tpl] the Ouija board was regarded as a harmless parlor game unrelated to the occult until American Spiritualist Pearl Curran popularized its use as a divining tool during World War I.
Mainstream religions and some occultists have associated use of a Ouija board with the concept of demonic possession, and view the use of the board as a spiritual threat and have cautioned their followers not to use a Ouija board.[tpl]cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=oLcqlypMCe8C&pg=PA65&dq=ouija++christian&cd=7#v=onepage&q=ouija%20%20christian&f=false|title = Raising the devil: Satanism, new religions, and the media|publisher =University Press of Kentucky|accessdate = 2007-12-31[/tpl]
Despite being criticized by the scientific community and deemed demonic by Christians, Ouija remains popular among many people.[tpl]cite book|last=Brunvand|first=Jan Harold |title=American folklore: an encyclopedia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=l0N_sedAATAC&pg=PA534&dq=ouija+debunked&ct=result#v=onepage&q=ouija%20debunked&f=false|year=1998|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-8153-3350-0[/tpl]

==History==

===China===

One of the first mentions of the automatic writing method used in the Ouija board is found in China around 1100 AD, in historical documents of the Song Dynasty. The method was known as fuji (扶乩), "planchette writing". The use of planchette writing as an ostensible means of contacting the dead and the spirit-world continued, and, albeit under special rituals and supervisions, was a central practice of the Quanzhen School, until it was forbidden by the Qing Dynasty.Silvers, Brock. The Taoist Manual (Honolulu: Sacred Mountain Press, 2005), p. 129–132. Several entire scriptures of the Daozang are supposedly works of automatic planchette writing. Similar methods of mediumistic spirit writing have been widely practiced in ancient India, Greece, Rome, and medieval Europe.Chao Wei-pang. 1942. "The origin and Growth of the Fu Chi", Folklore Studies 1:9–27

===Toy===

During the late 19th century, planchettes were widely sold as a novelty. The businessmen Elijah Bond and Charles Kennard had the idea to patent a planchette sold with a board on which the alphabet was printed. The patentees filed on May 28, 1890 for patent protection and thus had invented the first Ouija board. Issue date on the patent was February 10, 1891. They received [tpl]US patent|446054[/tpl]. Bond was an attorney and was an inventor of other objects in addition to this device. 
An employee of Kennard, William Fuld took over the talking board production and in 1901, he started production of his own boards under the name "Ouija".[tpl]cite web|last=Orlando|first=Eugene|title=Ancient Ouija Boards: Fact ot Fiction?|url=http://www.museumoftalkingboards.com/ancient.html|work=Museum of Talking Boards|accessdate=24 April 2012[/tpl]  Kennard claimed he learned the name "Ouija" from using the board and that it was an ancient Egyptian word meaning "good luck." When Fuld took over production of the boards, he popularized the more widely accepted etymology, that the name came from a combination of the French and German words for "yes".Cornelius, J. E. Aleister Crowley and the Ouija Board, pp. 20–21. Feral House, 2005. 
The Fuld name would become synonymous with the Ouija board, as Fuld reinvented its history, claiming that he himself had invented it. The strange talk about the boards from Fuld's competitors flooded the market, and all these boards enjoyed a heyday from the 1920s through the 1960s. Fuld sued many companies over the "Ouija" name and concept right up until his death in 1927. In 1966, Fuld's estate sold the entire business to Parker Brothers, which was sold to Hasbro in 1991, and which continues to hold all trademarks and patents. About ten brands of talking boards are sold today under various names.

==Criticism==

===Religious===

Most religious criticism of the Ouija board has come from Christians, primarily evangelicals in the United States. In 2001, Ouija boards were burned in Alamogordo, New Mexico by fundamentalist groups alongside Harry Potter books as "symbols of witchcraft."[ref][tpl]Cite journal | last = Ishizuka | first = Kathy | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Harry Potter book burning draws fire | journal = School Library Journal | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | page = 27 | publisher = | location = New York | date = February 2002 | url = | issn =  | doi =[/tpl]

Ouija boards have been criticized in the press since their inception; having been variously described as [tpl]"'[/tpl]vestigial remains' of primitive belief-systems" and a con to part fools from their money.[tpl]cite news|author = |title = Everything You Wanted To Know|publisher = The Statesman|date = October 11, 2009|url =[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal | last = Howerth | first = I.

===Scientific===

The Ouija phenomenon has been criticized by many scientists as a hoax related to the ideomotor response.[tpl]Cite journal | last = Burgess | first = Cheryl A | authorlink = | coauthors = Irving Kirsch, Howard Shane, Kristen L.

 The planchette is guided by unconscious muscular exertions like those responsible for table movement. Nonetheless, in both cases, the illusion that the object (table or planchette) is moving under its own control is often extremely powerful and sufficient to convince many people that spirits are truly at work... The unconscious muscle movements responsible for the moving tables and Ouija board phenomena seen at seances are examples of a class of phenomena due to what psychologists call a dissociative state. A dissociative state is one in which consciousness is somehow divided or cut off from some aspects of the individual’s normal cognitive, motor, or sensory functions.Hines, Terence. (2003). Pseudoscience and the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. p. 47 
In the 1970s Ouija board users were also described as "cult members" by sociologists, though this was severely scrutinised in the field.[tpl]Cite journal | last = Robbins | first = Thomas | authorlink = | coauthors = Dick Anthony | title = The Sociology of Contemporary Religious Movements | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 81–7 | publisher = Annual Reviews | year = 1979 | jstor = 2945948 | issn = | doi =[/tpl]

==Use in creation of literature==

Ouija boards have been the source of inspiration for literary works, used as guidance in writing, or as a form of channeling literary works. As a result of Ouija boards becoming popular in the early 20th century, by the 1920s many "psychic" books were written of varying quality often initiated by Ouija board use.[ref]

In 1982, poet James Merrill released an apocalyptic 560-page epic poem entitled The Changing Light at Sandover, which documented two decades of messages dictated from the Ouija board during séances hosted by Merrill and his partner David Noyes Jackson.  Sandover, which received the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1983,[tpl]cite web|title=All Past National Book Critics Circle Awards Winners and Finalists|url=http://bookcritics.org/awards/past_awards/|publisher=National Book Critics Circle|accessdate=24 April 2012[/tpl] was published in three volumes beginning in 1976.

Former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi claimed under oath that, in a séance held in 1978 with other professors at the University of Bologna, the "ghost" of Giorgio La Pira used a Ouija to spell the name of the street where Aldo Moro was being held by the Red Brigades. According to Peter Popham of Independent: "Everybody here has long believed that Prodi's Ouija board tale was no more than an ill-advised and bizarre way to conceal the identity of his true source, probably a person from Bologna's seething far-left underground whom he was pledged to protect."
