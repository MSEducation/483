Intel Many Integrated Core Architecture or Intel MIC (pronounced Mike) is a multiprocessor computer architecture developed by Intel incorporating earlier work on the Larrabee many core architecture, the Teraflops Research Chip multicore chip research project, and the Intel Single-chip Cloud Computer multicore microprocessor.
Prototype products codenamed Knights Ferry were announced and released to developers in 2010. The Knights Corner product was announced in 2011 and uses a 22nm process. A second generation product codenamed Knights Landing using a 14nm process was announced in June 2013.
In September 2011, the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) announced it would use Knights Corner cards in their 10 PetaFLOPS "Stampede" supercomputer, providing 8 PetaFLOPS of computing power.
At the International Supercomputing Conference (2012, Hamburg), Intel announced the branding of the processor product family as Intel Xeon Phi.
In November 2012, Intel formally announced the first products citing claims of CPU-like versatile programmability, high performance and  power efficiency.[tpl]cite web|title=Intel Delivers New Architecture for Discovery with Intel® Xeon Phi™ Coprocessors|url=http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2012/11/12/intel-delivers-new-architecture-for-discovery-with-intel-xeon-phi-coprocessors|publisher=Intel|accessdate=21 June 2013[/tpl] The Green 500 list placed a system using these new products as the most power efficient computer in the world.[tpl]cite web|title=The Green500 List - November 2012|url=http://www.green500.org/news/green500-list-november-2012|publisher=Green500|accessdate=21 June 2013[/tpl]

==History==

===Background===

The Larrabee microarchitecture (in development since 2006[tpl]citation |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1029138/new-from-intel-its-mini-cores |title= New from Intel: It's Mini-Cores! |author= Charlie Demerjian |date= 3 July 2006 |work= www.theinquirer.net |publisher= The Inquirer[/tpl]) introduced very wide (512-bit) SIMD units to a x86 architecture based processor design, extended to a cache coherent multiprocessor system connected via a ring bus to memory; each core was capable of 4-way multi-threading. Due to the design being intended for GPU as well as general purpose computing the Larrabee chips also included specialised hardware for texture sampling.[tpl]cite doi|10.1145/1360612.1360617[/tpl] The project to produce a GPU retail product directly from the Larrabee research project was terminated in May 2010.
Another contemporary Intel research project implementing x86 architecture on a many-multicore processor was the 'Single Chip Cloud Computer', (prototype introduced 2009.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/183653/intel_48core_singlechip_cloud_computer_improves_power_efficiency.html |title= Intel 48-Core "Single-Chip Cloud Computer" Improves Power Efficiency |author= Tony Bradley |publisher= PCWorld |work= www.pcworld.com |date= 3 December 2009[/tpl]), a design mimicking a cloud computing computer datacentre on a single chip with multiple independent cores - the prototype design included 48 cores per chip with hardware support for selective frequency and voltage control of cores to maximize energy efficiency, and incorporated a mesh network for interchip messaging. The design lacked cache coherent cores and focused on principles that would allow the design to scale to many more cores.[tpl]citation|url= http://techresearch.intel.com/ProjectDetails.aspx?Id=1 |title= Intel Research : Single-Chip Cloud Computer |publisher= Intel |work= techresearch.intel.com[/tpl]
