Albert Bridge is a road bridge spanning the River Clyde in Glasgow, Scotland. The bridge, opened in 1871, links the Saltmarket in the city centre with Crown Street on the southside, is category A listed, and named after Queen Victoria's consort, Prince Albert.

==History==

Albert Bridge is the fifth bridge to be built on the site in Glasgow. The first bridge on the site was built in 1794 and was known as Hutcheson Bridge but was destroyed by flooding in 1795. A timber footbridge replaced it in 1803, and in 1834 a masonry arch bridge was designed by Robert Stevenson, grandfather of Robert Louis Stevenson.[tpl]cite web|title=Albert Bridge history|url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=8092|publisher=Glasgow City Council|accessdate=11/8/13[/tpl]
Prior to building the new Albert Bridge, a temporary bridge was built to maintain traffic flow.

==Construction==

Albert Bridge is founded on concrete piers and abutments filled with cast iron caissons, sunk some 86 ft below water level. Traditional masonry was rejected in favour of rivetted wrought iron elliptical arches, the largest of which spans 114 ft. The arch ribs are masked by cast iron spandrels adorned with the Royal coat of arms, the coat of arms of Prince Albert and those of various corporate bodies.
The bridge carries the eastern arm of the A8 across the River Clyde. It is two way with 2 lanes and it is complemented by the Victoria Bridge on the other side of the railway bridge, which is one-way northbound.
In 2013 a £2 million refurbishment plan was announced to bring the 140 year old bridge back to it former glory.[tpl]cite web|title=Albert Bridge refurbishment|url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=8092|publisher=Glasgow City Council|accessdate=11/8/13[/tpl]
