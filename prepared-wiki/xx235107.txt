Sails with leading edges streamlined using the Van Bussel system were fitted. The mill was working until 1952, and then stood idle. The mill was dismantled in 1978, the cap surviving alongside the mill. The smock survives to its full height, retaining the stage. The mill is used as living accommodation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coevorden.nl/web/show/id=188680 |title=Molen in Schoonoord |publisher=Gemeente Coevorden |language=Dutch |accessdate=17 October 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==Description==

The Molen van Schoonoord is what the Dutch describe as an "achtkante stellingmolen". It is a two-storey smock mill with a stage on a three-storey brick base. The stage is at second-floor level, [tpl]convert|5.50|m|ftin[/tpl] above ground level. The smock is thatched. The mill was winded by a tailpole and winch. The four Common sails had a span of [tpl]convert|18.00|m|ftin[/tpl] and were carried in a cast-iron windshaft.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.molens.nl/dbase/molen.php?&molenid=1428 |title=Technische gegevens |publisher=De Hollandsche Molen |language=Dutch |accessdate=17 October 2009[/tpl] (Click on "Technische gegevens" to view.) The mill drove a single pair of millstones.
