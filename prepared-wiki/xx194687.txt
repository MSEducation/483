The 1971 science fiction film THX 1138 was sampled in song "Operating Tracks" it uses the lines "We have to go back!  This is your last chance.", "1138 What's wrong?" "1138 retract. noise. 1138 retract, someone's touching TTL integrated logic module. Switching to manual.", "Would you like a salt epidermal?", "1138 What's wrong?", "1138 You're getting Talbot contact", "We're tracked at 2.20, Vector oh seven niner, but we're making contact at point 0 0 3", "Now don't override here, this is critical.", "OK you can start your descent, thats it, slow down just a little bit, you're overriding point seven", "OK, hold it 1138" and many sound effects of the film. The song "GVDT" uses the same "What's wrong" vocal sample and the sound of the car is driven in the film.
