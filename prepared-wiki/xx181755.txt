==Reported hauntings==

===The "White Lady"===

The most famous character said to haunt the cemetery is the mysterious "White Lady", who has been sighted by several witnesses, including police and firemen. Many people have taken photographs of her; demonologist Ed Warren claims to have captured her essence on film. She is described as having long, dark hair, wearing what looks like a white nightgown and a white bonnet. The White Lady is usually sighted in the roadway along Route 59 or sometimes 111, and there are many reports of vehicles passing through her; in one instance, in 1993, an impact with the White Lady apparently made a dent in the vehicle of an off-duty fireman. 
The White Lady is also said to haunt the nearby Stepney Cemetery in Monroe, Connecticut. It is believed that she walks back and forth between the two.

==="Red Eyes"===

Another character considered to haunt the cemetery is "Red Eyes". A person walking by the cemetery at night claims to have seen a pair of red eyes peering at him from the brush. As he turned and ran, he heard footsteps following him. Cosmic Society's Donna Kent speculates that it was the ghost of Earle Kellog, a man who was set afire across the street and burned to death in 1935, or a man killed by a drunken driver, who reportedly provided his name—and a number of choice expletives—to a group of boys trying to capture electronic voice phenomena (EVP) in the cemetery one night.
