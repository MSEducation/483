"Misty" is a jazz standard written in 1954 by the pianist Erroll Garner.
Originally composed as an instrumental following the traditional 32-bar format and first recorded for Garner's 1955 album Contrasts, the tune was later paired with lyrics by Johnny Burke and became the signature song of Johnny Mathis, appearing on his 1959 album Heavenly and reaching #12 on the U.S. Pop Singles chart later that year.

===Johnny Mathis===

Mathis had heard Garner play the song, and told Garner that he'd love to sing it if Garner had lyrics for it.  When Mathis recorded it, Garner showed up.[tpl]Pop Chronicles |23|2 |Johnny Mathis[/tpl]
Although there were already several released versions, the Mathis version recorded in 1958 popularized this virtually unknown song composed by Erroll Garner, a jazz pianist/composer, which inspired Clint Eastwood to use it in his movie Play Misty for Me, a low-budget film that proved to be a huge box-office smash. Eastwood, a fan of Mathis, ended up paying a nominal fee for the Erroll Garner recording in his film. The Mathis recording of "Misty" sold well over two million copies in the USA alone.
The song is most associated with Mathis despite various recordings by artists such as Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, and Sarah Vaughan.

===Ray Stevens===

In 1975, Ray Stevens released an up-tempo country rendition of this song.  Stevens recounted that is was recorded on the second take when experimenting in the studio, and won a Grammy for arrangement.[tpl]YouTube|0wyAdBVTCjU|Ray Stevens - About "Misty" and Live Performance[/tpl]
