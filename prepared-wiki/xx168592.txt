==Planetary system==

This star has one extrasolar planet WASP-2b, detected by the SuperWASP project in 2006.

==Binary star==

In 2008 a study was undertaken of fourteen stars with exoplanets that were originally discovered using the transit method through relatively small telescopes. These systems were re-examined with the [tpl]convert|2.2|m|in|abbr=on[/tpl] reflector telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain. This star system, along with two others, was determined to be a previously unknown binary star system. The previously unknown secondary star is a dim magnitude 15 M-type star separated by about 111 AU from the primary, appearing offset from the primary by about one arc second in the images. This discovery resulted in a recalculation of parameters for both the planet and the primary star.
