[tpl]nihongo|Monuments|記念物|kinenbutsu[/tpl] is a collective term used by the Japanese government's Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties to denote Cultural Properties of JapanIn this article, capitals indicate an official designation as opposed to a simple definition, e.g "Cultural Properties" as opposed to "cultural properties". as historic locations such as shell mounds, ancient tombs, sites of palaces, sites of forts or castles, monumental dwelling houses and other sites of high historical or scientific value; gardens, bridges, gorges, mountains, and other places of great scenic beauty; and natural features such as animals, plants, and geological or mineral formations of high scientific value.

==Designated Monuments of Japan==

The government designates (as opposed to registers: see  Registered Monuments below) "significant" items of this kind as Cultural Properties and classifies them in one of three categories:
Items of particularly high significance may receive a higher classification as: 
As of September 2013, there were 3,089 nationally-designated Monuments: 1,710 Historic Sites (including 61 Special Historic Sites), 374 Places of Scenic Beauty (including 36 Special Places of Scenic Beauty), and 1,005 Natural Monuments (including 75 Special Natural Monuments).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/shoukai/shitei.html |title=史跡名勝天然記念物 |trans_title=Count of Monuments of Japan by Prefecture |language=Japanese |publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs |date=1 September 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013[/tpl] Since a single property can be included within more than one of these classes, the total number of properties is less than the sum of designations: for example Hamarikyu Gardens are both a Special Historic Site and a Special Place of Scenic Beauty.
As of 1 May 2013, there were a further 2,961 Historic Sites, 266 Places of Scenic Beauty, and 2,985 Natural Monuments designated at a prefectural level and 12,840 Historic Sites, 845 Places of Scenic Beauty, and 11,020 Natural Monuments designated at a municipal level.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/shiteibunkazai/todoufuken.html |title=都道府県別指定等文化財件数（都道府県分）|trans_title=Count of Prefectural Cultural Properties by Prefecture |language=Japanese |publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs |accessdate=21 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/shiteibunkazai/sichouson.html |title=都道府県別指定等文化財件数（市町村分）|trans_title=Count of Municipal Cultural Properties by Prefecture |language=Japanese |publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs |accessdate=21 September 2013[/tpl]

==Registered Monuments==

A separate system of registration has been established for modern edifices threatened by urban sprawl or other factors. Monuments from the Meiji period onward which require preservation can be registered as [tpl]nihongo|Registered Monuments|登録記念物[/tpl]. Members of this class of Cultural Property receive more limited assistance and protection based mostly on governmental notification and guidance. As of April 2012, 61 monuments were registered under this system.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/bunkazai/shoukai/pdf/touroku_201204_05.pdf |title=登録文化財 |trans_title=Registered Cultural Properties |language=Japanese |publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs |accessdate=20 April 2012[/tpl]
