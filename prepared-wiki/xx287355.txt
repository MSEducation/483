If a citizen wanted to report a crime, they went to the press, not to law enforcement; people who wanted to voice their political opposition sent their work for publication to newspapers, not to the Guatemalan government. By 1985, when Guatemala readopted its constitutional rule, press freedom began to improve.[tpl]cite web|last=Smeets|title=Speaking Out: Postwar Journalism in Guatemala and El Salvador|url=http://cpj.org/reports/1999/08/guatemala11august99.php|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|accessdate=2 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6LYb4CPqq|archivedate=2 December 2013|date=11 August 1999[/tpl] When a peace treaty was signed in 1996, the atmosphere improved for journalists in Guatemala and the killings of media workers dropped significantly.[tpl]sfn|Rockwell|2003|p=176[/tpl] However, attacks against the press and targeted killings continued under the form of organized crime.[tpl]sfn|Shea|2001|p=66[/tpl] 
The end of the civil war made the Guatemalan press "free" in several aspects; newspapers began to publish articles about government corruption, a topic that was frequently avoided during the war-time era, in increasing numbers. Despite these improvements, journalists in Guatemala learned to adopt a culture of self-censorship that dates back to the civil war.[tpl]cite book|last=O'Kane|first=Trish|title=Guatemala in Focus: A Guide to the People, Politics and Culture|year=1999|publisher=Interlink Books|isbn=1566562422|page=52|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=c6heMlMW-aoC&pg=PA52&dq=guatemala+media+censorship&hl=en&sa=X&ei=kgScUsjAPMyNkAf43IEw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=guatemala%20media%20censorship&f=false[/tpl] Negative attitudes from the government towards the Guatemalan press continue to exist, and the press lacks the economic independence to break away from the government and its advertisements and become fully autonomous.[tpl]sfn|Shea|2001|p=68[/tpl] Most of the media outlets in the country are centered in Guatemala City, the capital.[tpl]sfn|Shea|2001|p=65[/tpl] Journalists who work in the capital have better working conditions and are better protected from attacks than those living in the provinces,[tpl]cite web|title=Attacks on the Press 2001: Guatemala|url=http://cpj.org/2002/03/attacks-on-the-press-2001-guatemala.php|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|accessdate=2 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6LYbLhN3G|archivedate=2 December 2013|deadurl=no|date=26 March 2002[/tpl] where they are easily pressured by local officials for their direct reporting.[tpl]cite web|title=Attacks on the Press 2004: Guatemala|url=http://cpj.org/2005/03/attacks-on-the-press-2004-guatemala.php|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|accessdate=2 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6LYbTFJpS|archivedate=2 December 2013|deadurl=no|date=2004[/tpl] Since the mid-2000s, drug-related violence and the presence of Mexican organized crime, in particular of Los Zetas, has increased the number of homicides in Guatemala and attacks against the press.[tpl]cite web|last=Lauría|first=Carlos|title=Drug Trade, Violent Gangs Pose Grave Danger|url=http://cpj.org/2009/02/drugs-violence-press-latin-america.php|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|accessdate=2 December 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6LYc4Prt8|archivedate=2 December 2013|deadurl=no|date=2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Abbot|first=Thomas|title=Violence against journalists in Guatemala spikes again|url=http://www.coha.org/violence-against-journalists-in-guatemala-spikes-again/|publisher=Council on Hemispheric Affairs|accessdate=2 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202050550/http://www.coha.org/violence-against-journalists-in-guatemala-spikes-again/|archivedate=2 December 2013|deadurl=no|date=4 September 2013[/tpl]
