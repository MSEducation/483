Jewell railway station is located on the Upfield line in Victoria, Australia. It serves the northern Melbourne suburb of Brunswick opening on 9 September 1884 as South Brunswick, being renamed Jewell on 1 February 1954 after a long-serving member of the State Parliament, James Robert Jewell, who represented the Brunswick electorate from 1910 to 1949.Jewell Vicsig[tpl]cite web|title=Jewell, James Robert|url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/re-member/bioregfull.cfm?mid=1556|work=Re-Member (former members)|publisher=Parliament of Victoria|accessdate=2013-02-18[/tpl] Jewell is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.Jewell Signal Box, Gates & Station Department of the Environment

In June 2012, VicTrack announced its intention to revamp the station as part of a mixed development that could include station restoration, enhanced open space, and a new commercial and residential development adjacent on the eastern side. A program of community consultation was undertaken to find out local people's priorities for any alterations. Safety and better access were identified the main concerns. VicTrack is to seek interest from developers in 2013.[tpl]cite news|last=Merrett|first=Melissa|title=Commuters want Brunswick's Jewell to shine|url=http://moreland-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/commuters-want-brunswicks-jewell-to-shine/|accessdate=2013-02-18|newspaper=Moreland Leader|date=2012-12-04[/tpl]
