Widden was originally formed as a club for ex-pupils of Widden School, the school closed many years ago but Widden continue to use the Old Boys tag to this day and no longer rely on ex pupils to boost the playing numbers but a thriving and successful youth section.
Widden moved to their current home at the Memorial Ground on Tuffley Avenue in 1958 and they share this ground with fierce rivals Old Cryptians RFC.
Widden are renowned as not only one of Gloucester's most successful rugby clubs, but also as one of its friendliest, making a point of striving for success on the field as well as off it on the social side.

In 1999 Widden were forced out of the league structure and were very close to closure. However thanks to tremendous efforts from club stalwarts and the clubs superb youth system closure was avoided. Subsequently Widden were led to 4 promotions in 7 seasons by club captains Stuart Dobson, Nick Taylor, Dave Connors, James Cooke, Gareth Evans and current captain Chris Godsell (Jamaica Exiles)
