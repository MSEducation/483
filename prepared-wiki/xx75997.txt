Swebus takes passengers to the city of Borås in 25 minutes, and in 30 minutes to Borås Central station.
The road distance to Gothenburg is [tpl]convert|25|km|mi[/tpl] and to Borås [tpl]convert|40|km[/tpl], both via the Riksväg 40 motorway. To go northeast to Alingsås and beyond, the official route is via Partille. Most locals use a [tpl]convert|15|km|mi[/tpl] shorter shortcut between Härryda and Lerum signposted "Härskogen". It is very poorly signposted since the road authority wants to avoid too much traffic on this very narrow and curvy road.
There are 7,300 parking spaces at the airport.
There are plans to build a shortcut on the railway Gothenburg–Borås with a tunnel and a railway station under the airport. Construction start is planned to be 2016 and operation estimated by 2019.
