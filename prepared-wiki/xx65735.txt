Crișul Repede (Romanian Crișul Repede; Hungarian Sebes-Körös) is a river in Bihor county, Crișana, Romania and in southeastern Hungary (Körösvidek). Together with the rivers Crișul Alb (White Criș) and Crișul Negru (Black Criș), it makes up the Three Criș rivers ("Cele Trei Crișuri"). These are considered the main rivers in the Crișana region of Romania. Historically, when Crișana was recognised as an official region (today, Romania is divided into 40 counties), the Criș rivers were the most important rivers of the region.
The Crișul Repede river runs through the city of Oradea, the capital of Bihor county. It flows into the Körös (Criș) river near Gyomaendrőd, in Hungary.
