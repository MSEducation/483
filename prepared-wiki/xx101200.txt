Curtis completed a Bachelor of Arts in Human Sciences at Mansfield College, Oxford, which included courses in genetics, evolutionary biology, psychology, politics, anthropology and statistics. He started a PhD, during which he tutored in Politics, but while on the course became disillusioned with academia.
He applied to the BBC, and was hired to make a film for one of the BBC training courses, comparing designer clothes in pop music videos to the design of weapons. He subsequently obtained a post on That's Life!, a programme that often placed serious and humorous content in close juxtaposition.

==Politics==

Of his general political outlook, Curtis has said:  People often accuse me of being a lefty. That's complete rubbish. If you look at The Century of the Self, what I'm arguing is something very close to a neo-conservative position because I'm saying that, with the rise of individualism, you tend to get the corrosion of the other idea of social bonds and communal networks, because everyone is on their own. Well, that's what the neo-conservatives argue, domestically...If you ask me what my politics are, I'm very much a creature of my time. I don't really have any. I change my mind over different issues, but I am much more fond of a libertarian view. I have a more libertarian tendency... 

==Films==

Curtis cites John Dos Passos' USA Trilogy, which he first read aged 13, as the greatest influence on his film making. You can trace back everything I do to that novel because it's all about grand history, individual experience, their relationship. And also collages, quotes from newsreels, cinema, newspapers. And it's about collage of history as well. That's where I get it all from. 
Other influences include Robert Rauschenberg, Émile Zola, and Max Weber[tpl]cite web|title=Hans Ulrich Obrist in Conversation with Adam Curtis|url=http://www.e-flux.com/journal/in-conversation-with-adam-curtis-part-i/|publisher=e-flux|accessdate=8 February 2013[/tpl]
Curtis makes extensive use of archive footage in his documentaries. He has acknowledged the influence of recordings made by Erik Durschmied and to "constantly using his stuff in my films".BBC – Adam Curtis Blog: GOODIES AND BADDIES An Observer profile said of Curtis' style:  Curtis has a remarkable feel for the serendipity of such moments, and an obsessive skill in locating them. "That kind of footage shows just how dull I can be," he admits, a little glumly. "The BBC has an archive of all these tapes where they have just dumped all the news items they have ever shown. One tape for every three months. So what you get is this odd collage, an accidental treasure trove. You sit in a darkened room, watch all these little news moments, and look for connections."[tpl]cite news| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2004/oct/24/features.review7| title = The Exorcist| author = Adams, Tim| date = 24 October 2004| accessdate = 17 February 2010| publisher = The Observer | location=London[/tpl] 
The Observer adds "if there has been a theme in Curtis's work since, it has been to look at how different elites have tried to impose an ideology on their times, and the tragicomic consequences of those attempts."
