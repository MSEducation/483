Mary Harris "Mother" Jones (1837[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aflcio.org/About/Our-History/Key-People-in-Labor-History/Mother-Jones-1837-1930|title=Mother Jones (1837–1930)|accessdate=30 November 2012|quote=|publisher=AFL-CIO[/tpl] – 30 November 1930) was an Irish-American schoolteacher and dressmaker who became a prominent labor and community organizer. She then helped coordinate major strikes and cofounded the Industrial Workers of the World.
Jones worked as a teacher and dressmaker, but after her husband and four children all died of yellow fever and her workshop was destroyed in a fire in 1871, she began working as an organizer for the Knights of Labor and the United Mine Workers union. From 1897, at around 60 years of age, she was known as Mother Jones. In 1902 she was called "the most dangerous woman in America" for her success in organizing mine workers and their families against the mine owners. In 1903, upset about the lax enforcement of the child labor laws in the Pennsylvania mines and silk mills, she organized a Children's March from Philadelphia to the home of then president Theodore Roosevelt in New York. Mother Jones magazine, established in 1970, is named for her.

==Background==

Mary Harris was born on the north side of Cork City, Ireland, the daughter of Roman Catholic tenant farmers Richard Harris and Ellen (née Cotter) Harris.Day by Day in Cork, Sean Beecher, Collins Press, Cork, 1992 She was baptized on 1 August 1837, which indicates she most likely was born in late July.[tpl]cite web|url=http://motherjonescork.com/about|title=Mary Harris Jones|accessdate=30 November 2012|quote=... This plaque will be erected near the famous Cork Butter Market and will be unveiled on 1st August 2012 which is the 175th Anniversary of her baptism in the North Cathedral Mary's Cathedral (we have not been able to ascertain her actual date of birth but it would most likely have been a few days before this date). Her parents were Ellen Cotter, a native of Inchigeela and Richard Harris from Cork city. Few details of her early life in Cork have been uncovered to date, though it is thought by some that she was born on Blarney Street and may have attended the North Presentation Schools nearby. She and her family emigrated to Canada soon after the Famine, probably in the early 1850s. ...|publisher=Mother Jones Commemorative committee[/tpl] Recent materials list her baptism as 1 August 1837, although she later claimed her birth date to be 1 May 1830. The date of 1 May was chosen to represent the national labor holiday and anniversary of the Haymarket affair, and the year (1830) to imply centenarian status.

==Formative years==

Mary Harris emigrated with her family to Canada as a teenager.Arnesen, Eric. "A Tarnished Icon", Reviews in American History 30, no. 1 (2002): 89 She received a Catholic education in Toronto before her family moved to the United States. She became a teacher in a convent in Monroe, Michigan. After tiring of her assumed profession, she moved first to Chicago and later to Memphis, where she married George E. Jones, a member and organizer of the National Union of Iron Moulders,Religion and Radical Politics: An Alternative Christian Tradition in the United States, Robert H. Craig, Temple University Press, Philadelphia, 1992 later the International Molders and Foundry Workers Union of North America, in 1861.Russell E. Smith, "March of the Mill Children", The Social Service Review 41, no. 3 (1967): 299 She eventually opened a dress shop in Memphis on the eve of the Civil War.
There were two turning points in her life. The first, and most tragic one, was the loss of her husband George and their four children (all under the age of five) during a yellow fever epidemic in Memphis, Tennessee. After her entire family succumbed to the disease, she returned to Chicago to begin another dressmaking business.Ric Arnesen, "A Tarnished Icon", Reviews in American History 30, no. 1 (2002): 89 Then, four years later, she lost her hard-earned home, shop and possessions in the Great Chicago Fire. This second loss catalyzed an even more fundamental transformation: she turned to the nascent labor movement and joined the Knights of Labor, a predecessor to the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or "Wobblies").Mother Jones: The Most Dangerous Woman in America by Elliott Gorn The Haymarket Riot of 1886 and the fear of anarchism and revolution incited by union organizations led to the rapid demise of the Knights of Labor. Once the Knights ceased to exist, Mary Jones became largely affiliated with the United Mine Workers. With the UMW, she frequently led strikers in picketing and encouraged the striking workers to stay on strike when the management brought in strike-breakers and militias. She strongly believed that "working men deserved a wage that would allow women to stay home to care for their kids."Dreher, Rod (5 June 2006) All-American Anarchists, The American Conservative
As another source of her transformation into an organizer, biographer Elliott Gorn draws out her early Roman Catholic connection, bringing to light her relationship to her brother, Father William Richard Harris, Roman Catholic teacher, writer, pastor, and Dean of the Niagara Peninsula (in St. Catharines) in the Diocese of Toronto, who was "among the best-known clerics in Ontario", but from whom she was reportedly estranged. Her political views may have been strongly shaped by the 1877 railroad strike, Chicago's labor movement, and the Haymarket Riot and depression of 1886.
Active as an organizer and educator in strikes throughout the country at the time, she was particularly involved with the UMW and the Socialist Party of America. As a union organizer, she gained prominence for organizing the wives and children of striking workers in demonstrations on their behalf. She became known as "the most dangerous woman in America", a phrase coined by a West Virginia district attorney, Reese Blizzard, in 1902, at her trial for ignoring an  injunction banning meetings by striking miners. "There sits the most dangerous woman in America",  announced Blizzard. "She comes into a state where peace and prosperity reign ... crooks her finger and twenty thousand contented men lay down their tools and walk out."[tpl]cite book|author1=Sandra L.

Jones was ideologically separated from many of the other female activists of the pre-Nineteenth Amendment days due to her strong opposition to abortion and outspoken aversion to female suffrage. She was quoted as saying that "You don't need the vote to raise hell!"Russell E. Smith, "March of the Mill Children", The Social Service Review 41, no. 3 (1967): 298 Her opposition to women taking an active role in politics was based on her belief that the neglect of motherhood was a primary cause of juvenile delinquency. She became known as a charismatic and effective speaker throughout her career.Mari Boor Tonn, "Militant Motherhood: Labor's Mary Harris 'Mother' Jones", Quarterly Journal of Speech 81, no. 1 (1996): 2 A passionate public speaker, she would liven her rhetoric with real and folk-tale characters, punctuate with participation from audience members, flavor it with passion, and include humor-ridden methods to rile up the crowd such as profanity, name-calling, and wit. Occasionally she would include props, visual aids, and dramatic stunts for effect.
By age 60, she had effectively assumed the persona of "Mother Jones" by claiming to be older than she actually was, wearing outdated black dresses and referring to the male workers that she supported as "her boys". The first reference to her in print as Mother Jones was in 1897.

=="Children's Crusade"==

In 1901, workers in Pennsylvania's silk mills went on strike, many being young female workers demanding to be paid adult wages.Bonnie Stepenoff, "Keeping it in the Family: Mother Jones and the Pennsylvania Silk Strike of 1900–1901”, Labor History 38, no. 4 (1997): 446 John Mitchell, the president of the UMWA, brought Mother Jones to north-east Pennsylvania in the months of February and September to encourage unity among the striking workers. To do so, she encouraged the wives of the workers to organize into a militia, who in turn would wield brooms, beat on tin pans and shout “Join the union!” She held that wives had an important role to play as the nurturers and motivators of the striking men, but not as fellow workers. She made claim that the young girls working in the mills were being robbed and demoralized.
To enforce worker solidarity, she travelled to the silk mills in New Jersey and returned to Pennsylvania to report that the conditions she observed were far superior. She stated that “the child labor law is better enforced for one thing and there are more men at work than seen in the mills here.” In response to the strike, mill owners also divulged their side of the story. They claimed that if the workers still insisted on a wage scale, they would not be able to do business while paying adult wages and would be  forced to close down.Bonnie Stepenoff, "Keeping it in the Family: Mother Jones and the  Pennsylvania Silk Strike of 1900–1901”, Labor History 38, no. 4 (1997): 448 Even Jones herself encouraged the workers to accept a settlement. Although she agreed upon a settlement which sent the young girls back to the mills, she continued to fight child labor for the remainder of her life.
In 1903 Jones organized children, who were working in mills and mines at the time, to participate in the "Children's Crusade", a march from Kensington, Philadelphia to Oyster Bay, New York, the hometown of President Theodore Roosevelt with banners demanding "We want to go to School and not the mines!" [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
As Mother Jones noted that many of the children at union headquarters had missing fingers and other disabilities, she attempted to get newspaper publicity about the conditions in Pennsylvania regarding child labor. However, the mill owners held stock in essentially all of the newspapers. When the newspaper men informed her that they could not advertise the facts about child labor because of this, she remarked “Well, I've got stock in these little children and I'll arrange a little publicity.” Russell E. Smith, "March of the Mill Children", The Social Service Review 41, no. 3 (1967):  300 Permission to see President Roosevelt was denied by his secretary and it was suggested that Jones address a letter to the president requesting a visit with him. Even though Mother Jones wrote a letter for such permission, she never received an answer.Russell E. Smith, "March of the Mill Children", The Social Service Review 41, no. 3 (1967): 303 Though the President refused to meet with the marchers, the incident brought the issue of child labor to the forefront of the public agenda. Jones's Children's Crusade was described in detail in the 2003 non-fiction book, Kids on Strike!.
In the Paint Creek-Cabin Creek strike of 1912 in West Virginia, Mary Jones arrived in June 1912, speaking and organizing through a shooting war between United Mine Workers members and the private army of the mine owners. Martial law in the area was declared and rescinded twice before Jones was arrested on 13 February 1913, brought before a military court. Accused of conspiring to commit murder among other charges, she refused to recognize the legitimacy of her court martial. She was sentenced to twenty years in the state penitentiary. During house arrest at Mrs. Carney's Boarding House, she acquired a dangerous case of pneumonia. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
After 85 days of confinement, her release coincided with Indiana Senator John Worth Kern initiating a Senate investigation into the conditions in the local coal mines. Mary Lee Settle paints an accurate and compelling portrait of Jones at this time in her novel The Scapegoat (1978). Several months later she was in Colorado, helping organize coal miners. Once again she was arrested, served some time in prison and was escorted from the state in the months leading up to the Ludlow Massacre. After the massacre she was invited to Standard Oil's headquarters at 26 Broadway to meet face-to-face with John D. Rockefeller, Jr., a meeting that prompted Rockefeller to visit the Colorado mines and introduce long-sought reforms. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]

==Later years==

By 1924, Jones was in court again, this time facing charges of libel, slander and sedition. In 1925, Charles A. Albert, publisher of the fledgling Chicago Times, won a $350,000 judgment against Jones. Jones remained a union organizer for the UMW into the  1920s and continued to speak on union affairs almost until her death. She released her own account of her experiences in the labor movement as The Autobiography of Mother Jones (1925). In her later years, Jones lived with her friends Walter and Lillie May Burgess on their farm in what is now Adelphi, Maryland. She celebrated her self-proclaimed 100th birthday there on 1 May   1930, and was filmed making a statement for a newsreel. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
