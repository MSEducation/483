This article deals with the armed forces of Honduras.

==History==

===pre-1979===

During the twentieth century, Honduran military leaders frequently became presidents, either through elections or by coups d'état. General Tiburcio Carías Andino was elected in 1932, he later on called a constituent assembly that allowed him to be reelected, and his rule became more authoritarian until an election in 1948. During the following decades, the military of Honduras carried out several coups d'état, starting in October 1955. General Oswaldo López Arellano carried out the next coup in October 1963 and a second in December 1972, followed by coups in 1975 by Juan Alberto Melgar Castro and in 1978 by Policarpo Paz García.

===1980s===

Events during the 1980s in El Salvador and Nicaragua led Honduras — with US assistance — to expand its armed forces considerably, laying particular emphasis on its air force, which came to include a squadron of US-provided F-5s. 
The military unit Battalion 316 carried out political assassinations and the torture of suspected political opponents of the government during this same period. Battalion members received training and support from the United States Central Intelligence Agency, in Honduras, at U.S. military bases[tpl]cite news | first=Gary | last=Cohn | coauthors=Ginger Thompson | pages= | language =| title=When a wave of torture and murder staggered a small U.S. ally, truth was a casualty | date=1995-06-11 | publisher=Baltimore Sun | url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-negroponte1a,0,294534.story |accessdate=2009-07-27 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5iZNHFhbk |archivedate=2009-07-26 [/tpl] and in Chile during the presidency of the dictator Augusto Pinochet.Equipo Nizkor, LA APARICION DE OSAMENTAS EN UNA ANTIGUA BASE MILITAR DE LA CIA EN HONDURAS REABRE LA PARTICIPACION ARGENTINO-NORTEAMERICANA EN ESE PAIS., Margen [tpl]es icon[/tpl] Amnesty International estimated that at least 184 people were "disappeared" during from 1980 to 1992 in Honduras, most likely by the Honduran military.[tpl]cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Honduras: Still waiting for justice| work =| publisher =Amnesty International| year =1998| url =http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AMR37/004/1998/en/667ec8d1-daba-11dd-80bc-797022e51902/amr370041998en.html | doi =| accessdate =2009-07-27 |archiveurl= |archivedate= [/tpl]

===1990s===

The resolution of the civil wars in El Salvador and Nicaragua, and across-the-board budget cuts made in all ministries, has brought reduced funding for the Honduran armed forces. The abolition of the draft has created staffing gaps in the now all-volunteer armed forces. The military is now far below its authorized strength, and further reductions are expected. In January 1999, the Constitution was amended to abolish the position of military commander-in-chief of the armed forces, thus codifying civilian authority over the military.

===2000s===

Since 2002, soldiers have been involved in crime prevention and law enforcement, patrolling the streets of the major cities alongside the national police.

====2009====

On 28 June 2009, in the context of a constitutional crisis, the military, acting on orders of the Supreme Court of Justice, arrested the president, Manuel Zelaya after which they forcibly removed elected President Zelaya from Honduras. See the article 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis regarding claims regarding legitimacy and illegitimacy of the event, and events preceding and following the removal of Zelaya from Honduras.
The military's chief lawyer, Colonel Herberth Bayardo Inestroza Membreño, made public statements regarding the removal of Zelaya. On June 30, he showed a detention order, apparently signed June 26 by a Supreme Court judge, which ordered the armed forces to detain the president.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/02/world/americas/02coup.html | title=Leader’s Ouster Not a Coup, Says the Honduran Military|publisher=The New York Times|date=July 1, 2009|last=Lacy|first=Marc|accessdate=July 3, 2009[/tpl] Colonel Inestroza later stated that deporting Zelaya did not comply with the court order: "In the moment that we took him out of the country, in the way that he was taken out, there is a crime. Because of the circumstances of the moment this crime occurred, there is going to be a justification and cause for acquittal that will protect us."English summary of interview with the legal counsel of the Honduras armed forces, Colonel Herberth Bayardo Inestroza, [tpl]cite news | first=Frances | last=Robles | pages= | language =| title=Top Honduran military lawyer: We broke the law | date=2009-07-03 | publisher=Miami Herald | url=http://www.miamiherald.com/1506/story/1125872.html |accessdate=2009-09-06 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jb00TM3J |archivedate=2009-09-06 |deadurl=no[/tpl]; original [tpl]es[/tpl] [tpl]cite web| last =Dada | first =Carlos| authorlink =| coauthors =José Luis Sanz| title =Cometimos un delito al sacar a Zelaya, pero había que hacerlo (| work =| publisher =El Faro.net, El Salvador| date =2009-07-02| url =http://www.elfaro.net/secciones/Noticias/20090629/noticias16_20090629.asp |format =| doi =| accessdate =2009-09-06 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jayZVstj |archivedate=2009-09-06 |deadurl=no[/tpl] He said the decision was taken by the military leadership "in order to avoid bloodshed".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/prontus_nots/site/artic/20090703/pags/20090703161258.html|title=Ejército de Honduras reconoció que cometió un delito al sacar a Zelaya|work=www.cooperativa.cl|publisher=Compañía Chilena de Comunicaciones S.A.|language=Spanish|accessdate=2009-07-05[/tpl]

====Human rights violations during 2009====

Following the 2009 ouster of the president, the Honduran military together with other government security forces were allegedly responsible for thousands of allegedly arbitrary detentions[tpl]cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Preliminary Observations on the IACHR Visit to Honduras| work =| publisher =Inter-American Court of Human Rights| date =2009-08-21| url =http://www.cidh.oas.org/Comunicados/English/2009/60-09eng.Preliminary.Observations.htm | doi =| accessdate =2009-08-26 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jIo4ig3F |archivedate=2009-08-25 |deadurl=no[/tpl] and for several forced disappearances and extrajudicial executions of opponents to the de facto government, including members of the Democratic Unification Party. However, evidence about these actions has yet to be provided and there has been some questioning in local media about the actual perpetrators, suggesting that they could actually be related to disputes within the leftists organizations themselves.

==Military-civilian relations and leadership==

According to a statement in July 2009 by a legal counsel of the Honduras military, Colonel Herberth Bayardo Inestroza, part of the elite Honduran military generals were opposed to President Manuel Zelaya, whom the military had removed from Honduras via a military Coup d'état, because of his left-wing politics. Inestroza stated, "It would be difficult for us military, with our training, to have a relationship with a leftist government. That's impossible."
The current head of the armed forces is Carlos Antonio Cuéllar, graduate of the General Francisco Morazan Military Academy and the School of the Americas. In January 2011, the General Rene Arnoldo Osorio Canales former head of the Presidential Honor Guard, was appointed Commander.
As of 2012 the Honduran Military has the highest  military expenditures of all Central America.
