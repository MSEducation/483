[[Mount Friesland]]

CATEGORIES: Tangra Mountains

Mount Friesland is a mountain in the Tangra Mountains of Livingston Island, in the South Shetland Islands. It is situated [tpl]convert|12.5|km[/tpl] northeast of Barnard Point, [tpl]convert|9.7|km[/tpl] east-southeast of St. Kliment Ohridski Base, [tpl]convert|3.6|km[/tpl] southeast of the summit of Pliska Ridge, [tpl]convert|6.1|km[/tpl] south by east of Mount Bowles, [tpl]convert|2.9|km[/tpl] south-southwest of Camp Academia, [tpl]convert|7|km[/tpl] west of Great Needle Peak, and [tpl]convert|6.85|km[/tpl] north by west of Samuel Point. The peak is heavily glaciated and crevassed.
The feature was known to American and British sealers as early as 1820–21, and has been variously known as "Peak of Frezeland", "Friezland Peak", and "Friesland Peak". In the early 1900s the name "Barnard", applied by James Weddell in 1825 to nearby Needle Peak, was transferred to this mountain. The original name has now been restored; the spelling "Friesland" appears to have been more frequently used than any of the other versions.  The name Barnard Point has since been approved for the nearby point at the southeast side of False Bay.
The first ascent of Mount Friesland was made from Juan Carlos I Base on 30 December 1991 by the Catalan climbers Francesc Sàbat and Jorge Enrique, after whom Sàbat Hill and Enrique Hill, respectively, were named. The peak was climbed and GPS surveyed by the Australians Damien Gildea and John Bath and the Chilean Rodrigo Fica on 20 December 2003; they produced a new map of the island in 2004, based on Spanish satellite imagery and their GPS data. The third ascent was made by the Bulgarians Lyubomir Ivanov and Doychin Vasilev from Camp Academia on 15 December 2004. All these used the eastern route to the peak, by way of Catalunyan Saddle and Presian Ridge.
