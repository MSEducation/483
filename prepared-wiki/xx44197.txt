==Name==

The name Pan originally stood for Pimp-ass newsreader.  As Pan became an increasingly popular and polished application, the full name was perceived to be unprofessional and in poor taste, so references to it have been removed from the program and its website.[tpl]cite web |last=Horkan |first=Alan |title=Alan Horkan Says |work=maemo applications |publisher=svenfoo (Sven Neumann) |date=2005-06-24 |url=http://svenfoo.geekheim.de/2005/06/17/maemo-applications/#comment-88 |accessdate=2011-01-25[/tpl]
