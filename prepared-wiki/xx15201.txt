Magnesium and calcium are very common in the earth's crust, with calcium the fifth-most-abundant element, and magnesium the eighth. None of the alkaline earth metals are found in their elemental state, but magnesium and calcium are found in many rocks and minerals: magnesium in carnellite, magnesite, and dolomite; and calcium in chalk, limestone, gypsum, and anhydrite.
Strontium is the fifteenth-most-abundant element in the Earth's crust. Most strontium is found in the minerals celestite and strontianite.[tpl]cite web|publisher = United States Geological Survey |accessdate = 2010-05-14|title = Mineral Commodity Summaries 2010: Strontium |first = Joyce A. |last = Ober |url =http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/strontium/mcs-2010-stron.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl] Barium is slightly less common, much of it in the mineral barite.[tpl]cite book|author=Kresse, Robert; Baudis, Ulrich; Jäger, Paul; Riechers, H.

==Production==

Most beryllium is extracted from beryllium hydroxide. One production method is sintering, done by mixing beryl, sodium fluorosilicate, and soda at high temperatures to form sodium fluoroberyllate, aluminium oxide, and silicon dioxide. A solution of sodium fluoroberyllate and sodium hydroxide in water is then used to form beryllium hydroxide by precipitation. Alternatively, in the melt method, powdered beryl is heated to high temperature, cooled with water, then heated again slightly in sulfuric acid, eventually yielding beryllium hydroxide. The beryllium hydroxide from either method then produces beryllium fluoride and beryllium chloride through a somewhat long process. Electrolysis or heating of these compounds can then produce beryllium.
In general, strontium carbonate is extracted from the mineral celestite through two methods: by leaching the celestite with sodium carbonate, or in a more complicated way involving coal.[tpl]cite book | url = http://books.google.de/books?id=5smDPzkw0wEC&pg=PA401 | title = Production of SrCO, by black ash process: Determination of reductive roasting parameters| pages = 401 | isbn = 9789054108290 | author1 = Kemal | first1 = Mevlüt | last2 = Arslan | first2 = V| last3 = Akar | first3 = A | last4 = Canbazoglu | first4 = M | year = 1996[/tpl]
To produce barium, barite ore is separated from quartz, sometimes by froth flotation methods, resulting in relatively pure barite. Carbon is then used to reduce the baryte into barium sulfide, which is dissolved with other elements to form other compounds, such as barium nitrate. These in turn are thermally decompressed into barium oxide, which eventually yields pure barium after a reaction with aluminium. The most important supplier of barium is China, which produces more than 50% of world supply.[tpl]cite web|author=Miller, M.

==Applications==

Beryllium is used mostly for military applications,[tpl]cite doi|10.1002/14356007.a04_011.pub2[/tpl] but there are other uses of beryllium, as well.

Magnesium has many different uses. One of its most common uses was in industry, where it has many structural advantages over other materials such as aluminium, although this usage has fallen out of favor recently due to magnesium's flammability.[tpl]cite book|last=Gray|first=Theodore|authorlink=Theodore Gray|title=The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe|year=2009|publisher=Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-1-57912-814-2[/tpl] Magnesium is also often alloyed with aluminium or zinc to form materials with more desirable properties than any pure metal.[tpl]cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Hugh D.

Calcium also has many uses. One of its uses is as a reducing agent in the separation of other metals from ore, such as uranium. It is also used in the production of the alloys of many metals, such as aluminium and copper alloys, and is also used to deoxidize alloys as well. Calcium also has a role in the making of cheese, mortars, and cement.[tpl]RubberBible86th[/tpl]
Strontium and barium do not have as many applications as the lighter alkaline earth metals, but still have uses.

Due to its radioactivity, radium no longer has many applications, but it used to have many.

==Biological role and precautions==

Magnesium and calcium are ubiquitous and essential to all known living organisms. They are involved in more than one role, with, for example, magnesium or calcium ion pumps playing a role in some cellular processes, magnesium functioning as the active center in some enzymes, and calcium salts taking a structural role, most notably in bones.
Strontium plays an important role in marine aquatic life, especially hard corals, which use strontium to build their exoskeletons. It and barium have some uses in medicine, for example "barium meals" in radiographic imaging, whilst strontium compounds are employed in some toothpastes. Excessive amounts of strontium-90 are toxic due to its radioactivity and strontium-90 mimics calcium and then can kill.
Beryllium and radium, however, are toxic. Beryllium's low aqueous solubility means it is rarely available to biological systems; it has no known role in living organisms and, when encountered by them, is usually highly toxic. Radium has a low availability and is highly radioactive, making it toxic to life.

==Extensions==

The next alkaline earth metal after radium is thought to be element 120, although this may not be true due to relativistic effects. The synthesis of element 120 was first attempted in March 2007, when a team at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna bombarded plutonium-244 with iron-58 ions; however, no atoms were produced, leading to a limit of 400 fb for the cross-section at the energy studied.[tpl]cite journal|journal=Phys. Rev. C|volume=79|page=024603|year=2009|title=Attempt to produce element 120 in the 244Pu+58Fe reaction|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.79.024603|last1=Oganessian|first1=Yu. Ts.|last2=Utyonkov|first2=V.|last3=Lobanov|first3=Yu.|last4=Abdullin|first4=F.|last5=Polyakov|first5=A.|last6=Sagaidak|first6=R.|last7=Shirokovsky|first7=I.|last8=Tsyganov|first8=Yu.|last9=Voinov|first9=A.|displayauthors=9|issue=2|bibcode = 2009PhRvC..79b4603O [/tpl] In April 2007, a team at the GSI attempted to create element 120 by bombarding uranium-238 with nickel-64, although no atoms were detected, leading to a limit of 1.6 pb for the reaction. Synthesis was again attempted at higher sensitivities, although no atoms were detected. Other reactions have been tried, although all have been met with failure.http://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/kollo/Duellmann_FIAS-Kolloquium.pdf
The chemistry of element 120 is predicted to be closer to that of calcium or strontium instead of barium or radium. This is unusual as periodic trends would predict element 120 to be more reactive than barium and radium. This lowered reactivity is due to the expected energies of element 120's valence electrons, increasing element 120's ionization energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii.[tpl]cite web|author=Seaborg, G.
