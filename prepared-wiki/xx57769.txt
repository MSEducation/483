===Etymology===

The lek was named after Alexander the Great,[tpl]cite book|author1=Leslie Alan Dunkling|author2=Adrian Room|title=The Guinness Book of Money|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MbSaAAAAIAAJ|date=1 January 1990|publisher=Guinness Publishing|isbn=978-0-85112-399-8|page=67|quote="...the lek takes its name from the abbreviated name of Alexander the Great, who was associated with this region of Europe..."[/tpl] whose name is often shortened to Leka in Albanian.[tpl]cite book|author=Howard M. Berlin|title=World Monetary Units: An Historical Dictionary, Country By Country|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ytkiAQAAIAAJ|year=2006|publisher=McFarland & Company Incorporated Pub|isbn=978-0-7864-2080-3|page=8|quote="...The current monetary unit, the lek, is derived from the abbreviation of the Albanian spelling of Alexander the Great..."[/tpl] Alexander's portrait appeared on the obverse of the 1 lek coin, while the reverse showed him on his horse. 
The name qindarkë comes from the Albanian qind, meaning one hundred. The word is thus similar in formation to centime, cent, etc.

===Franga===

Between 1926 and 1939 the name Franga was used for Albanian gold currency worth five Albanian Leke for use in international transactions.http://taxfreegold.co.uk/albania.html A similar alternate name Belga was used for units of five Belgian francs.

===First lek===

In 1926, bronze coins were introduced in denominations of 5 and 10 qindar leku, together with nickel ¼, ½ and 1 lek, and silver 1, 2 and 5 franga ar. The obverse of the franga coins depict Amet Zogu. In 1935, bronze 1 and 2 qindar were issued, equal in value to the 5 and 10 qindar leku. This coin series depicted distinct neoclassical motifs.
After the Italian occupation, stainless-steel 0.20, 0.50, 1 and 2 lek and silver 5 and 10 lek were introduced, with the silver coins only issued that year but aluminium-bronze 0.05 and 0.10 lek introduced in 1940. These coins were issued until 1941 and bear the portrait of Italian King Victor Emmanuel III on the obverse and the Italian eagle and fasces  on the reverse.
In 1947, shortly after the communist party took power, older coins were withdrawn from circulation and a new coinage was introduced, consisting of zinc ½, 1, 2 and 5 lekë. This coinage was again minted in 1957 and used until the currency reform of 1965.

In 1988, a third redesign of aluminum 5, 10, 20, 50 qindarka and 1 lek coins were released.
