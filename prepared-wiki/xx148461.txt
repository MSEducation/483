Sun Valley High School is a public high school in Union County, North Carolina.  Sun Valley is part of Union County Public Schools.  It is located between Monroe and Indian Trail.

==History==

Sun Valley was founded in 1961, prior to full racial integration of public schools in North Carolina.  Integration had little effect at Sun Valley due to the predominant percentage of white students in this part of Union County.  Integration of the schools in neighboring Mecklenburg County (the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System) led to white flight to Union County schools, primarily Sun Valley and its feeder elementary schools (Indian Trail, Shiloh, and Wesley Chapel).  Two new high schools have recently been built in the western part of Union County, partially relieving the crowded conditions that had plagued Sun Valley High for many years.

==Sports==

Sun Valley is known for their competitive football program in the Charlotte region.  The Spartans have reached the NCHSAA Playoffs 4 years in a row.  Prior to the 2009 season, Sun Valley was classified as a 3A team.  However, they are now considered a 4A school.

==Alumni==
