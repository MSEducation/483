Yangon ([tpl]MYname|MY=ရန်ကုန်|MLCTS=rankun mrui[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-my|jàɴɡòʊɴ mjo̰|pron[/tpl]; also known as Rangoon, literally: "End of Strife") is a former capital of Burma (Myanmar) and the capital of Yangon Region. Although the military government has officially relocated the capital to Naypyidaw since March 2006,[tpl]Cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4848408.stm | title =Burma's new capital stages parade |publisher=BBC News | date =27 March 2006 | accessdate =3 August 2006[/tpl] Yangon, with a population of over five million, continues to be the country's largest city and the most important commercial centre.
Although Yangon's infrastructure is undeveloped compared to those of other major cities in Southeast Asia, it has the largest number of colonial buildings in the region today.[tpl]Cite news|last=Martin |first=Steven |date=30 March 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3578993.stm |title=Burma maintains bygone buildings |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=22 May 2006[/tpl] While many high-rise residential and commercial buildings have been constructed or renovated throughout downtown and Greater Yangon in the past two decades, most satellite towns that ring the city continue to be deeply impoverished.

==Etymology==

Yangon ([tpl]my|ရန်ကုန်[/tpl]) is a combination of the two words yan ([tpl]my|ရန်[/tpl]) and koun ([tpl]my|ကုန်[/tpl]), which mean "enemies" and "run out of" respectively. It is also translated as "End of Strife". "Rangoon" most likely comes from the British imitation of the pronunciation of "Yangon" in the Rakhine dialect (Arakanese) of Burmese, which is [tpl]IPA|rɔ̀ɴɡʊ́ɴ[/tpl].

==History==

===Early history===

Yangon was founded as Dagon in the early 11th century (circa 1028–1043) by the Mon, who dominated Lower Burma at that time.Founded during the reign of King Pontarika, per [tpl]cite book | title=Legendary History of Burma and Arakan | year=1882 | author=Charles James Forbes Smith-Forbes | publisher=The Government Press | page=20[/tpl]; the king's reign was 1028 to 1043 per [tpl]cite book | last = Harvey| first = G. E.| title = History of Burma: From the Earliest Times to 10 March 1824 | publisher=Frank Cass & Co. Ltd | year = 1925| location = London | page=368[/tpl] Dagon was a small fishing village centred about the Shwedagon Pagoda. In 1755, King Alaungpaya conquered Dagon, renamed it "Yangon", and added settlements around Dagon. The British captured Yangon during the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–26), but returned it to Burmese administration after the war. The city was destroyed by a fire in 1841.[tpl]Cite book| title=Megacity yangon: transformation processes and modern developments | author=Kyaw Kyaw | isbn=3-8258-0042-3 | editor=Frauke Krass, Hartmut Gaese, Mi Mi Kyi | pages=333–334 | publisher=Lit Verlag | location=Berlin | year=2006 [/tpl]

===Colonial Rangoon===

The British seized Yangon and all of Lower Burma in the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852, and subsequently transformed Yangon into the commercial and political hub of British Burma. Yangon is also the place where the British sent Bahadur Shah II, the last Mughal emperor, to live after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Based on the design by army engineer Lt. Alexander Fraser, the British constructed a new city on a grid plan on delta land, bounded to the east by the Pazundaung Creek and to the south and west by the Yangon River. Yangon became the capital of all British Burma after the British had captured Upper Burma in the Third Anglo-Burmese War of 1885. By the 1890s Yangon's increasing population and commerce gave birth to prosperous residential suburbs to the north of Royal Lake (Kandawgyi) and Inya Lake.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/Yangon |title=Yangon Summary Review and Analysis |publisher=Bookrags.com |date=17 October 2005 |accessdate=17 April 2010[/tpl] The British also established hospitals including Rangoon General Hospital and colleges including Rangoon University.
Colonial Yangon, with its spacious parks and lakes and mix of modern buildings and traditional wooden architecture, was known as "the garden city of the East." By the early 20th century, Yangon had public services and infrastructure on par with London.[tpl]Cite book| last=Falconer| first=John et al.| year=2001| title=Burmese Design & Architecture| isbn=962-593-882-6| publisher=Periplus| location=Hong Kong[/tpl]
Before World War II, about 55% of Yangon's population of 500,000 was Indian or South Asian, and only about a third was Bamar (Burman).[tpl]Cite book| title=Indian Communities in Southeast Asia - Some Aspects of Indians in Rangoon| last=Tin Maung Maung Than| publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies| year=1993| pages=585–587| isbn= 9789812304186[/tpl] Karens, the Chinese, the Anglo-Burmese and others made up the rest.
After World War I, Yangon became the epicentre of Burmese independence movement, with leftist Rangoon University students leading the way. Three nationwide strikes against the British Empire in 1920, 1936 and 1938 all began in Yangon. Yangon was under Japanese occupation (1942–45), and incurred heavy damage during World War II. The city was retaken by the Allies in May 1945.
Yangon became the capital of Union of Burma on 4 January 1948 when the country regained independence from the British Empire.

===Contemporary Yangon===

Soon after Burma's independence in 1948, many colonial names of streets and parks were changed to more nationalistic Burmese names. In 1989, the current military junta changed the city's English name to "Yangon", along with many other changes in English transliteration of Burmese names. (The changes have not been accepted by many Burmese who consider the junta unfit to make such changes, nor by many publications, news bureaux including, most notably, the BBC and foreign nations including the United Kingdom and United States.)[tpl]Cite news|author=Who, What, Why? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7013943.stm |title=Should it be Burma or Myanmar? |publisher=BBC News |date=26 September 2007 |accessdate=17 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35910.htm | title=Background Note: Burma | publisher=Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, US Department of State | accessdate=1 January 2009[/tpl]
Since independence, Yangon has expanded outwards. Successive governments have built satellite towns such as Thaketa, North Okkalapa and South Okkalapa in the 1950s to Hlaingthaya, Shwepyitha and South Dagon in the 1980s. Today, Greater Yangon encompasses an area covering nearly [tpl]convert|600|km2[/tpl].
During Ne Win's isolationist rule (1962–88), Yangon's infrastructure deteriorated through poor maintenance and did not keep up with its increasing population. In the 1990s, the current military government's more open market policies attracted domestic and foreign investment, bringing a modicum of modernity to the city's infrastructure. Some inner city residents were forcibly relocated to new satellite towns. Many colonial-period buildings were demolished to make way for high-rise hotels, office buildings, and shopping malls,[tpl]Cite news| title=Beyond Rangoon| url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=5745&page=3| date=1 May 2006| author=Edward Blair| publisher=The Irrawaddy[/tpl] leading the city government to place about 200 notable colonial-period buildings under the Yangon City Heritage List in 1996.[tpl]Cite news| title=Special Report| url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/myanmartimes/no87/New/14.htm| date=4 November 2001[/tpl] Major building programs have resulted in six new bridges and five new highways linking the city to its industrial back country.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes17-333/b006.htm| title=Pioneering FMI City ‘the best in Yangon’| author=Zaw Htet| publisher=The Myanmar Times[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cemm/eng/zt/zmjjqd/jmgxgk/t198979.htm| title=Yangon-Thanlyin Bridge| accessdate=7 September 2008[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=July 2009[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp2001/2-2001/nga.htm | title=Ngamoeyeik Bridge| author=Kyi Kyi Hla| date=1 February 2001[/tpl] Still, much of Yangon remains without basic municipal services such as 24-hour electricity and regular garbage collection.
Yangon has become much more indigenous Burmese in its ethnic make-up since independence. After independence, many South Asians and Anglo-Burmese left. Many more South Asians were forced to leave during the 1960s by Ne Win's xenophobic government. Nevertheless, sizable South Asian and Chinese communities still exist in Yangon. The Anglo-Burmese have effectively disappeared, having left the country or intermarried with other Burmese groups.
Yangon was the centre of major anti-government protests in 1974, 1988 and 2007. The 1988 People Power Uprising resulted in the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands of Burmese civilians, many in Yangoon where hundreds of thousands of people flooded into the streets of the then capital city. The Saffron Revolution saw mass shootings and the use of crematoria in Yangoon by the Burmese government to erase evidence of their crimes against monks, unarmed protesters, journalists and students.Burmese Human Rights Yearbook, 2007, http://www.burmalibrary.org/show.php?cat=1320&lo=d&sl=0
The city's streets saw bloodshed each time as protesters were gunned down by the government.
In May 2008, Cyclone Nargis hit Yangon. While the city had few human casualties, three quarters of Yangon's industrial infrastructure was destroyed or damaged, with losses estimated at US$800 million.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no427/b004.htm | title=Long road back for industrial recovery | date=14 July 2008 | author=Ye Lwin | publisher=The Myanmar Times[/tpl]
In November 2005, the military government designated Naypyidaw, [tpl]convert|320|km|mi|0[/tpl] north of Yangon, as the new administrative capital, and subsequently moved much of the government to the newly developed city. At any rate, Yangon remains the largest city, and the most important commercial centre of Burma.

==Geography==

Yangon is located in Lower Burma (Myanmar) at the convergence of the Yangon and Bago Rivers about 30 km(19 mi) away from the Gulf of Martaban at 16°48' North, 96°09' East (16.8, 96.15). Its standard time zone is UTC/GMT +6:30 hours.

===Climate===

Yangon has a tropical monsoon climate under the Köppen climate classification system.[tpl]cite journal | author=Peel, M. C. and Finlayson, B. L. and McMahon, T. A. | year=2007 | title= Updated world map of the Köppen–Geiger climate classification | journal=Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. | volume=11 | pages=1633–1644 |doi=10.5194/hess-11-1633-2007 | url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007.pdf | issn = 1027-5606[/tpl] The city features a lengthy rainy season from May through October where a substantial amount of rainfall is received; and a dry season from November through April, where little rainfall is seen. It is primarily due to the heavy precipitation received during the rainy season that Yangon falls under the tropical monsoon climate category. During the course of the year, average temperatures show little variance, with average highs ranging from [tpl]convert|29|to|36|C|F[/tpl] and average lows ranging from [tpl]convert|18|to|25|C|F[/tpl].

==Cityscape==

Until the mid-1990s, Yangon remained largely constrained to its traditional peninsula setting between the Bago, Yangon and Hlaing rivers. People moved in, but little of the city moved out. Maps from 1944 show little development north of Inya Lake and areas that are now layered in cement and stacked with houses were then virtual backwaters. Since the late 1980s, however, the city began a rapid spread north to where Yangon International airport now stands. But the result is a stretching tail on the city, with the downtown area well removed from its geographic centre.[tpl]Cite journal| title=The Future of Yangon| url=http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes17-325/b008.htm| date=16 July 2006| author=May Thanda Win| publisher=The Myanmar Times[/tpl] The city's area has steadily increased from [tpl]convert|72.52|km2|sqmi[/tpl] in 1901 to [tpl]convert|86.2|km2|sqmi[/tpl] in 1940 to [tpl]convert|208.51|km2|sqmi[/tpl] in 1974, to [tpl]convert|346.13|km2|sqmi[/tpl] in 1985, and to [tpl]convert|598.75|km2|sqmi[/tpl] in 2008.[tpl]Cite journal| url=http://www.uncrd.or.jp/env/3rd-regional-est-forum/doc/23_Myanmar.pdf| title=Third Regional EST Forum: Presentation of Myanmar| publisher=Ministry of Transport, Myanmar| location=Singapore| date=17–19 March 2008[/tpl][tpl]Cite book| title=Megacity yangon: transformation processes and modern developments | author=Zin Nwe Myint | isbn=3-8258-0042-3 | editor=Frauke Krass, Hartmut Gaese, Mi Mi Kyi | page=264 | publisher=Lit Verlag | location=Berlin | year=2006 [/tpl]

===Architecture===

Downtown Yangon is known for its leafy avenues and fin-de-siècle architecture.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123266507433707833.html | title=Asia's Lost Treasure Trove| author=Tom Wright| date=23 January 2009| work=WSJ Weekend Journal [/tpl] The former British colonial capital has the highest number of colonial period buildings in Southeast Asia. Downtown Yangon is still mainly made up of decaying colonial buildings. The former High Court, the former Secretariat buildings, the former St. Paul's English High School and the Strand Hotel are excellent examples of the bygone era. Most downtown buildings from this era are four-story mix-use (residential and commercial) buildings with [tpl]convert|14|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] ceilings, allowing for the construction of mezzanines. Despite their less-than-perfect conditions, the buildings remain highly sought after and most expensive in the city's property market.[tpl]Cite journal| title=Demand for downtown’s golden oldies still strong| url=http://mmtimes.com/no449/b007.html| date=15 December 2008| publisher=The Myanmar Times| author=Htar Htar Khin[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]
In 1996, the Yangon City Development Committee created a Yangon City Heritage List of old buildings and structures in the city that cannot be modified or torn down without approval.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/colonial-past-could-be-the-saving-of-rangoon-2219991.html|title=Colonial past could be the saving of Rangoon|last=Kennedy|first=Phoebe|date=20 February 2011|work=The Independent |accessdate=10 March 2012[/tpl] In 2012, the city of Yangon imposed a 50-year moratorium on demolition of buildings older than 50 years.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/366b4332-69b5-11e1-8996-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1ohjcvgh1|title=Myanmar pushes to save colonial buildings|last=Robinson|first=Gwen|date=9 March 2012|work=Financial Times|accessdate=10 March 2012[/tpl] The Yangon Heritage Trust, an NGO started by Thant Myint-U, aims to create heritage areas in Downtown, and attract investors to renovate buildings for commercial use.
A latter day hallmark of Yangon is the eight-story apartment building. (In Yangon parlance, a building with no elevators (lifts) is called an apartment building and one with elevators is called a condominium.[tpl]Cite journal| title=City living: condos vs apartments| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/Construction/con13.htm| date=1 September 2007| publisher=The Myanmar Times[/tpl] Condos which have to invest in a local power generator to ensure 24-hour electricity for the elevators are beyond the reach of most Yangonites.) Found throughout the city in various forms, eight-story apartment buildings provide relatively inexpensive housing for many Yangonites. The apartments are usually eight stories high (including the ground floor) mainly because city regulations, until February 2008, required that all buildings higher than [tpl]convert|75|ft|m[/tpl] or eight stories install elevators.[tpl]Cite journal| title= Lift regulation changed| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no409/n013.htm| date=10 March 2008 | author=Yi Yi Htwe| publisher=The Myanmar Times[/tpl] The current code calls for elevators in buildings higher than [tpl]convert|62|ft|m[/tpl] or six stories, likely ushering in the era of the six-story apartment building. Although most apartment buildings were built only within the last 20 years, they look much older and rundown due to shoddy construction and lack of proper maintenance.
Unlike other major Asian cities, Yangon does not have any skyscrapers. Aside from a few high-rise hotels and office towers downtown, most high-rise buildings (usually 10 stories and up) are "condos" scattered across prosperous neighborhoods north of downtown such as Bahan, Dagon, Kamayut and Mayangon. The tallest building in Yangon, Pyay Gardens, is a 25-story condo in the city’s north.
Older satellite towns such as Thaketa, North Okkalapa and South Okkalapa are lined mostly with one to two story detached houses with access to the city's electricity grid. Newer satellite towns such as North Dagon and South Dagon are still essentially slums in a grid layout. The satellite towns—old or new—receive little or no municipal services.

===Road layout===

Downtown Yangon's road layout follows a grid pattern, based on four types of roads:
The east-west grid of downtown Yangon was laid out by British military engineers Fraser and Montgomerie after the Second Anglo-Burmese War. The city was later developed by the Public Works Department and Bengal Corps of Engineers. The pattern of south to north roads is as follows: one broad [tpl]convert|100|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] wide broad road, two narrow streets, one mid-size street, two more narrow streets, and then another [tpl]convert|100|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] wide broad road. This order is repeated from west to east. The narrow streets are numbered; the medium and broad roads are named.
For example, the [tpl]convert|100|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] Lanmadaw Road is followed by [tpl]convert|30|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl]-wide 17th and 18th streets then the medium [tpl]convert|50|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] Sint-Oh-Dan Road, the 30-foot 19th and 20th streets, followed by another [tpl]convert|100|ft|m|sing=on[/tpl] wide Latha Road, followed again by the two numbered small roads 21st and 22nd streets, and so on.
The roads running parallel west to east were the Strand Road, Merchant Road, Maha Bandula (née Dalhousie) Road, Anawrahta (Fraser) Road, and Bogyoke Aung San (Montgomerie) Road.

===Parks and gardens===

The largest and best maintained parks in Yangon are located around Shwedagon Pagoda. To the southeast of the gilded stupa is the most popular recreational area in the city – Kandawgyi Lake. The 150-acre (61-ha) lake is surrounded by the 110-acre (45-ha) Kandawgyi Nature Park,[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-travel/myanmar-yangon/kandawgyi-garden.htm| title=Kandawgyi Garden| accessdate=21 December 2006[/tpl] and the 69.25-acre (28-ha) Yangon Zoological Gardens, which consists of a zoo, an aquarium and an amusement park.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.yangonzoo.com/profile.html| title=History of Zoological Gardens (Yangon)| accessdate=27 September 2008[/tpl] West of the pagoda towards the former Hluttaw (Parliament) complex is the 130-acre (53-ha) People’s Square and People's Park, (the former parading ground on important national days when Yangon was the capital.)[tpl]cite web| url=http://myanmargeneva.org/basicfacts/cap.htm| title=Nation’s Capital Yangon| accessdate=9 October 2008[/tpl] A few miles north of the pagoda lies the 37-acre (15-ha) Inya Lake Park – a favorite hangout place of Yangon University students, and a well-known place of romance in Burmese popular culture.
Hlawga National Park and Allied War Memorial at the outskirts of the city are popular day-trip destinations with the well-to-do and tourists.

==Administration==

Yangon is administered by the Yangon City Development Committee (YCDC). YCDC also coordinates urban planning.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.chijihon.metro.tokyo.jp/asianet/participating_cities/yangon.htm| title=Yangon| accessdate=13 August 2006| publisher=Asian Network of Major Cities 21| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060620010837/http://www.chijihon.metro.tokyo.jp/asianet/participating_cities/yangon.htm| archivedate = 20 June 2006[/tpl] The city is divided into four districts. The districts combined have a total of 33 townships. The current mayor of Yangon is Hla Myint. Each township is administered by a committee of township leaders, who make decisions regarding city beautification and infrastructure. Myo-thit (lit. "New Towns", or satellite towns) are not within such jurisdictions.
Yangon is a member of Asian Network of Major Cities 21.

==Transport==

Yangon is Burma's main domestic and international hub for air, rail, and ground transportation.

===Air===

Yangon International Airport, located 12 miles (19 km) from downtown, is the country's main gateway for domestic and international air travel. It has direct flights to regional cities in Asia – mainly, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Beijing, Seoul, Guangzhou, Taipei, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Kunming and Singapore. Although domestic airlines offer service to about twenty domestic locations, most flights are to tourist destinations such as Bagan, Mandalay, Heho and Ngapali, and to the capital Naypyidaw.

===Railways===

Yangon Central Railway Station is the main terminus of Myanmar Railways' [tpl]convert|5403|km|mi|0|sing=on[/tpl] rail network[tpl]Cite news| title=MR to link Mandalay and Bhamo | date=22 February 2010 | publisher=New Light of Myanmar[/tpl] whose reach covers Upper Myanmar (Naypyidaw, Mandalay, Shwebo), upcountry (Myitkyina), Shan hills (Taunggyi, Lashio) and the Taninthayi coast (Mawlamyaing, Dawei).
Yangon Circular Railway runs a [tpl]convert|45.9|km|mi|sing=on[/tpl] 39-station commuter rail network that connects Yangon's satellite towns. The system is heavily utilized by the local populace, selling about 150,000 tickets daily.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/multimedia.php?art_id=10074| title=The Railway Bazaar| date=30 January 2008| author=Yeni| publisher=The Irrawaddy[/tpl] The popularity of the commuter line has jumped since the government reduced petrol subsidies in August 2007.

===Buses and cars===

Yangon has a [tpl]convert|4456|km[/tpl] road network of all types (tar, concrete and dirt) in March 2011. Many of the roads are in poor condition and not wide enough to accommodate an increasing number of cars. The vast majority of Yangonites cannot afford a car and rely on an extensive network of buses to get around. Over 300 public and private bus lines operate about 6,300 crowded buses around the city, carrying over 4.4 million passengers a day.[tpl]Cite journal| url=http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes18-341/n008.htm| title=First private bus line in Yangon launched| author=Yan Naing Hein| publisher=The Myanmar Times[/tpl] All buses and 80% of the taxis in Yangon run on compressed natural gas (CNG), following the 2005 government decree to save money on imported petroleum.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/highlight.php?art_id=14444| title=Rangoon Commuters Afraid of Gas Explosions| date=14 October 2008| author=Wai Moe| publisher=The Irrawaddy[/tpl] Highway buses to other cities depart from Dagon Ayeyar Highway Bus Terminal for Irrawaddy delta region and Aung Mingala Highway Bus Terminal for other parts of the country.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-travel/myanmar-yangon/yangon.htm#Getting_Around| title=Getting Around Yangon| accessdate=14 October 2008| publisher=Myanmar's Net[/tpl]
Motor transportation in Yangon is highly expensive for most of its citizens. As the government allows only a few thousand cars to be imported each year in a country with over 50 million people,[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/29/world/asia/29aid.html?scp=18&sq=myanmar&st=nyt| title=Burmese Economy Is an Obstacle to Aid| date=29 May 2008|work=The New York Times[/tpl] car prices in Yangon (and in Burma) are among the highest in the world. In July 2008, the two most popular cars in Yangon, 1986/87 Nissan Sunny Super Saloon and 1988 Toyota Corolla SE Limited, cost the equivalent of about US$20,000 and US$29,000 respectively.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/care2008/care05.htm | title=Clash of the titans on streets of Yangon| date=2 June 2008| author=Thomas Kean| publisher=The Myanmar Times[/tpl] A sports utility vehicle, imported for the equivalent of around US$50,000, goes for US$250,000. Illegally imported unregistered cars are cheaper – typically about half the price of registered cars. Nonetheless, car usage in Yangon is on the rise, a sign of rising incomes for some, and already causes much traffic congestion in highway-less Yangon's streets. In 2011, Yangon had about 300,000 registered motor vehicles in addition to an unknown number of unregistered ones.
Since 1970, cars have been driven on the right side of the road in Burma, as part of a military decree.[tpl]Cite news| title = Burma Makes Road Switch | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10913F93F5F1B7493C5A91789D95F448785F9 | work=The New York Times | date=7 December 1970 | accessdate=22 May 2010[/tpl] However, as the government has not required left hand drive (LHD) cars to accompany the right side road rules, many cars on the road are still right hand drive (RHD) made for driving on the left side. Japanese used cars, which make up most of the country's imports, still arrive with RHD and are never converted to LHD. As a result, Burmese drivers have to rely on their passengers when passing other cars.
Within Yangon city limits, it is illegal to drive trishaws, bicycles, and motorcycles. Since February 2010, pickup truck bus lines have been forbidden to run in 6 townships of Downtown Yangon, namely Latha, Lanmadaw, Pabedan, Kyauktada, Botahtaung and Pazundaung Townships.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2010/news/511/n51106.html|title=Authorities ban light truck buses in downtown areas|author=Nay Nwe Moe Aung|work=Myanmar Times|date=24 February 2010|accessdate=18 August 2011[/tpl] In May 2003, a ban on using car horns was implemented in six townships of Downtown Yangon to reduce noise pollution.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no396/n008.htm|title=Vehicle horn penalties increased|author=Shwe Yinn Mar Oo|date=10 December 2007|work=Myanmar Times|accessdate=18 August 2011[/tpl] In April 2004, the car horn ban was expanded to cover the entire city.

===River===

Yangon's four main passenger jetties, all located on or near downtown waterfront, mainly serve local ferries across the river to Dala and Thanlyin, and regional ferries to the Irrawaddy delta.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/myanmar-burma/yangon-rangoon/transport/getting-there-away | title=Yangon – Getting there and around | accessdate=26 July 2009 | publisher=Lonely Planet[/tpl] The 22-mile (35 km) Twante Canal was the quickest route from Yangon to the Irrawaddy delta until the 1990s when roads between Yangon and the Irrawaddy Division became usable year round. While passenger ferries to the delta are still used, those to Upper Burma via the Irrawaddy river are now limited mostly to tourist river cruises.

==Demographics==

Yangon is the most populous city by far in Burma although estimates of the size of its population vary widely. (All population figures are estimates since no official census has been conducted in Burma since 1983.) A UN estimate puts the population as 4.35 million in 2010 but a 2009 U.S. State Department estimate[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35910.htm | title=Background note: Burma | accessdate=6 March 2010 | publisher=US Department of State[/tpl] puts it at 5.5 million. The U.S. State Department's estimate is probably closer to the real number since the UN number is a straight-line projection, and does not appear to take the expansion of city limits in the past two decades into account. The city's population grew sharply after 1948 as many people (mainly, the indigenous Burmese) from other parts of the country moved into the newly built satellite towns of North Okkalapa, South Okkalapa, and Thaketa in the 1950s and East Dagon, North Dagon and South Dagon in the 1990s. Immigrants have founded their regional associations (such as Mandalay Association, Mawlamyaing Association, etc.) in Yangon for networking purposes. The government's decision to move the nation's administrative capital to Naypyidaw has drained an unknown number of civil servants away from Yangon.
Yangon is the most ethnically diverse city in the country. While Indians formed the slight majority prior to World War II, today, the majority of the population is of Bamar (Burman) descent. Large communities of Indians/South Asians and the Chinese still exist especially in the traditional downtown neighborhoods. Intermarriage between ethnic groups—especially between the Bamar and the Chinese, and the Bamar and other indigenous Burmese—is common. A large number of Rakhine and Karen live in the city.
Burmese is the principal language of the city. English is by far the preferred second language of the educated class. In recent years, however, the prospect of overseas job opportunities has enticed some to study other languages: Mandarin Chinese is most popular, followed by Japanese, French, and Korean.[tpl]Cite journal| title=Language training centres open doors to new worlds| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/edu/edu002.htm| date=14 May 2007| author=Kyaw Soe Linn and Phyo Wai Kyaw| publisher=The Myanmar Times[/tpl]

==Culture==

===Media===

Yangon is the country's hub for the movie, music, advertising, newspaper and book publishing industries. All media is heavily regulated by the military government. Television broadcasting is off limits to the private sector. All media content must first be approved by the government's media censor board, Press Scrutiny and Registration Division.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=10648| title=Burma: The Censored Land| date=1 March 2008| author=Yeni| publisher=The Irrawaddy[/tpl]
Most television channels in the country are broadcast from Yangon. TV Myanmar and Myawaddy TV are the two main channels, providing Burmese-language programming in news and entertainment. Other special interest channels are MWD-1 and MWD-2, MRTV-3, the English-language channel that targets overseas audiences via satellite and via Internet, MRTV-4 and Channel 7 are with a focus on non-formal education programs and movies, and Movie 5, a pay-TV channel specializing in broadcasting foreign movies.[tpl]Cite news| title=Digital television take-up slower than expected| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no429/b004.htm| date=3 August 2008| author=Kyaw Hsu Mon| work=The Myanmar Times[/tpl]
Yangon has three radio stations. Myanmar Radio National Service is the national radio service and broadcasts mostly in Burmese (and in English during specific times.) Pop culture oriented Yangon City FM and Mandalay City FM radio stations specialize in Burmese and English pop music, entertainment programs, live celebrity interviews, etc. New radio channels such as Shwe FM and Pyinsawaddy FM can also be tuned with the city area.
Nearly all print media and industries are based out of Yangon. All three national newspapers – two Burmese language dailies Myanma Alin ([tpl]my|မြန်မာ့အလင်း[/tpl]) and Kyemon ([tpl]my|ကြေးမုံ[/tpl]), and the English language The New Light of Myanmar — are published by the government. Semi-governmental The Myanmar Times weekly, published in Burmese and in English, is mainly geared for Yangon's expatriate community. Over twenty special interest journals and magazines covering sports, fashion, finance, crime, literature (but never politics) vie for the readership of the general populace.
Access to foreign media is extremely difficult. Satellite television in Yangon (and in Burma) is highly expensive as the government imposes an annual registration fee of one million kyats. Certain foreign newspapers and periodicals such as the International Herald Tribune and the Straits Times can be found only in a few (mostly downtown) bookstores. Internet access in Yangon, which has the best telecommunication infrastructure in the country, is slow and erratic at best, and the Burmese government implements one of the world's most restrictive regimes of Internet control.[tpl]cite web| url=http://opennet.net/studies/burma| title=Internet Filtering in Burma in 2005: A Country Study| date=1 October 2005| accessdate=29 August 2008[/tpl] International text messaging and voice messaging was permitted only in August 2008.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=13962| title=International Text Messaging Approved in Burma| author=Min Lwin| date=21 August 2008| publisher=The Irrawaddy[/tpl]

===Communication===

Common facilities taken for granted elsewhere are luxury prized items in Yangon (and Burma). The price of a GSM mobile phone was about K1.1 million in August 2008. In 2007, the country of 55 million had only 775,000 phone lines (including 275,000 mobile phones),[tpl]Cite news| title=ICT Statistics Collection and Analysis| url=http://www.unescap.org/icstd/events/Info-Society-Stats-Workshop-2007/Myanmar.pdf|publisher=The Government of the Union of Myanmar Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development| author=Central Statistical Organization| date=6 November 2007|format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]Cite news| url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-04/03/content_7913706.htm| title=Mobile phones in Myanmar increase to over 200,000 in 2007| date=3 April 2008| accessdate=1 September 2009[/tpl] and 400,000 computers. Even in Yangon, which has the best infrastructure, the estimated telephone penetration rate was only 6% at the end of 2004, and the official waiting time for a telephone line was 3.6 years.[tpl]Cite journal| title=Myanmar (Burma) – Telecoms, Mobile & Internet | url=http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/9fc71c/myanmar_burma | publisher=Research and Markets | date=19 July 2010 | location=Dublin[/tpl] Most people cannot afford a computer and have to use the city’s numerous Internet cafes to access a heavily restricted Internet, and a heavily censored local intranet. According to official statistics, in July 2010, the country had over 400,000 Internet users, with the vast majority hailing from just two cities, Yangon and Mandalay. Although Internet access was available in 42 cities across the country, the number of users outside the two main cities was just over 10,000.[tpl]Cite journal| title=State of Internet Usage in Myanmar | work=Bi-Weekly Eleven | language=Burmese | date=30 July 2010 | volume=3 | issue=18 | location=Yangon | author=Wai-Yan Phyo Oo and Saw Pyayzon[/tpl]

===Lifestyle===

Yangon’s property market is the most expensive in the country and beyond the reach of most Yangonites. Most rent outside downtown and few can afford to rent downtown area apartments. (In 2008, rents for a typical [tpl]convert|650|to|750|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] apartments in downtown and vicinity range between K70,000 and K150,000 and those for high end condos between K200,000 and K500,000.)[tpl]Cite journal| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no427/b006.htm| title=Rentals brisk in lead up to Waso| date=14 July 2008| author=Aye Sabae Phyu| work=The Myanmar Times[/tpl]
Most men of all ages (and some women) spend their time at ubiquitous tea-shops, found in any corner or street of the city. Watching European football (mostly English Premier League with occasional La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga) matches while sipping tea is a popular pastime among many Yangonites, rich and poor alike. The average person stays close to his or her neighbourhood haunts. The well-to-do tend to visit shopping malls and parks on weekends. Some leave the city on weekends for Chaungtha and Ngwesaung beach resorts in Ayeyarwady Division.
Yangon is also home to many pagoda festivals (paya pwe), held during dry-season months (November – March). The most famous of all, the Shwedagon Pagoda Festival in March, attracts thousands of pilgrims from around the country.
Yangon's museums are the domain of tourists and rarely visited by the locals.
Most of Yangon's larger hotels offer some kind of nightlife entertainment, geared towards tourists and the well-to-do Burmese. Some hotels offer traditional Burmese performing arts shows complete with a traditional Burmese orchestra. The pub scene in larger hotels is more or less the same as elsewhere in Asia. Other options include karaoke bars and pub restaurants in Yangon Chinatown.
Due to the problems of high inflation, the lack of high denomination notes, and the fact that many of the population do not have access to checks, or credit or debit cards, it is common to see citizens carrying a considerable amount of cash.[tpl]Cite journal| title=K5000 note achieves objective of making big transactions easier | author=Edward Xu and Kyle Sherer | date=19 July 2010 | work=The Myanmar Times | url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2010/business/532/busi006.html[/tpl] (The highest denomination of Burmese currency kyat is 5000 (~US$5.)) Credit cards are only rarely used in the city, chiefly in the more lavish hotels.

===Sports===

As the city has the best sporting facilities in the country, most national-level annual sporting tournaments such as track and field, football, volleyball, tennis and swimming are held in Yangon. The 40,000-seat Aung San Stadium and the 32,000-seat Thuwunna Stadium are the main venues for the highly popular annual State and Division football tournament. Until April 2009, the now defunct Myanmar Premier League, consisted of 16 Yangon-based clubs,[tpl]Cite news| title=Myanmar edges towards pro football| url=http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes14-277/sport.htm| date=1 August 2005| publisher=The Myanmar Times| author=Zaw Htet[/tpl] played all its matches in Yangon stadiums, and attracted little interest from the general public or commercial success despite the enormous popularity of football in Burma. Most Yangonites prefer watching European football on satellite TV. It remains to be seen whether the Myanmar National League, the country's first professional football league, and its Yangon-based club Yangon United FC will attract a sufficient following in the country's most important media market.
Yangon is also home to annual the Myanmar Open golf tournament, and the Myanmar Open tennis tournament. The city hosted the 1961 and 1969 South East Asian Games.  During colonial times, cricket was played mostly by British officials in the city.  First-class cricket was played in the city in January 1927 when the touring Marylebone Cricket Club played Burma and the Rangoon Gymkhana.  Two grounds were used to host these matches, the BAA Ground and the Gymkhana Ground.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/44/250.html |title=BAA Ground |publisher=CricketArchive.com[/tpl] Retrieved on 8 October 2011[tpl]citation |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/44/251.html |title=Gymkhana Ground |publisher=CricketArchive.com[/tpl] Retrieved on 8 October 2011  These matches mark the only time Burma and Rangoon Gymkhana have appeared in first-class cricket, and the only time first-class cricket has been played in Burma.  After independence cricket all but died out in the country.

==Economy==

Yangon is the country’s main center for trade, industry, real estate, media, entertainment and tourism. The city alone represents about one fifth of the national economy. According to official statistics for FY 2010–2011, the size of the economy of Yangon Region was 8.93 trillion kyats, or 23% of the national GDP.[tpl]cite journal | title=Yangon Region govt facing K22b budget black hole | url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2011/news/600/news60002.html | author=Kyaw Hsu Mon and Yadana Htun | date=7 November 2011 | work=The Myanmar Times[/tpl]
The city is Lower Burma’s main trading hub for all kinds of merchandise – from basic food stuffs to used cars although commerce continues to be hampered by the city's severely underdeveloped banking industry and communication infrastructure. Bayinnaung Market is the largest wholesale centre in the country for rice, beans and pulses, and other agricultural commodities.[tpl]Cite journal| url=http://www.myanmar.com/myanmartimes/MyanmarTimes17-332/b007.htm| title=Market reforms lead to Bayintnaung boom| author=Zaw Htet and May Thanda Win| date=4 September 2006| publisher=The Myanmar Times[/tpl] Much of the country’s legal imports and exports go through Thilawa Port, the largest and busiest port in Burma. There is also a great deal of informal trade, especially in street markets that exist alongside street platforms of Downtown Yangon's townships. However, on 17 June 2011, the YCDC announced that street vendors, who had previously been allowed to legally open shop at 3 pm, would be prohibited from selling on the streets, and permitted to sell only in their townships of residence, presumably to clean up the city's image.[tpl]cite news|url=http://mmtimes.com/2011/news/580/news58002.html|title=Vendors belong in markets, says YCDC|author=Nay Nwe Moe Aung|coauthors=Moh Moh Thaw|date=20 June 2011|work=Myanmar Times|accessdate=18 August 2011[/tpl] Since 1 December 2009, high-density polyethylene plastic bags have been banned by city authorities.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no496/n010.htm|title=Mayor reiterates bag ban|author=Myo Myo|date=9 November 2009|work=Myanmar Times|accessdate=18 August 2011[/tpl]
Manufacturing accounts for a sizable share of employment.

Tourism represents a major source of foreign currency for the city although by Southeast Asian standards the actual number of foreign visitors to Yangon has always been quite low—about 250,000 before the Saffron Revolution in September 2007. The number of visitors dipped even further following the Saffron Revolution and Cyclone Nargis.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://burmadigest.info/2008/11/27/tourism-decline-in-burma-in-2008/| title=Tourism decline in Burma in 2008| date=27 November 2008| publisher=Burma Digest| author=Weekly Eleven Journal[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] The recent improvement in the country's political climate has attracted an increasing number of businessmen and tourists.

While many students in poor districts fail to reach high school, a handful of Yangon high schools in wealthier districts like Dagon 1, Sanchaung 2, Kamayut 2, Bahan 2, Latha 2, and TTC provide the majority of students admitted to the most selective universities in the country, highlighting the extreme shallowness of talent pool in the country.[tpl]Cite journal| work=Bi-Weekly Eleven News | language=Burmese | title=Yangon Division Produces More Distinction Winners | publisher=Weekly Eleven Media | location=Yangon | date=28 June 2010 | url=http://www.news-eleven.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3593:2010-06-28-06-14-40&catid=43:2009-11-10-07-39-09&Itemid=111[/tpl] The wealthy bypass the state education system altogether, sending their children to private English language instruction schools such as YIEC, or abroad (typically Singapore or Australia) for university education.[tpl]Cite journal| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/edu08/e013.htm| title=Myanmar students choosing Australian and Singapore unis| date=28 March 2008| author=Aye Thawda Thit| publisher=The Myanmar Times[/tpl] In 2008, international schools in Yangon cost at least US$8,000 a year.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20081011-93043.html| title='I see no future for my two sons in Myanmar.'| date=13 October 2008| author=Sandra Davie|work=Straits Times |location=Singapore [/tpl]
Yangon is home to over 20 universities and colleges. While Yangon University remains the best known (its main campus is a part of popular Burmese culture e.g. literature, music, film, etc.), the nation's oldest university is now mostly a graduate school, deprived of undergraduate studies. Following the 1988 nationwide uprising, the military government has repeatedly shut down universities, and has dispersed most of undergraduate student population to new universities in the suburbs such as Dagon University, the University of East Yangon and the University of West Yangon. Nonetheless many of the country's most selective universities are still in Yangon. Students from around the country still have to come to study in Yangon as some subjects are offered only at its universities. The University of Medicine 1, University of Medicine 2, Yangon Technological University, University of Computer Studies and Myanmar Maritime University are the most selective in the country.[tpl]Cite news| url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/edu08/e001.htm | title=HR key to development| date=28 March 2008| author=Minh Zaw| publisher=The Myanmar Times[/tpl]

==Health care==

The general state of health care in Yangon is poor. According to a 2007 estimate, the military government spends 0.4% of the national budget on health care, and 40% to 60% on defense. By the government's own figures, it spends 849 kyats (US$0.85) per person.[tpl]Cite news| title=Another Medical Malpractice Death in Rangoon | url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=17547 | author=Arkar Moe | publisher=The Irrawaddy | date=8 January 2010[/tpl] Although health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals including the flagship Yangon General Hospital lack many of the basic facilities and equipment.
Wealthier Yangonites still have access to country's best medical facilities and internationally qualified doctors. Only do Yangon and Mandalay have any sizable number of doctors left as many Burmese doctors have emigrated. The well-to-do go to private clinics or hospitals like Pun Hlaing International Hospital and Bahosi Medical Clinic.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] Still, medical malpractice is widespread even in private clinics and hospitals that serve the well-to-do. In 2009 and 2010, a spate of high profile deaths brought out the severity of the problem, even for the relatively well off Yangonites.
