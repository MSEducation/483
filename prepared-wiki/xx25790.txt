The word "force" in this case is not used to mean mechanical force, measured in newtons, but a potential, or energy per unit of charge, measured in volts.
In electromagnetic induction, emf can be defined around a closed loop as the electromagnetic work that would be transferred to a unit of  charge if it travels once around that loop.[ref]

(While the charge travels around the loop, it can simultaneously lose the energy via resistance into thermal energy.)  For a time-varying magnetic flux impinging a loop, the electric potential scalar field is not defined due to circulating electric vector field, but nevertheless an emf does work that can be measured as a virtual electric potential around that loop.[ref]

In a two-terminal device (such as an electrochemical cell or electromagnetic generator), the emf can be measured as voltage across the two open-circuited terminals.  The created electrical potential difference drives current flow if a circuit is attached to the source of emf. When current flows, however, the voltage across the terminals of the source of emf is no longer the open-circuit value, due to voltage drops inside the device due to its internal resistance.
Devices that can provide emf include electrochemical cells, thermoelectric devices, solar cells and photodiodes, electrical generators, transformers, and even Van de Graaff generators.[ref]
