Ultimate Brazil was the first appearance of the UFC in Brazil, and the third UFC event to take place outside of the US.

The event featured the first ever UFC Lightweight Championship fight, as well as a Middleweight Championship fight.
Ultimate Brazil was part one of what the UFC called "The Road To The Heavyweight Title" (not to be confused with the event of the same name), a tournament of sorts, spanning four events, to crown the new UFC Heavyweight Champion following Randy Couture's relinquishing of the belt.
UFC Brazil marked the first appearance of Pedro Rizzo, who would go on to become a top UFC heavyweight contender. The event also featured the first appearance of future PRIDE Middleweight Champion Wanderlei Silva.
