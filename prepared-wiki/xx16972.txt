Although his experiment was a success, it did increase the amount of aluminium ions in the area of the brook that was not treated with the limestone. This shows that CaCO<sub>3</sub> can be added to neutralize the effects of acid rain in [[river]] ecosystems. Currently calcium carbonate is used to neutralize acidic conditions in both soil and water.<ref>[tpl]cite web|title=Environmental Uses for Calcium Carbonate|url=http://www.congcal.com/markets/environmental/|work=http://www.congcal.com/markets/environmental/|publisher=Congcal|accessdate=5 August 2013[/tpl]</ref><ref>[tpl]cite journal|author = R.

==Calcination equilibrium==

Calcination of limestone using charcoal fires to produce quicklime has been practiced since antiquity by cultures all over the world. The temperature at which limestone yields calcium oxide is usually given as 825 °C, but stating an absolute threshold is misleading. Calcium carbonate exists in equilibrium with calcium oxide and carbon dioxide at any temperature. At each temperature there is a partial pressure of carbon dioxide that is in equilibrium with calcium carbonate. At room temperature the equilibrium overwhelmingly favors calcium carbonate, because the equilibrium CO2 pressure is only a tiny fraction of the partial CO2 pressure in air, which is about 0.035 kPa.
At temperatures above 550 °C the equilibrium CO2 pressure begins to exceed the CO2 pressure in air. So above 550 °C, calcium carbonate begins to outgas CO2 into air. However, in a charcoal fired kiln, the concentration of CO2 will be much higher than it is in air. Indeed if all the oxygen in the kiln is consumed in the fire, then the partial pressure of CO2 in the kiln can be as high as 20 kPa.[tpl]cite web|title = Solvay Precipitated Calcium Carbonate: Production|publisher = Solvay S. A. |date=2007-03-09|accessdate = 2007-12-30|url = http://www.solvaypcc.com/safety_environment/0,0,1000044-_EN,00.html[/tpl]
The table shows that this equilibrium pressure is not achieved until the temperature is nearly 800 °C. For the outgassing of CO2 from calcium carbonate to happen at an economically useful rate, the equilibrium pressure must significantly exceed the ambient pressure of CO2. And for it to happen rapidly, the equilibrium pressure must exceed total atmospheric pressure of 101 kPa, which happens at 898 °C.[tpl]clear right[/tpl]

==Solubility==

===With varying CO2 pressure===

Calcium carbonate is poorly soluble in pure water (47 mg/L at normal atmospheric CO2 partial pressure as shown below).
The equilibrium of its solution is given by the equation (with dissolved calcium carbonate on the right):
|  style="width:50%; height:30px;"| CaCO3 [tpl]eqm[/tpl] Ca2+ + CO32–
| Ksp = 3.7×10−9 to 8.7×10−9 at 25 °C
|}
where the solubility product for Ca2+CO32– is given as anywhere from Ksp = 3.7×10−9 to Ksp = 8.7×10−9 at 25 °C, depending upon the data source.[tpl]cite web|title = Selected Solubility Products and Formation Constants at 25 °C|publisher = California State University, Dominguez Hills|url = http://www.csudh.edu/oliver/chemdata/data-ksp.htm[/tpl] What the equation means is that the product of molar concentration of calcium ions (moles of dissolved Ca2+ per liter of solution) with the molar concentration of dissolved CO32– cannot exceed the value of Ksp. This seemingly simple solubility equation, however, must be taken along with the more complicated equilibrium of carbon dioxide with water (see carbonic acid). Some of the CO32– combines with H+ in the solution according to:
|  style="width:50%; height:25px;"| HCO3– [tpl]eqm[/tpl] H+ + CO32–   
| Ka2 = 5.61×10−11 at 25 °C
|}
HCO3– is known as the bicarbonate ion. Calcium bicarbonate is many times more soluble in water than calcium carbonate—indeed it exists only in solution.
Some of the HCO3– combines with H+ in solution according to:
|  style="width:50%; height:25px;"|H2CO3 [tpl]eqm[/tpl] H+ + HCO3–   
| Ka1 = 2.5×10−4 at 25 °C
|}
Some of the H2CO3 breaks up into water and dissolved carbon dioxide according to:
|  style="width:50%; height:25px;"| H2O + CO2(dissolved) [tpl]eqm[/tpl] H2CO3   
| Kh = 1.70×10−3 at 25 °C
|}
And dissolved carbon dioxide is in equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide according to:
|}
|  style="width:50%; height:25px;"| H2O [tpl]eqm[/tpl] H+ + OH–
| K = 10−14 at 25 °C
|}
(which is true for all aqueous solutions), and the fact that the solution must be electrically neutral,
make it possible to solve simultaneously for the remaining five unknown concentrations (note that the above form of the neutrality equation is valid only if calcium carbonate has been put in contact with pure water or with a neutral pH solution; in the case where the origin water solvent pH is not neutral, the equation is modified).
The table on the right shows the result for Ca2+ and H+ (in the form of pH) as a function of ambient partial pressure of CO2 (Ksp = 4.47×10−9 has been taken for the calculation).
The effect of the latter is especially evident in day-to-day life of people who have hard water. Water in aquifers underground can be exposed to levels of CO2 much higher than atmospheric. As such water percolates through calcium carbonate rock, the CaCO3 dissolves according to the second trend. When that same water then emerges from the tap, in time it comes into equilibrium with CO2 levels in the air by outgassing its excess CO2. The calcium carbonate becomes less soluble as a result and the excess precipitates as lime scale. This same process is responsible for the formation of stalactites and stalagmites in limestone caves.
Two hydrated phases of calcium carbonate, monohydrocalcite, CaCO3·H2O and ikaite, CaCO3·6H2O, may precipitate from water at ambient conditions and persist as metastable phases.

===With varying pH, temperature and salinity: CaCO3 scaling in swimming pools===

In contrast to the open equilibrium scenario above, many swimming pools are managed by addition of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to about 2 mM as a buffer, then control of pH through use of HCl, NaHSO4, Na2CO3, NaOH or chlorine formulations that are acidic or basic. In this situation, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is far from equilibrium with atmospheric CO2. Progress towards equilibrium through outgassing of CO2 is slowed by (i) the slow reaction H2CO3 ⇌ CO2(aq) + H2O;Wang X, Conway W, Burns R, McCann N, Maeder M (2010) Comprehensive study of the hydration and dehydration reactions of carbon dioxide in aqueous solution. Journal of Physical Chemistry A 114 (4), 1734-1740. doi:10.1021/jp909019u (ii) limited aeration in a deep water column and (iii) periodic replenishment of bicarbonate to maintain buffer capacity (often estimated through measurement of ‘total alkalinity’).
In this situation, the dissociation constants for the much faster reactions H2CO3 ⇌ H+ + HCO3‾ ⇌ 2 H+ + CO32- allow the prediction of concentrations of each DIC species in solution, from the added concentration of HCO3- (which comprises more than 90% of total DIC from pH 7 to pH 8 at 25 ˚C in fresh water.Mook W (2000) Chemistry of carbonic acid in water. In 'Environmental Isotopes in the Hydrological Cycle: Principles and Applications' pp. 143-165. (INEA / UNESCO: Paris). http://www-naweb.iaea.org/napc/ih/documents/global_cycle/vol%20I/cht_i_09.pdf Retrieved 30NOV2013. Addition of HCO3- will increase CO32- concentration at any pH. Rearranging the equations given above, we can see that Ca2+ = Ksp / CO32-, and CO32- = Ka2 x HCO3- / H+. Therefore, when HCO3- concentration is known, the maximum concentration of Ca2+ ions before scaling through CaCO3 precipitation can be predicted from the formula:
Ca2+max = (Ksp / Ka2) x (H+ / HCO3-)
The solubility product for CaCO3 (Ksp) and the dissociation constants for the DIC species (including Ka2) are all substantially affected by temperature and salinity, with the overall effect that Ca2+max increases from fresh to salt water, and decreases with rising temperature, pH, or added bicarbonate level, as illustrated in the accompanying graphs.
The trends are illustrative for pool management, but whether scaling occurs also depends on other factors including interactions with Mg2+, B(OH)4- and other ions in the pool, as well as supersaturation effects.Wojtowicz JA (1998) Factors affecting precipitation of calcium carbonate.

Scaling is commonly observed in electrolytic chlorine generators, where there is a high pH near the cathode surface and scale deposition further increases temperature. This is one reason that some pool operators prefer borate over bicarbonate as the primary pH buffer, and avoid the use of pool chemicals containing calcium.Birch RG (2013) BABES: a better method than “BBB” for pools with a salt-water chlorine generator. http://members.iinet.net.au/~jorobbirch/BABES.pdf Retrieved 30NOV2013.

===Solubility in a strong or weak acid solution===

Solutions of strong (HCl), moderately strong (sulfamic) or weak (acetic, citric, sorbic, lactic, phosphoric) acids are commercially available. They are commonly used as descaling agents to remove limescale deposits. The maximum amount of CaCO3 that can be "dissolved" by one liter of an acid solution can be calculated using the above equilibrium equations.
For the same total acid concentration, the initial pH of the weak acid is less acid than the one of the strong acid; however, the maximum amount of CaCO3 which can be dissolved is approximately the same. This is because in the final state, the pH is larger than the pKA, so that the weak acid is almost completely dissociated, yielding in the end as many H+ ions as the strong acid to "dissolve" the calcium carbonate.
where A = H3PO4 + H2PO4− + HPO42− + PO43− is the total acid concentration. Thus phosphoric acid is more efficient than a monoacid since at the final almost neutral pH, the second dissociated state concentration HPO42− is not negligible (see phosphoric acid).
