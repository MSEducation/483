==History==

===Early life and career===

Martha Rose Reeves was born in Eufaula, Alabama, the first daughter of Elijah Joshua Reeves and Ruby Lee Gilmore Reeves, and the third of the couple's 11 children. She was under a year old when the family moved from Eufaula to Detroit, Michigan, where her grandfather, Reverend Elijah Reeves, was a minister at Detroit's Metropolitan Church. The family was very active in the church and its choir.  Both Elijah and Ruby played guitar and liked to sing; the children acquired their love of music from their parents.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thesoulguy.com/marthareeves.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080510074116/http://www.thesoulguy.com/marthareeves.htm|archivedate=2008-05-10|title=Martha Reeves|publisher=TheSoulGuy.com|accessdate=16 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/vandellas.htm|title=Martha and the Vandellas|publisher=HistoryofRock.com|accessdate=16 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.generalentertainment.com/artists/MarthaReeves.htm|title=Martha Reeves|publisher=General Entertainment.com|accessdate=16 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/776/000101473/|title=Martha Reeves|publisher=NNDB|accessdate=16 December 2010[/tpl] At Detroit's Northeastern High School, her vocal coach was Abraham Silver, who also worked with Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson (of The Supremes) and Bobby Rogers (of The Miracles). Raised on gospel, and inspired by singers like Lena Horne and Della Reese, Reeves became a fan of R&B and doo-wop music. She joined The Fascinations. in 1959, but left the group before they became a recording act. Her sister Lois Reeves is also a singer, and performed with the Vandellas and Quiet Elegance.
1957 was her first association with Rosalind Ashford, Gloria Williams and Annette Beard in a group then known The Del-Phis, formed after a man named Edward "Pops" Larkins was starting a sister singing group to complement a male vocal group of his. The Del-Phis were popular local performers. Reeves was reportedly an admirer of the group and was a friend of Gloria Williams, who hired Reeves to join the group in 1960.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]
Through 1960 and 1961, Reeves made ends meet working several jobs by day and worked as a singer in nighttime hours singing jazz and blues standards at some of Detroit's respected nightclubs. After a performance at Twenty Grand Club, Reeves was spotted by Motown A&R director Mickey Stevenson, who gave the singer, who was then going by the unusual surname LaVaille as her stage name, his business card for a possible audition. Since Reeves didn't know the protocol of Motown's auditions, Reeves said she showed up to Motown's Hitsville USA studios the following day, and was apprehended by Stevenson for showing up earlier than expected. Motown held auditions for Thursday - Reeves had showed up on a Tuesday. Reeves was then told to look after Stevenson's appointments while Stevenson went on a break.
Before long, Reeves was working several hours at Hitsville as Stevenson's right hand.  (Reeves also did A&R work in addition to secretarial work for Motown.[tpl]cite web|url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19781/m1/ |title=Show 26 - The Soul Reformation: Phase two, the Motown story. 5 : UNT Digital Library |publisher=Digital.library.unt.edu |date=1969-06-22 |accessdate=2010-12-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Martha_Reeves.aspx|title=Martha Reeves|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=16 December 2010[/tpl]) By 1961, the Del-Phis had changed their name to The Vels and recorded unsuccessful singles for Checker and Checkmate Records. One day, when the Andantes couldn't make a session to back the Miracles' drummer on songs he was recording, Martha called her groupmates. The ladies provided backup vocals for Marvin Gaye's "Stubborn Kind of Fellow".[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H84DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA83&dq=martha+reeves#v=onepage&q=martha%20reeves&f=false|title=Martha and the Vandellas|date=February 1968|publisher=Ebony|accessdate=16 December 2010[/tpl] The single became a hit.
After recording what was initially a demo for Mary Wells, Motown offered the group a recording contract. Before they could sign, Gloria Williams opted to leave the group for a life as a public social worker. Choosing to remain a trio, the group changed their name to Martha and the Vandellas. Reeves' changing of the group's name was due to her living on Detroit's Van Dyke Street as a child and for honoring Detroit R&B vocalist Della Reese, who was Reeves' idol.

===Martha and the Vandellas===

With her brassy and gospel-reared alto vocals, Martha Reeves helped Martha and the Vandellas ascend from background singers with early songs such as "Come and Get These Memories" and "(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave" distinguishing the group from contemporaries and label mates The Marvelettes and The Supremes, who were more influenced by doo-wop. Though the group's early recordings under their different monikers were doo-wop oriented, the majority of songs released under the Vandellas' name produced a rougher, soulful sound with powerful musical backing from The Funk Brothers. Martha's alto, Rosalind Ashford's soprano and Annette Beard's contralto vocals gave their harmonies dimension and made their recordings unique.
After "Heat Wave" became the group's first million-seller, Martha and the Vandellas quickly rose to become one of the label's top draw both as recording stars and as a successful live act. Martha was the one consistent member of the group staying throughout all the group's incarnations and lineups. After the exits of original members Annette Beard[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mTM_9JTeoMIC&pg=PA420&dq=martha+reeves#v=onepage&q=martha%20reeves&f=false|title=American Singing Groups: A History, From 1940 to Today|editor-last=Warner|editor-first=Jay|publisher=Hal Leonard|year=2006|page=584|isbn=0-634-09978-7|accessdate=16 December 2010[/tpl] and Rosalind Ashford, members replacing them included Betty Kelly, Sandra Tilley and Martha's youngest sister Lois Reeves. Among the singles released that became signature hits for the group are "Quicksand", "In My Lonely Room", "Live Wire", "Nowhere to Run", "A Love Like Yours (Don't Come Knocking Everyday)", "I'm Ready for Love", "Jimmy Mack", "Honey Chile" and the group's most popular single, "Dancing in the Street".[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ocwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62&dq=martha+reeves#v=onepage&q=martha%20reeves&f=false|title=Martha Reeves Without the Vandellas|date=February 1988|publisher=Ebony|accessdate=16 December 2010[/tpl] Martha often cites her performance highlights as one being a performance with Vandellas worshiper, Brit soul singer Dusty Springfield, on the UK show, Ready, Steady, Go! and performing on The Ed Sullivan Show.[tpl]cite web|url=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/isam/NewsletF05/RandallF05.htm|title=Dusty Springfield and the Motown Invasion|author=Randall, Annie J.|year=2005|publisher=Institute for Studies In American Music|accessdate=24 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0724745/|title=The Ed Sullivan Show Episode 19.13|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=16 December 2010[/tpl]
Despite their success, Martha and the Vandellas were overshadowed, as Motown focused its promotional muscle behind The Supremes and the group's lead singer, Diana Ross in particular, more so than the Vandellas.[tpl]cite book|title=She's a Rebel: The History of Women in Rock and Roll (Live Girls)|editor-last=Gaar|editor-first=Gillian G.|publisher=Seal Press|year=2002|page=496|isbn=1-58005-078-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=m09vjqEmeX4C&pg=PA69&dq=martha+reeves#v=onepage&q=martha%20reeves&f=false|accessdate=16 December 2010[/tpl] Many of the group's recordings remain in the vaults of Motown.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0716254/bio|title=Martha Reeves|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=16 December 2010[/tpl]

When Reeves was well enough to return, she recruited Sandra Tilley and the lineup of Martha and Lois Reeves and Tilley continued until 1972 when the group disbanded shortly after issuing the Black Magic album. In 1973, Martha planned to continue releasing solo work with Motown, but when the label moved from Detroit to Los Angeles, Reeves negotiated out of her contract with Motown, ending her 12-year association with the label.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zLEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62&dq=martha+reeves#v=onepage&q=martha%20reeves&f=false|title=Martha Reeves Quits Vandellas To Go Solo|date=15 February 1973|publisher=Jet|accessdate=16 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MbEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA56&dq=martha+reeves#v=onepage&q=martha%20reeves&f=false|title=Singer Martha Reeves Leaves Motown Records|date=29 March 1973|publisher=Jet|accessdate=16 December 2010[/tpl]
In 1989, Martha, Rosalind Ashford, and Annette Beard filed a lawsuit against Motown Records for royalties on the group's records not received since 1972. The company reached a settlement with the women in 1991. While Berry Gordy, Jr. apologized to Reeves for the length of time in reaching the agreement, the terms of the settlement were not made public.

===Solo career===

Martha released her first solo album in 1974 for MCA. The self-titled album, produced by Richard Perry, was reportedly the most expensive album of that time, costing $250,000. Featuring the singles, "Power of Love" and "Wild Night", the album was a critically favored smash, though it failed to generate commercial success as did Reeves' subsequent follow-ups on other labels including Arista and Fantasy.
