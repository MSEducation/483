Kassaman or Qassaman (We Pledge) ([tpl]lang-ar|قَسَمًا[/tpl]) is the national anthem of Algeria. It was adopted in 1963, shortly after Independence. The lyrics were written by Mufdi Zakariah in 1956 while imprisoned by the French colonial forces. He wrote the verses using his blood on the 69th cell walls. The composer of the music is Mohamed Fawzi, from Egypt. The lyrics of Kassaman make direct reference to another state, France, the former colonial power in Algeria.[tpl]cite web | url=http://nationalanthems.me/algeria-qassaman | title=Algeria: Qassaman | publisher=NationalAnthems.me | accessdate=8 August 2011 [/tpl]
