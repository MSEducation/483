Montgomery [tpl]IPAc-en|m|ɒ|n|t|ˈ|ɡ|ʌ|m|ər|i[/tpl] is the capital of the state of Alabama, and is the county seat of Montgomery County.[tpl]GR|6|dateform=mdy[/tpl]  Named for Richard Montgomery, it is located on the Alabama River, in the Gulf Coastal Plain.  As of the 2010 Census, Montgomery had a population of 205,764.  It is the second-largest city in Alabama, after Birmingham,[tpl]cite web|last=Spencer|first=Thomas|title=2010 Census: Rural to urban shift for Alabama population|url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2011/02/2010_census_rural_to_urban_shi.html|work=al.com|accessdate=June 24, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zgupS4td|archivedate=June 24, 2011|date=February 25, 2011[/tpl] and the 103rd largest in the United States. The Montgomery Metropolitan Statistical Area had a 2010 estimated population of 374,536.

The city was incorporated in 1819, as a merger of two towns situated along the Alabama River. It became the state capital in 1846, representing the shift of power to the south-central area with the growth of cotton as a commodity crop of the Black Belt and Mobile's rise as a mercantile port. In February 1861, Montgomery was selected as the first capital of the Confederate States of America, until the seat of government moved to Richmond, Virginia, in May of that year. During the mid-20th century, Montgomery was a major site of events in the African-American Civil Rights Movement,Beito, David (2009-05-02) Something is Rotten in Montgomery, LewRockwell.com including the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the Selma to Montgomery marches.
In addition to housing many Alabama government agencies, Montgomery has a large military presence due to Maxwell Air Force Base; public universities Alabama State University, Troy University (Montgomery campus), and Auburn University at Montgomery; private colleges/universities Faulkner University and Huntingdon College; high-tech manufacturing, including Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama;[tpl]citation |url=http://www.hmmausa.com |title=Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama; LLC |accessdate=January 11, 2009[/tpl] and cultural attractions such as the Alabama Shakespeare Festival and Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts.

==History==

Prior to European colonization, the left bank of the Alabama River was inhabited by the Alibamu tribe of Native Americans.  The Alibamu and the Coushatta, who lived on the opposite side the river, were descended from the Mississippian culture, which had built massive earthwork mounds as part of their society about 950–1250 AD. They spoke mutually intelligible Muskogean languages, which were closely related. Present-day Montgomery is built on the site of two Alibamu towns: Ikanatchati (Ekanchattee or Ecunchatty or Econachatee), meaning "red earth"; and Towassa, built on a bluff called Chunnaanaauga Chatty.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.mc-ala.org/Home/About%20Your%20County/History/History.htm |title=Montgomery County, Alabama History |publisher=Montgomery County, Alabama |accessdate=January 23, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070222235358/http://www.mc-ala.org/Home/About+Your+County/History/History.htm |archivedate = February 22, 2007[/tpl] The first Europeans to travel through central Alabama were Hernando de Soto and his expedition, who went through Ikanatchati and camped for one week in Towassa in 1540.
The next recorded European encounter occurred more than a century later, when an expedition from Carolina went down the Alabama River in 1697. The first permanent European settler in the Montgomery area was James McQueen, a Scots trader who settled there in 1716.[tpl]citation |last1=Owen |first1=Thomas McAdory |last2=Owen |first2=Marie Bankhead |year=1921 |title=History of Alabama and Dictionary of Alabama Biography |edition=De luxe supplement |volume=II |place=Chicago |publisher=S.

Their mixed-race children were considered Muskogean, as both tribes had a matrilineal system of property and descent.  The children gained status in their mother's clan.
In 1785, Abraham Mordecai, a war veteran from a Sephardic Jewish family of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, established a trading post. The Coushatta and Alabama had gradually moved south and west after the French defeat by the British in 1763 in the Seven Years' War. They moved to Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, areas of Spanish rule, which they thought more favorable than the British. By the time Mordecai had arrived, Creek had settled in the area, under pressure from Cherokee and Iroquois warfare to the north.  Mordecai married a Creek woman. When her people had to cede most of their lands after the Creek War, she joined them in removal. Mordecai brought the first cotton gin to Alabama.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/al/montgomery.html |title=Montgomery, Alabama |publisher=Goldring / Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life |accessdate=January 31, 2009[/tpl]
The Upper Creek were able to discourage most European-American immigration until after the conclusion of the Creek War. Following their defeat by General Andrew Jackson in August 1814, the Creek tribes were forced to cede 23 million acres to the United States, including remaining land in Georgia and most of central and southern Alabama. In 1816, the territory organized Montgomery County, and its lands were sold off the next year at the federal land office in Milledgeville, Georgia.
The first group of European-American settlers to come to the Montgomery area was headed by General John Scott. The group founded Alabama Town about [tpl]convert|2|mi|km|0[/tpl] downstream on the Alabama River from present-day downtown. In June 1818, county courts were moved from Fort Jackson to Alabama Town.  Soon after, Andrew Dexter, Jr. founded New Philadelphia, the present-day eastern part of downtown.  He envisioned a prominent future for his town; he set aside a hilltop known as "Goat Hill" as the future site of the state capitol building.  New Philadelphia soon prospered, and Scott and his associates built a new town adjacent, calling it East Alabama Town. Originally rivals, the towns merged on December 3, 1819, and were incorporated as the town of Montgomery.An act to incorporate the town of Montgomery in the county of Montgomery.

Driven by the revenues of the cotton trade, the newly united Montgomery grew quickly.  In 1822, the city became the county seat.  A new courthouse was built at the present location of Court Square, at the foot of Market Street (now Dexter Avenue).Owen, p. 1038 The state capital was moved from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery, on January 28, 1846.[tpl]citation |last=Neeley |first=Mary Ann Oglesby |contribution=Montgomery |title=Encyclopedia of Alabama |date=November 6, 2008 |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1833 |accessdate=May 2, 2009[/tpl]
As state capital, Montgomery began to influence state politics, and would also play a prominent role on the national stage. Beginning February 4, 1861, representatives from Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina met in Montgomery, host of the [tpl]anchor|Southern Convention[/tpl]Southern Convention,Brown, Russel K. (1994). To The Manner Born: The Life Of General William H. T. Walker. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press. ISBN 9780865549449. Retrieved July 22, 2013. to form the Confederate States of America.  Montgomery was named the first capital of the nation, and Jefferson Davis was inaugurated as President on the steps of the State Capitol.  On April 12, 1865, following the Battle of Selma, Major General James H. Wilson captured Montgomery for the Union.[tpl]citation |last=Hébert |first=Keith S. |contribution=Wilson's Raid |title=Encyclopedia of Alabama |date=October 23, 2007 |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1375 |accessdate=May 2, 2009[/tpl]
In 1886 Montgomery became the first city in the United States to install city-wide electric street cars along a system that was nicknamed the Lightning Route.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/499/000166998/|title=Charles J. Van Depoele|accessdate=December 14, 2008[/tpl]  The system made Montgomery one of the first cities to "depopulate" its residential areas at the city center through transit-facilitated suburban development.
According to the historian David Beito of the University of Alabama, African Americans in Montgomery "nurtured the modern civil rights movement." On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man, sparking the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Martin Luther King, Jr., then the pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, and E.D. Nixon,  a local civil rights advocate, founded the Montgomery Improvement Association to organize the boycott. In June 1956, the US District Court Judge Frank M. Johnson ruled that Montgomery's bus racial segregation was unconstitutional. After the US Supreme Court upheld the ruling in November, the city desegregated the bus system, and the boycott was ended.[tpl]citation |last=Hare |first=Ken |title=Montgomery Bus Boycott: The story of Rosa Parks and the Civil Rights Movement |periodical=Montgomery Advertiser |url=http://www.montgomeryboycott.com/article_overview.htm |accessdate=May 2, 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] Opponents organized mob violence with police collaboration at the Greyhound Bus Station during the Freedom Ride of May 1961.  Outraged national reaction resulted in the desegregation of interstate public transportation.
Martin Luther King returned to Montgomery in 1965.  Local civil rights leaders in Selma had been protesting Jim Crow laws that prevented blacks from registering to vote.  Following the shooting of a man after a civil rights rally, the leaders decided to march to Montgomery to petition Governor George Wallace to allow free voter registration. The violence they encountered contributed to Congressional passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to enforce the rights of African Americans and other minorities to vote.
On February 7, 1967, a devastating fire broke out at Dale's Penthouse, a restaurant and lounge on the top floor of the Walter Bragg Smith apartment building (now called Capital Towers) at 7 Clayton Street downtown. Twenty-six people lost their lives.[tpl]citation |url=http://www3.gendisasters.com/alabama/617/montgomery,-al-restaurant-fire,-feb-1967 |title=Dale's Penthouse Fire |publisher=gendisasters.com |accessdate=2012-12-11[/tpl]
In recent years, Montgomery has grown and diversified its economy. Active in restoring the downtown, the city adopted a master plan in 2007; it includes the revitalization of Court Square and the riverfront.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.doverkohl.com/project.aspx?id=16&type=2 |title= Montgomery Downtown Plan and SmartCode| publisher=Dover, Kohl, and Partners |accessdate=August 23, 2008[/tpl]

===Climate===

Montgomery has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), with short, mild winters, warm springs and autumns, and long, hot, humid summers. The daily average temperature in January is [tpl]convert|46.6|°F|1[/tpl], and there are 3.4 days of sub-[tpl]convert|20|°F|0[/tpl] lows; [tpl]convert|10|°F|0[/tpl] and below is extremely rare. The daily average in July is [tpl]convert|81.8|°F|1[/tpl], with highs exceeding [tpl]convert|90|°F|1[/tpl] on 86 days per year and [tpl]convert|100|°F|1[/tpl] on 3.9. Summer afternoon heat indices, much more often than the actual air temperature, are frequently at or above 100 °F. The diurnal temperature variation tends to be large in spring and autumn. Rainfall is well-distributed throughout the year, though January through March are the wettest, and October is significantly drier than the other months. Snowfall occurs only during some winters, and even then is usually light.  Substantial snowstorms are rare, but do occur approximately once every 10 years.  Extremes range from [tpl]convert|-5|°F|0[/tpl] on February 13, 1899 [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/bmx/?n=climo_winter2006mgm |title=Montgomery Alabama Cold Weather Facts |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |publisher=The National Weather Service.[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|107|°F|0[/tpl] on July 7, 1881.[ref]

Thunderstorms bring much of Montgomery's rainfall. These are common during the summer months but occur throughout the year. Severe thunderstorms - producing large hail and damaging winds in addition to the usual hazards of lightning and heavy rain - can occasionally occur, particularly during the spring. Severe storms also bring a risk of tornadoes. Sometimes, tropical disturbances - some of which strike the Gulf Coast as hurricanes before losing intensity as they move inland - can bring very heavy rains.

==Economy==

Montgomery's central location in Alabama's Black Belt makes it a processing hub for crops such as cotton, peanuts, and soybeans.

==Law and government==

Montgomery operates under a Mayor–council government system. The mayor and council members are elected to four-year terms.  The current mayor is Todd Strange, who was elected mayor in a special election, held March 10, 2009, after then-mayor Bobby Bright was elected to U.S. Congress for the 2nd district.  The city is served by a nine-member city council, elected from nine districts of equal size.
As the seat of Montgomery County, the city is the location of county courts and the county commission.  Montgomery is the capital of Alabama, and hosts numerous state government offices, including the office of the Governor, the Alabama Legislature, and the Alabama Supreme Court.
At the federal level, the majority of Montgomery is part of the 2nd U.S. Congressional district, currently represented by Republican Martha Roby.  Roby defeated former Montgomery mayor Bobby Bright in the 2010 elections.  Some of the southern and eastern portions of the city are part of the 3rd district, represented by Republican Mike Rogers.
