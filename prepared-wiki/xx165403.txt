The Augrabies Flat Lizard (Platysaurus broadleyi) is a species of lizard in the Cordylidae family found in South Africa.

==Geography==

The Augrabies Flat Lizard has its range between Augrabies Falls and Pella, North Cape in South Africa. This area includes the lower Orange River, Northern Cape Province, and Gordonia District.[tpl]Cite web | url = http://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/species.php?genus=Platysaurus&species=broadleyi | title = Platysaurus broadleyi BRANCH & WHITING, 1997 | work = The Reptile Database | accessdate = 2007-08-06[/tpl] This lizard's habitat is rocky savannahs.

==Description==

Females and juveniles have a dark brown back, with three thick, cream stripes on the back. These stripes may be broken up into spots, or have spots in between the stripes.  The belly is white, sometimes with a black dot on it, and at the rear there is an orange color. The tail is straw-colored. 
Adult males have a bluish head and a greenish back. A darker area in the middle and the vestiges of the juvenile stripes and spots are also present. The forelimbs are yellow to orange, the throat is dark blue, and the belly is black in the front but becomes orange near the tail. Above the tail, it is a tan color, while below and on the sides, it is orange. All this coloration, while it helps attract females, also has a downside: predators such as kestrels easily spot them. Females, on the other hand, have much more subdued coloration and are less likely to be eaten.[tpl]Cite web | url = http://flickr.com/photos/jo_mur/2312505146/| title = Image of Flat Lizard (Platysaurus broadleyi) | work = posted on Flickr | accessdate = 26 December 2008[/tpl]
The Augrabies Flat Lizard is very similar to Platysaurus capensis, or the Cape Flat Lizard, in scalation, but differs in having finer scalation on top of the forelimbs.

==Habits==

Augrabies Flat Lizards are common on the granite walls of Augrabies Falls National Park, where they are exposed to thousands of tourists. In summer, they perform acrobatic leaps to catch black flies on the wing from the swarms that gather near rivers, but they will also eat ripe berries of Namaqua Figs. Augrabies Flat Lizards will follow bird flocks to find these fruit-laden trees.[tpl]Cite news | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16021653.600-follow-that-bird.html | title = Follow that bird | work = New Scientist | date = 1998-12-19 | accessdate = 2007-08-06[/tpl] One major predator of this lizard is the Rock Kestrel. Research indicates that the higher the UV levels on a male's throat, the more dominant it is and is less likely to be challenged.[tpl]Cite journal | title = Ultraviolet signals fighting ability in a lizard | journal = Biology Letters | year = 2006 | date = 2006-06-22 | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 169â€“72 | author = Stapley, J. and Whiting, M.J. | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2005.0419 | pmid = 17148355 | pmc = 1618919[/tpl]
These flat lizards have been discovered to have a much higher visual sensitivity to UV light than other lizards species, allowing males to accurately distinguish between conspecifics of various fitness. They have as many as three times the number of UV photoreceptor cells in their retina compared to other lizards.Lizards found to send secret signals, Australian Geographic, March 16, 2011. 

==Breeding==

Sexual maturity is reached at around 64 mm for both sexes. Females lay two clutches of eggs in early summer.
