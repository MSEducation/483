==History==

Celtic Football Club was formally constituted at a meeting in St. Mary's church hall in East Rose Street (now Forbes Street), Calton, Glasgow, by Irish Marist Brother Walfrid[tpl]cite book | last = Coogan | first = Tim Pat | title = Wherever Green Is Worn: The Story of the Irish Diaspora | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2002 | page = 250 | isbn = 978-1-4039-6014-6[/tpl] on 6 November 1887, with the purpose of alleviating poverty in the East End of Glasgow by raising money for the charity Walfrid had instituted, the Poor Children's Dinner Table.[tpl]cite book | last = Wagg | first = Stephen |title = British football and social exclusion | publisher=Routledge | year = 2002 | page = 196 | isbn = 978-0-7146-5217-7[/tpl] Walfrid's move to establish the club as a means of fund-raising was largely inspired by the example of Hibernian who were formed out of the immigrant Irish population a few years earlier in Edinburgh. Walfrid's own suggestion of the name 'Celtic' (pronounced Seltik), was intended to reflect the club's Irish and Scottish roots, and was adopted at the same meeting. The club has the official nickname, "The Bhoys". However, according to the Celtic press office, the newly established club was known to many as "the bold boys". A postcard from the early 20th century that pictured the team, and read "The Bould Bhoys", is the first known example of the unique spelling. The extra h imitates the spelling system of Gaelic, where the letter b is often accompanied by the letter h.
On 28 May 1888, Celtic played their first official match against Rangers and won 5–2 in what was described as a "friendly encounter".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.celticfc.net/about_briefhistory |title=Brief History |publisher=Celtic FC |accessdate =19 November 2011[/tpl] Neil McCallum scored Celtic's first ever goal. The squad that played that day was largely composed of players signed from Hibernian.  Celtic's first kit consisted of a white shirt with a green collar, black shorts, and emerald green socks. The original club crest was a simple green cross on a red oval background.
In 1889 Celtic reached the final of the Scottish Cup, this was their first season in the competition, but lost 2–1 in the final. Celtic again reached the final of the Scottish Cup in 1892, but this time were victorious after defeating Queen's Park 5–2 in the final. Several months later the club moved to its new ground, Celtic Park, and in the following season won the Scottish League Championship for the first ever time. In 1895, Celtic set the League record for the highest home score when they beat Dundee 11–0.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/scotland/premier-league/records |title=Scottish Premier League : Records |publisher=Statto Organisation Limited |work=statto.com |accessdate =19 November 2011[/tpl]
In 1897, the club became a Private limited company and Willie Maley was appointed as the first 'secretary-manager'. Between 1905 and 1910, Celtic won the Scottish League Championship six times in a row. In both 1907 and 1908 Celtic also won the Scottish Cup, this was the first time a Scottish club had ever won the Double. During World War I, Celtic won the league four times in a row, including 62 matches unbeaten between November 1915 and April 1917.[tpl]cite web|title=Celtic FC's series of 62 matches unbeaten in Division One|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/unb-celtic-62.html|work=rsssf.com|accessdate=26 May 2012[/tpl]
Ex-player and captain Jimmy McGrory took over in 1945. Under McGrory, Celtic defeated Arsenal, Manchester United and Hibernian to win the Coronation Cup, a one-off tournament held in May 1953 to commemorate the coronation of Elizabeth II.  He also led them to a League and Cup double in 1954.  On 19 October 1957, Celtic defeated Rangers a record 7–1 in the final of the Scottish League Cup at Hampden Park in Glasgow, retaining the trophy they had won for only the first time the previous year. The scoreline remains a record win in a British domestic cup final.
Former Celtic captain Jock Stein succeeded McGrory in 1965. Stein guided Celtic to nine straight Scottish League wins from 1966 to 1974, equalling the then world record, and a feat which was not matched again in Scotland until 1997.  He won the Scottish Cup with Celtic in his first few months at the club, and then led them to the League title the following season.
1967 was Celtic's annus mirabilis. The club won every competition they entered: the Scottish League, the Scottish Cup, the Scottish League Cup, the Glasgow Cup, and the European Cup. Under the leadership of Stein, the club defeated Inter Milan 2–1 at the Estádio Nacional in Lisbon, on 25 May 1967. Celtic thus became the first British team, and the first from outside Spain, Portugal and Italy to win the competition. They remain the only Scottish team to have reached the final. The players that day subsequently became known as the "Lisbon Lions". Jimmy Johnstone, Bobby Lennox and Bobby Murdoch formed part of that famous team, and now rank among the greatest ever Celtic players. The following year Celtic lost to Racing Club of Argentina in the Intercontinental Cup.
Celtic reached the European Cup Final again in 1970, but were beaten 2–1 by Feyenoord at the San Siro in Milan.  The club continued to dominate Scottish football in the early 1970s, and their Scottish Championship win in 1974 was their ninth consecutive league title, equaling the joint world record held at the time by MTK Budapest and CSKA Sofia.[tpl]cite web |url=http://programmes.stv.tv/the-football-years/1973-74/the-full-story/231957-the-full-story-celtics-nine-in-a-row-brian-scott/ |title=The Football Years: Celtic's Nine in a Row |publisher=STV |date=30 October 2009 |accessdate=5 December 2013[/tpl] Celtic enjoyed further domestic success in the 1980s, and in their Centenary season of 1987–88 won a Scottish League Championship and Scottish Cup double.
The club endured a slump in the early 1990s, culminating in the Bank of Scotland informing Celtic on 3 March 1994 that it was calling in the receivers as a result of the club exceeding a £5 million overdraft. However, expatriate businessman Fergus McCann wrested control of the club, and ousted the family dynasties which had controlled Celtic since its foundation. According to media reports, McCann took over the club minutes before it was to be declared bankrupt.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/celtic/6469284/Celtic-chairman-John-Reid-pledges-to-keep-the-clubs-finances-under-control.html |title=Celtic chairman John Reid pledges to keep the club's finances under control |publisher=The Telegraph |date=30 October 2009 |accessdate=23 July 2011[/tpl] McCann reconstituted the club business as a public limited company – Celtic PLC – and oversaw the redevelopment of Celtic Park into a 60,832 all-seater stadium.

==Crest and colours==

For Celtic's first season they wore a white top with black shorts and black and green hooped socks. This kit featured a green Celtic cross inside a red circle. Next season they changed to a green and white vertically striped top and for the next fourteen years this remained unchanged. In 1903 Celtic adopted their famous green and white hooped tops.Celtic Historical Football Kits

==Stadium==

Celtic's stadium is Celtic Park, which is in the Parkhead area of Glasgow. Celtic Park, an all-seater stadium with a capacity of 60,832, is the largest football stadium in Scotland and the seventh-largest stadium in the United Kingdom, after Murrayfield, Old Trafford, Twickenham, Wembley, the London 2012 Olympic Stadium and the Millennium Stadium. It is commonly known as Parkhead[tpl]cite news   | url =  http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/spl/2011/11/11/former-celtic-star-urges-old-firm-to-sell-stadium-names-to-save-clubs-86908-23553514/ | title =  Former Celtic star urges Old Firm to sell stadium names to save clubs  | publisher = Trinity Mirror| work= Daily Record | date =   11 November 2011|first=Craig|last=Swan | accessdate =11 November 2011[/tpl] or Paradise.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scottishgrounds.co.uk/celtic.htm |accessdate=9 November 2011 |title=Celtic|publisher=Duncan Adams|work=Scottish Football Ground Guide[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/club=31002/index.html|title=Celtic spirit shines on|work=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=11 November 2011[/tpl]

The terraces were covered and floodlights were installed between 1957 and 1971. The Taylor Report mandated that all major clubs should have an all-seated stadium by August 1994.[tpl]harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=433[/tpl] Celtic was in a bad financial position in the early 1990s and no major work was carried out until Fergus McCann took control of the club in March 1994. He carried out a plan to demolish the old terraces and develop a new stadium in a phased rebuild, which was completed in August 1998. The total cost of the new stadium was £40 million.
For the 1994–95 season Celtic played at the national stadium Hampden Park, this cost the club £500,000 in rent.[tpl]harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=434[/tpl] Celtic Park has often been used as a venue for Scotland internationals and Cup Finals, particularly when Hampden Park has been unavailable.[tpl]cite web|url=http://londonhearts.com/scotland/misc/venues.html|title=Scotland Home Record by Venue|work=londonhearts.com|publisher=London Hearts Supporters' Club|year=2004|accessdate=12 November 2011[/tpl] Before the First World War, Celtic Park hosted various other sporting events, including composite rules shinty-hurling,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0084/ |title=The first combined shinty/hurling match 1897|publisher=BBC Scotland|work=A Sporting Nation|date=November 2005|accessdate=8 November 2011[/tpl] track and field and the 1897 Track Cycling World Championships.
