==History==

Cape Town International Airport was opened in 1954, a year after Jan Smuts Airport (now OR Tambo International Airport) on the Witwatersrand opened. The airport replaced Cape Town's previous airport, Wingfield Aerodrome. Originally called D.F. Malan Airport after the then South African prime minister, it initially offered two international flights: a direct flight to Britain and a second flight to Britain via Johannesburg.[tpl]cite book |title=Cape Town in the twentieth century: an illustrated social history |last=Bickford-Smith |first=Vivian |authorlink= |coauthors=E.

With the fall of apartheid in the early 1990s, ownership of the airport was transferred from the state to the newly formed Airports Company South Africa,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.acsa.co.za/home.asp?pid=67 |title=ACSA – History |publisher=Airports Company South Africa |accessdate=28 December 2009[/tpl] and the airport was renamed to the politically neutral Cape Town International Airport.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cape-townairport.co.za/ |title=Cape Town Airport (CPT) Information – Airports Guide to Cape Town |publisher=airports-guides.com |accessdate=28 December 2009[/tpl] The first years of the twenty-first century saw tremendous growth at the airport; from handling 6.2 million passengers per annum in 2004-05, the airport peaked at 8.4 million passengers per annum in 2007-08 before falling back to 7.8 million in 2008-09.
In preparation for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Cape Town International Airport was extensively expanded and renovated. The main focus was the development of a Central Terminal Building at a cost of R1.6 billion,[tpl]cite news |title=New terminal hailed as a success |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=13&art_id=vn20091108075550577C968736 |first=Zara |last=Nicholson |newspaper=Sunday Argus |publisher=IOL |date=8 November 2009 |accessdate=28 December 2009 [/tpl] which linked the formerly separate domestic and international terminals and provided a common check-in area.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.acsa.co.za/home.asp?pid=3785 |title=ACSA – New Developments |publisher=Airports Company South Africa |accessdate=28 December 2009[/tpl] The departures level of the Central Terminal opened in November 2009, with the entire building opened in April 2010.

==Future development==

Apart from completion of the 2010 expansion project, it has been proposed that a second runway for large aircraft be constructed at Cape Town International Airport. An expected date for construction of the second runway has yet to be determined.[tpl]cite news |title=Cape Town airport may get second runway |publisher=IOL |date=25 January 2002 |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?sf=124&set_id=1&click_id=13&art_id=ct20020125101000823B510966 |accessdate=28 December 2009 [/tpl]

==Terminal information==

The terminal building has a split-level design, with departures located in the upper floors and arrivals in the lower floors; an elevated roadway system provides vehicular access to both departures and arrivals levels. All check-in takes place within the Central Terminal Building, which contains 120 check-in desks and 20 self-service kiosks. Passengers then pass through a consolidated security screening area before dividing, with international passengers heading north towards the international terminal (which contains immigration facilities), and domestic passengers heading south towards the domestic terminal.
The terminal contains 10 air bridges, evenly split between domestic and international usage. Sections of lower levels of the domestic and international terminals are used for transporting passengers via bus to and from remotely parked aircraft.
Arriving passengers collect luggage in the old sections of their respective terminals, before proceeding through new passageways to the new Central Terminal Building. The terminal contains an automated baggage handling system, capable of handling 30,000 bags per hour.
Retail outlets are located on the lower (arrivals) level of the terminal at landside, as well as airside at the departure gates. Retail outlets are diverse, including foreign exchange services, bookstores, clothing retailers, grocery stores, souvenir outlets and duty-free in international departures. Restaurants within the terminal building are located on the upper (3rd) level above the departures level, which includes what is purported to be the largest Spur restaurant on the African continent, at [tpl]convert|1080|m2|sqft|abbr=on[/tpl]. The restaurant level overlooks the airside of the terminal, where a glass curtain wall separates the patrons from the planes 3 storeys below.
