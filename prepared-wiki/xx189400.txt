==Professional career==

===Green Bay Packers===

Haynos was invited to and attended the 2008 NFL Combine; however, he went unselected in the Draft. Some had predicted the "huge player...hard worker and tough competitor... lumbering tight end"[tpl]Citation |last=West |first=Jeff |date= March 24, 2008|title=Joey Haynos |work=Consensus Draft Services |url=http://cdsdraft.com/profile.php?id=1037[/tpl] would be a late round selection while receiving comparisons to Ben Utecht.[tpl]Citation |last=NFLDraftScout.com |date= March 2, 2008|title=Joey Haynos Analysis|work=NFL.com |url=http://www.nfl.com/draft/2008/profiles/joey-haynos?id=250#player-profile-tab-set-1:player-profile-tab-analysis[/tpl]  He was signed by the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent on May 2, 2008. Haynos was signed to the Packers' practice squad on August 31, 2008.

===Miami Dolphins===

Miami signed Haynos on September 24, 2008 off the Green Bay Packersâ€™ practice squad. Behind David Martin and Anthony Fasano at tight end, Haynos had a reserve role most of the season. His first catch of his career came in week 15 against the San Francisco 49ers. It was a 19-yard touchdown from a pass thrown by Chad Pennington. It was his penultimate reception of a quiet rookie season. The other was a 3-yard catch in a week 17 win against the Jets.
Haynos saw much more playing time in his second year as a NFL player. Starting eight games, he split most of the tight end production with Fasano as quarterback Chad Henne became starter in week 4. Throughout the season, he compiled 162 receiving yards on 19 catches with two touchdowns.
After making a first down catch during the third preseason game versus the Atlanta Falcons, Haynos was helped up and carried off the field onto a waiting cart. He was later diagnosed with a foot injury, and was waived/injured by the Dolphins the following Monday.http://nfl.fanhouse.com/2010/08/30/dolphins-cut-injured-te-joey-haynos/
