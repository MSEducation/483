The Front for Democracy in Burundi ([tpl]lang-fr|link=no|Front pour la Démocratie au Burundi[/tpl], FRODEBU) is a Hutu progressive political party in Burundi.
It was formed by followers of Melchior Ndadaye from the disbanded Burundi Workers' Party in 1986. FRODEBU was legalized as a political party in 1992.
In 1993, FRODEBU won power in Burundi. The election of the Hutu government triggered violence between Hutu and Tutsi militias, and the President was assassinated. In retaliation, FRODEBU killed 25 000 Tutsi. Tutsi responded with an outbreak of violence against Hutus and killed civilians in retaliation. The violence was on a smaller scale then the mass genocide occurring in Rwanda where Hutu were massacring Tutsi.
