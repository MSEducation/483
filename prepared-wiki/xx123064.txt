==History==

Though the island was populated by the Taino Indians 500 years ago and was once the home of a 19th century sisal plantation and a thriving cattle industry, East Caicos Island is currently uninhabited.[tpl]why|date=December 2013[/tpl] The cave paintings, the ruins of the town of Jacksonville and abandoned railroad are the only remnants of its former inhabitants. In 2004 a marine archeology expedition found the wreckage of a ship off the island. Both the Enterprize and Trouvadore, illegal Spanish slavers, had gone down in this area, in 1837 and 1841, respectively. One hundred-ninety-two captive Africans survived the Trouvadore sinking and were helped by British colonists to resettle as free persons, mostly on Grand Turk Island, with 24 taken to Nassau.Nigel Sadler, "The Sinking of the Slave Ship Trouvadore: Linking the Past to the Present", Underwater and Maritime Archaeology in Latin America and the Caribbean, edited by Margaret E Leshikar-Denton, Pilar Luna Erreguerena, Left Coast Press, 2008, pp. 210-212
