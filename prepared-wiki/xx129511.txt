[[International Linguistics Olympiad]]

CATEGORIES: Linguistics, International Science Olympiad

The International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL) is one of the newest in a group of twelve International Science Olympiads. Its abbreviation IOL is deliberately chosen not to correspond to the name of the organization in any particular language, and member organizations are free to choose for themselves how to designate the competition in their own language.IOL official website This olympiad furthers the fields of mathematical, theoretical, and descriptive linguistics.

==Format==

The setup differs from other Science Olympiads, in that the program contains both individual and team contests. The individual contest consists of 5 problems, covering the main fields of theoretical, mathematical and applied linguistics – phonetics, morphology, semantics, etc. – which must be solved in six hours.
The team contest has consisted of one extremely difficult and time-consuming problem since the 2nd IOL. Teams, which generally consist of four students, are given three to four hours to solve this problem.
Like all International Science Olympiads, its problems are translated and completed in several languages and as such must be written free of any native language constraints. In practice, this is often difficult and competitors may gain some advantage if they are familiar with one or more of the language groups which are the subject of some of the assignments. However, the most helpful ability is analytic and deductive thinking, as all solutions must include clear reasoning and justification (as in solving mathematical problems).

==History==

The first linguistic olympiad for secondary school students was organised in 1965 in Moscow, Russia, on the initiative of Alfred Zhurinsky (1938–1991), eventually a prominent philologist but then only a fifth-year student of linguistics, in an organizing committee chaired by the mathematician Vladimir Andreevich Uspensky and with the participation of the linguists Alexander Kibrik, Anna Polivanova and Andrey Zaliznyak.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uklo.org/about/history/background|title=International history|publisher=United Kingdom Linguistics Olympiad|accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl] It was held regularly until 1982 and resumed again in 1988.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.philol.msu.ru/~otipl/new/main/mol/sum-2003-en.php?page=0|title=First International Olympiad in Linguistics (2003)|publisher=Department of Theoretical and Applied Linguistics, Moskow State University|accessdate=September 8, 2012[/tpl] Similar olympiads were founded in Bulgaria (1984), Oregon, USA (1988)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu/history.html|title=History of Linguistic Challenges|publisher=North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad|accessdate=September 8, 2012[/tpl] and Saint Petersburg, Russia (1995). Since the foundation of the Bulgarian olympiad, teams of winners of the Moscow Linguistic Olympiad have successfully competed in Bulgaria and vice versa, demonstrating good potential for international cooperation in the field.
