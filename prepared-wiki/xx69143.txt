Leominster ([tpl]IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-Leominster.ogg|ˈ|l|ɛ|m|s|t|ər[/tpl] [tpl]respell|LEM|stər[/tpl]) ([tpl]lang-cy|Llanllieni[/tpl]) is a market town in Herefordshire, England, and is located at the confluence of the River Lugg and its tributary the River Kenwater, approximately [tpl]convert|12|mi|km[/tpl] north of the city of Hereford and [tpl]convert|11|mi|km[/tpl] south of Ludlow. With a population of approximately 11,700 people, it is the largest of the five towns in the county that surround the City of Hereford.
From 1974 to 1996, Leominster served as the administrative centre for the former local government district of Leominster District.

==Toponymy==

The town takes its name from a minster, that is a community of clergy in the district of Lene or Leon, probably in turn from an Old Welsh root lei to flow.J. & C. Hillaby, Leominster Minster, Priory, and Borough c.660-1539 (Logaston Press, Almeley, Herefs. 2006), 4-5.  Contrary to certain reports, the name has nothing to do with Leofric, an 11th-century Earl of Mercia (most famous for being the miserly husband of Lady Godiva). The Welsh name for Leominster, still used today on the Welsh side of the nearby border, is Llanllieni.

==History==

During the Early Middle Ages, Leominster was home to Æthelmod of Leominster, a  Catholic Saxon saint  known to history mainly through the hagiography of the Secgan Manuscript.Stowe MS 944, British Library He is reputedly buried in Leominster.
According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a raid by Gruffudd ap Llywelyn on Leominster in 1052 resulted in the Battle of Llanllieni, between the Welsh and a combined force of Normans and English Saxons.[tpl]cite book| url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5jtC1mWM86AC&pg=PA156 | page=156 | title= Land of My Fathers: 2000 Years of Welsh History | first= Gwynfor | last= Evans | publisher	= Y Lolfa | year= 1974 | isbn=9780862432652[/tpl]
Henry II bestowed the minster and its estates on Reading Abbey, which founded a priory at Leominster in 1121, although there was one here from Saxon times.Hillaby, 53-7 Its Priory Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, which now serves as the parish church, is the remaining part of this 12th-century Benedictine monastery. Quatrefoil piers were inserted between 1872–79 by Sir George Gilbert Scott.The Buildings of England: Herefordshire, Nikolaus Pevsner, (1963) p226 ISBN 0-14-071025-6
The priory was ransacked by the Welsh forces of Owain Glyndŵr after their victory at the Battle of Bryn Glas near Pilleth in 1402, along with several local manor houses.
Investigations to the north of the priory in 2005 located the position of the cloister, although most of the stone had been stolen following the Dissolution. Discarded animal bones found on the site when submitted to carbon dating showed that the area was occupied in the 7th century. This agrees with the date of 660 CE associated with the founding myth, which suggests a Christian community was established here by a monk, St. Edfrid, from Northumberland.
Leominster is also the historical home of Ryeland sheep, a breed once famed for its "Lemster" [tpl]sic[/tpl] wool, known as 'Lemster ore'. This wool was prized above all other English wool in trade with the continent of Europe in the Middle Ages. It was the income and prosperity from this wool trade that established the town and the minster and attracted the envy of the Welsh and other regions.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]
From approximately 1748 to 1754, Pinsley Mill in Leominster was home to one of the Paul-Wyatt cotton mills, the first four cotton mills in the world, employing the spinning machines of Lewis Paul and John Wyatt.[tpl]cite book|last1=Wadsworth|first1=Alfred P.|last2=Mann|first2=Julia De Lacy|year=1931|title=The Cotton Trade and Industrial Lancashire, 1600-1780|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5NVRAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA433|pages=433–448|location=Manchester|publisher=Manchester University Press[/tpl] The mill was financed by Lancashire native Daniel Bourn, and was partly owned by other men from Lancashire.  Bourn introduced his own version of the carding engine to work at this mill, and of the four Paul-Wyatt mills, it may have been the most successful, as shortly after the fire that destroyed the mill, it was reported that the cotton works "had been viewed with great pleasure and admiration by travellers and all who had seen them."Manchester Mercury, reported on 5 November 1754
