When Pac-Man was released, the most popular arcade video games were space shooters, in particular Space Invaders and Asteroids. The most visible minority were sports games that were mostly derivatives of Pong.

==Gameplay==

The player controls Pac-Man through a blue maze, eating pac-dots (also called pellets) and fruit. When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Between some stages one of three intermission animations plays.[tpl]cite web|title=Pac-Man Game|url=http://www.maniacworld.com/pacman.htm|accessdate=13 November 2012[/tpl] Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost and the Pac-Man itself withers and dies. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Pac-Man is awarded a single bonus life at 10,000 points by default—DIP switches inside the machine can change the required points or disable the bonus life altogether.
Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses. In later stages, the enemies go straight to flashing, bypassing blue, which means that they can only be eaten for a short amount of time, although they still reverse direction when a power pellet is eaten; in even later stages, the ghosts do not become edible (i.e., they do not change color and still make Pac-Man lose a life on contact), but they still reverse direction.

===Enemies===

The enemies in Pac-Man are known as "ghosts" or "monsters".[tpl]citation|title="Pac-Man" in The Arcade Flyer Archive|url=http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=765&image=2|year=1980|publisher=Midway Manufacturing Co. |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6LVO14e9K |archivedate=November 30, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=What is Pacman?|url=http://pacman.com/en/about|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101128063459/http://pacman.com/en/about|archivedate=2010-11-28|work=Pacman.com|publisher=Namco|accessdate=July 14, 2010[/tpl]  Despite the seemingly random nature of the enemies, their movements are strictly deterministic, which players have used to their advantage. In an interview, creator Tōru Iwatani stated that he had designed each enemy with its own distinct personality in order to keep the game from becoming impossibly difficult or boring to play.[tpl]cite journal|last=Mateas|first=Michael|title=Expressive AI: Games and Artificial Intelligence|url=http://www.lcc.gatech.edu/~mateas/publications/MateasDIGRA2003.pdf|year=2003|journal=Proceedings of Level Up: Digital Games Research Conference, Utrecht, Netherlands|format=PDF[/tpl]  More recently, Iwatani described the enemy behaviors in more detail at the 2011 Game Developers Conference. He stated that the red ghost chases Pac-Man, and the pink and blue ghosts try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man's mouth.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=News Headlines |publisher=CNBC |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl]  Although he claimed that the orange ghost's behavior is random, a careful analysis of the game's code reveals that it actually chases Pac-Man most of the time, but also moves toward the lower-left corner of the maze when it gets close to Pac-Man.

===Split-screen===

Pac-Man was designed to have no ending – as long as the player keeps at least one life, he or she should be able to play the game indefinitely. However, a bug keeps this from happening: Normally, no more than seven fruit are displayed at the bottom of the screen at any given time. But when the internal level counter, which is stored in a single byte (8 bits), reaches 255, the subroutine that draws the fruit erroneously "rolls over" this number to zero, causing it to try to draw 256 fruit instead of the usual seven.
This corrupts the bottom of the screen and the entire right half of the maze with seemingly random symbols and tiles, making it impossible to eat enough dots to beat the level. Because this effectively ends the game, this "split-screen" level is often referred to as the "kill screen". Emulators and code analysis have revealed what would happen should this 256th level be cleared: The fruit and intermissions would restart at level 1 conditions, but the enemies would retain their higher speed and invulnerability to power pellets from the higher stages.[tpl]cite web|title = Pac-Man's Split-screen level analyzed and fixed|author=Don Hodges|accessdate =April 29, 2008|url = http://www.donhodges.com/how_high_can_you_get2.htm[/tpl]

===Perfect play===

A perfect Pac-Man game occurs when the player achieves the maximum possible score on the first 255 levels (by eating every possible dot, power pellet, fruit, and enemy) without losing a single life, and then scoring as many points as possible in the last level.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oafe.net/yo/pacplu.php |title=Pac-Man review at OAFE |publisher=Oafe.net |accessdate=2012-09-15[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Ramsey|first=David|title=The Perfect Man|url=http://www.oxfordamericanmag.com/content.cfm?ArticleID=58&Entry=Home|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080229043301/http://www.oxfordamericanmag.com/content.cfm?ArticleID=58&Entry=Home|archivedate=2008-02-29|publisher=Oxford American|accessdate=13 November 2012[/tpl] As verified by the Twin Galaxies International Scoreboard on July 3, 1999, the first person to achieve this maximum possible score (3,333,360 points) was Billy Mitchell of Hollywood, Florida, who performed the feat in about six hours.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx?c=22&pi=2&gi=3229&vi=3365|title = Pac-Man at the Twin Galaxies Official Scoreboard|publisher=Twin Galaxies|accessdate =July 22, 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060523220516/http%3A//www.twingalaxies.com/index.aspx%3Fc%3D22%26pi%3D2%26gi%3D3229%26vi%3D3365 |archivedate = May 23, 2006|deadurl=yes[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl]
In September 2009, David Race of Beavercreek, Ohio, became the sixth person to achieve a perfect score. His time of 3 hours, 41 minutes, and 22 seconds set a new record for the fastest time to obtain a perfect score.Twin Galaxies Announces New All Time Pac-Man Champion, Twin Galaxies, September 11, 2009
In December 1982, an 8-year-old boy, Jeffrey R. Yee, supposedly received a letter from U.S. President Ronald Reagan congratulating him on a worldwide record of 6,131,940 points, a score only possible if he had passed the unbeatable Split-Screen Level. In September 1983, Walter Day, chief scorekeeper at Twin Galaxies, took the US National Video Game Team on a tour of the East Coast to visit video game players who claimed they could get through the Split-Screen Level. No video game player could demonstrate this ability. In 1999, Billy Mitchell offered $100,000 to anyone who could pass through the Split-Screen Level before January 1, 2000. The prize was never claimed.

==Development==

The game was developed primarily by a young Namco employee named Tōru Iwatani over the course of a year, beginning in April 1979, employing a nine-man team. It was based on the concept of eating, and the original Japanese title was [tpl]nihongo|Pakkuman|パックマン[/tpl], inspired by the Japanese onomatopoeic slang phrase [tpl]nihongo|paku-paku taberu|パクパク食べる[/tpl],[tpl]cite web|title=Top 25 Smartest Moves in Gaming|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/25smartest/index6.shtml|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090218003840/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/25smartest/index6.shtml|archivedate=2009-02-18|publisher=Gamespy.com|accessdate=July 26, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite book | author=Kohler, Chris | title = Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life | publisher=Brady Games|year = 2005|isbn=0-7440-0424-1 |authorlink= Chris Kohler[/tpl] where paku-paku describes (the sound of) the mouth movement when widely opened and then closed in succession.[tpl]cite web | title=Daijisen Dictionary entry for ぱくぱく (paku-paku), in Japanese | accessdate =January 27, 2007|url=http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&p=%E3%81%B1%E3%81%8F%E3%81%B1%E3%81%8F&dtype=0&dname=0na&stype=0&pagenum=1&index=14705600[/tpl]
Although Iwatani has repeatedly stated that the character's shape was inspired by a pizza missing a slice, he admitted in a 1986 interview that this was a half-truth and the character design also came from simplifying and rounding out the Japanese character for mouth, kuchi ([tpl]lang|ja|口[/tpl]).[tpl]cite book |last= Lammers |first= Susan M. |others= |title= Programmers at Work: Interviews |year= 1986 |page=266 |publisher=Microsoft Press |location= New York |isbn= 0-914845-71-3 |url=http://www.pacmanmuseum.com/history/Toru-atwork.php[/tpl] Iwatani attempted to appeal to a wider audience—beyond the typical demographics of young boys and teenagers. His intention was to attract girls to arcades because he found there were very few games that were played by women at the time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=2011-03-03 |accessdate=2014-04-06[/tpl] This led him to add elements of a maze, as well as cute ghost enemy characters. Eating to gain power, Iwatani has said, was a concept he borrowed from Popeye.[tpl]cite web|title=THE COLLECTION: SELECTED WORKS FROM APPLIED DESIGN; Pac-Man |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O:TA:E:AppliedDesign&page_number=1&template_id=1&sort_order=1|publisher=MoMA |accessdate=March 4, 2013[/tpl] The result was a game he named Puck Man[tpl]cite news|author=Kohler, Chris|title=Q&A: Pac-Man Creator Reflects on 30 Years of Dot-Eating|url=http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2010/05/pac-man-30-years/|work=Wired|accessdate=July 15, 2010|authorlink=Chris Kohler|date=May 21, 2010[/tpl] as a reference to the main character's hockey puck shape.
Later in 1980, the game was picked up for manufacture in the United States by Bally division Midway,  which changed the game's name from Puck Man to Pac-Man in an effort to avoid vandalism from people changing the letter 'P' into an 'F' to form the word fuck.Kent, Steve. Ultimate History of Video Games, p.142. "Before Namco showed Pac-Man to Midway, one change was made to the game. Pac-Man was originally named Puck-Man, a reference to the puck-like shape of the main character. Nakamura worried about American vandals changing the "P" to an "F." To prevent any such occurrence, he changed the name of the game."[tpl]cite web|publisher=Kotaku|title=This Guy Has a Rare Arcade Cabinet. Is It Real?|author=Brian Ashcraft|url=http://kotaku.com/5853782/this-guy-has-a-rare-arcade-cabinet-is-it-real/gallery/1[/tpl] The cabinet artwork was also changed and the pace and level of difficulty increased to appeal to western audiences.

==Impact and legacy==

When first launched in Japan by Namco in 1980, the game received a lukewarm response, as Space Invaders and other similar games were more popular at the time. However, the game found far more success in North America. Pac-Man[tpl]'[/tpl]s success in North America took competitors and distributors completely by surprise in 1980. Marketing executives who saw Pac-Man at a trade show prior to release completely overlooked the game (along with the now classic Defender), while they looked to a racing car game called Rally-X as the game to outdo that year.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.classicgaming.com/rotw/defender.shtml | author=Bowen, Kevin | title = Game of the Week: Defender | publisher=ClassicGaming.com | year = 2001 | accessdate =August 17, 2006[/tpl] The appeal of Pac-Man was such that the game caught on immediately with the public; it quickly became far more popular than anything seen in the game industry up to that point.

===Remakes and sequels===

Pac-Man is one of the few games to have been consistently published for over three decades, having been remade on numerous platforms and spawned many sequels. Re-releases include ported and updated versions of the original arcade game. Numerous unauthorized Pac-Man clones appeared soon after its release. The combined sales of counterfeit arcade machines sold nearly as many units as the original Pac-Man, which had sold more than 300,000 machines.[tpl]cite web|title=The History of Video Games|url=http://serialkiller.org/articles/videogames_history/videogames_history.pdf|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=March 14, 2012|author=Leonard Herman, Jer Horwitz, Steve Kent, Skyler Miller|page=7|year=2002[/tpl]
One of the first ports to be released was the much-maligned port for the Atari 2600, which only somewhat resembled the original and was widely criticized for its flickering ghosts, due to the 2600's limited memory and hardware compared to the arcade machine.[tpl]Cite news  | title=Creating a World of Clones  | newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer  | page=16  |date=October 9, 1983[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal  | last = Thompson  | first = Adam  | title = The King of Video Games is a Woman  | journal=Creative Computing Video and Arcade Games  | volume = 1  | issue = 2  | page = 65  | date = Fall 1983  | url = http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n2/mspacman.php  [/tpl][ref][tpl]Cite journal  | last = Ratcliff  | first = Matthew  | title = Classic Cartridges II  | journal=Antic  | volume = 7  | issue = 4  | page = 24  | date = August 1988  | url = http://www.atarimagazines.com/v7n4/classicii.html  [/tpl]

The game was also released for the Apple II series, Atari's 5200 and 8-bit computers, IBM Personal Computer, Intellivision, the Commodore 64 and VIC-20, and the Nintendo Entertainment System. In December 1987, Mindscape's PC game version of Pac-Man sold over 100,000 copies for that month alone.[tpl]cite journal|title=Video Games Are Back|journal=The Bulletin|year=1988|issue=5609–5616|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=rcolT8jYCoOh0QXF8ZnOCg&id=yCMYAQAAIAAJ&dq=%22sold+more+than+100000+copies+of+Pac+Man+for+the+PC+last%22&q=%22sold+more+than+100000+copies+of+Pac+Man+for+the+PC%22#search_anchor|accessdate=January 29, 2012|editor1-first=J.

The game has also been featured in Namco's long-running Namco Museum video game compilations. Downloads of the game have been made available on game services such as Xbox Live Arcade, GameTap and Virtual Console. Namco has also released mobile versions for BREW, Java, and iOS, as well as Palm PDAs and Windows Mobile-based devices.

In addition, Namco has repeatedly re-released the game to arcades. In 2001, Namco released a  Ms. Pac-Man/Galaga "Class of 1981 Reunion Edition" cabinet with Pac-Man available for play as a hidden game. To commemorate Pac-Man[tpl]'[/tpl]s 25th anniversary in 2005, Namco released a revision that officially featured all three games.
Namco Networks ported Pac-Man to the PC (bought online) in 2009 which also includes an "Enhanced" mode which replaces all of the original sprites with the sprites from Pac-Man Championship Edition but it's still the original Pac-Man otherwise, Namco Networks also made a bundle (also bought online) which includes their PC version of Pac-Man as well as their port of Dig Dug called Namco All-Stars: Pac-Man and Dig Dug.
In 2010 Namco Bandai has announced that they are releasing this game on Windows Phone 7 as an Xbox Live game.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bestwp7games.com/a-quick-look-at-some-of-the-new-wp7-games-from-namco.html |title=A quick look at some of the new WP7 games from Namco |date=November 9, 2010 |work=BestWP7Games [/tpl]
Pac-Man's spawned sequels and spin-offs include only one designed by Tōru Iwatani. Some of the follow-ups were not developed by Namco either – including the most significant, Ms. Pac-Man, released in the United States in 1981. Originally called Crazy Otto, this unauthorized hack of Pac-Man was created by General Computer Corporation and sold to Midway without Namco's permission. The game features several changes from the original Pac-Man, including faster gameplay, more mazes, new intermissions, and moving bonus items. Some consider Ms. Pac-Man to be superior to the original or even the best in the entire series. Stan Jarocki of Midway stated that Ms. Pac-Man was conceived in response to the original Pac-Man being "the first commercial videogame to involve large numbers of women as players" and that it is "our way of thanking all those lady arcaders who have played and enjoyed Pac-Man."[tpl]cite journal|last=Worley|first=Joyce|title=Women Join the Arcade Revolution|journal=Electronic Games|date=May 1982|volume=1|issue=3|pages=30–33 33|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1982-05/Electronic_Games_Issue_03_Vol_01_03_1982_May#page/n31/mode/2up|accessdate=February 3, 2012[/tpl] Namco sued Midway for exceeding their license. Eventually, Bally Midway struck a deal with Namco to officially license Ms. Pac-Man as a sequel. Namco today officially owns Ms. Pac-Man in its other releases.
Following Ms. Pac-Man, Bally Midway released several other unauthorized spin-offs, such as Pac-Man Plus, Baby Pac-Man, Jr. Pac-Man, and Professor Pac-Man, resulting in Namco severing business relations with Midway.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.klov.com/M/Ms._Pac-Man.html|title = Ms. Pac-Man|publisher=Killer List of Videogames | accessdate =July 31, 2006[/tpl]
Various platform games based on the series have also been released by Namco, such as 1984's Pac-Land and the Pac-Man World series, which features Pac-Man in a 3-D world. More modern versions of the original game have also been developed, such as the multiplayer Pac-Man Vs. for the Nintendo GameCube.
On June 5, 2007, the first Pac-Man World Championship was held in New York City, which brought together ten competitors from eight countries to play the new Pac-Man Championship Edition developed by Tōru Iwatani.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/06/nyregion/06pacman.html?fta=y | work=The New York Times | title=Run, Gobble, Gobble, Run: Vying for Pac-Man Acclaim | first=Seth | last=Schiesel | date=2007-06-06 | accessdate=2010-05-20[/tpl] Its sequel was released on November 2010.
