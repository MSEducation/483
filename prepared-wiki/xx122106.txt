Duncan Scott Forbes (born 19 June 1941 in Edinburgh) is a Scottish retired former professional footballer.  He spent 33 Years at Norwich City, 13 as a player, seven on the commercial staff and 13 as chief scout.  The Times famously noted his aggressive defending by writing "Forbes got his customary booking; the referee ought to take his name in the changing room rather than on the pitch thus saving time."

==Career==

Forbes joined Colchester United in September 1961 from Scottish non-league side Musselburgh Athletic, making his league debut later that season.  He quickly established himself as a regular in the Layer Road side, playing in two promotion winning teams and two relegation teams over the next 7 years.
In September 1968, after playing 270 league games for Colchester, scoring twice, he moved to Norwich City for a fee of Â£10,000.  At Carrow Road, he helped the Canaries into Division One, and in 1970 he was voted the fourth winner of the Barry Butler Trophy, the fans' award for player of the year. He was captain of the Norwich team that won promotion to the first division for the first time in 1972.
In October 1976 he looked to have lost his place and joined Torquay United on loan.  He returned to Carrow Road and won his place back, finishing his Norwich career with 295 league appearances, in which he scored 10 times.  On leaving Norwich he played for Great Yarmouth Town, before joining Diss Town as player-coach.

==Retirement==

Within a year of leaving Carrow Road, he returned, joining the Norwich City commercial staff where he was in charge of Club Canary organising trips to away matches.  In March 1988, he was appointed as Norwich's Chief Scout, a post he held until his retirement in 2001, by which time he had spent 33 almost unbroken years at Carrow Road.
In 2002, Forbes was made an inaugural member of the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame.*Career information at ex-canaries.co.uk
