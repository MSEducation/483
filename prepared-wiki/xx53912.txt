</ref>  Among the Eastern Churches there are varying practices regarding blessing. In some traditions the very act of celebrating the [[Sacred Mysteries]] (Sacrament) is the only blessing necessary; in others, there is a special rite of blessing. In some Eastern traditions this blessing may be done only by a bishop, in some it may be done by a priest. In any case, in both the East and the West, once a chalice has been blessed, it may only be touched by an ordained member of the higher clergy (bishop, priest or deacon). In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] a [[subdeacon]] is permitted to touch the holy vessels, but only if they are wrapped in cloth.

====The Holy Chalice====

In Christian tradition the 'Holy Chalice is the vessel which Jesus used at the Last Supper to serve the wine. New Testament texts make no mention of the cup except within the context of the Last Supper and give no significance whatever to the object itself. Herbert Thurston in the Catholic Encyclopedia 1908 concluded that "No reliable tradition has been preserved to us regarding the vessel used by Christ at the Last Supper. In the sixth and seventh centuries pilgrims to Jerusalem were led to believe that the actual chalice was still venerated in the church of the Holy Sepulchre, having within it the sponge which was presented to Our Saviour on Calvary." Several surviving standing cups of precious materials are identified in local traditions as the Chalice.

====Holy Grail====

An entirely different and pervasive tradition concerns the cup of the Last Supper. In this highly muddled though better-known version, the vessel is known as the Holy Grail. In this legend, Jesus used the cup at the Last Supper to institute the Mass.
Other stories claim that Joseph of Arimathea used the cup to collect and store the blood of Christ at the Crucifixion.

===Unitarian Universalism===

At the opening of Unitarian Universalist worship services, many congregations light a flame inside a chalice.[tpl]Citation | last =Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations | title =Our Symbol: the Flaming Chalice | date =March 1, 2007 | url =http://www.uua.org/visitors/6901.shtml | accessdate =2007-07-19[/tpl] A flaming chalice is the most widely used symbol of Unitarianism and Unitarian Universalism (UU), and the official logo of the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) and other Unitarian and UU churches and societies.Unitarian Universalist Association,"The History of the Flaming Chalice" The design was originated by the artist Hans Deutsch, who took his inspiration from the chalices of oil burned on ancient Greek and Roman altars. It became an underground symbol in occupied Europe during World War II for assistance to help Unitarians, Jews, and other people escape Nazi persecution.[tpl]Citation | last =uuworld.org—liberal religion and life | title =Wartime origins of the flaming chalice | url =http://www.uua.org/visitors/6901.shtml | accessdate =2007-07-19[/tpl] The chalice is often shown surrounded by two linked rings The two linked rings were used as an early symbol for the Unitarian Universalist Association, signifying the joining of Unitarianism and Universalism. There is no standardized interpretation of the flaming chalice symbol. In one interpretation, the chalice is a symbol of religion freedom from the impositions of doctrine by a hierarchy and openness to participation by all; the flame is interpreted as a memorial to those throughout history who sacrificed their lives for the cause of religious liberty. In another interpretation, the flaming chalice resembles a cross, symbolic of the Christian roots of Unitarian Universalism.[tpl]Citation | last =Unitarian Universalist Association | title =The History of the Flaming Chalice | year =2007 | url =http://www.uua.org/aboutuu/chalice.html | accessdate =[/tpl]

===Wicca===

In Wicca a chalice, as a feminine principle, is often used in combination with the Athame (ceremonial black-handled knife), as male principle. Combining the two evokes the act of procreation, as a symbol of universal creativity. This is a symbol of the Great Rite in Wiccan rituals. A chalice is also used in the Small Rite.

===Neo-Paganism===

Some forms of Neo-Paganism make use of chalices in their rituals as well. A chalice may be placed on an altar or on the ground. The chalice may contain wine, whiskey, water, or other liquids.

===Rastafarian===

Rastafaris engage in an activity called reasoning. This reasoning helps them shape attitudes towards "politics, theology, repatriation, and reparation."[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] Participants discuss personal issues, but the focus is on the interaction of individuals and society, as well as issues such as ecology.
Such sessions include supervised use of ganja intended to put participants in touch with peaceful feelings, unity, and "consciousness." Rasta philosophy describes ganja-conscious humans "as the temple of God, within which God dwells."[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] Using ganja is said to "stimulate this inner being through spiritual discourse."
In these sessions, ganga is smoked in joints or in a chalice (Waterpipe or bong), although Rasta witnesses said chalice smokers had to be very "mature and clean-spirited" due to the powerful hits delivered by this unique and potent form of inhalation device.

==Poisoned chalice==

The term "poisoned chalice" is applied to a thing or situation which appears to be good when it is received or experienced by someone, but then becomes or is found to be bad. The idea was referred to by Benedict of Nursia in one of his exorcisms, found on the Saint Benedict Medal: Vade retro Satana! Nunquam suade mihi vana! Sunt mala quae libas. Ipse venena bibas! (Begone Satan! Never tempt me with your vanities! What you offer me is evil. Drink the poison yourself!).

William Shakespeare uses the expression in Act I Scene VII of Macbeth. It occurs in the opening soliloquy of the scene when Macbeth is considering the ramifications of the murder he is plotting.
But in these cases

We still have judgment here; that we but teach

Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return

To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice

Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice

To our own lips.
It's also a term to describe coaching a sports team with a history of winning championships, one feels lucky to manage such a club but then ends up under pressure to win a championship, get a great result within the first year, or they're fired. (For example, teams like Real Madrid, Chelsea and Barcelona or Moyes at Manchester United, where managers have to win a tournament, a league trophy, qualify for Europe, or they're fired within their first year or any year they win nothing.)

==Heraldry==

The use of chalices as heraldic devices is not unusual, especially in ecclesiastical heraldry. A number of cities and regions also make use of the chalice. For instance, the coat of arms of the municipality of Fanas in the district of Prättigau/Davos in the Swiss canton of Graubünden, bears a gold chalice on a solid blue background.

==Other usage==

In French-Canadian culture, particularly in and around Quebec, the use of the names of holy objects such as "câlice" (a variation of calice, which is the French word for chalice) can be an alternate form of cursing. Somewhat equivalent to the American word "goddam" or the phrase "God damn it", the use of "câlice" or "tabarnak" (a variation of tabernacle) as an interjection is not uncommon in Quebec. For example: "Câlice! I forgot to lock the front door" or muttering "tabarnak" under your breath after you get a flat tire. Presumably a derivation of "taking the Lord's name in vain".Gordon, Sean (December 12, 2006). "Quebec swears by its English curses: But church-related expletives spoken in French not accepted on TV". Toronto Star
In Serbo-Croatian, it has coined the word šalica, which means a glass cup.
In 1988, the term "poisoned chalice" became famous when Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran had to accept the UN ceasefire ending the Iran-Iraq War. In his radio announcement, he stated "Happy are those who have lost their lives in this convoy of light...unhappy am I that I still remain and have drunk the poisoned chalice," comparing the acceptance of peace to drinking a cup of poison.
