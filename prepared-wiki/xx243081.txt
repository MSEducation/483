Alberto Muñoz (date of birth unknown) is a retired Mexican Luchador or professional wrestler who was active from at least the 1960s until the 1980s. Muñoz worked for most of his career using his real name, but in the 1970s he also wrestled as the enmascarado (masked wrestler) White Man, teaming with Black Man to form a popular tag team. In his career Muñoz held several top championships promoted by Empressa Mexican de Lucha Libre (EMLL).

==Professional wrestling career==

Muñoz made his professional wrestling debut in the early 1960s and within a couple of years began working regularly for Empressa Mexican de Lucha Libre (EMLL), the oldest wrestling promotion in the world. Initially he wrestled in the lightweight weightdivision, which in Mexico means between [tpl]convert|63|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.ordenjuridico.gob.mx/Estatal/ESTADO%20DE%20MEXICO/Reglamentos/MEXREG004.pdf | format=PDF | title= Reglamento de Box y Lucha Libre Professional del Estado de Mexico | author= Arturo Montiel Rojas | publisher= Comisión de Box y Lucha Libre Mexico D.F. | date= August 30, 2001 | accessdate= July 11, 2009| quote= Articulo 242: "Pluma 63 kilos / Ligero 70 kilos"|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061130181418/http://www.ordenjuridico.gob.mx/Estatal/ESTADO%20DE%20MEXICO/Reglamentos/MEXREG004.pdf|archivedate=November 30, 2006[/tpl] On August 7, 1965 Muñoz defeated Rodolfo Ruíz to win the Mexican National Lightweight Championship. Over the following six months Muñoz defended the title against both the deposed champion and other lightweight contenders. On February 6, 1966 Muñoz moved up to the Welterweight division (between [tpl]convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|78|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]) when he defeated Huracán Ramírez for the Mexican National Welterweight Championship. After winning the Welterweight title Muñoz vacated the Lightweight title to focus on the more prestigious Welterweight division. Muñoz held the Welterweight title from February 6, 1966 until October 20, 1968 for a total of [tpl]age in days|month1=2|day1=6|year1=1966|month2=10|day2=12|year2=1968[/tpl] days, the longest reign of any Mexican National Welterweight Champion to date. On March 9, 1968 Muñoz defeated Rene Guajardo to win the Mexican National Middleweight Championship. Muñoz wrestled in both the Welterweight and the middleweight division (between [tpl]convert|82|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|87|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]), holding and defending both titles for seven months. On October 20, 1968 Muñoz vacated the Welterweight title to focus on the Middleweight title. Muñoz would hold the Middleweight title until November 20, 1969 where Rene Guajado regained the title. Alberto Muñoz held a championship from August 7, 1965 until November 20, 1969, more than four years in total. On July 11, 1971 Muñoz defeated Karloff Lagarde to win the NWA World Welterweight Championship, perhaps the most prestigious championship in Mexico at the time. Muñoz held the title until some time in 1973 where he was forced to vacate the title due to a knee injury. When Muñoz returned to the ring almost a year later he adopted a new ring persona, an enmascarado (masked wrestler) called "White Man", teaming up with Black Man to form a very popular and successful tag team.[tpl]cite news | author = Enciclopedia staff | title = Enciclopedia de las Mascaras | work = Black Man | location = Mexico City, Mexico | id = Tomo I | page = 32 | date = August 2007 | accessdate = October 20, 2009 | language = Spanish[/tpl] The two teamed for a while but never won a tag team title, despite several chances at the Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship.[tpl]cite news | author = Enciclopedia staff | title = Enciclopedia de las Mascaras | work = White Man | location = Mexico City, Mexico | id = Tomo VII | page = 39 | date = December 2007 | accessdate = October 20, 2009 | language = Spanish[/tpl] by 1978 Muñoz dropped the "White Man" character as he was forced to work a reduced schedule due to age and injuries. Muñoz' last notable wrestling appearance came in April, 1979 when he lost a Luchas de Apuesta, hair vs. mask match, to Villano III. Apuesta matches often pay a quite a lot to the person agreeing to lose his hair or mask, giving Muñoz one last big payday before retiring in the early 1980s.
