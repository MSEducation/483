CATEGORIES: Sun Microsystems software, Sun Microsystems hardware

Sun Visualization System was a sharable visualization solution introduced by Sun Microsystems in January 2007.  It used other Sun technologies, including Sun servers, Solaris, Sun Ray Ultra-Thin Clients, and Sun Grid Engine.  The Sun Visualization System software stack was based on several key open source technologies:  Chromium to perform distributed 3D rendering, VirtualGL to re-route 3D rendering jobs to arbitrary graphics devices, and TurboVNC to deliver the rendered 3D images to a client or clients.  Sun sponsored and/or contributed changes back to these projects throughout the life of the Sun Visualization System.
In January 2009, The VirtualGL Project reported that it was no longer being sponsored by Sun Microsystems, and in April 2009, Sun announced that it was discontinuing the Sun Shared Visualization and Sun Scalable Visualization products.  Customers will be able to order the products through July 31, 2009, and service and support will be provided until Oct. 2, 2014.
