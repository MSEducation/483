Major Durga Malla was the first Gorkha soldier of Nepalese origin in Indian National Army (INA) to sacrifice his life for the cause of the nation.[tpl]cite news |title=Parliament honour for Netaji warrior |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1021122/asp/siliguri/story_1404192.asp |work=The Telegraph |date=22 November 2002 |accessdate=2008-10-14 [/tpl]
Major Malla was born in July 1913 at Doiwala near Dehradun from Nepali parents. He was the eldest son of Nb Sub Ganga Malla. In 1930, when Mahatma Gandhi was leading the countrymen for Independence through Dandi March, Malla was in class nine. Though he was young, he caught everybody’s attention by his outbursts in public against the Britishers. In 1931, when he was 18 years-old, he moved to Dharamsala and got enrolled in 2/1 Gorkha Rifles. His patriotism brought him close to INA.
In 1942, Malla joined INA. His devotion to duty and valour coupled with other skills elevated him to the rank of a Major in INA and was asked to work in the intelligence wing of the INA. When he was collecting information about the enemy camps, he was caught in action at Kohima on March 27, 1944. He was given death sentence by the Court of Trial at Red Fort, New Delhi. However, before the death sentence was finally executed, the authorities tried to coerce Major Durga Malla into confessing sedition. His wife was brought at the prison cell but Malla did not succumb to the pressure. “The sacrifice I am offering shall not go in vain. India will be free. I am confident. This is only a matter of time, Sharda! Don’t worry, crores of Hindustanis are with you”, said Malla to his wife. Those were his last words to his wife.
Malla was married to Sharda Malla of Shyam Nagar, Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh in 1941. Only three days after marriage, Malla was recalled at his headquarters and was directed to go abroad. He could meet his wife only before his hanging at Delhi District Jail. In 1944, Major Durga Malla was sent to the gallows.[tpl]cite book |title=Sikkim, Perspectives and Vision |last=Chamling |first=Pawan |year=2003 |publisher=Indus Publishing |isbn=978-81-7387-140-5 |pages=353 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=D15liv9RDloC&pg=PA353&dq=%22Durga+Malla%22&num=100&sig=ACfU3U2O62RIVHUTvEQyjK92Fn8Vry4EgQ |accessdate=2008-10-14[/tpl]
