[[Trema (genus)]]

CATEGORIES: Trema

Trema is a genus of about 15 species of evergreen trees closely related to the hackberries (Celtis), occurring in subtropical and tropical regions of southern Asia, northern Australasia, Africa, South and Central America, and parts of North America.[tpl]cite web |url=http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=TRMI2&mapType=nativity&photoID=trmi2_001_ahp.tif |title=Trema micrantha (L.) Blume Jamaican nettletree |work=The PLANTS Database |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |accessdate=2009-10-06[/tpl] They are generally small trees, reaching [tpl]convert|10|-|20|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] tall.
Previously included either in the elm family, Ulmaceae, or with Celtis in the Celtidaceae, genetic analysis has shown the Celtidaceae are best placed in the hemp family, Cannabaceae.[tpl]Citation |last=Sytsma |first=Kenneth J. |last2=Morawetz |first2=Jeffery |last3=Pires |first3=J.

The leaves are alternate, simple, [tpl]convert|7|-|15|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] long, ovate-acuminate to lanceolate with a long pointed tip, and evenly serrated margins. The fruit is a small drupe [tpl]convert|3|-|5|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in diameter.
Trema species are sometimes used as food plants by the larvae of hepialid moths of the genera Aenetus, including A. splendens, which burrow horizontally into the trunk then vertically down, and Endoclita, including E. malabaricus.
Trema orientalis is widely planted for land reclamation in Southern Asia, valued for its tolerance of poor soils due to its ability to fix Nitrogen. It is also an invasive species on some Pacific Ocean islands.
