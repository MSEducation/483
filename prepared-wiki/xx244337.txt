CATEGORIES: Neighbourhoods in Toronto

Wallace Emerson is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada situated north of Bloor Street between Dufferin Street to the east, the CPR railway lines to the north and the CPR railway lines to the west.
The neighbourhood derives its name from the intersection of Wallace Avenue and Emerson Avenue near the centre of the community.

==Character==

The neighbourhood contains a mixture of land-uses. The main thoroughfare of Bloor Street consists almost exclusively of mixed-use residential and commercial buildings. The Bloordale Village BIA encompasses the stretch from Lansdowne to Dufferin.
The residential area north of Bloor Street is primarily single-family dwellings. Many of these structures have been converted into apartments, housing up to eight separate units. Side-streets increase in zoned density as they approach Bloor. Low and medium-rise apartments occupy the majority of these zones. 
To the north, between Dupont and Davenport, is mainly post-industrial development. Limited manufacturing remains, although some warehouse and light automotive industries still exist. While the Canadian Pacific Railway operates a main line between the two thoroughfares, a large amount of former industrial space has been converted to loft condominia. Some single-family rowhouses and low-income rental space has also been created.
The largest shopping centre within the Wallace Emerson boundaries is the Galleria Mall, which opened in 1972.
