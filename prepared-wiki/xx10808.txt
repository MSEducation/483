===Fermentation-produced chymosin (FPC)===

Because of the above imperfections of microbial and animal rennets, many producers sought further replacements of rennet. With the development of genetic engineering, it became possible to extract rennet-producing genes from animal stomach and insert them into certain bacteria, fungi or yeasts to make them produce chymosin during fermentation. The genetically modified microorganism is killed after fermentation and chymosin isolated from the fermentation broth, so that the fermentation-produced chymosin (FPC) used by cheese producers does not contain any GM component or ingredient. FPC is identical with chymosin made by an animal, but is produced in a more efficient way. FPC products have been on the market since 1990 and have been considered in the last 20 years the ideal milk-clotting enzyme.[tpl]cite book|last=Law|first=Barry A.|title=Technology of Cheesemaking|year=2010|publisher=WILEY-BLACKWELL|location=UK|isbn=978-1-4051-8298-0|pages=100–101|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405182989.html[/tpl]

By 2008, approximately 80% to 90% of commercially made cheeses in the US and Britain were made using FPC.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/database/enzymes/83.chymosin.html|publisher=GMO Compass|title=Chymosin|accessdate=2011-03-03[/tpl] Today, the most widely used Fermentation-Produced Chymosin (FPC) is produced either by the fungus Aspergillus niger and commercialized under the trademark CHY-MAX®http://www.chr-hansen.com/products/product-areas/enzymes/our-product-offering.html by the Danish company Chr. Hansen, or produced by Kluyveromyces lactis and commercialized under the trademark MAXIREN®http://www.dsm.com/le/en_US/foodspecialties/html/Products_Maxiren.htm by the Dutch company DSM.
FPC is chymosin B, and is therefore more pure compared with animal rennet, which contains a multitude of proteins. FPC can deliver several benefits to the cheese producer compared with animal or microbial rennet, such as higher production yield, better curd texture and reduced bitterness.
Cheeses produced with FPC can be certified kosherCheeseChymax spec sheet and halal, and are suitable for vegetarians if there was no animal-based alimentation used during the chymosin production in the fermenter.

===Acid coagulation===

Many soft cheeses are produced without use of rennet, by coagulating milk with acid, such as citric acid or vinegar.
Cream cheese, paneer, and rubing are traditionally made this way (see :Category:Acid-set cheeses for others).
The acidification can also come from bacterial fermentation such as in cultured milk.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2010[/tpl]
