==Media and politics==

During the communist regime in Poland the Stalinist press doctrine dominated and controlled Polish media.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sasinska-Klas|first=Teresa|title=The transition of mass media in Poland: The road to liberalization|journal=EJC/REC|year=1994|volume=4|issue=1|url=http://www.cios.org/EJCPUBLIC/004/1/00411.HTML|accessdate=6 October 2013[/tpl] This doctrine aimed at getting the support of people and making Polish people "Soviets". The country instituted freedom of press since the fall of communism. However, public TV and radio are still politically controlled, via a state regulatory body called Krajowa Rada Radiofonii i Telewizji (The National Radio and Television Committee), which is similar to CRTC in Canada. It is said that both public and private media are not impartial, and used as means for political propaganda. Various irregularities have been exposed during the investigation by a special parliamentary committee into the Lew Rywin affair.
