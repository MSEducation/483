Attorneys General in California, New York and Texas simultaneously filed lawsuits ordering USAI to change its marketing plan and sales claims. In response, USAI filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations in 1987. USAI’s deceptive sales and marketing tactics were reviewed in several articles published in 1986-1987.  As Wise was primarily focused on scientific and research matters during his tenure, he was not among those faulted for the company's business woes.[tpl]cite journal  | doi = 10.1056/NEJM198610093151518  | author = Stare, F.J. | coauthors=. | year = 1986 | title = Marketing a nutritional "revolutionary breakthrough".
