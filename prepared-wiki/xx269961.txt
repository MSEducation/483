The Great Depression caused the demise of Union Theatres and Doyle instead established Greater Union Theatres, and its production arm, Cinesound Productions. He appointed his former assistant, Ken G. Hall, to run Cinesound. Financial over-expansion saw Doyle forced out of the company by Norman Rydge and he resigned in June 1937.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17388876 |title=MR. S. F.
