[[RNase D]]

CATEGORIES: Ribonucleases, EC 3.1.13

RNase D is one of the seven exoribonucleases identified in E. coli. It is a 3'-5' exoribonuclease which has been shown to be involved in the 3' processing of various stable RNA molecules. It is known to add the 3' CCA sequence to tRNA in prokaryotic tRNA processing.  RNase D has homologues in many other organisms. When a part of another larger protein has a domain that is very similar to RNase D, this is called an RNase D domain.
