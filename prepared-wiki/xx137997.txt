 Oh, give us pleasure in our lives today

And let us not to think so far away

As we strive so high to reach the sky

And bless the spirit of Kaiser High

The rains fall ever gently on the land

Our footsteps wash away from golden sands

As our dreams in life become our goals

Remember always the Blue and Gold

All hail, hail, Kaiser High

All hail, Kaiser High
