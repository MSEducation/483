[[Conductor tensioner]]

CATEGORIES: Drilling technology, Oilfield terminology

A conductor tensioner unit is installed on an offshore jackup rig to apply upward tension on the conductor. The conductor tensioner is installed into the conductor deck and is usually removable in order to protect the unit during transit.
The drilling conductor is the first and outer tubular which runs from the drilling rig into the seabed. It is usually installed by drilling a hole into the seabed, then running the tubular into the hole and cementing to the seabed. It can also be installed by driving with a pile hammer.
