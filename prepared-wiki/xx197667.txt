===L'écriture infinie===

L'écriture infinie is a work of Bili Bidjocka. It aims to write the biggest collection of handwritten books of the world, because the new technologies causes the progressive extinction and replaces the handwritten writing because .
It consist of a series of books with 6000 white pages, 104 cm long and 100 kg. The artist declares that the public is invited to write - as it was the last thing to do before the cut of a hand. The founder act is the writing act in itself and not the reading after. Each book, once done, is packed into a linen material. The idea is that these books will be opened in the day where writing will not exist anymore.
There is now existing 7 books of the work; one participated at the Venice Biennale inside the exhibition Check List - Luanda Pop.
