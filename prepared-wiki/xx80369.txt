==Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs Leagues Club==

==Statistics and records==

Hazem El Masri holds the NRL record for the most games played for the club, having made 317 appearances in total.
Hazem El Masri also holds records for the most points scored, the most tries scored and the most points scored for the Bulldogs. Since his debut in 1996, he has scored a total of 2,418 points – which is also a competition record for Rugby League in Australia. Former player Daryl Halligan, who retired with the club in 2000, had previously held the competition record for most points scored with 2,034, which included points scored whilst at his former club the North Sydney Bears.
The club's largest win occurred in 1995 when they played as the "Sydney Bulldogs." In a match against the newly formed North Queensland Cowboys, the Bulldogs won 66–4. In the club's first season in 1935 they were subject to the two heaviest defeats in competition history two weeks in succession. Firstly, they lost to St. George 91–6 and the following week to Eastern Suburbs 87–7. However, despite these big losses, the club was able to secure their first premiership 3 years later in 1938 in the Grand Final against Eastern Suburbs; at the same time setting the record for becoming the quickest non-foundation club to win a title. This record was not broken until 1999.
In 2002, the club won 17 matches in a row after getting beaten by New Zealand Warriors; falling just two short of the record set by the Eastern Suburbs team of 1975.
In Round 7 of the 2014 season, after beating the South Sydney Rabbitohs 15-14, the Bulldogs became the first club to win three consecutive matches by 1 point.http://www.examiner.com.au/story/2228671/canterbury-bulldogs-snatch-one-point-win-over-south-sydney-rabbitohs-photos/
