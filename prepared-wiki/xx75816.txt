The College of Engineering (CoE) is one of 14 schools and colleges at the University of California, Berkeley. The College of Engineering as a whole is ranked third in the nation, after MIT and Stanford, according to the 2014 U.S. News & World Report rankings. It houses one of the most highly regarded and prestigious engineering programs in the world. The college was established in 1931 from a merger of the Colleges of Mechanics and the College of Civil Engineering. The College of Mining was integrated into the college in 1942. The college is currently situated in 11 buildings on the northeast side of the central campus, and also operates at the 150 acre (61 ha) Richmond Field Station. There are over 57,000 living graduates of the College of Engineering, living in all 50 states and nearly 100 countries, with the majority living in California.

==Departments==

The College of Letters and Science also offers a Bachelor of Arts in computer science, which requires many of the same courses as the College of Engineering's Bachelor of Science in EECS, but has different admissions and graduation criteria. Berkeley's chemical engineering department is under the College of Chemistry.

==Students==

There are approximately 3,200 undergraduates in the College of Engineering, representing all departments. Undergraduate admissions to the College of Engineering is more competitive than the University as a whole. For the 2011-12 application cycle, over 12,000 students applied and 13.2% were accepted.[tpl]cite web|url=http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/faq/prospective-freshman-faq.html|title=Prospective Freshmen FAQ|last=UC Berkeley College of Engineering|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=26 December 2013[/tpl] The campus as a whole had a 21% acceptance rate that year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2012/04/17/campus-releases-2012-13-freshman-admission-data/|title= Campus releases 2012-13 freshman admission data|last=Gilmore|first=Janet|date=17 April 2012|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=26 December 2013[/tpl] Applicants apply directly to one of the departments and enter as declared majors within their department. It is also possible to apply as Engineering Undeclared and enter the college; major declaration is required at the end of freshman year. Once within the college, it is possible to change majors with the approval of Engineering Student Services. It is extremely difficult for undergraduates in other colleges at UC Berkeley to change college into Engineering, as they can only be admitted if a current engineering undergraduate drops.[tpl]cite web|url=http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/change-of-college|title=Change of College (into COE)|last=UC Berkeley College of Engineering|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=26 December 2013[/tpl] The College of Engineering accepts junior transfer applications for those who have completed at least 60 semester units at another college or university. Preference is given to students at California Community Colleges. 254 transfers (14.4%) were admitted for the 2012-13 academic year.[tpl]cite web|url=http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/prospective-students/faq/transfer-faq.html|title=Prospective Transfer FAQ|last=UC Berkeley College of Engineering|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=26 December 2013[/tpl] Dean Shankar Sastry has stated that the disparity between the college's and the university's acceptance rates is due to the university's failure to respond to the rise in demand for engineering degrees.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.kqed.org/newsfix/2013/07/18/university-of-california-not-producing-enough-engineers-dean-charges/|title=University of California Not Producing Enough Engineers, Cal Dean Charges|last=Shahani|first=Aarti|date=19 July 2013|publisher=KQED|accessdate=26 December 2013[/tpl]
85% of undergraduates admitted to the college graduate from the college, and 91% graduate from some college at UC Berkeley. The college has a 4-year graduation policy, with extra semesters approved only in certain cases. Engineering Student Services provides academic advising, peer tutoring, and career services to engineering students. Various student organizations are run in conjunction with the college, including Pioneers in Engineering, Hackers @ Berkeley, Berkeley Engineers and Mentors, and the Open Computing Facility. Many students belong to the student chapters of their corresponding professional organizations (e.g. the American Nuclear Society, American Society of Civil Engineers, or Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers).[tpl]cite web|url=http://coe.berkeley.edu/students/current-undergraduates/student-involvement/engineering-student-societies.html|title=Engineering Student Organizations & Competition Teams|last=UC Berkeley College of Engineering|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=26 December 2013[/tpl]
Graduate admissions in the College of Engineering is administered by department. In fall 2013, there were 379 master's and 1,425 doctorate students in the college.[tpl]cite web|url=http://grad.berkeley.edu/news/berkeley_graduate_profile.shtml|title=Berkeley Graduate Profile|last=UC Berkeley Graduate Division|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=26 December 2013[/tpl]
The college's enrollment is approximately 22% women. The proportion of women has increased over time, however, issues of gender disparity in the college remain. According to a 2011 survey, female engineers reported a high number of instances of passive harassment, discrimination, and judgment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2012/11/13/female-students-still-struggling-to-find-foothold-in-computer-science/|title=Female students still struggle to find foothold in engineering, computer science|last=Afzal|first=Afsana|date=13 November 2012|publisher=The Daily Californian|accessdate=26 December 2013[/tpl] The college's administration has taken steps to prevent this sexism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2011/11/06/campus-works-to-improve-atmosphere-for-women-in-college-of-engineering/|title=Campus works to improve atmosphere for women in College of Engineering|last=Vincent|first=Betsy|date=7 November 2011|publisher=The Daily Californian|accessdate=26 December 2013[/tpl] The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) is one of the student groups representing women in the college.
