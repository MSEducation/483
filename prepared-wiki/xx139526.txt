[[Omega Drivers]]

CATEGORIES: Device drivers

Omega Drivers are unofficial, third-party device drivers for ATI and Nvidia graphics cards, created by Angel Trinidad. They differ from the official drivers in that they offer more customization and extra features. They are compatible with some ATI graphics cards and some Nvidia cards that use Detonator drivers.
The drivers are tweaked versions of those officially released by ATI and Nvidia, mainly using registry tweaks and offering an alternative installer. They are not custom drivers compiled from source code.

==ATI driver features==

The Omega ATI driver is based on ATI's Catalyst drivers. The driver is particularly notable for resolving 3D compatibility problems affecting past versions of the ATI drivers (versions 7.8-7.12) and some AGP cards.
The driver includes various third party utilities including 'MultiRes' (from EnTech Taiwan) and ATI Tray Tools tweaking utility.

==Reception==

The drivers are recognized by ATI as the best alternative drivers on the Internet according to Terry Makedon:
Nvidia has previously attempted legal action against some versions of Omega Drivers; the company has since allowed Omega Drivers for Nvidia cards to be made.[tpl]cite web|title=The case of omega vs. Nvidia|url=http://www.wcm.at/story.php?id=5316 | language = German | date = 2003-07-24 | publisher = WCM | location = Austria[/tpl]
