==History of Bangladesh Armed Forces==

===Bangladesh War of Independence===

The modern history of the Bangladesh military began its inception on the night of 25 March 1971 when the Pakistan military launched a brutal attack named Operation Searchlight. On 26 March[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com.bd/books?id=DedtAAAAMAAJ&q=independence |title=HISTORY OF FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN BANGLADESH, 1943-1973: SOME INVOLVEMENT |author= JYOTI SEN GUPTA, NAYA PROKASH, 206, BIDHAN SARANI, CALCUTTA-6, FIRST EDITION, 1974, CHAPTER-15, PAGE-325 and 326[/tpl] 1971 evening Major Ziaur Rahman organised a revolt and countered the Pakistan army units in Chittagong and during the early morning hours of March the 26th he broadcast the official declaration of Independence of Bangladesh. On the 27th March a second broadcast was also declared on behalf of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from the captured Kalurghat[tpl]cite web|author=Posted by Admin. |url=http://newsbd71.blogspot.com/2011/03/flames-of-freedom-beginning-of.html |title=Major Ziaur Rahman's revolt with 8 East Bengal Regiment at Chittagong |publisher=Newsbd71.blogspot.com |date=2011-03-20 |accessdate=2013-02-18[/tpl] radio station in Chittagong. Hence the Independence day of Bangladesh is 26 March. On 4 April 1971 under the command and leadership of the C-in-C Colonel M.A.G. Osmani (retd), it began organization and creation with the title of Bangladesh Forces. During the first Bangladesh Sector Commanders ConferenceList of Sectors in Bangladesh Liberation War (held during 11–17 July 1971) Bangladesh Forces were organized and formed for the ongoing Bangladesh War of Independence from Pakistan. It was significant in the sense that during this historic conference the Bangladesh Forces field command structure, sector reorganization, reinforcement, appointment of field commanders and tactics of warfare were decided upon and carried out. This conference was presided over jointly by the then Prime Minister of Bangladesh Mr. Tajuddin Ahmed and Banga Bir Colonel M.A.G. Osmani Commander in Chief of all Bangladesh Forces. During this conference Muhammad Ataul Gani Osmani was reinstated from retirement to active duty into the Armed Forces of Bangladesh as its senior most official, with the rank of Colonel reactivated. Principal participants of this conference were Principal Military Representative of Bangladesh Government-in-Exile at Chakulia Guerilla Training Camp (Bihar) Squadron Leader M. Hamidullah Khan, BDF Commander Sector 1 Major Ziaur Rahman, BDF Commander Sector 2 Major Khaled Mosharraf, BDF Commander Sector 3 Major K M Shafiullah, BDF Commander Sector 4 Major C R Datta, Major M. A. Jalil, Captain Rafiqul Islam, Lt. Col. Abdur Rab, Wing Commander Khademul Bashar, Major Najmul Haque, Major Mir Shawkat Ali. Lt. Col. Abdur Rab was appointed as Chief of Staff, Bangladesh Army. However, throughout the entire duration of the war Lt. Col. Rab remained in Tripura. During early August at the behest of the Indian authorities Colonel Osmani unwillingly appointed Group Captain A. K. Khandker as Deputy Chief of Staff (Liaison) in place of Group Captain Muhammad Ghulam Tawab, whom Osmani wanted to appoint as his Deputy Commander-in-Chief. Bangladesh was divided into Eleven Sectors under Sector Commanders. For better management of military operations each sector was divided into a combination of sub-sectors, commanded by a Sub-Sector Commander. The 10th Sector was kept under the direct command of the Commander in Chief and included the Naval Commandos as C-in-C’s special operations force. These commandos were later absorbed into the Bangladesh Navy.
The Bangladesh Forces received tightly measured assistance from the meager resources of the Indian authorities soon after hostilities broke out. The Soviet Union and the U.S. were also keen to play Cold War politics in the region. The U.S. policy guided by then U.S. National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger was courting Pakistan to open ties with China, hence could not support the Bangladesh struggle for independence. However, Nixon's policy did supply emergency relief assistance to India and huge amount of military and financial aid to Pakistan. The USSR decided to assist India to thwart US influence, eventually supported and immensely strengthened Indian efforts against Pakistan [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]. Bangladesh's independence struggle gained from this assistance after India initially decided to support the official Bangladesh government and BD Forces, but also tacitly trained and supplied pro-Indian militia's Mujib Bahini, Hemayet Bahini and Kaderia Bahini with planning, training and arms towards achieving other targeted goals of loot and sabotage and clandestine operations under the direction and guidance of RAW chief R. N. Kao and SFF Inspector General Major General Sujat Singh Uban. The support to BD Forces culminated under the security umbrella provided by the Indo-Soviet Friendship Treaty of August 1971.
On 21 November 1971, when the natural climate was dry and more adaptable and by which time the Bangladesh Forces had severely weakened the strength of the West Pakistani Forces through its guerilla operations, under a complicated politico-military scenario, a demand of the Indian government was conceded to by the Bangladesh Government-in-exile in Calcutta, which was handing over the full command and authority of its operations to the Indian armed forces. The Pakistani force had already suffered massive casualty from constant attacks by the BD Forces and was on the verge of collapse[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl], they readily agreed to a cease fire without resistance in about one and a half weeks, on 16 December 1971. However, the cease fire was switched into a surrender document. The Bangladesh Forces C-in-C Colonel M.A.G. Osmani and almost every member of the Bangladesh Forces, Sector Commanders who organised and led the war including Brigade K, and Z Force Commanders were barred from attending[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]. Freelance journalists, ambassadors, or other diplomats, the press, civilian representatives were barred from attending. Group Captain A. K. Khandker, the lone BD Forces non combatant staff member, managed to tag along with the Indian entourage and witnessed the show and returned to Kalyani, Calcutta, back on the same day with them. K M Shafiullah, S Force commander, and a handful of others were also among the hundreds of local masses who surrounded the event from a distance. "No protocol was set on what they were supposed to do". A fact Shafiullah admitted himself. "We rushed to the Race Course from the airport. I was quite near the signing table. But we were not sure what we were supposed to do. That's why I do not appear in any of the photographs. There was rejoicing all around by many Bangladesh citizens. Niazi was put on a jeep and sent away. Aurora and J.F.R. Jacob left the premise and immediately flew back after the signing. That night I did not come across anyone." -Major General Shafiullah spoke to Kaushik Sankar Das.[tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl]
Victory was declared by the Indian authorities. All 93,000 prisoners of war and massive amount of captured war materials were taken to India. Colonel Osmani and a few sector commanders arrived in Dhaka a day later, and set up the former Pakistan Army 14 Div HQ's, w.e.f 17 December 1971, as BD Forces Command Headquarters, at Dhaka Cantonment which remained operational until 14 February 1972. All closures and accounts were conducted from Osmani's C-in-C HQ at Dhaka Cantonment. Group Captain Muhammad Ghulam Tawab was appointed Osmani's first Deputy Commander in Chief after being able to return from Bangkok, Thailand on 17 December 1971. General Osmani and his deputy Group Captain Muhammad Ghulam Tawab remanied in command of BD Forces until 7 April 1972. However, due to internal politics conspired and spearheaded by Group Captain A.K. Khandker and members of the Awami League who resurfaced from Calcutta, India, almost more than a month after the war ended, managed to remove Tawab entirely from service in Bangladesh government. Bangladesh Forces were ordered on 29 January 1972 for demobilization of all sectors by end of March under the direction of the newly Indian army installed Mujib government. General M.A.G Osmani held the final Sector Commanders Conference at the old Police HQ bldg. at 27 Mintu Road, Dhaka. The famous Bangladesh Forces Command Group photograph was taken on that day. All sectors were abruptly shut down. No official accounts of war wounded, gallantry investigations, or weapons collection were done. Independent Bangladesh remained under Indian army occupation and total control for another three months after the war, with an ICS and an Indian army official in every official entity of the Bangladesh government. U.S. President Nixon made clear to the Indians that they must leave Bangladesh soil before any international recognition or assistance[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]. Quickly realising this as a critical situation, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman made a unilateral public demand to Indira Gandhi regarding the absolute, unconditional, and unequivocal withdrawal of all Indian officials and forces from Bangladesh[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]. India withdrew its personnel within 2 days 17 to 19 March 1972.
The Bangladesh Forces was organized for War of Independence in 1971 under 11(eleven) sectors and subsequently into three brigade size commands with ultimately only one being fully operational and organised, Z Force.

==Role of the Military==

The Bangladeshi Forces fully structured by September 1971, organised itself officially as the Bangladesh Armed Forces comprising Bangladesh Army, Bangladesh Navy and Bangladesh Air Force. The current strength of Bangladesh Army is estimated to be more than 152000 personnel, while Bangladesh Air Force consists of more than 14,000 personnel and Bangladesh Navy with 18,000 personnel http://www.bdmilitary.com/main/military/militaryforces.htm. The forces perform traditional military missions. The Bangladesh Coast Guard under the Home Ministry, plays a stronger role in the area of anti-smuggling, anti-piracy, and protection of offshore resources. Recognition of economic and fiscal constraints has led to the establishment of several paramilitary and auxiliary forces, including the 35,000 member Border Guard Bangladesh and the 4,000 member Ansars and Village Defence Parties Organization. The Border Guards Bangladesh, under the Home Ministry, are commanded by army officers who are seconded to the organization.
In addition to traditional defence roles, the military has been called on to provide support to civil authorities for disaster relief and internal security. The military of Bangladesh fought tribal insurgents in Chittagong Hill Tracts since mid-1970s. In November 2008, Bangladesh Navy effectively staved off economic aggression by Myanmar in the seas of Bangladesh. Occasionally the military forces have been called to participate in social activities like rehabilitation of people following a flood or cyclone. Since late 1980s, it has earned international reputation by working as part of United Nations peacekeeping Missions in different countries of the world. The Bangladesh military is recognized as a disciplined and well-trained national institution that can tackle critical national phases. A 2,300-member Bangladesh Army contingent served with coalition forces during the 1991 Gulf war. Bangladesh is currently the second highest contributor (with 7941 troops, as of October 2013) to United Nations peacekeeping operations, with an infantry battalion in UNIKOM (Kuwait), an engineer battalion in UNTAET, (East Timor) and another infantry battalion service in Sierra Leone in May 2000.

For advance training during their career, officers are sent to Bangladesh Defence Services Command and Staff College at Mirpur, while senior officers attend the National Defence University and Armed Forces War Course. Many attend the MIST while serving. Officers of the Army Medical Corps are recruited after graduation from civil medical colleges. They undergo basic military training at Military Academy followed by professional training in medical corps centre and Armed forces medical institute. Recently cadets of Armed Forces Medical College also started joining the services directly.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bangladesharmy.org/newahq/index5.php?category=49 |title=Bangladesharmy.org |publisher=Bangladesharmy.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-21[/tpl]
