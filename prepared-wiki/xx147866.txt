The Yamaha SR500  is a single-cylinder motorcycle manufactured in Japan by Yamaha Motor Company and marketed from 1978-1999 in North America, Asia and Oceania — as a street version of the Yamaha XT500 with a standard riding posture and styling resembling the Universal Japanese Motorcycle (UJM) of the 1960s and 1970s. 
Prior to formal marketing, Yamaha presented a  pre-production prototype to US dealers in the autumn of 1975.[tpl]cite news|last=Seigal|first=Margie|title=The Yamaha TT500|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/classic-japanese-motorcycles/yamaha-tt500.aspx|accessdate=18 July 2013|newspaper=Motorcycle Classics|date=November–December 2008|quote=The SR500 quickly became a cult item, with Japanese and American aftermarket manufacturers producing go-faster parts and cosmetic disguises intended to turn the Yamaha into a Velocette or BSA Gold Star clone.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Youngblood|first=Ed|title=The Elegant ESO|url=http://www.motohistory.net/news2004/news_dec04.html|work=Ed Youngblood's Motohistory|publisher=MotoHistory.net|accessdate=21 July 2013|date=2 December 2004|quote=The Iron Curtain answer to the big singles of the West was the Czech-built ESO.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=ESO 500cc Moto-Cross – 1959|url=http://www.earlyyearsofmx.com/ESO500.html|publisher=The Early Years of Motocross Museum|accessdate=21 July 2013|quote=The engine, the masterpiece of the ESO, was well ahead of its time in terms of engineering.[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Classic Motocross Iron: 1959 ESO 500 Scrambler|url=http://motocrossactionmag.com/Main/News/CLASSIC-MOTOCROSS-IRON-1959-ESO-500-SCRAMBLER--5852.aspx|accessdate=21 July 2013|newspaper=Motocross Action Magazine|quote=Though the engine was originally designed by Simandl for speedway (and was an exact copy of a British JAP), Simandl designed the S45 motocross engine (named for its actual horsepower output) on the then-new unit construction concept in 1957.[/tpl]
Regarding the bike's styling, designer Atsushi Ishiyama said: "Our choice was to design the new SR 500 with a strong family image and a strong link to our first four stroke, the XS 650 twin, which was also inspired by British design."[tpl]cite web|title=They did it their way: When the big thumper returned|url=http://www.yamaha-motor.eu/designcafe/en/archive/archived-articles/index.aspx?view=article&id=441198|work=Yamaha Design Cafe English|publisher=Yamaha Motor Europe|accessdate=18 July 2013|date=1 March 2003|quote=The times in the sixties where big singles touched the heart of enthusiasts were not forgotten![/tpl]

==SR400==

Yamaha has marketed a variant of the SR500 with a smaller engine, the SR400, in Japan — with a hiatus from 2008 to 2010. Yamaha subsequently reintroduced the SR400 with fuel injection. The SR400 is essentially the same bike[tpl]cn|date=September 2013[/tpl] as the SR500, but with a shorter stroke and heavier muffler to pass tighter emission restrictions.[tpl]cite web|title=Another Japanese Gem - The Yamaha SR400 (SR500)|url=http://www.returnofthecaferacers.com/2007/09/another-japanese-jem-yamaha-sr400-sr500.html|publisher=Return of the Cafe Racers|accessdate=17 July 2013|date=September 2007|quote=Aesthetically the bike hasn't changed much since its conception and as such oozes retro classic appeal in todays market.[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Siegal|first=Margie|title=1980 Yamaha SR500|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/2006-03-01/split-personality.aspx|accessdate=18 July 2013|newspaper=Motorcycle Classics|date=March–April 2006|quote=Durable and easy to maintain, the Yamaha SR500 became a cult favorite among classic motorcycle fans.[/tpl]
