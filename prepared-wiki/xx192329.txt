The American Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists (AAPB) was an American national professional association established in 1901, devoted to the medical sciences as distinct from clinical medicine. In 1976, they joined with the American Society for Experimental Pathology to form the American Society for Investigative Pathology.http://www.asip.org/gov/pastoff.htm
The AAPB took over the Journal of the Boston Society of Medical Sciences, and renamed it the Journal of Medical Research. The first issue was published in July 1901.
In 1924 the Council voted to end the Journal of Medical Research and with a grant from the General Education Board of the Rockefeller Foundation, the AAPB started the American Journal of Pathology on January 1, 1925, noting on the cover that it was a continuation of the Journal of Medical Research.http://www.worldcat.org/title/american-journal-of-pathology/oclc/1479398
