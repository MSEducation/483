The concept appears in numerous fields and is encountered in works of Carl Jung, Gilbert Simondon, Bernard Stiegler, Friedrich Nietzsche, Arthur Schopenhauer, David Bohm, Henri Bergson, Gilles Deleuze, and Manuel De Landa.

==Usage==

The word individuation is used differently in philosophy than in Jungian psychology.

===In philosophy===

It expresses the general idea of how a thing is identified as an individual thing that "is not something else." This includes how an individual person is held to be distinct from other elements in the world and how a person is distinct from other persons.

===In Jungian psychology===

In Jungian psychology, also called  analytical psychology, it expresses the process in which the individual self develops out of an undifferentiated unconscious. It is a developmental psychic process during which innate elements of personality, the components of the immature psyche, and the experiences of the person's life become integrated over time into a well-functioning whole.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2012[/tpl]

===In the media industry===

The term "individuation" has begun to be used within the media industry to denote new printing and online technologies that permit mass customization of the contents of a newspaper, a magazine, a broadcast program, or a website so that its contents match each individual user's unique interests. This differs from the mass media practice of producing the same contents for all readers, viewers, listeners, or online users.
Marshall McLuhan, the communications theorist, alluded to this trend when discussing the future of printed books in an electronically interconnected world.

==Carl Jung==

According to Jungian psychology, individuation is a process of psychological integration. "In general, it is the process by which individual beings are formed and differentiated other human beings; in particular, it is the development of the psychological individual as a being distinct from the general, collective psychology." Jung, C.G.  Psychological Types.  Collected Works, vol. 6, par. 757.
Individuation is a process of transformation whereby the personal and collective unconscious are brought into consciousness (e.g., by means of dreams, active imagination, or free association) to be assimilated into the whole personality. It is a completely natural process necessary for the integration of the psyche.Jung, C.G. (1962). Symbols of Transformation: An Analysis of the Prelude to a Case of Schizophrenia (vol. 2). New York: Harper & Brothers. Individuation has a holistic healing effect on the person, both mentally and physically.
In addition to Jung's theory of complexes, his theory of the individuation process forms conceptions of a phylogenetically acquired unconscious filled with mythic images, a non-sexual libido, the general types of extraversion and introversion, the compensatory and prospective functions of dreams, and the synthetic and constructive approaches to fantasy formation and utilization.Jung, C.G. (Shamdasani, S). (2009). The Red Book, p. 208, par. 3. Verona, Italy: Mondadori Printing.
"The symbols of the individuation process . . . mark its stages like milestones, prominent among them for Jungians being the shadow, the wise old man . . . and lastly the anima in man and the animus in woman." Jung quoted in J. Jacobi, Complex, Archetype, Symbol (London 1959) p. 113-114. Thus, "There is often a movement from dealing with the persona at the start . . . to the ego at the second stage, to the shadow as the third stage, to the anima or animus, to the Self as the final stage. Some would interpose the Wise Old Man and the Wise Old Woman as spiritual archetypes coming before the final step of the Self." Rowan, John, Subpersonalities (London 1990) p. 144.

==Gilbert Simondon==

In L'individuation psychique et collective, Gilbert Simondon developed a theory of individual and collective individuation in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation rather than a cause. Thus, the individual atom is replaced by a never-ending ontological process of individuation.
Simondon also conceived of "pre-individual fields" which make individuation possible. Individuation is an ever-incomplete process, always leaving a "pre-individual" left over, which makes possible future individuations. Furthermore, individuation always creates both an individual subject and a collective subject, which individuate themselves concurrently.

==Bernard Stiegler==

The philosophy of Bernard Stiegler draws upon and modifies the work of Gilbert Simondon on individuation and also upon similar ideas in Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. During a talk given at the Tate Modern art gallery in 2004,Bernard Stiegler: Culture and Technology, tate.org.uk, 13 May 2004 Stiegler summarized his understanding of individuation. The essential points are the following:
