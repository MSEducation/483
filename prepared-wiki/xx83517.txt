A forb (sometimes spelled phorb) is a herbaceous flowering plant that is not a graminoid (grasses, sedges and rushes). The term is used in biology and in vegetation ecology, especially in relation to grasslands[tpl]cite book |author=Schröder, Hans |title=Grasslands: Ecology, Management and Restoration |publisher=Nova Science Publishers |location=Commack, N.Y |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=1-60692-024-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl] and understory.

==Etymology==

"Forb" is derived from the Greek φορβή (phorbḗ), "pasture" or "fodder".[tpl]cite book |author=Jaeger, Edmund C. |authorlink=Edmund Jaeger |title=A source-book of biological names and terms |publisher=Thomas |location=Springfield, Ill |year=1959 |pages= |isbn=0-398-06179-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Scott, Robert Pickett; Henry, George |title=Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon, Abridged: Original Edition, republished in larger and clearer typeface |publisher=Simon Wallenburg Press |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-84356-026-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl]  The spelling "phorb" is sometimes used, and in older usage this sometimes includes graminids and other plants currently not regarded as forbs.

==Forbs and guilds==

Forbs are members of guilds of plant species with broadly similar growth form. In certain contexts in ecology, guild membership may often be more important than the taxonomic relationships between organisms.

==Forbs in informal classification==

In addition to its use in ecology, the term "forb" may be used for subdividing popular guides to wildflowers, distinguishing them from other categories such as grasses, sedges, shrubs, and trees.
Some examples of forbs are clover, sunflower, cannabis and milkweed.
