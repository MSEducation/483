The Gay & Lesbian Fund for Colorado, a program of the Gill Foundation, provides financial support to nonprofit organizations in Colorado. Current grant making through the Gay & Lesbian Fund includes STEM education, safe and inclusive schools and programs (like this grant to the Colorado High School Activities Association and the You Can Play Project), support for Colorado public broadcasting outlets, local civic engagement nonprofit organizations, and statewide LGBT service and advocacy organizations. Based in Denver with the Gill Foundation, the Gay & Lesbian Fund for Colorado has awarded more than $30 million in grants since its inception. 
The fund provides support for organizations in Colorado to demonstrate that LGBT people share the same values and are committed to working together with all Coloradans to build a better Colorado.
