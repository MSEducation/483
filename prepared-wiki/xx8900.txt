[[Nanometre]]

CATEGORIES: Units of length

The nanometre (International spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures; SI symbol: nm) or nanometer (American spelling) is a unit of length in the metric system, equal to one billionth of a metre. The name combines the SI prefix nano- (from the Ancient Greek [tpl]lang|grc|νάνος[/tpl], [tpl]lang|grc-Latn|nanos[/tpl], "dwarf") with the parent unit name metre (from Greek [tpl]lang|grc|μέτρον[/tpl], [tpl]lang|grc-Latn|metrοn[/tpl], "unit of measurement").  It can be written in scientific notation as 1×10−9 m, in engineering notation as [tpl]nowrap|1 E−9 m[/tpl], and is simply [tpl]nowrap|1 / 1,000,000,000 m[/tpl]. One nanometre equals ten angstroms.

==Use==

The nanometre is often used to express dimensions on an atomic scale: the diameter of a helium atom, for example, is about 0.1 nm, and that of a ribosome is about 20 nm. The nanometre is also commonly used to specify the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation near the visible part of the spectrum: visible light ranges from around 400 to 800 nm.Hewakuruppu, Y., et al., Plasmonic “ pump – probe ” method to study semi-transparent nanofluids, Applied Optics, 52(24):6041-6050 The angstrom, which is equal to 0.1 nanometre, was formerly used for these purposes.

==History==

The nanometre was formerly known as the millimicrometre – or, more commonly, the millimicron for short –  since it is 1/1000 of a micron (micrometre), and was often denoted by the symbol mµ or (more rarely) µµ.[tpl]Cite journal |first=The |last=Svedberg |first2=J.

The nanometre is often associated with the field of nanotechnology. Since the late 1980s, it has also been used to describe generations of the manufacturing technology in the semiconductor industry.
