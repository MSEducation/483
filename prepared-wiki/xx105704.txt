Bryan Cave expanded further in 2007 when it opened an office in Hamburg[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bryancave.com/offices/hamburg/ |title=Our Offices | Offices | Hamburg |publisher=Bryan Cave |date= |accessdate=2014-03-04[/tpl] and Milan.

At the beginning of 2012, Bryan Cave merged with Holme Roberts & Owen (HRO), a law firm based in Denver, Colorado with over 210 attorneys. The only international law firm based in Denver, it had several other offices in the United States and worldwide. HRO had been named the best corporate/M&A and environmental law firm in Denver by Corporate Board Member magazine for three years, and Chambers USA also named HRO a “Band 1” leading law firm for seven consecutive years. However, they had experienced significant staff losses and departures in 2011, making the acquisition a desirable option.[tpl]cite web|author=9:39 amDec 6, 2011 |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2011/12/06/merger-madness-bryan-cave-joins-with-holme-roberts/ |title=Bryan Cave Merges with Colo-based Holme Roberts & Owen - Law Blog - WSJ |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=2011-12-06 |accessdate=2014-03-04[/tpl] Together, the two firms comprise one of the 25 largest law firms in the world.
Bryan Cave also established an office in Frankfurt, Germany in 2012, to be integrated with the firm’s already established Hamburg office.
