Børge Rosenbaum ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔr|ɡ|ə[/tpl] [tpl]respell|BOR|gə[/tpl]; 3 January 1909 – 23 December 2000) — stage name Victor Borge — was a successful Danish comedian, conductor and pianist who achieved great popularity in radio and television in the United States and Europe. His unique and appealing blend of music and comedy earned him such affectionate sobriquets as "The Clown Prince of Denmark", "The Unmelancholy Dane",
and "The Great Dane".

==Biography==

===Early life and career===

Rosenbaum was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, into a Jewish family. His parents, Bernhard and Frederikke (Lichtinger) Rosenbaum, were both musicians—his father a violist in the Royal Danish Orchestra[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.kglteater.dk/site/OmKunstarterne/Ensembler/Det_Kongelige_Kapel/Tidslinjen.aspx | title = Det Kongelige Teater – Kort fortalt | accessdate =3 October 2010 | language = Danish | quote = My father played in the orchestra for more than 30 years – we couldn't recognise him, when he came home. (Om Bernhard Rosenbaum, som var bratschist i Kapellet fra 1888–1919 sagde Victor Borge: "Min far spillede i Kapellet i over 30 år – vi kunne heller ikke kende ham, da han kom hjem".)[/tpl]http://books.google.ca/books?id=58BkAAAAMAAJ&q=Bernhard+and+Fredenkke+(Uchtinger)+%D0%92.&dq=Bernhard+and+Fredenkke+(Uchtinger)+%D0%92.&hl=en and his mother a pianist. Like his mother, Borge began piano lessons at the age of two, and it was soon apparent that he was a prodigy. He gave his first piano recital when he was eight years old, and in 1918 was awarded a full scholarship at the Royal Danish Academy of Music, studying under Olivo Krause. Later on, he was taught by Victor Schiøler, Liszt's student Frederic Lamond, and Busoni's pupil Egon Petri.
Borge played his first major concert in 1926 at the Danish concert-hall Odd Fellow Palæet (The Odd Fellow's Lodge building). After a few years as a classical concert pianist, he started his now famous "stand up" act, with the signature blend of piano music and jokes. He married American Elsie Chilton in 1933, the same year he debuted with his revue acts. Borge started touring extensively in Europe, where he began telling anti-Nazi jokes.
When the Nazis occupied Denmark during World War II, Borge was playing a concert in Sweden, and managed to escape to Finland. He traveled to America on the USS American Legion, the last neutral ship to make it out of Petsamo, Finland, and arrived 28 August 1940, with only $20 (about $[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|20|1940[/tpl][/tpl] today), with $3 (about $[tpl]formatnum:[tpl]Inflation|US|3|1940|r=2[/tpl][/tpl] today) going to the customs fee. Disguised as a sailor, Borge returned to Denmark once during the occupation to visit his dying mother.

===Move to America===

Even though Borge did not speak a word of English upon arrival, he quickly managed to adapt his jokes to the American audience, learning English by watching movies. He took the name of Victor Borge, and, in 1941, he started on Rudy Vallee's radio show, but was hired soon after by Bing Crosby for his Kraft Music Hall program.
From then on, fame rose quickly for Borge, who won Best New Radio Performer of the Year in 1942. Soon after the award, he was offered film roles with stars such as Frank Sinatra (in Higher and Higher). While hosting The Victor Borge Show on NBC beginning in 1946, he developed many of his trademarks, including repeatedly announcing his intent to play a piece but getting "distracted" by something or other, making comments about the audience, or discussing the usefulness of Chopin's "Minute Waltz" as an egg timer. He would also start out with some well-known classical piece like Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" and suddenly move into a harmonically suitable pop or jazz tune like Cole Porter's "Night and Day" or "Happy Birthday to You".

===Borge's style===

Among Borge's other famous routines is the "Phonetic Punctuation" routine, in which he recites a story, with full punctuation (comma, period, exclamation mark, etc.) as exaggerated onomatopoeic sounds. Another is his "Inflationary Language", where he incremented numbers embedded in words, whether they are visible or not ("once upon a time" becomes "twice upon a time", "wonderful" becomes "twoderful", "forehead" becomes "fivehead", "tennis" becomes "elevennis", "I ate a tenderloin with my fork and so on and so forth" becomes "'I nine an elevenderloin with my five'k' and so on and so fifth").
Borge used physical and visual elements in his live and televised performances. He would play a strange-sounding piano tune from sheet music, looking increasingly confused; turning the sheet upside down, he would then play the actual tune, flashing a joyful smile of accomplishment to the audience (he had, at first, been literally playing the actual tune upside down). When his energetic playing of another song would cause him to fall off the piano bench, he would open the seat lid, take out the two ends of an automotive seat belt, and buckle himself onto the bench, "for safety." Conducting an orchestra, he might stop and order a violinist who had played a sour note to get off the stage, then resume the performance and have the other members of the section move up to fill the empty seat while they were still playing. From off stage would come the sound of a gunshot. His musical sidekick in the 1950s, Leonid Hambro, was a well-known concert pianist. In 1968, classical pianist Şahan Arzruni joined him as his straight man, performing together on one piano a version of Liszt's Second Hungarian Rhapsody, considered a musical-comedic classic.YouTube – Victor Borge – Hungarian Rhapsody #2 
He also enjoyed interacting with the audience. Seeing an interested person in the front row, he would ask them, "Do you like good music?" or "Do you care for piano music?" After an affirmative answer, Borge would take a piece of sheet music from his piano and say, "Here is some", and hand it over. After the audience's laughter died down, he would say, "That'll be $1.95" (or whatever the current price might be). He would then ask whether the audience member could read music; if the member said yes, he would ask a higher price. If he got no response from the audience after a joke, he would often add "...when this ovation has died down, of course". The delayed punch line to handing the person the sheet music would come when he would reach the end of a number and begin playing the penultimate notes over and over, with a puzzled look. He would then go back to the person in the audience, retrieve the sheet music, tear off a piece of it, stick it on the piano, and play the last couple of notes from it.
Making fun of modern theater, he would sometimes begin a performance by asking if there were any children in the audience. There always were, of course. He would sternly order them out, then say, "We do have some children in here; that means I can't do the second half in the nude. I'll wear the tie. (pause) The long one. (pause) The very long one, yes."YouTube – Victor Borge – Funny Jokes -Part 1
In his stage shows in later years, he would include a segment with opera singer Marilyn Mulvey. She would try to sing an aria, and he would react and interrupt, with such antics as falling off the bench in "surprise" when she hit a high note. He would also remind her repeatedly not to rest her hand on the piano. After the routine, the spotlight would fall upon Mulvey and she would sing a serious number with Borge accompanying in the background.

===Later career===

Borge appeared on Toast of the Town hosted by Ed Sullivan several times during 1948. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States the same year. He started the Comedy in Music  show at John Golden Theatre in New York City on 2 October 1953. Comedy in Music became the longest running one-man show in the history of theater with 849 performances when it closed on 21 January 1956, a feat which placed it in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Continuing his success with tours and shows, Borge played with and conducted orchestras including the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and London Philharmonic. Always modest, he felt honored when he was invited to conduct the Royal Danish Orchestra at the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1992.
His later television appearances included his "Phonetic Punctuation" routine on The Electric Company in a filmed sketch; he would also use it on the record to follow during the "Punctuation" song. He appeared several times on Sesame Street[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkE38Y7m1tM | title = YouTube – Victor Borge on Sesame Street | accessdate =2 October 2010[/tpl] and was a guest star during the fourth season of The Muppet Show.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5iCVytIbmk | title = YouTube – Victor Borge on the Muppet show: | accessdate =2 October 2010 | date = 22 May 1979[/tpl]
Victor Borge continued to tour until his last days, performing up to 60 times per year when he was 90 years old.

===Other endeavors===

Borge made several appearances on the long-running TV show What's My Line?, both as a celebrity panelist, and as a contestant with the occupation "poultry farmer"; Starting in the 1950s, as a businessman, Borge raised and popularized Rock Cornish game hens.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-Ps0H6Fwro | title = YouTube – Victor Borge—What's My Line: | accessdate =2 October 2010 | date = 11 October 1959[/tpl]
Borge helped start several trust funds, including the Thanks to Scandinavia Fund,[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/26/classified/paid-notice-deaths-borge-victor.html?ref=victor_borge | title = Paid Notice – Deaths BORGE, VICTOR – Paid Death Notice – NYTimes.com: | accessdate =2 October 2010 | quote = Thanks To Scandinavia is profoundly saddened by the passing of its co-founder and National Chairman Victor Borge. Escaping from Denmark in 1940 to freedom in the US just ahead of the Nazi invasion, Mr. Borge continually showed vigorous appreciation for the opportunities provided by both his native country and his adopted land. Among those efforts -Thanks To Scandinavia, a scholarship fund created in 1963 for Scandinavian students and doctors which stands as a perpetual American thank you to Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden for the protection and rescue heroically offered Scandinavian Jews and others during World War II. This time Victor, this last time, we say thanks to you for your generosity of spirit, your friendship, your legendary humor, your sublime musicianship and your eloquent devotion to the wellbeing of your fellow man. | work=The New York Times | date=26 December 2000[/tpl] which was started in dedication to those who helped the Jews escape the German persecution during the war.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/27/classified/paid-notice-deaths-borge-victor.html?ref=victor_borge | title = Paid Notice – Deaths BORGE, VICTOR – Paid Death Notice – NYTimes.com: | accessdate =2 October 2010 | quote = The American Jewish Committee remembers with great affection and enduring admiration Victor Borge, a man who embodied the rare and wonderful qualities of genuine humor, deep compassion, and true humanity. We are especially grateful for Mr. Borge's gift of performance that enabled us to partake of his exceptional spirit and enriched our lives. AJC was deeply honored to recently become affiliated with Thanks To Scandinavia, the scholarship fund founded by Mr. Borge and New York attorney Richard Netter to thank Scandinavians for rescuing Jews during the Second World War. Through the foundation, we are committed to keeping Mr. Borge's memory-and his vision-vibrant for future generations. | work=The New York Times | date=27 December 2000[/tpl]
Aside from his musical work, Borge wrote three books, My Favorite Intermissions and My Favorite Comedies in Music (both with Robert Sherman), and the autobiography Smilet er den korteste afstand ("The Smile is the Shortest Distance") with Niels-Jørgen Kaiser.
In 1979, Borge founded the American Pianists Association (then called the Beethoven Foundation) with Julius Bloom and Anthony P. Habig. The American Pianists Association now produces two major piano competitions: the Classical Fellowship Awards and the Jazz Fellowship Awards.http://www.americanpianists.org/about/history

==Death==

Borge died in Greenwich, Connecticut, at the age of 91, after more than 75 years of entertaining. He died peacefully in his sleep a day after returning from a concert in Denmark.   "It was just his time to go", Frederikke Borge said. "He's been missing my mother terribly."[tpl]cite web | url = http://slick.org/deathwatch/mailarchive/msg00154.html | title = Celebrity Deathwatch: Victor Borge, Comic Pianist, 91 | accessdate =2 October 2010 | quote = Borge, who had not been ill, had been planning to tour Australia next week. "It was just his time to go," his daughter said. "He's been missing my mother terribly."[/tpl] According to his wish, to mark his connection to both the United States and Denmark, a part of Victor Borge's ashes is interred at Putnam Cemetery in Greenwich, with a replica of Danish icon The Little Mermaid sitting on a large rock at the gravesite, the other part in Western Jewish Cemetery (Mosaisk Vestre Begravelsesplads), Copenhagen, Denmark.[tpl]cite news | first = Bente | last = Clausen | title = Victor Borges aske deles | date = 9 May 2001 | url = http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/219265:Kirke---tro--Victor-Borges-aske-deles | work=Kristeligt Dagblad | accessdate =3 October 2010 | language = Danish[/tpl]

==Legacy==

Borge received an honorary degree from Trinity College, Hartford, in 1997.[tpl]cite news | title = Danish Rabbi Will Visit Area Temple | date = 15 September 1997 | url = http://articles.courant.com/1997-09-15/news/9709150421_1_victor-borge-sabbath-rabbi | work=Hartford Courant | accessdate =3 October 2010 | quote = Melchior will also speak at Trinity College and, along with Victor Borge, receive an honorary degree from the college.[/tpl]
When in 1998 the Royal Danish Orchestra celebrated its 550th anniversary, Borge was appointed an honorary member[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.aaretspressefoto.dk/index.php?aar=1998&vis=liste | title = Årets Pressefoto 1998 | accessdate =3 October 2010 | language = Danish[/tpl] – at that time one of only ten in the orchestra's history.The others wereEdwin Fischer, A.W. Nielsen, Svend Wilhelm Hansen, Igor Markevitch, Sergiu Celibidache, Hanne Wilhelm Hansen, Henning Rohde, Peter Augustinus and Danny Kaye.
Borge received Kennedy Center Honors in 1999.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.kennedy-center.org/explorer/artists/?entity_id=3700&source_type=A | title = Victor Borge / Explore the Arts – The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts: | accessdate =3 October 2010 | quote = He looks like a elder statesman and speaks with the charming accents of a middle European fairytale kingdom, but the whole world knows him as the Great Dane. Victor Borge's unique combination of concert pianist and sit-down comedian – an intoxicating mixture of melodies and mirth – has made him a living legend for most of the 20th century. His ability to puncture the pretensions of humanity in general, musicians in particular, whether he's lampooning stuffy conductors or grandiose concert pianists, remains undiminished, seventy years after his professional debut. As every good musician and comic knows, it's all in the timing and Borge is a master. He holds the Guinness Book of Records citation for longest-running one-man show in the history of the theater, with 849 performances on Broadway of his "Comedy in Music," which began in 1952.[/tpl]
