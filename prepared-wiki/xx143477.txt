Preus Museum, in Horten, is the national museum for photography in Norway. It was founded 1976 by Leif Preus and the Preus family as a private museum, but the collection was acquired by the Norwegian government in 1995.
In 2001, the museum moved to a former naval facility in Karljohansvern. The facilities have been adapted for museum use based on the work of architect Sverre Fehn.
