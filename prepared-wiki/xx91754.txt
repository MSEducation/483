Staatsoper Hannover is a German opera house and opera company in Hanover.  Its season runs from September to June.
The home base of Staatsoper Hannover is the Hanover Opera House, a theater built in classical style between 1845 and 1852 based on a plan drawn by Laves. The building was badly damaged in World War II and rebuilt in 1948. In 1985, the acoustics were improved, and between 1996 and 1998 the stage facilities were renovated.
The current Intendant of the company is Michael Klügl.  Since 2011, the American conductor Karen Kamensek is the Generalmusikdirektorin (General Music Director, GMD) of the company, the first American and the first woman to hold the post.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/karen-kamensek-dirigentin-eine-frauenquote-in-der-musik-unmoeglich-a-742728.html | title= Karen Kamensek, Dirigentin: "Eine Frauenquote in der Musik?
