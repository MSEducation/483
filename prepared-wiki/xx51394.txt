Live at the Greek: Excess All Areas is a double live album by Jimmy Page and The Black Crowes, released by musicmaker.com on 29 February 2000 and later by TVT Records on 4 July 2000. In October 1999, Page teamed up with The Black Crowes for a two-night performance of material from the Led Zeppelin catalogue and old blues and rock standards. Due to contractual problems with their record company, The Black Crowes were unable to release any of their own songs which were played at the Greek shows. These songs, on which Jimmy Page played with the Crowes, included: "Wiser Time", "No Speak No Slave", "Remedy", "Hard to Handle", and "She Talks to Angels". The double CD was released in stores by TVT Records on 4 July 2000, and featured a different track running order, an extra song, an enhanced QuickTime video and photographs taken during the concert. The Japanese version of the album also features "Misty Mountain Hop" and "In the Light", recorded in 2000.
