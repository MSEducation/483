Like the symbol the Naga or coiled serpent, people of this Nakshatra are people of confused emotions, no matter how close you are to them, due to their inherent insecurities they will attack you to savor themselves. On good side the natives have very good leadership skills and are apt at managing even a large army, very diplomatic and cordial by nature.
This a gand mool nakshtra and is considered one of the most inauspicious once to be born in as far as moon sign is concerned.
