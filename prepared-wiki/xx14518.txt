==Mixed pronunciation==

Among experts and the general public, there is some disagreement as to how specific years of the 21st century should be pronounced in English.[tpl]cite news |title=It's the end of the Noughties, we feel fine|date=26 October 2009|work=news.com.au|url=http://www.news.com.au/features/moment-of-the-decade/its-the-end-of-the-noughties-we-feel-fine/story-fn488f89-1225791181896 |first=David |last=Higgins| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101119195654/http://www.news.com.au/features/moment-of-the-decade/its-the-end-of-the-noughties-we-feel-fine/story-fn488f89-1225791181896 | archivedate=2010-11-19 |deadurl=no |accessdate=12 May 2013[/tpl] While most people pronounced the years 2000 to 2009 as "two thousand (and) _", the pronunciation in the 2010s has been mixed. The year 2014, for example, is referred to by some as "twenty-fourteen" and by others as "two thousand (and) fourteen" and this mixed pronunciation continues as of today.[tpl]cite news |last=Burnett |first=Thane |date=28 December 2009 |title=Twenty-ten, Two-oh-ten, Two thousand and ten: What is the proper way to reference 2010? |newspaper=Toronto Sun |url=http://www.torontosun.com/life/columnists/thane_burnett/2009/12/24/12265106.html |accessdate=11 January 2011[/tpl][tpl]failed verification|date=February 2013[/tpl]

==Global financial crisis==

The 2010s began amidst a global financial crisis that started in the late 2000s. In particular, the ongoing Eurozone debt crisis, which stemmed from these economic problems, first became pronounced in May 2010 and continues with a global recovery. Along with the recovery in 2013, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a 5-year high on Tuesday, May 28, 2013, and it is continuing to slowly rise.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] Also, the Dow had its longest stretch of gains since the tech boom of the late 1990s.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] But, economic issues such as inflation, and an increase in commodity prices, sparked immense unrest in many lower-income countries. In some countries, particularly Arab ones, political unrest eventually evolved into socio-economic crises which set off numerous revolutions, such as in Kyrgyzstan and Tunisia in 2010, and Libya, Syria, Yemen and Egypt in 2011 and 2012. This widespread phenomenon is commonly known as the Arab Spring, and it still continues, as of April 2014.

In most cases, votes to legalize same-sex marriage fall along a strict-party line vote with leftist parties favoring legalization and more conservative ones favoring no recognition at all. However, as the culture continues to shift more supportive, conservatives are growing more comfortable with marriage equality as was the case for New York's effort to legalize same-sex marriage and the ongoing debate in the United Kingdom, where legalization of same-sex marriage has been seen as a priority by the Conservative Party.[tpl]cite web|author=Theodore B.

Youth culture such as skateboarding continues to spread to countries such as Afghanistan.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.grindtv.com/skate/blog/23666/skateboarding+school+helps+to+empower+kids+in+afghanistan|title=Skateboarding school helps to empower kids in Afghanistan|author=Pete Thomas|publisher=GrindTV[/tpl] Internet memes grew in popularity across the Internet since around late 2009, although internet memes existed as far back as the web's infancy in the 1990s. Current trends set Internet memes to grow hugely and enter the mainstream of TV and general entertainment in the coming years. In 2013, Baauer's Harlem shake is the first internet meme song to reach the #1 spot on the Billboard Top 100, reflecting a shift in popular culture as internet memes become mainstream and not a "geek" counterculture.

The world's major civilizations are now interacting more than ever in history, creating tensions but also bringing new ideas to cultures that previously did not have them. This occurs more often not only physically but in cyberspace. This is radically changing the economic and social fabric in virtually every part of the world. China, considered an emerging power in the 1990s and 2000s, has increasingly been called a superpower in the early 2010s, such as at the 2011 meeting between Hu Jintao and Barack Obama. This is confirmed by China overtaking the US as the world's largest trading nation, filing the most patents, its increasing military buildup, its involvement in space with the Jade Rabbit landing on the moon, ending the nearly four decade malaise of moon exploration, and the creation of China's Oriental Movie Metropolis as a major film and cultural center. China is projected to have the world's largest economy by 2018 and most likely have a GDP per capita equal to the US by the late 2050s.http://uk.news.yahoo.com/5/20110119/twl-superpower-talks-china-faces-tough-u-3fd0ae9.html

===Theatre===

The trend of musicals based on movies reaches a peak in 2013 when for the first time, the four nominees for the Best Musical Tony Award are all based on movies.
Rights for many shows from the 2000s, including The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, Spring Awakening, and Hairspray, were released for amateur production.
Locally, many theaters begin to perform smaller productions with less actor and set requirements as a way of coping with the Great Recession. This made shows like the aforementioned Spelling Bee into standards.

===Video gaming===

Coming into the 2010s, video games and their associated culture matures into an established element of pop culture. According to the Entertainment Software Association, the average age of a person who plays games is 30.The Entertainment Software Association - Industry Facts
Some of the new and innovative trends to gaming culture in this decade include cloud gaming, the rise of 3D gaming, and the ever-increasing advancements in graphic card technologies leading to more photo-realistic graphics. Video game sales declined in the early-2010s, most likely due to the effects of the Great Recession,[tpl]cite news| url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/11/video-game-industry-dips-further-in-may/ | work=The New York Times | first=Matt | last=Richtel | title=Video Games Aren't Recession-Proof | date=11 June 2009[/tpl] but the industry still continued to make millions of dollars in profits from wide-releases of popular franchises. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, released in late-2011, made over US$775 million in one-week which put that particular first-person shooter video game on par or even surpassing records of the film industry's opening numbers that week.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/nov/18/modern-warfare-2-records-775m | location=London |title=Modern Warfare 3 smashes records: $775m in sales in five days |deadurl=no |accessdate=12 May 2013 |work=The Guardian |first=Keith |last=Stuart |date=18 November 2011[/tpl]
The first few years of the decade was dominated primarily with seventh generation consoles. This includes Microsoft's Xbox 360, the Sony PlayStation 3, and Nintendo's Wii.

In late 2013, two consoles were added to the eighth generation with Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4. The eighth generation consoles are expected to face stiff competition from tablet and smartphone gaming markets, as well as an increased interest in independent games promoted by popular social networking sites.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-19/nintendo-may-fail-to-replicate-wii-success-as-iphone-games-bloom.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Pavel | last=Alpeyev | title=Nintendo May Fail to Replicate Wii Success as IPhone Games Bloom | date=19 June 2011[/tpl]Facebook Gaming: 10 Facebook Games Stats | Digital Buzz Blog

===Fashion===

The 2010s (2010–present) have thus far been defined by a revival of interwar, Austerity era, 1980s (from late 2012 onwards), early 1990s and skater fashions.1980s style Baseball jacket In the early 2010s, many mid and late 2000s fashions remain popular in Europe, the US, Latin America, Australasia and Asia, especially the indie pop look which largely drew upon 1960s Mod clothing combined with elements of 1970s garage rock, contemporary alternative fashion. Latin American teens and young adults, who started to keep up with general Western fashion more closely since the mid-1990s, proved to be more conservative upon maintaining or abandoning 2000s trends than their European and North American peers until about 2013. Urban, Hipster and Vintage-styles are really common since 2012 and 2013. From 2014, neon and pastel colors are really fashionable. Full-printed T-shirts with diverse patterns (like cosmic, clouds, historic architecture) are a huge fashion trend since then. Their popularity is increasing rapidly, mostly for the youth.
