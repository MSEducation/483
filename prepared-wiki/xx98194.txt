Rockbridge State Nature Preserve is located in Hocking County, Ohio, United States, west of the city of Logan.  It is part of the Hocking Hills Region, but the actual natural bridge in the preserve is formed of sandstone lower in the stratigraphic sequence than that which forms most of the notable features of the area.  The preserve comprises [tpl]convert|182|acre|km2[/tpl].
The preserve proper is reached from the parking area by a 3/8 mile (600 m) trail on a narrow neck of land acquired for trail access.  The preserve features two loop trails, one of which passes the natural bridge, which is the largest in Ohio, and the other of which goes to a rock shelter.  These formations are set back from the banks of the Hocking River only a short distance.
