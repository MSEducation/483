"Was it worth it?" is the second single released by UK electronic music group Pet Shop Boys from their compilation album Discography: The Complete Singles Collection.
The single peaked at #24 on the UK Singles Chart, reaching the UK Top 25 but becoming the group's first single to not reach the Top 20 since they signed to Parlophone in 1984, (the second being "Numb", fifteen years later). This was the main reason why the song was not included on their later hits compilation PopArt, although it was on the DVD edition. The single's B-side was "Miserablism".
