The Geelong Raiders Rugby League Football Club are an Australian rugby league football club based in Newtown, Victoria. They compete in the Victorian Rugby League competition. 
The club started life as the Geelong Tiger Snakes, but in 2010 the club folded due to flagging numbers and the effects of the GFC.
In June 2010 a new committee was formed and the Tiger Snakes were officially retired, with the club re-launching as the Geelong Raiders, bringing with it new leadership, and a new direction.
In December of 2010 the club appointed John O'Bryan as President along with Nick McDonald as Vice President and Kalli Ratcliff as the Secretary. These new appointments were made to steer the Raiders into the new year and to see the club go from strength to strength.
One of the first actions as a new club saw the appointment of Matt Goschnick as the Senior Coach with Doug Harrington appointed to the Coaching Panel.
Presently the Geelong Raiders are a community based club who foster a sense of inclusion and cultural acceptance. The Raiders invite everyoe with an interest in Rugby League to join them in this pursuit.
