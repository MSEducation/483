==Design==

The tower reflects a blend of Mughal, Islamic and modern architecture.
The tower was designed and supervised by Nasreddin Murat-Khan, an architect and engineer hailing from Daghestan.[tpl]cite news|title=Remembrance: The man behind the masterpiece|url=http://archives.dawn.com/archives/45887|accessdate=5 December 2012|newspaper=Dawn (newspaper)[tpl]![/tpl]Dawn|author=Meral Murat Khan[/tpl] The structural design was given by Nasreddin Murat-Khan (who also completed his engineering degree from St. Petersburg State University) and not Abdur Khan Niazi (who was an engineering assistant working for Murat Khan). Approved by the President, the design was built by Mian Abdul Khaliq and Company.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] The foundation stone was laid on 23 March 1960. The construction took eight years, and was completed in 1968. The Minar was completed on 31 October 1968 at an estimated cost of Rs. 705,8000. The money was collected by imposing an additional tax on the cinema and horse racing tickets on the demand of Akhtar Hussain, governor of West Pakistan. Today, the minaret provides a panoramic view to visitors who can climb up the stairs or through an elevator. The parks around the monument include marble fountains and an artificial lake.

===Structure===

The base is about 8 metres above the ground. The tower rises about 62 meters on the base, thus the total height of minaret is about 92 meters above the ground. The unfolding petals of the flower-like base are 9 metres high. The diameter of the tower is about 9.75 meters. The rostrum is built of patterned tiles, and faces the Badshahi Mosque. The base comprises four platforms. To symbolise humble beginnings of the freedom struggle, first platform is built with uncut Taxila stones, second platform is made of hammer-dressed stones, whereas third platform is of chiselled stones. Polished white marble at the fourth and final platform depicts the success of the Pakistan Movement.Amna Jamal (2002) The Pakistan Day memorial. Dawn. 23 March. Retrieved 12 February 2008 Mr. Mukhtar Masood, a prolific writer and the then–deputy commissioner of Lahore, was one of the members of the Building Committee.

===Inscriptions===

At the base, there are floral inscriptions on ten converging white marble Commemorative plaques. The inscriptions include the text of Lahore Resolution in Urdu, Bengali and English, and Delhi Resolution's text, which was passed on 9 April 1946. On different plaques, Quranic verses and 99 attributes of Allah are inscribed in Arabic calligraphy, whereas National Anthem of Pakistan in Urdu and Bengali, excerpts from the speeches of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in Urdu, Bengali and English, as well as few couplets of Allama Iqbal are inscribed.Amna Jamal (2002) The Pakistan Day memorial.

==Concerns==

With the growth of the city and location of the monument at busy intersection of Circular Road and Multan Road, air pollution from traffic-congestion is continuously damaging the marble structure which is now in need of refurbishment.

==Political Stands==

Minar-e-Pakistan has always served as the location a number of political protests and rallies, like PML(N), PTI, PPP, etc.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-93467-PTI-to-stage-rally-at-Minar-e-Pakistan-today- |title=PTI to stage rally at Minar-e-Pakistan today |work=The News International |date=23 March 2013[/tpl][tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
