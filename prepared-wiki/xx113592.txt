Woodcrest is a station on the PATCO Speedline rapid transit system. The station is located in the Woodcrest section of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, at the intersection of Woodcrest Road and Melrose Avenue.  Woodcrest was a later addition to the original PATCO system and was designed as a Park and Ride facility with a direct connection to the adjacent Interstate 295 via exit 31.  Woodcrest opened in 1980 and features expansive parking facilities that even a quarter century later still do not completely fill up on a typical weekday.  The opening of Woodcrest coincided with the delivery of the 46 additional PATCO II transit cars from Vickers Canada to handle the increased rush hour passenger traffic.   
Woodcrest is unique in that it consists of two parallel platforms with a full length pocket track in the middle.  The center track is used to originate and terminate Woodcrest Local trains during the morning and evening peak periods to fill in gaps created by the limited express service.  Woodcrest is the first stop in the outermost (formerly "Blue") fare zone.
Like all PATCO stations, Woodcrest is a two level station. The ticketing and fare control are located on the lower level, which is at ground level.
