==Scope and operations==

(See also List of presidents of the American Medical Association)
The AMA's stated mission is to promote the art and science of medicine for the betterment of the public health, to advance the interests of physicians and their patients, to promote public health, to lobby for legislation favorable to physicians and patients, and to raise money for medical education. The Association also publishes the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), which has the largest circulation of any weekly medical journal in the world.[tpl]cite web |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/misc/aboutjama.dtl |title=About JAMA: JAMA website[/tpl] The AMA also publishes a list of Physician Specialty Codes which are the standard method in the U.S. for identifying physician and practice specialties.
The AMA has one of the largest political lobbying budgets of any organization in the United States.[tpl]cite journal | title = Our Corrupt Politics: It's Not All Money | journal = The New York Review of Books | date = 22 Mar 2012 | first = Ezra | last = Klein | url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/mar/22/our-corrupt-politics-its-not-all-money/ | accessdate = 2013-06-30[/tpl] Its political positions throughout its history have often been controversial. In the 1930s, the AMA attempted to prohibit its members from working for the then-primitive health maintenance organizations that had sprung up during the Great Depression, which violated the Sherman Antitrust Act and resulted in a conviction ultimately affirmed by the US Supreme Court.American Medical Ass'n. v. United States, [tpl]ussc|317|519|1943[/tpl] The AMA's vehement campaign against Medicare in the 1950s and 1960s included the Operation Coffee Cup supported by Ronald Reagan. Since the enactment of Medicare, the AMA reversed its position and now opposes any "cut to Medicare funding or shift of increased costs to beneficiaries at the expense of the quality or accessibility of care". However, the AMA remains opposed to any single-payer health care plan that might enact a National Health Service in the United States, such as the United States National Health Care Act. In the 1990s, the organization was part of the coalition that defeated the health care reform advanced by Hillary and Bill Clinton.
The AMA has also supported changes in medical malpractice law to limit damage awards, which, it contends, makes it difficult for patients to find appropriate medical care. In many states, high risk specialists have moved to other states that have enacted reform. For example, in 2004, all neurosurgeons had relocated out of the entire southern half of Illinois  [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]. The main legislative emphasis in multiple states has been to effect caps on the amount that patients can receive for pain and suffering. These costs for pain and suffering are only those that exceed the actual costs of healthcare and lost income. At the same time however, states without caps also experienced similar results; suggesting that other market factors may have contributed to the decreases. Some economic studies have found that caps have historically had an uncertain effect on premium rates.Weiss Ratings News: Medical Malpractice Caps Fail to Prevent Premium Increases, According to Weiss Ratings Study Nevertheless, the AMA believes the caps may alleviate what is often perceived as an excessively litigious environment for many doctors.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]  A recent report by the AMA found that in a 12 month period, five percent of physicians had claims filed against them.Medical Liability Claim Frequency: A 2007-2008 Snapshot of Physicians
Claims that the AMA generates $70 million in revenue through its stewardship of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes appear to be a mischaracterization.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]  The estimate is based on a distortion[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] of the transparent financial information the AMA voluntarily offers in its Annual Report.  The AMA has publicly reported this figure represents income from its complete line of books and products, which include more than 100 items, not just CPT.http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/37/2009-annual-report.pdf
The AMA sponsors the Specialty Society Relative Value Scale Update Committee which is an influential group of 29 physicians, mostly specialists, who help determine the value of different physician's labor in Medicare prices.
Collections of the association's papers dating from the late 1860s to the late 1960s are held at the National Library of Medicine.[tpl]cite web|url=http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/ama461|title=American Medical Association annual meetings collection 1866-1890|publisher=National Library of Medicine[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/ama556|title=AMA Deceased Physicians Masterfile 1906-1969|publisher=National Library of Medicine[/tpl]

==Charitable activities==

==Politics==

Throughout its history, the AMA has been actively involved in a variety of medical policy issues, from Medicare and HMOs to public health, and climate change. Between 1998 and 2011, the AMA spent $264 million on lobbyists, second only to the American Chamber of Commerce.
