==History==

Danes Worldwide was founded as Dansk Samvirke in 1919 as an initiative to strengthen the ties between Denmark and Danish emigrants around the world at a time when emigration to the USA and South America was at its height.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.danes.dk/index.dsp?page=3560|title=History|publisher=Danes Worldwide|accessdate=2011-09-26[/tpl]
During World War II membership increasesd drastically, peaking in 1947 to 10,000 members. The war made contact to Danes abroad very difficult and many Danish expats, especially in the Far East, lost their livelihood. Dansk Samvirke concentrated its efforts on helping those returning to Denmark. Chairman Jørgen Saxild launched an almost ten-year aid programme ranging from financial support to a social service for those who lost everything.
After the war, in 1949, the association acquired its own building, a property in the diplomatic quarter of the Østerbro district of  Copenhagen, which served both as an office and a meeting place for Danes who returned home.
In 1998, Dansk Samvirke changed its name to Danes Worldwide and acquired a new logo, a "Danish globe" designed by Piet Hein.
