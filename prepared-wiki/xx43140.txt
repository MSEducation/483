Psilotum (whisk fern) is a genus of fern-like vascular plants, one of two genera in the family Psilotaceae, order Psilotales, and class Psilotopsida (the other being Tmesipteris). The name of the genus is from Greek psilos = tall.

==Species and distribution==

There are two species, Psilotum nudum and Psilotum complanatum, with a hybrid between them known, Psilotum × intermedium W. H. Wagner. 
The distribution of Psilotum is tropical and subtropical, in the New World, Asia, and the Pacific, with a few isolated populations in SW Europe. The highest latitudes known are in South Carolina, Cádiz province in Spain,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.mma.es/portal/secciones/biodiversidad/inventarios/inb/flora_vascular/pdf/1066.pdf | work = Atlas y Libro Rojo de la Flora Vascular Amenazada de España | title = Psilotum nudum[/tpl] and southern Japan for P. nudum.  In the U.S., one species is found from Florida to Texas, the other in Hawaii.

==Relation to ferns==

Psilotum superficially resembles certain extinct early vascular plants, such as the rhyniophytes and the trimerophyte genus Psilophyton. The unusual features of Psilotum that suggest an affinity with early vascular plants include dichotomously branching sporophytes, aerial stems arising from horizontal rhizomes, a simple vascular cylinder, homosporous and terminal eusporangia and a lack of roots.[tpl]cite book |last1=Gifford |first1=Ernest |title=Morphology and Evolution of Vascular Plants, Third Edition|year=1989|publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company|location=New York|isbn=0716719460|author2=Adriance Foster[/tpl] Unfortunately, no fossils of psilophytes are known to exist. A careful study of the morphology and anatomy suggests that whisk ferns are not closely related to rhyniophytes, and that the ancestral features present in living psilophytes represent a reduction from a more typical modern fern plant.
Molecular evidenceQiu, Y-L and Palmer, J (1999) "Phylogeny of early land plants: insights from genes and genomes." Trends in Plant Science 4(1), 26-30 strongly confirms that Psilotum is a fern and that psilophytes are sister to ophioglossoid ferns.

==Gametophyte==

The gametophyte of Psilotum nudum L. Beauv. (P. triquetrum Swartz) is unusual in that it branches dichotomously, lives underground and possesses vascular tissue.Holloway,  J.E.  (1939) The gametophyte, embryo and young rhizome of Psilotum triquetrum Schwarz. Annals of Botany 3, 313-336  The nutrition of the gametophyte appears to be myco-heterotrophic, assisted by endophytic fungi.Manton, I.
