After leaving the RAF in the early 1950s, Clark got a job in car retail and saved up his money until he was able to purchase a Morris Ten-Four for £70, and after restoring it, sold it for a profit. Clark started buying and selling cars, opening his first showroom in 1954 in Glasgow's Park Road.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arnoldclark.com/about/company/history.html|title=About Us|publisher=ArnoldClark.com|accessdate=2009-07-05| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090621002009/http://www.arnoldclark.com/about/company/history.html| archivedate= 21 June 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] After gaining his first retail franchise for Morris Motors in 1959, expansion continued with the purchase of existing sites and rivals in and around the Glasgow area.

==GTG==

A new custom built conference centre, GTG Training, was officially opened on the regenerated Clydeside area of Glasgow.
The [tpl]convert|61000|sqft|m2|abbr=on[/tpl] centre is split into two dedicated sections; the fully operational transport division caters for every aspect in automotive training whilst the IT and business skills division provides a range of business skill training courses and a conference area. A new training centre was also built in Wolverhampton in 2013. A new training centre is currently being built to replace Edinburgh's current centre.

==Drum==

Clark bought racing yacht Drum from Duran Duran singer Simon Le Bon. She had finished third (line honours) in the 1985-86 Whitbread Round the World Race (now the Volvo Ocean Race), having previously lost her keel and capsized in the 1985 Fastnet Race just weeks before the Whitbread start. Drum is now hired out for corporate entertainment from her base on the River Clyde, and has been used to raise in excess of £1 million for charity. In the spring of 2007 a £250,000 refit was completed on Drum.
