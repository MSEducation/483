Root Supposed He Was Out Of The Question... is the debut album by Melbourne band Root!, released on December 7, 2007. The album is the band's signature mix of country, rock and ironic lyrics, as well as sections of spoken word.
Although the album was initially planned to be released in August 2007, the band was unhappy with the mix and decided that a full remixing must take place before the album was to be released.
