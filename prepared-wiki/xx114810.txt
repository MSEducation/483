[[Enoplomischus]]

CATEGORIES: Salticidae

Enoplomischus is a genus of the spider family Salticidae (jumping spiders).
This genus has a large spike-like process on its pedicel. This structure probably mimics a similar spike present in the anterior part of the abdomen of the Odontomachus ants that these spiders seem to be modeled after.
