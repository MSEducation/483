The President of Nauru is elected by Parliament from amongst its members. He or she is both the head of state and head of government of Nauru. Nauru's unicameral Parliament has 19 members, with an electoral term of 3 years. Political parties only play a minor role in Nauru politics, and there has often been significant periods of instability in the Presidential office.  The even number[tpl]huh|date=January 2014[/tpl] of seats in the Parliament and shifting allegiances amongst a small number of individuals can lead to frequent changes in the makeup of the government of the day, including the Presidential position itself.
