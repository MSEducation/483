[[Latins]]

CATEGORIES: Latin language

The term "Latins" refers to the original Italic tribe and those of Latin descent that speak or once spoke a Romance language (see Latin peoples).
The original Latins were an Italic tribe inhabiting central Italy, in present day Lazio. Through the conquests of their most populous city-state, Rome, the Latins culturally "Romanized" or "Latinized" the rest of Italy, and the word Latin ceased to mean a particular ethnicity, acquiring a more cultural sense. As the Roman Empire spread to include Spain, Portugal, France, and Romania, these joined Italy in becoming "Latin" and remain so to the present day. In the late 15thâ€“16th centuries, a millennium after the fall of the Western Roman Empire (of which they were members), Portugal, Spain, and France began to create world empires. In consequence, by the mid-19th century the former American colonies of these Latin nations became known as Latin America and this region's inhabitants as Latin Americans. In the present day, the demonym for Latin Americans of Latin European descent is "Latino" and "Latina".
