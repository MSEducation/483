</ref> although the recent discovery of the Higgs boson has increased the number of works considering the Higgs field as inflaton.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] Other models of inflation relied on the properties of grand unified theories.<ref name="albrecht" /> Since the simplest models of [[grand unification]] have failed, it is now thought by many physicists that inflation will be included in a [[supersymmetric]] theory like [[string theory]] or a supersymmetric grand unified theory. At present, while inflation is understood principally by its detailed predictions of the [[boundary condition|initial conditions]] for the hot early universe, the particle physics is largely ''ad hoc'' modelling. As such, though predictions of inflation have been consistent with the results of observational tests, there are many open questions about the theory.

===Fine-tuning problem===

====Andrei Linde====

Andrei Linde proposed a theory known as chaotic inflation in which he suggested that the conditions for inflation are actually satisfied quite generically and inflation will occur in virtually any universe that begins in a chaotic, high energy state and has a scalar field with unbounded potential energy.[tpl]Cite journal|first=Andrei D.|last=Linde|title=Chaotic inflation|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(83)90837-7|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=129|issue=3|pages=171–81|year=1983 [/tpl] However, in his model the inflaton field necessarily takes values larger than one Planck unit: for this reason, these are often called large field models and the competing new inflation models are called small field models. In this situation, the predictions of effective field theory are thought to be invalid, as renormalization should cause large corrections that could prevent inflation.Technically, this is because the inflaton potential is expressed as a Taylor series in φ/mPl, where φ is the inflaton and mPl is the Planck mass. While for a single term, such as the mass term mφ4(φ/mPl)2, the slow roll conditions can be satisfied for φ much greater than mPl, this is precisely the situation in effective field theory in which higher order terms would be expected to contribute and destroy the conditions for inflation. The absence of these higher order corrections can be seen as another sort of fine tuning. See e.g. [tpl]Cite journal|first=Laila|last=Alabidi|title=Inflation models and observation | doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2006/05/016|journal=JCAP|volume=0605|issue=5|year=2006|pages=016|arxiv=astro-ph/0510441|last2=Lyth|first2=David H|bibcode = 2006JCAP...05..016A [/tpl] This problem has not yet been resolved and some cosmologists argue that the small field models, in which inflation can occur at a much lower energy scale, are better models of inflation.See, e.g. [tpl]Cite journal|title=What would we learn by detecting a gravitational wave signal in the cosmic microwave background anisotropy? | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.1861|first=David H.|last=Lyth|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=78|issue=10|pages=1861–3|year=1997|arxiv=hep-ph/9606387|url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?rawcmd=FIND+EPRINT+HEP-PH/9606387|bibcode = 1997PhRvL..78.1861L [/tpl] While inflation depends on quantum field theory (and the semiclassical approximation to quantum gravity) in an important way, it has not been completely reconciled with these theories. The BICEP2 experiment detected evidence for primordial gravitational waves consistent with Linde's model.
Robert Brandenberger has commented on fine-tuning in another situation.[tpl]Cite conference|title=Challenges for inflationary cosmology|first=Robert H.|last=Brandenberger|date=November 2004|booktitle=10th International Symposium on Particles, Strings and Cosmology|arxiv=astro-ph/0411671[/tpl] The amplitude of the primordial inhomogeneities produced in inflation is directly tied to the energy scale of inflation. There are strong suggestions that this scale is around 1016 GeV or 10−3 times the Planck energy. The natural scale is naïvely the Planck scale so this small value could be seen as another form of fine-tuning (called a hierarchy problem): the energy density given by the scalar potential is down by 10−12 compared to the Planck density. This is not usually considered to be a critical problem, however, because the scale of inflation corresponds naturally to the scale of gauge unification.

===Eternal inflation===

In many models of inflation, the inflationary phase of the universe's expansion lasts forever in at least some regions of the universe. This occurs because inflating regions expand very rapidly, reproducing themselves. Unless the rate of decay to the non-inflating phase is sufficiently fast, new inflating regions are produced more rapidly than non-inflating regions. In such models most of the volume of the universe at any given time is inflating. All models of eternal inflation produce an infinite multiverse, typically a fractal.
Although new inflation is classically rolling down the potential, quantum fluctuations can sometimes bring it back up to previous levels. These regions in which the inflaton fluctuates upwards expand much faster than regions in which the inflaton has a lower potential energy, and tend to dominate in terms of physical volume. This steady state, which first developed by Vilenkin,[tpl]Cite journal|first=Alexander|last=Vilenkin|title=The birth of inflationary universes | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.27.2848|journal=Physical Review D|volume=27|issue=12|pages=2848|year=1983|bibcode = 1983PhRvD..27.2848V [/tpl] is called "eternal inflation". It has been shown that any inflationary theory with an unbounded potential is eternal.[tpl]Cite journal| author = A.

However, unlike de Sitter space, fluctuations in a contracting inflationary space will collapse to form a gravitational singularity, a point where densities become infinite. Therefore, it is necessary to have a theory for the universe's initial conditions. Linde, however, believes inflation may be past eternal.Linde (2005, §V).
In eternal inflation, regions with inflation have an exponentially growing volume, while regions that are not inflating don't. This suggests that the volume of the inflating part of the universe in the global picture is always unimaginably larger than the part that has stopped inflating, even though inflation eventually ends as seen by any single pre-inflationary observer. Scientists disagree about how to assign a probability distribution to this hypothetical anthropic landscape. If the probability of different regions is counted by volume, one should expect that inflation will never end, or applying boundary conditions that a local observer exists to observe it, that inflation will end as late as possible. Some physicists believe this paradox can be resolved by weighting observers by their pre-inflationary volume.

===Initial conditions===

Some physicists have tried to avoid the initial conditions problem by proposing models for an eternally inflating universe with no origin.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Does inflation provide natural initial conditions for the universe?|first=Sean M.|last=Carroll|journal=Gen. Rel. Grav.|volume=37|issue=10|pages=1671–4|year=2005|arxiv=gr-qc/0505037|doi=10.1007/s10714-005-0148-2|last2=Chen|first2=Jennifer|bibcode = 2005GReGr..37.1671C [/tpl][tpl]cite arXiv|title=Spontaneous inflation and the origin of the arrow of time|first=Sean M.|last=Carroll|eprint=hep-th/0410270|bibcode = 2004hep.th...10270C|author2=Jennifer Chen|class=hep-th|year=2004 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | first1=Anthony |last1=Aguirre|first2= Steven |last2=Gratton|title=Inflation without a beginning: A null boundary proposal| journal= Physical Review D | volume=67 |year=2003|page= 083515|arxiv=gr-qc/0301042|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.67.083515 | issue=8 |bibcode = 2003PhRvD..67h3515A [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | first1=Anthony |last1=Aguirre|first2= Steven |last2=Gratton|title=Steady-State Eternal Inflation|journal= Physical Review D |volume=65 |year=2002|page= 083507|arxiv=astro-ph/0111191 |bibcode = 2002PhRvD..65h3507A |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.65.083507 | issue=8 [/tpl] These models propose that while the universe, on the largest scales, expands exponentially it was, is and always will be, spatially infinite and has existed, and will exist, forever.
Other proposals attempt to describe the ex nihilo creation of the universe based on quantum cosmology and the following inflation. Vilenkin put forth one such scenario. Hartle and Hawking offered the no-boundary proposal for the initial creation of the universe in which inflation comes about naturally.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.28.2960| title=Wave function of the universe | year = 1983 | last1 = Hartle | first1 = J. | last2 = Hawking | first2 = S. | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 28 | issue = 12 | pages = 2960 |bibcode = 1983PhRvD..28.2960H [/tpl]; See also Hawking (1998).
Alan Guth has described the inflationary universe as the "ultimate free lunch":Hawking (1998), p. 129.Wikiquote new universes, similar to our own, are continually produced in a vast inflating background. Gravitational interactions, in this case, circumvent (but do not violate) the first law of thermodynamics (energy conservation) and the second law of thermodynamics (entropy and the arrow of time problem). However, while there is consensus that this solves the initial conditions problem, some have disputed this, as it is much more likely that the universe came about by a quantum fluctuation. Donald Page was an outspoken critic of inflation because of this anomaly.[tpl]cite journal | title=Inflation does not explain time asymmetry| bibcode=1983Natur.304...39P | doi=10.1038/304039a0 | year=1983 | last1=Page | first1=Don N. | journal=Nature | volume=304 | issue=5921 | pages=39[/tpl]; see also Roger Penrose's book The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe. He stressed that the thermodynamic arrow of time necessitates low entropy initial conditions, which would be highly unlikely. According to them, rather than solving this problem, the inflation theory further aggravates it – the reheating at the end of the inflation era increases entropy, making it necessary for the initial state of the Universe to be even more orderly than in other Big Bang theories with no inflation phase.
Hawking and Page later found ambiguous results when they attempted to compute the probability of inflation in the Hartle-Hawking initial state.[tpl]Cite journal|title=How probable is inflation?|first=S. W.|last=Hawking|year=1988|volume=298|issue=4|pages=789|journal=Nuclear Physics B|doi=10.1016/0550-3213(88)90008-9|bibcode = 1988NuPhB.298..789H|last2=Page|first2=Don N. [/tpl] Other authors have argued that, since inflation is eternal, the probability doesn't matter as long as it is not precisely zero: once it starts, inflation perpetuates itself and quickly dominates the universe.[tpl]rp|223-225[/tpl]  However, Albrecht and Lorenzo Sorbo have argued that the probability of an inflationary cosmos, consistent with today's observations, emerging by a random fluctuation from some pre-existent state, compared with a non-inflationary cosmos overwhelmingly favours the inflationary scenario, simply because the "seed" amount of non-gravitational energy required for the inflationary cosmos is so much less than any required for a non-inflationary alternative, which outweighs any entropic considerations.[tpl]Cite journal|first=Andreas|last=Albrecht|title=Can the universe afford inflation?|journal=Physical Review D|volume=70|pages=063528|year=2004|arxiv=hep-th/0405270|bibcode = 2004PhRvD..70f3528A |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.70.063528|last2=Sorbo|first2=Lorenzo|issue=6 [/tpl]
Another problem that has occasionally been mentioned is the trans-Planckian problem or trans-Planckian effects.[tpl]Cite journal|first=Jerome|last2=Brandenberger|last=Martin|first2=Robert|title=The trans-Planckian problem of inflationary cosmology|journal=Physical Review D|volume=63|year=2001|issue=12|pages=123501|arxiv=hep-th/0005209|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.63.123501|bibcode = 2001PhRvD..63l3501M [/tpl] Since the energy scale of inflation and the Planck scale are relatively close, some of the quantum fluctuations that have made up the structure in our universe were smaller than the Planck length before inflation. Therefore, there ought to be corrections from Planck-scale physics, in particular the unknown quantum theory of gravity. There has been some disagreement about the magnitude of this effect: about whether it is just on the threshold of detectability or completely undetectable.[tpl]Cite journal|first=Jerome|last=Martin|title=Superimposed Oscillations in the WMAP Data?|journal=Physical Review D|volume=69|issue=8|year=2004|pages=083515|arxiv=astro-ph/0310382|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.69.083515|last2=Ringeval|first2=Christophe|bibcode = 2004PhRvD..69h3515M [/tpl]

===Hybrid inflation===

Another kind of inflation, called hybrid inflation, is an extension of new inflation. It introduces additional scalar fields, so that while one of the scalar fields is responsible for normal slow roll inflation, another triggers the end of inflation: when inflation has continued for sufficiently long, it becomes favorable to the second field to decay into a much lower energy state.[ref]Robert H. Brandenberger, "A Status Review of Inflationary Cosmology", proceedings
Journal-ref: BROWN-HET-1256 (2001), (available from [tpl]arxiv|hep-ph/0101119v1[/tpl] 11 January 2001)[/ref]
In hybrid inflation, one of the scalar fields is responsible for most of the energy density (thus determining the rate of expansion), while the other is responsible for the slow roll (thus determining the period of inflation and its termination). Thus fluctuations in the former inflaton would not affect inflation termination, while fluctuations in the latter would not affect the rate of expansion. Therefore hybrid inflation is not eternal.Andrei Linde, "Prospects of Inflation", Physica Scripta Online (2004) (available from [tpl]arxiv|hep-th/0402051[/tpl] )Blanco-Pillado et al., "Racetrack inflation", (2004) (available from [tpl]arxiv|hep-th/0406230[/tpl] ) When the second (slow-rolling) inflaton reaches the bottom of its potential, it changes the location of the minimum of the first inflaton's potential, which leads to a fast roll of the inflaton down its potential, leading to termination of inflation.

===Inflation and string cosmology===

The discovery of flux compactifications have opened the way for reconciling inflation and string theory.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Towards inflation in string theory|first=Shamit|last=Kachru|year=2003|journal=JCAP|volume=0310|pages=013|arxiv=hep-th/0308055|bibcode = 2003JCAP...10..013K |doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2003/10/013|last2=Kallosh|first2=Renata|last3=Linde|first3=Andrei|last4=Maldacena|first4=Juan|last5=McAllister|first5=Liam|last6=Trivedi|first6=Sandip P|issue=10 [/tpl] A new theory, called brane inflation suggests that inflation arises from the motion of D-branesG. R. Dvali, S. H. Henry Tye, Brane inflation, Phys.Lett. B450, 72-82 (1999), [tpl]arxiv|hep-ph/9812483[/tpl]. in the compactified geometry, usually towards a stack of anti-D-branes. This theory, governed by the Dirac-Born-Infeld action, is very different from ordinary inflation. The dynamics are not completely understood. It appears that special conditions are necessary since inflation occurs in tunneling between two vacua in the string landscape. The process of tunneling between two vacua is a form of old inflation, but new inflation must then occur by some other mechanism.

===Inflation and loop quantum gravity===

When investigating the effects the theory of loop quantum gravity would have on cosmology, a loop quantum cosmology model has evolved that provides a possible mechanism for cosmological inflation. Loop quantum gravity assumes a quantized spacetime. If the energy density is larger than can be held by the quantized spacetime, it is thought to bounce back. 

===Inflation and generalized uncertainty principle (GUP)===

The effects of generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) on the inflationary dynamics and the thermodynamics of the early Universe are studied.A. Tawfik, H. Magdy and A. Farag Ali, Gen.Rel.Grav. 45 (2013) 1227-1246 Using the GUP approach, Tawfik et al. evaluated the tensorial and scalar density fluctuations in the inflation era and compared them with the standard case. They found a good agreement with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data. Assuming that a quantum gas of scalar particles is confined within a thin layer near the apparent horizon of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker Universe that satisfies the boundary condition, Tawfik et al. calculated the number and entropy densities and the free energy arising from the quantum states using the GUP approach. Furthermore, a qualitative estimation for effects of the quantum gravity on all these thermodynamic quantities was introduced.

==Alternatives to inflation==

The flatness and horizon problems are naturally solved in the Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble theory of gravity, without needing an exotic form of matter and introducing free parameters.[tpl]cite journal |author=Poplawski, N. J. |year=2010 |title=Cosmology with torsion: An alternative to cosmic inflation| journal=Physics Letters B |volume=694 |issue=3 |pages=181–185 |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2010.09.056|arxiv = 1007.0587 |bibcode = 2010PhLB..694..181P [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Poplawski, N. |year=2012 |title=Nonsingular, big-bounce cosmology from spinor-torsion coupling |journal=Physical Review D |volume=85 |issue=10 |pages=107502 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.85.107502|arxiv = 1111.4595 |bibcode = 2012PhRvD..85j7502P [/tpl] This theory extends general relativity by removing a constraint of the symmetry of the affine connection and regarding its antisymmetric part, the torsion tensor, as a dynamical variable. The minimal coupling between torsion and Dirac spinors generates a spin-spin interaction that is significant in fermionic matter at extremely high densities. Such an interaction averts the unphysical Big Bang singularity, replacing it with a cusp-like bounce at a finite minimum scale factor, before which the Universe was contracting. The rapid expansion immediately after the Big Bounce explains why the present Universe at largest scales appears spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic. As the density of the Universe decreases, the effects of torsion weaken and the Universe smoothly enters the radiation-dominated era.
There are models that explain some of the observations explained by inflation. However none of these "alternatives" has the same breadth of explanation as inflation, and still require inflation for a more complete fit with observation; they should therefore be regarded as adjuncts to inflation, rather than as alternatives.
String theory requires that, in addition to the three observable spatial dimensions, there exist additional dimensions that are curled up or compactified (see also Kaluza–Klein theory). Extra dimensions appear as a frequent component of supergravity models and other approaches to quantum gravity. This raised the contingent question of why four space-time dimensions became large and the rest became unobservably small. An attempt to address this question, called string gas cosmology, was proposed by Robert Brandenberger and Cumrun Vafa.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0550-3213(89)90037-0 | title = Superstrings in the early universe | year = 1989 | last1 = Brandenberger | first1 = R | journal = Nuclear Physics B | volume = 316 | issue = 2 | pages = 391–410 | bibcode=1989NuPhB.316..391B | last2 = Vafa | first2 = C. [/tpl] This model focuses on the dynamics of the early universe considered as a hot gas of strings. Brandenberger and Vafa show that a dimension of spacetime can only expand if the strings that wind around it can efficiently annihilate each other. Each string is a one-dimensional object, and the largest number of dimensions in which two strings will generically intersect (and, presumably, annihilate) is three. Therefore, one argues that the most likely number of non-compact (large) spatial dimensions is three. Current work on this model centers on whether it can succeed in stabilizing the size of the compactified dimensions and produce the correct spectrum of primordial density perturbations. For a recent review, see[tpl]cite journal | first1=Thorsten |last1=Battefeld |first2= Scott |last2=Watson|title= String Gas Cosmology | journal = Reviews Modern Physics|volume=78|pages= 435–454 |year=2006|arxiv=hep-th/0510022|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.78.435|bibcode = 2006RvMP...78..435B | issue=2 [/tpl] The authors admits that their model "does not solve the entropy and flatness problems of standard cosmology ..... and we can provide no explanation for why the current universe is so close to being spatially flat".[tpl]cite journal | first=Robert H. |last=Brandenberger|title=String Gas Cosmology and Structure Formation|journal= International Journal of Modern Physics A|volume=22|pages=3621–3642|year=2007|arxiv=hep-th/0608121|doi=10.1142/S0217751X07037159|bibcode = 2007IJMPA..22.3621B | first2=ALI |last3=Patil| first3=Subodh P. |last4=Vafa| first4=Cumrun | issue=21 |last2=Nayeri[/tpl]
The ekpyrotic and cyclic models are also considered adjuncts to inflation. These models solve the horizon problem through an expanding epoch well before the Big Bang, and then generate the required spectrum of primordial density perturbations during a contracting phase leading to a Big Crunch. The universe passes through the Big Crunch and emerges in a hot Big Bang phase. In this sense they are reminiscent of the oscillatory universe proposed by Richard Chace Tolman: however in Tolman's model the total age of the universe is necessarily finite, while in these models this is not necessarily so. Whether the correct spectrum of density fluctuations can be produced, and whether the universe can successfully navigate the Big Bang/Big Crunch transition, remains a topic of controversy and current research. Ekpyrotic models avoid the magnetic monopole problem as long as the temperature at the Big Crunch/Big Bang transition remains below the Grand Unified Scale, as this is the temperature required to produce magnetic monopoles in the first place. As things stand, there is no evidence of any 'slowing down' of the expansion, but this is not surprising as each cycle is expected to last on the order of a trillion years.
Another adjunct, the varying speed of light model has also been theorized by Jean-Pierre Petit in 1988, John Moffat in 1992 as well Andreas Albrecht and João Magueijo in 1999, instead of superluminal expansion the speed of light was 60 orders of magnitude faster than its current value solving the horizon and homogeneity problems in the early universe.

==Criticisms==

Since its introduction by Alan Guth in 1980, the inflationary paradigm has become widely accepted. Nevertheless, many physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers of science have voiced criticisms, claiming untestable predictions and an alleged lack of serious empirical support. In 1999, John Earman and Jesús Mosterín published a thorough critical review of inflationary cosmology, concluding, "we do not think that there are, as yet, good grounds for admitting any of the models of inflation into the standard core of cosmology."[tpl]cite journal | last1=Earman|first1= John |first2=Jesús |last2=Mosterín |date=March 1999|title=A Critical Look at Inflationary Cosmology| journal= Philosophy of Science |volume=66 |pages= 1–49 |doi=10.2307/188736 |jstor=188736|doi_brokendate= 2014-03-25 [/tpl]
In order to work, and as pointed out by Roger Penrose from 1986 on, inflation requires extremely specific initial conditions of its own, so that the problem (or pseudo-problem) of initial conditions is not solved: "There is something fundamentally misconceived about trying to explain the uniformity of the early universe as resulting from a thermalization process. ... For, if the thermalization is actually doing anything ... then it represents a definite increasing of the entropy. Thus, the universe would have been even more special before the thermalization than after."Penrose, Roger (2004). The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe. London: Vintage Books, p. 755. See also [tpl]cite journal | last=Penrose|first= Roger |year=1989|title=Difficulties with Inflationary Cosmology| journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume= 271|pages= 249–264|bibcode=1989NYASA.571..249P |doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1989.tb50513.x [/tpl] The problem of specific or "fine-tuned" initial conditions would not have been solved; it would have gotten worse.
A recurrent criticism of inflation is that the invoked inflation field does not correspond to any known physical field, and that its potential energy curve seems to be an ad hoc contrivance to accommodate almost any data obtainable. Paul J. Steinhardt, one of the founding fathers of inflationary cosmology, has recently become one of its sharpest critics. He calls 'bad inflation' a period of accelerated expansion whose outcome conflicts with observations, and 'good inflation' one compatible with them: "Not only is bad inflation more likely than good inflation, but no inflation is more likely than either.... Roger Penrose considered all the possible configurations of the inflaton and gravitational fields. Some of these configurations lead to inflation ... Other configurations lead to a uniform, flat universe directly – without inflation. Obtaining a flat universe is unlikely overall. Penrose's shocking conclusion, though, was that obtaining a flat universe without inflation is much more likely than with inflation – by a factor of 10 to the googol (10 to the 100) power!"Steinhardt, Paul J. (2011). "The inflation debate: Is the theory at the heart of modern cosmology deeply flawed?" (Scientific American, April; pp. 18-25).[tpl]cite book|author1=Paul J.
