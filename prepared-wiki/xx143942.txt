Roger McGuinn was Roger McGuinn's first full-length solo album, released in 1973.

==History==

This album was released after The Byrds' 1973 reunion album, with all five founding members of the group participating in the sessions. McGuinn himself has stated that any outtakes from those sessions appeared here, but this was later proven to be false with the discovery of several alternate takes and at least one outtake in late 2009. In addition, the tracks contain several more references to McGuinn's history with the Byrds: the majority of the songs on the album were co-written with Jaques Levy, who McGuinn began collaborating while he was working on his country-rock musical Gene Tryp (which was abandoned and the resulting songs appeared on the Byrds' "(Untitled)" and "Byrdmaniax" albums. Two songs here, David Whiffen's "Lost My Drivin' Wheel" and "Bag Full Of Money" were originally recorded by the Clarence White-Era Byrds in the midst of 1972, but they were held back until the re-release of "Farther Along" in 2000. Finally, three other songs, "I'm So Restless", "Hanoi Hannah", and "The Water Is Wide" were performed by the Clarence White-era Byrds on at least a one-time basis, with the former two being performed at a concert in Brookville, New York in early 1971, and the latter being played at a later date in August of 1972. Jackson Browne's "Jamaica, Say You Will" had also been performed by the Byrds throughout 1971, though Clarence White performed the lead vocal and McGuinn sang the high harmony. McGuinn sings lead on the track here, though it was left off the original album and was included only as a bonus track on the 2004 reissue.
