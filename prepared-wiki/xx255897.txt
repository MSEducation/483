RAAF Wirraway A20-212 had been circling between Maroochydore and Alexandra Headland during a routine shark patrol when it suddenly banked steeply and crashed onto the crowded beach in front of the Maroochydore Surf Life Saving Club. The pilot and his observer survived the impact of the crash.

To date an information board which includes photos and stories from the day of the crash has been placed directly in front of the crash site. In mid-2011 a 2.4-metre 'Maroochy Air Crash Memorial' is planned to be displayed at the site by Aircrash Memorial Committee chairman Dennis Coffey to mark the 60th anniversary of the tragedy in memory of those killed and injured.
