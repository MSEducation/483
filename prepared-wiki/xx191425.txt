==History==

The exact number of prostitutes working in Iran is unknown. However, prostitutes are visible on some street corners of the major cities. Many of them are runaways from poor and broken homes, a huge number of them being Azeri, Indian, Afghan and Pakistani girls trafficked or refugees who came to Iran only to be turned into sex slaves.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/2137652 |title=Shorn of dignity and equality |publisher=The Economist |date=2003-10-16 |accessdate=2011-11-21[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title= Drugs and prostitution 'soar' in Iran|publisher= BBC|date=2000-07-06|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/822312.stm|accessdate=2011-01-12[/tpl] In 2002, the Iranian newspaper Entekhab estimated that there were close to 85,000 prostitutes in Tehran alone.[tpl]cite web|last=Lapidos |first=Juliet |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2189816/ |title=How to Spot a Persian Prostitute |publisher=Slate |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2011-11-21[/tpl] Police raids have also exposed child prostitution rings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iranfocus.com/en/?option=com_content&task=view&id=1840 |title=Iran in focus |publisher=Iran Focus |date=2005-04-11 |accessdate=2011-11-21[/tpl] 
An Iranian psychiatrist, Mahdis Kamkar, believes  the rise in prostitution is a symptom of broader social problems, among them "troubled families, divorce, identity crises and social contradictions."

Before the Islamic revolution in 1979, prostitutes were confined to separate neighborhoods such as Shahr-e-no in Tehran. The new religious government demolished the district and punished  prostitution with lashing.[tpl]cite web| last = Fath | first = Nazila | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/28/world/to-regulate-prostitution-iran-ponders-brothels.html |title=To Regulate Prostitution, Iran Ponders Brothels |publisher=New York Times |date=2002-08-28 |accessdate=2011-11-21[/tpl] Establishing brothels is also a criminal act, subject to 1–10 years imprisonment.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]

==U.S. assessment==

In 2007, the United States State Department placed Iran as a "Tier 2" in its annual Trafficking in Persons reports, stating that "it does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2004/33195.htm |title= Trafficking in Persons Report |date=2009-02-25 |work=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=20 December 2009[/tpl] In 2010, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton downgraded Iran to "Tier 3", noting that the country makes no significant effort to solve trafficking problems, mainly in relation to prostitution and forced labor.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142759.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2010 |author=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor |year=2010 |work= |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=6 January 2011[/tpl]

==Prostitution scandal==

In 2008, General Reza Zarei, the Tehran police chief, was arrested in a brothel with six prostitutes.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,550156,00.html |title=Prostitute Scandal Rattles Tehran Government |date=April 28, 2008 |work=Spiegel Online International |accessdate=January 6, 2011[/tpl] His arrest caused embarrassment for the government of President Ahmadinejad  because Zarei was in charge of vice in Tehran. The prosecutor in the case remarked that Zarei exploited his office to profit materially from prostitution.

==Nikah mut‘ah or Sigheh==

While prostitution is illegal in Iran, the Shiah institution of Nikah mut‘ah (temporary marriage, usually called Sigheh in Iran) allows contractual short-term relations between both sexes. Usually, a dowry is given to the temporary wife. Sigheh can last from 15 minutes to 99 years; it expires automatically without divorce. According to a number of scholars and Iranians, Sigheh is being misused as a legal cover for prostitution in Iran.Andreeva, Elena (2007). Russia and Iran in the great game: travelogues and Orientalism. Routledge studies in Middle Eastern history. 8. Psychology Press. pp. 162–163. ISBN 0415771536. "Most of the travelers describe the Shi'i institution of temporary marriage (sigheh) as 'legalized profligacy' and hardly distinguish between temporary marriage and prostitution."Haeri, Shahla (1989). Law of desire: temporary marriage in Shi'i Iran. Contemporary issues in the Middle East. Syracuse University Press. p. x. ISBN 0815624832. "Outside of the religious establishment and the ongoing disputes between Shi'i and Sunni scholars, the attitude toward temporary marriage has been primarily one of ambivalence and disdain. Before the revolution of 1979, the secular Iranian middle classes dismissed temporary marriage as a form of prostitution that had been legitimized by the religious establishment, who, to use a popular Persian expression, 'put a religious hat on it.'"
