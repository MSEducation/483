Jeremiah is a Belgian comic book series by Hermann Huppen. It was created in 1979 for the German magazine Zack and also appeared in Métal Hurlant, Spirou magazine, and Politikin Zabavnik. Currently, there are 32 volumes and one Hors Série in French and Dutch.

==Plot==

Racial wars have torn the USA apart, resulting in a post-apocalyptic world. Many small pockets of civilization exits; from isolated super high-tech fortresses, hidden research labs, or racial groups in walled-in cities, fighting each other, amongst the more regular population, which in many ways resembles the "old west". 
Jeremiah and his friend Kurdy travel the country, taking the odd job, and getting mixed up in various affairs. Jeremiah, being the more noble of the two, often sticks his neck out to help others, while Kurdy is a more wily, opportunistic scoundrel. The story carries little from album to album, meaning they can be read individually.

==Publication==

Jeremiah has been very successful, both critically and commercially in Europe, and has a large fan base. There have been attempts to introduce the series to the US market on several occasions without promising results, mostly due to different tastes of the American and European comic book public.
Jeremiah is published in several languages, but the current holder of the English language copyrights is Strip Art Features (SAF).
The series has reached a cult status in Europe. However it failed when it was introduced to the US in the early 1990s. [tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2007[/tpl] Strip Art Features attempted in collaboration with Dark Horse Comics to reestablish Jeremiah in the US in the early 2000s, with Jeremiah: Gun in the Water. In March 2012 Dark Horse Comics begun another English language reprint series in collaboration with SAF; three volumes of the Jeremiah Omnibus, collecting tomes 1 to 3, 4 to 6 and 7 to 9 respectively, have been released as of October 2013.
