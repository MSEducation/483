The Very Best Of Oleta Adams is a compilation album by the American vocalist, pianist and songwriter Oleta Adams and was released in 1996.

==History==

Released at the end of 1996 in Europe, this album served to finish Adams' contract with Mercury Records. It includes singles and album highlights of her albums Circle of One, Evolution and Moving On. Also included is Adams' very first single release, the duet with Tears for Fears "Woman in Chains", as well as her 1991 cover of "Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me" for the Two Rooms album, neither of which had been included on her albums.

==USA version==

This first edition of the compilation was never released in the USA. Instead, Mercury Records released a compilation with the same title two years later, in 1998, with a slightly different track listing. It included two rare 1994 non-album songs: the cover of "Embraceable You" recorded for a George Gershwin tribute album, and the cover of the song "Many Rivers to Cross", recorded for the soundtrack of the film Jason's Lyric.
