[[Proposed expansion of the New York City Subway]]

CATEGORIES: New York City Subway history, Proposed New York City Subway projects

Since the opening of the original New York City Subway line in 1904, various official and planning agencies have proposed numerous extensions to the subway system. One of the better known proposals was the "Second System," which was part of a plan by the Independent Subway to construct new subway lines in addition and take over existing subway lines and railroad right-of-ways. Though most of the routes proposed over the decades have never seen construction, discussion remains strong to develop some of these lines, to alleviate existing subway capacity constraints and overcrowding, the most notable being the Second Avenue Subway. 

==Triborough System==

This was a proclamation for new subway lines to the Bronx and Brooklyn. These lines are the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, IRT Pelham Line and IRT Jerome Avenue Line. The Manhattan Bridge line described below later became the BMT Fourth Avenue Line, the BMT West End Line, the BMT Sea Beach Line, and the Nassau Street loops.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nycsubway.org/wiki/A_New_Subway_Line_for_New_York_City,_The_Triborough_System:_Its_History_(1910) |title=A New Subway Line for New York City, The Triborough System: Its History (1910) |publisher=www.nycsubway.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/The_Dual_System_of_Rapid_Transit_(1912) |title=The Dual System of Rapid Transit (1912) |publisher=www.nycsubway.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl]
 The route of the new subway … comprises a main trunk north and south through Manhattan Borough on Lexington Avenue and Irving Place from the Harlem River to Tenth St. and on Broadway, Vesey and Church Sts. from Tenth St. to the Battery; two branches in Bronx Borough, one northeast via 138th St. Southern Boulevard and Westchester Ave. to Pelham Bay Park. the other northerly via River Ave. and Jerome Ave.. to Woodlawn Road, connecting with the Manhattan trunk by a tunnel under the Harlem River; a Manhattan-Brooklyn line extending from the North River via Canal Street across the East River on the Manhattan Bridge to connect with the Fourth Avenue subway in Brooklyn now being built, which thus becomes an integral part of the larger system; two branches southerly from the Fourth Ave. line extending south to Fort Hamilton and southeast to Coney Island; and a loop feeder line in Brooklyn through Lafayette Ave. and Broadway, connecting with the Fourth Ave. line at one end. and at the other crossing the Williamsburg Bridge and entering the Centre Street Loop subway in Manhattan which is thus also incorporated in the system. 
This was part of the Dual Contracts, signed on March 19, 1913 and also known as the Dual Subway System. These were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The contracts were "dual," in that they were signed between the City and the IRT and BMT.nycsubway.org—The Dual Contracts

==Mayor Hylan's plan==

On August 28, 1922, Mayor John Francis Hylan revealed his own plans for the subway system, which was relatively small at the time. His plan included taking over nearly 100 miles of existing lines and building over 100 miles of new lines. Construction of all these new lines would be completed by December 31, 1925, and passengers would be able to ride between the ends of New York City on one fare. The lines were designed to compete with the IRT and BMT.[tpl]cite news|title=Two Subway Routes Adopted by City|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70B10F7345416738DDDAD0894D0405B838EF1D3|work=New York Times|date=August 4, 1923|page=9[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Plans Now Ready to Start Subways|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60810F83E5D1A728DDDAB0994DB405B848EF1D3|work=New York Times|date=March 12, 1924|page=1[/tpl]
Hylan's plan contained the following lines:
None of these lines were actually completed, except for the 95th Street extension on the Fourth Avenue Line.
However, some of Hylan's planned lines were built to completion. Completed lines included:
A report, "Proposed Subway Plan for Subway Relief and Expansion" by Major Philip Mathews, published on December 24, 1926, did not agree with the Board of Transportation's basic plan. He cited these reasons:
Instead, Mathews proposed these other lines:

==Subways to New Jersey==

In 1926, a loop subway service was planned to be built to New Jersey.nycsubway.org—Extensive Rapid Transit Plan Proposed for North Jersey (1926-1927)
 Principal features of a comprehensive plan for passenger transportation between communities in the nine northern counties of New Jersey and the city of New York are outlined in a report submitted on Jan. 15 to the Legislature of the state by the North Jersey Transit Commission. A preliminary report presented about a year ago was abstracted in Electric Railway Journal for Feb. 7, 1925... The ultimate object of the program recommended is the creation of a new electric railway system comprising 82.6 miles of route, and the electrification of 399 route-miles of railroad now operated by steam. As the first step it is proposed to construct an interstate loop line 17.3 miles in length connecting with all of the north Jersey commuters' railroads and passing under the Hudson River into New York City by two tunnels, one uptown and one downtown. A new low-level subway through Manhattan would complete the loop. Construction costs of this preliminary project are estimated at $154,000,000, with $40,000,000 additional for equipment. The cost of power facilities is not included in this estimate. 
Because it would be utilized in both directions, the capacity of the proposed interstate loop line would be equivalent, it is said, to two 2-track lines or one 4-track line from New Jersey to New York City due to its having two crossings between New Jersey and New York. The loop was said to be able to carry 192,500 passengers per hour, or 4.62 million daily passengers, had it been built. The estimate was based on the operation of 35 trains per hour in each direction, and each train would be eleven cars long and would carry 100 passengers per car. It was to be built as a multi-phase project, wherein the IRT and BMT would work together to build that system to New Jersey. Extensions of the IRT Flushing Line and BMT Canarsie Line were both considered; the Canarsie Line was to be extended to Hoboken near the Palisades, while the Flushing Line was to be extended to Franklin Street between Boulevard and Bergenline Avenues in Union City. Ultimately, the cost was too great, and with the Great Depression, these ideas were quickly shot down.
On November 16, 2010, the plan was revisited again, as The New York Times reported that Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration had been working on a plan to extend the 7 service across the Hudson River to Hoboken and continue to Secaucus Junction in New Jersey, where it would connect with most New Jersey Transit commuter lines. It would offer New Jersey commuters a direct route to Grand Central Terminal on the East Side of Manhattan and connections to most other New York City subway routes. This was being planned as an extension of the already-under construction 7 Subway Extension (see below).[tpl]Cite news|title=Take the No. 7 to Secaucus? |first=Bagli |last=Charles V. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/nyregion/17tunnel.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 17, 2010 |accessdate=July 3, 2013[/tpl] In April 2012, citing budget considerations, the director of the MTA, Joe Lhota, said that it was doubtful the extension would be built in the foreseeable future, suggesting that the Gateway Project was a much more likely solution to congestion at Hudson River crossings.[tpl]Cite news   | last = Haughney   | first = Christine   | title = MTA Chief rules out subway line to New Jersey   | newspaper = The New York Times   | date = April 3, 2012   | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/04/nyregion/transit-agency-chief-rules-out-new-york-new-jersey-subway.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=7%20subway%20extension&st=cse   | accessdate = April 4, 2012   | quote =   | postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl] However, a feasibility study commissioned by the city and released in April 2013 revived hope for the project, with Mayor Bloomberg saying "Extending the 7 train to Secaucus is a promising potential solution ... and is deserving of serious consideration."Plan to extend No. 7 subway from NYC to New Jersey could be back on track, Mike Frassinelli, The Star-Ledger, April 10, 2013[tpl]cite report   | author= Parsons Brinkerhoff   | title = No 7 Secaucus Extension Feasibility Analysis Final Report | publisher = NYCEDC   | date = April 2013   | url = http://www.nycedc.com/sites/default/files/filemanager/Resources/Studies/No_7_Secaucus_Extension_Final_Report_April_2013.pdf   | format = PDF   | accessdate = April 10, 2013 | page = III–X [/tpl]

==1929–1939 plans[tpl]anchor|IND Second System[/tpl]==

Before unification in 1940, the City of New York made plans for expanding the subway system. The first one, conceived in 1929, was to be part of the city-operated Independent Subway System (IND). By 1939, with unification planned, all three systems were included. Very few of these far-reaching lines were built, though provisions were made for future expansion on lines that intersect the proposals. The core Manhattan lines of the expansion were the Second Avenue Line (with an extension into the Bronx) and the Worth Street Line (connecting to the Rockaways). The Rockaways were eventually served by the subway via a city takeover of the Long Island Rail Road's Rockaway Beach Branch. The Second Avenue Subway is under construction as of 2014 and scheduled for passenger service in late 2016. It is notable that the majority of the proposed lines were to be built as elevated subways, likely a cost-cutting measure. The majority of the expansion was to occur in Queens, with the original proposal suggesting 52 miles of track be built in Queens alone. As this grandiose expansion was not built, the subway system is only [tpl]frac|3|4[/tpl] of what it was planned to be.

===Details===

The first plan was made on September 15, 1929 (before the IND even opened), and is detailed in the table below.nycsubway.org—IND Second System – 1929 Plan Cost is only for construction, and doesn't include land acquisition or other items.

===Planned services===

===Other plans during the same time===

Other plans, proposed during the same time as the IND Second System plans, included the following:
An earlier plan in 1920 had an even more expansive plan, with several dozen subway lines going across all five boroughs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://transitmaps.tumblr.com/post/47218108024/ny-subway-expansion-1920 |title=Transit Maps |publisher=Transitmaps.tumblr.com |date=2013-04-05 |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl]

===Provisions for new lines===

The following provisions were made for connections and transfers to the new lines. It is of note that only four of these provisions were completed.

===Shells built===

The South Fourth Street shell, if complete, was supposed to handle service as follows:
Note: The locals would have short-turned here. There would have been two tunnels under the East River: East Houston Street and Grand Street.
|}
Another plan for the South Fourth Street shell was simpler:
Note: The Flushing Avenue local would have diverged off to the IND Crosstown Line. There would have been three tunnels under the East River: East Houston Street, Stanton Street, and Grand Street.
|}
The Utica Avenue station shell, if complete, would be in the standard local-express-express-local platform configuration.
The Jackson Heights – Roosevelt Avenue shell, a two-trackbed island-platformed station, would have been for local trains terminating at the station. Express trains would have stopped at the lower level (IND Queens Boulevard Line) platforms.

==1940–1999 plans==

===1940===

In 1938 and 1940, the Board of Transportation put forth revised plans for additional lines.
The IND Concourse Line got funding to be extended beyond its current 205th Street terminal, but Bronx residents wanted to rehabilitate the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway right-of way. This became the IRT Dyre Avenue Line in December 1941, and the IND Concourse Line extension was not brought up again until 1968.

===1951===

In 1951, a plan was put forth to the New York Board of Transportation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thejoekorner.com/bdtrans-51/bd-trans-51-plan-indx.html |title=Board of Transportation - 1951 |publisher=Thejoekorner.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-25[/tpl] Many things were planned:

====Proposed lines====

Similar plans were made by the New York City Transit Authority in 1968.[tpl]cite web|url=http://secondavenuesagas.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/1968expansionlarge.jpg|title=1968 NYCTA Expansion Plans (Picture)|publisher=Second Avenue Sagas|accessdate=December 2013[/tpl]Program for Action maps from thejoekorner.com They included:

====Completed lines====

The Archer Avenue Lines are two lines, split among the BMT and IND, mostly running under Archer Avenue in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens. Conceived as part of these 1968 expansion plans, they opened on December 11, 1988.[ref]
