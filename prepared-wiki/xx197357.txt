Wednesbury Rugby Club  is a rugby union club based in Wednesbury, West Midlands, UK, just off the M6 motorway J9.  It was founded in 1921 and is the home of the world's tallest rugby posts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wednesbury-rufc.co.uk/|title=THE TALLEST RUGBY POSTS ON THE PLANET|work=www.wednesbury-rufc.co.uk|accessdate=2008-05-21[/tpl]
Fabricated from steel tube by Irvon steel and galvanized by Joseph Ash, Wednesbury Rugby Club's world record breaking posts are 38.26m high above the ground, and needed a special crane brought in to help erect them. 
The Wednesbury posts surpass the previous tallest of 110 ft and 1/2in (33.54m) that can be found at the Roan Antelope club in Zambia, Africa.
The minimum required height of rugby posts under Law 1.4 (c) is just 11.2 ft (3.4m) - technically a mere 1.3 ft (40cms) higher than the cross-bar.
