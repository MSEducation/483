An extinction event (also known as a mass extinction or biotic crisis) is a widespread and rapid decrease in the amount of life on earth. Such an event is identified by a sharp change in the diversity and abundance of macroscopic life. It occurs when the rate of extinction increases with respect to the rate of speciation. Because the majority of diversity and biomass on Earth is microbial, and thus difficult to measure, recorded extinction events affect the easily observed, biologically complex component of the biosphere rather than the total diversity and abundance of life.[tpl]cite doi|10.1371/journal.pbio.0020272[/tpl]
Over 98% of documented species are now extinct,[tpl]cite book|last=Fichter|first=George S.|title=Endangered animals|year=1995|publisher=Golden Books Publishing Company|location=USA|isbn=1-58238-138-0|pages=5[/tpl] but extinction occurs at an uneven rate. Based on the fossil record, the background rate of extinctions on Earth is about two to five taxonomic families of marine invertebrates and vertebrates every million years.
Marine fossils are mostly used to measure extinction rates because of their superior fossil record and stratigraphic range compared to land organisms.
Since life began on Earth, several major mass extinctions have significantly exceeded the background extinction rate. The most recent, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which occurred approximately [tpl]period start|Paleogene[/tpl] million years ago (Ma), was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time. In the past 540 million years there have been five major events when over 50% of animal species died.  Mass extinctions seem to be a Phanerozoic phenomenon, with extinction rates low before large complex organisms arose.[tpl]cite doi|10.1111/j.1475-4983.2006.00613.x[/tpl]
Estimates of the number of major mass extinctions in the last 540 million years range from as few as five to more than twenty. These differences stem from the threshold chosen for describing an extinction event as "major", and the data chosen to measure past diversity.

==Major extinction events==

In a landmark paper published in 1982, Jack Sepkoski and David M. Raup identified five mass extinctions. They were originally identified as outliers to a general trend of decreasing extinction rates during the Phanerozoic, but as more stringent statistical tests have been applied to the accumulating data, the "Big Five" cannot be so clearly defined, but rather appear to represent the largest (or some of the largest) of a relatively smooth continuum of extinction events.  
[/ref] The evidence of plants is less clear, but new taxa became dominant after the extinction. The "Great Dying" had enormous evolutionary significance: on land, it ended the primacy of mammal-like reptiles. The recovery of vertebrates took 30 million years,[tpl]cite journal| author=Sahney S & Benton MJ| year=2008| title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time| journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biological| volume=275|issue=1636|pages=759–65|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 |pmid=18198148| pmc=2596898[/tpl] but the vacant niches created the opportunity for archosaurs to become ascendant. In the seas, the percentage of animals that were sessile dropped from 67% to 50%. The whole late Permian was a difficult time for at least marine life, even before the "Great Dying".
Despite the popularization of these five events, there is no fine line separating them from other extinction events; indeed, using different methods of calculating an extinction's impact can lead to other events featuring in the top five.[tpl]cite doi|10.1130/G32679.1[/tpl]
The older the fossil record gets, the more difficult it is to read. This is because:
It has been suggested that the apparent variations in marine biodiversity may actually be an artifact, with abundance estimates directly related to quantity of rock available for sampling from different time periods.[tpl]cite journal| first=A.| last= Smith|author2=A. McGowan| year= 2005| title=Cyclicity in the fossil record mirrors rock outcrop area| journal=Biology Letters| volume= 1| issue= 4| pages=443–445| doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0345| pmid=17148228| pmc=1626379[/tpl] However, statistical analysis shows that this can only account for 50% of the observed pattern,[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2007[/tpl] and other evidence (such as fungal spikes)[tpl]Clarify|date=March 2008[/tpl] provides reassurance that most widely accepted extinction events are indeed real. A quantification of the rock exposure of Western Europe does indicate that many of the minor events for which a biological explanation has been sought are most readily explained by sampling bias.

==Evolutionary importance==

Mass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the evolution of life on Earth. When dominance of particular ecological niches passes from one group of organisms to another, it is rarely because the new dominant group is "superior" to the old and usually because an extinction event eliminates the old dominant group and makes way for the new one.[tpl]cite book | last=Benton | first =M.J. | title=Vertebrate Palaeontology | publisher=Blackwell | year=2004 | chapter=6. Reptiles Of The Triassic | url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/book.asp?ref=0632056371 | isbn=0-04-566002-6[/tpl][tpl]cite journal| last=Van Valkenburgh | first= B.| year=1999 | title=Major patterns in the history of carnivorous mammals | journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences| volume= 27| pages= 463–493 | doi= 10.1146/annurev.earth.27.1.463|bibcode = 1999AREPS..27..463V [/tpl]
For example mammaliformes ("almost mammals") and then mammals existed throughout the reign of the dinosaurs, but could not compete for the large terrestrial vertebrate niches which dinosaurs monopolized. The end-Cretaceous mass extinction removed the non-avian dinosaurs and made it possible for mammals to expand into the large terrestrial vertebrate niches. Ironically, the dinosaurs themselves had been beneficiaries of a previous mass extinction, the end-Triassic, which eliminated most of their chief rivals, the crurotarsans.
Another point of view put forward in the Escalation hypothesis predicts that species in ecological niches with more organism-to-organism conflict will be less likely to survive extinctions. This is because the very traits that keep a species numerous and viable under fairly static conditions become a burden once population levels fall among competing organisms during the dynamics of an extinction event.
Furthermore, many groups which survive mass extinctions do not recover in numbers or diversity, and many of these go into long-term decline, and these are often referred to as "Dead Clades Walking".[tpl]cite journal| last=Jablonski| first= D.| year=2002| doi= 10.1073/pnas.102163299| title=Survival without recovery after mass extinctions| journal=PNAS| volume= 99| issue=12| pages= 8139–8144| pmid=12060760| pmc=123034|bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.8139J [/tpl]
So analysing extinctions in terms of "what died and what survived" often fails to tell the full story.
Darwin was firmly of the opinion that biotic interactions, such as competition for food and space—the ‘struggle for existence’—were of considerably greater importance in promoting evolution and extinction than changes in the physical environment. He expressed this in The origin of species: “Species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting causes…and the most import of all causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered…physical conditions, namely the mutual relation of organism to organism-the improvement of one organism entailing the improvement or extermination of others”.Hallam, A., & Wignall, P. B. (2002). Mass Extinctions and Their Aftermath. New York: Oxford University Press Inc.

==Patterns in frequency==

It has been suggested variously that extinction events occurred periodically, every 26 to 30 million years,[tpl]cite pmid |6583680 [/tpl] or that diversity fluctuates episodically every ~62 million years.Different cycle lengths have been proposed; e.g. by [tpl]cite pmid| 15758998[/tpl]
Various ideas attempt to explain the supposed pattern, including the presence of a hypothetical companion star to the sun, 
 
oscillations in the galactic plane, or passage through the Milky Way's spiral arms.">[tpl]cite doi|10.1017/S1473550408004047[/tpl][/ref] However, other authors have concluded the data on marine mass extinctions do not fit with the idea that mass extinctions are periodic, or that ecosystems gradually build up to a point at which a mass extinction is inevitable.[tpl]cite doi|10.1073/pnas.0802597105[/tpl] Many of the proposed correlations have been argued to be spurious.[tpl]cite doi|10.1017/S147355040999005X[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1088/0004-637X/705/2/L101[/tpl]
Others have argued that there is strong evidence supporting periodicity in a variety of records,

and additional evidence in the form of coincident periodic variation in nonbiological geochemical variables.

Mass extinctions are thought to result when a long-term stress is compounded by a short term shock.[tpl]cite doi |10.1666/07034.1 [/tpl] Over the course of the Phanerozoic, individual taxa appear to be less likely to become extinct at any time,[tpl]cite doi | 10.1666/07060.1[/tpl] which may reflect more robust food webs as well as less extinction-prone species and other factors such as continental distribution.
However, even after accounting for sampling bias, there does appear to be a gradual decrease in extinction and origination rates during the Phanerozoic. This may represent the fact that groups with higher turnover rates are more likely to become extinct by chance; or it may be an artefact of taxonomy: families tend to become more speciose, therefore less prone to extinction, over time; and larger taxonomic groups (by definition) appear earlier in geological time.[tpl]cite doi|10.1093/icb/43.1.157[/tpl]
It has also been suggested that the oceans have gradually become more hospitable to life over the last 500 million years, and thus less vulnerable to mass extinctions,Dissolved oxygen became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of eutrophication and anoxic events; and marine ecosystems became more diversified so that food chains were less likely to be disrupted.[tpl]cite journal| last=Martin| first= R.E.| year=1995| title=Cyclic and secular variation in microfossil biomineralization: clues to the biogeochemical evolution of Phanerozoic oceans| journal=Global and Planetary Change| volume =11| issue= 1| doi=10.1016/0921-8181(94)00011-2| page=1|bibcode = 1995GPC....11....1M [/tpl][tpl]cite jstor|3515230[/tpl] but susceptibility to extinction at a taxonomic level does not appear to make mass extinctions more or less probable.

==Causes==

There is still debate about the causes of all mass extinctions. In general, large extinctions may result when a biosphere under long-term stress undergoes a short-term shock. An underlying mechanism appears to be present in the correlation of extinction and origination rates to diversity. High diversity leads to a persistent increase in extinction rate; low diversity to a persistent increase in origination rate. These presumably ecologically controlled relationships likely amplify smaller perturbations (asteroid impacts, etc.) to produce the global effects observed.

===Identifying causes of particular mass extinctions===

A good theory for a particular mass extinction should: (i) explain all of the losses, not just focus on a few groups (such as dinosaurs); (ii) explain why particular groups of organisms died out and why others survived; (iii) provide mechanisms which are strong enough to cause a mass extinction but not a total extinction; (iv) be based on events or processes that can be shown to have happened, not just inferred from the extinction.
It may be necessary to consider combinations of causes. For example the marine aspect of the end-Cretaceous extinction appears to have been caused by several processes which partially overlapped in time and may have had different levels of significance in different parts of the world.[tpl]cite journal | last=Marshall | first=C.R. | last2=Ward | first2=P.D. | title=Sudden and Gradual Molluscan Extinctions in the Latest Cretaceous of Western European Tethys | journal=Science | volume=274 | pages=1360–1363 | year=1996 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/274/5291/1360?ijkey=ea611116afd7f95233c7b9b1451b6f16702ed11e | doi = 10.1126/science.274.5291.1360 | pmid=8910273 | issue=5291|bibcode = 1996Sci...274.1360M [/tpl]
Arens and West (2006) proposed a "press / pulse" model in which mass extinctions generally require two types of cause: long-term pressure on the eco-system ("press") and a sudden catastrophe ("pulse") towards the end of the period of pressure.Arens, N.C. and West, I.D. (2006). "Press/Pulse: A General Theory of Mass Extinction?"" 'GSA Conference paper' Abstract
Their statistical analysis of marine extinction rates throughout the Phanerozoic suggested that neither long-term pressure alone nor a catastrophe alone was sufficient to cause a significant increase in the extinction rate.

The most commonly suggested causes of mass extinctions are listed below.

====Flood basalt events====

The formation of large igneous provinces by flood basalt events could have:
Flood basalt events occur as pulses of activity punctuated by dormant periods. As a result they are likely to cause the climate to oscillate between cooling and warming, but with an overall trend towards warming as the carbon dioxide they emit can stay in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.
It is speculated that massive volcanism caused or contributed to the End-Permian, End-Triassic and End-Cretaceous extinctions.Speculated Causes of the End-Cretaceous Extinction The correlation between gigantic volcanic events expressed in the large igneous provinces and mass extinctions was shown for the last 260 Myr. Courtillot, V., 1994. Mass extinctions in the last 300 million years: one impact and seven flood basalts? Israel Journal of Earth Sciences 43, 255–266.  Courtillot, V.E., Renne, P.R., 2003. On the ages of flood basalt events. Comptes Rendus Geosciences 335 (1), 113–140. Recently such possible correlation was extended for the whole Phanerozoic Eon.Kravchinsky, V. A. (2012). Paleozoic large igneous provinces of Northern Eurasia: Correlation with mass extinction events. Global and Planetary Change, 86, 31-36.

====Sea-level falls====

These are often clearly marked by worldwide sequences of contemporaneous sediments which show all or part of a transition from sea-bed to tidal zone to beach to dry land – and where there is no evidence that the rocks in the relevant areas were raised by geological processes such as orogeny. Sea-level falls could reduce the continental shelf area (the most productive part of the oceans) sufficiently to cause a marine mass extinction, and could disrupt weather patterns enough to cause extinctions on land. But sea-level falls are very probably the result of other events, such as sustained global cooling or the sinking of the mid-ocean ridges.
Sea-level falls are associated with most of the mass extinctions, including all of the "Big Five"—End-Ordovician, Late Devonian, End-Permian, End-Triassic, and End-Cretaceous.
A study, published in the journal Nature (online June 15, 2008) established a relationship between the speed of mass extinction events and changes in sea level and sediment. The study suggests changes in ocean environments related to sea level exert a driving influence on rates of extinction, and generally determine the composition of life in the oceans.Newswise: Ebb and Flow of the Sea Drives World's Big Extinction Events Retrieved on June 15, 2008.

====Impact events====

The impact of a sufficiently large asteroid or comet could have caused food chains to collapse both on land and at sea by producing dust and particulate aerosols and thus inhibiting photosynthesis. Impacts on sulfur-rich rocks could have emitted sulfur oxides precipitating as poisonous acid rain, contributing further to the collapse of food chains. Such impacts could also have caused megatsunamis and / or global forest fires.
Most paleontologists now agree that an asteroid did hit the Earth about 66 Ma, but there is an ongoing dispute whether the impact was the sole cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.[tpl]cite journal |title=Analyses of shocked quartz at the global K-P boundary indicate an origin from a single, high-angle, oblique impact at Chicxulub |author=Morgan J, Lana C, Kersley A, Coles B, Belcher C, Montanari S, Diaz-Martinez E, Barbosa A, Neumann V |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=251 |issue=3–4 |year=2006 |pages=264–279 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2006.09.009 |bibcode=2006E&PSL.251..264M[/tpl] There is evidence that there was an interval of about 300 ka from the impact to the mass extinction.[tpl]cite journal| author=Keller G, Abramovich S, Berner Z, Adatte T| journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology| volume=271| issue=1–2| date=1 January 2009| pages=52–68| title=Biotic effects of the Chicxulub impact, K–T catastrophe and sea level change in Texas| doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.09.007[/tpl] In 1997, paleontologist Sankar Chatterjee drew attention to the proposed and much larger 600 km (370 mi) Shiva crater and the possibility of a multiple-impact scenario.
In 2007, a hypothesis was put forth that argued the impactor that killed the dinosaurs 66 Ma years ago belonged to the Baptistina family of asteroids.Bottke W., Vokrouhlický D., Nesvorný D. (2007) An asteroid breakup 160 Myr ago as the probable source of the K/T impactor. Nature 449, 48–53 Concerns have been raised regarding the reputed link, in part because very few solid observational constraints exist of the asteroid or family.Majaess D., Higgins D., Molnar L., Haegert M., Lane D., Turner D., Nielsen I. (2008). New Constraints on the Asteroid 298 Baptistina, the Alleged Family Member of the K/T Impactor, accepted for publication in the JRASC Indeed, it was discovered that 298 Baptistina does not share the same chemical signature as the source of the K–Pg (Chicxulub) impact.Reddy V., et al. (2008). Composition of 298 Baptistina: Implications for K-T Impactor Link, Asteroids, Comets, Meteors conference. Although this finding may make the link between the Baptistina family and K-T impactor more difficult to substantiate, it does not preclude the possibility.
In 2010, another hypothesis was offered which implicated the newly discovered asteroid P/2010 A2, a member of the Flora family of asteroids, as a possible remnant cohort of the K–Pg (Chicxulub) impact.Smashed asteroids may be related to dinosaur killer, Yahoo! News, Feb. 2, 2010
The Shiva hypothesis proposes that periodic gravitational disturbances cause comets from the Oort cloud to bombard earth every 26 to 30 million years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/ccc/cc020298.html|accessdate=2011-01-01|title=Cambridge Conference Correspondence[/tpl]

====Ocean asteroid impacts====

Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is soluble in sea water and is present in very large quantities. It mostly reports as the bicarbonate radical   (−HCO3) which is only stable at temperatures below 50°C.P.J. Durrant, 2nd Edition 1952, General and Inorganic Chemistry, pp355
Sea surface temperatures are normally below 50°C, but can easily exceed that temperature when an asteroid strikes the ocean thereby inducing a large thermal shock. Under those circumstances very large quantities of CO2 erupt from the ocean."ATMOSPHERIC CARBON DIOXIDE AND MARINE INTERACTION December 2007 As  a heavy gas, the CO2 can quickly spread around the world in concentrations sufficient to suffocate air breathing fauna, selectively at low altitudes.
Asteroid impacts with the ocean may not leave obvious signs, but these impacts have the potential to be far more devastating to life on earth than impacts with land.

====Sustained and significant global cooling====

Sustained global cooling could kill many polar and temperate species and force others to migrate towards the equator; reduce the area available for tropical species; often make the Earth's climate more arid on average, mainly by locking up more of the planet's water in ice and snow. The glaciation cycles of the current ice age are believed to have had only a very mild impact on biodiversity, so the mere existence of a significant cooling is not sufficient on its own to explain a mass extinction.
It has been suggested that global cooling caused or contributed to the End-Ordovician, Permian-Triassic, Late Devonian extinctions, and possibly others. Sustained global cooling is distinguished from the temporary climatic effects of flood basalt events or impacts.

====Sustained and significant global warming====

This would have the opposite effects: expand the area available for tropical species; kill temperate species or force them to migrate towards the poles; possibly cause severe extinctions of polar species; often make the Earth's climate wetter on average, mainly by melting ice and snow and thus increasing the volume of the water cycle. It might also cause anoxic events in the oceans (see below).
Global warming as a cause of mass extinction is supported by several recent studies.[tpl]cite journal|last=Mayhew|first=Peter J. |author2=Gareth B. Jenkins|author3=Timothy G. Benton|date=January 7, 2008|title=A long-term association between global temperature and biodiversity, origination and extinction in the fossil record|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=275|issue=1630|pages=47–53|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1630/47.full|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1302|pmid=17956842|pmc=2562410[/tpl]
The most dramatic example of sustained warming is the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, which was associated with one of the smaller mass extinctions. It has also been suggested to have caused the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event, during which 20% of all marine families went extinct. Furthermore, the Permian–Triassic extinction event has been suggested to have been caused by warming.[tpl]cite journal|last=Knoll|first=A.

====Clathrate gun hypothesis====

Clathrates are composites in which a lattice of one substance forms a cage around another. Methane clathrates (in which water molecules are the cage) form on continental shelves. These clathrates are likely to break up rapidly and release the methane if the temperature rises quickly or the pressure on them drops quickly—for example in response to sudden global warming or a sudden drop in sea level or even earthquakes. Methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, so a methane eruption ("clathrate gun") could cause rapid global warming or make it much more severe if the eruption was itself caused by global warming.
The most likely signature of such a methane eruption would be a sudden decrease in the ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 in sediments, since methane clathrates are low in carbon-13; but the change would have to be very large, as other events can also reduce the percentage of carbon-13.[tpl]cite web | last=Hecht | first=J | title=Methane prime suspect for greatest mass extinction | publisher=New Scientist | date=2002-03-26 | url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn2088[/tpl]
It has been suggested that "clathrate gun" methane eruptions were involved in the end-Permian extinction ("the Great Dying") and in the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, which was associated with one of the smaller mass extinctions.

====Anoxic events====

Anoxic events are situations in which the middle and even the upper layers of the ocean become deficient or totally lacking in oxygen. Their causes are complex and controversial, but all known instances are associated with severe and sustained global warming, mostly caused by sustained massive volcanism.
It has been suggested that anoxic events caused or contributed to the Ordovician–Silurian, late Devonian, Permian–Triassic and Triassic–Jurassic extinctions, as well as a number of lesser extinctions (such as the Ireviken, Mulde, Lau, Toarcian and Cenomanian–Turonian events). On the other hand, there are widespread black shale beds from the mid-Cretaceous which indicate anoxic events but are not associated with mass extinctions.

====Hydrogen sulfide emissions from the seas====

Kump, Pavlov and Arthur (2005) have proposed that during the Permian–Triassic extinction event the warming also upset the oceanic balance between photosynthesising plankton and deep-water sulfate-reducing bacteria, causing massive emissions of hydrogen sulfide which poisoned life on both land and sea and severely weakened the ozone layer, exposing much of the life that still remained to fatal levels of UV radiation.Berner, R.A., and Ward, P.D. (2004). "Positive Reinforcement, H2S, and the Permo-Triassic Extinction: Comment and Reply" describes possible positive feedback loops in the catastrophic release of hydrogen sulfide proposed by Kump, Pavlov and Arthur (2005).Kump, L.R., Pavlov, A., and Arthur, M.A. (2005).

"Impact from the Deep". Scientific American October 2006.

====Oceanic overturn====

Oceanic overturn is a disruption of thermo-haline circulation which lets surface water (which is more saline than deep water because of evaporation) sink straight down, bringing anoxic deep water to the surface and therefore killing most of the oxygen-breathing organisms which inhabit the surface and middle depths. It may occur either at the beginning or the end of a glaciation, although an overturn at the start of a glaciation is more dangerous because the preceding warm period will have created a larger volume of anoxic water.[tpl]Cite journal | last=Wilde | first=P | last2=Berry | first2=W.B.N. | title=Destabilization of the oceanic density structure and its significance to marine "extinction" events | journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume=48 | issue=2–4 | pages=143–162 | year=1984 | url=http://www.marscigrp.org/ppp84.html | doi=10.1016/0031-0182(84)90041-5 | postscript=[/tpl]
Unlike other oceanic catastrophes such as regressions (sea-level falls) and anoxic events, overturns do not leave easily identified "signatures" in rocks and are theoretical consequences of researchers' conclusions about other climatic and marine events.
It has been suggested that oceanic overturn caused or contributed to the late Devonian and Permian–Triassic extinctions.

====A nearby nova, supernova or gamma ray burst====

A nearby gamma ray burst (less than 6000 light years away) would be powerful enough to destroy the Earth's ozone layer, leaving organisms vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation from the sun.[tpl]cite web| title=20 Ways the World Could End| publisher=Discover Magazine| author=Corey S.

It has been suggested that a supernova or gamma ray burst caused the End-Ordovician extinction.

====Plate tectonics====

Movement of the continents into some configurations can cause or contribute to extinctions in several ways: by initiating or ending ice ages; by changing ocean and wind currents and thus altering climate; by opening seaways or land bridges which expose previously isolated species to competition for which they are poorly adapted (for example, the extinction of most of South America's native ungulates and all of its large metatherians after the creation of a land bridge between North and South America). Occasionally continental drift creates a super-continent which includes the vast majority of Earth's land area, which in addition to the effects listed above is likely to reduce the total area of continental shelf (the most species-rich part of the ocean) and produce a vast, arid continental interior which may have extreme seasonal variations.
Another theory is that the creation of the super-continent Pangaea contributed to the End-Permian mass extinction. Pangaea was almost fully formed at the transition from mid-Permian to late-Permian, and the "Marine genus diversity" diagram at the top of this article shows a level of extinction starting at that time which might have qualified for inclusion in the "Big Five" if it were not overshadowed by the "Great Dying" at the end of the Permian.[tpl]cite web |title=Speculated Causes of the Permian Extinction |publisher=Hooper Virtual Paleontological Museum |url=http://park.org/Canada/Museum/extinction/permcause.html |accessdate=16 July 2012[/tpl]

====Other hypotheses====

Many other hypotheses have been proposed, such as the spread of a new disease, or simple out-competition following an especially successful biological innovation. But all have been rejected, usually for one of the following reasons: they require events or processes for which there is no evidence; they assume mechanisms which are contrary to the available evidence; they are based on other theories which have been rejected or superseded.
Supervolcanic events may also been potential causes of mass extinctions. While none of the extinction events in Earth's past have been caused by any supervolcanic eruptions, the Toba supereruption may have reduced the first humans down to a few thousand individuals.
Scientists have been concerned that human activities could cause more plants and animals to become extinct than any point in the past. Along with man-made changes in climate (see above), some of these extinctions could be caused by overhunting, overfishing, invasive species, or habitat loss.
The eventual warming and expanding of the Sun, combined with the eventual decline of atmospheric carbon dioxide could actually cause an even greater mass extinction, having the potential to wipe out even microbes, where rising global temperatures caused by the expanding Sun will gradually increase the rate of weathering, which in turn removes more and more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When carbon dioxide levels get too low (perhaps at 50 ppm), all plant life will die out, although simpler plants like grasses and mosses can survive much longer, until CO2 levels drop to 10 ppm.[tpl]Citation Needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] With all plants gone, atmospheric oxygen can no longer be replenished (except by algae), and is eventually removed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere, perhaps from volcanic eruptions. Eventually the loss of oxygen will cause all remaining multicellular life to die out via asphyxiation, leaving behind only microbes. When the Sun becomes 10% brighter,[tpl]Citation Needed|date=November 2013[/tpl] microbes too will die out. This is the most extreme instance of a climate-caused extinction event. Since this will only happen late in the Sun's life, such will cause the final mass extinction in Earth's history.

==Effects and recovery==

The impact of mass extinction events varied widely. After a major extinction event, usually only weedy species survive due to their ability to live in diverse habitats.[tpl]Cite web |title=Planet of Weeds |author=David Quammen |work=Harper's Magazine |date=October 1998 |url= http://sep.csumb.edu/class/ESSP645/readings/Quammen%201998.pdf |accessdate=November 15, 2012 |postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] Later, species diversify and occupy empty niches. Generally, biodiversity recovers 5 to 10 million years after the extinction event. In the most severe mass extinctions it may take 15 to 30 million years.
The worst event, the Permian–Triassic extinction event, devastated life on earth and is estimated to have killed off over 90% of species. Life seemed to recover quickly after the P-T extinction, but this was mostly in the form of disaster taxa, such as the hardy Lystrosaurus. The most recent research indicates that the specialized animals that formed complex ecosystems, with high biodiversity, complex food webs and a variety of niches, took much longer to recover. It is thought that this long recovery was due to the successive waves of extinction which inhibited recovery, as well as to prolonged environmental stress to organisms which continued into the Early Triassic. Recent research indicates that recovery did not begin until the start of the mid-Triassic, 4M to 6M years after the extinction;[tpl]cite journal | title=Timing of recovery from the end-Permian extinction: Geochronologic and biostratigraphic constraints from south China | author=Lehrmann | journal=Geology |date=December 2006 | volume=34 | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/34/12/1053 | pages=1053–1056 | doi=10.1130/G22827A.1 | issue=12 |bibcode = 2006Geo....34.1053L | author-separator=, | author2=D.J. | author3=Ramezan | author4=J. | author5=Bowring | author6=S.A. | display-authors=6 | last7=Payne | first7=Jonathan L. | last8=Orchard | first8=Michael J. | last9=Hongmei | first9=Wang [/tpl] and some writers estimate that the recovery was not complete until 30M years after the P-Tr extinction, i.e. in the late Triassic.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/qq5un1810k7605h5/fulltext.pdf | author=Sahney, S. and Benton, M.J. | year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biological | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | pages = 759–65|format=PDF | pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898[/tpl]  Subsequent to the PT mass extinction, there was an increase in provincialization, with species occupying smaller ranges - perhaps removing incumbents from niches and setting the stage for an eventual rediversification.[tpl]cite doi|10.1073/pnas.1302323110[/tpl]
The effects of mass extinctions on plants are somewhat harder to quantify, given the biases inherent in the plant fossil record. Some mass extinctions (such as the end-Permian) were equally catastrophic for plants, whereas others, such as the end-Devonian, did not affect the flora.[tpl]cite doi|10.1111/j.1502-3931.2011.00262.x[/tpl]
