Prostitute Disfigurement is a death metal band from the Netherlands.

==Biography==

Prostitute Disfigurement started out as a 3-piece near the end of 2000, under the name of Disfigure. They were joined by Roel van Kruysdijk on guitars, just before making their demo recordings. Following their second live show, the band was offered a record deal with Dutch-based Dismemberment Records, after which they released their debut album, Embalmed Madness, now under the name of Prostitute Disfigurement in 2001.
Both the debut album and the demo were recorded using a drum computer. Embalmed Madness was released during October 2001, in a limited quantity of 500 copies, which sold out in a few weeks. Quickly, 500 more were pressed and were again sold out quickly. The album got raving reviews in media such as Aardschok (Netherlands) and Legacy (Germany) and was re-released in 2004 through Unmatched Brutality Records?.
More gigs made a live drummer mandatory, so local guy Tim Bazen joined. After Tim was enlisted, the band started to work on their second album, entitled Deeds of Derangement. It was recorded in early February 2003 and was released on the German based Morbid records in August 2003.
Again great reviews were received, yet despite this, guitarist Niels van Wijk left the band, and Benny Bats was asked to take over his position. To support the album, lots of gigs were performed, including festival appearances on Obscene Extreme, the Morbid festival and the Rotterdam Deathfest. Sharing stages with well-known acts like Suffocation, Exhumed, Gorerotted, Cannibal Corpse and Deicide fed the band only more.
After 2 years of gigs Tim left the band and Michiel van der Plicht was asked almost immediately. He gladly took over the drum duties and, barely a month after he joined the ranks, the band entered Excess Studios to record their third album, entitled Left in Grisly Fashion. This album was released on Neurotic Records in 2005. The reviews were outstanding and Prostitute Disfigurment planned a European tour to mark it.
The fourth full length album was entitled Descendants Of Depravity. The album was released in October 2007 in Europe, with a U.S. release through Willowtip Records/Neurotic Records. They disbanded shortly after releasing Descendants Of Depravity, reasons are unknown.
On the 30th of January 2010 they announced their reunion, Niels van Wijk rejoining the band and lead-guitarist Danny Tunker joining as a full new member.http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=10556137&blogId=527697150 They confirmed a show at the Death Feast Open Air in Germany the same day.http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=10556137&blogId=527697979
