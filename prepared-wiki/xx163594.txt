Sweden's pre-selection for Eurovision Song Contest 2002, Melodifestivalen 2002 was held on March 1, 2002 at Globen in Stockholm. However, there had for the first time been four semifinals around the country in various ice hockey arenas. A second chance heat had also been held. In total, 32 songs competed this year, compared to 10 the previous years. For the first time, songs could be sung in a language other than Swedish. Hosted by Kristin Kaspersen and Claes Ã…kesson, the final was won by Afro-Dite after the disco group won both the televoting and jury voting. The song they performed was written by Marcos Ubeda and called Never let it go.
At the contest Afro-dite were drawn to sing in 12th position, just before the interval. They eventually finished in 8th position (out of 24) with 72 points receiving a maximum 12 points from Bosnia-Herzegovina.
The representant for the home country, Estonia, Sahlene, was Swedish. She finished 3rd, and got 12 points from Sweden.
