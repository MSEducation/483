John Leonard Still (born 24 April 1950) is an English former footballer and the current manager of Luton Town.
After his playing career was cut short by injury, Still began managing non-League clubs around his hometown area of East London, Essex and Kent, achieving title wins with three different clubs. He was manager of Redbridge Forest in 1992 when the club merged with Dagenham to become its current incarnation – Dagenham & Redbridge. Still accepted his first job in The Football League in August 1994 at Peterborough United, and later joined Barnet in June 1997. He took the club to the play-offs twice, before leaving in 2002 after the club was relegated to the Football Conference. Still returned to Dagenham & Redbridge in April 2004, promoting the club to League Two in 2006–07 and then to League One in 2009–10. The club was relegated back to League Two the following season. In February 2013, after nine seasons in charge, Still left Dagenham to join Luton Town. In his first full season as Luton's manager, the club were crowned as Conference Premier champions and won promotion to League Two, making Still the only manager to lead three different clubs to promotion out of non-League football.
Still has earned a reputation for spotting young talented footballers in the non-League game, particularly during his time at Dagenham. A number of players that Still has developed have gone on to play in the Championship and even the Premier League.

==Playing career==

Born in West Ham, Still joined Leyton Orient as a junior, signing as an amateur for them in May 1967. He made his league debut the following season, playing at centre-back against Torquay United, but that proved to be his only league appearance before being released, having injured his knee in the game.[tpl]cite news|title=Uddin thriving in Dagenham leadership role|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/sport/football/article77798.ece|date=30 December 2007|accessdate=29 July 2013|newspaper=Sunday Times[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Osborne|first=Chris|title=Luton Town: John Still provides elusive promotion|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26978684|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 April 2014|date=16 April 2014[/tpl] He moved into non-League football with Bishop's Stortford, Leytonstone and Dagenham. Still's playing career was ended despite surgery on his injured knee and he began coaching, while also working part-time as a salesman.[tpl]cite news|title=Luton appoint John Still as manager|url=http://www.leightonbuzzardonline.co.uk/sport/football/luton-town-fc/luton-appoint-john-still-as-manager-1-4828517|date=26 February 2013|accessdate=27 February 2013|newspaper=Leighton Buzzard Observer[/tpl]

==Management career==

===Part-time career===

Still's first managerial job came with Leytonstone in the late 1970s, who subsequently merged with Ilford to become Leytonstone & Ilford. He took the club to their first Isthmian League title in the 1981–82 season. In 1983, Still joined Dartford as manager, where he won the Southern League title before returning to Leytonstone & Ilford for a short time. His next post was in 1986 at Maidstone United, where he guided them to the Conference title and promotion to The Football League in 1989. Still resigned soon after, having no desire to move into a full-time role, and moved to Isthmian League side Redbridge Forest, which had been formed in 1989 by a merger of his former club Leytonstone & Ilford and Walthamstow Avenue. He guided Redbridge to the Isthmian League title, and with it promotion to the Conference, in the 1990–91 season. Still took Redbridge to a seventh placed finish in the next season, and remained with the club as it yet again merged, this time with Dagenham to become Dagenham & Redbridge, in the summer of 1992. The club finished the 1992–93 season in third and the 1993–94 season in sixth.

===Peterborough United===

In August 1994, Still accepted the manager's role at recently relegated Second Division side Peterborough United. In his first season in charge, Still led the club to a 15th placed finish. He was sacked by the club on 24 October 1995 after winning only three of Peterborough's first 13 league games of the 1995–96 season.[tpl]cite news|title=Sacked by Posh but Still is now a managerial legend|url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/sport/football/peterborough-united/sacked-by-posh-but-still-is-now-a-managerial-legend-1-2108229|accessdate=1 August 2013|newspaper=Peterborough Telegraph|date=10 December 2010[/tpl] While at Peterborough, he gave debuts to players such as Adam Drury, Giuliano Grazioli and Mark Tyler. 

===Barnet===

After leaving Peterborough, Still became a coach at Third Division club Lincoln City, before being appointed as manager of their divisional rivals Barnet in June 1997. In preparation for the 1997–98 season, Still primarily signed players he had worked with at Peterborough, including Ken Charlery, Greg Heald, Billy Manuel, and Scott McGleish. In his first season in charge, Still took Barnet to the Third Division play-offs, but lost 3–2 in the semi-final to Colchester United.[tpl]cite web|title=Barnet F.C. results 1997-98|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=344&teamTabs=results&season_id=129|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=1 August 2013[/tpl] The club finished the 1998–99 season in 16th place and only seven points from relegation – their lowest position since being promoted to The Football League. Still led Barnet to the play-offs once again in the 1999–2000 season, under the threat of the club being expelled from the division due to problems surrounding their home ground, Underhill.[tpl]cite web|title=Barnet fail in play-offs|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/barnet/791120.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 June 2000|accessdate=1 August 2013[/tpl] The club spent most of the season in the league's promotion places, but fell away in the final months and ultimately lost 5–1 on aggregate in the play-off semi-final to Still's former club Peterborough United.[tpl]cite web|title=Barnet F.C. results 1999-2000|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=344&teamTabs=results&season_id=129|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=1 August 2013[/tpl]
In November 2000, Still became Barnet's director of football following the high-profile appointment of former England international Tony Cottee as player-manager. At the time, Barnet were sitting in tenth place in the league, but soon suffered a sharp loss of form and plunged down the table to the relegation zone. On 16 March 2001 Cottee left after losing 13 of his 19 league games as manager, and Still returned to lead the team for the remainder of the season.[tpl]cite web|title=Cottee leaves Barnet|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/barnet/1224277.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 March 2001|accessdate=1 August 2013[/tpl] He was unable to prevent Barnet's slide back into the Conference, as a 3–2 defeat at home to Torquay United on the final day of the season saw them relegated and end a decade-long stay in the Football League.[tpl]cite news|title=Alchemist John Still can rightfully claim to be manager of the year|url=http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Alchemist-John-rightfully-claim-manager-year/story-17476803-detail/story.html#axzz2M7QMp8hy|accessdate=27 February 2013|newspaper=Western Morning News|date=1 December 2012[/tpl] Still agreed to remain as both the club's manager and director of football until a replacement could be found, with the intention to promote youth team coach and former Norwich City defender Ian Culverhouse to manager.[tpl]cite web|title=Still quits as Barnet boss|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/1836273.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 February 2002|accessdate=1 August 2013[/tpl] However, Culverhouse left the club in January 2001 to become youth team coach at Leyton Orient, and Still resigned as manager one month later.[tpl]cite news|title=Barnet boss Still quits|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/barnet-boss-still-quits-6318141.html|accessdate=27 February 2013|newspaper=Evening Standard|date=22 February 2002[/tpl] At the time, Barnet were 14th in the table, winless in seven league games and had been knocked out of the FA Trophy. 
Still remained as Barnet's director of football until the end of the 2001–02 season, before leaving to become the assistant manager of Third Division side Bristol Rovers in May 2002, joining up with Ray Graydon.[tpl]cite web|title=Still named Graydon's assistant|url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-2258.html|publisher=League Managers Association|date=9 May 2002|accessdate=1 August 2013[/tpl] He left the club in December 2003 after Rovers entered financial difficulty and were forced to cancel his contract.[tpl]cite web|title=Rovers release Still|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bristol_rovers/3319731.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 December 2003|accessdate=27 February 2013[/tpl]

===Dagenham & Redbridge===

On 16 April 2004, Still returned to non-League football, taking over as manager of Dagenham & Redbridge for a second time.[tpl]cite web|title=Still gets Dagenham job|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dagenham_and_redbridge/3634991.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=17 April 2004|accessdate=1 August 2013[/tpl] He took charge of the final two games of the 2003–04 season as Dagenham finished in thirteenth position. With less money at his disposal than his predecessor Garry Hill,[tpl]cite web|title=John's Still standing|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dagenham_and_redbridge/4861792.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=30 March 2006|accessdate=2 August 2013[/tpl] Still began overhauling the squad, signing players from further down the league pyramid such as Craig Mackail-Smith, Shane Blackett, Scott Griffiths and Glen Southam, and allowing 15 players to leave.[tpl]cite web|title=Dag & Red transfers 2003-04|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=760&teamTabs=transfers|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=2 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Dag & Red transfers 2004-05|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/teams/team.sd?team_id=760&teamTabs=transfers|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=2 August 2013[/tpl] The club finished the 2004–05 season in eleventh place. Still continued building his squad, signing Carshalton Athletic winger Sam Saunders and White Ensign striker Paul Benson, who was playing in the Essex Olympian League – the eleventh tier of English football. In October 2005, Still was offered the manager's job at Bristol Rovers, but rejected it stating that he was "very settled" at Dagenham.[tpl]cite web|title=Still rejects Pirates job offer|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bristol_rovers/4324672.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=9 October 2005|accessdate=1 August 2013[/tpl] The club struggled for consistency through the 2005–06 campaign, finishing the season in tenth, though with fewer points than in 2004–05. The Dagenham board, who had faith in Still's long-term plans for the club, offered him a new two-year contract, which he signed in July 2006.[tpl]cite web|title=Still signs new Daggers contract|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dagenham_and_redbridge/5211142.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 July 2006|accessdate=2 August 2013[/tpl]
In his third season in charge, his team began well, losing only three of their first 20 matches to sit in second place in the table by November. The team continued its winning form and, on 7 April 2007, won the Conference National title and promotion to League Two for the first time in the club's history with five games of the season left to play.[tpl]cite web|title=Daggers delight at promotion prize|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dagenham_and_redbridge/6532833.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 April 2007|accessdate=2 August 2013[/tpl] Still won the Manager of the Month award for his team's performances in November 2006 and March 2007.[tpl]cite web|title=Daggers boss lands November award|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dagenham_and_redbridge/6199636.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 December 2006|accessdate=2 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Dag & Red boss Still wins award|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dagenham_and_redbridge/6519707.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 April 2007|accessdate=2 August 2013[/tpl]
In the 2007–08 season, Still prevented Dagenham from being immediately relegated back into non-League by guiding them to a 20th place finish, seven points away from the relegation zone. In the following season, Dagenham missed out on a play-off place by one point. Still's team ended that campaign as the league's top scorers with 77 goals in 46 games, and had the second best goal difference behind only league winners Brentford.
In the 2009–10 season, Still led the club to their then-highest ever finish in their history – seventh in League Two – which allowed them to qualify for the play-offs. His team beat Morecambe 7–2 on aggregate in the play-off semi-final, which included a 6–0 win in the first leg.[tpl]cite web|title=History|url=http://www.daggers.co.uk/club/history/|publisher=Dagenham & Redbridge F.C.|accessdate=27 February 2013[/tpl] He led the team out on 30 May 2010 at Wembley Stadium to face Rotherham United for a place in League One. The Daggers won 3–2, with goals from Paul Benson, Danny Green and Jon Nurse, and were promoted to the third tier of English football for the first time.[tpl]cite web|title=John Still hails Dagenham & Redbridge 'fairy story'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/8713853.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=30 May 2010|accessdate=17 August 2013[/tpl] Still won the BBC London Sports Personality of the Year award for this achievement, beating Premier League winning manager Carlo Ancelotti and European Athletics Championship goal medallist Mo Farah, amongst others. Still underwent an operation during the middle of the season to cure an ongoing problem with kidney stones and gallstones; this kept him from attending a number of matches, leaving assistant manager Terry Harris in charge.[tpl]cite web|title=Still to have surgery|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12955_5963534,00.html|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=27 February 2013[/tpl] 
Still's team struggled to compete on their limited budget in League One, and were relegated on the last day of the 2010–11 season following a 5–0 defeat to Peterborough United. On 13 May 2011, Still turned down the managerial job at League Two side Bradford City.[tpl]cite web|title=John Still turns down Bradford City manager's job|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/3579728/John-Still-turns-down-Bradford-City-managers-job.html|publisher=The Sun|date=13 May 2011|accessdate=26 July 2013[/tpl] 
He presided over the reconstruction of Dagenham & Redbridge's squad in 2011–12 as his team finished in nineteenth position. At the beginning of the following season, Still was assured by the Dagenham board that no players would be sold; information which he then relayed to his players.[tpl]cite web|title=John Still: Why I left Dagenham & Redbridge|url=http://www.barkinganddagenhampost.co.uk/sport/john_still_why_i_left_dagenham_redbridge_1_2312157|work=Barking and Dagenham Post|publisher=Archant Community Media Ltd|date=2 August 2013|accessdate=17 August 2013[/tpl] In January 2013, striker Dwight Gayle was sold to Championship team Peterborough United for a club-record fee of £470,000, which left Still feeling "a bit undermined". In February 2013, with Dagenham sitting in sixteenth place in the League Two table, the club was approached by Conference Premier side Luton Town for permission to speak to Still about their vacant managerial job. Still agreed to join Luton, with Dagenham waiving the full compensation fee "in light of the fantastic job he has done for the club".[tpl]cite web|title=John Still: Luton Town appoint Dagenham & Redbridge boss|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21588390|publisher=BBC Sport|date=26 February 2013|accessdate=26 February 2013[/tpl] Before leaving Dagenham, Still was the longest serving Football League manager, having spent nine years at the club.

===Luton Town===

On 26 February 2013, Still joined Conference Premier side Luton Town, replacing Paul Buckle. Still signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with the club, stating that he wanted to bring stability after it had employed four different managers in four seasons.[tpl]cite web|title=Luton Town comment: The Hatters under John Still|url=http://www.bedfordshire-news.co.uk/Sport/Luton-Town-FC/Luton-Town-comment-The-Hatters-under-John-Still-20130429090000.htm|work=Bedfordshire on Sunday|publisher=LSN Media Ltd|first=Luke|last=Peterson|date=29 April 2013|accessdate=29 July 2013[/tpl] While Luton could have mathematically qualified for the play-offs in the final two months of the 2012–13 season, Still elected instead to assess the squad in order to prepare for the next season. Two of the team's worst performances of the season came at this time – a 2–1 home defeat to Hyde on 12 March 2013 and 5–1 loss to Gateshead a month later – but the team rebounded with a five game unbeaten run to end the season in seventh place. Still began making his mark on the club during the close season by releasing twelve players, signing eleven new ones, overhauling the club's backroom staff, and instilling his philosophy on the club.[tpl]cite news| title = Luton Town: Jake Goodman signs on loan from Millwall| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21662213| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 4 March 2013| accessdate = 1 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news| title = Luton Town: John Still confirms summer squad clear-out| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21970033| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 28 March 2013| accessdate = 1 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = Hatters snap up Hull striker Cullen| url = http://www.lutontoday.co.uk/sport/football/luton-town-hatters/hatters-snap-up-hull-striker-cullen-1-5106148| work = Luton Today | publisher = Johnston Publishing Ltd. | date = 17 May 2013 | accessdate = 1 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = Hatters confirm double signing |url = http://www.lutontoday.co.uk/sport/football/luton-town-hatters/hatters-confirm-double-signing-1-5046908 | work = Luton Today | publisher = Johnston Publishing Ltd. | date = 1 May 2013 | accessdate = 1 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news| title = Hatters sign Histon duo| url = http://www.lutontoday.co.uk/sport/football/luton-town-hatters/hatters-sign-histon-duo-1-5109136| work = Luton Today | publisher = Johnston Publishing Ltd. | date = 20 May 2013| accessdate = 1 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news| title = Luton Town appoint Hayrettin as coach| url = http://www.bedfordshire-news.co.uk/Sport/Luton-Town-FC/Football-Luton-Town-appoint-Hayretten-as-coach-20130705100332.htm| work = Bedfordshire on Sunday| publisher = LSN Media Ltd| date = 5 July 2013| accessdate = 1 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news| title = Hatters appoint Wood as goalkeeping coach| url = http://www.lutontoday.co.uk/sport/luton-town/hatters-appoint-wood-as-goalkeeping-coach-1-5334432| work = Luton Today| publisher = Johnston Publishing Ltd| date = 30 July 2013| accessdate = 1 August 2013[/tpl]
The changes began to have the desired effect; on 21 December 2013, following a run of form in the league that put Luton in a strong position to challenge for the title, it was announced that Still had signed a new contract through to 2015 with the condition that, for each promotion the club won, an additional year would be added to the contract.[tpl]cite news| title = Still signs contract extension | url = http://www.lutontown.co.uk/news/article/still-deal-1248795.aspx | publisher = Luton Town F.C. | date = 21 December 2013| accessdate = 21 December 2013[/tpl] Still was later announced as the Conference Premier Manager of the Month for December 2013 following six wins from six games that pushed Luton to the top of the table.[tpl]cite news| title = Still dedicates manager award to whole club| url = http://www.lutontoday.co.uk/sport/luton-town/still-dedicates-manager-award-to-whole-club-1-5791886| work = Luton Today| publisher = Johnston Publishing Ltd| date = 8 January 2014| accessdate = 16 January 2014[/tpl] Luton continued their unbeaten league run under his management, which saw him win the Manager of the Month award for February 2014 after four wins from four games placed the club 14 points clear at the top of the table.[tpl]Cite web| title = Still & Gray win awards| url = http://www.lutontown.co.uk/news/article/double-award-for-february-1385069.aspx| publisher = Luton Town F.C.| date = 26 February 2014| accessdate = 27 February 2014[/tpl] On 15 April 2014, Luton confirmed their return to the Football League and claimed the Conference Premier title after second-placed side Cambridge United lost 2–0 to Kidderminster Harriers.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/26978690 | title=Luton Town win Conference Premier and Football League spot | publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 April 2014 | accessdate=16 April 2014[/tpl] This achievement made Still the only manager to have taken three different clubs to promotion out of non-League football.[tpl]cite web|title=Luton Town return to the Football League after five-year exile |url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/15/luton-town-promoted-football-league |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |date=15 April 2014 |accessdate=17 April 2014[/tpl] Still hailed the campaign as "the most remarkable season ever" that he had been involved in, with his side breaking a number of long-standing club records including the longest league unbeaten run (27 games), most consecutive away games unbeaten (15), most clean sheets (23), and most points accumulated (101).

==Managerial style==

Still has been described as a “direct and conventional tactician”, often utilising a target man and fast wingers and/or strikers in either a 4–4–2 or 4–3–3 formation.[tpl]cite web|title=Top five unheralded managers in the Football League|url=http://thetwounfortunates.com/top-5-unheralded-managers-in-the-football-league/|publisher=The Two Unfortunates|date=19 January 2013|accessdate=26 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Dagenham & Redbridge's man of match still feeling the hump|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/football-league-blog/2011/feb/14/dagenham-and-redbridge-yeovil-town-league-one|publisher=The Guardian|date=14 February 2011|accessdate=29 July 2013[/tpl] During the nine seasons he spent in his second stint as manager of Dagenham & Redbridge, his team primarily employed attacking long ball football.[tpl]cite web|title=Stockley ready for direct approach|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Port-Vale-Stockley-ready-direct-approach/story-12481349-detail/story.html#axzz2aQYG4tEe|work=The Sentinel|publisher=Local World|date=22 August 2008|accessdate=29 July 2013[/tpl] At Dagenham, Still was known to sometimes operate "attractive to watch"[tpl]cite web|title=In conversation with John Still|url=http://www.daggers.co.uk/news/article/in-conversation-with-john-still-550869.aspx|publisher=Dagenham & Redbridge F.C.|date=28 December 2012|accessdate=29 July 2013[/tpl] football and, since becoming manager of Luton Town, his team have been described as playing "fast, attacking football" with a "pass and move" mentality,[tpl]cite news| title = Luton 7-0 Hereford| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26095259| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 15 February 2014| accessdate = 21 February 2014[/tpl] demonstrated by 5–0, 6–0 and 7–0 wins over Alfreton Town, Kidderminster Harriers and Hereford United respectively.[tpl]cite news| title = Luton Town boss thrilled with firepower after Arsenal demolition| url = http://www.luton-dunstable.co.uk/Sport/Luton-Town-FC/Football-Luton-Town-boss-thrilled-with-firepower-after-Arsenal-demolition-20130804131433.htm| work = Bedfordshire on Sunday| publisher = LSN Media Ltd| date = 4 August 2013| accessdate = 5 August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news| title = Alfreton 0-5 Luton| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25164371| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 7 December 2013| accessdate = 21 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news| title = Luton 6-0 Kidderminster| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25474989| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 28 December 2013| accessdate = 21 February 2014[/tpl]

He has won praise for his man-management and talent spotting skills, especially his ability to discover young players in non-League football at the sixth tier and below, develop them and then sell them – often for a significant profit. Players that Still has developed that have gone on to play at a higher level include Marlon King, Craig Mackail-Smith, Paul Benson, Sam Saunders, Danny Green, and Dwight Gayle.
