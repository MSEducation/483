[[18th Indian Infantry Brigade]]

CATEGORIES: British Indian Army brigades

The 18th Indian Infantry Brigade was an Infantry formation of the Indian Army during World War II. It was formed in October, 1940 at Meerut in India and assigned to the 8th Indian Infantry Division.  It was then detached for independent duties in Abaden (Abadan) in Persia. In June 1942, 18th Brigade, having been rushed over to North Africa from Mosul, and attached to the 10th Indian Infantry Division had only two days to prepare defensive positions, was overrun by Rommel's tanks at Deir el Shein in front of the Ruweisat Ridge. In the process, however, they gained valuable time for British Eighth Army to organise the defences for what was to be the first battle of Alamein halting Rommel's advance towards Egypt. The remnants of the Brigade were then sent to the 5th Indian Infantry Division and the Brigade was officially disbanded in August 1942.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=2009-10-23|publisher=Order of Battle|title=18 Indian Brigade|url=http://www.ordersofbattle.com/UnitData.aspx?UniX=1413&Tab=Sup[/tpl]
