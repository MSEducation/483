CATEGORIES: Business models

Entreship is defined as the work that is involved in creating new products and services that ultimately generate value.  It is a systematic and adaptive process that strives to create new strategic and economic value through collaborative behaviors that leverage knowledge and experience, build upon ambition and curiosity and discover and apply new concepts while tolerating ambiguity and vulnerability.   There are four main steps in the entreship process:

Entreship reï¬‚ects the efforts of both individuals and teams in developing new products, business models and services.  Quite often, the mechanics and inventive behaviors of entreship extend beyond the venture founder to external partners. These partners share ideas, risks, plans and action in the pathway to new venture planning and development.
There are two main areas of work in entreship. First, people combine ideas, resources and energy to develop platforms that have some commercial promise. Second, they connect capital to the development, launch and growth scheme of the venture.
