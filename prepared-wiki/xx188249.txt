==Crolly Dolls==

The village gained national and international fame due to the opening of the Crolly Factory in 1939 which started making the renowned Crolly Dolls. The early dolls were handmade with a soft-filled body, a strong head and arms and legs. Their clothes were made from local fabrics and knitted vestments. Soft toys for boys, like teddy bears, were also made at the factory.
The original factory closed in the 1970s. This was a major blow to the local economy. However, in 1993, the popularity of the dolls was recognised and a smaller company was reopened. The Crolly Doll is sold all over the world.http://www.askaboutireland.ie/learning-zone/primary-students/looking-at-places/donegal/home-life-in-donegal/games-and-toys/crolly-dolls/
