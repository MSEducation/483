Torsten Johansson (11 April 1920 – 14 May 2004) was a Swedish tennis player who set a record by shutting out two opponents at Wimbledon in 1946. A 6–0, 6–0, 6–0 victory is a tennis rarity. Johansson played for the Royal Tennis Club in the early 1940s and won more than 100 national titles for the club, a record that still stands. He and Lennart Bergelin turned Sweden into a tennis power after World War II. Johansson played Davis Cup tennis for 16 years, retiring after the 1962 series against Mexico. He played in senior tournaments until his death.
