Heinrich Ernst Ferdinand Guericke (February 25, 1803, Wettin – February 4, 1878, Halle an der Saale), was a German theologian.
He was born at Wettin in Saxony and studied theology at the University of Halle, where he was appointed professor in 1829.  He disapproved of the union between the Lutheran and the Reformed churches, which had been accomplished by the Prussian government in 1817, and in 1833 he joined the Old Lutherans. In 1835 he lost his professorship, but he regained it in 1840.
Among his works were a Life of August Hermann Francke (1827, Eng. trans. 1837), Church History (1833, Eng. trans. by W. G. T. Shedd, New York, 1857-1863), Allgemeine christliche Symbolik (1839). In 1840 he helped to found the Zeitschrift für die gesammte lutherische Theologie und Kirche, and he died at Halle.
