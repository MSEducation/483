Merikoski Power Plant is a hydroelectric power station and a dam in the Koskikeskus district in Oulu, Finland. The plant is owned by the Oulun Energia municipal enterprise of the city of Oulu.
Construction of the power plant was started in 1940, but electricity generation for national grid was not started until 1948. The construction was delayed due to Second World War, although soviet prisoners of war were used as labour during the war.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.oulunenergia.fi/oulun_energia_-konserni/oulun_energia/historia/1940-1950 |title= Oulun Energian historia 1940-1950-luvuilla |author= |language=Finnish |website= |publisher= |accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] The power station building has been designed by architect Bertel Strömmer and the master plan of the area by architect Alvar Aalto.[tpl]cite book |year=1993 |title=Pohjois-Pohjanmaan kulttuurihistoriallisesti merkittävät kohteet Osa 1 |language=Finnish | publisher= Pohjois-Pohjanmaan Seutukaavalaiitto |pages=50 |isbn=951-9328-53-X[/tpl]
