Princess Nicotine; or, The Smoke Fairy is a 1909 five minute silent film directed by J. Stuart Blackton based on an earlier musical starring Lillian Russell.
In the film, a smoker (Paul Panzer) falls asleep and is visited by two fairies (one of which is played by Gladys Hulette). Audiences marveled at the primitive special effects featuring the fairies interacting with objects much larger than themselves.
Princess Nicotine; or, The Smoke Fairy was the first instance of tobacco product placement (for Sweet Corporal cigarettes and cigars) in the movies.
In 2003, the Library of Congress deemed it "significant" and preserved it in the National Film Registry.
