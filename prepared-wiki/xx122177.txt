Sams made the news again in April 2007 when, in a letter to Inside Time, he claimed that "OAPs in prison are far better off than those in the community."
Sams was a competitive middle distance runner before contracting the disease that caused him to lose his leg. He was also a successful businessman, running a heating firm, until his illness that led to his leg amputation in 1975. After which, Sams fell in with petty criminals and was first imprisoned for a false car tax disc in 1976.
As of 2013, he is currently being held at Whitemoor Prison in Cambridgeshire.
Out of the £175,000 ransom that was paid for the release of Slater, Police located £150,000 buried in a field by using Ground Penetrating Radar. The remaining £25,000 was never recovered.

==Radio 4 interview==

On BBC Radio 4's "One to One" programme, Carolyn Quinn spoke to Stephanie Slater.  Slater said that for eight days she was held, handcuffed, legs bound, blindfolded and gagged, in a "coffin" inside a wheelie bin laid horizontally.  Sams had told her she would be electrocuted if she tried to move.  Slater said that when she was allowed out of the coffin for food, she chatted about herself to Sams, both "to humanise" herself and to increase her chances of survival.  Within 12 hours of her release, she was made to face a press conference, even though she was still drugged and highly distressed.  Police now acknowledge that this was much too soon.BBC Radio 4, "One to One", 10 September 2013.
