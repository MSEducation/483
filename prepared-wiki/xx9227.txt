Among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are (where "R" is an organic group): alcohols (R-OH); ethers (R-O-R); ketones (R-CO-R); aldehydes (R-CO-H); carboxylic acids (R-COOH); esters (R-COO-R); acid anhydrides (R-CO-O-CO-R); and amides ([tpl]chem|R-C(O)-NR|2[/tpl]). There are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen, including: acetone, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, furan, THF, diethyl ether, dioxane, ethyl acetate, DMF, DMSO, acetic acid, and formic acid. Acetone ([tpl]chem|(CH|3|)|2|CO[/tpl]) and phenol ([tpl]chem|C|6|H|5|OH[/tpl]) are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances. Other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are: glycerol, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, citric acid, acetic anhydride, and acetamide. Epoxides are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms.
Oxygen reacts spontaneously with many organic compounds at or below room temperature in a process called autoxidation.Cook & Lauer 1968, p.506 Most of the organic compounds that contain oxygen are not made by direct action of [tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl]. Organic compounds important in industry and commerce that are made by direct oxidation of a precursor include ethylene oxide and peracetic acid.
The element is found in almost all biomolecules that are important to (or generated by) life. Only a few common complex biomolecules, such as squalene and the carotenes, contain no oxygen. Of the organic compounds with biological relevance, carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen. All fats, fatty acids, amino acids, and proteins contain oxygen (due to the presence of carbonyl groups in these acids and their ester residues). Oxygen also occurs in phosphate ([tpl]chem|PO|4|3-[/tpl]) groups in the biologically important energy-carrying molecules ATP and ADP, in the backbone and the purines (except adenine) and pyrimidines of RNA and DNA, and in bones as calcium phosphate and hydroxylapatite.

==Safety and precautions==

The NFPA 704 standard rates compressed oxygen gas as nonhazardous to health, nonflammable and nonreactive, but an oxidizer. Refrigerated liquid oxygen (LOX) is given a health hazard rating of 3 (for increased risk of hyperoxia from condensed vapors, and for hazards common to cryogenic liquids such as frostbite), and all other ratings are the same as the compressed gas form.

===Toxicity===

Oxygen gas ([tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl]) can be toxic at elevated partial pressures, leading to convulsions and other health problems.Since [tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl]'s partial pressure is the fraction of [tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] times the total pressure, elevated partial pressures can occur either from high [tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] fraction in breathing gas or from high breathing gas pressure, or a combination of both.Cook & Lauer 1968, p.511 Oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilopascals (kPa), equal to about 50% oxygen composition at standard pressure or 2.5 times the normal sea-level [tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] partial pressure of about 21 kPa. This is not a problem except for patients on mechanical ventilators, since gas supplied through oxygen masks in medical applications is typically composed of only 30%–50% [tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] by volume (about 30 kPa at standard pressure). (although this figure also is subject to wide variation, depending on type of mask).
At one time, premature babies were placed in incubators containing [tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl]-rich air, but this practice was discontinued after some babies were blinded by the oxygen content being too high.
Breathing pure [tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] in space applications, such as in some modern space suits, or in early spacecraft such as Apollo, causes no damage due to the low total pressures used.[tpl]cite web|last = Wade|first = Mark|year = 2007|url = http://www.astronautix.com/craftfam/spasuits.htm|title = Space Suits|publisher = Encyclopedia Astronautica |accessdate=2007-12-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071213122134/http://www.astronautix.com/craftfam/spasuits.htm |archivedate = December 13, 2007[/tpl] In the case of spacesuits, the [tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] partial pressure in the breathing gas is, in general, about 30 kPa (1.4 times normal), and the resulting [tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] partial pressure in the astronaut's arterial blood is only marginally more than normal sea-level [tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] partial pressure (for more information on this, see space suit and arterial blood gas).
Oxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system can also occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving. Prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an [tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] partial pressure more than 60 kPa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wilmshurst P |title=Diving and oxygen |journal=BMJ |volume=317 |issue=7164 |pages=996–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9765173 |pmc=1114047 |doi=10.1136/bmj.317.7164.996[/tpl] Exposure to a [tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] partial pressures greater than 160 kPa (about 1.6 atm) may lead to convulsions (normally fatal for divers). Acute oxygen toxicity (causing seizures, its most feared effect for divers) can occur by breathing an air mixture with 21% [tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] at 66 m or more of depth; the same thing can occur by breathing 100% [tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] at only 6 m.[tpl]cite book |last=Donald |first=Kenneth |title=Oxygen and the Diver |isbn = 1-85421-176-5|year=1992 |publisher=SPA in conjunction with K.

===Combustion and other hazards===

Highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion. Fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity; however, an ignition event, such as heat or a spark, is needed to trigger combustion.[tpl]cite conference|last=Werley|first=Barry L. (Edtr.)|year=1991|title=Fire Hazards in Oxygen Systems|booktitle=ASTM Technical Professional training|publisher=ASTM International Subcommittee G-4.05|location=Philadelphia[/tpl] Oxygen itself is not the fuel, but the oxidant. Combustion hazards also apply to compounds of oxygen with a high oxidative potential, such as peroxides, chlorates, nitrates, perchlorates, and dichromates because they can donate oxygen to a fire.
Concentrated [tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically. Steel pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit both gaseous and liquid oxygen will act as a fuel; and therefore the design and manufacture of [tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] systems requires special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized. The fire that killed the Apollo 1 crew in a launch pad test spread so rapidly because the capsule was pressurized with pure [tpl]chem|O|2[/tpl] but at slightly more than atmospheric pressure, instead of the [tpl]frac|1|3[/tpl] normal pressure that would be used in a mission.[tpl]refn|No single ignition source of the fire was conclusively identified, although some evidence points to arc from an electrical spark.(Report of Apollo 204 Review Board NASA Historical Reference Collection, NASA History Office, NASA HQ, Washington, DC)|group=lower-alpha[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Chiles|first=James R.|year=2001|title=Inviting Disaster: Lessons from the edge of Technology: An inside look at catastrophes and why they happen|location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Inc.|isbn=0-06-662082-1[/tpl]
Liquid oxygen spills, if allowed to soak into organic matter, such as wood, petrochemicals, and asphalt can cause these materials to detonate unpredictably on subsequent mechanical impact. As with other cryogenic liquids, on contact with the human body it can cause frostbites to the skin and the eyes.
