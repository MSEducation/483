Mogilno [tpl]IPAc-pl|m|o|'|g|J|i|l|n|o[/tpl] is a town in central Poland, situated in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship (since 1999), previously in Bydgoszcz Voivodeship (1975–1998).

==History==

Mogilno belongs to one of the oldest settlements along the border of the Greater Poland and Kuyavia historical regions. Since the turn of the 8th and 9th century until the 10th century an early-mediaeval settlement existed there, at the long narrow headland surrounded by waters of Mogilno Lake from the west and south and marshes from the east. In 1065, a Benedictine abbey was founded there by Bolesław the Generous. North of the abbey a town later developed, which in 1398 was granted a city charter, and which was the abbey's property until 1773. After the first Partition of Poland in 1772 the city became a part of the Kingdom of Prussia, and in 1920 it returned to Poland. Since 1898 until his death in 1910 a parish priest in Mogilno's other church St. Jacob (Św. Jakuba) was Piotr Wawrzyniak.

During the German Invasion of Poland in 1939, German forces incited by members of German minority killed 39 Poles and one Jew in the town. The victims were picked out by local Germans for execution. The oldest victim was 75, the youngest 17.Szymon Datner "55 dni Wehrmachtu w Polsce" page 346
