The Union Pacific Railroad [tpl]Reporting marks|UP[/tpl] is a Class I line haul freight railroad that operates 8,300 locomotives over 31,800 route-miles in 23 states west of Chicago, Illinois and New Orleans, Louisiana. The Union Pacific Railroad network is the largest in the United States and is serviced by 45,400 employees.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.up.com/aboutup/corporate_info/uprrover/index.htm| title=Company Overview| publisher=Union Pacific Corporation| date=31 December 2013| accessdate=27 March 2014[/tpl]
Union Pacific Railroad is the principal operating company of Union Pacific Corporation ([tpl]nyse|UNP[/tpl]); both are headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. Over the years Union Pacific Corporation has grown by acquiring other railroads, notably the Missouri Pacific, Chicago and North Western, Western Pacific, Missouri-Kansas-Texas, and the Southern Pacific (including the Rio Grande). Union Pacific Corporation also owns a 26% interest in Mexico-based Ferromex.
Union Pacific Corporation's leading railroad competitor is the BNSF Railway, which covers much of the same territory.
The current chairman of Union Pacific Corporation is Jack Koraleski.[tpl]cite web|title=Union Pacific Corporation Elects David B.

==History==

The original company, before merging with the Central Pacific Railroad, was incorporated on July 1, 1862 under an act of Congress entitled Pacific Railroad Act of 1862. The act was approved by President Abraham Lincoln, and it provided for the construction of railroads from the Missouri River to the Pacific as a war measure for the preservation of the Union."An Act to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri river to the Pacific ocean, and to secure to the government the use of the same for postal, military, and other purposes 12 Stat. 489, July 1, 1862 It was constructed westwardly from Council Bluffs, Iowa to meet the Central Pacific line, which was constructed eastwardly from San Francisco Bay. The line was constructed primarily by Irish labor who had learned their craft during the recent Civil War.[tpl]cite book|last=Collins|first=R.M.|title=Irish Gandy Dancer: A tale of building the Transcontiental Railroad|year=2010|publisher=Create Space|location=Seattle|isbn=978-1-4528-2631-8|page=198|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1452826315[/tpl] The two lines were joined together at  Promontory Summit, Utah, fifty-three miles west of Ogden on May 10, 1869, hence creating the first transcontinental railroad in North America.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11371/ |title = Ceremony at "Wedding of the Rails," May 10, 1869 at Promontory Point, Utah |website = World Digital Library |date = 1869-05-10 |accessdate = 2013-07-20 [/tpl] Under the guidance of its dominant stockholder Dr. Thomas Clark Durant, the namesake of the city of Durant, Iowa, the first rails were laid in Omaha. Subsequently, UP took over three Mormon-built roads: the Utah Central Railroad extending south from Ogden, Utah, to Salt Lake City, the Utah Southern Railroad extending south from Salt Lake City into the Utah Valley, and the Utah Northern Railroad extending north from Ogden into Idaho; and it built or absorbed local lines that gave it access to Denver and to Portland, Oregon, and the Pacific Northwest. It acquired the Kansas Pacific (originally called the Union Pacific, Eastern Division, though in essence a separate railroad). It also owned narrow gauge trackage into the heart of the Colorado Rockies and a standard gauge line south from Denver across New Mexico into Texas (both parts of the Union Pacific, Denver and Gulf Railway).
UP was entangled in the Crédit Mobilier scandal, exposed in 1872, that involved bribing congressmen and stock speculations.  Its early troubles led to bankruptcy during the 1870s, the result of which was reorganization of the Union Pacific Railroad as the Union Pacific Railway on January 24, 1880, with its dominant stockholder being Jay Gould. The new company also declared bankruptcy, in 1893, but emerged on July 1, 1897, reverting to the original name, Union Pacific Railroad. Such minor changes in corporate titles were a common result of reorganization after bankruptcy among American railroads.
In this period, the UP sold off some of its holdings; the Union Pacific Railway, Central Branch became the Central Branch of the Missouri Pacific Railroad and the Southern Branch was acquired by the newly incorporated Missouri Kansas Texas Railroad in 1870. However, the UP soon recovered, and was strong enough to take control of Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) in 1901. It was ordered in 1913 by the U.S. Supreme Court to surrender control of the same.
UP founded the Sun Valley resort in Idaho in 1936; the UP engineering department in Omaha designed the first ski chairlift that summer. After the national mergers and railroad restructuring of the 1980s, UP reacquired the MP and MKT. On September 11, 1996 UP finally acquired SP in a transaction envisioned nearly a century earlier.
The headquarters of the railroad operation of the UP has been in Omaha, Nebraska, since its inception. It occupies the Union Pacific Center, completed in 2003. Other important UP facilities in Omaha have included the Union Pacific Railroad Omaha Shops Facility and the Harriman Dispatch Center.
The corporate headquarters of the Union Pacific Corporation were located in New York City from its initial founding in the 1860s until Drew Lewis became CEO in the mid-1980s. He relocated it to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Later the headquarters was shifted to Dallas, Texas, before relocating to Omaha to join the operating headquarters.UP:Chronological History, Union Pacific Railroad

In the tables "UP" includes OSL-OWR&N-LA&SL-StJ&GI; 1925–1944 passenger-mile totals do not include Laramie North Park & Western, Saratoga & Encampment Valley, or Pacific & Idaho Northern, and none of the totals includes Spokane International or Mount Hood. From the ICC annual reports, except 1979 is from Moody's.
On December 31, 1925 UP-OSL-OWRN-LA&SL-StJ&GI operated 9,834 route-miles and 15,265 track-miles. At the end of 1980, Union Pacific operated 9,266 route-miles and 15,647 miles of track.1980 mileage is from Moody's Transportation Manual (1981); the ICC's Transport Statistics says Union Pacific System operated 8,614 route-miles at year end 1980, but the 1979 issue says 9,315 route-miles and the 1981 says 9,096, so their 1980 figures look unlikely. Moody's shows 220,697 million revenue ton-miles in 1993 on the expanded system (17,835 route-miles at the end of the year).

==Union Pacific Corporation==

Union Pacific Corporation is the publicly traded parent company of all Union Pacific subsidiaries and operating companies, including Union Pacific Railroad Company, the largest operating company, and Southern Pacific Rail Corporation. Union Pacific Corporation was incorporated in Utah in 1969. Union Pacific Corporation's headquarters are located in Omaha, Nebraska. James R. Young is the Chairman of Union Pacific Corporation; John J. Koraleski is the President and Chief Executive Officer.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Union Pacific Corporation purchased several non-railroad companies, such as Skyway Freight Systems of Watsonville, California and United States Pollution Control, Inc. In 1986, Union Pacific Corporation purchased Overnite Transportation, a less-than-truckload shipping carrier.
By 2000, following the appointment of Richard K. Davidson as CEO, Union Pacific Corporation had divested itself of all non-railroad properties except for Overnite Transportation and Fenix Enterprises, a holding company for logistical technology. In 2004, Union Pacific Corporation divested itself of Overnite Transportation through an IPO.
The Union Pacific Corporation headquarters were located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania until 1997, when Richard K. Davidson announced that the headquarters would move to Dallas, Texas in September of that year. In 1999, due to the sale of Skyway Freight Systems and the impending divestiture of Overnite Transportation, the Union Pacific Corporation headquarters moved to Omaha, Nebraska, and are now co-located with the operating headquarters of the Union Pacific Railroad Company.
John J Koraleski became the new UP CEO after the former Jim Young's February 2014 death. Jim Young died of pancreatic cancer at age 61 and is survived by his wife Shirley, 3 children, and 2 grandchildren. Admired by many railroaders, especially UP's employees, it was shocking and saddening to many upon word of his death.

==Current trackage==

Operating primarily west of the Mississippi River, the Union Pacific directly owns and operates 31,900 route miles of track in the following U.S. states: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
For administrative purposes, the UP is divided into three regions:  Western, Northern and Southern.  The railroad is then further subdivided into twenty (20) "service units": Chicago, Commuter Operations, Council Bluffs, Denver, Fort Worth, Houston, Kansas City, Livonia, Los Angeles, North Little Rock, North Platte, Pocatello, Portland, Roseville, Saint Louis, San Antonio, Sunset, Twin Cities, Utah and Wichita.
Each service unit is further divided into several subdivisions and industrial leads which represent segments of track ranging from [tpl]convert|2|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] branch lines to [tpl]convert|300|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] mainlines.
Union Pacific has also been able to reach agreements with competing railroads, mostly BNSF that allow the railroad to operate its own trains with its own crews on hundreds of additional miles of competing railroads' tracks, extending its reach and filling in gaps in its network.  Due to these agreements and the practice of locomotive leasing and sharing, UP locomotives commonly show up on competitor's tracks throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico.

==Yards and facilities==

Because of the large size of UP, hundreds of yards throughout its rail network are needed to effectively handle the daily transport of goods from one place to another. To reduce overall emissions, Union Pacific is acquiring a new generation of environmentally friendly locomotives for use in Los Angeles basin rail yards.
Some of the more prominent rail facilities in UP’s system include:

===Active hump yards===

Hump yards work by using a small hill over which cars are pushed, before being released down a slope and switched automatically into cuts of cars, ready to be made into outbound trains. UP's active humps include:[tpl]cite web| author=Trains Magazine| date=July 8, 2006| url=http://www.trains.com/trn/default.aspx?c=a&id=537| title=North America's Hump Yards| accessdate=June 27, 2008 [/tpl]

==Union Pacific Railroad Museum==

The Union Pacific Railroad Museum in Council Bluffs, Iowa, houses one of the oldest corporate collections in the United States. It includes artifacts, photographs, and documents that trace the development of the railroad and the American West.
The completion of Union Pacific’s transcontinental railroad in 1869 helped shape the landscape and geography and brought tens of thousands of westward-bound immigrants to the American West.
The museum’s collection features weapons from the late 19th and 20th centuries, outlaw paraphernalia, a sampling of the immigrants’ possessions, and a photograph collection comprising more than 500,000 images.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.uprr.com/aboutup/history/museum/index.shtml|title=About Us: The Union Pacific Railroad Museum|accessdate=September 16, 2009[/tpl]

==Locomotive and rolling stock==

===Paint and colors===

UP's basic paint scheme for its diesel-electric locomotives is the oldest still in use by a major railroad.  The middle two-thirds of the locomotive body is painted Armour Yellow, so-named because it was the color used by the Armour meat company.  A thin band of Signal Red divides this from the Harbor Mist Gray (a fairly light gray) used for the body and roof above that point.  Signal Red is also painted at the bottom of the locomotive body, but this color has gradually become yellow as new Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations for reflectorized tape came into effect in 2005; the trucks, underframe, fuel tanks and everything else beneath that line are also Harbor Mist Gray.  Lettering and numbering are in Signal Red, with black outlines.  Some locomotives (historically passenger locomotives, and some recent units from 2000 on) have white-outlined blue "wings" on the nose.  More recently, some units have been repainted with a large, billowing American flag with the corporate motto "Building America" on the side, where the 'UNION PACIFIC' lettering is normally positioned. This paint scheme is known as "Building America," "Wings," or "Flags and Flares."
The Armour Yellow livery was first introduced on the UP's M-10000 streamliner train in 1934, although Leaf Brown was used instead of Harbor Mist Grey.  Passenger cars, cabooses, and other non-freight equipment have also been painted in a similar fashion.
The steam locomotive paint schemes are unique in their own way. Up until the mid-1940s, all steam locomotives on UP were painted in a standard scheme: the smokebox and firebox were painted graphite and the rest was painted jet black; the lettering was usually aluminum. In the late 1940s, many passenger steam locomotives were repainted in a two-tone grey scheme to match the scheme applied to some coaching stock. These locomotives were painted light grey, with one dark gray strip running from front to rear alongside the running board and in the middle of the tender. This dark grey strip was outlined in yellow (originally aluminum), and all lettering inside the strip was yellow also.  After 1952, these locomotives were repainted in the same basic black color scheme as the earlier freight locomotives.  The grey passenger cars were repainted in the yellow scheme.
From the second half of 2005 to the summer of 2006, UP unveiled a new set of six EMD SD70ACe locomotives in "Heritage Colors," painted in schemes reminiscent of railroads acquired by UP since the 1980s. The engine numbers match the year that the predecessor railroad was absorbed into Union Pacific. The locomotives commemorate the Missouri Pacific with UP 1982, the Western Pacific with UP 1983, the Missouri-Kansas-Texas with UP 1988, the Chicago and North Western with UP 1995, the Southern Pacific with UP 1996, and the Denver and Rio Grande Western with UP 1989. Although the Denver and Rio Grande Western was not a direct predecessor because it had purchased the SP in 1988 but kept the larger system's name, the Union Pacific still included it in the heritage series.[tpl]cite press release| publisher=Union Pacific Railroad| url=http://www.uprr.com/newsinfo/releases/heritage_and_steam/2006/0619_drgw.shtml| title= Denver & Rio Grande Western Colors Again Ride the Rails| date=June 19, 2006| accessdate=April 20, 2010[/tpl]
In October 2005, UP unveiled another specially painted SD70ACe: 4141 has "George Bush 41" on the sides and its paint scheme resembles that of Air Force One.
On March 31, 2010, UP dedicated a specially painted GE ES44AC locomotive commemorating the centennial of the Boy Scouts of America.[tpl]cite press release| publisher=Union Pacific Railroad| url=http://www.uprr.com/newsinfo/releases/community/2010/0331_boyscouts.shtml| title=Union Pacific Railroad Unveils No. 2010 Boy Scouts of America Commemorative Locomotive| date=March 31, 2010| accessdate=April 20, 2010[/tpl] Although it retains the standard Armour Yellow and Harbor Mist colors, the unit has a large BSA 2010 logo on each side of the long hood, and the scouting logo low on the side of the cab.

===2013 locomotive roster===

As of October 2013, the Union Pacific had 8,185 locomotives on its active roster.  The locomotive fleet consists of 42 different models and had an average age of 17.8 years.Locomotive 2013

===Surviving merger partner locomotives===

As of March 21, 2010, UP operates 50 Southern Pacific, 36 St. Louis Southwestern (Cotton Belt), and 2 Chicago and North Western locomotives that are still in the former railroads' paint. In addition, many locomotives have been "patched" and renumbered by UP, varying in the degree of the previous railroads' logos being eradicated, but always with a yellow patch applied over the locomotive's former number and a new UP number applied on the cab. This allows UP to number locomotives into its roster, yet it takes less time and money than it does to perform a complete repaint into UP colors. As of July 31, 2005, UP rostered 492 "patches", consisting of:
While not technically a predecessor locomotive in the traditional sense, UP rosters a single SD40-2 (3564) still in the 1970s paint scheme.

===Historic locomotives===

Alone among modern railroads, UP maintains a small fleet of historic locomotives for special trains and hire in its Cheyenne, Wyoming roundhouse.
In addition there are a number of other locomotives kept in storage for possible future restoration. Rio Grande (DRGW) F9B 5763 is one of the units in storage, part of the Trio (A-B-B) of F9s that served on the Rio Grande in various Passenger Duty services (From the Denver Ski Train to the Zephyr Trains) until their retirement in 1996. Sister Units 5771 (F9A) and 5762 (F9B) were donated to the Colorado Railroad Museum. Chicago and North Western F7 No. 401, used for Chicago and North Western business trains, also was retained by UP.
UP 838, a twin to 844, is stored in the Cheyenne roundhouse as a parts source, though as most of its usable parts have already been applied to 844, it is more likely to see use as a source of pattern parts for reproduction replacements.  Reputedly, 838's boiler is in better condition than that of 844, due to 838 having not been in steam since retirement, compared to 844's relatively heavy use since 1960.
Among the former tenants was Southern Pacific 1518 (the first production SD7 ex EMD demo 990), transferred to the Illinois Railway Museum after some time in storage in the UP shops.
On July 23, 2013, UP announced that they had acquired Big Boy locomotive 4014, currently in Pomona, California from the Southern California Chapter of the Railway & Locomotive Historical Society, with the intent of restoring it to operating condition."Union Pacific Railroad Acquires Big Boy Locomotive No. 4014" July 23, 2013, retrieved July 23, 2013 http://www.uprr.com/newsinfo/releases/heritage_and_steam/2013/0723_4014.shtml

===Preserved steam locomotives===

In addition to the historic fleet outlined above kept by UP itself, a large number of UP locomotives survive elsewhere.  Many locomotives were donated to towns along the Union Pacific tracks, for instance, as well as locomotives donated to museums.

==Passenger train service==

Union Pacific operated through passenger service over its historic "Overland Route" between 1869 until May 1, 1971. The last passenger train operated by UP was the westbound City of Los Angeles. After May 1, 1971, Amtrak assumed operation of long-distance passenger operations in the United States. UP at various times operated the following named passenger trains:
UP mainly operates commuter trains for Metra on the Union Pacific Lines: Union Pacific/North Line, Union Pacific/Northwest Line, and  Union Pacific/West Line.
Many Amtrak routes currently utilize Union Pacific rails:

==Accidents==

On June 28, 2004, in the San Antonio suburb of Macdona, Texas, a UP train collided with an idle BNSF train resulting in the puncturing of a 90-ton tank car carrying liquified chlorine. As the chlorine vaporized, a toxic "yellow cloud" soon formed which killed three (the UP conductor and two residents nearby) and caused 43 hospitalizations. The costs of cleanup and property damaged during the incident exceeded $7 million.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.aristatek.com/newsletter/0708August/TechSpeak.pdf |title= Chlorine Rail Car Incident |publisher= Aristatek |accessdate=April 18, 2010[/tpl]

Various investigations of the Macdona incident have revealed several serious safety lapses on the part of the Union Pacific and its employees; specifically, Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) officials in 2004 reported that the Union Pacific had "notable deficiencies", including its employees not following the company's own safety rules.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/17/politics/17rail.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Jenny | last1=Nordberg | first2=Walt | last2=Bogdanich | title=Regulators Plan to Step Up Union Pacific Safety Checks | date=November 17, 2004[/tpl] While initial reports blamed "fatigue" of the crew of the UP train,[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] many other contributing factors have been cited. Among those, the chlorine tank cars were improperly placed near the front of the train.[ref]
</ref> Cars containing hazardous materials have traditionally been placed away from the front of the train, an operational measure used to safeguard against the likelihood of  the such cars being among the first affected in a derailment and to reduce their likelihood of colliding with heavier steel cars.[tpl]Clarify|date=June 2011[/tpl]
On September 4, 2007 a Union Pacific train derailment split the small town of Sergeant Bluff, IA in half. Around 16 cars, most of them carrying salt, derailed spilling its contents in mountainous snow like piles. The derailment caused an interruption in traffic for about two hours until city officials could clean up the messhttp://siouxcityjournal.com/news/derailment-cuts-traffic-in-sergeant-bluff/article_ff021c78-42b3-510d-baa7-f70c5404d375.html
In the aftermath of the Macdona and other incidents, the Federal Railroad Administration signed a compliance agreement with the railroad in November 2004 in which the railroad promised to rectify the "notable deficiencies" that regulators found. Specifically, the agreement mandated increased training for railroad managers and increased the number of FRA inspectors in the region by 10. United States Assemblyman Charlie Gonzalez questioned if the agreement went far enough; he and other Congressional delegation members questioned the FRA's "partnership" approach as being "too cozy a relationship to the railroads" and cited an article in The New York Times that reported that the acting FRA administrator, Betty Monro, and the chief lobbyist for Union Pacific, Mary E. McAuliffe, had vacationed several times together on Nantucket.
The railroad's San Antonio Service Unit (SASU) has had other derailments,[ref]

==Facts and figures==

According to UP's 2007 Annual Report to Investors, at the end of 2007 it had more than 50,000 employees, 8,721 locomotives, and 94,284 freight cars.
Broken down by specific type of car, owned and leased:
In addition, it owns 6,950 different pieces of maintenance of way work equipment. At the end of 2007 the average age of UP’s locomotive fleet was 14.8 years, the freight car fleet 28 years.

==Environmental record==

Citing its development of a "green" locomotive fleet and energy conservation measures, the UP states it is "...committed to protecting the environment now and for future generations. Our employees, customers, shareholders and the communities we serve can expect our full compliance with all laws and regulations ... We will continue our leadership in caring for the environment while delivering the goods that America needs."[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.uprr.com/she/emg/index.shtml| title=UP: Environmental Management| author=Union Pacific Railroad| accessdate=March 29, 2009[/tpl] In Eugene, Oregon, the UP and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality are jointly studying ground contamination at the railroad's yard originating with the Southern Pacific from over one hundred years ago, consisting mostly of petroleum hydrocarbons, industrial solvents, and metals.

Union Pacific Railroad in 2007 started an experimental method of reducing emissions from the engine exhaust of their locomotives. By adding an experimental oxidation catalyst filtering canister to the diesel engine's exhaust manifold, they are attempting to reduce the amount of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulate matter generated, much like a catalytic converter in automobiles and trucks. The United States Environmental Protection Agency’s National Vehicle Fuels and Emissions Laboratory provided most of the funding for the test.  Using Ultra Low Sulfur diesel with the oxicat resulted in reduced particulate emissions by approximately 50 percent, unburned hydrocarbons by 38 percent and carbon monoxide by 82 percent.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.environmentalleader.com/2007/01/18/union-pacific-tests-exhaust-catalyst-on-locomotives/| title=Union Pacific Tests Exhaust Catalyst on Locomotives| date=January 18, 2007| work=Environmental Leader| accessdate=May 8, 2008[/tpl]
The company's Fuel Master program uses the expertise of locomotive engineers to save fuel. Engineers who save the most fuel are rewarded on a monthly basis. The program has saved the company millions of dollars, a significant amount of which has been returned to the engineers. In 2006, the program founder, Wayne Kennedy, received the John H. Chafee Environmental Award, and the program was recognized by Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta.Green Car Congress: DOT Secretary Commends Union Pacifics Conservation Program, Says US Needs to Go on Energy Diet
