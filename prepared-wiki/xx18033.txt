Halley's Comet or Comet Halley ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|l|i[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|eɪ|l|i[/tpl]), officially designated 1P/Halley, is the best-known of the short-period comets and is visible from Earth every 75–76 years,[tpl]Cite web|author=G. W. Kronk|title=1P/Halley |url=http://cometography.com/pcomets/001p.html| publisher=cometography.com|accessdate=13 October 2008[/tpl] Halley is the only short-period comet that is clearly visible to the naked eye from Earth, and the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime. Other naked-eye comets may be brighter and more spectacular, but will appear only once in thousands of years. Halley last appeared in the inner Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061.[ref]

Halley's returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers since at least 240 BC. Clear records of the comet's appearances were made by Chinese, Babylonian, and medieval European chroniclers, but were not recognized as reappearances of the same object at the time. The comet's periodicity was first determined in 1705 by English astronomer Edmond Halley, after whom it is now named.
During its 1986 apparition, Halley's Comet became the first to be observed in detail by spacecraft, providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation. These observations supported a number of longstanding hypotheses about comet construction, particularly Fred Whipple's "dirty snowball" model, which correctly predicted that Halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices – such as water, carbon dioxide and ammonia – and dust. The missions also provided data which substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas; for instance it is now understood that the surface of Halley is largely composed of dusty, non-volatile materials, and that only a small portion of it is icy.

Comet Halley is commonly pronounced [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|l|i[/tpl], rhyming with valley, or [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|eɪ|l|i[/tpl], rhyming with daily.[tpl]Cite web|title=Halley|publisher=Merriam–Webster Online|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Halley|accessdate=21 December 2009[/tpl] Spellings of Edmond Halley's name during his lifetime included Hailey, Haley, Hayley, Halley, Hawley, and Hawly, so its contemporary pronunciation is uncertain.[tpl]cite news|title=New York Times Science Q&A|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/14/science/q-a-237647.html|accessdate=9 January 2011|work=The New York Times|date=14 May 1985[/tpl]

==Computation of orbit==

Halley was the first comet to be recognized as periodic. Until the Renaissance, the philosophical consensus on the nature of comets, promoted by Aristotle, was that they were disturbances in Earth's atmosphere. This idea was disproved in 1577 by Tycho Brahe, who used parallax measurements to show that comets must lie beyond the Moon. Many were still unconvinced that comets actually orbited the Sun, and assumed they must instead follow straight paths through the Solar System.Lancaster-Brown pp. 14, 25
In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published his Principia, in which he outlined his laws of gravity and motion. His work on comets was decidedly incomplete. Although he had suspected that two comets that had appeared in succession in 1680 and 1681 were the same comet before and after passing behind the Sun (he was later found to be correct; see Newton's Comet),Lancaster-Brown p. 35 he was unable to completely reconcile comets into his model. Ultimately, it was Newton's friend, editor and publisher, Edmond Halley, who, in his 1705 Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets, used Newton's new laws to calculate the gravitational effects of Jupiter and Saturn on cometary orbits.Lancaster-Brown p. 76 This calculation enabled him, after examining historical records, to determine that the orbital elements of a second comet which had appeared in 1682 were nearly the same as those of two comets which had appeared in 1531 (observed by Petrus Apianus) and 1607 (observed by Johannes Kepler). Halley thus concluded that all three comets were in fact the same object returning every 76 years, a period that has since been amended to every 75–76 years. After a rough estimate of the perturbations the comet would sustain from the gravitational attraction of the planets, he predicted its return for 1758.Lancaster-Brown p. 78
Halley's prediction of the comet's return proved to be correct, although it was not seen until 25 December 1758, by Johann Georg Palitzsch, a German farmer and amateur astronomer. It did not pass through its perihelion until 13 March 1759, the attraction of Jupiter and Saturn having caused a retardation of 618 days.Lancaster-Brown p. 86 This effect was computed prior to its return (with a one-month error to 13 April)Sagan and Druyan p. 74 by a team of three French mathematicians, Alexis Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-Reine Lepaute.Lancaster-Brown pp. 84–85 Halley himself did not live to see the comet return, as he died in 1742.Lancaster-Brown p. 80 The confirmation of the comet's return was the first time anything other than planets had been shown to orbit the Sun. It was also one of the earliest successful tests of Newtonian physics, and a clear demonstration of its explanatory power. The comet was first named in Halley's honour by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1759.
The possibility has been raised that 1st-century Jewish astronomers had already recognized Halley's Comet as periodic.S. Brodetsky, "Astronomy in the Babylonian Talmud", Jewish Review, 1911, p. 60. This theory notes a passage in the TalmudTractate Horioth page 10a which refers to "a star which appears once in seventy years that makes the captains of the ships err."[tpl]Cite book|author=J. D.

==Orbit and origin==

Halley's orbital period over the last 3 centuries has been between 75–76 years, though it has varied between 74–79 years since 240 BC. Its orbit around the Sun is highly elliptical, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.967 (with 0 being a perfect circle and 1 being a parabolic trajectory). The perihelion, the point in the comet's orbit when it is nearest the Sun, is just 0.6 AU.Astronomical unit: approximately the distance of Earth from the Sun This is between the orbits of Mercury and Venus.  Its aphelion, or farthest distance from the Sun, is 35 AU (roughly the distance of Pluto). Unusually for an object in the Solar System, Halley's orbit is retrograde; it orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the planets, or clockwise from above the Sun's north pole. The orbit is inclined by 18° to the ecliptic, with much of it lying south of the ecliptic.(As it is retrograde, the true inclination is 162°).[tpl]Cite web|title=OAA computing sectioncircular|publisher=Oriental Astronomical Association|url=http://www.oaa.gr.jp/~oaacs/nk/nk866.htm|author=S. Nakano|year=2001|accessdate=15 May 2007[/tpl] Due to the retrograde orbit, it has one of the highest velocities relative to the Earth of any object in the Solar System. The 1910 passage was at a relative velocity of 70.56 km/s (157,838 mph or 254,016 km/h). Because its orbit comes close to Earth's in two places, Halley is the parent body of two meteor showers: the Eta Aquariids in early May, and the Orionids in late October.[tpl]Cite web|title=Meteor Streams|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?meteor_streams|accessdate=15 March 2007[/tpl] However, observations conducted around the time of Halley's appearance in 1986 suggest that the Eta Aquarid meteor shower might not originate from Halley's Comet, though it might be perturbed by it.[tpl]Cite journal|title=An Investigation Into the Association Between Eta-Aquarid Meteor Shower and Halley's Comet|author=Umasankar Mitra |journal=Bulletin of the Astronomical Society of India|bibcode=1987BASI...15...23M|year=1987|volume=15|pages=23[/tpl]

Halley is classified as a periodic or short-period comet; one with an orbit lasting 200 years or less. This contrasts it with long-period comets, whose orbits last for thousands of years. Periodic comets have an average inclination to the ecliptic of only ten degrees, and an orbital period of just 6.5 years, so Halley's orbit is atypical.[tpl]Cite journal|author= D. W.

Those like Halley, with orbital periods of between 20 and 200 years and inclinations extending from zero to more than 90 degrees, are called Halley-type comets.[tpl]Cite journal|title=From Kuiper Belt Object to Cometary Nucleus: The Missing Ultrared Matter|author=D.

The orbits of the Halley-type comets suggest that they were originally long-period comets whose orbits were perturbed by the gravity of the giant planets and directed into the inner Solar System. If Halley was once a long-period comet, it is likely to have originated in the Oort Cloud, a sphere of cometary bodies that has an inner edge of 20,000–50,000 AU. Conversely the Jupiter-family comets are believed to originate in the Kuiper belt, a flat disc of icy debris between 30 AU (Neptune's orbit) and 50 AU from the Sun (in the scattered disc). Another point of origin for the Halley-type comets has been proposed. In 2008, a trans-Neptunian object with a retrograde orbit similar to Halley's was discovered, [tpl]mpl|2008 KV|42[/tpl], whose orbit takes it from just outside that of Uranus to twice the distance of Pluto. It may be a member of a new population of small Solar System bodies that serves as the source of Halley-type comets.[tpl]Cite journal|author=B.

Halley has probably been in its current orbit for 16,000–200,000 years, although it is not possible to numerically integrate its orbit for more than a few tens of apparitions, and close approaches before 837 AD can only be verified from recorded observations.[ref]

In 1989, Boris Chirikov and Vitaly Vecheslavov performed an analysis of 46 apparitions of Halley's Comet taken from historical records and computer simulations. These studies showed that its dynamics were chaotic and unpredictable on long timescales.[tpl]Cite journal|author=B.V. Chirikov and V.V.

More recent work suggests that Halley will evaporate, or split in two, within the next few tens of thousands of years, or will be ejected from the Solar System within a few hundred thousand years. Observations by D.W. Hughes suggest that Halley's nucleus has been reduced in mass by 80–90% over the last 2000–3000 revolutions.

==Structure and composition==

The Giotto and Vega missions gave planetary scientists their first view of Halley's surface and structure. Like all comets, as Halley nears the Sun, its volatile compounds (those with low boiling points, such as water, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and other ices) begin to sublime from the surface of its nucleus. This causes the comet to develop a coma, or atmosphere, up to 100,000 km across.[ref]
