[[EHF coefficient rank]]

CATEGORIES: European Handball Federation

The EHF coefficient rank is a list made by European Handball Federation. The list is a result of the clubs of the EHF member federations' results in the EHF Champions League (CL), EHF Cup (EC), EHF Cup Winners' Cup (CWC) and EHF Challenge Cup (ChC) the past three seasons. Most national federations have five (from 2012/13: four) teams in the above mentioned competitions. There are, however, differences between which competitions they qualify for and in which round they enter. If a national federation has more than one team in the same competition, they may enter the same competition in different rounds. For example the national federations that have two teams in the women's Champions League: The national champions qualify directly for the group stage, while the runner-ups start in the qualification round.
