Horses is the debut studio album by American musician Patti Smith, released on December 13, 1975 on Arista Records. The record was a key factor and major influence on the New York punk rock scene.

==Inspiration==

At the time she recorded Horses, Patti Smith and her band were favorites in the New York club scene along with Blondie and The Ramones. The former's influence can be best heard in the track "Gloria", a radical retake on the Them song. "Birdland", in particular, owed more to the jazz which Smith's mother enjoyed than to the influence of punk. When recording this song, which was improvised by the band in Electric Lady Studios, Smith has said she imagined the spirit of Jimi Hendrix watching her. The lyrics of "Birdland" are based upon A Book of Dreams, a 1973 memoir of Wilhelm Reich by his son Peter. Several of the album's songs — "Redondo Beach", "Free Money", "Kimberly" — were inspired by moments with members of Smith's family, while others — "Break It Up", "Elegie" — were written about her idols. "Land" was already a live favorite and featured the first verse of Chris Kenner's "Land of a Thousand Dances" and contains a tribute to her long-time idol Arthur Rimbaud."[tpl]cite book |last=Paytress |first=Mark |title=Break It Up: Patti Smith's Horses and the remaking of Rock 'n' Roll |series=Record Collector |origyear=2006 |publisher=Portrait |isbn=0-7499-5107-9 |pages=260 |ref=http://books.google.com/books?id=hjbBAAAACAAJ[/tpl] Guest musicians included Tom Verlaine of Television and Allen Lanier of Blue Öyster Cult.

==Reception and influence==

Horses is often cited as one of the greatest albums in music history. In 2003, the album was ranked number 44 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time |title=The RS 500 Greatest Albums of All Time |accessdate=2008-02-28 |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2003-11-18[/tpl] NME named the album number 1 in its list "20 Near-as-Damn-It Perfect Initial Efforts".[tpl]cite web |url=http://acclaimedmusic.net/Current/A332.htm |title=Best of All-time Lists |accessdate=2008-02-28 |publisher=Acclaimed Music[/tpl] According to a list released by Time magazine in 2006, Horses is one of the All-Time 100 Greatest Albums and three years later, it was preserved by the Library of Congress into the National Recording Registry, calling it "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."
Smith has been called an early pioneer of punk rock. Allmusic's William Ruhlman said that it "isn't hard to make the case for Patti Smith as a punk rock progenitor based on Horses"[tpl]cite web |url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=r18299|pure_url=yes[/tpl] |title=Horses Review |accessdate=2008-02-28 |author=Ruhlmann, William |publisher=Allmusic[/tpl] while David Antrobus from PopMatters chose Horses as his favorite album and considered it a life-changing classic.[tpl]cite web |url=http://popmatters.com/music/reviews/s/smithpatti-horses.shtml |title=Got to lose control and then you take control |accessdate=2008-02-28 |author=Antrobus, David |publisher=PopMatters |date=2003-08-05[/tpl] Siouxsie and the Banshees have said that "Carcass",  one of the first songs from The Scream, was inspired by Horses.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thebansheesandothercreatures.co.uk/thescreampress.htm#melodymaker211078 |author=Birch,Ian |title=Scream and scream again|publisher=Melody Maker|date=21 October 1978 |accessdate=2010-04-17[/tpl] "Next is "Carcass", an everyday tale of a butcher falling in love with one of his hunks of meat.  The saga moves even closer to Warhol when the butcher in the ultimate act of true devotion, lopes off all his extraneous limbs so that he can nestle more comfortably beside his other beating heart.  "In love with your stumps, in love with the bleeding, in love with the pain that you once felt..."  It wasn't, as I'd half-imagined the result of a late night screening of Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Patti Smith's "Horses" was the original inspiration".Roma Interview with Siouxsie Sioux, November 1994. Excerpt : "Our song Carcass is the horse without the flesh".

The cover photo was taken by Robert Mapplethorpe using natural light in a penthouse in Greenwich Village.[tpl]cite book |title=100 Best Album Covers: The Stories Behind the Sleeves |last=Thorgerson |first= Storm |coauthors=Aubrey Powell |edition=1st American edition |date=November 1999 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=0-7894-4951-X |pages=74 |ref=http://books.google.com/books?id=71kBAAAACAAJ[/tpl] The triangle of light on the wall (too blurry to discern as a geometric figure on the above low resolution image) was the product of the afternoon sun. The record company wanted to make various changes to the photo, but Smith overruled such attempts.
Writer Camille Paglia described the album's cover as "one of the greatest pictures ever taken of a woman."Paglia, Camille (1992). Sex, Art and American Culture: New Essays, ISBN 978-0-679-74101-5. p. 45
N.B.: The jacket Smith has trapped around her shoulder actually has a horse pin.
