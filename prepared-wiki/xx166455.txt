The Royal Mail Steamer Dunottar Castle was a passenger and cargo liner that went into service with the Castle Line (and its successor, the Union-Castle Line) in 1890 on the passenger and mail service between Britain and South Africa.  In 1913 the ship was sold to the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company as the Caribbean.  After the outbreak of the First World War the ship served as HMS Caribbean, first as a troop carrier and then as an auxiliary cruiser, until she sank in a storm off the Scottish coast on 27 September 1915.

==Construction and Service==

The RMS Dunottar Castle was built at Govan Shipyards in 1889 by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company for the Castle Line, passing to the Union Castle Line in 1900. This steam ship became famous in the 1890s for reducing the voyage time from Southampton, England, to Cape Town, South Africa, from 42 days to 17 days and 20 hours.  In 1894 she grounded for two tides near the Eddystone Lighthouse. She had a refit in 1897 when the funnels were heightened, the yards were removed and she was given a wheelhouse.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.red-duster.co.uk/UNION12.htm |title=Castle Mail Packet Co| publisher=Red Duster (Merchant Navy Associatiion)| accessdate=14 November 2012[/tpl]

==Troop ship==

In November 1899, the Dunottar Castle was requisitioned as a troop ship during the Second Boer War. She carried General Redvers Buller and 1,500 troops to Cape Town for Boer War duties and on the following voyage carried Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener. During the war, she made frequent trips between England and the Cape Colony and carried some of the most famous Boer War warriors of the time, including two famous scouts, Major Frederick Russell Burnham and Col. Robert Baden-Powell, as well as a young war correspondent for the Morning Post by the name of Winston Churchill.
In 1904, the Dunottar Castle was laid up at Netley in Southampton Water, but by 1907 she was being chartered to the Panama Railroad Co. for their New York to Colon (Panama Canal) service. In 1908 she was chartered to Sir Henry Lunn Ltd for cruises to Norway and the Mediterranean, and in 1911 she took guests to the Delhi Durbar of King George V.
Union-Castle became part of the Royal Mail Group in 1912, and the Dunottar Castle was sold to the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company in 1913 as the Caribbean. In 1914, the HMS Caribbean was requisitioned for World War I, initially as a troopship to bring soldiers from Canada to Europe and later as an Armed Merchant Cruiser. But after it was found that she was unsuitable to carry gun mountings, she was converted into a dockyard workers accommodation ship on May 1915.

==Loss==

The Caribbean set sail for Scapa Flow on 24 September 1915, but foundered at noon on 26 September, about [tpl]convert|35|mi|km[/tpl] south of Cape Wrath, Scotland. Several ships were despatched to assist when her SOS message was received, but most were obliged to turn back due to the poor weather. However, some trawlers from Stornoway and the destroyer HMS Birkenhead managed to reach the scene. An attempt by the Birkenhead to place the Caribbean under tow failed, but most of the crew were rescued during the night.
The Caribbean sank early on 27 September, and the 15 crewmen still aboard lost their lives. The ensuing Court of Enquiry later blamed  the ship's carpenter for being insufficiently familiar with the ship and for failing to shut all the scuttles - like most of the crew, he had joined the ship just 10 days earlier.  The wreck was found in 2004, undisturbed except for fishing nets.[tpl]cite news| last=Robinson |first=Andrew|date=16 June 2004 |title=Yorkshire diver first to see wreck for nearly 90 years |journal=Yorkshire Post |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/around-yorkshire/local-stories/yorkshire-diver-first-to-see-wreck-for-nearly-90-years-1-2545421 |accessdate= 2007-08-06[/tpl]
