==Themes==

In Louis' works he highlights the conditions of reservation life and Native American cultural demise through their own doing as a result of interference by White people.  Louis writes about his own experiences to underscore the many problems that have plagued Indian country.  These issues include alcoholism, poverty, race relations, and social problems.  Louis writes about his own experience in his struggle with alcoholism as well as the people around him who have struggled with the disease.  He writes a number of poems about Native Americans getting drunk and contributing to the destruction of their own people.  In his poem "Another Indian Murder" Louis depicts a time when he witnessed two young, drunk Indians beating their friend with a baseball bat until he was dead.  When the two boys sobered up enough to realize they had killed their friend they tried using kleenex to stop the bleeding from his head.  He makes the point that the Native American people are destroying their society due to alcohol and notes how Native American culture and people have been negatively affected since the introduction of alcohol by the white man.
Louis explicitly makes his opinions about race relations and white people known.  Through his writing Louis harshly criticizes the United States' current foreign policy as he connects the first Iraq War to the slaughter of the Native American people.  In his poem "Red Blues In A White Town The Day We Bomb Iraqi Women And Children" Louis describes how the United States is bombing innocent people in Iraq.  He makes the point that they are still invading people's homelands and killing them today just as they did to the Native Americans in the past.  He also predicts that educated, white people will be dropping bombs on poor, innocent people for years to come.
