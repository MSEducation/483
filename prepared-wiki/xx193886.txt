Björn Linus Videll (born 5 May 1985 in Stockholm, Sweden) is a Swedish professional ice hockey player, currently playing with Severstal Cherepovets of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).

==Playing career==

Videll was drafted by the Colorado Avalanche in the seventh round of the 2003 NHL Entry Draft, 204th overall, after playing in the Swedish J20 SuperElit with AIK, Brynäs IF and Södertälje SK. Although his youth team is Djurgårdens IF Hockey, he left the Djurgården organization as a 13-year-old and instead joined the AIK organization.[tpl]cite web | url=http://hockey.expressen.se/elitserien/1.2499168/videll-om-klubbytet-aik-var-ett-latt-val | title=Videll om klubbytet: AIK var ett lätt val |work=Expressen | language=Swedish | date=14 July 2011 | accessdate=15 July 2011[/tpl]
From 2003 to 2011, Videll played primarily with Södertälje SK in the Elitserien (SEL).[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.sodertaljesk.se/0708nyheter.asp?NPK=3721#3721 | title = SSK extend and sign new players |work=Södertälje SK | date = 2 May 2010 | accessdate =2 May 2010 | language = Swedish[/tpl] In the 2010–11 season, Videll scored a career high 20 goals and 43 points, despite Södertälje being relegated to HockeyAllsvenskan after failing to re-qualify in the 2011 Kvalserien. To remain in the Elitserien for the following season, Videll signed a one-year contract to return to AIK for the 2011–12 season.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.aikhockey.se/Nyheter/Arkiv/2010/Triss-i-nyforvarv/ | title = New kind of acquisitions |work=AIK IF | date = 12 April 2011 | accessdate =12 April 2011 | language = Swedish[/tpl] He played 14 games with AIK, scoring 5 goals and 12 points and at that time placing sixth in the scoring league.
But after that, he was sold to Yugra Khanty-Mansiysk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) on 24 October 2011 for financial reasons. The main reason for this was that the Swedish Police Service decided, just one week earlier, that the police should earn money for their efforts during sports events held by joint-stock companies (JSC). This mainly affected the Stockholm clubs Djurgårdens IF as well as AIK. AIK received 3,5 million SEK for selling Videll to Khanty-Mansiysk. The selling of Videll to Khanty-Mansiysk was considered a major loss for AIK, although Videll had at that time been on Khanty-Mansiysk's radar for two years.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aikhockey.se/Nyheter/Arkiv/2010/AIK-saljer-Linus-Videll/ |title=AIK säljer Linus Videll |publisher=AIK IF |language=Swedish |date=24 October 2011 |accessdate=24 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/hockey/sverige/article13829802.ab |title=Det här luktar inte bra |work=Aftonbladet |author=Tomas Ros |language=Swedish |date=24 October 2011 |accessdate=24 October 2011[/tpl]
After an injury-plagued first season with Yugra, his second season did not fare better after producing 10 points in 31 games in 2012–13, Videll was released from his contract on December 29, 2012. On January 4, 2013, Videll opted to remain in the KHL and signed for the remainder of the campaign with Servestal Cherepovets.[tpl]citeweb| url = http://www.hockeysverige.se/article/13910271/linus-videll-stannar-i-khl | title = Linus Videll remains in KHL | publisher = hockeysverige.se | date = 2013-01-04 | accessdate = 2013-01-04 | language = Swedish[/tpl]
