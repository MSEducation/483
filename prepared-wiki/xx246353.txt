Ceylon Portuguese–Dutch Creole is an extinct or nearly extinct mixed Indo-Portuguese and Dutch-based creole language.[tpl]dubious|date=October 2013[/tpl] It was spoken on the island of Sri Lanka, which was a Dutch colony from 1658 to 1796.  It was based on Sri Lankan Portuguese Creole, which preceded it, and there may still be a few speakers in Wattala, a suburb of Colombo.  However, the majority of Dutch Burghers spoke Dutch, Portuguese, English, or Sri Lankan Portuguese Creole.Jorge Manuel Flores, 2007, Re-exploring the Links: History and Constructed Histories Between Portugal and Sri LankaJohn Holm, 1989, Pidgins and Creoles, vol. 2: Reference Survey''

==History==

When the Dutch arrived in Ceylon, Portuguese was a recognized language in the occupied areas of the island. It was however a Portuguese Creole due to its relationship with the native languages. When the Dutch language was introduced it also mingled with indigenous and Portuguese influences. Although this language is no longer spoken there are Dutch influences found in the Sinhalese and Tamil languages. There is also a portion of the Sri Lankan population with Dutch surnames, often people of mixed Dutch and Sri Lankan heritage, who are known as Burghers.
