The Mollo culture existed in Bolivia's altiplano area after the collapse of the Tiwanaku culture during the period of AD 1000 to 1500; it predated the Inca civilization.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zmvNogJO2ZgC&pg=PA309&lpg=PA309&dq=%22mollo+culture%22&source=web&ots=xvZ-tP4FiM&sig=GH6VAYaso0n007idiUMi7ilNKOw&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result |page=309 |title=A Dictionary of Archaeology |first=I. |last=Shaw |coauthors=Jameson, R. |year=2002 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=0-631-23583-3[/tpl]  While the Mollo showed a continuity with Late Tiwanaku culture in both domestic and village architecture, they left no pyramids.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~arch/saa/matrix/saa/saa_mod08.html |title=LATE INTERMEDIATE, CHIMU AND OTHER STATES: A.D. 900 – 1450 |last=Pyburn |first=Anne |date=2005-01-20 |publisher=Indiana University Bloomington[/tpl] Mollo worshiped the jaguar.

==Archaeology==

One of the best representations of the Mollo are the ruins northeast of Lake Titicaca at Iskanwaya, on the Cordillera Real, [tpl]convert|250|m|ft[/tpl] above the Rio Llica ([tpl]coord|15|21|S|68|32|W |region:BO_type:landmark |name=Iskanwaya[/tpl]).  Iskanwaya, in Muñecas Province, is [tpl]convert|325|km|mi[/tpl] from La Paz, Bolivia.[tpl]cite news |date=2007-02-14 |url=http://travelvideo.tv/news/more.php?id=A10760_0_1_0_M |title=Tourism this week in Latin America |publisher=travelvideo.tv[/tpl] Dated from 1145 to 1425, the city was built on platforms and was notable for its running water. More than one hundred buildings, streets and plazas still survive.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.climbingsouthamerica.com/cultural/iskanwaya.htm |title=Ruins of Iskanwaya  |publisher=climbingsouthamerica.com[/tpl] Mollo streets ran in east-west direction. Their houses were rectangular and grouped around patios.  Agriculture patterns included terracing and irrigation.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5lGWwZ4tboIC&pg=PA311&lpg=PA311&dq=%22mollo+culture%22&source=web&ots=4qDnnb0lTb&sig=0vMWljtTwQHKUfNXFBc7Ev_y1TI&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result |page=311 |title=Ancient South America |first=Karen Olsen |last=Bruhns |year=1994 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-27761-2[/tpl]
Other Mollo sites, such as Piniqo and Khargi, exhibit the same settlement characteristics as Iskanwaya, Wamán is an old agricultural establishment with the same terracing pattern.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.phfawcettsweb.org/trip2.htm |title=The route of 1911 from La Paz to Pelechuco and Apolo |publisher=phfawcettsweb.org[/tpl] The present-day village of Charazani includes Mollo archaeological sites, as well as the tomb of Ecuadorian singer Julio Jaramillo and the ruins of Mallku Janalaya.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bolivianmountains.com/trekking/apolobamba.html |title=Apolobamba |publisher=bolivianmountains.com[/tpl]

==Ethnography==

Kallawaya people, an itinerant group of healers, were of the Mollo culture.
The Mollo were defined by their ceramics. Shoe pots, grave pots, vases, and dipping vessels have been found and these are either plain or painted black and white on red clay. They created a unique drinking cup with a built-in straw.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ssnrARpeyWsC&pg=PA331&lpg=PA331&dq=%22mollo+culture%22&source=web&ots=z8a5XfAeHj&sig=4QlpCUTAYvUA6Aac1n7xPLf8RoE&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=5&ct=result |page=331 |title=Lost Cities and Ancient Mysteries of South America |first=David Hatcher |last=Childress |year=1986 |publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press |isbn=0-932813-02-X[/tpl] Some of these ceramics can be found today as far away as the Náprstek Museum in Prague.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.necep.net/papers/budapest/klapstova.pdf |page=6 |title=Non-European ethnographical collections in central and eastern Europe |first=Katerina |last=Klápstová |date=2004-03-26 |location=Budapest |publisher=The Czech National Museum[/tpl]
