Numéro is an international fashion magazine published by the Groupe Alain Ayache. It has a circulation of 80,000 and the French edition reached its 100th issue in February 2009.

==History==

Numéro was founded in 1998 by Elisabeth Djian, the previous fashion director of the obscure Jill magazine, who is now Numéro's editor-in-chief. When asked why she created Numéro, Djian commented, "I was bored with magazines that told me how to seduce a man. I wanted to create this magazine for an intelligent, smart woman who wants to read about art, design, music: not about stupidity – creams that take away wrinkles, you know, which is stupid."
