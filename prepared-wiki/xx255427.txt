P. |year=1974 |id2=nichols-george-robert-bob-4296 |title=Nichols, George Robert (Bob) (1809–1857) |accessdate= 10 July 2012[/tpl] a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council between 1848 and 1856.

==Early life==

Nichols was the second son of Issac Nichols, a former convict who became a successful Sydney entrepreneur. George Nichols was educated in England between 1819 and 1823. On returning to Australia he worked as an articled clerk until he was admitted as the first native-born Australian solicitor on 1 July 1833. During this period he was also an editor of William Wentworth's Australian newspaper. He was bankrupted in the financial crisis of 1842 but later returned to his legal practice. Nichols was a member of the Parramatta Regional Council, a trustee of Sydney Grammar School and a leading Freemason. Nichols founded the law firm Clayton Utz in February 1833.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.claytonutz.com/publications/news/200809/19/clayton_utz-celebrating_175_years_of_service.page |title=Clayton Utz - celebrating 175 years of service |date=19 September 2008 |accessdate= 10 July 2012 |publisher=Clayton Utz[/tpl]
Amongst the pupils articled to Nichols were James Martin (afterwards Premier and Chief Justice of New South Wales) and Richard Dry (afterwards Premier of Tasmania). Nichols was conceded the privilege, enjoyed by no other practitioner of his grade, of appearing professionally in both the superior and inferior courts of the colony.

==State Parliament==

In 1848, prior to the establishment of responsible self-government, Nichols was elected to the semi-elected unicameral Legislative Council. He represented the electorate of Northumberland Boroughs (including Morpeth, West Maitland and East Maitland) until the granting of responsible self-government in 1856. Subsequently, at the first election under the new constitution he was elected to the Legislative Assembly as one of the two members for Northumberland Boroughs and continued to represent the seat until his death from dropsy on 12 September 1857. Throughout his parliamentary career he was a strong supporter of Wentworth and William Bland.

==Government==

Nichols was New South Wales' inaugural Auditor General and Secretary for Lands for Works. He held these positions for 81 days in the government of Stuart Donaldson.
