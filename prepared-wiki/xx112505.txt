The Dead Has Arisen is the debut album released by rapper Lil' 1/2 Dead. It was released on October 25, 1994 for Priority Records and was mainly produced by Courtney Branch and Tracy Kendrick. The album was a mild success, peaking at No. 39 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and No. 17 on the Top Heatseekers chart.
The Dead Has Arisen has been both praised and criticized for its likeness to Half Dead's Long Beach friend Warren G's debut album 'Regulate ... G Funk Era'. Whilst it failed to achieve similar success to its predecessors Dre's 'The Chronic' and Snoop's 'Doggystyle', (and the album is not considered a landmark in West Coast rap), it did achieve local praise, and Lil' 1/2 Dead has been recognized as responsible for introducing and popularizing the smooth, laid-back rapping style along with Snoop Dogg and Warren G.
