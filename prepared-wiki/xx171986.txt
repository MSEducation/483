He was a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives, representing the 41st District which covers the cities of Troy and Clawson in Oakland County. He is the son of former U.S. Congressman Joe Knollenberg, who represented Michigan's 9th congressional district from 1993 until 2009.
Knollenberg was elected to the State House in 2006 and re-elected in 2008 and 2010.  He was term limited in 2012 and succeeded by Republican Martin Howrylak.  He had previously served as an Oakland County Commissioner from 2002 to 2004 and Oakland County Parks and Recreation commissioner from 2004 to 2006.

==Political career==

Knollenberg has served three terms in the Michigan State House. He pushed for legislation in 2011 that would prevent teachers from receiving pay increases while they negotiate their labor contracts.[tpl]cite news|title=Bill seeks halt to step increases for Michigan teachers|newspaper=Royal Oak Daily Tribune|date=February 23, 2011[/tpl] He was the chief sponsor of House Bill 4054, a controversial right-to-work law in Michigan.[tpl]cite news|title=Your Guide to Right-to-Work Bills, Lawmakers' Votes|url=http://troy.patch.com/articles/your-guide-to-right-to-work-bills-lawmakers-votes-5e592483|newspaper=Troy, MI Patch|date=December 10, 2012|author=Ellis, Leslie; Anesi Jen[/tpl]
During his tenure in the Michigan House, Knollenberg sat on the redistricting committee. Following his father's defeat in 2008 by Gary Peters, Knollenberg was expected to use his position to gerrymander the district. Political analyst Bill Ballenger said "I didn't think there's any question that he would love to seek revenge on behalf of his father if the circumstances are right — especially if it's against Peters."[tpl]cite news|last=Toeplitz|first=Shira|title=When Redistricting’s All in the Family|url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/56_136/State-redistricting-is-all-in-the-family-206308-1.html?zkPrintable=true|newspaper=Roll Call|date=June 9, 2011[/tpl]

==Elections==

===2004 election===

Knollenberg was a candidate for election in the 2004 Republican primary for the 41st District House seat, being vacated by term-limited representative John Pappageorge. He faced former-State Representative Bob Gosselin who was running for his final term after leaving office in 2002 to run for state Senate, and upstart candidate Mike Bosnic.[tpl]fact|date=August 2012[/tpl]
Bosnic was also a subject of Knollenberg's literature. He was accused by Knollenberg of accepting an illegal $2,500 contribution from the Heroes of Public Education, which was then a new PAC subject to a smaller campaign contribution limit. Campaign finance reports later revealed that the Secretary of State required Bosnic to repay $2,000 dollars of the donations because it exceeded campaign limits. http://www.mich.gov/sos/
Despite Pappageorge's endorsement of Knollenberg, the August primary was won by Gosselin with 38% of the vote, with Knollenberg garnering 29% and Bosnic 28%.[tpl]fact|date=August 2012[/tpl]
