==NFL career==

Langhorne was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the seventh round of the 1985 NFL Draft. He played the role of the slot receiver, splitting time with a stacked receiving corps of Webster Slaughter and Brian Brennan, and later Eric Metcalf. Langhorne had arguably his best season as a Brown in 1988, amassing 780 receiving yards and 7 touchdowns. He continued to amass decent numbers, and signed with the Colts in 1992. He made an immediate impact on the Colts, leading the team in receptions and receiving yards. During the 1993 season, he had the best year of his career, reaching 1,000 receiving yards for the first time to go along with 85 receptions. However, Langhorne was cut along with many other veterans after that season, or "all the guys making over a million."[tpl]cite web|url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1994/vp940901/09010710.htm|title=Catching Fish Beats Catching Footballs for Langhorne Now|accessdate=2007-01-18[/tpl] He had already prepared a letter of resignation anyway, stating that he needed a break from the game.
