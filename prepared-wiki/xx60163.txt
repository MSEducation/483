==Biography==

===Early life===

Richard Garriott was born in Cambridge, England to American parents,[tpl]Cite news |date=March 1986 |periodical=Computer Gaming World |title=Inside Ultima IV |pages=18–21 |url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20081227054521/http://cgw.vintagegaming.org/galleries/index.php?year=1986&pub=2&id=26 |postscript=[/tpl] and was raised in Nassau Bay, Texas, United States. He is the son of scientist Owen K. Garriott, who became an astronaut and flew with Skylab 3 and Space Shuttle mission STS-9.
What Garriott later described as "my first real exposure to computers" occurred in 1975, during his freshman year of high school at Clear Creek High School. As he wanted more experience beyond the single one-semester BASIC class the school offered, and as a fan of The Lord of the Rings and Dungeons & Dragons, Garriott convinced the school to let him create a self-directed course in programming, in which he created fantasy computer games on the school's teletype machine.Official Book of Ultima by Shay Addams, page 3-5[tpl]cite news | title=Lord British Kisses and Tells All / as told by His Royal Highness, High King of Britannia | work=Computer Gaming World | date=July 1988 | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1986&pub=2&id=26 | accessdate=3 November 2013 | author=Garriott, Richard | page=28[/tpl] Garriott later estimated that he wrote 28 computer fantasy games during high school.[tpl]r|CGW[/tpl]
In the summer of 1977, Garriott's parents sent him to the University of Oklahoma for a seven-week computer camp. Shortly after he arrived, some of the other boys attending the camp introduced themselves. When Garriott replied to their greeting of "Hi" with "Hello" they decided he sounded like he was from Britain, and gave him the nickname "British". Garriott uses the name to this day for his various gaming characters, including Ultima character Lord British and Tabula Rasa character General British;[tpl]cite book| last=King |first=Brad |coauthors=John Borland |title=Dungeons and Dreamers: The Rise of Computer Game Culture from Geek to Chic |pages=11–12 |publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-222888-1 |year=2003[/tpl] however, despite his nickname and birthplace, Garriott's parents moved to Texas when he was a baby and his accent is American rather than British.[tpl]cite news | last = BBC | first = News | title = BBC NEWS - Science/Nature - Private mission set for ISS | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7507052.stm | date = 2008-07-15 | accessdate = 2008-11-11 | work=BBC News[/tpl]

===Game design career===

In summer 1979, Garriott worked at a ComputerLand store where he had his first encounter with Apple computers. Inspired by their color graphics, he began to add perspective view to his own games. After creating Akalabeth for fun, the owner of the store convinced him it might sell.  He spent US$200 getting a manual and a cover sheet drawn by his mother printed out, and put them in Ziploc bags to sell around the store.  Although he sold less than a dozen copies at the store, one of them made it to California Pacific, who signed a deal with him. He sold over 30,000 copies, receiving $5 for each game sold.[tpl]r|garriott198807[/tpl]The Official Book of Ultima, page 8[tpl]cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-01-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_104_1989_Jan#page/n17/mode/2up | title=Dungeon Delving with Richard Garriott | work=Compute! | date=January 1989 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Ferrell, Keith | page=16[/tpl] In the fall, he entered the University of Texas at Austin, joined the school's fencing team and later joined the Society for Creative Anachronism.
Steve Jackson Games (SJG) maintained a good relationship with Garriott, and when he stopped by the SJG office one day, he ended up commissioning Denis Loubet to paint the cover of Ultima I (1980), and many other covers for Garriott's games thereafter.[tpl]Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7|page=104[/tpl]
In the early 1980s, Garriott developed the Ultima computer game series, eventually leaving the university to make the games his full-time job.[tpl]r|garriott198807[/tpl] Originally programmed for the Apple II, the first was published by California Pacific Computers and sold in Ziploc plastic bags to interested parties. The second part was published by Sierra On-Line, as they were the only company that agreed to publish it in a box together with a printed cloth map. By the time he developed his third installment, the games had such a large following that Garriott (along with his brother, Robert, amongst others) established Origin Systems, their own video game publisher to handle the publishing and distribution of his title, now available on several platforms.
Garriott sold Origin to Electronic Arts in September 1992.  In 1997, he coined the term massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), giving a new identity to the nascent genre previously known as graphical MUDs. In 1999 and 2000, EA canceled all of Origin's new development projects, including Privateer Online, and Harry Potter Online.[tpl]cite web | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/200/200049p1.html | title = IGN: Harry Potter LEGO Redux | author = Linder, Brian | date = 2001-05-10 | accessdate = 2007-04-28[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://wayback.archive.org/web/20071217225517/http://archive.gamespy.com/mmog/stratics/january02/stratics25/index2.shtm | title = When Kings Fall: Part II of II | author = Matonis, Misty | date = 2002-01-05 | accessdate = 2007-04-28[/tpl] In the midst of these events, Garriott resigned from the company and returned to the industry by forming Destination Games in April 2000 with his brother and Starr Long (the producer of Ultima Online). Once Garriott's non-compete agreement with EA expired a year later, Destination partnered with NCsoft where he acted as a producer and designer of MMORPGs. After that, he became the CEO of NCsoft Austin, also known as NC Interactive.
Tabula Rasa failed to be a commercial success despite its seven-year development period. On November 11, 2008, in an open letter on the Tabula Rasa website, Garriott announced his plans to leave NCsoft to pursue new interests sparked by his spaceflight experiences. Later, however, Garriott claimed that the letter was forged as a means of forcing him out of his position and that he had had no intention of leaving.http://cdn2.libsyn.com/gamepolitics/Garriott-NCsoft-complaint.pdf?nvb=20090509051652&nva=20090510052652&t=049ea4934066248c20f32[tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl] On November 24, NCsoft announced that it planned to end the live service of Tabula Rasa. The servers shut down on February 28, 2009, after a period of free play from January 10 onward for existing account holders.[tpl]cite web | url = http://wayback.archive.org/web/20081227034006/http://eu.rgtr.com/en/news_article/an_open_letter_from_general_british | title = Richard Garriott’s Tabula Rasa - An Open Letter from General British | author = Garriott, Richard | date = 2008-11-11 | accessdate = 2008-11-11[/tpl]
In July 2010, an Austin District Court awarded Garriott USD$28 million in his lawsuit against NCsoft, finding that the company did not appropriately handle his departure in 2008. In October 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgment.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.statesman.com/business/technology/appeals-court-upholds-garriotts-28-million-verdict-against-1933965.html |title=Appeals court upholds Garriott's $28 million verdict against NCsoft |author=Gaar, Brian |date=2011-10-25 |accessdate=2011-10-31 |publisher=Austin American-Statesman[/tpl]
Garriott founded the company Portalarium in 2009. The company is developing Shroud of the Avatar: Forsaken Virtues, a massively multiplayer spiritual successor to the Ultima series, with Garriott having remarked that had they been able to secure the rights to the Ultima intellectual property from Electronic Arts, the game could literally have became Ultima Online 2 in name."Garriott's Ultimate RPG 'clearly the spiritual successor' to Ultima" from Joystiq"Garriott's Ultimate RPG could become Ultima Online 2" from Eurogamer"LOGIN 2011 Keynote: Richard Garriott - The Next Big Games" from YouTube"Lord British shall walk the streets of Britannia again!

===Spaceflight===

The income from the success of Garriott's video game career allowed him to pursue his interest in spaceflight, and the sale of Origin Systems allowed him to invest in Space Adventures and purchase the ticket to become the first private citizen to fly into space. However, Garriott suffered financial setbacks in 2001 after the dot-com bubble burst, and he was forced to sell his seat to Dennis Tito.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hakSN70_VWk |title=The Moth and the World Science Festival Present Richard Garriott: The Overview Effect |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-12-15 |accessdate=2013-03-08[/tpl]
He then says he got back into making games, to make money, and once he had enough, put down a non-refundable deposit to go into space.  During the mandatory medical examination, they found he had a hemangioma on his liver, which could cause potentially fatal internal bleeding if there was a rapid depressurization of a spacecraft.  He was told he had to give up his large deposit, or undergo life threatening surgery, so he decided to have the operation, and now has a 16 inch scar from it.  He spent a year in Russia training before he launched into space.
On September 28, 2007, Space Adventures announced that Garriott would fly to the International Space Station in October 2008 as the sixth space tourist, reportedly paying $30 million USD.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spaceadventures.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=news.viewnews&newsid=554|title=Space Adventures Announces 1st Second Generation Astronaut |accessdate=October 12, 2008|publisher=Space Adventures, Ltd. |year=2008|author=Space Adventures, Ltd.

Richard's photographs, along with images taken by his astronaut father Owen Garriott in 1973, will be available to the public through Windows on Earth, adding a personal element to studies of Earth and how Earth has changed over time.
