Ding started playing snooker at the age of nine, when his father took him to the Chinese national team training centre near Shanghai.

In that final he played against then world no.-3-ranked Stephen Hendry, whom he beat by 9 frames to 5, to score his first ranking tournament win. 110 million people watched the final against Hendry on China's national sports channel CCTV-5 – by far the biggest TV audience ever recorded for a snooker match.Ding Junhui, a big noise in China China Daily, 22 January 2007
In December 2005, he beat another crop of world top-16 players, Jimmy White, Paul Hunter and Joe Perry, once more on his way to reaching the final of another major tournament, the UK Championship at the Barbican Centre in York. This time he met the resurgent snooker legend Steve Davis, and defeated him by ten frames to six, in doing so becoming the first player from outside Britain or Ireland to win that particular title. Following this victory, his world ranking was provisionally raised from 60 (62 at the start of the season) to 31. At the end of the season, he was ranked 27th.

This win pushed his provisional world ranking position up to fifth.
In December 2006, he won three gold medals at the Asian Games, winning the Single, Double and Team Snooker competitions. The following week, he reached, as the defending champion, the quarterfinal stage of the 2006 UK Snooker Championship,"Champion Ding defeated by Ebdon'" BBC Sport, 13 December 2006, last accessed 22 January 2007 and subsequently lost to his practice partner and eventual winner, Peter Ebdon, by 9 frames to 5.

On 14 January 2007, Ding made a 147 break in the opening match of the Saga Insurance Masters against Anthony Hamilton.'"Ding compiles maximum at Masters'" BBC Sport, 14 January 2007, last accessed 17 January 2007 It was the first maximum in the competition since that of Kirk Stevens in 1984, which was also the only one up to then. Additionally, Ding is the youngest player to make a 147 during a televised session (a record previously held by Ronnie O'Sullivan), and became the first Chinese snooker player in the history of BBC's coverage to make a televised maximum.
He went on to make the final of the tournament,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/sports/197044.htm|title=While Ding Falls, Chinese Snooker Rises| accessdate =15 April 2007|publisher=China Daily|year=2007[/tpl] becoming the second youngest player to reach a Masters final.
In it he made a confident start by winning the first two frames. However, O'Sullivan went on to produce what many regard as one of the finest displays of snooker ever seen on television. His dominance, along with the boisterous and hostile nature of the crowd, left Ding in tears during the twelfth frame, trailing 8–3 in the best of 19 frames contest. Ding appeared resigned to defeat, taking little time to consider his shot selection, and after the frame shook hands with O'Sullivan, after which the two walked arm in arm to the dressing room area, but because it had only been the last frame before the mid-session interval, and so indeed not the very last frame of the match, no-one knew if he had conceded the match, believed the match was over or was just congratulating O'Sullivan on his formidable play.
He ultimately lost the match on the next frame, and later said that he had indeed thought the match was a "best of 17".[tpl]Cite web|url=http://sport-news.org.ua/s_en/index.php?/archives/366-OSULLIVAN-PRAISES-PRODIGY-DING.html|title=O'Sullivan praises 'prodigy' Ding| accessdate =29 September 2007|publisher=Sport Revenue|year=2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]
