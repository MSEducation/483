===1982–88: Faith No More, early projects===

Love initially began several music projects in the 1980s, first forming Sugar Babydoll in Portland with friends Ursula Wehr and Robin Barbur. In 1982, Love attended a Faith No More concert in San Francisco, and "convinced" the members to let her join as a singer.[tpl]cite web|url=http://faithnomore.ipower.com/bio.shtml|title=Faith No More biography|work=FNM.com|accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl]Sutton, Michael and Torreano, Bradley.

The group recorded material with Love as a vocalist, but, according to Roddy Bottum, wanted a "male energy", and Love was subsequently kicked out of the band; she and Bottum, however, maintained a friendship in the years after. Love later formed the Pagan Babies with friend Kat Bjelland, whom she met at the Satyricon club in Portland in 1984: "The best thing that ever happened to me in a way, was Kat," Love said. Love asked Bjelland to start a band with her as a guitarist, and the two moved to San Francisco in June 1985, where they recruited Love's friend, bassist Jennifer Finch, and drummer Janis Tanaka. According to Bjelland, "Courtney didn't play an instrument at the time" aside from keyboards, so Bjelland would transpose Love's musical ideas on guitar for her. The group played several house shows and recorded one 4-track demo before disbanding in late 1985.Interview with Kat Bjelland. Edited by Liz Evans. Women, Sex and Rock'N'Roll: In Their Own Words.

===1989–96: Hole, critical success===

In 1989, Love taught herself to play guitar and relocated to Los Angeles, where she placed an ad in a local music zine, reading: "I want to start a band. My influences are Big Black, Sonic Youth, and Fleetwood Mac"Who Killed Kurt Cobain?: The Mysterious Death of an Icon (pg. 54) to which guitarist Eric Erlandson replied. Love recruited Erlandson as lead guitarist, Lisa Roberts, her neighbor, as bassist, and drummer Caroline Rue. Love named the band Hole after a line from Euripedes' Medea.[tpl]cite episode|series=Later... with Jools Holland|airdate=1995|title=Courtney Love and Hole|first=Courtney|last=Love|location=London, United Kingdom|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTOcqd7SSQ4[/tpl] Hole played their first show in November 1989 at Raji's after three months of rehearsal. The band's debut single, "Retard Girl", was issued in April 1990 through the Long Beach indie label Sympathy for the Record Industry, and was given air-time by Rodney Bingenheimer's local station, KROQ. The following year, the band released their second single, "Dicknail" through Sub Pop Records.
With Love influenced by no wave, noise rock and grindcore bands, Hole's first studio album, Pretty on the Inside, captured a particularly abrasive sound and contained disturbing lyrics, described by Q Magazine as "confrontational and genuinely uninhibited."Q Magazine Review: Pretty on the Inside by Hole. 1995–10. p. 138 The record was released in September 1991 on Caroline Records, produced by Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, with assistant production from Gumball's Don Fleming.

Love designed and distributed flyers promoting the shows, which included cutouts of women and young girls, as well as scattered lyrics and quotes from poems.
After the release of Pretty on the Inside, Love began dating Kurt Cobain and became pregnant, which temporarily put her music career on hold. During Love's pregnancy, Hole recorded a cover of "Over the Edge" for a Wipers tribute album, and recorded their fourth single, "Beautiful Son", which was released in April 1993. On September 8, 1993, Love and husband Kurt Cobain made their only public performance together at the Rock Against Rape benefit in Hollywood, California, performing two duets, both acoustic versions, of "Pennyroyal Tea" and "Where Did You Sleep Last Night".[tpl]cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1XjH458f108C&pg=PA46&dq=courtney+love+rock+against+rape&hl=en&sa=X&ei=kwiRUu6xLcf_igLJmoCYCg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=courtney%20love%20rock%20against%20rape&f=false|work=Spin|date=December 1993|page=46|title=The Ballad of Kurt and Courtney[/tpl] Love also performed electric versions of two of Hole's new songs, "Doll Parts" and "Miss World", both of which were written for the band's upcoming second release.
In October 1993, Hole recorded their second album, titled Live Through This, in Atlanta, Georgia. The album featured a new lineup, with bassist Kristen Pfaff and drummer Patty Schemel. Live Through This was released on Geffen's subsidiary DGC label in April 1994, four days after Love's husband, Cobain, was found dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound in their home. Two months later, in June 1994, bassist Kristen Pfaff died of a heroin overdose, and Love recruited Melissa Auf der Maur for the band's impending tour. Throughout the months preceding the tour, Love was rarely seen in public, spending time at her Seattle home, or visiting the Namgyal Buddhist Monastery in New York.

 During "Doll Parts", after moaning "He only loves those things because he loves to see me break" (instead of "them"), Love wobbled back from the mic almost punch-drunk. By this time, the band had bailed, and Love was alone singing, "Someday you will ache like I ache," again and again, her voice a faint sob. She finally stumbled over to a huge speaker and leaned into it like she was about to pass out. Then, while being led off by an assistant, she stepped back, pulled up her top, then flipped us off with both hands. 
In February 1995, Hole performed a well-reviewed acoustic set on MTV Unplugged at the Brooklyn Academy of Music,[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MdmBYULpTrAC&pg=PT77&dq=hole+mtv+unplugged&hl=en&sa=X&ei=l86XUqX5GaPfiALo4YHQCQ&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=hole%20mtv%20unplugged&f=false|title=This Is the Sound: The Best of Alternative Rock|author=Randi Reisfeld|pages=71–76|publisher=Simon Pulse|isbn=978-0-689-80670-4|date=1996-05-01[/tpl] and continued to tour late into the year, concluding their world tour with an appearance at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards, in which they performed "Violet", and were nominated for Best Music Video for "Doll Parts".

===1997–2000: Mainstream success===

After Love spent the majority of 1996 acting in films, which included a leading role in The People vs. Larry Flynt, Hole released a compilation album, My Body, The Hand Grenade as well as an EP titled The First Session which consisted of the band's earliest recordings. In September 1998, Hole released their third studio album, Celebrity Skin, which marked something of a transformation for Love, featuring a stark power pop sound as opposed to the group's earlier punk rock influences. Love divulged her ambition of making an album where "art meets commerce ... there are no compromises made, it has commercial appeal, and it sticks to the our original vision." She claimed to have been influenced by Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac, and My Bloody Valentine when writing the album.[tpl]cite AV media notes|title=The Interview|others=Hole|year=1998|type=CD|publisher=Geffen|id=PRO-CD-1232[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Hole: Celebrity Skin (songbook)|date=1999-03-01|publisher=Cherry Lane Music|isbn=978-1-57560-137-3[/tpl] Celebrity Skin was well received by critics; Rolling Stone called the album "accessible, fiery and intimate—often at the same time ... a basic guitar record that's anything but basic."[tpl]cite web|author=James Hunter |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/celebrity-skin-19980901|title=James Hunter reviews Celebrity Skin |work=Rolling Stone  |date=1998-09-01|accessdate=2010-02-10[/tpl] Celebrity Skin went on to go multi-platinum, and topped "Best of Year" lists at Spin, the Village Voice, and other periodicals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.celebrityhollywoodnews.com/erlandson-also-declared-that-patty/ |title=Erlandson also declared that Patty |publisher=Celebrity Hollywood News |date=2008-10-10|accessdate=2010-02-10[/tpl] The album garnered the band their only No. 1 hit single on the Modern Rock Tracks chart with the title track "Celebrity Skin". The band made various appearances promoting the album, including MTV performances and at the 1998 Billboard Music Awards. Hole toured with Marilyn Manson on the Beautiful Monsters Tour in 1999, but dropped out of the tour nine dates in after a dispute over production costs between Love and Manson; Hole resumed touring with Imperial Teen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430056/hole-walks-out-on-tour-manson-injury-postpones-several-dates.jhtml |title=Hole Walks Out On Tour, Manson Injury Postpones Several Dates |publisher=MTVNews.com |date=1999-03-15 |accessdate=2011-03-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430055/marilyn-manson-holes-departure-from-tour-not-personal-thing.jhtml |title=Marilyn Manson Says Hole's Departure From Tour "Not A Personal Thing" |publisher=MTVNews.com |date=1999-03-15 |accessdate=2011-03-07[/tpl]

After touring for Celebrity Skin finished, Auf der Maur left the band to tour with the Smashing Pumpkins; Hole's touring drummer Samantha Maloney left soon after. Love and Erlandson continued with the band, and released the single "Be A Man"— an outtake from the Celebrity Skin sessions— for the soundtrack of the Oliver Stone film Any Given Sunday (1999). The group became dormant in the following two years, and, in May 2002, officially announced their breakup amid continuing litigation with Universal Music Group over their record contract.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gnfF_10jpb8C&pg=PA6&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Doug Levy|page=6|title= CMJ New Music Report|date=2002-12-30[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7ctjc6UWCm4C&pg=PT507&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Rough Guide to Rock|author=Roy Edroso|page=500|publisher=Rough Guides|year= 2003[/tpl]

===2001–07: Solo career, America's Sweetheart===

With Hole in disarray, Love began a "punk rock femme supergroup" called Bastard during autumn 2001, enlisting Schemel, Veruca Salt co-frontwoman Louise Post, and bassist Gina Crosley. Though a demo was completed, the project never reached fruition.[tpl]cite web|last=Weston |first=Colin |url=http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/1018 |title=Sort The 'Bastard' Out |publisher=Drownedinsound.com |date=2001-05-04|accessdate=2010-02-10[/tpl]
In 2002, Love began composing an album with Linda Perry, titled America's Sweetheart, also reuniting with drummer Patty Schemel. Love signed with Virgin Records to release it, and initially recorded it in France, but was forced by the label to re-record the entire album in the summer of 2003. America's Sweetheart was released in February 2004, and was embraced by critics with mixed reviews. Spin called it a "jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994's Live Through This" and awarded it eight out of ten stars,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/courtney-love-americas-sweetheart-virgin|title=Courtney Love, America's Sweetheart Review|author=Charles Aaron[/tpl] while Rolling Stone suggested that, "for people who enjoy watching celebrities fall apart, America's Sweetheart should be more fun than an Osbournes marathon." The album sold 86,000 copies in its first three months, with the singles "Mono" and "Hold on to Me", both of which earned competent spots on album charts. Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record several times, calling it "a crap record" and reasoning that her drug issues at the time were to blame.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/hole/49737|work=NME |location=UK|title=Courtney Love blasts UK music scene and slags off 'America's Sweetheart' during Oxford Union speech|date=2010-02-13|accessdate=2011-01-23[/tpl] Shortly after the record was released, Love told Kurt Loder on TRL: "I cannot exist as a solo artist. It's a joke."Love, Courtney. Interview with Kurt Loder, 2004. Total Request Live on MTV
In 2006, Love started recording what was going to be her second solo album, How Dirty Girls Get Clean, collaborating again with Perry and Billy Corgan in the writing and recording. Love had written several songs, including an anti-cocaine song titled "Loser Dust", during her time in rehab in 2005.[tpl]cite web|author=Jolie Lash |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/courtneylove/articles/story/9232396/courtney_is_cleared_ready_to_rock |title=Courtney Is Cleared, Ready To Rock |work=Rolling Stone  |date=2006-02-03|accessdate=2010-02-10[/tpl] Love told Billboard: "My hand-eye coordination was so bad the drug use, I didn't even know chords anymore.

A rough acoustic version of "Never Go Hungry Again", recorded during an interview for The Times in November, was also released.

===2008–present: Nobody's Daughter, Hole reunion===

On June 17, 2009, NME reported that Hole would be reuniting. Former Hole guitarist Erlandson stated in Spin magazine that contractually no reunion can take place without his involvement; therefore Nobody's Daughter would remain Love's solo record, as opposed to a "Hole" record. Love responded to Erlandson's comments in a Twitter post, claiming "he's out of his mind, Hole is my band, my name, and my Trademark".CourtneyLoveUK (verified account) Twitter posting (2009-06-18). Nobody's Daughter was released worldwide as a Hole album on April 27, 2010. For the new line-up, Love recruited guitarist Micko Larkin, Shawn Dailey (bass guitar), and Stu Fisher (drums, percussion). Nobody's Daughter featured a great deal of material written and recorded for Love's aborted solo album, How Dirty Girls Get Clean, including "Pacific Coast Highway", "Letter to God", "Samantha", and "Never Go Hungry", although they were re-produced with Larkin. The first single from Nobody's Daughter was "Skinny Little Bitch", which became a hit on alternative rock radio in early March 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.courtney-love.org/skinny-little-bitch-most-added-song-on-alternative-radio|title=Skinny Little Bitch, most added song on alternative radio|date=2010-03-15|accessdate=2010-11-04|first=Mel|work=courtney-love.org[/tpl]
The album received mixed reviews. Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars, saying that Love "worked hard on these songs, instead of just babbling a bunch of druggy bullshit and assuming people would buy it, the way she did on her 2004 flop, America's Sweetheart."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/nobodys-daughter-20100426|author=Robert Sheffield|title=Nobody's Daughter by Hole|work=Rolling Stone|date=2010-04-26|accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl] Slant Magazine also gave the album three out of five stars, saying "It's Marianne Faithfull's substance-ravaged voice that comes to mind most often while listening to songs like "Honey" and "For Once in Your Life." The latter track is, in fact, one of Love's most raw and vulnerable vocal performances to date. Co-penned by Linda Perry, the song offers a rare glimpse into the mind of a woman who, for the last 15 years, has been as famous for being a rock star as she's been for being a victim."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/hole-nobodys-daughter/2083|work=Slant|date=2010-04-21|accessdate=2013-06-25|author=Sal Cinquemani|title=Hole: Nobody's Daughter[/tpl] The album's subject matter was largely centered on Love's tumultuous life between 2003 and 2007, and featured a polished folk-rock sound with much more acoustic work than previous Hole albums.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2010/jun/12/nobodys-daughter/|work=San Diego Reader|title=Nobody's Daughter|author=Michael Caldwell|date=2010-06-12|accessdate=2013-11-16|quote=Despite the heaviness in Beinhorn and Hole's respective pasts, most of the tracks here are singer-songwriterly, where acoustics provide the backbone.

However, in an April 2014 interview with BBC, Love revealed that she and former Hole guitarist Eric Erlandson had reconciled, and had been rehearsing new material together, along with former bassist Melissa Auf der Maur and drummer Patty Schemel, though did not confirm a reunion of the band.
On April 22, 2014, Love debuted the song "You Know My Name" on BBC Radio 6 to promote her tour of the United Kingdom.

On May 1, 2014, in an interview with Pitchfork, Love commented further on the possibility of Hole reuniting, saying: 
 I'm not going to commit to it happening, because we want an element of surprise. There's a lot of i's to be dotted and t's to be crossed. It's next year's concern, but we've hung out, we've sat down, we've met, we've jammed. There's some caveats, there's some things people need. We're older—we're all mainlining vegan food, you know what I mean? Nobody smokes other than me. No one's on drugs ... the reason it's not happening this year is because I was too late to come to the conclusion that it should be done, and to find the manager we all agree on. To make it have some ass-kicking. No one's been dormant. Patty teaches drumming and drums in three indie bands. Melissa has her metal-nerd thing going on—her dream is to play Castle Donington with Dokken. Eric hasn't flipped—I jammed with him, he's still doing his Thurston Moore-crazy tunings, still corresponding with Kevin Shields. We all get along great.[tpl]citeweb|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9395-courtney-love/|work=Pitchfork|title=Interviews: Courtney Love|author=Pelly, Jenn|date=2014-05-01|accessdate=2014-05-02[/tpl]
 
==Musicianship==

===Influences and style===

Love was exposed to the music of Patti Smith and the Pretenders in juvenile hall, which she was greatly influenced by: "You had these two iconic women, and I realized that you could do something that was completely subversive that didn't involve violence or felonies," said Love. "I stopped making trouble. I stopped." As a teenager, Love named Flipper, Kate Bush, Soft Cell, Lou Reed, and Dead Kennedys among her favorite artists. Most prominently, Love was influenced by a multitude of new wave and post-punk bands, such as Echo and the Bunnymen, The Smiths,[tpl]cite interview |last=Love|first=Courtney|interviewer=Loder, Kurt|program=MTV Networks|title=The Hole Story|date=1994-09-01[/tpl] The Teardrop Explodes, Bauhaus, and Joy Division.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.egigs.co.uk/index.php?a=13490|work=EGigs|title=Hole/Little Fish – Brixton Academy|author=Craig Jones|date=2010-05-10[/tpl]Doll Parts single. 1995 DGC/Geffen Records.

Conversely, Love also embraced the influence of experimental and punk rock groups, including Sonic Youth, Swans,[tpl]cite journal|work=Addicted To Noise|date=1997-01-06|title=Swans Song|author= Howard Wuelfing|quote=The group count the likes of Metallica's Kirk Hammet, Henry Rollins, Courtney Love and even Jeff Buckley among its admirers.[/tpl] Big Black, The Germs, and The Stooges.[tpl]cite interview |last= Stern |first= Howard |interviewer= Courtney Love |title= The Howard Stern Show |callsign= Sirius XM Radio |city= New York |date= 2013-05-30 |accessdate=2013-07-10|quote=The Stooges were a really big deal to me[/tpl] Love has also expressed great admiration for Fleetwood Mac, with Hole covering their track "Gold Dust Woman" in 1996, as well as using sampling from "Rhiannon" on their noise track "Starbelly" from Pretty on the Inside.
Musically, it was remarked in an October 1991 review of her first album that Love's layering of harsh and abrasive riffs buried more sophisticated musical arrangements.[tpl]cite news|work=Spin|date=October 1991|title=Hole Lotta Love|page=32|author=Daisy Von Furth[/tpl] Hole's incorporation of both punk rock and power pop sounds illustrates the band's often divergent musical style, which drew influence from alternating genres. In 1998, Love stated that Hole had "always been a pop band. We always had a subtext of pop. I always talked about it, if you go back ... what'll sound like some weird Sonic Youth tuning back then to you was sounding like the Raspberries to me, in my demented pop framework."

Common themes present in Love's songs during her early career included body image, rape, suicide, misogyny, conformity, elitism, pregnancy, prostitution, and death. In a 1991 interview with Everett True, Love said: "I try to place imagery next to fucked up imagery, because that's how I view things ...

===Equipment and gear===

Love has frequently played a multitude of Fender guitars, including a Jaguar and a vintage 1965 Jazzmaster, the latter of which was purchased by the Hard Rock Cafe and is on display in New York City. Love is seen playing her Jazzmaster in the music video for "Miss World". Earlier in Hole's career, between 1989 and 1991, Love primarily played a Rickenbacker 425 because she "preferred the 3/4 neck", but she destroyed the guitar onstage at a 1991 concert opening for The Smashing Pumpkins.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-12-19/entertainment/ca-712_1_pumpkins-album|title=POP MUSIC REVIEWS: Pumpkins, Hole Unleash Frustrations|date=1991-12-19|author=Cromelin, Richard|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2013-11-26[/tpl] She also often played a guitar made by Mercury, an obscure company that manufactured custom guitars, which she purchased in 1992. Fender's Vista Venus, designed by Love in 1998, was partially inspired by Rickenbacker guitars as well as her Mercury. Love's setup has included Fender tube gear, Matchless, Ampeg, Silvertone and a solid-state 1976 Randall Commander. During her 2010 and more recent tours, Love has played a Rickenbacker 360 onstage.

As a result of Love's high-profile marriage to Kurt Cobain, comparisons have been made of her to Yoko Ono. Shortly following their marriage, and particularly after Cobain's suicide, she was often negatively compared to John Lennon's widow Ono by Cobain's fans. This media comparison was addressed by Love in 1992, prior to Cobain's death, in the song "20 Years in the Dakota", which she explicitly wrote about Ono.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/ask-courtney-love|work=Clash Music|title=Ask Courtney Love|date=2010-02-23|accessdate=2013-11-10|quote=I've never had an encounter with Ms. Ono Lennon. I did write a song about her called '20 Years In The Dakota'. Yes, she's right. I don't know what to say. Wow. I can tell you this: I'd just had Frances and Kurt came into the hospital with a Yoko Ono boxset and I threw it at his head. I was so offended by it, because of what it meant. He thought that was cool, I did not at the time. He loved Yoko Ono and he loved her work. Then I got round to listening to it and I thought she was quite brilliant. Bizarre but brilliant. She sticks with her own thing. Why was I offended? Because she got so much shit – I wrote in the song: "You don't fuck with the fabulous four, or you spend the rest of your life picking things up off the floor".[/tpl] Love again commented on the comparison in a 1993 interview with NME, which drew several parallels to her public image in relationship to Cobain's, saying:  People hate her Ono, they really do. Did you know that to 'Yoko someone' is a verb in America? It is something that boys say if they're hanging out with you too much and they're going to school or they have a band. It's almost a myth that's used to suppress women. Y'know, 'You're gonna Yoko me. You're gonna destroy me.' And this woman put up with racial inequality from Fleet Street, she put up with being accused of breaking up the best band in the world Beatles, she put up with people's idea that she castrated this man and then, worst of all, she had her best friend, her husband, the person she lived for, die in her arms in front of a fortress that she'd hidden herself in for twenty years. And I just feel that the world media should apologize to her because she handled it with so much dignity.[tpl]cite news|work=NME|date=1993-04-17|people=Love, Courtney|title=Love resurrection|author=Sutherland, Steve[/tpl]

It's 1997, and respecting each other's sexuality is about the coolest thing I can think of.[/tpl] Love is a self-identified feminist,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2006/11/06/courtney_scrapbook/print.html|work=Salon|title=The people vs. Courtney Love|author=Lisa Levy|date=2006-11-06|accessdate=2011-01-10[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|title=Third Wave Agenda: Being Feminist, Doing Feminism|author=Leslie Heywood; Jennifer Drake|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn= 0-8166-3005-4[/tpl] and has been noted throughout her career for her subversive feminism and "self-conscious parody of female sex roles".
Love has struggled with substance abuse problems for a great deal of her life. She experimented with numerous opiates in her early adult years, and tried cocaine at age 19. She became addicted to heroin in the early 1990s, but quit in 1996 at the insistence of director Miloš Forman when she landed a leading role in The People vs. Larry Flynt. Love was ordered to take multiple urine tests under the supervision of Columbia Pictures while filming the movie, and passed all of them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefix.com/content/courtney-love-interview?page=all|work=The Fix|title=Courtney Love Comes Clean|date=2011-05-22|accessdate=2013-05-31|author= Maer Roshan[/tpl] On July 9, 2004, Love's 40th birthday, she attempted to commit suicide at her Manhattan apartment,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thefix.com/content/courtney-intro?page=3|work=The Fix|title=The Courtney Love Chronicles (Part 2)|author=Maer Roshan|date= 2011-05-24|accessdate=2013-09-25[/tpl] and was taken to Bellevue Hospital, allegedly incoherent, and put on a 72-hour watch.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,663753,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=2004-07-14|accessdate=2013-05-31|title=Live Through This|author=Gary Susman[/tpl] According to police, she was believed to be a potential "danger to herself", but was deemed mentally sound and released to a rehab facility two days later.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gothamist.com/2004/07/10/courtney_love_finally_goes_to_bellevue.php|work=The Gothamist|title=Courtney Love Finally Goes to Bellevue|author=Jen Chung|date=2004-07-10|accessdate=2013-05-31[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Nothing-stops-Courtney-Love-she-s-been-2686581.php|work=San Francisco Gate|title=Nothing stops Courtney Love – she's been arrested, hauled off to Bellevue, but she hasn't quit speaking her mind|author=Neva Chonin|date=2004-10-25|accessdate=2013-05-31[/tpl] In 2005 and 2006, after making several public appearances clearly intoxicated (namely on the Late Show with David Letterman and the Comedy Central Roast of Pamela Anderson)[tpl]cite episode|network=VH1|series=VH1's 100 Most Shocking Moments|title=Most Shocking Music Moments|airdate=2009-12-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1637966/courtney-love-recalls-hazy-letterman-years-on-late-show.jhtml|publisher=MTV|title=Courtney Love Recalls Hazy "Letterman Years"|date=2010-04-28|author= Gil Kaufman|accessdate=2011-03-01[/tpl] and suffering drug-related arrests and probation violations,[tpl]cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/4553516|title=Courtney Love Arrested in New York|work=MSNBC|date=2004-03-25|accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3523406.stm |title=Rock star Love arrested after gig |publisher=BBC News  |date=2004-03-18|accessdate=2010-02-10[/tpl] Love was sentenced to six months in lock down rehab due to struggles with prescription drugs and cocaine.[tpl]cite web|last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1485823/20040318/love_courtney.jhtml |title=Courtney Love Arrested After Allegedly Striking Fan With Mic Stand |work=Mtv |date=2004-03-18|accessdate=2010-02-10[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2010/04/28/courtney-love-letterman/|publisher=MTV|title=Courtney Love Says 'Letterman Years' Were Caused By Cocaine|date=2010-04-28|accessdate=2011-12-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1479936/courtney-lovetrades-blows-with-kurt-cobains-mom.jhtml|publisher=MTV|title=Courtney Love Trades Blows With Kurt Cobain's Mom, Admits to Oxycontin OD|author= Gil Kaufman|date=2003-10-24|accessdate=2011-05-25[/tpl] She has stated she has been sober since 2007, and in May 2011, confirmed her sobriety.[tpl]cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/43174163/|title=Courtney Love: Stop calling me a 'drug freak'|date=2013-06-25|work=US Weekly/MSNBC|accessdate=2011-05-25[/tpl]

===Family and relationships===

Love has publicly acknowledged her estrangement from her parents, Linda Carroll and Hank Harrison, as well as her maternal grandmother, Paula Fox, who gave up Love's mother Linda for adoption after having her out of wedlock. According to Love, she has not been in contact with her father since age fifteen, and has "never forgiven" her mother over the way she was raised; she has, however, maintained relationships with her half-siblings.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/features/2011/11/courtney-love-201111|work=Vanity Fair|title=Love in a Cold Climate|date=November 2011|author=Nancy Jo Sales|accessdate=2013-12-01[/tpl][tpl]cite episode|series=Late Show with David Letterman|date=2004-03-17|network=CBS|title=Interview with Courtney Love[/tpl]

Her most documented romantic relationship was with Kurt Cobain. It is uncertain when they first met; according to Love, she first met Cobain at a Dharma Bums show in Portland where she was doing a spoken word performance,[tpl]cite episode|network=Fuse|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgqt0ofwE3g|series=On The Record|title=Courtney Love|date=2010-05-10|accessdate=2012-08-13[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=How they met: fateful encounters of famous lovebirds, rivals, partners in crime|author= Joey Green|pages=69–70|publisher=Black Dog Publishing[/tpl] According to Michael Azerrad, the two met at the Satyricon nightclub in Portland in 1989, though Cobain biographer Charles Cross stated the date was actually February 12, 1990, and that Cobain playfully wrestled Love to the floor after she commented to him in passing that he looked like Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rNNC1BXi_XwC&pg=PT72&lpg=PT72&dq=rough+guide+courtney+love&source=bl&ots=9W6IfQIjnE&sig=tBeX6G_m_-gb83dSHEnEZxB90D4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=PxV_UoL7OKmZiAK12YH4Cw&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=rough%20guide%20courtney%20love&f=false|title=The Rough Guide to Nirvana|author= Gillian G.

The two later became reacquainted through Jennifer Finch, one of Love's longtime friends and former bandmates. Love and Cobain officially began dating in the fall of 1991 during Hole's Pretty on the Inside tours, and were married on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, Hawaii, on February 24, 1992. Love wore a satin and lace dress once owned by actress Frances Farmer, and Cobain wore green pajamas. Six months later, on August 18, the couple's only child, a daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, was born. In April 1994, Cobain committed suicide in their Seattle home while Love was in rehab in Los Angeles. During their marriage, and after Cobain's death, Love became something of a hate-figure among some of Cobain's fans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/dec/11/biography.popandrock|work=The Guardian|title=Love me do|author= Laura Barton|date=2006-12-10|accessdate=2013-11-03[/tpl] After his cremation, Love divided portions of Cobain's ashes, some of which she kept in a teddy bear and in an urn.[tpl]cite news|title=Kurt Cobain's Final Tour|work=Esquire|date=February 1996|author=Dickinson, Amy[/tpl] Another portion of his ashes was taken by Love to the Namgyal Buddhist Monastery in Ithaca, New York in 1994, where they were ceremonially blessed by Buddhist monks and mixed into clay which was made into memorial sculptures.

==Charitable work==

In 1993, Love and husband Kurt Cobain performed an acoustic set together at the Rock Against Rape benefit in Los Angeles, California, which raised awareness and provided resources for victims of sexual abuse. Love has also contributed to amfAR's AIDS research benefits and held live musical performances at their events.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amfar.org/in-the-spotlight/press-releases/sharon-stone,-kylie-minogue,-dita-von-teese,-courtney-love,-kenneth-cole,-and-kevin-huvane-join-for-amfar-inspiration-gala-in-los-angeles/|work=amfAR|title=Sharon Stone, Kylie Minogue, Dita von Teese, Courtney Love, Kenneth Cole, and Kevin Huvane Join For amfAR Inspiration Gala in Los Angeles|date=2010-10-28|accessdate=2013-12-21[/tpl] In 2009, Love performed a benefit concert for the RED Campaign at Carnegie Hall alongside Laurie Anderson, Rufus Wainright, and Scarlett Johansson, with proceeds going to AIDS research.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267389/u2-scarlett-johannson-courtney-love-set-for-aids-charity-concert|work=Billboard|date=2009-09-15|accessdate=2013-12-21|title=U2, Scarlett Johansson, Courtney Love Set For AIDS Charity Concert|author=Michael D.

Love has also worked with LGBT and LGBT youth charities; specifically with the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, where she has taken part in performances at the center's "An Evening with Women", where she headlined the event's debut in 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/26/courtney-love-gay-fans_n_3817210.html|work=Huffington Post|title=Courtney Love Discusses Gay Fans In 'Vanity Fair' Article|author=Christopher Rudolph|date=2013-08-26|accessdate=2013-12-21[/tpl] The proceeds of the event help provide food and shelter for homeless youth; services for seniors; legal assistance; domestic violence services; health and mental health services, and cultural arts programs. Love participated with Linda Perry for the event again in 2012, relating her experiences as a nomadic teenager and having to live on the street:  This really resonates with me, because I was a kid from Oregon, and I came to Hollywood like a lot of people do, and you know, what happens is that we end up on the street... and if you're gay, or lesbian, or transgendered— the more "outside" you are, the more screwed you are in a lot of ways. I stripped. Everybody knows that. ... My point is that I survived it and thrived through it, but I only did it because I had great friends. These kids from Iowa, they aren't so lucky. Seven thousand kids in Los Angeles a year go out on the street, and forty percent of those kids are gay, lesbian, or transgendered. They come out to their parents, and become homeless. charity helps them get sent to the right foster care, they can get medical help, food, clothing... and for whatever reason, I don't really know why, but gay men have a lot of foundations, I've played many of them— but the lesbian side of it doesn't have as much money and/or donors, so we're excited that this has grown to cover women and women's affairs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/courtney-love-linda-perry-team-up-for-gay-rights-20120514|work=Rolling Stone|author=Steve Balkin|title=Courtney Love, Linda Perry Team Up for Gay Rights|date=2012-05-14|accessdate=2013-12-21[/tpl]
