AG013, ActoGeniX´s lead ActoBiotic™ for the treatment of oral mucositis in cancer patients has been evaluated in a phase 1B clinical trial in the US, confirming safety and tolerability as well as initial efficacy. Analysis of initial efficacy showed a 35% reduction of the percentage of days with ulcerative oral mucositis in the AG013-treated patients versus the placebo-treated patients. Close to 30% of the patients treated with AG013 were full responders while all placebo-treated patients developed ulcerative oral mucositis.http://www.actogenix.com/eng/documents/news/pressreleases/ActoGeniX%20Press%20Release%20ENG%2015%20Sept%202011.pdf 
In preclinical models, ActoGeniX has confirmed the applicability of ActoBiotics™ for diseases including gastrointestinal, metabolic, immune diseases and allergies.
ActoGeniX was founded in 2006 as a spin-off from VIB and Ghent University. The Company is headquartered in Ghent (Belgium) and employs approximately 20 employees, half of whom are PhD’s, MD’s, or PharmD’s. ActoGeniX raised 35.5 million Euro (approximately 50 million US$) in two equity financing rounds from a consortium of leading life sciences investors such as GIMV, Biotech Fund Flanders, Baekeland Fund, Biovest (Belgium), Life Sciences Partners, Aescap Venture (The Netherlands) and Ventech (France).
ActoGeniX has a broad intellectual property position with a patent estate encompassing more than 20 distinct patent families. 
In April 2012, Prof. Chantal Mathieu and her team at the University Hospital of Leuven announced a major breakthrough in the treatment of Type 1 diabetes with an ActoBiotic™.http://www.kuleuven.be/english/news/a-permanent-cure-for-type-1-diabetes The ActoBiotic™ can stably reinstate normal glucose levels in Type 1 diabetic mice. This strategy was without side effects and can now be further developed for human application. The results of the study have been published in the authoritative Journal of Clinical Investigation.http://www.jci.org/articles/view/60530
