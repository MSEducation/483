==Name==

The rova part in the name Rovaniemi has often been considered to be of Saamic origin, as "[tpl]lang|se|roavve[/tpl]" in Saami denotes a forested ridge or hill or the site of an old forest fire. In Southern Saami dialects, however, [tpl]lang|sma|rova[/tpl] means a heap of stones, a rock or a group of rocks in a stretch of rapids, or even a sauna stove. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl] The niemi part of the name means "cape".

==History==

There has probably been continuous settlement in the Rovaniemi area since the Stone Age. [tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] Periodic clearance of new land for agriculture and the practice of slash-and-burn cultivation began around 750–530 B.C. Artifacts found in the area suggest that an increasing number of travelers from Karelia in the east, Häme in the south and the Arctic Ocean coast in the north must have come there from 500 A.D. onwards. The Sami are considered to be Lapland's own indigenous population. [tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
It is first mentioned by name in official documents in 1453, existing effectively as a set of small villages whose inhabitants earned their living mainly in agriculture and animal husbandry - with fishing and hunting the most important offshoots. [tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
The exploitation of Lapland's natural resources in the 1800s boosted Rovaniemi's growth. Extensive logging sites and gold fever attracted thousands of people to Lapland. As the mining of natural resources was increased, Rovaniemi became the business center of the province of Lapland.
During the Second World War, Finland signed the Moscow Armistice and found itself involved in the Lapland War with its former German ally. Retreating German forces utilized scorched earth tactics, and though initially German General Lothar Rendulic ordered only the public buildings in Rovaniemi to be destroyed, on 13 October 1944 the German army received orders to destroy all the buildings in Rovaniemi, only excluding hospitals and houses where inhabitants were present.Suomen Kuvalehti 39/2004 [tpl]circular|date=February 2013[/tpl]While the German rear guard was going about the destruction, an ammunition train in Rovaniemi station exploded and set fire to the wooden houses of the town. The German troops suffered many casualties, mainly from glass splinters. A Finnish commando unit claimed to have blown up the ammunition train and may well have been the primary cause of the town's ruin. The cause was then unknown and generally assumed to be the deliberate intent of Rendulic.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothar_Rendulic During these hostilities 90% of all the buildings in Rovaniemi were destroyed.Kallioniemi 1989, s. 196–209 There is a German cemetery 19k from Rovaniemi where soldiers killed fighting in Lapland during the war are entombed.
