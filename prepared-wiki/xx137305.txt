Time to Burn is the second studio album by Giant, released in 1992.
Vocalist/guitarist Dann Huff had proven his guitar-playing chops as a studio musician on hit albums and singles across the popular music spectrum throughout the 1980s before starting a band with brother David on drums, Mike Brignardello on bass and Alan Pasqua on keyboards and scoring a hit of their own with "I'll See You In My Dreams" in 1989-1990. For the follow-up the band was joined in the writing process on two songs by Jim Vallance and on four by Van Stephenson, the latter of whom also guested on background vocals in the studio. Huff had previously done guitar work on Stephenson's solo albums.  It was produced by Terry Thomas, a former member of the band Charlie who had previously produced albums for such rock notables as Bad Company and Foreigner.
Although well-reviewed, Time to Burn was among the last of its commercial AOR/melodic hard rock genre to be released by a major label — and not the label of their previous album — as record companies and media outlets stopped promoting '80s artists in favor of newer grunge styles. The album's most successful single was "Chained", which peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, although second single "Stay" received some airplay as well.
