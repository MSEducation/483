==Controversy==

In 2007, Rubinstein described Israel as an "apartheid state" at the UN-sponsored International Conference of Civil Society in Support of Israeli-Palestinian Peace. In response, the Zionist Federation of Great Britain cancelled his scheduled appearance at an event sponsored by the Federation. Its chairman, Andrew Balcombe said: "Criticism of Israeli policy is acceptable. However, by using the word 'apartheid' in a UN conference held at the European Parliament, Danny Rubinstein encourages the demonization of Israel and the Jewish people."[tpl]cite web|last=Lappin|first=Yaakov|title=Zionist Federation cancels Haaretz journalist|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3444320,00.html|publisher=Ynetnews.com|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=31 August 2007[/tpl] At an event sponsored by the New Israel Fund, Rubinstein was not apologetic:  "People do use the word 'apartheid' in my circles.
