==Collingwood Football Club==

On 29 October 1998, McGuire was elected by the vote of the members as president of Collingwood Football Club, an Australian Rules Football club which was then in financial and on-field difficulties.[tpl]cn|date=September 2013[/tpl] Results on the field were slow in coming, with Collingwood finishing 16th, the last position ("wooden spoon"), in his first year in charge. In 2002 and 2003 they played in successive losing grand-finals against the Brisbane Lions.
2010 brought "tears of joy" for McGuire when Collingwood defeated St Kilda in the AFL Grand Final replay.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-sport/mcguire-weeps-tears-of-joy-as-pies-win-20101002-161zo.html|title=McGuire weeps tears of joy as Pies win|last=Woods|first=Melissa|date=2 October 2010|publisher=The Age|accessdate=3 October 2010|location=Melbourne[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/pies-dominate-saints-to-win-grand-final-replay-by-56-points/story-e6frexni-1225933206226|title=Pies dominate Saints to win Grand Final replay by 56 points|last=Ballantyne|first=Adrian|date=3 October 2010|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=3 October 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/mick-malthouse-fixed-to-take-a-double/story-e6frf9jf-1225933338874|title=Mick Malthouse fixed to take a double|last=Sheahan|first=Mike|date=3 October 2010|publisher=Herald Sun|accessdate=3 October 2010[/tpl] The first match resulted in a draw, prompting McGuire to say before the replay that "he had seen more drawn Collingwood Grand Finals (1977 and 2010) than he had seen premierships".

==Football media==

Despite Tim Lane's resignation, Friday Night Football proved a huge success for Channel Nine,[tpl]cn|date=September 2013[/tpl] in no small part due to the presence of, in his own words, "the biggest name on the Nine Network", McGuire himself.  McGuire also claimed that a decline in ratings for Friday night telecasts in 2006 was partly because "I didn't do football this year."

==CEO of the Nine Network==

On 9 February 2006 it was announced that McGuire would become the new CEO of the Nine Network,[tpl]cite news|first=Jesse|last=Hogan|title=McGuire CEO show live on air|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/mcguire-ceo-show-rolls-on/2006/02/09/1139379610820.html|publisher=The Age|date=9 February 2006|accessdate=12 April 2007 | location=Melbourne[/tpl] filling a vacancy created by the departure of David Gyngell in May 2005.[tpl]cite news|title=Gyngell resigns from Nine|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Business/Gyngell-resigns-from-Nine/2005/05/09/1115584894573.html|work=APP|publisher=The Age|date=9 May 2005|accessdate=12 April 2007 | location=Melbourne[/tpl] McGuire had to sacrifice his on-air commitments including hosting The AFL Footy Show and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, as well as AFL commentary, for what turned out to be a very short term tenure.
According to Business Review Weekly McGuire's on-air salary was $3.5 million a year. Gyngell had earned $1.1 million a year by comparison. According to the 2006 PBL annual report, McGuire is reported to be on a $4 million fixed remuneration contract.[tpl]cite web|title=Publishing and Broadcasting Limited Concise Annual Report 2006|url=http://pbl.republicast.com/ar2006/republicast.asp?page=76&layout=1&control=yes&zoom=100|publisher=Publishing and Broadcasting Limited|page=76|accessdate=12 April 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928042223/http://pbl.republicast.com/ar2006/republicast.asp?page=76&layout=1&control=yes&zoom=100  |archivedate = 28 September 2007[/tpl]
In May 2006, McGuire travelled to Beaconsfield, Tasmania to rally Nine News reporters covering the mine collapse. McGuire came out of on-air retirement to host the event, which was broadcast as part of The AFL Footy Show (both versions).
Before leaving for the Munich edition of The Footy Show he announced the elimination of 100 jobs, most in news and current affairs. Despite a vigorous publicity campaign by the CEO these cost-cutting measures severely damaged morale at the network. On one program McGuire's required job-cuts exceeded the actual number of employees. This raised questions in both the media and within Channel 9 itself about the competence of Nine's executives.
The troubles worsened when an affidavit written by a Channel 9 executive affected by the purges was leaked to the press and Nine failed in its attempts to suppress it. It contained allegations regarding McGuire's treatment of employees. The document's author, Mark Llewellyn (previous head of news and current affairs who has since found work at Channel 7), claimed that McGuire and his staff had told him that he would be forced to "eat a shit sandwich" (accept a dramatic pay-cut). He also recalled conversations with McGuire where the CEO had spoken of wanting to "bone" (fire) Jessica Rowe, co-host of the network's Today show. Following these allegations McGuire guaranteed Rowe her position on the program.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/its-black-and-white-teams-says-eddies-out-of-form/2006/09/01/1156817099211.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=It's black and white: team says Eddie's out of form | date=2 September 2006 | first=Dan | last=Silkstone[/tpl] McGuire has strongly denied the allegations. On 6 May 2007, Llewellyn's position was vindicated when it was announced that Jessica Rowe would not be returning to Channel 9.[tpl]cite news|title=Nine 'bones' Rowe|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/rowe-goes-quietly/2007/05/06/1178390123628.html|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=7 May 2007 | date=6 May 2007[/tpl]
McGuire's decision to force Jana Wendt off the Sunday program backfired with the relaunch of the show on 3 September 2006.  The Nine Network's switchboard was flooded with an unprecedented number of calls complaining about the new format and hosts.Viewers let Nine know what they think of the new Sunday. Crikey (2006-09-05). Retrieved on 2011-10-14.
This episode was considered by many in the media as a failure by the 'P-plated CEO' (a term coined by Sydney tabloids) to manage the network in a professional and ethical manner.  It also fuelled speculation as to his longevity in his position as CEO of Nine.
On 18 May 2007, McGuire announced he would be resigning as CEO of the Nine network and would be taking on a new position in programming services as well as more on-screen roles.  He officially resigned as CEO on 30 June 2007.
