==Life and career==

Ketchum attended high school at the Webb School of California. He then studied design as an undergrad at UCLA and began his study in photography under the direction of Edmund Teske and Robert Heinecken. He later received an MFA from the California Institute of the Arts in 1974.  After he graduated he began a lifelong friendship with Eliot Porter, who helped form his ideas about photography and about how photography can be used to help change the world.
In his 30-year career, Ketchum has become well known as a photographer-environmentalist. In its centennial edition, Audubon magazine included Ketchum in their list of 100 people "who shaped the environmental movement in the 20th century."[tpl]cite web| title=Champions of Conservation| url=http://www.audubonmagazine.org/century/champion.html| accessdate=2010-04-22[/tpl] He was also listed by American Photo magazine as one of the 100 most important people in photography,[tpl]cite web| title =Robert Glenn Ketchum's Famous Environmental Photography at G2 Gallery in Venice, CA| url=http://www.dpmag.com/news/industry-news/robert-glenn-ketchums-famous-environmental-photography-at-g2-gallery-in-venice-ca.html| accessdate=2010-04-22[/tpl] as well as being named the 2001 Outstanding Photographer of the Year by the North American Nature Photography Association[tpl]cite web| title= NANPA Awards and Past Winners |url=http://www.nanpa.org/nanpa_awards.php|accessdate=2010-04-22[/tpl] and Outstanding Person of the Year 2000 by Photo Media magazine.[tpl]cite web| title=Photo Media: Photography person of the Year | url=http://www.photomediaonline.com/?page_id=172|accessdate=2010-04-22[/tpl]
Ketchum and his close friend master printer Michael Wilder pioneered Cibachrome color printmaking in the early 1970s. They were also among the first contemporary photographers to explore print scale. Ketchum's distinctive and very dimensional prints are in numerous collections, including the Museum of Modern Art (New York City), the National Museum of American Art (Washington, D.C.), the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City), to name a few.  Significant archives of more than 100 images have been acquired by the Amon Carter Museum in Texas and the Huntington Library in Los Angeles, and substantial bodies of work can be found at the High Museum in Atlanta, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Akron Art Museum, the Stanford University Art Museum and the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Cornell University.
As a curator and author, Ketchum has published with Harry N. Abrams and Viking Books, and has seven individual titles with Aperture. Prior to his emergence as a photographer, he was a widely recognized curator, discovering the Paul Outerbridge, Jr.,  estate, bringing recognition to the overlooked work of James Van Der Zee, and authoring American Photographers and the National Parks. After publication of his last title Ketchum began to concentrate on his own politically focused projects and publications such as The Tongass: Alaska's Vanishing Rain Forest.
In 2010 American Photo magazine named Ketchum as the first conservation photographer ever to receive the Master Series distinction.[tpl]cite web| title=Masters Series: Robert Glenn Ketchum| url=http://www.popphoto.com/photography/2010/03/masters-series-robert-glenn-ketchum| accessdate=2010-04-22[/tpl] In twenty years of publishing, American Photo has only designated four other photographers with the Master Series.
Ketchum has had over 400 one-man and group shows, and his photographs are in major museum collections throughout the world.[tpl]cite web| title = International League of Conservation Photographers: Robert Glenn Ketchum| url=http://www.ilcp.com/index.php?cid=usrs&port=rglennketchum| accessdate=2010-04-22[/tpl] He is a founding Fellow of the International League of Conservation Photographers."Robert Glenn Ketchum" on the International League of Conservation Photographers website
