==Transplant==

In Italy, the Polyclinic is the second biggest center for transplants of liver (487 in 2000-05) and kidney (424) after the San Giovanni Battista Hospital of Turin; and also the second for heart (212) after the San Matteo Polyclinic of Pavia. The Polyclinic performs also intestinal and multi-organs transplants. In 2008, for the first time in Europe, a multi-organ transplant heart-liver-kidney was performed.

==History==

The Sant’Orsola Hospital was founded in 1592 just outside the walls of the city (now ring road).
In 1860-69, finally, it became home to the clinics of the Faculty of Medicine. The hospital was dedicated to Saint Ursula (now the patron saint).
In 1978 it merged with the adjacent Malpighi Hospital built in the ‘70. The hospital was dedicated to Marcello Malpighi of Bologna, one of the greatest Italian histologist, anatomic and physiologist.

==Structure==

The hospital has thirty buildings, called padiglioni (pavilions), which home 67 units (specialist and support) grouped in 7 departments. It is organized as a “garden town” long more than 1 km.
The padiglioni are numbered from east to west (from the furthest to the closest to the city center).
