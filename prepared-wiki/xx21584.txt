The Savinja ([tpl]IPA-sl|saˈviːnja|pron[/tpl]) is a river in northeast Slovenia which flows mostly in the Upper and Lower Savinja Valley ([tpl]lang-sl|Zgornja in Spodnja Savinjska dolina[/tpl]) and through the cities of Celje and Laško. The Savinja is the main river of the Savinja Alps (Sln. Savinjske Alpe). It flows into Sava River at the town of Zidani Most. It has often flooded, such as in the 1960s, 1990, and 1995. The Savinja has a length of [tpl]convert|102|km[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.stat.si/letopis/1998/01_98/01-10-98.asp?jezik=en |title=Reke, dolge nad 25 km, in njihova  padavinska območja |language=Slovene, English |trans_title=Rivers, longer than 25 km, and their  catchment areas |year=2002 |publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia[/tpl]

==Sources==

The stream is created by Rinka Falls, which flows along a regulated riverbed to the lower end of the Logar Valley, where it flows into Jezera Creek, from which point it becomes the Savinja River. This spring has been proclaimed a natural heritage object, and Rinka Falls is one of the most beautiful and best-known waterfalls in Slovenia.  It is the highest waterfall of the 20 waterfalls in the Logar Valley and is visited throughout the year. In the winter it is popular for ice-climbers. The best view of the waterfall is from Kamnik Saddle ([tpl]lang-sl|Kamniško sedlo[/tpl]).

==Tributaries==

The main tributaries of the Savinja are the Jušef and the Klobaša at Solčava, the Lučnica at Luče, the Ljubnica at Ljubno, the Dreta at Nazarje, the Paka at Šmartno ob Paki, and the Ložnica and Voglajna with the Hudinja at Celje.

==Hydronym and etymology==

The name Savinja (attested in written sources in 980 as Sovuina) is derived from *Savьn′a, in turn derived from the hydronym Sava, of which it is a tributary. The German name Sann was attested later. In the local dialect, the river is known as Sá[tpl]IPA|u̯[/tpl]ńe. The form *Savьn′a should have yielded Savnja as the current Slovene name, but it was reshaped on the model of Hudinja. The name is believed to ultimately not be of Slavic origin, but of older pre-Slavic origin.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimološki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Založba ZRC, p. 368.
The German name Sann was also used in some older English sources; for example, in the ninth edition of Encyclopædia Britannica from 1911.
Some other names for the river include:
The Roman goddess Adsaluta, whose altars were found in the area of the settlement of Sava, was long identified with the Savinja. Modern scholars have rejected the connection.[tpl]cite book |first=Marjeta |last=Šašel Kos |language=Slovene, abstract in English |url=http://iza.zrc-sazu.si/pdf/Sasel_Kos_Ukrocena_lepotica.pdf |pages=42–50 |chapter=Reka kot božanstvo - Sava v antiki |trans_chapter=River as a Deity – The Sava in Antiquity |editor-first=Jožef |editor-last=Barachini |title=Ukročena lepotica: Sava in njene zgodbe |trans_title=The Tamed Beauty: The Sava and Its Stories |isbn=978-961-92735-0-0 |year=2009 |place=Sevnica |publisher=Javni zavod za kulturo, šport, turizem in mladinske dejavnosti |pages=44–46[/tpl]

==Life along the river==

Raftsmen from Ljubno traveled along the river until the 1950s. In their memory, a bronze sculpture of a raftsman (Splavar), created in 1961 by Boris Kalin, stands on the river's left bank in Celje.
