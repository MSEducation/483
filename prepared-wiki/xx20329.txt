==History==

Oakland was formally incorporated as a town in 1862.
The town is home to a historic B&O train station, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and restored in the 2000s.[tpl]NRISref|2008a[/tpl] Trains still run on the train tracks behind the station, but it is mainly used for special organizations or gatherings as of the present day. A gift shop is located within the station. In front of the station, there are a plethora of festivities that go on, mainly seasonal activities such as housing the town Christmas tree, decorating the plaza for a holiday, and sometimes parties.
Main Street of Oakland consists mainly of historic two to four story buildings that house the main shopping in the area, such as a theatre, museum, book store, a local pharmacy, antique shops, clothing stores and banks. Many of the homes and businesses in the downtown area are examples of Victorian architecture. Much of the central section of Oakland is part of the Oakland Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.[tpl]NRISref|2008a[/tpl] Also listed on the National Register are the Garrett County Courthouse and Hoye Site.
One of the most prominent and historic churches in Oakland is St. Matthew's Episcopal Church, where U.S. Presidents Ulysses S. Grant, James Garfield, Grover Cleveland, and Benjamin Harrison have all attended services. Because of this, it is now called the "Church of Presidents." Another prominent and historic church is St. Peter the Apostle Church, a Catholic church located on Fourth Street.  A large neoclassical courthouse is also very prominent and dominates the town center.
In the late 19th century and early 20th century, a large hotel named the Oakland Hotel was located near the downtown train station. It was constructed in 1878 by the B&O Railroad.[tpl]Citation |last=Long |first=Helen |author-link= |last2=Scharf |first2=John Thomas |author2-link=John Thomas Scharf |title=History of Western Maryland |publisher=Genealogical Publishing Co. |origyear=1882 |year=2003 |page=1539 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ntVpHBIz0hAC&printsec=frontcover&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] The hotel was a major tourist attraction for that time period until it was torn down in the early 20th Century.
