Common chicory, Cichorium intybus,[tpl]cite web|url=http://ecocrop.fao.org/ecocrop/srv/en/cropView?id=694 |title=Cichorium intybus |publisher=FAO - Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN |accessdate=2013-12-16[/tpl] is a somewhat woody, perennial herbaceous plant usually with bright blue flowers, rarely white or pink. Many varieties are cultivated for salad leaves, chicons (blanched buds), or for roots (var. sativum), which are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and additive. It is also grown as a forage crop for livestock.[tpl]Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=B0bXX_grAwYC&pg=PA68 | title = Nutrition and Feeding of Organic Cattle | isbn = 978-1-84593-758-4 | author1 = Blair | first1 = Robert | date = 2011-04-30[/tpl] It lives as a wild plant on roadsides in its native Europe, and in North America and Australia, where it has become widely naturalized.[tpl]cite web|title=Cichorium intybus|url=http://efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=200023652|publisher=Flora of North America|accessdate=23 March 2014[/tpl]
"Chicory" is also the common name in the United States for curly endive (Cichorium endivia); these two closely related species are often confused.[tpl]cite web|url=http://plantanswers.tamu.edu/vegetables/endive.html |title=Endive, Chicory and Witloof |work=Aggie Horticulture |publisher=Texas AgriLife Extension Service, Texas A&M System |accessdate=2013-12-16[/tpl]

==Names==

Common chicory is also known as blue daisy, blue dandelion, blue sailors, blue weed, bunk, coffeeweed, cornflower, hendibeh, horseweed, ragged sailors, succory, wild bachelor's buttons, and wild endive.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.oardc.ohio-state.edu/weedguide/singlerecord.asp?id=920 |author=John Cardina, Cathy Herms, Tim Koch, and Ted Webster |title=Chickory Cichorium intybus |publisher=Ohio State University OARDC Extension |work=Ohio Perennial & Biennial Weed Guide| accessdate=February 25, 2013[/tpl] (Note: "Cornflower", is more commonly applied to Centaurea cyanus.)  Common names for varieties of var. foliosum include endive, radicchio, Belgian endive, French endive, red endive, sugarloaf and witloof (or witlof).

==Description==

When flowering, chicory has a tough, grooved, and more or less hairy stem, from [tpl]Convert|30|to|100|cm|sigfig=1[/tpl] tall.
The leaves are stalked, lanceolate and unlobed.
The flower heads are [tpl]Convert|2|to|4|cm|sigfig=2[/tpl] wide, and usually bright blue, rarely white or pink.  There are two rows of involucral bracts; the inner are longer and erect, the outer are shorter and spreading. It flowers from July until October.
The achenes have no pappus (feathery hairs), but do have toothed scales on top.[tpl]cite book |last=Rose |first=Francis|authorlink=Francis Rose  |title=The Wild Flower Key |year=1981 |publisher=Frederick Warne & Co|isbn=0-7232-2419-6 |pages=390–391[/tpl]

==Leaf chicory==

===Wild===

Wild chicory leaves are usually bitter. Their bitterness is appreciated in certain cuisines, such as in the Liguria and Puglia regions of Italy and also in Catalonia (Spain), in Greece and in Turkey.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.turkish-cuisine.org/english/pages.php?ParentID=5&FirstLevel=53&SecondLevel=61 |author=Tijen İnaltong |title=Wild Herbs of Turkey |publisher=Turkish Cultural Foundation |accessdate=2013-12-16[/tpl] In Ligurian cuisine the wild chicory leaves are an ingredient of preboggion and in Greek cuisine of horta; in the Puglian region wild chicory leaves are combined with fava bean puree in the traditional local dish Fave e Cicorie Selvatiche.;[tpl]cite web|author=Kyle Phillips |url=http://italianfood.about.com/od/chickpeaslentils/r/blr1898.htm |title=Fava Bean Puree with Wild Chicory Recipe - Fave e Cicorie Selvatiche |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2013-12-16[/tpl] in Albania the leaves are used as a spinach substitute, mainly served simmered and marinated in olive oil, or as ingredient for fillings of byrek.
By cooking and discarding the water the bitterness is reduced, after which the chicory leaves may be sautéed with garlic, anchovies and other ingredients. In this form the resulting greens might be combined with pasta[tpl]cite web|url=http://dolcevitadiaries.co.uk/2009/05/19/wild-chicory-spaghetti |title=Wild Chicory Spaghetti |publisher=Nudo Italia |work=Dolce Vita Diaries |date=2009-05-19 |accessdate=2013-12-16[/tpl] or accompany meat dishes.Jaume Fàbrega, El gust d'un poble: els plats més famosos de la cuina catalana.

===Cultivated===

Chicory may be cultivated for its leaves, usually eaten raw as salad leaves. Cultivated chicory is generally divided into three types, of which there are many varieties:
The Catalogna chicory (also known as puntarelle) includes a whole subfamily (some varieties from Belgian endive and some from radicchio)[tpl]citation| publisher= PROJECTFOODLAB| date=March 17, 2011|accessdate=2013-08-25|title = Cicoria Asparago o Catalogna - Long-stemmed Italian Chicory| url =http://projectfoodlab.typepad.com/projectfoodlab-italy/2011/03/cicoria-asparago-o-catalogna-long-stemmed-italian-chicory.html[/tpl] of chicory and used throughout Italy.
Although leaf chicory is often called "endive", true endive (Cichorium endivia) is a different species in the genus and shouldn't be confused with Belgian endive.

==Root chicory==

Root chicory (Cichorium intybus var. sativum) has been cultivated in Europe as a coffee substitute. The roots are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and additive, especially in the Mediterranean region (where the plant is native). As a coffee additive, it is also mixed in Indian filter coffee, and in parts of Southeast Asia, South Africa and southern United States, particularly in New Orleans. It has been more widely used during economic crises such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and during World War II in Continental Europe. Chicory, with sugar beet and rye, was used as an ingredient of the East German Mischkaffee (mixed coffee), introduced during the "East German coffee crisis" of 1976-79.
Some beer brewers use roasted chicory to add flavor to stouts. Others have added it to strong blond Belgian-style ales, to augment the hops, making a "witlofbier", from the Dutch name for the plant.
Around 1970 it was found that the root contains up to 20% inulin, a polysaccharide similar to starch. Inulin is mainly found in the plant family Asteraceae as a storage carbohydrate (for example Jerusalem artichoke, dahlia, yacon etc.). It is used as a sweetener in the food industry with a sweetening power [tpl]frac|1|10[/tpl] that of sucrose[tpl]cite web|author=Joseph O'Neill |url=http://www.functionalingredientsmag.com/article/Formulations/using-inulin-and-oligofructose-with-high-intensity-sweeteners.aspx |title=Using inulin and oligofructose with high-intensity sweeteners |publisher=Penton |work=New Hope 360 |date=2008-06-01 |accessdate=2013-12-16[/tpl] and is sometimes added to yogurts as a prebiotic. Inulin is also gaining popularity as a source of soluble dietary fiber and functional food.Madrigal L. Sangronis E. "Inulin and derivates as key ingredients in functional foods. Review" Spanish  Archivos Latinoamericanos de Nutricion. 57(4):387-96, 2007 Dec.
Chicory root extract is a dietary supplement or food additive produced by mixing dried, ground chicory root with water, and removing the insoluble fraction by filtration and centrifugation.   Other methods may be used to remove pigments and sugars. It is used as a source of soluble fiber.  Fresh chicory root typically contains, by dry weight, 68% inulin, 14% sucrose, 5% cellulose, 6% protein, 4% ash, and 3% other compounds.  Dried chicory root extract contains, by weight, approximately 98% inulin and 2% other compounds.
Fresh chicory root may contain between 13 and 23% inulin, by total weight.

==Agents responsible for bitterness==

The bitter substances are primarily the two sesquiterpene lactones Lactucin and Lactucopicrin. Other ingredients are Aesculetin, Aesculin, Cichoriin, Umbelliferone, Scopoletin and 6.7-Dihydrocoumarin and further sesquiterpene lactones and their glycosides.Harsh Pal Bais, GA Ravishankar (2001) Cichorium intybus L – cultivation, processing, utility, value addition and biotechnology, with an emphasis on current status and future prospects. Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 81, 467-484 (online)

==Medicinal use==

Root chicory contains volatile oils similar to those found in plants in the related genus Tanacetum which includes Tansy, and is similarly effective at eliminating intestinal worms. All parts of the plant contain these volatile oils, with the majority of the toxic components concentrated in the plant's root.Edible and Medicinal Plants of the West, Gregory L. Tilford, ISBN 0-87842-359-1
Chicory is well known for its toxicity to internal parasites. Studies indicate that ingestion of chicory by farm animals results in reduction of worm burdens,[ref]

</ref> which has prompted its widespread use as a forage supplement.  Only a few major companies are active in research, development, and production of chicory varieties and selections, most in New Zealand.
Chicory (especially the flower), used as a folk medicine in Germany, is recorded in many books as an ancient German treatment for everyday ailments. It is variously used as a tonic and as a treatment for gallstones, gastro-enteritis, sinus problems and cuts and bruises. (Howard M. 1987). Chicory contains inulin,[tpl]cite journal|pmid=12468594|year=2002|last1=Roberfroid|first1=MB|last2=Cumps|first2=J|last3=Devogelaer|first3=JP|title=Dietary chicory inulin increases whole-body bone mineral density in growing male rats|volume=132|issue=12|pages=3599–602|journal=The Journal of nutrition[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author=Roberfroid MB | title=Inulin-type fructans: functional food ingredients | journal=Journal of Nutrition | volume=137 |issue=11 suppl | year=2007 | pages=2493S-2502S | url=http://jn.nutrition.org/content/137/11/2493S.long | id= | pmid=17951492[/tpl] which may help humans with weight loss, constipation, improving bowel function, and general health.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-1048-INULIN.aspx?activeIngredientId=1048 |title=Inulin |publisher=WebMD |accessdate=2013-12-16[/tpl]  In rats, it may increase calcium absorption and bone mineral density.

===Alternative medicine===

Chicory has been listed as one of the 38 plants that are used to prepare Bach flower remedies,[tpl]cite book|author=D. S. Vohra|title=Bach Flower Remedies: A Comprehensive Study|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=icG8onA0ys8C&pg=PR3|accessdate=2 September 2013|date=1 June 2004|publisher=B. Jain Publishers|isbn=978-81-7021-271-3|page=3[/tpl] a kind of alternative medicine. However according to Cancer Research UK, "there is no scientific evidence to prove that flower remedies can control, cure or prevent any type of disease, including cancer".

Large quantities of tannins bind with and precipitate proteins, resulting in low digestibility and nutrient reduction.
Although chicory might have originated in France, Italy, and India,[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] much development of chicory for use with livestock has taken place in New Zealand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ruralliving.co.nz/cms/special_feature/pasture_management/2011/03/making_good_use_of_chicory.php |title=Making good use of chicory |date=2011-03-25 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110727162720/http://www.ruralliving.co.nz/cms/special_feature/pasture_management/2011/03/making_good_use_of_chicory.php |archivedate=2011-07-27[/tpl]

==History==

The chicory plant is one of the earliest cited in recorded literature. Horace mentions it in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: "Me pascunt olivae, me cichorea, me malvae" ("As for me, olives, endives, and mallows provide sustenance").Horace, Odes 31, ver 15, ca 30 BC In 1766, Frederick the Great banned the importatation of coffee into Prussia leading to the development of a coffee-substitute by Brunswick innkeeper Christian Gottlieb Förster (died 1801), who gained a concession in 1769/70 to manufacture it in Brunswick and Berlin. By 1795 there were 22 to 24 factories of this type in Brunswick.[tpl]cite book|editor=Thomas Hengartner, Christoph Maria Merki |title=Genußmittel.|publisher=Campus Verlag |location= Frankfurt a. M. New York |year=1999| ISBN= 3-593-36337-2[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Carl Philipp Ribbentrop |title=Vollständige Geschichte und Beschreibung der Stadt Braunschweig. |volume= 2 |location= Braunschweig|year= 1796 |pages= 146−148 |language=German[/tpl] Lord Monboddo describes the plant in 1779Letter from Monboddo to John Hope, 29 April 1779; reprinted by William Knight 1900 ISBN 1-85506-207-0 as the "chicoree", which the French cultivate it as a pot herb. In Napoleonic Era France chicory frequently appeared as either an adulterant in coffee, or a coffee substitute. Chicory was also adopted as a coffee substitute by Confederate soldiers during the American Civil War, and has become common in the United States. It was also used in the United Kingdom during the Second World War, where Camp Coffee, a coffee and chicory essence, has been on sale since 1885.
The cultivated chicory plant has a history reaching back to ancient Egyptian time. Medieval monks raised the plants and when coffee was introduced to Europe, the Dutch thought that chicory made a lively addition to the bean drink.
In the United States chicory root has long been used as a substitute for coffee in prisons.(a) Delaney, John H. "New York (State). Dept. of Efficiency and Economy Annual Report". Albany New York, 1915, p. 673. Accessed via Google Books. (b) "Prison Talk" website; Kentucky section: http://www.prisontalk.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-173368.html. By the 1840s, the port of New Orleans was the second largest importer of coffee (after New York). Louisianans began to add chicory root to their coffee when Union naval blockades during the American Civil War cut off the port of New Orleans, thereby creating a long-standing tradition.
A common meal in Rome, puntarelle, is made with chicory sprouts.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rome.info/food/ |title=Rome food and cuisine |publisher=Rome.info |accessdate=2013-12-16[/tpl] The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that Chicory is a native plant of western Asia, North Africa, and Europe.
Chicory is also mentioned in certain sericulture (silk-growing) texts. It is said that the primary caretaker of the silkworms, the "silkworm mother", should not eat or even touch it.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl]
The chicory flower is often seen as inspiration for the Romantic concept of the Blue Flower (e. g. in German language 'Blauwarte' ≈ 'blue lookout by the wayside'). It could open locked doors, according to European folklore.Howard, Michael. Traditional Folk Remedies (Century, 1987), p.120.
