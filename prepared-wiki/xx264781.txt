The Vinča Institute of Nuclear Sciences is a nuclear physics research institution near Belgrade, Serbia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/serbia/facility/vinca.htm|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Vinca Special Weapons Facilities - Serbia[/tpl] Since its founding, the institute has also conducted research in the fields in physics, chemistry and biology. The scholarly institute is part of the University of Belgrade.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bg.ac.rs/eng/memb/inst/en_instvinca.php|accessdate=2011-04-19|title=Members of the University of Belgrade - Vinča Institute of Nuclear Science[/tpl]

==History==

The institute was established in 1948 as the Institute for Physics. Several different research groups started in the 1950s, and two research reactors were built.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/serbia/vinca.htm|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Vinca Special Weapons Facilities - Serbia[/tpl]

The larger of the two reactors was rated at 6.5 MW and used Soviet-supplied 80% enriched uranium fuel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/2010/vinca-qa.html|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Q&A: Fuel Repatriation Project from Vinca Institute[/tpl]
In October 1958, there was a criticality accident at one of the research reactors. Six workers received large doses of radiation; one died shortly afterwards.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/radevents/1958YUG1.html|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=1958-01-01[/tpl] The other five received the first ever bone marrow transplants in Europe.Vinca reactor accident, 1958, compiled by Wm.

The nuclear research programme ended in 1968, while the reactors were switched off in 1984.

==Removal of radioactive waste==

In 2009, it was reported that the nuclear fuel storage pool, containing large quantities of radioactive waste, was in poor condition.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLN86820|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Serbs send nuclear fuel to Russia, citing security|publisher=Reuters|first=Aleksandar|last=Vasovic|date=2009-06-23[/tpl]
In 2010, 2.5 tonnes of waste, including 13 kg of 80% enriched uranium, were transported from Vinča to a reprocessing facility at Mayak, Russia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/c_press/release_082302.pdf|title=NTI Commits $5 Million To Help Secure Vulnerable Nuclear Weapons Material|accessdate=2011-01-02[/tpl] This was the IAEA's largest ever technical cooperation project, and thousands of police protected the convoys.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2010/12/23/feature-01|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Serbia gets rid of dangerous nuclear material (SETimes.com)[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/2010/vinca.html|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Massive Operation Safely Secures Serbian Nuclear Fuel in Russia[/tpl]
Removal of the nuclear waste allows decommissioning of Vinca's remaining reactor to be completed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2010&mm=09&dd=20&nav_id=69789|accessdate=2011-01-02|title=Nuclear decommissioning of Vinča this year[/tpl]
