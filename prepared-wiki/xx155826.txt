[[Driven Under]]

CATEGORIES: 2003 singles, Seether songs

"Driven Under" is a song by post-grunge and alternative metal band Seether and the second single off their 2002 debut album. The mid-tempo song has a dark, moody atmosphere which shifts into a slow, heavy chorus.
The "Driven Under" music video features singer Shaun Morgan walking down a street in a small town singing the song. Along his way, various people on the street turn their attention to him, including the rest of the band, who are playing the song as well. In the final shots, a car explodes in slow-motion in reverse, as Morgan walks towards it, entering the car in the final shot of the video.
