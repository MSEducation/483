[[Soba (city)]]

CATEGORIES: History of Sudan, Populated places in Sudan

Soba is the name of the capital of Alodia. E. A. Wallis Budge identified it with a group of ruins on the Blue Nile 12 miles from Khartoum, where there are remains of a Meroitic temple that had been converted into a Christian church.E.A Wallis Budge, A History of Ethiopia: Nubia and Abyssinia, 1928 (Oosterhout, the Netherlands: Anthropological Publications, 1970) p. 118. This would place Soba in the modern-day Sudanese state of Al Jazirah.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl]
Ibn Selim el-Aswani described the city as large and wealthy, but he probably never visited it and modern archaeological investigations show it to have been a moderate centre. Built mainly of red brick, the abandoned city was plundered for building material when Khartoum was founded in 1821.

==Notes==

Soba is commonly located the east side of the Blue Nile river. It was once a Christian kingdom before being destroyed by Fong and Abdallab in 1905.  There is confusing surrounding the location as most people think it was at the west bank of the blue Nile river. The population in East Soba today are Magariba tribe.
