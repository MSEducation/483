Vicki Leekx is a mixtape by British recording artist M.I.A. which was released on 31 December 2010. Following the release of her album Maya earlier in 2010, the artist announced via Twitter that she would be releasing a mixtape on the last day of the year, and subsequently made it available free to download. It incorporates reworked versions of tracks from Maya and new material and was reported as having been inspired by the 2010 Wikileaks controversy, although much of its content is not politically inspired.

==Background==

British-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi "Maya" Arulpragasam) released her third album Maya in July 2010 to mixed reviews.[tpl]cite web|url=http://culture.wnyc.org/articles/music-hub/2010/jul/23/gig-alerts-mia/|title=Gig Alerts: M.I.A.|first=Alana|last=Harper|date=23 July 2010|accessdate=28 July 2010|publisher=WNYC Radio|work=The Culture Site[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/2010/07/27/2010-07-27_mia_offers_free_nyc_show_in_response_to_disastrous_hard_performance_on_governors.html|title=M.I.A. offers free NYC show in response to disastrous Hard NYC performance on Governors Island|first=Anthony|last=Benigno|date=28 July 2010|accessdate=28 July 2010|publisher=New York Daily News|work=NYDailyNews.com[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/clicktrack/2010/07/taking_sides_is_the_mia_backla.html|title=Taking sides: Is the M.I.A. backlash a result of truffle fry angst or crummy songs?|last=Price|first=Allison M.|date=15 July 2010|accessdate=28 July 2010|work=The Washington Post[/tpl] In early December she announced on Twitter that she would be following it up with a mixtape to be released on 31 December, stating "vicky leekx [tpl]sic[/tpl] mixtape coming new years eve! layin bad minds to rest 2010!" The mixtape was uploaded online from Bangkok, Thailand after she sent it via YouSendIt to a friend,[tpl]Cite episode|title=Big Day Out interview – MIA – Entertainment – Video – 3 News|series=3 News|credits=David Farrier (Interviewer), M.I.A.

Exclaim! writer Josiah Hughes contended that the latter portion of the message referred to events which had occurred during the year including the album's mixed reviews and her clashes with journalists and former collaborator Diplo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/News/mi_plans_ivicky_leekz_i_mixtape_for_new_years_eve|title=M.I.A.

==Music and lyrics==

The material included reworked tracks and out-takes from Maya,[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2011/01/mias_vicki_leek.php|title=M.I.A.'s ViCKi LEEKX Mixtape: A 2010 Victory Lap and a Notice To The Haters|first=Zach|last=Baron|work=The Village Voice|date=3 January 2011|accessdate=19 January 2011[/tpl] with previously unreleased material.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/caught-in-the-net-catch-mias-mixtape-if-you-can-2177871.html|title=Caught in the Net: Catch M.I.A's mixtape if you can|first=Larry|last=Ryan|date=7 January 2011|accessdate=24 January 2011|work=The Independent[/tpl] Some of the tracks, including "Let Me Hump You" and "Gen-N-E-Y", had been made available by M.I.A. earlier in the year at a series of bespoke website addresses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/MusicVideo/ClickHear/MI-Lemme_Hump_You_ft_Blaqstarr|title=M.I.A."Lemme Hump You" (ft.

Miller of the group Sleigh Bells on the original version of the former.

A number of reviewers made a connection between the mixtape's title and the 2010 Wikileaks controversy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/12/mia-releases-new-wikileaks-inspired-mixtape-vicki-leekx.html|title=M.I.A. releases new Wikileaks-inspired mixtape, Vicki Leekx|work=Los Angeles Times|date=31 December 2010|accessdate=24 January 2011|first=Randall|last=Roberts[/tpl] Although the mix opens with a quote about the leaking of information and subsequent legal and political attacks from Julian Assange, founder of Wikileaks, delivered by a female voice,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/948593/billboard-bits-chris-brown-reveals-more-collabs-mia-drops-vicki-leekx-mixtape|title=Billboard Bits: Chris Brown Reveals More Collabs, M.I.A. Drops 'Vicki Leekx' Mixtape|work=Billboard|date=31 December 2010|accessdate=24 January 2011|first=Monica|last=Herrera[/tpl] much of the content is not related to the controversy or politically themed. Musically, the mixtape is less abrasive in style than the industrial-influenced Maya, but the lyrics contain a number of attacks on "imitators, haters, and ... psychos" and "bitches who are fame hoes". The female voice heard at the start, identified by reviewers as the "title character", returns sporadically during the mix speaking internet slogans. At different points the music incorporates heavy percussion, Auto-Tuned vocals, and "bhangra-style" sounds similar to those heard on her second studio album Kala. Most of the mix is at a high tempo, although it slows towards the end, where the longest sections are found.

==Release and reception==

Vicki Leekx has been downloadable for free since 31 December 2010 from a bespoke website. In its review of the mixtape, Sputnikmusic commented that "Maya Arulpragasam might have had a rough year, but with Vicki Leekx, she's ended it with a bang".[tpl]cite web |last=Tao |first=Conrad |date=31 December 2010 |title=Maya's got mujahadeen, can't sing, and ends the year with a bang. |url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/40982/M.I.A.-VICKI-LEEKX/ |work=Sputnikmusic |accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl] Tom Breihan, a writer from Pitchfork Media, commented that in "its brief onslaught of sneery fun, Vicki Leekx only occasionally reaches the dizzy pop heights of Arular and Kala. But it does give us an M.I.A. who, once again, seems to be having a blast doing what she's doing. And it's great to learn this M.I.A. still exists". As of 6 January 2011, the track "Bad Girls" has been listed as "Best New Music" by the same website.[tpl]cite web |last=Lambert |first=Molly |date=6 January 2011 |title=Pitchfork: The Playlist: M.I.A.: "Bad Girls" |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12074-bad-girls/ |work=Pitchfork |accessdate=7 January 2011[/tpl] Matthew Cole, reviewing the mixtape in Slant Magazine, described Maya as "an act of musical self-immolation from a self-styled outsider uncomfortable with her own marketability" but that Vicki Leekx was an "ensuing ground-zero dance party" to follow up such a "levelling of her image". Mike Schiller, writing for webzine PopMatters, was positive in his review but stated that the mix sounded like "an artist throwing ideas at a wall and seeing what sticks". In consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave Vicki Leekx a B+ rating,[tpl]cite web |last=Christgau |first=Robert |date=11 March 2011 |title=Buck 65/M.I.A. |url=http://social.entertainment.msn.com/music/blogs/expert-witness-blogpost.aspx?post=18be6608-1dac-4613-a254-edf9597a1248 |work=MSN Music |accessdate=12 March 2011[/tpl] indicating "remarkable one way or another, yet also flirts with the humdrum or the half-assed".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg90/grades-90s.php |title=CG 90s: Key to Icons |last=Christgau |first=Robert |publisher=Robert Christgau |date=15 October 2000 |accessdate=12 March 2011[/tpl]
