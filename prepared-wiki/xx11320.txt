Around 5–10% of people who live to 80 years old have at least one epileptic seizure.[tpl]cite book|last=Longo|first=Dan L.|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine.|year=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0071748896|edition=18th ed.|chapter=369[/tpl] About 0.7% of people in the United States have a seizure in a given year.
Rates are highest in those less than a year of age and greater than 55. About 1% or 50 million people currently have epilepsy worldwide. About 4% of people develop epilepsy at some point in time.

==History==

The word epilepsy is derived from the Greek word for "attack."[tpl]cite web|title=Epilepsy (Seizure Disorder)|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/seizure/article.htm|accessdate=30 March 2012[/tpl] Seizures were long viewed as an otherworldly condition being referred to by Hippocrates in 400B.C. as "the sacred disease".[tpl]cite web|last=Shearer|first=Peter|title=Seizures and Status Epilepticus: Diagnosis and Management in the Emergency Department|url=http://www.ebmedicine.net/topics.php?paction=showTopic&topic_id=77|work=Emergency Medicine Practice[/tpl]
In the mid 1800s the first anti seizure medication, bromide, was introduced.[tpl]cite journal|last=Perucca|first=P|coauthors=Gilliam, FG|title=Adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs.|journal=Lancet neurology|date=September 2012|volume=11|issue=9|pages=792–802|pmid=22832500|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(12)70153-9[/tpl]
Following standardization proposals devised by Henri Gastaut and published in 1970,[tpl]cite journal | author = Gastaut H | title = Clinical and electroencephalographical classification of epileptic seizures. | journal = Epilepsia |volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 102–13 | year = 1970 | pmid = 5268244 | doi = 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1970.tb03871.x[/tpl] terms such as "petit mal", "grand mal", "Jacksonian", "psychomotor", and "temporal-lobe seizure" have fallen into disuse.

==Society and culture==

===Economics===

Seizures result in direct economic costs of about one billion dollars in the United States. Epilepsy results in economic costs in Europe of around 15.5 billion Euros in 2004.[tpl]cite book|title=The Epilepsies: The diagnosis and management of the epilepsies in adults and children in primary and secondary care|publisher=National Clinical Guideline Centre|chapter=1|pages=21–28url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13635/57784/57784.pdf|author=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|date=January 2012[/tpl] In India epilepsy is estimated to result in costs of 1.7 billion USD or 0.5% of the GDP.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs999/en/ | title = Epilepsy |series = Fact Sheets |date =October 2012 | accessdate = January 24, 2013 | publisher =World Health Organization[/tpl] They make up about 1% of emergency department visits (2% for emergency departments for children) in the United States.[tpl]cite journal|last=Martindale|first=JL|coauthors=Goldstein, JN; Pallin, DJ|title=Emergency department seizure epidemiology.|journal=Emergency medicine clinics of North America|date=February 2011|volume=29|issue=1|pages=15–27|pmid=21109099|doi=10.1016/j.emc.2010.08.002[/tpl]

===Driving===

Many areas of the world require there to be a minimum of six months from the last seizure before people can return to driving.

==Research==

Scientific work into the prediction of epileptic seizures began in the 1970s. Several techniques and methods have been proposed, but evidence regarding their usefulness is still lacking.[tpl]cite journal |author=Litt B, Echauz J |title=Prediction of epileptic seizures|journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=22–30 |date=May 2002 |pmid=12849542|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(02)00003-0[/tpl]
