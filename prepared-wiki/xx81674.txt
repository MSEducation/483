[[Longhorn beetle]]

CATEGORIES: Cerambycidae, Insect families

The longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae; also known as long-horned beetles or longicorns) are a cosmopolitan family of beetles, typically characterized by extremely long antennae, which are often as long as or longer than the beetle's body. In various members of the family, however, the antennae are quite short (e.g., Neandra brunnea, figured below) and such species can be difficult to distinguish from related beetle families such as Chrysomelidae. The family is large, with over 20,000 species described, slightly more than half from the Eastern Hemisphere. Several are serious pests. The larvae, called roundheaded borers, bore into wood, where they can cause extensive damage to either living trees or untreated lumber (or, occasionally, to wood in buildings; the old-house borer, Hylotrupes bajulus, being a particular problem indoors). A number of species mimic ants, bees, and wasps, though a majority of species are cryptically colored. The rare titan beetle (Titanus giganteus) from northeastern South America is often considered the largest (though not the heaviest, and not the longest including legs) insect, with a maximum known body length of just over [tpl]convert|16.7|cm[/tpl].[tpl]cite web |author=Max Barclay |year=2010 |title=Titanus giganteus Linnaeus (1771) |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/species-of-the-day/biodiversity/loss-of-habitat/titanus-giganteus/index.html |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |publisher=Natural History Museum[/tpl]

==Classification==

As with many large families, different authorities have tended to recognize many different subfamilies, or sometimes split subfamilies off as separate families entirely (e.g., Disteniidae, Oxypeltidae, and Vesperidae);[tpl]cite book |author=Sergio Antonio Vanin & Sergio Ide |year=2002 |chapter=Classificação comentada de Coleoptera |language=Portuguese |trans_chapter=An annotated classification of the Coleoptera |title=Proyecto de Red Iberoamericana de Biogeografía y Entomología Sistemática PrIBES 2002 |editor=C.

===Subfamilies===

There are eight subfamilies:[tpl]cite journal |author=Patrice Bouchard, Yves Bousquet, Anthony E. Davies, Miguel A. Alonso-Zarazaga, John F. Lawrence, Chris H. C. Lyal, Alfred F. Newton, Chris A. M.
