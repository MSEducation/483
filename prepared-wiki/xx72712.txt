The ravine of Metlac, which has been declared a National Park on account of its extremely rich biodiversity and beautiful landscapes, is the most famous feature of Fortín de las Flores.
The residents of Fortín de las Flores are considered by freighthopping Central American migrants to be some of the most generous in Mexico.Nazario, Sonia. Enrique's Journey. New York: Random House, 2006. p. 104
Travelers driving to the city of Veracruz from Mexico City pass through the colonial towns of Orizaba, Fortin de las Flores, and Cordoba. Orizaba is nestled under the snow-capped volcano Pico de Orizaba, the third-highest peak in North America at 18,491 feet, and Mexico’s highest. In Fortin de las Flores, the next stop on the journey, “flowers” form part of its name and much of its landscape. The small, industrial city of Cordoba is located about 10 minutes from Fortin.
The town’s central plaza where Mexico’s Declaration of Independence was signed offers a nice place to enjoy a sip of coffee, beer or rum, all products of local industry in this coffee and sugar growing region. From here travelers descend through sugar cane fields on their way to Veracruz and its fast-growing neighbor turned suburb Boca del Rio.
There are several 45-minute flights a day from Mexico City. By car or bus, the drive passes through the state of Puebla and across the formidable Cumbres de Maltrata Mountains down into the lush vegetation that characterizes just about the entire state. The drive from Mexico City to the port city of Veracruz takes under five hours on a toll road that has garnered a good rating from the American Automobile Association (AAA). Drivers should be aware that just outside Veracruz the return highway is at an 8,000-foot elevation and often enveloped in thick fog, making driving this stretch a challenge.
