Argaeus I of Macedon (Greek: Ἀργαῖος Αʹ ὁ Μακεδών) was a king of Macedon of the Argead dynasty from about 678 BC to about 640 BC. He succeeded his father Perdiccas I to the throne. Argaeus left as successor his son Philip I. Argaeus appears in the story of Dionysus Pseudanor related by Polyaenus, as the king who encountered an Illyrian invasion of Galaurus.
He is mentioned by Herodotus after 8.138 and by Justin.
