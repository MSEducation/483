[[Global basic income]]

CATEGORIES: Basic income

Global basic income refers to the idea that people all over the world will be guaranteed a minimum amount of money on a regular basis, that is, an unconditional basic income. This radical proposal is discussed in the context of the rest of the basic income discussion, for example at the conferences organized by the Basic Income Earth Network and of USBIG. While a national basic income has been discussed for much of the 20th century the idea of a global basic income is much younger. It all begun with the Dutch artist Pieter Kooistra who begun developing the idea in the 1970s, and later presented what he called presented the "Uno" plan. From the 1980s a few more people have started to think seriously about the proposals, and different suggestions on design and financing have been presented, among them monetary reform and "cap-and-dividend". Foundation Global Basic Income Foundation, founded in 2000, brings together research and debate on the idea.
