[[Amidoamine]]

CATEGORIES: Amides, Amines

Amidoamines are a class of chemical compounds that are formed from fatty acids and diamines. They are used as intermediates in the synthesis of surfactants, such as cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB), some of which are used in personal care products including soaps, shampoos, and cosmetics. Amidoamines can also serve as curing agents for epoxy resins.
Patch test studies have concluded that most apparent allergic reactions to products containing CAPB are more likely due to amidoamine.[tpl]cite journal| author=Fowler JF, Fowler LM, Hunter JE |title=Allergy to cocamidopropyl betaine may be due to amidoamine: a patch test and product use test study |journal= Contact Dermatitis |year=1997 |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=276–81 |pmid=9455630| doi=10.1111/j.1600-0536.1997.tb02464.x[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Foti C, Bonamonte D, Mascolo G, Corcelli A, Lobasso S, Rigano L, Angelini G |title=The role of 3-dimethylaminopropylamine and amidoamine in contact allergy to cocamidopropylbetaine |journal=Contact Dermatitis |year=2003 |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=194–198 |pmid= 12786723 |url=http://www.biologia.uniba.it/fisiologia/corcelli/en/pdf/contact%20dermatitis.pdf |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0536.2003.00078.x[/tpl]
