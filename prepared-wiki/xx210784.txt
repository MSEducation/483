The Egyptian Geographic Society ([tpl]Lang-ar|الجمعية الجغرافية المصرية[/tpl]; [tpl]Lang-fr|Société de géographie d'Egypte[/tpl]) was established by a decree of Khedive Isma'il Pasha on 19 May 1875. Its first president was the German botanist, traveller and ethnologist Georg August Schweinfurth. Originally founded as the Khedivial Society of Geography, its name was modified several times in order to reflect Egypt's changing political status. It acquired its current name following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.[tpl]cite web | title = History Of The Society | publisher = Official Website of the Egyptian Geographic Society | url = http://www.server2002.net/egs1/history.html | accessdate = 2008-08-18[/tpl]
