On October 5, 2013 KBBM began simulcasting on previously country-formatted KZJF 104.1 FM, in a process of moving the sports format to KZJF's weaker signal.http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/85327/the-fan-moves-in-columbiajefferson-city/On October 7, 2013 KBBM split from the simulcast and is stunting with Christmas music, branded as "Santa 100.1". One day later, at 10:01 A.M. the station switched its format from Christmas music to country, titling itself 100.1 Nash FM, much like other Cumulus-owned country stations. This is the 2nd station by Cumulus to launch "Nash FM" as a new format rather than a renaming, the other being the first, WNSH in New York. This is also somewhat of a format transfer with 104.1.
