Frederick Alexcee (1853 â€“ 1940s) was a Tsimshian carver and painter from the community of Lax Kw'alaams (Port Simpson, a.k.a. Fort Simpson), British Columbia, Canada.
Alexcee (his last name has also been spelled Alexie, Alexee, etc.) was born in Lax Kw'alaams, then known as Fort Simpson, in 1853.  His father was an Iroquois laborer from eastern Canada who was in the employee of the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Simpson.  His mother was Tsimshian from the Giluts'aaw tribe, one of the "Nine Tribes" from the lower Skeena River area based at Lax Kw'alaams.  In the matrilineal system of the Tsimshian, Alexcee followed his mother as a Giluts'aaw and as a member of the Gispwudwada (Killerwhale clan or phratry).  His Tsimshian name was 'Wiiksmwan, meaning Great Deer Woman.
Alexcee was trained as a halaayt carver, the term halaayt referring to shamanic practices which were the prerogative of chiefs.  He produced naxnox (spirit) paraphernalia and items for use in "secret society" ceremonies.  All of these were practices which late-19th-century missionaries in Lax Kw'alaams were endeavoring to eradicate.  Alexcee also carved for the Indian curio trade and produced paintings and drawings depicting traditional life in Port Simpson.
He carved human figures to adorn a baptismal font in Port Simpson's Methodist church.
He died some time in the 1940s.
Works of his can be found at the University of British Columbia's Museum of Anthropology, the Museum of Northern British Columbia in Prince Rupert, the New Westminster Museum and Archives and the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria.
