The Toyota TF106/TF106B is a Formula One car designed by Mike Gascoyne for the 2006 Formula One season. The car is an evolution of the previous year's TF105. The team began testing the car in November 2005, months earlier than any other team.

==2006 season==

After a highly successful 2005 season, hopes were high that Toyota would be a force in the 2006 season. However, from the off it was clear that this was not to be. In Bahrain, neither driver made it through to the pole position shoot-out, indeed Ralf Schumacher failed even to make the second round. This bad form continued for some months with the only highlight being Ralf's podium in Australia, which remained the team's best result that season. At Monaco a B version of the car was introduced but the effect was not immediate and it was not until Canada that Jarno Trulli scored his first points of the season and since then, Toyota have seen an upturn in form.
