==Reception==

The PS2 version was considered[tpl]by whom|date=January 2013[/tpl] to be the most innovative, but received the lowest overall scores. The later-released GameCube version was considered[tpl]by whom|date=January 2013[/tpl] to be much less frustrating. The console game was praised[tpl]by whom|date=January 2013[/tpl] for its unique ideas, but criticized[tpl]by whom|date=January 2013[/tpl] for its many issues, such as the odd collision system and poor graphics.

It was also considered to be far less complex, but still quite strategic.[tpl]clarify|date=January 2013[/tpl]
