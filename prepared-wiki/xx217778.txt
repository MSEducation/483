==Career in banking and agricultural lending==

===Initial positions===

McAbee’s early work in the agricultural lending sector included positions at Yuma Production Credit Association, Bank of America, and Bakersfield Production Credit Association. From 1993 to 2003, he was senior vice president and director of credit operations for Fresno Madera Farm Credit in Fresno, California.

===Farm Credit of New Mexico===

In 2003, succeeding Joe E. "Eddy" Ratliff, he became president and CEO of Farm Credit of New Mexico, the state’s largest agricultural lender, where he sought to expand credit opportunities for young people interested in beginning or maintaining careers in farming and ranching. McAbee launched the Growing Futures program in 2005, which readjusted lending requirements while reducing interest rates and waiving fees for borrowers ages 35 and younger. In an interview published in New Mexico Business Weekly, McAbee explained the genesis of the Growing Futures program and its mission: "We looked around the state and realized that we needed to do whatever we could to encourage young farmers and ranchers to stay in the state and to make agriculture their livelihood. There are not that many incentives for young people to stay on the farm."
In 2006, McAbee also launched a $250,000 scholarship program providing a $2,000 annual scholarship to the children and grandchildren of Farm Credit of New Mexico members enrolled as undergraduates at New Mexico State University.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hpj.com/archives/2005/dec05/dec19/FarmCreditgives250000forend.cfm|title=Farm Credit Gives $250,000 for Endowed Scholarship at NMSU|work=High Plains/Midwest Ag Journal|publisher=High Plains Journal, Inc.|format=Web|date=2005-12-15|accessdate=2008-08-27[/tpl]
During the 2008 U.S. federal campaign election cycle, as president and CEO of Farm Credit of New Mexico, McAbee contributed to the Farm Credit Council Political Action Committee (PAC), as he had also done since 2003 as both vice president and president of that credit institution.[tpl]cite web|title=Bruce Mcabee Political Campaign Contributions: 2008 Election Cycle|url=http://www.campaignmoney.com/political/contributions/bruce-mcabee.asp?cycle=08|format=Web|publisher=CampaignMoney.com|accessdate=2008-08-27[/tpl]  Representing Farm Credit of New Mexico, as its president, he sent a letter endorsing the legislative lobbying organization People for Preserving Our Western Heritage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.peopleforwesternheritage.com/PFWHLetters.htm|title=Letters and Public Statements|publisher=People for Preserving Our Western Heritage|accessdate=2008-08-27|quote=Letter of endorsement from Bruce McAbee, Farm Credit of New Mexico....[/tpl]
