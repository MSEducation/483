On 27 April 2007, Associated Newspapers was ordered to pay undisclosed damages to Hugh Grant. Grant has sued over claims made about his relationships with his former girlfriends in three separate tabloid articles, which were published in the Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday on 18, 21 and 24 February. His lawyer stated that all of the articles' "allegations and factual assertions are false."[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6598937.stm |title=Hugh Grant accepts libel damages |publisher=BBC News |date=27 April 2007 |accessdate=2 July 2013[/tpl]
In a written statement, Grant said he took the action because: "I was tired of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday papers publishing almost entirely fictional articles about my private life for their own financial gain.  I'm also hoping that this statement in court might remind people that the so-called 'close friends' or 'close sources' on which these stories claim to be based almost never exist."[tpl]cite news |url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/presspublishing/story/0,,2066970,00.html |title=Associated pays Grant damages |last=Tryhorn |first=Chris |publisher=The Guardian |date=27 April 2007 |accessdate=2 July 2013 |location=London[/tpl]
