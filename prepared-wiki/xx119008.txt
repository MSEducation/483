Ulmus macrocarpa Hance, the Large-fruited Elm, is a deciduous tree or large shrub endemic to the Far East excluding Japan. It is notable for its tolerance of drought and extreme cold and is the predominant vegetation on the dunes of the Khorchin sandy lands in the Jilin province of north-eastern China, making a small tree at the base of the dunes, and a shrub at the top http://www.fao.org//docrep/006/ad110e/ad110e01.htm.

==Description==

By the age of ten years, the tree bears a close resemblance to the American Elm U. americana, but will never approach the latter's size. The tree can reach a height of 17 m, with a slender trunk rarely exceeding 0.4 m d.b.h; the bark is longitudinally fissured, and dark grey in colour.  The twigs often develop corky wings that may persist for several years. The leaves are usually obovate As implied by its name, U. macrocarpa is distinguished by its large, orbicular, wafer-like samarae 
==Pests and diseases==

Possessed of a moderate resistance to Dutch elm disease and a low susceptibility to Elm Yellows, it has also proven very resistant to the elm leaf beetle Xanthogaleruca luteola in trials in Oklahoma http://www.sunshinenursery.com/elms.htm and Italy.Mittempergher, L. & Santini, A.

==Cultivation==

The species was introduced to the USA at the Arnold Arboretum, Massachusetts, in 1908, and to the UK at Aldenham House in Hertfordshire, almost certainly as part of the quincunx elm avenue leading to the front of the house,Audrey Le Lievre (1986).

(Autumn, 1986), pp. 173-193. by Vicary Gibbs (1853–1932) in the late 19th century.Bean, W. J. (1981). Trees and shrubs hardy in Great Britain, 7th edition. Murray, London  What remained of the avenue after the advent of Dutch elm disease was cleared circa 1980 to make way for a cricket pitch.
The tree has been assessed at the Morton Arboretum, Illinois, for its landscape potential, and is now considered suitable for open areas such as parks and campuses.[ref]Ware, G. (1995).

U. macrocarpa has been found to be the most cold hardy of the Chinese elms. In artificial freezing tests at the Morton Arboretum Shirazi, A. M. & Ware, G. H. (2004).

==Subspecies & varieties==

Two varieties are recognized: var. glabra Nie & Huang  and var. macrocarpa L.K.Fu

==Hybrids, hybrid cultivars and cultivars==

A natural hybrid of U. macrocarpa and U. davidiana var. japonica, named Ulmus × mesocarpa was discovered in South Korea in the 1980s.   
U. macrocarpa is believed to have been used in recent (post 2000) hybridization experiments at the Morton Arboretum Mittempergher, L. & Santini, A. (2004). Elm breeding history. ''Invest Agrar: Sist Recur For, (2004), 13 (1), 161-177. but results have yet (2008) to be published. There are no known cultivars of this taxon.
