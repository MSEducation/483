Miles, Hugh, Al-Jazeera
As a child born into a poor family, Al-Qassem had to work various jobs including metalwork, harvesting, street cleaning, electrical work, and more tedious tasks. Since then, he dreamt of leaving that world to work in something that would allow him to have a public presence and voice. He used to call radio stations to hear his name on air. He had a very strong interest in radio and television, and used to go to the city to watch television through windows of houses. He once got caught doing so by a homeowner who accused him of being a thief. After hearing his story, however, he allowed him to enter the house and watch television with the family. Al Qassem's family were able to buy a black and white television set of their own after electricity was introduced to his village.  Al-Qassem originally aspired to become a weather report presenter on television.[tpl]cite web|last=فائق|first=أبو المعالي|title=فيصل القاسم من الحدادة ونظافة الشوارع إلى أشهر إعلامى عربى فى أشهر قناة إعلامية عربية|url=http://lokmetaesh.blogspot.com/2009/03/blog-post_5272.html[/tpl]

==Career==

===Work in Media===

Before joining Al Jazeera, Al-Qassem worked for the BBC Arabic Radio and TV for over eight years as producer and anchor of political and cultural programs.

===The Opposite Direction===

"The Opposite Direction" is regarded as probably the most controversial talk show in the history of Arab television. It is also one of the most popular, and has drawn official protest and complaints from officials. It is similar to CNN's Crossfire, and is a political debate show that features guests who hold opposing opinions and debate a controversial topic. Hugh Miles writes in his book on Al-Jazeera "the show has been the source of numerous international disputes and instigated the severance of diplomatic relations with several neighboring countries."[tpl]cite web|last=Amy Goodman & Juan González|title=Democracy Now! in Doha...

Dr. Faisal Al-Qassem prepares the show himself, researching, writing, and presenting it single-handedly. Through it, he has become one of the most famous faces in the Arab World.[tpl]cite web|last=Amy Goodman & Juan González|title=Democracy Now! in Doha...

Al-Qassem's program has led to diplomatic crises between the state of Qatar, where Al Jazeera is based, and several Arab countries, five of which withdrew their ambassadors from Doha in protest over the program.Tayler, Jeffrey. "The Faisal factor: a talk-show host on al-Jazeera targets those he believes are the worst enemies the Arabs have: themselves.(Brief Lives)." The Atlantic Monthly 294.4 (Nov 2004): 41(3).
Faisal Al-Qassem has stated that his mission is to liberate the Arab World from dictatorship, despots, and traditions. He believes that Al-Jazeera and his show have been successful in doing that.[tpl]cite web|last=Amy Goodman & Juan González|title=Democracy Now! in Doha...

==Views & Criticisms==

Al-Qassem has been viewed in many cases as a big supporter of the 2011 Arab revolutions, by fueling them and spreading awareness through his show "The Opposite Direction".  His colleague and friend, Yahya Abo-Zakariya, describes the introductory scenes of the show presented by Al-Qassem as more like revolution statements,  backed up with dramatic music effects that made them sound very powerful. The show became a fuel to the revolutions, and has allowed the accumulation of awareness on revolt and public awakening which in turn played a part in creating a situation of Arab revolt against the current situation.[tpl]cite web|last=أبوزكريا|first=يحيى|title=أنا وفيصل القاسم والثورات العربية|url=http://www.almothaqaf.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=44056:2011-02-12-13-27-41&catid=36:2009-05-21-01-46-14&Itemid=54[/tpl]
Nonetheless, Al-Qassem has been widely criticized by various people for different reasons. He has been criticized for his selection of guests, such as for the episode on the alleged terrorist armed gangs of Syria, where he hosted a military personality to debate with a Lebanese author, where the military personality was viewed as incompetent and unappropriate for such a debate.[tpl]cite web|title=هجوم على فيصل القاسم بعد حلقة الجماعات المسلحة|url=http://www.kurdonline.info/news_detail.php?id=8769[/tpl]
In addition, a Syrian blogger has criticized and attacked him, describing him as sectarian due to his selection of pro-regime guests only from the Christian sect to debate with opposition figures mainly from the Muslim-Sunni sect, accusing him of trying to give the revolution a sectarian appearance.[tpl]cite web|last=Al-Soori|first=George|title=مسيحيون سوريون ضد الطائفي فيصل القاسم|url=http://the-syrian.com/archives/65567[/tpl]
Also, Al-Qassem's statements that described the Yemeni people as drunks due to their high percentage of qat drug addiction raised a huge amount of criticism on him and his show among Yemenis. Some have even demanded a public apology from him for insulting the Yemeni people.[tpl]cite web|last=الراجحي|first=عدنان|title=جدل واسع حول فيصل القاسم بعد وصف اليمنيين بـ" السكارى"|url=http://www.barakish.net/news.aspx?cat=12&sub=12&id=27025|publisher=براقش نت[/tpl]
Al-Qassem has declared his support, on November 20th 2013, to attacks by Alqaida onto the Iranian Embassy in Beirut. He said"#فيصل_القاسم "من يلعب بالنار يحرق أصابيعه". This opinion faced an uproar in internet communities.
