Karl Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (Meiningen, 18 July 1712 â€“ Meiningen, 28 March 1743), was a duke of Saxe-Meiningen.
He was the fourth but third surviving son of Ernst Ludwig I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen and his first wife, Dorothea Marie of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.
Karl Frederick inherited the duchy of Saxe-Meiningen when his father died in 1724, along with his older brother, Ernst Ludwig II, under the guardianship of his uncles Frederick Wilhelm and Anton Ulrich until 1733.
When his older brother died unmarried in 1729, Karl Frederick ruled alone until his death.
Like his brother, he never married, and, after his death, was succeeded by his uncle, Frederick Wilhelm.
