Ray Frank Gricar ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|r|iː|k|ɑr[/tpl]; born October 9, 1945, missing April 15, 2005, declared legally dead July 25, 2011) was an American attorney who served as the district attorney of Centre County, Pennsylvania, from 1985 until 2005. On April 15, 2005, Gricar went missing under mysterious circumstances and has not been heard from since.
Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Gricar received his Juris Doctor degree from Case Western Reserve University School of Law and began his career as a prosecutor for Cuyahoga County. He moved to State College, Pennsylvania, around 1980 and after a brief stint as an assistant district attorney, Gricar was elected district attorney of Centre County in 1985. He was re-elected four times before announcing that he would not run for re-election in the 2005 campaign.
Gricar was reported missing to authorities after failing to return home from a road trip. His car was found in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, with his cell phone inside, and his laptop computer was found in the adjacent Susquehanna River; other than that, very little trace of Gricar has been found. When he had been missing for over six years with no trace of his whereabouts, Centre County authorities declared Gricar legally dead on July 25, 2011.

==Early life and career==

Gricar was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and grew up in the city's Collinwood neighborhood.[tpl]cite book|last=Renner|first=James|title=The Serial Killer's Apprentice: And 12 Other True Stories of Cleveland's Most Intriguing Unsolved Crimes|year=2008|publisher=Gray & Company|isbn=1-59851-046-0|pages=51–64|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LcLBGdkLI0EC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] He attended high school at the Gilmour Academy, a prestigious Catholic school in Gates Mills. Gricar went on to attend the University of Dayton, where he became interested in studying law after working as an intern for the prosecutor's office. After graduating, he moved back to Cleveland to study law at Case Western Reserve University School of Law. He obtained his Juris Doctor and subsequently took a job as a prosecutor for Cuyahoga County, specializing in prosecuting cases of rape and murder.[tpl]cite news|title=Ray Gricar, Curriculum Vita|url=http://www.centredaily.com/2009/06/11/2396902/ray-gricar-curriculum-vita.html|accessdate=March 30, 2011|date=June 11, 2009[/tpl]
Gricar moved to State College, Pennsylvania, around 1980, when his wife took a job at Pennsylvania State University ("Penn State"). He opted to become a stay-at-home dad to his young daughter following the move; however, when news spread that a prosecutor was living in the area, Centre County District Attorney David E. Grine offered Gricar an assistant position, which he accepted. In 1985, the incumbent district attorney, Robert Mix (Grine's successor), chose not to run for re-election, and Gricar ran for the open position. He won the election by a margin of 600 votes.
A part-time job when he was first elected, Gricar successfully campaigned to make the Centre County DA job a full-time one in 1996.[tpl]cite news|title=Police search by land and air for Centre County prosecutor|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=in4xAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QKMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5789,304024&dq=ray+gricar&hl=en|accessdate=March 30, 2011|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=April 17, 2005[/tpl] He was re-elected as DA in 1989, 1993, 1997 and 2001. During his tenure as DA, Gricar prosecuted the perpetrator of the 1996 Hetzel Union Building shooting at Penn State.[tpl]cite news|last=Fiore|first=Mark|title=Woman charged in PSU murder|url=http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/node/8165|accessdate=March 30, 2011|newspaper=The Daily Pennsylvanian|date=September 19, 1996[/tpl] In 1998, Gricar declined to press charges against longtime Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky following allegations of sexual abuse;[tpl]cite news|last=Ganim|first=Sara|title=Penn State Scandal: Gricar had final say in ending inquiry|url=http://www.centredaily.com/2011/11/06/2976046/gricar-had-final-say-in-ending.html|accessdate=November 8, 2011|newspaper=Centre Daily Times|date=November 6, 2011|location=State College, Pennsylvania[/tpl] 13 years later, in 2011, Sandusky was arrested and charged by the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office on multiple counts of child sexual abuse. In 2004, Gricar announced he would not run for re-election and would retire from both the DA job and as a practicing attorney in December 2005, shortly after his 60th birthday.

===Personal life===

Gricar met Barbara Gray during his undergraduate study at the University of Dayton. She moved to Cleveland with him after graduation and they married in 1969. They adopted a baby girl, Lara, in 1978. Ray and Barbara Gricar divorced in 1991; Ray married again in 1996, but divorced his second wife in 2001.[tpl]cite news|last=Reed Ward|first=Paula|title=Mystery surrounds missing Centre County DA|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05109/490420-85.stm|accessdate=March 30, 2011|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=April 19, 2005[/tpl] In 2002 or 2003 Gricar moved in with his girlfriend, Patty Fornicola, an employee of the Centre County District Attorney's office.  He was living with Fornicola in her childhood home in Bellefonte at the time of his disappearance.
Ray Gricar's older brother, Roy, disappeared from his West Chester, Ohio, home in May 1996. His body was found a week later in the Great Miami River; authorities ruled his death a suicide.

==Disappearance==

At 11:30 a.m. (EDT) on April 15, 2005, Gricar called Fornicola to inform her that he was driving through the Brush Valley area northeast of Centre Hall.[tpl]cite news|last=Ganim|first=Sara|title=Gricar disappearance at 5 years: Trail growing cold|url=http://www.centredaily.com/2010/04/15/1915225/trail-growing-cold.html|accessdate=March 30, 2011|newspaper=Centre Daily Times|date=April 15, 2010|location=State College, Pennsylvania[/tpl] Fornicola reported Gricar missing 12 hours later when he failed to return home.
Gricar's car, a red MINI Cooper, was discovered the following day in an antique store parking lot in Lewisburg.[tpl]cite news|title=Expanded search gives no clues on missing Centre County DA|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jH4xAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QKMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3826,3070043&dq=ray+gricar+car&hl=en|accessdate=April 11, 2011|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=April 19, 2005[/tpl] His county-issued cell phone was inside, but his laptop computer, keys and wallet were missing, and there were no signs of foul play. Police and family members noted that the location where the vehicle was found—adjacent to two bridges over the Susquehanna River—bore some similarities to the location where the vehicle of Roy Gricar, Ray Gricar's older brother, was located before his body was found in the Great Miami River in Ohio in 1996.
Authorities searched the river and its banks in the days following the vehicle's discovery, but found no sign of Gricar. Pennsylvania authorities asked the FBI to analyze Gricar's bank accounts, credit card records and cell phone records, but found no clues as to where he may have been.
On July 30, 2005, fishermen discovered Gricar's county-issued laptop computer in the Susquehanna River beneath a bridge between Lewisburg and Milton.[tpl]cite news|last=Ward|first=Paula Reed|title=Missing DA's laptop found|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iZYNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8XADAAAAIBAJ&pg=5334,210533&dq=ray+gricar+laptop&hl=en|accessdate=April 11, 2011|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=August 2, 2005|pages=B-1, B-2[/tpl] A Pennsylvania State Police computer expert analyzed the computer and found that its hard drive was missing. Divers searched the area of the river near where the laptop was found over the next several days, but found nothing else. Two months later, a hard drive was recovered on the banks of the Susquehanna River about [tpl]convert|100|yd|m[/tpl] from where the laptop was found and is believed to be Gricar's;[tpl]cite web|title=Missing DA's Hard Drive Found|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&id=3575298|publisher=WPVI-TV|accessdate=April 11, 2011|location=Philadelphia|date=October 26, 2005[/tpl] however, it was badly damaged, and analysis by the FBI, U.S. Secret Service and the firm Kroll Ontrack—which had successfully recovered data from a hard drive recovered from the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster—were all unable to recover any data from the hard drive.[tpl]cite news|last=Ganim|first=Sara|title=Gricar hard drive yields no clues|url=http://www.centredaily.com/2008/09/23/857207/gricar-hard-drive-yields-no-clues.html|accessdate=April 11, 2011|newspaper=Centre Daily Times|date=September 23, 2008|location=State College, Pennsylvania[/tpl] In April 2009, Bellefonte police revealed that before his disappearance, someone had used the home computer at Gricar's residence to perform internet searches on topics such as "how to wreck a hard drive", "how to fry a hard drive" and "water damage to a notebook computer".[ref][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.centredaily.com/2011/07/06/2818532/family-seeks-closure.html#wgt=rcntnews[/tpl]

Gricar's disappearance has been the subject of at least two television documentaries: an episode of Haunting Evidence first aired on Court TV in June 2006, and an episode of Disappeared first aired on Investigation Discovery in February 2011.[tpl]cite web |url=http://investigation.discovery.com/tv/disappeared/the-missing/ray-gricar.html |title=Ray Gricar |accessdate=2011-04-10[/tpl] Additionally, an episode of CBS' Without a Trace featured Gricar's missing person information.[tpl]cite web|title=Missing D.A.

On June 30, 2011, Lara Gricar, Ray's daughter and trustee of his estate, petitioned Centre County for a court declaration of presumed death.[tpl]cite news|last=White|first=Cliff|url=http://www.centredaily.com/2011/07/06/2818532/family-seeks-closure.html |title=Judge asked to declare ex-DA ‘legally dead’|newspaper=Centre Daily Times|location=State College, Pennsylvania|date=July 6, 2011 |accessdate=July 6, 2011[/tpl] County President Judge David E.

A day after Gricar was declared legally dead, a man resembling Gricar was arrested on a misdemeanor charge in Utah and refused to reveal his identity to police.  The "John Doe" was the same height and weight as Gricar and shared similar lips and some wrinkles with Gricar.[tpl]cite news| last = Ganim| first = Sara| title = Utah detainee isn't Gricar, but look-alikes are considered good for investigations| newspaper = The Patriot-News| date = July 27, 2011| url = http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2011/07/utah_detainee_isnt_gricar_but.html| accessdate = 2011-11-20[/tpl]  Further, the man's fingerprints triggered no match.[tpl]cite news | last = Ganim| first =Sara| title = Could this be Ray Gricar?
