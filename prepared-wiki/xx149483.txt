Baron Vavasour is an abeyant title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1299 by writ of summons  for William le Vavasour, who fought alongside Edward I at the Battle of Falkirk. The third baron was never called to Parliament, nor were any of his successors and the title became abeyant on the death of the de jure 25th baron in 1826.
