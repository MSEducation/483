[[Vinegar]]

CATEGORIES: Vinegar, Condiments, Traditional medicine

Vinegar is a liquid consisting mainly of acetic acid (CH3COOH) and water. The acetic acid is produced by the fermentation of ethanol by acetic acid bacteria.http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/9/1217.extract vinegar Studies on acetic acid-bacteria Retrieved Oct. 21, 2011. Vinegar is now mainly used as a cooking ingredient, but historically, as the most easily available mild acid, it had a great variety of industrial, medical, and domestic uses, some of which (such as a general household cleanser) are still promoted today.
Commercial vinegar is produced either by fast or slow fermentation processes. In general, slow methods are used with traditional vinegars, and fermentation proceeds slowly over the course of months or a year. The longer fermentation period allows for the accumulation of a nontoxic slime composed of acetic acid bacteria.  Fast methods add mother of vinegar (i.e., bacterial culture) to the source liquid before adding air using a venturi pump system or a turbine to promote oxygenation to obtain the fastest fermentation. In fast production processes, vinegar may be produced in a period ranging from 20 hours to three days.

==Varieties==

===Apple cider===

Apple cider vinegar is made from cider or apple must, and has a brownish-gold color. It is often sold unfiltered and unpasteurized with the mother of vinegar present, as a natural product. Because of its acidity, apple cider vinegar may be very harsh, even burning, to the throat.[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl] It is often diluted with fruit juice or water,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.theglobalindian.co.nz/apple-cider-vinegar-weight-loss/|title=Why Apple Cider Vinegar Is So Good For Weight Loss[/tpl] and/or sweetened (usually with honey) for consumption as a health beverage.Sejo Regular del Vino y Brandy de Jerez (Council regulating the production of Jerez wine and braef

===Balsamic===

Balsamic vinegar is an aromatic aged vinegar produced in the Modena and Reggio Emilia provinces of Italy.  The original product[tpl]emdash[/tpl]Traditional Balsamic Vinegar[tpl]emdash[/tpl]is made from the concentrated juice, or must of white Trebbiano grapes. It is very dark brown, rich, sweet, and complex, with the finest grades being aged in successive casks made variously of oak, mulberry, chestnut, cherry, juniper, ash, and acacia wood. Originally a costly product available to only the Italian upper classes, traditional balsamic vinegar is marked "tradizionale" or "DOC" to denote its Protected Designation of Origin status, and is aged for 12 to 25 years. A cheaper non-DOC commercial form described as "aceto balsamico di Modena" (balsamic vinegar of Modena)BBC: GoodFood: Balsmaic vinegar became widely known and available around the world in the late 20th century, typically made with concentrated grape juice mixed with a strong vinegar, then coloured and slightly sweetened with caramel and sugar.
Regardless of how it is produced, balsamic vinegar must be made from a grape product. It contains no balsam fruit. A high acidity level is somewhat hidden by the sweetness of the other ingredients, making it very mellow.

===Beer===

Vinegar made from beer is produced in the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands. Although its flavor depends on the particular type of beer from which it is made, it is often described as having a malty taste. That produced in Bavaria is a light golden color with a very sharp and not-overly-complex flavor.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl]

===Cane===

Cane vinegar, made from sugarcane juice, is most popular in the Philippines, in particular, the Ilocos Region of the northern Philippines (where it is called sukang iloko), although it also is produced in France and the United States. It ranges from dark yellow to golden brown in color, and has a mellow flavor, similar in some respects to rice vinegar, though with a somewhat "fresher" taste. Because it contains no residual sugar, it is no sweeter than any other vinegar. In the Philippines, it often is labeled as sukang maasim (Tagalog for "sour vinegar").
Cane vinegars from Ilocos are made in two different ways. One way is to simply place sugar cane juice in large jars and it will directly become sour by the direct action of bacteria on the sugar. The other way is through fermentation to produce a local wine known as 'basi'. Low quality 'basi' is then allowed to undergo acetic acid fermentation that converts alcohol into acetic acid. Contaminated 'basi' also become vinegar.
A white variation has become quite popular in Brazil in recent years, where it is the cheapest type of vinegar sold. It is now common for other types of vinegar (made from wine, rice and apple cider) to be sold mixed with cane vinegar to lower the costs.

===Coconut===

Coconut vinegar, made from fermented coconut water, is used extensively in Southeast Asian cuisine (particularly in the Philippines and Sri Lanka,  major producers, where it is called suka ng niyog or vinakiri), as well as in some cuisines of India, especially Goan cuisine. A cloudy white liquid, it has a particularly sharp, acidic taste with a slightly yeasty note.

===Date===

Vinegar made from dates is a traditional product of the Middle East.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ie50319a016 | title = Vinegar from Dates | year = 1936 | last1 = Das | first1 = Bhagwan | last2 = Sarin | first2 = J.

===Distilled===

The term "distilled vinegar" is something of a misnomer, because it is not produced by distillation but by fermentation of distilled alcohol. The fermentate is then diluted to produce a colorless solution of 5% to 8% acetic acid in water, with a pH of about 2.4. This is variously known as distilled spirit, "virgin" vinegar,Allgeier RJ et al., Newer Developments in Vinegar Manufacture, 1960 ("manufacture of white or spirit vinegar"), in Umbreit WW, Advances in Microbiology: Volume 2, Elsevier/Academic Press Inc., ISBN 0-12-002602-3, accessed at Google Books 2009-04-22[tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] or white vinegar, and is used in cooking, baking, meat preservation, and pickling, as well as  medicinal, laboratory, and cleaning purposes.Sinclair C, International Dictionary of Food and Cooking, Peter Collin Publishing, 1998 ISBN 0-948549-87-4[tpl]Page needed|date=September 2010[/tpl] The most common starting material in some regions, because of its low cost, is malt; in the United States, corn (maize), such as the Heinz brand.[tpl]cite web|title=Vinegar 101|url=http://www.heinzvinegar.com/vinegar-101.aspx|publisher=Heinz|accessdate=10 June 2012[/tpl] It is sometimes derived from petroleum.http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074550.htm

===East Asian black===

Chinese black vinegar is an aged product made from rice, wheat, millet, sorghum, or a combination thereof.  It has an inky black color and a complex, malty flavor. There is no fixed recipe, so some Chinese black vinegars may contain added sugar, spices, or caramel color. The most popular variety, Zhenjiang vinegar, originates in the city of Zhenjiang in Jiangsu Province, eastern China.AsianWeek.com[tpl]Dead link|date=March 2010[/tpl] Shanxi aged vinegar (山西老陈醋) is another popular type of Chinese vinegar that is made exclusively from sorghum.
A somewhat lighter form of black vinegar, made from rice, is produced in Japan, where it is called kurozu.  Since 2004, it has been marketed as a healthful drink; its manufacturers claim it contains high concentrations of amino acids. Recent research on kurozu has revealed its anticancer properties in vivo on rats.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Shimoji |first1=Yumi |last2=Kohno |first2=Hiroyuki |last3=Nanda |first3=Kumiko |last4=Nishikawa |first4=Yasushi |last5=Ohigashi |first5=Hajime |last6=Uenakai |first6=Kazuo |last7=Tanaka |first7=Takuji |title=Extract of Kurosu, a Vinegar From Unpolished Rice, Inhibits Azoxymethane-Induced Colon Carcinogenesis in Male F344 Rats |journal=Nutrition and Cancer |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=170–3 |year=2004 |pmid=15489210 |doi=10.1207/s15327914nc4902_8[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Fukuyama |first1=N |last2=Jujo |first2=S |last3=Ito |first3=I |last4=Shizuma |first4=T |last5=Myojin |first5=K |last6=Ishiwata |first6=K |last7=Nagano |first7=M |last8=Nakazawa |first8=H |last9=Mori |first9=H |title=Kurozu moromimatsu inhibits tumor growth of Lovo cells in a mouse model in vivo |journal=Nutrition |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=81–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17189090 |doi=10.1016/j.nut.2006.10.004|display-authors=9 [/tpl] and in vitro on human cancer cells.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Nanda |first1=K |last2=Miyoshi |first2=N |last3=Nakamura |first3=Y |last4=Shimoji |first4=Y |last5=Tamura |first5=Y |last6=Nishikawa |first6=Y |last7=Uenakai |first7=K |last8=Kohno |first8=H |last9=Tanaka |first9=T |title=Extract of vinegar "Kurosu" from unpolished rice inhibits the proliferation of human cancer cells |journal=Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=69–75 |year=2004 |pmid=15149153|display-authors=9 [/tpl]

===Fruit===

Fruit vinegars are made from fruit wines, usually without any additional flavoring. Common flavors of fruit vinegar include apple, blackcurrant, raspberry, quince, and tomato. Typically, the flavors of the original fruits remain in the final product.
Most fruit vinegars are produced in Europe, where there is a growing market for high-price vinegars made solely from specific fruits (as opposed to non-fruit vinegars that are infused with fruits or fruit flavors). Several varieties, however, also are produced in Asia. Persimmon vinegar, called gam sikcho (감식초), is popular in South Korea. Jujube vinegar, called zaocu or hongzaocu ([tpl]zh|s=枣醋 / 红枣醋|t=棗醋 / 紅棗醋[/tpl]), and wolfberry vinegar, called gouqicu ([tpl]zh|c=枸杞醋[/tpl]), are produced in China.
Jamun sirka (Hindi: जामुन सिरका), a vinegar produced from the jamun fruit in India, is considered to be medicinally valuable for stomach, spleen, and diabetic ailments.[tpl]Cite book | title=Handbook On Ayurvedic Medicines With Formulae, Processes And Their Uses | author=H.

===Honey===

Vinegar made from honey is rare, although commercially available honey vinegars are produced in Italy, France, Romania, and Spain.

===Job's tears===

In Japan, an aged vinegar also is made from Job's tears, a tall, grain-bearing, tropical plant. The vinegar is similar in flavor to rice vinegar.

===Kiwifruit===

A byproduct of commercial kiwifruit growing is a large amount of waste in the form of, first, misshapen or otherwise-rejected fruit that may constitute up to 30 percent of the crop and, second, kiwifruit pomace, which is the presscake residue left after kiwifruit juice manufacture. One of the uses for this waste is the production of kiwifruit vinegar, produced commercially in New Zealand.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.apctt.org/publication/pdf/tm_dec_biotechnz.pdf |title=Biotechnology in New Zealand |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-15[/tpl] since, at least, the early 1990s, and in China in 2008.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.versatilevinegar.org/latestnews_2008_12.html |title=The Vinegar Institute |publisher=Versatilevinegar.org |date=2008-10-20 |accessdate=2010-03-15[/tpl]

===Kombucha===

Kombucha vinegar is made from kombucha, a symbiotic culture of yeast and bacteria. The bacteria produce a complex array of nutrients and populate the vinegar with bacteria that some claim promote a healthy digestive tract, although no scientific studies have confirmed this. Kombucha vinegar primarily is used to make a vinaigrette, and is flavored by adding strawberries, blackberries, mint, or blueberries at the beginning of fermentation.

===Malt===

Malt vinegar, also called Alegar, is made by malting barley, causing the starch in the grain to turn to maltose. Then an ale is brewed from the maltose and allowed to turn into vinegar, which is then aged. It is typically light-brown in color.
In the United Kingdom, salt and malt vinegar is a traditional seasoning for fish and chips, but some commercial fish and chip shops will use non-brewed condiment.

===Palm===

Palm vinegar, made from the fermented sap from flower clusters of the nipa palm (also called attap palm), is used most often in the Philippines, where it is produced, and where it is called sukang paombong. Its pH is between five and six.

===Raisin===

Vinegar made from raisins, called [tpl]transl|ar|ALA-LC|khall ʻinab[/tpl] ([tpl]lang-ar|خل عنب[/tpl] "grape vinegar") is used in cuisines of the Middle East, and is produced there. It is cloudy and medium brown in color, with a mild flavor.

===Rice===

Rice vinegar is most popular in the cuisines of East and Southeast Asia. It is available in "white" (light yellow), red, and black varieties. The Japanese prefer a light rice vinegar for the preparation of sushi rice and salad dressings. Red rice vinegar traditionally is colored with red yeast rice. Black rice vinegar (made with black glutinous rice) is most popular in China, and it is also widely used in other East Asian countries.
White rice vinegar has a mild acidity with a somewhat "flat" and uncomplex flavor. Some varieties of rice vinegar are sweetened or otherwise seasoned with spices or other added flavorings.

===Sherry===

Sherry vinegar is linked to the production of sherrywines of Jerez. Dark-mahogany in color, it is made exclusively from the acetic fermentation of  wines.  It is concentrated and has generous aromas, including a note of wood, ideal for vinaigrettes and flavoring various foods.

===Spirit===

The term 'spirit vinegar' is sometimes reserved for the stronger variety (5% to 20% acetic acid) made from sugar caneEllsey's, Products. Retrieved 2009-04-22. or from chemically produced acetic acid.

===White===

See Distilled vinegar.

===Wine===

Wine vinegar is made from red or white wine, and is the most commonly used vinegar in Southern and Central Europe. As with wine, there is a considerable range in quality. Better-quality wine vinegars are matured in wood for up to two years, and exhibit a complex, mellow flavor. Wine vinegar tends to have a lower acidity than white or cider vinegars. More expensive wine vinegars are made from individual varieties of wine, such as champagne, sherry, or pinot gris.

==Uses==

===Culinary===

Vinegar is commonly used in food preparation, in particular in pickling processes, vinaigrettes, and other salad dressings. It is an ingredient in sauces such as mustard, ketchup, and mayonnaise. Vinegar is sometimes used while making chutneys. It is often used as a condiment. Marinades often contain vinegar. In terms of its shelf life, vinegar's acidic nature allows it to last indefinitely without the use of refrigeration.[tpl]cite web|title=Shelf Life of Vinegar|url=http://www.eatbydate.com/other/condiments/how-long-does-vinegar-last/|publisher=Eatbydate.com[/tpl]

====Beverage====

Several beverages are made using vinegar, for instance Posca. Other preparations range from simply mixing sugar water or honey water with small amounts of fruity vinegar to making syrup by laying fruit or mint in vinegar essence for several days, then sieving off solid parts, and adding considerable amounts of sugar. Some prefer to also boil the result as a final step. These recipes have lost much of their popularity with the rise of carbonated beverages, such as soft drinks.

===Medical===

Many remedies and treatments have been ascribed to vinegar over millennia and in many different cultures; however, few have been verifiable using controlled medical trials and many that are effective to some degree have significant side-effects and carry the possibility of serious health risks.[tpl]cite journal |first1=Carol S. |last1=Johnston |first2=Cindy A. |last2=Gaas |title=Vinegar: medicinal uses and antiglycemic effect |journal=MedGenMed |volume=8 |issue=2 |page=61 |year=2006 |pmid=16926800 |pmc=1785201 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/531649[/tpl]

====Possible cholesterol and triacylglycerol effects====

A 2006 study concluded that a test group of rats fed with acetic acid (the main component of vinegar) had "significantly lower values for serum total cholesterol and triacylglycerol" and other health benefits.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Fushimi |first1=Takashi |last2=Suruga |first2=Kazuhito |last3=Oshima |first3=Yoshifumi |last4=Fukiharu |first4=Momoko |last5=Tsukamoto |first5=Yoshinori |last6=Goda |first6=Toshinao |title=Dietary acetic acid reduces serum cholesterol and triacylglycerols in rats feda cholesterol-rich diet |journal=British Journal of Nutrition |volume=95 |issue=5 |pages=916–24 |year=2006 |pmid=16611381 |doi=10.1079/BJN20061740[/tpl] Rats fed vinegar or acetic acid have lower blood pressure than controls, although the effect has not been tested in humans. Reduced risk of fatal ischemic heart disease was observed among human participants in a trial who ate vinegar and oil salad dressings frequently.

====Blood glucose control and diabetic management====

Prior to hypoglycemic agents, diabetics used vinegar teas to control their symptoms. Small amounts of vinegar (approximately 25g of domestic vinegar) added to food, or taken along with a meal, have been shown by a number of medical trials to reduce the glycemic index of carbohydrate food for people with and without diabetes.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Liljeberg |first1=H |last2=Björck |first2=I |title=Delayed gastric emptying rate may explain improved glycaemia in healthy subjects to a starchy meal with added vinegar |journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=368–71 |year=1998 |pmid=9630389 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1600572[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Leeman |first1=M |last2=Ostman |first2=E |last3=Björck |first3=I |title=Vinegar dressing and cold storage of potatoes lowers postprandial glycaemic and insulinaemic responses in healthy subjects |journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=59 |issue=11 |pages=1266–71 |year=2005 |pmid=16034360 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602238[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Johnston |first1=C.

====Antimicrobial and medicinal====

Vinegar was thought to be useful for treating infections in ancient times. Hippocrates (460–377 BC) prescribed it for curing pleurisy, fever, ulcers, and constipation; it was used by the ancient Egyptians to kill bacteria. When combined with honey to create oxymel, it was a common cough medicine in the ancient world. Vinegar also had multiple uses in ancient Babylon, where it was made from wine beginning around 5000 BC. The Babylonians used vinegar to preserve food and as a component of medicines.[tpl]cite book |title = The 100 Most Important Chemical Compounds: A Reference Guide |last = Myers |first = Richard L. |year = 2007 |isbn = 9780313080579 |publisher = Greenwood[/tpl]

====Other medicinal====

Applying vinegar to common jellyfish stings deactivates the nematocysts; however, placing the affected areas in hot water is a more effective treatment because the venom is deactivated by heat.

Water-slide decal application as used on scale models, musical instruments, etc. One part white distilled vinegar (5% acidity) diluted with two parts of distilled/filtered water creates a suitable solution for the application of water-slide decals to hard surfaces. The solution is very similar to the commercial products, often described as "decal softener", sold by hobby shops.  The slight acidity of the solution softens the decal and enhances its flexibility, permitting the decal to cling to contours more efficiently.
