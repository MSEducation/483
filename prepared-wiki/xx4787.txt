==Features==

Irssi is written in the C programming language and in normal operation uses a text-mode user interface.[tpl]cite web|first=Vincent |last=Danen |work=TechRepublic |date=May 5, 2008  |title=Try IRC with Irssi to communicate via chat |publisher=ZDnetAsia.com |accessdate=2010-10-18|url=http://www.zdnetasia.com/techguide/opensource/0,39044899,62040926,00.htm[/tpl]
According to the developers, Irssi was written from scratch, not based on ircII (like BitchX and epic). This freed the developers from having to deal with the constraints of an existing codebase, allowing them to maintain tighter control over issues such as security and customization. Numerous modules and Perl scripts have been made available for Irssi to customise how it looks and operates.[ref]
