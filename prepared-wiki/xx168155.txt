Samuel Faulknor (d. 5 October 1744) was the son of William Faulknor. He commanded the 100-gun  ship [tpl]HMS|Britannia|1682|2[/tpl] in 1736, and also the 100-gun [tpl]HMS|Royal Sovereign|1701|2[/tpl] before being appointed commander of the [tpl]HMS|Victory|1737|2[/tpl], flagship of Admiral Sir John Norris, in early 1741. On 28 July 1744 Victory sailed with a fleet of British and Dutch ships from St. Helen's for Lisbon. During the voyage they captured six French ships. On 3 October the fleet was dispersed in a gale, and on the next night Victory was lost with her entire crew. It was believed that Victory struck the Casquets rocks off Alderney, but in 2009 a wreck identified as Victory was found by Odyssey Marine Exploration nearly 62 miles from where the ship was supposed to have sunk.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/science/03shipwreck.html?hp|title=Company Says It's Found 1744 Wreck of Famed British Warship |first=William J. |last=Broad |work=The New York Times |date=2 February 2009  |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=25 April 2011[/tpl]
