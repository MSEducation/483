Keig Parish Church is set in the grounds of a churchyard, which continues to be the final resting place for many who have family ties (or indeed other connections) with the area. The church was saved from being sold off as a private dwelling in the early 2000s (decade), thanks to a group, the Friends of Keig Kirk, which supports the church to this day.http://www.presbyteryofgordon.org.uk/Church%20Trails/Howe%20Trinity/2009%20Howe_Trinity%20Trail.htmlhttp://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/clubs/detail.asp?keyOrganisation=927

In February 2010 the bridge was closed to traffic by Aberdeenshire Council amid fears of structural damage caused by the harsh winter conditions experienced at the end of 2009 and the early part of 2010.http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1605162http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-10738174 Having undertaken major strengthening and repair work, Aberdeenshire Council reopened Keig Bridge on 18 September 2010.http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/news/release.asp?newsID=1762
