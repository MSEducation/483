Sonoma Plaza is the central plaza in the former town of Sonoma (pueblo de Sonoma, in spanish), now known as Sonoma, California.  The town is centered around this plaza,  the largest plaza in California. This plaza is surrounded by many historical buildings, including the Mission San Francisco Solano, Captain Salvador Vallejo's Casa Grande, the Presidio of Sonoma, the Blue Wing Inn, and the Toscano Hotel.  In the middle of the plaza, Sonoma's early 20th-century city hall, at the plaza's center and still in use, was designed and built with four identical sides in order not to offend the merchants on any one side of the plaza. The plaza is a National Historic Landmark and still serves as the town's focal point, hosting many community festivals and drawing tourists all year round.  It provides a central tourist attraction.  It is also the location of the Farmer's Market, held every Tuesday in the summer. Sonoma City Hall was dedicated in 1908.
This location was where the Bear Flag Revolt took place in 1846, which led to the Mexican-American War.[tpl]Cite web | last =  Cox | first = Robert A. | title = Sonoma Plaza | work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | publisher = National Park Service | date = August 1, 1973 | url = http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/75000489.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 25 May 2012[/tpl]
"For many years, the site in Sonoma Plaza where the bear flag originally had been raised went unmarked. Largely through the efforts of the Native Sons of the Golden West, the legislature appropriated $5,000 for a monument to be placed there.  The Native Sons of the Golden West raised $500 to prepare the site, put on dedication ceremonies, and to move the huge rock that serves as the pedestal from a mile away."Native Sons of the Golden West, Richard Kimball & Barney Noel
