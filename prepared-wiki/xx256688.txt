Emily Quihampton (19 July 1834 â€“ 29 March 1909) was a 19th-century outdoor enthusiast who was the first woman to climb Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa in the same week. These peaks are the highest mountains in France and Switzerland. In his autobiography, Life's a pudding, her son Guy Nickalls says this was in 1868. If this is correct, she would have been pregnant at the time as she gave birth to a daughter, Grace in October 1868.Guy Nickalls Life's a pudding: an autobiography 1939
