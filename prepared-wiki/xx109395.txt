Kirby's Star Stacker is a 1997 puzzle video game developed by HAL Laboratory for the Game Boy.  This game is Kirby's first puzzle game that is not a clone of an existing title.
It received a remake for the Super Famicom in Japan under the name Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu (roughly translated to Kirby's Sparkling Kids). The Japanese version of Kirby's Star Stacker on the Game Boy is also known as Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu.

==Gameplay==

Kirby Star Stacker is similar in many respects to other puzzle games that were around at the time of its release, most notably, Dr. Mario and Tetris The goal of the game is to earn  as many stars possible by matching pairs blocks, (also referred to as friends in-game) that fall from the top of the play area. There are three types of blocks, all based on Kirby's friends from Kirby's Dream Land 2: Rick the hamster, Coo the owl, and Kine the fish. Stars are scored by sandwiching the stars between two matching blocks. When stars are scored, they disappear from the play area along with the pair of blocks enclosing them. The game is lost when the falling blocks reach the top of the play area, so it is critical to eliminate as many blocks as possible by scoring stars.

===Gameplay modes===

There are four game modes in Star Stacker.
There is a high score table for the Challenge and Time Attack modes, showing the top three scores for each mode.

==Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu==

Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu (カービィのきらきらきっず - Kirby's Sparkling Kids), also commonly referred to as Kirby's Super Star Stacker, is a video game released in 1998 for the SNES. Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu is an SNES remake of Kirby's Star Stacker with nearly identical gameplay. The point of the game is to remove falling star blocks by placing matching animal friends (Rick, Coo, and Kine) at either end. One of the primary enhancements is story mode, in which Kirby faces several opponents from other Kirby games (mostly from Kirby Super Star). The game's title is exactly the same as the Japanese title of the Game Boy version of Kirby's Star Stacker.
This version was released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on January 5, 2010.
