Wild Wild World is a Warner Bros. cartoon released in the Merrie Melodies series in 1960 and directed by Robert McKimson.  It's a parody of the television series Wide Wide World hosted by Dave Garroway.  In this cartoon, "Cave Darroway" presents a recently discovered film taken during the Cro-Magnon era.  The stone age gags in the "film" predate and possibly inspired The Flintstones which made its debut in 1960. The final gag in this cartoon depicts a modern elevator utilizing the primitive operational methods of the stone age elevator shown in the "film."  Because of the long lead time in producing an animated cartoon, the TV program which inspired this cartoon had already been canceled when this cartoon was released.  This cartoon is available on DVD as a bonus short on disc four of Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6.
The documentary was filmed in the "Geo-Goshical Year 75,000,000 B.C." (satirizing the International Geophysical Year 1957-'58), in breathtaking Cromagnonscope.  Cromagnonscope last appeared in the cartoon Pre-Hysterical Hare.
