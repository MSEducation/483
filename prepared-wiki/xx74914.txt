Hearts and Bones is the sixth solo album by Paul Simon. It was released in 1983.
The album was originally intended to be called Think Too Much, however Mo Ostin, president of Warner Bros. Records, persuaded Simon to change it to Hearts and Bones.[tpl]cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jQGOxvDsF-kC&pg=PA181#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Paul Simon: A Life|page=181|author= Marc Eliot |publisher=John Wiley & Sons|date= 18 Oct 2010 |accessdate=10 September 2012[/tpl] The album was written and recorded following the Simon and Garfunkel Concert in Central Park in 1981, and the world tour of 1982 - 1983. Some of the songs intended for Think Too Much were previewed on the tour, and Garfunkel worked on some of the songs with Simon in the studio,[tpl]cite journal |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fQ4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Billboard review |author=Jeffrey Perlah |journal=Billboard |date=30 May 1998 |accessdate=10 September 2012[/tpl] with an intention that the finished product would be a Simon and Garfunkel album.[tpl]cite journal |url= http://web.archive.org/web/20070930220956/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/paulsimon/albums/album/112553/review/5942599/hearts_and_bones |title=Paul Simon: Hearts And Bones : Music Reviews : Rolling Stone |author=Don Shewey |journal=Rolling Stone |date= 24 Nov 24 1983 |accessdate=10 September 2012[/tpl]  Ultimately, Garfunkel left the project early on, and none of his contributions were included in the final mix.

==Composition==

The title track is about Simon and his then girlfriend, Carrie Fisher. (It is often wrongly assumed that Fisher was his wife at the time of this composition - However, the song is copyrighted 1982 and the couple did not actually marry until August 1983),  as they travel through New Mexico ("one and one-half wandering Jews"), and also about love in general. The album also contains one of the few songs about numbers (and love) — "When Numbers Get Serious", which evokes the beginnings of the Information Age. Also unusual is "Think Too Much", actually two different songs with the same title and chorus line, dealing generally with thinking (and love).
The eighth track, René and Georgette Magritte with their Dog after the War, is a surreal song about the surrealist artist René Magritte and his wife Georgette, and fancifully suggests that they secretly admired the music of such doo-wop artists as The Penguins, The Moonglows, The Orioles, and The Five Satins. The title derives from a caption to a photograph of the Magrittes, "Rene and Georgette Magritte With Their Dog During the War". Simon changed "During" to "After" as it scanned better for the song lyric.
The last track, The Late Great Johnny Ace, is Simon's homage to John Lennon, who had been assassinated shortly before Simon wrote it. The song and its title also wistfully hark back to Johnny Ace, an early rock and roller who died from an accidental self-inflicted gunshot to the face. Simon had actually premiered the song during Simon and Garfunkel's reunion concert in Central Park; near the end of the song a fan ran onto the stage, which can be seen in the DVD of the concert. The man was dragged offstage by Simon's personnel. The man can be heard speaking to Simon, "I have to talk to you". The attack was possibly in response to Simon mentioning John Lennon in the lyrics.  The closing music of this track (an instrumental section using strings, clarinet and flute) was written by composer Philip Glass.

==Reception==

Although, in 1983, the album was considered a commercial failure and signaled a low point in Simon's career, the passage of time has been kind to the album. It's been re-examined and considered to be one of Simon's more important records and a lyrically strong one.

==Singles==

There were two songs from this album released as singles. The first single with "Allergies" as the A-side and "Think Too Much (b)" as the B-side peaked at #44 in the US Hot 100. The second single failed to chart, this being "Think Too Much (a)" (A-side) and "Song About the Moon" (B-Side).
