The Aerospace Walk of Honor in Lancaster, California, USA, honors test pilots who have contributed to aviation and space research and development. 
The Aerospace Walk of Honor awards were established in 1990 by the City of Lancaster "to recognize the important contributions of unique and talented aviators who soared above the rest." A center of the flight test community, Lancaster is located in the Antelope Valley, near four flight test facilities: US Air Force Plant 42, Edwards AFB, Mojave Spaceport and Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. 
The walk of honor is located on Lancaster Boulevard between Sierra Highway to the east and 10th Street West and is anchored by Boeing Plaza, which hosts a restored F-4 Phantom II mounted on a pylon. Honorees are memorialized with granite monuments located along Lancaster Boulevard. Test pilots who receive awards are inducted annually, in late summer.
The Walk of Honor monuments and activities are funded by several aerospace companies, including Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman, all of which perform flight test operations in the Antelope Valley.
