[[Central school]]

CATEGORIES: Education in England, School types

In the English education system, central schools were selective secondary education schools between the more prestigious grammar schools and the secondary schools. 
Central schools were first established following the 1918 Education Act.
Following the 1944 Education Act, the selection process was changed so that those who failed the 11+ but were considered clever enough to have been entered for it were able to go to central schools.
