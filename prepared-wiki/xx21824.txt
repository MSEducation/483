==History==

Badalona was founded by the Romans in the 3rd century BC, with the name of Baetulo, although human settlements in the area existed from  3500-2500 BC. The Iberians had fortified villages on the Melasas and Boscà hills since the 7th century BC. The Roman town's plan was based on their common scheme of the cardo and decumanus, occupying some 11 ha, with a line of walls measuring 413x261 m and having large defensive towers. In the 1st century BC it had some 15,000 inhabitants.
The current Badalona was formed in the 10th century, as a new urban nucleus built over and around the old Roman city.  It comprised  a group of houses built around the square and the church.  At the same time, a rural nucleus grew up outside the town walls. This rural and urban dichotomy would remain until the mid-18th century.
Sant Jeroni de la Murtra Monastery, built in the 14th century, housed the Catholic Monarchs of Spain would spend their summers.  This is also where they received Christopher Columbus after his first voyage to the Americas.
Badalona was one of the most important towns during the Spanish industrialization process, from the 19th century onwards.
Today, Badalona is in the middle of a process of major urban change which will provide one of the challenges for the 21st century.
