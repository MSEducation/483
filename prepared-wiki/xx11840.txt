==Culture==

Residents of Wisconsin are referred to as Wisconsinites. The traditional prominence of references to dairy farming and cheesemaking in Wisconsin's rural economy (the state's license plates have read "America's Dairyland" since 1940Christopulos, Mike and Joslyn, Jay. "Legislators took license with ideas for slogan on plate" Milwaukee Sentinel 12-27-85; Page 5, Part 1) have led to the nickname (sometimes used pejoratively among non-residents) of "cheeseheads" and to the creation of "cheesehead hats" made of yellow foam in the shape of a wedge of cheese.
Numerous ethnic festivals are held throughout Wisconsin to celebrate the heritage of its citizens. Such festivals include Summerfest, Oktoberfest, Polish Fest, Festa Italiana, Irish Fest, Bastille Days, Syttende Mai (Norwegian Constitution Day), Brat(wurst) Days in Sheboygan, Cheese Days in Monroe and Mequon, African World Festival, Indian Summer, Arab Fest, and many others.

===Alcohol and Wisconsin culture===

Drinking has long been considered a significant part of Wisconsin culture, and the state ranks at or near the top of national measures of per-capita alcohol consumption, binge drinking, driving under the influence, and proportion of drinkers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/31237904.html |author=Rick Romell |title=Drinking deeply ingrained in Wisconsin's culture|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date=October 19, 2008 |accessdate=August 18, 2011[/tpl] Factors such as cultural identification with the state's heritage of German immigration, the longstanding presence of major breweries in Milwaukee, and a cold climate are often associated with the prevalence of drinking in Wisconsin. The minimum legal age for recreational consumption of alcohol is 21 unless accompanied by a parent or guardian. Wisconsin is the only state that treats a first offense drunk driving (OWI) as a traffic violation and not a misdemeanor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.channel3000.com/news/Lawmakers-to-try-again-on-drunken-driving-bills/-/1648/18365522/-/r8cf1m/-/index.html | title=Lawmakers to try again on drunken driving bills |publisher=channel3000.com | accessdate=February 1, 2013[/tpl]
The Wisconsin Tavern League is a strong political force and the state legislature, reluctant to lower a DUI offense from BAC 0.10 to 0.08, did so only as a result of federal government pressure. The League also opposes raising the alcoholic beverage tax. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel series "Wasted in Wisconsin" examined this situation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/30565984.html |title=Wasted in Wisconsin |publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |accessdate=July 25, 2010[/tpl]

The Packers have been part of the NFL since the league's second season in 1921 and hold the record for the most NFL titles, earning the city of Green Bay the nickname "Titletown USA". The Packers are the smallest city franchise in the NFL, and is the only one owned by shareholders statewide. The franchise was founded by "Curly" Lambeau who played and coached for them.
