Bob Schneider (born October 12, 1965) is an Austin, Texas–based musician and artist. He currently resides in Bee Cave, Texas.

==Early career==

Bob was born in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and raised in Munich, Germany. The son of an opera singer, he moved with his parents to Germany when he was two.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid:523605 |title=photograph by Todd V. Wolfson: Bob Schneider Austin Music |publisher=AustinChronicle.com |date= |accessdate=January 2, 2011[/tpl] He learned guitar and piano at an early age and made his first live appearances performing at his parents' parties.
He performed for years in various bands before embarking on a solo career. He dropped out of the University of Texas at El Paso where he studied art to front his first band, the funk-and-rap outfit Joe Rockhead. The band independently released three albums before disbanding immediately prior to signing with a major label.
A stint with a jamming outfit called the Ugly Americans followed, which experienced some success as an opening act for the Dave Matthews Band and H.O.R.D.E. festival.
In 1997, Schneider went on to co-found The Scabs, which later merged with the Ugly Americans. With The Scabs, Bob Schneider made a further name for himself as the front man.
None of these bands gained much national recognition, but built solid reputations on the road. They were also a fixture in the Austin live music culture.

==Solo career==

In 1999, Schneider became a solo act, though performing at first under the band name Lonelyland (which he later dropped as a band name, but titled his first major-label album after). Schneider's musical approach as a solo artist has proven as eclectic as the diverse musical styles of his former bands: a little bit singer/songwriter, a whole lot of bits and pieces of funk, country, rock, and folk. Because of the sexual nature of some of his lyrics, Schneider's music has been labeled as "adult alternative" by some.
He went on to record the major-label solo albums Lonelyland (2001) and I'm Good Now (2004), which garnered him significantly more national attention and some critical acclaim.  "Big Blue Sea" from the Lonelyland album received significant radio play, as did "Come With Me Tonight" from I'm Good Now. "Metal & Steel" from Lonelyland is, to date, Bob's most played song.http://www.mediabase.com
His contract with his labels (signed with Universal in 2001, and then with Vanguard in 2004) allowed him to release albums as "side projects" on his own label Shockorama Records. Among the albums that have been self-released are Galaxy Kings and I've Seen The End of the World and It Looks Like This. All of these side projects were re-released by Vanguard corresponding with the release of his 2006 album The Californian. Previously, these albums were of limited availability and only roughly 10,000 of the albums were printed. After releasing The Californian, he released Greatest Hits Live, recorded in Austin on July 17, 2006, on Shockorama Records, which was only available through his website.
Bob remains committed to playing smaller venues and thrives on the energy of the stage. He currently has a long-standing Monday night residency at the Saxon Pub, and plays the legendary Antone's in Austin, Texas, with both his band and, on occasion, the Scabs, all while maintaining a tireless touring schedule. Although he tours nationwide, he is still known best as a true Austin musician. His musical influences spread into the far reaches of musical culture—funk, soul, folk, lounge, rap, punk, even some melodic experimentalism.
He is also known for having dated Sandra Bullock.  It is speculated that the breakup following their relationship became fodder for his music, although Schneider has been known to deny autobiographical content in his music.

==Kirtland Records==

In 2009, Bob signed with Kirtland Records to release his critically praised album Lovely Creatures, released September 29, 2009.  Lovely Creatures features the single "40 Dogs (Like Romeo and Juliet)", which has received significant national radio play – peaking at #14 on the AAA Radio Chart.http://www.mediabase.com The album and also features Patty Griffin on the track "Changing Your Mind."  Bob released a second album under the label entitled "A Perfect Day" on April 19, 2011, featuring the single "Let The Light In."
Following a series of website redesigns, his next album "Burden of Proof" was officially announced in December 2012 for an April, then May, and finally June 11 release in 2013.
