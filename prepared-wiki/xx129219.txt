After getting his coaching diploma, in January 2005 he was appointed as the coach of the Greece national under-19 football team.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/under19/news/newsid=557200.html|title=Nioplias going for glory again|last=Papantonopoulou|first=Vassiliki|date=3 July 2007|publisher=uefa.com[/tpl] He led  the team to the 2005 U19 European Championship which took place in Northern Ireland, but failed to progress past the group stage, despite a victory against the hosts.
