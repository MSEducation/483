Finnisterre first joined the Home Fleet upon her commissioning. After being in the Far East for some time, in which she performed a variety of duties there, Finisterre returned to the UK via the Mediterranean. In January 1950, Finisterre took part in the rescue attempt of the submarine [tpl]HMS|Truculent|P315|6[/tpl], which had sunk after colliding with a Swedish merchant ship Divina in the Thames Estuary.The Times (London), Friday, 13 January 1950, p.4 The collision had resulted in the loss of 64 of those on board.

In 1953, Finisterre took part in the 1953 Coronation Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of HM Queen Elizabeth II. The Finisterre was positioned adjacent to her sister-ship [tpl]HMS|St. James|D65|6[/tpl].The Times (London), Monday, 15 June 1953, p.15
The following year Finisterre was placed in Reserve. After her sister-ship [tpl]HMS|Hogue|D74|6[/tpl] collided with an Indian cruiser in 1959, Finisterre replaced her in the 1st Destroyer Squadron, based in the Far East. She didn't reach the region until 1960. Finisterre, as part of that squadron, subsequently saw service with the Home and Mediterranean Fleets.
