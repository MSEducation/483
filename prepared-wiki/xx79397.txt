[[GNE (encyclopedia)]]

CATEGORIES: Online encyclopedias

GNE (previously known as GNUPedia) was a project to create a free content encyclopedia (licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License) under the auspices of the Free Software Foundation. The idea for the project was initially proposed by Richard Stallman in December 2000[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/anencyc.txt|title=The Free Universal Encyclopedia and Learning Resource|last=Stallman|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Stallman|date=December 18, 2000|accessdate=2013-05-15[/tpl] and officially started in January 2001, moderated by Héctor Facundo Arena, an Argentinian programmer and GNU activist.[tpl]cite book|title=Good Faith Collaboration: The Culture of Wikipedia|last=Reagle|first=Joseph Michael|publisher=MIT Press|year=2010|isbn=9780262014472|page=37–38|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ml7SlTq8XvIC&pg=PA37[/tpl]

==History==

Immediately upon its creation, GNUPedia was confronted by confusion with the similar-sounding Nupedia project led by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, and controversy over whether this constituted a fork of the efforts to produce a free encyclopedia. In addition, Wales already owned the gnupedia.org domain name.Jimbo Wales gnupedia.org resolves to nupedia // bug-gnupedia mailing list - 21 Jan 2001 ([tpl]WebCite|http://www.webcitation.org/64QXWeeWZ[/tpl])[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/09/the-hive/5118/2/|title=The Hive|last=Poe|first=Marshall|work=The Atlantic|date=September 1, 2006|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64QXaIzMd|archivedate=January 3, 2012|deadurl=no|accessdate=January 11, 2014[/tpl])  The GNUPedia project changed its name to GNE (an abbreviation for "GNE is Not an Encyclopedia", a recursive acronym similar to that of the GNU Project) and switched to a knowledgebase.  GNE was designed to avoid centralization and editors who enforced quality standards, which they viewed as possibly introducing bias.  Jonathan Zittrain described GNE as a "collective blog" more than an encyclopedia.[tpl]cite book|title=The Future of the Internet--And How to Stop It|last=Zittrain|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Zittrain|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780300145342|page=131–133|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NiATs-C6nlQC&pg=PA131[/tpl]  Stallman has since lent his support to Wikipedia.
In The Wikipedia Revolution, Andrew Lih explains the reasons behind the demise of GNE:
