The U.S. NRC and the U.S. Department of Energy have initiated research into Light water reactor sustainability which is hoped will lead to allowing extensions of reactor licenses beyond 60 years, provided that safety can be maintained, as the loss in non-CO2-emitting generation capacity by retiring reactors "may serve to challenge U.S. energy security, potentially resulting in increased greenhouse gas emissions, and contributing to an imbalance between electric supply and demand."[ref]

===Nuclear phase out===

Following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035. Platts has reported that "the crisis at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy-consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/ElectricPower/6925550 |title=NEWS ANALYSIS: Japan crisis puts global nuclear expansion in doubt  |date=21 March 2011 |publisher=Platts [/tpl] In 2011, The Economist reported that nuclear power "looks dangerous, unpopular, expensive and risky", and that "it is replaceable with relative ease and could be forgone with no huge structural shifts in the way the world works".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18441163 |title=Nuclear power: When the steam clears |author= |date=March 24, 2011 |work=The Economist [/tpl]
In early April 2011, analysts at Swiss-based investment bank UBS said: "At Fukushima, four reactors have been out of control for weeks, casting doubt on whether even an advanced economy can master nuclear safety . . ..

In 2011, Deutsche Bank analysts concluded that "the global impact of the Fukushima accident is a fundamental shift in public perception with regard to how a nation prioritizes and values its populations health, safety, security, and natural environment when determining its current and future energy pathways". As a consequence, "renewable energy will be a clear long-term winner in most energy systems, a conclusion supported by many voter surveys conducted over the past few weeks. At the same time, we consider natural gas to be, at the very least, an important transition fuel, especially in those regions where it is considered secure".Deutsche Bank Group (2011).

In September 2011, German engineering giant Siemens announced it will withdraw entirely from the nuclear industry, as a response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, and said that it would no longer build nuclear power plants anywhere in the world. The company’s chairman, Peter Löscher, said that "Siemens was ending plans to cooperate with Rosatom, the Russian state-controlled nuclear power company, in the construction of dozens of nuclear plants throughout Russia over the coming two decades".[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/business/energy-environment/the-year-of-peril-and-promise-in-energy-production.html?src=un&feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fjson8.nytimes.com%2Fpages%2Fbusiness%2Fglobal%2Findex.jsonp  |title=The Year of Peril and Promise in Energy Production |author=John Broder |date=October 10, 2011   |work=New York Times [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14963575 |title=Siemens to quit nuclear industry |author= |date=18 September 2011  |work=BBC News [/tpl] Also in September 2011, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano said the Japanese nuclear disaster "caused deep public anxiety throughout the world and damaged confidence in nuclear power".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2011/09/23/IAEA-sees-slow-nuclear-growth-post-Japan/UPI-87041316777856/ |title=IAEA sees slow nuclear growth post Japan |author= |date=September 23, 2011 |work=UPI [/tpl]

===Advanced concepts===

Current fission reactors in operation around the world are second or third generation systems, with most of the first-generation systems having been retired some time ago. Research into advanced generation IV reactor types was officially started by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) based on eight technology goals, including to improve nuclear safety, improve proliferation resistance, minimize waste, improve natural resource utilization, the ability to consume existing nuclear waste in the production of electricity, and decrease the cost to build and run such plants. Most of these reactors differ significantly from current operating light water reactors, and are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction before 2030.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ossfoundation.us/projects/energy/nuclear |title=4th Generation Nuclear Power — OSS Foundation |publisher=Ossfoundation.us |accessdate=2014-01-24[/tpl]
The nuclear reactors to be built at Vogtle are new AP1000 third generation reactors, which are said to have safety improvements over older power reactors. However, John Ma, a senior structural engineer at the NRC, is concerned that some parts of the AP1000 steel skin are so brittle that the "impact energy" from a plane strike or storm driven projectile could shatter the wall. Edwin Lyman, a senior staff scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, is concerned about the strength of the steel containment vessel and the concrete shield building around the AP1000.[tpl]cite web |title=Nuclear energy: Planning for the Black Swan |author=Adam Piore |date=June 2011 |work=Scientific American [/tpl]Matthew L. Wald. Critics Challenge Safety of New Reactor Design New York Times, April 22, 2010.
The Union of Concerned Scientists has referred to the European Pressurized Reactor, currently under construction in China, Finland and France, as the only new reactor design under consideration in the United States that "...appears to have the potential to be significantly safer and more secure against attack than today's reactors."[tpl]cite web|title=Nuclear Power in a Warming World|work=Union of Concerned Scientists |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear-power-in-a-warming-world.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=1 October 2008[/tpl]
One disadvantage of any new reactor technology is that safety risks may be greater initially as reactor operators have little experience with the new design.  Nuclear engineer David Lochbaum has explained that almost all serious nuclear accidents have occurred with what was at the time the most recent technology. He argues that "the problem with new reactors and accidents is twofold: scenarios arise that are impossible to plan for in simulations; and humans make mistakes". As one director of a U.S. research laboratory put it, "fabrication, construction, operation, and maintenance of new reactors will face a steep learning curve: advanced technologies will have a heightened risk of accidents and mistakes. The technology may be proven, but people are not".Benjamin K. Sovacool.

===Hybrid nuclear fusion-fission===

Hybrid nuclear power is a proposed means of generating power  by use of a combination of nuclear fusion and fission processes. The concept dates to the 1950s, and was briefly advocated by Hans Bethe during the 1970s, but largely remained unexplored until a revival of interest in 2009, due to delays in the realization of pure fusion. When a sustained nuclear fusion power plant is built, it has the potential to be capable of extracting all the fission energy that remains in spent fission fuel, reducing the volume of nuclear waste by orders of magnitude, and more importantly, eliminating all actinides present in the spent fuel, substances which cause security concerns.[tpl]cite journal | author = Gerstner, E. | title = Nuclear energy: The hybrid returns | year = 2009 | journal = Nature | volume = 460 | issue = 7251| pages = 25–8 | pmid = 19571861|doi=10.1038/460025a|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090701/pdf/460025a.pdf | ref = harv[/tpl]

===Nuclear fusion===

Nuclear fusion reactions have the potential to be safer and generate less radioactive waste than fission.Introduction to Fusion Energy, J. Reece Roth, 1986.[tpl]Page needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] These reactions appear potentially viable, though technically quite difficult and have yet to be created on a scale that could be used in a functional power plant. Fusion power has been under theoretical and experimental investigation since the 1950s.
Construction of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor facility began in 2007, but the project has run into many delays and budget overruns. The facility is now not expected to begin operations until the year 2027 – 11 years after initially anticipated.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/triple-threat-method-sparks-hope-for-fusion-1.14445 |title=Triple-threat method sparks hope for fusion |author=W Wayt Gibbs |date=30 December 2013 |work=Nature [/tpl] A follow on commercial nuclear fusion power station, DEMO, has been proposed.[tpl]cite web |work= EFDA |title = Overview of EFDA Activities  | publisher = European Fusion Development Agreement  | url = http://www.efda.org/about_efda/downloads/EFDAoverview.ppt | accessdate = 2006-11-11 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20061001123645/http://www.efda.org/about_efda/downloads/EFDAoverview.ppt  |archivedate = 2006-10-01[/tpl] There is also suggestions for a power plant based upon a different fusion approach, that of a Inertial fusion power plant.
Fusion powered electricity generation was initially believed to be readily achievable, as fission power had been. However, the extreme requirements for continuous reactions and plasma containment led to projections being extended by several decades. In 2010, more than 60 years after the first attempts, commercial power production was still believed to be unlikely before 2050.
