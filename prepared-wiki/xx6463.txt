==History==

===Toponymy===

The etymology of London is uncertain.[tpl]Harvnb|Mills|2001|p=139[/tpl] It is an ancient name, found in sources from the 2nd century. It is recorded c. 121 as Londinium, which points to Romano-British origin. The earliest attempted explanation, now disregarded, is attributed to Geoffrey of Monmouth in Historia Regum Britanniae. This had it that the name originated from a supposed King Lud, who had allegedly taken over the city and named it Kaerlud.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/02/books/chapters/02-1st-ackro.html?ex=1225339200&en=b9c2c11ad6e1f435&ei=5070&pagewanted=3|title=London|last=Ackroyd|first=Peter|work=The New York Times |accessdate=28 October 2008 | date=2 December 2001|isbn=978-0-7011-7279-4[/tpl]
From 1898, it was commonly accepted that the name was of Celtic origin and meant place belonging to a man called *Londinos; this explanation has since been rejected. Richard Coates put forward an explanation in 1998 that it is derived from the pre-Celtic Old European *(p)lowonida, meaning 'river too wide to ford', and suggested that this was a name given to the part of the River Thames which flows through London; from this, the settlement gained the Celtic form of its name, *Lowonidonjon;[tpl]Cite journal|last=Coates|first=Richard|year=1998|title=A new explanation of the name of London|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|volume=96|issue=2|pages=203–229|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1467-968X.00027|doi=10.1111/1467-968X.00027|ref=harv| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0UqnAy | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no[/tpl] this requires quite a serious amendment however. The ultimate difficulty lies in reconciling the Latin form Londinium with the modern Welsh Llundain, which should demand a form *(h)lōndinion (as opposed to *londīnion), from earlier *loundiniom. The possibility cannot be ruled out that the Welsh name was borrowed back in from English at a later date, and thus cannot be used as a basis from which to reconstruct the original name.
Until 1889, the name "London" officially only applied to the City of London but since then it has also referred to the County of London and now Greater London.

===Prehistory and antiquity===

Two recent discoveries indicate probable very early settlements near the Thames in the London area. In 1999, the remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the foreshore north of Vauxhall Bridge.[tpl]cite journal|last=Denison|first=Simon|title=First 'London Bridge' in River Thames at Vauxhall|journal=British Archaeology|date=July 1999|issue=46|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba46/ba46news.html|accessdate=15 April 2011| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0WdLQ0 | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no[/tpl] This bridge either crossed the Thames, or went to a (lost) island in the river. Dendrology dated the timbers to 1500BC. In 2010 the foundations of a large timber structure, dated to 4500BC, were found on the Thames foreshore, south of Vauxhall Bridge.[tpl]cite web|last=Milne|first=Gustav|title=London's Oldest Foreshore Structure!|url=http://www.thamesdiscovery.org/frog-blog/london-s-oldest-find-discovered-at-vauxhall|work=Frog Blog|publisher=Thames Discovery Programme|accessdate=15 April 2011| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0WtZpl | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no[/tpl] The function of the mesolithic structure is not known. Both structures are on South Bank, at a natural crossing point where the River Effra flows into the River Thames.
Although there is evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans in 43 AD.[tpl]Cite book |title=Roman London |last=Perring |first=Dominic |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-203-23133-3|page=1 |ref=harv [/tpl] This lasted for just seventeen years and around 61, the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it, burning it to the ground.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/timeline/romanbritain_timeline_noflash.shtml|title=British History Timeline —Roman Britain|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 June 2008| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0V1GXn | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no[/tpl] The next, heavily planned, incarnation of Londinium prospered and superseded Colchester as the capital of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height during the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000.

===Anglo-Saxon London===

With the collapse of Roman rule in the early 5th century, London ceased to be a capital and the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation hung on in the St Martin-in-the-Fields area until around 450.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Londinium.htm|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090108092449/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Londinium.htm|archivedate=8 January 2009|publisher=Museum of London|title=The last days of Londinium|accessdate=31 March 2013[/tpl] From around 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed in the same area, slightly to the west of the old Roman city.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Lundenwic.htm |title=The early years of Lundenwic|publisher=The Museum of London |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20080610043903/http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/English/EventsExhibitions/Past/MissingLink/Themes/TML_themes_Lundenwic.htm |archivedate=10 June 2008[/tpl] By about 680, it had revived sufficiently to become a major port, although there is little evidence of large-scale production of goods. From the 820s the town declined because of repeated Viking attacks, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recorded that it was "refounded" by Alfred the Great in 886. Archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. London then grew slowly until about 950, after which activity increased dramatically.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last=Vince|first= Alan|year=2001|title=London|editors= Lapidge, Michael; Blair, John; Keynes, Simon; Scragg, Donald |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England |publisher= Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-22492-1[/tpl]
By the 11th century, London was beyond all comparison the largest town in England. Westminster Abbey, rebuilt in the Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor, was one of the grandest churches in Europe. Winchester had previously been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time on, London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of Frank Stenton: "It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital."[tpl]cite book|authorlink=Frank Stenton|last=Stenton|first= Frank|year=1971|title=Anglo-Saxon England|pages=538–539|publisher= Oxford University Press|edition=3rd|isbn=978-0-19-280139-5[/tpl][tpl]cite encyclopedia |last=Blair |first= John |year=2001|title=Westminster|editors= Lapidge, Michael; Blair, John; Keynes, Simon; Scragg, Donald |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England|publisher= Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-22492-1[/tpl]

During the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto accompanied the royal English court as it moved around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed in one place. In most cases this was Westminster, although the royal treasury, having been moved from Winchester, came to rest in the Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true capital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre, and it flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London. In 1100, its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000.[tpl]Cite book|last=Schofield|first=John|last2=Vince|first2=Alan|author2-link=Alan Vince|title=Medieval Towns: The Archaeology of British Towns in Their European Setting|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8264-6002-8|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Qu7QLC7g7VgC&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=london+population+1100+-+1300|page=26|ref=harv[/tpl]

===Early modern===

During the Tudor period the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism, with much of London passing from church to private ownership.Pevsner, Nikolaus. London I: The Cities of London and Westminster rev. edition, 1962. Introduction p. 48. The traffic in woollen cloths shipped undyed and undressed from London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries where it was considered indispensable.J. G. Pounds (1976). "An Historical Geography of Europe 450 B.C.-A.D. 1330, Part 1330". p. 430. CUP Archive, But the tentacles of English maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean Sea normally lay through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan. Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565 there at once ensued a strong outburst of commercial activity.Ramsay, George Daniel (1986). The Queen's Merchants and the Revolt of the Netherlands: The End of the Antwerp Mart. Volume 2, pp. 1 and 62-63. Manchester University Press.

With illustrations, Volume 2, pages 80–81, John William Burgon, E. Wilson, 1839. Mercantilism grew and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established, with trade expanding to the New World. London became the principal North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.
In the 16th century William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in London at a time of hostility to the development of the theatre.

In 1762, George III acquired Buckingham House and it was enlarged over the next 75 years.

===Late modern and contemporary===

London was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/i-m/london4.html|title=London: The greatest city |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=12 October 2008 |ref=harv |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0g3KOn |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no[/tpl] London's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/themes/publichealth/cholera.aspx |title=Hidden extras: cholera comes to Victorian London |publisher=The Science Museum |location =London |accessdate=13 December 2011[/tpl] claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866.[tpl]cite web |author=Brown, Robert W. |url= http://www.uncp.edu/home/rwb/london_19c.html |title= London in the Nineteenth Century |publisher= University of North Carolina at Pembroke |accessdate=13 December 2011[/tpl] Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network. The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some of the surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of those areas of the counties surrounding the capital. London was bombed by the Germans during the First World War while during the Second World War  the Blitz and other bombing by the German Luftwaffe killed over 30,000 Londoners and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city. Immediately after the war, the 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium, at a time when London had barely recovered from the war.
In 1951, the Festival of Britain was held on the South Bank. The Great Smog of 1952 led to the Clean Air Act 1956, which ended the "pea soup fogs" for which London had been notorious. From the 1940s onwards, London became home to a large number of immigrants, largely from Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, making London one of the most diverse cities in Europe.
Primarily starting in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the Swinging London subculture associated with the King's Road, Chelsea and Carnaby Street. The role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era. In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created. During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was subjected to bombing attacks by the Provisional IRA. Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot. Greater London's population declined steadily in the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s. The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury, with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration as the Canary Wharf development. This was borne out of London's ever-increasing role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s.
The Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea. The Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, which left London as the only large metropolis in the world without a central administration. In 2000, London-wide government was restored, with the creation of the Greater London Authority. To celebrate the start of the 21st century, the Millennium Dome, London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed.  On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics, making London the first city to stage the Olympic Games three times.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/front_page/4655555.stm |title= London beats Paris to 2012 Games |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 July 2005 |accessdate=28 September 2012[/tpl]

==Government==

===Local government===

The administration of London is formed of two tiers—a city-wide, strategic tier and a local tier. City-wide administration is coordinated by the Greater London Authority (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/gla/|title=About the Greater London Authority|publisher=London Government|accessdate=27 September 2008| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0hYGdz | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no[/tpl] The GLA consists of two elected components; the Mayor of London, who has executive powers, and the London Assembly, who scrutinise the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject his budget proposals each year.
The headquarters of the GLA is City Hall, Southwark; the mayor is Boris Johnson. The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the London Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/planning/londonplan|title=The London Plan|publisher=Greater London Authority|accessdate=25 May 2012| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/67vG4jMg5 | archivedate = 25 May 2012| deadurl=no[/tpl] The local authorities are the councils of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/london/links.jsp|title=Links to other websites — London boroughs|publisher=London Government|accessdate=27 September 2008 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20071019055428/http://www.london.gov.uk/london/links.jsp |archivedate = 19 October 2007[/tpl] They are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, social services, local roads and refuse collection. Certain functions, such as waste management, are provided through joint arrangements. In 2009–2010 the combined revenue expenditure by London councils and the GLA amounted to just over £22 billion (£14.7 billion for the boroughs and £7.4 billion for the GLA).http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/1911067.pdf
Policing in Greater London, with the exception of the City of London, is provided by the Metropolitan Police Force, overseen by the Mayor through the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/policing-crime/about-mopac |title=About MOPAC |publisher= Greater London Authority |accessdate=4 May 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://policeauthority.org/Metropolitan/ |title=MPA: Metropolitan Police Authority |publisher= Metropolitan Police Authority |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=4 May 2013[/tpl] The City of London has its own police force – the City of London Police.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.london.gov.uk/gla/policing.jsp|title=Policing |publisher= Greater London Authority |accessdate=25 August 2009 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20080121173357/http://www.london.gov.uk/gla/policing.jsp |archivedate=21 January 2008[/tpl] The British Transport Police are responsible for police services on National Rail and London Underground services.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.btp.police.uk/about_us/areas.aspx |title= Areas |publisher= British Transport Police |accessdate=25 August 2009 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0hdc31 | archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no[/tpl]

===National government===

London is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom. Many government departments are based close to the Palace of Westminster, particularly along Whitehall, including the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page1.asp |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20080510193022/http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page1.asp |archivedate=10 May 2008 |title=10 Downing Street — Official Website |accessdate=26 April 2008[/tpl] The British Parliament is often referred to as the "Mother of Parliaments" (although this sobriquet was first applied to England itself by John Bright)[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/talking_politics/96021.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=6 June 2008 |date=3 June 1998 |title=UK Politics: Talking Politics — The 'Mother of Parliaments' |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0l5vww |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no[/tpl] because it has been the model for most other parliamentary systems, and its Acts have created many other parliaments. There are 73 Members of Parliament (MPs) from London, who correspond to local parliamentary constituencies in the national Parliament. Of these, 38 are from the Labour Party, 28 are Conservatives, and 7 are Liberal Democrats.

==Geography==

===Scope===

Greater London is the top-level administrative subdivision covering London. The small, ancient City of London at its core once contained the whole settlement, but as the urban area grew the City Corporation resisted attempts to amalgamate it with its suburbs, causing "London" to be defined in a number ways for different purposes; and the situation was once open to legal debate.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Beavan|first=Charles|coauthors=Bickersteth, Harry|title=Reports of Cases in Chancery, Argued and Determined in the Rolls Court|publisher=Saunders and Benning|year=1865|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YFYDAAAAQAAJ|ref=harv[/tpl][tpl]failed verification|date=April 2013[/tpl] Forty per cent of Greater London is covered by the London post town, within which 'LONDON' forms part of postal addresses.[tpl]Cite book|last=Stationery Office|title=The Inner London Letter Post|publisher=H.M.S.O|year=1980|isbn=978-0-10-251580-0|page=128|ref=harv[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|title=London Postcode and Administrative Boundaries|publisher=Geographers' A-Z Map Company|author=Geographers' A-Z Map Company|year=2008|edition=6|isbn=978-1-84348-592-6|ref=harv[/tpl]

The Thames Valley is a floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills including Parliament Hill, Addington Hills, and Primrose Hill. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive marshlands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=M9qvtYYhRtAC&pg=PR11&dq=thames+%22iron+age%22+london+wide+geography+shallow+marsh|title=London: A History|first=Francis|last= Sheppard| page= 10|publisher=Google Books|year=2000|isbn=978-0-19-285369-1|accessdate=6 June 2008[/tpl]
Since the Victorian era the Thames has been extensively embanked, and many of its London tributaries now flow underground.

===Districts===

London's vast urban area is often described using a set of district names, such as Bloomsbury, Mayfair, Wembley and Whitechapel. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs.
Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries. Since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 London boroughs in addition to the ancient City of London.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/city-government/boroughs.jsp|title=London boroughs — London Life, GLA|publisher=London Government|accessdate=3 November 2008 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20071213025156/http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/city-government/boroughs.jsp |archivedate = 13 December 2007[/tpl][tpl]Cite book |last1=Dogan |first1=Mattei |first2=John D. |last2=Kasarda |title=The Metropolis Era |publisher=Sage |year=1988 |page=99 |isbn=978-0-8039-2603-5 |url= http://books.google.com/?id=_GFPAAAAMAAJ&q=1965,+32+boroughs+of+london&dq=1965,+32+boroughs+of+london |ref=harv[/tpl] The City of London is the main financial district,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/business-and-jobs/financial-centre.jsp |title=London as a financial centre |publisher=Mayor of London |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20080106051217/http://www.london.gov.uk/london-life/business-and-jobs/financial-centre.jsp |archivedate=6 January 2008[/tpl] and Canary Wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the Docklands to the east.

===Architecture===

London's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are constructed from Portland stone. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the City. Further out is, for example, the Tudor period Hampton Court Palace, England's oldest surviving Tudor palace, built by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey c. 1515.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/tudors/hampton_court_01.shtml |title=Hampton Court: The Lost Palace |publisher=BBC History |date=29 March 2011 |author=Foyle, Jonathan |accessdate=16 June 2013 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0pDL3i |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no[/tpl]
Wren's late 17th-century churches and the financial institutions of the 18th and 19th centuries such as the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England, to the early 20th century Old Bailey and the 1960s Barbican Estate form part of the varied architectural heritage.
The disused, but soon to be rejuvenated, 1939 Battersea Power Station by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of Victorian architecture, most notably St. Pancras and Paddington.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Paddington_Station.html |title=Paddington Station |publisher=Great Buildings |accessdate=6 June 2008 |ref=harv |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0pwi86 |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no[/tpl] The density of London varies, with high employment density in the central area, high residential densities in inner London and lower densities in Outer London.
The Monument in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the Great Fire of London, which originated nearby. Marble Arch and Wellington Arch, at the north and south ends of Park Lane respectively, have royal connections, as do the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington. Nelson's Column is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar Square, one of the focal points of the city centre. Older buildings are mainly brick built, most commonly the yellow London stock brick or a warm orange-red variety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster mouldings.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=A1&xml=/property/2008/03/27/lpgreen127.xml |title=Eco homes: Wooden it be lovely... ? |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=12 October 2008 |location=London |first=Sarah |last=Lonsdale |date=27 March 2008 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0rvzUL |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no[/tpl]
In the dense areas, most of the concentration is via medium- and high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers such as 30 St Mary Axe, Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square are mostly in the two financial districts, the City of London and Canary Wharf. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of St Paul's Cathedral and other historic buildings. Nevertheless there are a number of very tall skyscrapers in central London (see Tall buildings in London), including the 72-storey Shard London Bridge, the tallest building in the European Union.
Other notable modern buildings include City Hall in Southwark with its distinctive oval shape,[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2129199.stm |title=Inside London's new 'glass egg' |date=16 July 2002 |work=BBC News |accessdate=26 April 2008 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0sZ57q |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no[/tpl] and the British Library in Somers Town/Kings Cross. What was formerly the Millennium Dome, by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now an entertainment venue called The O2 Arena.

===Parks and gardens===

The largest parks in the central area of London are three of the Royal Parks, namely Hyde Park and its neighbour Kensington Gardens at the western edge of central London, and Regent's Park on the northern edge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/kensington_gardens/|title=Kensington Gardens|year=2008|publisher=The Royal Parks|accessdate=26 April 2008| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0tndiN | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no[/tpl] Regent's Park contains London Zoo, the world's oldest scientific zoo, and is near the tourist attraction of Madame Tussauds Wax Museum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.madametussauds.com/London/About.aspx|title=Madame Tussauds — Official website|publisher=Madame Tussauds|accessdate=6 June 2008| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0uQJ4x | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tourist-information-uk.com/madame-tussauds.htm|title=Madame Tussauds — Tourist Information|publisher=Tourist Information UK|accessdate=26 April 2008| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo0v6PMD | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no[/tpl]

==Demography==

With increasing industrialisation, London's population grew rapidly throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, and it was for some time in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the most populous city in the world until overtaken by New York City in 1925. Its population peaked at 8,615,245 in 1939 immediately before the outbreak of the Second World War, but had declined to 7,192,091 at the 2001 Census. However, the population then grew by just over a million between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, to reach 8,173,941 in the latter enumeration.
However, London's continuous urban area extends beyond the borders of Greater London and was home to 9,787,426 people in 2011, while its wider metropolitan area has a population of between 12 and 14 million depending on the definition used.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/world/Agglomerations.html|title=The Principal Agglomerations of the World|work=City Population|accessdate=3 March 2009| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5rRuMtUmh | archivedate = 23 July 2010| deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/Documents/Projects/ESPON2006Projects/StudiesScientificSupportProjects/UrbanFunctions/fr-1.4.3_April2007-final.pdf#page=119 |title=British urban pattern: population data |accessdate=22 February 2010 |date=March 2007 |work=ESPON project 1.4.3 Study on Urban Functions |publisher=European Spatial Planning Observation Network|page=119[/tpl] According to Eurostat, London is the most populous city and metropolitan area of the European Union and the second most populous in Europe (or third if Istanbul is included).

==Transport==

Transport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/|title=Transport for London|publisher=Transport for London|accessdate=27 April 2008| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5msa508h4 | archivedate = 18 January 2010| deadurl=no[/tpl] however the mayor's financial control does not extend to the longer distance rail network that enters London. In 2007 he assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the London Overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by Transport for London (TfL) and is one of the most extensive in the world. Cycling is an increasingly popular way to get around London. The London Cycling Campaign lobbies for better provision.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lcc.org.uk/|title=London Cycling Campaign|date=20 November 2006|publisher=Rosanna Downes|accessdate=27 April 2008| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yo1Hlskj | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no[/tpl]
The lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) or London Transport was created. Transport for London (TfL), is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the Mayor of London.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/help/faq.jsp#transport|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20071019055413/http://www.london.gov.uk/help/faq.jsp|archivedate=19 October 2007|title=How do I find out about transport in London? |publisher=Greater London Authority|accessdate=5 June 2008[/tpl]

===Roads===

Although the majority of journeys involving central London are made by public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs. The inner ring road (around the city centre), the North and South Circular roads (in the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the M25, outside the built-up area) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into inner London. The M25 is the longest ring-road motorway in the world at [tpl]convert|121.5|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] long.Campbell, Ken (2000).

A plan for a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city (the Ringways Plan) was prepared in the 1960s but was mostly cancelled in the early 1970s. In 2003, a congestion charge was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay £10 per day to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London.[tpl]Cite journal |url= http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/roadusers/congestioncharge/whereandwhen/ |title=Charging Zone |publisher= Transport for London |accessdate=7 June 2008|ref=harv |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5yoK0vSxb |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=no[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/congestioncharging/6741.aspx |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20080608124006/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/congestioncharging/6741.aspx |archivedate=8 June 2008 |title=Who pays what |publisher=Transport for London |accessdate=7 June 2008[/tpl] Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass which is renewed monthly and is cheaper than a corresponding bus fare.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/congestioncharging/6735.aspx |title=Residents |publisher=Transport for London |accessdate=7 June 2008 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5yoK17mHL |archivedate=19 May 2011| deadurl=no[/tpl] London is notorious for its traffic congestion, with the M25 motorway the busiest stretch in the country.

The London accent long ago acquired the Cockney label, which is heard both in London itself, and across the wider South East England region more generally."Cracking Up!". p. 178. Lulu.com The accent of a 21st-century 'Londoner' varies widely; what is becoming more and more common amongst the under-30s however is some fusion of Cockney with a whole array of 'ethnic' accents, in particular Caribbean, which form an accent labelled Multicultural London English (MLE).[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/jafaican-and-tikkiny-drown-out-the-east-ends-cockney-twang-473688.html |title=Jafaican and Tikkiny drown out the East End's Cockney twang |last=Brown |first=Jonathan |date=11 April 2006 |work=The Independent |accessdate=22 August 2008 |location=London |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5yoK682mq |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=yes[/tpl]

===Literature, film and television===

London has been the setting for many works of literature. The literary centres of London have traditionally been hilly Hampstead and (since the early 20th century) Bloomsbury. Writers closely associated with the city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his eyewitness account of the Great Fire, Charles Dickens, whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has been a major influence on people's vision of early Victorian London, and Virginia Woolf, regarded as one of the foremost modernist literary figures of the 20th century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/library/speccoll/guides/london/londoninliterature.shtml|title=London in Literature,|publisher=Bryn Mawr College|accessdate=6 June 2008| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yoK8S7iR | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no[/tpl]
The pilgrims in Geoffrey Chaucer's late 14th-century Canterbury Tales set out for Canterbury from London – specifically, from the Tabard inn, Southwark. William Shakespeare spent a large part of his life living and working in London; his contemporary Ben Jonson was also based there, and some of his work—most notably his play The Alchemist—was set in the city. A Journal of the Plague Year (1722) by Daniel Defoe is a fictionalisation of the events of the 1665 Great Plague.  Later important depictions of London from the 19th and early 20th centuries are Dickens' novels, and Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories. Modern writers pervasively influenced by the city include Peter Ackroyd, author of a "biography" of London, and Iain Sinclair, who writes in the genre of psychogeography.
London has played a significant role in the film industry, and has major studios at Ealing and a special effects and post-production community centred in Soho. Working Title Films has its headquarters in London.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.workingtitlefilms.com/|title=Working Title Films|publisher=Universal Studios|accessdate=27 April 2008| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yoK8c0bN | archivedate = 19 May 2011| deadurl=no[/tpl] London has been the setting for films including Oliver Twist (1948), Peter Pan (1953), The Ladykillers (1955), The 101 Dalmatians (1961), Mary Poppins (1964), Blowup (1966), The Long Good Friday (1980), Secrets & Lies (1996), Notting Hill (1999), Match Point (2005), V For Vendetta (2005) and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street (2008).

===Museums and art galleries===

London is home to many museums, galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of admission charges and are major tourist attractions as well as playing a research role. The first of these to be established was the British Museum in Bloomsbury, in 1753. Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens and the national library, the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe. In 1824 the National Gallery was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this now occupies a prominent position in Trafalgar Square. In the latter half of the 19th century the locale of South Kensington was developed as "Albertopolis", a cultural and scientific quarter. Three major national museums are there: the Victoria and Albert Museum (for the applied arts), the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum. The National Portrait Gallery was founded in 1856 to house depictions of figures from British history; its holdings now comprise the world's most extensive collection of portraits.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/about/organisation.php|title=Organisation|publisher=National Portrait Gallery|accessdate=18 November 2013[/tpl] The national gallery of British art is at Tate Britain, originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art; in 2000 this collection moved to Tate Modern, a new gallery housed in the former Bankside Power Station.
