He returned to Naples to produce his already-mentioned masterpiece, Lucia di Lammermoor and, as Donizetti's fame grew, so did his engagements, as he was further offered commissions by both the Paris Opéra and Venice's La Fenice for which he wrote Belisario. 
In October 1838, he moved to Paris vowing never to have to deal with the San Carlo anymore after the King of Naples banned the production of Poliuto on the grounds that such a sacred subject was inappropriate for the stage. In Paris, Poliuto was set to a new French-language libretto by Eugene Scribe as Les martyrs, his first grand opera in the French tradition. Before leaving that city in June 1840, he oversaw the translation of Lucia into Lucie de Lammermoor and wrote La fille du régiment, his first opera written specifically to a French libretto. This became another success.
As a conductor, he led the premiere of Rossini's Stabat Mater.

==Personal life==

Donizetti's wife, Virginia Vasselli, gave birth to three children, none of whom survived. Within a year of his parents' deaths, on 30 July 1837, his wife died from cholera. By 1843, Donizetti was exhibiting  symptoms of syphilis and probable bipolar disorder. After being institutionalized in 1845, he was sent to Paris, where he could be cared for. After visits from friends, including Giuseppe Verdi, Donizetti was taken back to Bergamo, his hometown. After several years in the grip of insanity, he died in 1848 in the house of a noble family, the Scotti. Donizetti was buried in the cemetery of Valtesse but in the late 19th century his body was transferred to Bergamo's Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore near the grave of his teacher Simon Mayr.
He was the younger brother of Giuseppe Donizetti, who had become, in 1828, Instructor General of the Imperial Ottoman Music at the court of Sultan Mahmud II (1808–1839).

==Donizetti's compositions==

Donizetti, a prolific composer, is best known for his operatic works, but he also wrote music in a number of other forms, including some church music, a number of string quartets, and some orchestral pieces. Altogether, he composed about 75 operas, 16 symphonies, 19 string quartets, 193 songs, 45 duets, 3 oratorios, 28 cantatas, instrumental concertos, sonatas, and other chamber pieces.
