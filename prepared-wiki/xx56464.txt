==Training==

Halme had been training sports almost his whole life, but combat sports came along after he trained first his upper body seriously. That's why his punches were so stiff, but hard.

==Political career==

During his parliamentary career, Halme raised controversies. The day after the elections, Halme referred to President Tarja Halonen as a lesbian in a radio interview. Halme stated that if a lesbian can be president of Finland and he can be a member of Parliament, anything seems possible. A huge uproar ensued as much of the Finnish media treated the statement as a personal attack on Halonen; Halonen herself made no comment. Halme later apologized, stating that he was sorry that the statement had been interpreted as an insult and that he had been under the genuine impression that Halonen was a lesbian.ranneliike.net:

==Personal life==

Halme was divorced from his wife Katja Talus.
In July 2003, a handgun was fired inside Halme's apartment, probably after a domestic quarrel. Nobody was hurt, but the gun was unlicensed. Halme had only days before been in a boxing match and was using prescription medication because he was in pain. The dangerous combination of drugs and alcohol was a factor in the incident. His blood contained trace amounts of amphetamine and illegal steroids were also found in his apartment. Halme claimed that somebody had put the illegal substance into his drink without his knowledge.  He was unconscious for several days following the incident. The police searched Halme's office at the House of Parliament. In January 2004 his trial was shown live on television by the MTV3 digital television channel.

In December 2009, Halme told a newspaper that he was suffering from impairment of his short-term memory and had trouble remembering anything, but was still trying to write a book of his political career.Ilta-Sanomat 10.1.2010 – Tony Halme oli kirjoittamassa kirjaa

He was 47 years old. Following his death, Jim Ross in an article with The Sun stated: "I won't speak at length about those that have passed away but Tony obviously had issues and was not a great guy to be around. Perhaps others have a different view of this man but I personally found him to be somewhat obnoxious and he could be a bully if allowed to be such.
"Guys like Halme don't mix well in any locker room and need to be removed from the 'team' sooner than later."
Ross added: "I still feel badly about the last years of Tony's life as things really unraveled for him seemingly due to alcohol and drug issues.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/2823841/Jim-Ross-says-Ludvig-Borga-was-a-selfish-bully.html | work=The Sun | first=Simon | last=Rothstein[/tpl]
