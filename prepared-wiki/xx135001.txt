Voere is an Austrian gunmaker best known for its VEC-91 bolt-action rifle using caseless ammunition.
The origins of the company date back to the 1948 establishment of the metal-working company Koma[tpl]dn|date=March 2013[/tpl] in West Germany. Originally producing bicycle tire pumps, the company branched out into the production of air pistols in 1950. In 1955, Koma was renamed Voere.  The company's name is a combination of the founders' names: Voetter and Restle. That year, Voere began the production of small-bore rifles.
In 1965, the company relocated to a new factory in Kufstein, Austria. In 1972, licensed production of the American-180 submachine gun began. By 1980, the company began to diversify its production, and included a new line of environmental/horticultural products. In 1989, Voere merged with the trading company Kufsteiner Ger√§tebau und Handelsges m.b.H and formed Voere-KGH m.b.H. At that time, Voere began work as a precision machining subcontractor for other companies. The VEC-91 caseless rifle was introduced in 1991.
