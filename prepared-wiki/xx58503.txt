Auckland Airport [tpl]Airport codes|AKL|NZAA[/tpl] is the largest and busiest airport in New Zealand with  14,829,393 (7,907,506 international and 6,921,887 domestic) passengers in the year ended November 2013.http://www.aucklandairport.co.nz/~/media/Files/Corporate/Monthly_Traffic_Reports/2014/MTU%20November%202013.pdf The airport is located near Mangere, a residential suburb and Airport Oaks, a service hub suburb [tpl]convert|21|km[/tpl] south of the downtown Auckland city centre. It is the central hub for Air New Zealand, a New Zealand hub of Virgin Australia, and a focus city for Jetstar Airways.
Auckland Airport is one of New Zealand’s most important infrastructure assets, providing thousands of jobs for the region, and is the country’s second largest cargo port by value, contributing around $14 billion to the economy, and catering for over four million visitors each year, resulting in a 70% share of New Zealand's international travellers.Air passengers and flights (from Statistics New Zealand) It is one of only two airports in New Zealand (the other being Christchurch) capable of handling Boeing 777, Boeing 747 and Airbus A380 aircraft.
The airport is the fourth busiest in Australasia after Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane airports. However, internationally, the airport is the second busiest in Australasia as Melbourne had just 6,213,479 international passengers in 2011.Avline 2010–11. Bitre.gov.au (2013-02-26).

The airport has been rated in the top 3 worldwide for airports handling 5–15 million passengers annually.Auckland Airport rated in the top 3 worldwide for service quality (from the Auckland Airport website Retrieved Thursday 2008-03-27) It was also voted the 12th best airport in the world in 2013 at the Skytrax World Airport Awards, as well as being the best airport in the Australia/Pacific region.http://www.worldairportawards.com/Awards_2013/top100.htmhttp://www.worldairportawards.com/Awards_2013/bestregion.htm
It has a capacity of about 45 flight movements per hour, using a single runway which is fully Cat IIIb capable (at a reduced rate of movements). A close by taxiway was upgraded for use as a runway when the main runway requires maintenance or for use during emergencies,Summary (from the 'Masterplan: 2005-2025' document of Auckland Airport. Retrieved 2007-10-08.) but it does not have sufficient separation distance to operate simultaneously with the main runway. In November 2007 work began on a new northern runway, to be built in several stages and to be used mainly by smaller airplanes, freeing up capacity on the main runway. However, the project was put on hold for at least 12 months in October 2009, and deferred for a further few years in August 2010 following consultation with airlines and a review of capacity management options. The timing of the recommencement of construction of the second runway will be demand driven relative to the capacity of the existing runway.

==History==

===Overview===

The site of the airport was first used as an airfield by the Auckland Aero Club. In 1928, the club leased some land from a dairy farmer to accommodate the club's three De Havilland Gypsy Moths. The club president noted at the time that the site "has many advantages of vital importance for an aerodrome and training ground. It has good approaches, is well drained and is free from power lines, buildings and fogs."  Prior to rebuilding, this was known as Mangere Aerodrome.
In 1960 work started to transform the site into Auckland's main airport, taking over from Whenuapai in the north-west of the city. Much of the runway is on land reclaimed from the Manukau Harbour. The first flight to leave was an Air New Zealand DC-8 in November 1965, bound for Sydney. The airport was officially opened the following year, with a 'grand air pageant' on Auckland Anniversary weekend, 29 January to 31 January 1966.
A new international terminal, named after Jean Batten, was built in 1977.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.auckland-airport.co.nz/~/media/21992090C8F345D1A9F50C0EDEA187D2.ashx?sc_database=master|title=Expanded Arrivals Processing|publisher=Auckland Airport|accessdate=2008-12-15[/tpl] Prior to this, all flights (including international ones) used what is now the domestic terminal.Overhaul for domestic terminal - Business - NZ Herald News. Nzherald.co.nz (2013-02-06). Retrieved on 2013-07-16. In 2005, the international terminal was altered, separating arriving and departing passengers.

===Expansion===

In 2007, construction began on a second runway to the north of the current one. Initially the new runway would have been [tpl]convert|1200|m|adj=on[/tpl] long and catered for regional flights operated by Air New Zealand using turboprop aircraft. This would have cost $32 million and would have improved the efficiency of the airport by removing smaller planes (which require longer separation distances from the air turbulence wakes of preceding jet airliners) from the main runway.  At a later stage, the runway would have been lengthened to [tpl]convert|1950|m[/tpl] to allow it be used by small jets (such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320) on domestic and trans-Tasman flights.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10467994&pnum=0|title=Stage one begins for second runway|publisher=The New Zealand Herald|date=5 October 2007|pages=A7|author=Mathew Dearnaley[/tpl] However, in August 2009, the project was put on hold due to a downturn in air travel,extends suspension of second runway. Auckland Airport (2010-07-16). Retrieved on 2013-07-16. and, as of 2013, the project is still on hold.
Construction for Stage One started in November 2007. However, Stage Two will likely see the runway lengthened to [tpl]convert|1650|m[/tpl] which will enable domestic jet flights to use it. Stage Three (final stage) will lengthen the runway to [tpl]convert|2150|m[/tpl], allowing medium sized international jet flights to land there, from destinations such as the Pacific Islands or Australia. Eventually a new domestic terminal will also be built to the north to better utilize the new runway. The new runway will thus free up the longer southern runway to handle more heavy jet operations.Event marks start of new runway for Auckland Airport (Auckland Airport Media Release, Thursday 4 October 2007. Retrieved 2008-01-09.) The 10-year project would cost NZ$120 million, not including substantial extensions planned for the airport arrivals/departure buildings and associated structures.

In 2013, the domestic terminal will undergo a series of upgrades costing a total of $30 million. Stage one ran from January 2013 to March 2013, and involved changes to the drop off points and roads outside the terminal.Domestic Terminal Changes. Auckland Airport. Retrieved on 2013-07-16. In the second half of 2013, the baggage claim belts will be lengthened, parts of the apron will be changed, and new corridors will connect to the jetbridges. The two different sides to the terminals will share a centralised security screening area following the upgrade and an extra storey will be added to the western wing to provide an airside connection between the Air New Zealand side of the terminal and the Jetstar side of the terminal. The work is expected to take up to 12 months to complete.

==Terminals==

===International terminal===

Check-in counters are at the eastern end of the international terminal building on the ground level.

====Passenger separation====

Before 2006 Auckland Airport arriving and departing passengers were allowed to mingle airside. After the September 11 attacks, the airport operated with a CAA exemption that allowed this to continue, although flights to the US and all Qantas-operated flights (and for a short time Cathay Pacific flights) were restricted to leaving from gates where a secondary X-ray and metal detector inspection had been set up. This exemption expired in 2006.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2007[/tpl]
Auckland Airport decided that rather than building a new sub-top level to stream arriving passengers (as at Beijing, Vancouver, or Heathrow), they would build a new departures floor for passengers to "drop down" into the existing gate lounges on the first floor, which would be closed off from a central arrivals corridor by glass.

===Domestic terminal===

The two previously separate domestic terminal buildings have now been connected by a common retail area. The Jetstar check-in area is located in the western end of the terminal, in the building previously used by Ansett New Zealand, Qantas, and Pacific Blue. The Air New Zealand check-in area is located in the eastern end of the terminal.
Jetstar domestic services operate from gates 20, 21 (jetbridge gates), and 22 (tarmac only).  Air New Zealand mainline services operate from gates 24-33. Gates 29, 30, 32, and 33 have jetbridges, gates 24 and 28 are tarmac gates; gates 25, 26, 27, and 31 don't exist. Air New Zealand regional (Link) services operate from the regional section of the domestic terminal. This is located at the eastern end of the terminal and consists of gates 34-48 (excluding gate numbers 35, 37, 38, 41, and 44 which do not exist). These gates are linked to the terminal by covered walkways, and passengers walk across the apron to the aircraft.
Gates 50-59 are used by 3rd level operators Air Chathams, Great Barrier Airlines, Flight Hauraki, Fly My Sky and Sunair.

===Shareholders===

Auckland International Airport Limited (AIAL ) was formed in 1988, when the New Zealand Government corporatised the airport. It had previously been run by the Auckland Regional Authority, covering the five councils in the Auckland region.
The Government was AIAL’s majority shareholder, the rest being held by the local councils. In 1998 the Government sold its shareholding, and AIAL became the fifth airport company in the world to be publicly listed. At that time the major shareholders were Auckland City Council (25.8%), Manukau City Council (9.6%) and North Shore City Council (7.1%). North Shore City Council sold its shares in 1999 and Auckland City Council sold its share down to 12.8% in 2002. After amalgamation into the Auckland Council, the local authority now owns a 22.5% stake worth approximately $750 million as of 2012.[tpl]cite news|title=Auckland Council Investments Limited|accessdate=24 August 2012|newspaper=Our Auckland (Auckland Council newsletter)|date=August 2012[/tpl]
AIAL appears on the New Zealand Stock Exchange ([tpl]nzx|AIA[/tpl]) and Australian Stock Exchange ([tpl]Asx|AIA[/tpl]). International shareholders hold around 40% of the shares, domestic approximately 60%.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl] The company has a Standard & Poor's credit rating of A+/Stable/A-1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.standardandpoors.com|title=Standard & Poor's[/tpl]

===Revenue===

AIAL enjoys diverse revenue streams, and operates a 'dual-till' approach, whereby its finances are split into aeronautical and non-aeronautical balance sheets. Aeronautical income is derived from airfield charges, terminal services charge and the airport development charge (or departure fee). Non-aeronautical revenue comes from its significant property portfolio, car park, and retail income. Income from the non-aeronautical side of the business accounts for just over half of its revenue. The airport has been criticised by airlines, led by Air New Zealand, for its purportedly high landing charges. However research conducted in September 2010 by aviation consultants Jacobs indicates that Auckland Airport international charges are slightly below the average of the 20 largest international airports flown by Air New Zealand. Further research by aviation consultants Airbiz conducted in August 2010 indicates that Auckland Airport domestic landing charges are amongst the lowest in Australasia.
The diversity in revenue was of benefit during the downturn in international aviation following the events of 11 September 2001, and subsequently the 2002 Bali bombings, SARS outbreak and the Iraq War. The airport was able to rely on steady income from the non-aeronautical side of the business, which softened the blow of international events. In addition, New Zealand retained favour among the world’s travellers as a safe destination.
In July 2009 Auckland Airport elected to delay a scheduled increase in its landing charges from 1 July 2009 to assist its airline customers during the recession. The scheduled increase was put in place on 1 March 2010. The company has in the past reportedly been singled out by airline lobby group IATA for its consistent excessive level of profits. Airlines such as Air New Zealand complain of excessive landing charges.Remarks by Giovanni Bisignani - Global Press Briefing, Geneva: Auckland is an example (from an IATA press release, 2006-12-01. Retrieved 2007-11-11.) On 5 June 2007, the airport's 60% profit margin was criticised by IATA director general and CEO Giovanni Bisignani. He said the airport had a "happy monopoly" and that IATA would ask the New Zealand government to investigate.[tpl]cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411749/1167863|title=Auckland Airport labeled greedy|publisher=TV New Zealand, One News|date=6 June 2007|accessdate=2007-11-11| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071016203015/http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411749/1167863| archivedate= 16 October 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Until July 2008, AIAL charged all departing international passengers (12 years old or older) a $25 departure fee. This has been replaced with a passenger services charge levied on the airlines for each arriving and departing international passenger. This charge has commenced at $13 and will rise by 50 cents a year for two years to $14.[tpl]cite news|last=Eriksen|first=Alanah May|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10513139|title=Airport departure tax to be axed|publisher=NZ Herald|date=29 May 2008[/tpl]
Auckland Airport will cut the international passenger fee and would hike the domestic travellers charges in FY-2013.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Auckland-Airport-changes-fee-structure/tabid/421/articleID/256975/Default.aspx | title= Auckland Airport changes fee structure| date=7 June 2012[/tpl]

===Partnership with Queenstown Airport===

On 8 July 2010, AIAL announced it had entered into an agreement to take a 24.99% shareholding in Queenstown Airport Corporation Limited, the operator of Queenstown Airport, and form a strategic alliance between the two airports. The shareholding will cost NZ$27.7 million, through the issue of new shares. The alliance is expected to generate an extra 176,000 passengers through Queenstown Airport. AIAL has an option to increase its shareholding in Queenstown Airport to 30-35% at any time up to 30 June 2011, subject to  the approval of the Queenstown Lakes District Council. The new share capital from would allow Queenstown Airport to fund growth of the airport's operating capacity and to pay regular dividends back to the community via the Queenstown Lakes District Council shareholding.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aucklandairport.co.nz/Corporate/NewsAndMedia/AllMediaReleases/Auckland-Airport-and-Queenstown-Airport-strategic-alliance.aspx|title=Auckland Airport and Queenstown Airport strategic alliance - Auckland Airport|date=8 July 2010|accessdate=8 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.queenstownairport.co.nz/business/media-and-downloads/auckland-airport-and-queenstown-airport-alliance|title=Queenstown Lakes District set to benefit from an alliance between Queenstown and Auckland Airport: Media & downloads of Queenstown Airport|date=8 July 2010|accessdate=8 July 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==Access==

Auckland Airport's main access is by road.
A free shuttle bus connects the international and domestic terminals to each other; they are also linked by a walkway.
Two state highways connect to the airport: State Highway 20A and State Highway 20B. State Highway 20A leaves the airport to the north and allows access to central Auckland, the western and northern suburbs, and Northland. State Highway 20B leaves the airport to the east and allows access to southern and eastern Auckland, and the rest of the North Island. Currently, there is no direct motorway access to the airport, and at some point, airport traffic must use Auckland city streets. The completion of the State Highway 20 Manukau Extension in 2010 has allowed motorway access to the State Highway 1 via State Highway 20B. In light traffic, a trip to the central city takes around 40 – 45 minutes. Also, cycle lanes have been implemented on some highways to accommodate cyclists who wish to access the airport by bicycle.
Taxis and shuttles are available at both terminals.
