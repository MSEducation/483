[[Takangaroa]]

CATEGORIES: Hauraki Gulf

Takangaroa Island is one of the two Mayne Islands located near Kawau Island, in the Hauraki Gulf of New Zealand. It is approximately [tpl]convert|6|ha|acre[/tpl] in size.
Its name is Māori, and means "The Long Casting of the Net". Nearby Rabbit Island is known as Takangariki,"The Short Casting of the Net", and two rocky reefs between them are considered to be the buoys of the net.
The island used to be known as "Goat Island", but the name was legally changed to the Māori in order to prevent confusion with the popular Marine Reserve.
During the late 19th century, it was owned by Sir George Grey, the then Governor-General of New Zealand. The island is now privately owned, and is a Wildlife Sanctuary, meaning that no dogs, cats or guns are allowed.
