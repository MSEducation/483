Marie-Thérèse Levasseur, also known as Thérèse Le Vasseur and Thérèse Lavasseur, born 21 September 1721 in Orléans, died 17 July 1801 in Le Plessis-Belleville, was the domestic partner of Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
Thérèse Le Vassuer came from a respected family that had fallen on hard times; her father was a local official in Orléans, and her mother was a merchant. Thérèse and her mother moved to Paris to find work, and were later joined by her father.
Le Vasseur met Rousseau in Paris in 1745. Le Vasseur was working as a laundress and chambermaid at the Hotel Saint-Quentin in the rue des Cordiers, where Rousseau took his meals. She was 24 years old at the time, he was 33. According to Rousseau, Thérèse bore him five children, all of whom were given to the Enfants-Trouvés foundling home, the first in 1746 and the others in 1747, 1748, 1751, and 1752.
They went through a legally invalid marriage ceremony at Bourgoin on August 29, 1768. Therese provided Rousseau with support and care, and when he died, she was the sole inheritor of his belongings, including manuscripts and royalties.
After Rousseau's death in 1778, she married Jean-Henri Bally, a valet of René de Girardin, in November 1779. They lived together in Le Plessis-Belleville until her death in 1801.
Mount Lavasseur, Alaska, is named after her, for its proximity to  Rousseau Peak.
