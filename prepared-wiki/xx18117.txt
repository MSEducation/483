==Statistical properties==

Being uncorrelated in time does not restrict the values a signal can take. Any distribution of values is possible (although it must have zero DC component). Even a binary signal which can only take on the values 1 or -1 will be white if the sequence is statistically uncorrelated. Noise having a continuous distribution, such as a normal distribution, can of course be white.
It is often incorrectly assumed that Gaussian noise (i.e., noise with a Gaussian amplitude distribution — see normal distribution) necessarily refers to white noise, yet neither property implies the other. Gaussianity refers to the probability distribution with respect to the value, in this context the probability of the signal falling within any particular range of amplitudes, while the term 'white' refers to the way the signal power is distributed (i.e., independently) over time or among frequencies.
We can therefore find Gaussian white noise, but also Poisson, Cauchy, etc. white noises.  Thus, the two words "Gaussian" and "white" are often both specified in mathematical models of systems. Gaussian white noise is a good approximation of many real-world situations and generates mathematically tractable models. These models are used so frequently that the term additive white Gaussian noise has a standard abbreviation: AWGN.
White noise is the generalized mean-square derivative of the Wiener process or Brownian motion.
A generalization to random elements on infinite dimensional spaces, such as random fields, is the white noise measure.

==Practical applications==

===Music===

White noise is commonly used in the production of electronic music, usually either directly or as an input for a filter to create other types of noise signal. It is used extensively in audio synthesis, typically to recreate percussive instruments such as cymbals or snare drums which have high noise content in their frequency domain.

===Electronics engineering===

White noise is also used to obtain the impulse response of an electrical circuit, in particular of amplifiers and other audio equipment. It is not used for testing loudspeakers as its spectrum contains too great an amount of high frequency content. Pink noise, which differs from white noise in that it has equal energy in each octave, is used for testing transducers such as loudspeakers and microphones.

===Acoustics===

To set up the equalization for a concert or other performance in a venue, a short burst of white or pink noise is sent through the PA system and monitored from various points in the venue so that the engineer can tell if the acoustics of the building naturally boost or cut any frequencies. The engineer can then adjust the overall equalization to ensure a balanced mix.

===Computing===

White noise is used as the basis of some random number generators. For example, Random.org uses a system of atmospheric antennae to generate random digit patterns from white noise.

===Tinnitus treatment===

White noise is a common synthetic noise source used for sound masking by a tinnitus masker.[tpl] cite book|last=Jastreboff |first= P.

===Work environment===

The effects of white noise upon cognitive function are mixed. Recently, a small study found that white noise background stimulation improves cognitive functioning among secondary students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), while decreasing performance of non-ADHD students.[tpl]Cite journal| volume = 6| issue = 1| pages = 55| last = Soderlund| first = Goran| coauthors = Sverker Sikstrom, Jan Loftesnes, Edmund Sonuga Barke| title = The effects of background white noise on memory performance in inattentive school children| journal = Behavioral and Brain Functions| year = 2010| doi=10.1186/1744-9081-6-55[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01749.x | issn = 0021-9630 | volume = 48 | issue = 8 | pages = 840–847 | last = Söderlund | first = Göran | coauthors = Sverker Sikström, Andrew Smart | title = Listen to the noise: Noise is beneficial for cognitive performance in ADHD. | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | year = 2007 [/tpl] Other work indicates it is effective in improving the mood and performance of workers by masking background office noise,[tpl]Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0013916592243006 | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 381–395 | last = Loewen | first = Laura J. | coauthors = Peter Suedfeld | title = Cognitive and Arousal Effects of Masking Office Noise | journal = Environment and Behavior | accessdate = 2011-10-28 | date = 1992-05-01 | url = http://eab.sagepub.com/content/24/3/381.abstract [/tpl] but decreases cognitive performance in complex card sorting tasks.[tpl]Cite journal | issn = 0022-1309 | volume = 120 | issue = 3 | pages = 339–355 | last = Baker | first = Mary Anne | coauthors = Dennis H.

==Mathematical definitions==

===White noise vector===

A random vector (that is, a partially indeterminate process that produces vectors of real numbers) is said to be a white noise vector or white random vector if its components each have a probability distribution with zero mean and finite variance, and are statistically independent: that is, their joint probability distribution must be the product of the distributions of the individual components.[ref]
  Jeffrey A. Fessler (1998), [http://andywilliamson.org/_/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/White-Noise.pdf ''On Transformations of Random Vectors.''] Technical report 314, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Univ. of Michigan.</ref>
A necessary (but, in general, not sufficient) condition for statistical independence of two variables is that they be statistically uncorrelated; that is, their covariance is zero.  Therefore, the  covariance matrix R of the components of a white noise vector w with n elements must be an n by n diagonal matrix, where each diagonal element Rii is the variance of component wi; and the correlation matrix must the n by n identity matrix.
If w is a white random vector, but not a Gaussian one, its Fourier coefficients Wi will not be completely independent of each other; although for large n and common probability distributions the dependencies are very subtle, and their pairwise correlations can be assumed to be zero.
Often the weaker condition "statistically uncorrelated" is used in the definition of white noise, instead of "statistically independent".  However some of the commonly expected properties of white noise (such as flat power spectrum) may not hold for this weaker version.  Under this assumption, the stricter version can be referred to explicitly as independent white noise vector.[ref]

An example of a random vector that is "Gaussian white noise" in the weak but not in the strong sense is x=x1,x2 where x1 is a normal random variable with zero mean, and x2 is equal to +x1 or to −x1, with equal probability.  These two variables are uncorrelated and individually normally distributed, but they are not jointly normally distributed and are not independent.  If x is rotated by 45 degrees, its two components will still be uncorrelated, but their distribution will no longer be normal.

===Continuous-time white noise===

[/ref]  As in the discrete case, some authors adopt the weaker definition for "white noise", and use the qualifier independent to refer to either of the stronger definitions.  Others use weakly white and strongly white to distinguish between them.

==Mathematical applications==

===Time series analysis and regression===

In statistics and econometrics one often assumes that an observed series of data values is the sum of a series of values generated by a deterministic linear process, depending on certain independent (explanatory) variables, and on a series of random noise values.  Then regression analysis is used to infer the parameters of the model process from the observed data, e.g. by ordinary least squares, and to test the null hypothesis that each of the parameters is zero against the alternative hypothesis that it is non-zero.  Hypothesis testing typically assumes that the noise values are mutually uncorrelated with zero mean and the same Gaussian probability distribution — in other words, that the noise is white.  If there is non-zero correlation between the noise values underlying different observations then the estimated model parameters are still unbiased, but estimates of their uncertainties (such as confidence intervals) will be biased (not accurate on average).  This is also true if the noise is heteroskedastic — that is, if it has different variances for different data points.
Alternatively, in the subset of regression analysis known as time series analysis there are often no explanatory variables other than the past values of the variable being modeled (the dependent variable). In this case the noise process is often modeled as a moving average process, in which the current value of the dependent variable depends on current and past values of a sequential white noise process.

===Random vector transformations===

These two ideas are crucial in applications such as channel estimation and channel equalization in communications and audio. These concepts are also used in data compression.
In particular, by a suitable linear transformation (a coloring transformation), a white random vector can be used to produce a "non-white" random vector (that is, a list of random variables) whose elements have a prescribed covariance matrix.  Conversely, a random vector with known covariance matrix can be transformed into a white random vector by a suitable whitening transformation.

==Generation==

White noise may be generated digitally with a digital signal processor, microprocessor, or microcontroller. Generating white noise typically entails feeding an appropriate stream of random numbers to a digital-to-analog converter. The quality of the white noise will depend on the quality of the algorithm used.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.dspguru.com/dsp/howtos/how-to-generate-white-gaussian-noise |title=How to Generate White Gaussian Noise |author=Matt Donadio |accessdate=2012-09-19[/tpl]
