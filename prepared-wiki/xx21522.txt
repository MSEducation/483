ITV is a commercial public service TV network in the United Kingdom. Launched in 1955 as Independent Television under the auspices of the Independent Television Authority (ITA, then after the Sound Broadcasting Act 1972, Independent Broadcasting Authority, now Ofcom) to provide competition to the BBC,[tpl]cite news|title=Commercial Television: A Guide to the constitution and working of the new service|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/newspaperRetrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&sort=Relevance&tabID=T003&prodId=TTDA&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchId=R2&searchType=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition=3&qrySerId=Locale%28en%2C%2C%29%3AFQE%3D%28tx%2CNone%2C22%29Independent+television%3AAnd%3ALQE%3D%28da%2CNone%2C23%2901%2F01%2F1950+-+12%2F31%2F1955%24&retrieveFormat=MULTIPAGE_DOCUMENT&userGroupName=hamlib&inPS=true&contentSet=LTO&&docId=&docLevel=FASCIMILE&workId=&relevancePageBatch=CS335762707&contentSet=UDVIN&callistoContentSet=UDVIN&docPage=article&hilite=y|accessdate=18 January 2013|newspaper=Times|date=19 August 1955[/tpl] it is also the oldest commercial network in the UK. Since the passing of the Broadcasting Act 1990 its legal name has been Channel 3, to distinguish it from the other analogue channels at the time, namely BBC 1, BBC 2 and Channel 4. In part, the number 3 was assigned as television sets would usually be tuned so that the regional ITV station would be on the third button, with the other stations being allocated to the number within their name.
ITV is a network of television channels that operate regional television services as well as sharing programmes between each other to be displayed on the entire network. In recent years, several of these companies have merged so currently the fifteen franchises are in the hands of three companies.
The ITV network is to be distinguished from ITV plc, the company that resulted from the merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications in 2004 and which holds the Channel 3 broadcasting licences in England, Wales, southern Scotland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Similarly the ITV brand is the brand used by ITV plc for the Channel 3 service in these areas. Of the companies external to ITV plc, STV and UTV use their own brands in their own respective areas (northern and central Scotland and Northern Ireland).

==History==

The origins of ITV lie in the passing of the Television Act 1954, designed to break the monopoly on television held by the BBC Television Service. To prevent any commercial network reverting to the 'vulgar' nature of US commercial networks at the time, the act created the Independent Television Authority (ITA, then IBA after the Sound Broadcasting Act) to heavily regulate the industry and to award franchises. The first six franchises were awarded in 1954 for London, the Midlands and the North of England, with separate franchises for Weekdays and Weekends. The first ITV network to launch was London's Associated-Rediffusion on 22 September 1955, with the midlands and North services launching in February 1956 and May 1956 respectively. Following these launches, the ITA awarded more franchises until the whole country was covered by a regional station, totaling fourteen, with all stations launched by 1962.
The network has been modified several times through franchise reviews that have taken place in 1963,[tpl]cite news|title=No New Independent Tv Companies Appointed|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=hamlib&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=CS168388137&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|accessdate=18 January 2013|newspaper=Times|date=9 January 1964[/tpl] 1967,[tpl]cite news|title=BIG five' pattern for Independent TV|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=hamlib&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=CS18705302&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|accessdate=18 January 2013|newspaper=Times|date=22 December 1966[/tpl] 1974,[tpl]cite news|title=Discussions start on TV contract extensions|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=hamlib&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=CS335903563&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|accessdate=18 January 2013|newspaper=Times|date=11 October 1974[/tpl] 1980[tpl]cite news|last=Gosling|first=Kenneth|title=Breakfast-time television and dual regions for Midlands and the South planned by IBA|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=hamlib&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=CS67339833&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|accessdate=19 January 2013|newspaper=Times|date=25 January 1980[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Gosling|first=Kenneth|title=Southern and Westward TV lose franchises and others to be restructured|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=hamlib&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=CS17008541&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|accessdate=19 January 2013|newspaper=Times|date=29 December 1980[/tpl] and 1991,[tpl]cite news|last=Wittstock|first=Melinda|title=Legal threats follow biggest ITV shake-up|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=hamlib&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&docId=IF501890705&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|accessdate=19 January 2013|newspaper=Times|date=17 October 1991[/tpl] during which broadcast regions have changed and service operators have been replaced.

Weekend services were removed, with the exception of London, in 1964 and over the years more services were added including a teletext service and a national breakfast franchise, operating between 6:00 and 9:25am, in 1983. The Broadcasting Act 1990 changed the nature of ITV; the then regulator the IBA was replaced with a light-touch regulator the ITC, companies now able to purchase other ITV regional companies[tpl]cite news|last=Frean|first=Alexandra|title=ITV rule changes herald takeovers|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=hamlib&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=IF502007373&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|accessdate=19 January 2013|newspaper=Times|date=25 November 1993[/tpl] and franchises were now being awarded based upon a highest-bidder auction, with few safeguards in place. This heavily criticized part of the review saw four operators replaced and the operators facing different annual payments to the treasury: Central television for example only paid £2000, despite holding a lucrative and large region because they were unopposed, while Yorkshire television paid £37.7 million for a region of the same size and status due to heavy competition.ITC, quoted in Encouraging Bidding In The Single Licence National Lottery Framework report, UK National Lottery Commission, 19 November 2004
Following the 1993 changes, ITV as a network began to consolidate with several companies doing so to save money by ceasing the duplication of services present when they were all separate companies. By 2004, ITV was owned by five companies of which two, Carlton and Granada had become major players by owning between the two all the franchises in England, Wales, the Scottish borders and the Isle of Man.[tpl]cite web|title=History|url=http://www.itvplc.com/about/history|publisher=ITV plc|accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Madslein|first=Jorn|title=ITV: A third force in broadcasting|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3445627.stm|accessdate=19 January 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=2 February 2004[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Tryhorn|first=Chris|title=Finally, ITV plc is born|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2004/feb/02/citynews.ITV?INTCMP=SRCH|accessdate=19 January 2013|newspaper=Guardian|date=2 February 2004|location=London[/tpl] That same year, the two merged to form ITV plc with the only subsequent acquisition being the takeover of Channel Television, the Channel Islands franchise, in 2011.[tpl]cite news|last=Mark Sweney|first=Tara Conlan|title=ITV plc buys Channel Television|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/oct/18/itv-plc-buys-channel-television|accessdate=19 January 2013|date=18 October 2011|location=London|work=The Guardian[/tpl]

==Organisation==

The ITV Network is not owned or operated by one company, but rather by a series of licensees that provide a regional service while also broadcasting programmes across the network. Since 2011 the fifteen licences are held by three companies, with the majority held by ITV Broadcasting Limited, part of ITV plc.
The network is regulated by the media regulator Ofcom who is responsible for awarding the broadcast licences. The last major review of the Channel 3 franchises was in 1991, with all operators' licences having being renewed between 1999 and 2002 and again from 2014 without a further contest. While this has been the longest period that the ITV Network has gone without a major review of its licence holders, Ofcom announced (following consultation) that it would split the Wales and West licence from 1 January 2014, creating a national licence for Wales and joining the newly separated West region to Westcountry, to form a new licence for the enlarged South West of England region. 
All companies holding a licence were part of the non-profit body ITV Network Limited, which commissioned and scheduled network programming, with compliance previously handled by ITV plc and Channel Television. However, due to amalgamation of several of these companies since the creation of ITV Network Limited (and given Channel Television is now owned by ITV plc), it has been replaced by an affiliation system.[tpl]cite news|last=McIvor|first=Jamie|title=Broadcaster STV reaches new deal with ITV|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-17258458|accessdate=19 January 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=5 March 2012[/tpl] Approved by Ofcom, this results in ITV plc commissioning and funding the network schedule, with STV and UTV paying a fee to broadcast it. All licensees have the right to opt out of network programming (except for the national news bulletins), however many do not due to pressures from the parent company or because of limited resources. Prior to the affiliate system being introduced, STV would frequently (and sometimes controversially) opt out of several popular network programmes – such as the original run of the first series of Downton Abbey – citing the need to provide more Scottish content to its viewers.[tpl]cite news|last=McIvor|first=Jamie|title=STV counts cost of ITV peace deal|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-14663137|accessdate=19 January 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=25 August 2011[/tpl]
As a public service broadcaster, the ITV network is obliged to broadcast programming of public importance, including news, current affairs, children's and religious programming as well as party election broadcasts on behalf of the major political parties and political events, such as the Budget. The network also needs to produce accessible output containing subtitles, signing and audio description. In exchange for this programming, the ITV network is available on all platforms free to air and can be found at the top of the EPG of all providers.
Since the launch of the platform in 1998, all of the ITV licensees have received gifted capacity on the digital terrestrial television platform. At present, the companies are able to broadcast additional channels and all choose to broadcast the ITV plc owned ITV2, ITV3, ITV4 and CITV in their region. UTV and STV (formerly Scottish TV and Grampian TV) previously broadcast their own services - UTV2 in Northern Ireland and S2 in central and northern Scotland - until 2002, when they adopted the ITV plc channels. The broadcasters all make use of the Digital 3&4 multiplex, shared with Channel 4.

===ITV plc===

ITV plc owns twelve of the fifteen franchises and broadcasts to England, Wales, southern Scotland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands through its subsidiary companies ITV Broadcasting Limited and Channel Television Limited. The company also owns the breakfast contractor[tpl]cite news|last=Robinson|first=James|title=ITV takes full control of breakfast TV broadcaster GMTV|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/nov/26/itv-buys-remaining-gmtv-stake|accessdate=19 January 2013|newspaper=Guardian|date=26 November 2009|location=London[/tpl] that broadcasts across the network between 6:00 and 9:25am each morning using the Daybreak and Lorraine names. The company broadcasts a centralized service under the ITV brand. ITV Wales also adds Wales to some of its presentation.
The group also owns ITV Studios, the production arm of the company and formed from an amalgamation of all the production departments of the regional licenses they own. The company produces a large proportion of ITV's networked programming (around 47%, but previously as high as 66% according to some reports[tpl]cite news|title=Lygo quits Channel 4|publisher=C21 Media|date=30 April 2010|url=http://www.c21media.net/news/detail.asp|accessdate =1 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl]), with the rest coming primarily from independent suppliers (Under the Broadcasting Act 1990, at least 25% of ITV's total output must be from independent companies).[tpl]cite news|last=Evans|first=Richard|title=Dispute over ITV and BBC quotas|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=hamlib&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=IF500068544&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|accessdate=19 January 2013|newspaper=Times|date=20 June 1990[/tpl] ITV plc hope to increase the amount of in-house programming to as close to the 75% limit as possible.
The group has recently cut the number of regional news programmes offered from 17 in 2007 to 9 by 2009, resulting several regions being merged to form one programme, including the Border and Tyne Tees regions, the Westcountry and West regions and the removal of sub regional programming, with some regions only represented by pre-recorded segments.[tpl]cite news| title = Unions slam ITV regional cuts| publisher = MediaGuardian| date = 12 September 2007| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/sep/12/citynews.ITV| accessdate =27 September 2007| location=London| first=Leigh| last=Holmwood[/tpl]

===STV Group===

STV Group plc owns two franchises, covering central and northern Scotland, through subsidiary companies STV Central and STV North, broadcasting a central service under the STV brand.
The company has had several disputes with ITV plc in recent years over network programming. STV aims to broadcast more Scottish programmes at peak times and so removed several key ITV plc programmes from their schedule in July 2009 including The Bill, Midsomer Murders and Lewis.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/jul/21/bill-shown-itv3-scottish-viewers |title=The Bill to be shown on ITV3 so Scottish viewers don't miss out |publisher=The Guardian |date=21 July 2009 |accessdate=2 November 2010 |first=Leigh |last=Holmwood |location=London[/tpl] Despite STV's explanation of expense, ITV plc were angered by the decision, as a recent schedule change had made The Bill central to their programming, and broadcast the programmes on ITV3 as well to ensure Scottish viewers could see the programmes. On 23 September ITV was reported to be in the process of suing STV for £20 million, as ITV plc felt dropping the shows constituted a breach of network agreements;http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5i7gPWqGPoP6kbw-nW2YpRPhgXGBA[tpl]dead link|date=February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8269151.stm | work=BBC News | title=ITV launches £38m STV legal claim | date=22 September 2009 | accessdate=5 May 2010[/tpl] STV subsequently counter-sued ITV plc for £35 million.
The dispute was ended in 2011 with STV agreeing to pay ITV plc £18 million. The signing of the new affiliation deal has resulted in STV paying a flat fee for all networked programming, and so to drop any programmes is unlikely due to the large costs involved.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.business7.co.uk/business-news/scottish-business-news/2012/03/05/stv-agrees-new-channel-3-licensing-deal-with-itv-106408-23775954/|title=Business7 – Business News – Scottish Business News – STV agrees new Channel 3 licensing deal with ITV|last=McCulloch|first=Scott|date=5 March 2012|work=Business7|accessdate=28 April 2012[/tpl]

===UTV Media===

UTV Media plc owns the Northern Ireland franchise and broadcasts a regional service, through subsidiary UTV Limited, under the UTV brand (an abbreviation of Ulster Television).[tpl]cite web|title=About UTV – Television|url=http://www.utvmedia.com/pages/About-UTV/television|publisher=UTV Media|accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl] The service broadcasts several regional programmes for the benefit of their audience and is also widely available in the Republic of Ireland. UTV Media plc operates several other media ventures, including a planned Irish channel to launch in 2015 (subject to approval of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland) and the sports radio station Talksport.

==Current licensees==

There are fourteen regional licences and one national licence for the breakfast service. Other licences exist to provide specific programming services, such as Teletext and national news, but are not listed here. All licences listed here were renewed until the end of 2014. Licences in England and Wales were held by the individual regional ITV plc owned companies prior to November 2008.[tpl]cite news| title =      Television Broadcast Licensing Update November 2008| publisher =  Ofcom| date =       November 2008| url =http://licensing.ofcom.org.uk/tv-broadcast-licences/updates/200811| accessdate =20 September 2012[/tpl]

==Programming==

For over 50 years of ITV, the homegrown programmes have become the best loved and remembered as well as being extremely successful. Before the 1990s, nearly all of the content for the channel was produced by the fifteen franchise licensees: the regional companies.
However, in the last decade, and following legislation in the Broadcasting Act 1990 imposing a 25% quota for commissioning of independent productions, the number of programmes from independent production companies not connected to the traditional ITV Network, has increased rapidly. Notable examples include Talkback Thames (one half of which, Thames Television, was itself a former ITV franchisee), producers of The Bill and co-producers of The X Factor, and 2waytraffic (previously Celador), producers of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?.
From the late 1990s, ITV's long-standing commitment to strong current affairs and documentary programming began to diminish with the ending of productions such as World in Action (Granada), This Week (Rediffusion/Thames), First Tuesday (Yorkshire Television), Network First, Survival (Anglia Television), and Weekend World (LWT) and their replacement with populist shows such as Tonight. News at Ten was also axed in 1999, although it was reinstated in 2008. In December 2009, the final edition of ITV's long-running arts programme, The South Bank Show was broadcast.
Increasingly ITV's primetime schedules are dominated by its soap operas, such as the flagship Coronation Street and Emmerdale. At the start of the 21st century, Independent Television faced criticism for including a large amount of "reality TV" programmes in the schedule, such as Celebrity Fit Club, Celebrity Wrestling and Love Island. In its defence, ITV does continue to show its major strengths in the fields of sports coverage and drama productions, and it continues to schedule national news in primetime.
ITV's strong daytime lineup helped by programmes such as This Morning, Loose Women, Dickinson's Real Deal and game shows Tipping Point and The Chase are very popular, acheving the highest audience share during the daytime slot.[tpl]cite web|last=Brown |first=Maggie |url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/25/bbc1-daytime-tv-revamp-ratings |title=BBC1 daytime revamp hits BBC2 and Channel 4 ratings |publisher=The Guardian |date=2013-01-25 |accessdate=2013-08-18[/tpl]

===National and international news===

Since the network started, Independent Television News Limited (ITN) has held the contract to produce news for the ITV Network, with 30 minute national news bulletins broadcast at 1:30pm, 6:30pm, and 10:00pm. These bulletins were broadcast under the ITN brand between 1955 and 1999, when a new network identity reinforced the ITV brand, resulting in the new bulletins being broadcast under the ITV News brand.[tpl]cite web|title=About ITN|url=http://corporate.itn.co.uk/about.php|publisher=ITN|accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=ITV News|url=http://corporate.itn.co.uk/content.php?content_id=25|publisher=ITN|accessdate=19 January 2013[/tpl]
ITN has long been respected in the news industry as a source of reliable information and news, and as a result the service has won many awards for their programmes, the latest being in May 2011 when News at Ten was named best news programme by the Royal Television Society and BAFTA.

===Regional news===

The regional ITV companies are required to provide local news as part of their franchise agreement, with the main local bulletin at 6pm and regional bulletins located after each national news programme. In addition to this, traditionally ITV companies would provide other regional programming based on current affairs, entertainment or drama. However, apart from a monthly political programme, most non-news regional programming in the English regions was dropped by ITV plc in 2009, although it continues in Wales and the Channel Islands, as well as on STV and UTV.[tpl]cite news|last=Douglas|first=Torin|title=Analysis: Ofcom's regional news proposals|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7635822.stm|accessdate=19 January 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=25 September 2008[/tpl] On 14 January 2013, ITV plc regional news programmes titles were discontinued in favour of more generic branding, i.e. North East Tonight became ITV News Tyne Tees.

===Weather===

The ITV National Weather forecast was first broadcast in 1989, using data supplied by the Met Office, and was presented by a number of weather forecasters. The forecasts are sponsored in which the sponsors message, as of December 2012 Seven Seas or STV Health Centre, would appear prior to the forecast. The forecasts are made immediately after the main national news bulletins.
Prior to the creation of the national forecast, regional forecast provided by each regional companies were shown in each region only. The regional forecasts today are incorporated into the main regional news bulletins, and in the ITV plc regions includes a Pollen Count.

===Sport===

ITV covers many popular sports. The channel emphasises coverage of football, with the channel holding the UK terrestrial rights to the UEFA Champions League and with the channel sharing coverage of international football events such as the World Cup with the BBC. On 30 March 2007 The Football Association confirmed that it had agreed a new four-year £425m television deal for ITV and Setanta Sports to show FA Cup and England home international matches (the Scottish regional broadcaster STV replaces these games with regular programming). The deal with the FA represented a 42% increase on the existing deal with BBC Sport and BSkyB.
In May 2009, ITV acquired the rights to broadcast live cricket from the Indian Premier League. The network also covers motorsport, rugby, and other sports.

===Children's programming===

The network broadcasts children's programming under the CITV (Children's ITV) strand. Children's programming was originally provided during weekday afternoons and weekend mornings, however following the launch of the CITV Channel in 2006, all children's programming, with the exception of the weekend ITV Breakfast slot, were relocated from the ITV line-up to the CITV channel in 2007, a move which was challenged by Ofcom in April 2007.
