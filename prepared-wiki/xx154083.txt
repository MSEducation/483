[[Drill, Ye Tarriers, Drill]]

CATEGORIES: American folk songs, Songs about trains, 1888 songs

"Drill, Ye Tarriers, Drill" is an American folk song first published in 1888 and attributed to Thomas Casey (words) and much later Charles Connolly (music). The song is a work song, and makes references to the construction of the American railroads in the mid-19th century. The tarriers of the title refers to Irish workers, drilling holes in rock to blast out railroad tunnels. It may mean either to tarry as in delay, or to terrier dogs which dig their quarry out of the ground,Long Steel Rail: The Railroad in American Folksong (1980, 2000) by Norm Cohen, University of Illinois Press, p. 555, ISBN 0-252-06881-5 or from the French word for a drill, tari√®re.

==Lyrics==

Every morning at seven o'clock 
There's twenty tarriers a workin at the rock 
The boss comes along and he says, "Keep still 
And come down heavy on the cast iron drill." 
Chorus 
So drill, ye tarriers, drill 
And drill, ye tarriers, drill 
Oh it's work all day for the sugar in your tay 
Down beyond the railway 
So drill, ye tarriers, drill. 
Our new foreman is John McCann 
By God, He was a blamed mean man 
Last week a premature blast went off 
And a mile in the air went big Jim Goff. 
Chorus 
So drill, ye tarriers, drill 
And drill, ye tarriers, drill 
Oh it's work all day for the sugar in your tay 
Down beyond the railway 
So drill, ye tarriers, drill. 
Next time payday comes around 
Jim Goff was short one buck he found 
"What for?" asked he, then this reply 
"You were docked for the time you were up in the sky." 
Chorus 
So drill, ye tarriers, drill 
And drill, ye tarriers, drill 
Oh it's work all day for the sugar in your tay 
Down beyond the railway 
So drill, ye tarriers, drill.
