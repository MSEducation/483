After supporting roles in the NBC medical drama ER (1996) and films such as Wag the Dog (1997), Small Soldiers (1998) and The Virgin Suicides (1999), Dunst transitioned into romantic comedies and comedy-dramas, starring in Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999), Bring It On (2000), Get Over It and Crazy/Beautiful (both 2001).

Until the age of eleven, Dunst lived in Brick Township, New Jersey, where she attended Ranney School.O'Sullivan, Eleanor. "The Jersey Shore's Starlet", Asbury Park Press, May 4, 2007. Accessed July 5, 2011. "Dunst, who was born in Point Pleasant, raised in Brick and schooled for a while at the Ranney School in Tinton Falls, has achieved an acting career unlike any of her peers." In 1993, her parents separated, and she subsequently moved with her mother and younger brother to Los Angeles, California, where she attended Laurel Hall School in North Hollywood. In 1995, her mother filed for divorce. The following year Dunst began attending Notre Dame High School, a private Roman Catholic high school in Los Angeles.
After graduating from Notre Dame High School in 2000, Dunst continued the acting career that she had begun. As a teenager, she found it difficult to deal with her rising fame, and for a period she blamed her mother for pushing her into acting as a child.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl] However, she later expressed that her mother "always had the best intentions". When asked if she had any regrets about the way she spent her childhood, Dunst said: "Well, it's not a natural way to grow up, but it's the way I grew up and I wouldn't change it. I have my stuff to work out ... I don't think anybody can sit around and say: 'My life is more screwed up than yours.' Everybody has their issues."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/kirsten-dunst-far-from-an-ingeacutenue-513758.html|title=Kirsten Dunst: Far from an ingénue|last=Applebaum|first=Stephen|date=November 4, 2005|work=The Independent |location=UK |accessdate=December 11, 2008 [/tpl]

===Critical success===

The breakthrough role in Dunst's career came in Interview with the Vampire, a 1994 film based on Anne Rice's novel, in which she played the child vampire Claudia, a surrogate daughter to Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt's characters in the film.[tpl]cite news|first=Peter|last=Travers|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/interview-with-the-vampire-19940101|title=Interview with the Vampire|accessdate=March 10, 2011|date=November 11, 1994|work=Rolling Stone[/tpl] The film received ambivalent reviews,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/interview-with-the-vampire-the-vampire-chronicles|title=Interview with the Vampire (1994): Reviews|date=November 11, 1994|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=December 9, 2008[/tpl] but many film critics complimented Dunst's performance. Roger Ebert commented that Dunst's creation of the child vampire Claudia was one of the "creepier" aspects of the film, and mentioned her ability to convey the impression of great age inside apparent youth.[tpl]cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19941111/REVIEWS/411110301/1023|title=Interview With The Vampire|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=November 11, 1994|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=August 6, 2008[/tpl] Todd McCarthy in Variety noted that Dunst was "just right" for the family.[tpl]cite news|first=Todd|last=McCarthy|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117903342.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0|title=Interview with the Vampire Review|accessdate=August 6, 2008|date=November 7, 1994|work=Variety [/tpl] The film featured a scene in which Dunst shared her first on-screen kiss with Pitt, who was eighteen years her senior.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,304492,00.html|title=Interview With the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles review|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|date=November 18, 1994|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=August 4, 2008[/tpl] In an interview with Interview magazine, she revealed, while questioned about her kissing scene with Pitt, that kissing him had made her feel uncomfortable: "I thought it was gross, that Brad had cooties.

Ms. Dunst, also scarily effective as the baby bloodsucker of Interview With the Vampire, is a little vamp with a big future."[tpl]cite news|first=Janet|last=Maslin|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE0D81038F932A15751C1A962958260|title=Little Women Review|accessdate=August 6, 2008|date=December 21, 1994|work=The New York Times[/tpl]

Dunst was offered the role of Angela in the 1999 drama film American Beauty, but turned it down because she did not want to appear in the film's suggestive sexual scenes or kiss co-star Kevin Spacey. She later explained: "When I read it, I was 15 and I don't think I was mature enough to understand the script's material." That same year, she appeared in the comedy Dick, alongside Michelle Williams. The film is a parody retelling the events of the Watergate scandal which led to the resignation of U.S. president Richard Nixon.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/film/080499dick-film-review.html|title='Dick': That Gap in the Nixon Tapes?

In his review, A. O. Scott called her "a terrific comic actress, largely because of her great expressive range, and the nimbleness with which she can shift from anxiety to aggression to genuine hurt." Charles Taylor of Salon noted that "among contemporary teenage actresses, Dunst has become the sunniest imaginable parodist", even though he thought the film had failed to provide her with as good a role as she had either in Dick or in The Virgin Suicides.[tpl]cite web |last=Taylor |first=Charles |date=August 25, 2000 |title="Bring It On": Two, four, six, eight, who do we appreciate?
