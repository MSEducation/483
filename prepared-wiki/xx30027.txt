[[Room 101]]

CATEGORIES: Fictional rooms, Torture, Fictional prisons, Nineteen Eighty-Four locations

Room 101 is a place introduced in the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. It is a torture chamber in the Ministry of Love in which the Party attempts to subject a prisoner to his or her own worst nightmare, fear or phobia. 
Such is the purported omniscience of the state in the society of Nineteen Eighty-Four that even a citizen's nightmares are known to the Party. The nightmare, and therefore the threatened punishment, of the protagonist Winston Smith is to be attacked by rats.  Smith saves himself by begging the authorities to let his lover, Julia, have her face gnawed by the ferocious rodents instead. The torture, and what Winston does to escape it, breaks his last promise to himself and to Julia: never to betray her emotionally. The book suggests that Julia is likewise subjected to her own worst fear (although it isn't revealed what her worst fear is), and when she and Winston later meet in a park, he notices a scar on her forehead. The original intent of threatening Winston with the rats was not necessarily to go through with the act, but to force him into betraying the only person he loved and therefore break his spirit.
Orwell named Room 101 after a conference room at Broadcasting House where he used to sit through tedious meetings.[tpl]cite web |title=The Real Room 101 |publisher=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/room-101.shtml |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070105132434/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/room-101.shtml |archivedate=5 January 2007[/tpl] Meyers, Jeffery.

==Cultural impact==

The novel's popularity has resulted in the term "Room 101" being used to represent a place where unpleasant things are done.  According to Anna Funder's book Stasiland, Erich Mielke, the last Minister of State Security (Stasi) of East Germany, had the floors of the Stasi headquarters renumbered so that his second floor office would be number 101.[tpl]cite news | accessdate=2008-02-02| date=18 June 2004| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/anna-funder-inside-the-real-room-101-732525.html| title=Anna Funder: Inside the real Room 101|work=The Independent| location=London| first1=Sholto| last1=Byrnes| first2=Boyd| last2=Tonkin[/tpl] (Profile of Funder and her book, Stasiland)
In the BBC comedy television series Room 101, celebrities are invited to discuss their pet hates and persuade the host to consign them to a fate worse than death in Room 101.
In the 2005 series of Big Brother (UK), a housemate was required to enter a Room 101 to complete tedious and unpleasant tasks, including sorting different colours of maggots.
In The Ricky Gervais Show, Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant play a game called "Room 102," based on the concept of "Room 101," in which Karl Pilkington has to decide what things he dislikes enough to put in Room 102. This would result, according to their game, in these things being erased from existence.

===In Fiction===

The concept of a "Room 101" has also entered into many fictional works.
In The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier, the physical location of Room 101 (and the Ministry of Love) is given as the MI5 headquarters at Vauxhall Cross. 
In the 2011 Doctor Who episode, "The God Complex", the Doctor and his companions find themselves in a hotel full of their own personal Room 101s, each with their greatest fear in it.[tpl]cite web|first=Matt|last=Risely|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/18/doctor-who-the-god-complex-review|title=Doctor Who: "The God Complex" Review|publisher=IGN|date=18 September 2011|accessdate=31 March 2012[/tpl]
One sketch on That Mitchell and Webb Sound involved the hapless residents of room 102, the telescreen repair centre, who could not ignore the things happening in the next room. They were greatly inconvenienced by some of the more irrational fears, like killer whales, and suspicious of the number of people who claimed their worst fear was sex.
