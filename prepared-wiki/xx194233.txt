The Bevier House Museum, referred to simply as the Bevier House or Bevier Stone House prior to its conversion from a private residence, is located in Marbletown, near Kingston, New York. The house is also the home of the Ulster County Historical Society and is currently open to the public as a museum.
Bevier House is believed to have been constructed around 1680 by Andries Pieterse Van Leuven.Van Leuven, Audrey (1979). Van Leuven Geneology. The original part of the house, currently the kitchen, was designed in the Dutch style and was probably a one-room, one-story structure. In 1715, the house was bought for 440 pounds from Pieter Andries Van Leuven by Louis Bevier, Jr., son of the New Paltz patentee,[tpl]cite book | title=The Bevier Family: The Descendants of Louis Bevier, Patentee of New Paltz| last=Hasbrouck| first=Kenneth|author2=Katherine Bevier| date=1970| publisher=Huguenot Historical Society[/tpl] who expanded the structure and operated it as part of a large farm.[tpl]cite book | title=The Bevier Family: A History of the Descendants of Louis Bevier| last=Bevier| first=Katherine| date=2000| pages=19| publisher=Higginson Book Company[/tpl] The house was donated to the Historical Society in 1938 after being used by seven generations of the Bevier Family between 1715 and 1939, during which it was expanded to the two-story building currently standing.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.dailyfreeman.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=11427171&BRD=1769&PAG=461&dept_id=74969&rfi=6|title=Simple Treasures|accessdate=2008-04-30|publisher=Journal Register|date=2004-05-03|author=Hallie Arnold|work=Daily Freeman[/tpl]
