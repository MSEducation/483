A core city of the Yangtze River Delta, Hangzhou has a position on the Hangzhou Bay [tpl]convert|180|km[/tpl] southwest of Shanghai that gives it economic power. It has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities of China for much of the last 1,000 years, due in part to its beautiful natural scenery. The city's West Lake is its best-known attraction.

==History==

===Early history===

The celebrated Neolithic culture of Hemudu inhabited Yuyao, an area (now a city) [tpl]convert|100|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] south-east of Hangzhou, as far back as seven thousand years ago,Yan Wenming (2005) "The Beginning of Farming", pp.27–42 of The Formation of Chinese Civilization: An Archaeological Perspective, Kwang-Chih Chang, Pingfang Xu, Sarah Allan, Liancheng Lu (eds.), Yale University Press, ISBN 978-0-300-09382-7. pp.36 when rice was first cultivated in southeastern China.Fuller, Dorian Q, Ling Qin, Yunfei Zheng, Zhijun Zhao, Xugao Chen, Leo Aoi Hosoya, and Guo-ping Sun (2009) "The Domestication Process and Domestication Rate in Rice: Spikelet bases from the Lower Yangtze". Science 323: 1607–1610 [tpl]doi|10.1126/science.1166605[/tpl] The area immediately surrounding the modern city of Hangzhou was inhabited five thousand years ago by the Liangzhu culture, so named for the small town of Liangzhu not far to the northwest of Hangzhou where the ancient jade carving civilization was first discovered.[tpl]cite web|title= Migration of the Tribe and Integration into the Han Chinese|url= http://museum.shqp.gov.cn/gb/content/2009-02/23/content_237435.htm[/tpl]
Hangzhou first appears in written records as "Yuhang" ([tpl]zh|s=馀杭|t=餘杭|hp=|links=no[/tpl]; Old Chinese: *La-gang), and was incorporated into the Chinese empire in 220 BC as part of Kuaiji Commandery during the Qin dynasty. Traditional Chinese scholars interpreted "Yuhang" to mean "Yu's Ferry" (the similar-sounding [tpl]zh|c=禹航|hp=Yǔháng|links=no[/tpl]), after a legendary account of Yu the Great gathering ancient southern chieftains near the area for a grand meeting around 2000 BC. However, this is now known to be an incorrect folk etymology – Yuhang is almost certainly an ancient transliteration of an old Baiyue name.[tpl]lang|zh|Zhongguo lishi diming dacidian[/tpl] [tpl]lang|zh-hans-CN|中國歷史地名大詞典[/tpl], (Shanghai: Shanghai cishu chubanshe): 1516.
In AD 589, the city was renamed "Hangzhou" and a city wall was constructed two years later. It is listed as one of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China.  Hangzhou is at the southern end of China's Grand Canal which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 114: "… the Grand Canal, dug between 605 and 609 by means of enormous levies of conscripted labour."
It was the capital of the Wuyue Kingdom from 907 to 978 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period. Named Xifu at the time, it was one of the three great centers of culture in southern China during the tenth century, along with Nanjing and Chengdu.[tpl]Harvnb|Worthy|1983|p=19[/tpl]. Leaders of Wuyue were noted patrons of the arts, and especially of Buddhism and associated temple architecture and artwork. It also became a cosmopolitan center, drawing scholars from throughout China and conducting diplomacy not only with neighboring Chinese states, but also with Japan, Korea, and the Khitan Liao dynasty.
In the Tang dynasty, Bai Juyi was appointed governor of Hangzhou.Waley (1941), 131 Already an accomplished and famous poet, his deeds at Hangzhou have led to his being praised as a great governor. He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, and thus providing water for irrigation and so mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the beauty of West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He also ordered the construction of a causeway connecting Broken Bridge with Solitary Hill to allow walking on foot, instead of requiring the services of a boat. He then had willows and other trees along planted along the dyke, making it a beautiful landmark. Afterwards, this causeway was later named "Bai Causeway", in his honor.
In 1089, while another renowned poet Su Shi (Su Dongpo) was the city's governor, he used 200,000 workers to construct a [tpl]convert|2.8|km|abbr=on[/tpl] long causeway across the West Lake, which Qing Emperor Qianlong considered particularly attractive in the early morning of the spring time. The lake was once a lagoon tens of thousands of years ago. Silt then blocked the way to the sea and the lake was formed. A drill in the lake-bed in 1975 found the sediment of the sea, which confirmed its origin. Artificial preservation prevented the lake from evolving into a marshland. The Su Causeway built by Su Shi, and the Bai Causeway built by Bai Juyi, a Tang dynasty poet who was once the governor of Hangzhou, were both built out of mud dredged from the bottom of the lake. The lake is surrounded by hills on the northern and western sides. The Baochu Pagoda sits on the Baoshi Hill to the north of the lake.

====Foreign community====

Arab merchants lived in Hangzhou during the Song dynasty, due to the fact that the ocean going trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time. There were also Arabic inscriptions from the 1200s and 1300s. During the  later period of the Yuan dynasty, Muslims were persecuted through the banning of their traditions, and they participated in revolts against the Mongols. The Fenghuangshi mosque was constructed by an Egyptian trader who moved to Hangzhou.
Ibn Battuta is known to have visited the city of Hangzhou in the year 1345; he noted its charm and described how the city sat on a beautiful lake and was surrounded by gentle green hills.The  Enduring Message of Hangzhou During his stay at Hangzhou, he was particularly impressed by the large number of well-crafted and well-painted Chinese wooden ships with colored sails and silk awnings assembling in the canals. Later he attended a banquet held by Qurtai, the Yuan Mongol administrator of the city, who according to Ibn Battuta, was very fond of the skills of local Chinese conjurers.The Travels of Ibn Battuta Volume 4 pages 904 and 967 (The Hakluyt Society 1994, British Library)

===Southern Song===

Hangzhou was chosen as the new capital of the Southern Song dynasty in 1132,[tpl]cite journal|first=Weldon South|last=Coblin|title=Migration History and Dialect Development in the Lower Yangtze Watershed|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|year=2002|volume=65|issue=3|page=533[/tpl] when most of northern China had been conquered by the Jurchens in the Jin–Song wars.[tpl]cite book|first=Charles|last=Holcombe|title=A History of East Asia: From the Origins of Civilization to the Twenty-First Century|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-51595-5|page=129[/tpl] The Song court had retreated south to the city in 1129 from their original capital in Kaifeng, after it was captured by the Jurchens in the Jingkang Incident of 1127.[tpl]cite book|first=Frederick W.|last=Mote|title=Imperial China: 900–1800|year=2003|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=292–293|isbn=978-0-674-01212-7[/tpl][tpl]cite book|first=Herbert|last=Franke|editor=Denis C.

The government of the Song intended it to be a temporary capital. However, over the decades Hangzhou grew into a major commercial and cultural center of the Song dynasty. It rose from a middling city of no special importance to one of the world's largest and most prosperous. Once the prospect of retaking northern China had diminished, government buildings in Hangzhou were extended and renovated to better befit its status as an imperial capital and not just a temporary one. The imperial palace in Hangzhou, modest in size, was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways, and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls.[tpl]cite book|first=Jacques|last=Gernet|title=Daily Life in China, on the Eve of the Mongol Invasion, 1250-1276|year=1962|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-0720-6|page=25[/tpl]
It remained the capital from the early 12th century until the Mongol invasion of 1276, and was known as Lin'an ([tpl]lang|zh-han|臨安[/tpl]). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the civil service. During that time, the city was a sort of gravitational center of Chinese civilization: what used to be considered "central China" in the north was taken by the Jin, an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by Jurchens.
Numerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as Su Shi, Lu You, and Xin Qiji came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist Shen Kuo (1031–1095 AD), his tomb being located in the Yuhang district.Yuhang Cultural Network (October 2003). Shen Kuo's Tomb The Yuhang District of Hangzhou Cultural Broadcasting Press and Publications Bureau. Retrieved on 2007-05-06.
During the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th century ramparts. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian Jacques Gernet has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.[tpl]cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm |title=Largest Cities Through History |publisher=Geography.about.com |date=2011-03-02 |accessdate=2011-03-16[/tpl]Janet L. Abu-Lughod, Before European Hegemony: The World System A.D. 1250-1350, "All the Silks of China" (Oxford University Press US) 1991, p. 337
Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1132, 1137, 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275 while smaller fires occurred nearly every year. The 1237 fire alone was recorded to have destroyed 30,000 dwellings. To combat this threat, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fires.

===Yuan dynasty===

The city of Hangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing Mongol armies of Kublai Khan in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the empire.Gernet, 15. The capital of the new Yuan Dynasty was established in the city of Dadu (Beijing).The New Encyclopædia Britannica (Encyclopædia Britannica, Chicago University of, William Benton, Encyclopædia Britannica), p 2
The Venetian merchant Marco Polo supposedly visited Hangzhou in the late 13th century. In his book, he records that the city was "greater than any in the world".[tpl]cite book|first=Frederick W.|last=Mote|title=Imperial China: 900–1800|year=2003|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=461|isbn=978-0-674-01212-7[/tpl] He called the city Kinsay (or Kinsai) which simply means "capital" in Chinese (actually Polo used a Persianized version of the word). Although he exaggerated that the city was over one hundred miles in diameter and had 12,000 stone bridges, he still presented elegant prose about the country: "The number and wealth of the merchants, and the amount of goods that passed through their hands, was so enormous that no man could form a just estimate thereof."
The renowned 14th century Moroccan explorer Ibn Battuta said it was "the biggest city I have ever seen on the face of the earth."[tpl]Harvnb|Dunn|2005|p=260[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Elliott |first=Michael |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2084273_2084272_2084481,00.html |title=The Enduring Message of Hangzhou |publisher=Time.com |date=2011-07-21 |accessdate=2011-11-05[/tpl]

===Ming and after===

The city remained an important port until the middle of the Ming dynasty era, when its harbor slowly silted up.
In 1856 and 1860, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Hangzhou and caused heavy damage to the city.
Hangzhou was ruled by the Republic of China government under the Kuomintang from 1928 to 1949. On May 3, 1949, the People's Liberation Army entered Hangzhou and the city came under Communist control. After Deng Xiaoping's reformist policies began in 1978, Hangzhou took advantage of being situated in the Yangtze River Delta to bolster its development. It is now one of China's most prosperous major cities.

===Jewish community===

As late as the latter part of the 16th and early 17th centuries, the city was an important center of Chinese Jewry, and may have been the original home of the better-known Kaifeng Jewish community.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewish-holiday.com/kaifeng.html |title=The Lost Jews of Kaifeng |publisher=Jewish-holiday.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16[/tpl]
There was formerly a Jewish synagogue in Ningbo, as well as one in Hangzhou, but no traces of them are now discoverable, and the only Jews known to exist in China were in Kaifeng.

===Muslim communities during Ming and Qing dynasties===

In 1848, during the Qing dynasty, Hangzhou was described as the "stronghold" of Islam in China, the city containing several mosques with Arabic inscriptions.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=Pk0UAAAAYAAJ&q=islamism#v=onepage&q=stronghold%20islamism&f=false|title=The Middle kingdom: a survey of the ...

==Geography and climate==

Hangzhou is located in northwestern Zhejiang province, at the southern end of the Grand Canal of China, which runs to Beijing, in the south-central portion of the Yangtze River Delta. Its administrative area (sub-provincial city) extends west to the mountainous parts of Anhui province, and east to the coastal plain near Hangzhou Bay. The city center is built around the eastern and northern sides of the West Lake, just north of the Qiantang River.

Two of the Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism were from Hangzhou. In Hangzhou, there was persecution of Christians in the early 21st century.[tpl]cite news|last=Fan|first=Maureen|title=In China, Churches Challenge the Rules|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/30/AR2006093000494.html|newspaper=Washington Post|date=October 1, 2006[/tpl]

==Culture==

The native residents of Hangzhou, like those of Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, speak a Wu dialect. However, the Wu dialect varies throughout the area where it is spoken, hence, Hangzhou's dialect differs from regions in southern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu. As the official language defined by China's central government, Mandarin is the dominant spoken language.
Tea is an important part of Hangzhou's economy and culture. Hangzhou is best known for originating Longjing, a notable variety of green tea, the most notable type being Xi Hu Long Jing.[tpl]cite book|title=China, Volume 10|author=Cummings, Joe and Robert Storey|publisher=Lonely Planets Publications|year=1991|isbn=0-86442-123-0|page=345[/tpl] Known as the best type of Long Jing tea, Xi Hu Long Jing is grown near Xi Hu in Hangzhou, hence its name.[tpl]cite web|last=Hochstetter|first=Danielle|title=Hangzhou and its Tea|url=http://www.hangzhouteatours.com/HZandTea.html|accessdate=13 May 2012[/tpl]
The local government of Hangzhou heavily invests in promoting tourism and the arts, with emphasis placed upon silk production, umbrellas, and Chinese hand-held folding fans.
Hangzhou's local cuisine is often considered to be representative of Zhejiang provincial cuisine, which is claimed as one of China’s eight fundamental cuisines. The locally accepted consensus amongst Hangzhou's natives defines dishes prepared in this style to be "fresh, tender, soft, and smooth, with a mellow fragrance."
Dishes like West Lake Vinegar Fish ([tpl]lang|zh-hans-CN|西湖醋鱼[/tpl]), Dongpo Pork ([tpl]lang|zh-hans-CN|东坡肉[/tpl]), Longjing Shrimp ([tpl]lang|zh-hans-CN|龙井虾仁[/tpl]), Beggar's Chicken ([tpl]lang|zh-hans-CN|叫化鸡[/tpl]), Steamed Rice and Pork Wrapped by Lotus Leaves（[tpl]lang|zh-hans-CN|荷叶粉蒸肉[/tpl]）, Braised Bamboo Shoots ([tpl]lang|zh-hans-CN|油焖笋[/tpl]),Lotus Root Pudding ([tpl]lang|zh-hans-CN|藕粉[/tpl])and Sister Song's Fish Soup ([tpl]lang|zh-hans-CN|宋嫂鱼羹[/tpl]) are some of the better-known examples of Hangzhou's regional cuisine.

==Transportation==

Hangzhou is served by the Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, which provides direct service to many international destinations such as Germany, Thailand, Australia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, India, Vietnam, Ethiopia, Singapore, and the Netherlands.KLM launched its first flight to Hangzhou in China. Schiphol (2010-05-08). Retrieved on 2011-08-28. Regional routes reach Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. It has an extensive domestic route network within the PRC and is consistently ranked top 10 in passenger traffic among Chinese airports. Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport has two terminals, namely Terminal A and Terminal B. The smaller Terminal A serves all international and regional flights while the bigger Terminal B solely handles domestic traffic. The airport is located just outside the city in the Xiaoshan District with direct bus service linking the airport with Downtown Hangzhou. The ambitious expansion project will see the addition of a second runway and a third terminal which will dramatically increase capacity of the fast-growing airport that serves as a secondary hub of Air China. A new elevated airport express highway is under construction on top of the existing highway between the airport and downtown Hangzhou. The second phase of Hangzhou Metro Line 1 has a planned extension to the airport.
Hangzhou sits on the intersecting point of some of the busiest rail corridors in China. The city's main station is Hangzhou East Railway Station (colloquially "East Station" [tpl]lang|zh-hans|东站[/tpl]). It is one of the biggest rail traffic hubs in China consisting of 15 platforms that house the High Speed CRH service to and from Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Ningbo, and beyond. The subway station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1. There are frequent departures for Shanghai with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. While other CRH high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes. Most other major cities in China can also be reached by direct train service from Hangzhou. The Hangzhou Railway Station (colloquially the "City Station" [tpl]zh|c=城站|links=no[/tpl]) is closed for renovation since mid 2013. 
Direct trains link Hangzhou with more than 50 cities, including 12 daily services to Beijing, more than 100 daily services to Shanghai and it reaches as far as Ürümqi. The China Railway High-Speed service inaugurated on October 26, 2010. The service is operated by the CRH 380A(L), CRH 380B(L) and CRH380CL train sets which travel at a maximum speed of [tpl]convert|350|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], shortening the duration of the [tpl]convert|202|km|abbr=on[/tpl] trip to only 45 minutes.[tpl]cite web| url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-10/26/c_13575584.htm |author=xinhuanet|title=China unveils Shanghai-Hangzhou high-speed railway; eyes network extension  |date=2010-10-26 |accessdate=2010-10-26[/tpl]
The construction of the Shanghai–Hangzhou Maglev Train Line has been debated for several years. On August 18, 2008 Beijing Authorities gave the project the go-ahead to start construction in 2010. Transrapid has been contracted to construct the line. However, as of 2011 construction has not yet started.
Central, north, south and west long-distance bus stations offer frequent coach service to nearby cities/towns within Zhejiang province, as well as surrounding provinces.Personal observation, 2013-2014
Hangzhou has an efficient public transportation network, consisting of a modern fleet of regular diesel bus, trolley bus, hybrid diesel-electric bus and taxi. The first subway line entered into service in late 2012.
