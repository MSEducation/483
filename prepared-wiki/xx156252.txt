CATEGORIES: Fictional mammals

The Scroobious Pip is  a nonsense verse poem left unfinished by Edward Lear at the time of his death in 1888. It was completed by Ogden Nash and illustrated by Nancy Ekholm Burkert in 1968. The poem tells of a fanciful animal of unknown taxonomy known only as "the Scroobious Pip" and the fruitless attempts of the other animals of the world to classify it.
It is also the origin of the name of the UK hip hop artist Scroobius Pip, one half of dan le sac vs Scroobius Pip.http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/dan-le-sac-vs-scroobius-pip
