Clark Middle School is a middle school located in the north portion of Laredo, Texas, United States, and is a part of United Independent School District.  Enrollment at Clark Middle school is estimated to be about 820 students.  Unlike the other middle schools in the United Independent School District, Clark Middle School is lan
dlocked on all sides and is not expected to gain as many students in the foreseeable future.

==History==

Clark Middle school opened in 1978-79 school year in which United Independent School was a few years old.  At first Clark Middle served 4-6 grades. For the 1995-96 school year, the school switched to a 6-8 grade campus and its colors were changed to blue and gold (yellow) to show that Clark Middle now feeds its students into John B. Alexander High School.

==Standardized dress==

Starting in the 2007-2008 school year, students are required to follow standardized dress code provided by the district which states students must wear khaki pants and a navy blue or gold colored shirt. 2
The Texas Education Agency specified that the parents and/or guardians of students zoned to a school with uniforms may apply for a waiver to opt out of the uniform policy so their children do not have to wear the uniform 1; parents must specify "bona fide" reasons, such as religious reasons or philosophical objections

==Clark Middle School Band program==

The program consists of four bands (in descending order ): 3 Performing bands (Honor, Symphonic, and Concert) and Beginner band. The band is under the direction of Gilbert Cuellar and Symphonic Band director, Monica Michelle Espinoza. They are helped by the Alexander High School band directors, Carlos Gil (percussion consultant), and Ben Chasen (UIL consultant). The Honor Band holds 65 straight UIL Sweepstakes and the Symphonic Band holds 21. This band also participates in the American Classics in San Antonio, TX. This 2012, The Clark Middle School Band was the top Band that got more medals in the Solo-Ensemble Competition.

==CMS Mariachi Del Norte==

Recently, the Clark Middle Band program has started a Mariachi Band appropriately named the "CMS MARIACHI DEL NORTE". The Mariachi is under the direction of Carlos Gil. New uniforms were purchased with the help of UISD President, Pat Campos. The CMS Mariachi features Cornets, Guitarones, Armonias, Flutes, Marimba, Piano and of course, Singers.
