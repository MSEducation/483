He was Jewish, and was deported to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp during Nazi rule. After the war he chose to remain in his native country and went on to study medicine. He also worked as a reporter for RIAS, before he became one of the first students at the Free University of Berlin.
His father-in-law was CDU politician Ernst Lemmer.
The Gerhard Löwenthal Prize, annually awarded by his widow Ingeborg Löwenthal, the conservative  newspaper Junge Freiheit and the Foundation for Conservative Education and Research, is named in his honour.
