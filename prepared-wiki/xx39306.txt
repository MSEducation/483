The Cult Awareness Network (CAN) was an organization created by deprogrammer Ted Patrick that provided information on groups that it considered to be cults, as well as support and referrals to deprogrammers.[tpl]cite news  | last =Staff |   title =From the Editor | work = New CAN: Cult Awareness Network | pages = Volume I, Issue 2|   year =2001 | url = http://www.cultawarenessnetwork.org/update/001.002.html | accessdate =  2007-10-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928161608/http://www.cultawarenessnetwork.org/update/001.002.html  |archivedate = 2007-09-28[/tpl][tpl]cite news | last =Goodman | first =Leisa, Human Rights Director, Church of Scientology International |  title =A Letter from the Church of Scientology | work =Marburg Journal of Religion: Responses From Religions | pages =Volume 6, No. 2, 4 pages |   year =2001 | url =http://web.uni-marburg.de/religionswissenschaft/journal/mjr/goodman.html | accessdate = 2007-10-28 [/tpl]Lucas, P.C. and T.

It was founded in the wake of the November 18, 1978 deaths of members of the group Peoples Temple and assassination of Congressman Leo J. Ryan in Jonestown, Guyana, and was shut down in 1996, though its name and assets were bought and used by the Scientology organization in bankruptcy proceedings[tpl]cite web | first = Laurie | last = Goodstein | title = It's A Hostile Takeover Of A Nonprofit | url = http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=2362655&date=19961201 | work = Washington Post | publisher = Seattle Times | date = 1996-12-01 | accessdate = 2008-05-10 [/tpl] who used the name as the title of the unrelated organization, New Cult Awareness Network.
CAN and its representatives were known for being highly critical of Scientology, Landmark Education, and other groups and new religious movements, referring to some of these groups as "destructive cults".

==History==

Ted Patrick founded the FREECOG organization, later known as the Citizen's Freedom Foundation, in 1971[tpl]cite book|title=Exploring New Religions|last=Chryssides|first=George|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=0-8264-5959-5|pages=346â€“348[/tpl] before becoming the Cult Awareness Network.Chryssides, G.D. and B.E.

Cynthia Kisser, the then executive director of CAN, was quoted in the controversial 1991 TIME article, "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power".  These comments and other forms of criticism from CAN garnered the attention of the Church of Scientology and Landmark Education, and both separately began litigation proceedings against the organization.
CAN was driven into bankruptcy when a court found CAN guilty of having conspired to violate the civil rights and religious liberties of Jason Scott, a Pentecostalist, who had been forcibly kidnapped and subjected to a failed "deprogramming" by Rick Ross, a CAN-referred deprogrammer. The court ordered CAN to pay a judgement of US$1 million.  The large award was intended to deter similar conduct in the future; the court noted that the defendants were unable to appreciate the maliciousness of their conduct towards the deprogrammee, and portrayed themselves, throughout the entire process of litigation, as victims of the alleged agenda of the opposing counsel, Church of Scientology attorney Kendrick Moxon. Subsequently, the organization was bought out in bankruptcy court by Church of Scientology attorney Steven Hayes in 1996. As a result of a legal settlement with Landmark Education, CAN agreed not to sell copies of Outrageous Betrayal, a book critical of Werner Erhard, for five years after it emerged from bankruptcy proceedings. Following its bankruptcy, the files of the "Old CAN" were made available to scholars for study and transferred to a university library.[ref]
