===Trivia contest===

At the end of every semester but one since 1966, WCFM has hosted an all-night, eight-hour trivia contest. Teams of students, alumni, professors, friends, and others compete to answer questions on a variety of subjects, while simultaneously identifying songs and performing designated tasks. The winning team's only prize is the obligation to create and host the following semester's contest.[ref]

The precise date of the debut contest is uncertain. Most spring contests occur in early May, but during its first decade, Williams Trivia was sometimes held in March or February. Assuming a May date, Lawrence University's 50-hour-long Great Midwest Trivia Contest, first held on April 29, 1966, would be the oldest continuous competition of its sort in the United States, but if the first Williams contest was held earlier, it would be the oldest.  The distinction is appropriately trivial.[ref]

While other college-based trivia contests in the United States emphasize marathon endurance and revel in the obscurity of their arcana, the aim of the Williams contest is to cram as much evocative and entertaining material into as concentrated a space as possible. Lasting just eight hours, a typical Williams Trivia contest will demand between 900 and 1,200 separate "bits" of trivial information, delivering twice as much content as its "competitors" in a fraction of the time. No discernible rivalry exists between any of the various contests. The contest has occasionally received outside media coverage, including in the Sunday New York Times.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/06/weekinreview/word-for-word-trivia-marathon-pulling-all-nighter-this-college-means-acting.html?scp=1&sq=WCFM%20%20Trivia&st=cse |title=Word for Word/Trivia Marathon; Pulling an All-Nighter at This College Means Acting Out 'Nietzsche in Love' |author=Thomas Vinciguerra |work=New York Times |date=June 6, 1999 |accessdate=January 10, 2012[/tpl]

===Student music===

Music ensembles at Williams include Berkshire Symphony, Wind Ensemble, Student Symphony, Brass Ensemble, Clarinet Choir, Concert and Chamber Choirs, Handbell Choir, Gospel Choir, Jazz Ensemble, Kusika and the Zambezi Marimba Band, Percussion Ensemble, and Marching Band.Music at Williams | Williams College Department of Music. Music.williams.edu. Retrieved on 2013-08-02. Both music majors and non-majors are welcome to participate in all groups.
The Berkshire Symphony is conducted by Ronald Feldman, a former Boston Symphony Orchestra cellist.  Half of the orchestra consists of students, while the principal players and many section players are area professionals.
The Williams College Wind Ensemble, directed by Heidi Miller, presents artistic programs blending traditional and contemporary wind band music.  In recent years, the group has evolved to include strings and premieres and performs works by prominent contemporary composers, including members of the faculty.
Student Symphony is an entirely student-run, student-conducted group.  Student Symphony rehearses weekly and performs once per semester.
Under the direction of Bradley Wells, the Concert and Chamber Choirs perform a wide range of repertoire at a variety of concerts.  A choral highlight is always the Festival of Lessons and Carols held just prior to the holidays in the Thompson Memorial Chapel.
The Williams Jazz program includes academic courses, ensembles (both traditional big band, by audition, and several small ensembles), and applied lessons on primary jazz instruments.
In the Shona language of Zimbabwe, Kusika means "to create."  Founded in 1989 by Professor Ernest D. Brown at Williams College, Kusika performs traditional African music, dance, and storytelling from Ghana, Zimbabwe, and Senegal.  The Zambezi Marimba Band, founded in 1992 by Professor Brown, was the first African marimba band to be established in the Eastern United States. The ensemble plays marimba music from Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, and from the African diaspora around the world.
Sankofa, called "Kofa" for short, is the Williams College Step Team. It is the most popular performing group on campus. It is a co-ed, student-run dance company. Sankofa choreographs original material that incorporates popular song, drums, hip-hop, break dance, spoken word, poetry, and sheer creative ingenuity. Stepping features precise, synchronized, and complex rhythmic body movements, combined with singing, chanting, and verbal play. The word “sankofa,” from the Akan people in Ghana, loosely translates to “reaching back in order to move forward.” Sankofa was formed in the fall of the ‘96-’97 school year by five women from the class of 2000: Dahra Jackson, Maxine Lyle, Mya Fisher, Melina Evans and Samantha Reed. In 2005, Lyle founded Soul Steps, a professional step company.Williams Dance. 62center.williams.edu. Retrieved on 2013-08-02.
Williams' coed hip hop dance group "Nuttin' But Cuties", usually shortened to NBC, is one of the more prominent groups on campus with well-attended shows in the fall and spring semesters.
The Williams Percussion Ensemble, led by Matthew Gold, explores the masterworks of twentieth century percussion music, experimental music, music of many of the world's traditions, and the most up-to-date works by contemporary composers for percussion instruments.
The Marching Band, named "The Moocho Macho Moocow Military Marching Band", serves as a cheering section at the football games, as well as an entertainment show for halftime.
Williams also hosts eight student-organized a cappella singing groups.  There are two all-female groups, the Accidentals and Ephoria.  The two all-male groups are Octet and the Springstreeters, and the two co-ed groups are Ephlats and Good Question.  The seventh group, the Elizabethans, are a mixed-voice Renaissance ensemble. Another recently formed a cappella group is the Aristocows, sings only Disney songs. The newest a cappella group is called the Far Ephs Movement and specialize in Asian songs.
The Williams Gospel Choir has served the college since 1986. Their performances are usually at the end of the semester, right before finals start, and serve to provide a spiritual and emotional courage to students during this difficult time of the semester.
