The Quebec general election of 1890 was held on June 17, 1890 to elect members of the 7th Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada.  The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party Parti national coalition led by Honor√© Mercier, was re-elected, defeating the Quebec Conservative Party, led by Louis-Olivier Taillon.
A scandal and charges of corruption cut short Mercier's term of office.  He was later cleared of all charges, but his political career was ended.
