The Venona project was a counter-intelligence program initiated by the United States Army Signal Intelligence Service (a forerunner of the National Security Agency) that lasted from 1943 to 1980. The program attempted to decrypt messages sent by Soviet Union intelligence agencies, including its foreign intelligence service and military intelligence services.Benson 2001, p. 5 During the program's four decades, approximately 3,000 messages were at least partially decrypted and translated.Benson 2001, p. 7  The project produced some of the most important breakthroughs for western counter-intelligence in this period, including the discovery of the Cambridge spy ringBenson 2001, p. 34 and the exposure of Soviet espionage targeting the Manhattan Project.Benson 2001, pp. 20–22. Benson gives a basic list of the relevant messages; other accounts include Haynes and Klehr, p. 304, and West, p. 197. The project was one of the most sensitive secrets of United States intelligence.  It remained secret for over a decade after it ended and was not officially declassified until 1995.

==Background==

During the initial years of the Cold War, the Venona project was a source of information on Soviet intelligence-gathering activity that was directed at the Western military powers. Although unknown to the public, and even to Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, these programs were of importance concerning crucial events of the early Cold War. These included the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg spying case and the defections of Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess to the Soviet Union.
Most decipherable messages were transmitted and intercepted between 1942 and 1945. Sometime in 1945, the existence of the Venona program was revealed to the Soviet Union by the NKVD agent and United States Army SIGINT analyst and cryptologist Bill Weisband. These messages were slowly and gradually decrypted beginning in 1946 and continuing (many times at a low-level of effort in the latter years) through 1980, when the Venona program was terminated, and the remaining amount of effort that was being spent on it was moved to more important projects.
To what extent the various individuals were involved with Soviet intelligence is a topic of dispute. While a number of academics and historians assert that most of the individuals mentioned in the Venona decrypts were most likely either clandestine assets and/or contacts of Soviet intelligence agents,"How VENONA was Declassified", Robert L. Benson, Symposium of Cryptologic History; October 27, 2005."Tangled Treason", Sam Tanenhaus, The New Republic, 1999. others argue that many of those people probably had no malicious intentions and committed no crimes.Tales from decrypts.

===Commencement===

The Venona Project was initiated in 1943, under orders from the deputy Chief of Military Intelligence (G-2), Carter W. Clarke.Benson 2001 Clarke distrusted Joseph Stalin, and feared that the Soviet Union would sign a separate peace with the Third Reich, allowing Germany to focus its military forces against Great Britain and the United States.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/haynes-venona.html |title=Haynes & Klehr New York Times 1999 |publisher=Nytimes.com |accessdate=2014-02-15[/tpl] Code-breakers of the US Army's Signal Intelligence Service (commonly called Arlington Hall) analyzed encrypted high-level Soviet diplomatic intelligence messages intercepted in large volumes during and immediately after World War II by American, British, and Australian listening posts.Yuri Modin, My Five Cambridge Friends, 1994, Ballantine Books, ISBN 0-374-21698-3, p. 194

==Decryption==

This message traffic, which was encrypted with a one-time pad system, was stored and analyzed in relative secrecy by hundreds of cryptanalysts over a 40-year period starting in the early 1940s. Due to a serious blunder on the part of the Soviets, some of this traffic was vulnerable to cryptanalysis. The Soviet company that manufactured the one-time pads produced around 35,000 pages of duplicate key numbers, as a result of pressures brought about by the German advance on Moscow during World War II. The duplication - which undermines a security of a one-time system - was discovered and attempts to lessen its impact were made by sending the duplicates to widely-separated usersNSA Overview on Venona released 2009 Despite this, the reuse was detected by cryptologists in the US.

===Breakthrough===

The Soviet systems in general used a code to convert words and letters into numbers, to which additive keys (from one-time pads) were added, encrypting the content. When used correctly, one-time pad encryption is unbreakable.http://world.std.com/~franl/crypto/one-time-pad.html[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] Cryptanalysis by American and British code-breakers revealed that some of the one-time pad material had incorrectly been reused by the Soviets (specifically, entire pages, although not complete books), which allowed decryption (sometimes only partial) of a small part of the traffic.
Generating the one-time pads is a slow and labor-intensive process, and the outbreak of war with Germany in June 1941 caused a sudden increase in the need for coded messages. It is probable that the Soviet code generators started duplicating cipher pages in order to keep up with demand.
It was Arlington Hall's Lieutenant Richard Hallock, working on Soviet "Trade" traffic (so called because these messages dealt with Soviet trade issues), who first discovered that the Soviets were reusing pages. Hallock and his colleagues (including Genevieve Feinstein, Cecil Phillips, Frank Lewis, Frank Wanat, and Lucille Campbell) went on to break into a significant amount of Trade traffic, recovering many one-time pad additive key tables in the process.
A young Meredith Gardner then used this material to break into what turned out to be NKVD (and later GRU) traffic by reconstructing the code used to convert text to numbers. Samuel Chew and Cecil Phillips also made valuable contributions. On 20 December 1946, Gardner made the first break into the code, revealing the existence of Soviet espionage in the Manhattan Project.
Venona messages also indicated that Soviet spies worked in Washington in the State Department, Treasury, Office of Strategic Services, and even the White House. Very slowly, using assorted techniques ranging from traffic analysis to defector information, more of the messages were decrypted.
Claims have been made that information from the physical recovery of code books (a partially burned one was obtained by the Finns) to bugging embassy rooms in which text was entered into encrypting devices (analyzing the keystrokes by listening to them being punched in) contributed to recovering much of the plaintext. These latter claims are less than fully supported in the open literature.
One significant aid (mentioned by the NSA) in the early stages may have been work done in cooperation between the Japanese and Finnish cryptanalysis organizations; when the Americans broke into Japanese codes during World War II, they gained access to this information. There are also reports that copies of signals purloined from Soviet offices by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were helpful in the cryptanalysis. The Finnish radio intelligence sold much of its material concerning Soviet codes to OSS in 1944 during Operation Stella Polaris, including the partially burned code book.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]

===Results===

NSA reported, according to the serial numbers of the Venona cables, thousands were sent, but only a fraction were available to the cryptanalysts. Approximately 2,200 messages were decrypted and translated; about half for the 1943 GRU-Naval Washington to Moscow messages were broken, but none for any other year, although several thousand were sent between 1941 and 1945. The decryption rate of the NKVD cables was as follows:
Out of some hundreds of thousands of intercepted encrypted texts, it is claimed under 3,000 have been partially or wholly decrypted. All the duplicate one-time pad pages were produced in 1942, and almost all of them had been used by the end of 1945, with a few being used as late as 1948. After this, Soviet message traffic reverted to being completely unreadable.
The existence of Venona decryption became known to the Soviets within a few years of the first breaks.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] It is not clear whether the Soviets knew how much of the message traffic or which messages had been successfully decrypted. At least one Soviet penetration agent, British Secret Intelligence Service representative to the U.S., Kim Philby, was told about the project in 1949, as part of his job as liaison between British and U.S. intelligence. Since all of the duplicate one-time pad pages had been used by this time, the Soviets apparently did not make any changes to their cryptographic procedures after they learned of Venona. However, this information allowed them to alert those of their agents who might be at risk of exposure due to the decryption.

===Significance===

The decrypted messages gave important insights into Soviet behavior in the period during which duplicate one-time pads were used. With the first break into the code, Venona revealed the existence of Soviet espionage[ref]

 "these intercepts provided... descriptions of the activities of precisely the same Soviet spies who were named by defecting Soviet agents Alexander Orlov, Walter Krivitsky, Whittaker Chambers, and Elizabeth Bentley."[/ref]
at Los Alamos National Laboratories.[ref]

 "Thanks to successful espionage, the Russians tested their first atom bomb in August 1949, just four years after the first American test. As will be discussed, we had learned of the Los Alamos spies in December 1946—December 20, to be precise. The US Army Security Agency, in the person of Meredith Knox Gardner, a genius in his own right, had broken one of what it termed the Venona messages—the transmissions that Soviet agents in the United States sent to and received from Moscow."[/ref]
Identities soon emerged of American, Canadian, Australian, and British spies in service to the Soviet government, including Klaus Fuchs, Alan Nunn May, and Donald Maclean. Others worked in Washington in the State Department, the Treasury, Office of Strategic Services,[ref]

 "KGB cables indicated that the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in World War II had been thoroughly infiltrated with Soviet agents."[/ref]
and even the White House.
The decrypts show the U.S. and other nations were targeted in major espionage campaigns by the Soviet Union as early as 1942. Among those identified are Julius and Ethel Rosenberg; Alger Hiss; Harry Dexter White, the second-highest official in the Treasury Department; Lauchlin Currie,[ref]

 "Currie, known as PAZh (Page) and White, whose cover names were YuRIST (Jurist) and changed later to LAJER (Lawyer), had been Soviet agents since the 1930s. They had been identified as Soviet agents in Venona translations and by other agents turned witnesses or informants for the FBI and Justice Department. From the Venona translations, both were known to pass intelligence to their handlers, notably the Silvermaster network."[/ref]
a personal aide to Franklin Roosevelt; and Maurice Halperin,[ref]

a section head in the Office of Strategic Services.
The identification of individuals mentioned in Venona transcripts is sometimes problematic, since people with a "covert relationship" with Soviet intelligence are referenced by cryptonyms.
Further complicating matters is the fact the same person sometimes had different cryptonyms at different times, and the same cryptonym was sometimes reused for different individuals. In some cases, notably Hiss, the matching of a Venona cryptonym to an individual is disputed. In many other cases, a Venona cryptonym has not yet been linked to any person. According to authors John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, the Venona transcripts identify approximately 349 Americans whom they claim had a covert relationship with Soviet intelligence, though fewer than half of these have been matched to real-name identities. However, not every agent may have been communicating directly with Soviet intelligence.  Each of those 349 persons may have had many others working for, and reporting only to, them.
The Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor to the CIA, housed at one time or another between fifteen and twenty Soviet spies.[ref]

[tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl][/ref]
Duncan Lee, Donald Wheeler, Jane Foster Zlatowski, and Maurice Halperin passed information to Moscow. The War Production Board, the Board of Economic Warfare, the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and the Office of War Information, included at least half a dozen Soviet sources each among their employees. In the opinion of some, almost every American military and diplomatic agency of any importance was compromised to some extent by Soviet espionage.
Some scholars and journalists dispute the claims by Haynes, Klehr, and others concerning the precision of the matching of cryptonyms to actual persons.[tpl]cite web| title=Joseph McCarthy: Reexamining the Life and Legacy of America's Most Hated Senator| url=http://www.johnearlhaynes.org/page58.html |work=Venona Exchange| publisher=Haynes| accessdate=4 July 2013| author=Haynes, John Earl| coauthors=Herman, Arthur| location=Washington| format=Speech|date=February 2000[/tpl] Also contested is the implication that all 349 persons identified had an intentional "covert relationship" with Soviet intelligence; it is argued, in some cases, the individual may have been an unwitting information source or a prospect for future recruitment by Soviet intelligence.

==Bearing of Venona on particular cases==

Venona has added information—some unequivocal, some ambiguous—to several espionage cases. Some known spies, including Theodore Hall, were neither prosecuted nor publicly implicated, because the Venona evidence against them was not made public.
The identity of Soviet source cryptonymed '19' remains unclear. According to British writer Nigel West, '19' was president of Czechoslovak government-in-exile Edvard Beneš.Nigel West, Venona, największa tajemnica zimnej wojny, Warszawa 2006, p.138. Military historian Eduard Mark[ref]
Eduard Mark. "Venona's Source 19 and the Trident Conference of May 1943: Diplomacy or Espionage?". Intelligence and National Security. London, Summer 1998, pp. 1–31[/ref] and American authors Herbert Romerstein and Eric Breindel concluded it was Roosevelt's aide Harry Hopkins. According to American authors John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, source code-named '19' could be someone from the British delegation to the Washington Conference in May 1943. Moreover, they argue no evidence of Hopkins as an agent has been found in other archives, and the partial message relating to "19" does not indicate if this source was a spy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&list=h-diplo&month=9907&week=b&msg=sObK4G6XORytI4LXBpW2xw&user=&pw= |title=H-Net Discussion Networks - VENONA, the KGB, and Harry Hopkins Haynes/Klehr |publisher=H-net.msu.edu |date=1999-07-14 |accessdate=2014-02-15[/tpl]
However, Vasily Mitrokhin was a KGB archivist who defected from the Soviet Union with copies of KGB files. He claimed Harry Hopkins was a secret Russian agent."The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB," by Vasily Mitrokhin and Christopher Andrew. Moreover, Oleg Gordievsky, a high-level KGB officer who also defected from the Soviet Union, reported that Iskhak Ahkmerov, the KGB officer who controlled the clandestine Soviet agents in the U.S. during the war, had said Hopkins was “the most important of all Soviet wartime agents in the United States.”"KGB: The Inside Story of Its Foreign Operations from Lenin to Gorbachev," by Oleg Gordievsky and Christopher Andrew. In addition, Major George Racey Jordon stated he strongly suspected Hopkins was a spy based on activities he observed in his support role in the project known as "Lend-Lease."From Major Jordan's Diaries by George Racey Jordon and Richard L. Stokes.

===Julius and Ethel Rosenberg===

Venona has added significant information to the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, making it clear Julius was guilty of espionage, but also showing that Ethel was probably no more than an accomplice, if that.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] Venona and other recent information has shown, while the content of Julius' atomic espionage was not as vital as alleged at the time of his espionage activities, in other fields it was extensive. The information Rosenberg passed to the Soviets concerned the proximity fuze, design and production information on the Lockheed P-80 jet fighter, and thousands of classified reports from Emerson Radio. The Venona evidence indicates unidentified sources code-named "Quantum" and "Pers" who facilitated transfer of nuclear weapons technology to the Soviet Union from positions within the Manhattan Project. According to Alexander Vassiliev's notes from KGB archive, "Quantum" was Boris Podolsky and "Pers" was Russell W. McNutt, an engineer from the uranium processing plant in Oak Ridge.Vassiliev-Notebooks-and-Venona-Index-Concordance.pdf, ed. 2013, pp: 325, 343

===Klaus Fuchs===

Venona is also responsible for the exposure of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs. The Venona documents released in 1950 disclose information about the clandestine activities of Klaus Fuchs under his code names of CHARLES and REST. During his time on the Manhattan Project, the NSA learned of this relations with the KGB. http://www.nsa.gov/about/_files/cryptologic_heritage/publications/coldwar/venona_story.pdf, NSA: Venona Monographs,  pp: 8,14, 18-20 On April 10, 1945, the Moscow office sent a message to New York concerning Fuchs' contribution to the Soviet atomic bomb development. This letter stated that Fuchs “is of great value,” and his reports “contain information received for the first time about the electromagnetic method of separation of the atomic bomb.” http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/venona/1945/10apr_atomic_bomb_info.pdf, NSA, ed. 2013, pp: 325, 343

===Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White===

According to the Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy, the complicity of both Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White is conclusively proven by Venona,[ref]

[tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] "The complicity of Alger Hiss of the State Department seems settled. As does that of Harry Dexter White of the Treasury Department."</ref><ref>

[/ref] stating "The complicity of Alger Hiss of the State Department seems settled. As does that of Harry Dexter White of the Treasury Department."
In his 1998 book, Senator Moynihan expresses certainty about Hiss's identification by Venona as a Soviet spy, writing "Hiss was indeed a Soviet agent and appears to have been regarded by Moscow as its most important."
Several current authors, researchers, and archivists consider the Venona evidence on Hiss to be inconclusive[ref]
