The Bengal tiger  (Panthera tigris tigris) is the most numerous tiger subspecies. Its populations have been estimated at 1,706–1,909 in India, 440 in Bangladesh, 163–253 in Nepal and 67–81 in Bhutan.Jhala, Y. V., Qureshi, Q., Sinha, P. R. (Eds.) (2011).

Since 2010, it has been classified as endangered by the IUCN. The total population is estimated at fewer than 2,500 individuals with a decreasing trend, and none of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within the Bengal tiger's range is large enough to support an effective population size of 250 adult individuals.[tpl]IUCN |assessors=Chundawat, R.

Bengal is traditionally fixed as the typical locality for the binomial Panthera tigris, to which the British taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the Bengal tiger in 1929 under the trinomial Panthera tigris tigris.[tpl]cite journal|author=Pocock, R.

==Characteristics==

The Bengal tiger's coat is yellow to light orange, with stripes ranging from dark brown to black; the belly and the interior parts of the limbs are white, and the tail is orange with black rings.
Male Bengal tigers have an average total length of [tpl]convert|270|to|310|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] including the tail, while females measure [tpl]convert|240|to|265|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] on average.[tpl]cite journal|author=Mazák, V|year=1981|url=http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-152-01-0001.pdf |title=Panthera tigris|journal= Mammalian Species |volume=152|pages= 1–8|doi=10.2307/3504004|issue=152[/tpl] The tail is typically [tpl]convert|85|to|110|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] long, and on average, tigers are [tpl]convert|90|to|110|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in height at the shoulders.[tpl]cite journal|author=Karanth, K.

The white tiger is a recessive mutant of the Bengal tiger, which is reported in the wild from time to time in Assam, Bengal, Bihar and especially from the former State of Rewa. However, it is not to be mistaken as an occurrence of albinism. In fact, there is only one fully authenticated case of a true albino tiger, and none of black tigers, with the possible exception of one dead specimen examined in Chittagong in 1846.McDougal, C. (1977). The Face of the Tiger. Rivington Books and André Deutsch, London.

===Records===

Two tigers shot in Kumaon and near Oude at the end of the 19th century allegedly measured more than [tpl]convert|12|ft|cm|abbr=on[/tpl]. But at the time, sportsmen had not yet adopted a standard system of measurement; some would measure between pegs while others would round the curves.Sterndale, R. A. (1884) Felis Tigris. No. 201 in: Natural History of the Mammalia of India and Ceylon. Thacker, Spink and Co., Calcutta.
In the beginning of the 20th century, a male Bengal tiger was shot in central India with a head and body length of [tpl]convert|221|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] between pegs, a chest girth of [tpl]convert|150|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], a shoulder height of [tpl]convert|109|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] and a tail length of [tpl]convert|81|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], which was perhaps bitten off by a rival male. This specimen could not be weighed, but it was calculated to weigh no less than [tpl]convert|272|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].Brander, A. (1923) Wild Animals in Central India. Edwin Arnold & Co., London.
A heavy male weighing [tpl]convert|570|lb|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] was shot in northern India in the 1930s.Hewett, J. P., Hewett Atkinson, L. (1938). Jungle trails in northern India: reminiscences of hunting in India. Metheun and company limited, London. However, the heaviest known tiger was a huge male killed in 1967 that weighed [tpl]convert|388.7|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] and measured [tpl]convert|322|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in total length between pegs, and [tpl]convert|338|cm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] over curves. This specimen is on exhibition in the Mammals Hall of the Smithsonian Institution.Wood, G. 1983. The Guinness book of animal facts and feats. Sterling Pub. Co. Inc., 3rd ed., ISBN 978-0-85112-235-9 In 1980 and 1984, scientists captured and tagged two male tigers in Chitwan National Park that weighed more than [tpl]convert|270|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].Dinerstein, E.

===Genetic ancestry===

Bengal tigers are defined by three distinct mitochondrial nucleotide sites and 12 unique microsatellite alleles. The pattern of genetic variation in the Bengal tiger corresponds to the premise that they arrived in India approximately 12,000 years ago.[tpl]cite journal|author=Kitchener, A.C., Dugmore, A. J. |year=2000|title=Biogeographical change in the tiger, Panthera tigris|journal= Animal Conservation |volume=3|pages= 113–124|doi=10.1111/j.1469-1795.2000.tb00236.x|issue=2[/tpl] This is consistent with the lack of tiger fossils from the Indian subcontinent prior to the late Pleistocene and the absence of tigers from Sri Lanka, which was separated from the subcontinent by rising sea levels in the early Holocene.[tpl]cite journal|author=Luo, S. J. et al.|year=2004|title=Phylogeography and Genetic Ancestry of Tigers (Panthera tigris)|journal=PLoS Biology |volume=2 |issue=12|pages= e442|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020442|pmid=15583716|pmc=534810[/tpl]

==Distribution and habitat==

In 1982, a sub-fossil right middle phalanx was found in a prehistoric midden near Kuruwita in Sri Lanka, which is dated to about 16,500 ybp and tentatively considered to be of a tiger. Tigers appear to have arrived in Sri Lanka during a pluvial period during which sea levels were depressed, evidently prior to the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago.[tpl]cite journal|author=Manamendra-Arachchi, K., Pethiyagoda, R., Dissanayake, R., Meegaskumbura, M. |year=2005|url=http://rmbr.nus.edu.sg/rbz/biblio/s12/s12rbz423-434.pdf |title=A Second Extinct Big Cat From The Late Quaternary of Sri Lanka|journal= The Raffles Bulletin of Zoology |volume=2005|issue= Supplement No. 12|pages= 423–434[/tpl] In 1929, the British taxonomist Pocock assumed that tigers arrived in southern India too late to colonize Sri Lanka, which earlier had been connected to India by a land bridge.
In the Indian subcontinent, tigers inhabit tropical moist evergreen forests, tropical dry forests, tropical and subtropical moist deciduous forests, mangroves, subtropical and temperate upland forests, and alluvial grasslands. Latter tiger habitat once covered a huge swath of grassland and riverine and moist semi-deciduous forests along the major river system of the Gangetic and Brahmaputra plains, but has now been largely converted to agriculture or severely degraded. Today, the best examples of this habitat type are limited to a few blocks at the base of the outer foothills of the Himalayas including the Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs) Rajaji-Corbett, Bardia-Banke, and the transboundary TCUs Chitwan-Parsa-Valmiki, Dudhwa-Kailali and Sukla Phanta-Kishanpur. Tiger densities in these blocks are high, in part a response to the extraordinary biomass of ungulate prey.Wikramanayake, E.D., Dinerstein, E., Robinson, J.G., Karanth, K.U., Rabinowitz, A., Olson, D., Mathew, T., Hedao, P., Connor, M., Hemley, G., Bolze, D. (1999) Where can tigers live in the future? A framework for identifying high-priority areas for the conservation of tigers in the wild, pp. 255–272 in: Seidensticker, J., Christie, S., Jackson, P. (eds.) Riding the Tiger. Tiger Conservation in human-dominated landscapes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. hardback ISBN 0-521-64057-1, paperback ISBN 0-521-64835-1.

===India===

In the past, Indian censuses of wild tigers relied on the individual identification of footprints known as pug marks — a method that has been criticised as deficient and inaccurate, though now camera traps are being used in many places.Karanth, K. U., Nichols, J. D., Seidensticker, J.,  Dinerstein, E., Smith, J. L. D., McDougal, C., Johnsingh, A. J. T., Chundawat, R. S., Thapar, V. (2003). Science deficiency in conservation practice: the monitoring of tiger populations in India. Animal Conservation (2003) 6: 141–146.
Good tiger habitats in subtropical and temperate upland forests include the Tiger Conservation Units (TCUs) Manas-Namdapha. TCUs in tropical dry forest include Hazaribagh National Park, Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve, Kanha-Indravati corridor, Orissa dry forests, Panna National Park, Melghat Tiger Reserve and Ratapani Tiger Reserve. The TCUs in tropical moist deciduous forest are probably some of the most productive habitats for tigers and their prey, and include Kaziranga-Meghalaya, Kanha-Pench, Simlipal and Indravati Tiger Reserves. The TCUs in tropical moist evergreen forests represent the less common tiger habitats, being largely limited to the upland areas and wetter parts of the Western Ghats, and include the Tiger Reserves of Periyar, Kalakad-Mundathurai, Bandipur and Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary.
The methodology used during the tiger census of 2008 extrapolates site-specific densities of tigers, their co-predators and prey derived from camera trap and sign surveys using GIS. Based on the result of these surveys, the total tiger population has been estimated at 1,411 individuals ranging from 1,165 to 1,657 adult and sub-adult tigers of more than 1.5 years of age. The following six landscape complexes comprising several ecological landscapes were surveyed across India based on current tiger occupancy and potential for connectivity:[tpl]citation |title=Status of the Tigers, Co-predators, and Prey in India |author=Jhala, Y.

In May 2008, forest officials spotted 14 tiger cubs in Rajasthan's Ranthambore National Park.Joy over India tiger cubs births BBC News, 6 May 2008. In June 2008, a tiger from Ranthambore was relocated to Sariska Tiger Reserve, where all tigers had fallen victim to poachers and human encroachments since 2005.Rahman, M. (2008).

===Bangladesh===

Tigers in Bangladesh are now relegated to the forests of the Sundarbans and the Chittagong Hill Tracts.Khan, M. M. H. (2004). Ecology and conservation of the Bengal tiger in the Sundarbans Mangrove forest of Bangladesh. PhD thesis, University of Cambridge. The Chittagong forest is contiguous with tiger habitat in India and Myanmar, but the tiger population is of unknown status.Sanderson, E., J. Forrest, C. Loucks, J. Ginsberg, E. Dinerstein, J. Seidensticker, P., Leimgruber, M., Songer, A. Heydlauff, T. O’Brien, G. Bryja, S. Klenzendorf, and E. Wikramanayake (2006).

As of 2004, population estimates in Bangladesh ranged from 200 to 419, mostly in the Sunderbans.Ministry of Environment and Forests. (2004). Report on Sundarbans Tiger Census. Ministry of Environment and Forests, Bangladesh. This region is the only mangrove habitat in this bioregion, where tigers survive, swimming between islands in the delta to hunt prey. Bangladesh's Forest Department is raising mangrove plantations supplying forage for spotted deer. Since 2001, afforestation has continued on a small scale in newly accreted lands and islands of the Sundarbans.
From October 2005 to January 2007, the first camera-trap survey was conducted across six sites in the Bangladesh Sundarbans to estimate tiger population density. The average of these six sites provided an estimate of 3.7 tigers per [tpl]convert|100|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl]. Since the Bangladesh Sundarbans is an area of [tpl]convert|5770|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] it was inferred that the total tiger population comprised approximately 200 individuals.[tpl]cite journal | author=Khan, M. | title=Population and prey of the Bengal Tiger Panthera tigris tigris (Linnaeus, 1758) (Carnivora: Felidae) in the  Sundarbans, Bangladesh | journal=Journal of Threatened Taxa | year=2012 | volume=4 | pages=2370–2380 | url=http://threatenedtaxa.org/ZooPrintJournal/2012/February/o266626ii122370-2380.pdf[/tpl] In another study, home ranges of adult female tigers were recorded comprising between [tpl]convert|12|and|14|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl].,[tpl]cite journal | author=Barlow, A.| coauthors=Smith, J.

Since 2007 tiger monitoring surveys have been carried out every year by WildTeam in the Bangladesh Sundarbans to monitor changes in the Bangladesh tiger population and assess the effectiveness of conservation actions. This survey measures changes in the frequency of tiger track sets along the sides of tidal waterways as an index of relative tiger abundance across the Sundarbans landscape.[tpl]cite journal | author=Barlow, A.|coauthors=Ahmed, M.

===Nepal===

The tiger population in the Terai of Nepal is split into three isolated subpopulations that are separated by cultivation and densely settled habitat. The largest population lives in Chitwan National Park and in the adjacent Parsa Wildlife Reserve encompassing an area of [tpl]convert|2543|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] of prime lowland forest. To the west, the Chitwan population is isolated from the one in Bardia National Park and adjacent unprotected habitat further west, extending to within [tpl]convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] of the Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve, which harbours the smallest population.[tpl]cite journal|author=Smith, J. L. D., Ahern, S. C., McDougal, C. | year=1998 | title=Landscape Analysis of Tiger Distribution and Habitat Quality in Nepal | journal= Conservation Biology | volume=12 | issue=6 | pages =1338–1346 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1998.97068.x[/tpl] The bottleneck between the Chitwan-Parsa and Bardia-Sukla Phanta metapopulations is situated just north of the town of Butwal.
As of 2009, an estimated 121 breeding tigers lived in Nepal.[tpl]cite journal|author=Anonymous | year=2009 | title=Estimate of 121 breeding tigers in Nepal | volume=5 1 | pages= 49–50 | journal= Cat News[/tpl] By 2010, the number of adult tigers had reached 155.The Economic Times (2010). Nepal has 155 adult tigers, 5% of world population. Times Internet Limited A survey conducted from December 2009 to March 2010 indicates that 125 adult tigers live in Chitwan National Park and its border areas covering [tpl]convert|1261|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl].WWF Nepal (2010) More tigers found in Nepal as Nepal-India trans-boundary efforts for tiger conservation intensify. WWF News, 2 August 2010.
Between February and June 2013, a camera trapping survey was carried out in the Terai covering an area of [tpl]convert|4841|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] tiger habitat. The country’s tiger population was estimated at 163–253 breeding adults comprising about 127 tigers in the Chitwan-Parsa protected areas, about 54 in the Bardia-Banke National Parks and about 17 in the Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve.

===Bhutan===

As of 2005, the population in Bhutan is estimated at 67–81 individuals. Tigers occur from an altitude of [tpl]convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in the subtropical Himalayan foothills in the south along the border with India to over [tpl]convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in the temperate forests in the north, and are known from 17 of 18 districts. Their stronghold appears to be the central belt of the country ranging in altitude between [tpl]convert|2000|and|3500|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], between the Mo River in the west and the Kulong River in the east.[tpl]cite journal | author=Dorji, D. P., Santiapillai, C. |year=1989|url=http://www.panthera.org/sites/default/files/Dorji%20&%20Santiapillai%201989%20Tiger%20status%20in%20Bhutan_Biological%20Conservation.pdf | title=The Status, Distribution and Conservation of the Tiger Panthera tigris in Bhutan| journal= Biological Conservation | volume=48 | pages= 311–319 | doi=10.1016/0006-3207(89)90105-5 | issue=4[/tpl] In 2010, camera traps recorded a pair of tigers at altitudes of [tpl]convert|3000|to|4100|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. The male was recorded scent-marking, and the female can also be seen to be lactating, confirming that the pair are living within their own territory, and strongly suggesting they are breeding at that altitude.Walker, M. (20 September 2010) Lost tiger population discovered in Bhutan mountains. BBC Earth News.

==Ecology and behavior==

The basic social unit of the tiger is the elemental one of mother and offspring. Adult animals congregate only on an ad hoc and transitory basis when special conditions permit, such as plentiful supply of food. Otherwise they lead solitary lives, hunting individually for the dispersed forest and tall grassland animals, upon which they prey. They establish and maintain home ranges. Resident adults of either sex tend to confine their movements to a definite area of habitat within which they satisfy their needs, and in the case of tigresses, those of their growing cubs. Besides providing the requirements of an adequate food supply, sufficient water and shelter, and a modicum of peace and seclusion, this location must make it possible for the resident to maintain contact with other tigers, especially those of the opposite sex. Those sharing the same ground are well aware of each other’s movements and activities.
In the Panna Tiger Reserve an adult radio-collared male tiger moved [tpl]convert|1.7|to|10.5|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] between locations on successive days in winter, and [tpl]convert|1|to|13.9|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] in summer. His home range was about [tpl]convert|200|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] in summer and [tpl]convert|110|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] in winter. Included in his home range were the much smaller home ranges of two females, a tigress with cubs and a sub-adult tigress. They occupied home ranges of [tpl]convert|16|to|31|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl].Chundawat, T. S., Gogate, N. Johnsingh, A. J. T. (1999) Tigers in Panna: preliminary results from an Indian tropical dry forest, pp. 123–129 in: Seidensticker, J., Christie, S., Jackson, P. (eds.) Riding the Tiger. Tiger Conservation in human-dominated landscapes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. hardback ISBN 0-521-64057-1, paperback ISBN 0-521-64835-1.
The home ranges occupied by adult male residents tend to be mutually exclusive, even though one of these residents may tolerate a transient or sub-adult male at least for a time. A male tiger keeps a large territory in order to include the home ranges of several females within its bounds, so that he may maintain mating rights with them. Spacing among females is less complete. Typically there is partial overlap with neighbouring female residents. They tend to have core areas, which are more exclusive, at least for most of the time. Home ranges of both males and females are not stable. The shift or alteration of a home range by one animal is correlated with a shift of another. Shifts from less suitable habitat to better ones are made by animals that are already resident. New animals become residents only as vacancies occur when a former resident moves out or dies. There are more places for resident females than for resident males.
During seven years of camera trapping, tracking, and observational data in Chitwan National Park, 6 to 9 breeding tigers, 2 to 16 non-breeding tigers, and 6 to 20 young tigers of less than one year of age were detected in the study area of [tpl]convert|100|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl]. One of the resident females left her territory to one of her female offspring and took over an adjoining area by displacing another female; and a displaced female managed to re-establish herself in a neighboring territory made vacant by the death of the resident. Of 11 resident females, 7 were still alive at the end of the study period, 2 disappeared after losing their territories to rivals, and 2 died. The initial loss of two resident males and subsequent take over of their home ranges by new males caused social instability for two years. Of 4 resident males, 1 was still alive and 3 were displaced by rivals. Five litters of cubs were killed by infanticide, 2 litters died because they were too young to fend for themselves when their mothers died. One juvenile tiger was presumed dead after being photographed with severe injuries from a deer snare. The remaining young lived long enough to reach dispersal age, 2 of them becoming residents in the study area.[tpl]cite journal|author=Barlow, A. C. D., McDougal, C., Smith, J. L.

===Hunting and diet===

Tigers are  carnivores. They prefer hunting large ungulates such as chital, sambar, gaur, and to a lesser extent also barasingha, water buffalo, nilgai, serow and takin. Among the medium-sized prey species they frequently kill wild boar, and occasionally hog deer, muntjac and Gray langur. Small prey species such as porcupines, hares and peafowl form a very small part in their diet. Due to the encroachment of humans into their habitat, they also prey on domestic livestock.[tpl]cite journal|author=Bagchi, S., Goyal, S.

In most cases, tigers approach their victim from the side or behind from as close a distance as possible and grasp the prey's throat to kill it. Then they drag the carcass into cover, occasionally over several hundred meters, to consume it. The nature of the tiger's hunting method and prey availability results in a "feast or famine" feeding style: they often consume [tpl]convert|18|-|40|kg|lb[/tpl] of meat at one time.
Bengal tigers have been known to take other predators, such as leopards, wolves, jackals, foxes, crocodiles, Asiatic black bears, sloth bears, and dholes as prey, although these predators are not typically a part of their diet. Adult elephants and rhinoceroses are too large to be successfully tackled by tigers, but such extraordinarily rare events have been recorded. The Indian hunter and naturalist Jim Corbett described an incident in which two tigers fought and killed a large bull elephant. If injured, old or weak, or their normal prey is becoming scarce, they may even attack humans and become man-eaters.Mazak, V. (1996) Der Tiger : Panthera tigris. Westarp Wissenschaften, Magdeburg, Heidelberg, Berlin, Oxford ISBN 3-89432-759-6.

===Reproduction and lifecycle===

The tiger in India has no definite mating and birth seasons. Most young are born in December and April.Brander, A. A. D. (1923) Wild Animals in Central India. Edwin Arnold & Co., London. Young have also been found in March, May, October and November.Sanderson, G. P. (1912) Thirteen years among the wild beasts of India: their haunts and habits from personal observations; with an account of the modes of capturing and taming elephants. John Grant, Edinburgh. In the 1960s, certain aspects of tiger behaviour at Kanha National Park indicated that the peak of sexual activity was from November to about February, with some mating probably occurring throughout the year.Schaller, G. (1967) The Deer and the Tiger: A Study of Wildlife in India. Chicago Press, Chicago.
Males reach maturity at 4–5 years of age, and females at 3–4 years. A Bengal comes into heat at intervals of about 3–9 weeks, and is receptive for 3–6 days. After a gestation period of 104–106 days, 1–4 cubs are born in a shelter situated in tall grass, thick bush or in caves. Newborn cubs weigh [tpl]convert|780|to|1600|g|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] and they have a thick wooly fur that is shed after 3.5–5 months. Their eyes and ears are closed. Their milk teeth start to erupt at about 2–3 weeks after birth, and are slowly replaced by permanent dentition from 8.5–9.5 weeks of age onwards. They suckle for 3–6 months, and begin to eat small amounts of solid food at about 2 months of age. At this time, they follow their mother on her hunting expeditions and begin to take part in hunting at 5–6 months of age. At the age of 2–3 years, they slowly start to separate from the family group and become transient — looking out for an area, where they can establish their own territory. Young males move further away from their mother's territory than young females. Once the family group has split, the mother comes into heat again.

==Threats==

Over the past century tiger numbers have fallen dramatically, with a decreasing population trend. None of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within the Bengal tiger range is large enough to support an effective population size of 250 individuals. Habitat losses and the extremely large-scale incidences of poaching are serious threats to the species' survival.
The challenge in the Western Ghats forest complex in western South India, an area of [tpl]convert|14400|mi2|km2|sp=us[/tpl] stretching across several protected areas is that people literally live on top of the wildlife. The Save the Tiger Fund Council estimates that 7,500 landless people live illegally inside the boundaries of the [tpl]convert|386|sqmi|km2|adj=on[/tpl] Nagarhole National Park in southwestern India. A voluntary if controversial resettlement is underway with the aid of the Karnataka Tiger Conservation Project led by K. Ullas Karanth of the Wildlife Conservation Society.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
A 2007 report by UNESCO, "Case Studies on Climate Change and World Heritage" has stated that an anthropogenic 45-cm rise in sea level, likely by the end of the 21st century, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, combined with other forms of anthropogenic stress on the Sundarbans, could lead to the destruction of 75% of the Sundarbans mangroves.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
The Forest Rights Act passed by the Indian government in 2006 grants some of India's most impoverished communities the right to own and live in the forests, which likely brings them into conflict with wildlife and under-resourced, under-trained, ill-equipped forest department staff. In the past, evidence showed that humans and tigers cannot co-exist.Buncombe, A. (31 October 2007) The face of a doomed species. The Independent.

===Poaching===

The most significant immediate threat to the existence of wild tiger populations is the illegal trade in poached skins and body parts between India, Nepal and China. The governments of these countries have failed to implement adequate enforcement response, and wildlife crime remained a low priority in terms of political commitment and investment for years. There are well-organised gangs of professional poachers, who move from place to place and set up camp in vulnerable areas. Skins are rough-cured in the field and handed over to dealers, who send them for further treatment to Indian tanning centres. Buyers choose the skins from dealers or tanneries and smuggle them through a complex interlinking network to markets outside India, mainly in China. Other factors contributing to their loss are urbanization and revenge killing. Farmers blame tigers for killing cattle and shoot them. Their skins and body parts may however become a part of the illegal trade.Banks, D., Lawson, S., Wright, B. (eds.) (2006) Skinning the Cat: Crime and Politics of the Big Cat Skin Trade. Environmental Investigation Agency, Wildlife Protection Society of India
The illicit demand for bones and body parts from wild tigers for use in Traditional Chinese medicine is the reason for the unrelenting poaching pressure on tigers on the Indian subcontinent. For at least a thousand years, tiger bones have been an ingredient in traditional medicines that are prescribed as a muscle strengthener and treatment for rheumatism and body pain.Hemley, G., Mills, J. A. (1999) "The beginning of the end of tigers in trade?" in: Seidensticker, J., Christie, S., Jackson, P. (eds.) Riding the Tiger. Tiger Conservation in human-dominated landscapes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. hardback ISBN 0-521-64057-1, paperback ISBN 0-521-64835-1
Between 1994 and 2009, the Wildlife Protection Society of India has documented 893 cases of tigers killed in India, which is just a fraction of the actual poaching and trade in tiger parts during those years.Wildlife Protection Society of India (2009) WPSI's Tiger Poaching Statistics.
In 2006, India's Sariska Tiger Reserve lost all of its 26 tigers, mostly to poaching.Bhaskarang, G. (19 June 2009) Poachers driving Indian tigers into oblivion. The Japan Times Online. In 2007, police in Allahabad raided a meeting of suspected poachers, traders and couriers. One of the arrested persons was the biggest buyer of tiger parts in India who used to sell them off to the Chinese traditional medicinal market, using women from a nomadic tribe as couriers.Banerjee, B. (2007). Tiger Poaching Ring Busted by Indian Police. National Geographic Society News, 6 December 2007. In 2009, none of the 24 tigers residing in the Panna Tiger Reserve were left due to excessive poaching.Ali, F. M. (2009). Indian tiger park has no tigers. BBC News 14 July 2009.
In November 2011, two tigers were found dead in Maharashtra: a male tiger was trapped and killed in a wire snare; a tigress died of electrocution after chewing at an electric cable supplying power to a water pump; another tigress was found dead in Kanha Tiger Reserve landscape — poisoning is suspected to be the cause of her death.Wildlife Watch Group. (2011). Central India Loses Four Tigers, including the Legendary B2. Wildlife Times 20: 9.

===Human-tiger conflict===

The Indian subcontinent has served as a stage for intense human and tiger confrontations. The region affording habitat where tigers have achieved their highest densities is also one which has housed one of the most concentrated and rapidly expanding human populations. At the beginning of the 19th century tigers were so numerous it seemed to be a question as to whether man or tiger would survive. It became the official policy to encourage the killing of tigers as rapidly as possible, rewards being paid for their destruction in many localities. The United Provinces supported large numbers of tigers in the submontane Terai region, where man-eating had been uncommon. In the latter half of the 19th century, marauding tigers began to take a toll of human life. These animals were pushed into marginal habitat, where tigers had formerly not been known, or where they existed only in very low density, by an expanding population of more vigorous animals that occupied the prime habitat in the lowlands, where there was high prey density and good habitat for reproduction. The dispersers had no where else to go, since the prime habitat was bordered in the south by cultivation. They are thought to have followed back the herds of domestic livestock that wintered in the plains when they returned to the hills in the spring, and then being left without prey when the herds dispersed back to their respective villages. These tigers were the old, the young and the disabled. All suffered from some disability, mainly caused either by gunshot wounds or porcupine quills.McDougal, C. (1987) "The man-eating tigers in geographical historical perspective", in: Tilson, R. L., Seal, U.S. (eds.) Tigers of the World. Noyes Publications, New Jersey. pp. 435–448, ISBN 0815511337.
In the Sundarbans, 10 out of 13 man-eaters recorded in the 1970s were males, and they accounted for 86% of the victims. These man-eaters have been grouped into the confirmed or dedicated ones who go hunting especially for human prey; and the opportunistic ones, who do not search for humans but will, if they encounter a man, attack, kill and devour him. In areas where opportunistic man-eaters were found, the killing of humans was correlated with their availability, most victims being claimed during the honey gathering season.[tpl]cite journal|author=Hendrichs, H. |year=1975|title=The status of the tiger (Panthera tigris) in the Sundarbans Mangrove|journal= Säugetierkundliche Mitteilungen |volume=23|pages= 161–199[/tpl] Tigers in the Sunderbans presumably attacked humans who entered their territories in search of wood, honey or fish, thus causing them to defend their territories. The number of tiger attacks on humans may be higher outside suitable areas for tigers, where numerous humans are present but which contain little wild prey for tigers.[tpl]cite journal|author=Jackson, P. |year=1985|title=Man-eaters|journal= International Wildlife |volume=15|pages= 4–11[/tpl] Between 1999 and 2001, the highest concentration of tigers attacks on people occurred in the northern and western boundaries of the Bangladesh Sundarbans. Most people were attacked in the mornings while collecting fuel wood, timber, or other raw materials, or while fishing.[tpl]cite journal|author=Azad, M. A. K., Hashem, M. A., Hossain, M.

In Nepal, the incidence of man-eating tigers has been only sporadic. In Chitwan National Park no cases have been recorded prior to 1980. In the following few years, 13 persons have been killed and eaten in the park and its environs. In the majority of cases, man-eating appeared to have been related to an intra-specific competition among male tigers.
In December 2012, a tiger was shot by the Kerala Forest Department on a coffee plantation on the fringes of the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary. Chief Wildlife Warden of Kerala ordered the hunt for the animal after mass protests erupted as the tiger had been carrying away livestock. The Forest Department had constituted a special task force to capture the animal with the assistance of a 10-member Special Tiger Protection Force and two trained elephants from the Bandipur Tiger Reserve in Karnataka.Straying tiger meets with a bloody end, The Hindu, 3 December 2012.Manoj, E. M. (3 December 2012) Tiger gone, but tension simmers, The Hindu.

==Conservation efforts==

An area of special interest lies in the Terai Arc Landscape in the Himalayan foothills of northern India and southern Nepal, where 11 protected areas comprising dry forest foothills and tall-grass savannas harbor tigers in a [tpl]convert|49000|km2|mi2[/tpl] landscape. The goals are to manage tigers as a single metapopulation, the dispersal of which between core refuges can help maintain genetic, demographic, and ecological integrity, and to ensure that species and habitat conservation becomes mainstreamed into the rural development agenda. In Nepal a community-based tourism model has been developed with a strong emphasis on sharing benefits with local people and on the regeneration of degraded forests. The approach has been successful in reducing poaching, restoring habitats, and creating a local constituency for conservation.Damania, R., Seidensticker, J., Whitten, T., Sethi, G., Mackinnon, K., Kiss, A., Kushlin, A. (2008)  A Future for Wild Tigers. World Bank, Washington, D.C.

===In India===

In 1972, Project Tiger was launched aiming at ensuring a viable population of tigers in the country and preserving areas of biological importance as a natural heritage for the people. The project's task force visualised these tiger reserves as breeding nuclei, from which surplus animals would emigrate to adjacent forests. The selection of areas for the reserves represented as close as possible the diversity of ecosystems across the tiger's distribution in the country. Funds and commitment were mustered to support the intensive program of habitat protection and rehabilitation under the project. By the late 1980s, the initial nine reserves covering an area of [tpl]convert|9115|km2|sqmi[/tpl] had been increased to 15 reserves covering an area of [tpl]convert|24700|km2|sqmi[/tpl]. More than 1100 tigers were estimated to inhabit the reserves by 1984.Panwar, H. S. (1987) Project Tiger: The reserves, the tigers, and their future. In: Tilson, R. L., Seal, U. S., Minnesota Zoological Garden, IUCN/SSC Captive Breeding Group, IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group. Tigers of the world: the biology, biopolitics, management, and conservation of an endangered species. Noyes Publications, Park Ridge, N.J., pp. 110–117, ISBN 0815511337.
Through this initiative the population decline was reversed initially, but has resumed in recent years; India's tiger population decreased from 3,642 in the 1990s to just over 1,400 from 2002 to 2008.Ramesh, R. (13 February 2008) Indian wild tiger numbers almost halve. Guardian News and Media Limited.
The Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 enables government agencies to take strict measures so as to ensure the conservation of the Bengal tigers. The Wildlife Institute of India estimates showed that tiger numbers had fallen in Madhya Pradesh by 61%, Maharashtra by 57%, and Rajasthan by 40%. The government's first tiger census, conducted under the Project Tiger initiative begun in 1973, counted 1,827 tigers in the country that year. Using that methodology, the government observed a steady population increase, reaching 3,700 tigers in 2002. However, the use of more reliable and independent censusing technology (including camera traps) for the 2007–2008 all-India census has shown that the numbers were in fact less than half than originally claimed by the Forest Department.
Following the revelation that only 1,411 Bengal tigers exist in the wild in India, down from 3,600 in 2003, the Indian government has decided to set up eight new tiger reserves.Sharma, A. (13 February 2008) article India Reports Sharp Decline in Wild Tigers. National Geographic News.
Because of dwindling tiger numbers, the Indian government has pledged US$153 million to further fund the Project Tiger initiative, set-up a Tiger Protection Force to combat poachers, and fund the relocation of up to 200,000 villagers to minimize human-tiger interaction.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4272945.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Tigers flown by helicopter to Sariska reserve to lift numbers in western India  | date=5 July 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010 | first=Jeremy | last=Page[/tpl]
Tiger scientists in India, such as Raghu Chundawat and Ullas Karanth, have faced criticism from the forest department. Both these scientists have been for years calling for use of technology in the conservation efforts. Chundawat, in the past, had been involved with radio telemetry (collaring the tigers). While studying tigers in Panna tiger reserve, he repeatedly warned the FD authorities about the problem of tiger poaching in the reserve; they remained in denial, producing bogus numbers of tigers in their reports, and banned Chundawat from the reserve. Eventually, however, it was proven he was right, as in 2008. the authorities admitted that all tigers in Panna have been poached.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.ndtv.com/news/india/panna-lost-tigers-elevated-officials-21192.php# | title=The great Panna cover-up | publisher=NDTV |date=29 April 2010| accessdate=29 April 2009[/tpl] Karanth has been instrumental in using camera traps, radiotelemetry and prey counts. During the 1990s and early 2000s he also noticed that tiger numbers were significantly lower than the official figures; his insistence on using modern science in tiger conservation and uncompromising efforts to save tigers and their habitat have earned him many enemies.
The project to map all the forest reserves in India has not been completed yet, though the Ministry of Environment and Forests had sanctioned Rs. 13 million for the same in March 2004.
George Schaller wrote:Shashwat, D.C. (27 June 2007) "The Last Roar?", Dataquest Magazine, India.
 
 "India has to decide whether it wants to keep the tiger or not. It has to decide if it is worthwhile to keep its National Symbol, its icon, representing wildlife. It has to decide if it wants to keep its natural heritage for future generations, a heritage more important than the cultural one, whether we speak of its temples, the Taj Mahal, or others, because once destroyed it cannot be replaced."

===In Bangladesh===

WildTeam is working with local communities and the Bangladesh Forest Department to reduce human-tiger conflict in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. For over 100 years people, tigers, and livestock have been injured and killed in the conflict; in recent decades up to 50 people, 80 livestock, and 3 tigers have been killed in a year. Now, through WildTeam's work, there is a boat-based Tiger Response team that provides first aid, transport, and body retrieval support for people being killed in the forest by tigers. WildTeam has also set up 49 volunteer Village Response Teams that are trained to save tigers that have strayed into the village areas and would be otherwise killed. These village teams are made up of over 350 volunteers, who are also now supporting anti-poaching work and conservation education/awareness activities. WildTeam also works to empower local communities to access the government funds for compensating the loss/injury of livestock and people from the conflict. To monitor the conflict and assess the effectiveness of actions, WildTeam have also set up a human-tiger conflict data collection and reporting system.

===Admixed genetic heritage===

In July 1976, Billy Arjan Singh acquired a hand-reared tigress named Tara from Twycross Zoo in the United Kingdom, and reintroduced her to the wild in Dudhwa National Park with the permission of India's then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.Singh, A. (1981). Tara, a tigress. Quartet Books, London and New York, ISBN 070432282X. In the 1990s, some tigers from this area were observed to have the typical appearance of Siberian tigers, namely a large head, pale fur, white complexion, and wide stripes, and were suspected to be Bengal-Siberian tiger hybrids. Billy Arjan Singh sent hair samples of tigers from the national park to the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad where the samples were analysed using mitochondrial sequence analysis. Results revealed that the tigers in question had an Indian tiger mitochondrial haplotype indicating that their mother was an Indian tiger.[tpl]cite journal | author=Shankaranarayanan, P., Singh, L. | year=1998 | url=http://www.iisc.ernet.in/~currsci/nov10/articles18.htm | title=Mitochondrial DNA sequence divergence among big cats and their hybrids | journal= Current Science | volume=75 | issue=9 | pages= 919–923[/tpl] Skin, hair and blood samples from 71 tigers collected in various Indian zoos, in the National Museum in Kolkata and including two samples from Dudhwa National Park were prepared for microsatellite analysis that revealed that two tigers had alleles in two loci contributed by Bengal and Siberian tiger subspecies.[tpl]cite journal|author=Shankaranarayanan, P., Banerjee, M., Kacker, R.

==="Re-Wilding" project in South Africa===

In 2000, the Bengal tiger re-wilding project Tiger Canyons was started by John Varty, who together with the zoologist Dave Salmoni trained captive-bred tiger cubs how to stalk, hunt, associate hunting with food and regain their predatory instincts. They claimed that once the tigers proved that they can sustain themselves in the wild, they would be released into a free-range sanctuary of South-Africa to fend for themselves.[tpl]cite web |author=Discovery Channel, A. |year=2001 |title=Meet the Tiger Men: John Varty |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080603034011/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/tigers/trainers/trainers_02.html|publisher=Discovery Channel[/tpl]

==In culture==

The tiger is one of the animals displayed on the Pashupati seal of the Indus Valley Civilisation. The tiger crest is the emblem on the Chola coins. The seals of several Chola copper coins show the tiger, the Pandya emblem fish and the Chera emblem bow, indicating that the Cholas had achieved political supremacy over the latter two dynasties. Gold coins found in Kavilayadavalli in the Nellore district of Andra Pradesh have motifs of the tiger, bow and some indistinct marks.Singh, U. (2008). A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century. Pearson Education, India.
