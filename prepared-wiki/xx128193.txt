==Controversies==

===The Gay-Straight Alliance===

In 1999, when the Gay-Straight Alliance Club applied to be a recognized student club, the board of the Orange Unified School District denied the application. The board demanded that the club change its name and agree to limitations on speech of the club members. Students sued the district in federal court based on the Equal Access Act (Colín v. Orange Unified School District, No. SA CV 99-1461).
In February 2000, the judge for the case issued a preliminary injunction ordering the district to allow the club to meet while the lawsuit was pending. In September 2000, the board settled the lawsuit out of court by agreeing to adopt new rules governing student clubs. The Gay-Straight Alliance gained the same rights as any other campus club, was allowed to keep their name, and had no restrictions on their speech.http://www.lambdalegal.org/cgi-bin/iowa/cases/record?record=121http://www.lambdalegal.org/cgi-bin/iowa/news/press.html?record=696

===Faculty Convicted of Registrable Sex Offenses===

From 2003 to 2009, several illegal sexual assaults were committed involving some of the faculty and students at El Modena High School. Four faculty members, including a principal, were convicted for offenses under California Penal Code Section 290, or offenses that require inclusion on the California "Megan's Law" Sex Offender Registry, as well as the federal Adam Walsh Act. Three of the cases resulted in guilty pleas, while one case resulted in a guilty verdict by a jury trial (which has subsequently been overturned). 

==Sports==

A vanguard, used as the school's mascot, is a soldier in the foremost division or the front part of an army. Vanguards are the troops assembled in the front line when going into battle, which is why the school newspaper is titled the ''The Frontline".Web Page: El Modena Frontline Online
