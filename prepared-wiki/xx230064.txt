==Infrastructure==

Oban had the last provincial interlocking tower at the Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway level crossing which was constructed in 1910 and closed in 1990.  The tower has been moved to the Saskatchewan Railway Museum.
Oban tower was a requirement for the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway when it wanted to cross the existing CPR rail tracks. (The Canadian Northern Railway was amalgamated with the Grand Trunk Railway by the Dominion Government to form the Canadian National Railways in 1919.) Oban tower consisted of a 16-frame interlocking machine. There were levers attached to pipes and cranks which controlled semaphore signals and train derails.  If an approaching train did not react to the signals at the crossing, the derails were utilized, causing a minor accident and averting a major collision.  The signals would be operated [tpl]convert|1750|ft|m[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|1200|ft|m[/tpl] along the railway track.  At [tpl]convert|55|ft|m[/tpl] the derail would be set if the train could not stop before the intersection.
There have been [tpl]convert|8800|mi|km[/tpl] railway track in the province of Saskatchewan.  Rail companies were intersected 58 times at level crossings. Some of these were railway lines crossing municipal street car rail lines.  There were 36 Saskatchewan crossings which were controlled by mechanical interlocking machines between the early 1900s and 1990.
