==Early life==

Westenra was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, and is of Dutch[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/25/style/a-night-out-with-hayley-westenra-almost-a-diva.html |title=A Night Out With – Hayley Westenra; Almost a Diva |work=The New York Times |first=Linda |last=Lee |date=25 April 2004 |accessdate=9 November 2008[/tpl] and Irish[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cmusic.tv/?id=41&afc=128&tid=171 |title=Hayley Westenra |publisher=CMusic.tv |accessdate=30 January 2009[/tpl] heritage. Her parents, Jill and Gerald Westenra, have two other children, Sophie and Isaac. Westenra's grandmother Shirley Ireland was a singer, and her grandfather was a pianist who also played the piano accordion.[tpl]cite video |title=Hayley Westenra: Live from New Zealand |medium=DVD |year=2005 |publisher=Universal Music[/tpl]
She began performing at age six when she was cast in the lead singing role of "Little Star" in the Christmas play at her school, Fendalton Open Air School.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.classicalx.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=895 |title=Cobham music wing named for Hayley |work=The Press NZ |date=24 April 2007 |accessdate=26 August 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080313153745/http://www.classicalx.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=895 |archivedate = 13 March 2008[/tpl] After the show, a teacher who had watched the performance approached her parents to tell them that their daughter was "pitch perfect". The teacher encouraged Westenra to learn how to play a musical instrument; Hayley soon after learned to read music and play the violin, piano, guitar, and recorder. She then began voice lessons and discovered a passion for musical theatre. By age 11, she had performed more than 40 times on stage, but was often given male parts: "I got boy parts quite often. In ballet, there were not enough boys. So they ended up choosing half and half. I got chosen to wear the grey suit and the wig, and not the pretty dresses. In A Christmas Carol, I was Tiny Tim, so I got to be quite a sick, sick boy. There was a severe lack of singing boys and, at the time, it was quite disappointing."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/03/entertainment/main1367468.shtml |title=Hayley Westenra: Teen Angel |publisher=CBS News |first=Ellen |last=Crean |date=3 March 2006 |accessdate=11 January 2007[/tpl]

==Career==

At 12, Westenra entered a professional recording studio to record Walking in the Air, a demo album originally created for friends and family. At first, her parents paid for 70 copies; soon after, 1,000 more were cut for sale, hand-out, and publicity. After finishing her album, Westenra and her sister Sophie busked in Christchurch, giving away a few of the original 70 albums (at the behest of passersby) and selling some of the latter 1000. The pair drew large crowds, and one woman asked the girls if they had ever recorded anything. The woman, a journalist with Canterbury Television, asked Westenra to appear on air.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.hayley-westenra-international.com/dhtml-pages/html-2004/news/20040327_Hayley%20Westenra%20-%20Kiwi%20Star%20Impresses%20The%20World.htm |title=Hayley Westenra: Kiwi Star Impresses the World |work=Billboard 15 (3) |first=Paul |last=Sexton |format=Reprint |coauthors=Christie Eliezer, Anastasia Tsioulcas |date=27 March 2004 |accessdate=13 December 2006[/tpl] Gray Bartlett, the director of a concert promotion company, saw the show and became interested in working with Westenra. Shortly after, she was offered a recording deal with Universal Records New Zealand.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2004/07/04/at_17_new_zealand_soprano_has_a_voice_to_be_reckoned_with/ |title=At 17, New Zealand soprano has a voice to be reckoned with |work=Boston Globe |first=Joan |last=Anderman |date=4 July 2004 |accessdate=2 March 2007[/tpl] On that label, Westenra, who in the meantime was attending Burnside High School,[tpl]cite web | last =Hughes | first =Dafydd | title =Nothing Else Matters | work=Grace & Truth Youth | publisher=RBC | date =July–August 2001 | url =http://www.rbc.org.nz/magazine/issue004/youth2.pdf | format =PDF | accessdate =25 February 2011 [/tpl] released a self-titled album of show tunes and light classical songs, as well as My Gift to You, a CD of Christmas music. Following the success of her albums, she was offered and later received lessons from Dame Malvina Major.

===International success===

Westenra's albums were successful in New Zealand, but she was not well known worldwide until she signed a contract with Decca Records and recorded Pure, a CD of classical, light pop, and traditional Māori songs. Decca's British president was also impressed with her voice when they signed her to the label, saying that she was "captivated by the beauty and expressiveness of her voice."[tpl]cite news |title=Teen-age Classics |work=Billboard 41 (1) |first=David |last=McNickel |date=16 February 2002 |accessdate=13 December 2006[/tpl] Pure enjoyed record success: it became the fastest-selling international debut album in the history of the UK classical chart, with 19,068 copies purchased in its first week alone, quickly reached No. 1 on the British charts, and entered the UK Pop Chart at #8.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/content/articles/2005/11/28/hayley_westenra_abbey_preview_feature.shtml |title=Hayley Westenra returns to Abbey... |publisher=BBC Entertainment |accessdate=11 August 2007[/tpl] Over two million copies of Pure have been sold to date.

Pure success ensured that Decca would take Westenra seriously. Some of her fame today can be directly attributed to the way in which Decca promoted her. Although the traditional audience of classical crossover music is adult women, they also promoted her music to children and teenagers.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.hayley-westenra-international.com/dhtml-pages/html-2004/news/20040327_Hayley%20Westenra%20-%20In%20Hailing%20Distance%20Of%20US%20Debut.htm |title=In Hailing Distance of U.S. Debut |format=Reprint |work=Billboard 15 (2) |first=Anastasia |last=Tsioulcas |date=27 March 2004 |accessdate=13 December 2006[/tpl] Westenra recorded the end-title song for Disney's movie Mulan II.[tpl]cite video |title=Mulan II |people=Rooney, Darrell (Director) and Lynne Southerland |publisher=The Walt Disney Company |year=2004[/tpl] They also featured her in the national Radio Disney music education tour for middle-school students.

So some film and TV roles are currently in the works." In 2005, she was featured in the song "Bridal Ballad" recorded for the movie The Merchant of Venice.[tpl]cite video |title=The Merchant of Venice |publisher=Sony Pictures Entertainment |year=2004 |people=Radford, Michael (Director)[/tpl] In 2006, she was featured on the motion picture soundtrack for The New World with the song "Listen to the Wind".

She has won two Japanese Grammies for her work (Song of the Year, "Amazing Grace" and Album of the Year, Pure). Her version of Amazing Grace was used as the theme song for the popular Japanese drama, Shiroi Kyoto (The White Tower). Hayley met the cast of the series during a promotional tour of Japan in October 2003.

Westenra's third international album, Treasure, was released on 26 February 2007 in the UK. All the songs on this CD were chosen by Westenra, who gave her record company "no say in the matter. I basically didn't let them in on what I was recording until the last minute so they had no choice. I didn't give them much room to disagree.""Hayley Westenra in charge of her career", The New Zealand Herald, 28 April 2007. Lexis Nexis. Susquehanna University. 25 May 2007. Tracks on this album include "E Pari Ra", "One Fine Day", "Let Me Lie", "Danny Boy", and "Abide with Me". Westenra co-wrote four of the fifteen tracks, and the album also features singer Humphrey Berney. The US/Australia/NZ edition followed in March under the name Celtic Treasure. Westenra dedicated the album to her grandmother, Shirley Ireland. Inside the sleeve of the British edition, she wrote "I come from a musical family, and one with a real sense of history. My forefathers were on the maiden voyage from Ireland to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1850 – there's even a commemoration plaque in Cathedral Square, Christchurch, which bears the name Westenra. My grandmother used to sit me on her knee and sing songs like Danny Boy from as early as I can remember. A singer herself in her earlier years, she has always been a never-ending source of songs. It's this legacy of music that she's been passing down to me since my childhood, and it's many of these beautiful old songs that I've explored here on my album."
