==History==

WTLC-FM had formerly aired on 105.7 FM under the nicknames "FM 105 WTLC", "Power 105 WTLC", and "WTLC 105 FM", way before the intellectual rights to the format - but not the frequency - were purchased from Emmis Communications by Radio One in 2001. (See the WYXB page for WTLC-FM history before 2001.) Immediately prior to this switch, the station operated under the call letters WBKS as a jammin' oldies station positioned as "Kiss 106.7."
