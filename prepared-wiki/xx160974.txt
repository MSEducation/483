Hyperconnectivity is a term invented by Canadian social scientists Anabel Quan-Haase and Barry Wellman, arising from their studies of person-to-person and person-to-machine communication in networked organizations and networked societies.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1111/1468-2427.00309 |author=Wellman, Barry |title=Physical Place and Cyber Place: The Rise of Networked Individualism |journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=227–52 |date=June 2001 [/tpl] The term refers to the use of multiple means of communication, such as email, instant messaging, telephone, face-to-face contact and Web 2.0 information services.[ref]

Hyperconnectivity is also a trend in computer networking in which all things that can or should communicate through the network will communicate through the network. This encompasses person-to-person, person-to-machine and machine-to-machine communication. The trend is fueling large increases in bandwidth demand and changes in communications because of the complexity, diversity and integration of new applications and devices using the network.
The communications equipment maker Nortel has recognized hyperconnectivity as a pervasive and growing market condition that is at the core of their business strategy. CEO Mike Zafirovski and other executives have been quoted extensively in the press referring to the hyperconnected era.
Apart from network-connected devices such as landline telephones, mobile phones and computers, newly-connectable devices range from mobile devices such as PDAs, MP3 players, GPS receivers and cameras through to an ever wider collection of machines including cars[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/lighthouse/articles/car.html | title=The Fully Networked Car | publisher=International Telecommunication Union ITU[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.popsci.com/popsci/futurecar/f2909aa138b84010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html | publisher=PopSCI | title=Future of the Car[/tpl]  refrigerators[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.exn.ca/Stories/2003/04/22/55.asp | title=Surf the Web…From your lettuce crisper | date=April 22, 2003 | author=Shannon Bentley[/tpl][tpl]cite conference |author1=Gaderer, G. |author2=Sauter, T. |booktitle=6th IEEE AFRICON |volume=1 |pages= 135–8 |doi=10.1109/AFRCON.2002.1146821 | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1146821 | title=Component-oriented design of an intelligent, networked refrigerator | date=October 4, 2002[/tpl] and coffee makers,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=6501173 | title=New Office Perk | work=InformationWeek[/tpl] all equipped with embedded wireline or wireless[tpl]cite web | url=http://telephonyonline.com/mag/telecom_time_nowswim_swim/ | title=The time is now-swim and swim fast: | author=Richard Sewell | date=February 16, 1998 | publisher=Telephony Online[/tpl] networking capabilities.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6637865.stm | title=Hyper-connected generation rises | publisher=BBC News | date=2007-05-09 | accessdate=2010-01-05 [/tpl]  The IP enablement of all devices is a fundamental limitation of IP version 4, and IPv6 is the enabling technology to support massive address explosions.
