==Critical reception==

Jana Pendragon of Allmusic rated the album 2.5 stars out of 5, saying that she "runs the gamut as far as the material she elected to use on this project is concerned, from great tunes by Cheryl Wheeler, Bobbie Cryner, and Julie Miller to run-of-the mill country-pop songs".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/nobody-love-nobody-gets-hurt-mw0000598511|title=Nobody Love, Nobody Gets Hurt review|last=Pendragon|first=Jana|work=Allmusic|accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl] Stephen L. Betts of Country Standard Time praised the title track, as well as the presence of Garth Brooks, Patty Loveless, Trisha Yearwood, Kathy Mattea, and Alison Krauss on backing vocals, saying, "Bogguss' graciousiness in letting others share the spotlight typifies the spirit the album conveys, but it's her own considerable gift for interpretation that draws the listener in subtly, as she weaves bits of magic within each and every track."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=2640|title=Nobody Love, Nobody Gets Hurt review|last=Betts|first=Stephen L.|work=Country Standard Time|accessdate=11 August 2013[/tpl]
