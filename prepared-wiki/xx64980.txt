[[Ironstone]]

CATEGORIES: Sedimentary rocks

Ironstone is a sedimentary rock, either deposited directly as a ferruginous sediment or created by chemical replacement, that contains a substantial proportion of an iron compound from which iron either can be or once was smelted commercially. This term is customarily restricted to hard coarsely banded, nonbanded, and noncherty sedimentary rocks of post-Precambrian age. The Precambrian deposits, which have a different origin, are generally known as banded iron formations. The iron minerals comprising ironstones can consist either of oxides, i.e. limonite, hematite, and magnetite; carbonates, i.e. siderite; silicates, i.e. chamosite; or some combination of these minerals.U.S. Bureau of Mines Staff (1996) Dictionary of Mining, Mineral, & Related Terms.

==Appearance==

Freshly cleaved ironstone is usually grey. The brown external appearance is due to oxidation of its surface. 
Ironstone, being a sedimentary rock is not always homogeneous, and can be found in a red and black banded form called tiger iron, sometimes used for jewelry purposes.
Sometimes ironstone hosts concretions or opal gems.

==Occurrence==

Ironstone occurs in a variety of forms. The various forms of ironstone include siderite nodules; deeply weathered saprolite, i.e. (laterite); and ooidal ironstone .

==Uses==

===Ironstone as a source of iron===

Ironstone, although widespread, is a limited source of iron (Fe). Historically, most of British iron originated from ironstone, but it is now rarely used for this purpose because it is far too limited in quantity to be an economic source of iron ore.

===Ceramics===

Ironstone is used as a component in some ceramics, commonly known as "ironstone china". Josiah Wedgwood also manufactured a "stoneware" china in the 19th century.  It was commonly used for heavy-duty dinner services in the 19th century.G. Bernard Hughes, English and Scottish Earthenware, Abbey Library Charles James Mason (son of the potter Miles Mason) took out a patent for "Mason's Ironstone China" in 1813.Keele University "Mason's Patent Ironstone China","http://www.keele.ac.uk/ravenmason/masonshistory/masonspatentironstonechina/" Ironstone china was very popular during the 1970s.

===In construction===

The stone can also be used as a building material. Examples include the parish churches at Kirby Bellars and South Croxton in Leicestershire.
