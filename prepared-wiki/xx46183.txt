Easter Road is a football stadium located in the Leith area of Edinburgh, Scotland, which is the home ground of Scottish Premiership club Hibernian (Hibs). The stadium currently has an all-seated capacity of 20,421, which makes it the fifth-largest football stadium in Scotland. Easter Road is also known by Hibs fans as "The Holy Ground" or "The Leith San Siro".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hibernianfc.co.uk/news/20110924/sparky-in-the-hibernian_2262950_2461271|title=Sparky in The Hibernian |date=24 September 2011|accessdate=29 October 2011|work=www.hibernianfc.co.uk|publisher=Hibernian F.C.|quote=Buzzing like a wasp and stinging like a diehard Hibee, Leigh Griffiths has brought a gust of invigorating fresh air to the team's attack since joining the club on loan. Having supported Hibernian from the stands as a boy and after playing for the team in green at junior level – before spells with Livingston and Dundee – Griffiths must have felt like he was coming home. But his transition from Leith Academy to the Leith San Siro has not been a smooth ride, although the Scotland under-21 striker says he is glad he got there in the end.[/tpl] The venue has also been used to stage international matches, Scottish League Cup semi-finals and was briefly the home ground of the Edinburgh professional rugby union team.
Hibs first played at the present site of Easter Road in 1893. The record attendance of 65,860, when the stadium had vast terracing sections, was set by an Edinburgh derby on 2 January 1950. The size of the terracing was greatly reduced in the 1980s.  After the publication of the Taylor Report, Hibs considered leaving Easter Road and moving to a different site, but these plans were abandoned in 1994. Redevelopment of the stadium began in 1995 and was completed in 2010. The Easter Road pitch had a pronounced slope until it was removed at the end of the 1999–2000 season.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/scottish_premier/730435.stm |title=Hibs bid farewell to slope |publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport |date=29 April 2000|accessdate=30 October 2011[/tpl]

==History==

The stadium is named after the Easter Road some 300 metres to its west. The road is not named after Easter the festival, but Easter the compass direction, as evidenced in maps by its counterpart Wester Road (now Bonnington Road). It was the haunt of highwaymen before the area was developed. In April 1604 James Hardie of Bounmylnerig was found guilty of robbing Jacques de la Berge, a Fleming, of his gold and silver on the moor in this location. He was hanged at the Mercat Cross on the Royal Mile.
Hibernian played its first match on the Meadows, on 25 December 1875.[tpl]harvnb|Lugton|1999|p=26[/tpl] The club first moved to the Easter Road area in 1880, to a ground known as Hibernian Park.[tpl]harvnb|Lugton|1999|p=46[/tpl] This location had the advantage of being equidistant between their two main sources of support, the Irish immigrant communities in the port of Leith and the Old Town of Edinburgh.[tpl]harvnb|Lugton|1999|p=45[/tpl] When Hibs suffered financial difficulties in the early 1890s, the lease on Hibernian Park expired and developers started building what would become Bothwell Street.[tpl]harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=450[/tpl] The club was reformed in 1892 and a lease on a piece of land called Drum Park was secured.[tpl]harvnb|Lugton|1999|p=199[/tpl] The site had restricted access from Easter Road, a pronounced slope and was in close proximity to Bank Park, the home of Leith Athletic.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/time-up-for-slope-graced-by-the-best-with-easter-road-pitch-due-to-be-levelled-lawrie-reilly-recalls-when-hibs-loved-playing-down-the-hill-1.238564 |title=Time up for slope graced by the best With Easter Road pitch due to be levelled, Lawrie Reilly recalls when Hibs loved playing down the hill |first=Rob |last=Robertson |work=The Herald |publisher=Herald & Times Group |date=26 April 2000 |accessdate=1 January 2014[/tpl] There was a sense of continuity from the previous ground, however, and the supporters were keen to get started again. The first match at Easter Road was played on 4 February 1893, a friendly against Clyde.[tpl]harvnb|Lugton|1999|p=205[/tpl]
Easter Road staged its first Scottish League match when Hibs joined the league in 1893.[tpl]harvnb|Lugton|1999|p=218[/tpl] Hibs were only renting Easter Road, which Edinburgh city planners had designated for future development.[tpl]harvnb|Inglis|1987|p=340[/tpl] This meant the club were unwilling to develop the ground and looked for alternatives. Hibs considered relocating to Aberdeen in 1902, a year before Aberdeen F.C. was formed by a merger of three local clubs. In 1909, work began on a potential new ground in the Piershill area of Ednburgh, but the North British Railway company won a court order allowing them to build a railway line over the ground. No line was ever built, but Hibs' interest in moving to the site was thwarted. The long term future of Easter Road was only secured in 1922, when the club agreed a 25-year lease on the ground. Two years later, three banks of terraces were raised, while a main stand seating 4,480 people was built on the west side of the ground. The redeveloped stadium had a capacity of 45,000. The pitch was also moved 40 yards to the east, providing space for the main stand. The slope was reduced to approximately 6 feet as part of this work.
Hibs enjoyed great success in the period immediately after the end of the Second World War, winning three league championships between 1948 and 1952. A record attendance of 65,860 was set by an Edinburgh derby against Hearts played on 2 January 1950.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://sport.scotsman.com/football/Stand-and-watch-march-of.6483344.jp?articlepage=2 |title=http://sport.scotsman.com/football/Stand-and-watch-march-of.6483344.jp?articlepage=1 |title=Stand and watch march of progress at Hibs |work=Edinburgh Evening News|publisher=Johnston Press |date=19 August 2010 |last=Hardie |first=David |accessdate=25 August 2010[/tpl] This is also a record for any football match played in Edinburgh.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/sport/Magical-Bara-to-cast-spell.3310893.jp |title=Magical Barça to cast spell before Hearts' record crowd |work=The Scotsman |last=Halliday|first=Stephen|accessdate=30 October 2011|date=28 July 2007|publisher=Johnston Press[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/6920204.stm |title=Hearts heading for a home record |publisher=BBC|work=BBC Sport |date=27 July 2007|accessdate=30 October 2011[/tpl] As the fans had been tightly packed on the terraces to achieve this record attendance, the size of the East Terrace was increased further. The club even drew up plans to expand the overall capacity to nearly 100,000. This would have been done by raising each end terrace to the same height as the east side, but these plans were never realised.
Hibs were one of the first clubs to install corner floodlight pylons, rather than the roof-mounted lights used at Ibrox. The Easter Road floodlights were installed by a local company, Miller & Stables, who would construct similar leaning gantries in many other Scottish grounds. They were first used for an Edinburgh derby played on 18 October 1954. A roof was put over the North Terrace in 1960, but the ground was largely unchanged through the 1960s and 1970s. The capacity was reduced in 1975 to 30,000, due to the regulations of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act. Hibs became the first club in Scotland to install undersoil heating, in 1980. Benches were installed in the North Terrace in 1982, but this was only because they were cheaper than replacing the terrace crush barriers. Soon afterwards, Hibs chairman Kenny Waugh admitted that the stadium was a "mess".
The height of the East Terrace was greatly reduced and a roof was erected in the mid-1980s.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/european/how_hibs_ground_easter_road_has_evolved_since_waugh_sent_in_bulldozers_in_1983_1_474241 |title=How Hibs ground Easter Road has evolved since Waugh sent in bulldozers in 1983 |work=The Scotsman |publisher=Johnston Press|date=23 February 2010 |accessdate=1 November 2011[/tpl] This work reduced the capacity to 27,000. Hibs was taken over by a consortium led by David Duff in 1987. The new regime spent approximately £1 million on executive boxes and refurbishments, but their policy of diversifying the business into property and public houses crippled the club financially when there was an economic downturn in the late 1980s. Hearts chairman Wallace Mercer attempted a takeover of Hibs in June 1990, with the intention of merging the two major Edinburgh football clubs. The Hibs fans protested against this and Mercer was prevented from gaining the 75% shareholding that was needed to close Hibs.
Sir Tom Farmer took control of Hibs in 1991,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hibernian/3109551.stm |title=Hibs reveal Farmer stake |publisher=BBC|work=BBC Sport |date=30 July 2003[/tpl] but the club was still faced with the need to develop a stadium that would meet the requirements of the Taylor Report. Hibs entered talks with Edinburgh District Council about sharing a new stadium with Hearts, but the proposed site of Ingliston was in the wrong part of the city for Hibs. The club was more interested in the possibility of playing at Meadowbank Stadium, only a few hundred yards from Easter Road, but there were planning difficulties with adapting Meadowbank into a large football stadium. The reorganisation of the club after Farmer took control meant that there was no real pressure to move, as he also owned Easter Road. The Hibs board made an assessment, however, that the ground could not be renovated in a cost-effective fashion before the August 1994 deadline set by the Taylor Report.[tpl]harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=451[/tpl] Hibs proposed in January 1992 to sell Easter Road and move to a site owned by Farmer in Straiton.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article1144477.ece|work=The Sunday Times|publisher=News International|date=22 June 2003|last=Buckland|first=Simon|accessdate=15 March 2011|title=Sleeping with the enemy[/tpl] Hibs also invited Hearts to share this stadium, as their proposal for a site in Millerhill had been rejected by planners. Those plans were scaled down in 1993 when Lothian Regional Council refused to allow the rest of the Straiton site to be used for commercial development. The Hibs board continued to back the Straiton proposal and they insisted the installation of bucket seats in the uncovered South Terrace was merely to comply with the Taylor Report deadline. This measure also reduced the capacity of Easter Road to 13,500.
Later in 1994, however, the Straiton proposals were abandoned and Easter Road underwent major redevelopment  in 1995. Stands behind each goal were built at a cost of £8 million, increasing the capacity to 16,531. The ground was made all seated by the installation of bucket seats in the East Terrace during 1995.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://sport.scotsman.com/sport/Fans39-favourite-to-make-its.6094654.jp |publisher=Johnston Press|work=The Scotsman |title=Fans' favourite to make its last stand as sun sets on the East |date=23 February 2010 |accessdate=23 February 2010 |last=Leslie |first=Colin[/tpl] Views of the pitch from this stand were somewhat restricted by supporting pillars.

Club director Rod Petrie commented that any decision would be based on financial grounds and after consultation with the fanbase, as the club were not being forced to move.

The club first obtained planning permission to replace the East Stand in 1999, and this was renewed in 2005. Hibs started a consultation with supporters on its redevelopment in 2007.

==Structure and facilities==

Easter Road is an all-seated stadium, split into four geographic sections, known as the Famous Five (formerly North), East, South and West Stands. The Famous Five and South Stands are the oldest part of the present stadium, built in 1995. Each stand has two tiers, a cantilevered roof and a capacity of nearly 4,000. To keep within the boundaries of the site, the upper deck of each stand angles toward the centre. When the stands were built, the Famous Five Stand was above pitch level and the South Stand was below, but this was corrected when the natural slope was removed.[tpl]harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=452[/tpl] Each stand also stretched beyond the east touchline, which was corrected by widening the pitch when the East Stand was rebuilt. Between the two tiers of the Famous Five Stand there are function suites and lounges. Before the stands were rebuilt in the 1990s, the north and south ends of Easter Road were known as the Cowshed and Dunbar End respectively. The southern end was called the Dunbar End because there was a lemonade factory named Dunbar's located behind it.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/i-ll-see-you-at-the-dunbar-s-end-sandra-1-1344864 |title=I'll see you at the Dunbar's end, Sandra |work=The Scotsman |publisher=Johnston Press |date=17 October 2007 |accessdate=1 January 2014[/tpl]
The West Stand, which initially had a capacity of 6,500, was built in 2001. A reception area, club offices, media centre, banqueting suites, hospitality area and changing rooms are located in the West Stand.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hibernian/1119456.stm |title=Bulldozers arrive at Easter Road |date= 16 January 2001 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC[/tpl] The capacity of the West Stand was reduced slightly when the new East Stand was constructed in 2010, as the pitch was widened during this development.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/new_stadium_rapidly_taking_shape_as_hibs_ensure_constructioni_kept_to_schedule_1_1237498 |title=New stadium rapidly taking shape as Hibs ensure construction is kept to schedule |work=Edinburgh Evening News |publisher=Johnston Press |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=30 October 2011[/tpl] The East Stand, which is the newest part of the stadium, was built in 2010.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hibernian/8528014.stm |title=Hibernian hail Easter Road stadium expansion |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=22 February 2010 |accessdate=30 October 2011[/tpl] It is the only stand that is not split into two tiers and has a capacity of 6,400.
