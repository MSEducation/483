==Ride experience==

Riders board one of the nine boats. Before the ride's operational cycle begins the floor under the boats get filled with water, resulting in the boats floating. Once the ride begins the boats rotate like a traditional teacups attraction from an amusement park. There are six water guns that are equipped onto the boats as a way to splash other riders and bystanders.[tpl]cite journal|title=La Ronde introduces Aqua Twist|journal=Park World Magazine|date=June 2013|page=14[/tpl] The ride operates with nine boats that feature six seats each, resulting in 54 riders per cycle.
