==History==

After graduating from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in 1914, Edwin G. Booz developed the business theory that companies would be more successful if they could call on someone outside their own organizations for expert, impartial advice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.boozallen.com/about/history |title=Booz Allen History |publisher=Boozallen.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15[/tpl] This theory developed into a new profession — management consulting — and the firm that would bear his name. Booz established a small consulting firm in Chicago, and two years later, he and two partners formed the Business Research and Development Company, which conducted studies and performed investigational work for commercial and trade organizations. This service, which Booz labeled as the first of its kind in the Midwest, soon attracted such clients as Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Chicago's Union Stockyards and Transit Company, and the Canadian & Pacific Railroad."[tpl]cite web|url=http://companies.jrank.org/pages/604/Booz-Allen-Hamilton-Inc.html |title=JRANK Booz Allen Hamilton History |publisher=Companies.jrank.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15[/tpl]
By the end of the 1950s, Time Magazine dubbed the firm "the world's largest, most prestigious management consulting firm."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/lehman/chrono.html?company=booz_allen_hamilton_inc |title=Booz, Allen & Hamilton, Inc. - Lehman Brothers Collection |publisher=Library.hbs.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15[/tpl]
In 1970, Booz Allen went public with an initial offering of 500,000 shares at $24 per share. Trading continued through 1976.
The company was spun off from Booz Allen Hamilton in conjunction with a private equity takeover by The Carlyle Group in 2008. The firm represents the commercial portion of the consulting business, as well as all consulting operations with government entitites outside the United States. Booz Allen Hamilton was then focused exclusively on U.S. government consulting endeavors. However, as Booz Allen Hamilton's three-year noncompete provision has expired, it is now building out its commercial consulting practice focusing on technology integration and cybersecurity programs.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/news/2011/10/26/booz-allen-expanding-in-charlotte.html |title=Booz Allen expanding in Charlotte |publisher=bizjournals.com |date= 2011-10-26|first=Will |last=Boye[/tpl]

==Notable contributions==

Over the years, Booz has been credited with developing some of the most important concepts in business. Most notably, the firm coined the terms and developed the concepts of supply chain, supply chain management, product life cycle, the PERT Chart, and the Organizational DNA concept.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/03/AR2008020302643.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Should This Marriage Be Saved? | first=Zachary A. | last=Goldfarb | date=4 February 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bloomgroup.com/content/how-booz-co-develops-and-markets-consulting-concepts |title=How Booz & Company Develops and Markets Consulting Concepts |publisher=The Bloom Group |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15[/tpl]
The firm publishes the majority of its thought leadership in its quarterly management magazine Strategy+business, which, in 2009, was one of just two business magazines to grow its circulation, along with The Economist. The publication's founding Editor-in-Chief Joel Kurtzman was a former Harvard Business Review Editor-in-Chief. While at strategy+business, he coined the widely used term thought leader.
In 2010, the independent White Space report on consulting firms' thought leadership, ranked Booz & Company as first in foresight because of "the consistently interesting and topical writing in strategy+business".http://www.sourceforconsulting.com/whitespace/
The Katzenbach Center at Booz & Company has generated pioneering research on the importance of fostering companies' informal organization to improve corporate performance. In a white paper entitled "Fast Track to Recovery"http://www.booz.com/media/uploads/Fast_Track_To_Recovery.pdf and the book Leading Outside the Lines,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.leadingoutsidethelines.com |title=Leading Outside the Lines |publisher=Leading Outside the Lines |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15[/tpl] Booz & Company Partner Jon Katzenbach uses various case studies to illustrate the exchange between the formal and the informal elements of organizations.
