Dwarves is an American punk band formed in Chicago, Illinois, as The Suburban Nightmare, in the mid-1980s. They are currently based in San Francisco, California.Gentile, John (2009) "Interview: Blag Dahlia of the Dwarves", A.V. Club, April 13, 2009, retrieved 2010-02-07 Formed as a garage punk band, their career subsequently saw them move in a hardcore direction before settling into an eclectic punk rock sound emphasizing intentionally shocking lyrics. They have been described as "one of the last true bastions of punk rock ideology in the contemporary musical age"."The Dwarves", Time Off, 2009, retrieved 2010-02-07

==History==

The original members of the Dwarves began making music together in the mid-1980s as teenagers in the Chicago garage rock outfit, Suburban Nightmare, which was compared to The Sonics,Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, ISBN 1-84195-335-0, p. 311-312Carlson, Matt "Horror Stories Review", Allmusic, retrieved 2010-02-07 and which has been described as part of the Paisley Underground scene.Baker, Brian (2008) "Music: The Dwarves", City Beat, October 28, 2008, retrieved 2010-02-07
The band became notorious for self-mutilation, on-stage sex, and taking hard drugs, and their live shows would often only last around fifteen minutes, occasionally cut short due to injury caused by spectators.Carlson, Matt "Dwarves Biography", Allmusic, retrieved 2010-02-07Ali, Lorraine (1993) "Violence Gets Dwarves 15 Minutes of Fame at Bogart's", Los Angeles Times, August 6, 1993"Punk band aiming for longer return set", London Free Press, 12 June 2003, retrieved 2010-02-07 The band's sound began to evolve beyond its early garage roots with their second (nine-minute long) LP,Sprague, David "Dwarves", Trouser Press, retrieved 2010-02-07 Toolin' For A Warm Teabag, which saw the band drifting towards a more truculent punk rock sound, influenced by GG Allin.DaRonco, Mike "Lucifer's Crank Review", Allmusic, retrieved 2010-02-07 The band released Blood Guts & Pussy on Sub Pop in 1989. By this time the Dwarves had dropped their early psychedelic sensibilities and morphed into a hardcore punk band. The Blood Guts & Pussy LP was followed up by EP Lucifer's Crank released by No.6 Records, as well as another Sub Pop LP, the metal-punk Thank Heaven For Little Girls, both in 1991.
In 1993 the band issued a press release stating their guitarist HeWhoCannotBeNamed had been stabbed to death in Philadelphia. Though this later turned out to be a hoax, the band even went as far as to attach a tribute to the "late" guitarist on their 1993 Sub Pop-released album Sugarfix. Sub Pop did not respond well to the hoax and summarily dropped the band from its label. The Dwarves reformed in 1997, releasing The Dwarves Are Young and Good Looking (described by Adam Bregman of Allmusic as "the beginning of a new Dwarves...one that plays real songs, had a set list, and left the club unbloodied"),Bregman, Adam "The Dwarves Are Young and Good Looking Review", Allmusic, retrieved 2010-02-07 and its 2000 followup The Dwarves Come Clean. In the film Me, Myself & Irene, Jim Carrey is seen singing along to Dwarves "Motherfucker", which Dahlia later said he got "tens of thousands of dollars" for.DuShane, Tony (2006) "Punker camp counselor? Blag Dahlia Dwarves' front man calls his solo show his 'camp counselor guy routine' -- with trademark unrepentant, politically incorrect lyrics", San Francisco Chronicle, June 1, 2006, retrieved 2010-02-07 In 2000, the band offered the track "River City Rapist" to George W. Bush as his presidential campaign song."Dwarves Offer Help to George W. Bush on the Road to the White House", PR Newswire, February 10, 2000
In 2004 the band released The Dwarves Must Die, its first LP for the indie label Sympathy for the Record Industry, which featured guest appearances from Dexter Holland (The Offspring), Nick Oliveri (Queens of the Stone Age), Nash Kato (Urge Overkill), and voice actor Gary Owens. Dahlia was assaulted by Josh Homme of QOTSA before a Dwarves show in Los Angeles in 2004, which saw Homme placed on summary probation for thirty-six months.Crandall, Bill & Borzillo-Vrenna, Carrie (2004) "QOTSA Brawl With Dwarves", Rolling Stone, November 11, 2004, retrieved 2010-02-07Levitan, Corey (2005) "Homme Sentenced for Brawl", Rolling Stone, June 10, 2005, retrieved 2010-02-07
In 2009, Blag and HeWhoCannotBeNamed were immortalised as Bobbleheads by Aggronautix.Spacek, Nick (2009) "Dwarves Bobbleheads Now Available", The Pitch, August 18, 2009, retrieved 2010-02-07

==Band members==

Singer Blag Dahlia (aka Julius Seizure, born Paul Cafaro),Ritchie, Ryan (2007) "Blood, Guts and Literacy: Blag Dahlia steps out from behind the Dwarves to wax hysterical", OC Weekly, July 12, 2007, retrieved 2010-02-07 and guitarist HeWhoCannotBeNamed (aka Pete Vietnamcheque) have always been the two core members of the group. The lineup has shifted around them, and currently consists of members "Fresh Prince of Darkness" (aka Marc Diamond from the band Motochrist) on guitar, "Chip Fracture" on bass and backing vocals and returning drummer Gregory Pecker (aka Gnarlie Watts). "Rex Everything" and KMFDM drummer Andy Selway (under the alias Dutch Ovens) are on again/off again members. Former members include "Wholley Smokes", "Dutch Ovens", "Clint Torres", "Tazzie Bushweed", "Thrusty Otis", "Crash Landon", "Wreck Tom ", and "Vadge Moore", among others.

==Music style==

They are known for their simple, loud, yet nuanced punk repertoire, and controversial lyrics.  Since the garage punk sound of their early days, they developed a more direct hardcore punk sound, often identified as "scum punk" due to the intentional perversity of the lyrics. Around the turn of millennium, the Dwarves developed more of a manic pop punk influence. Bits of hardcore, surf rock, pop, hip-hop, and rock & roll all factor into the band's current punk rock sound.
Their shows have been notable for some aggressive fights on stage (with the audience and even a cop), and because HeWhoCannotBeNamed performs either in nothing but a jockstrap or totally nude, apart from his trademark wrestling mask.

==Cover art==

Their album covers are unusual - naked women, and a naked dwarf sodomizing a rabbit covered in blood, for their 1990 album Blood Guts & PussyCarlson, Matt "Blood Guts & Pussy Review", Allmusic, retrieved 2010-02-07 - followed up a decade later, with a similar theme, this time covered in soap suds, for Come Clean.
