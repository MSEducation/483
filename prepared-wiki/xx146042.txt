[[Let's Stop Hanging Out]]

CATEGORIES: 2003 singles, Reuben songs

"Let's Stop Hanging Out" is the third single by Surrey-based rock band Reuben. It was recorded in November 2002 at Jacob's studios in Farnham with Paul Tipler. It was recorded and mixed from start to finish in one day. The b-sides were recorded overnight at Air studios in London with Adam Noble, who had recorded some of the bands early demos at the University of Surrey. It was released in January 2003 on Badmusic and received mixed reviews in the press, but was made Radio 1 single of the week by Colin Murray and reached the top of the MTV2 chart. Presenter Zane Lowe invited the band onto his brown couch to tell them personally. Despite this, people in some parts of the country had difficulty obtaining the single in record shops given its relatively low chart position in the first week.
