Kim Yoon-seok (born January 21, 1968) is a South Korean actor. Kim's theater background led him to be cast in minor roles on film and television. His breakout role came as the villain in gambling film Tazza: The High Rollers (2006), but it was his performance as a pimp and ex-cop in surprise hit The Chaser (2008) that brought him stardom and acting awards. Already in his forties, Kim has since become an acclaimed leading actor in Korean cinema, in films such as Running Turtle (2009), The Yellow Sea (2010), Punch (2011), and The Thieves (2012).

==Career==

Kim Yoon-seok was trained on stage as a member of the renowned Theater Yeonwoo Company (Yeonwoo Mudae), and he debuted in 1988 with A Streetcar Named Desire.[tpl]cite web|title=KIM Yun-seok|url=http://www.koreanfilm.or.kr/jsp/films/index/peopleView.jsp?peopleCd=10005276|work=Korean Film Council|accessdate=2013-04-30[/tpl] He began acting in film and television late in his career. After several years of minor roles, Kim had his breakthrough role as the ruthless gambler Ahgui (meaning "starving demon" in Buddhism) in Choi Dong-hoon's Tazza: The High Rollers. His supporting role was not overshadowed by the leads, and audiences praised his powerful performance. He then appeared on screen in The Chaser directed by Na Hong-jin. Playing a retired cop hunting down a serial killer, he successfully portrayed the gray character, neither evil nor good. The thriller was a critical and commercial hit, and Kim became a major player in the Korean film industry.[tpl]cite web|last=Lee|first=Hyo-won|title=Daejong Film Fest Showcases Trends|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2008/06/141_26718.html|work=The Korea Times|accessdate=2013-04-30|date=29 June 2008[/tpl] He transitioned from one of the finest character actors in the industry into a popular leading actor: Kim played a middle-aged man following his lifelong dream to play in a rock band in The Happy Life, a rural detective trying to capture a legendary prison breaker in Running Turtle,[tpl]cite web|last=Yang|first=Sung-jin|title=A creative take on detective character|url=http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=200906030011|work=The Korea Herald|accessdate=2013-04-30|date=3 June 2009[/tpl] and a Taoist wizard in Jeon Woo Chi.[tpl]cite web|last=Lee|first=Ji-hye|title=Woochi set to work its magic – Part 1|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2009111821343661235|work=10Asia|accessdate=2013-04-30|date=18 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Lee|first=Ji-hye|title=Woochi set to work its magic – Part 2|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2009111821342057691|work=10Asia|accessdate=2013-04-30|date=18 November 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Kang|first=Myoung-seok|title=Gang Dong-won says he may write Woochi sequel|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2009121713424890283|work=10Asia|accessdate=2013-04-30|date=17 December 2009[/tpl] In 2010 Kim reunited with The Chaser costar Ha Jung-woo in Na's ambitious sophomore film The Yellow Sea.[tpl]cite web|last=Han|first=Sang-hee|title=Yellow Sea to offer real drama, thrills|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2012/08/141_76817.html|work=The Korea Times|accessdate=2013-04-30|date=23 November 2010[/tpl] The year after, Punch became the third highest grossing film of 2011, in which Kim portrayed an ill-tempered teacher giving courage to a youth from the slums.[tpl]cite web|last=Lee|first=Jin-ho|title=Hope Seeping from the Scars of Youth, Punch|url=http://enewsworld.mnet.com/enews/contents.asp?idx=769|accessdate=2013-04-30|work=enewsWorld|publisher=CJ E&M|date=6 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Ha Jung-woo, Ha Ji-won Voted Most Popular Movie Stars|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/05/21/2012052101315.html|work=The Chosun Ilbo|accessdate=2013-04-30|date=21 May 2012[/tpl] Kim once again triumphed in 2012, as his summer hit The Thieves became the second best-selling Korean film of all time.[tpl]cite web|last=Cho|first=Jae-eun|title=The Thieves all-star cast set to steal show|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2954303|work=Korea JoongAng Daily|accessdate=2013-04-30|date=13 June 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Quinn|first=Paul|title=The London Korean Film Festival 2012 Interviews - Choi Dong-hoon and Kim Yoon-suk|url=http://www.hangulcelluloid.com/lkff2012interviews.html|work=Hangul Celluloid|accessdate=2013-04-30|date=November 2012[/tpl] He continued working with Korea's leading directors in 2013, in Im Soon-rye's South Bound,[tpl]cite web|last=Park|first=Eun-jee|title=Run to the South explores freedom's pleasures, price|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2966444|work=Korea JoongAng Daily|accessdate=2013-04-30|date=1 February 2013[/tpl] and Jang Joon-hwan's Hwayi: A Monster Boy.[tpl]cite web|last=Frater|first=Patrick|title=Hwayi marks return for Kim, Jang|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/news/hwayi-marks-return-for-kim-jang|work=Film Business Asia|accessdate=2013-04-30|date=12 December 2012[/tpl]
