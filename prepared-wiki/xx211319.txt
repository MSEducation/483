Giovani Devoti (born at Rome, 11 July 1744; died there 18 September 1820) was an Italian canon lawyer and bishop.

The last work is distinguished by its clearness and conciseness, and by its numerous historical notes, attributed, but without any reason, to Cardinal Francesco Saverio Castiglioni, afterwards Pope Pius VIII. In 1817, the King of Spain made obligatory the study of the "Institutiones" of Devoti at the University of Alcal√°; and in 1836, the University of Louvain accepted it as a classical manual of canon law. The work subsequently became more useful for the history than for the practice of canon law.
