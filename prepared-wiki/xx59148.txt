Route 157 is a short state highway in the city of Absecon, New Jersey. The route runs for only [tpl]convert|0.91|mi|km[/tpl] as North Shore Road from an intersection with U.S. Route 30, County Route 585 and Atlantic County Route 601 in the center of Absecon to an intersection with U.S. Route 9 in the northern portion of the city. The route is a former alignment of State Highway Route 4 through Absecon, intersecting with State Highway Route 43 starting in the 1927 state highway renumbering.

The former alignment remained unnumbered until the 1953 state highway renumbering, when it was designated as Route 157.

==Route description==

Route 157 begins at a large intersection with U.S. Route 30 (White Horse Pike), County Route 585 (South Shore Road), Atlantic County Route 601 (New Jersey Avenue) and Creek Road in the city of Absecon. The route heads northward along North Shore Road, passing through the local commercial districts of Absecon. Intersecting with Station Road (the highway connecting Route 157 to the Absecon train station), the route leaves the commercial district and enters the residential areas. There, Route 157 intersects with Atlantic County Route 634 (West Church Street). Route 157 continues northward, intersecting with local roads in a small patch of forestry. At an intersection with Faunce Landing Road, Route 157 turns to the northeast onto its final stretch. Continuing through the forestry, the highway intersects with several local roads and traverses near some residential homes. Still in Absecon, Route 157 becomes surrounded by residential homes, terminating at an intersection with U.S. Route 9 (Wyoming Avenue).[tpl]cite map|url=http://www.maps.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?v=2&FORM=LMLTCP&cp=qk4xsh8ss83c&style=b&lvl=2&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000&phx=0&phy=0&phscl=1&scene=14901644&rtp=pos.39.4232288002968_-74.4996314495802_near%203%20N%20Shore%20Rd%2C%20Absecon%2C%20New%20Jersey%2008201%2C%20United%20States__~pos.39.4328284263611_-74.4894853234291_near%20590%20N%20Shore%20Rd%2C%20Absecon%2C%20New%20Jersey%2008201%2C%20United%20States__&rtop=0~0~0&encType=1|title=Overview map of Route 157|publisher=Bing Maps/Microsoft Inc.|year=2009|cartography=NAVTEQ Inc.|accessdate=November 9, 2009[/tpl]
