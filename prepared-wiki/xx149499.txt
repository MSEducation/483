ClutchFans is a Houston Rockets fan site, founded by David "Clutch" Hardisty.  
Originally named Clutch City, the site was developed as a place for Rockets fans to gather and talk about the team, on August 8, 1996.  The site provides a plethora of information and discussion about the Rockets' past, present, and future.
Recently, in response to the fan site's massive outreach, ClutchFans has received some limited access to Houston Rockets players and personnel as a member of the press.

==History==

ClutchFans was started in 1996 out of a moment of fun.  The creator of the site hacked into an internet account and learned how to put web pages together and posted on the Internet.  The first pages were concocted under the pseudonym of Clutch and the pages created were about Clutch's favorite subject: the Houston Rockets.  Clutch posted game recaps and commentary as well as news stories from around the country on the Rockets. It has a dedicated radio show on a local sports station. The site began with the name "Clutch City 97" but has since gone through several name changes due to copyrights and personal opinion.  As well as changing in name, the site has also changed in appearance, number of visitors, and registered membership.ClutchFans About Section
