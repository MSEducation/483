[[Health claims on food labels]]

CATEGORIES: Food retailing, Nutrition, Packaging

Health claims on food labels are claims by manufacturers of food products that their food will reduce the risk of developing a disease or condition.  For example, it is claimed by the manufacturers of oat cereals that oat bran can reduce cholesterol, which will lower the chances of developing serious heart conditions.

==Law in the United States==

In the United States, these claims, usually referred to as "qualified health claims", are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration in the public interest. See 21 Code of Federal Regulations ยง 101.14.
On July 10, 2003, the Food and Drug Administration announced plans to permit the manufacturers of food products sold in the United States to make health claims on food labels which are supported by inconclusive evidence.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
The rule in place before 2003 required "significant scientific consensus" before a claim could be made. A rule proposed in 2003 would have permitted characterization of health claims using a hierarchy of degrees of certainty:
See the Wikipedia article on dietary supplements for a description of current FDA policy.

==European Laws==

In the United Kingdom, the law requires that any health claim on food labels must be true and not misleading. Food producers may optionally use the (Discontinued in 2010) Joint Health Claims Initiative to determine whether their claims are likely to be legally sustainable.
In early 2005 the European PASSCLAIM project (Process for the Assessment of Scientific Support for Claims on Foods), sponsored by the European Union and coordinated by ILSI-Europe (http://europe.ilsi.org/),  ended. The aim of this project was to develop criteria for the scientific substantiation of claims on foods. Several hundreds of scientists from academia, research institutes, government and industry have contributed to the project. All the resulting papers can be downloaded for free from http://www.ilsi.org/Europe/Pages/PASSCLAIM_Pubs.aspx. The final consensus paper, comprising the final set of criteria, has been published in June 2005 in the European Journal of Nutrition.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m1771j6853041201/ |title=SpringerLink Journal Articles - European Journal of Nutrition - Passclaim: Consensus on Criteria |accessdate=2010-05-23 [/tpl]
