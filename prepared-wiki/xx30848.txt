Altitude sickness—also known as acute mountain sickness (AMS), altitude illness, hypobaropathy, "the altitude bends", or soroche—is a pathological effect of high altitude on humans, caused by acute exposure to low partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude. It commonly occurs above 2,400 metres (8,000 feet).
It presents as a collection of nonspecific symptoms, acquired at high altitude or in low air pressure, resembling a case of "flu, carbon monoxide poisoning, or a hangover".The Mountaineers. Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills, 7th Edition. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2003 It is hard to determine who will be affected by altitude sickness, as there are no specific factors that correlate with a susceptibility to altitude sickness. However, most people can ascend to 2,400 metres (8,000 ft) without difficulty.
Acute mountain sickness can progress to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE), which are potentially fatal.
Chronic mountain sickness, also known as Monge's disease, is a different condition that only occurs after very prolonged exposure to high altitude.A.J. Giannini, H.R. Black, R.L. Goettsche.

==Causes==

The available amount of oxygen to sustain mental and physical alertness decreases with altitude. Available oxygen drops as the air density itself, the number of molecules (of both oxygen and nitrogen) per given volume, drops as altitude increases.
However, the percentage of oxygen in air, at 21%, remains almost unchanged up to [tpl]convert|21,000|m[/tpl].  The RMS velocities of diatomic nitrogen and oxygen are very similar and thus no change occurs in the ratio of oxygen to nitrogen.
Dehydration due to the higher rate of water vapor lost from the lungs at higher altitudes may contribute to the symptoms of altitude sickness.
The rate of ascent, altitude attained, amount of physical activity at high altitude, as well as individual susceptibility, are contributing factors to the onset and severity of high-altitude illness.
Altitude sickness usually occurs following a rapid ascent and can usually be prevented by ascending slowly. In most of these cases, the symptoms are temporary and usually abate as altitude acclimatization occurs. However, in extreme cases, altitude sickness can be fatal.

==Signs and symptoms==

People have different susceptibilities to altitude sickness; for some otherwise healthy people, acute altitude sickness can begin to appear at around 2000 meters (6,500 ft) above sea level, such as at many mountain ski resorts, equivalent to a pressure of 80 kPa.[tpl]Cite web| author=K. Baillie and A. Simpson | title=Acute mountain sickness| url=http://www.altitude.org/high_altitude.php | publisher=Apex (Altitude Physiology Expeditions) | accessdate=8 August 2007[/tpl] — High altitude information for laypeople This is the most frequent type of altitude sickness encountered. Symptoms often manifest themselves six to ten hours after ascent and generally subside in one to two days, but they occasionally develop into the more serious conditions. Symptoms include headache, fatigue, stomach illness, dizziness, and sleep disturbance. Exertion aggravates the symptoms.

Those individuals with the lowest initial partial pressure of end-tidal pCO2 (the lowest concentration of carbon dioxide at the end of the respiratory cycle, a measure of a higher alveolar ventilation) and corresponding high oxygen saturation levels tend to have a lower incidence of acute mountain sickness than those with high end-tidal pCO2 and low oxygen saturation levels.[tpl]cite journal|last=Douglas|first=Danielle|author2=Robert Schoene|title=End-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide and acute mountain sickness in the first 24 hours upon ascent to cusco, peru (3326 meters)|journal=Wilderness and Environment Medicine|year=2010|volume=21|pages=109–113|doi=10.1016/j.wem.2010.01.003|issue=2[/tpl]

===Primary symptoms===

Headaches are the primary symptom used to diagnose altitude sickness, although a headache is also a symptom of dehydration. A headache occurring at an altitude above 2,400 metres (8,000 feet = 76 kPa), combined with any one or more of the following symptoms, may indicate altitude sickness:

===Severe symptoms===

Symptoms that may indicate life-threatening altitude sickness include:
The most serious symptoms of altitude sickness arise from edema (fluid accumulation in the tissues of the body). At very high altitude, humans can get either high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE). The physiological cause of altitude-induced edema is not conclusively established. It is currently believed, however, that HACE is caused by local vasodilation of cerebral blood vessels in response to hypoxia, resulting in greater blood flow and, consequently, greater capillary pressures. On the other hand, HAPE may be due to general vasoconstriction in the pulmonary circulation (normally a response to regional ventilation-perfusion mismatches) which, with constant or increased cardiac output, also leads to increases in capillary pressures. For those suffering HACE, dexamethasone may provide temporary relief from symptoms in order to keep descending under their own power.
HAPE can progress rapidly and is often fatal. Symptoms include fatigue, severe dyspnea at rest, and cough that is initially dry but may progress to produce pink, frothy sputum. Descent to lower altitudes alleviates the symptoms of HAPE.
HACE is a life threatening condition that can lead to coma or death.  Symptoms include headache, fatigue, visual impairment, bladder dysfunction, bowel dysfunction, loss of coordination, paralysis on one side of the body, and confusion. Descent to lower altitudes may save those afflicted with HACE.

==Physiology==

The physiology of altitude sickness is based on the following equation:
[tpl]math|Vgas[tpl]=[/tpl][tpl]sfrac|A|T[/tpl]Dk(P1-P2)[/tpl]
Where [tpl]math|Vgas[/tpl] is the diffusion rate, A is the area of the lung, T is the thickness of the lung membranes, [tpl]math|P1[/tpl] and [tpl]math|P2[/tpl] are the differences in partial pressure of any gas-but most importantly [tpl]math|CO2[/tpl] and [tpl]math|O2[/tpl]-where in high altitudes the partial pressure differences for [tpl]math|O2[/tpl] are low and the differences in partial pressures for [tpl]math|CO2[/tpl] are high.  Thus [tpl]math|CO2[/tpl] will have a high diffusion out and O2 will have a low diffusion though the alveolar membranes and into the blood.
The body's response to high altitude includes the following:

==Prevention==

Ascending slowly is the best way to avoid altitude sickness. Avoiding strenuous activity such as skiing, hiking, etc. in the first 24 hours at high altitude reduces the symptoms of AMS.  Alcohol and sleeping pills are respiratory depressants, and thus slows down the acclimatization process and should be avoided.  Alcohol also tends to cause dehydration and exacerbates AMS.  Thus, avoiding alcohol consumption in the first 24–48 hours at a higher altitude is optimal.

===Altitude acclimatization===

Altitude acclimatization is the process of adjusting to decreasing oxygen levels at higher elevations, in order to avoid altitude sickness.[tpl]Cite journal|author=Muza, S.R.; Fulco, C.S.; Cymerman, A. |title=Altitude Acclimatization Guide |journal=U.S. Army Research Inst. of Environmental Medicine Thermal and Mountain Medicine Division Technical Report |issue=USARIEM–TN–04–05 |year=2004 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7616 |accessdate=5 March 2009 [/tpl] Once above approximately 3,000 metres (10,000 feet = 70 kPa), most climbers and high-altitude trekkers take the "climb-high, sleep-low" approach. For high-altitude climbers, a typical acclimatization regimen might be to stay a few days at a base camp, climb up to a higher camp (slowly), and then return to base camp. A subsequent climb to the higher camp then includes an overnight stay. This process is then repeated a few times, each time extending the time spent at higher altitudes to let the body adjust to the oxygen level there, a process that involves the production of additional red blood cells.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl] Once the climber has acclimatised to a given altitude, the process is repeated with camps placed at progressively higher elevations. The general rule of thumb is to not ascend more than 300 metres (1,000 ft) per day to sleep. That is, one can climb from 3,000 (10,000 feet = 70 kPa) to 4,500 metres (15,000 feet = 58 kPa) in one day, but one should then descend back to 3,300 metres (11,000 feet = 67.5 kPa) to sleep. This process cannot safely be rushed, and this is why climbers need to spend days (or even weeks at times) acclimatising before attempting to climb a high peak. Simulated altitude equipment that produces hypoxic (reduced oxygen) air can be used to acclimate to high altitude, reducing the total time required on the mountain itself.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]
Altitude acclimatization is necessary for some people who move rapidly from lower altitudes to intermediate altitudes (e.g., by aircraft and ground transportation over a few hours), such as from sea level to [tpl]convert|8000|ft|m[/tpl] as in many Colorado, USA mountain resorts. Stopping at an intermediate altitude overnight can alleviate or eliminate occurrences of AMS.

===Medical treatment===

The drug acetazolamide (trade name Diamox) may help some people making a rapid ascent to sleeping altitude above [tpl]convert|2700|m|ft|sigfig=1[/tpl], and it may also be effective if started early in the course of AMS.[tpl]Cite book|author=World Health Organization |title=International travel and health |chapter=CHAPTER 3 Environmental health risks |chapterurl=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241580397_3_eng.pdf |format=PDF |page=31 |date=1 January 2007 |accessdate=21 November 2009[/tpl] Acetazolamide can be taken before symptoms appear as a preventive measure at a dose of 125 mg twice daily. The Everest Base Camp Medical Centre cautions against its routine use as a substitute for a reasonable ascent schedule, except where rapid ascent is forced by flying into high altitude locations or due to terrain considerations.[tpl]Cite web|author=Himalayan Rescue Association - Everest Medical Clinic |title=Prophylaxis |url=http://www.basecampmd.com/expguide/amspremed.shtml |publisher=ExplorersWeb |accessdate=21 November 2009[/tpl] The Centre suggests a dosage of 125 mg twice daily for prophylaxis, starting from 24 hours before ascending until a few days at the highest altitude or on descending; with 250 mg twice daily recommended for treatment of AMS.[tpl]Cite web|author=Himalayan Rescue Association - Everest Medicial Clinic |title=Treating AMS |url=http://www.basecampmd.com/expguide/diamox.shtml |publisher=ExplorersWeb |accessdate=21 November 2009[/tpl] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest a lower dose for prevention of 125 mg acetazolamide every 12 hours.[tpl]Cite book| title=CDC Health Information for International Travel 2010 "The Yellow Book" |editor=Turell D, Brunette G, Kozarsky P, Lefor A |chapter=Chapter 2 The Pre-Travel Consultation - Self-Treatable Diseases - Altitude Illness |author=Hackett P, Shlim D |chapterurl=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2010/chapter-2/altitude-illness.aspx |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=0-7020-3481-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=21 November 2009[/tpl] Acetazolamide, a mild diuretic, works by stimulating the kidneys to secrete more bicarbonate in the urine, thereby acidifying the blood.  This change in pH stimulates the respiratory center to increase the depth and frequency of respiration, thus speeding the natural acclimatization process.  An undesirable side-effect of acetazolamide is a reduction in aerobic endurance performance. Other minor side effects include a tingle-sensation in hands and feet, and it can make carbonated drinks taste "flat".  Although a sulfonamide, acetazolamide is a non-antibiotic and has not been shown to cause life threatening allergic cross-reactivity in those with a self-reported sulfa allergy.[tpl]cite journal|last=Platt|first=D|author2=Griggs RC|title=Use of acetazolamide in sulfonamide-allergic patients with neurologic channelopathies|journal=Archives of Neurology|date=April 2012|volume=69|issue=4|pages=527–9|doi=10.1001/archneurol.2011.2723|pmid=22158718|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22158718|accessdate=11/05/2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Kelly|first=TE|author2=Hacket PH|title=Acetazolamide and sulfonamide allergy: a not so simple story|journal=High Altitude Medicine & Biology|year=2010|volume=11|issue=4|pages=319–23|doi=10.1089/ham.2010.1051|pmid=21190500|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21190500|accessdate=11/05/2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Lee|first=Andrew G|coauthors=Randy Anderson, Randy H.

Prior to the onset of altitude sickness, ibuprofen is a suggested non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and painkiller that can help alleviate both the headache and nausea associated with AMS. It has not been studied for the prevention of cerebral edema (swelling of the brain) associated with extreme symptoms of AMS.[tpl]Cite web| url= http://med.stanford.edu/ism/2012/march/altitude.html | title= Ibuprofen decreases likelihood of altitude sickness, researchers find | author= John Sanford |date=March 2012 | accessdate= 19 September 2012[/tpl]
For centuries, indigenous peoples of the Americas such as the Aymaras of the Altiplano, have chewed coca leaves to try to alleviate the symptoms of mild altitude sickness. In Chinese and Tibetan traditional medicine, an extract of the root tissue of Radix rhodiola is often taken in order to prevent the same symptoms, though neither of these therapies has been proven effective in clinical study.

===Oxygen enrichment===

In high-altitude conditions, oxygen enrichment can counteract the hypoxia related effects of altitude sickness. A small amount of supplemental oxygen reduces the equivalent altitude in climate-controlled rooms. At 3,400 meters (11,155 feet = 67 kPa), raising the oxygen concentration level by 5 percent via an oxygen concentrator and an existing ventilation system provides an effective altitude of 
3,000 metres (10,000 feet = 70 kPa), which is more tolerable for surface-dwellers.[tpl]Cite journal| author = West JB | title = Oxygen enrichment of room air to relieve the hypoxia of high altitude | journal = Respir Physiol | volume = 99 | issue = 2 | pages = 225–232 |date=February 1995 | pmid = 7777705 | doi = 10.1016/0034-5687(94)00094-G| url = | issn = [/tpl]
