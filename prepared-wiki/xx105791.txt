Dangermond is the company's President and Founder, and he works out of Esri's headquarters in Redlands, California.  Dangermond founded Esri to perform land use analysis; however, its focus evolved into GIS software development, highlighted by the release of ARC/INFO in the early 1980s; the development and marketing of ARC/INFO positioned Esri with the dominant market share among GIS software developers.  Today Esri is the largest GIS software developer in the world and its flagship product, ArcGIS, traces its heritage to Dangermond's initial efforts in developing ARC/INFO.
