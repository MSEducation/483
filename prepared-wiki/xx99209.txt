==Life and career==

Bronsart was born in Danzig (Gdańsk), Prussia. He entered the Prussian Guards in 1849, and was appointed to the general staff in 1861 as a captain; after three years of staff service he returned to regimental duty, but was soon reappointed to the staff, and lectured at the Prussian Military Academy, becoming major in 1865 and lieutenant colonel in 1869. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870) he was chief of a section on the General Staff, and conducted the preliminary negotiations for the surrender of the French at Sedan. After the war Bronsart was made a colonel and chief of staff of the Guard army corps, becoming major-general in 1876 and lieutenant general (with a division command) in 1881. Two years later he became war minister, and during his tenure of the post (1883–1889) many important reforms were carried out in the Prussian army, in particular the introduction of the magazine rifle. He was appointed in 1889 to command the I Corps at Königsberg. He died at his estate of Schettnienen near Braunsberg (Braniewo), in 1891 at the age of 59.Amtspresse Preussens [tpl]de icon[/tpl]
