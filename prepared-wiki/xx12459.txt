==Description and history==

The first Indian Park in Brazil was created in the river basin by the Brazilian government in the early 1960s. This park marks the first indigenous territory recognized by the Brazilian government and it was the world's largest indigenous reserve on the date of its creation. Currently, fourteen tribes live on the reserve surviving with natural resources and extracting from the river most of what they need for food and water.
The Brazilian government is planning the Belo Monte Dam, which would be the world's third-largest hydroelectric dam, on the Lower Xingu. Construction of this dam is under legal challenge by environment and indigenous groups, who assert the dam would have negative environmental and social impacts along with reducing the flow by up to 80% along a [tpl]Convert|100|km|mi[/tpl] stretch known as the "Big Bend" (Volta Grande).[tpl]cite web|title=Summary and History of the Belo Monte Dam: Rainforest Foundation|url=http://www.rainforestfoundationuk.org/files/Belo%20Monte%20Factsheet.pdf|publisher=Summary and History of the Belo Monte Dam: Rainforest Foundation|accessdate=9 March 2011[/tpl] More than 450 fish species have been documented in the Xingu River Basin and it is estimated that the total is around 600 fish species, including many endemics;Camargo, M., T.

In the Upper Xingu region was a highly self-organized pre-Columbian anthropogenic landscape, including deposits of fertile agricultural terra preta, black soil in Portuguese, with a network of roads and polities each of which covered about 250 square kilometers.[tpl]cite journal|last=Heckenberger|first=Michael J.|coauthors=J.
