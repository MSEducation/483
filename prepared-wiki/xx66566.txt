[[Major League Soccer All-Star Game]]

CATEGORIES: All-star games, Major League Soccer, MLS All-Star Game

The Major League Soccer All-Star Game is an annual soccer game held by Major League Soccer featuring select players from the league against an international club. MLS initially adopted a traditional all-star game format used by other North American sports leagues where the Eastern Conference squared off against the Western Conference. This eventually evolved into the current system where the league annually invites a club from abroad to play against a league all-star team. The MLS All-Stars hold a 6–4 record in the competition marking the season's midpoint. Players are awarded rosters spots through a combination of fan voting and selections by the appointed manager and league commissioner.

==Background==

Major League Soccer's first all-star game was played at Giants Stadium in the summer of 1996. The game, using the traditional East–West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs, was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA world all-stars.
The matchup between divisions, as first pioneered by Major League Baseball's All-Star Game, would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats. The 1998 All-Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad. The 2002 game, the first to use a league-wide all-star team, is the only game to feature a national team opponent. Since then every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league. The MLS All-Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009.
