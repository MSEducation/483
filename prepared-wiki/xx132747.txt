Working Wonders Children's Museum was a much loved small children's museum in the downtown Old Mill district of Bend, Oregon, United States
The tagline of the museum was Explore. Discover. Imagine. Create. Connect.
The museum closed on October 3rd, 2009 due to the poor economic conditions in Central Oregon which caused difficulty in fundraising efforts for the museum.  There is some hope it will reopen when economic conditions improve.
