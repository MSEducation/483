[[Attainder]]

CATEGORIES: Public law, Legal history of England, English legal terms

In English criminal law, attainder or attinctura was the metaphorical "stain" or "corruption of blood" which arose from being condemned for a serious capital crime (felony or treason). It entailed losing not only one's property and hereditary titles, but typically also the right to pass them on to one's heirs. Both men and women condemned of capital crimes could be attainted.
Attainder by confession resulted from a guilty plea at the bar before judges or before the coroner in sanctuary. Attainder by verdict resulted from conviction by a jury. Attainder by process resulted from a legislative act outlawing a fugitive. The latter form is obsolete in England (and prohibited in the United States), and the other forms have been abolished. 

==Attainders of British aristocracy in the Middle Ages and Renaissance==

Medieval and Renaissance English kings and queens used acts of attainder to deprive nobles of their lands and often their lives. Once attainted, the descendants of the noble could no longer inherit his lands or income. Attainder essentially amounted to the legal death of the attainted's family.[tpl]cite web|author=J. R.

Kings typically used attainders against political enemies and those who posed potential threats to the king's position and security. The attainder eliminated any advantage the noble would have in a court of law; nobles were exempt from many of the techniques used to try commoners, including torture.  Likewise, in many cases of attainder, the king could coerce the parliament into approving the attainder and there would be a lower or non-existent burden of proof (evidence) than there would be in court.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/attainder.htm |title=Attainder, Being Attainted, Attainder Reversed - Luminarium Encyclopedia |publisher=Luminarium.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27[/tpl]
Prior to the Tudors, most rulers reversed their attainders in return for promises of loyalty. For example, Henry VI reversed all 21 attainders, Edward IV 86 of 120, and Richard III 99 of 100.[tpl]cite web|url=http://history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/123%20202%20HVII%20policy.htm |title=Domestic and foreign policy of Henry VII |publisher=History.wisc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27[/tpl] However, this changed with Henry VII, as described below.
Regnants who used attainder include:
Once attainted, nobles were considered commoners, and as such, could be subjected to the same treatments, including torture and methods of execution. For example, commoners could be burned at the stake, whereas nobles could not.
Often, nobles would refer to the act of being attainted (and then executed) as the person's "destruction."

==Passage in Parliament==

In the Westminster system, a bill of attainder is a bill passed by Parliament attainting persons condemned for high treason, or, in rare cases, a lesser crime. Notably, a person thus attainted need not have been convicted of treason in a court of law. Consequently, attainder has historically been used for political purposes against people whose guilt would have been difficult to prove, or indeed who were entirely innocent. Bills of attainder are also available to condemn criminals who cannot be brought to justice.  A rumour circulated that a bill of attainder against Thomas Jefferson occurred in 1774 because of his authorship of A Summary View of the Rights of British America.Jon Meacham, Thomas Jefferson The Art of Power 
A bill of attainder was last passed in Britain in 1798. Attainders by confession, verdict and process were abolished in the United Kingdom by the Forfeiture Act 1870 (33 & 34 Vict., c.23).
Section 9 of Article One of the United States Constitution provides that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed by Congress.U.S. Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 9, ¶ 3. The following section forbids states from passing them.U.S. Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 10, ¶ 1.

==Corruption of blood==

Corruption of blood is one of the consequences of attainder. The descendants of an attainted person could not inherit either from the attainted criminal (whose property had been forfeited on conviction) or from their other relatives through the criminal. For example, if a person is executed for a crime leaving innocent children, the property of the criminal is forfeited to the crown and will not pass to the children. If the criminal's innocent father subsequently dies, his property cannot be inherited by the criminal's children either: it will be distributed among other family members.[tpl]cn|date = January 2014[/tpl]
The United States Constitution prohibits corruption of blood as a punishment for treason.U.S. Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 3, ¶ 2.  Likewise, in England and Wales corruption of blood has been abolished.
