[[Telecommunications in Macau]]

CATEGORIES: Communications in Macau

Owing to Macau's population (circa 500,000) and its small market, only a few options are available for the local people on media. With the fact that radio signals, newspapers and magazines from Hong Kong are available in Macau, the local media are always a minority group in terms of sales and number of viewers.

==Newspapers==

There are seventeen newspapers (twelve in Chinese, four in Portuguese and two in English). Aomen Ribao (or Ou Mun Iat Pou, Macau Daily News) is reportedly owned by the Communist Party of China and has the largest circulation (40,00). Additionally, Chinese-language newspapers from Hong Kong are popular.
Macau has eight Chinese-language, three Portuguese-language and two English-language daily. The Macau Daily Times is Macau's only English-language newspaper edited seven days a week. Macau Post Daily is published from Monday to Friday. It is owned by a local publishing company, Everbright Co. Ltd., which is locally owned.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abyznewslinks.com/macau.htm|title=Macau Newspapers and News Media Guide|accessdate = 2007-02-06|publisher=ABYZ News Links[/tpl]
