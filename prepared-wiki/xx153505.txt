CATEGORIES: Localities of Bogotá

Santa Fe is the third locality of Bogotá, Capital District of Colombia. Santa Fe is the traditional downtown of the city of Bogotá. This area once comprised Bogotá's total main urban area and was known as "Santa Fe de Bogotá" with its traditional neighbourhoods.
Santa Fe is one of Bogotá's most developed areas and includes the area by the Carrera Septima, one of the main arteries with most of Bogotá's skyscrapers. The International Center and the financial district of the Avenida Jimenez are also located within Santa Fe. It also contains the colonial-era commercial neighbourhood of San Victorino.
The main streets of Bogotá intersect in Santa Fe: the "Carrera Septima" (7th Avenue) formerly known as Calle Real (Royal Street), the "Carrera Decima" (10th Avenue), "Calle 26" (26th Street), the "Circunvalar Avenue", "Caracas Avenue", "Ciudad de Lima Avenue" and "Jimenez Avenue".
Santa Fe also has a rural area which covers the mountains of Monserrate and Guadalupe. The locality of La Candelaria was the foundation site of Bogotá and is enclaved in the middle of Santa Fe. La Candelaria was separated from Santa Fe after the creation of the Capital District.

==History==

Bogotá was founded by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada in 1538 under the name of Santa Fe. The legal foundation occurred at the Bolívar Square in La Candelaria between the rivers of San Francisco (now Jimenez avenue) and San Agustin (now 6th Street).
During the early years of the 20th century, the city was confined within the present territory of Santa Fe until the 1920s when urbanization expanded towards Chapinero and later towards the west in the 1950s just before the violent days of El Bogotazo that partially destroyed the streets.
Santa Fe got a minor city hall in 1972. With the Constitutional reform of 1991, Santa Fe legally became a locality (or a Local Action Junta) of the Capital District.
