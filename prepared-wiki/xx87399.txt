==About Galileo==

==Schedule==

Galileo has two regular hour schedules with 5-minute passing period (Monday, Tuesdays, and Fridays at 3:05PM), two early-leave days with 5-minute passing period (Wednesdays and Thursdays at 2:10PM, staff until 3:05PM), and two block period days with homeroom and 5-minute passing periods (Wednesdays with 1st, 3rd, and 5th periods; Thursday with 2nd, 4th, and 6th periods and dismiss at 2:10PM).

==History==

On December 10, 1920, Major Joseph P. Nourse, who had been actively engaged in educational work in the city for many years, became the first principal of Galileo High School. Throughout the summer, carpenters were busy converting the Red Cross Building, located on Fulton Street near the Civic Center. On August 1, 1921, Galileo High School welcomed its student body into the remodeled facilities. The ceremony of "breaking ground" for the new building was on November 4, 1921, and the dedication of the Van Ness Building on March 30, 1924. At the same time, plans were underway for a new wing which would double the school's capacity.
In the 1920s, the Galileo High School building was considered an outstanding example of modern architecture. Planned with the intention of housing one of the best educational institutions in the country, it was equipped to offer the highest type of academic curriculum in addition to training in commercial and technical branches.
During the 1970s, Galileo went through an extensive refit where most, if not all, student facilities were moved across the street onto Fort Mason. Before this, there were rumors that the Galileo campus would be permanently moved onto the Fort Mason site. Though the student population, then, did not indicate whether the move and larger facilities would be justified, the land that Galileo sits on was quite valuable, which could have made the move plausible.
Since the 1995-96 school year, Galileo has transformed itself to the Galileo Academy of Science and Technology. The new program provides students with career pathways and academies. These include the Galileo Health Academy, the Academy of Information Technology (AoIT), Biotechnology Pathway and the Environmental Science Pathway. In 2006-2007, the Publications Pathway was introduced and, in 2007-2008, the Academy of Hospitality and Tourism (AoHT) and Digital Photography Pathway. 
On September 25, 2007, while some construction workers were digging the courtyard, they found a time capsule which was thought to be lost forever by the Class of 1982."S.F. Galileo High students uncover soggy memories from class of '82" It was uncovered that day, but was filled with water, as well as a yearbook, a frisbee, a Rubik's Cube and a Mighty Lion T-shirt. It was buried shortly after the class of '82 graduated, but, in 1997, a search for the time capsule over every square foot of the courtyard turned up nothing. The time capsule is now stored in one of the closets in the building.
On October 31, 2007, the courtyard partially reopened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony by the ASB officers, followed by a celebration and a contest. The courtyard did not fully open until November, as there was still more maintenance work required.

==Location==

(Aerial View)
Galileo is located in the Marina district with nearby bus stops including the 19, 28, 30, 47, 49, and more.  Less than half of the students reside near the school[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2007[/tpl], but school buses and special 30-Stockton and the 47-Van Ness buses are provided by the district for transportation and the Municipal Railway. The 19-Polk also serves nearby, but has no special runs.

==Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps program==

The Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) battalion at Galileo is an Honor Unit with Distinction, the highest designation a unit may have. Its afterschool teams associated with JROTC are very competitive, often highly placed in the annual fall and spring competitions. Fall teams consist of the Guidon, Squad Drill, Color Guard and Drill Platoon while Spring teams include Drum Corps, Silent Drill Team (SDT) and Exhibition Drill Team(GDT). Other competitions occur during the last week of school at Camp Parks. This consists of cadet challenge and various other sporting events.

==American football==

Largely due to the fame of the former football player and actor O.J. Simpson, Galileo was well known for its American football team. Galileo's arch enemy is reputed to be the Eagles of George Washington High School, though the Cardinals of Lowell High School have been a rising challenge.
The football field that dominates the second block of Galileo was formerly named in honor of O.J. Simpson. However, after Simpson's trial for murder in 1995, the football field was renamed George White Field. The two twin apartment buildings that face the northern side of the football field are the Fontana buildings. The design of the twin buildings was actually built to echo and magnify the sounds of the football games.
Galileo's football team has been undefeated three times in the school's history. In 1988, the Lions defeated McAteer High School becoming the first football team in San Francisco history to go 12 - 0. The second undefeated season was in 1990 and the third was in 2002 when the Lions defeated the Washington Eagles.
From the end of the 2006 season through the first game of the 2009 season, Galileo had an 18-game losing streak, going winless in both 2007 (0-7) and 2008 (0-9). After losing the first game of the 2009 season, the Lions won 9 out of their final 11 games, punctuated by a 35-0 win over the Lincoln High School Mustangs in the San Francisco AAA Turkey Bowl, capturing their 16th city championship. Lincoln had won 4 consecutive AAA championships in a row prior to the 2009 season from 2005-2008. It was Galileo's 16th San Francisco AAA championship overall. 
Four years later in 2013, the Lions (led by quarterback Kyle Nelson and running back Ronzel Fox) prevailed once again over the Lincoln High Mustangs in the AAA-Turkey Bowl by a score of 34-30. It was Galileo's record 17th city championship.

==Reputation==

Galileo previously had a bad reputation for low test scores and criminal events occurring in school, but in more recent years it has become one of the most improved schools in San Francisco (see Academic Performance Index below). Since the installation of surveillance cameras in 2005, criminal acts at Galileo have declined as a serious issue. Math scores remain one of Galileo's best academic strengths.
In 2008, Gerald Courtney, the Assistant Principal at the time, was charged in a prostitution ring. Courtney was accused of helping operate two brothels in San Jose. No minors, school officials or students from the San Francisco Unified School District were involved in the operation, police said. Police also believe Courtney posted advertisements for the prostitution business on online forums. http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/assistant-principal-charged-in-prostitution-ring-delays-plea/Content?oid=2144208
In the 1960s, O.J. Simpson, a retired American football star and actor, played for the school football team, the Galileo Lions, before graduating from the school. In 1994, when Simpson was accused of a murder, the school changed the football field's name from O.J. Simpson Field to George White Field.
