[[Outline of critical theory]]

CATEGORIES: Philosophy-related lists, Outlines, Critical theory

The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to critical theory:
Critical theory â€“ examination and critique of society and culture, drawing from knowledge across the social sciences and humanities. The term has two different meanings with different origins and histories: one originating in sociology and the other in literary criticism. This has led to the very literal use of 'critical theory' as an umbrella term to describe any theory founded upon critique.
