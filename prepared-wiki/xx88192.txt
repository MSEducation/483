CATEGORIES: Tourist railway stations in Melbourne

Menzies Creek Station was opened with the line on 18 December 1900. It was named after an early settler Mr. John Menzies. On 5 December 1904 it was renamed Aura, after the estate of the Shire President. The station reverted to its previous name on 4 July 1947. Throughout this period, the Post Office kept the name of the town as Menzies Creek which it remains to this day.
When the station was operating under the V.R. it had a loop siding, a standard portable station building, and a goods shed.
These days, Menzies Creek has an island crossing platform with a track on each side, a loop siding and also a siding into the museum.  The station now is home to the "Aura Tearooms", the Puffing Billy Narrow Gauge Museum (currently closed), and also boasts a Signal bay containing a 14-lever interlocking frame.
