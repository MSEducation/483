[[Flag of Liberia]]

CATEGORIES: Flags of Africa, National symbols of Liberia, Liberiaâ€“United States relations

The Liberian flag bears close resemblance to the flag of the United States, showing the ex-American slave origins of the country.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fcnl.org/issues/item.php?item_id=731&issue_id=75|title=Background on conflict in Liberia Paul Cuffee advocated settling freed slaves in Africa. He gained support from free black leaders in the U.S., and members of Congress for an early emigration plan. From 1815-1816, he financed and captained a successful voyage to British-ruled Sierra Leone where he helped a small group of African-American immigrants establish themselves. Cuffee believed that African Americans could more easily "rise to be a people" in Africa than in the U.S. where slavery and legislated limits on black freedom were still in place. Although Cuffee died in 1817, his early efforts to help repatriate African Americans encouraged the American Colonization Society (ACS) to lead further settlements. The ACS was made up mostly of Quakers and slaveholders, who disagreed on the issue of slavery but found common ground in support of repatriation. Friends opposed slavery but believed blacks would face better chances for freedom in Africa than in the U.S. The slaveholders opposed freedom for blacks, but saw repatriation as a way of avoiding rebellions[/tpl] The Liberian flag has similar red and white stripes, as well as a blue square with a white star in the canton.  It was adopted on Friday, April 26, 1847.http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/flags/countrys/africa/liberia.htm

==Symbolism==

The eleven stripes symbolize the signatories of the Liberian Declaration of Independence, red and white symbolizing courage and moral excellence. The white star represents the freedom the ex-slaves were given, above the blue square representing the African mainland.
The flag is seen on many ships around the world as Liberia offers registration under its flag. Shipping companies do this to avoid taxes and restrictions that other countries enforce. As the second most popular flag of convenience (after Panama), it is estimated that 1700 foreign-owned ships fly the Liberian flag.http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3072983/t/liberian-shipping-draws-scrutiny/ This brings in much of the country's revenue.http://www.worldflags101.com/l/liberia-flag.aspx

==County flags==

Liberia is subdivided into 15 counties, each of which are entitled to their own flag. Each county flag bears the national flag of Liberia in the canton. The county flags are flown at regional offices and together encircling the national flag of Liberia at the Presidential Palace.
