"(Love Is) Thicker Than Water" is a song recorded by Andy Gibb in 1978. It was his second single that topped the US Billboard Hot 100. It was written by his brother Barry Gibb with Andy himself. The B-side of this song was "Words and Music" in the US, but "Flowing Rivers" in the UK.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/77.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1977 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |accessdate=14 June 2013[/tpl]

==Recording and release==

"(Love Is) Thicker than Water" was recorded in October 1976 at the Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, during the same time as "I Just Want to Be Your Everything".  On the two tracks, Joe Walsh of Eagles played guitar.  Although Andy said the composition was almost entirely Barryâ€™s work, some say it does sound a little closer to Andy's style.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/76.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1976 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |accessdate=14 June 2013[/tpl]  The song was certified Gold in the United States on 16 February 1978.
As evidence of the Gibb brothers' US chart domination in 1978, atop the 4 March 1978 Hot 100 the Bee Gees' "Stayin' Alive" was displaced by this song,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/andy-gibb-p13045/charts-awards/billboard-singles|title=Andy Gibb's Billboard singles history|publisher=Rovi Corporation / Billboard |accessdate=2011-12-16[/tpl] which in turn was displaced two weeks later by the Bee Gees' "Night Fever", which in turn was displaced eight weeks later by Yvonne Elliman's "If I Can't Have You".  Since Barry Gibb had a hand in writing all four of these songs, he became the only person in history to write four consecutive US number-one singles, a feat unmatched to this day.  The song was released in February 1978 in Netherlands.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Andy-Gibb-Love-Is-Thicker-Than-Water/release/2766606 |title=Andy Gibb - (Love Is) Thicker than Water |publisher=Discogs |accessdate=14 June 2013[/tpl]
