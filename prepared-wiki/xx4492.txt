Hops are the female  flowers (also called seed cones or strobiles) of the hop plant, Humulus lupulus.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lib.umn.edu/botanical/plant.php |title=University of Minnesota Libraries: The Transfer of Knowledge. Hops-Humulus lupulus |publisher=Lib.umn.edu |date=2008-05-13 |accessdate=2012-05-20[/tpl] They are used primarily as a flavoring and stability agent in beer, to which they impart a bitter, tangy flavor, though hops are also used for various purposes in other beverages and herbal medicine.
In the Middle Ages beers tended to be of a very low alcohol content (small beer) and were commonly consumed as a safer alternative to untreated water. Each village tended to have one or more small breweries with a barley field and a hop garden in close vicinity[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl].  Early documents include mention of a hop garden in the will of Charlemagne's father, Pepin III. However, the first documented use of hops in beer as a flavoring agent is from the 11th century[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl].  Before this period, brewers used a wide variety of bitter herbs and flowers, including dandelion, burdock root, marigold, horehound (the German name for horehound means "mountain hops"), ground ivy, and heather.[tpl]cite web|url=http://jongriffin.com/articles/understanding-beer/ |title=Understanding Beer - A Broad Overview of Brewing, Tasting and Analyzing Beer - October 12th, 2006, Beer & Brewing, The Brewing Process |publisher=Jongriffin.com |accessdate=2012-05-20[/tpl]
Hops are used extensively in brewing for their antibacterial effect that favors the activity of brewer's yeast over less desirable microorganisms and for many purported benefits, including balancing the sweetness of the malt with bitterness, contributing a variety of desirable flavors and aromas[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]. Historically, traditional herb combinations for beers were believed to have been abandoned when beers made with hops were noticed to be less prone to spoilage.[tpl]cite book|author1=F. G. Priest|author2=Iain Campbell|title=Brewing microbiology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jafz6LhdUbEC|year=2003|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-47288-6|pages=5[/tpl]
The hop plant is a vigorous, climbing, herbaceous perennial, usually trained to grow up strings in a field called a hopfield, hop garden (nomenclature in the South of England), or hop yard (in the West Country and U.S.) when grown commercially. Many different varieties of hops are grown by farmers around the world, with different types being used for particular styles of beer.

==History==

The first documented hop cultivation was in 736, in the Hallertau region of present-day Germany, although the first mention of the use of hops in brewing in that country was 1079.
However in a will of Pepin the Short, the father of Charlemagne, 768 hop gardens were left to the Cloister of Saint-Denis. Not until the 13th century did hops begin to start threatening the use of gruit for flavoring. Gruit was used when taxes were levied by the nobility on hops. Whichever was taxed made the brewer then quickly switch to the other.  In Britain, hopped beer was first imported from Holland around 1400, yet hops were condemned in 1519 as a "wicked and pernicious weed". In 1471, Norwich, England, banned use of the plant in the brewing of ale ("beer" was the name for fermented malt liquors bittered with hops; only in recent times are the words often used as synonyms).
Hops were imported from France, Holland and Germany and naturally import duty was raised on those; it was not until 1524 that hops were first grown in the southeast of England (Kent) when they were introduced as an agricultural crop by Dutch farmers. Therefore, in the hop industry there were many words which originally were Dutch words, such as oast house, which is derived from the Dutch word eest huis which means "drying house"; scuppet, a large wooden spade used on the hop floor to turn the hops into the hanging pocket or bale, which is derived from the Dutch word schop.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] Hops were then grown as far north as Aberdeen near breweries for infrastructure convenience. It was another century before hop cultivation began in the present-day United States, in 1629 by English and Dutch farmers.

==World production==

Hops production is concentrated in moist temperate climates, with much of the world's production occurring near the 48th parallel north.  Hop plants prefer the same soils as potatoes. The leading potato-growing states in the United States are also major hops-producing areas.http://peicanada.com/island_farmer/publication/hops_industry_has_great_potential_atlantic_canada  However, not all potato-growing areas can produce good hops naturally. Soils in the Maritime Provinces of Canada lack the boron that hops prefer, for example. Historically, hops were not grown in Ireland, but were imported from England. In 1752 more than 500 tons of English hops were imported through Dublin alone."The London magazine, 1752", page 332
Important production centers today are the Hallertau in Germany which, in 2006, had more hop-growing area than any other country on Earth,Summary of Reports: Nürnberg, Germany, 14 November 2006, INTERNATIONAL HOP GROWERS’ CONVENTION: Economic Committee the Yakima (Washington) and Willamette (Oregon) valleys, and western Canyon County, Idaho (including the communities of Parma, Wilder, Greenleaf, and Notus).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/cor/humulus/huminfo.html#use |title=NCGR-Corvallis Humulus Genetic Resources |publisher=Ars-grin.gov |accessdate=2012-05-20[/tpl] The principal production centers in the UK are in Kent which produces Kent Goldings hops, Herefordshire and Worcestershire.Norman Moss, A Fancy to Worcesters, Agricultural research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smr.herefordshire.gov.uk/agriculture%20_industry/hops_history.htm |title=Herefordshire Through Time - Welcome |publisher=Smr.herefordshire.gov.uk |accessdate=2012-05-24[/tpl] Essentially all of the harvested hops are used in beer making.

===Cultivation and harvest===

Although hops are grown in most of the continental U.S. states and Canadian Provinces,[tpl]cite web|title=Humulus lupulus L. common hop|url=http://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=HULU|work=USDA Plants database|accessdate=2013-09-13[/tpl] cultivation of hops for commercial production requires a particular environment. As hops are a climbing plant, they are trained to grow up trellises made from strings or wires that support the plants and allow them significantly greater growth with the same sunlight profile. Energy that would have been required to build structural cells is also freed for crop growth.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl]
Male and female flowers of the hop plant usually develop on separate plants (that is, the plant is dioecious), although fertile monoecious individuals appear occasionally. Because viable seeds are undesirable for brewing beer, only female plants are grown in hop fields, thus preventing pollination. Female plants are propagated vegetatively, and male plants are culled, if plants are grown from seeds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.agroatlas.ru/cultural/Humulus_lupulus_K_en.htm |title=Interactive Agricultural Ecological Atlas of Russia and Neighboring Countries. Economic Plants and their Diseases, Pests and Weeds. Humulus lupulus |publisher=Agroatlas.ru |accessdate=2012-05-20[/tpl]  The flowers from the female plants are used to flavor beer.
Hop plants are planted in rows about six to eight feet apart. Each spring the roots send forth new bines. that are started up strings from the ground to an overhead trellis. The cones grow high on the bine, and in the past, these cones were picked by hand. Harvesting of hops became much more efficient with the invention of the mechanical hops separator, patented by Emil Horst in 1909.
Harvest comes near the end of summer when the bines are pulled down and the flowers are taken to a hop house or oast house for drying. Hop houses are two-story buildings, of which the upper story has a slatted floor covered with burlap. Here the flowers are poured out and raked even. A heating unit on the lower floor is used to dry the hops. When dry, the hops are moved to a press, a sturdy box with a plunger. Two long pieces of burlap are laid into the hop press at right angles, the hops are poured in and compressed into bales.
Hop cones contain different oils, such as lupulin, a yellowish, waxy substance, an oleoresin, that imparts flavor and aroma to beer.[tpl]cite web|last=Andrew|first=Sewalish|title=Hops: Anatomy and Chemistry 101|url=http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/s2009/sewalish_andr/Humulus%20Lupulus%20-%20Common%20Hops/Hop%20Anatomy%20and%20Chemistry%20101.html|accessdate=2013-09-13[/tpl] Lupulin contains lupulone and humulone, which possess antibiotic properties, suppressing bacterial growth favoring brewer's yeast to grow. After lupulin has been extracted in the brewing process the papery cones are discarded.

===Emil Clemens Horst===

E. Clemens Horst (18 March 1867 – 24 May 1940) was a major figure in the cultivation, harvest and sale of hops. He emigrated to the U.S. as a child in 1874 from Tuttlingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. In the mid 1880s he purchased a small plot of land just east of Daniel P. Durst, the first Bear River hop grower, as site of his first hop farm. He soon bought out two other hop growers, Hugh Roddan and Joseph M.C.Jasper. He married in 1898, and moved to San Francisco in 1902. By 1904 he was supplying Oregon hops to the Guinness Brewery in Ireland. By 1912, Horst owned the largest number of acres of hops under cultivation in the world with offices in Chicago, New York and London. http://www.sacramentohistory.org/films_hopfarm.html Horst Company was headquartered at 150 Pine Street, San Francisco, California.http://irishancestryresearch.com/doc/Horst_ancestry_report.pdf[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elkgrovehistoricalsociety.com/images-of-our-past/|title=Images of Our Past |publisher=Elkgrovehistoricalsociety.com |date=1940-05-24 |accessdate=2013-12-28[/tpl] Prior to World War II, Horst Company was the only exporter of hops to Germany.
The cultivation of hops requires rich flood plains. One of Horst’s oldest and most productive hop ranches was the site of Campus Commons in Sacramento along the American River. Another nearby ranch of Horst's was based in Horstville, a company town nearby Wheatland, California in the Bear River flood plain. It has rich loamy soil, that geologists even named after Horst, like Horst Sandy Loam and Horst Silt Loam.Lytle 1998:68-69. in http://www.wheatland.ca.gov/userfiles/file/Appendix%20N.pdf p2. 
Horstville consisted of a post office, dining hall, company store and a tent city for seasonal workers. In 1886, labor shortages and threats of a strike by white workers had become serious; hop growers founded the California Hop Growers’ Association, and hired Chinese workers. By 1898 Horst had become so big that ten hop drying kilns ran daily.Pacific Rural Press, 3 September 1898 in http://www.wheatland.ca.gov/userfiles/file/Appendix%20N.pdf p.29 Simultaneously hop labor camp conditions had become "unspeakably bad throughout the state and the pay was equally abysmal" so that by 1899 the Horst Brothers ranch's 300 white and a number of Japanese employees quit and went on strike for more pay. To recruit workers Horst launched advertising campaigns not only by making false promises but advertised for at least twice as many workers than they actually needed, with the goal to play one group off against the other, as he admitted before the U.S. Immigration Commission Street, R.S. Beasts of the Field: A Narrative History of California Farmworkers, 2004, 1769-1913. Stanford University Press. in http://www.wheatland.ca.gov/userfiles/file/Appendix%20N.pdf p.16  Hop production peaked between 1912 and 1916 and plummeted thereafter. On 3 August 1913 the Durst Ranch became the site of the Wheatland Hop Riot. Until 2009, when Google released a digitized version of the 1916 Commission on Industrial Relations, the Horstville ranch was often confused with the neighboring Durst Ranch. 
Horst revolutionized the processing of hops with the invention of his mechanical hop separator, patented 1909 in Elk Grove, California. It picked the hops while discarding the bine and leaves. It produced 25 bales of hops in one day, while an experienced worker picked just two bales in a week, allowing him to bypass the hassles of hiring seasonal labor. Horst continuously invented new hop related machinery (1884-1924) holding at least 14 patents. http://www.wheatland.ca.gov/userfiles/file/Appendix%20N.pdf p.15 The harvesting process was further developed in 1939 (US Patent #2139046) [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2139046.html |title=Hop separator - Edouard, Thys |publisher=Freepatentsonline.com |date=1938-12-06 |accessdate=2013-10-10[/tpl] by his son-in-law, Edouard Thys, founder of Thys Company which, among other industrial parts, manufactured the parts for the portable hop picking machine.
A film produced between 1900 and 1910 entitled Horst Hop Ranch, depicts the processing of hops and their shipment to market.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sacramentohistory.org/filmMedia/hopsFilmBox.html |title=Hops Film |publisher=Sacramentohistory.org |accessdate=2013-10-10[/tpl]  The 35mm nitrate film was housed in a Thomas A. Edison film can that initially suggested that this was one of the earliest commercial films in California. Careful examination has revealed that the film is a reversal copy and that there are three distinct sections to the film. The first part is the hop separator in operation on the "Campus Commons" ranch. The second section shows scenes in hop fields at Hopland, California or in Oregon. The third section depicts weighing and transportation of bales of hops by the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company probably near Portland, Oregon.

===Migrant labor and social impact===

The need for massed labor at harvest time meant hop-growing had a big social impact. Around the world, the labor-intensive harvesting work involved large numbers of migrant workers who would travel for the annual hop harvest. Whole families would partake and live in hoppers' huts, with even the smallest children helping in the fields.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~hunny.pot/homepage/hopping.html |title=Connie's Homepage - Hop Picking in Kent |publisher=Btinternet.com |accessdate=2012-05-20|archiveurl=http://archive.is/NYFw|archivedate=2012-07-21[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://theorwellprize.co.uk/george-orwell/by-orwell/essays-and-other-works/hop-picking/ |title=George Orwell: Hop-picking |publisher=Theorwellprize.co.uk |accessdate=2012-05-20[/tpl] The final chapters of W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage contain a vivid description of London families participating in this annual hops harvest.  In England, many of those picking hops in Kent were from eastern areas of London. This provided a break from urban conditions that was spent in the countryside. People also came from Birmingham and other Midlands cities to pick hops in the Malvern area of Worcestershire. Some photographs have been preserved.Smith, Keith. Around Malvern in old photographs.. Alan Sutton Publishing, Gloucester. ISBN 0-86299-587-6.
Particularly in Kent, because of a shortage of small-denomination coin of the realm, many growers issued their own currency to those doing the labor. In some cases, the coins issued were adorned with fanciful hops images, making them quite beautiful.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/opac/search/cataloguedetail.html?&priref=94347&_function_=xslt&_limit_=10#1 |title=Charles Levett Hop Tokens, 60 Bushels Denomination, The Fitzwilliam Museum, fitzmuseum.cam.ack.uk |publisher=Fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk |accessdate=2012-05-20[/tpl]
In the US, Prohibition had a major impact on hops productions, but remnants of this significant industry in West and Northwest are still noticeable in the form of old hop kilns that survive throughout Sonoma County, among others. Florian Dauenhauer of Santa Rosa in Sonoma County, became a manufacturer of hop-harvesting machines in 1940, in part because of the hop industry's importance to the county. Ironically, this mechanization helped destroy the local industry by enabling large-scale mechanized production, which moved to larger farms in other areas.[ref]
</ref> [http://www.dmfg.com Dauenhauer Manufacturing] remains a current producer of hop harvesting machines.

==Brewing==

Hops are usually dried in an oast house before they are used in the brewing process. 
Undried or "wet" hops are sometimes (since ca.1990) used.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_10422358 | work=Denver Post | first=Elizabeth | last=Aguilera | title=Hop harvest yields hip beer for brewer | date=10 September 2008[/tpl]Underwood, Kristin. It's Harvest Time at the Sierra Nevada Brewery. Treehugger. 6 August 2009. Retrieved 20 March 2011.
The wort (sugar-rich liquid produced from malt) is boiled with hops before it is cooled down and yeast is added, to start fermentation.
Hop resins are composed of two main acids: alpha and beta acids. Alpha acids have a mild antibiotic/bacteriostatic effect against Gram-positive bacteria, and favor the exclusive activity of brewing yeast in the fermentation of beer. Alpha acids are responsible for the bitter flavor in the beer.
Beta acids do not isomerize during the boil of wort, and have a negligible effect on beer taste. Instead, they contribute to beer's aroma, and high beta acid hop varieties are often added at the end of the wort boil for aroma. Beta acids may oxidize into compounds that can give beer off-flavors of rotten vegetables or cooked corn.
The effect of hops on the finished beer varies by type and use, though there are two main hop types: bittering and aroma. Bittering hops have higher concentrations of alpha acids, and are responsible for the large majority of the bitter flavor of a beer. European (so-called "noble") hops typically average 5–9% alpha acids by weight (AABW), and the newer American cultivars typically range from 8–19% AABW. Aroma hops usually have a lower concentration of alpha acids (~5%) and are the primary contributors of hop aroma and (nonbitter) flavor. Bittering hops are boiled for a longer period of time, typically 60–90 minutes, to maximize the isomerization of the alpha acids. They often have inferior aromatic properties, as the aromatic compounds evaporate off during the boil.
The degree of bitterness imparted by hops depends on the degree to which alpha acids (AAs) are isomerized during the boil, and the impact of a given amount of hops is specified in International Bitterness Units (IBUs). Unboiled hops are only mildly bitter. On the other hand, the nonbitter flavor and aroma of hops come from the essential oils, which evaporate during the boil.
Aroma hops are typically added to the wort later to prevent the evaporation of the essential oils, to impart "hop taste" (if during the final 30 minutes of boil) or "hop aroma" (if during the final 10 minutes, or less, of boil). Aroma hops are often added after the wort has cooled and while the beer ferments, a technique known as "dry hopping", which contributes to the hop aroma. The three major components of the essential oil of hops are myrcene, humulene, and caryophyllene, which comprise about 60–80% of the oil for most hop varieties. Farnesene is a major component in some hops. The composition of hop essential oils can differ a lot between varieties and between years in the same variety. About 250 components of essential oils have been identified. 22 of these are known to have significant influence on the flavor and aroma.
Today, a substantial amount of "dual-use" hops are used, as well. These have high concentrations of alpha acids and good aromatic properties. These can be added to the boil at any time, depending on the desired effect.
Flavors and aromas are described appreciatively using terms which include "grassy", "floral", "citrus", "spicy", "piney", "lemony", "grapefruit", and "earthy".[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2009[/tpl] Many pale lagers have fairly low hop influence, while lagers marketed as Pilsener or brewed in the Czech Republic may have noticeable noble hop aroma. Certain ales (particularly the highly-hopped style known as India Pale Ale, or IPA) can have high levels of hop bitterness.
Brewers may use software tools to control the bittering levels in the boil and adjust recipes to account for a change in the hop bill or seasonal variations in the crop that may lead to the need to compensate for a difference in alpha acid contribution. Data may be shared with other brewers via BeerXML allowing the reproduction of a recipe allowing for differences in hop availability.

==Hop varieties==

Wye College which was established as an agricultural college in Wye, Kent in 1894 as part of London University has had a very significant effect on the breeding of hop varieties in the early 19th century in the U.K. but since then in the rest of the world as well. Prof. E.F. Salmon was the first breeder of new hop varieties in the world and started there in 1906. He bred in 1919 two significant varieties Brewers Gold and Bullion from which many newer varieties have been cultivated not only in the U.K. hop breeding stations but all over the world. In 1934 he bred the variety Northern Brewer specifically for Scottish & Newcastle Breweries, situated in the North of England, hence is name was given Northern Brewer. Many breeding stations throughout the world have used this variety in their breeding program since then.
The second significance of Wye College breeding of hops was in the seventies by Dr. Ray A. Neve, first with the new varieties Wye Target, Wye Challenger, Wye Northdown, Wye Saxon, Wye Yeoman and secondly by the breeding of the first world dwarf hop varieties, which are far more economic to grow for the Hop farmers, was carried out by Dr. Ray Neve. Wye College have also been responsible for breeding hop varieties that will grow with only 12 hours of daily light for the South African hop farmers. Wye College was closed in 2009 but the legacy of their hop breeding programs, particularly that of the dwarf varieties, is continuing as already the U.S.A. private and public breeding programs are using their stock material.
Particular hop varieties are associated with beer regions and styles, for example pale lagers are usually brewed with European (often German, Polish or Czech) noble hop varieties such as Saaz, Hallertau and Strissel Spalt. British ales use hop varieties such as Fuggles, Goldings and W.G.V. North American beers often use Cascade hops, Columbus hops, Centennial hops, Willamette, Amarillo hops and about forty more varieties as the U.S.A. have lately been the more significant breeders of new hop varieties, including dwarf hop varieties.

===Noble hops===

The term "noble hops" traditionally refers to varieties of hops which are low in bitterness and high in aroma. They are the European cultivars or races Hallertau, Tettnanger, Spalt, and Saaz.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.czhops.cz/index.php/en |title=Hop growers union of the Czech Republic |publisher=Czhops.cz |accessdate=2012-05-20[/tpl] They are not bred as "modern" hop varieties but they are wild hops found and named for a specific region or city in which they were first found or by the farmer which found them or first propagated them. They contain high amounts of the hop oil humulene and low amounts of alpha acids cohumulone and adhumulone, as well as lower amounts of the harsher-tasting beta acids lupulone, colupulone, and adlupulone.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
Their low relative bitterness but strong aroma are often distinguishing characteristics of European-style lager beer, such as Pilsener, Dunkel, and Oktoberfest/Märzen. In beer, they are considered aroma hops (as opposed to bittering hops); see Pilsner Urquell as a classic example of the Bohemian Pilsener style, which showcases noble hops.
As with grapes, the location where hops is grown affects the hops' characteristics. Much as Dortmunder beer may within the EU be labelled "Dortmunder" only if it has been brewed in Dortmund, noble hops may officially be considered "noble" only if they were grown in the areas for which the hop varieties (races) were named.
English noble varieties are Fuggle, East Kent Goldings and Goldings. They are characterized through analysis as having an alpha:beta ratio of 1:1, low alpha-acid levels (2–5%) with a low cohumulone content, low myrcene in the hop oil, high humulene in the oil, a ratio of humulene:caryophyllene above three, and poor storability resulting in them being more prone to oxidation. In reality, this means they have a relatively consistent bittering potential as they age, due to beta-acid oxidation, and a flavour that improves as they age during periods of poor storage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.byo.com/stories/article/indices/18-brewing-science/853-hop-chemistry-homebrew-science |title=Hop Chemistry: Homebrew Science |publisher=Byo.com |date=2000-04-28 |accessdate=2012-05-20[/tpl]

==Other uses==

===Beverages===

The only major commercial use for hops is in beer, although hops are also an ingredient in Julmust, a carbonated beverage similar to soda that is popular in Sweden during December, as well as Malta, a Latin American soft drink. Hops are sometimes added to some varieties of kvass. They are also used for flavor in some herbal teas.

===Medicinal===

Hops are also used in herbal medicine in a way similar to valerian, as a treatment for anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia.Plants for a Future: Humulus lupulus Plants for a Future.
