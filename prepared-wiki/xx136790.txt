Isvara Puri was a monk who was a disciple of Madhavendra Puri from the Madhva sampradaya. He met Chaitanya at Gaya, India, whereupon Mahaprabhu requested Puri to be his guru. The latter graciously agreed and accepted Mahaprabhu as his disciple several days later, initiating him into the Gopal-mantra.
