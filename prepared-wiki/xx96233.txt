.ee is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) of Estonia, operated by the Estonian Internet Foundation.

==Third-level domain names==

==History==

The top-level domain .ee was introduced in 1992 and was operated by EENet until July 2010. The administrator of .ee domain was the academic Endel Lippmaa. There was a limit of one domain name per legal entity, and registrations of additional names to protect trademarks were specifically denied because "The domain name has no trademark status". As domains under .ee were meant to be an institution's identification on the Internet (like the register code in the commercial register), registration of additional domains in the defense of a trademark or a name form is not possible.EENet registration page (in FAQ) Valid registrations were free of charge.

==Domain relaunch==

The new order of registration of .ee TLD became available on 5 July 2010. Estonian Internet Foundation took over .ee ccTLD registry functions from EENet. All existing domains registered before the transition had to be re-registered during a 6 month transition period which ended on 5 January 2011. New .ee domain rules allow unlimited number of domains to be registered by a single entity. Private persons can now register domains directly under .ee. Foreign entities can now register .ee domains although all domains must have an administrative contact with residence in Estonia. Domain disputes will be handled by Domain Disputes Committee. Registration services can be done through accredited registrars listed on Estonian Internet Foundation website.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eestiinternet.ee/eng/registrars|title=Accredited registrars|publisher=Eesti Interneti Sihtasutus|accessdate=23 August 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100703122906/http://www.eestiinternet.ee/eng/registrars| archivedate= 3 July 2010[/tpl] Domains can be registered and renewed on a yearly basis. Registration fee for registrars is set to 18.2 Euros plus tax.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eestiinternet.ee/|title=Eesti Interneti Sihtasutus|publisher=Eesti Interneti Sihtasutus|language=Estonian|accessdate=14 February 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100212102051/http://www.eestiinternet.ee/| archivedate= 12 February 2010[/tpl]

==Criticism==

The new order of domain registering was met with great controversy. The relaunch of the registry was at one point delayed to be reassessed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.zone.ee/2010/04/13/laheb-kaima-ei-lahe-kaima-laheb-kaima/|title=Läheb käima, ei lähe käima|publisher=ZONE.ee|language=Estonian|accessdate=13 April 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100417235516/http://blog.zone.ee/2010/04/13/laheb-kaima-ei-lahe-kaima-laheb-kaima/| archivedate= 17 April 2010[/tpl] When the relaunch was finalized, the annual fee for a .ee domain was announced to be 285 Estonian kroons (~24 USD) plus tax, which was met with wide criticism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/580038|title=Infoturbe spetsialist: domeenireform on läbikukkunud|publisher=Eesti Päevaleht|language=Estonian|accessdate=13 July 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100714173328/http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/580038| archivedate= 14 July 2010[/tpl] A list of shortcomings was presented in a public notice to Estonian Internet Foundation by Tõnu Samuel and Jaan Jänesmäe, mentioning that the .ee domain had become the most expensive TLD in Europe. Their cause gained over 800 supporters on Facebook.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kogukond.org/in-english/|title=List of EIC's goals|publisher=Estonian Internet Community|accessdate=11 December 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101030081910/http://kogukond.org/in-english/| archivedate= 30 October 2010[/tpl]
The NGO Estonian Internet Community was founded partly as a reaction to the controversial domain reform with 22 founding members. Its board is made up of Tõnu Samuel, Elver Loho and Heiti Kender. Recently it noted on its blog that several of its members had lost faith in the possibility of any sort of compromise and had independently written e-mails to IANA asking them to step in to resolve the controversy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kogukond.org/2010/12/kui-kodus-ei-saa-asju-aetud/|title=Kui kodus ei saa asju aetud...|publisher=Estonian Internet Community|language=Estonian|accessdate=11 December 2010[/tpl]
