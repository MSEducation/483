==Presumed Tollense battle site==

According to reports in the German media, human remains from the Bronze Age have been found in the region named "Tollensetal" (Tollense valley) since 1997.Massacre at the Tollense, Spiegel Online (German) Many showed signs of serious injury and violent death. Starting in 2008, archaeological study of the site narrowed-down to an area of two square kilometers. Hundreds of bone fragments belonging to more than 90 persons, as well as wooden weaponry and flint arrowheads, have been discovered. These findings were possible due to the preservation of the former swamp ground and the fact that the Tollense has never really changed its course. It is now estimated that about 200 people died in a battle-like scenario in the valley about 1250 BC. Since the population density then was about 5 people per square kilometer, this would have been the most significant battle in bronze period Germany yet to be discovered. Plans for a further investigation of the site have been made for the years 2010 to 2015.

Most of the remains appear to be from young men and some of the injuries seem to have occurred immediately before death. The bodies do not appear to have been buried in a normal ceremony and instead were dumped in the river. Horse bones were also found at the site and a fractured thigh bone suggests a fall from a horse.
