Mythunga is a genus of pterodactyloid pterosaur from the late Early Cretaceous of Australia.  It is known from a partial skull found in marine rocks of the Albian-age Toolebuc Formation near Hughenden, Queensland.  Only the snout and part of the jaws are known.  The teeth in the lower jaw were relatively tall (half the depth of the supporting bone), and the teeth toward the rear of the known material were widely spaced.  The snout apparently was hollow, with a supporting internal boxwork of bone. Mythunga was described by Ralph Molnar and R. A. Thulborn in 2008, and provisionally thought to be related to plesiomorphic, and thus possibly basal, pterodactyloids.  The type species is M. camara.[tpl]cite journal |last=Molnar |first=Ralph E. |coauthors= and Thulborn, R.A. |year=2008 |title=An incomplete pterosaur skull from the Cretaceous of north-central Queensland, Australia |journal=Arquivos do Museu Nacional, Rio de Janeiro |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=461â€“470 [/tpl]
