Its advantage is that, unlike previous pendulum gravimeters, the pendulum's [[centre of gravity]] and [[center of oscillation]] don't have to be determined, allowing greater accuracy.  For about a century, until the 1930s, Kater's pendulum and its various refinements remained the standard method for measuring the strength of the Earth's gravity during [[Geodetics|geodetic]] surveys.  It is now used only for demonstrating pendulum principles.

==Description==

The pendulum consists of a rigid metal bar with two pivot points, one near each end of the bar.  It can be suspended from either pivot and swung.  It also has either an adjustable weight that can be moved up and down the bar, or one adjustable pivot, to adjust the periods of swing.  In use, it is swung from one pivot, and the period timed, and then turned upside down and swung from the other pivot, and the period timed.  The movable weight (or pivot) is adjusted until the two periods are equal.  At this point the period is equal to the period of an 'ideal' simple pendulum of length equal to the distance between the pivots.  From the period and the measured distance between the pivots, the acceleration of gravity can be calculated with great precision from the periodicity equation for a simple pendulum, (1) below.

==Gravity measurement with pendulums==

A pendulum can be used to measure the acceleration of gravity g because its period of swing T depends only on g and its length L:[ref]

So by measuring the length L and period T of a pendulum, g can be calculated.  The first person to discover that gravity varied over the Earth's surface was French scientist Jean Richer, who in 1671 was sent on an expedition to Cayenne, French Guiana by the French Académie des Sciences, assigned the task of making measurements with a pendulum clock.  Through the observations he made in the following year, Richer determined that the clock was 2½ minutes per day slower than at Paris, or equivalently the length of a pendulum with a swing of one second there was 1¼ Paris lines, or 2.6 mm, shorter than at Paris.[ref]
