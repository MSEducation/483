CATEGORIES: Government agencies of Sweden, Military of Sweden

The Swedish Armed Forces ([tpl]lang-sv|Försvarsmakten[/tpl]) is a Swedish Government Agency responsible for the maintenance and operation of the armed forces of Sweden. The primary task of the Swedish Armed Forces is to train, organize and deploy military forces, domestically and abroad, while maintaining the long-term ability to defend the country in the event of war. The Armed Forces consists of three service branches; the Army, the Air Force and the Navy. Since 1994 the three branches are organized in one unified Government Agency. However, they maintain their separate identities through the use of different uniforms, ranks, and other service specific traditions.
The Supreme Commander is a four-star general or flag officer that is the agency head  of the Swedish Armed Forces, and is the highest ranking professional officer on active duty. The Supreme Commander in turn reports, normally through the Minister for Defence, directly to the Government of Sweden, which in turn answers to the Riksdag. The King of Sweden was, before the enactment of the 1974 Instrument of Government, the de jure commander in chief, but currently only has a ceremonial role in the Armed Forces as the head of state.
Sweden's military forces were for over a century built upon the concepts of conscription and territorial defence, supporting the longstanding national policy of non-alignment. Until the end of the Cold War nearly all men reaching the age of military service were conscripted. In the summer of 2010, peacetime conscription was abolished, to be replaced with an all-volunteer army. The transfer to the new system is planned to be fully completed in 2018.
Units from the Swedish Armed Forces are currently on deployment in Afghanistan (as part of ISAF) and in Kosovo. Moreover, Sweden contributes military observers to various countries and serve as the lead nation for an EU Battle Group approximately once every three years.
A 2013 report by the Swedish National Audit Office found that the Swedish Armed Forces were incapable of defending the country.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20140114/DEFREG01/301140030 |title=Sweden Considers Broader Alliances With NATO, EU |last1=O’DWYER |first1=GERARD |date=14 January 2014 |website=defensenews.com |publisher=Gannett Government Media Corporation |accessdate=14 January 2014[/tpl]

==Doctrine==

The Swedish Armed Forces have four main tasks:Försvarets fyra huvuduppgifter (In Swedish)
Sweden aims to have the option of remaining neutral in case of proximate war."Sverige är militärt alliansfritt. Denna säkerhetspolitiska linje, med möjlighet till neutralitet vid konflikter i vårt närområde, har tjänat oss väl." Sveriges säkerhetspolitik (In Swedish) However, Sweden cooperates militarily with a number of foreign countries. As a member of the European Union, Sweden is acting as the lead nation for EU Battlegroups[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mil.se/en/Organisation/Units-on-standby/Nordic-Battlegroup/ |title=Nordic Battlegroup - Försvarsmakten |publisher=Mil.se |date=2009-01-19 |accessdate=2009-08-05[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and also has a close cooperation, including joint exercises, with NATO through its membership in Partnership for Peace and Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.Sverige och NATO (In Swedish) In 2008 a partnership was initiated between the Nordic countries to, among other things, increase the capability of joint action, and this led to the creation of NORDEFCO.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mil.se/en/About-the-Armed-Forces/Nordic-defence-cooperation/ |title=Nordic defence cooperation - Försvarsmakten |publisher=Mil.se |date=2009-03-06 |accessdate=2009-08-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mil.se/en/About-the-Armed-Forces/Nordic-defence-cooperation/Background-to-cooperation/ |title=Background to cooperation - Försvarsmakten |publisher=Mil.se |date=2009-03-06 |accessdate=2009-08-05[/tpl] As a response to the expanded military cooperation the defence proposition of 2009 stated that Sweden will not remain passive if a Nordic country or a member of the European Union were attacked.Ett användbart försvar, last paragraph (In Swedish)
Recent political decisions have strongly emphasized the capability to participate in international operations, to the point where this has become the main short-term goal of training and equipment acquisition.Försvarsreformen (In Swedish)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mil.se/en/About-the-Armed-Forces/Our-task/ |title=Our task - Försvarsmakten |publisher=Mil.se |date=2007-09-25 |accessdate=2009-08-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mil.se/en/About-the-Armed-Forces/The-Swedish-military-service-system/ |title=The Swedish military service system - Försvarsmakten |publisher=Mil.se |date=2007-09-28 |accessdate=2009-08-05[/tpl] However, after the 2008 South Ossetia war territorial defense was once again emphasized. Until then most units could not be mobilized within one year. In 2009 the Minister for Defence stated that in the future all of the armed forces must capable of fully mobilizing within one week.Ett användbart försvar
In 2013, after Russian air exercises in close proximity to the Swedish border were widely reported, only six percent of Swedes expressed confidence in the ability of the nation to defend itself.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.acus.org/natosource/most-swedes-doubt-sweden-can-defend-itself |title=Most Swedes doubt Sweden can defend itself |last1=Benitez |first1=Jorge |date=30 April 2013 |website=acus.org |publisher=Atlantic Council |accessdate=30 April 2013[/tpl]

==Personnel==

===From national service to an all-volunteer force===

In mid-1995, with the national service system based on universal military training, the Swedish Army consisted of 15 maneuver brigades and, in addition, 100 battalions of various sorts (artillery, engineers, rangers, air defense, amphibious, security, surveillance etc.) with a mobilization-time of between one and two days. When national service was replaced by a selective service system, fewer and fewer young men were drafted due to the reduction in size of the armed forces. By 2010 the Swedish Army had two battalions that could be mobilized within 90 days. When the volunteer system has been fully implemented by 2019, the army will consist of 7 maneuver battalions and 14 battalions of various sorts with a readiness of one week. The Home Guard will be reduced in size to 22 000 soldiers.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ivarsson|first=Ulf|title=Pendeln måste slå tillbaka|pages=5|journal=Hemvärnet|date=February 2007|issue=1[/tpl]

===Criticism and research===

In 2008, professor Mats Alvesson of the University of Lund and Karl Ydén of the University of Göteborg claimed in an op-ed, based on Ydén's doctoral dissertation, that a large part of the officer corps of the Swedish Armed Forces was preoccupied with administrative tasks instead of training soldiers or partaking in international operations. They claimed that Swedish officers were mainly focused on climbing the ranks and thereby increasing their wages and that the main way of doing this is to take more training courses, which decreases the number of officer that are specialized in their field. Therefore, the authors claimed, the Swedish Armed Forces were poorly prepared for its mission.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/debatt/karriarstyrda-officerare-skapar-inkompetent-forsvar |title=Karriärstyrda officerare skapar inkompetent försvar |language=[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] |publisher=DN.se |date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2013-03-28[/tpl]
Major changes have been made to the officer system since then.
The transformation of the old invasion armed forces to the new smaller and more mobile force has also been criticized. According to the Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces the present defence budget will not be enough to implement the new defence structure by 2019. And that even when finished the armed forces will only be able to fight for a week at most.http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/forsvar-med-tidsgrans_7789308.svd
During 2013 several Russian Air Force exercises over the Baltic Sea aimed at Swedish Military targets have made  
the future of the Swedish Armed Forces a hot topic and several political parties now want to increase defence funding.http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/ryska-bombflyg-ovade-mot-sverige_8698898.svdhttp://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/ryskt-flyg-ovade-anfall-mot-sverige_8108894.svdhttp://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article17628436.ab

===Ranks===

See: Military ranks of the Swedish armed forces
When an army based on national service (conscription) was introduced in 1901 all commissioned officers had ranks that were senior of the warrant officers (underofficerare) and non-commissioned officers (underbefäl). In a reform 1926 the relative rank of the then senior warrant officer, fanjunkare, was increased to be equal with the junior officer rank underlöjtnant and above the most junior officer rank fänrik. In 1960 the relative rank of the warrant officers were elevated further so that
i. The lowest warrant officer, sergeant, had relative rank just below the lowest officer rank, fänrik.
ii. The second warrant officer rank, fanjunkare, had relative rank between fänrik and löjtnant
iii. The highest warrant officer rank, förvaltare, had relative rank between first lieutenant and captain.
In 1972 the personnel structure changed, reflecting increased responsibilities of warrant and non-commissioned officers, renaming the underofficerare as kompaniofficerare, giving them the same ranks as company grade officers (fänrik, löjtnant, kapten). Underbefäl was renamed plutonsofficerare and given the rank titles of sergeant and fanjunkare, although their relative rank were now placed below fänrik. The commissioned officers were renamed regementsofficerare, beginning with löjtnant. The three-track career system was maintained, as well as three separate messes.
A major change in the personnel structure in 1983 (NBO 1983), merged the three professional corps of platoon officers, company officers, and regimental officers into a one-track career system within a single corps called professional officers (yrkesofficerare). The three messes were also merged to one.
In 2008 the Riksdag decided to create a two-track career system with a category called specialistofficerare. When implementing the parliamentary resolution the Chief of Staff decided that some ranks in this category should, like the old underofficerare ranks in 1960-1972, have a relative rank higher than the most junior officers.

==Organization==

===Armed Forces Headquarters===

The Armed Forces Headquarters is the highest level of command in the Swedish Armed Forces.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mil.se/templates/Mil_UnitStartpage.aspx?id=10130&epslanguage=EN |title=Armed Forces Headquarters (HKV) - Försvarsmakten |publisher=Mil.se |date=2008-12-01 |accessdate=2009-08-05[/tpl] It is led by the Supreme Commander with a civilian Director General as his deputy, with functional directorates having different responsibilities (e.g. the Military Intelligence and Security Service). Overall, the Armed Forces Headquarters have about 1000 employees, including civilian personnel.[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] http://www.mil.se/templates/Mil_UnitStartpage.aspx?id=7212&epslanguage=SV[tpl]sv icon[/tpl] http://www.mil.se/upload/Forband/HKV/hkv-org.pdf

===Branches===

===Schools===

Some of the schools listed below answer to other units, listed under the various branches of the Armed Forces.

===Centres===

===Military units===

====Deployed units and units ready for or mobilization====

The table describes what units Sweden currently has deployed abroad and what units may be mobilized within one year. Ready-within-one-year means that there is equipment but no currently contracted personnel. Mobilizing units outside of the R10-R90 readiness range will entail placing units on a wartime footing, wherein officers would have to leave their current assignments in order to command their units.

====Nordic Battle Group====

The Nordic Battle Group is a temporary formation of the Swedish Armed Forces, tasked as one of the EU Battle Groups. Sweden was lead nation for a Battle Group during the first half of 2011.

===International deployment===

Currently, Sweden has deployed military forces in Afghanistan with the International Security Assistance Force and in Kosovo as a part of the multinational Kosovo Force as well as a naval force deployed to the gulf of Aden as a part of Operation Atalanta. Military observers from Sweden have been sent to a large number of countries, including Georgia, North Korea, Lebanon, Israel and Sri Lanka and Sweden also participates with staff officers to missions in Sudan and Chad
