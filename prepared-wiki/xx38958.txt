Kings Island is a [tpl]convert|364|acre|adj=on[/tpl] amusement park located [tpl]convert|24|mi|km[/tpl] northeast of Cincinnati in Mason, Ohio.[tpl]cite news |last=McNutt |first=Randy |title=Bite by bite, neighboring cities take land |work=The Cincinnati Enquirer |date=August 31, 1998 |url=http://homefinder.cincinnati.com/closetohome/cth_lemontownship_083198.html |accessdate=December 28, 2006[/tpl] It is owned and operated by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. The park first opened in 1972 by the Taft Broadcasting Company in an effort to move and expand Coney Island, a popular resort destination along the banks of the Ohio River that was prone to frequent flooding. After more than $275 million in capital investments, the park features over 80 rides, shows and attractions including 14 roller coasters and a [tpl]convert|33|acre|adj=on[/tpl] water park.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.visitkingsisland.com/blog-article/online-fun/Celebrating-40-Years-of-Family-Fun-and-Entertainment|title=Celebrating 40 Years Of Family Fun and Entertainment|last=Helbig|first=Don|date=January 17, 2012|publisher=Kings Island|accessdate=July 10, 2012[/tpl] 
Throughout its history, Kings Island has appeared in popular sitcoms and has been highly publicized for its record-breaking attractions and events. One of the park's most well-known attractions, The Racer, is often credited with reviving worldwide interest in the roller coaster industry during the 1970s. Other attractions such as The Beast and Banshee set new world records including some that are still held. The park has also suffered through times of negative publicity particularly regarding the early demise of roller coasters The Bat and Son of Beast.
Kings Island is divided into several themed sections. The seasonal amusement park is open from April through Labor Day and reopens for a short time on weekends beginning in September for Halloween-themed events. As of 2012, Kings Island is the second-most visited seasonal amusement park in the United States behind Cedar Point with an estimated 3.21 million visitors. It is third overall for seasonal attendance in North America which is led by Canada's Wonderland.[tpl]cite web|title=TEA/AECOM 2012 Global Attractions Report|url=http://www.aecom.com/deployedfiles/Internet/Capabilities/Economics/_documents/2012%20Theme%20Index%20Combined_1-1_online.pdf|publisher=Themed Entertainment Association|accessdate=July 23, 2013|year=2012[/tpl] Kings Island has won Amusement Today's Golden Ticket Award for having the "Best Kids' Area" in the world for thirteen consecutive years (2001–2013).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goldenticketawards.com/winners/2013-09-08-05-13-59/park-a-ride-winners|title=2013 Park & Ride Winners|publisher=Amusement Today|accessdate=December 5, 2013[/tpl]

==History==

Kings Island was conceived as early as 1964 when Coney Island, a popular park on the banks of the Ohio River, [tpl]convert|10|mi|km[/tpl] east of downtown Cincinnati, suffered from a major flood that submerged the area in over [tpl]convert|14|ft|m[/tpl] of water. Although flooding was nothing new for the successful amusement park, the event triggered a reconsideration, given already-limited space for expansion and parking.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cetconnect.org/video/riding-history-limits-concept|title=Riding History To The Limits - The Concept|date=August 26, 2009|publisher=CET|accessdate=July 17, 2012[/tpl]
Gary Wachs, who with friends and family owned a majority of stock in Coney Island, decided it was time to relocate the park to stay competitive. After years of research and traveling abroad, he presented ideas for a new theme park to the company's board of directors. Board members such as Charles Sawyer, a significant stockholder, opposed the idea. It wasn't taken seriously until 1968, when actor Fess Parker announced plans to build a theme park in Northern Kentucky. Coney Island's primary market extended as far south as Louisville. The announcement highlighted the need for change and gave Wachs' proposal credibility within the organization.
In July 1969, Coney Island was sold to the Taft Broadcasting Company, a business interested in promoting its recently acquired Hanna-Barbera division, for $6.5 million USD. Taft Broadcasting then purchased [tpl]convert|1600|acre[/tpl] in Warren County, Ohio, for $3.2 million. It still owns [tpl]convert|773|acre[/tpl] of that purchase.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kicentral.com/history/development.php|title=Kings Island History|publisher=Kings Island Central|accessdate=July 27, 2010[/tpl] The site is located between I-71 and the Little Miami River in what was then a part of Deerfield Township.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amusementtoday.com/issues/at_june_2012_kings_island.pdf|title=Kings Island’s 40 years of success started with 1972 opening|last=Seifert|first=Jeffrey|date=June 2012|publisher=Amusement Today|accessdate=July 7, 2012[/tpl]

===Taft Broadcasting and KECO (1970–1992)===

Construction began on June 15, 1970. Later that year, a public contest was held to name the new park. "Kings Island" emerged the most popular for its recognition of the Kings Mills area as well as its predecessor Coney Island. Most of the former park's rides were relocated, while the rest were demolished. Coney Island's popular Sunlite Pool attraction remained open, however, and the original park was partially restored in later years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coneyislandpark.com/history.php |title=Coney Island History |publisher=Coney Island |accessdate=July 31, 2010[/tpl]
Less than two years after breaking ground, Kings Island opened its gates to the public on April 29, 1972.  It was the first of several preview events. The grand opening came the following month on May 27, 1972.
At the heart of the amusement park, visitors are greeted by International Street which lies just beyond the main entrance. The area's main attractions include the Royal Fountain, a [tpl]convert|600000|gal|m3|adj=mid|pool[/tpl] capable of shooting [tpl]convert|10000|gal|m3[/tpl] of water into the air each minute,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.visitkingsisland.com/public/news/media/history/trivia.cfm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100710071750/http://www.visitkingsisland.com/public/news/media/history/trivia.cfm |archivedate=July 10, 2010 |title= Kings Island, Trivia |accessdate=September 14, 2010[/tpl] and the signature Eiffel Tower, a 1/3 scale replica of the original which offers a view of the entire park to its guests. Also located here is Grand Carousel, Kings Island Theater and a variety of restaurants and souvenir shops.
Arguably, the most crowd-pleasing attraction featured at the park in its early days was The Racer, a wooden roller coaster consisting of two trains that race each other side-by-side on identical tracks. Designed by legendary designer John C. Allen, The Racer was an integral part of the roller coaster renaissance of the 1970s. Years later, it would be awarded the Roller Coaster Landmark plaque from American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) for its achievement.:Image:Racer (Kings Island) ACE Coaster.jpg Other roller coasters present on opening day in 1972 were the Bavarian Beetle, a small steel coaster brought over from Coney Island, and a new junior wooden coaster in the Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera originally named Scooby-Doo.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.themeparkbrochures.net/maps/1972/pki197x_1.html|title=Kings Island - 1972 Map|publisher=Themeparkbrochures.net|accessdate=July 22, 2012[/tpl]
Kings Island was nationally promoted in two well-known sitcoms on ABC. Each filmed an episode on location at the park: The Partridge Family in 1972 and The Brady Bunch the following year in 1973. The Brady Bunch was produced by Paramount Studios, a large Taft shareholder.[tpl]cite web |url=http://kicentral.com/history/brady.php |title=Brady Bunch at Kings Island |publisher=KingsIslandCentral.com |accessdate=August 1, 2010[/tpl] In later years, Kings Island changed ownership several times. Taft sold its theme park division in 1984 for $167.5 million, to Kings Entertainment Company (KECO), a company formed by senior executives and general managers of Taft Attractions Group. Three parks—Kings Island, Kings Dominion and Carowinds—were involved in the sale. Taft invested in KECO to retain one-third interest.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=799&dat=19840412&id=eJdjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9FEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5520,939609|title=Amusement Parks Sale Completed|date=April 11, 1984|work=The Bryan Times|accessdate=July 10, 2012|location=Bryan, Ohio[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/10/business/taft-sells-parks.html|title=Taft Sells Parks|work=The New York Times|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=July 10, 2012[/tpl] Three years later in 1987, Kings Island was sold individually to American Financial Corporation, led by Carl Lindner. The deal included a contract with KECO to continue managing park operations.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/PARAMOUNT+COMMUNICATIONS+WILL+ENTER+THEME+PARK+BUSINESS+BY+ACQUIRING...-a012412630 | title= Paramount communications will enter theme park business by acquiring kings entertainment and kings island park |author= Paramount Communications |publisher= PR Newswire |accessdate=June 28, 2012[/tpl] KECO purchased Great America in 1989.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1992&dat=19890606&id=W5VcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IlgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5086,1057726|title=Firm Acquires Big Theme Park|date=June 6, 1989|work=Merced Sun-Star|accessdate=July 10, 2012|location=Merced, California[/tpl]

===Paramount's Kings Island (1992–2006)===

In 1992, Paramount Communications Inc. (formerly Gulf+Western) purchased Kings Island and the rest of KECO's parks for $400 million. Paramount formed a new division known as Paramount Parks. They bought out the remaining 80% stake in Canada's Wonderland in 1993, raising the number of parks to five. That same year, Paramount Parks began incorporating themes from its movies into the park. Viacom entered the picture after acquiring Paramount in 1994, paving the way for the appearance of Nickelodeon themes. First was Nickelodeon Splat City, followed by Nickelodeon Central and eventually Nickelodeon Universe.
In 1997, a year after leaving Deerfield Township, the city of Mason annexed most of Kings Island.[tpl]cite news|url=http://homefinder.cincinnati.com/closetohome/cth_deerfieldtwshp_011297.html|title=Close To Home: Deerfield Township|date=January 12, 1997|work=The Cincinnati Enquirer|accessdate=15 July 2012[/tpl] A temporary measure allowed for some land to remain in Deerfield in an attempt to appease park officials and reduce the impact on the township. The rest would be annexed in 1999.[tpl]cite news|url=http://enquirer.com/editions/1999/09/15/loc_mason_annexes_all_of.html|title=Mason annexes all of Kings Island|last=Aldridge|first=Kevin|date=September 15, 1999|publisher=The Cincinnati Enquirer|accessdate=July 7, 2012[/tpl] On June 14, 2005, Viacom announced intentions to split into two companies (Viacom and CBS Corporation) with CBS inheriting Paramount Parks.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/BUSINESS/06/14/viacom.split/index.html |title=Viacom board opts to split company |date=June 14, 2005 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=July 16, 2012[/tpl] Seven months later, on January 26, 2006, CBS announced that the theme parks were for sale.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbscorporation.com/news-article.php?id=41 |title=CBS Corporation To Sell Paramount Parks To Cedar Fair, L.p.

===Cedar Fair era (2006–present)===

On June 30, 2006, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company purchased Kings Island and the rest of Paramount Parks for approximately $1.24 billion.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cedarfair.com/ir/press_releases/index.cfm?current_root=15&mode=story&story_id=77 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060728185503/http://www.cedarfair.com/ir/press_releases/index.cfm?current_root=15&mode=story&story_id=77 |archivedate=July 28, 2006 |title=Cedar Fair, L.P. Completes Acquisition of the Paramount Parks |accessdate=December 28, 2006 [/tpl] With this acquisition, Cedar Fair owned all three major amusement parks in Ohio: Kings Island, Cedar Point and Geauga Lake (purchased from Six Flags in 2004[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2004/03/08/daily24.html?jst=b_ln_hl|title=Six Flags agrees to sell Ohio park for $145M|date=March 10, 2004|publisher=Pittsburgh Business Times|accessdate=July 5, 2012[/tpl]). Kings Island kept the Paramount branding through the end of the 2006 season. Thereafter, Face/Off became Invertigo, The Italian Job Stunt Track became Backlot Stunt Coaster, Tomb Raider: The Ride became The Crypt and Top Gun became Flight Deck. Nickelodeon's presence remained in the park through 2009, when Cedar Fair changed the kids' area to a Peanuts theme.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/200908/1367/| title=Cedar Fair says goodbye to Nickelodeon| publisher=Theme Park Insider| date=August 29, 2009| accessdate=July 9, 2012[/tpl]
In late 2009, the Mason City Council decided to put a measure on its 2010 ballot that would mandate a 3-percent ticket tax and a 5-percent parking tax at both Kings Island and The Beach waterpark. Council member Tony Bradburn argued that it was necessary for the city to help pay for infrastructure improvements, as well as cover police and fire expenses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/dayton-news/ticket-tax-proposal-has-both-sides-lining-up-409138.html |title=Ticket tax proposal has both sides lining up |publisher=Dayton Daily News |date=November 20, 2009 |accessdate=September 3, 2010[/tpl] This proposed tax hike was the center of debate for several months. Kings Island actively encouraged the public to write, email and call Mason City Council representatives to express opposition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.journal-news.com/news/hamilton-news/mason-to-consider-ticket-tax-next-week-on-attractions-like-kings-island-527833.html |title=Mason to consider ticket tax |publisher=JournalNews |date=February 3, 2010 |accessdate=September 3, 2010[/tpl] On February 8, 2010, the Mason City Council voted 5–1 against the measure.[tpl]cite news |last=Callahan |first=Denise |url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/dayton-news/kings-island-ticket-tax-rejected-by-mason-city-council-536605.html |title=Kings Island ticket tax rejected by Mason City Council |work=Dayton Daily News |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wlwt.com/money/22498753/detail.html |title=Council Votes Against Kings Island Tax Hike |publisher=www.wlwt.com |date=February 8, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2010[/tpl]

==Park attractions==

===Action Zone===

Action Zone opened in 1974 as Lion Country Safari, a [tpl]Convert|100|acre|adj=on[/tpl] section of the park featuring a monorail ride that took guests on a safari-style tour through an animal preservation. The area later became known as Wild Animal Habitat. It featured former rides such as Screamin' Demon, an early steel looping roller coaster from Arrow Development added in 1977, and King Cobra, the world's first stand-up looping roller coaster unveiled in 1984.[tpl]cite news|url=http://cincinnati.metromix.com/events/article/kings-island-thrill-ride/3047733/content|title=Kings Island thrill ride history|last=Richardson|first=Rachel|date=April 25, 2012|publisher=Metromix|accessdate=April 26, 2013[/tpl]
Early in its tenure after purchasing Kings Island, Paramount unveiled Top Gun, a suspended roller coaster built by Arrow Dynamics that opened in 1993 next to the habitat attraction. Titled after a film of the same name, it was the first ride to be added to the park with a Paramount theme. For the following season in 1994, Paramount renamed the area Adventure Village and removed both the monorail ride and animal habitat. In 1999, a two-year expansion initiative began with the area's renaming to Action Zone and the addition of two new attractions – Drop Zone: Stunt Tower and Face/Off. When it debuted, Action Zone resembled a movie stunt set featuring a water tower as the centerpiece. The water tower was originally part of a skit with stunts and special effects that imitated a live movie set with a director and stunt performers. The performance depicted a stunt crew on a tower coming under heavy gunfire and escaping on a zip line, with the final performer falling as the tower was exploding.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lKyLuJwjWk |title=Kings Island Media Day 1999 |date=June 4, 2009 |accessdate=January 30, 2012[/tpl]
In the second year of the area's two-year expansion, Kings Island unveiled Son of Beast, the tallest and fastest of its kind and the first modern-day wooden roller coaster to feature a vertical loop. Due to a number of structural issues and two accidents, the ride closed for good in 2009 and was eventually demolished in 2012.[tpl]cite news|last=McClelland|first=Justin|title=Kings Island to tear down Son of Beast|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/kings-island-removing-roller-coaster/nP5bH/|accessdate=May 2, 2013|newspaper=Dayton Daily News|date=July 27, 2012[/tpl] Delirium, once the largest Giant Frisbee ride in the world, opened in 2003 and Banshee, the world's longest inverted roller coaster, opened in 2014 at the former location of Son of Beast.[tpl]cite news|url=http://enquirer.com/editions/2002/09/27/loc_new_k_i_ride_may.html|title=New K.I. ride may result in 'delirium'|last=McNutt|first=Randy|date=September 27, 2002|publisher=The Cincinnati Enquirer|accessdate=May 2, 2013[/tpl]

===Coney Mall===

When Kings Island first opened in 1972, a section of the park was dedicated to its predecessor, Coney Island. The area was constructed to resemble the former park's carnival-style layout and featured many of its flat rides that were relocated. Originally called Coney Island, the area was later renamed Old Coney in 1980 and again to Coney Mall in 1986.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.themeparkbrochures.net/1979/pki1979_3.html|title=Kings Island - 1979|accessdate=July 7, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.themeparkreview.com/parks/photo.php?pageid=1&linkid=4763|title=1980 Park Brochure|publisher=Theme Park Review|accessdate=July 7, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/matthunterross/6266690792/in/pool-77567853@N00/|title=Kings Island (1985)|accessdate=July 7, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/matthunterross/6871688911/in/pool-77567853@N00/|title=Kings Island (1986)|accessdate=July 7, 2012[/tpl] In addition to rides, the area features game booths, arcades and concession stands reminiscent of state fairs and traveling carnivals from the early twentieth century.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cetconnect.org/video/riding-history-limits-coney-mall|title=Riding History To The Limits – Coney Mall|date=August 26, 2009|publisher=CET|accessdate=July 7, 2012[/tpl]

====X-Base====

This sub-area opened in 2007. Flight of Fear had existed previously, but with the addition of Firehawk, the area took on its own theme, centered around flight and propulsion. Although the area is designated by a sign, it is not listed on the park map and is officially part of Coney Mall.

===International Street===

International Street is the first themed area to greet guests entering the park. It was one of the park's original staples in 1972. Through its architecture, the area represents the cultures of Italy, Spain, France, Germany and Sweden. It has restaurants, souvenir shops, the Royal Fountain with light and water shows and a one-third-scale replica of the Eiffel Tower.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cetconnect.org/video/riding-history-limits-international-appeal|title=Riding History To The Limits - International Appeal|date=August 26, 2009|publisher=CET|accessdate=July 7, 2012[/tpl] The area  features three family rides.

===Oktoberfest===

Oktoberfest, relating to the eponymous German festival, opened with the park in 1972. The area resembles a German town with timber-framed German-style architecture. The Festhaus is the central attraction, featuring live shows with several indoor eateries. A full-service bar is located atop a portion of Oktoberfest lake. Rides include one roller coaster, one thrill ride and one family ride.

===Planet Snoopy===

The area initially opened with the park in 1972 as The Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera and was later shortened to Hanna-Barbera Land. The upper part that borders Rivertown saw the addition of a kids' play area, stage and water attraction in 1995 and was renamed Nickelodeon Splat City. In 2001, Kings Mills Log Flume became The Wild Thornberrys River Adventure and Rugrats Runaway Reptar roller coaster was introduced. The expansion of this area into the lower part of Rivertown became known as Nickelodeon Central. At the start of the 2006 season, when Cedar Fair purchased the rights to the park from Paramount, Hanna-Barbera Land was gradually converted and renamed "Nickelodeon Universe". Nickelodeon-themed elements remained in the park until 2010, when Nickelodeon Universe was rethemed and renamed Planet Snoopy based on the comic strip.
Planet Snoopy contains many rides intended for smaller children, including four roller coasters, a skater coaster and a log flume ride. Amusement Today has awarded Kings Island with the Golden Ticket Award for Best Kids' Area in the World for the past thirteen years, 2001–2013. Kings Island's Planet Snoopy was also the largest in the Cedar Fair chain, until 2013 when Kings Dominion opened their expanded Planet Snoopy.[tpl]cite web|title = Kings Dominion announces expansion of Planet Snoopy|publisher = Richmond Times-Dispatch|url = http://www2.dailyprogress.com/news/2012/sep/12/kings-dominion-announces-major-expansion-childrens-ar-2199274/|date=September 12, 2012|accessdate =September 12, 2012[/tpl]

===Rivertown===

The area known as Rivertown has been in the park since its opening in 1972. The area adopts a western theme as a town with ranch-style buildings, old wooden signs and an old water tower. Swan lake was the centerpiece until Diamondback arrived in 2009. The area was originally going to be titled Frontier Land.[tpl]cite video |title=Fun in the making |publisher=Taft Broadcasting Co. |url=http://www.interthemepark.com |archiveurl=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2FyFdoT-ck |archivedate=1971 |accessdate=January 25, 2012 |time=2:01[/tpl] It features two roller coasters and two family rides.

===Soak City===

Included with park admission, Soak City is a [tpl]convert|33|acre|adj=on[/tpl] water park featuring two wave pools, several children's areas and a variety of water slides. It originally opened in 1989 as WaterWorks and has since been expanded several times. It was renamed and rethemed in 2004 to Crocodile Dundee's Boomerang Bay and in 2007, was again renamed to Boomerang Bay. On September 2, 2011, Kings Island announced that a $10 million expansion would take place in the 2011–2012 offseason and that the park would open in 2012 as Soak City.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.whiotv.com/news/news/kings-island-to-expand-water-park-in-2012/nDkbH/|title=Kings Island to expand water park in 2012|date=September 2, 2011|publisher=WHIO-TV|accessdate=October 22, 2011[/tpl]

===Halloween Haunt (Seasonal)===

Halloween Haunt, formerly known as Fear Fest from 2000–2007, is a Halloween-themed event at Kings Island that runs on weekends from late September until the last weekend of October. It features haunted houses, mazes, live shows, and most of the park's regular season attractions. It has been a yearly event at Kings Island since its debut in 2000.

==Fast Lane==

Fast Lane, introduced at Kings Island in July 2011, is a secondary queue system that offers shorter wait times on the park's most popular rides.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/Economy/2011/08/06/Cedar-Fair-trying-out-1st-in-line-access-fees-2.html|title=Cedar Fair trying out 1st-in-line access fees|last=Chavez|first=Jon|work=The Blade|publisher=August 6, 2011|accessdate=October 29, 2013[/tpl] In addition to the standard admission charge, visitors can bypass the standard wait line by purchasing a wrist band that grants access to the Fast Lane queue. A limited number of wrist bands are sold each day. The two options available for purchase are "Fast Lane" and "Fast Lane Plus". The standard Fast Lane offers access to 22 attractions, while Fast Lane Plus covers the same rides but also adds Banshee and Firehawk.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.visitkingsisland.com/things-to-do/fast-lane|title=Fast Lane and Fast Lane Plus|publisher=Kings Island|accessdate=October 29, 2013[/tpl]

====Dogstreet Cemetery====

Dogstreet cemetery is located at the north end of the Kings Island parking lot and is maintained by Deerfield Township. The historic cemetery dates back to 1803. The Warren County Genealogical Society documented nearly 70 grave sites in the cemetery, though [tpl]As of|2005|lc=y[/tpl], only 52 headstones remained.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.co.warren.oh.us/genealogy/cem/Dogstreet.htm|title=Dogstreet Cemetery|publisher=Warren County Genealogical Society|accessdate=January 23, 2012[/tpl]
