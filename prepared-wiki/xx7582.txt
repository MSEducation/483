[[Murder]]

CATEGORIES: Murder, Homicide, Causes of death, Crimes, Crimes against humanity, Sins

Murder is the unlawful killing, with malice aforethought, of another human, and generally this premeditated state of mind distinguishes murder from other forms of unlawful homicide (such as manslaughter).
As the loss of a human being may inflict grief upon the individuals close to the victim, and the commission of a murder is highly detrimental to the good order within society, most societies both present and in antiquity have considered it a most serious crime worthy of the harshest of punishment. In most countries, a person convicted of murder is typically given a long prison sentence, possibly a life sentence where permitted, and in some countries, the death penalty may be imposed for such an act – though this practice is becoming less common.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/28/us-china-death-penalty-amnesty | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Mark | last=Tran | title=China and US among top punishers but death penalty in decline | date=2011-03-28[/tpl]

==Definition==

William Blackstone (citing Edward Coke), in his Commentaries on the Laws of England set out the common law definition of murder, which by this definition occurs

The elements of common law murder are:
The Unlawful – This distinguishes murder from killings that are done within the boundaries of law, such as capital punishment, justified self-defense, or the killing of enemy combatants during a war.[tpl]cite book|author=Dennis J. Baker |title=Glanville Williams Textbook of Criminal Law |location=London |year=2012 |chapter=Chapter 11[/tpl]
Killing – At common law life ended with cardiopulmonary arrest – the total and permanent cessation of blood circulation and respiration. With advances in medical technology courts have adopted irreversible cessation of all brain function as marking the end of life.
of a human – This element presents the issue of when life begins. At common law a fetus was not a human being.R v Tait 1990 1 QB 290. Life began when the fetus passed through the birth canal and took its first breath.
by another human – at early common law suicide was considered murder. The requirement that the person killed be someone other than the perpetrator excluded suicide from the definition of murder.
with malice aforethought – originally malice aforethought carried its everyday meaning – a deliberate and premeditated (prior intent) killing of another motivated by ill will. Murder necessarily required that an appreciable time pass between the formation and execution of the intent to kill. The courts broadened the scope of murder by eliminating the requirement of actual premeditation and deliberation as well as true malice. All that was required for malice aforethought to exist is that the perpetrator act with one of the four states of mind that constitutes "malice."
The four states of mind recognized as constituting "malice" are:

Under state of mind (i), intent to kill, the deadly weapon rule applies. Thus, if the defendant intentionally uses a deadly weapon or instrument against the victim, such use authorizes a permissive inference of intent to kill. In other words, "intent follows the bullet."  Examples of deadly weapons and instruments include but are not limited to guns, knives, deadly toxins or chemicals or gases and even vehicles when intentionally used to harm a victim.
Under state of mind (iii), an "abandoned and malignant heart", the killing must result from defendant's conduct involving a reckless indifference to human life and a conscious disregard of an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily injury. An example of this is a 2007 law in California where an individual could be convicted of third-degree murder if he or she kills another person while operating a motor vehicle while being under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or controlled substances.
Under state of mind (iv), the felony-murder doctrine, the felony committed must be an inherently dangerous felony, such as burglary, arson, rape, robbery or kidnapping. Importantly, the underlying felony cannot be a lesser included offense such as assault, otherwise all criminal homicides would be murder as all are felonies.
Many jurisdictions divide murder by degrees. The most common divisions are between first and second degree murder. Generally, second degree murder is common law murder, and first degree is an aggravated form. The aggravating factors of first degree murder are a specific intent to kill, premeditation, and deliberation. In addition, murder committed by acts such as strangulation, poisoning, or lying in wait are also treated as first degree murder.[ref]Murder in the First and Second Degree (14-17)
A murder which shall be perpetrated by ... poison, lying in wait, imprisonment, starving, torture, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing or which shall be committed in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of any arson, rape or sex offense, robbery, kidnapping, burglary, or other felony committed or attempted with the use of a deadly weapon, shall be ... murder in the first degree ... and shall be punished by death or life imprisonment ... except that any person ... under 17 years of age at the time of the murder shall be punished with imprisonment ... for life.
All other kinds of murder, including that which shall be proximately caused by the unlawful distribution of opium or any synthetic or natural salt, compound, derivative, or the preparation of opium ... cause the death of the user, shall be ... murder in the second degree and ... shall be punished as a Class C felony
[/ref]
As with most legal terms, the precise definition of murder varies between jurisdictions and is usually codified in some form of legislation.  Even when the legal distinction between murder and manslaughter is clear, it is not unknown for a jury to find an defendant to murder guilty of the lesser offence.  The jury might sympathise with the defendant (e.g. in a crime of passion, or in the case of a bullied victim who kills her tormentor), and the jury may wish to protect the defendant from a sentence of life imprisonment or execution.

===At common law===

According to Blackstone, English common law identified murder as a public wrong.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch14.htm |title=Blackstone, Book 4, Chapter 14 |publisher=Yale.edu |accessdate=2010-06-25[/tpl] At common law, murder is considered to be malum in se, that is an act which is evil within itself. An act such as murder is wrong/evil by its very nature. And it is the very nature of the act which does not require any specific detailing or definition in the law to consider murder a crime.A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage By Bryan A. Garner, p. 545.
Some jurisdictions still take a common law view of murder. In such jurisdictions, precedent case law or previous decisions of the courts of law defines what is considered murder. However, although the common law is by nature flexible and adaptable, in the interests both of certainty and of securing convictions, most common law jurisdictions have codified their criminal law and now have statutory definitions of murder.

===Exclusions===

====General====

Although laws vary by country, there are circumstances of exclusion that are common in many legal systems.

====Specific to certain countries====

===Victim===

All jurisdictions require that the victim be a natural person; that is a human being who was still alive before being murdered. In other words, under the law, one cannot murder a cadaver, a corporation, a non-human animal, or any other non-human organism such as a plant or bacterium.
California's murder statute, Penal Code Section 187, was interpreted by the Supreme Court of California in 1994 as not requiring any proof of the viability of the fetus as a prerequisite to a murder conviction.People v. Davis, 7 Cal. 4th 797, 30 Cal. Rptr. 2d 50, 872 P.2d 591 (1994). This holding has two implications. The first is a defendant in California can be convicted of murder for killing a fetus which the mother herself could have terminated without committing a crime. The second, as stated by Justice Stanley Mosk in his dissent, because women carrying nonviable fetuses may not be visibly pregnant, it may be possible for a defendant to be convicted of intentionally murdering a person he did not know existed.

===Mitigating circumstances===

Some countries allow conditions that "affect the balance of the mind" to be regarded as mitigating circumstances. This means that a person may be found guilty of "manslaughter" on the basis of "diminished responsibility" rather than murder, if it can be proved that the killer was suffering from a condition that affected their judgment at the time. Depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and medication side-effects are examples of conditions that may be taken into account when assessing responsibility.

====Insanity====

Mental disorder may apply to a wide range of disorders including psychosis caused by schizophrenia and dementia, and excuse the person from the need to undergo the stress of a trial as to liability. Usually, sociopathy and other personality disorders are not legally considered insanity, because of the belief they are the result of free will in many societies. In some jurisdictions, following the pre-trial hearing to determine the extent of the disorder, the defense of "not guilty by reason of insanity" may be used to get a not guilty verdict.M'Naughten's case, 1843 All ER Rep 229. This defense has two elements:
Under New York law, for example:
Under the French Penal Code:
{{quote |Article 122-1
Those who successfully argue a defense based on a mental disorder are usually referred to mandatory clinical treatment until they are certified safe to be released back into the community, rather than prison.[ref]
, note: this text refers to the procedure of Involuntary commitment by the demand of the public authority, but the prefect systematically use that procedure whenever a man is discharged due to his dementia.[/ref]

====Post-partum depression====

Some countries, such as Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Italy, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia, allow postpartum depression (also known as post-natal depression) as a defense against murder of a child by a mother, provided that a child is less than two years old (this may be the specific offense of infanticide rather than murder and include the effects of lactation and other aspects of post-natal care).[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl]

====Unintentional====

For a killing to be considered murder, there normally needs to be an element of intent. A defendant may argue that he or she took precautions not to kill, that the death could not have been anticipated, or was unavoidable. As a general rule, manslaughter[tpl]cite web|url=http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&c=33&r=3691|title=Article 222-8|accessdate=2007-11-01|publisher=Legifrance|author=The French Parliemant |work=French Criminal Law[/tpl] constitutes reckless killing, but manslaughter also includes criminally negligent (i.e. grossly negligent) homicide.[tpl]cite web|url=http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&c=33&r=3686|title=Section II - Involuntary Offences Against Life|accessdate=2007-11-01|publisher=Legifrance|author=The French Parliemant |work=French Criminal Law[/tpl]

====Diminished capacity====

In those jurisdictions using the Uniform Penal Code, such as California, diminished capacity may be a defense. For example, Dan White used this defense(the so-called "Twinkie defense"). to obtain a manslaughter conviction, instead of murder, in the assassination of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk.

===Aggravating circumstances===

Murder with specified aggravating circumstances is often punished more harshly. Depending on the jurisdiction, such circumstances may include:
In the United States, these murders are referred to as first-degree or aggravated murders.

===Year-and-a-day rule===

[tpl]Globalise/UK|date=April 2014[/tpl][tpl]Globalize/US|date=April 2014[/tpl]
In some common law jurisdictions, a defendant accused of murder is not guilty if the victim survives for longer than one year and one day after the attack.See State v. Picotte, 2003 WI 42, 261 Wis. 2d 249 (2003)http://law.justia.com/wisconsin/codes/2010/940/940.10.html(search for "year-and-a-day-rule") This reflects the likelihood that if the victim dies, other factors will have contributed to the cause of death, breaking the chain of causation. Subject to any statute of limitations, the accused could still be charged with an offence representing the seriousness of the initial assault.
With advances in modern medicine, most countries have abandoned a fixed time period and test causation on the facts of the case.
In England and Wales, the "year-and-a-day-rule" was abolished by the Law Reform (Year and a Day Rule) Act 1996.  However, if death occurs three years or more after the original attack then prosecution can take place only with the Attorney-General's approval.
In the United States, many jurisdictions have abolished the rule as well.People v. Carrillo, 646 N.E.2d 582 (Ill. 1995)State v. Gabehart, 836 P.2d 102 (N.M. 1992) Abolition of the rule has been accomplished by enactment of statutory criminal codes, which had the effect of displacing the common-law definitions of crimes and corresponding defenses. In 2001, the Supreme Court of the United States held that retroactive application of a state supreme court decision abolishing the year-and-a-day rule did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of Article I of the United States Constitution.Rogers v. Tennessee, [tpl]ussc|532|451|2001[/tpl].
In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a 74-year-old man, William Barnes, was acquitted of murder charges on May 24, 2010. He was on trial for murder for the death of Philadelphia police officer Walter Barkley. Barnes shot Barkley on November 27, 1966, and served 16 years in prison for attempted murder. Barkley died on August 19, 2007, allegedly from complications of the wounds suffered nearly 41 years earlier.CBS News coverage of Barnes' acquittal Accessed May 24, 2010

==Origins and history==

In the past, certain types of homicide were lawful and justified. Georg Oesterdiekhoff wrote that:
One of the oldest known prohibitions against murder appears in the Sumerian Code of Ur-Nammu written sometime between 2100 and 2050 BC. The code states, "If a man commits a murder, that man must be killed." The payment of weregild was an important legal mechanism in early Germanic society. If someone was killed, the guilty person would have to pay weregild to the victim's family.  The other common form of legal reparation at this time was blood revenge.
In Judeo-Christian traditions, the prohibition against murder is one of the Ten Commandments given by God to Moses in (Exodus: 20v13) and (Deuteronomy 5v17). The Vulgate and subsequent early English translations of the Bible used the term secretly killeth his neighbour or smiteth his neighbour secretly rather than murder for the Latin clam percusserit proximum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.latinvulgate.com/verse.aspx?t=0&b=5&c=27 |title=Vulgate Deuteronomy Ch27 V24 |publisher=Latinvulgate.com |accessdate=2010-06-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hebrewoldtestament.com/B05C027.htm#V24 |title=Parallel Hebrew Old Testament Deuteronomy Ch27 V24 |publisher=Hebrewoldtestament.com |accessdate=2010-06-25[/tpl] Later editions such as Young's Literal Translation and the World English Bible have translated the Latin occides simply as murder[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/bible/ylt/Exodus/20.html |title=Exodus 20v13 |quote=Thou dost not murder. |work=Young's Literal Translation |accessdate=21 January 2011 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Exodus 20v13 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/8229/pg8229.txt |quote=You shall not murder. |work=World English Bible |accessdate=21 January 2011 [/tpl] rather than the alternatives of kill, assassinate, fall upon or slay.
In Islam according to the Qur'an, one of the greatest sins is to kill a human being who has committed no fault. "For that cause We decreed for the Children of Israel that whosoever killeth a human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind, and whoso saveth the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind."[tpl]Cite quran|5|32[/tpl] "And those who cry not unto any other god along with Allah, nor take the life which Allah hath forbidden save in (course of) justice, nor commit adultery - and whoso doeth this shall pay the penalty."[tpl]Cite quran|25|68[/tpl]

===Etymology===

Middle English mordre is a noun from Anglo-Saxon mordor and Old French murdre. Middle English mordre is a verb from Anglo-Saxon myrdrian and the Middle English noun.Geoffrey Chaucer, Neilson and Patch, Eds. (1921) Selections from Chaucer, Harcourt, Brace, p. 469.

==Incidence==

An estimated 520,000 people were murdered in 2000 around the globe. Another study estimated the world-wide murder rate at 456,300 in 2010 with a 35% increase since 1990.Albrecht, H. & Sheehy, F. (2013) Woran wir sterben. Zeit-Grafik, 7. Feb. 2013, based on The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, The Lancet, Vol. 380, Nr. 9859  Two-fifths of them were young people between the ages of 10 and 29 who were killed by other young people.[tpl]cite web|url=http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/FivePrecepts/AnnualViolence.html |title=WHO: 1.6 million die in violence annually |publisher=Online.sfsu.edu |date=2002-10-04 |accessdate=2010-06-25[/tpl] Because murder is the least likely crime to go unreported, statistics of murder are seen as a bellwether of overall crime rates.[tpl]cite news|last=Rubin |first=Joel |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-la-crime-20101217,0,1871598.story |title=Killing in L.A. drops to 1967 levels |publisher=latimes.com |date=2010-12-26 |accessdate=2011-01-27[/tpl]
Murder rates vary greatly among countries and societies around the world. In the Western world, murder rates in most countries have declined significantly during the 20th century and are now between 1 and 4 cases per 100,000 people per year.
Murder rates by country. Murder rates in jurisdictions such as Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Austria are among the lowest in the world, around 0.5 cases per 100,000 people per year; the rate of the United States is among the highest of developed countries, around 5.5 in 2004,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_04/offenses_reported/violent_crime/murder.html |title=FBI web site |publisher=Fbi.gov |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2010-06-25[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] with rates in larger cities sometimes over 40 per 100,000.Infoplease.com. The top ten highest murder rates are in Honduras (91.6 per 100,000), El Salvador, Ivory Coast, Venezuela, Belize, Jamaica, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guatemala, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Zambia. (UNODC, 2011 - full table here).
The following absolute murder counts per-country are not comparable because they are not adjusted by each country's total population. Nonetheless, they are included here for reference, with 2010 used as the base year (they may or may not include justifiable homicide, depending on the jurisdiction).

Workplace homicide is the fastest growing category of murder in America.
Development of murder rates over time in different countries is often used by both supporters and opponents of capital punishment and gun control. Using properly filtered data, it is possible to make the case for or against either of these issues. For example, one could look at murder rates in the United States from 1950 to 2000,[tpl]cite web|author=Christopher Effgen |url=http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm |title=Disaster Center web site |publisher=Disastercenter.com |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2010-06-25[/tpl] and notice that those rates went up sharply shortly after a moratorium on death sentences was effectively imposed in the late 1960s. This fact has been used to argue that capital punishment serves as a deterrent and, as such, it is morally justified. Capital punishment opponents frequently counter that the United States has much higher murder rates than Canada and most European Union countries, although all those countries have abolished the death penalty. Overall, the global pattern is too complex, and on average, the influence of both these factors may not be significant and could be more social, economic, and cultural.
Despite the immense improvements in forensics in the past few decades, the fraction of murders solved has decreased in the United States, from 90% in 1960 to 61% in 2007.Why Fewer Murder Cases Get Solved These Days by Lewis Beale. 19 May 2009. Solved murder rates in major U.S. cities varied in 2007 from 36% in Boston, Massachusetts to 76% in San Jose, California.CS Monitor by Brian Whitley. Christian Science Monitor. 24 December 2008. Major factors affecting the arrest rate include witness cooperation and the number of people assigned to investigate the case.

===History===

According to scholar Pieter Spierenburg homicide rates per 100,000 in Europe have fallen over the centuries, from 35 per 100,000 in medieval times, to 20 in 1500 AD, 5 in 1700, to below two per 100,000 in 1900.Spierenburg, Pieter, A History of Murder: Personal Violence in Europe from the Middle Ages to the Present, Polity, 2008. Referred to in "Rap Sheet Why is American history so murderous?" by Jill Lepore New Yorker, November 9, 2009
In the United States, murder rates have been higher and have fluctuated. They fell below 2 per 100,000 by 1900, rose during the first half of the century, dropped in the years following World War II, and bottomed out at 4.0 in 1957 before rising again.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/library/graphs/10.htm|title=Homicide Rates in the United States 1900-1990[/tpl] The rate stayed in 9 to 10 range most of the period from 1972 to 1994, before falling to 5 in present times. The increase since 1957 would have been even greater if not for the significant improvements in medical techniques and emergency response times, which mean that more and more attempted homicide victims survive. According to one estimate, if the lethality levels of criminal assaults of 1964 still applied in 1993, the country would have seen the murder rate of around 26 per 100,000, almost triple the actually observed rate of 9.5 per 100,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://people.umass.edu/zguo/iraqi%20war%20/murder%20and%20medicine.pdf|title=Murder and Medicine: The Lethality of Criminal Assault 1960-1999[/tpl]
A similar, but less pronounced pattern has been seen in major European countries as well. The murder rate in the United Kingdom fell to 1 per 100,000 by the beginning of the 20th century and as low as 0.62 per 100,000 in 1960, and was at 1.28 per 100,000 [tpl]as of|lc=y|2009[/tpl]. The murder rate in France (excluding Corsica) bottomed out after World War II at less than 0.4 per 100,000, quadrupling to 1.6 per 100,000 since then.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cjrc.osu.edu/researchprojects/hvd/AHSV/tables/AHSV%20European%20Homicides.pdf|title=American Homicide Supplemental Volume (AHSV), European Homicides (EH)|author=Randolph Roth|date=October 2009[/tpl]
The specific factors driving this dynamics in murder rates are complex and not universally agreed upon. Much of the raise in the U.S. murder rate during the first half of the 20th century is generally thought to be attributed to gang violence associated with the Prohibition. Since most murders are committed by young males, the near simultaneous low in the murder rates of major developed countries circa 1960 can be attributed to low birth rates during the Great Depression and World War II. Causes of further moves are more controversial. Some of the more exotic factors claimed to affect murder rates include the availability of abortion"Freakonomics", Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner, 2005, ISBN 0-06-073132-X and the likelihood of chronic exposure to lead during childhood (due to the use of leaded paint in houses and tetraethyllead as a gasoline additive in internal combustion engines).
Southern slave codes did make willful killing of a slave illegal in most cases.[tpl]cite book |last=Morris |first=Thomas D. |title=Southern Slavery and the Law, 1619-1860 |url=http://books.google.cz/books?id=VmPWCKh0hZAC&pg=PA172 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=1999|page=172| isbn=0807864307[/tpl] For example, the 1860 Mississippi case of Oliver v.

In Corsica, vendetta was a social code that required Corsicans to kill anyone who wronged the family honor. It has been estimated that between 1683 and 1715, nearly 30,000 out of 120,000 Corsicans lost their lives to vendetta,"Corsican Soup and Pulp Fiction" and between 1821 and 1852, no less than 4,300 murders were perpetrated in Corsica."Wanderings in Corsica: its history and its heroes".

==Country-specific murder law==

===Degrees of murder by country===

Certain countries employ the concept of first-, second-, and third-degree murder. Canadian law distinguishes first- and second-degree murder. Both the United States and Peru have respective degrees of first-, second-, and third-degree murder. See Degrees of murder in the United States and Murder (Peruvian law).
