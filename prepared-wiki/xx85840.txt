The Monnaie de Paris (Paris Mint) or, more administratively speaking, the "Direction of Coins and Medals", is an administration of the French government charged with issuing coins as well as producing medals and other similar items.  Many ancient coins are housed there. Created in 864, it is the oldest French institution.

==Building in Paris==

A Neoclassical edifice, the Hôtel de la Monnaie was designed by Jacques-Denis Antoine and built from 1767–1775 on the Left Bank of the Seine.  The Monnaie was the first major civic monument undertaken by Antoine, yet shows a high level of ingenuity on the part of the architect.  Today it is considered a key example of French Neoclassicism in pre-Revolutionary Paris.  The building is typified by its heavy external rustication and severe decorative treatment.  It boasts one of the longest façades on the Seine; its appearance has been likened to the Italian palazzo tradition.  The building, which housed mint workshops, administrative rooms, and residential quarters, wraps around a large interior courtyard.  It remains open to the public and includes a numismatics museum, located within what was once the main foundry.
