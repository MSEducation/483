[[Family Man (Black Flag album)]]

Family Man is the third full-length album released by the American hardcore punk band Black Flag in 1984. It is unique in that one side features spoken-word tracks by vocalist Henry Rollins and the other side mainly features instrumental tracks. "Armageddon Man" is the only track on the album in which Rollins and the instruments are together.
It is also (along with The Process of Weeding Out) one of the most divisive works of Black Flag's career. The album's half spoken-word and half jazz fusion heavy metal style was disarming to many Black Flag fans, already surprised by the direction of the preceding album, My War. However, despite alienating many fans, the record has attained a cult status over the years, particularly with fans of jazz and experimental metal.
