The Croatia men's national football team ([tpl]lang-hr|Hrvatska nogometna reprezentacija[/tpl]) represents Croatia in international football. The team is controlled by the Croatian Football Federation, the governing body for football in the country. A FIFA-recognised national side had previously represented the short-lived Banovina of Croatia and Independent State of Croatia in nineteen friendly matches between 1940 and 1944.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/kroa-intres.html |title=Croatia International matches |accessdate=14 July 2008|author=Kramarsic, Igor/Puric, Bojan|publisher=Rec. Sport Soccer Statistics Foundation [/tpl] This team was dissolved in 1945 as Croatia became a constituent federal republic of SFR Yugoslavia. In the period between 1945 and 1990, Croatia did not field a separate team for competitive matches and Croatian players played for the Yugoslavia national football team.
The modern Croatian team was formed in 1991, shortly before Croatia's independence from Yugoslavia, and by 1993 had gained membership in FIFA and UEFA.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/associations/association=cro/goalprogramme/index.html |title=Goal Programme – Croatian Football Federation – 2006|date=17 July 2008  |accessdate=4 September 2008|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA.com)[/tpl]  The team played their first competitive matches in the successful qualifying campaign for UEFA Euro 1996, leading to their first appearance at a major tournament. In Croatia's FIFA World Cup debut in 1998 the team finished third and provided the tournament's top scorer, Davor Šuker. Since becoming eligible to compete in international tournaments, Croatia have missed only one World Cup and one European Championship.[tpl]cite web |url=http://twg.fantasyeuro2008.sbs.com.au/stats.aspx?page=team&id=313 |title=Fantasy Euro2008 |accessdate=3 August 2008| publisher=The World Game[/tpl] [tpl]dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot[/tpl]
Most home matches are played at the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb, with some fixtures also taking place at the Poljud Stadium in Split or at other, smaller venues, such as Stadion Kantrida in Rijeka or Stadion Gradski vrt in Osijek, depending on the nature of the match. The team was undefeated in its first 36 home competitive matches at Maksimir, the run ending with a 2008 defeat to England.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2006/oct/08/newsstory.englandfootballteam1 |publisher=The Observer |author=Lawrence, Amy| title=England?

==History==

===Pre-independence===

Football was introduced to Croatia by English expatriates in Rijeka and Županja in 1873; the official rulebook was recognised in 1896. By 1907 local clubs had been established in Croatia and a modern edition of the sport's laws was published.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.croatia.org/crown/articles/9353/1/In-1880-local-Croatian-young-men-began-to-play-football-in-Zupanja.html |publisher=Croatian World Network|author=Bach, N. Nenad |title=In 1880 local Croatian young men began to play football in Zupanja |date=23 November 2007 |accessdate=6 September 2008 [/tpl] FIFA records document a Croatian national team playing a full-length fixture against domestic opposition in 1907. Before the nation's independence, Croatian footballers played for the national teams of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1919–39) and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1945–90), though during periods of political upheaval, ethnically Croatian sides sometimes formed to play unofficial matches.Ramet 2005, p. 171 A hastily arranged national side, managed by Hugo Kinert, played a few private domestic matches in 1918–19.Klemenčić, all pages[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uvijekvjerni.com/reprezentacija/povijest/ |publisher=Uvijek Vjerni |title=Hrvatska nogometna reprezentacija kroz povijest|date= |accessdate=14 August 2008 |language=Croatian[/tpl] Translation
In 1940, Jozo Jakopić led an unofficial national team representing the Banovina of Croatia in four friendly matches: two against Switzerland and two against Hungary. Croatia made their debut as an independently sanctioned team by defeating the Swiss 4–0 in Zagreb on 2 April 1940.[tpl]#tag:ref|Previous matches played by unofficial and temporary Croatian teams were still considered as a part of Yugoslavia. However, the side representing the Banovina of Croatia was separately recognised as the temporary puppet state was momentarily separated from Yugoslavia.|group="note"[/tpl] Following invasion by the Axis powers, the Croatian Football Federation became briefly active, joining FIFA on 17 July 1941, as the Independent State of Croatia. The national side, under the direction of Rudolf Hitrec, played fifteen friendly matches, fourteen as an official FIFA member.[tpl]cite web |url=http://croatiasoccer.blog.hr/2007/09/1623284234/povijest-hrvatskog-nogometnog-saveza.html |publisher=H-R |title=Povijest Hrvatskog Nogometnog Saveza |date=25 September 2007 |accessdate=19 August 2008 |language=Croatian [/tpl] Translation Croatia's first recorded result as a FIFA associate was a 1–1 tie with Slovakia on 8 September in Bratislava. Further matches were played until 1945 when the Independent State of Croatia was abolished and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia assumed control, thereby ending the team's affiliation with FIFA.
From 1950 to 1956 another unofficial Croatian team was briefly active; it won games against Indonesia and a Yugoslav team playing as "Serbia". The Yugoslavia squad at the 1956 Summer Olympics included Croatian footballers,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tableso/ol1956f.html |publisher=Rec.

===Official formation===

The last Yugoslav team to field a considerable Croatian contingent played against Sweden on 16 May 1991, days before Croatia's independence referendum.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesj/joeg-intres90.html |publisher=Rec.

The game, which Croatia won 2–1,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/asanovic-intl.html |publisher=Rec.

Croatia won twice more under his direction before Stanko Poklepović and Vlatko Marković each briefly headed the team. The match against the American side also marked the introduction of Croatia's national jersey. Designed with unique chequers, the initial kit was widely acknowledged for its originality.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nacional.hr/articles/view/23275/|publisher=Nacional (weekly)|trans_title=Croatian chequy are fashionable again|title=Hrvatske kocke opet modni hit|language=Croatian|date=20 February 2006|author1=Mario Duspara|author2=Tanja Simić|accessdate=30 June 2012|archivedate=30 June 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68oe1ZxT8[/tpl] Croatia was still considered part of Yugoslavia until its independence declaration on 8 October 1991, but this team already served as a de facto national team.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/kroa-intl9095.html |publisher=Rec.

In mid-1992 the team joined FIFA and UEFA. The team's performances before Croatia's independence were not recorded by FIFA, so they entered the World Rankings in 125th place. Miroslav Blažević was appointed manager and oversaw the team's qualifying campaign for Euro 96, beginning with Croatia's first officially recognised post-independence victory: a 2–0 win over Estonia on 4 September 1994. Their first competitive defeat came on 11 June 1995, with a 1–0 away loss to Ukraine during the same qualifying campaign. They finished on top of their qualifying group[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/EURO2004/History/Postings/2003/01/37017.htm |publisher=TheFA.com|title=1996 European Championship – Qualifying |date= |accessdate=10 August 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050211182457/http://www.thefa.com/EURO2004/History/Postings/2003/01/37017.htm |archivedate = 11 February 2005|deadurl=yes[/tpl] and won FIFA's 1994 Best Mover of the Year award as their international rankings rose.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/awards/gala/bestmover.html|title=Best Mover of the Year|publisher=fifa.com|accessdate=11 December 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081026144822/http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/awards/gala/bestmover.html |archivedate=26 October 2008[/tpl]

Miroslav Blažević remained as manager during Croatia's 1998 World Cup qualifying campaign, which ended successfully with victory over Ukraine in the play-offs. In the group stage of the World Cup, Croatia beat Jamaica and Japan but lost to Argentina, before defeating Romania to reach a quarter final tie against Germany, then ranked second in the world.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/ranking/lastranking/gender=m/fullranking.html#confederation=0&rank=50 |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA.com) |title=FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking |date=20 May 1998 |accessdate=10 December 2008 [/tpl] Though regarded as underdogs, Croatia won 3–0, with goals from Robert Jarni, Goran Vlaović and Davor Šuker after Christian Wörns was sent off for Germany.
Croatia faced the host nation, France, in the semi-final: after a goalless first-half, Croatia took the lead, only to concede two goals by opposing defender Lilian Thuram and lose 2–1.

===Decline under Jozić and Barić in the early 2000s===

Coach Blažević resigned in autumn 2000 and Mirko Jozić was appointed his successor. Despite the retirement of many "Golden Generation" players, Croatia were unbeaten in their qualifying matches for the 2002 World Cup. They commenced the tournament campaign with a narrow loss to Mexico before producing a surprise 2–1 victory over Euro 2000 finalists Italy in the next fixture.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=4395/preliminaries/preliminary=3835/index.html |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA.com) |title=2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan Preliminaries |date= |accessdate=10 August 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/italy_v_croatia/newsid_1925000/1925415.stm |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC Sport) |title=Croatia punish Italy|date=8 June 2002 |accessdate=10 August 2008 [/tpl] At the tournament the team blamed the pressure of high expectations[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/ecuador_v_croatia/newsid_2041000/2041393.stm |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC Sport) |title=Croatia blame pressure |date=13 June 2002 |accessdate=31 August 2008 [/tpl] for their final fixture loss to Ecuador which prevented their progression to the knockout stages.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/ecuador_v_croatia/default.stm |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC Sport) |title=Ecuador end Croatia hopes |date=13 June 2002 |accessdate=10 August 2008 [/tpl] Jozić resigned and was replaced in July 2002 by former Fenerbahçe coach Otto Barić, the team's first manager born outside the Balkans.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/croatia/newsid_2048000/2048514.stm|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC Sport) |title=Jozic to step down  |date=16 June 2002 |accessdate=31 August 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/croatia/players_to_watch/3569075.stm |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC Sport) |title=Baric leads Croatian charge  |date=26 May 2004 |accessdate=31 August 2008 [/tpl]

The team was eventually burdened with a number of key injuries and went on to suffer their heaviest defeat ever, losing 5-1 to England at Wembley Stadium. Although Croatia defeated Kazakhstan in their final qualifying fixture, they were ultimately eliminated after Ukraine, who had previously defeated group leaders England, beat Andorra to gain second place in the group. Bilić was once again heavily expected to resign as national coach, but instead vowed to renew his contract and remain in charge.

===Euro 2012; Bilić departs===

Despite heavy loss of form, which also saw the team fall outside the top 10 in the FIFA rankings, Croatia were placed in the top tier of teams for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying draw; the Croatian republic was previously a candidate to co-host the tournament with Hungary which would have allowed the team to qualify automatically. Instead, it was chosen to be played in Poland and Ukraine, Croatia ultimately competed in Group F for qualifying,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/standings/index.html |publisher=© 1998-2011 UEFA |title=UEFA Qualifying Round |date=28 September 2011 |accessdate=27 September 2011 [/tpl] and, despite being top-seeds, only finished second in the group behind Greece, settling for a play-off draw against Euro 2008 rivals Turkey. The buildup towards the matches garnered much global and domestic media attention, with Bilic himself referring the tie as a slight opportunity for revenge. Croatia proceeded to beat Turkey 3-0 on aggregate, with all three goals coming in the away leg in Istanbul, thereby qualifying for the 2012 European championship at Turkey's expense. In the proceeding group-stage draw for the tournament, Croatia were placed in pot three, the third tier of teams, and were eventually grouped with Ireland, Italy and defending champions Spain.
In the buildup towards the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament, the team's first major competition since their 2008 run at the same event, manager Slaven Bilić formally agreed a deal to manage Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow, thereby announcing his resignation from the national team. The team was once again garnished by many key injury concerns at the tournament, with long-standing forward Ivica Olić and defender Dejan Lovren missing out on a place in the squad. The team concluded their tournament preparations with friendly fixtures against Estonia and Norway.
Croatia opened their tournament campaign with a comfortable 3-1 victory over The Republic of Ireland, with striker Mario Mandžukić scoring twice. Mandžukić continued his run at the tournament with an equaliser in the 1-1 draw against Italy, which was marred by controversial fan reactions and referee decisions from English official Howard Webb. The team ultimately faced a complicated scenario in the buildup to their final group game against reigning champions Spain. UEFA's previous alteration of the tie-breaking criteria (used when two or more teams finish with an equal number of points) forced the national team to retain at least a point in their final game while also scoring at least once to match Italy's head-to-head record against Spain. Croatia ultimately suffered a 1-0 defeat. Moments before Jesus Navas scored the game's only goal, Vedran Ćorluka was the victim of a neck-tie tackle by Spain defensive midfielder Sergio Busquets on a corner kick which removed Ćorluka from a goal scoring opportunity in the penalty box. The late Spanish goal, along with Italy's victory over The Republic of Ireland, forced Croatia to exit the tournament in the group stage. However, the team subsequently garnered widespread domestic praise for their tournament performance, and were greeted by a large crowd upon their return. Upon his formal departure, Bilić was also praised for his long-standing service to the national side. Domestic media outlet Jutarnji List labelled him as Croatia's only manager to depart on such positive terms and credited him for his strong revival of the national side during his six-year tenure.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.vecernji.hr/sport/vijesti/ponosni-smo-sto-smo-imali-bas-ovakvog-slavena-bilica-clanak-422740 |publisher=Jutarnji List |title=Ponosni smo sto smo imali bas ovakvog Slavena Bilica |date=20 June 2012 |accessdate=21 June 2012 [/tpl]

===2012–present; Šuker takes over as president===

After the Euro, The Croatian Football Federation (HNS) has chosen a new president, with Croatia's all-time top goalscorer Davor Šuker replacing Vlatko Marković. Following an official meeting in Zagreb, the national side was chosen to be managed by another of its former defenders and analyst of the team's matches, Igor Štimac. However, Štimac's reign was deemed unsuccessful, lasting only a year, and he was replaced by former national team captain, Niko Kovač, who managed the U21 team at the time.

==Tournament records==

===World Cup record===

Croatia qualified for and competed in three consecutive World Cup finals between 1998 and 2006, but failed to qualify for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa after finishing 3rd in Group 6 of their Qualification Group behind England, and Ukraine. Although they had joined both FIFA and UEFA by 1992, they were unable to enter the 1994 World Cup as qualification had started before the side was officially recognised.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/94qual.html |title=World Cup 1994 qualifications |accessdate=20 August 2008|author=|publisher=Rec. Sport Soccer Statistics Foundation [/tpl] The nation's best performance came in their first World Cup where they finished third. In their following two World Cup campaigns they were eliminated after finishing third in their groups.

===UEFA Euro record===

Croatia's best results in UEFA Championships were quarter final finishes on their debut, in 1996, and in 2008. They did not qualify for the 2000 tournament. The HNS raised an unsuccessful joint bid with the Hungarian Football Federation to co-host the 2012 tournament, which was awarded instead to Poland and Ukraine.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro2012/news/newsid=528963.html |author=| title=EURO joy for Poland and Ukraine |date=18 April 2007|accessdate=20 August 2008|publisher=Union of European Football Associations (UEFA.com)|work=European Championships archive [/tpl]

===Previous squads===

==Statistics==

===Managers===

Before Croatia's independence distinct Croatian football federations and teams were occasionally formed separately from the official Yugoslavian organisations. Ivo Kraljević served as the manager of the initial federation, established in 1939, and organised non-sanctioned matches played by unofficial national squads up to 1956. These temporary sides, playing non-competitive fixtures, were led by seven different managers.{{#tag:ref|The following organisers led the national team as 'managers':
Statistically, Dražan Jerković and Vlatko Marković are the most successful managers in Croatia's history; they both recorded victories in each of their few games in charge. Miroslav Blažević, who was the team's first official manager, holds the highest number of competitive victories, having led Croatia to their best performances at major international tournaments.

===Most appearances===

===Top goalscorers===

===1940s participants===

From 1940 to 1944 FIFA affiliated national teams played under the banner of the "Independent State of Croatia" nineteen friendly matches, of which it won nine, drew four and lost six. Twelve players scored for the team during this period.

==Records==

Dario Šimić was Croatia's first player to reach 100 appearances, doing so before his retirement in 2008. This allowed him to surpass Robert Jarni's previous record of 81 appearances.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www1.uefa.com/tournament/players/player=13821/index.html |publisher=Union of European Football Associations (UEFA.com)|work=European Championships archive  |title=Dario Simic – player profile|date=|accessdate=21 July 2008 [/tpl] [tpl]dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idUKL053798320080605 |publisher=Reuters|author=Milosavljevic, Zoran|title=Croatia`s Dario Simic Eyes 100th Cap|date=5 June 2008|accessdate=25 August 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sportnet.hr/Vijest.aspx?ID=365317 |publisher=Sportnet.hr|author=Pacak, Tomislav |title=Šimić završio sa stotkom|date=15 September 2008 |accessdate=25 August 2008 |language=Croatian[/tpl] Translation On 6 February 2013, Darijo Srna, Josip Simunic and Stipe Pletikosa each also played their 100th cap for Croatia in the 4-0 friendly victory over South Korea in London. The trio went on to set a new join-record of 101 appearances for the national team on 22 March 2013 in a World Cup qualifying victory against Serbia. 
With 45 goals scored, Davor Šuker is Croatia's highest-scoring player. He was named Croatia's "Golden Player" at the UEFA jubilee celebration in 2004 in recognition of this achievement.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/news/kind=2/newsid=638977.html |publisher=Union of European Football Associations (UEFA.com)|work=European Championships archive |author=Islamović, Elvir |title=Suker: a man with the Midas touch |date=1 April 2008|accessdate=22 July 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080523012306/http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/news/kind=2/newsid=638977.html |archivedate = 23 May 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Eduardo da Silva is in a distant second position with 29 goals (as of October 2013).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hns-cff.hr/?ln=hr&w=statistike|publisher=Hrvatski nogometni savez |title=Statistike – Nastupi|date=|accessdate=14 September 2010 [/tpl]  Mladen Petrić holds the national team record for goals in a single match, having scored four times during Croatia's 7–0 home victory over Andorra on 7 October 2006.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2008/matches/round=2241/match=83922/postmatch/report/index.html |publisher=Union of European Football Associations (UEFA.com)|work=European Championships archive |author=Islamović, Elvir |title=Petric inspires Croatian record|date=7 October 2006|accessdate=31 December 2012 [/tpl]
The national team's joint record for highest-scoring victory comes from two 7–0 results, over Andorra in 2006 and Australia in 1998. Croatia's worst defeat is also a joint record, the Independent State of Croatia side having twice lost 5–1 defeats to Germany in the 1940s. In the modern era Croatia lost 4–1 to Slovakia in a 1994 friendly and 3–0 to Portugal at Euro 96. The worst defeat in the modern period was the 5–1 loss to England in the 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign.

==Hierarchy==

The Croatian team is a fully licensed member of FIFA and UEFA. FIFA governs Croatia's participation in global international tournaments including the FIFA World Cup;[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/index.html | title=About FIFA |accessdate=7 November 2008|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA.com)[/tpl] UEFA presides over European tournaments.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/aboutuefa/index.html | title=About UEFA |accessdate=7 November 2008|publisher=Union of European Football Associations (UEFA.com)[/tpl]
The team is also governed by the Croatian Football Federation, which governs domestic football under FIFA and UEFA affiliation. The federation is led by Davor Šuker, who represents the team in conferences. The federation (abbreviated HNS) governs player registration and selects the team coaching staff and pays players' salaries. Head coach selects and organises national squad players and enforces team policies.[tpl]cite web |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&sl=hr&u=http://www.hns-cff.hr/%3Fln%3Dhr%26w%3Dpropisi&prev=/search%3Fq%3DCroatian%2Bfootball%2Bfederation%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG&usg=ALkJrhjuBIsClmzACrarPZy16kQUScqR1g | title=HNS regulations |accessdate=7 November 2008|publisher=Hrvatski Nogometni Savez homepage[/tpl]

==Stadium==

Most home matches take place at the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb. The venue, built 1912 and refurbished in 1997, is named after the surrounding neighbourhood of Maksimir.[tpl]citation |url=http://www.panstadia.com/vol7/74-022.htm |publisher=Panstadia | volume = 7 | number = 4 |author=McIntyre, Katie  |title=Architecture & Design – Maksimir Stadium |date= |accessdate=7 August 2008 [/tpl] The stadium has hosted national games since Croatia's competitive home debut against Lithuania; it also hosted the Croatian teams' home matches during World War II. The football federation and the Croatian government have agreed further improvements (among them an increase in the current forty-thousand seating capacity) that would make Maksimir the most expensive football stadium in the world.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.javno.com/en/croatia/clanak.php?id=88735 |publisher=Javno |title=Maksimir Stadium – World’s Most Expensive |date=11 October 2007 |accessdate=7 July 2008 [/tpl] However, in 2008, UEFA threatened to limit the number of fans allowed to attend home games after crowd discipline problems during the European Championships.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.javno.com/en/sports/clanak.php?id=159578 |publisher=Javno |title=UEFA to Punish HNS Due to Fascist Signs? |date=27 June 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2008 [/tpl] Zagreb Mayor Milan Bandić declined the final renovation plans in 2008, citing high construction costs; as of December 2008 the renovations are postponed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.javno.com/en/croatia/clanak.php?id=88773 |publisher=Javno |author=| title=Mayor: I Will Not Build Stadium at That Cost  |date=11 October 2007|accessdate=12 September 2008[/tpl]
Home matches were occasionally played at other venues. The Poljud Stadium in Split hosted several qualifying fixtures for Euro 1996 and the 1998 World Cup. Ever since the first match in 1995 against Italy which ended 1-1, Croatia was unable to win an official FIFA-recognised match at Poljud. That fact was known amongst the Croatian public as "Poljud curse".[tpl]cite web| url=http://arhiva.net.hr/sport/page/2008/02/06/0466006.html| publisher=Net.hr| title=Nastavljeno poljudsko prokletstvo| date=6 February 2008| accessdate=21 November 2010| language=Croatian[/tpl] Translation The unusual curse was finally broken in June 2011 with a 2-1 win against Georgia. The team also played qualifying matches at Stadion Kantrida in Rijeka, which they are unbeaten at, the Gradski vrt stadium in Osijek and the Stadion Anđelko Herjavec stadium in Varaždin.

===Home venues record===

Since Croatia's first fixture (17 October 1990, vs. United States) they have played home games at nine stadiums.

===Names===

Under the official FIFA Trigramme the team’s name is abbreviated as CRO; this acronym is used to identify the team in FIFA and media.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/associations/association=cro/countryInfo.html | title=Country info – Croatia |accessdate=4 November 2008|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA.com)[/tpl] The team is also identified under the International Organization for Standardization country code for Croatia, HRV.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ciolek.com/OWTRAD/iso3166-countrycodes.html | title=ISO 3166 Country Codes |accessdate=4 November 2008|publisher=ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency[/tpl] "Croatia national football team" can be translated into Croatian as "Hrvatska nogometna reprezentacija" (pronounced [tpl]IPA-sh|xř̩ʋaːtskaː noːɡoːmetnaː reprezentaːtsijaː|[/tpl]). Among the team's nicknames are Vatreni ("The Blazers") and, more recently, "Bilić Boys" (from the name of the coach, Slaven Bilić).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/confederationscup/news/newsid=806257.html |publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA.com) |title=Croatian press praises 'Bilic boys' |author=| date=17 June 2008 |accessdate=13 August 2008 [/tpl]

===Jersey===

Croatia's initial jersey was designed in 1991 by Miroslav Šutej, who also designed the nation's coat of arms. Although slightly altered by Lotto (the 1998 jersey was a white jersey with the chequers on the right side, like a flying flag) and Nike since its original release, the jersey has remained similar as a national identity; the chequered design is also used to represent other Croatian sports teams and athletes.

===Training===

Croatia's traditional training ground is located in Čatež, Slovenia, where the team prepares for all upcoming matches. However, the HNS has announced the production of a new training ground located in Tuhelj to accommodate further training improvements.http://www.croatiantimes.com/index.php?id=1427

===Supporters===

Prominent among Croatia's supporters are supporters from Slavonija region especially during last three big tournaments. Also big supporting base is given by followers of Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb, the two best-supported clubs in the Croatian domestic league, the Prva HNL.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gfk.hr/press/nogomet.htm |publisher=Growth from Knowledge (GFK Hrvatska) |title=Za koji hrvatski nogometni klub navijate?|date=18 May 2005 |accessdate=19 August 2008|language=Croatian|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080430100239/http://www.gfk.hr/press/nogomet.htm |archivedate = 30 April 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Translation The clubs' ultra-style supporter groups, the Bad Blue Boys of Zagreb and The Torcida from Split, have both been associated with hooliganism,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.independent.com.mt/news.asp?newsitemid=73131 |publisher=The Malta Independent |author=Brincat, Henry| title= Incident brings back memories of Malta-Croatia match: Seven Hajduk fans arrested|date=|accessdate=7 August 2008 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2006/may/31/sport.comment2 |publisher=The Guardian | title=Is hooliganism inevitable at this World Cup?|author=Brimson, Dougie/Miles, Kevin|date=31 May 2006|accessdate=4 September 2008 | location=London[/tpl] though violence between the two is not reported at international games.

Croatia's problems with its supporters continued throughout the opening round of the Euro 2012 competition as the team was cited for fan behaviour that included the display of racist banners and symbols, racist chants, and setting off and throwing fireworks during a match.

Football is Croatia's most popular team sport.Foster 2004, p. 52 By competing separately in both official and unofficial matches, the national team strengthened the unity of Croatian culture, an accomplishment which the predominant Catholic Church and economy were criticised for failing.Bellamy 2003, p. 113 After Croatia’s success at the 1998 World Cup, Tuđman declared that "football victories shape a nation’s identity as much as wars".
