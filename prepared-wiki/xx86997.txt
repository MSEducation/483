[[San Gorgonio Mountain]]

San Gorgonio Mountain, also known locally as Mount San Gorgonio, or Old Greyback, is the highest peak in Southern California and the Transverse Ranges at [tpl]convert|11503|ft|m[/tpl]. It is in the San Bernardino Mountains, [tpl]convert|27|mi|km[/tpl] east of the city of San Bernardino and [tpl]convert|12|mi|km[/tpl] north-northeast of San Gorgonio Pass. It lies within the San Gorgonio Wilderness, part of the San Bernardino National Forest. Spanish missionaries in the area during the early 17th century named the peak after Saint Gorgonius.
Since it is the highest point in a region which is separated from higher peaks (e.g. in the Sierra Nevada) by relatively low terrain, San Gorgonio Mountain is one of the most topographically prominent peaks in the United States. It is ranked 7th among peaks in the 48 contiguous states[tpl]cite peakbagger |lid=41204 |name=USA Lower 48 Top 100 Peaks by Prominence |accessdate=2012-04-01[/tpl] and 18th among overall.[tpl]cite peakbagger |lid=41201 |name=USA Peaks with 6000 feet of Prominence |accessdate=2012-04-01[/tpl]
A large and broad mountain, it is not particularly craggy, and from a distance, it only appears to be a extremely high hill, earning it the name of greyback. Despite not being particularly striking in appearance during the summer, it is the only mountain in Southern California with a summit a significant distance above the tree line. As such its bright white winter snow cap, unobstructed by vegetation, makes the mountain noticeable from many miles away. The mountain hosts the longest line of sight in the contiguous United States; it is plainly visible from the summit of Mount Whitney, 190 miles away.Longest lines of sight

==Hiking==

Like most other peaks in the Transverse Ranges, the summit is a technically easy class 1 hike. Several trails lead to the broad summit of San Gorgonio Mountain, which rises a few hundred feet (100 m) above the tree line. Most routes are very strenuous and require well over [tpl]convert|4000|ft|sigfig=2[/tpl] of elevation gain.
The trail leading from the Fish Creek Trailhead to San Gorgonio Mountain has about [tpl]convert|3400|ft|sigfig=2[/tpl] of gain, less than the routes from the South Fork and Vivian Creek trailheads. Hikers should always take caution because some junctions on this trail are not well marked.

==Aircraft wreckage==

On December 1, 1953, a Douglas C-47 Dakota, serial number 45-1124, crashed at the [tpl]convert|11000|ft|m|sigfig=2[/tpl] level on the eastern face of the mountain. The C-47 was en route from Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska to March Air Force Base near Riverside, California when it struck the mountain at night in the middle of a storm. "The aircraft was last heard from at 9:51 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, Monday." Thirteen people died."Transport Plane Wreckage Hunted", Playground Daily News, Fort Walton, Florida, 4 December 1952, Volume 7, Number 44, page 2.
Nearly one month after the C-47 accident a Marine Corps helicopter crashed on the mountain in coordination of the efforts of recovering the victims. The three crewmen of the helicopter survived the impact.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.qnet.com/~carcomm/wreck33.htm| title = C47 Transport Crashes on Mount San Gorgonio|publisher=Qnet.com|accessdate=2008-11-24[/tpl] Most of the wreckage of the two aircraft remain on the mountain and are accessible via the Fish Creek Trailhead or the South Fork Trailhead.
In more recent years, the mountain claimed the lives of Frank Sinatra's mother[tpl]cite news|title=Facing Life Without Him Sinatra's Wife Seeks Solace|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1998-05-18/news/18061019_1_barbara-sinatra-sinatra-spokeswoman-susan-reynolds-frank-sinatra|accessdate=July 28, 2012|newspaper=NY Daily News|date=May 18, 1998|author=Bill Bell, Michelle Caruso, Ana Figueroa, Corky Siemaszko[/tpl] (January 16, 1977) and Dean Paul Martin (March 21, 1987), son of Dean Martin, in unrelated plane crashes. Martin was an Air National Guard pilot and the McDonnell Douglas F-4C he was flying disappeared in a snowstorm and the wreckage was found on the mountain several days later.[tpl]cite news|title=Dean Martin's son's jet found wrecked|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3817459.html|date=March 26, 1987|author=Chicago Sun-Times|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=July 28, 2012[/tpl][tpl]Subscription required[/tpl]
