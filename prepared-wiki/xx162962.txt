"Rise Today" is a song recorded and performed by hard rock band Alter Bridge. The song was released as the first single in promotion of the band's second studio album, Blackbird. "Rise Today" is one of the band's most well-known songs.
The song is about making the world a better place ("I want to rise today/And change this world") and raises the question "Was the enemy just your brother all along?" Lyrically, it is one of the band's most uplifting songs. Singer Myles Kennedy plays lead guitar on "Rise Today" except for the ending guitar solo, which is performed by Mark Tremonti.
The song received heavy rotation in the media when it was featured in promos for the Season 6 premiere of CSI: Miami and in Fox's promo music video for the series premiere of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. In addition, "Rise Today" was named the official theme song to Unforgiven 2007.
Slash and Myles Kennedy, who have toured together in support of Slash's self-titled debut solo album, have covered this song on tour. Their version can be found on the rare live album Live in Manchester. Slash also joined Alter Bridge on stage in Stockholm on November 2, 2010 to perform the song, and has appeared on stage with Alter Bridge several times since. Alter Bridge has closed their concerts with this song since the release of Blackbird. "Rise Today" can be considered as the band's signature song.
