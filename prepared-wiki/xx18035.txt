American satirist and writer Mark Twain was born on 30 November 1835, exactly two weeks after the comet's perihelion. In his autobiography, published in 1909, he said,
 I came in with Halley's comet in 1835. It is coming again next year, and I expect to go out with it. It will be the greatest disappointment of my life if I don't go out with Halley's comet. The Almighty has said, no doubt: 'Now here are these two unaccountable freaks; they came in together, they must go out together.'[ref]

Halley's 1910 apparition is distinct from the Great Daylight Comet of 1910, which surpassed Halley in brilliance and was actually visible in broad daylight for a short period, approximately four months before Halley made its appearance.[ref]

The development of space travel gave scientists the opportunity to study the comet at close quarters, and several probes were launched to do so. The Soviet Vega 1 started returning images of Halley on 4 March 1986, and the first ever of its nucleus, and made its flyby on 6 March, followed by Vega 2 making its flyby on 9 March. On 14 March, the Giotto space probe, launched by the European Space Agency, made the closest pass of the comet's nucleus. There were also two Japanese probes, Suisei and Sakigake. The probes were unofficially known as the Halley Armada.[tpl]Cite web|title=Suisei|publisher=Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|year=2008|url=http://www.isas.ac.jp/e/enterp/missions/suisei.shtml|accessdate=2 December 2009[/tpl]

===After 1986===

On 12 February 1991, at a distance of [tpl]convert|14.4|AU|km|abbr=on[/tpl] from the Sun, Halley displayed an outburst that lasted for several months, releasing a cloud of dust 300,000 km across. The outburst likely started in December 1990, and then the comet brightened from magnitude 24.3 to magnitude 18.9.[tpl]cite journal |author= D. Prialnik and A.

The telescopes observed Halley, at the faintest and farthest any comet has ever been imaged, in order to verify a method for finding very faint trans-Neptunian objects.[tpl]Cite web|title=New Image of Comet Halley in the Cold |url=http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2003/phot-27-03.html |publisher=European Southern Observatory |date=1 September 2003 |accessdate=22 February 2009[/tpl] Astronomers are now able to observe the comet at any point in its orbit.
