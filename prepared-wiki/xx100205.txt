==Television==

===Early television roles===

Aged 19, Schofield moved with his family to New Zealand, where he made his television début as initial presenter of the youth music programme Shazam! on 23 February 1982.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/shazam-1982/series|title=Shazam! series|work=NZ On Screen|accessdate=3 December 2012[/tpl] He also spent two years working for the Auckland-based station Radio Hauraki.
In 1985, Schofield returned to Britain, where he became the first in-vision continuity presenter for Children's BBC on weekdays for two years from September 1985.
A chance encounter with Danny La Rue inspired him to further his career in the public spotlight and he spent an evening each week dancing at local clubs before deciding to focus entirely on his presenting career. He left the "Broom Cupboard" to present Going Live! on Saturday mornings between September 1987 and April 1993. He then moved to adult-orientated TV with various programmes for ITV, such as Schofield's Quest, Schofield's TV Gold and Ten Ball. From 1994 to 1997, Schofield presented Talking Telephone Numbers for five series, and the National Lottery Winning Lines programme for BBC One between June 2001 and October 2004.

===This Morning===

Since 2002, Schofield has been a presenter on ITV daytime show This Morning alongside Fern Britton until 2008 and with Holly Willoughby since 2009.
In May 2008 Schofield's father, Brian, died from a long-standing heart condition,[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] which led to Schofield's taking a break from presenting This Morning. John Barrowman stood in for him until his return.
On 8 November 2012, Schofield interviewed the prime minister David Cameron on This Morning and presented him with a list he had obtained from the internet of five people named as paedophiles in connection with the North Wales child abuse scandal. The names of several former senior Conservative politicians were said to be visible on the list. Cameron responded by warning against a witchhunt "particularly about people who are gay". Schofield was widely criticised for this action,[tpl]cite news | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20265581 | title= Phillip Schofield criticised for paedophile list 'stunt' | publisher=BBC News | date=9 November 2012 | accessdate=9 November 2012[/tpl] with broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby describing his behaviour as 'cretinous'.[tpl]cite web|last=Mason |first=Rowena |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/9665470/Phillip-Schofield-reported-to-Ofcom-over-paedophile-list.html |title=Phillip Schofield reported to Ofcom over paedophile list |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=8 November 2012[/tpl]
Schofield later apologised (via fellow presenter Ruth Langsford, putting the blame on the camera operator).[tpl]cite news|last=Burrell|first=Ian|title=Downing Street attacks Phillip Schofield for ambushing Prime Minister with internet-sourced list of suspected paedophiles|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/downing-street-attacks-phillip-schofield-for-ambushing-prime-minister-with-internetsourced-list-of-suspected-paedophiles-8297661.html|accessdate=8 November 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=8 November 2012[/tpl]

==Filmography==

===Other appearances===

==Radio==

While working as presenter of Going Live!, he was also broadcasting on BBC Radio 1 with a Sunday show (also called Going Live). When Radio 1 made the switch from medium wave to full use of FM stereo in 1988, Schofield was one of the presenters chosen to help with the launch by officiating at the turning on of the Southend transmitter. During his 2005 appearance on Room 101, Schofield recalled how a large crowd gathered in expectation of Simon Mayo arriving by helicopter to turn on the transmitter. Due to a miscommunication, however, Mayo instead flew to Norwich. Realising the crowd would be disappointed by Mayo's failure to appear, Schofield and an unnamed producer fled without revealing the news, and left the crowd – which included the town's mayor – still watching the sky. For this reason, and as a result of a later incident involving wing walking on an aeroplane leaving Southend Airport, Schofield chose Southend as one of his pet hates for the programme.
In February 2010 he launched Radio Plymouth in Devon.

==Theatre==

Schofield elected to try his hand at theatre, and took over the role of Joseph in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat from Jason Donovan on the West End stage. Another theatre production he was involved in was Doctor Dolittle.
