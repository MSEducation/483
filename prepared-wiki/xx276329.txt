==Personal Background==

Morgan previously worked as a CSI in Los Angeles, and is Conrad Ecklie's daughter, although she took her stepfather's last name.

==On the team==

In her first appearance, Morgan first worked with the CSIs when Raymond Langston was searching for his sworn enemy, the serial killer Nate Haskell. The take-down of Haskell had effects for the Las Vegas CSI team, but also for LAPD SID, and specifically Brody, who was fired from the Crime Lab for her involvement in the case.
In the season 12 premiere, she comes to Las Vegas to work with the team. She first sees Nick Stokes moving out of Grissom's old office. When Greg Sanders comes out of a lab, he felt a little awkward when they met, since he is clearly smitten by her. Nick asks him to not even think about it because she is Conrad Ecklie's daughter, although Greg continues to flirt with her, as seen in "Bittersweet"; however, Morgan tells Greg that she is not interested in dating guys on the job but is curious whether Nick and Al Robbins' niece are in a relationship, who were on a date in the beginning of the episode. In the episode "CSI Down" Morgan's relationship with her father is brought to light after she recovers from being abducted on a rescue helicopter. It is shown that both Morgan and Hodges have a good friendship. In the conclusion of "The Lost Reindeer" her secret Santa was Greg, and she was Hodges's respectively.
