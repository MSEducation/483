[[Lake Nemiscau]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of Nord-du-Québec

Lake Nemiscau (in French: Lac Nemiscau) is a lake in north-western Quebec, Canada, on the Rupert River. The abandoned settlement of Nemiscau is on the north shore, but in recent years, Cree people have been re-establishing Nemiscau as a summer residence. The nearest village is the town of Nemaska, about 60 km northeast.
