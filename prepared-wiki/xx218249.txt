[[10 metre running target mixed]]

CATEGORIES: ISSF shooting events, Rifle shooting sports

10 metre running target mixed is one of the ISSF shooting events, in which one shoots an airgun at a target that moves sideways. The target is pulled across a two meter aisle at a range of 10 metres from the firing point. The target is pulled either slow or fast, and it is visible for 5 or 2.5 seconds, respectively. The difference from 10 metre running target is that the slow and the fast runs are fired in a randomized order, that is not known beforehand to the shooter.
The course of fire is 40 shots, divided into two 20-shot stages, each consisting of exactly 10 slow and 10 fast runs.
