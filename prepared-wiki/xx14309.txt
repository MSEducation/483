</ref> is a [[binary star]] system in the [[constellation]] [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]]. It consists of a pair of [[Stellar classification|K-type]] [[dwarf star]]s that orbit each other in a period of about 659&nbsp;years, forming a [[visual binary]]. At fifth and sixth [[apparent magnitude]]s, they are among the least conspicuous stars visible in the night sky to an observer without an [[optical instrument]].
61 Cygni first attracted the attention of astronomers because of its large proper motion. In 1838, Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel measured its distance from Earth at about 10.3 light years,[tpl]cite web|title=A brief history of light years|url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2010/11/22/a_brief_history_of_light_years/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] very close to the actual value of about 11.4 light years; this was the first distance estimate for any star other than the Sun,[ref]
