Folliculogenesis-specific basic helix-loop-helix, also known as factor in the germline alpha (FIGalpha) or transcription factor FIGa, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the FIGLA gene.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: folliculogenesis specific basic helix-loop-helix| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=344018| accessdate = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Huntriss J, Gosden R, Hinkins M, Oliver B, Miller D, Rutherford AJ, Picton HM | title = Isolation, characterization and expression of the human Factor In the Germline alpha (FIGLA) gene in ovarian follicles and oocytes | journal = Mol.

==Function==

This gene encodes a protein that functions in postnatal oocyte-specific gene expression. The protein is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that regulates multiple oocyte-specific genes, including genes involved in folliculogenesis and those that encode the zona pellucida.

==Clinical significance==

Mutation in the FIGLA gene are associated with premature ovarian failure.[tpl]cite journal |author=Zhao H, Chen ZJ, Qin Y, et al. |title=Transcription factor FIGLA is mutated in patients with premature ovarian failure |journal=Am.
