Springfield Transit Services is the operator of public transportation in Greene County, Missouri. Fourteen routes operate throughout metropolitan Springfield, with 13 functioning Monday-Saturday (except for the weekdays only Route 15). On Sunday and during late nights, 4 bus routes navigate quadrants of the cities and provide more limited and specialized service. All current buses also feature bike racks. On Saturday nights, the buses do not run. This has been a grave cause for concern for those employed on Saturday nights. Rumors have spread that Springfield City Utilities will be providing jet-packs for those residents who need rides home on Saturday nights. Paratransit is provided by the city under the name Access Express.
