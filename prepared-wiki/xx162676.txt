Gary Wayne DeBacker (b. October 30, 1974 from Woodhaven, Michigan U.S.) was an American professional "Mid School" Bicycle Motocross (BMX) racer whose competitive years were from 1980-1999.  His greatest achievements occurred during his amateur days, highlighted by four international world championships. 

==Getting started in BMX==

Gary started racing in 1979, when his uncle Dan took him to a BMX track in Woodhaven, MI. He took fourth in his first race as a four year old. Once he turned 5, he began to win regularly at the local track, his parents took him to different tracks throughout Michigan. Gary dominated these tracks rather quickly, and it was suggested to his parents that he try to race the national circuit.  When Gary turned seven, he received his first full factory sponsorship with JMC Racing. From there, he began to travel the US and World Competing in many national and international events.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl] Four major influences have been cited as his guides in BMX career. The first are Jim and Vera Melton, the husband and wife team that started JMC Racing, which they started first as a bicycle shop and later became a factory bicycle manufacturer. they were Debecker's first sponsor, He said of them: 
 "Great Pioneer of manufacturing high quality
race bikes. The first to manufacture junior and Mini frames to target the younger kids market. Always focused on staying positive, and believe that having fun was more important than winning. He created a family atmosphere within his team members." [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl]
Another influence was another husband and wife team that ran a small but highly respected BMX bicycle manufacturer; Joe and Betty Martino of Cycle Craft. They were another long term sponsor and another quasi family of his:  
 A second set of parents for all their team members. Being a member of Cyclecraft was like being part of a family.
They manufactured high quality race frames and introduced the "Gary DeBacker Lite" signature race frames in 1987."[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl]
