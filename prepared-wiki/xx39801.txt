Pure Frosting is a compilation album by The Presidents of the United States of America. It was released on March 10, 1998.
It was, at the time, the band's last album, as they had broken up in 1998. They have since reunited and released new albums.
"Video Killed the Radio Star" originally appeared on The Wedding Singer soundtrack, and it is a cover of the song originally by The Buggles. This is the third version of the song The Presidents has released, as they originally released a live version as a b-side, and released a different studio version on Rarities. "Man (Opposable Thumb)" originally appeared on the 1997 soundtrack of Good Burger. "Cleveland Rocks" is also a cover, originally by Ian Hunter, and was used as the theme song to The Drew Carey Show.
