The Conservative gains included taking all 3 seats in the wards of Painters Ash and Singlewell from Labour. The Conservatives also held the seats in Whitehill where the two sitting councillors, George Lambton and Derek Robinson, had stood as independents after being deselected by the Conservatives before the election. The leader of the Conservatives on the council, Michael Snelling, said "I am over the moon. I think we have exceeded our expectations.", while the Labour council leader, John Burden said he planned "to come back in four years' time".
The election in Meopham North was postponed after the death of one of the Conservative councillors Malcolm Burgoyne on 25 April.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/1487445.election_for_last_ward_today/|title=Election for last ward today|date=21 June 2007|work=News Shopper|accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl] The delayed election in Meopham North was held on 21 June and saw the Conservatives hold both seats in the ward.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gravesham.gov.uk/democracy/mgElectionAreaResults.aspx?ID=24|title=Election results for Meopham North|publisher=Gravesham Borough Council|accessdate=26 September 2011[/tpl] The Conservative leader, Michael Snelling, was one of the two winners in Meopham North and as a result was able to then become the new leader of the council.
