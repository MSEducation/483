She described the selection of Elliot Mintz as the presenter not so much as a choice, but a "karmic destiny", as Mintz had been a close friend of the Lennons for some time.[tpl]cite interview |last = Ono |first = Yoko |subjectlink = Yoko Ono |title = Lost Lennon Tapes Premiere Show |program = Westwood One Radio Network |date = January 18, 1988 |accessdate =November 8, 2012[/tpl]
