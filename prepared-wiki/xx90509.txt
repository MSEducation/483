The Bauman Moscow State Technical University, Bauman MSTU ([tpl]lang-ru|link=no|Московский государственный технический университет им. Н. Э. Баумана (МГТУ им. Н. Э. Баумана)[/tpl]), sometimes colloquially referred to as the Bauman SchoolFrom 1868 till 1898 Bauman University was called : Imperial Moscow Technical School, and Superior Moscow Technical School or Baumanka ([tpl]lang-ru|link=no|Ба́уманка[/tpl]) is a public technical university located in Moscow, Russia.

==History==

The Bauman University was founded in 1763 by the Russian empress Catherine II as an Educational Imperial House. Bauman University is the oldest and largest Russian technical university offering B.S., M.S. and PhD degrees in various engineering fields and applied sciences. Bauman University is the second oldest educational institution in Moscow after Lomonosov Moscow State University (1755).
During the first half of the 20th century, Bauman University formed and founded more than 70 technical universities in the USSR.Some of them are now well known institutions, such as Moscow Aviation Institute, Moscow Power Engineering Institute, Moscow University of Civil Engineering, Moscow Chemical Institute, Moscow Communication and Informatics University, Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute TSAGI, and the Military Academy of Aviation Engineering Joukovski.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bmstu.ru/history/hmstu/bmstu |title=История |publisher=Bmstu.ru |accessdate=17 October 2011[/tpl]
In 1868 it was reorganised into the Imperial Moscow Technical School (IMTS) under the directorship of Victor Della-Vos. A key feature of the new institution was its educational system called the “Russian method”,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bmstu.ru/history/hmstu/russian_engineering_school |title=История |publisher=Bmstu.ru |accessdate=17 October 2011[/tpl] which unifies a broad and intensive theoretical preparation with a deep practical education closely connected with industries. Under his leadership the school participated in the Universal Exposition in 1873 in Vienna and the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition of 1876, where this method won a gold prize. It proved to be influential on John Daniel Runkle when he introduced manual training alongside theoretical training at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[tpl]cite web|last=Schenk|first=John P.|title=The Life and Times of Victor Karlovich Della-Vos|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED297137|accessdate=31 December 2013[/tpl]
It was also applied to other American technical universities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bmstu.ru/history/hmstu/becoming |title=История |publisher=Bmstu.ru |accessdate=17 October 2011[/tpl]
From 1918 to 2010 more than 144,000 students graduated with different engineering degrees.  Most of them chose to become scientists or engineers in leading research centers, universities, private and government owned companies.

The admission process includes three exams on math, physics and Russian. The university accepts one in ten applicants, which means that there are more than 30000 applicants.Rossiskaya Gazeta – Russian government daily newspaper of record which publishes the official decrees, statements and documents of state bodies. http://www.rg.ru/2009/08/11/fedorov.html More than 2,600 of them pass through two years of preparation courses, another 2,000 follow studies in high schools partners of Bauman University.L.I. Volkevich, How not to make a mistake in admitting process of Bauman University http://repetitors-moscow.ru/bileti//mgtu/MSTU.doc Participation in admission process requires a gage of original high school certificate which prevent applicants to take part in Lomonosov Moscow State University admission process at the same time.
The Bauman University is commonly regarded as one of Russia's most prestigious universities and has high entry requirements for its prospective students. The Bauman University is regularly ranked on the first place in official government and business press rating.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.5ballov.ru/news/king_plan/2006/08/09/53869 |title=МГТУ имени Баумана – первый среди технических вузов |publisher=5ballov.ru |accessdate=17 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cmpk.ru/info/vse_voyzi_moskvi/spisok_voyzov/bauman/ |title=Список ВУЗов :: Московский государственный технический университет им.

==Educational programs==

The academic year in this university begins on 1 September, and is divided into two terms (semesters). Students take exams at the end of each semester. 
The course of study lasts 6 years without interrupt for engineer specialist degree. But over the last few years the Bauman University has continued to integrate with the Bologna Process. And today some students learn using two step educational system.  The first two years students study general engineering subjects. In the third year students begin to study specialized subjects. 
In this university theoretical subjects accompanied by practical training. Students begin to work at the University's well-equipped (Russian standard) laboratories and in senior years at various plants, design offices and research institutes of Russia.
The history of the Bauman MHTS (Moscow Higher Technical School) or presently the Bauman MSTU (Moscow State Technical University) dates back to 1830, when Emperor Nicholas I confirmed the "statute of the industrial school" to open in Moscow. Russia's developing industry needed skilled labor in many trades. So, the aim of the new school was to train skillful artisans with a solid theoretical background to improve and spread skills in various trades all over Russia. The training personnel of the school comprised graduates of the Moscow University who specialized in mathematics, mechanics, physics and chemistry. By 1868 the academic standards of the school were so high that it was reorganized into a special institution of higher learning (Imperial Moscow Technical School or IMTS). Its major task now was to train mechanics in construction, engineering and manufacturing.
The IMTS was financially supported by the Government and industrialists. Its management was democratic. Its teaching staff boasted of many talented scientists who maintained contacts with the West. All these circumstances helped the School to achieve outstanding successes in manufacturing processes and practices in the chemical, food and textile industries, metal and wood processing, and structural mechanics. During the 1876 Exhibition in Philadelphia the practically-minded Americans highly appreciated and admired the methods used by the School, recognizing them as an original "Russian system" of training engineers. In 1876, Dr. Wrinkle, President of the Boston Institute of Technology, writes to V.K.Dela-Vos, Director of the Imperial Moscow Technical School that Russia is a recognized leader in handling the important problems of engineering education..., and that no other system will hence be used in America.
Thus, the Moscow Higher Technical School joined the ranks of "leading polytechnical schools in Europe".
The late 19th century witnessed quickening progress in electrical engineering, aeromechanics, and the power engineering industry. In 1918, the MHTS organized several research institutes, including TSAGI (Central Aerodynamics and Hydrodynamics Institute), which eventually developed into independent structures, separating from their parent. The quick industrial expansion of the country called for new training facilities on other fields of science and technology. In 1930, the MHTS began to branch out into many new institutions of higher learning: the Moscow Aviation Institute, the Moscow Power Engineering Institute, the Military Chemical Academy, the Textile Institute, and the Moscow Civil Engineering Institute.
The MHTS continued to specialize in training engineers for the machine-building and instrumentation industries.
In 1938, the MHTS opened new departments of defense profile: armoured vehicles and tanks, artillery, and ammunition. In 1948, a department of rocketry was added.
The following famous scientists and specialists have graduated our school: Academician A.N.Tupolev, S.P.Korolev, and many other aircraft and rocket designers and developers; Academician N.A.Dollezhal, chief designer of atomic piles; Academician A.I.Tselikov, chief designer of metallurgical engineering; Academician S.A.Lebedev, chief designer of computers.
Our School is distinguished for high-level scientific and engineering training of students, extensive relations with industries, good traditions, and high professional and moral requirements which both the professors and students feel obliged to meet and maintain.
In 1989, the MHTS was conferred a new name: the Bauman Moscow State Technical University (Bauman MSTU).
