USS ''Mobile'' (AKA-115/LKA-115) was a Charleston class attack cargo ship named after the city of Mobile, Alabama. She was the fourth U.S. Navy ship to bear that name. She served as a commissioned ship for 24 years and 4 months. LKA's had the distinction of being the only ships in the "Gator Navy" that were not flat bottom.  They would drop anchor several hundred yards offshore and use their Mike 8's (LCM-8) and Mike 6's (LCM-6) to ferry in the Marines and their equipment.
The name was assigned on 6 November 1967, and the ship was laid down at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., Newport News, VA, 15 January 1968 as AKA-115. As of the date of her article in DANFS, she was still under construction, and was scheduled to be completed in early spring 1969.
Mobile was extensively involved in the Vietnam War. 
In April 1975, Mobile participated in Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Saigon, Vietnam.By Sea, Air and Land: An Illustrated History of the U.S. Navy and the war in Southeast Asia Chapter 5: The Final Curtain, 1973-1975
