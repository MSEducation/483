Diphtheria (Greek διφθέρα (diphthera) "pair of leather scrolls") is an upper respiratory tract illness caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive bacterium.Office of Laboratory Security, Public Health Agency of Canada Corynebacterium diphtheriae Material Safety Data Sheet.

Diphtheria is an infectious disease spread by direct physical contact or breathing the aerosolized secretions of infected individuals. Historically quite common, diphtheria has largely been eradicated in developed nations through widespread vaccination. In the United States, for example, there were 53 reported cases of diphtheria between 1980 and 2000,[tpl]Cite book| author = Atkinson W, Hamborsky J, McIntyre L, Wolfe S, eds. | title = Diphtheria. in: Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (The Pink Book) | edition = 10 | pages = 59–70 | publisher = Washington DC: Public Health Foundation | year = 2007 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf [/tpl] but in the 21st century only two cases of diphtheria have been reported, the last of which was in 2003.Diphtheria reported cases, Table Last update: 4-Oct-2012, World Health Organization. The diphtheria–pertussis–tetanus (DPT) vaccine is recommended for all school-age children in the U.S., and boosters of the vaccine are recommended for adults, since the benefits of the vaccine decrease with age without constant re-exposure; they are particularly recommended for those traveling to areas where the disease has not been eradicated.

==Signs and symptoms==

The symptoms of diphtheria usually begin two to seven days after infection.
Symptoms of diphtheria include fever of 38°C (100.4°F) or above, chills, fatigue, bluish skin coloration (cyanosis), sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, foul-smelling bloodstained nasal discharge and lymphadenopathy.http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Diphtheria/Pages/Symptoms.aspxhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002575/ Symptoms can also include cardiac arrhythmias, myocarditis, and cranial and peripheral nerve palsies.

Laryngeal diphtheria can lead to a characteristic swollen neck and throat, or "bull neck". The swollen throat is often accompanied by a serious respiratory condition, characterized by a brassy or "barking" cough, stridor, hoarseness, and difficulty breathing, and historically referred to variously as "diphtheritic croup",[tpl]cite journal|last=Loving|first=Starling|title=Something concerning the diagnosis and treatment of false croup|journal=JAMA (journal)[tpl]![/tpl]JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=5 October 1895|volume=XXV|number=14|pages=567–573|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-FQcAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA567|accessdate=16 April 2014|doi=10.1001/jama.1895.02430400011001d[/tpl] "true croup",[tpl]cite journal|last=Cormack|first=John Rose|title=Meaning of the Terms Diphtheria, Croup, and Faux Croup|journal=British Medical Journal|date=8 May 1875|volume=1|number=749|page=606|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2297755/|accessdate=16 April 2014|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.749.606[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Bennett|first=James Risdon|title=True and False Croup|journal=British Medical Journal|date=8 May 1875|volume=1|number=749|pages=606–607|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2297754/|accessdate=16 April 2014|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.749.606-a[/tpl] or sometimes simply as "croup".[tpl]cite book|last=Beard|first=George Miller|title=Our Home Physician: A New and Popular Guide to the Art of Preserving Health and Treating Disease|year=1875|publisher=E.

As a result, the term "croup" nowadays most often refers to an unrelated viral illness that produces similar but milder respiratory symptoms.[tpl]cite journal|last=Vanderpool|first=Patricia|title=Recognizing croup and stridor in children|journal=American Nurse Today|date=December 2012|volume=7|number=12|url=http://www.americannursetoday.com/article.aspx?id=9752&fid=9722|accessdate=15 April 2014[/tpl]

==Mechanism==

Diphtheria toxin is produced by C. diphtheriae only when infected with a bacteriophage that integrates the toxin-encoding genetic elements into the bacteria.[tpl]cite journal | author = Victor J Freeman | title = Studies on the Virulence of Bacteriophage-Infected Strains of Corynebacterium Diphtheriae | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | year = 1951 | pages = 675–688 | pmid = 14850426 | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pmc=386063[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Freeman VJ, Morse IU | title = Further Observations on the Change to Virulence of Bacteriophage-Infected Avirulent Strains of Corynebacterium Diphtheriae | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | year = 1953 | pages = 407–414 | pmid = 14927573 | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pmc=169283[/tpl]
Diphtheria toxin is a single, 60kDa molecular weight  protein composed of two peptide chains, fragment A and fragment B, held together by a disulfide bond. Fragment B is a recognition subunit that gains the toxin entry into the host cell by binding to the EGF-like domain of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) on the cell surface. This signals the cell to internalize the toxin within an endosome via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Inside the endosome, the toxin is split by a trypsin-like protease into its individual A and B fragments. The acidity of the endosome causes fragment B to create pores in the endosome membrane, thereby catalyzing the release of fragment A into the cell's cytoplasm.
Fragment A inhibits the synthesis of new proteins in the affected cell. It does this by catalyzing ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor EF-2—a protein that is essential to the translation step of protein synthesis. This ADP-ribosylation involves the transfer of an ADP-ribose from NAD+ to a diphthamide (a modified histidine) residue within the EF-2 protein. Since EF-2 is needed for the moving of tRNA from the A-site to the P-site of the ribosome during protein translation, ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 prevents protein synthesis.
ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 is reversed by giving high doses of nicotinamide (a form of vitamin B3), since this is one of the reaction's end-products, and high amounts will drive the reaction in the opposite direction.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl]

==Diagnosis==

The current definition of diphtheria used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is based on both laboratory and clinical criteria.

===Laboratory criteria===

===Clinical criteria===

===Case classification===

Empirical treatment should generally be started in a patient in whom suspicion of diphtheria is high.

==Treatment==

The disease may remain manageable, but in more severe cases, lymph nodes in the neck may swell, and breathing and swallowing will be more difficult. People in this stage should seek immediate medical attention, as obstruction in the throat may require intubation or a tracheotomy. Abnormal cardiac rhythms can occur early in the course of the illness or weeks later, and can lead to heart failure. Diphtheria can also cause paralysis in the eye, neck, throat, or respiratory muscles. Patients with severe cases will be put in a hospital intensive care unit and be given a diphtheria antitoxin. Since antitoxin does not neutralize toxin that is already bound to tissues, delaying its administration is associated with an increase in mortality risk. Therefore, the decision to administer diphtheria antitoxin is based on clinical diagnosis, and should not await laboratory confirmation.
Antibiotics have not been demonstrated to affect healing of local infection in diphtheria patients treated with antitoxin. Antibiotics are used in patients or carriers to eradicate C. diphtheriae and prevent its transmission to others.

In cases that progress beyond a throat infection, diphtheria toxin spreads through the blood and can lead to potentially life-threatening complications that affect other organs, such as the heart and kidneys. The toxin can cause damage to the heart that affects its ability to pump blood or the kidneys' ability to clear wastes. It can also cause nerve damage, eventually leading to paralysis. About 40% to 50% of those left untreated can die.
