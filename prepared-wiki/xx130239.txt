The Order of Liberty, or Freedom, ([tpl]lang-pt|Ordem da Liberdade[/tpl]) is a Portuguese honorific civil order that distinguishes relevant services to the cause of democracy and freedom, in the defense of the values of civilization and human dignity. The order was created in 1976, after the Carnation Revolution of 1974 in which the quasi-fascist authoritarian Estado Novo regime of António de Oliveira Salazar and Marcello Caetano was deposed .  The Grand Collar can also be given by the President of Portugal to former Heads of State and others whose deeds are of an extraordinary nature and particular relevance to Portugal, to making them worthy of such distinction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ordens.presidencia.pt/?idc=185 |title=ORDEM DA LIBERDADE - Página Oficial das Ordens Honoríficas Portuguesas |publisher=Ordens.presidencia.pt |date= |accessdate=2012-05-28 |language=Portuguese[/tpl]
