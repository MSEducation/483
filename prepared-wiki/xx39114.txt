[tpl]nihongo|YuYu Hakusho|幽☆遊☆白書|Yū Yū Hakusho|lit. "Ghost Files" or "Poltergeist Report"[/tpl] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. The name of the series is spelled YuYu Hakusho in the Viz Media manga and Yu Yu Hakusho in other English distributions of the franchise. The series tells the story of Yusuke Urameshi, a teenage delinquent who is struck and killed by a car while attempting to save a child's life. After a number of tests presented to him by Koenma, the son of the ruler of the afterlife Underworld, Yusuke is revived and appointed the title of "Underworld Detective", with which he must investigate various cases involving demons and apparitions in the human world. The manga becomes more focused on martial arts battles and tournaments as it progresses. Togashi began creating YuYu Hakusho around November 1990, basing the series on his interests in the occult and horror films and an influence of Buddhist mythology.
The manga was originally serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 1990 to July 1994. The series consists of 175 chapters collected in 19 tankōbon volumes. In North America, the manga ran completely in Viz's Shonen Jump from January 2003 to January 2010. An anime adaptation consisting of 112 television episodes was directed by Noriyuki Abe and co-produced by Fuji Television, Yomiko Advertising, and Studio Pierrot. The television series originally aired on Japan's Fuji Television network from October 10, 1992 to January 7, 1995. It was later licensed in North America by Funimation Entertainment in 2001, where it aired on popular Cartoon Network blocks including Adult Swim and Toonami. The television series has also been broadcast in various countries around the world. It is currently being aired across Japan, other parts of Asia, and Eastern Europe by the anime satellite television network Animax. The YuYu Hakusho franchise has spawned two animated films, a series of original video animations (OVAs), audio albums, video games, and other merchandise.
YuYu Hakusho has been well received since its debut, with the manga selling over 50 million copies in Japan alone and winning the prestigious Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen manga in 1993. The animated series won the Animage Anime Grand Prix prize for best anime in 1994 and 1995. YuYu Hakusho has been watched by a large number of television viewers in Japan and wide range of age groups in the United States. The anime has been given mostly positive reviews by critics in North America, which compliment its writing, characters, and amount of action. Some reviewers have judged the series as being too repetitive.

==Plot==

YuYu Hakusho follows Yusuke Urameshi, a street-brawling delinquent who, in an uncharacteristic act of altruism, is hit by a car and killed in an attempt to save a young boy by pushing him out of the way.[tpl]cite journal |date=February 1998|title=Yû Yû Hakusho: It's Only Supernatural – A Field Guide to Yû Yû Hakusho |journal=Animerica |volume=6 | issue=2 | page=pp. 4–6, 24–6 | publisher=Viz Media | issn=1067-0831[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author=Ouellette, Martin | journal=Protoculture Addicts | publisher=Protoculture Inc. | title=Spotlight: Yu Yu Hakusho | issue=49 | date=April 1998 | page=pp. 34–40 | issn=0835-9563[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author=Kovalsky, Justin |date=November 2001 |title=Animerica Feature: Yû Yû Hakusho |journal=Animerica |volume=9 | issue=10/11 |page=p. 38–43 | publisher=Viz Media | url=http://www.animerica-mag.com/features/09.10.11/yuyuhakusho.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040407182737/http://www.animerica-mag.com/features/09.10.11/yuyuhakusho.html |archivedate=April 7, 2004 | issn=1067-0831[/tpl] His ghost is greeted by Botan, a woman who introduces herself as the pilot of the River Styx, who ferries souls to the "Underworld" or [tpl]nihongo|Spirit World|霊界|Reikai[/tpl] where they may be judged for the afterlife. Botan informs Yusuke that his act had caught even the Underworld by surprise and that there was not yet a place made for him in either heaven or hell. Thus Koenma, son of the Underworld's ruler King Enma, offers Yusuke a chance to return to his body through a series of tests. Yusuke succeeds with the help of his friends Keiko Yukimura and Kazuma Kuwabara. After returning to life, Koenma grants Yusuke the title of [tpl]nihongo|"Underworld Detective"|霊界探偵|Reikai Tantei|lit. "Spirit World Detective"[/tpl], charging him with investigating supernatural activity within the [tpl]nihongo|Human World|人間界|Ningenkai[/tpl]. Soon Yusuke is off on his first case, retrieving three treasures stolen from the Underworld by a gang of demons: Hiei, Kurama and Goki. Yusuke collects the three treasures with the aid of his new technique, the "Rei Gun", a shot of aura or [tpl]nihongo|Reiki|霊気||"Spirit Energy"[/tpl] fired mentally from his index finger. He then travels to the mountains in search of the aged, female martial arts master Genkai. Together with his rival Kuwabara, Yusuke fights through a tournament organized by Genkai to find her successor. Yusuke uses the competition as a cover to search for Rando, a demon who steals the techniques of martial arts masters and kills them. Yusuke defeats Rando in the final round of the tournament and trains with Genkai for several months, gaining more mastery over his aura. Yusuke is then sent to Maze Castle in the [tpl]nihongo|Demon Plane|魔界|Makai|lit. "Demon World"[/tpl], a third world occupied solely by demons, where Kuwabara and the newly reformed Kurama and Hiei assist him in defeating the Four Beasts, a quartet of demons attempting to blackmail Koenma into removing the barrier keeping them out of the human world.
Yusuke's next case sends him on a rescue mission, where he meets Toguro, a human turned into a demon. In order to test his strength, Toguro invites Yusuke to the [tpl]nihongo|Dark Tournament|暗黒武術会|Ankoku Bujutsukai|"Dark Martial Arts Association"[/tpl], an event put on by corrupt, rich humans in which teams of demons, and occasionally humans, fight fierce battles for the chance to receive any wish they desire. Team Urameshi, consisting of Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, Hiei and a disguised Genkai, traverse through the strenuous early rounds to face Team Toguro in the finals and win the tournament. They learn that Team Toguro's owner, Sakyo, was attempting to win in order to create a large hole from the human world to the Demon Plane and allow countless demons through. With his loss, Sakyo destroys the tournament arena, killing himself in the process.
After the tournament, Yusuke returns home, but has little time to rest as he is challenged to a fight by three teenagers possessing superhuman powers and who end up taking the detective hostage. Kuwabara and the others rescue him and learn that the whole scenario was a test put on by Genkai. It is disclosed that Shinobu Sensui, Yusuke's predecessor as Underworld Detective, has recruited six other powerful beings to help him take over where Sakyo left off, opening a hole to the Demon Plane in order to cause genocide of the human race. Yusuke and his friends challenge and defeat Sensui's associates one-by-one, culminating in a final battle between the two detectives. Sensui kills Yusuke then retreats into the newly opened portal to the Demon Plane. Yusuke is reborn as a partial demon, discovering that his ancestor passed down a recessive gene that would hide until an heir with sufficient power surfaced, when his demonic lineage would be revealed. Yusuke travels to the Demon Plane and defeats Sensui with the aid of the spirit of his ancestor who takes control of Yusuke's body to finish the fight.
As they return to the human world, Yusuke is stripped of his detective title as King Enma orders he be captured and executed in fear that Yusuke's demon blood could cause him to go on a rampage in the human world. Yusuke, unsettled at having been controlled by his ancestor Raizen, accepts an offer by Raizen's followers to return to the Demon Plane. Raizen, desiring a successor to his territory, is on the brink of dying of starvation, a death that would topple the delicate political balance of the three ruling powers of the Demon Plane. Hiei and Kurama are summoned by the other two rulers, Mukuro and Yomi, respectively, to prepare for an inevitable war. The three protagonists train in the realm for one year, during which time Raizen dies and Yusuke inherits his territory. Yusuke takes initiative and proposes a fighting tournament to name the true ruler of the Demon Plane, which is agreed upon by Mukuro and Yomi. During the tournament, Yusuke and Yomi meet in the second elimination round where Yusuke is defeated and knocked unconscious. Yusuke awakens days later to find that the tournament has ended and that a similar competition is to be held every so often to determine the Demon Plane's ruler. Yusuke stays in the Demon Plane for a while longer, but eventually returns to the human world to be with Keiko.

==Production==

Author Yoshihiro Togashi stated that he began working on YuYu Hakusho during a period of time around November 1990, though he forgot the exact time.[tpl]cite book|title=Seisaku Hakusho ("The Production Report")|publisher=Viz Media|first=Yoshihiro|last=Togashi|authorlink=Yoshihiro Togashi|page=94|title=YuYu Hakusho|volume=1|isbn=1-56931-904-9|date=May 2003[/tpl] As a fan of the occult and horror films, he desired to write and illustrate a manga based on his interests.[tpl]cite journal |title=Interview: Yoshihiro Togashi | journal=Shonen Jump |date=May 2003 | publisher=Viz Media |location=San Francisco, CA | volume=1 | issue=5 |issn=1545-7818[/tpl] Togashi had previously published an occult detective fiction manga titled Occult Tanteidan, of which he referenced positive reception from readers as a reason for continuing to create manga.[tpl]cite book|publisher=Shueisha|first=Yoshihiro|last=Togashi|page=37|title=狼なんて怖くない!! Not Afraid of the Wolf!!|isbn=4-08-871336-2|date=October 1989|language=Japanese[/tpl] When first producing YuYu Hakusho, he did not have a clear idea of what he wanted to call it. He used the tentative title "How to be a Ghost" while presenting rough drafts to his editors. Once given the go-ahead to begin publication, Togashi proposed "YuYu-Ki (Poltergeist Chronicles)" for the title, as there would be battles with demons and it would be a play on the title SaiYu-Ki. Because a series with a similar name (Chin-Yu-Ki) had already begun publication, Togashi quickly created an alternative: "YuYu Hakusho (Poltergeist Report)".[tpl]cite book|publisher=Viz Media|first=Yoshihiro|last=Togashi|page=5|title=YuYu Hakusho|volume=1|isbn=1-56931-904-9|date=May 2003[/tpl] He commented that he could have used "Den (Legend)" or "Monogatari (Story)", but "Hakusho (Report)" was the first thing that came to his mind.[tpl]cite book |last=Togashi|first=Yoshihiro|title=Hunter × Hunter|volume=6|date=January 3, 2006 |publisher=Viz Media |page=46|isbn=978-1-4215-0185-7[/tpl] He contiguously developed the names of the main characters by skimming through a dictionary and taking out kanji characters he found appealing. "Yusuke Urameshi" is a pun, "Kazuma Kuwabara" is a combination of two professional baseball players, and "Hiei" and "Kurama" are "just names that popped into Togashi's head". When he introduced the latter two characters in volume three, the author had early plans to make Kurama a main character but was not certain about Hiei.
The manga's shift from occult detective fiction to the martial arts genre after Yusuke's death and revival in the early chapters was planned by Togashi from the beginning. The series borrows many elements from Asian folklore, particularly Buddhist beliefs in the afterlife. Togashi came up with the concept of the Ningenkai (human world), Reikai (Underworld), and Makai (Demon Plane) as being parallel planes of existence in the YuYu Hakusho universe. He thought of them as places that one could not easily travel between using modern technology, but rather as a spirit lacking a material body. However, the idea for the "territory" powers from the Sensui story arc was parodied from a separate, unnamed work by Yasutaka Tsutsui.[tpl]cite book|title=Assault Interview: Ask the Author! | series=ヨシりんでポン！de Pon! |first=Yoshihiro|last=Togashi|pages=10–1|year=1994|language=Japanese[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi|authorlink=Masashi Kishimoto|title=NARUTO―ナルト―秘伝·皆の書オフィシャルプレミアムファンBOOK|series=Naruto|date=December 4, 2009|publisher=Shueisha|location=Japan|language=Japanese|isbn=978-4-08-874834-4|pages=74–81[/tpl] For his drawing materials, Togashi used drafting ink and Kabura pens throughout the creation of the series. While his style of artwork began with screentone, he gradually developed into minimalism. As the series progressed, he would draw figures and faces very detailed or "cartoony, sketchy and jumping with action" whenever he desired such effects.
During the years he worked on YuYu Hakusho, Togashi would calculate the personal time he had based on a formula of four hours per page without scripting and five hours of sleep per night.[tpl]cite book|first=Jason|last=Thompson|authorlink=Jason Thompson (writer)|title=Manga: The Complete Guide|publisher=Ballantine Books & Del Rey Books|location=New York|year=2007|isbn=978-0-345-48590-8 | page=xii[/tpl] He wrote in his own dōjinshi Yoshirin de Pon! that he stopped the production on YuYu Hakusho out of selfishness.[tpl]cite book|title=Yoshihiro Togashi Speaks | series=ヨシりんでポン！de Pon! |first=Yoshihiro|last=Togashi|pages=13–4|year=1994|language=Japanese[/tpl] The author had originally wanted to end the manga in December 1993, at the climax of the Sensui arc. Although there was not a large demand from the editorial staff, Togashi was under a great deal of personal stress at certain points of the series' run, particularly during its final six months of publication. He claimed that, beginning with the Dark Tournament arc, inconsistent sleep resulting from overwork was causing him health problems. He noted himself as being very ill while working on the color pages for Yusuke's match with Chu. There were also many instances where he would create nearly entire manuscripts by himself, such as Yusuke's meeting with Raizen and the battle between Kurama and Karasu. Togashi was relieved at the conclusion of the manga.

[tpl]As of|2013|February[/tpl], YuYu Hakusho has sold more than 50 million copies in Japan alone, making it one of Weekly Shonen Jump's best-selling manga series.[tpl]cite web | url=http://adnavi.shueisha.co.jp/mediaguide/2013/pdf/boys.pdf | title=Shueisha Media Guide 2013: Boy's & Men's Comic Magazines | publisher=Shueisha | accessdate=December 5, 2013 | language=Japanese[/tpl] Patricia Duffield, a columnist for Animerica Extra, acknowledged the manga as "one of the kings of popularity in the mid-1990s" in the region where it saw mass availability from large bookstore chains to small train station kiosks.[tpl]cite journal |last1=Duffield |first1=Patricia |date=September 2001 |title=Yû Yû Hakusho |journal=Animerica Extra |volume=4 |issue=10 | url=http://www.mindspring.com/~theduffields/resume/articles/indepths/yu_yu_hakusho.htm | publisher=Viz Media | issn=1533-1822[/tpl] YuYu Hakusho earned Yoshihiro Togashi the Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen in 1993.[tpl]cite web | url=http://comics.shogakukan.co.jp/mangasho/rist.html | title=小学館漫画賞：歴代受賞者 |trans_title=Shogakukan Manga Award: Past winners | publisher=Shogakukan | language=Japanese | accessdate=August 19, 2007[/tpl] Towards the end of the series' run, Togashi was publicly criticized for not meeting chapter deadlines and for lower quality art.[tpl]cite book|author=Amano, Masanao | coauthor=Wiedemann, Julius|title=Manga Design|publisher=Taschen|year=2004|pages=366–9|isbn=978-3-8228-2591-4[/tpl]
In North America, several volumes of the manga have ranked within the weekly Nielsen BookScan graphic novels list, including volume five at both sixth and ninth in October 2004, volume six at sixth in February 2005, and volume seven at seventh in June 2005.[tpl]cite web | date=October 14, 2004 | title='Fruits Basket' Stays on Top | url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/5856.html | publisher=ICv2 | accessdate=December 3, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web | date=November 1, 2004 | title=Negima Tops Bookstore GN Chart | url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/5938.html | publisher=ICv2 | accessdate=December 3, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web | date=February 18, 2005 | title=D.N.Angel Tops BookScan List | url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/6457.html | publisher=ICv2 | accessdate=December 3, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web | date=June 24, 2005 | title='Fruits Basket' Tops Bookstore Sales | url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/7091.html | publisher=ICv2 | accessdate=December 3, 2009[/tpl] In 2004, the YuYu Hakusho manga serialization sparked a controversy when a Florida grade school teacher issued a complaint about material found in an issue of the American Shonen Jump magazine purchased by a fifth-grade student at a Scholastic Book Fair. The complaint centered around portions of the manga containing violence, mild profanity, a character wearing a swastika, and another character smoking a cigarette. About 18,000 copies of the publication (out of 120,000) were returned from the fairs as a result of the matter. A Viz spokesperson defended the manga, clarifying that it is intended for older teens and that the alleged swastika is actually a Buddhist manji.[tpl]cite web | author=Reid, Calvin | date=April 5, 2004 | title=Viz manga pulled from some Scholastic Fairs (Cultural Clash) | url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-20978253_ITM | publisher=Publishers Weekly | accessdate=April 23, 2010[/tpl]
The YuYu Hakusho manga publication has received mixed criticism by reviewers in English-speaking regions. Martin Ouellette of the Canadian Protoculture Addicts compared the progression of the series to Dragon Ball Z and stated, "Togashi's art, while simple, is extremely efficient and the story is really fun."[tpl]cite journal | journal=Protoculture Addicts | publisher=Protoculture Inc. | title=Manga Reviews: Yu Yu Hakusho, Vol. 1 | issue=79 | url=http://www.protoculture.ca/PA/PA79Rwm.htm#15 | date=November–December 2003 | issn=0835-9563[/tpl] An older article by the same reviewer disagreed with the notion that YuYu Hakusho was similar to Dragon Ball, stating that the former franchise has better developed characters, more interesting action sequences, and more humor. Eduardo M. Chavez of Mania.com enjoyed the manga's artwork and found that the supporting characters tend to be illustrated with more detail than the main characters. He praised Lillian Olsen's English translation, but disliked Viz's use of overlaying English words to translate the expression of sound effects. In later volumes Chavez was dismayed by the transition of the manga from the early detective cases to the Dark Tournament arc. He asserted, "Seeing fight, after fight, after fight gets boring and this seriously is only the start of this trend."[tpl]cite web | author=Chavez, Eduardo M. | date=May 24, 2005 | title=Yu Yu Hakusho Vol. #05 | url=http://www.mania.com/yu-yu-hakusho-vol-05_article_82225.html | publisher=Mania.com | accessdate=December 6, 2009[/tpl] Dan Polley, a staff reviewer of Manga Life, gave an average grade to the fifth volume, which entails Yusuke's battle with Suzaku, the leader of the Four Beasts. Although he found some the battle sequences to be inviting, he judged the chapters as lacking in characterization and development. Polley also discounted the manga's comedy, considering the "bit gags or fairly lame jokes" to be "too much" at times.[tpl]Cite web |author=Polley, Dan |title=Yuyu Hakusho v5 Review |url=http://www.mangalife.com/reviews/YuyuHakushov5.htm |work=Manga Life |accessdate=January 4, 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071013065516/www.mangalife.com/reviews/YuyuHakushov5.htm |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes [/tpl]

The animated series received a generally positive reception in North America.  In January 2004, YuYu Hakusho was named the second best action-adventure anime by Anime Insider.[tpl]cite journal |date=January 2004 |title=Anime Insider's Best of Action-Adventure |journal=Anime Insider |issue=11 |publisher=Wizard Entertainment[/tpl] It was voted by the users of IGN as the tenth best animated series of all time.[tpl]cite web | author=Fowler, Matt | date=March 18, 2009 | title=Readers' Choice: IGN's Top Animated Series | url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/964/964034p1.html | publisher=IGN | accessdate=September 6, 2009[/tpl] Critical reviews focused on the series' attempt at a versatile balance of narrative, character development, and action sequences. Animerica's Justin Kovalsky defined YuYu Hakusho as a character-driven series and compared it to other anime like Phantom Quest Corp., Rurouni Kenshin, and Flame of Recca in that it successfully combines different ideas such as martial arts battles, character dynamics, the supernatural, and mythology. Allen Divers of the Anime News Network identified YuYu Hakusho as "one of the best action series out there", and noted consistently good storytelling and character development throughout his critique of key points of the series.[tpl]cite web | author=Divers, Allen | date=April 16, 2002 | title=Yu Yu Hakusho DVD 1 - Review  | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/yu-yu-hakusho/dvd-1 | publisher=Anime News Network | accessdate=January 2, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author=Divers, Allen | date=April 21, 2002 | title=Yu Yu Hakusho DVD 2 - Review  | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/yu-yu-hakusho/dvd-2 | publisher=Anime News Network | accessdate=January 2, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author=Divers, Allen | date=October 3, 2003 | title=Yu Yu Hakusho DVD 16-17 - Review  | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/yu-yu-hakusho/dvd-16-17 | publisher=Anime News Network | accessdate=January 2, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author=Divers, Allen | date=February 18, 2004 | title=Yu Yu Hakusho DVD - Review  | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/yu-yu-hakusho/dvd | publisher=Anime News Network | accessdate=January 2, 2010[/tpl] Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk declared, "It's a fun show with a great cast, a sense of humor, and a lot of action so there's no excuse not to at least give it a chance." He recommended the first three season box sets of YuYu Hakusho, as well as the original boxset of the Three Kings Saga, but enjoyed the show's third season more than the others because of its multiple plotlines.[tpl]cite web | author=Douglass Jr., Todd | date=September 28, 2008 | title=Yu Yu Hakusho: Season One Box Set: DVD Talk Review | url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/34817/yu-yu-hakusho-season-one-box-set/ | publisher=DVD Talk | accessdate=December 4, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author=Douglass Jr., Todd | date=October 2, 2008 | title=Yu Yu Hakusho: Season Two Set: DVD Talk Review | url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/34928/yu-yu-hakusho-season-two-set/ | publisher=DVD Talk | accessdate=December 4, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author=Douglass Jr., Todd | date=November 30, 2008 | title=Yu Yu Hakusho: Season Three Set: DVD Talk Review | url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/35584/yu-yu-hakusho-season-three-set/ | publisher=DVD Talk | accessdate=December 4, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author=Douglass Jr., Todd | date=May 9, 2006 | title=Yu Yu Hakusho - The Saga of the Three Kings  | url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/21592/yu-yu-hakusho-the-saga-of-the-three-kings/ | publisher=DVD Talk | accessdate=December 4, 2009[/tpl] N. S. Davidson of IGN concluded that having several concurrent plot branches is not enough for an anime to succeed, but that good writing, interesting characters, and action are also necessary. He proclaimed in his review of the anime's final episodes that YuYu Hakusho possesses all of these qualities.[tpl]cite web | author=Davidson, N.

The only thing that doesn't change throughout its run is the fact that you'll still be rooting for the well-defined protagonists until the credits run on the last episode."[tpl]Cite web |author=Luster, Joseph |date=December 27, 2007 |title=Yu Yu Hakusho: Eight Finalists |url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/Main/News1/1030.aspx |publisher=Otaku USA |accessdate=January 1, 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110718230627/www.otakuusamagazine.com/Main/News1/1030.aspx |archivedate=July 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes [/tpl]
Jeffrey Harris of IGN was more critical when looking at later episodes, and felt that the end of the show's third arc involving the villain Sensui is too similar to the finale of the second arc with Toguro. He described the episodes as trying too hard to draw sympathy from the audience for anime's villains.[tpl]cite web | author=Harris, Jeffrey | date=October 22, 2007 | title=Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files - Seven Sins | url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/829/829261p1.html | publisher=IGN | accessdate=December 6, 2009[/tpl] Despite his overall praise of YuYu Hakusho, Divers likewise summarized in one DVD release that the show "walks that fine line of a solid long running series or being a broken record". He also called the artwork of the first few episodes "dated" and pointed out questionable script choices regarding the English dub.
