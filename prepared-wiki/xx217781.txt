The Amethyst Initiative is an organization made up of U.S. college presidents and chancellors that in July 2008 launched a movement calling for the reconsideration of U.S. legal drinking age, particularly the minimum age of 21. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984  requires all US states to raise their minimum age for purchase and public possession of alcohol to 21 or face a reduction in highway funds under the Federal-Aid Highway Act. The Amethyst Initiative was initiated by John McCardell, founder of Choose Responsibility,[tpl]cite web |url=http://blog.chooseresponsibility.org/cr-news/cr-announces-amethyst-initiative |title=Choose Responsibility announces Amethyst Initiative |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26[/tpl] a former professor of history at Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont and current Vice-Chancellor of Sewanee: The University of the South, and is currently supported by 135 college presidents who signed a statement proclaiming, "It’s time to rethink the drinking age".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.amethystinitiative.org |title=Amethyst Initiative front page|format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080828030259/http://www.amethystinitiative.org/| archivedate= 28 August 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]The Associated Press [tpl]cite web |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jWXhmLxHPcv8q_iFiN7nLt7RP8CgD92L2IIO0 |title=College presidents seek debate on drinking age |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080821225406/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jWXhmLxHPcv8q_iFiN7nLt7RP8CgD92L2IIO0| archivedate= 21 August 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
According to Greek and Roman legend, amethysts protected their owners from drunkenness.

==Purpose==

The Amethyst Initiative states that, in their experience as university presidents, they have observed, "Alcohol education that mandates abstinence as the only legal option has not resulted in significant constructive behavioral change among our students," and therefore they urge lawmakers "to invite new ideas about the best ways to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.amethystinitiative.org/statement |title=Amethyst Initiative » Statement|format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080902032504/http://www.amethystinitiative.org/statement| archivedate= 2 September 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Gustavus Adolphus College President Jack R. Ohle said in a statement that the initiative is not about lowering the drinking age, but to open a debate on alcohol policies that affect young people and their choices about alcohol use. [tpl]quotation|We need serious, sustained, unfettered debate about the drinking age and the reality of life on a college campus and how these two things are aligned. I signed the statement in hopes that it would encourage debate on our campus about the seriousness of drinking in general but more importantly the high-risk drinking that has become so common on college campuses today. As an educator, I feel a responsibility to encourage a discussion about responsibility. That responsibility rests with not only the students but with those of us who work to provide for their education, safety, and well being. We must engage in civil, informed, and dispassionate debate and consider all policy alternatives no matter how controversial.[tpl]cite web |url=http://gustavus.edu/news/4168 |title=Statement from President Ohle Regarding Amethyst Initiative | publisher =  Gustavus Adolphus College |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-19[/tpl][/tpl]

==Criticism==

The initiative has been criticized by several groups and government and industry officials, including Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). Joining MADD's criticism are other groups, including the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the American Medical Association, and the National Transportation Safety Board.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/08-19-2008/0004869764&EDATE= |title=MADD press release: Some University Presidents Shirk Responsibility to Protect Students from Dangers of Underage Drinking |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-19| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080823001726/http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/08-19-2008/0004869764&EDATE=| archivedate= 23 August 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
A spokesman for the Governors Highway Safety Association told the Washington Post that university leaders "are really just punting on the issue and leaving the high school principals to deal with it.""Lower drinking age is criticized" (free registration required), Washington Post, August 1, 2008 However, Amethyst Initiative's parent organization, Choose Responsibility, proposes that only high school graduates should be eligible.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/proposal |title=Choose Responsibility: drinking age proposals|format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26[/tpl]
In a press release, MADD argues that lowering the drinking age would result in greater numbers of fatal automobile accidents, and that the presidents are "looking for an easy way out of an inconvenient problem" and "misrepresenting science."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.madd.org/Article-Archive/2008/August/Article---Amethyst-Initiative-Underage-Drinking-Re.aspx |title= Mothers Against Drunk Driving - Amethyst Initiative Underage Drinking Response |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-19[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] MADD cited former U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary, and current University of Miami president Donna Shalala statement that "maintaining the legal drinking age at 21 is a socially and medically sound policy that helps parents, schools and law enforcement protect our youth from the potentially life-threatening effects of underage drinking."
Choose Responsibility argues that scientific evidence supports the Amethyst Initiative's views and goals.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/article/view/17294/1/2638 |title=Legal Age 21 - National Minimum Drinking Age - FAQ with citations |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/article/view/17305/1/2643 |title=Drinking and Culture: International Comparisons with citations |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/article/view/17312/1/2648 |title=Drunken Driving Fatalities with citations|format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26[/tpl] and refutes some of MADD's past claims.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/myths_realities_c/ |title=Myths and Realities about drinking with citations |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/article/view/19785/1/2635/ |title=Not Convinced? |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-08-26[/tpl]
Radley Balko, of Reason, wryly noted inconsistency opponents of the Amethyst Initiative believe that it "would be a "national tragedy" to, for example, allow 19- and 20-year-old men and women returning from Iraq and Afghanistan to have a beer in celebration of completing their tours of duty."[tpl]cite news | last =Balko | first =Radley  | title =Amethyst Initiative's Debate on Drinking a Welcome Alternative to Fanaticism | newspaper =Fox News | date =August 25, 2008| url =http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,410283,00.html | accessdate = [/tpl]  Balko also noted research showing that underage drinking laws had not reduced highway deaths.[tpl]cite journal | last =Miron | first =Jeffrey A.  |author2=Elina Tetelbaum | title =DOES THE MINIMUM LEGAL DRINKING AGE SAVE LIVES? | journal=Economic Inquiry| publisher =National Bureau of Economic Research | volume =  NBER Working Paper No. 13257 | date =July 2007 | url =http://www.nber.org/papers/w13257 | accessdate = [/tpl]

Chancellor Joe Gow said this vote, "certainly defies the 'conventional wisdom' regarding young people being eager to lower the drinking age."
