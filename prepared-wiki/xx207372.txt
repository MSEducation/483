The Bezirksliga Main-Hessen was the highest association football league in the German state of Hesse and the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau from 1923 to 1927, when the league was replaced by the Bezirksliga Main-Hessen.

==Overview==

The league was formed in 1923, after a league reform which was decided upon in Darmstadt, Hesse.History of the Offenburger Fußballverein (in German) Page 5, accessed: 23 July 2008 It replaced the Kreisliga Nordmain and the Kreisliga Südmain as the highest leagues in the region. Apart from clubs from Hesse, with the Viktoria Aschaffenburg, the league also included one club from Bavaria.
The Bezirksliga Main, named after the river Main,  started out with eight teams, playing each other in a home-and-away round with the league winner advancing to the Southern German championship, which in turn was a qualification tournament for the German championship.  
The league modus remained unchanged for its first three seasons, 1923–24, 1924–25 and 1925-26. For its last edition however, it expanded to ten clubs. Additionally, the leagues runners-up also qualified for a "consolidation" round with the other runners-up of the southern Bezirksligas. The winner of this round was awarded the third entry spot for the south to the German finals.
In an attempt to bring all Southern German leagues to a similar system, the Bezirksligas were reorganised in 1927. For the Bezirksliga Main, this meant, it joined with the northern clubs of the Bezirksliga Rheinhessen-Saar to form the new Bezirksliga Main-Hessen. In practice, this meant little change for the league as the new Bezirksliga was immediately sub-divided into two independent, regional divisions. Out of the ten clubs in the league, nine went to the new Bezirksliga Main-Hessen - Main division, only the VfL Neu-Isenburg found itself grouped into the Hessen division of the new league.
