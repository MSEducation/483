The plot of The Prince of the Pagodas was written by John Cranko and has some parallels to the Shakespeare
play King Lear. In The Prince of the Pagodas, an Emperor must decide which of his two daughters should inherit the throne, and he chooses the evil older sister Belle Epine over the young and beautiful Belle Rose. Belle Rose is taken by magical flying frogs to Pagoda Land, and meets the Prince of Pagoda Land disguised as the Salamander. Belle Rose and the Prince return to the land of her
father and confront her evil sister, in the end driving her away.Britten, Benjamin. The Prince of the Pagodas. Published 1957. Boosey & Hawkes.
