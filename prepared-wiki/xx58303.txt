==History==

Orangina started as Naranjina, presented at the 1935 Marseille Trade Fair by its Spanish inventor, chemist Dr. Trigo,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.orangina.eu/en/our-history/|title=The History of Orangina[/tpl] from Valencia, who invented it in 1933. The drink was created from a mix of citrus juice, sugar, and carbonated water. It was later called TriNaranjus (now, TriNa) for the Spanish market. 
Léon Beton bought the concept and recipe for Naranjina in 1935.[tpl]cite news|first=William |last=Yardley |title=Jean-Claude Beton, Who Sent Orangina Around the World, Dies at 88 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/business/jean-claude-beton-who-gave-orangina-its-signature-bottle-dies-at-88.html?_r=0 |work=New York Times |date=2013-12-06 |accessdate=2014-01-05[/tpl] However, the outbreak of major conflicts, notably World War II, largely sidelined Léon Beton's attempts to market his drink in Europe.
His son, Jean-Claude Beton, took over the company from his father in 1947.[tpl]cite news|first=|last=|title=Founder of iconic French soda Orangina dies |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20131204-orangina-soft-drink-founder-dies-beton-marseille-france-coke/ |work=France 24 |date=2013-12-04 |accessdate=2014-01-02[/tpl] Jean-Claude Beton kept most of the original recipe, which he marketed to appeal in European and North African consumers. Orangina quickly became a common beverage throughout French North Africa. In 1951, Jean-Claude Beton introduced Orangina's iconic, signature 8-ounce bottle, which became a symbol of the brand. The bottle is shaped like an orange, with a glass texture designed to mimic the fruit.
Production was moved to the city of Marseille in metropolitan France in 1962 in the run-up to Algeria's independence. Orangina was first launched in the United States in 1978 under the brand name, Orelia, which was later reverted to Orangina. The company, created by Beton, joined the Pernod Ricard group in 1984.
In 2000, the Orangina brand was acquired by Cadbury Schweppes along with Pernod Ricard's other soda businesses, after an attempt to sell to Coca-Cola was blocked on anti-competitive grounds.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/26/business/media-business-advertising-orangina-s-owner-still-wants-sell-brand-if-price.html?pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Orangina's owner still wants to sell brand, if the price is right | first=Constance L. | last=Hays | date=2000-01-26 | accessdate=2010-05-20[/tpl] In 2006 Cadbury plc decided to concentrate on the chocolate business and sought buyers for its soda business. As the number three soda producer globally, neither of the bigger two (Coca-Cola or PepsiCo) could buy it, so eventually the company was split up to sell.

===North America===

In the U.S. and Canada, the brand is owned by Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc, created as a spin-off of Cadbury Schweppes' former North American soft drinks business. The drink was introduced in the United States in 1978 under the name Orelia, but this name was abandoned in favor of the original in 1985.Orangina at Dr Pepper Snapple Group Orangina was originally produced for the North American market in Canada, but the operation was moved to Hialeah, Florida, United States, to be produced under license by Mott's LLP of Rye Brook, New York. Production of Orangina has since moved back to Canada, as Mott's is now part of Dr Pepper Snapple.Wiggins, Jenny. "The inside story of the Cadbury takeover", FT Magazine, 12 March 2010. Orangina for the US market is sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup instead of regular sugar like original Orangina.

===Rest of the world===

From 2006, private equity firms Blackstone Group and Lion Capital LLP owned the brand outside North America under the company name Orangina Schweppes.http://www.officialwire.com/main.php?action=posted_news&rid=116965&catid=1254[tpl]Dead link|date=April 2011[/tpl] In November 2009, its ownership changed once again when it was bought by Japanese brewer Suntory.[tpl]cite news | title=Japan's Suntory snaps up Orangina | date=2009-11-13 | publisher=BBC | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8358674.stm | work =BBC News | accessdate = 2009-11-15 | language = [/tpl]

==Brand owners & distributors==

==Design==

The brand's popularity supposedly derives both from its unique flavor and from the design of its 25 cl (8 oz) bottle made in the shape of a pear with a pebbly texture meant to recall the peel of an orange or other citrus fruit.[tpl]cn|date=June 2012[/tpl] Larger bottles also include the pebbly texture but use a more regular bottle shape rather than maintaining the proportions of the smaller bottles.

==Varieties==

New flavours have emerged in Europe including Orangina Sanguine which is made from blood oranges and also contains caffeine and guarana. It is significantly more sour than regular Orangina. Other flavours such as the series called "les givrés" (which can be translated as both "frosted" and "crazy") are also available in Europe, but rarely seen in North America.

==Advertising==

In 2010 a gay-friendly commercial aired in France,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.invarietateconcordia.net/article-il-faut-bien-la-secouer-sinon-52892582.html |title=Il faut bien la secouer sinon...|work=In Varietate Concordia|date=24 Jun 2010|language=French[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl] shortly after a McDonald’s France advertisement featuring a gay teenager was shown on television.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.invarietateconcordia.net/article-venez-comme-vous-etes-50929278.html|title=Venez comme vous êtes|work=In Varietate Concordia|date=23 May 2010|language=French[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2012[/tpl]
In the 2002 movie "The Transporter" Jason Statham's character Frank Martin is seen purchasing Orangina from a vending machine moments before his car is subsequently blown up. He later offers Lai Kwai, his unexpected captive some.

===Controversy===

In 2008, a commercial featuring anthropomorphic animals (such as a deer, a bear, peacocks, and chameleons) in swimsuits, caused outrage in the UK for its sexually suggestive content. In the video, the animals gyrate around poles, spray the drink onto the breasts of other animals, and ride bottles which then explode. The advert had already had 45 seconds of more provocative footage cut, and was only to be shown after the 9 o'clock watershed, initially during a programme titled How to Look Good Naked.
Kidscape, a UK-based children's charity, criticised the advert, saying, "Orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people, but this new advert places the product in a very sexualised and provocative context".'Sexual' Orangina ad angers viewers and children's charity, The Independent, Sunday, 24 August 2008 The advert has also been awarded 'Freakiest Advert of 2008' and was 7th place in 'Worst TV Ad of 2008'.[tpl]cite web|url=http://adweek.blogs.com/adfreak/freakiest2007/index.html|title=FREAKY AD MOMENTS OF 2007, SWEET 16|work=Adweek[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/organgrinder/2008/dec/11/advertising-television|title=Organ Grinder: The worst TV ads of 2008 | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney | date=2008-12-11 | accessdate=2010-05-20[/tpl]
