==Life==

He was born at Youghal on 16 April 1800.Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland Journal, 1861, p. 263. Through his mother he claimed descent from the regicide John Cooke.
He is best known for two works The Natural History of Society (1841) and Factories and the Factory System (1844). In the early 1840s he toured the northern English industrial centres and wrote considerably for the Anti-Corn Law LeagueCHALONER, W. H. in his introduction to the 1968 third edition of Cook Taylor’s Notes of a tour in the manufacturing districts of Lancashire and his observations of the factories of Manchester and Bolton provide a first hand account of the depression at that time. In 1843 he became the editor of Anti-Corn Law’s ‘The League’.CHALONER, W. H. in his introduction to the 1968 third edition of Cook Taylor’s Notes  of a tour in the manufacturing districts of Lancashire  He was extremely hostile to chartism and his defence of child labour in factories (on the grounds that it was preferable to starvation) attracted much hostile criticism.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]
He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin and gained a BA in 1825 and an LL.D in 1835.The Gentleman's Magazine, 1850, p94-6. In 1829 he moved to London and began to contribute regularly to journals such as the Athenaeum of which he was deputy editor, Bentley’s Miscellany and The Art Journal. In London he worked as a writer for hire or, as his obituaryObituary from the Dublin University MagazineObituary from the Gentleman's Magazine puts it, "a writer for his daily bread". He published profusely throughout his career, writing on religion, history and a number of biographies, most notably that of Sir Robert Peel.
In Irish politics Taylor was a Whig, fiercely critical of the Penal Laws and supporting Catholic emancipation, but believing that continued union with Britain would bring about rapid political and economic modernisation.  He was a strong advocate of the professedly non-denominational National School system, and his economic and religious views were heavily influenced by Richard Whately. Cooke Taylor was on friendly terms with Thomas Davis, whom he respected as a fellow-Trinity graduate, but in 1847-8 he engaged in government-sponsored journalism denouncing the Young Irelanders as communists, and was accused by Charles Gavan Duffy of having been hired to defame his country. This was unjust; while Taylor worked as a hired pen, it was for causes that he believed in.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]
He returned to Ireland for the last two years of his life where he worked as a statistician for the Irish Government before he died of cholera in 1849.
He was the son of Richard Taylor, a Youghal manufacturer and he married Marianne Taylor, his first cousin. He had four children, three girls and a boy, Richard Whateley Cook Taylor, a factory inspector who also went on to write about the factory system in his book Introduction to a history of the factory system.Introduction to a history of the factory system (1886)
Taylor died at 20 Herbert Street, Dublin on 12 September 1849.
