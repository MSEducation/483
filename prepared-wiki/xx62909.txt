It attacks female monarchs, arguing that rule by females is contrary to the Bible.

==Title==

The title employs certain words in spellings and senses that are now archaic.  "Monstruous" (from Latin monstruosus) means "unnatural"; "regiment" (Latin regimentum or regimen) means "rule" or "government".  The title is frequently found with the spelling slightly modernised, e.g. "monstrous regiment" or "monstrous regimen".

The book was written anonymously from Geneva, Switzerland, against the female sovereigns of his day, particularly Mary of Guise, Dowager Queen of Scotland and regent to her daughter Mary, Queen of Scots, and Queen Mary I of England. Knox, a staunch Protestant Reformer, opposed the Catholic queens on religious grounds, and used them as examples to argue against female rule over men generally. Building on his premise that, according to Knox's understanding of the Bible, "God, by the order of his creation, has deprived woman of authority and dominion" and from history that "man has seen, proved, and pronounced just causes why it should be", he argued the following with regard to the specific role of women bearing authority:
His diatribe against female rulers backfired on him when Elizabeth I succeeded her half-sister Mary I as Queen of England; Elizabeth was a supporter of the Protestant cause, but took offence at Knox's words about female sovereigns. Her opposition to him personally became an obstacle to Knox's direct involvement with the Protestant cause in England after 1559.
