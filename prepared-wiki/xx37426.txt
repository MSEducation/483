Yue or Yueh ([tpl]IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|juː|eɪ[/tpl] or [tpl]IPAc-en|juː|ˈ|eɪ[/tpl]"Yueh", Webster's Third International Dictionary.) is a primary branch of Chinese spoken in southern China, particularly the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi.
The name Cantonese is often used, but linguists prefer to reserve that name for the Yue dialect of Guangzhou (Canton) and Hong Kong, which is the prestige dialect.
The Cantonese and Taishanese dialects of Yue are spoken by substantial overseas populations in Southeast Asia, Canada, Australia, and the United States.
Yue is mutually unintelligible with other varieties of Chinese.
They are among the most conservative varieties with regard to the final consonants and tonal categories of Middle Chinese, but have lost several distinctions in the initial and medial consonants that other dialects have retained.

==Names==

The prototypical use of the name "Cantonese" in English is for the Guangzhou (Canton) dialect of Yue,[tpl]OED|Cantonese[/tpl] but it is commonly used for Yue as a whole. To avoid confusion, academic texts may call the primary branch of Chinese "Yue",Ethnologue: "Yue Chinese"; "Yue" or older "Yüeh" in the OED; ISO code yue[tpl]sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=98[/tpl] following the Mandarin pinyin spelling, and either restrict "Cantonese" to its common usage as the dialect of Guangzhou, or avoid the term "Cantonese" altogether and distinguish Yue from Canton or Guangzhou dialect.
In Chinese, people of Hong Kong, of Macau, and Cantonese immigrants abroad usually call their language Gwóngdùng wá [tpl]IPA-yue|kʷɔ̌ːŋ tʊ́ŋ wǎː|[/tpl] (廣東話) "speech of Guangdong".[tpl]efn|廣東話: Yale Gwóngdùng wá, Jyutping Gwong2 dung1 waa2, Mandarin pinyin Guǎngdōng huà[/tpl] People of Guangdong and Guangxi do not use that term, but rather Yuht Yúh [tpl]IPA-yue|jỳt jy̬ː|[/tpl] (粵語) "Yue language". They also use baahk wá [tpl]IPA-yue|pàːk wǎː|[/tpl] ([tpl]lang|zh|[tpl]linktext|白話[/tpl][/tpl]) on its own to refer to the Guangzhou dialect.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] It is also used in Guangxi to refer to Yue dialects, as for example in an expression like "南宁白话", which means the "baak waa of Nanning".[tpl]sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=76, 176[/tpl]

==History==

The area of China south of the Nanling Mountains, known as the Lingnan (roughly modern Guangxi and Guangdong), was originally home to peoples known to the Chinese as the Hundred Yue.
Large-scale Chinese migration to the area began after the Qin conquest of the region in 214 BC.[tpl]sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=1[/tpl]
Successive waves followed at times of upheaval in North China, such as the falls of the Han, Tang and Song dynasties.[tpl]sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=1[/tpl]
The most popular route was via the Xiang River, which the Qin had connected to the Li River by the Lingqu Canal, and thence into the valley of the Xi Jiang (West River).[tpl]sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|pp=2–3[/tpl]
A secondary route followed the Gan River and then the Bei Jiang (North River) into eastern Guangdong.[tpl]sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=2[/tpl]
Yue speakers were later joined by Hakka speakers following the North River route, and Min speakers arriving by sea.[tpl]sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=3[/tpl]
After the fall of Qin, the Lingnan area was part of the independent state of Nanyue for about a century, before being incorporated in the Han empire.[tpl]sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=2[/tpl]
Following the collapse of the Tang dynasty, much of the Yue area became part of the Southern Han, one of the longest-lived states of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms, between 917 and 971.[tpl]sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=2[/tpl]
The waves of Chinese migration also assimilated huge numbers of aborigines, with the result that today's Yue-speaking population is descended from both groups.[tpl]sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=4[/tpl]
The colloquial layers of Yue dialects have a number of elements influenced by the Tai languages formerly spoken widely in the area and still spoken by people such as the Zhuang.[tpl]sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=6[/tpl]

===Rise of Cantonese===

The port city of Guangzhou lies in the Pearl River Delta, with access to the interior via the West River, North River and East River, which converge at the delta.
It has been the economic centre of the Lingnan region since Qin times, when it was an important shipbuilding centre.[tpl]sfnp|Li|2006|pp=19–20[/tpl]
By 660, it was the largest port in China, part of a trade network stretching as far as Arabia.[tpl]sfnp|Li|2006|p=126[/tpl]
During the Southern Song, it also became the cultural centre of the region.[tpl]sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=4[/tpl]
Like many other dialects it developed a distinct literary layer associated with the local tradition of reading the classics.[tpl]sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=5[/tpl]
The Guangzhou dialect (Cantonese) was used in the popular Yuèōu, Mùyú and Nányīn folksong genres, as well as Cantonese opera.[tpl]sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|pp=5–6[/tpl][tpl]sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=99[/tpl]
There was also a small amount of vernacular literature, written with Chinese characters extended with a number of non-traditional characters for Cantonese words.[tpl]sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=99[/tpl]
Guangzhou became the centre of rapidly expanding foreign trade after the maritime ban was lifted, with the British East India Company establishing a chamber of commerce in the city in 1715.[tpl]sfnp|Li|2006|p=126[/tpl]
The ancestors of most of the Chinese population of Hong Kong came from Guangzhou after the territory was ceded to Britain in 1842.
As a result Hong Kong Cantonese, the most widely spoken language in Hong Kong and Macau, is an offshoot of the Guangzhou dialect.[tpl]sfnp|Yue-Hashimoto|1972|p=70[/tpl]
The popularity of Cantonese-language media, Cantopop and the Cinema of Hong Kong has since led to substantial exposure of Cantonese to China and the rest of Asia. On the Mainland, the national policy is to promote Standard Chinese, which is also the medium of instruction in schools.[tpl]sfnp|Zhang|Yang|2004|p=154[/tpl] The place of local Cantonese language and culture remains contentious.  In 2010, a proposal to switch some programming on Guangzhou television from Cantonese to Mandarin was abandoned following public protests.[tpl]sfnp|Bolton|2011|pp=66–68[/tpl]

==Dialects==

Yue dialects are spoken in the southern provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi, an area long dominated culturally and economically by the city of Guangzhou (Canton) at the mouth of the Pearl River.
The Cantonese dialect, also spoken in Hong Kong and Macau, is the prestige variety of Yue.
The influence of Guangzhou has spread westward along the Pearl River system, so that for example the speech of the Guangxi city of Wuzhou some 190 km upstream is much more similar to that of Guangzhou than dialects of coastal districts that are closer but separated from the city by hilly terrain.[tpl]sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=23[/tpl]
One of these coastal dialects, Taishanese, is the most common Yue dialect among overseas communities.[tpl]sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=98[/tpl]
Yue dialects are not all mutually intelligible.[tpl]sfnp|Killingley|1993|p=2[/tpl]
