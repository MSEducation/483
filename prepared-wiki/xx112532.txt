[[Ń]]

Ń (minuscule: ń) is a letter formed by putting an acute accent over the letter N. In the Belarusian Łacinka alphabet, the alphabets of Polish, Kashubian, and the Sorbian languages and the romanization of Khmer it represents [tpl]IPAslink|ɲ[/tpl], which is the same as Czech and Slovak ň, Serbo-Croatian nj, Spanish ñ, Italian gn, Hungarian ny, and Portuguese ''nh.
In Lule Sami it represents /ŋ/.

==In Polish==

In Polish, it appears right after n in the alphabet, but no Polish word begins with this letter, because it may not appear before a vowel (the letter may appear only before a consonant or in the word-final position). In the former case, a digraph ni is used to indicate a palatal (or rather alveolo-palatal) n. If the vowel following is i, only one i appears.
