CATEGORIES: German culture, Fictional German people, National personifications

Der Deutsche Michel (literal. "The German Michael") is a figure representing the national character of the German people, rather as John Bull represents the British and Uncle Sam represent the Americans. 

==Overview==

Such figures differ from those that serve as personifications of the nation itself, as Germania did the German nation and Marianne the French.Eric Hobsbawm, "Mass-Producing Traditions: Europe, 1870â€“1914," in Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger, eds., The Invention of Tradition (Cambridge, 1983), 276.  He is usually depicted wearing a nightcap and nightgown, sometimes in the colours of the German flag, and represents the Germans' conception of themselves, especially in his easy-going nature and Everyman appearance.  In German, Michel is also the short form of Michael, though quite rare today.
