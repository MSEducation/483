Wagner wrote a first draft of the libretto in 1845,Millington (2001) 301 and he had resolved to develop it during a visit he had made to Venice with the Wesendoncks in 1860, where he was inspired by Titian's painting The Assumption of the Virgin.Wagner (1992) 667 Throughout this period (1861–64) Wagner sought to have Tristan und Isolde produced in Vienna.Gregor-Dellin (1983) 321–30 Despite numerous rehearsals, the opera remained unperformed, and gained a reputation as being "impossible" to sing, which added to Wagner's financial problems.Newman (1976) III, 147–8
Wagner's fortunes took a dramatic upturn in 1864, when King Ludwig II succeeded to the throne of Bavaria at the age of 18. The young king, an ardent admirer of Wagner's operas, had the composer brought to Munich.Newman (1976) III, 212–20 The King, who was homosexual, expressed in his correspondence a passionate personal adoration for the composer,[tpl]#tag:ref|E.g. "My dearest Beloved!", "My beloved, my most glorious Friend" and "O Holy One, I worship you".Cited in Gregor-Dellin (1983) 337–8|group=n[/tpl] and Wagner in his responses had no scruples about counterfeiting a similar atmosphere.Gregor-Dellin (1983) 336–8; Gutman (1990) 231–2[tpl]#tag:ref|Wagner excused himself in 1878, when discussing this correspondence with Cosima, by saying "The tone wasn't good, but I didn't set it."Cited in Gregor-Dellin (1983) 338|group=n[/tpl] Ludwig settled Wagner's considerable debts,Gregor-Dellin (1983) 339 and proposed to stage Tristan, Die Meistersinger, the Ring, and the other operas Wagner planned.Gregor-Dellin (1983) 346 Wagner also began to dictate his autobiography, Mein Leben, at the King's request.Wagner (1992) 741 Wagner noted that his rescue by Ludwig coincided with news of the death of his earlier mentor (but later supposed enemy) Giacomo Meyerbeer, and regretted that "this operatic master, who had done me so much harm, should not have lived to see this day."Wagner (1992) 739
After grave difficulties in rehearsal, Tristan und Isolde premiered at the National Theatre in Munich on 10 June 1865, the first Wagner opera premiere in almost 15 years. (The premiere had been scheduled for 15 May, but was delayed by bailiffs acting for Wagner's creditors,Gregor-Dellin (1983) 354 and also because the Isolde, Malvina Schnorr von Carolsfeld, was hoarse and needed time to recover.) The conductor of this premiere was Hans von Bülow, whose wife, Cosima, had given birth in April that year to a daughter, named Isolde, a child not of Bülow but of Wagner.Newman (1976) III, 366
Cosima was 24 years younger than Wagner and was herself illegitimate, the daughter of the Countess Marie d'Agoult, who had left her husband for Franz Liszt.Millington (2001) 32–3 Liszt initially disapproved of his daughter's involvement with Wagner, though nevertheless the two men were friends.Newman (1976) III, 530 The indiscreet affair scandalised Munich, and Wagner also fell into disfavour with many leading members of the court, who were suspicious of his influence on the King.Newman (1976) III, 496 In December 1865, Ludwig was finally forced to ask the composer to leave Munich.Newman (1976) III, 499–501 He apparently also toyed with the idea of abdicating to follow his hero into exile, but Wagner quickly dissuaded him.Newman (1976) III, 538–9

He is dressed in a suit with tailcoat and wears a cravat. He faces and looks down at the woman. His hand rests on the back of the chair.Ludwig installed Wagner at the Villa Tribschen, beside Switzerland's Lake Lucerne.Newman (1976) III, 518–9 Die Meistersinger was completed at Tribschen in 1867, and premiered in Munich on 21 June the following year. At Ludwig's insistence, "special previews" of the first two works of the Ring, Das Rheingold and Die Walküre, were performed at Munich in 1869 and 1870,Millington (2001) 287, 290 but Wagner retained his dream, first expressed in "A Communication to My Friends", to present the first complete cycle at a special festival with a new, dedicated, opera house.Wagner (1994c) 391 and n.; Spotts (1994) 37–40
Minna had died of a heart attack on 25 January 1866 in Dresden. Wagner did not attend the funeral.Gregor-Dellin (1983) 367[tpl]#tag:ref|Wagner claimed to be unable to travel to the funeral due to an "inflamed finger".Gutman (1990) 262|group=n[/tpl] Following Minna's death Cosima wrote to Hans von Bülow on a number of occasions asking him to grant her a divorce, but Bülow refused to concede this. He only consented after she had two more children with Wagner; another daughter, named Eva, after the heroine of Meistersinger, and a son Siegfried, named for the hero of the Ring. The divorce was finally sanctioned, after delays in the legal process, by a Berlin court on 18 July 1870.Hilmes (2011) 118 Richard and Cosima's wedding took place on 25 August 1870.Millington (1992) 17 On Christmas Day of that year, Wagner arranged a surprise performance (its premiere) of the Siegfried Idyll for Cosima's birthday.Millington (1992) 311[tpl]#tag:ref|Cosima's birthday was 24 December, but she usually celebrated it on Christmas Day.|group=n[/tpl] The marriage to Cosima lasted to the end of Wagner's life.
Wagner, settled into his new-found domesticity, turned his energies towards completing the Ring cycle. He had not abandoned polemics: he republished his 1850 pamphlet "Judaism in Music", originally issued under a pseudonym, under his own name in 1869. He extended the introduction, and wrote a lengthy additional final section. The publication led to several public protests at early performances of Die Meistersinger in Vienna and Mannheim.Weiner (1997) 123

===Bayreuth (1871–76)===

In 1871, Wagner decided to move to Bayreuth, which was to be the location of his new opera house.Gregor-Dellin (1983) 400 The town council donated a large plot of land—the "Green Hill"—as a site for the theatre. The Wagners moved to the town the following year, and the foundation stone for the Bayreuth Festspielhaus ("Festival Theatre") was laid. Wagner initially announced the first Bayreuth Festival, at which for the first time the Ring cycle would be presented complete, for 1873,Spotts (1994) 40 but since Ludwig had declined to finance the project, the start of building was delayed and the proposed date for the festival was deferred. To raise funds for the construction, "Wagner societies" were formed in several cities,Newman (1976) IV, 392–3 and Wagner began touring Germany conducting concerts.Gregor-Dellin (1983) 409–18 By the spring of 1873, only a third of the required funds had been raised; further pleas to Ludwig were initially ignored, but early in 1874, with the project on the verge of collapse, the King relented and provided a loan.Spotts (1994) 45–6; Gregor-Dellin (1983) 418–9 The full building programme included the family home, "Wahnfried", into which Wagner, with Cosima and the children, moved from their temporary accommodation on 18 April 1874.Marek (1981) 156; Gregor-Dellin (1983) 419 The theatre was completed in 1875, and the festival scheduled for the following year. Commenting on the struggle to finish the building, Wagner remarked to Cosima: "Each stone is red with my blood and yours".Cited in Spotts (1994) 54
For the design of the Festspielhaus, Wagner appropriated some of the ideas of his former colleague, Gottfried Semper, which he had previously solicited for a proposed new opera house at Munich. Wagner was responsible for several theatrical innovations at Bayreuth; these include darkening the auditorium during performances, and placing the orchestra in a pit out of view of the audience.Spotts (1994) 11
The Festspielhaus finally opened on 13 August 1876 with Das Rheingold, at last taking its place as the first evening of the complete Ring cycle; the 1876 Bayreuth Festival therefore saw the premiere of the complete cycle, performed as a sequence as the composer had intended.Millington (1992) 287 The 1876 Festival consisted of three full Ring cycles (under the baton of Hans Richter).Spotts (1994) 61–2 At the end, critical reactions ranged between that of the Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg, who thought the work "divinely composed", and that of the French newspaper Le Figaro, which called the music "the dream of a lunatic".Spotts (1994) 71–2 Amongst the disillusioned were Wagner's friend and disciple Friedrich Nietzsche, who, having published his eulogistic essay "Richard Wagner in Bayreuth" before the festival as part of his Untimely Meditations, was bitterly disappointed by what he saw as Wagner's pandering to increasingly exclusivist German nationalism; his breach with Wagner began at this time.Newman (1976) IV, 517–39 The festival firmly established Wagner as an artist of European, and indeed world, importance: attendees included Kaiser Wilhelm I, the Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, Anton Bruckner, Camille Saint-Saëns and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.Spotts (1994) 66–7
Wagner was far from satisfied with the Festival; Cosima recorded that months later, his attitude towards the productions was "Never again, never again!"Cosima Wagner (1994) 270 Moreover, the festival finished with a deficit of about 150,000 marks.Newman (1976) IV, 542. This was equivalent at the time to about $37,500. The expenses of Bayreuth and of Wahnfried meant that Wagner still sought additional sources of income by conducting or taking on commissions such as the Centennial March for America, for which he received $5000.Gregor-Dellin (1983) 422; Newman (1976) IV, 475

===Last years (1876–83)===

Following the first Bayreuth Festival, Wagner began work on Parsifal, his final opera. The composition took four years, much of which Wagner spent in Italy for health reasons.Millington (2001) 18 From 1876 to 1878 Wagner also embarked on the last of his documented emotional liaisons, this time with Judith Gautier, whom he had met at the 1876 Festival.Newman (1976) IV, 605–7 Wagner was also much troubled by problems of financing Parsifal, and by the prospect of the work being performed by other theatres than Bayreuth. He was once again assisted by the liberality of King Ludwig, but was still forced by his personal financial situation in 1877 to sell the rights of several of his unpublished works (including the Siegfried Idyll) to the publisher Schott.Newman (1976) IV, 607–10
thumb|right|The Wagner grave in the Wahnfried garden; in 1977 Cosima's ashes were placed alongside Wagner's body|alt=Several floral tributes are laid on a flat gravestone that is in the middle of a large bed full of low leafy plants. A crazy-paved path passes either side of the bed.Wagner wrote a number of articles in his later years, often on political topics, and often reactionary in tone, repudiating some of his earlier, more liberal, views. These include "Religion and Art" (1880) and "Heroism and Christianity" (1881), which were printed in the journal Bayreuther Blätter, published by his supporter Hans von Wolzogen.Millington (2001) 331–2, 409. The later essays and articles are reprinted in Wagner (1995e). Wagner's sudden interest in Christianity at this period, which infuses Parsifal, was contemporary with his increasing alignment with German nationalism, and required on his part, and the part of his associates, "the rewriting of some recent Wagnerian history", so as to represent, for example, the Ring as a work reflecting Christian ideals.Stanley (2008) 154–6 Many of these later articles, including "What is German?" (1878, but based on a draft written in the 1860s),Wagner (1995a) 149–70 repeated Wagner's antisemitic preoccupations.
Wagner completed Parsifal in January 1882, and a second Bayreuth Festival was held for the new opera, which premiered on 26 May.Millington (2001) 19 Wagner was by this time extremely ill, having suffered a series of increasingly severe angina attacks.Gutman (1990) 414–7 During the sixteenth and final performance of Parsifal on 29 August, he entered the pit unseen during act 3, took the baton from conductor Hermann Levi, and led the performance to its conclusion.Newman (1976) IV, 692
After the festival, the Wagner family journeyed to Venice for the winter. Wagner died of a heart attack at the age of 69 on 13 February 1883 at Ca' Vendramin Calergi, a 16th-century palazzo on the Grand Canal.Newman (1976) IV, 697, 711–2 The legend that the attack was prompted by argument with Cosima over Wagner's supposedly amorous interest in the singer Carrie Pringle, who had been a Flower-maiden in Parsifal at Bayreuth, is without credible evidence.Cormack (2005) 21–5 After a funerary gondola bore Wagner's remains over the Grand Canal, his body was taken to Germany where it was buried in the garden of the Villa Wahnfried in Bayreuth.Newman (1976) IV, 714–6

==Works==

Wagner's musical output is listed by the Wagner-Werk-Verzeichnis (WWV) as comprising 113 works, including fragments and projects.The WWV is available online in German (accessed 30 October 2012)

===Operas===

Wagner's operatic works are his primary artistic legacy. Unlike most opera composers, who generally left the task of writing the libretto (the text and lyrics) to others, Wagner wrote his own libretti, which he referred to as "poems".Millington (2001) 264–8
From 1849 onwards, he urged a new concept of opera often referred to as "music drama" (although he later rejected this term),Millington (2001) 236–7[tpl]#tag:ref|In his 1872 essay "On the Designation 'Music Drama[tpl]'"[/tpl], he criticises the term "music drama" suggesting instead the phrase "deeds of music made visible".Wagner (1995b) 299–304|group=n[/tpl] in which all musical, poetic and dramatic elements were to be fused together—the Gesamtkunstwerk. Wagner developed a compositional style in which the importance of the orchestra is equal to that of the singers. The orchestra's dramatic role in the later operas includes the use of leitmotifs, musical phrases that can be interpreted as announcing specific characters, locales, and plot elements; their complex interweaving and evolution illuminates the progression of the drama.Millington (2001) 234–5 These operas are still, despite Wagner's reservations, referred to by many writersSee e.g. Dalhaus (1995) 129–36 as "music dramas".See also Millington (2001) 236, 271

====Early works (to 1842)====

Wagner's earliest attempts at opera were often uncompleted. Abandoned works include a pastoral opera based on Goethe's Die Laune des Verliebten (The Infatuated Lover's Caprice), written at the age of 17, Die Hochzeit (The Wedding), on which Wagner worked in 1832, and the singspiel Männerlist größer als Frauenlist (Men are More Cunning than Women, 1837–38). Die Feen (The Fairies, 1833) was unperformed in the composer's lifetime and Das Liebesverbot (The Ban on Love, 1836) was withdrawn after its first performance. Rienzi (1842) was Wagner's first opera to be successfully staged.Millington (2001) 274–6 The compositional style of these early works was conventional—the relatively more sophisticated Rienzi showing the clear influence of Grand Opera à la Spontini and Meyerbeer—and did not exhibit the innovations that would mark Wagner's place in musical history. Later in life, Wagner said that he did not consider these works to be part of his oeuvre; none of them has ever been performed at the Bayreuth Festival,Magee (1988) 26 and they have been performed only rarely in the last hundred years (although the overture to Rienzi is an occasional concert piece). Die Feen, Das Liebesverbot and Rienzi were performed at both Leipzig and Bayreuth in 2013 to mark the composer's bicentenary.Wagnerjahr 2013 website, accessed 14 November 2012

===="Romantic operas" (1843–51)====

Wagner's middle stage output began with Der fliegende Holländer ("The Flying Dutchman", 1843), followed by Tannhäuser (1845) and Lohengrin (1850). These three operas are sometimes referred to as Wagner's "romantic operas".e.g. in Spencer (2008) 67–73 and Dahlhaus (1995) 125–9 They reinforced the reputation, among the public in Germany and beyond, that Wagner had begun to establish with Rienzi. Although distancing himself from the style of these operas from 1849 onwards, he nevertheless reworked both Der fliegende Holländer and Tannhäuser on several occasions.[tpl]#tag:ref|For the reworking of Der fliegende Holländer, see Deathridge (1982) 13, 25; for that of Tannhäuser, see Millington (2001) 280–2, which further cites Wagner's comment to Cosima three weeks before his death that he "still owes the world Tannhäuser."Cosima Wagner (1978) II, 996 See also the articles on these operas in Wikipedia.|group=n[/tpl] These three operas are considered to represent a significant developmental stage in Wagner's musical and operatic maturity as regards thematic handling, portrayal of emotions and orchestration.Westernhagen (1980) 106–7 They are the earliest works included in the Bayreuth canon, the mature operas that Cosima staged at the Bayreuth Festival after Wagner's death in accordance with his wishes.Skelton (2002) All three (including the differing versions of Der fliegende Holländer and Tannhäuser) continue to be regularly performed throughout the world, and have been frequently recorded.[tpl]#tag:ref|See performance listings by opera in Operabase, and the Wikipedia articles The Flying Dutchman discography, Tannhäuser discography and Lohengrin discography.|group=n[/tpl] They were also the operas by which his fame spread during his lifetime.[tpl]#tag:ref|For example, Der fliegende Holländer (Dutchman) was first performed in London in 1870 and in the USA (Philadelphia) in 1876; Tannhäuser in New York in 1859 and in London in 1876; Lohengrin in New York in 1871 and London in 1875.Millington (1992) 276, 279, 282–3 For detailed performance histories including other countries, see Stanford University Wagner site, under each opera.|group=n[/tpl]

===="Music dramas" (1851–82)====

=====Starting the Ring=====

Wagner's late dramas are considered his masterpieces. Der Ring des Nibelungen, commonly referred to as the Ring or "Ring cycle", is a set of four operas based loosely on figures and elements of Germanic mythology—particularly from the later Norse mythology—notably the Old Norse Poetic Edda and Volsunga Saga, and the Middle High German Nibelungenlied.See Millington (2001) 286; Donington (1979) 128–30, 141, 210–2. Wagner specifically developed the libretti for these operas according to his interpretation of Stabreim, highly alliterative rhyming verse-pairs used in old Germanic poetry.Millington (1992) 239–40, 266–7 They were also influenced by Wagner's concepts of ancient Greek drama, in which tetralogies were a component of Athenian festivals, and which he had amply discussed in his essay "Oper und Drama".Millington (2008) 74
The first two components of the Ring cycle were Das Rheingold (The Rhinegold), which was completed in 1854, and Die Walküre (The Valkyrie), which was finished in 1856. In Das Rheingold, with its "relentlessly talky 'realism' and the absence of lyrical 'numbers[tpl]'"[/tpl],Grey (2008) 86 Wagner came very close to the musical ideals of his 1849–51 essays. Die Walküre, which contains what is virtually a traditional aria (Siegmund's Winterstürme in the first act), and the quasi-choral appearance of the Valkyries themselves, shows more "operatic" traits, but has been assessed by Barry Millington as "the music drama that most satisfactorily embodies the theoretical principles of 'Oper und Drama'... A thoroughgoing synthesis of poetry and music is achieved without any notable sacrifice in musical expression."Millington (undated b)

=====Tristan und Isolde and Die Meistersinger=====

While composing the opera Siegfried, the third part of the Ring cycle, Wagner interrupted work on it and between 1857 and 1864 wrote the tragic love story Tristan und Isolde and his only mature comedy Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (The Mastersingers of Nuremberg), two works that are also part of the regular operatic canon.Millington (2001) 294, 300, 304
thumb|right|180px|Franz Betz, who created the role of Hans Sachs in Die Meistersinger, and sang Wotan in the first complete Ring cycle|alt= A photograph of a bearded white man with male-pattern baldness wearing glassesTristan is often granted a special place in musical history; many see it as the beginning of the move away from conventional harmony and tonality and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the 20th century.Dahlhaus (1979) 64Deasthridge (2008) 224 Wagner felt that his musico-dramatical theories were most perfectly realised in this work with its use of "the art of transition" between dramatic elements and the balance achieved between vocal and orchestral lines.Rose (1981) 15 Completed in 1859, the work was given its first performance in Munich, conducted by Bülow, in June 1865.Millington (2001) 298
Die Meistersinger was originally conceived by Wagner in 1845 as a sort of comic pendant to Tannhäuser.McClatchie (2008) 134 Like Tristan, it was premiered in Munich under the baton of Bülow, on 21 June 1868, and became an immediate success.Gutman (1990) 282–3 Barry Millington describes Meistersinger as "a rich, perceptive music drama widely admired for its warm humanity";Millington (undated c) but because of its strong German nationalist overtones, it is also cited by some as an example of Wagner's reactionary politics and antisemitism.See e.g. Weiner (1997) 66–72.

=====Completing the Ring=====

When Wagner returned to writing the music for the last act of Siegfried and for Götterdämmerung (Twilight of the Gods), as the final part of the Ring, his style had changed once more to something more recognisable as "operatic" than the aural world of Rheingold and Walküre, though it was still thoroughly stamped with his own originality as a composer and suffused with leitmotifs.Millington (2001) 294–5 This was in part because the libretti of the four Ring operas had been written in reverse order, so that the book for Götterdämmerung was conceived more "traditionally" than that of Rheingold;Millington (2001) 286 still, the self-imposed strictures of the Gesamtkunstwerk had become relaxed. The differences also result from Wagner's development as a composer during the period in which he wrote Tristan, Meistersinger and the Paris version of Tannhäuser.Puffett (1984) 43 From act 3 of Siegfried onwards, the Ring becomes more chromatic melodically, more complex harmonically and more developmental in its treatment of leitmotifs.Puffett (1984) 48–9
Wagner took 26 years from writing the first draft of a libretto in 1848 until he completed Götterdämmerung in 1874. The Ring takes about 15 hours to performMillington (2001) 285 and is the only undertaking of such size to be regularly presented on the world's stages.

=====Parsifal=====

Wagner's final opera, Parsifal (1882), which was his only work written especially for his Bayreuth Festspielhaus and which is described in the score as a "Bühnenweihfestspiel" ("festival play for the consecration of the stage"), has a storyline suggested by elements of the legend of the Holy Grail. It also carries elements of Buddhist renunciation suggested by Wagner's readings of Schopenhauer.Millington (2001) 308 Wagner described it to Cosima as his "last card".Cosima Wagner (1978) II, 647. Entry of 28 March 1881. It remains controversial because of its treatment of Christianity, its eroticism, and its expression, as perceived by some commentators, of German nationalism and antisemitism.Stanley (2008) 169–75 Despite the composer's own description of the opera to King Ludwig as "this most Christian of works",Newman (1976) IV, 578. Letter from Wagner to the King of 19 September 1881. Ulrike Kienzle has commented that "Wagner's turn to Christian mythology, upon which the imagery and spiritual contents of Parsifal rest, is idiosyncratic and contradicts Christian dogma in many ways."Kienzle (2005) 81 Musically the opera has been held to represent a continuing development of the composer's style, and Barry Millington describes it as "a diaphanous score of unearthly beauty and refinement".

===Non-operatic music===

Apart from his operas, Wagner composed relatively few pieces of music. These include a symphony in C major (written at the age of 19), the Faust Overture (the only completed part of an intended symphony on the subject), some overtures, and choral and piano pieces.von Westernhagen (1980) 138 His most commonly performed work that is not an extract from an opera is the Siegfried Idyll for chamber orchestra, which has several motifs in common with the Ring cycle.Millington (1992) 311–2 The Wesendonck Lieder are also often performed, either in the original piano version, or with orchestral accompaniment.[tpl]#tag:ref|Normally the orchestration by Felix Mottl is used (score available at IMSLP website), although Wagner arranged one of the songs for chamber orchestra.Millington (1992) 318|group=n[/tpl] More rarely performed are the American Centennial March (1876), and Das Liebesmahl der Apostel (The Love Feast of the Apostles), a piece for male choruses and orchestra composed in 1843 for the city of Dresden.Millington (2001) 314
After completing Parsifal, Wagner expressed his intention to turn to the writing of symphonies,Westernhagen (1980) 111 and several sketches dating from the late 1870s and early 1880s have been identified as work towards this end.Deathridge (2008) 189–205 The overtures and certain orchestral passages from Wagner's middle and late-stage operas are commonly played as concert pieces. For most of these, Wagner wrote or rewrote short passages to ensure musical coherence. The "Bridal Chorus" from Lohengrin is frequently played as the bride's processional wedding march in English-speaking countries.Kennedy (1980) 701, Wedding March

===Prose writings===

Wagner was an extremely prolific writer, authoring numerous books, poems, and articles, as well as voluminous correspondence. His writings covered a wide range of topics, including autobiography, politics, philosophy, and detailed analyses of his own operas.
Wagner planned for a collected edition of his publications as early as 1865;Millington (2001) 193 he believed that such an edition would help the world understand his intellectual development and artistic aims.Millington (2001) 194 The first such edition was published between 1871 and 1883, but was doctored to suppress or alter articles that were an embarrassment to him (e.g. those praising Meyerbeer), or by altering dates on some articles to reinforce Wagner's own account of his progress.Millington (2001) 194–5 Wagner's autobiography Mein Leben was originally published for close friends only in a very small edition (15–18 copies per volume) in four volumes between 1870 and 1880. The first public edition (with many passages suppressed by Cosima) appeared in 1911; the first attempt at a full edition (in German) appeared in 1963.Millington (2001) 185–6
There have been modern complete or partial editions of Wagner's writings,Millington (2001) 195 including a centennial edition in German edited by Dieter Borchmeyer (which, however, omitted the essay "Das Judenthum in der Musik" and Mein Leben).Wagner (1983) The English translations of Wagner's prose in eight volumes by W. Ashton Ellis (1892–99) are still in print and commonly used, despite their deficiencies.Treadwell (2008) 191 A complete edition of Wagner's correspondence, estimated to amount to between 10,000 and 12,000 items, is still under way under the supervision of the Institute for Music Research at the University of Würzburg. As at 2012 20 volumes have appeared, covering the period to 1870.Richard Wagner Collected Correspondence Edition website (in German), accessed 20 November 2012

==Influence and legacy==

===Influence on music===

Wagner's later musical style introduced new ideas in harmony, melodic process (leitmotif) and operatic structure. Notably from Tristan und Isolde onwards, he explored the limits of the traditional tonal system, which gave keys and chords their identity, pointing the way to atonality in the 20th century. Some music historians date the beginning of modern classical music to the first notes of Tristan, which include the so-called Tristan chord.Deathridge (2008) 114Magee (2000) 208–9

He has a high forehead, rimless glasses and is wearing a dark, crumpled suit|Gustav MahlerWagner inspired great devotion. For a long period, many composers were inclined to align themselves with or against Wagner's music. Anton Bruckner and Hugo Wolf were greatly indebted to him, as were César Franck, Henri Duparc, Ernest Chausson, Jules Massenet, Richard Strauss, Alexander von Zemlinsky, Hans Pfitzner and numerous others.See articles on these composers in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians; Grey (2008) 222–9; Deathridge (2008) 231–2. Gustav Mahler was devoted to Wagner and his music; aged 15, he sought him out on his 1875 visit to Vienna,Lagrange (1973) 43–4 became a renowned Wagner conductor,Millington (2001) 371 and his compositions are seen by Richard Taruskin as extending Wagner's "maximalization" of "the temporal and the sonorous" in music to the world of the symphony.Taruskin (2009) 5–8 The harmonic revolutions of Claude Debussy and Arnold Schoenberg (both of whose oeuvres contain examples of tonal and atonal modernism) have often been traced back to Tristan and Parsifal.Magee (1988) 54; Grey (2008) 228–9 The Italian form of operatic realism known as verismo owed much to the Wagnerian concept of musical form.Grey (2008) 226
Wagner made a major contribution to the principles and practice of conducting. His essay "About Conducting" (1869)Wagner (1995a) 289–364 advanced Hector Berlioz's technique of conducting and claimed that conducting was a means by which a musical work could be re-interpreted, rather than simply a mechanism for achieving orchestral unison. He exemplified this approach in his own conducting, which was significantly more flexible than the disciplined approach of Mendelssohn; in his view this also justified practices that would today be frowned upon, such as the rewriting of scores.Westrup (1980) 645[tpl]#tag:ref|See for example Wagner's proposals for the rescoring of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in his essay on that work.Wagner (1995b) 231–53|group=n[/tpl] Wilhelm Furtwängler felt that Wagner and Bülow, through their interpretative approach, inspired a whole new generation of conductors (including Furtwängler himself).Westernhagen (1980) 113
Wagner's concept of the use of leitmotifs and the integrated musical expression which they can enable has influenced many 20th and 21st century film scores. The critic Theodor Adorno has noted that the Wagnerian leitmotif "leads directly to cinema music where the sole function of the leitmotif is to announce heroes or situations so as to allow the audience to orient itself more easily".Adorno (205) 34–6 Amongst film scores citing Wagnerian themes are Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, which features a version of the Ride of the Valkyries, Trevor Jones's soundtrack to John Boorman's film Excalibur,Grant (1999) and the 2011 films A Dangerous Method (dir. David Cronenberg) and Melancholia (dir. Lars von Trier).Olivia Giovetti, "Silver Screen Wagner Vies for Oscar Gold", WQXR Operavore blog, 10 December 2011, accessed 15 April 2012.
Amongst those claiming inspiration from Wagner's music are the German band Rammstein,Reissman (2004) and the electronic composer Klaus Schulze, whose 1975 album Timewind consists of two 30-minute tracks, Bayreuth Return and Wahnfried 1883. Joey DeMaio of the band Manowar has described Wagner as "The father of heavy metal".Joe (2010), 23 n.45 The Slovenian group Laibach created the 2009 suite VolksWagner, using material from Wagner's operas.Laibach website. Accessed 24 December 2012. Phil Spector's wall of sound recording technique was, it has been claimed, heavily influenced by Wagner.Long (2008) 114

===Influence on literature, philosophy and the visual arts===

thumb|right|180px|Friedrich Nietzsche|alt=A moustachioed man in his late thirties looks to the left of the photo. His head rests on his far hand.Wagner's influence on literature and philosophy is significant. Millington has commented: Wagner's protean abundance meant that he could inspire the use of literary motif in many a novel employing interior monologue; ... the Symbolists saw him as a mystic hierophant; the Decadents found many a frisson in his work.Millington (2001) 396 Friedrich Nietzsche was a member of Wagner's inner circle during the early 1870s, and his first published work, The Birth of Tragedy, proposed Wagner's music as the Dionysian "rebirth" of European culture in opposition to Apollonian rationalist "decadence". Nietzsche broke with Wagner following the first Bayreuth Festival, believing that Wagner's final phase represented a pandering to Christian pieties and a surrender to the new German Reich. Nietzsche expressed his displeasure with the later Wagner in "The Case of Wagner" and "Nietzsche contra Wagner".Magee (1988) 52
Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Verlaine worshipped Wagner.Magee (1988) 49–50 Edouard Dujardin, whose influential novel Les lauriers sont coupés is in the form of an interior monologue inspired by Wagnerian music, founded a journal dedicated to Wagner, La Revue Wagnérienne, to which J. K. Huysmans and Téodor de Wyzewa contributed.Grey (2009) 372–87 In a list of major cultural figures influenced by Wagner, Bryan Magee includes D. H. Lawrence, Aubrey Beardsley, Romain Rolland, Gérard de Nerval, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Rainer Maria Rilke and numerous others.Magee (1988) 47–56
In the 20th century, W. H. Auden once called Wagner "perhaps the greatest genius that ever lived",Cited in Magee (1988) 48. while Thomas Mann and Marcel ProustPainter (1983) 163 were heavily influenced by him and discussed Wagner in their novels. He is also discussed in some of the works of James Joyce.Martin (1992) passim Wagnerian themes inhabit T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land, which contains lines from Tristan und Isolde and Götterdämmerung and Verlaine's poem on Parsifal.Magee (1988) 47
Many of Wagner's concepts, including his speculation about dreams, predated their investigation by Sigmund Freud.Horton (1999) Wagner had publicly analysed the Oedipus myth before Freud was born in terms of its psychological significance, insisting that incestuous desires are natural and normal, and perceptively exhibiting the relationship between sexuality and anxiety.Magee (2000) 85 George Groddeck considered the Ring as the first manual of psychoanalysis.Picard (2010) 759

===Opponents and supporters===

thumb|left|180px|Eduard Hanslick|alt=A balding white man aged about 40 with a moustacheNot all reaction to Wagner was positive. For a time, German musical life divided into two factions, supporters of Wagner and supporters of Johannes Brahms; the latter, with the support of the powerful critic Eduard Hanslick (of whom Beckmesser in Meistersinger is in part a caricature) championed traditional forms and led the conservative front against Wagnerian innovations.Millington (2001) 26, 127. See also New German School and War of the Romantics They were supported by the conservative leanings of some German music schools, including the conservatories at Leipzig under Ignaz Moscheles and at Cologne under the direction of Ferdinand Hiller.Sietz & Wiegandt (undated) Another Wagner detractor was the French composer Charles-Valentin Alkan, who wrote to Hiller after attending Wagner's Paris concert on 25 January 1860 at which Wagner conducted the overtures to Der fliegende Holländer and Tannhäuser, the preludes to Lohengrin and Tristan und Isolde, and six other extracts from Tannhäuser and Lohengrin: "I had imagined that I was going to meet music of an innovative kind but was astonished to find a pale imitation of Berlioz... I do not like all the music of Berlioz while appreciating his marvellous understanding of certain instrumental effects... but here he was imitated and caricatured... Wagner is not a musician, he is a disease."Eddie (2007), Charles Valentin Alkan: His Life and His Music, Ashgate, England, p.15, ISBN 978-1-84014-260-0 and François-Sappey, editor (1991), Charles Valentin Alkan, Fayard, Paris, p.198, ISBN 2-213-02779-X. Letter from Alkan to Hiller 31 January 1860.
Even those who, like Debussy, opposed Wagner ("this old poisoner")Cited in Lockspeiser (1978) 179. Letter from Claude Debussy to Pierre Louÿs, 17 January 1896 could not deny his influence. Indeed, Debussy was one of many composers, including Tchaikovsky, who felt the need to break with Wagner precisely because his influence was so unmistakable and overwhelming. "Golliwogg's Cakewalk" from Debussy's Children's Corner piano suite contains a deliberately tongue-in-cheek quotation from the opening bars of Tristan.Ross (2008) 101 Others who proved resistant to Wagner's operas included Gioachino Rossini, who said "Wagner has wonderful moments, and dreadful quarters of an hour."Cited in Michotte (1968) 135–6; conversation between Rossini and Emile Naumann, recorded in Naumann (1876) IV, 5 In the 20th century Wagner's music was parodied by Paul Hindemith[tpl]#tag:ref|See Overture to the Flying Dutchman as Sight-read by a Bad Spa Orchestra at 7 in the Morning by the Well|group=n[/tpl] and Hanns Eisler, among others.Deathridge (2008) 228
Wagner's followers (known as Wagnerians or Wagnerites)cf. Shaw (1898) have formed many societies dedicated to Wagner's life and work.Website of the International Association of Wagner Societies, accessed 1 February 2013.

===Film and stage portrayals===

Wagner has been the subject of many biographical films. The earliest was a silent film made by Carl Froelich in 1913 and featured in the title role the composer Giuseppe Becce, who also wrote the score for the film (as Wagner's music, still in copyright, was not available).Warshaw (2012) 77–8 Amongst other film portrayals of Wagner are: Alan Badel in Magic Fire (1955); Lyndon Brook in Song Without End (1960); Trevor Howard in Ludwig (1972); Paul Nicholas in Lisztomania (1975); and Richard Burton in Wagner (1983).See entries for these films at the Internet Movie Database (IMDb).

===Bayreuth Festival===

Since Wagner's death, the Bayreuth Festival, which has become an annual event, has been successively directed by his widow, his son Siegfried, the latter's widow Winifred Wagner, their two sons Wieland and Wolfgang Wagner, and, presently, two of the composer's great-granddaughters, Eva Wagner-Pasquier and Katharina Wagner.Management record at Bayreuth Festival website, accessed 26 January 2013. Since 1973, the festival has been overseen by the Richard-Wagner-Stiftung (Richard Wagner Foundation), the members of which include a number of Wagner's descendants.Statutes of the Foundation (in German) at Bayreuth Festival website, accessed 26 January 2013.

==Controversies==

Wagner's operas, writings, politics, beliefs and unorthodox lifestyle made him a controversial figure during his lifetime.Magee (2000) 11–4 Following his death, debate about his ideas and their interpretation, particularly in Germany during the 20th century, has continued.

===Racism and antisemitism===

Wagner's writings on the Jews corresponded to some existing trends of thought in Germany during the 19th century;Weiner (1997) 11; Katz (1986) 19; Conway (2012) 258–64; Vaszonyi (2010) 90–5 however, despite his very public views on these themes, throughout his life Wagner had Jewish friends, colleagues and supporters.Millington (2001) 164; Conway (2012) 198 There have been frequent suggestions that antisemitic stereotypes are represented in Wagner's operas. The characters of Mime in the Ring, Sixtus Beckmesser in Die Meistersinger, and Klingsor in Parsifal are sometimes claimed as Jewish representations, though they are not identified as such in the librettos of these operas.See e.g. Gutman (1990) and Adorno (1989).[tpl]#tag:ref|Weiner (1997) gives very detailed allegations of antisemitism in Wagner's music and characterisations.|group=n[/tpl] The topic of Wagner and the Jews is further complicated by allegations, which may have been credited by Wagner, that he himself was of Jewish ancestry, via his supposed father Geyer.Conway (2002)
Some biographers have asserted that Wagner in his final years came to believe in the racialist philosophy of Arthur de Gobineau, notably Gobineau's belief that Western society was doomed because of miscegenation between "superior" and "inferior" races.Everett (2008) According to Robert Gutman, this theme is reflected in the opera Parsifal.Gutman (1990) 418 ff Other biographers (such as Lucy Beckett) believe that this is not true, as the original drafts of the story date back to 1857 and Wagner had completed the libretto for Parsifal by 1877;Beckett (1981) but he displayed no significant interest in Gobineau until 1880.Gutman (1990) 406

===Other interpretations===

Wagner's ideas are amenable to socialist interpretations; many of his ideas on art were being formulated at the time of his revolutionary inclinations in the 1840s. Thus, for example, George Bernard Shaw wrote in The Perfect Wagnerite (1883):
 Wagner's picture of Niblunghome[tpl]#tag:ref|Shaw's anglicization of Nibelheim, the empire of Alberich in the Ring cycle.|group=n[/tpl] under the reign of Alberic is a poetic vision of unregulated industrial capitalism as it was made known in Germany in the middle of the 19th century by Engels's book "The Condition of the Working Class in England".Shaw (1998) Introduction 
Left-wing interpretations of Wagner also inform the writings of Theodor Adorno among other Wagner critics.[tpl]#tag:ref|See Žižek (2009) viii: "this book for the first time the Marxist reading of a musical work of art ... was combined with the highest musicological analysis."|group=n[/tpl] Walter Benjamin gave Wagner as an example of "bourgeois false consciousness", alienating art from its social context.Millington (2008) 81
The writer Robert Donington has produced a detailed, if controversial, Jungian interpretation of the Ring cycle, described as "an approach to Wagner by way of his symbols", which, for example, sees the character of the goddess Fricka as part of her husband Wotan's "inner femininity".Donington (1979) 31, 72–5 Millington notes that Jean-Jacques Nattiez has also applied psychoanalytical techniques in an evaluation of Wagner's life and works.Nattiez (1993); Millington (2008) 82–3

===Nazi appropriation===

Adolf Hitler was an admirer of Wagner's music and saw in his operas an embodiment of his own vision of the German nation; in a 1922 speech he claimed that Wagner's works glorified "the heroic Teutonic nature ... Greatness lies in the heroic."Cited in Spotts (1994) 141 Hitler visited Bayreuth frequently from 1923 onwards and attended the productions at the theatre.Spotts (1994) 140–98 There continues to be debate about the extent to which Wagner's views might have influenced Nazi thinking.[tpl]#tag:ref|The claim that Hitler, in his maturity, commented that "it his political career all began" after seeing a performance of Rienzi in his youth, has been disproved.See Karlsson (2012) 35–52.|group=n[/tpl] Houston Stewart Chamberlain (1855–1927), who married Wagner's daughter Eva in 1908 but never met Wagner, was the author of the racist book The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century, approved by the Nazi movement.Carr (2007) 108–9 He met Hitler on a number of occasions between 1923 and 1927 in Bayreuth, but cannot credibly be regarded as a conduit of Wagner's own views.Carr (2007) 109–10. See also Field (1981). The Nazis used those parts of Wagner's thought that were useful for propaganda and ignored or suppressed the rest.See Potter (2008) passim.
While Bayreuth presented a useful front for Nazi culture, and Wagner's music was used at many Nazi events,Calico (2002) 200–1; Grey (2002) 93–4 the Nazi hierarchy as a whole did not share Hitler's enthusiasm for Wagner's operas and resented attending these lengthy epics at Hitler's insistence.Carr (2007) 184
Guido Fackler has researched evidence that indicates that it is possible that Wagner's music was used at the Dachau concentration camp in 1933–34 to "reeducate" political prisoners by exposure to "national music".Fackler (2007). See also the Music and the Holocaust website. There seems to be no evidence to support claims, sometimes made,E.g. in Walsh (1992). that his music was played at Nazi death camps during the Second World War.[tpl]#tag:ref|See e.g. John (2004) for a detailed essay on music in the Nazi death camps, which nowhere mentions Wagner. See also Potter (2008) 244: "We know from testimonies that concentration camp orchestras played sorts of music ... but that Wagner was explicitly off-limits. However, after the war, unsubstantiated claims that Wagner's music accompanied Jews to their death took on momentum."|group=n[/tpl]
Because of the associations of Wagner with antisemitism and Nazism, the performance of his music in the State of Israel has been a source of controversy.See Bruen (1993).
