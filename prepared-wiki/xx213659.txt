==Background==

The United Kingdom sent its fifty-second entry to the Eurovision Song Contest in 2009. It automatically qualified to the final as one of the "Big Four" countries that pays the most money to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) for the organisation of the event.
The United Kingdom's result history has varied. The country is one of the most successful at the contest, having won on five occasions (in 1967, 1969, 1976, 1981 and 1997), however, it has only made the Top 10 on two occasions since the turn of the millennium, as well as coming last three times during that period (in 2003, 2008 and 2010). The leader of the Conservative Party, David Cameron, had called for the UK to withdraw from the 2009 contest due to the 2008 South Ossetia war, but to no avail.[tpl]cite web |url=http://blogs.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/eurovision/2008/08/if_david_cameron_was_prime_min.html|title=If David Cameron was Prime Minister|work=Manchester Evening News|author=Devine, Peter|accessdate=2008-08-23|date=2008-08-20[/tpl]
The British public broadcaster, the BBC broadcasts the event each year and organises the selection process for the entry. In all cases, a national final has selected the British Eurovision entry, varying between both a selection of performer and song, or just a song selection with an internal selection for the artist being held. For most years, the public had been able to vote for the winner, using in the past postcard voting, where the viewers sent postcards with their vote to the BBC, but more recently televoting.

===Introduction show===

On 3 January 2009, an introduction show to Your Country Needs You was aired. The show involved Andrew Lloyd Webber's quest to find the six acts that would compete in the live shows, as well as 'fact-finding' for Eurovision, involving visiting the Olimpiysky arena in Moscow, the venue for the contest, where the duo remark how an amateur performer would have a hard time filling the 20,000 seat arena. In Moscow, Lloyd Webber met Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, as well as meeting some Russian Eurovision fans, who suggest that the UK should avoid amateur performers and focus on a more professional approach. Lloyd Webber and Norton also visited Poland and Hungary; in the latter, Lloyd Webber is "more famous than the Beatles". The programme also featured Graham Norton interviewing Dima Bilan, the winner of last year's Eurovision Song Contest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/12826|title=UK National Selection - Introduction show|last=Murray|first=Gavin|date=2009-01-03|accessdate=2009-01-08[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&id=4716|title=Live on BBC One, the Eurovision 'Introductory' Show|last=Fisher|first=Luke|date=2009-01-03|publisher=Oikotimes|accessdate=2009-01-08[/tpl]
Back in Britain, Lloyd Webber teams up with record company executive Colin Barlow, who has worked with the likes of Take That and Girls Aloud, having had 15 number ones and sold over 40 million albums as a producer, to help select the lucky six performers who will progress to the live shows.

At the start of the show, all six acts sang the 1974 Eurovision winner "Waterloo" by ABBA. The artists also gave two further performances on stage during the voting interval, with the girls performing "One Rock & Roll Too Many" from Lloyd Webber's musical Starlight Express, while the boys performed "No Matter What" by Boyzone. It was also revealed that famous songwriter Diane Warren will write the lyrics to the winning song.
A video clip was shown of the acts singing at the O2 Arena in London, so they could have an experience of performing within a big arena. As the voting ended, Lemar sang "Weight of the World" from his new album The Reason. During the results, Emperors of Soul, Mark, the Twins and Jade were all saved from the "danger zone", while Charlotte and Damien gained the least votes. Lloyd Webber saved Charlotte from elimination, saying that he believed that she would learn more from the experience. Damien was eliminated from the competition.
The first live show of Your Country Needs You averaged 5 million viewers, an increase from the introduction show. The viewing figures, seen as another success, made the show BBC One's third most watched programme of the day.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/12893|title=Five million tune in for UK Eurovision live show|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2009-01-12|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2009-01-12[/tpl]

As the results were given in the studio, the Twins, Jade and Mark were saved from the "danger zone", while the Emperors of Soul and Charlotte, for the second time, received the least votes. Lloyd Webber saved the Emperors of Soul, saying that he thought that Charlotte would not be able to handle the grandness of the Eurovision stage in Moscow, but also saying that he thought she had a big career ahead of her.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/12951|title=United Kingdom: four Eurovision acts to the semi final|last=Klier|first=Marcus|date=2009-01-17|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2009-01-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&id=4831|title=United Kingdom: Charlotte leaves Your Country Needs You|last=Fisher|first=Luke|date=2009-01-17|publisher=oikotimes|accessdate=2009-01-17[/tpl]
