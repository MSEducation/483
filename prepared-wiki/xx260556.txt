[[Momordin (protein)]]

CATEGORIES: Enzymes

Momordin or Î±-momorcharin is one of several related proteins isolated from several plants of the Momordica genus, which includes the bitter melon (M. charantia) and the balsam apple (M. balsamina).
These enzymes are potent inhibitor of protein synthesis in eukaryotes by inactivating the ribosomes.[tpl]Cite pmid|1408771 |noedit[/tpl][tpl]Cite PMID|8143869 |noedit[/tpl][tpl]Cite PMID|7763984 |noedit[/tpl] However its cytotoxic activity is limited because it is not taken up by the cells; it has to be chemically modified to do so.[tpl]cite pmid|    1460001 |noedit[/tpl]
There are several variants, including momordin II (from M. balsamina)[tpl]cite pmid|10530800 |noedit[/tpl]  and momordin-a (from M. charantia).[tpl]Cite pmid|    9648227 |noedit[/tpl]
