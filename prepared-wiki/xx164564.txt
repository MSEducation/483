The Erna Raid ([tpl]lang-et|Erna retk[/tpl]) is an annual international military exercise and competition, one of the longest and most difficult in the world, held every August since 1995 in Estonia. It is organised by the Erna Society and commemorates the actions of the long-range reconnaissance group 'Erna' in the summer of 1941.British Embassy in Tallinn August 5, 2006: ERNA RAID 2006 1–5 August

==Participation==

Foreign teams have always been welcome to partake in the competition. In 2007, 28 teams from nine different countries participated: Estonia (18 teams), Czech Republic (one), Denmark (one), Finland (two), Germany (one), Norway (two), Portugal (one), Sweden (one) and the USA (one), of which Portugal and the Czech Republic are newcomers. Teams from  the United Kingdom have participated in earlier years (most recently, a British Territorial Army team in 2006), but only observed in 2007. A team from Cyprus also observed. Teams from The People's Republic of China have been traditionally successful in the competition and took 1st and 2nd place in 2002. Other successful teams have come from Finland and Norway.
Due to the home advantage attributed to the intimate knowledge of the terrain by the local teams, the venue for the competition may be changed next year.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.err.ee/Sports/fd9a84aa-79c8-4f51-8a3e-68dd18057cf3 |title=This Year's Erna Endurance Event Could Be Last in Current Location |publisher=ERR |date=2011-07-29 |accessdate=2011-08-14[/tpl]

==History==

The competition is named after the Erna long-range recce group ([tpl]lang-et|Erna luuregrupp[/tpl]) and themed after its activities in the summer of 1941.

===Erna Society===

In 1993, a group of enthusiasts followed the historical route of the Erna group of 1941, and came up with the idea of organizing a commemorative competition. A first try with only Estonian participants was held in 1994. In the autumn of 1994, the Erna society was founded, and in 1995, the first international competition was held, and has been so annually since then, growing in size and the number of participants over time.

==Past competitions==

The table below records the final results for the year's competition. It does not include retired and disqualified teams. DL is the acronym for the Defence League.

==Soviet claims==

Since the Stalin era, the official Soviet stance was that the original Erna team participated in the mass murder of Soviet political activists. Sometimes this included a claim that the letter 'E' was cut onto the backs of the victims.
These claims were reinforced in the 1980s as a way of distracting historians analysing the Kautla massacre, and have been repeated in the Russian media throughout the 2000s.Mart Laar: Tavaline stalinism, printed in Postimees 16 August 2007

==Recent official Russian accusations of glorifying Nazism==

Since the competition's initiation, sectors of the Russian media claimed the competition's namesake was an attempt to glorify collaboration with Nazi Germany.Хоть кровь из носу, но до цели дойдем [tpl]Ru icon[/tpl]Эстонские власти вновь признались в любви к Гитлеру [tpl]Ru icon[/tpl]В Эстонии играют в гитлеровцев [tpl]Ru icon[/tpl]Об участии эстонского легиона СС в военных преступлениях в 1941-1945 гг. и попытках пересмотра в Эстонии приговора Нюрнбергского трибунала [tpl]Ru icon[/tpl] In 2007, high-ranking government officials sharply criticized the competition, calling it "glamorization of Nazism" and expressing outrage over NATO members participating in the competition."Поход Эрна-2007".

An analyst of the US-based think tank Jamestown Foundation believes this view follows Soviet and post-Soviet Russia's official logic on two counts: first, that resistance to the Red Army was inherently illegitimate and conflatable with "fascism" in an occupied country or one targeted for occupation; second, that Estonia should be criticized for remembering an act of national resistance and its casualties.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/print_friendly.php?volume_id=420&issue_id=4200&article_id=|title=PACE Chairman bending to the Kremlin wind against Estonia|publisher=Jamestown Foundation|date=2007-08-03|accessdate=2007-08-09|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930165258/http://www.jamestown.org/print_friendly.php?volume_id=420&issue_id=4200&article_id= |archivedate = 2007-09-30[/tpl]
Estonia's Minister of Defence, Jaak Aaviksoo called the accusations "regrettable" and recalled that the Erna group saved the lives of many civilians from the vengeful Soviet paramilitary units, and specifically pointed out cases of burning farmers alive along with their farms in Kautla.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kmin.ee/?op=news&id=1283&setlang=eng|title=Erna Raid and NKVD Destruction Battalions|publisher=Estonian Ministry of Defence|date=2007-08-09|accessdate=2007-08-10[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.postimees.ee/100807/esileht/siseuudised/276283.php|title=Aaviksoo: Erna retk ei möödunud ilma Venemaa laimukampaaniata|publisher=Postimees |date=2007-08-09|accessdate=2007-08-09[/tpl] [tpl]et icon[/tpl]
