==History and operation==

The program launched on October 6, 2008, in many cases replacing BBC World News, which continued to air on some public TV stations; following the cancellation of Worldfocus, many of the stations that had dropped the BBC program have since resumed carrying it. Worldfocus was not part of the national PBS schedule and did not air on all U.S. public TV stations.  Worldfocus was a "testing ground", and "important laboratory" for new digital production techniques.‘Worldfocus’ Ending Run - TVNewser

News stories and video segments are used from: ABC, Al Jazeera English, Asian News International, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Channel 2 (Israel), Channel 10 (Israel), the Christian Science Monitor, Deutsche Welle, ITN, LinkTV, NBC News, The New York Times, NHK, and Rede Globo.http://worldfocus.org/blog/2008/11/21/frequently-asked-questions/2869/

On March 8, 2010,  Daljit Dhaliwal announced at the end of that night's program, that Worldfocus would cease programming on April 2, 2010. The Worldfocus official website cited "fundraising difficulties" as the reason for the program's demise. In fact Worldfocus was several million dollars off its fundraising goals.‘Worldfocus’ Ending Run TV Newser March 5, 2010 Overall Worldfocus was very expensive to produce, and did not bring in the crucial viewer donations as BBC World News had reliably done for years before. Cutbacks, dismissal of personnel, and cancellation of other WNET programs were blamed on spending for Worldfocus, although WNET CEO Neal Shapiro denies this.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/04/arts/television/04wnet.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=WNET News Program Gains a Foothold but Draws Internal Complaints | first=Elizabeth | last=Jensen | date=February 4, 2009[/tpl]  Neal Shapiro said, "Given the economic environment we now face, it is not prudent to continue the broadcast at this time".

The completed studio was later used for other programs. In April 2010 WNET started again airing BBC World News, the very program that Worldfocus had replaced in 2008.
