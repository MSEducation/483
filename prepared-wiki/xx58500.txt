==Rivalries==

===Ateneo–La Salle rivalry===

The rivalry between Ateneo de Manila University and De La Salle University has resulted in sold-out games that attract several public figures in attendance, including politicians, movie stars, and foreign diplomats. It is also the foremost school rivalry in the UAAP since La Salle joined the UAAP from the NCAA in 1986. However, the rivalry dates back to the time when both schools were playing in the National Collegiate Athletic Association from 1924 until the late 1977.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/sports/23rivalry.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |title=A Nation's Passion Lives in a Rivalry of Green vs. Blue |work=New York Times |accessdate=September 2008 |first=Rafael |last=Bartholomew | date=September 23, 2007[/tpl]

===UP–UST cheerdance rivalry===

The cheerdance rivalry between University of the Philippines and University of Santo Tomas has been one of the most talked about rivalries in UAAP history. Since the inception of the cheerdance, UP and UST have had the best winning records, and one is usually just a runner up to the other. Both schools' pep squads are famous for their stunts and high-energy performances. UST has won 8 cheerdance titles which included 5 straight victories from 2002 to 2006, while UP has won 8 cheerdance titles including 5 of the last 6 cheerdance competitions since 2007. Since 2010, the rivalry turned into a friendly one as both UP and UST supporters cheered their school cheers during the announcement of winners.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/09/16/10/ust-friendship-emerges-after-cheerdance-competition |title='UP-UST friendship' emerges after cheerdance competition |publisher=ABS-CBN abs-cbnnews.com. |accessdate=July 16, 2011 |first=Karen |last=Flores | date=September 16, 2010[/tpl]

===La Salle–UST rivalry===

Both were known for their numerous basketball championship matches in the 1990s, with UST winning four straight titles at the expense of the Green Archers. In 1999, La Salle defeated the Growling Tigers to win the basketball crown. Their basketball rivalry diminished in latter years due to UST's decline but became a celebrated rivalry in women's volleyball, as the Lady Archers and the Tigresses met three times in the championship of the Shakey's V-League tournament with UST having 5 championships and La Salle having 3 under their belt.[tpl]cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/manila-bulletin/mi_7968/is_2010_Feb_21/la-salle-ust-duel-volleyball/ai_n50161055/ |title=La Salle, UST duel for volleyball title |work=Manila Bulletin |date=February 21, 2010 |publisher=findarticles.com |accessdate=July 18, 2011[/tpl] The rivalry was carried over to the UAAP. The DLSU Lady Spikers and the UST Tigresses met in the finals for two consecutive seasons—Season 72 and Season 73. Their basketball rivalry was renewed when Jeron Teng joined the Archers facing his older brother Jeric of the Tigers.

===FEU–UE rivalry===

The rivalry between Far Eastern University and University of the East started in the 1950s. Tagged as the "Battle of the East", these two schools, along with UST, have the winningest basketball squads in the league (FEU having won 19 basketball championships while UE having won 18 titles).[tpl]cite web|last=Mendoza|first=Shielo|title=FEU Tamaraws|url=http://ph.news.yahoo.com/blogs/collegehoops/feu-tamaraws-103707081.html|work=College Hoops|publisher=Yahoo Southeast Asia|accessdate=September 20, 2011[/tpl]
