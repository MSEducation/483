William Kent (March 29, 1864 – March 13, 1928) was an American who served as a United States Congressman representing the State of California.  He spearheaded the movement to create the Muir Woods National Monument by donating land to the Federal Government for the Monument.
Kent was born in Chicago, Illinois. His parents moved the family to Marin County in California in the year 1871.  He graduated from Yale University in 1887, where he was a member of Skull and Bones.[tpl]cite web | url=http://mssa.library.yale.edu/obituary_record/1925_1952/1927-28.pdf | title=Obituary Record of Yale Graduates 1927-1928 | accessdate=March 26, 2011 | date=15 September 1928 | publisher=Yale University[/tpl][tpl]rp|107[/tpl]
Upon graduation, Kent returned to Chicago and entered the real estate and livestock businesses.  He also became involved in politics, becoming a member of the city council and president of the Municipal Voter's League of Chicago.
In 1907, Kent returned to California and entered the national stage of politics by earning election as a Progressive Republican to the 62nd United States Congress.  For the 63rd and 64th Congresses he was reelected as an Independent. In total, he served in Congress from March 4, 1911 to March 4, 1917.
In 1916, Kent was the lead sponsor of the legislation in the House of Representatives that created the National Park Service.  The similar Senate bill was sponsored by Reed Smoot.  The legislation passed the House of Representatives on July 1, 1916, passed the Senate on August 5, and was signed by President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916.[ref]

Kent was also heavily involved in local politics; he was one of the major supporters of the creation of the Marin Municipal Water District in 1911, and also backed early efforts for a Golden Gate Bridge.  While Kent supported conservation, he also actively worked to promote growth and development in Marin, such as his support for the Mt. Tamalpais & Muir Woods Railway, a renowned Marin County attraction partially funded by his father, A.E. Kent.  His wealth as one of the major landowners in the county increased greatly as property values rose.
Following his career in Congress, Kent was appointed to the United States Tariff Commission (now known as the United States International Trade Commission). He served on the Commission from March 21, 1917 to March 31, 1920.
Kent was also a philanthropist.  Together with his wife, Elizabeth Thacher Kent, he purchased 611 acres (2.5 km²) of one the last remaining stands of coast redwoods along Redwood Creek north of  San Francisco Bay.  To protect the redwood grove from development, he donated 295 acres (1.19 km²) to the Federal Government.  President Theodore Roosevelt declared the area a national monument in 1908 and suggested naming the monument after Kent.  Kent demurred and suggested the grove be named Muir Woods National Monument, after naturalist John Muir.  Portraits of the Kent family by artist Herbert A. Collins hang there.
He was the father of Sherman Kent and Roger Kent and the brother-in-law of Sherman Day Thacher. His wife was the daughter of Yale professor and administrator Thomas Anthony Thacher
Kent died in Kentfield, California.  His remains were cremated in Oakland, California.
