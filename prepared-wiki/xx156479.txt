"Mach die Augen zu" your eyes, lit. Close the eyes is a punk song by Die Ärzte. It is the eighth track and the second single from their 1993 album Die Bestie in Menschengestalt. This song is about a relationship where one side doesn't care anymore, what the other does and with whom.

==The video==

The video is based on the fairy tale of Snow White. Shown is how the woman (whose appearance doesn't resemble Snow White's) bites a poisonous apple from a tree and then falls asleep. The dwarves carry her in a casket and a spider builds a web over her. Also is shown how a clumsy knight makes his way to the woman, finds her in the casket surrounded by dwarves, shreds the web and kisses the woman. The woman awakes, takes his helmet off and kisses him. She then proceeds to strip him from his armor. The video ends with the woman lifting the knight on the horse and walking beside it along the road.
