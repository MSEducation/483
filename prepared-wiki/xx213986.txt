==Overview==

Romance and love which a young heart cherishes are present in this novel with their various shades and colour. It is primarily the story of "non expressive love and romance between two characters (Chandar and Sudha)...", showing various trappings of love in urban middle-class, pre-independence India and mental conflicts of an enthusiastic, ambitious but idealistic youth. The portraying of characters is beautiful, particularly the female protagonist of novel, Sudha touches the heart.
In the novels foreword, the author says, "While writing this novel I experienced the feeling one has during depressing moments when he prays ferevently, with full faith.... It appears as if the very same prayer has been ingrained in my heart and I am still repeating it..."
In this novel Dharamveer Bharati has presented the feeling of Sudha and Chander very brilliantly. Chander loved Sudha very much but his one decision led Sudha to the path of misery. He was "Devta" later he did a "gunah" (crime) so he was called "Gunaho ka devta"
