Questionnaire construction regards questionnaires. It is a series of questions asked to individuals to obtain statistically useful information about a given topic.Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, s.v. "questionnaire," http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/questionnaire (accessed May 21, 2008)  When properly constructed and responsibly administered, questionnaires become a vital instrument by which statements can be made about specific groups, or people, or entire populations.

==Questionnaires==

Questionnaires are frequently used in quantitative marketing research and social research. They are a valuable method of collecting a wide range of information from a large number of individuals, often referred to as respondents. 
Adequate questionnaire construction is critical to the success of a survey. Inappropriate questions, incorrect ordering of questions, incorrect scaling, or bad questionnaire format can make the survey valueless, as it may not accurately reflect the views and opinions of the participants. A useful method for checking a questionnaire and making sure it is accurately capturing the intended information is to pretest among a smaller subset of target respondents.
