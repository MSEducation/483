Goose barnacles (order Pedunculata), also called stalked barnacles or gooseneck barnacles, are filter-feeding crustaceans that live attached to hard surfaces of rocks and flotsam in the ocean intertidal zone.

==Biology==

Some species of goose barnacles are pelagic and are most frequently found on tidewrack on oceanic coasts. Unlike most other types of barnacles, intertidal goose barnacles depend on water motion rather than the movement of their cirri for feeding, and are therefore found only on exposed or moderately exposed coasts.

==Mythology==

In the days before it was realised that birds migrate, it was thought that Barnacle Geese, Branta leucopsis, developed from this crustacean, since they were never seen to nest in temperate Europe,[tpl]cite book |author=Michael Allaby |year=2009 |title=Animals: from Mythology to Zoology |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-0-8160-6101-3 |chapter=Barnacles |pages=75–77 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KtKZ12YN9qcC&pg=PT91[/tpl] hence the English names "goose barnacle", "barnacle goose" and the scientific name Lepas anserifera (Latin anser = "goose"). The confusion was prompted by the similarities in colour and shape. Because they were often found on driftwood, it was assumed that the barnacles were attached to branches before they fell in the water. The Welsh monk, Giraldus Cambrensis, made this claim in his Topographia Hiberniae.[tpl]cite journal |author=Beatrice White |year=1945 |title=Whale-hunting, the barnacle goose, and the date of the "Ancrene Riwle".

==Taxonomy==

The order Pedunculata is divided into the following suborders and families:[tpl]cite book |url=http://atiniui.nhm.org/pdfs/3839/3839.pdf |title=An Updated Classification of the Recent Crustacea |author=Joel W.

==As food==

In Portugal and Spain, they are a widely consumed and expensive delicacy known as percebes. Percebes are harvested commercially in the northern coast, mainly in Galicia, and are also imported from overseas, particularly from Morocco and Canada. The indigenous peoples of California eat the stem after cooking it in hot ashes.http://books.google.com/books?id=jpvrxVA0PGYC&pg=PA91&dq=%22Strongylocentrotus+purpuratus%22+native&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-446UbD_L6mH0QH9p4GYBg&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22Strongylocentrotus%20purpuratus%22%20native&f=false
