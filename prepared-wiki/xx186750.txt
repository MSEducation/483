Anna-Maria Ferrero (Rome, 18 February 1934) is an Italian actress.
Born Anna Maria Guerra, she changed her last name to Ferrero in honor of the composer Willy Ferrero.  Her film debut came at the age of 15 in Il cielo è rosso (1950), and she was soon cast in such films as  Il duca di Sant'Elmo (1950) and Il Cristo proibito (1951), the only movie directed by the noted writer Curzio Malaparte.

==Life==

Ferrero's career progressed quickly as she worked with prominent directors, such as Michelangelo Antonioni on I vinti, and actors, like Marcello Mastroianni in Carlo Lizzani's award-winning Chronicle of Poor Lovers (1953).  She appeared with the popular comedian Totò in Totò e Carolina (1953) and with star Alberto Sordi in Una parigina a Roma (1954).
It was Italian star Vittorio Gassman with whom Ferrero worked most often.  They appeared together in six films: Lorenzaccio, King Vidor's  War and Peace, Kean, which Gassman co-directed, Giovanni dalle bande nere, Le sorprese dell'amore, and Il mattatore.
Ferrero chose to end her career shortly after her 1963 marriage to French actor Jean Sorel, her co-star in two films: Gold of Rome (1961) and The Four Days of Naples (1962).  Her last on-screen appearance was in an episode of the movie Controsesso (1964), directed by  Ettore Scola.
