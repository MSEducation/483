[[Symposium on Combinatorial Search]]

CATEGORIES: Organizations based in New Hampshire

SoCS, the Symposium on Combinatorial Search, is an unincorporated volunteer association organized in the U.S. state of New Hampshire, not organized for the private gain of any person. The purpose of SoCS is to promote the study and understanding of combinatorial search and heuristic search algorithms among the public through the organization of scientific meetings, publications, tutorials, and other public scientific and educational activities. 
In addition, the conference tries to strengthen the relation with other important areas of artificial intelligence. In recent years, there has been an emphasis on robotics, automated planning and machine learning.

==History==

The First Symposium on Combinatorial Search was held in Chicago (Illinois, USA) in 2008 as a result of various workshops that were held in previous conferences, mainly IJCAI, AAAI and ICAPS. Since then, it has been held every year, always in association with a larger event.
Although it has primarily been held in the United States, it moved to Europe (Spain) for its fourth symposium and then moved back to North America (Canada) in 2012. Since SoCS 2010 the symposium has kept an archive of all accepted papers.[ref]
