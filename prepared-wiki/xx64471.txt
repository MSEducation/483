[tpl]nihongo|Azumanga Daioh|あずまんが大王|Azumanga Daiō|lit. "Great King Azumanga"[/tpl] is a Japanese comedy manga by Kiyohiko Azuma. It was serialized by MediaWorks in the shōnen manga magazine Dengeki Daioh from 1999 to 2002 and collected in four bound volumes. In May 2009, in conjunction with the 10th anniversary of the manga, three additional chapters began serialization in Shogakukan's Monthly Shōnen Sunday under the title Azumanga Daioh: Supplementary Lessons.
The manga is drawn in a series of vertical four-panel comic strips called yonkoma and depicts the lives of a group of girls during their three years as high-school classmates. The series has been praised for its humor driven by eccentric characters, and Kiyohiko Azuma acclaimed as a "master of the four-panel form," for both his art style and comic timing.
It was adapted as an anime television series called Azumanga Daioh: the Animation by J.C.Staff, which aired from the week of April 8, 2002 until the week of September 30, 2002. It was broadcast on the TV Tokyo network and AT-X in five-minute segments every weekday, then rebroadcast as a 25-minute compilation that weekend, for a total of 130 five-minute segments collected in 26 episodes. The compilation episodes were released on DVD and Universal Media Discs (UMDs) by Starchild Records; the five-minute segments can be distinguished by their individual titles. Several soundtrack albums were released, as well as three Azumanga Daioh video games.

==Title==

The series title has no particular significance to the story. "Azumanga" is a portmanteau of the author's name "Azuma" and "manga", while "Daioh" comes from the magazine in which it was originally published, Dengeki Daioh.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.animejump.com/index.php?module=prodreviews&func=showcontent&id=493 | title=Azumanga Daioh vol. 1 | first=Mike | last=Toole | publisher=Anime Jump! | date=May 28, 2004 | accessdate=March 23, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071109120134/http://www.animejump.com/index.php?module=prodreviews&func=showcontent&id=493 |archivedate = November 9, 2007[/tpl] In the anime, "daioh" is mentioned during the next episode previews, used in context with the meaning "great king".
"Azumanga" is also used as a general term for Kiyohiko Azuma's other comics and illustrations.[tpl]cite speech | title=｢リサイクルの功罪 循環型社会の光と影......それは結局ただしいのか?｣("Risaikuru no Kouzai Junkan Gata Shakai no Hikari to Kage ... ...

==Plot==

Azumanga Daioh chronicles the everyday life in an unnamed Japanese high school of six girls and two of their teachers: child prodigy Chiyo Mihama and her struggle to fit in with girls five years older, reserved Sakaki and her obsession with the cute animals who seem to hate her, spacey Ayumu "Osaka" Kasuga with a skewed perspective on the world, Koyomi "Yomi" Mizuhara's aggravation at an annoying best friend, Tomo Takino, whose energy is rivaled only by her lack of sense, sporty Kagura and her one-sided rivalry with Sakaki, and their homeroom teacher Yukari Tanizaki and her friend, physical education teacher Minamo "Nyamo" Kurosawa. Secondary characters include Kimura-sensei, a creepy male teacher with an obsession with teenage girls, and Kaorin, a female classmate with a crush on Sakaki.
The story covers three years of tests, talking between classes, culture festivals, and athletic events at school, as well as time spent traveling to and from school, studying at Chiyo's house, and vacations spent at Chiyo's summer beach home and the fictional theme park Magical Land, concluding with the graduation of the main cast. It is generally realistic in tone, marked by occasional bursts of surrealism and absurdity, such as Osaka imagining Chiyo's ponytails being "unscrewed" from her head and an episode featuring the characters' New Year's dreams.

Besides the anime television series, there have been two other animated adaptations: The Very Short Azumanga Daioh Movie, a six-minute trailer released to movie theaters to publicize the upcoming television series,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.mania.com/azumanga-daioh-vol-6_article_78528.html | title=Azumanga Daioh Vol. #6 | first=Dani | last=Moure | publisher=Mania.com | date=May 18, 2006 | accessdate=June 4, 2009[/tpl] and Azumanga Web Daioh, a shorter original net animation made available for paid streaming on chara-ani.com beginning from December 28, 2000, then offered as a paid download for a limited time.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.chara-ani.com/az/index.cfm | title=あずまんがWeb大王 | publisher=chara-ani.com | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010208194457/http://www.chara-ani.com/az/index.cfm |archivedate=February 8, 2001 | accessdate=September 5, 2012[/tpl] Azumanga Web Daioh was originally intended to gauge whether there was enough interest to create a web-released anime adaptation; because of overwhelming demand, the original plan for web-release was changed to a television release. It featured different voice actors and music from the regular series.
In the United States, the anime television series was released in six DVDs on September 9, 2005, and then later in a five DVD volume "Thinpak" set, both by ADV Films.[tpl]cite web| title=ADV DVD Store| publisher=ADV Films | url=http://www.advfilms.com/CatalogFilms_Volumes.asp?ID=1799 | accessdate=December 15, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061206100959/http://www.advfilms.com/CatalogFilms_Volumes.asp?ID=1799  |archivedate = December 6, 2006[/tpl] The sixth DVD volume included The Very Short Azumanga Daioh Movie. In the English dub, the English class and English-speaking foreigners are changed to Spanish in order to adjust the jokes to English speaking audiences. In 2009, Nokia offered the first five episodes of Azumanga Daioh on its Ovi phone service.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-05-29/anime-network-taken-off-comcast-put-on-directv|title=Anime Network Taken Off Comcast, Put on DirecTV (Updated)|date=2009-05-29|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=2009-05-30| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090530181936/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-05-29/anime-network-taken-off-comcast-put-on-directv| archivedate= 30 May 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Madman Entertainment licensed the series for release in Australia and New Zealand.

English reviewers have commented positively about Azumanga Daioh. In Manga: The Complete Guide, Jason Thompson refers to it as a "charming comedy" and a "quiet master of the four-panel form", praising the series comedic timing and use of running gags. He felt one of the series' best points was its "character-driven writing", but does warn that its moe nature and the jokes that revolve around the "vaguely pedophilic teacher" might disturb some newer readers of manga.[tpl]cite book | last=Thompson | first=Jason | title=Manga: The Complete Guide | date=October 9, 2007 | publisher=Del Rey Books | location=New York, New York | isbn=978-0-345-48590-8 | oclc=85833345 | page=18[/tpl]  He later said that Azumanga Daioh was an "almost totally innocent" kind of moe, centered around "peeping at the chaste world of girls", in which "adorable girls do adorable things".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comixology.com/articles/265/Moe-The-Cult-of-the-Child|title=Moe: The Cult of the Child|last=Thompson|first=Jason|date=July 9, 2009|publisher=Comixology|accessdate=2009-10-29[/tpl]  The French manga dictionary Dicomanga noted that despite being a moe series targeted to otaku, it also appealed to female readers for celebrating "friendships between girls as well as its comedy."[tpl]cite book | first=Nicolas |last=Penedo | title=Dicomanga: le dictionnaire encyclopédique de la bande dessinée japonaise | publisher=Fleurus | location=Paris | language=French | page=56 | isbn=978-2-215-07931-6 | year=2008 | quote=Publié au Japon dans les pages du magazine "Monthly Comic Dengeki Daioh", cette série s'apparente au genre "moe", ciblant in public d'otaku portés sur l'intimité des filles.
