Dragon Warrior II, known as [tpl]nihongo|Dragon Quest II: Akuryou no Kamigami|ドラゴンクエストII 悪霊の神々||lit. "Dragon Quest II: Gods of the Evil Spirits"[/tpl] in Japan, is a role-playing video game (RPG) developed by Chunsoft and published by Enix (now known as Square Enix) in 1987 for the Nintendo Entertainment System as a part of the Dragon Quest series. Enix themselves created the American version of Dragon Quest II, publishing the game there in 1990.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131926/the_history_of_dragon_quest.php?page=1 | title= The History of Dragon Quest | publisher= UBM Tech| author=Kurt Kalata | date=February 4, 2008 | accessdate=2013-06-22[/tpl]
Dragon Quest II is set 100 years after the events of the first game. The game's story centers on the prince of Midenhall, who is ordered to stop an evil wizard named Hargon after Hargon destroys Moonbrooke Castle. On his adventure, he is accompanied by his two cousins; the prince of Cannock and the princess of Moonbrooke. Dragon Quest II greatly expands on the series formula from the first game by having a larger party, more areas to explore, multiple heroes and enemies in a battle, and a sailing ship.
Dragon Warrior II was successful in Japan; the original Famicom version shipped 2.4 million copies. Later, the game was remade for the Super Famicom and the Game Boy Color with Dragon Warrior as Dragon Quest I & II. A version of the game for Android and iOS has been announced for release in Japan in Winter 2014. The third title in the series, Dragon Quest III: And Into the Legend..., was released in 1988 in Japan. Dragon Warrior III is the prequel of the first two games; it follows the ancestor of the main characters, the legendary hero Erdrick;[tpl]cite web|title=Remembering Our Dragon Quests|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/feature/26419|publisher=Nintendo World Report, LLC.|accessdate=22 June 2013|author=Nathan Mustafa|date=2011-05-27[/tpl] the three games are collectively called "Erdrick's Legend Trilogy".[tpl]cite web|title="ロトの伝説三部作"がWiiに！　『ドラゴンクエスト25周年記念 ファミコン＆スーパーファミコン ドラゴンクエストI・II・III』|url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201105/26043927.html|publisher=Enterbrain|accessdate=21 June 2013|language=Japanese|date=2011-05-26[/tpl]

==Gameplay==

This game allows the player to control more than one character, each of whom has their own characteristics, and it is the first game in the Dragon Quest series to do so.Editors of Nintendo Power: Nintendo Power September/October, 1990; issue 16 (in English). Nintendo of America, Tokuma Shoten Publishing, 67. The game introduced a party system where, instead of beginning the game with an entire party like in previous computer RPGs, the player begins the game with only one character and gradually recruits more party members during the course of the game.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dqnine.com/#/iwata/|title=Dragon Quest: Sential of the Starry Skies|work=Iwata Asks|publisher=Square-Enix|at=The History of Dragon Quest|accessdate=2010-12-05[/tpl] The player controls his or her characters as they move in the game world. They can search treasure chests, talk and trade with villagers, equip themselves with weapons and armor, and cast spells.
While wandering fields, towers, caves, seas, and dungeons, the player encounters battles that happen randomly.[tpl]cite web|title=The GameSpy Hall of Fame: Dragon Warrior|url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/492/492001p2.html|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc.|accessdate=22 June 2013|author=William Cassidy|date=2002-02-01[/tpl] The game's battle mode introduces groups of monsters, which is an upgrade from the one-on-one battles of Dragon Warrior. In the battle mode, the player gives orders to the characters on how to fight the monsters. Once the player defeats all of the monsters, the characters gain experience points and gold. The experience points raise the characters' experience levels. This improves the characters' attributes, and they may also learn new spells.
To win, the player must fight monsters to improve the characters' experience levels and get gold to buy better weapons and armor. Eventually, the player's characters become strong enough to make it to the next town or dungeon. This repeats until the player reaches the final boss and defeats him. However, the gameplay is not necessarily linear, especially after the player gets the boat. Exploration is a key component of the game. The game offers a few spots to save the game.[tpl]cite book|title=Dragon Warrior II Instruction Booklet|year=1990|publisher=Enix America Corporation|pages=8|chapter=Starting the Game[/tpl] In most of the towns, talking to a king or minister saves the game. It also allows for the deletion and moving of saved games. This was an upgrade from the Japanese version, which utilized a password system to restore progress.
Dragon Warrior II is noted for greatly expanding upon the gameplay from the previous game, Dragon Warrior. Dragon Warrior II is the first game in the series to feature multiple heroes and enemies in a battle, as well as a sailing ship. Unlike Final Fantasy released that same year, which only allowed the player to dock the ship at ports, Dragon Quest II allowed the player to land the ship anywhere, allowing the entire game world to be explored in an open-ended manner. It was also the first to have weapons which cast spells when used in battles.[tpl]clarify|Ever, or just in the series?|date=July 2013[/tpl](1990) Nintendo, Enix America Corporation Licensed Nintendo of America Inc.

==Plot==

===Story===

Dragon Warrior II is set one hundred years after Dragon Warrior.[tpl]cite web | author=Majaski, Craig | date=October 9, 2000 | title=Dragon Warrior 1&2 review | url=http://www.gaming-age.com/cgi-bin/reviews/review.pl?sys=gameboy&game=dw12| work=| accessdate=2009-09-23[/tpl] The story begins with an attack upon Moonbrooke Castle by the wizard Hargon. A wounded soldier escaped the battle and fled to the kingdom of Midenhall, where he informs the king of the attack before he dies. The king them commands his son, who is a descendant of Erdrick (knowns as Loto in Japanese translations and later localizations), to defeat Hargon.[tpl]cite book |editor=Prima Games |title=Dragon Warrior Monsters Official Strategy Guide |year=2000 |publisher=Prima Publishing |isbn=0-7615-2730-3 |page=234[/tpl]Editors of Nintendo Power: Nintendo Power September/October, 1990; issue 16 (in English). Nintendo of America, Tokuma Shoten Publishing, 66.
The Prince begins his quest alone, but is later joined by two cousins: the Prince of Cannock and the Princess of Moonbrooke. After finding the Prince of Cannock, who began a similar journey at the same time as the Prince of Midenhall, Erdrick and Cannock save the Princess of Moonbrooke from Hargon's assault on Moonbrooke Castle. As the trio quest to find and defeat Hargon, they secure a ship which allows them to travel across oceans to reach new continents, including Alefgard, which is where Dragon Quest took place. There they meet the grandson of Dragonlord, the villain from the previous game, who gives the party valuable information.Dracolord's grandson: You can call me Kid Draco... [tpl]cite video game|title=Dragon Warrior |developer=Enix |publisher=Enix |date=2000-09-27 |platform=Game Boy Color[/tpl] He tells them that by collecting the five crests hidden around the world, the party can create the Charm of Rubiss, allowing them to defeat Hargon and his illusions.

===Setting===

The early part of the game takes place on land. From a few magical tiles or tunnels, the player can visit a few tiny islands in the beginning, but only upon reaching a major port and fulfilling a specific task does the player get a ship which allows the player to explore much more of the world by sea. Magical teleportation is the last means of transport that the player must use. Architecturally, some castles are presented as ruins.[tpl]cite book|title=Enix Corporation Unveiled Secrets of Dragon Warrior II | publisher=Enix America Corporation | page=9 |chapter=Moonbrooke Castle [/tpl]
The game world of Dragon Warrior, Alefgard, is included on the world map in Dragon Warrior II (albeit in slightly reduced scale), although it is possible to win the game without ever setting foot there.

===Characters===

==Development==

Like other main games in Dragon Quest series, Yuji Horii wrote the story, Akira Toriyama did the artwork, and Koichi Sugiyama composed the music. Co-creator Koichi Nakamura, Chunsoft's president, directed the game and did half of the programming.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.1up.com/features/koichi-nakamura-interview-console-rpg | title=Koichi Nakamura Interview: On the Birth of the Console RPG | author=Jeremy Parish | publisher=1UP.com | accessdate=2013-06-21[/tpl] Barely a year after the original Dragon Quest was released in Japan, Dragon Quest II was released on January 26, 1987.[tpl]cite journal |title=retrodiary: 07 January – 03 February |magazine=Retro Gamer |publisher=Imagine Publishing |location=Bournemouth |issue=85 |date=January 2011 |page=15 |issn=1742-3155 |oclc=489477015[/tpl] Compared with its predecessor, the game was better in nearly all aspects. Yuji Horii believed many players would play Dragon Warrior II without first playing Dragon Warrior and thus had players search for the other party members.
In original Japanese Famicom version, passwords were used for saving, but the NES version featured a save feature without passwords. The storyline introduction in Moonbrooke is present exclusively in Dragon Warrior II. In Dragon Quest II, the game starts right with the injured soldier from Moonbrooke entering Midenhall castle, seeking help from its king.Narration (first line of game translated): One day, a single wounded soldier arrived after a long struggle at Lorasia Castle.[tpl]cite video game|title=Dragon Quest II |developer=Enix |publisher=Enix |date=1986-01-26 |platform=Famicom[/tpl] Dialogue of American localization often used (intentionally) archaic English vocabulary, among other differences from the Japanese version.[tpl]cite web|title=Dragon Quest II|url=http://www.dqshrine.com/dq/dq2/|publisher=dqshrine.com|accessdate=18 July 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120704084455/http://www.dqshrine.com/dq/dq2/|archivedate=2012-07-04[/tpl] Like Dragon Warrior, the American version of Dragon Warrior II was censored in some aspects; for example, it used one ghost-like sprite instead of the original defeated character's coffin with cross sprite.
The world of Dragon Quest II was later used as the setting of Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart on the Game Boy Advance. It starred Kiefer, a hero from Dragon Warrior VII.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/dq/dqm3/reviews/dqm3strev1.html |title= Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart - Staff Retroview | author= Michael Baker | publisher=PRGamer | accessdate=2013-06-21[/tpl]

===Remakes===

Dragon Quest II was ported for MSX in February 1988,[tpl]cite web|title=ドラゴンクエストII 悪霊の神々 (MSX1版)|url=http://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=23570|publisher=Enterbrain|accessdate=22 June 2013|language=Japanese[/tpl] but the ported version had many issues, like choppy scrolling, black-surround characters titles, poor graphics, along with sluggish combat and menus. The MSX2 ported version was released in May 1988 in Japan.[tpl] cite web | url=http://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a=page_h_title&title_id=23571 | title=ドラゴンクエストII 悪霊の神々 (MSX2版) | publisher=Enterbrain | language=Japanese[/tpl]
On December 18, 1993,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jp.square-enix.com/archive/dq1-2_sfc/|title=ドラゴンクエスト I・II|publisher=Square Enix|accessdate=2012-03-24|language=Japanese[/tpl] Dragon Quest II was remade and combined with Dragon Quest as part of Dragon Quest I & II for the Super Famicom, which used Dragon Quest Vs engine. Besides enhanced in graphics and sound, gameplay was also improved. The Super Famicom remake features a smarter intelligent targeting system: if one enemy was defeated before your character's attacking, the character will attack another enemy rather than do nothing like in the Famicom version. And as its successors, players can find stat-improving items from pots or dressers.[tpl]cite web|title=Dragon Quest I+II|url=http://www.dqshrine.com/dq/dq1-2/|publisher=dqshrine.com|accessdate=18 July 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121022174320/http://www.dqshrine.com/dq/dq1-2/|archivedate=2012-10-22[/tpl] The Super Famicom remake was only released in Japan. In 1999, Dragon Quest I & II was released for Game Boy, and a year later, it was localized in America as Dragon Warrior I & II. Compare with NES version, it featured the better graphics and was reduced the difficulty; remake also provided a quick-save function which allows players save and load game anywhere unless they reset the Game Boy.[tpl]cite web|title=Dragon Warrior I+II|url=http://www.dqshrine.com/dw/dw1-2gb/|publisher=dqshrine.com|accessdate=18 July 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121019223126/http://www.dqshrine.com/dw/dw1-2gb/|archivedate=2012-10-19[/tpl] In the Game Boy Color localization, the main characters' and towns' names were retranslated to be similar to the original Japanese names: legendary hero "Erdrick" was retranslated as "Loto", and the castle name "Midenhall" was re-dubbed "Lorasia". The original translation had a lot of errors and Enix changed the names to fix that.[tpl]cite web|title=Dragon Warrior I & II Review|url=http://www.gamespot.com/dragon-warrior-i-and-ii/reviews/dragon-warrior-iandii-review-2635235/?page=2|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=22 June 2013|author=Frank Provo|date=September 29, 2000[/tpl] Both remakes added a few new scripts.

==Other media==

Similar to other main games in the series, Dragon Quest II was novelized and adapted to game books. The Dragon Quest II Novel was written by Hideo Takayashiki and published in 1989; it was reprinted in 1991 and 2000. The Dragon Quest II Game Book series was also published in 1989.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/magazine/lineup-book/janrubetu/game_other.html | title=ゲーム関連書籍 |publisher=Square Enix|accessdate=22 June 2013|language=Japanese[/tpl]

===Music===

Koichi Sugiyama composed and directed the music for the game.
The first album of Dragon Quest II, Suite Dragon Quest II ~Gods of the Evil Spirits~, was released in February 1987. It covers ten orchestra version soundtracks with a twenty-five minutes "original sound story"; this suite was performed by Tokyo Strings Ensemble. Some of them are classical and some are jazz-style.[tpl]cite web|title=Suite Dragon Quest II ~Gods of the Evil Spirits~|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/dq2-ss/index.html|publisher=RPGFan|accessdate=21 June 2013|author=Patrick Gann[/tpl] On August 20, 1987, the first "Family Classic Concert" was held.

Dragon Quest II is generally known for fixing problems found in the first game, including improvements such as allowing parties of three characters, having a larger world, better graphics, and the ability to carry more items.[tpl]cite web | author=Provo, Frank | date=September 24, 2000 | title=Dragon Warrior I&II review | url=http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/rpg/dragonwarrior1_2/review.html?tag=mncol;txt| work=Gamespot.com | accessdate=2009-09-23[/tpl] Other noted improvements were keys that can be used multiple times and new strategic elements introduced because of larger parties and larger groups of enemies. The game's music is often praised, despite its limited 8-bit capabilities. Considered a classic for the RPG genre, the game is regarded as praiseworthy.[tpl]cite web | author= | date=September 21, 2000 | title=Dragon Warrior I&II | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/dragonwarrior1&2/Dragon_Warrior_1&2.html| work=RPGfan.com | accessdate=2009-09-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web | author=Nix, Mark | date=October 4, 2000 | title=Dragon Warrior I&II | url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/164/164493p1.html| work=IGN.com | accessdate=2009-09-23[/tpl]
Japanese reviews highlighted the Famicom versions difficulty, stemming from issues such as the many traps in the Cave of Rhone, and the final boss's ability to cast a "Healall" spell, and this has lead to some critics calling the game "the most difficult Dragon Quest".[tpl]cite journal|journal=オトナファミ2009 April|date=2009-02-20|pages=53|publisher=Enterbrain|location=Japan|language=Japanese[/tpl]
Famitsu awarded the Japanese Super Famicom remake a 35/40. While Game Boy Color remake got a 30/40 from Famitsu, Dragon Warrior I + II received fairly high marks in America.
