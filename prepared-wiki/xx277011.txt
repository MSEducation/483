[[Tree kernel]]

CATEGORIES: Kernel methods for machine learning, Natural language processing, Trees (data structures)

In machine learning, a tree kernel is a kernel function that computes a similarity score between two trees. Such kernels find applications in natural language processing, where they can be used for machine-learned parsing.[tpl]cite conference |authorlink1=Michael Collins (computational linguist) |last1=Collins |first1=Michael |first2=Nigel |last2=Duffy |title=Convolution kernels for natural language |conference=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems |year=2001[/tpl]
