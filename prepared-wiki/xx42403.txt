The Cosby Show is an American television sitcom starring Bill Cosby, which aired for eight seasons on NBC from September 20, 1984 until April 30, 1992. The show focuses on the Huxtable family, an upper middle-class African-American family living in Brooklyn, New York.
According to TV Guide, the show "was TV's biggest hit in the 1980s, and almost single-handedly revived the sitcom genre and NBC's ratings fortunes".[tpl]cite web|title=The Cosby Show: Cast & Details|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/cosby/cast/100456|work=TV Guide|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=August 5, 2013[/tpl] Entertainment Weekly stated that The Cosby Show helped to make possible a larger variety of shows with a predominantly African-American cast, from In Living Color to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,310369_2,00.html|title=The Cosby Show's Last Laugh|date=May 1, 1992|accessdate=October 28, 2007|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time, Inc.| quote=The show that changed forever the way black families are portrayed on television, the show that paved the way for a rainbow of African-American sensibilities on TV from In Living Color to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is getting razzed these days by The Simpsons. |first=Lisa |last=Schwarzbaum[/tpl]
The Cosby Show was based on comedy routines in Cosby's stand-up act, which in turn were based on his family life. The show helped inspire a number of later sitcoms starring a stand-up comedian and based around that comedian's onstage persona, including highly successful series such as Roseanne, Seinfeld, Home Improvement and Everybody Loves Raymond. The show spawned the spin-off A Different World, which ran for six seasons from 1987 to 1993.

===Episodes===

====Pilot====

The Cosby Show pilot episode uses the same title sequence as the rest of the first season, and is widely regarded as the 'first episode'. However, it is notable for a number of differences from the remainder of the series.
In the pilot, the Huxtables have only four children.[tpl]cite web|last=Kovalchik|first=Kara|title=5 Mysteries Surrounding The Cosby Show|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/18406/5-mysteries-surrounding-cosby-show|work=Mental Floss|accessdate=August 7, 2013|date=April 9, 2008[/tpl] Following the pilot, the Huxtables have five children, with the addition of their eldest daughter, Sondra (Sabrina Le Beauf), who is mentioned in episode four and appears first in episode ten. The character was created when Bill Cosby wanted the show to express the accomplishment of successfully raising a child (i.e., a college graduate).[tpl]cite web|last=Alston|first=Joshua|title=How The Cosby Show spoke to race and class in '80s America|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/how-the-cosby-show-spoke-to-race-and-class-in-80s,87848/|work=The A.V. Club|accessdate=August 6, 2013|date=October 24, 2012[/tpl] Whitney Houston was considered for the role of Sondra Huxtable. Houston, however, was unable to commit to the full-time television production schedule in the NBC contract as she was intending to be a full-time music recording artist.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20131615,00.html|title=The Cosby Show: 1984–1992|date=June 26, 2000 |accessdate=November 19, 2010 |work=People[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Sondra Huxtable Tibideaux|url=http://www.tvland.com/shows/bill-cosby-show/bios/sabrina-lebeauf|work=TV Land|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=August 6, 2013[/tpl] 
Bill Cosby's character is called "Clifford" in the early episodes of the first season (as evidenced by his name plate on the exterior of the Huxtable home). His name was later switched to "Heathcliff". Additionally, Vanessa refers to Theo as "Teddy" twice in the dining room scene.
The interior of the Huxtables' home features an entirely different living room from subsequent episodes, and different color schemes in the dining room and the master bedroom. Throughout the remainder of the series, the dining room is reserved for more formal occasions.

==Background and production==

===Conception and development===

In the early 1980s, Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, two former executives at ABC, left the network to start their own production company.[tpl]cite book|last1=Alley|first1=Robert S.|last2=Brown|first2=Irby B.|title=Women Television Producers: Transformation of the Male Medium|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rHlNnofFfqUC&pg=PA255|accessdate=August 5, 2013|year=2001|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-58046-045-3|page=255[/tpl] At ABC, they had overseen sitcoms such as Mork & Mindy, Three's Company and Welcome Back, Kotter. The two decided in order to get a sitcom to sell for their fledgling company, they needed a big name behind it. Bill Cosby, who during the 1970s starred in two failed sitcoms, produced award-winning stand-up comedy albums, and had roles in several different films, was relatively quiet during the early 1980s.
Outside of his work on his cartoon series Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, Cosby was doing little in film or television, but Carsey and Warner were fans of Cosby's stand-up comedy and thought it would be the perfect material for a family sitcom.[tpl]cite book|last=Marc|first=David|title=Prime Time, Prime Movers: From I Love Lucy to L.A.

During its original run at NBC, it was one of five successful sitcoms on the network that featured predominately African-American casts. The other sitcoms were 227 (1985–1990), Amen (1986–1991), Cosby Show spin-off A Different World (1987–1993), and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (1990–1996).
Although the cast and characters were predominately African American,[tpl]cite book|last1=Rainer|first1=Thom S.|last2=Rainer|first2=Jess W.|title=The Millennials: Connecting to America's Largest Generation|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=C8IWXtBgh7MC&pg=PA53|accessdate=February 11, 2014|date=January 1, 2011|publisher=B&H Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4336-7003-9|page=53[/tpl] the program was unusual in that issues of race were rarely mentioned when compared to other situation comedies of the time, such as The Jeffersons.[tpl]cite book|last1=Franz|first1=Kathleen|last2=Smulyan|first2=Susan|title=Major Problems in American Popular Culture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oKdalT-JurQC&pg=PA376|accessdate=August 5, 2013|year=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-618-47481-3|page=376|quote=I won't deal with the foolishness of racial undertones on the show.[/tpl] However, The Cosby Show had African-American themes, such as the Civil Rights Movement, and it frequently promoted African-American and African culture represented by artists and musicians such as Jacob Lawrence, Miles Davis, James Brown, B.B.

===Theme song and opening sequence===

The show's theme music, "Kiss Me", was composed by Stu Gardner and Bill Cosby.[tpl]cite book|last=Wright|first=H.

For season four, the theme song music was performed by musician Bobby McFerrin.[tpl]cite web|title=Bobby McFerrin – Biography|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/artist/bobby-mcferrin/id63710|work=iTunes|accessdate=August 5, 2013|quote=McFerrin also earned mainstream exposure through his unique performance of the theme song to the television hit The Cosby Show[/tpl]

*Phylicia Rashād was credited as "Phylicia Ayers-Allen" during season one and the first fourteen episodes of season two.
†Prior to joining the cast as a regular, Joseph C. Phillips appears as Daryl, a potential boyfriend for Sondra in season two (episode: "Cliff in Love").

==Reception==

The show's portrayal of a successful, stable black family was praised by some for breaking racial stereotypes and showing another part of the African-American experience.[tpl]cite book|last=Whitaker|first=Matthew C.|title=Icons of Black America: Breaking Barriers and Crossing Boundaries|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bT1jf8PcqAUC&pg=PA193|accessdate=August 5, 2013|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-37642-9|page=193[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Shaw|first=Harry B.|title=Perspectives of Black Popular Culture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=407y3M8nfz0C&pg=PA134|accessdate=August 5, 2013|date=January 1, 1990|publisher=Popular Press|isbn=978-0-87972-504-4|pages=134–135[/tpl] However, it was criticized by others, including Henry Louis Gates, for allowing white audiences to think that racism and poverty were problems of the past.[tpl]cite news|title= TV's Black World Turns—But Stays Unreal |work= The New York Times|date=November 12, 1989|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/12/arts/tv-s-black-world-turns-but-stays-unreal.html?pagewanted=4|accessdate=November 9, 2010[/tpl]

==Syndication==

Carsey-Werner Distribution handles domestic and international distribution of the series, and has done so since 1997. In the United States, The Cosby Show began its television syndication run in September 1988 in broadcast syndication, shortly before the show's fifth season premiere, and was at the time distributed by Viacom; many stations that carried the series were Big Three network affiliates, though since the mid-1990s, the show has largely begun airing on independent stations and minor network affiliates.
Dallas-based KTVT (now a CBS owned-and-operated station), carried the series during the early 1990s, until that station dropped its status as an independent station and regional cable superstation in 1995. TBS, then a national cable superstation at the time it debuted on the channel, began carrying the series in 1999 and ran it for almost a decade. Fellow superstation WGN America began carrying the series shortly after, and continued to until September 2010. Nick at Nite began airing reruns of the series in March 2002. Sister network TV Land began airing reruns in 2004, however, unlike most series that have aired on sister channel Nick at Nite before moving to TV Land in the past and since then, up until September 2010, The Cosby Show was carried on both Nick at Nite and TV Land. As of September 2012 TV Land has resumed broadcasting the series.
As of September 27, 2010, Centric airs the series. Malaysia's national TV broadcast channel RTM TV2 also airs the series, as does Canada's Crossroads Television System. In 2011, Netflix added the entire series to instant stream, before removing it in 2012. It's now available on Hulu Plus.

==Spin-off==

The Cosby Show's producers created a spin-off series called A Different World that was built around the "Denise" character (portrayed by actress Lisa Bonet), the second of the Huxtables' four daughters. Initially, the new program dealt with Denise's life at Hillman College, the fictional historically black college from which her father, mother, and paternal grandfather had graduated. Denise was written out of A Different World after its inaugural season, due to Bonet's pregnancy, and the following season was revamped, with the addition of director Debbie Allen and new characters.[tpl]cite book|last=McCann|first=Bob|title=Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=X7ZYsnTPIhwC&pg=PA50|accessdate=August 5, 2013|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5804-2|page=50[/tpl] Denise later became a recurring character on The Cosby Show for seasons four and five, and a regular again in seasons six and seven.

==DVD releases==

All eight seasons of The Cosby Show have been released on DVD in Region 1. Seasons one and two were released by UrbanWorks which was subsequently acquired by First Look Studios, who then released the remaining six seasons. Seasons one and two contain special features including the 90-minute retrospective documentary entitled "The Cosby Show: A Look Back" which aired on NBC in 2002. It contains interviews with cast members, bloopers, deleted scenes and audition footage. In 2010, First Look Studios filed bankruptcy and all its assets were subsequently acquired by Millennium Entertainment who also took over distribution of The Cosby Show DVD releases.  As of 2013, these releases have been discontinued and are now out of print.
On November 5, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to the series.  They subsequently re-released the first two seasons on January 21, 2014.Mill Creek Re-Releasing 'Seasons 1 and 2' on DVD  Seasons 3 & 4 will be re-released on April 15, 2014.'Seasons 3 & 4' from Mill Creek: Package Pics, Date Change
In Region 4, Magna Pacific has released all eight seasons on DVD in Australia and New Zealand. The first two seasons have similar artwork to the North American copies, although season two is red rather than blue. Each Australian cover also features the tagline "In a house full of love, there is always room for more".
Universal Pictures UK has released seasons 1–4 in Region 2 (UK).
Note: The Millennium Entertainment release of season one contains the edited versions of the episodes aired in syndication. However, all subsequent DVD releases (including the complete series set) contain the original, uncut broadcast versions. In 2011, Millennium Entertainment quietly released season one uncut in Region 1 and it featured the special features from the complete series set.
