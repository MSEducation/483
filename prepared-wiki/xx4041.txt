===Transportation===

====Highways====

The predominant form of transportation in Houston is the automobile with 71.7 percent of residents driving alone to work[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/prod/1/gen/pio/cay961a2.pdf |format=PDF |title=Census and You |publisher=US Census Bureau |page=12|date=January 1996 |accessdate=2007-02-19[/tpl] This is facilitated through Houston's freeway system, comprising [tpl]convert|739.3|mi|km|1[/tpl] of freeways and expressways in a ten-county metropolitan area."[tpl]PDFlink|Highway System|153 KB[/tpl]", Greater Houston Partnership. Retrieved on 2009-03-21. However, the Texas Transportation Institute's annual Urban Mobility Report found that Houston had the fourth-worst congestion in the country with commuters spending an average of 58 hours in traffic in 2009.[tpl]cite news|title=Which cities have the worst traffic?|url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/20/which-cities-have-the-worst-traffic/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 15, 2011|date=January 20, 2011[/tpl]
Houston's highway system has a hub-and-spoke freeway structure serviced by multiple loops. The innermost loop is Interstate 610, which encircles downtown, the medical center, and many core neighborhoods with around a [tpl]convert|10|mi|km|0|sing=on[/tpl] diameter. Beltway 8 and its freeway core, the Sam Houston Tollway, form the middle loop at a diameter of roughly [tpl]convert|25|mi|km|0[/tpl]. A proposed highway project, State Highway 99 (Grand Parkway), would form a third loop outside of Houston. As of 2010, only two out of eleven segments of State Highway 99 have been completed. Houston is located along the route of the proposed Interstate 69 NAFTA superhighway that would link Canada, the U.S. industrial Midwest, Texas, and Mexico. Other spoke freeways either planned or under construction include the Fort Bend Parkway, Hardy Toll Road, Crosby Freeway, and the future Alvin Freeway.
Houston's freeway system is monitored by Houston TranStar—a partnership of four government agencies that are responsible for providing transportation and emergency management services to the region.About Houston TranStar. Houston TranStar. 2008. Retrieved on 2008-02-17.

Houston's aviation history is showcased in the 1940 Air Terminal Museum located in the old terminal building on the west side of the airport. Hobby Airport has been recognized with two awards for being one of the top five performing airports in the world and for customer service by Airports Council International.
