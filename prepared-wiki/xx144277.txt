==Sphinx Senior Society==

The Sphinx Senior Society University of Pennsylvania, founded in 1900, is the oldest honor society at Penn, recognizing the top seniors who have made significant contributions to the university as leaders of the campus. Continuing in this tradition, the society has come to represent all facets of university life and has reflected the changing face of Penn’s student body. Members today include leaders in student government, performing arts, media, service groups, cultural organizations, Greek life, athletics, and other realms of student affairs. Sphinx was the first senior society at Penn to admit African-Americans, doing so in 1952,NEGROES ELECTED TO SPHINX AT U.OF P|New York Times, May 24, 1952> and in February 1971 Male Honor Society at Penn Planing to Admit Women||New York Times, February 07, 1971> was the first to admit women.

==Friars Senior Society==

Founded in 1901 by Daniel Keller, Friars Senior Society is one of several senior societies at the University of Pennsylvania and is considered the most active by alumni and undergraduates. It was founded to protest cliques and strive against caddishness and snobbery, and to establish uncompromising democracy in University activities. Friars promotes interaction between those from all walks of life who have given their time and energies to making the University what it is; hence, the name Friars, for those who sacrifice their time during college to meaningful activities.
Each Friar senior class is composed of  student leaders 'tapped' during the spring of their junior leaders year (where it accepts at least 20 into the society), and another 12 or so senior leaders taken in the fall. Membership is intentionally drawn from all walks of campus: the only common thread is that everyone in the society are top leaders and contribute to the Penn community. Typically, the group consists of about 1/3 athletic captains or otherwise excellent players, 1/3 performing arts leaders, and 1/3 Greek, Government, Publications and Community Service leaders. Members support each other throughout the year through attendance at shows and events and they perform various community service projects during their senior year as well. In 2004 it held its first Friarside Coffeehouse that has raised thousands of dollars for charity while bringing the talents of Penn's performing arts groups to the masses. Friars first admitted women in the spring of 1971.
Once Friars graduate, they still remain active in the organization. Friars receive regular Friar communication throughout the year and have half a dozen Friar alumni events they can attend at Penn and around the country which is why they are considered the most active group of its kind at Penn.  As of 2013, the Friars Alumni Association numbered over 1950 worldwide and is governed by the Friars Graduate Board.
Famous Friars include:
Ed Rendell (Governor of Pennsylvania),
Harold Ford (Tennessee Congressman),
Jack McCloskey (NBA Coach and General Manager),
Fran Dunphy (Temple basketball coach),
David Montgomery (President, Philadelphia Phillies),
Mark DeRosa (Professional Baseball Player),
Elizabeth Banks (Actress),
Vanessa Bayer (Comedian on Saturday Night Live),
Samuel Campbell III (Created the Moon Pie),

==Onyx Senior Society==

The Onyx Senior Honor Society was founded at the University of Pennsylvania in 1974 by seven university students: Claudette Christian, Craig Inge, Sharon Moorer, Linda Walker, Charles Wardlaw, Joseph Watkins and Robert Wilson. These pioneers, with the aid of administrators Provost Elliot, Dean of Students, Alice E. Emerson, and Associate Dean of Students, Harold Haskins, formed the honor society to encourage and provide incentive for high academic achievement and community service at the university. These collaborators sought to recognize and commend outstanding performance within, and outside of, the classroom. The organization has played and continues to play a significant role in promoting academic success and survival for minority students operating in an often competitive environment.
One of the goals of Onyx was to re-establish the Society for African-American Students at the University of Pennsylvania. The society provided an all expenses paid program for black students in the summer before their first year. The program lasted from 1969–72 and concentrated on preparing its participants for the academic mainstream by providing books, room and board, a stipend, and two credited courses. This program later birthed the Pre-Freshman Program. In response to such changes, the goals of Onyx have also changed and developed over time. In the past, Onyx has focused on forums as a means to inform the campus community about black issues. Some topics have included the organization and promotion of networking and support within the black community as well as the provision of mentoring for both the campus and surrounding Philadelphia communities. Onyx hopes to create a positive social experience for blacks at the university and to recognize black achievement past and present. Notable members include John "Legend" Stevens and Marc Morial.

==Osiris Senior Society==

Osiris, founded in the spring of 2013 by Lainie Huston and Jackson Foster, brings together senior leaders and outstanding members of the performing arts community at the University of Pennsylvania. The society draws its name from the god Osiris, who was believed by some in ancient Greco-Egyptian times to have been the god who brought together the 9 muses. Similarly, the society provides a forum for students of different art forms, including vocal, dance, theatrical, instrumental, photographic, and tech among others, to strengthen ties across the performing arts community. Throughout the year, members attend social events and support each other at shows, and each May members perform a senior showcase highlighting the talents of these students and fostering collaborative performance.Osiris Senior Society
