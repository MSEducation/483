[[Trellis (graph)]]

CATEGORIES: Graph families, Telecommunication theory

A trellis is a graph whose nodes are ordered into vertical slices (time), and with each node at each time connected to at least one node at an earlier and at least one node at a later time. The earliest and latest times in the trellis have only one node.
Trellises are used in encoders and decoders for communication theory and encryption. They are also the central datatype used in Baum-Welch algorithm for Hidden Markov Models.
