Icy Bay is a body of water in southeast Alaska, formed in the last 100 years by the rapid retreat of the Guyot, Yahtse, and Tyndall Glaciers.  It is part of the Wrangell-Saint Elias Wilderness.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the bay entrance was permanently blocked by a giant tidewater glacier face that calved icebergs directly into the Gulf of Alaska. A century-long glacial retreat has opened a multi-armed bay more than  long.
Icy Bay is popular destination for sea kayakers, and is reachable by bush plane from Yakutat.
