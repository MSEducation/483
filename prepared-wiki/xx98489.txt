==Establishment==

The United States Pacific Command was established on 1 January 1947 by President Harry Truman and was originally headquartered in the Salt Lake subdivision of Honolulu. It took control over all Armed Forces of the United States in what was once called the Pacific Theater during World War II. In 1972, the United States Pacific Command's responsibilities were greatly expanded to include the Indian Ocean, Southern Asia, and the Arctic. In 1976, it was again expanded to include parts of Africa. President Ronald Reagan expanded it again with the inclusion of the People's Republic of China, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia and Madagascar. In 1989, actions were taken to clarify the extent of authority given to the Commander, Pacific Command.

==Force structure==

USPACOM is a unified command which includes about 300,000 military personnel from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps (about 20 percent of all active duty U.S. military forces). These forces are in three categories: Forward-Deployed (about 100,000), Forward-Based, and Continental U.S. (CONUS)-Based which comprise the remainder.

==Humanitarian missions==

In Asia, one of the most effective and impressive ad hoc multilateral efforts took place in the wake of the horrific December 2004 earthquake and tsunami that left some three hundred thousand people dead or missing, with upwards of a million more displaced in eleven South Asian and Southeast Asian nations. As devastating as the damage was, it could have been much worse if it had not been for the rapid response by the international community. At the height of the relief effort, some sixteen thousand U.S. military personnel were deployed throughout the areas most affected by tragedy; more than two dozen U.S. ships (including a the aircraft Carrier Strike Group Nine, a Marine amphibious group, and a hospital ship) and more than one hundred aircraft were dedicated to the disaster-relief effort, along with forces from Australia, Canada, Japan, India, and the affected countries.Michael J.
