==Etymology==

An age old legemd about the origin of the name Chengamanadu goes like this: A prince of the then Desinganadu Kingdom went to Arabia and fallen in love with an Arabian beauty. He managed to elope with her back to his home land. But the girl's father traced their location and followed them to take her back. Knowing his arrival the lovers decided to leave the place and started off to Tamil Nadu via Aryankavu route in a single bullock ridden cart. On their way when they reached our place it was becoming heavily dark and the area was then a dense forest. There they met one woman named "Nangamma", she gave them refuge in her house to spend the night. The next day morning they continued their journey. After a long time the Prince has returned to meet Nengamma who has given him shelter, but could not meet her. Through the Prince, the forest land of Nangamma came to be known as "Nangammakadu" and later in the current form Chengamanadu.
