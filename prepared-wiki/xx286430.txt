Thomas Weir was a strict Protestant whose spoken prayers earned him a reputation that attracted visitors to his home in Edinburgh. Following his retirement in 1670, Weir fell ill and began to confess to a secret life of crime and vice. The Lord Provost initially found the confession implausible and took no action, but eventually Weir and his spinster sister, Jane Weir, were taken to the Edinburgh Tolbooth for interrogation. Major Weir, now in his seventies, continued to expand on his confession and Jane Weir gave an even more exaggerated history of witchcraft, sorcery and vice.[tpl]cite book |last=Chambers |first=R |title=Traditions of Edinburgh |year=1824 |publisher=W & R Chambers Ltd. reprint 1980 |location=Edinburgh |isbn=0 550 21292 2 |page=33[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Supernatural Scotland: Major Weir|url=http://www.scotclans.com/scottish_myths/supernatural_scotland/major_weir.html|work=Scottish Clans|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl]  
The trial began on April 9, 1670. Jane Weir confessed that their mother had been a witch and had taught her children. She also revealed that Thomas bore the mark of the Beast on his body and that they frequently roamed the countryside in a fiery coach. 
Weir was born near Carluke in Lanarkshire.
