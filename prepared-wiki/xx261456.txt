[[Brandenberg Alps]]

CATEGORIES: Brandenberg Alps, Mountain ranges of Tyrol (state)

The Brandenberg Alps ([tpl]lang-de|Brandenberger Alpen[/tpl]) are a sub-group of the Northern Limestone Alps, that run in front of the Eastern Alps for their whole length. They lie entirely in Austria between Achensee in Tyrol, the Inn Valley and the Bavarian Prealps.
They are widely known in German as the Rofangebirge, although the actual Rofan (also Sonnwendgebirge) is only the western part of the area between the Brandenberger Ache stream and the Achensee lake. It consists of a central mountain group and three individual mountains. The Guffert (2,195 m), which is located outside the central group, forms a distinct mountain block. It is located north of Kramsach, between the Tegernsee Blauberge and the central Rofan. The Unn√ºtze, at the northern end of the Achensee east of Achenkirch, and the Ebener Joch (1,957 m) east of Maurach at the southern end of the Achensee, are also outside the central mountain range.
