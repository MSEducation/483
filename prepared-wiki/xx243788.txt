[[Cosocle]]

CATEGORIES: Group theory

In mathematics, the term cosocle has several related meanings.
In group theory, a cosocle of a group G, denoted by   Cosoc(G), is the intersection of all maximal normal subgroups of G. Adolfo Ballester-Bolinches, Luis M. Ezquerro, Classes of Finite Groups, 2006, ISBN	1402047185,  p. 97
If G is a quasisimple group, then Cosoc(G) = Z(G).
In the context of Lie algebras, a cosocle of a symmetric Lie algebra is the eigenspace of its structural automorphism which corresponds to the eigenvalue +1. (A symmetric Lie algebra decomposes into the direct sum of its socle and cosocle.)Mikhail Postnikov, Geometry VI: Riemannian Geometry, 2001,  ISBN	3540411089,p. 98
