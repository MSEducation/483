Bridgwater is a market town and civil parish in Somerset, England. It is the administrative centre of the Sedgemoor district, and a major industrial centre. Bridgwater is located on the major communication routes through South West England. According to the 2011 census, the town had a population of 35,886.
Bridgwater is situated, on the edge of the Somerset Levels, in level and well-wooded country, having to the north the Mendip range and on the west the Quantock hills. The town lies along both sides of the River Parrett, [tpl]convert|10|mi|km|0[/tpl] from its mouth, has been a major port and trading centre and maintains a large industrial base. It is linked to Taunton by the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal. Bridgwater is located between two junctions of the M5 motorway and Bridgwater railway station is on the main railway line between Bristol and Taunton.
Historically, the town had a politically radical tendency, being involved in several events of note on the national stage, and was defended by its own castle. The battlefield of the Battle of Sedgemoor, where the Monmouth Rebellion was finally crushed in 1685 is nearby. Among several places of worship the chief is the Church of St Mary. A house in Blake Street, largely restored, was the birthplace of Admiral Blake in 1598, and is now the Blake Museum. The town has its own arts centre and plays host to the annual Bridgwater Guy Fawkes Carnival.

==Etymology==

It is thought that the town was originally called Brigg, meaning quay. It has been argued that the name may instead come from the Old English brycg (gang plank) or Old Norse bryggja (quay), though this idea has been opposed on etymological grounds. In the Domesday Book the town is listed as Brugie, while Brugia was also used. After the Norman invasion the land was given to Walter of Douai,[tpl]cite book |title=Somerset Monasteries |last=Dunning |first=Robert |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Tempus  |location=Stroud |isbn=0-7524-1941-2 |page=21 [/tpl] hence becoming known variously as Burgh-Walter, Brugg-Walter and Brigg-Walter, eventually corrupted to Bridgwater. An alternative version is that it derives from "Bridge of Walter" (i.e. Walter's Bridge).[tpl]cite book |last=Robinson |first=Stephen |authorlink= |title=Somerset Place Names |year=1992 |publisher=The Dovecote Press Ltd |location=Wimbourne |isbn=1-874336-03-2[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Somerset Harbours |last=Farr |first=Grahame |authorlink= |year=1954 |publisher=Christopher Johnson |location=London |isbn= |pages=101–116 [/tpl]

==History==

Bridgwater is mentioned both in the Domesday Book and in the earlier Anglo-Saxon Chronicle dating from around 800, owing its origin as a trade centre to its position at the mouth of the chief river in Somerset. It was formerly part of the Hundred of North Petherton.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18631|title=North Petherton Hundred'|last=Dunning|first=RW|author2=C R Elrington|author3=A P Baggs|author4=M C Siraut|year=1992|work=A History of the County of Somerset: Volume 6: Andersfield, Cannington, and North Petherton Hundreds (Bridgwater and neighbouring parishes)|publisher=British History Online|pages=178–181|accessdate=14 March 2010[/tpl] In a legend of Alfred the Great, he burnt some cakes while hiding in the marshes of Athelney near Bridgwater, after the Danish invasion in 875, while in 878 the major engagement of the Battle of Cynwit may have been at nearby Cannington.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18555&strquery=Cannington |title=Cannington |accessdate=13 January 2008 |format= |work=British History Online [/tpl]
William Briwere was granted the lordship of the Manor of Bridgwater by John of England in 1201, and founded Bridgwater Friary.[tpl]cite web|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=12435|title=Franciscan Friary and later mansion, Bridgwater|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=6 January 2010[/tpl] Through Briwere's influence, King John granted three charters in 1200; for the construction of Bridgwater Castle, for the creation of a borough, and for a market.[tpl]cite book |title=Curiosities of Somerset |last=Leete-Hodge |first=Lornie |authorlink= |year=1985 |publisher=Bossiney Books |location=Bodmin |isbn=0-906456-98-3 |pages=75 [/tpl] Bridgwater Castle was a substantial structure built in Old Red Sandstone, covering a site of 8 or 9 acres (32,000 to 36,000 m²). A tidal moat, up to [tpl]convert|65|ft|m|0[/tpl] wide in places, flowed about along the line of the modern thoroughfares of Fore Street and Castle Moat, and between Northgate and Chandos Street. The main entrance opposite the Cornhill was built with a pair of adjacent gates and drawbridges. In addition to a keep, located at the south-east corner of what is now King Square, documents show that the complex included a dungeon, chapel, stables and a bell tower. Built on the only raised ground in the town, the castle controlled the crossing of the town bridge. A [tpl]convert|12|ft|m|0[/tpl] thick portion of the castle wall and water gate can still be seen on West Quay, and the remains of a wall of a building that was probably built within the castle can be viewed in Queen Street. The foundations of the tower forming the north-east corner of the castle are buried beneath Homecastle House.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bridgwater.net/Town/About_Town/castle/bridgwater_castle_trail.htm|title=Bridgwater Castle Trail|publisher=Bridgwater Town Web|accessdate=14 March 2010[/tpl] William Briwere also founded St John's hospital[tpl]cite web |url=http://exmoorencyclopedia.org.uk/contents-list/34-b/182-bridgwater.html |title=Bridgwater |accessdate=6 June 2012 |work=Everything Exmoor [/tpl] which, by the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII, was worth the substantial sum of almost 121 pounds,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.friarn.co.uk/StJohn/|title=The Hospital of St John the Baptist Bridgwater |publisher=Friarn.co.uk|accessdate=28 March 2009[/tpl] as well as starting the construction of the town's first stone bridge.

During the 11th century Second Barons' War against Henry III, Bridgwater was held by the barons against the King. Other charters were granted by Henry III in 1227 (confirmed in 1318, 1370, 1380), which gave Bridgwater a gild merchant which was important for the regulation of trade allowing gild members to trade freely in the town, and to impose payments and restrictions upon others. Bridgwater's peasants under Nicholas Frampton took part in the Peasants' Revolt of 1381,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.friarn.co.uk/StJohn/|title=The Hospital of St John the Baptist Bridgwater |publisher=Friarn.co.uk|accessdate=18 August 2009[/tpl] sacking Sydenham House, murdering the local tax collectors and destroying the records.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~smedlo/Bridgwater/Bridgwater.htm |title=Radical History |accessdate=20 January 2008 |work=Bridgwater [/tpl]
It was incorporated by charter of Edward IV (1468), confirmed in 1554, 1586, 1629 and 1684. Parliamentary representation began in 1295 and continued until the Reform Act of 1870 when the original borough constituency was disenfranchised for corruption in 1870.[tpl]cite book |last=Craig |first=F.

Another fair at the beginning of Lent was added in 1468, and a second market on Thursday, and fairs at Midsummer and on 21 September were added in 1554. Charles II granted another fair on 29 December. The importance of these markets and fairs for the sale of wool and wine, and later of cloth in declined after medieval times. The shipping trade of the port revived after the construction of the new dock in 1841, and corn and timber have been imported for centuries.[tpl]cite book|last=Bush|first=Robin|authorlink=Robin Bush (historian)|title=Somerset: The Complete Guide|publisher=Dovecote Press|location=Wimborne|year=1994|pages=41–44|isbn=1-874336-26-1[/tpl]

In the English Civil War the town and the castle were held by the Royalists under Colonel Francis Wyndham, a personal acquaintance of the King. British history might have been very different had his wife, Lady (Crystabella) Wyndham, been a little more accurate with a musket shot that missed Cromwell but killed his aide de camp.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bridgwatersomerset.info/history_4_english_civil_war.php|title=The English Civil War |publisher=Bridgwater Somerset|accessdate=13 March 2010[/tpl] Eventually, with many buildings destroyed in the town, the castle and its valuable contents were surrendered to the Parliamentarians on 21 July 1645. The castle itself was deliberately destroyed the following year, while in 1651 Colonel Wyndham made arrangements for Charles II to flee to France following the Battle of Worcester.
Following the restoration of the monarchy, in 1663 the non-conformist Reverend John Norman, vicar from 1647 to 1660, was one of several 'religious fanatics' confined to their homes by Lord Stawell's militia. A large religious meeting house, thought to have been Presbyterian, was demolished and its furniture burned on the Cornhill in 1683.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18649 |title=Bridgwater:Protestant nonconformity |accessdate=20 January 2008 |format= |work=British History Online [/tpl] By 1688, matters had calmed down enough that a new chapel, Christ Church, was founded in Dampiet Street,  the congregation of which became Unitarian in 1815.[tpl]cite web | title=Christ Church Unitarian Chapel | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=373868 | accessdate=20 January 2008[/tpl]

Bridgwater is centred on an outcrop of marl in an area dominated by low-lying alluvial deposits. There are local deposits of gravels and sand.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/hes/downloads/EUS_BridgwaterText.pdf |title=Bridgwater archaeological survey |last=Gathercole |first=Clare|accessdate=2 February 2010 |format= |work=Somerset County Council [/tpl] It is situated in a level and well-wooded area, on the edge of the Somerset Levels. To the north are the Mendip range and on the west the Quantock hills. The town lies along both sides of the River Parrett, [tpl]convert|10|mi|km|0[/tpl] from its mouth, which then flows to discharge into the Bridgwater Bay National Nature Reserve. It consists of large areas of mud flats, saltmarsh, sandflats and shingle ridges, some of which are vegetated.

===Climate===

Along with the rest of South West England, Bridgwater has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country.[tpl]cite web | title=South West England: climate | work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ | accessdate=14 March 2010[/tpl] The annual mean temperature is approximately [tpl]convert|10|°C|°F|1|lk=on[/tpl]. Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately [tpl]convert|21|°C|°F|1[/tpl]. In winter mean minimum temperatures of [tpl]convert|1|or|2|°C|°F[/tpl] are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around [tpl]convert|700|mm|abbr=on[/tpl]. About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

==Demography==

Bridgwater had a population of 35,800 according to the 2001 census (up from 22,718 in 1951, 3,634 in 1801, and 7,807 in 1831).

==Economy==

As early as 1300, the port exported wheat, peas and beans to Ireland, France and Spain, and by 1400 was also exporting cloth from Somerset and the adjoining counties. By 1500 it was the largest port in Somerset,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/Depts/History/Maritime/Sources/1565bridgwater.htm |title=Bridgwater Port Survey, 14 May 1565 |accessdate=20 January 2008 |work=Department of Historical Studies, University of Bristol [/tpl] later becoming the fifth largest in England,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wow4water.net/media/images/2007116111743.pdf|title=Bridgwater and Taunton Canal Information pack|publisher=wow4water|pages=2|accessdate=4 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.birminghamuk.com/bridgewater.htm|title=The County of Somerset|publisher=Birmingham UK|accessdate=4 April 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.campbellroom.org.uk/en/education.html|title=Educational visits and residential field trips|publisher=The Campbell Room|accessdate=4 April 2010[/tpl] until eclipsed by Bristol in the 18th century.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18640 |title=Bridgwater |accessdate=20 January 2008 |format= |work=British History Online [/tpl] In its heyday, imports included wine, grain, fish, hemp, coal and timber. Exports included wheat, wool, cloth, cement, bricks and tiles. Unlike Bristol, Bridgwater was never involved in the slave trade and, in 1797, was the first town in Britain to petition the government to ban it.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/somerset/content/articles/2007/02/19/abolition_somerset_and_slavery_feature.shtml |title=Somerset and slavery |accessdate=20 January 2008 |work=BBC Somerset [/tpl]

In the 19th century, Bridgwater was also home to a number of iron foundries. George Hennet's Bridgwater Iron Works worked on bridges, railways and machinery for Brunel and Robert Stephenson. This location allowed the import by boat of raw materials from Wales and the dispatch of finished work to south Devon using the Bristol and Exeter Railway. The carriage workshops for the latter were on an adjacent site. The works passed to his son and then traded as Hennet, Spink & Else. Some of the ironwork was produced for the Royal Albert Bridge at Saltash, Cornwall. In 1873 it became the Bridgwater Engineering Company Limited but this failed in 1878.[tpl]cite web|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=28022|title=Nineteenth-century iron works site, Colley Lane, Bridgwater|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=14 March 2010[/tpl] W&F Wills Ltd produced steam locomotives and fingerposts.[tpl]cite web|title=W. and F.

Bridgwater is now a major centre of industry in Somerset, with industries including the production of plastics, engine parts, industrial chemicals, and foods. Bowerings Animal Feed Mill is now the only industry still located at the docks. Being close to the M5 motorway and half way between Bristol and Exeter, Bridgwater is also home to two major distribution centres, while retailer Argos has a regional distribution centre based at Huntworth.

==Landmarks==

Bridgwater is home to the Somerset Brick and Tile Museum, built on part of the former Barham Brothers site (brick and tile manufacturers between 1857 and 1965). Castle House was built in 1851 and was one of the first to make extensive use of concrete demonstrating "an innovative interpretation of traditional masonry features in concrete".
A house in Blake Street, largely restored, is believed to be the birthplace of Robert Blake in 1598, and is now the Blake Museum. It was built in the late 15th or early 16th century, and has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building.[tpl]cite web | title=The Admiral Blake Museum | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=373830 | accessdate=30 July 2007[/tpl] His statue from 1898 by D W Pomeroy has been repositioned from the front of the Corn Exchange to face down Cornhill.[tpl]cite web | title=Blake Statue | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=373861 | accessdate=30 July 2007[/tpl] Sydenham Manor House was previously a manor estate built in the early 16th century, which was refronted and rebuilt after 1613.[tpl]cite web | title=Sydenham Manor House | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=373819 | accessdate=13 October 2007[/tpl] It now stands in the grounds of the former British Cellophane plant.

==Transport==

As trade expanded during the Industrial Revolution, Bridgwater was linked to Taunton by the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal (1827), although initially it ran from a basin south of Bridgwater at Huntworth. As trade grew docks were built in the town, linked to an extension of the canal, with both opening in 1841. The docks were dredged by a scraper-dredger Bertha similar to the one Brunel had designed for the Bristol Floating Harbour. 14 June 1841 saw the opening of the Bristol and Exeter Railway from Bristol to Bridgwater. The railway also opened a coach and wagon works in the town; the last of the buildings is currently in 2005 scheduled for demolition. Bridgwater railway station, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel is now a Grade II listed building.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=374012|title=Bridgwater Railway Station|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=13 March 2010[/tpl] An end to the unequal competition between rail and canal came in 1867 when the Bristol and Exeter Railway purchased the canal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=43826|title=Bridgwater and Taunton Canal|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=11 October 2008[/tpl] A number of local branches were also built, for example to serve the Northgate Brewery (now replaced by a car park north of Angel Crescent) and the former British Cellophane factory. The Somerset and Dorset branch line to Edington was opened in 1890.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sdjr.net/locations/edington.html|title=Edington Junction|publisher=Somerset and Dorset Railway|accessdate=13 March 2010[/tpl] Its former Bridgwater station is now occupied by J Sainsbury.
The importance of shipping and the docks started to decline after 1886, the year in which the opening of the Severn Tunnel caused a severe drop in coal imports by sea. The situation worsened as the railways were extended into Somerset and beyond, and ships became too big for the port. The last commercial use of the docks was when coal imports ceased on 31 July 1971, and although they now house a marina they are currently little used. The surrounding quays have been developed for housing, although the remains of wooden quays on the riverbank can still be seen. All but a small remnant of the mump (a huge mound of spoil from the original dock excavations) was removed in the 1980s to make way for the development on the north side of the dock. Due to the port, ship building was also an important industry, and around 140 ships were built in the town during the 19th century by companies including David Williams, Joseph Gough, Watsons and William Lowther. F J Carver and Son owned a small dry dock on East Quay and constructed the last ship to be built in the town — the Irene.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ireness.com/history.htm|title=History|publisher=Ireness.com|accessdate=13 March 2010[/tpl] The former associated industry of rope making is commemorated in street furnishings and paving on East Quay and in the name of Ropewalk street.
The Drove Bridge, which marks the current extent of the Port of Bridgwater is the nearest to the mouth and the newest road bridge to cross the river. With a span of [tpl]convert|184|ft|m[/tpl], the bridge was constructed as part of the Bridgwater Northern Distributor road scheme (1992), and provides a navigable channel which is [tpl]convert|66|ft|m[/tpl] wide with [tpl]convert|8.2|ft|m[/tpl] headroom at normal spring high tides.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1995/Uksi_19950270_en_3.htm#end|title=Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 270, NDR confirmation order|publisher=Office of Public Sector Information|accessdate=22 December 2009[/tpl] Upstream of this is the retractable bridge built in 1871 to the design of Sir Francis Fox, the engineer for the Bristol and Exeter Railway. It carried a railway siding over the river to the docks, but had to be movable, to allow boats to proceed upriver. An [tpl]convert|80|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] section of railway track to the east of the bridge could be moved sideways, so that the main [tpl]convert|127|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] girders could be retracted, creating a navigable channel which was [tpl]convert|78|ft|m[/tpl] wide.[tpl]cite book|last=Otter|first=R. A.|title=Civil Engineering Heritage: Southern England|publisher=Thomas Telford|year=1994 |isbn=0-7277-1971-8[/tpl] It was manually operated for the first eight months, and then powered by a steam engine, reverting to manual operation in 1913, when the steam engine failed. The bridge was last opened in 1953, and the traverser section was demolished in 1974, but public outcry at the action resulted in the bridge being listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and the rest of the bridge was kept.[tpl]cite web|url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=11837|title=Rail bridge over River Parrett, Bridgwater|work=Somerset Historic Environment Record|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=21 December 2009[/tpl] It was later used as a road crossing, until the construction of the Chandos road bridge alongside it, and is now only used by pedestrians. Parts of the steam engine were moved to Westonzoyland Pumping Station Museum in 1977.
The next bridge is the Town Bridge. There has been a bridge here since the 13th century, when Bridgwater was granted a charter by King John. The present bridge was designed by R. C. Else and G. B. Laffan, and the [tpl]convert|75|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] cast iron structure was completed in 1883.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=374010|title=Town Bridge|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=21 December 2009[/tpl] It replaced an earlier bridge, which was the first cast iron bridge to be built in Somerset when it was completed in 1797. The stone abutments of that bridge were reused by the later bridge, which formed the only road crossing of the river in Bridgwater until 1958. Above the bridge there were two shoals, called The Coals and The Stones, which were a hazard to barge traffic on the river, and bargees had to choose carefully when to navigate the river, to ensure that there was sufficient water to carry them over these obstructions.[tpl]cite book|last=Haskell|first=Tony|title=By Waterway to Taunton: The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal|location=Stroud |publisher=Tempus Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7524-4267-9 | page=108[/tpl] In March 1958 a new reinforced concrete road bridge, the Blake Bridge, was opened as part of a bypass to take traffic away from the centre of Bridgwater.[tpl]cite book |last=Fitzhugh |first=Rod |year=1993 |title=Bridgwater and the River Parrett: in old photographs |location=Stroud |publisher=Alan Sutton Publishing |isbn= 0-7509-0518-2 |page=93[/tpl] It now carries the A38 and A39 roads. On the southern edge of Bridgwater there is a bridge which carries the Bristol and Exeter Railway across the River Parrett. Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed a brick bridge, known as the Somerset Bridge, with a [tpl]convert|100|ft|m[/tpl] span but a rise of just [tpl]convert|12|ft|m|1[/tpl]. Work started in 1838 and was completed in 1841. Brunel left the scaffold supporting the centre of the bridge in place as the foundations were still settling but was forced to remove it in 1843 to reopen the river for navigation. Brunel demolished the brick arch and had replaced it with a timber arch within six months without interrupting the traffic on the railway. This was in turn replaced in 1904 by a steel girder bridge.[tpl]cite book|last=MacDermot |first=E.T. |title=History of the Great Western Railway, vol.
