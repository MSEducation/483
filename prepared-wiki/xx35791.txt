[[Motor vehicle]]

CATEGORIES: Vehicles

A motor vehicle or road vehicle is a self-propelled wheeled vehicle that does not operate on rails, such as trains or trolleys. The vehicle propulsion is provided by an engine or motor, usually by an internal combustion engine, or an electric motor, or some combination of the two, such as hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. For legal purposes motor vehicles are often identified within a number of vehicle classes including automobiles or cars, buses, motorcycles, off highway vehicles, light trucks or light duty trucks, and trucks or lorries. These classifications vary according to the legal codes of each country.  ISO 3833:1977 is the standard for road vehicles types, terms and definitions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=9389|title=ISO 3833:1977|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|accessdate=2011-08-22[/tpl]
As of 2010 there were more than one billion motor vehicles in use in the world excluding off-road vehicles and heavy construction equipment. Global vehicle ownership per capita in 2010 was 148 vehicles in operation per 1000 people. The United States has the largest fleet of motor vehicles in the world, with 239.8 million in 2010. Vehicle ownership per capita in the U.S. is also the highest in the world with 769 vehicles in operation per 1000 people. The People's Republic of China has the second largest fleet in the world, with slightly more than 78 million vehicles and since 2009 became the world's largest new car market. In 2011, a total of 80 million cars and commercial vehicles were built, led by China, with 18.4 million motor vehicles manufactured.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1074667_80-million-vehicles-built-globally-last-year--a-new-record|title=80 Million Vehicles Built Globally Last Year - A New Record |author=John Voelcker|publisher=Green Car Reports|date=2012-03-29|accessdate=2012-03-29[/tpl]

==Ownership trends==

The U.S. publisher Ward's, estimate that as of 2010 there were 1.015 billion motor vehicles in use in the world. This figure represents the number of cars; light, medium and heavy duty trucks; and buses, but does not include off-road vehicles or heavy construction equipment. The world vehicle population passed the 500 million-unit mark in 1986, from 250 million motor vehicles in 1970. Between 1970 and 1980, the vehicle population doubled roughly every 10 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.plunkettresearch.com/Industries/AutomobilesTrucks/AutomobileTrends/tabid/89/Default.aspx|title=Automobiles and Truck Trends|publisher=Plunkett Research|accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://wardsauto.com/ar/world_vehicle_population_110815/|title=World Vehicle Population Tops 1 Billion Units|author=John Sousanis|work=Ward AutoWorld|date=2011-08-15|accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl]  Two U.S. researchers estimate that the world's fleet will reach 2 billion motor vehicles by 2020, with cars representing at least 50% of all vehicles. China’s and India’s automobile fleets are expected to grow at an annual rate of around 7 or 8%, while the slowest growth is expected in the United States, with less than 1% a year, and Western Europe, with 1 to 2%.[tpl]Cite book|last = Sperling, Daniel and Deborah Gordon |title = Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability |year =2009|pages=4 and 13|publisher =Oxford University Press, New York| isbn=978-0-19-537664-7[/tpl] See Chapter 1, Note 1, pp. 261: the authors use the term cars here to represent all conventional motor vehicles, be they cars, sport utility vehicles, minivans, trucks, buses, motorcycles, scooters, or three-wheeled motorized vehicles."
Global vehicle ownership in 2010 was 148 vehicles in operation per 1000 inhabitants, a ratio of 1:6.75 vehicles to people, slightly down from 150 vehicles per 1000 inhabitants in 2009, a rate of 1:6.63 vehicles to people. In developing countries vehicle ownership rates rarely exceed 200 cars per 1,000 population.[tpl]cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTTRANSPORT/EXTURBANTRANSPORT/0,,contentMDK:20249477~menuPK:610224~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:341449,00.html|title=Motorization, Demand & City Development|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=2011-08-21[/tpl]
The following table summarizes the evolution of vehicle registrations in the world from 1960 to 2010:

===European Union===

The 27 European Union (EU-27) member countries had a fleet of over 256 million in 2008, and passenger cars accounted for 87% of the union's fleet. The five largest markets, Germany (17.7%), Italy (15.4%), France (13.3%), the UK (12.5%), and Spain (9.5%), accounted for 68% of the region's total registered fleet in 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.acea.be/news/news_detail/vehicles_in_use/|title=Vehicles in Use|publisher=European Automobile Manufacturers Association|accessdate=2011-08-23[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20100520_2010_KEY_FIGURES_4_Vehicles_in_Use.pdf |title=Car fleet by country 2008|publisher=European Automobile Manufacturers Association|date=2011-08-15|accessdate=2011-08-23[/tpl] The EU-27 member countries had in 2009 an estimated ownership rate of 473 passenger cars per 1000 people.[tpl]cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&init=1&plugin=1&language=en&pcode=tsdpc340|title=Motorisation rate|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=2011-08-22[/tpl] Eurostat defines this indicator "as the number of passenger cars per 1 000 inhabitants. A passenger car is a road motor vehicle, other than a motorcycle, intended for the carriage of passengers and designed to seat no more than nine persons (including the driver); the term "passenger car" therefore covers microcars (need no permit to be driven), taxis and hired passenger cars, provided that they have fewer than 10 seats; this category may also include pick-ups."
According to Ward's, Italy had the second highest (after the U.S.) vehicle ownership per capita in 2010, with 690 vehicles per 1000 people. Germany had a rate of motorization of 534 vehicles per 1000 people and the UK of 525 vehicles per 1000 inhabitants, both in 2008. France had a rate of 575 vehicles per 1000 people and Spain 608 vehicles per 1000 people in 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-DK-10-001/EN/KS-DK-10-001-EN.PDF|title=Energy, transport and environment indicators - eurostat Pocketbooks |publisher=Eurostat|date=2010 edition|accessdate=2011-08-23[/tpl] ''See table 2.1.1 (pp. 92) and table 2.1.4 (pp.98) The rates were obtained adding the light vehicle motorization rates with the heavy vehicle rates  Portugal, between 1991 and 2002 grew up 220% on its motorization rate, having had in 2002, 560 cars per inhabitant.[tpl]cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&plugin=1&language=en&pcode=tsdpc340|title=Motorization rate|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=2013-08-07[/tpl] Italy also leds in alternative fuel vehicles, with a fleet of 779,090 natural gas vehicles [tpl]as of|2012|06|lc=y[/tpl], the largest NGV fleet in Europe.

According to Ward's, the United States has the largest fleet of motor vehicles in the world, with 239.8 million by 2010. Vehicle ownership per capita in the U.S. is also the highest in the world with 769 vehicles in operation per 1000 inhabitants, or a ratio of 1:1.3 vehicles to people. The U.S. Department of Energy reports an even higher motorization rate of 828 vehicles per 1000 people, and a total of 245,441,000 vehicles by 2009.
