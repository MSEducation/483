[[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]]

CATEGORIES: Academy Awards, Awards established in 1938

The Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award is awarded periodically at the Governors Awards ceremonies to "Creative producers, whose bodies of work reflect a consistently high quality of motion picture production." The award is named for Irving Thalberg, legendary head of the Production Division of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who developed the company's reputation for sophisticated films. The trophy for award recipients is in the form of a bust of Thalberg rather than the familiar "Oscar" statuette.  However, it is still counted as an "honorary Oscar". There have been 39 statuettes awarded to date.
