[[Letterboxing (hobby)]]

CATEGORIES: Dartmoor, Hobbies, Internet object tracking, Outdoor locating games, Geocaching

Letterboxing is an outdoor hobby that combines elements of orienteering, art, and puzzle solving. Letterboxers hide small, weatherproof boxes in publicly accessible places (like parks) and distribute clues to finding the box in printed catalogs, on one of several web sites, or by word of mouth. Individual letterboxes contain a notebook and a rubber stamp, preferably hand carved or custom made.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.atlasquest.com/about/wiki/browse.html?gCatId=3#q19 |title=Is it OK to use a store-bought stamp? |author=Atlas Quest[/tpl] Finders make an imprint of the letterbox's stamp in their personal notebook, and leave an impression of their personal signature stamp on the letterbox's "visitors' book" or "logbook" — as proof of having found the box and letting other letterboxers know who has visited.  Many letterboxers keep careful track of their "find count".

==History==

The origin of letterboxing can be traced to Dartmoor, Devon, England in 1854. William Crossing in his Guide to Dartmoor states that a well known Dartmoor guide (James Perrott[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.devonperspectives.co.uk/james_perrott.html |title= James Perrott[/tpl]) placed a bottle for visiting cards at Cranmere Pool[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101040726-665043,00.html |title=Hide-and-Seek for Grownups |publisher=Time |date=2002-06-14 |accessdate=2010-12-22[/tpl] on the northern moor in 1854.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,55367,00.html |title=Letterboxing Makes Hiking an Adventure |author=Catherine Donaldson-Evans |publisher=Fox News |date=2004-07-18 |accessdate=2010-12-22[/tpl] From this hikers on the moors began to leave a letter or postcard inside a box along the trail (sometimes addressed to themselves, sometimes a friend or relative)—hence the name "letterboxing". The next person to discover the site would collect the postcards and post them. In 1938 a plaque and letterbox in Crossing's memory were placed at Duck's Pool on southern Dartmoor.http://www.dartmoorletterboxing.org/history%20of%20Letterboxing.htmhttp://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080727202141/www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/lab-historydartmoorhttp://www.atlasquest.com/about/history/
The first Dartmoor letterboxes were so remote and well-hidden that only the most determined walkers would find them, allowing weeks to pass before the letter made its way home. Until the 1970s there were no more than a dozen such sites around the moor, usually in the most inaccessible locations. Increasingly, however, letterboxes have been located in relatively accessible sites and today there are thousands of letterboxes, many within easy walking distance of the road. As a result, the tradition of leaving a letter or postcard in the box has been forgotten.
Today there is a club called the "100 Club", membership of which is open to anyone who has found at least 100 letterboxes on Dartmoor. Clues to the locations of letterboxes are published by the "100 Club" in an annual catalogue. Some letterboxes however remain "word of mouth" and the clues to their location can only be obtained from the person who placed the box. Some clues may also be found in other letterboxes or on the Internet, but this is more commonly for letterboxes in places other than Dartmoor, where no "100 Club" or catalogue exist.http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080727204735/www.dartmoor-npa.gov.uk/vi-letterboxing
Letterboxing has become a popular sport, with thousands of walkers gathering for 'box-hunts' and while in some areas of Dartmoor it is particularly popular amongst children, some of the more difficult to find boxes and tougher terrain are better suited to more experienced adults.
Letterboxes can now be found in other areas of the United Kingdom including the North York Moors and have spread all over the world. The Scottish artist Alec Finlay[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alecfinlay.com/letterbox.html|title=Alec Finlay, World Wide Letterboxing[/tpl] has placed letterboxes with rubber stamp circle poems at locations around the world, including Yorkshire Sculpture Park.
Interest in letterboxing in the U.S. is generally considered to have started with a feature article in the Smithsonian MagazineSmithsonian Magazine in April 1998. Much of the terminology below is associated with letterboxing in the US and would be unfamiliar to UK letterboxers. The growing popularity of the somewhat similar activity of geocaching during the 2000s has increased interest in letterboxing as well.
Clues to American letterboxes are commonly published on several different websites.

==Gatherings==

Letterboxers organize events, usually called meets or gatherings. The first letterbox meet was held on Dartmoor, and they are now  held twice yearly on "clock change days" (in March and October). Gatherings in the US are usually at parks or places with enough space for a large group of letterboxers to meet up and do exchanges (exchanging of personal stamps and/or personal travelers), as well as talk and discuss box ideas. Gatherings in the US usually have a special, one day "Event stamp." At some gatherings, boxes are created or donated to be planted nearby specifically for the gathering attendees to find.
The first gathering in North America was held in November, 1999, at The Inn at Long Trail in Killington, Vermont.

==Types==

There are now many different kinds of letterboxes, each with some specific distinction. While purists recognize only those letterboxes planted in the wild, many new variations exist. These include:
In the US, letterboxes have developed new forms:

==Find counts==

A letterboxer's find count or PFX count is organized as follows:
Some boxers list individual types of boxes in their PFX counts (e.g.: P12 F76 X45 E4 HH21 V4 would mean 12 plants, 76 finds, 45 exchanges, four events or event stamps, 21 hitchhikers, and four virtuals).  Some include virtuals, hitchhikers, and other non-traditional boxes in a single find count, while some exclude them.  Many letterboxers do not bother to keep count at all.
The "PFX count" is not a term associated with Dartmoor Letterboxing.
