==Etymology==

The city received its modern name in 1919. Beforehand it was mostly known in English by its German name, Pressburg, as it was long dominated by Austrians and German speakers. This is the term which the German, the pre-1919 Slovak (Prešporok) and Czech (Prešpurk) names are derived from. The origin of the city's Hungarian name, Pozsony, is unclear: it might come from the Hungarian Poson (name of the city's first castellan), the Czech Pos or the German Poscho, which are personal names. Hungarian speakers still use the Hungarian name, Pozsony.
The medieval settlement Brezalauspurc (literally: Braslav's castle) is sometimes attributed to Bratislava, however the actual location of Brezalauspurc is under scholarly debate. The city's modern name is credited to Pavel Jozef Šafárik's misinterpretation of Braslav as Bratislav when analyzing medieval sources, thus coming up with the term Břetislaw, later Bratislav.
During the revolution of 1918–1919, the name 'Wilsonov' or 'Wilsonstadt' (after President Woodrow Wilson) was proposed by American Slovaks, as he supported national self-determination. The name Bratislava, which was used before only by some Slovak patriots, became official in March 1919.Pieter C. van Duin. Central European Crossroads: Social Democracy and National Revolution in Bratislava (Pressburg), 1867–1921
Other alternative names of the city in the past: Greek: Ιστρόπολις Istropolis (meaning "Danube City", also used in Latin), [tpl]lang-cs|Prešpurk[/tpl], [tpl]lang-fr|Presbourg[/tpl], [tpl]lang-it|Presburgo[/tpl], [tpl]lang-la|Posonium[/tpl], [tpl]lang-hr|Požun[/tpl], [tpl]lang-ro|Pojon[/tpl], [tpl]lang-sr|Požun/ Пожун[/tpl]. The name Pressburg was also used in English-language publications until 1919, and it is occasionally used today. In older documents, confusion can be caused by the Latin forms Bratislavia, Wratislavia etc., which refer to Wrocław (Breslau), Poland – not to Bratislava.Graesse, Orbis latinus, Columbia University

==History==

The first known permanent settlement of the area began with the Linear Pottery Culture, around 5000 BC in the Neolithic era. About 200 BC, the Celtic Boii tribe founded the first significant settlement, a fortified town known as an oppidum. They also established a mint, producing silver coins known as biatecs.[tpl]cite web |publisher=City of Bratislava |url=http://www.visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1005&p1=1569 |title=History – Celtic settlements |accessdate=May 15, 2007 |year=2005[/tpl]
The area fell under Roman influence from the 1st to the 4th century AD and was made part of the Limes Romanus, a border defence system.Kováč et al., "Kronika Slovenska 1", p. 73 The Romans introduced grape growing to the area and began a tradition of winemaking, which survives to the present.[tpl]cite web |publisher=City of Bratislava |url=http://www.visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1006&p1=1570 |title=History – Bratislava and the Romans |accessdate=May 15, 2007 |year=2005[/tpl]
The Slavs arrived from the East between the 5th and 6th centuries during the Migration Period.Kováč et al., Kronika Slovenska 1, p. 90 As a response to onslaughts by Avars, the local Slavic tribes rebelled and established Samo's Empire (623–658), the first known Slavic political entity. In the 9th century, the castles at Bratislava (Brezalauspurc) and Devín (Dowina) were important centres of the Slavic states: the Principality of Nitra and Great Moravia.Kováč et al., Kronika Slovenska 1, p. 95 Scholars have debated the identification as fortresses of the two castles built in Great Moravia, based on linguistic arguments and because of the absence of convincing archaeological evidence.[tpl]cite book |last=Kristó |first=Gyula (editor)|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Korai Magyar Történeti Lexikon – 9–14. század (Encyclopedia of the Early Hungarian History – 9–14th centuries)|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó |year=1994 |location=Budapest |pages=128, 167|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=963-05-6722-9[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uni-bonn.de/~ntrunte/publikationen8.html#dowina_inhalt |title=Meine wissenschaftlichen Publikationen (Fortsetzung, 2002–2004) |publisher=Uni-bonn.de |date=October 31, 2006 |accessdate=2009-05-28[/tpl]
The first written reference to a settlement named "Brezalauspurc" dates to 907 and is related to a battle, during which a Bavarian army was defeated by the Hungarians. It is connected to the fall of Great Moravia, already weakened by its own inner decline[tpl]cite book|last=Toma|first=Peter A.|title=Slovakia: from Samo to Dzurinda Studies of nationalities|year=2001|publisher=Hoover Institution Press|isbn=978-0-8179-9951-3[/tpl] and under the attacks of the Hungarians.Špiesz, "Bratislava v stredoveku", p. 9 The exact location of the battle remains unknown, and some interpretations place it west of Lake Balaton.[tpl]cite book|last=Bowlus|first=Charles R.|title=The battle of Lechfeld and its aftermath |year=2006|page=83[/tpl]
In the 10th century, the territory of Pressburg (what would later become Pozsony county) became part of Hungary (called "the Kingdom of Hungary" from 1000). It developed as a key economic and administrative centre on the kingdom's frontier.[tpl]cite web |publisher=City of Bratislava |url=http://www.visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1008&p1=1572 |title=History – Bratislava in the Middle Ages |year=2005 |accessdate=May 15, 2007[/tpl] This strategic position destined the city to be the site of frequent attacks and battles, but also brought it economic development and high political status. It was granted its first known "town privileges" in 1291 by the Hungarian King Andrew III,Špiesz, "Bratislava v stredoveku", p. 43 and was declared a free royal town in 1405 by King Sigismund. In 1436 he authorized the town to use its own coat of arms.Špiesz, "Bratislava v stredoveku", p. 132
The Kingdom of Hungary was defeated by the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Mohács in 1526. The Turks besieged and damaged Pressburg, but failed to conquer it.Lacika, "Bratislava", p. 30 Owing to Ottoman advances into Hungarian territory, the city was designated the new capital of Hungary in 1536, becoming part of the Austrian Habsburg monarchy and marking the beginning of a new era. The city became a coronation town and the seat of kings, archbishops (1543), the nobility and all major organisations and offices. Between 1536 and 1830, eleven Hungarian kings and queens were crowned at St. Martin's Cathedral.Lacika, "Bratislava", p. 62 The 17th century was marked by anti-Habsburg uprisings, fighting with the Turks, floods, plagues and other disasters, which diminished the population.Lacika, "Bratislava", pp. 31–34
Pressburg flourished during the 18th-century reign of Queen Maria Theresa,[tpl]cite web|last=Weinberger|first=Jill Knight|title=Rediscovering Old Bratislava|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E5D91138F93AA25752C1A9669C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2|work=The New York Times|date=November 19, 2000|accessdate=2008-07-27[/tpl] becoming the largest and most important town in Hungary.Lacika, "Bratislava", pp. 34–36 The population tripled; many new palaces, monasteries, mansions, and streets were built, and the city was the centre of social and cultural life of the region.Lacika, "Bratislava", pp. 35–36 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart gave a concert in 1762 in the Pálffy Palace in Bratislava. Joseph Haydn performed in 1784 in the Grassalkovich Palace in Bratislava. Ludwig van Beethoven was a guest in 1796 in the Keglević Palace in Bratislava.Slowakei, p.68, Renata SakoHoess, DuMont Reiseverlag, 2004.

The city started to lose its importance under the reign of Maria Theresa's son Joseph II, especially after the crown jewels were taken to Vienna in 1783 in an attempt to strengthen the union between Austria and Hungary. Many central offices subsequently moved to Buda, followed by a large segment of the nobility.[tpl]cite web |publisher=City of Bratislava |url=http://www.visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1010&p1=1574 |title=History – Maria Theresa’s City |year=2005 |accessdate=May 15, 2007[/tpl] The first newspapers in Hungarian and Slovak were published here: Magyar hírmondó in 1780, and Presspurske Nowiny in 1783.Kováč et al., "Kronika Slovenska 1", pp. 350–351 In the course of the 18th century, the city became a centre for the Slovak national movement.
The city's 19th-century history was closely tied to the major events in Europe. The Peace of Pressburg between Austria and France was signed here in 1805.Kováč et al., "Kronika Slovenska 1", p. 384 Theben Castle was ruined by Napoleon's French troops during an invasion of 1809.Kováč et al., "Kronika Slovenska 1", p. 385 In 1825 the Hungarian National Learned Society (the present Hungarian Academy of Sciences) was founded in Pressburg using a donation from István Széchenyi. In 1843 Hungarian was proclaimed the official language in legislation, public administration and education by the Diet in the city.Erzsébet Varga, "Pozsony", p. 14 (Hungarian)
As a reaction to the Revolutions of 1848, Ferdinand V signed the so-called April laws, which included the abolition of serfdom, at the Primate's Palace.[tpl]cite web |publisher=City of Bratislava |url=http://www.visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1011&p1=1575 |title=History – Between the campaigns of the Napoleonic troops and the abolition of bondage |year=2005 |accessdate=May 15, 2007[/tpl] Kováč et al., "Kronika Slovenska 1", p. 444 The city chose the revolutionary Hungarian side, but was captured by the Austrians in December 1848.Kováč et al., "Kronika Slovenska 1", p. 457
Industry developed rapidly in the 19th century. The first horse-drawn railway in the Kingdom of Hungary,[tpl]cite web |publisher=Železničná spoločnosť Cargo Slovakia |url=http://www.zscargo.sk/en/company-profile/history/ |title=History – Austro-Hungarian Empire |date=no date |accessdate=May 28, 2008[/tpl] from Pressburg to Szentgyörgy Svätý Jur, was built in 1840.Kováč et al., "Kronika Slovenska 1", pp. 426–427 A new line to Vienna using steam locomotives was opened in 1848, and a line to Pest in 1850.Kováč et al., "Kronika Slovenska 1", p. 451 Many new industrial, financial and other institutions were founded; for example, the first bank in present-day Slovakia was founded in 1842.Kováč et al., "Kronika Slovenska 1", p. 430 The city's first permanent bridge over the Danube, Starý most, was built in 1891.Lacika, "Bratislava", p. 41
Before World War I, the city had a population that was 42% ethnic German, 41% Hungarian and 15% Slovak (1910 census). After World War I and the formation of Czechoslovakia on October 28, 1918, the city was incorporated into the new state despite its representatives' reluctance.Lacika, "Bratislava", p. 42 The dominant Hungarian and German population tried to prevent annexation of the city to Czechoslovakia and declared it a free city. However, the Czechoslovak Legions occupied the city on January 1, 1919, and made it part of Czechoslovakia. The city became the seat of Slovakia's political organs and organizations and became Slovakia's capital on 4 February.[tpl]cite book|author=Tibenský, Ján et al.|title=Slovensko: Dejiny|publisher=Obzor|year=1971|location=Bratislava[/tpl] On February 12, 1919 the German and Hungarian population started a protest against the Czechoslovak occupation, but the Czechoslovak Legions opened fire on the unarmed demonstrators.Marcel Jankovics, "Húsz esztendő Pozsonyban", p. 65-67 (Hungarian)
On March 27, 1919, the name Bratislava was officially adopted for the first time.[tpl]cite web |publisher=City of Bratislava|url=http://www.visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1012&p1=1576 |title=History – First Czechoslovak Republic |year=2005 |accessdate=May 15, 2007[/tpl] Left without any protection after the retreat of the Hungarian army, many Hungarians were expelled or fled.[tpl]cite web |publisher=|url=http://www.tankonyv.sk/detail.php?chron=1&theme=4 |title=History of Hungarians in the first Czechoslovak Republic (1918–1919 section) |year=2008 |accessdate=September 5, 2008[/tpl] Czechs and Slovaks moved their households to Bratislava.

In 1938, Nazi Germany annexed neighbouring Austria in the Anschluss; later that year it also annexed the still-separate from Bratislava Petržalka and Devín boroughs on ethnic grounds, as these had many ethnic Germans.Kováč et al., "Bratislava 1939–1945", pp. 16–17 Bratislava was declared the capital of the first independent Slovak Republic on March 14, 1939, but the new state quickly fell under Nazi influence. In 1941–1942 and 1944–1945, the new Slovak government cooperated in deporting most of Bratislava's approximately 15,000 Jews;Lacika, "Bratislava", p. 43. Kováč et al., "Bratislava 1939–1945, pp. 174–177 they were transported to concentration camps, where most were killed or died before the end of the war.
Bratislava was bombarded by the Allies, occupied by German troops in 1944, and eventually taken by the Soviet Red Army on April 4, 1945.[tpl]cite web |publisher=City of Bratislava |url=http://www.visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1014&p1=1578 |title=History – Wartime Bratislava |year=2005 |accessdate=May 15, 2007[/tpl]Kováč et al., "Kronika Slovenska 2", p. 300 At the end of World War II, most of Bratislavas ethnic Germans were helped to evacuate by German authorities. A few returned after the war, but were soon expelled without their properties under the Beneš decrees,Kováč et al., "Kronika Slovenska 2", pp. 307–308 part of a widespread expulsion of ethnic Germans from eastern Europe.
After the Communist Party seized power in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, the city became part of the Eastern Bloc. The city annexed new land, and the population rose significantly, becoming 90% Slovak. Large residential areas consisting of high-rise prefabricated panel buildings, such as those in the Petržalka borough, were built. The Communist government also built several new grandiose buildings, such as the Most Slovenského národného povstania bridge and the Slovak Radio headquarters.
In 1968, after the unsuccessful Czechoslovak attempt to liberalise the Communist regime, the city was occupied by Warsaw Pact troops. Shortly thereafter, it became capital of the Slovak Socialist Republic, one of the two states of the federalized Czechoslovakia.
Bratislava's dissidents anticipated the fall of Communism with the Bratislava candle demonstration in 1988, and the city became one of the foremost centres of the anti-Communist Velvet Revolution in 1989.Kováč et al., "Kronika Slovenska 2" p. 498
In 1993, the city became the capital of the newly formed Slovak Republic following the Velvet Divorce.[tpl]cite web |publisher=City of Bratislava |url=http://www.visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1016&p1=1580 |title=History – Capital city for second time |year=2005 |accessdate=May 15, 2007[/tpl] In the 1990s and the early 21st century, its economy boomed due to foreign investment.

The river passes through the city from the west to the south-east. The Middle Danube basin begins at Devín Gate in western Bratislava. Other rivers are the Morava River, which forms the north-western border of the city and enters the Danube at Devín, the Little Danube, and the Vydrica, which enters the Danube in the borough of Karlova Ves.
The Carpathian mountain range begins in city territory with the Little Carpathians (Malé Karpaty). The Záhorie and Danubian lowlands stretch into Bratislava. The city's lowest point is at the Danube's surface at [tpl]convert|126|m[/tpl] above mean sea level, and the highest point is Devínska Kobyla at [tpl]convert|514|m[/tpl].

===Bratislava Castle===

One of the most prominent structures in the city is Bratislava Castle, situated on a plateau [tpl]convert|85|m|ft|0[/tpl] above the Danube. The castle hill site has been inhabited since the transitional period between the Stone and Bronze agesLacika, "Bratislava", pp. 11–12 and has been the acropolis of a Celtic town, part of the Roman Limes Romanus, a huge Slavic fortified settlement, and a political, military and religious centre for Great Moravia.Lacika, "Bratislava", p. 121 A stone castle was not constructed until the 10th century, when the area was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The castle was converted into a Gothic anti-Hussite fortress under Sigismund of Luxemburg in 1430, became a Renaissance castle in 1562,Lacika, "Bratislava", p. 124 and was rebuilt in 1649 in the baroque style. Under Queen Maria Theresa, the castle became a prestigious royal seat. In 1811, the castle was inadvertently destroyed by fire and lay in ruins until the 1950s,Lacika, "Bratislava", p. 128 when it was rebuilt mostly in its former Theresian style.

===Devín Castle===

The ruined and recently renovatedDevín Castle is in the borough of Devín, on top of a rock where the Morava River, which forms the border between Austria and Slovakia, enters the Danube. It is one of the most important Slovak archaeological sites and contains a museum dedicated to its history.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Bratislava City Museum |url=http://www.muzeum.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700016&id=1025&p1=52 |title=Bratislava City Museum: Museums: Devín Castle – National Cultural Monument |author=Beáta Husová |year=2007 |accessdate=June 21, 2007[/tpl] Due to its strategic location, Devín Castle was a very important frontier castle of Great Moravia and the early Hungarian state. It was destroyed by Napoleon's troops in 1809. It is an important symbol of Slovak and Slavic history.Lacika, "Bratislava", p. 191

===Rusovce===

===Parks and lakes===

Due to its location in the foothills of the Little Carpathians and its riparian vegetation on the Danubian floodplains, Bratislava has forests close to the city centre. The total amount of public green space is [tpl]convert|46.8|km2|sqmi|1[/tpl], or [tpl]convert|110|m2|sqft[/tpl] per inhabitant.[tpl]cite web |publisher=City of Bratislava |url=http://www.visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1039&p1=1816 |title=Natural Environment |year=2007 |accessdate=May 1, 2007[/tpl]

==Demographics==

From the city's origin until the 19th century, Germans were the dominant ethnic group.[tpl]cite journal |author=Peter Salner |title=Ethnic polarisation in an ethnically homogeneous town|journal=Czech Sociological Review |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=235–246 |year=2001 |url=http://sreview.soc.cas.cz/upl/archiv/files/171_235SALNE.pdf |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080227082043/http://sreview.soc.cas.cz/upl/archiv/files/171_235SALNE.pdf |archivedate=February 27, 2008 |format=PDF[/tpl] However, after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, active Magyarisation took place, and by the end of World War I 40% of the population of Pressburg spoke Hungarian as native language, 42% German, and 15% Slovak. After the formation of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918, Bratislava remained a multi-ethnic city, but with a different demographic trend. Due to Slovakization,[ref]Iris Engemann (European University Viadrina, Frankfurt/Oder)

In 1945, most of the Germans were evacuated. After the restoration of Czechoslovakia, the Beneš decrees (partly revoked in 1948) collectively punished ethnic German and Hungarian minorities by expropriation and deportation to Germany, Austria, and Hungary for their alleged collaborationism with Nazi Germany and Hungary against Czechoslovakia.[tpl]cite web |publisher=|url=http://epa.oszk.hu/00000/00033/00020/pdf/szemle_2005_1_vadkerty.pdf |title=Germans and Hungarians in Pozsony |year=2008 |accessdate=June 22, 2008|format=PDF[/tpl][tpl]cite web |publisher=|url=http://www.shp.hu/hpc/web.php?a=commorakozigaz&o=SzMCfBlp4x|title=shp.hu |year=2008 |accessdate=June 22, 2008[/tpl]

The mayor, based at the Primate's Palace, is the city's top executive officer and is elected to a four-year term of office. The current mayor of Bratislava is Milan Ftáčnik, who won the election held on November 28, 2010 as an independent candidate. The city council is the city's legislative body, responsible for issues such as budget, local ordinances, city planning, road maintenance, education, and culture.[tpl]cite web |publisher=theparliament.com |url=http://www.eupolitix.com/EN/Forums/City+of+Bratislava/a1801f57-40bd-4caf-9749-21724bc3a1f5.htm |title=Bratislava – Local Government System |year=2007 |accessdate=April 30, 2007[/tpl] The Council usually convenes once a month and consists of 45 members elected to four-year terms concurrent with the mayor's. Many of the council's executive functions are carried out by the city commission at the council's direction. The city board is a 28-member body composed of the mayor and his deputies, the borough mayors, and up to ten city council members. The board is an executive and supervisory arm of the city council and also serves in an advisory role to the mayor.
Administratively, Bratislava is divided into five districts: Bratislava I (the city centre), Bratislava II (eastern parts), Bratislava III (north-eastern parts), Bratislava IV (western and northern parts) and Bratislava V (southern parts on the right bank of the Danube, including Petržalka, the most densely populated residential area in Central Europe).[tpl]cite web |publisher=City of Bratislava|url=http://visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1074&p1=1852 |title=Petržalka City |date=March 1, 2007 |accessdate=January 29, 2008 |quote=Petržalka City will transform the largest and most densely populated housing estate in Central Europe from a monotone cement-panel housing scheme into a fully-fledged town with autonomous multipurpose centre.[/tpl]
For self-governance purposes, the city is divided into 17 boroughs, each of which has its own mayor (starosta) and council. The number of councillors in each depends on the size and population of the borough.[tpl]cite web |title=Local Government |url=http://visit.bratislava.sk/en/vismo/dokumenty2.asp?id_org=700014&id=1044&p1=1811 |year=2005 |accessdate=April 29, 2007 |publisher=City of Bratislava[/tpl] Each of the boroughs coincides with the city's 20 cadastral areas, except for two cases: Nové Mesto is further divided into the Nové Mesto and Vinohrady cadastral areas and Ružinov is divided into Ružinov, Nivy and Trnávka. Further unofficial division recognizes additional quarters and localities.
