==History==

Pema Chödrön was born Deirdre Blomfield-Brown in 1936 in New York City. She attended Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut, and grew up on a farm in the countryside with an older brother and sister.Haas, Michaela (2013). "Dakini Power: Twelve Extraordinary Women Shaping the Transmission of Tibetan Buddhism in the West". Snow Lion. ISBN 1559394072, p. 123. She graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, and worked as an elementary school teacher in California and New Mexico before her conversion to Buddhism.
Following a second divorce, Chödrön began to study with Lama Chime Rinpoche in the French Alps. She became a Buddhist nun in 1974 while studying with him in London.[tpl]cite book |author=Fabrice Midal |coauthors= |title=Recalling Chögyam Trungpa |year=2005 |publisher=Shambhala Publications |quote= | pages=476 |url= |isbn=1-59030-207-9 [/tpl] She is a fully ordained bhikṣuṇī in a combination of the Mulasarvastivadin and Dharmaguptaka lineages of vinaya, having received full ordination in Hong Kong in 1981 at the behest of the sixteenth Karmapa. She was probably the first American woman to become fully ordained.Haas, Michaela (2013). "Dakini Power: Twelve Extraordinary Women Shaping the Transmission of Tibetan Buddhism in the West". Snow Lion. ISBN 1559394072, p. 128 She has been instrumental in trying to reestablish full ordination for nuns in the Mulasarvastivadin order, to which all Tibetan Buddhist monastics have traditionally belonged; various conferences have been convened to study the matter.
Chödrön first met Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche in 1972 and, at the urging of Chime Rinpoche, took him as her root guru. She studied with him from 1974 until his death in 1987.[tpl]cite book |author=Sandy Boucher |coauthors= |title=Turning the Wheel: American Women Creating the New Buddhism |year=1993 |publisher=Beacon Press |quote= | pages=93–97 | url= |isbn=0-8070-7305-9 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=James William Coleman |coauthors= |title=The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |quote= | pages=150 | url= |isbn=0-19-515241-7 [/tpl] Trungpa's son, Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, appointed Chödrön an acharya (senior teacher) shortly after assuming leadership of his father's Shambhala lineage in 1992.
Trungpa appointed Chödrön director of the Boulder Shambhala Center (then Boulder Dharmadhatu) in Colorado in the early 1980s.Boucher (1993) pp. 96-97 It was during this period that she became ill with chronic fatigue syndrome. Chödrön moved to Gampo Abbey in 1984 and became its director in 1986. There she published her first two books. Her health gradually improved, she claims, with the help of a homeopath and careful attention to diet.
In late 2005, Chödrön published No Time to Lose, a commentary on Shantideva's Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life. She published Practicing Peace in Times of War in 2006.
