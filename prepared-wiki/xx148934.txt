She decided to move to Los Angeles to find work as an actress. She was successful at this, and in 1966, one of her first TV appearances came in an early, first-season episode of Star Trek, "The Conscience of the King". Anderson also starred in the pilot for the TV series Mannix, which was filmed in 1966.
In 1967, Anderson became one of the four original cast members of the TV series Ironside, and the lead actress in this series (for the first 105 episodes). Anderson played the role of one of three police Officers chosen to assist the wheelchair-using former Chief of Detectives for San Francisco, Robert Ironside, who was played by Raymond Burr. Anderson continued in her role as Officer Whitfield for four seasons. In 1968, Anderson won the television Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in Drama Series for her work on the show.
In 1971, Anderson left Ironside, and full-time TV series acting, because she wanted to devote time to her new marriage to the Scottish-born former actor, and stockbroker, Don Burnett. They have no children.

She then accepted a recurring role (seven episodes) in the final season of Mission Impossible. Since then, she has acted in several made-for-TV movies and in guest roles in some regular TV series. However, 
Anderson's last acting appearance on TV or in films was in 1993, in the TV movie Return of Ironside, where she reprised her role as Eve Whitfield, now the mother of a daughter.
