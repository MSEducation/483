==Performances==

On March 5, 1998, Smith made his network television debut[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] on Late Night with Conan O'Brien by performing "Miss Misery" solo on acoustic guitar.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nbc.com/Late_Night_with_Conan_O%27Brien/episode_guide/160.shtml |title=nbc.com > Late Night with Conan O'Brien > Episode Guide |website=NBC |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071013051724/http://www.nbc.com/Late_Night_with_Conan_O%27Brien/episode_guide/160.shtml |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |accessdate=June 30, 2013[/tpl]
On March 23, 1998, Smith played an abridged version of the song at the 70th Academy Awards, accompanied by the house orchestra. Following the "shocking"[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/elliottsmith/articles/story/5926749/white_suit_blue_collar |title=White Suit, Blue Collar: Elliott Smith : Rolling Stone |last=Hellweg |first=Eric |date=March 24, 1998 |website=Rolling Stone |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071001215925/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/elliottsmith/articles/story/5926749/white_suit_blue_collar |archivedate=October 1, 2007 |accessdate=June 30, 2013[/tpl] nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, Smith had to be convinced by the producers to perform the song at the ceremony, as he had not intended to do so. They informed him that his song would be played live that night, whether by him or another musician of their choosing.[tpl]cite web |url=http://undertheradarmag.com/es.html |title=Under the Radar – News – Elliott Smith – Better Off Than Dead, Elliott Smith Comes Clean |last=Kagler |first=Marcus |date=June 2006 |website=Under the Radar |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060408160745/http://undertheradarmag.com/es.html |archivedate=April 8, 2006 |accessdate=June 30, 2013[/tpl] They also purportedly rejected his style of performing while sitting in a chair. Beforehand, he said that "Mainly I just want to go so I can wear my white suit. I always have a great time when I wear my white suit." When Madonna announced "My Heart Will Go On" as the winner, she sarcastically remarked, "What a shocker!" She later said that she had greatly admired Elliott Smith. Afterwards, Smith described the experience as "surreal" and "ridiculous, but at a certain point I threw myself into it because it seemed to make my friends happy... I walked out and Jack Nicholson was sitting about six feet away, so I avoided that area and I looked up at the balcony in the back and sang the song."
In 1998, Smith performed the song on MTV.
Although he would play "Miss Misery" in various shows throughout his career, Smith would often avoid playing it[tpl]cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Jim |date=October 7, 1998 |title=Smith Lets 'Miss Misery' Sit Out His Paradise Set |newspaper=The Boston Globe |quote=Smith did not even play 'Miss Misery'.[/tpl] and talking about it.[tpl]cite news |last=Wilson |first=Scott |date=November 2, 2000 |title=Misery Missing |magazine=The Pitch |url=http://www.pitch.com/2000-11-02/music/misery-missing |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090509105313/http://www.pitch.com/2000-11-02/music/misery-missing |archivedate=May 9, 2009 |accessdate=June 30, 2013[/tpl] It was not heavily requested compared to his other songs,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5928931/elliott_smith |title=Elliott Smith : Rolling Stone |last=Ashare |first=Matt |date=April 16, 1998 |website=Rolling Stone |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930210642/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5928931/elliott_smith |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |accessdate=June 30, 2013[/tpl] and in one show he dedicated it to the audience.[tpl]cite news |last=Chelser |first=Josh |date=March 5, 1999 |title=Concert Review: Elliott Smith Wins Over Los Angeles Crowd |newspaper=University Wire |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-20887686.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110516163949/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-20887686.html |archivedate=May 16, 2011 |accessdate=June 30, 2013 |quote=... when he shyly dedicated "Miss Misery" ... to the audience ... it became obvious how both deserved and unlikely his success has been.[/tpl]
