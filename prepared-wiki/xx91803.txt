Sub-replacement fertility is a total fertility rate (TFR) that (if sustained) leads to each new generation being less populous than the previous one in a given area.  In developed countries sub-replacement fertility is any rate below approximately 2.1 children born per woman, but the threshold can be as high as 3.4 in some developing countries because of higher mortality rates.[tpl]cite journal|title=The surprising global variation in replacement fertility|author=Espenshade TJ, Guzman JC, and Westoff CF|year=2003|journal=Population Research and Policy Review|volume=22|pages=575|doi=10.1023/B:POPU.0000020882.29684.8e|issue=5/6[/tpl], Introduction and Table 1, p. 580 Taken globally, the total fertility rate at replacement was 2.33 children per woman in 2003.  This can be "translated" as 2 children per woman to replace the parents, plus a "third of a child" to make up for the higher probability of boys being born, and early mortality prior to the end of their fertile life.For example in the United Kingdom in 2001 304,635 boys were born as opposed to 289,999 girls, and some of these girls will not survive to the end of their child bearing years. In future, therefore, the girls born in this year would have to have more than two children each to replace the total population.

Replacement level fertility in terms of the net reproduction rate (NRR) is exactly one, because the NRR takes both mortality rates and sex ratios at birth into account.
