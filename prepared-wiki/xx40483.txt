Sir Carol Reed (30 December 1906 – 25 April 1976) was an English film director best known for Odd Man Out (1947), The Fallen Idol (1948) and The Third Man (1949).[tpl]cite news |title=Carol Reed: The Third Man |last=Malcolm |first=Derek |authorlink=Derek Malcolm |date=16 March 2000 |work=The Guardian |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/Century_Of_Films/Story/0,4135,147436,00.html |quote=Carol Reed directed films for 40 years, but his golden period was brief. It covered three years in the late 40s when he made Odd Man Out, The Fallen Idol and The Third Man. These three films alone put him in the forefront of British directors of the period, and the last-named, his second collaboration with Graham Greene, is probably the best film noir ever made out of Britain.[/tpl] For Oliver! (1968), he  received the Academy Award for Best Director.

==Early life and career==

The illegitimate son of actor-producer Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree and his mistress, May Pinney Reed,[tpl]cite web|url=http://mubi.com/films/10747?from_theauteurs=1 |title=The Stars Look Down - Movie info: cast, reviews, trailer on |publisher=Mubi.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2012-06-13[/tpl] Carol Reed was born in Putney, south-west London, and educated at The King's School, Canterbury, an independent school.
He embarked on an acting career while still in his late teens. A period in the theatrical company of the thriller writer Edgar Wallace followed, and Reed became his personal assistant in 1927.Trevor Hogg "A Great Reed: A Carol Reed Profile (Part 1)", Flickering Myth, 21 October 2009 Apart from acting in a few Wallace derived films himself, Reed became involved in adapting his work for the screen during the day while he was a stage manager in the evenings. The connection with Wallace ended with his death in Hollywood during February 1932. Taken on by Basil Dean, Reed worked for his Associated Talking Pictures, successively for ATP as a dialogue director, second-unit director and then assistant director.[tpl]cite web |title=Carol Reed |date=15 December 2010 |last=Freehan |first=Deirdre |work=Senses of Cinema |url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2003/great-directors/reed/[/tpl] His films in the later role working under Dean were Autumn Crocus, Lorna Doone and Loyalties and (with Thorold Dickinson) Java Head.

==Early films==

His earliest films as director were 'quota quickies'.[tpl]fact|date=September 2013[/tpl] Of his experience making Midshipman Easy (1935) his first solo directorial project he was harsh on himself. "I was indefinite and indecisive", he said later. "I thought I had picked up a lot about cutting and camera angles, but now, when I had to make all the decisions myself and was not just mentally approving or criticizing what somebody else decided, I was pretty much lost. Fortunately, I realized that this was the only way to learn – by making mistakes." Graham Greene, then reviewing films for The Spectator, was much more forgiving,. commenting that Reed "has more sense of the cinema than most veteran British directors".Graham Greene "Stage And Screen: The Cinema", The Spectator, 3 January 1936, p.18  Of Reed's comedy Laburnum Grove (1936), he wrote: "Here at last is an English film one can unreservedly praise". He.was perceptive about Reed's potential, describing the film as "thoroughly workmanlike and unpretentious, with just the hint of a personal manner which makes one believe that Mr. Reed, when he gets the right script, will prove far more than efficient."Graham Greene "Stage And Screen: The Cinema", The Spectator, 30 July 1936, p.15 
Reed's career began to develop with The Stars Look Down (1940), from the A. J. Cronin novel, which features Michael Redgrave in the lead role. Greene wrote that Reed "has at last had his chance and magnificently taken it." He observed that "one forgets the casting altogether: he Reed handles his players like a master, so that one remembers them only as people."Graham Greene "Stage and Screen: The Cinema", The Spectator, 26 January 1940, p.16 

==War years==

The scripts of several of Reed's films in this period were written by Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, with the screenwriters and director working for producer Edward Black, who released through the British subsidiary of  20th Century Fox. The best known of these films are probably Night Train to Munich (1940), with Rex Harrison; Kipps (1941), again with Redgrave; and The Young Mr Pitt (1942), with Robert Donat in the title role. The later film, although historically inaccurate, is set during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.
From 1942, Reed served in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps and was granted the rank of Captain and placed with the film unit, and then the Directorate of Army Psychiatry.Peter William Evans Carol Reed, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2005, p.53 For the later body a training film, The New Lot (1943),was made recounting the experiences of five new recruits, had a script by Eric Ambler and Peter Ustinov with contributions from Reed, and was produced by Thorold Dickinson. It was remade as The Way Ahead (1944).

==Post-war==

Reed made his three most highly regarded films just after the war, beginning with Odd Man Out (1947), with James Mason in the lead. The tale of an injured terrorist's last hours in an unidentified Northern Irish city; Belfast was used for the location work, but remains unnamed in the film itself.
It was the producer Alexander Korda, to whom Reed now signed,.who introduced the director to the novelist Graham Greene.Trevor Hogg "A Great Reed: A Carol Reed Profile (Part 2)", Flickering Myths, 28 October 2009 The next two films were made from screenplays by Greene: The Fallen Idol (1948), and The Third Man (1949). 
The Third Man had the involvement of David O. Selznick, as co-producer with Korda, and the American actors Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten in two of the leading roles. Reed insisted in casting Welles as Harry Lime, although Selzneck had wanted Noël Coward for the role. The film required six weeks of location work in Vienna, during which time it was Reed himself who accidentally discovered the zither player Anton Karas, responsible for the film's music, in a courtyard outside a small Viennese restaurant.
Reed once said: "A picture should end as it has to. I don’t think anything in life ends 'right'". While Greene wanted Holly Martins (Cotten) and Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) to reconcile at the end of the film, after the life of Lime, her lover, has been ended instantly by Martins, Reed insisted that Anna should ignore him and walk on. "The whole point of the Valli character in that film is that she’d experienced a fatal love – and then comes along this silly American!"
According to the film critic Derek Malcolm, The Third Man is the "best film noir ever made out of Britain". The film won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, the predecessor of the Palme d'Or.

==Later career==

Outcast of the Islands (1952), based on a novel by Joseph Conrad, is often thought to mark the start of his creative decline.David Thomson seems to think that in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film, London: Little Brown, 2002, p.721, but ascribes this view to others in Have You Seen, London: Allen Lane, 2008, p.632 The Man Between (1953) is dismissed as a rehash of The Third Man. It "makes no startling impact, such as we have learned to expect from its director, on either the mind or the heart", complained Virginia Graham in The Spectator.Virginia Graham "Cinema", The Spectator, 24 September 1953, p.13 While the fable A Kid for Two Farthings (1955), set in the east end of London, has been claimed as one of very few authentic cinematic depictions of an Anglo-Jewish community,Michael Brooke "Kid for Two Farthings, A (1955)", BFI Screenonline it suffers from the stereotyping of JewsMatthew Reisz "EastEnders - but not as we know it", The Guardian, 15 September 2006 and is no more than a "whimsical curiosity" according to Michael Brooke. It was the last film Reed made for Korda's London Films; the producer died at the beginning of 1956.
Trapeze (1956), although largely shot in Paris, was made for the US Hill-Hecht-Lancaster partnership and was a success at the box-office.  Our Man in Havana (1959) reunited him with Graham Greene who adapted his own novel.
He was contracted to direct a remake of Mutiny on the Bounty (1962) by MGM, but then Marlon Brando was cast as Fletcher Christian, and problems with the mock Bounty and the weather at the locations caused delays.Cliff Goodwin Behaving Badly: Richard Harris, Random House, 2011, p.91 Brando had insisted on creative control,David Thomson Have You Seen?, London: Allen Lane, 2008, p.585 and the two men argued incessantly. Reed left the production at a relatively early stage of production and was replaced by Lewis Milestone.Robert Sellers Hollywood Hellraisers: The Wild Lives and Fast Times of Marlon Brando, Dennis Hopper, Warren Beatty and Jack Nicholson, Random House, 2010, p.34 The Agony and the Ecstasy (1965), made in the United States, was a box-office failure, and was the last film over which Reed also served as producer. Oliver! (1968), made at Shepperton in Surrey, was financially backed by Columbia, and won the  Academy Award for Best Director. "The movie may have been over-produced but it seemed everyone liked it that way", writes Thomas Hischak.Thomas Hischak The Oxford Companion to the American Musical: Theatre, Film and Television, New York: Oxford University Press, 2008, p.547

==Personal life==

From 1943 until 1947, he was married to the British actress Diana Wynyard. After their divorce, he married, in 1948, the actress Penelope Dudley-Ward, also known as Pempie, the elder daughter of Freda Dudley Ward, who had been a mistress of the Duke of Windsor (Edward VIII) when he was Prince of Wales. They had one son, Max. His stepdaughter Tracy Reed, Ward's daughter, also had an acting career.[tpl]IMDb name|1064352|Tracy Reed[/tpl] Actor Oliver Reed was his nephew. 
In 1953, he became only the second British film director to be knighted for his craft. The first was Sir Alexander Korda in 1942, who was the producer of some of Reed's most admired films.
Reed died from a heart attack on 25 April 1976 at his home at 213 King's Road, Chelsea, aged 69. He had lived there since 1948. He is buried in Kensington Cemetery, Gunnersbury, West London, and there is a blue plaque on his former home in his honour.
