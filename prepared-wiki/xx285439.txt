In an interview in 1976, about the 1964 Summer Olympics, Pakandam told Maria Sadeghi Lahijani, a Tehran University journalism student, writing her university thesis; "Iran in the 1964 Summer Olympics", that the Iranian boxing team participants, including himself, had to reduce their weight to a great amount before the tournament started resulting in their excess weakness.
