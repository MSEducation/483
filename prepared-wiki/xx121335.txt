[[Ban Mo District]]

CATEGORIES: Amphoe of Saraburi Province

Ban Mo ([tpl]Lang-th|บ้านหมอ[/tpl]) is a district (Amphoe) in the northwestern part of Saraburi Province, central Thailand.

==History==

After the Buddha footprint near Saraburi was found and a temple was built, King Songtham hired Dutch engineers to build a road from Tha Ruea to Wat Phra Phutthabat to make the pilgrimage there easier. The main workpower was elephants. When the elephants got sick, they were cured at Wat Khok (later called Wat Khok Ban Mo and Wat Ban Mo finally), which thus gave the district its name.

==Geography==

Neighboring districts are (from the west clockwise) Don Phut, Nong Don, Phra Phutthabat, Sao Hai of Saraburi Province, and Tha Ruea of Ayutthaya Province.

==Administration==

The district is subdivided into 9 subdistricts (tambon).
