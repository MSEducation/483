Also in 1977, [[New York City]] experimental punk band Chain Gang released the song "Gary Gilmore and the Island of Dr. Moreau" as the B-side to their single "[[Son of Sam]]" about a contemporary serial killer that was still at large.<ref name=Matador>[tpl]cite web|last=Coley|first=Byron|title=The Amazing History of the CHAIN GANG|url=http://www.matadorrecords.com/chain_gang/forced_exposure.html|publisher=Matador Records|accessdate=November 26, 2011[/tpl]</ref> [[The Police]]'s song "Bring on the Night", from their 1979 album ''[[Reggatta de Blanc]]'', speculated on Gary Gilmore's possible feelings on the evening before the execution took place. In 1980, [[The Judy's]] released the song "How's Gary?" on their album ''Wonderful World of Appliances''. The song presumably asks Gary Gilmore's mother what's wrong with him, saying that he never comes out to play anymore. The song also inquires about the holes in his vest and why he is wearing a blindfold.
Several playwrights have also integrated the Gilmore story into their work in one way or another. The Oakland-based performance artist Monte Cazazza sent out photos of himself in an electric chair on the day of the execution. One of these was mistakenly printed in a Hong Kong newspaper as the real execution. Cazazza was also photographed alongside COUM Transmissions/Throbbing Gristle members Genesis P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti for the "Gary Gilmore Memorial Society" postcard, in which the three artists posed blindfolded and tied to chairs with actual loaded guns pointed at them to depict Gilmore's execution.[ref]
