[[Pay television content descriptors]]

CATEGORIES: Media content ratings systems, Cable television in the United States

The pay television content descriptors are a content advisory system developed by the American pay television industry designed to give viewers of premium television and pay-per-view services an idea of the type(s) of content included in films, specials and television programs. Content descriptors are primarily applied to feature films with a mimimum rating of "PG" as per the Motion Picture Association of America's ratings system or programs with a TV Parental Guideline rating of "TV-PG".

==Development and implementation==

Like the TV Parental Guidelines, which this system predates and is used alongside, it was established as a voluntary participation system, with program content ratings to be determined by the individually participating subscription television networks. The system's creation was spurred by concerns from parents over the amount of violent content in television programs, particularly those seen on premium cable channels. In January 1994, representatives from the cable television industry decided to develop a voluntary rating system for television programs,Cable agrees to monitor violence, Multichannel News, January 17, 1994.

The content system was first introduced on June 10, 1994 by Time Warner-owned premium channels HBO and Cinemax, it then was implemented on Showtime and The Movie Channel (which were owned by Viacom at the time) the following month;Los Angeles Times Archives - Premium Cable Channels Adopt Content Labels Liberty Media's then-new Starz network, which was established earlier that year, and its sister network Encore began implementing the system by the fall of 1994, and select pay-per-view services (such as Viewer's Choice and Request TV) began using the system in early 1997 (since then, Flix, Sundance Channel â€“ which no longer uses the system after its purchase by Rainbow Media in 2008 and conversion into a basic cable channel, MoviePlex and Epix have also utilized the system). The descriptors are similar to the content sub-ratings that were applied to the TV Parental Guidelines in July 1997, though provide a more precise account of the content within a program.
The content descriptions are shown during ratings bumpers aired prior to the start of a film, television series or special, immediately after information on the program rating. Each premium channel labels its own programs separately; because of this, it is conceivable that a film that obtains a "GV" rating for graphic violence on HBO and Cinemax would only get a "V" rating for moderate degrees of violence if the same film aired on Showtime and The Movie Channel; McAdory Lipscomb, former executive vice president of Showtime, described about how the advisories are applied, "It is possible that Showtime would rank something different than HBO, but we both recognize our dual responsibility to provide information to our subscribers about what is graphic or perhaps unsuitable for children, and we think the common language we've developed will provide an acceptable parameter."Rating Sex and Violence in the Media: Media Ratings and Proposals for Reform, Kaiser Family Foundation, November 2002.
Prior to the creation of the content descriptions, premium television services did not reference the content within a film, television series or special on-air (though program guides provided by the pay cable channels did reference the type of content in each program); instead pay channels usually only used vague explanations of adult content using the program rating (for example, "The following movie has been rated "PG-13" by the Motion Picture Association of America, some material may be inappropriate for young children, parents may wish to consider whether it should be viewed by those under 13"). Though the use of announcers to read aloud the program ratings was commonplace at the time the descriptors were introduced (its use having decreased since that point), the program's specific content was generally never verbally announced, though Showtime and The Movie Channel did utilize verbal references to a program's content (read by longtime staff announcer Bill St. James) during ratings bumpers before programs between 1994 and 1997.Mid 90s Showtime promos
Content descriptions are also used on certain video-on-demand services operated by pay television services; currently, HBO, Cinemax and Starz are the only premium channels using descriptors on video-on-demand content, due to the services utilizing ratings bumpers seen on each of the services' linear cable channels prior to the start of a program selection. More recently, Comedy Central, despite being only a basic cable channel in the United States, has started to use the "Graphic Language" advisory on its series South Park and Workaholics, however, not all television guides choose to carry this.

==Content ratings==

===Examples===

Virtually all softcore pornographic adult films broadcast on pay television networks are given content ratings for strong sexual content, nudity, adult content and adult language; although occasionally, an adult movie may be tagged for a scene that contains some degree of violent content, if included. G-rated films, however, are typically not given content ratings as most do not feature any objectionable content.
A key example of these content ratings is in the 2010 comedy Get Him to the Greek, which made its premium cable debut on HBO and Cinemax in 2011; the film (originally rated "R" for its theatrical release, but assigned a "TV-MA-L,S,V" rating by HBO and Cinemax, due to its broadcast of the unrated version of the film) was tagged for adult content (due to its pervasive sexual dialogue, drug references, moderate alcohol and drug use, and crude humor, including two scenes involving vomiting), strong sexual content (due to two scenes in which Jonah Hill's character Aaron Green is seen having intercourse with two different women on two separate occasions, neither of which included any nudity, although one featured Green getting a dildo inserted in his mouth and rubbed on his face), graphic language (due to the inclusion of 100+ expletives in the film) and nudity (because of two scenes involving topless women, and one scene including partially exposed male buttocks).

==Use of content descriptors based on rating==

==Design variations==

The default font used for the content descriptor icons is a variant of the Chicago typeface, either displayed with white type on a black blackground or black type on a white background, on a rectangular box with a simulated drop-shadow. Currently, only certain multiplex channels owned by Showtime Networks (with the exception of the main Showtime channel, Showtime 2, Showtime Extreme and Showcase) continue to use the original 1995 version (the aforementioned exceptions utilize an italicized DIN font), Sundance Channel also used the 1994 icons until coming under the ownership of Rainbow Media and transitioning into a commercial-free basic cable channel.
HBO uses Gotham Regular and Cinemax uses Gotham Bold Italic for their ratings icons, matching both channels' current imaging text. Starz use variant icons with a Helvetica font on a square background, while Encore and certain pay-per-view services use variant icons with a Helvetica font used for the descriptions on a circle. Epix uses the Blue Highway font for the descriptors and is the only premium channel to display the content descriptors alongside the film/program rating instead of after the rating information.
