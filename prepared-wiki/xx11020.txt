</ref> Older, [[Stellar population|population II]] stars have substantially less metallicity than the younger, population I stars due to the composition of the molecular clouds from which they formed. Over time these clouds become increasingly enriched in heavier elements as older stars die and shed portions of their [[stellar atmosphere|atmospheres]].

As stars of at least 0.4 solar masses exhaust their supply of hydrogen at their core, their outer layers expand greatly and cool to form a red giant. In about 5 billion years, when the Sun enters this phase, it will expand to a maximum radius of roughly [tpl]convert|1|AU|e6km|lk=in|abbr=off[/tpl], 250 times its present size. As a giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its current mass.[tpl]cite journal | last1=Sackmann | first1=I. J. | last2=Boothroyd | first2=A. I. | last3=Kraemer | first3=K. E. | title=Our Sun. III.

In a red giant of up to 2.25 solar masses, hydrogen fusion proceeds in a shell surrounding the core.[ref]
