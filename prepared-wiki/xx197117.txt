George A. Hastings (13 January 1877 â€“ 29 January 1956) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Essendon in the early years of the Victorian Football League (VFL).
Hastings usually played on the wing but was also a centreman at times. A member of Essendon's inaugural premiership team in 1897 and again in 1901, Hastings also played in losing Grand Final sides in 1898 and 1902. He represented the Victorian interstate team against South Australia in 1903. His career ended when he began suffering from rheumatic fever and he later returned to the VFL as an umpire.
