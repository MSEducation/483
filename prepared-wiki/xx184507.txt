Johnson was charged with manslaughter but, when the case came to court on 18 November 1995, the judge decided that there was not enough evidence to charge him with manslaughter and, having already pleaded guilty to a charge of common assault, Johnson was instead put on probation and ordered to complete 100 hours of community service.[tpl]cite news | title =Rayner Family Shocked At Verdict | date =22 December 1995 | url =http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/results/archives/dec95/22_12.html | accessdate = 2013-08-19[/tpl]
