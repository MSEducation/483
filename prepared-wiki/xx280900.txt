==Personal life==

Ovidijus Galdikas previously had sex with 13 years old girl, who looked much more mature and lied to him about her age, telling him that she was 16–17 years old. The girl seems to be promiscuous as she was boasting in the media, after becoming the youngest wife in Lithuania, that she first had sex when she was only 10 years old (again with an 18+ guy). Galdikas was 18-19 year old at that time and the girl became pregnant. He had a choice: go to jail for statutory rape or marry her. He chose to marry her.Preschool: youngest Lithuanian wife [tpl]lt icon[/tpl] And that's when his life became even more complicated. He was a member of Žalgiris-Arvydas Sabonis school for one season (2006-2007) and had all the possibilities to move to Žalgiris after a few seasons as he was a quite perspective big man. However, Žalgiris-Arvydas Sabonis school wasn't paying enough for him to fulfill his family needs, so he left the school despite the fact that he loved basketball, and went to work in a factory, later - in auto service in order to feed his new family. Then around 2009, basketball agent Šarūnas Broga (his current agent) and Klemensas (Lithuanian basketball player, who played in France at that time) noticed him – a 7'2 Lithuanian tower who didn't play basketball in a basketball-crazy nation (as he described). However he wasn't ready for professional basketball, so Broga and Klemensas started training him. Klemensas took him to France for training and then he joined Vilnius KM-Magnus (third-tier Lithuanian league club) during the 2009–2010 season, where he averaged 21.2 points, 10.9 rebounds. Next season, he joined Anykščiai Puntukas (second-tier Lithuanian league club) and averaged 14.8 points, 9.3 rebounds and 3 blocks.Giant starting again with basketball ball [tpl]lt icon[/tpl] Sadly, he had to miss 2011-2012 season due to injuries. In 2012 he joined Šiauliai.Šiauliai signs Galdikas [tpl]lt icon[/tpl] However, the team didn't give him enough playing time and he had only decent statistics, because Šiauliai had a more experienced Papa Dia. According to reports, Knicks has observed him for more than 3 years, and even Knicks president visited Šiauliai last season to meet with Galdikas and watch him play (sadly, he was injured at that timeSeason is done for Ovidijus Galdikas [tpl]lt icon[/tpl]).
