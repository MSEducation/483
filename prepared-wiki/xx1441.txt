The Carolina Panthers are a professional American football team based in Charlotte, North Carolina. They play in the southern division of the National Football Conference (NFC), one of the two conferences in the National Football League (NFL). The team is worth approximately USD $1 billion, according to Forbes, and is controlled by Jerry Richardson and his family; they have a 48% stake. The remainder of the team is held by a group of 14 limited partners. The head coach is Ron Rivera, while the president is Danny Morrison.
The Panthers first competed in 1995 and fared well in their first two years, finishing [tpl]Win-loss record|w=7|l=9[/tpl] in 1995 (an all-time best for an expansion NFL team's first season) and [tpl]Win-loss record|w=12|l=4[/tpl] in 1996. They did not have another winning season until 2003, when the team won the NFC Championship Game and reached Super Bowl XXXVIII, losing 32–29 to the New England Patriots. After recording playoff appearances in 2005 and 2008, the team failed to record another playoff appearance until 2013, when they finished with a [tpl]Win-loss record|w=12|l=4[/tpl] record and won the NFC South. The Panthers have made the playoffs five times, reaching the NFC Championship Game in three of them. They have won four division titles, one of them in the NFC West and three of them in the NFC South; they have qualified for the playoffs five times.

At home games, the atmosphere has been described as comparable to that of other NFL teams, with some games playing host to a large number of fans of the opposing team; this has been attributed to several factors, such as the city's relatively recent entry into the NFL, the popularity of basketball in the Charlotte region, and the large number of Charlotte residents who are originally from other cities with NFL teams. The Panthers' uniforms consist of black, white, and blue jerseys paired with white and silver pants, a pattern which has only seen minor changes since the team's inception. The team maintains rivalries with the three other teams in the NFC South, in addition to having out-of-division rivalries with the Arizona Cardinals and Dallas Cowboys.

==History==

On December 15, 1987, entrepreneur Jerry Richardson announced his bid for an NFL expansion franchise in the Carolinas. A native of North Carolina, Richardson was a former wide receiver on the Baltimore Colts who had used his 1958 league championship bonus to co-found the Hardee's chain of restaurants and served as president and CEO of TW Services. Richardson drew his inspiration to pursue an NFL franchise from George Shinn, who had made a successful bid for an expansion team in Charlotte, the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Richardson founded Richardson Sports, a partnership consisting of himself and his family; a number of businessmen from North and South Carolina were also recruited to be limited partners in the group.[tpl]cite journal |last=Hoffer |first=Richard |date=October 28, 1991 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1140299/index.htm |title=The Franchise |journal=Sports Illustrated |location=New York |publisher=Time Inc. |pages=64–66, 70, 72–73 |volume=75 |issue=19 |issn=0038-822X |accessdate=April 28, 2013[/tpl] Richardson looked at four potential locations for a stadium, ultimately choosing uptown Charlotte. To highlight the demand for professional football in the Carolinas, Richardson Sports held a preseason game in the region in 1989, 1990, and 1991. The first two games were held in Carter-Finley Stadium in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Kenan Memorial Stadium in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, respectively, while the third and final game was held at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, South Carolina. The matchups were between existing NFL teams. In 1991, the group formally filed an application for the open expansion spot, and on October 23, 1993, the 28 NFL owners unanimously named the Carolina Panthers as the 29th member of the NFL.
The Panthers first competed in the 1995 NFL season; they were one of two expansion teams to begin playing that year, with the other being the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Panthers were put in the NFC West to increase the size of that division to five teams; the Panthers were pleased with their placement because there were two other southeastern teams in the division, the Atlanta Falcons and the New Orleans Saints.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1994-11-03/sports/25869909_1_realignment-issue-realignment-proposals-change-divisions|title=Nfl Owners Decide Against Realignment Complications Carolina Panthers "Slotted" To Nfc West.

Following a rocky [tpl]Win-loss record|w=1|l=7[/tpl] start in 2004, the Panthers rebounded to win six of their last seven games despite losing 14 players for the season due to injury.

==Logo and uniforms==

In choosing the team name, the Richardsons did not run focus groups with potential fans. Their intention had always been the 'Panthers'; Jerry Richardson began driving a car with the license plate 'PNTHRS' near the end of 1989. By the time they had been announced as the 29th NFL team in October 1993, the Panthers' logo and helmet design had already been finalized, but the uniform design was still under creation. After discussion, the Panthers organization decided on jerseys colored white, black, and blue, and pants colored white and silver. The exact tone of blue, which they decided would be "process blue" (a shade lighter than Duke's and darker than North Carolina's), was the most difficult color to choose. The team's uniform has remained largely the same since its creation, with only minor alterations such as changing the sock color of the team's black uniforms from blue to black and changing the team's shoes from white to black.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2008/10/25/279610/fifteen-years-of-the-panthers.html|title=Fifteen years of the Panthers|last=Chandler|first=Charles|date=October 26, 2008|work=The Charlotte Observer|accessdate=January 27, 2013[/tpl] Richardson, a self-described traditionalist, has said that no major uniform changes will be made in his lifetime;[tpl]cite web|url=http://scottfowlerobs.blogspot.com/2012/02/richardson-tells-panther-fan-that.html|title=Richardson tells Panther fan that helmets will change, uniforms won't|last=Fowler|first=Scott|date=February 2, 2012|publisher=Scott Says. The Charlotte Observer|accessdate=January 27, 2013[/tpl] the Panthers did, however, change their logo and logotype in 2012, the first such change in team history. According to the team, the changes were designed to give their logo an "aggressive, contemporary look" as well to give it a more three-dimensional feel.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Panthers-introduce-refined-logo/22b44075-6ab5-477d-ac6d-7d29733deea0|title=Panthers introduce refined logo|publisher=Carolina Panthers|date=January 29, 2012|accessdate=January 27, 2013[/tpl]

The first such instance was in 1998, when the team paired their white jerseys with silver pants in a game against the Indianapolis Colts. The second instance was in 2012 during a game against the Denver Broncos, when they paired their black jerseys with black pants; this created an all-black uniform, with the exception of blue socks and silver helmets. The decision to wear blue socks was made by team captain Steve Smith, who felt the blue socks gave the uniforms a more distinct appearance compared with other teams that have all-black uniforms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Notes-Committed-to-the-Carolinas-/9446340f-a92c-4b97-a631-6f1bd7c45cd7|title=Notes: Committed to the Carolinas|last=Henson|first=Max|publisher=Carolina Panthers|accessdate=January 27, 2013[/tpl] The all-black uniforms won the "Greatest Uniform in NFL History" contest, a fan-voted contest run by NFL.com in July 2013.

The team's uniform did not change significantly after Nike became the NFL's jersey supplier in 2012, but the collar was altered to honor former Panthers player and coach Sam Mills by featuring the phrase "Keep Pounding". Nike had conceived the idea, and the team supported the concept as a way to expose newer fans to the legacy of Mills, who died of cancer in 2005. Mills had introduced the phrase, which has since become a team slogan, in a speech that he gave to the players and coaches prior to their 2003 playoff game against Dallas; in the speech, Mills compared his fight against cancer with the team's on-field battle, saying "When I found out I had cancer, there were two things I could do – quit or keep pounding. I'm a fighter. I kept pounding. You're fighters, too. Keep pounding!"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thestate.com/2012/04/04/2220106/carolina-panthers-uniforms-to.html|title=Carolina Panthers' uniforms to honor Sam Mills legacy|last=Fowler|first=Scott|date=April 3, 2012|work=The State|accessdate=January 27, 2013[/tpl]

==Stadium and practice facilities==

The Panthers played their first season at Memorial Stadium in Clemson, South Carolina, as their facility in uptown Charlotte was still under construction. Ericsson Stadium, called Bank of America Stadium since 2004, opened in the summer of 1996. It was primarily financed by the Panthers, and they raised money largely through the sale of permanent seat licensess (PSLs);[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.panthers.com/team/history/chronology.html|title=Chronology|work=Team History|publisher=Carolina Panthers|accessdate=January 19, 2013[/tpl] they paid $248 million for the stadium's construction, the entirety of the stadium's cost, while the city of Charlotte paid $60 million for "land and infrastructure developments".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2012/09/19/3542137/city-to-weigh-money-for-stadium.html|title=Charlotte to weigh money for Panthers' stadium upgrades|last=Harrison|first=Steve|date=September 19, 2012|work=The Charlotte Observer|accessdate=January 19, 2013[/tpl] In February 2013, the city of Charlotte tentatively agreed to a $250 million improvement package for the stadium, with half to be paid by the city and the other half to be split by the State of North Carolina and the Panthers. This deal would have required the Panthers to remain in Charlotte for the next 15 years and would have been funded by a 1 percent increase in Charlotte's food and beverage tax.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2013/02/08/3841653/carolina-panthers-officials-head.html|title=New city plan increases tax money for Panthers, ties team to Charlotte|last=Bethea|first=April|date=February 8, 2013|work=The Charlotte Observer|accessdate=February 9, 2013[/tpl] This deal was contingent on the North Carolina State Legislature approving the increase, but neither the legislature nor governor Pat McCrory supported it. In April 2013, the Charlotte City Council unanimously approved a scaled-down $87.5 million package, to be paid over six years with a six-year agreement from the Panthers to remain in Charlotte. The money will go to build escalators to help fans reach the stadium's upper deck, as well as to buy new video boards and to improve the sound system.[tpl]cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9199272/charlotte-votes-approve-carolina-panthers-stadium-renovations|title=Charlotte votes to renovate|date=April 26, 2013|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=May 26, 2013[/tpl]

According to Mike Cranston, a running joke said that the Panthers' division rivals had pooled their resources to purchase a room on the building's top floor, and that a fire at the condominium was caused by the Panthers organization.[tpl]cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-09-13-1194181679_x.htm|title=Panthers fortify practice facility to keep out spies|last=Cranston|first=Mike|work=USA Today|accessdate=January 25, 2013|date=September 13, 2007[/tpl] In order to prevent people from seeing inside the field while the team is practicing, the team has added "strategically planted trees and a tarp over the ... fence surrounding the fields". Additionally, they employ a security team to watch for and chase away any people who stop alongside the fence surrounding the field. In the event of bad weather, the team moves their practices to an indoor sports facility about 10 miles from the stadium.

Pat Yasinskas of ESPN.com observed that while there is "a bit of a wine-and-cheese atmosphere at Panthers games ... there is a strong core of diehard fans who bring energy to Bank of America Stadium. Charlotte lives and dies with the Panthers because there aren't a lot of other options in the sports world".[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/preview08/columns/story?id=3549147|title=Playoff drought leaves Dolphins' fans parched for a winner|last=Yasinskas|first=Pat|date=August 29, 2008|publisher=ESPN.com|page=3|accessdate=January 19, 2013[/tpl] The Panthers are also supported in South Carolina; Nikki Haley, the state's Governor, declared July 30, 2012, "Carolina Panthers Day" in her state, saying that "when it comes to professional teams, the Carolina Panthers are the team that South Carolina calls their own". Sports Illustrated graded the Panthers as having the tenth-highest "NFL Fan Value Experience", attributing much of the fan atmosphere to the team's newness when compared to the established basketball fanbase. They noted that while visiting fans can outnumber Panthers fans at home games depending on who they play, this is partially because many of Charlotte's residents are "transplants ... from NYC, Philly, and Atlanta". They also observed that the stadium has scattered parking lots, each of which has a different tailgating style. Some have fried chicken, pork, or Carolina-style barbecue, while others have live bands and televisions. Pickup football games in the parking lots are common, but fans tend to "behave themselves", in part due to blue laws that prevent the sale of alcohol before noon on Sundays.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/football/nfl/10/29/fvi.panthers/|title=NFL Fan Value Experience|date=November 7, 2007|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=January 19, 2013[/tpl]

===Mascot, cheerleaders, and drumline===

Sir Purr, an anthropomorphic black cat who wears a jersey numbered '00', has been the Panthers' mascot since their first season. During games, Sir Purr provides sideline entertainment through skits and "silly antics".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.panthers.com/fanzone/mascot.html|title=Mascot|publisher=Carolina Panthers|accessdate=January 22, 2013[/tpl] The mascot participates in a number of community events year-round, including a monthly visit to the patients at Levine Children's Hospital. Sir Purr also hosts the annual Mascot Bowl, an event which pits pro and college mascots against each other during halftime at a selected Panthers home game.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.panthers.com/fanzone/mascot/outreach.html|title=Sir Purr – Outreach|publisher=Carolina Panthers|accessdate=April 28, 2013[/tpl]

In 2003 the Panthers and Carolinas HealthCare Foundation established the Keep Pounding Fund, a fundraising initiative to support cancer research and patient support programs. The Panthers community has raised more than $1.4 million for the fund through direct donations, charity auctions, blood drives, and an annual 5k stadium run. The Panthers and Levine Children's Hospital coordinate monthly hospital visits and VIP game-day experiences for terminally ill or hospitalized children.[tpl]cite web|title=Keep Pounding|url=http://www.panthers.com/community/keep-pounding.html|publisher=Carolina Panthers|accessdate=September 9, 2013[/tpl]
In addition to these team-specific efforts, the Panthers participate in a number of regular initiatives promoted by the NFL and USA Football, the league's youth football development partner. These include USA Football Month, held throughout August to encourage and promote youth football; A Crucial Catch, the league's Breast Cancer Awareness Month program; Salute to Service, held throughout November to support military families and personnel; and PLAY 60, which encourages young NFL fans to be active for at least 60 minutes each day.[tpl]cite web|title=Community|url=http://www.panthers.com/community/|publisher=Carolina Panthers|accessdate=September 9, 2013[/tpl]

==Rivalries==

The Panthers have developed a number of rivalries during their time in the NFL, including heated ones with the three fellow members of the NFC South (the Atlanta Falcons, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and New Orleans Saints).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2008/09/28/218960/sorensen-falcons-vs-panthers-is.html|title=Sorensen: Falcons vs. Panthers is no rivalry|last=Sorenson|first=Tom|date=September 28, 2008|work=The Charlotte Observer|accessdate=January 22, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wwltv.com/sports/black-and-gold/Saints-Panthers-rivalry-deepening-after-New-Orleans-30-27-win-131475403.html|title=Saints, Panthers rivalry deepening after New Orleans' 30–27 win |date=October 21, 2011|publisher=WWL-TV|accessdate=January 22, 2013[/tpl] The team's fiercest rivals are the Falcons[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/68147/panthers-score-some-points-for-rivera|title=Panthers score some points for Rivera|last=Yasinskas|first=Pat|date=December 9, 2012|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=January 22, 2013[/tpl] and Buccaneers.
The Falcons are a natural geographic rival for the Panthers, as Atlanta is only 230 miles (370 kilometers) and five hours south on I-85.  Indeed, games between the two teams feature thousands of visiting-team fans following their team up and down I-85.  The two teams have played each other twice a year since the Panthers joined the league, first as members of the NFC West and currently in the NFC South.
The Panthers' rivalry with Tampa Bay is perhaps one of the better rivalries in the NFC South. The rivalry originated in 2002 with the formation of the NFC South, but became particularly heated before the 2003 season with verbal bouts between players on the two teams. It escalated further when the Panthers went to Tampa Bay and beat them in what ESPN.com writer Pat Yasinskas described as "one of the most physical contests in recent memory". The rivalry has resulted in a number of severe injuries for players on both teams, some of which have been caused by foul play.[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcsouth/post/_/id/292/nfc-south-s-most-intense-rivalry-panthers-vs-bucs|title=NFC South's most intense rivalry: Panthers vs. Bucs|last=Yasinskas|first=Pat|date=September 11, 2008|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=January 22, 2013[/tpl] One of these plays, an illegal hit on Tampa Bay punt returner Clifton Smith, sparked a brief melee between the two teams.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/sports/football/bucs/carolina-panthers-cornerback-dante-wesley-suspended-for-hit-on-tampa-bay/1045286|title=Carolina Panthers cornerback Dante Wesley suspended for hit on Tampa Bay Buccaneers returner Clifton Smith|last=Holder|first=Stephen F.|date=October 19, 2009|work=Tampa Bay Times|accessdate=March 4, 2013[/tpl]
Outside the division, the Panthers have several other rivals. During their time in the NFC West, the Panthers began developing a rivalry with the San Francisco 49ers. However, this rivalry faded after the NFL moved the Panthers out of the NFC West.[tpl]cite web|url=http://scottfowlerobs.blogspot.com/2010/10/my-panthers-49ers-prediction.html|title=My Panthers-49ers prediction|last=Fowler|first=Scott|date=October 22, 2010|publisher=Scott Says.

Jerry Richardson is the owner and founder of the Carolina Panthers.

Mike McCormack, a Hall of Fame lineman for the Cleveland Browns and former coach and executive for the Seattle Seahawks, was the Panthers' first team president, presiding in that role from 1994 until his retirement in 1997; McCormack was inducted as the first person in the Carolina Panthers Hall of Honor later that year. Jerry Richardson's son, Mark, was appointed as the team's second president in 1997 and served in that role until he stepped down in 2009. His brother Jon, who had been president of Bank of America Stadium, stepped down at the same time. The resignations of Mark and Jon Richardson were unexpected, as it was thought that the two would eventually take over the team from their father.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4437524|title=Richardson's sons resign unexpectedly|last=Yasinskas|first=Pat|date=September 1, 2009|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=January 29, 2013[/tpl] Mark Richardson was replaced by Danny Morrison, who had previously served as the athletic director of Texas Christian University.[tpl]cite web|url=http://blogs.charlotte.com/panthers/2009/09/danny-morrison-file.html|title=Danny Morrison file|last=Person|first=Joe|author2=Jones, Jonathan|author3= Green Jr., Ron|date=September 2, 2009|accessdate=January 29, 2013|publisher=Charlotte.com[/tpl]
The Carolina Panthers have had four head coaches. Dom Capers was the head coach from 1995 to 1998 and led the team to one playoff appearance. Counting playoff games, he finished with a record of 31–35 (.470). George Seifert coached the team from 1999 to 2001, recording 16 wins and 32 losses (.333).
