==Habitat==

The reticulated python lives in rain forests, woodlands, and nearby grasslands. It is also associated with rivers and is found in areas with nearby streams and lakes. An excellent swimmer, it has even been reported far out at sea and has consequently colonised many small islands within its range. During the early years of the twentieth century it is said to have been common even in busy parts of Bangkok, sometimes eating domestic animals.Stidworthy J. 1974. Snakes of the World. Grosset & Dunlap Inc. 160 pp. ISBN 0-448-11856-4.

==Feeding==

Their natural diet includes mammals and occasionally birds. Small specimens up to 3–4 m (10–14 ft) long eat mainly rodents such as rats, whereas larger individuals switch to prey such as Viverridae (e.g. civets and binturongs), and even primates and pigs. Near human habitation, they are known to snatch stray chickens, cats, and dogs on occasion. Among the largest, fully documented prey items to have been taken are a half-starved Sun Bear of 23 kilograms that was eaten by a 6.95 m (23 ft) specimen and took some ten weeks to digest as well as pigs of more than 60 kg (132 lb).Shine R, Harlow PS, Keogh JS, Boeadi NI. (1998). The influence of sex and body size on food habits of a giant tropical snake, Python reticulatus. Functional Ecology 12:248–258. As a rule of thumb, these snakes seem able to swallow prey up to one-quarter their own length and up to their own weight.[tpl]cite journal|year=2005|title= Predation on Sun Bears by Reticulated Python in East Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo|journal=Raffles Bulletin of Zoology|volume=53|issue=1|pages=165–168|url=http://rmbr.nus.edu.sg/rbz/biblio/53/53rbz165-168.pdf|author=Fredriksson, Gabriella M. [/tpl] As with all pythons, they are primarily ambush hunters, usually waiting until prey wanders within strike range before seizing it in their coils and killing via constriction. However, there is at least one documented case of a foraging python entering a forest hut and taking a child.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1115116108 |title=Hunter–gatherers and other primates as prey, predators, and competitors of snakes|year=2011|last1=Headland|first1=T.

==Danger to humans==

Attacks on humans are rare, but this species has been responsible for several human fatalities, in both the wild and captivity. They are among the few snakes that have been suggested to prey on humans. However, there are few authenticated cases of a snake species consuming human beings. Reports of human fatalities and unauthenticated sources of human consumption include:
Considering the known maximum prey size, it is technically possible for a full-grown specimen of Python reticulatus to open its jaws wide enough to swallow a human teenager, but the width of the shoulders of adult Homo sapiens would likely pose a problem for even a snake with sufficient size.

==Reproduction==

Oviparous, females lay between 15 and 80 eggs per clutch. At an optimum incubation temperature of 31–32 °C (88–90 °F), the eggs take an average of 88 days to hatch. Hatchlings are at least 2 feet (61 cm) in length.

==Captivity==

Increased popularity in the pet trade is due largely to increased efforts in captive breeding and selectively bred mutations such as the "albino" and "tiger" strains.  They can make good captives, but keepers should have previous experience with such large constrictors to ensure safety to both animal and keeper. Although their interactivity and beauty draws much attention, some feel they are unpredictable.[tpl]cite web | url = http://ecoterrariumsupply.com/reticulated-python-care.php | title = Reticulated Python Care (Python reticulatus) – Eco Terrarium Supply | accessdate = 2009-02-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.boatips.com/reticulatedpythons/ | title = Reticulated Pythons - Boatips.com | accessdate = 2009-02-06[/tpl] They do not attack humans by nature, but will bite and possibly constrict if they feel threatened, or mistake a hand for food. While not venomous, large pythons can inflict serious injuries, sometimes requiring stitches.
The huge size and attractive pattern of these snakes has made them favorite zoo exhibits, with several individuals claimed to be above [tpl]convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] in length and more than one claimed to be the largest in captivity.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,322408,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Columbus Zoo Pays to Keep Largest Snake in Captivity on Permanent Display | date=14 January 2008[/tpl]22-Foot Python In Fla.

New York Times (2002-11-22). Retrieved on 2012-08-21.  However, due to their huge size, immense strength, aggressive disposition, and the mobility of the skin relative to the body, it is very difficult to get exact length measurements on a living reticulated python, and weights are rarely indicative, as captive pythons are often obese.  Claims made by zoos and animal parks are sometimes exaggerated, such as the claimed [tpl]convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] snake in Indonesia which was subsequently proven to be less than [tpl]convert|23|ft|m[/tpl] long.Aglionby, John (2004-01-05) Stay still, will you?. Guardian. Retrieved on 2012-08-21.  For this reason, scientists do not accept the validity of length measurements unless performed on a dead or anaesthetised snake which is later preserved in a museum collection.
There are now "super dwarf" reticulated pythons from some islands north west of Australia where the adults rarely get more than [tpl]convert|15|ft|m[/tpl] long, and are being bred to be much smaller. Males can be at most [tpl]convert|5|ft|m[/tpl] long, females a little longer.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]

==Taxonomy==

Three subspecies may be encountered, including two new ones:
The latter two are dwarf subspecies. Apparently, the population of the Sangihe Islands north of Sulawesi represents another such subspecies which is basal to the P. r. reticulatus plus P. r. jampeanus clade, but it is not yet formally described.
