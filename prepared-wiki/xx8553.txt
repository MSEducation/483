Nigeria's media scene is one of the most vibrant in Africa. Because newspapers and television are relatively expensive and literacy levels low, radio remains the most important medium of mass communication and information. International broadcasters, including the BBC, are popular. TV viewing is concentrated in urban areas."Nigeria Profile", BBC News, 12 September 2013. 
The largest broadcasting companies are the government-owned Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN)[tpl]cite web|url=http://ww2.radionigeria.gov.ng/fr360.php?360ID=5 |title=Radio Nigeria Online |publisher=Ww2.radionigeria.gov.ng |date= |accessdate=10 November 2013[/tpl] and the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA).http://www.nta.com.ng/ [tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] The NTA has two television services.  One is NTA 1, which is distributed among NTA's six television zones. The other is NTA 2, which is distributed nationwide and is funded mostly by advertising. NITEL owns a majority of the transmitters that broadcast FRCN and NTA programming.[tpl]citation needed |date=February 2014[/tpl]
Each state also has a broadcasting company that broadcasts one or two locally operated terrestrial stations. This means that there are about 50 government owned, but partly independent television stations. Private players in the Nigerian television scene include: Silverbird Television (STV),[tpl]cite web|url=http://silverbirdtv.com/ |title=Silverbird Television |publisher=Silverbirdtv.com |accessdate=10 November 2013[/tpl] Africa Independent Television (AIT),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.daargroup.com/ |title=DAAR Group • DAAR Communications |publisher=Daargroup.com |date= |accessdate=10 November 2013[/tpl] Channels Television,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.channelstv.com |title=Channelstv |publisher=Channelstv.com |date= |accessdate=10 November 2013[/tpl] Superscreen Television,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.superscreentelevision.com/ |title=Superscreentelevision.com |publisher=Superscreentelevision.com |date= |accessdate=10 November 2013[/tpl] and several others. Most of their programming is aimed for the African and global markets and is broadcast globally from Lagos, Abuja, Obosi and Port Harcourt centers with affiliated TV stations in several African countries. African Independent Television (AIT)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aittv.com/ |title=AIT International |publisher=Aittv.com |date= |accessdate=10 November 2013[/tpl] is a high profile satellite television station broadcasting globally from its Lagos and Abuja centers. Other direct satellite television stations with international reach operating in Nigeria are Murhi International Television, ON Television, Galaxy TV, TV Continental, etc. all in Lagos.
There is general access to cable television like DSTV,[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.dstv.com/ |title=Movies | Sport | Series | Music | TV Guide | Entertainment |publisher=DStv |date= |accessdate=10 November 2013[/tpl] a South African cable television station, broadcast over satellite.

M-Net ceased operations in December 2011, but had offices in most Nigerian cities, and was watched by a large number of people.[tpl]citation needed |date=February 2014[/tpl]

===Media control and press freedom===

The government controls much of the electronic media through the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), which is responsible for monitoring and regulating broadcast media. Radio stations remain susceptible to political censorship and attacks by political groups. For example, in January 2012 some media figures alleged the NBC warned radio stations not to broadcast stories about fuel subsidy protests.
Libel is a civil offense and requires defendants to prove the truth of opinion or value judgment contained in news reports or commentaries, or pay penalties. This limits the circumstances in which media defendants can rely on the defense of "fair comment on matters of public interest" and restricts their right to freedom of expression. Penalties for defamation of character include two years' imprisonment and possible fines.
The law requires local television stations to limit programming from other countries to 40 percent and restricts foreign content of satellite broadcasting to 20 percent. The NBC's 2004 prohibition of live broadcasts of foreign news and programs remains in force, but does not apply to international cable or satellite services. The Voice of America is not allowed to broadcast programs through local affiliate stations.
Security forces beat, detain, and harass journalists. On numerous occasions security forces and police have arrested and detained journalists who criticized the government. Reporting on matters such as political corruption and security issues are particularly sensitive. Politicians and political parties harass and attack journalists perceived as reporting on them or their interests in a negative manner. During local and state elections, journalists have been intimidated or attacked for covering certain election-related events. Journalists have been killed while reporting stories. The militant group Boko Haram threatens media outlets and has killed members of the press. On 20 January 2012, unknown gunmen killed Channels TV reporter Enenche Akogwu while he was reporting on the Boko Haram attacks and bombings in Kano that day. Journalists practice self-censorship.

Deregulation of the mobile phone market has led to the introduction of Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) network providers operating on the 900/1800 MHz spectrum, MTN Nigeria,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mtnonline.com |title=MTN |publisher=Mtnonline.com |accessdate=10 November 2013[/tpl] Airtel,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ng.airtel.com |title=Africa.airtel|publisher=Ng.airtel.com |date= |accessdate=10 November 2013[/tpl] Globacom,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gloworld.com |title=Glo Mobile |publisher=Gloworld.com |date= |accessdate=10 November 2013[/tpl] and Etisalat.[tpl]cite web|author=Portal Service |url=http://www.etisalat.com.ng |title=Etisalat Nigeria |publisher=Etisalat.com.ng |date= |accessdate=10 November 2013[/tpl] Use of cell-phones has soared, and has mostly replaced the unreliable fixed line services of Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL). An October 2011 estimate placed the number of mobile phones at about 88 million, with most people having more than one cellphone.[tpl]citation needed |date=February 2014[/tpl]
With the expiration of the exclusivity period of the main GSM network providers, Nigeria's telecom regulator, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), introduced the Unified Licencing Regime. It is hoped that telcos with unified licences will be able to provide fixed and mobile telephony and Internet access as well as any other communications service they choose to offer. In March 2011 the NCC started registering SIM cards. The exercise is expected to last until 28 September 2011.http://www.ncc.gov.ng/sim-registration/about-simreg.html [tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl][tpl]update after|2014|2|21[/tpl][tpl]citation needed |date=February 2014[/tpl]
After a decade of failed privatization attempts, the incumbent national telco NITEL and its mobile arm M-Tel are currently in liquidation."Nigeria - Key Statistics, Telecom Market and Regulatory Overviews", BuddeComm, 12 December 2013. Retrieved 22 February 2014.

A new dimension to Internet connectivity has been introduced with millions of people accessing the Internet on their WAP-enabled mobile phones, smartphones and on their PCs using their phones as a modem. This is largely due to the introduction of GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) and EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution) connectivity by the GSM operators. All existing GSM networks presently offer GPRS services and have introduced  3G/UMTS.[tpl]citation needed |date=February 2014[/tpl]

===Internet censorship and surveillance===

Listed by the OpenNet Initiative as no evidence of Internet filtering in all four areas for which they test (political, social, conflict/security, and Internet tools) in October 2009."ONI Country Profiles", Research section at the OpenNet Initiative web site, a collaborative partnership of the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto; the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University; and the SecDev Group, Ottawa.
There are few government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms. Although the constitution and law provide for freedom of speech, including for members of the press, the government sometimes restricts these rights in practice. Libel is a civil offense and requires defendants to prove the truth of opinion or value judgment contained in news reports or commentaries. Penalties include two years' imprisonment and possible fines. Militant groups such as Boko Haram threaten, attack, and kill journalists in connection with their reporting of the sect’s activities. Journalists practice self-censorship."Nigeria", Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 4 April 2013. Retrieved 22 February 2014.
Reporting on political corruption and security issues has proved to be particularly sensitive. On 24 October 2012 police in Bauchi State arraigned civil servant Abbas Ahmed Faggo before a court for allegedly defaming the character of Governor Isa Yuguda after he posted messages on his Facebook account accusing the governor of spending public funds on his son's wedding. On 4 November, the court discharged Faggo, but media reported the state government fired him later that month.
During 2012 several Internet news sites critical of the government experienced server problems, which site owners attributed to government interference. Such disruptions usually lasted a few hours.
In 2008 two journalists were arrested for publishing online articles and photos critical of the government."Second online journalist arrested in one week", Reporters Without Borders, 4 November 2008.
