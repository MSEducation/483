==2007 investigation==

Although the case was dismissed and Seigler was innocent, in May 2007, a Las Vegas news affiliate learned that Seigler was under investigation in connection to a prostitution ring operating in the city. He was released from the Pittsburgh Steelers. Seigler surrendered himself to Pittsburgh police and U.S. Marshals and was accused of pandering and providing transportation for a prostitute.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.8newsnow.com/story/7993581/prostitution-charges-dismissed-for-former-nfl-player-in-las-vegas?redirected=true |title= Charges Dismissed for NFL Linebacker Seigler |accessdate=2008-03-11[/tpl] All charges were dismissed in March 2008, and he expressed a desire to play in the NFL again. The Steelers did not reacquire Seigler after all charges were dropped. Seigler then ventured to play in the CFL for the Toronto Argonauts and work his way back into the NFL. In 2010 Nigel Burton, Head Coach of the Portland State Vikings, offered Seigler a spot on the coaching staff. Burton told the Portland Tribune, "It’s unfortunate his name got dragged through the mud. I believe in second chances, but to be honest, this isn’t even a second chance for the guy. He is working hard. You can’t kick him out of the office. He wants to be a great coach. He and I are a lot alike in that regard. We love a challenge. You question me and my character, I’ll show you. You question my ability to coach, I’ll show you. That’s how he is. That’s why I love him, and I’m glad he is here."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/sports/story_2nd.php?story_id=128277018788354900 |title=Vikings Give Seigler a Shot at Coaching |accessdate= 2010-08-26[/tpl]
