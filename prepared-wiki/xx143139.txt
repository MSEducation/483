Antrim Grammar School is a grammar school in Northern Ireland. It is in County Antrim, in the North Eastern Education and Library Board (NEELB) area.

==History==

Antrim Grammar School was founded in 1974 to address the growing need of an increasing population in the Antrim area.

==Other==

The school was accredited as an International School by the British Council.http://www.globalgateway.org.uk/pdf/Full%202006.pdf Four schools in Northern Ireland were accredited in 2006; other NI schools had already been accredited over the previous several years. This award is presented to schools for their work in promoting international awareness among students and staff. Previously the school has won numerous awards including the CICA award in 1994.
The school regularly has Language Weeks where pupils from various cultures teach the rest of the pupils their chosen language. They also take many trips, including school visits to America, Iceland, Rome, Paris, Poland, Bolivia and South Africa. This work and its continuation helped to secure Antrim Grammar International School accreditation.

==Modernisation==

In September 2001, after several years of planning and preparation, a Â£7.5 million refurbishment and rebuilding programme commenced at Antrim Grammar School. The programme was completed in January 2004. There were several phases to the work undertaken by the NEELB, McCombe Brothers, Samuel Stevenson & Sons; and Williams & Shaw. After completion, every department now has access to Interactive whiteboards and Information Technology cluster areas.
The school now has a new multi-purpose Learning Resource Centre, with its computing and library facilities. The school also received a new lecture theatre.
