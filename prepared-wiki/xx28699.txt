[[Citation signal]]

CATEGORIES: Bibliography

Introductory signals are used in legal citations to present authorities and show how the authorities relate to propositions in textual statements. Legal writers use introductory signals to tell readers how their citations to legal authority support, or do not support, their written propositions. Introductory signals organize the writer's citations into a hierarchy of strength and importance so that the reader can quickly determine the relative weight of the citation. For example, the introductory signal "See" tells the reader that the cited authority either (a) supports the stated proposition implicitly, or (b) contains dicta that support the proposition.  "But see," on the other hand, tells the reader that the cited authority either (a) contradicts the stated proposition implicitly, or (b) contains dicta that contradict the stated proposition. 
Introductory signals have different meanings in different U.S. citation style systems. The two most prominent citation manuals are The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legalbluebook.com/ |title=The Bluebook |publisher=Legalbluebook.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-19[/tpl] and the ALWD Citation Manual.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alwd.org/cm/ |title=Index of /cm |publisher=Alwd.org |date=2008-07-28 |accessdate=2011-01-19[/tpl] Some state-specific style manuals also provide guidance on legal citation.  The Bluebook citation system is both the most comprehensive and most widely used system by courts, law firms, and law reviews. Here are examples, with explanations, of the introductory signals used in legal writing under the Bluebook system:

==Signals that indicate support==

===signal===

===e.g.===

===Accord===

===See===

===See also===

===Cf.===

==Signals that indicate background material==

===See generally===

==Signals that indicate contradiction==

===Contra===

===But see===

===But cf.===

==Signals that indicate a useful comparison==

===Compare _ with ___===

==Using signals as verbs==

In footnotes, signals may function as verbs in textual sentences.  This allows material that would otherwise be included in a parenthetical explanation to be more cohesively integrated.  When used in this manner, signals should not be italicized.
"Cf." becomes "compare" and "e.g." becomes "for example" when these signals are used as verbs.

==Signal formatting==

===Capitalizing Signals===

===Signal Placement and Typeface===

==Order of signals==

(See The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citationhttp://www.legalbluebook.com/)
When one or more signals are used, the signals should appear in the following order:
      1. [no signal]
      2. e.g.,
      3. Accord
      4. See
      5. See also
      6. Cf.
      7. Compare...[and]...with...and...
      8. Contra
      9. But see
      10. But cf.
      11. See generally
When multiple signals are used, the signals must be consistent with the proper order of authorities.  Also, signals of the same basic type - supportive, comparative, contradictory, or background - are strung together within a single citation sentence and separated by semicolons.  Signals of different types should be grouped in different citation sentences. For example:
"See Mass. Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307 (1976) (per curiam); cf. Palmer v. Ticcione, 433 F.Supp. 653 (E.D.N.Y 1977) (upholding a mandatory retirement age for kindergarten teachers). But see Gault v. Garrison, 569 F.2d 993 (7th Cir. 1977) (holding that a classification of public school teachers based on age violated equal protection absent a showing of justifiable and rational state purpose). See generally Comment, O’Neill v. Baine: Application of Middle-Level Scrutiny to Old-Age Classifications, 127 U. Pa. L. Rev. 798 (1979) (advocating a new constitutional approach to old-age classifications)."
When "e.g." is combined with another signal, the placement of the combined signal is determined by the non-e.g. signal.  For example, the combined signal "see, e.g." should be placed where the "see" signal would normally fall.  
However, within a citation clause citation strings can contain different types of signals.  These signals are separated by semicolons.

==Order of authorities within each signal==

(See The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation http://www.legalbluebook.com/)
Authorities within each signal are separated by semicolons.
If one authority is considerably more helpful or authoritative than the others cited within a signal, it should precede others.  Except in this situation, cite authorities in the order in which they are listed below:
(a) Constitutions and other foundational documents.  Cite in the following order:
1. federal
2. state (alphabetically by state)
3. foreign (alphabetically by jurisdiction)
4. foundational documents of the United Nations, the League of Nations, and the European Union (in that order). Constitutions of the same jurisdiction are cited in reverse chronological order.
(b) Statutes. Cite statutes in the following order, according to the jurisdictional hierarchy below: federal, state, foreign, and international.
1. Federal: (i) statutes in U.S.C., U.S.C.A., or U.S.C.S.; (ii) other statutes currently in force, by reverse chronological order of enactment; (iii) rules of evidence and procedure; (iv) repealed statutes, by reverse chronological order of enactment.
2. State (alphabetically by state): (i) statutes in the current codification (by order in the codification); (ii) statutes currently in force but not in the current codification (by order in the codification); (iii) rules of evidence and procedure; (iv) repealed statutes (by reverse chronological order of enactment).
3. Foreign (alphabetically by jurisdiction): (i) codes or statutes in the current codification (by order in the codification); (ii) statutes currently in force but not in the current codification (by reverse chronological order of enactment; (iii) repealed statutes (by reverse chronological order of enactment. 
(c) Treaties and other international agreements (other than the foundational documents of the UN, League of Nations, and the EU): cite in reverse chronological order
(d) Cases. Arrange within a signal according to the courts that issued the cited opinions; cases decided by the same court are arranged in reverse chronological order (for this purpose all U.S. circuit courts of appeals are treated as one court, and all federal district courts are treated as one court).  
Cite cases in the following order, according to the jurisdictional hierarchy below: federal, state, foreign, and international.
1. Federal: 
(i) Supreme Court
(ii) court of appeals, Emergency Court of Appeals, and Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals
(iii) Court of Claims, Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and bankruptcy appeals panels
(iv) district courts, Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, and Court of International Trade (v) district bankruptcy courts and Railroad Reorganization Court
(vi) Court of Federal Claims, Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and Tax Court
(vii) administrative agencies (alphabetically by agency).
2. State: (i) courts (alphabetically by state and then by rank within each state; (ii) agencies (alphabetically by state and then alphabetically by agency within each state). 
3. Foreign: (i) courts (alphabetically by jurisdiction and then by rank within each jurisdiction); (ii) agencies (alphabetically by jurisdiction and then alphabetically by agency within each jurisdiction. 
4. International: (i) International Court of Justice, Permanent Court of International Justice; (ii) other international tribunals and arbitral panels (alphabetically by name). 
(e) Legislative materials: cite in the following order: bills and resolutions, committee hearings, reports, documents,and committee prints, floor debates. Cite in reverse chronological order. 
(f) Administrative and executive materials: cite in the following order: federal(Executive Orders, current Treasury Regulations, other regulations in force, proposed rules not in force, repealed materials), state (alphabetically by state), foreign (alphabetically by jurisdiction).
(g) Resolutions, decisions, and regulations of intergovernmental organizations: cite in the following order: UN and League of Nations (General Assembly, then Security Council, then other organs in alphabetical order), other organizations (alphabetically by name of organization).
(h) Records, briefs, and petitions: cited in that order.
(i) Secondary materials: cite in the following order: uniform codes, model codes, and restatements (in reverse chronological order by category), books and pamphlets, works in journals, books reviews not written by students, student-written law review materials, annotations, magazine and newspaper articles, working papers, unpublished materials not forthcoming, electronic sources, including Internet sources. For all secondary sources except codes and restatements, cite alphabetically by last name of author; if none, by first word of title). 
(j) Cross-references to the author's own material in text or footnotes
For example:
See Arnold v. Runnels, 421 F.3d 859, 866 n. 8 (9th Cir.2005); United States v. Soliz, 129 F.3d 499, 504 n. 3 (1997), overruled on other grounds by United States v. Johnson, 256 F.3d 895 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc) (per curiam); Evans v. Demosthenes, 98 F.3d 1174, 1176 (9th Cir.1996).

==Parenthetical information==

Use parentheticals, as need, to explain the relevance of a particular authority to the proposition given in the text. Parenthetical information is recommended when the relevance if a cited authority might not otherwise be clear to the reader. Explanatory information takes the form of a present participle phrase, a quoted sentence, or a short statement that is appropriate in context
===Phrases not quoting the authority=== 
Explanatory parenthetical phrases not directly quoting the authority usually begin with a present participle and should never begin with a capital letter:
Such standards have been adopted to address a variety of environmental problems. See, e.g., H.B. Jacobini, The New International Sanitary Regulations, 46 Am. J. INT'L L. 727, 727-28(1952) (health-related water quality); Robert L. Meyer, Travaux Preparatoires for the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, 2 EARTH L.J. 45, 45-81 (1976( (conservation of protected areas). 
===Phrases quoting the authority=== 
If the parenthetical quotes one or more full sentences, then the parenthetical should begin with a capital letter and end with punctuation. Example:

===How do I determine whether my argument needs a parenthetical?===

1. If your source directly quotes or supports your argument (meaning you either used no signal or "see" in front of your citation) then you probably do not need a parenthetical.
2. Do you have multiple arguments or points occurring in that portion of the text? If yes, then parentheticals may clarify how those sources individually contribute to the argument.
3. Are you citing to a broad or dense source? If yes, then a parenthetical that points to the correct and specific information might be helpful.

===Order Within a Citation===

If the case you are citing has some subsequent history or other related authority that needs to be included, it should come after your parenthetical. Example:

===Be careful of...===

1. Vague or broad parentheticals that do not add any additional value - the reader would not know anything more or less if it was not there. For example, "addresses tort reform."

==Internal cross-references==

Portions of text, footnotes, and groups of authorities within the piece may be cited using supra or infra. Use supra to refer back to material that has already appeared within the piece. Use infra to refer to material that appears later in the piece. "Note" and "Part" are used to refer to footnotes and parts (when parts are specifically designed) within the same piece; "p." and "pp." are used to refer to other pages within the same piece. The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation (Columbia Law Review Ass'n et al. eds., 18th ed. 2005).
However, avoid heavy usage of infra, supra, op. cit, loc. cit, and similar abbreviations that refer to citations that appear elsewhere in the writing.  These forms burden readers by forcing them to hunt for the full citation elsewhere in the work. Generally, these abbreviations should be used sparingly and only (1) to avoid repeating a lengthy footnote and/or, (2) to cross-reference a nearby footnote.
A list of internal cross-reference forms. 

==Supra==

Supra (Bluebook Rules 3.5 & 4.2 )
Example: 
GINSBURG, supra note 43, at 1485 (citing Gershwin Publ'g Corp. v. Columbia Artists Mgmt., 443 F.2d 1159, 1162 (2d Cir. 1971)).

==Infra==

Infra (Bluebook Rule 3.5)
Example: 
Nevertheless, the cases holding that the server's behavior constitutes "distribution" seem justifiable. See infra note 76 and accompanying text.

==Compare ALWD 10 (3d) and Bluebook 3.5 (18th)==

The rules are very similar, but under the Bluebook, spell out “note” or “Part”:
