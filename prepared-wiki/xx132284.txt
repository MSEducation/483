[[FATA (hard drive)]]

CATEGORIES: Hard disk computer storage

The FATA or FC-ATA is a type of computer hard disk drive. FATA is simply the low cost ATA or SATA disk drive equipped with a small external converter, that changes the interface to Fibre Channel (FC). This allows users to use the disk in the enterprise-class disk enclosure, at about half of the cost of a native FC drive (cost per gigabyte of capacity).
