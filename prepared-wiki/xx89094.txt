Ralph Wilson Stadium (originally Rich Stadium) is an outdoor football stadium in the northeastern United States, located in Orchard Park, New York, a suburb south of Buffalo. Opened in 1973, it is the home for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League. The stadium was renamed in 1998 for team founder and then-owner Ralph Wilson.

==History==

An original franchise of the American Football League in 1960, the Buffalo Bills played their first thirteen seasons at War Memorial Stadium, a minor league baseball park in downtown Buffalo. While suitable for AFL play in the 1960s, the "Rockpile" (as the stadium came to be nicknamed), was both in disrepair and, with a capacity of under 47,000, deemed undersized for a National Football League team. The league mandate instituted after the NFL-AFL merger of 1970 dictated a minimum of 50,000 seats.
Rich Stadium opened in 1973,CitySearch - Ralph Wilson Stadium but in early 1971, Wilson was exploring options to relocate the team, possibly to Seattle,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gDMsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xMsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2588%2C1883967|newspaper=Spartanburg (SC) Herald |agency=Associated Press |title=Bills may move team to Seattle |date=January 13, 1971|page=10[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2706&dat=19710113&id=fwRKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Yh4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=3077,368483|agency=Michigan Daily|agency=Associated Press |title=Bills consider transfer|date=Jan 13, 1971 |page=9[/tpl] which hastened the stadium project.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&dat=19710118&id=0ptOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uQkEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3677,2960010|newspaper=Wilmington (NC) Star-News|agency=UPI |title=Buffalo making efforts to retain grid franchise |date=January 20, 1971 |page=12 [/tpl] Other cities such as Memphis and Tampa soon expressed interest.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19710115&id=ezMsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xMsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4930,2267693|newspaper=Spartanburg (SC) Herald |title=Memphis, Tampa express interest in Buffalo Bills |agency=Associated Press |date=January 15, 1971 |page=14 [/tpl] The location and construction of the stadium in Erie County were the source of years of litigation,[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19710120&id=tAMqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cygEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6482,4624665|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal|agency=press dispatches |title=Domed stadium out at Buffalo|date=January 20, 1971 |page=18 [/tpl] which ended with a financial settlement for a developer who had planned to erect a domed stadium in Lancaster.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19710121&id=eTMsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xMsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7405,3254318|newspaper=Spartanburg (SC) Herald |agency=Associated Press |title=Buffalo scraps stadium plans |date=January 21, 1971 |page=36[/tpl] However, plans changed because it was not wanted to be close to Lancaster High School.Stadium History The stadium was ultimately built by Frank Schoenle and his construction company.

===Seating capacity===

===Other sporting events===

The size of the field at Ralph Wilson Stadium is specifically designed for National Football League dimensions and sightlines, making it extremely difficult for other outdoor sporting events such as soccer, baseball, track and field, or rugby to be held there. None of any significance have ever been held at the stadium.
On January 1, 2008, the Buffalo Sabres hosted the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2008 NHL Winter Classic.2008 Winter Classic The Penguins won 2–1 in a shootout in front of more than 71,000 people.
The stadium annually hosts the region's Section VI and Monsignor Martin Athletic Association high school football playoffs.Bills to Host High School Football Playoff Game at Ralph Wilson Stadium The stadium rarely hosts college football games; the stadium hosted a Black Friday contest between the UB Bulls and the Bowling Green Falcons in 2013, but before that, the last college football game at the stadium had been in 1979, when the Syracuse Orange football team used the stadium as a temporary venue while the Carrier Dome was under construction.http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=333332084.

Adjacent to the stadium is 1,800-seat Jim Ball Field, the home field for Erie Community College's football team.
On July 14, 1984, the stadium hosted a one-time-only supercross motorcycle racing event.

===Concerts===

Occasional concerts that had high demand were prominently held at the stadium during the 1970s through 2001. 
Some bands have played the stadium multiple times. This would be The Rolling Stones who played here in 1975, 1978, 1981, and 1997.  The Grateful Dead played the stadium a few times in the 80's and early 90's with their July 4, 1989 Truckin' Up to Buffalo performance being documented on CD/DVD. The Who, Dave Matthews and the Jackson Five have all played at the stadium multiple times as well.
Double and multi-billed concerts have also been scheduled at the stadium. The stadium held The Monsters of Rock Festival, featuring Van Halen, Scorpions, Dokken, Metallica and Kingdom Come, on June 19, 1988. Metallica and Guns N' Roses brought the Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour to the stadium on July 25, 1992, with Faith No More as their opening act.
There were notable large concerts that were scheduled to take place at the stadium but was later canceled. Led Zeppelin was set to perform at the stadium on their 1977 North American Tour. The concert was one of the 5 remaining concerts on the tour that were canceled due to the death of lead singer Robert Plant's son. The last concert that would have played at the stadium was a Bruce Springsteen concert in 2003. That concert was canceled due to low ticket sales and moved to the smaller Darien Lake Performing Arts Center instead.
Concert appearances began to wane in the 1990s at the stadium. The last concert held at the stadium was on June 10, 2001, featuring 'N Sync, with Dream as their opening act. This was due to the availability of other venues in Western New York such as Art Park in Lewiston, New York, Darien Lake Performing Arts Center in Corfu, New York, the Thursday at the Square series among others, and First Niagara Center, which opened in 1996, replacing Buffalo Memorial Auditorium in downtown Buffalo.

===Non-sporting or music events===

The stadium has also hosted the Drum Corps International championships three times.

==Design==

The stadium is open-air, with a capacity of 73,079. The stadium has never had a natural grass surface; AstroTurf was installed in the stadium upon its opening in 1973. In the 2003 offseason the original style turf was replaced with a newer AstroTurf product, AstroTurf GameDay Grass (also known as AstroPlay). In 2011, the Bills announced they would be changing their turf to a new product, A-Turf Titan, produced by a Western New York company, beginning in the 2011 season. Buffalo will be the only NFL stadium using the A-Turf Titan product.Glynn, Matt (May 8, 2011). Local Firm Hopes to Score Points With Bills' New Field. The Buffalo News. Retrieved May 9, 2011.
The stadium originally had a capacity of 80,020; however, the capacity was reduced in 1998 as a part of the Bills lease renewal with Erie County, New York. The stadium at that time was refitted with larger seats and more luxury and club seating. The lease agreement also stipulated that Erie County would continue to upgrade the stadium; in summer 2007 a new High Definition Mitsubishi LED board measuring [tpl]convert|88.8|by|32.5|ft[/tpl] and ribbon boards were installed. Total cost for the project was $5.2 million. The new scoreboard replaced the old [tpl]convert|41.5|by|31.5|ft[/tpl] Sony JumboTron installed 13 years earlier for $8 million (inflation adjusted).
Buffalo, by virtue of its position downwind of Lake Erie, is one of the nation's windiest cities, and as a result, Ralph Wilson Stadium often is a difficult stadium for kickers, with swirling winds that change direction rapidly. This is exacerbated by the design of the stadium. The field is [tpl]convert|50|ft|m[/tpl] below ground level, while the top of the upper deck stands only sixty feet above ground.  The open end lies parallel to the direction of the prevailing winds, so that when the winds come in, they immediately drop down into the bowl, causing the stadium's signature wind patterns.

==Future==

===Lease negotiations===

The Bills' lease on Ralph Wilson Stadium was to expire on July 31, 2013. 
One of the conditions the Bills have insisted on receiving in return for the team renewing the lease is a large package of renovations, costing a minimum of US$200,000,000.Gaughan, Mark and Denise Jewell Gee (April 15, 2012). What's the Bills' game plan? Significant outlay of public dollars will be needed for upgrades to nearly 40-year-old stadium. The Buffalo News. Retrieved April 15, 2012. In order to offset that, the Bills planned on participating in a league financing program that partially subsidizes the cost of stadium construction and renovation; the team, however, missed a key deadline to receive league funding for renovations to begin. A dome stadium could be in the works when the lease to Ralph Wilson Stadium is completed.
A new 10 year lease agreement was reached by the parties which called for $130 million in upgrades to the stadium.  The deal stipulates a one-time $28.4 million option to buy out the final three years of the lease after the 2019 season.[tpl]citeweb|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nascar/blog/nfl-rapidreports/21436805/bills-what-does-lease-agreement-mean-for-long-term-future|title=Bills: What does lease agreement mean for long-term future?|first=Mark|last=Ludwiczak |date=2012-12-21|accessdate=2014-01-12|publisher=CBS Sports[/tpl] There have been conflicting reports on how to break the lease before that; initial reports had a punitive $400 million buyout option if a prospective owner were to want to move the team early; later reports after Ralph Wilson's death suggested there was no such buyout and that the lease could only be broken by mutual agreement before 2019.Kryk, John (March 26, 2014). Bills cannot be relocated before 2020: the long-reported $400M buyout option does not exist. Sun Media. Retrieved March 26, 2014.

===2013-2015 renovations===

On January 17, 2013, the Bills revealed the new entrance plaza, sports store, expanded concessions and extra media board designs, created by Populous to the media.

===New stadium proposals/relocation===

After the Bills signed their December 2012 lease, they agreed to form a committee to explore the possibility of a new stadium, preferably in downtown Buffalo. This has opened the possibility of new stadium proposals for the Bills.

====Waterfront stadium proposal====

On October 23, 2012, George Hasiotis and Nicholas Stracick of Greater Buffalo Sports and Entertainment Complex, a Delaware-based LLC, presented a rendered plan created by architect firm HKS, Inc. to the Buffalo Common Council. The plan included a $1.4 billion, seventy-two thousand seat retractable roof stadium, convention center, hotel and sports museum plan for the Buffalo Outer Harbor.[tpl]cite news|last=Sommer|first=Mark|title=Retractable-roof stadium proposed for outer harbor|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121022/CITYANDREGION/121029746/1109|accessdate=27 October 2012|newspaper=The Buffalo News|date=October 23, 2012[/tpl] At first this plan was met with some cynicism, in particular because of the feasibility of the project. The request of these plans were never proposed by anyone from the County or the Buffalo Bills organization,nor had they publicly asked for designs of any kind. Meanwhile more rumors circulate regarding Howard Milstein, the Manhattan real estate developer with close ties to Gov. Cuomo. Milstein owns more than 140 acres of prime land adjacent to Niagara Falls, and could be a major player as this location would make sense to attract Canadian fans having a closer proximity to Toronto.
On December 11, the company met with local AFL-CIO members to discuss the amount of jobs created by the proposed project, which was said to be 10,000. Stracick also disclosed that there are "15 private, secret sponsors" willing to fund the project. He also stated that no tax money would be used to fund a stadium. The meeting comes a week before the land is sold by the NFTA to the City of Buffalo or the Erie County Harbor Development Corporation.[tpl]cite web|last=Martinez|first=Natalia|title=Pitch to Union for New Bills Stadium|url=http://buffalo.ynn.com/content/top_stories/621033/pitch-to-union-for-new-bills-stadium/|accessdate=17 January 2013[/tpl] 
In January 2013, the group met with Erie County legislators, their second major appearance since October. During this meeting, the idea of having the Strong Foundation open a sports museum on the $1.8 billion premises was also strengthened.[tpl]cite web|last=Raguse|first=Lou|title=Businessmen push for downtown stadium|url=http://www.wivb.com/dpp/news/local/businessmen-push-for-downtown-stadium|accessdate=17 January 2013[/tpl]
