Land Rover is a brand of the British car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover, which specialises in four-wheel-drive vehicles.[tpl]cite web|title=Jaguar Land Rover 2012 Overview|url=http://www.jaguarlandrover.com/pdf/Investor_Presentation_FY2012_Overview.pdf|publisher=Jaguar Land Rover|date=14 June 2012[/tpl] Jaguar Land Rover, with its headquarters in Whitley, Coventry, was acquired by Tata Motors in 2008.[tpl]cite web|title=Joint Venture, Subsidiary and Associate Companies: Jaguar Land Rover|url=http://www.tatamotors.com/know-us/associates.php |publisher=Tata Motors|accessdate=2012-02-14[/tpl]
Land Rover is the second oldest four-wheel-drive car brand in the world (after Jeep).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/car-reviews/jeep/patriot|title=Car Reviews – Road test – Jeep Patriot |accessdate=2 October 2010|publisher=Exchange and Mart|date=October 2007 |accessdate=2012-02-14[/tpl]
The Land Rover name was originally used by the Rover Company for one specific vehicle model, named simply the Land Rover, launched by Rover in 1948. Over the following years it developed into a marque encompassing a range of four-wheel-drive models, including the Defender, Discovery, Freelander, Range Rover, Range Rover Sport and Range Rover Evoque. Land Rovers are currently assembled in the company's Halewood and Solihull plants, with research and development taking place at JLR's Gaydon and Whitley engineering centres. Land Rover sold 194,000 vehicles worldwide in 2009.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/booming-sales-at-jaguar-land-rover-boost-tata-motors-profits-2049056.html|title=Booming sales at Jaguar Land Rover boost Tata Motors profits|accessdate=2 October 2010|newspaper=The Independent |first=Sarah |last=Arnott |date=11 August 2010[/tpl]
Although the brand originates from the original 1948 model, Land Rover as a company has only existed since 1978. Prior to this, it was a product line of the Rover Company which was subsequently absorbed into the Rover-Triumph division of the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BL) following Leyland Motor Corporation’s takeover of Rover in 1967. The ongoing commercial success of the original Land Rover series models, and latterly the Range Rover in the 1970s in the midst of BL's well-documented business troubles prompted the establishment of a separate Land Rover company but still under the BL umbrella, remaining part of the subsequent Rover Group in 1988, under the ownership of British Aerospace after the remains of British Leyland were broken up and privatised. In 1994 Rover Group plc was acquired by BMW. In 2000, Rover Group was broken up by BMW and Land Rover was sold to Ford Motor Company, becoming part of its Premier Automotive Group. 
In 2006 Ford purchased the Rover brand from BMW for around £6 million. This reunited the Rover and Land Rover brands for the first time since 2000 when the Rover group was broken up by BMW.
In June 2008, Ford sold both Land Rover and Jaguar Cars to the Indian Tata Motors. This sale also included the dormant Rover brand.[tpl]cite press release |title= Ford Motor Company Announces Agreement to Sell Jaguar Land Rover to Tata Motors|publisher=Ford Motor Company |date=26 March 2008 |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=27953 |accessdate=2012-02-14[/tpl][tpl]cite press release |title=Tata Motors enters into Definitive Agreement with Ford for purchase of Jaguar Land Rover |publisher=Tata Motors |date=26 March 2008 |url=http://tata.com/article.aspx?artid=y7LY/HD0TiM= |accessdate=2012-02-14[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Tata Motors completes acquisition of Jag, Land Rover |date=2 June 2008 |publisher=Thomson Reuters |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSBMA00084220080602 |accessdate=2008-06-02[/tpl]

==History==

The design for the original Land Rover vehicle was started in 1947 by Maurice Wilks, chief designer at the Rover Company, on his farm in Newborough, Anglesey.[tpl]cite news |title=Land Rover: The sands of time |first=Kevin |last=Hackett |date=28 March 2008 |newspaper=The Telegraph |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/2751397/Land-Rover-The-sands-of-time.html |accessdate=2011-06-30[/tpl] It is said that he was inspired by an American World War II Jeep that he used one summer at his holiday home in Wales.[tpl]cite book|quote=The first Land-Rover owed a lot to the Jeep. Designer Gordon Bashford, who laid out the basic concept, makes no secret of that. It was also his job to go off to an ex-WD surplus vehicle dump in the Cotswolds, buy a couple of roadworthy Jeeps... |title=The Rover Story |first=Graham |last=Robson |year=1981 |page=87 |publisher=Stephens |isbn=978-0-85059-543-7 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I3zhmz_eOyAC&pg=PA137&dq=Land+Rover+inspired+by+Jeep|title=Trucks & Off-Road Vehicles |first=Richard |last=Gunn |page=137 |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7603-2569-8 |accessdate=2011-08-05[/tpl] The first Land Rover prototype, later nicknamed 'Centre Steer', was built on a Jeep chassis and axles.[tpl]cite book|url= http://books.google.com/books?id=Y5qVKiNkvAcC&pg=PA111&dq=First+Land+Rover+built+on+a+Jeep+chassis |page=111 |title=Illustrated Encyclopedia of Extraordinary Automobiles |first=Giles |last=Chapman |publisher=DK Publishing |year=2009 |isbn= 9780756649807 |accessdate=14 June 2012 [/tpl]
The early choice of colour was dictated by military surplus supplies of aircraft cockpit paint, so early vehicles only came in various shades of light green; all models until recently feature sturdy box section ladder-frame chassis.
The early vehicles, such as the Series I, were field-tested at Long Bennington and designed to be field-serviced; advertisements for Rovers cite vehicles driven thousands of miles on banana oil. Now with more complex service requirements this is less of an option. The British Army maintains the use of the mechanically simple 2.5-litre four-cylinder 300TDi-engined versions rather than the electronically controlled 2.5-litre five-cylinder TD5 to retain some servicing simplicity. This engine also continued in use in some export markets using units built at a Ford plant in Brazil, where Land Rovers were built under licence and the engine was also used in Ford pick-up trucks built locally. Production of the TDi engine ended in the United Kingdom in 2006, meaning that Land Rover no longer offers it as an option. International Motors of Brazil offer an engine called the 2.8 TGV Power Torque, which is essentially a 2.8-litre version of the 300TDi, with a corresponding increase in power and torque.
During its ownership by Ford, Land Rover was once again associated with Jaguar – the first time the two companies had been under the same ownership since the British Leyland era. In many countries they shared a common sales and distribution network (including shared dealerships), and some models shared components and production facilities.

===Sale to Tata===

In June 2007, Ford Motor Company announced its plan to sell Land Rover, along with Jaguar. Ford retained the services of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and HSBC to advise it on the details of the deal. The buyer was initially expected to be announced by September 2007, but the sale was delayed and an announcement was not made until March 2008. A UK-based private equity firm, Alchemy Partners, and the India-headquartered Tata Motors and Mahindra and Mahindra expressed interest in purchasing Jaguar and Land Rover from the Ford Motor Company.[tpl]cite news |title=Tata confirms interest in buying Ford Motor's Land Rover and Jaguar brands |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/24/business/worldbusiness/24iht-tata.4.7246745.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=24 August 2007 |accessdate=2012-02-14 [/tpl]CNN[tpl]dead link|date=February 2012[/tpl] India's Tata eyeing Jaguar and Land Rover

In March 2008, Ford announced that it had agreed to sell its Jaguar and Land Rover operations to Tata Motors, and that the sale was expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2008. On 2 June 2008, the sale to Tata Motors was completed by both parties. Included in the deal were the rights to three other British brands: Jaguar's own Daimler marque, as well as two dormant brands Lanchester and Rover.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.leftlanenews.com/5-for-2-special-tata-acquires-3-other-british-marques-in-jaguar-land-rover-deal.html#more-6922 | title = 5 for 2 special: Tata acquires 3 other British marques in Jaguar, Land Rover deal | publisher = Leftlane News | date = 28 March 2008 | accessdate = 2008-03-28[/tpl] BMW and Ford had previously retained ownership of the Rover brand to protect the integrity of the Land Rover brand, with which 'Rover' might be confused in the US 4x4 market; the Rover brand was originally used under licence by MG Rover until it collapsed in 2005, at which point it was re-acquired by the then Ford Motor Company owned Land Rover Limited.

===Timeline===

==Manufacturing==

Land Rovers were manufactured primarily at the Solihull plant, near Birmingham, but production of the Freelander was moved to the Halewood Body & Assembly plant near Liverpool, a former Ford car plant. The Freelander is also assembled in knock-down kit (CKD) form at Land Rover's facility in Pune, India.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.landrover.com/me/en/lr/about-land-rover/corporate-news/new-plant-in-pune/ |title=Corporate News: Our new plant in Pune |quote=On 27th May, 2011 Land Rover officially opened its first assembly plant in India.

Defender models are assembled under licence in several locations worldwide, including Spain (Santana Motors), Iran (Pazhan Morattab), Brazil (Karmann) and Turkey (Otokar).geocites.com guide to Land Rover[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2012[/tpl]
The former BL/Rover Group technical centre at Gaydon in Warwickshire is home to the corporate and R&D headquarters.
In May 2010, Tata Motors announced that it plans to build Land Rover and Jaguar models in Mainland China (PRC) as the company seeks to cut costs and expand sales.[tpl]cite news|last=Rothwell|first=Steven|title=Tata Motors Plans to Build Jaguar, Land Rover Models in China|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-05-28/tata-motors-plans-to-build-jaguar-land-rover-models-in-china.html|accessdate=27 July 2010|newspaper=Business Week|date=28 May 21010|first2=Vipin V. |last2=Nair[/tpl]
Currently Tata Motors are working on having all aluminium body constructions on all Land Rover vehicles. The Defender replacement is due for 2015, that too is expected to have an aluminium body, but it may be based off the Discovery Platforms.

==Concepts==

Range Stormer – Land Rover's first concept vehicle, unveiled at the 2004 North American International Auto Show, later became the Range Rover Sport.(Gritzinger, 2004).
Land Rover LRX – Land Rover's second concept vehicle, first unveiled at the 2008 Detroit Auto Show. Originally a vehicle with ERAD technology, the production version did not include this. The car was then launched in 2011 as the Range Rover Evoque, and was the first Range Rover branded product to be offered with front wheel drive, and no low ratio transfer box.
Land Rover DC100 – Land Rover's third concept vehicle, first unveiled at the 2011 Frankfurt Auto Show, designed to be a replacement for the Land Rover Defender, though it is unlikely that the Defender's replacement will be exactly the same as the DC100 concept.
Land Rover Discovery Vision Concept – Land Rover's Forth concept vehicle, first unveiled at the 2014 , designed to be a replacement for the Land Rover Discovery models, This concept features Transparent Bonnet, Suicide doors,Laser assisted lamps although, there is a very little chance, this can be seen in the standard production vehicle.

===Military===

Models developed for the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) include:
Models developed for the Australian Army

===Engines===

During the history of the Land Rover many different engines have been fitted:

==Electric vehicles==

Integrated Electric Rear Axle Drive (ERAD) technology, dubbed e-terrain technology,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9080722.009/land-rover-announces-diesel-erad-hybrid--e_terrain-technologies |first=Viknesh |last=Vijayenthiran |title=Land Rover Announces Diesel ERAD Hybrid & e_Terrain Technologies |publisher=Worldcarfans |date=22 July 2008 |accessdate=10 March 2011[/tpl] will allow the vehicle to move off without starting the engine as well as supplying extra power over tough terrain. Land Rover's Diesel ERAD Hybrid was developed as part of a multi-million-pound project supported by the UK Government's Energy Saving Trust, under the low carbon research and development programme. ERAD programme is one of a broad range of sustainability-focused engineering programmes that Land Rover is pursuing, brought together by the company under the collective name "e TERRAIN Technologies".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roversnorth.com/weblog/?p=42|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081225014143/http://www.roversnorth.com/weblog/?p=42|archivedate=25 December 2008 |title=Factory News |publisher=Roversnorth.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-19[/tpl]
Land Rover presented at the 2008 London Motor Show its new ERAD diesel-electric hybrid in a pair of Freelander 2 (LR2) prototypes. The new hybrid system is being designed as a scalable and modular system that could be applied across a variety of Land Rover models and powertrains.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/land-rover-presents-erad-diesel-hybrid-prototypes.html |title=Land Rover presents ERAD diesel-hybrid prototypes |publisher=MotorAuthority |date=22 July 2008 |accessdate=2009-06-19[/tpl]

In September 2011, the Range Rover Evoque was launched, though it was based on the LRX hybrid concept presented at the 2008 North American Auto Show, it did not include the ERAD system, included in the original concept.
In February 2013, Land Rover unveiled[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.landrover.com/au/en/lr/about-land-rover/news-overview/electric-defender/ |title=Land Rover Unveils Electric Defender Research Vehicle |publisher=Land Rover Australia| date=28 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.salon-auto.ch/en/premieres/land-rover-defender-110-sw-se-land-rover-0-29478 |title=Land Rover Defender 110 SW SE |publisher=Geneva Motor Show 2013[/tpl] at the 83rd Geneva Motor Show an All-Terrain Electric Defender that produces zero emissions. The electric vehicle was developed for research purposes following successful trials of the Defender-based electric vehicle, Leopard 1. The vehicle is capable of producing 70kW and 330Nm of torque and has a range of 80 kilometres or in low speed off-road use it can last for up to eight hours before recharging.

==Abilities==

Power take-off (PTO) was integral to the Land Rover concept from 1948, enabling farm machinery and many other items to be run with the vehicle stationary. Maurice Wilks' original instruction was "...to have power take-offs everywhere!" The 1949 report by the British National Institute of Agricultural Engineering and Scottish Machinery Testing Station described "the power take-off is driven through a Hardy-Spicer propeller shaft from the main gearbox output and two interchangeable pinions giving two ratios. The PTO gearbox casing is bolted to the rear chassis cross-member and an [tpl]convert|8|x|8|in[/tpl] belt pulley driven from the PTO shaft through two bevel gears can be bolted to the PTO gearbox casing." PTOs remained regular options on Series I, II and III Land Rovers up to the demise of the Series Land Rover in 1985. An agricultural PTO on a Defender is possible as a special order.
Land Rover (the Series/Defender models) is that they are available in a variety of body styles, from a simple canvas-topped pick-up truck to a twelve-seat fully trimmed station wagon. Both Land Rover and out-of-house contractors have offered conversions and adaptations to the basic vehicle, such as fire engines, excavators, 'cherry picker' hydraulic platforms, ambulances, snowploughs, and six-wheel-drive versions, as well as one-off special builds including amphibious Land Rovers and vehicles fitted with tracks instead of wheels.

===Military use===

Various Land Rover models have been used in a military capacity, most notably by the British Army and Australian Army. Modifications may include military "blackout" lights, heavy-duty suspension, uprated brakes, 24 volt electrics, convoy lights, electronic suppression of the ignition system, blackout curtains and mounts for special equipment and small arms. Dedicated military models have been produced such as the 101 Forward Control and the air-portable 1/2 ton Lightweight. Military uses include light utility vehicle; communications platform; weapon platform for recoilless rifles, Anti-tank (e.g. TOW or M40 recoilless rifle) / Surface-to-Air Guided Weapons or machine guns; ambulances and workshops. The Discovery has also been used in small numbers, mostly as liaison vehicles.
Two models that have been designed for military use from the ground up are the 101 Forward Control from the early 1970s and the Lightweight or Airportable from the late 1960s. The latter was intended to be transported under a helicopter. The Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service (RAFMRS) teams were early users in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and their convoys of Land Rovers and larger military trucks are a sight often seen in the mountain areas of the United Kingdom. Originally RAFMRS Land Rovers had blue bodies and bright yellow tops, to be better seen from above. In 1981, the colour scheme was changed to green with yellow stripes. More recently, vehicles have been painted white, and are issued with fittings similar to civilian UK Mountain Rescue teams.
An adaptation of Land Rovers to military purposes is the "Pink Panther" models. Approximately 100 Series IIA models were adapted to reconnaissance use by the British special operations forces the SAS. For desert use they were often painted pink, hence the name. The vehicles were fitted with among other gear a sun compass, machine guns, larger fuel tanks and smoke dischargers. Similar adaptations were later made to Series IIIs and 90/110/Defenders.Bob Morrison: Land Rovers in military service, Brooklands Books 1993, ISBN 1-85520-205-0
The Australian Army adapted the Land Rover Series 2 into the Long Range Patrol Vehicle for use by the Special Air Service Regiment and as an anti-tank "gunbuggy" fitted with an M40 recoilless rifle.
The 75th Ranger Regiment of the United States Army also adapted twelve versions of the Land Rover that were officially designated the Ranger Special Operations Vehicle.
Series and Defender models have also been armoured. The most widespread of these is the Shorts Shorland, built by Shorts Brothers of Belfast. The first of these were delivered in 1965 to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Northern Ireland police force. They were originally [tpl]convert|109|in|mm|adj=on[/tpl] wheelbase models with an armoured body and a turret from the Ferret armoured car. By 1990, there had been more than 1,000 produced.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.shorlandsite.com |title=The Shorland Site |publisher=Clive Elliott |accessdate=2012-12-29[/tpl]
In the 1970s, a more conventional armoured Land Rover was built for the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Wales called the Hotspur. The Land Rover Tangi was built by the Royal Ulster Constabulary's own vehicle engineering team during the 1990s. The British Army has used various armoured Land Rovers, first in Northern Ireland but also in more recent campaigns. They first added protective panels to Series General Service vehicles (the Vehicle Protection Kit (VPK)). Later they procured the Glover Webb APV and finally the Courtaulds (later NP Aerospace) Composite Armoured Vehicle, commonly known as Snatch. These were originally based on heavy-duty V8 110 chassis but some have recently been re-mounted on new chassis from Otokar of Turkey and fitted with diesel engines and air-conditioning for Iraq. Although these now have more in common with the 'Wolf' (Defender XD) Land Rovers that many mistakenly confuse them with, the Snatch and the Wolf are different vehicles.
The most radical conversion of a Land Rover for military purposes was the Centaur halftrack. It was based on a Series III with a V8 engine and a shortened belt drive from the Alvis Scorpion light tank. A small number was manufactured, and they were used by Ghana, among others.
The Land Rover is used by military forces throughout the world. The current generation of Land Rover used by the British Army, the Snatch 2, have upgraded and strengthened chassis and suspension compared to civilian-specification vehicles. There is also the Land Rover WMIK (weapon mounted installation kit) used by the British Army. The WMIK consists of a driver, a raised gun, usually a Browning heavy machine gun or a grenade machine gun, this used for ground support, and a GPMG (general-purpose machine gunner) located next to the driver, this used for vehicle protection.

===Competitive use===

Highly modified Land Rovers have competed in the Dakar Rally and won the Macmillan 4x4 UK Challenge almost every year, as well as having been the vehicle used for the Camel Trophy. Now, Land Rover has its own G4 challenge.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.landroverg4challenge.com |title=Land Rover International – Latest News – Corporate News |publisher=Landroverg4challenge.com |date=11 March 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-19[/tpl]

==Driver training==

Land Rover Experience was established in 1990, and consists of a network of centres throughout the world, set up to help customers get the most out of their vehicles' on and off-road capability. The flagship centres are Land Rover's bases at Solihull, Eastnor, Gaydon and Halewood. Courses offered include off-road driving, winching and trailer handling, along with a variety of corporate and individual 'Adventure Days'. The factory centres at Solihull and Halewood have manufacturing tours, while Gaydon has an engineering tour.

==Safety==

Model-by-model road accident statistics from the UK Department for Transport show that the Land Rover Defender is one of the safest cars on British roads as measured by chance of death in two-car injury accidents.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/vehicles/carsmmrisk/carsmakeandmodeltheriskofdri1800 | title= Cars: make and model: the risk of driver injury in GB: 2000–2004 | publisher=Department for Transport | date= 12 October 2006 | accessdate= 28 July 2009| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080613172011/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/vehicles/carsmmrisk/carsmakeandmodeltheriskofdri1800| archivedate = 13 June 2008[/tpl]
The figures, which were based on data collected by police forces following accidents between 2000 and 2004 in Great Britain, showed that Defender drivers had a 1% chance of being killed or seriously injured and a 33% chance of sustaining any kind of injury. Other four-wheel-drive vehicles scored equally highly, and collectively these vehicles were much safer for their passengers than those in other classes such as passenger cars and MPVs. These figures reflect the fact that drivers of large mass vehicles are likely to be safer, often at the expense of other drivers if they collide with smaller cars.

==Clubs==

The original Land Rover Owners Club was set up by the Rover Company in 1954. The company published the Land Rover Owners Club Review magazine for members from 1957 to 1968 when the club became the Rover Owners Association. This original association fell away when the company merged with British Leyland.
There are many Land Rover clubs throughout the UK and internationally. Land Rover clubs break down into a number of groups of varying interests.
Single Marque Clubs – Bring together owners of a specific model or series of vehicle such as the Land Rover Series One Club,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lrsoc.com |title=Land Rover Series One Club website |publisher=lrsoc.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-03[/tpl] or the Discovery Owners Club.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.discoveryownersclub.org |title=Discovery Owners' Club website |publisher=Discoveryownersclub.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-15[/tpl] Clubs based on ownership of earlier series vehicles tend to attract the purists amongst Land Rover owners whose interests often relate to restoration of their vehicles to their original condition.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl]
Special Vehicle Clubs – At various times Land Rover have produced vehicles for specific events or on a specific theme, most notable are the Camel Trophy and G4 Challenge vehicles which have been sold on to the general public, and a range of Defenders that were loosely based on the custom vehicles produced for the Tomb Raider motion picture.
Regional Clubs break down into two groups, competitive and non-competitive. The non-competitive clubs activities generally relate to social events, off road driving or green laning on un-surfaced public highways or 'pay and play' days at off road centres. Competitive clubs are a phenomenon almost exclusively found within the UK, who as well as the non-competitive activities detailed above run competitive events such as Tyro, Road Taxed Vehicle (RTV) and Cross Country Vehicle (CCV) trials, winch and recovery challenges or speed events such as Competitive Safari's. All UK competitive events are run within the framework of rules created by the Motor Sports Association (MSA) with further vehicle specific rules applied by the host club or association.
A number of clubs are affiliated to the Association of Land Rover Clubs (ALRC),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.alrc.co.uk |title=Association of Land Rover Clubs website |publisher=Alrc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-07-15[/tpl] formerly known as the Association of Rover Clubs (ARC) the association applies its own vehicle regulations to all of its member clubs who have the opportunity to compete together at regional events and an annual national event with vehicles approved to the same standard.
In 2005, under Ford ownership, Land Rover became more interested in the club environment. An internal club was formed, The Land Rover Club,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.landroversclub.org |title=Land Rover Club website |publisher=Landroversclub.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-15[/tpl] exclusive to employees of Ford's Premier Automotive Group (Now exclusive to the new 'Jaguar – Land Rover' group since the brand moved away from the Ford stable). Also, an agreement was generated to allow other clubs to use the Land Rover green oval logo under licence. In 2006, the Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire club were the pilot licensees for the new agreement, who now benefit from a reciprocal arrangement where their own logo is trade marked[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tm/t-find/t-find-number?detailsrequested=C&trademark=2402968 |title=IPO UK |publisher=Ipo.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-07-15[/tpl] and owned by Land Rover and they can refer to themselves as a 'Land Rover Approved Club'.

==Brand extension==

===Bicycles===

In 1995, Land Rover endorsed the production of a hand-made bicycle using its logo. The bicycle was called the Land Rover APB and was manufactured by Pashley Cycles, of Stratford-upon-Avon, being the collapsible version of their Moulton designed APB (All Purpose Bicycle) model with leading link front suspension with adjustable damping and stroke. It was available in Golden Yellow with green lettering or British Racing Green with yellow lettering colour scheme.
Two more models immediately followed the Land Rover XCB V-20 and was aimed primarily at younger riders (children) and the Land Rover XCB D-26, also available as the M26 with hydraulic rim brakes, front suspension and suspension seat pillar.
In June 2004, Land Rover released a comprehensive 25 model range of bicycles to complement the automotive range. The three main ranges are the 'Defender', the 'Discovery', and the 'Freelander'. Each range has its different attributes. The 'Discovery' is an all-rounder bicycle and is suited to a mixture of different terrains. The 'Defender' range is most suited to rugged terrain and off road pursuits, whereas the 'Freelander' is designed for an urban lifestyle. All bikes are made from lightweight aluminium.

===Pushchairs===

Land Rover gave UK pram company Pegasus a licence to produce a three-wheeler range of Land Rover ATP pushchairs. The design reflected the heritage of the marque, with a light metal frame with canvas seating, held together with push-studs and tough simple parts like brakes and hinges. They could be collapsed completely flat, with wheels removed in seconds. The basic frame could be adapted with modules to allow a baby to lie flat or a bubble windscreen to completely enclose the child. The frame also came in long or short-handled versions, and could be repaired with home tools. The design was simple, light, and rugged and able to travel in all terrains (hence the ATP for all-terrain pushchair.) It came in three military looking colours: a light blue, a sand colour and olive drab. Production was discontinued in 2002.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.landroverpushchairs.co.uk/acatalog/index.html |title=Land Rover Pushchairs Online |publisher=Landroverpushchairs.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-07-15[/tpl]
