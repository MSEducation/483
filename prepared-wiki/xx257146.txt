Adamston, West Virginia is a former town in Harrison County, West Virginia, incorporated in 1903. It was the former site of a Baltimore & Ohio Railroad depot and a post office. It is now a neighborhood of Clarksburg, West Virginia.
It attained some national attention in 1912 when it elected a Socialist mayor and city government, some of whom were re-elected in 1915. Among the contributing factors in the victory, according to later analysis, were the strong involvement of the window glass factory workers, and the commitment of a large portion of the Belgian-American population of the town.Fones-Wolf, Ken Glass towns: industry, labor and political economy in Appalachia, 1890-1930s Champaign-Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2007; pp. 113-145
In 1917, Adamston, along with Broad Oaks, North View (where Progressives had had success) and Stealer Heights, was annexed to Clarksburg.State and municipal compendium, Volume 4. William B. Dana Company, 1931; p. 185 It was generally understood that part of the reason for annexation was to diminish the political power of glassworker enclaves in these small municipalities.
