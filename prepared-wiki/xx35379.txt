==Plot==

In the middle of the 19th century, a young couple, Kristina and Karl-Oskar, live in Småland - a province of southern Sweden. They survive on a small plot of infertile land. Times are difficult: there is bad weather, the harvests are poor, and hunger prevails. Hunger forces the couple's first-born child to secretly eat food that was not ready to be eaten. Their child dies as a result, and her death convinces Kristina to agree to Karl-Oskar's desire to emigrate to the US. They are joined by Karl-Oskar's brother, Robert, another family that is escaping religious persecution, and a man running away from a troublesome wife. The film traces their difficult ten-week journey on a rickety sailing ship across the Atlantic, then an inland journey to what is now Minnesota. The emigrants survive the journey and start their life in the New World.

==Reception==

Richard Schickel wrote in Life that "Jan Troell has made the masterpiece about the dream that shaped America - a dream, and an America, fast disappearing from our views."[tpl]cite journal |last1=Schickel |first1=Richard |authorlink=Richard Schickel |year=1972 |title=When America was a dream |journal=Life |volume= |issue=October 13 |pages=28 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yFYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q=&f=false| accessdate=2010-01-21[/tpl] Vincent Canby of The New York Times hailed the acting performances, especially from Sydow and Ullmann, which he found to hold "a kind of spontaneous truth, in look and gesture, that does a lot to relieve the otherwise programed nobility, truth and beauty." One complaint was raised by Canby: "As he showed in Here's Your Life, Mr. Troell, who is a fine cameraman, simply cannot resist the extra shot of sunlight-reflected-in-water that becomes just one too many, a thing of movie decoration."Canby, Vincent (1972-09-25).
