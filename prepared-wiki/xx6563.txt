[[List of Latin phrases]]

CATEGORIES: Lists of Latin phrases, Lists of lists

This page lists direct English translations of common Latin phrases, such as veni, vidi, vici and et cetera. Some of the phrases are themselves translations of Greek phrases, as Greek rhetoric and literature were highly regarded in ancient Rome when Latin rhetoric and literature were still maturing.
The Latin letter i can be used as either a vowel or a consonant. When used as a consonant, it is often replaced by the letter j, which was originally simply an orthographic "long i" that was used in initial positions and when it occurred between two other vowels. This convention from Medieval Latin is most commonly preserved in Latin legal terminologyâ€”hence phrases like de iure are often spelled de jure.
