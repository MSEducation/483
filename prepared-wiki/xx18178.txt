Atbash is a simple substitution cipher for the Hebrew alphabet. It consists in substituting aleph (the first letter) for tav (the last), beth (the second) for shin (one before last), and so on, reversing the alphabet. Hence the name, Aleph-Tav-Beth-Shin (אתבש). In the Book of Jeremiah, [tpl]nowrap|לב קמי[/tpl] Lev Kamai (51:1) is Atbash for [tpl]nowrap|כשדים[/tpl] Kasdim (Chaldeans), and [tpl]nowrap|ששך[/tpl] Sheshakh (25:26; 51:41) is Atbash for [tpl]nowrap|בבל[/tpl] Bavel (Babylon). It has been associated with the esoteric methodologies of Jewish mysticism's interpretations of Hebrew religious texts as in the Kabbalah.
The Atbash cipher for the modern Hebrew alphabet would be:
  Plain:  <span lang="he">אבגדהוזחטיכלמנסעפצקרשת</span>
  Cipher: <span lang="he">תשרקצפעסנמלכיטחזוהדגבא</span>
An Atbash cipher for the Latin alphabet would be as follows:
  Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  Cipher: ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA
An easier, simpler and faster way of doing this is:
  First 13 letters: A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M
  Last 13 Letters:  Z|Y|X|W|V|U|T|S|R|Q|P|O|N
Atbash can also be used to mean the same thing in any other alphabet as well. This is a very simple substitution cipher.
For example, in Atbash, the letters "nlmvb" indicate the word "money" Worked Example.
A few English words 'Atbash' into other English words. For example, "hob"="sly", "hold"="slow", "holy"="slob", "horn"="slim", "zoo"="all", "irk"="rip", "low"="old", "glow"="told", and "grog"="tilt."  Some other English words Atbash into their own reverses, e.g., "wizard" = "draziw."
It is a very weak cipher because it only has one possible key, and it is a simple monoalphabetic substitution cipher. However, this may not have been an issue in the cipher's time.

==Relationship to the affine cipher==

The Atbash cipher can be seen as a special case of the affine cipher.
This may be simplified to:
