Northwestern University (NU or, inaccurately, NWU) is a private research university with campuses in Evanston and Chicago in Illinois, United States. Northwestern has 12 undergraduate, graduate, and professional schools offering 124 undergraduate degrees and 145 graduate and professional degrees.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/academics/undergraduate-a-to-z.html |title=Undergraduate Programs: A to Z Guide |publisher=Northwestern University |accessdate=December 2, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/academics/graduate-a-to-z.html |title=Graduate and Professional Programs: A to Z Guide |publisher=Northwestern University |accessdate=December 2, 2009[/tpl]
Northwestern was founded in 1851 by John Evans, for whom Evanston is named, and eight other lawyers, businessmen and Methodist leaders to serve the people of a region that had once been known as the Northwest Territory. Instruction began in 1855; women were admitted in 1869. Today, the main campus is a [tpl]convert|240|acre|ha|adj=on[/tpl] parcel in Evanston, along the shores of Lake Michigan. The university's law and medical schools are located on a [tpl]convert|25|acre|ha|adj=on[/tpl] campus in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood. In 2008, the University opened a campus in Education City, Doha, Qatar with programs in journalism and communication. In academic year 2010-2011, Northwestern enrolled 8,397 undergraduate and 7,870 graduate and professional students.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/about/northwestern-at-a-glance/students.html |title=Common Data Set – Enrollment and persistence |publisher=Northwestern University |accessdate=September 18, 2008[/tpl]

Northwestern is a founding member of the Big Ten Conference and remains the only private university in the conference. The Northwestern Wildcats compete in 19 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA's Division I.

==History==

The foundation of Northwestern University is traceable to a meeting on May 31, 1850 of nine prominent Chicago businessmen, Methodist leaders and attorneys who had formed the idea of establishing a university to serve what had once been known as the Northwest Territory. On January 28, 1851, the Illinois General Assembly granted a charter to the Trustees of the North-Western University, making it the first chartered university in Illinois.[tpl]Harvnb|Williamson|Wild|1976|pp=5–6[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The Northwestern University Charter and Amendments |url=http://www.library.northwestern.edu/archives/nu_charter.pdf |accessdate=August 5, 2007 |publisher=Northwestern University[/tpl][tpl]Ref label|a|a|none[/tpl] The school's nine founders, all of whom were Methodists (three of them ministers), knelt in prayer and worship before launching their first organizational meeting.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.northwestern.edu/magazine/northwestern/summer2002/features/coverstory/index.htm| title = Keeping the Faith|publisher = Northwestern|quote=Northwestern's own religious identity stretches back to its genesis. The University began with a prayer — the school's nine founders (all of them Methodists, three of them ministers) knelt in worship before launching their first organizational meeting. During that meeting, they agreed to establish a university under the patronage of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Through most of its history, Northwestern kept a strong Methodist tie. Regional church conferences chose a member of the board of trustees, and until 1890 every University president was an ordained Methodist minister.|accessdate = 2007-07-20[/tpl] Although they affiliated the university with the Methodist Episcopal Church, they were committed to non-sectarian admissions, believing that Northwestern should serve all people in the newly developing territory.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nu150.northwestern.edu/news/stories/10_21_00_founders.html |title=Planning a university to serve the Northwest Territory|quote=Although the founders were strong Methodists — three of them were Methodist ministers and before the meeting all those in attendance joined in prayer — they also firmly believed that Northwestern should be institution that would serve all people.

John Evans, for whom Evanston is named, bought [tpl]convert|379|acre|ha[/tpl] of land along Lake Michigan in 1853, and Philo Judson developed plans for what would become the city of Evanston, Illinois. The first building, Old College, opened on November 5, 1855.[tpl]Harvnb|Williamson|Wild|1976|pp=10–11[/tpl] To raise funds for its construction, Northwestern sold $100 "perpetual scholarships" entitling the purchaser and his heirs to free tuition.[tpl]Harvnb|Williamson|Wild|1976|pp=6[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/features/historic_moments/11_5_00_scholarship.html |title=Perpetual Scholarships provided early university funding |accessdate=August 5, 2007 |publisher=Northwestern University |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20070803194448/http://www.northwestern.edu/features/historic_moments/11_5_00_scholarship.html |archivedate =August 3, 2007[/tpl] Another building, University Hall, was built in 1869 of the same Joliet limestone as the Chicago Water Tower, also built in 1869, one of the few buildings in the heart of Chicago to survive the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.[tpl]cite web |url=http://media.www.dailynorthwestern.com/media/storage/paper853/news/2002/10/28/Campus/Eclectic.By.Design-1902783.shtml |title=Eclectic by Design |publisher=The Daily Northwestern|date=October 28, 2002[/tpl] In 1873 the Evanston College for Ladies merged with Northwestern, and Frances Willard, who later gained fame as a suffragette and as one of the founders of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), became the school's first dean of women. Willard Residential College (1938) is named in her honor. Northwestern admitted its first women students in 1869, and the first woman was graduated in 1874.[tpl]Harvnb|Williamson|Wild|1976|pp=23–28[/tpl]
Northwestern fielded its first intercollegiate football team in 1882, later becoming a founding member of the Big Ten Conference. In the 1870s and 1880s, Northwestern affiliated itself with already existing schools of law, medicine, and dentistry in Chicago. The Northwestern University School of Law is the oldest law school in Chicago. As the university increased in wealth and distinction, and enrollments grew, these professional schools were integrated with the undergraduate college in Evanston; the result was a modern research university combining professional, graduate, and undergraduate programs, which gave equal weight to teaching and research.[tpl]Harvnb|Williamson|Wild|1976|pp=83–84,110[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Northwestern Undergraduate Catalog 2005–07 |volume=XXVIII, |edition=3 |year=2005[/tpl] The Association of American Universities invited Northwestern to become a member in 1917. thumb|left|Deering Library (1933)
Under Walter Dill Scott's presidency from 1920 to 1939, Northwestern began construction of an integrated campus in Chicago designed by James Gamble Rogers to house the professional schools; established the Kellogg School of Management; and built several prominent buildings on the Evanston campus, Dyche Stadium (now named Ryan Field) and Deering Library among others. In 1933, a proposal to merge Northwestern with the University of Chicago was considered but rejected.[tpl]cite journal|last=Barnes |first=Sarah |title=A Lost Opportunity in American Education?

Northwestern played host to the first-ever NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship game in 1939 in the original Patten Gymnasium, which was later demolished and relocated farther north along with the Dearborn Observatory to make room for the Technological Institute.
Like other American research universities, Northwestern was transformed by World War II. Franklyn B. Snyder led the university from 1939 to 1949, when nearly 50,000 military officers and personnel were trained on the Evanston and Chicago campuses. After the war, surging enrollments under the G.I. Bill drove drastic expansion of both campuses. In 1948 prominent anthropologist Melville J. Herskovits founded the Program of African Studies at Northwestern, the first center of its kind at an American academic institution.[tpl]cite news |title=Pioneering Scholar in African Studies Finally Gets His Due |newspaper=Chicago Tribune  |date=October 28, 1995 |last=Secter |first=Bob[/tpl] J. Roscoe Miller's tenure as president from 1949 to 1970 was responsible for the expansion of the Evanston campus, with the construction of the lakefill on Lake Michigan, growth of the faculty and new academic programs, as well as polarizing Vietnam-era student protests. In 1978, the first and second Unabomber attacks occurred at Northwestern University.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/02/us/pattern-emerges-in-bomber-s-tract.html?sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=Pattern Emerges in Bomber's Tract |first=Martin |last=Gottlieb |date=August 2, 1995 |newspaper=The New York Times[/tpl] Relations between Evanston and Northwestern were strained throughout much of the post-war era because of episodes of disruptive student activism,[tpl]cite news |title=N.U.

Though government support for universities declined in the 1970s and 1980s, President Arnold R. Weber was able to stabilize university finances, leading to a revitalization of the campuses. As admissions to colleges and universities grew increasingly competitive in the 1990s and 2000s, President Henry S. Bienen's tenure saw a notable increase in the number and quality of undergraduate applicants, continued expansion of the facilities and faculty, and renewed athletic competitiveness. In 1999, Northwestern student journalists uncovered information exonerating Illinois death row inmate Anthony Porter two days before his scheduled execution, and the Innocence Project has since exonerated 10 more men.[tpl]cite news |title=A New Ending To an Old Story; Journalism Students Rewrite the Case Of an Innocent Man Set to Die |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=February 17, 1999 |first=Jon |last=Jeter[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.medill.northwestern.edu/journalism/undergrad/page.aspx?id=59507 |title=Medill Innocence Project |accessdate=August 26, 2008[/tpl] On January 11, 2003, in a speech at Northwestern School of Law's Lincoln Hall, then Governor of Illinois George Ryan announced that he would commute the sentences of more than 150 death row inmates.[tpl]cite news |title=Decision day for 156 inmates; Ryan poised to make history after 3 years of debate on death penalty |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |first1=Steve |last1=Mills |first2=Maurice |last2=Possley |date=January 12, 2003[/tpl]
The Latin phrase on Northwestern's seal, Quaecumque sunt vera (Whatsoever things are true) is drawn from the Epistle of Paul to the Philippians 4:8, while the Greek phrase inscribed on the pages of an open book is taken from the Gospel of John 1:14: ο λόγος πλήρης χάριτος και αληθείας (The Word full of grace and truth).[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.northwestern.edu/magazine/northwestern/summer2002/features/coverstory/index.htm |title= Keeping the Faith |publisher=Northwestern Magazine |accessdate =May 27, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.library.northwestern.edu/archives/university_seal.pdf |title=The Northwestern University seal ...

==Campuses==

===Evanston===

Northwestern's Evanston campus, where the undergraduate schools, the Graduate School, and the Kellogg School of Management are located, runs north-south from Lincoln Avenue to Clark Street west of Lake Michigan along  Sheridan Road. North and South Campuses have noticeably different atmospheres, owing to the predominance of Science and Athletics in the one and Humanities and Arts in the other. North Campus is home to the fraternity quads, the Henry Crown Sports Pavilion and Norris Aquatics Center and other athletic facilities, the Technological Institute, Dearborn Observatory, and other science-related buildings including Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Hall for Nanofabrication and Molecular Self-Assembly, and the Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center. South Campus is home to the University's humanities buildings, Pick-Staiger Concert Hall and other music buildings, the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art, and the sorority quads.  In the 1960s, the University created an additional [tpl]convert|84|acre|ha|1[/tpl] by means of a lakefill in Lake Michigan. Among some of the buildings located on these broad new acres are University Library, Norris University Center (the student union), and Pick-Staiger Concert Hall.
The Chicago Transit Authority's elevated train running through Evanston is called the Purple Line, taking its name from Northwestern's school color. The Foster and Davis stations are within walking distance of the southern end of the campus, while the Noyes station is close to the northern end of the campus. The Central station is close to Ryan Field, Northwestern's football stadium.  The Evanston Davis Street Metra station serves the Northwestern campus in downtown Evanston and the Evanston Central Street Metra station is near Ryan Field. Pace Suburban Bus Service and the CTA have several bus routes that run through or near the Evanston campus.

===Chicago===

Northwestern's Chicago campus is located in the city's Streeterville neighborhood. The Chicago campus is home to the medical school and affiliated hospitals, the law school, the part-time MBA program, and the School of Continuing Studies, which offers evening and weekend courses for working adults. Northwestern's professional schools and affiliated hospitals are about four blocks east of the Chicago station on the CTA Red Line. The Chicago campus is also served by CTA bus routes.
Founded at various times in the university's history, the professional schools originally were scattered throughout Chicago.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.library.northwestern.edu/archives/exhibits/architecture/building.php?bid=7 |title=Northwestern Architecture, Chicago Campus |publisher=Northwestern University Archives |accessdate=July 11, 2008[/tpl] In connection with a 1917 master plan for a central Chicago campus and President Walter Dill Scott's capital campaign, [tpl]convert|8.5|acre|ha|2[/tpl] of land were purchased at the corner of Chicago Avenue and Lake Shore Drive for $1.5 million in 1920.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,758505,00.html |title=Refund |accessdate=July 11, 2008 |date=November 29, 1937 |work=Time | location = New York [/tpl] The architect James Gamble Rogers was commissioned to create a master plan for the principal buildings on the new campus which he designed in  collegiate gothic style. In 1923, Mrs. Montgomery Ward donated $8 million to the campaign to finance the construction of the Montgomery Ward Memorial Building which would house the medical and dental schools and to create endowments for faculty chairs, research grants, scholarships, and building maintenance.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.library.northwestern.edu/archives/exhibits/architecture/building.php?bid=13 |title=Northwestern Architecture, Montgomery Ward |accessdate=July 11, 2008 |publisher=Northwestern University Archives[/tpl] The building would become the first university skyscraper in the United States. In addition to the Ward Building, Rogers designed Wieboldt Hall to house facilities for the School of Commerce[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.library.northwestern.edu/archives/exhibits/architecture/building.php?bid=28 |title=Northwestern Architecture, Wieboldt Hall |accessdate=July 11, 2008 |publisher=Northwestern University Archives[/tpl] and Levy Mayer Hall to house the School of Law.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.library.northwestern.edu/archives/exhibits/architecture/building.php?bid=10 |title=Northwestern Architecture, Levy Mayer Hall |accessdate=July 11, 2008 |publisher=Northwestern University Archives[/tpl] The new campus comprising these three new buildings was dedicated during a two-day ceremony in June 1927. The Chicago campus continued to expand with the addition of Thorne Hall in 1931 and Abbott Hall in 1939.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.library.northwestern.edu/archives/exhibits/architecture/building.php?bid=2 |title=Northwestern Architecture, Abbott Hall |publisher=Northwestern University Archives |accessdate=July 4, 2009[/tpl] In October 2013, Northwestern began the demolition of the architecturally significant Prentice Women's Hospital after a questionable publicity campaign equated retaining the building with allowing people to die.http://www.suntimes.com/news/otherviews/14960045-452/a-choice-save-prentice-or-save-lives-add-jobs-and-research-dollars.html

===Satellite Campus in Qatar===

In Fall 2008, Northwestern opened a campus in Education City, Doha, Qatar, joining five other American universities: Carnegie Mellon University, Cornell University, Georgetown University, Texas A&M University, and Virginia Commonwealth University.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/bin/printfriendly.php?id=9921842 |title=Oil money cultivates a Mideast Ivy League |last=Lewin |first=Tamar |newspaper=International Herald Tribune | location = Paris |date=February 11, 2008 |accessdate=January 6, 2009[/tpl] Through the Medill School of Journalism and School of Communication, NU-Q offers bachelors degrees in journalism and communication respectively.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.qatar.northwestern.edu/ |title=Northwestern University in Qatar |publisher=Northwestern University |accessdate=January 6, 2009[/tpl] The Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development provided funding for construction and administrative costs as well as support to hire 50 to 60 faculty and staff, some of whom rotate between the Evanston and Qatar campuses.[tpl]cite news |title=Qatar entices NU to expand east: School near deal to open a campus |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=April 6, 2007 |last=Choen |first=Jodi[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/04/06/america/NA-GEN-US-Qatar-Journalism-School.php |title=Northwestern University expected to open journalism school in Qatar |agency=The Associated Press | newspaper = International Herald Tribune | location = Paris  |date=April 6, 2007 |accessdate=January 6, 2009[/tpl]

===Sustainability===

In January 2009, the Green Power Partnership (GPP, sponsored by the EPA) listed Northwestern as one of the top 10 universities in the country in purchasing energy from renewable sources. The university matches 74 million kilowatt hours (kWh) of its annual energy use with Green-e Certified Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). This green power commitment represents 30 percent of the university's total annual electricity use and places Northwestern in the EPA's Green Power Leadership Club. The 2010 Report by The Sustainable Endowments Institute awarded Northwestern a "B-" on its College Sustainability Report Card.[tpl]cite web|title =The College Sustainability Report Card 2009|publisher =Sustainable Endowments Institute|url =http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2010/schools/northwestern-university/|accessdate = June 1, 2009 [/tpl]  The Initiative for Sustainability and Energy at Northwestern (ISEN), supporting research, teaching and outreach in these themes, was launched in 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.isen.northwestern.edu/|title=ISEN[/tpl]
Northwestern requires that all new buildings be LEED-certified.  Silverman Hall on the Evanston campus was awarded Gold LEED Certification in 2010; Wieboldt Hall on the Chicago campus was awarded Gold LEED Certification in 2007, and the Ford Motor Company Engineering Design Center on the Evanston campus was awarded Silver LEED Certification in 2006.  New construction and renovation projects will be designed to provide at least a 20% improvement over energy code requirements where technically feasible.[tpl]cite web|title =Northwestern University Facilities Management: Environmental Sustainability|publisher =Northwestern University|url =http://www.northwestern.edu/sustainability/strategic-initiatives/energy/index.html|accessdate = August 15, 2013 [/tpl]  The university also released at the beginning of the 2008–09 academic year the Evanston Campus Framework Plan, which outlines plans for future development of the Evanston Campus.  The plan not only emphasizes the sustainable construction of buildings, but also discusses improving transportation by optimizing pedestrian and bicycle access.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/observer/framework.pdf |title=Northwestern University Evanston Campus Framework Plan |publisher=Northwestern University |accessdate=June 1, 2009 |format=PDF[/tpl] Northwestern has had a comprehensive recycling program in place since 1990.  Annually more than 1,500 tons are recycled at Northwestern, which represents 30% of the waste produced on campus.  Additionally, all landscape waste at the university is composted.

==Organization and administration==

Northwestern is privately owned and is governed by an appointed Board of Trustees. The board, composed of 70 members and [tpl]as of |2011 |lc=y[/tpl] chaired by William A. Osborn '69, delegates its power to an elected president to serve as the chief executive officer of the university.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.adminplan.northwestern.edu/board-of-trustees/charter.htm |title=Board of Trustees: Charter, National and Alumni Trustees |publisher=Northwestern University |accessdate= July 14, 2011 [/tpl] Northwestern has had sixteen presidents in its history (excluding interim presidents), the current president, Morton O.

Northwestern University is composed of 12 schools and colleges. The faculty for each school consists of the dean of the school and the instructional faculty. Faculty are responsible for teaching, research, advising students, and serving on committees. Each school's admission requirements, degree requirements, courses of study, and disciplinary and degree recommendations are determined by the voting members of that school's faculty (assistant professor and above).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.northwestern.edu/provost/faculty/handbook.pdf |title=Faculty Handbook |publisher=Northwestern University |accessdate=September 19, 2008 |archivedate=May 14, 2008 |archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20080514152234/http://www.northwestern.edu/provost/faculty/handbook.pdf [/tpl]
Northwestern's financial endowment was $7.9 billion as of June 30, 2013, the tenth largest among US and Canadian universities. In 2003, Northwestern finished a five-year capital campaign that raised $1.55 billion, $550 million more than its goal.

===Research===

Northwestern was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1917 and remains a research university with "very high" research activity. Northwestern's schools of management, engineering, and communication are among the most academically productive in the nation. Northwestern received $511.7 million in research funding in 2011. Northwestern supports nearly 1,500 research laboratories across two campuses, predominately in the medical and biological sciences. Through the Innovation and New Ventures Office (INVO), Northwestern researchers disclosed 247 inventions, filed 270 patents applications, received 81 foreign and US patents, started 12 companies, and generated $79.8 million in licensing revenue in 2013. The bulk of revenue has come from a patent on pregabalin, a synthesized organic molecule discovered by chemistry professor Richard Silverman, which ultimately was marketed as Lyrica, a drug sold by Pfizer, to combat epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia. INVO has been involved in creating a number of centers, including the Center for Developmental Therapeutics (CDT) and the Center for Device Development (CD2).  It has also helped form over 50 Northwestern startup companies based on Northwestern technologies.http://invo.northwestern.edu

==Campus life==

===Traditions===

The undergraduates have a number of traditions: Painting The Rock (originally a fountain donated by the Class of 1902) is a way to advertise, for example, campus organizations, events in Greek life, student groups, and university-wide events.Northwestern University Wildcams: Troubleshooting[tpl]dead link|date=May 2012[/tpl] Dance Marathon, a 30-hour philanthropic event, has raised more than 13 million dollars in its history for various children's charities.NUDM | About NUDM Primal Scream is held at 9 p.m. on the Sunday before finals week every quarter; students lean out of windows or gather in courtyards and scream.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ugadm.northwestern.edu/student-life/northwestern-traditions/index.html |title=Northwestern traditions, Campus life, Freshman, Office of Undergraduate Admission – Northwestern University |publisher=Ugadm.northwestern.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22[/tpl] Armadillo Day, or, more popularly, Dillo Day, a day of music and food, is held on Northwestern's Lakefill every Spring on the weekend after Memorial Day.  And in one of the University's newer traditions, every year during freshman orientation, known as Wildcat Welcome, freshmen and transfer students pass through Weber Arch to the loud huzzahs of upperclassmen and the music of the University Marching Band.
There are traditions long associated with football games. Students growl like wildcats when the opposing team controls the ball, while simulating a paw with their hands. They will also jingle keys at the beginning of each kickoff. In the past, before the tradition was discontinued, students would throw marshmallows during games.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/2007/09/4005/nufootball/ |title=Keys, claws and nachos for breakfast: A beginners' guide to NU football games |date=September 2, 0076  |accessdate=August 26, 2008[/tpl] The Clock Tower at the Rebecca Crown Center glows purple, instead of its usual white, after a winning game, thereby proclaiming the happy news. The Clock Tower remains purple until a loss or until the end of the sports season. Whereas formerly the Clock Tower was lighted only for football victories, wins for men's basketball and women's lacrosse now merit commemoration as well; important victories in other sports may also prompt an empurpling.

Northwestern fields 19 intercollegiate athletic teams (8 men's and 11 women's) in addition to numerous club sports.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.northwestern.edu/about/facts/ |title=Northwestern University Facts |publisher=Northwestern University |accessdate=August 20, 2008[/tpl]  The women's lacrosse team won five consecutive NCAA national championships between 2005 and 2009, went undefeated in 2005 and 2009, added more NCAA championships in 2011 and 2012, giving them 7 NCAA championships in 8 years, and holds several scoring records.[tpl]cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=3412373&type=Story&imagesPrint=off |title=Northwestern completes four-peat in women's lacrosse |first=David |last=Lomonico |date=May 25, 2008 |work=ESPN[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=4203437 |title= Northwestern wins 5th straight title |agency=Associated Press | work=ESPN |date=May 24, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Northwestern Women's Lacrosse Archives|url=http://www.nusports.com/sports/w-lacros/archive/nw-w-lacros-archive.html|publisher=Northwestern University|accessdate=21 May 2013[/tpl]  The men's basketball team is recognized by the Helms Athletic Foundation as the 1931 National Champion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/120404aaa.html |title=100 Great Moments in Big Ten Men's Basketball History |publisher=Big Ten Official Athletic Site |accessdate=May 15, 2009[/tpl] In the 2010–11 school year, the Wildcats had one national championship, 12 teams in postseason play, 20 All-Americans, two CoSIDA Academic All-American selections, 8 CoSIDA Academic All0District selections, 1 conference Coach of the Year and Player of the Year, 53 All-Conference and a record 201 Academic All-Big Ten athletes. Overall, 12 of Northwestern's 19 varsity programs had NCAA or bowl postseason appearances.
The football team plays at Ryan Field (formerly known as Dyche Stadium); the basketball, wrestling, and volleyball teams play at Welsh-Ryan Arena. Northwestern's athletic teams are nicknamed the Wildcats. Before 1924, they were known as "The Purple" and unofficially as "The Fighting Methodists." The name Wildcats was bestowed upon the university in 1924 by Wallace Abbey, a writer for the Chicago Daily Tribune who wrote that even in a loss to the University of Chicago, "Football players had not come down from Evanston; wildcats would be a name better suited to Glenn Thistletwaite's boys."[tpl]cite news | last =Abbey | first =Wallace | title =Maroons beat Purple by a Dropkick | pages = A1 | newspaper = Chicago Tribune | date = November 16, 1924 [/tpl] The name was so popular that university board members made "wildcats" the official nickname just months later. In 1972, the student body voted to change the official nickname from "Wildcats" to "Purple Haze" but the new name never stuck.[tpl]cite news|title=Purple Haze Won't Go Away At N.U. |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=April 18, 1972 |last=Damer |first=Roy[/tpl]
The mascot of Northwestern Athletics is Willie the Wildcat. The first mascot, however, was a live, caged bear cub from the Lincoln Park Zoo named Furpaw who was brought to the playing field on the day of a game to greet the fans. But after a losing season, the team, deciding that Furpaw was to blame for its misfortune, banished him from campus forever. Willie the Wildcat made his debut in 1933 first as a logo, and then in three dimensions in 1947, when members of the Alpha Delta fraternity dressed as wildcats during a Homecoming Parade. The Northwestern University Marching Band (NUMB) performs at all home football games and leads cheers in the student section and performs the Alma Mater at the end of the game.
Northwestern's football team has made 73 appearances in the top 10 of the AP poll since 1936 (including 5 at #1) and has won eight Big Ten conference championships since 1903.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.appollarchive.com/football/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=top10app&decade=all&rows=all |title=Appearances in AP Top 10 |publisher=AP Poll Archive |accessdate=March 7, 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.appollarchive.com/football/ap/app_total.cfm?sort=num1app&decade=all&rows=all |title=Appearances in at #1 in AP Poll |publisher=AP Poll Archive |accessdate=March 7, 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nationalchamps.net/NCAA/database/northwestern_database.htm |title=Northwestern Football History Database |publisher=NationalChamps.net |accessdate=May 2, 2009[/tpl] At one time, Northwestern had the longest losing streak in Division I-A, losing 34 consecutive games between 1979 and 1982.[tpl]cite news |title=The Streak!
