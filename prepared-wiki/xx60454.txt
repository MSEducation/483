[[King Clancy Memorial Trophy]]

CATEGORIES: National Hockey League trophies and awards

The King Clancy Memorial Trophy is awarded annually to the National Hockey League player who best exemplifies leadership qualities on and off the ice and who has made a significant humanitarian contribution to his community. Since the award was established in 1988, no player has won it more than once, but players from the same team have won it in different years. The winner is chosen by "a  special panel of representatives" from the Professional Hockey Writers' Association and the NHL Broadcasters' Association.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/trophies/awards062206.html|title=Thornton, Lidstrom big winners at Awards Show|author=Phil Coffey|accessdate=2007-09-14|date=2006-06-23|publisher=NHL[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==History==

The King Clancy Memorial Trophy is named in honour of Francis M. "King" Clancy, a former player for the Ottawa Senators and Toronto Maple Leafs who later went on to become a coach, referee, and team executive. The trophy was first awarded in 1988, and was presented to the National Hockey League by Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard, who called Clancy "one of the greatest humanitarians that ever lived".[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7r4yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Ye8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1431,3741582 |title=Ballard honors Clancy's life with trophy |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=1986-12-17 |accessdate=2011-02-12 |page=F3[/tpl]  It honours similar community service as the Charlie Conacher Humanitarian Award which was retired in 1984.
No player has won it more than once, but four teams have had more than one player win the award. Three Calgary Flames have won the award, as have three Boston Bruins (the only team with two consecutive awards); the only other franchises that have had more than one winner are the Edmonton Oilers and the New York Islanders.
Players from seven different Canadian teams have won this trophy comprising ten out of the 24 times that it has been awarded. While players from the Calgary Flames have won three times, players from the Edmonton Oilers have won two times, five other teams (Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vancouver Canucks, and Winnipeg Jets) have won it once.
