==History==

Josiah Belden (1815–1892) arrived in California with the Bartleson-Bidwell Party in 1841.   Belden, a naturalized Mexican citizen, received the four square league Rancho Barranca Colorado grant in 1844.  Belden did not live on the land grant, and in 1846, gave William B. Ide ownership to half of the rancho, in exchange for Ide operating the ranch.  William Brown Ide (1796–1852), 49 years old, arrived at Sutter's Fort in 1845, and then went work on Peter Lassen's  Rancho Bosquejo.  Belden was a resident of San Jose in 1849, when he sold the entire rancho to the Ide family.[tpl]cite book |last=Hoover |first=Mildred B. |authorlink= |coauthors=Hero & Ethel Rensch, and William N.
