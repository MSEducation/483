Marion Mitchell Morrison (born Marion Robert Morrison; May 26, 1907 – June 11, 1979), better known by his stage name John Wayne, was an American film actor, director and producer.[tpl]cite news|last=Kehr |first=Dave |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/w/john_wayne/index.html |title=John Wayne News|work=The New York Times |accessdate=July 30, 2011[/tpl] An Academy Award-winner, Wayne was among the top box office draws for three decades.[tpl]cite web|title=John Wayne |publisher=The Numbers |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/people/0JWAY.php |accessdate=March 29, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reelclassics.com/Articles/General/quigleytop10-article.htm |title=Quigley's Annual List of Box-Office Champions, 1932–1970 |publisher=Reel Classics|accessdate=March 25, 2012[/tpl] An enduring American icon, he epitomized rugged masculinity and is famous for his demeanor, including his distinctive calm voice, walk, and height.
Wayne was born in Winterset, Iowa but his family relocated to the greater Los Angeles area when he was four years old. He found work at local film studios when he lost his football scholarship to USC as a result of a bodysurfing accident.Roberts, Randy, and James S. Olson (1995). John Wayne: American. New York: Free Press. pp. 63–64. ISBN 978-0-02-923837-0 Initially working for the Fox Film Corporation, he mostly appeared in small bit parts. His first leading role came in the widescreen epic The Big Trail (1930), which led to leading roles in numerous films throughout the 1930s, many of them in the western genre. His career rose to further heights in 1939, with John Ford's Stagecoach making him an instant superstar. Wayne would go on to star in 142 pictures, primarily typecast in Western films.
Among his best known later films are The Quiet Man (1952), which follows him as an Irish-American boxer and his love affair with a fiery spinster played by Maureen O'Hara; The Searchers (1956), in which he plays a Civil War veteran who seeks out his abducted niece, played by Natalie Wood, in order to murder her for having lived with a Native American; Rio Bravo (1959), playing a Sheriff with Dean Martin; The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962), portraying a gunslinging rancher competing with Eastern lawyer James Stewart for a woman's hand in marriage; True Grit (1969), playing a humorous U.S. Marshal who sets out to avenge a man's death in the role that won Wayne an Academy Award; and The Shootist (1976), his final screen performance, in which he plays an aging gunfighter battling cancer.
Wayne moved to Orange County, California in the 1960s, and was a prominent Republican in Hollywood, supporting anti-communist positions.Jim Beaver, "John Wayne". Films in Review, Volume 28, Number 5, May 1977, pp. 265–284. He died of stomach cancer in 1979. In June 1999, the American Film Institute named Wayne 13th among the Greatest Male Screen Legends of All Time.

==Early life==

John Wayne was born Marion Robert Morrison on May 26, 1907 at 216 South Second Street in Winterset, Iowa.Madison County, Iowa, birth certificate. His middle name was soon changed from Robert to Mitchell when his parents decided to name their next son Robert.Roberts, Randy, and James S. Olson (1995). John Wayne: American. New York: Free Press. pp. 8–9. ISBN 978-0-02-923837-0.(Years later, after Wayne became an actor, a publicist's error referred to his "real" name as Marion Michael Morrison instead of the correct Marion Mitchell Morrison. This error infected virtually every biography of Wayne until Roberts and Olson uncovered the facts in their biography John Wayne: American, drawing on the draft of Wayne's unfinished autobiography, among other sources.)Roberts, Randy, and James S. Olson (1995). John Wayne: American. New York: Free Press. pp. 8–10. ISBN 978-0-02-923837-0.Wayne, John, My Kingdom, unfinished draft autobiography, University of Texas Library. Wayne's father, Clyde Leonard Morrison (1884–1937), was the son of American Civil War veteran Marion Mitchell Morrison (1845–1915). Wayne's mother, the former Mary "Molly" Alberta Brown (1885–1970), was from Lancaster County, Nebraska. Wayne's ancestry included Scottish, Scots-Irish, Irish, and English.John Wayne: a tribute, by Norm Goldstein, p. 12, Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1979 He was brought up as a Presbyterian.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/wayne.htm |title=John Wayne: American |publisher=WashingtonPost.com |date= May 13, 1997|accessdate=July 30, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/john-wayne/d0/i0000094.htm |title=Ancestry of John Wayne: Fifth Generation |publisher=Genealogy.com |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2011[/tpl]
Wayne's family moved to Palmdale, California, and then in 1911 to Glendale, California, where his father worked as a pharmacist. A local fireman at the station on his route to school in Glendale started calling him "Little Duke" because he never went anywhere without his huge Airedale Terrier, Duke.Roberts, Randy, and James S. Olson (1995). John Wayne: American. New York: Free Press. p. 37. ISBN 978-0-02-923837-0.Munn, Michael (2003). John Wayne: The Man Behind the Myth. London: Robson Books. p. 7. ISBN 0-451-21244-4. He preferred "Duke" to "Marion", and the name stuck for the rest of his life.
Wayne attended Wilson Middle School in Glendale. As a teen, he worked in an ice cream shop for a man who shod horses for Hollywood studios. He was also active as a member of the Order of DeMolay, a youth organization associated with the Freemasons. He played football for the 1924 champion Glendale High School team.[tpl]cite web|title=A Pictorial History of Glendale High School |publisher=Glendale High School |url=http://www.glendalehigh.com/ghshistory.html |accessdate=May 21, 2012[/tpl]
Wayne applied to the U.S. Naval Academy, but was not accepted. He instead attended the University of Southern California (USC), majoring in pre-law. He was a member of the Trojan Knights and Sigma Chi fraternities.[tpl]cite book|author=Ronald L.

Wayne began working at the local film studios. Prolific silent western film star Tom Mix had found him a summer job in the prop department in exchange for football tickets. Wayne soon moved on to bit parts, establishing a longtime friendship with the director who provided most of those roles, John Ford. Early in this period he had a minor, uncredited role as a guard in the 1926 film Bardelys the Magnificent. Wayne also appeared with his USC teammates playing football in Brown of Harvard (1926), The Dropkick (1927), and Salute (1929) and Columbia's Maker of Men (filmed in 1930, released in 1931).Biography of John Wayne. Think Quest: Library.

==Film career==

===Early career and breakthrough===

While working for Fox Film Corporation in bit roles, he was given on-screen credit as "Duke Morrison" only once, in Words and Music (1929). In 1930, director Raoul Walsh saw him moving studio furniture while working as a prop boy and cast him in his first starring role in The Big Trail (1930). For his screen name, Walsh suggested "Anthony Wayne", after Revolutionary War general "Mad Anthony" Wayne. Fox Studios chief Winfield Sheehan rejected it as sounding "too Italian". Walsh then suggested "John Wayne". Sheehan agreed, and the name was set. Wayne himself was not even present for the discussion.Roberts & Olson, p. 84. His pay was raised to $105 a week.
The Big Trail was to be the first big-budget outdoor spectacle of the sound era, made at a staggering cost of over $2 million, using hundreds of extras and wide vistas of the American southwest, still largely unpopulated at the time. To take advantage of the breathtaking scenery, it was filmed in two versions, a standard 35mm version and another in the new 70 mm Grandeur film process using an innovative camera and lenses. Many in the audience who saw it in Grandeur stood and cheered. Unfortunately, only a handful of theaters were equipped to show the film in its widescreen process, and the effort was largely wasted. Despite being highly regarded by modern critics, the film was considered a huge box office flop at the time.[tpl]cite book |last1=Clooney |first1=Nick |authorlink1=Nick Clooney |title=The Movies That Changed Us: Reflections on the Screen|date=November 2002|publisher=Atria Books, a trademark of Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-7434-1043-2 |page=195[/tpl]
After the commercial failure of The Big Trail, Wayne was relegated to small roles in A-pictures, including Columbia's The Deceiver (1931), in which he played a corpse. He appeared in the serial The Three Musketeers (1933), an updated version of the Alexandre Dumas novel in which the protagonists were soldiers in the French Foreign Legion in then-contemporary North Africa. He played the lead, with his name over the title, in many low-budget "Poverty Row" westerns, mostly at Monogram Pictures and serials for Mascot Pictures Corporation. By Wayne's own estimation, he appeared in about eighty of these horse operas from 1930 to 1939.Clooney, p. 196. In Riders of Destiny (1933) he became one of the first singing cowboys of film, albeit via dubbing.[tpl]cite book | title=Creating Country Music: Fabricating Authenticity | author=Peterson, Richard A. | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=J3zWpIOLB-MC&lpg=PA84&dq=singing%20cowboys%20john%20wayne&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q=singing%20cowboys%20john%20wayne&f=false | year=1997 | publisher=University of Chicago Press | pages=84–86 | isbn=0-226-66284-5[/tpl] Wayne also appeared in some of the Three Mesquiteers westerns, whose title was a play on the Dumas classic. He was mentored by stuntmen in riding and other western skills. He and famed stuntman Yakima Canutt developed and perfected stunts and onscreen fisticuffs techniques still used today.Canutt, Yakima, with Oliver Drake, Stuntman. University of Oklahoma Press, 1997, ISBN 0-8061-2927-1.
Wayne's breakthrough role came with director John Ford's classic Stagecoach (1939). Because of Wayne's B-movie status and track record in low-budget westerns throughout the 1930s, Ford had difficulty getting financing for what was to be an A-budget film. After rejection by all the top studios, Ford struck a deal with independent producer Walter Wanger in which Claire Trevor—a much bigger star at the time—received top billing. Stagecoach was a huge critical and financial success, and Wayne became a mainstream star. Cast member Louise Platt credits Ford as saying at the time that Wayne would become the biggest star ever because of his appeal as the archetypal "everyman".Letter, Louise Platt to Ned Scott Archive, July 7, 2002 pp: 40: http://www.thenedscottarchive.com/hollywood/films/movie-stagecoach.html#platt2
America's entry into World War II resulted in a deluge of support for the war effort from all sectors of society, and Hollywood was no exception. Wayne was exempted from service due to his age (34 at the time of Pearl Harbor) and family status, classified as 3-A (family deferment). He repeatedly wrote John Ford saying he wanted to enlist, on one occasion enquiring whether he could get into Ford's military unit, but consistently kept postponing it until after "he finished just one or two pictures".Roberts & Olson, John Wayne: American, p. 212. Wayne did not attempt to prevent his reclassification as 1-A (draft eligible), but Republic Studios was emphatically resistant to losing him; Herbert J. Yates, President of Republic, threatened Wayne with a lawsuit if he walked away from his contractRoberts & Olson, p. 220. and Republic Pictures intervened in the Selective Service process, requesting Wayne's further deferment.Roberts & Olson, p. 213.
Wayne toured U.S. bases and hospitals in the South Pacific for three months in 1943 and 1944.Roberts & Olson, p. 253. By many accounts, Wayne's failure to serve in the military was the most painful experience of his life.Roberts & Olson, p. 212. His widow later suggested that his patriotism in later decades sprang from guilt, writing: "He would become a 'superpatriot' for the rest of his life trying to atone for staying home."Wayne, Pilar, John Wayne, pp. 43–47.

===Commercial success===

Wayne's first color film was Shepherd of the Hills (1941), in which he co-starred with his longtime friend Harry Carey. The following year, he appeared in his only film directed by Cecil B. DeMille, the Technicolor epic Reap the Wild Wind (1942), in which he co-starred with Ray Milland and Paulette Goddard; it was one of the rare times he played a character with questionable values. He would appear in more than twenty of John Ford's films throughout the next two decades, including She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), The Quiet Man (1952), The Searchers (1956), The Wings of Eagles (1957), and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962).
In 1949, director Robert Rossen offered the starring role of All the King's Men to Wayne. Wayne refused, believing the script to be un-American in many ways.Roberts, Randy, and James S. Olson. John Wayne: American. New York: Free Press, 1995 ISBN 978-0-02-923837-0. Broderick Crawford, who eventually got the role, won the 1949 Oscar for best male actor, ironically beating out Wayne, who had been nominated for Sands of Iwo Jima.
He lost the leading role in The Gunfighter (1950) to Gregory Peck due to his refusal to work for Columbia Pictures because its chief, Harry Cohn, had mistreated him years before when he was a young contract player. Cohn had bought the project for Wayne, but Wayne's grudge was too deep, and Cohn sold the script to Twentieth Century Fox, which cast Peck in the role Wayne badly wanted but for which he refused to bend.
One of Wayne's most popular roles was in The High and the Mighty (1954), directed by William Wellman, and based on a novel by Ernest K. Gann. His portrayal of a heroic copilot won widespread acclaim. Wayne also portrayed aviators in Flying Tigers (1942), Flying Leathernecks (1951), Island in the Sky (1953), The Wings of Eagles (1957), and Jet Pilot (1957).
The Searchers (1956) continues to be widely regarded as perhaps Wayne's finest and most complex performance. In 2006, Premiere Magazine ran an industry poll in which Wayne's portrayal of Ethan Edwards was rated the 87th greatest performance in film history. He named his youngest son Ethan after the character.

===Later career===

John Wayne won a Best Actor Oscar for True Grit (1969). Wayne was also nominated as the producer of Best Picture for The Alamo (1960), one of two films he directed. The other was The Green Berets (1968), the only major film made during the Vietnam War to support the war. During the filming of Green Berets, the Degar or Montagnard people of Vietnam's Central Highlands, fierce fighters against communism, bestowed on Wayne a brass bracelet that he wore in the film and all subsequent films.
In an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Dirty Harry,[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl] Wayne took on the role of gritty detective McQ in the 1974 crime drama. His last film was The Shootist (1976), whose main character, J. B. Books, was dying of cancer—the illness to which Wayne himself succumbed three years later. According to the Internet Movie Database, Wayne played the lead in 142 of his film appearances.
Batjac, the production company co-founded by Wayne, was named after the fictional shipping company Batjak in Wake of the Red Witch (1948), a film based on the novel by Garland Roark. (A spelling error by Wayne's secretary was allowed to stand, accounting for the variation.) Batjac (and its predecessor, Wayne-Fellows Productions) was the arm through which Wayne produced many films for himself and other stars. Its best-known non-Wayne production was the highly acclaimed Seven Men From Now (1956), which started the classic collaboration between director Budd Boetticher and star Randolph Scott.
In the Motion Picture Herald Top Ten Money-Making Western Stars poll, Wayne was listed in 1936 and 1939.Phil Hardy The Encyclopedia of Western Movies, London, Octopus, 1985, ISBN 0-7064-2555-3 He appeared in the similar Box Office poll in 1939 and 1940.[tpl]cite web|author=Chuck Anderson |url=http://www.b-westerns.com/terms5.htm |title=Motion Picture Herald and Boxoffice Polls |publisher=B-westerns.com |date= |accessdate=August 29, 2010[/tpl] While these two polls are really an indication only of the popularity of series stars, Wayne also appeared in the Top Ten Money Makers Poll of all films from 1949 to 1957 and 1958 to 1974, taking first place in 1950, 1951, 1954 and 1971. With a total of 25 years on the list, Wayne has more appearances than any other star, beating Clint Eastwood (21) into second place.http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html
In later years, Wayne was recognized as a sort of American natural resource, and his various critics, of his performances and his politics, viewed him with more respect. Abbie Hoffman, the radical of the 1960s, paid tribute to Wayne's singularity, saying, "I like Wayne's wholeness, his style. As for his politics, well—I suppose even cavemen felt a little admiration for the dinosaurs that were trying to gobble them up."Time magazine, August 8, 1969. Reviewing The Cowboys (1972), Vincent Canby of the New York Times, who did not particularly care for the film, wrote: "Wayne is, of course, marvelously indestructible, and he has become an almost perfect father figure."

==Personal life==

Wayne was married three times and divorced twice. He was fluent in Spanish and his three wives, each of Hispanic descent, were Josephine Alicia Saenz, Esperanza Baur, and Pilar Pallete. He had four children with Josephine: Michael Wayne (November 23, 1934 – April 2, 2003), Mary Antonia "Toni" Wayne LaCava (February 25, 1936 – December 6, 2000), Patrick Wayne (born July 15, 1939), and Melinda Wayne Munoz (born December 3, 1940). He had three more children with Pilar: Aissa Wayne (born March 31, 1956), John Ethan Wayne (born February 22, 1962), and Marisa Wayne (born February 22, 1966).
Several of Wayne's children entered the film and television industry; Wayne's son Ethan was billed as John Ethan Wayne in a few films, and played one of the leads in the 1990s update of the Adam-12 television series.
His stormiest divorce was from Esperanza Baur, a former Mexican actress. She convinced herself that Wayne and co-star Gail Russell were having an affair, a claim which both Wayne and Russell denied. The night the film Angel and the Badman (1947) wrapped, there was the usual party for cast and crew, and Wayne came home very late. Esperanza was in a drunken rage by the time he arrived, and she attempted to shoot him as he walked through the front door.
Wayne had several high-profile affairs, including one with Marlene Dietrich that lasted for three years.Olson & Roberts, John Wayne: American, pp. 195–197. After his separation from his wife, Pilar, in 1973, Wayne became romantically involved and lived with his former secretary Pat Stacy (1941–1995) until his death in 1979. She published a biography of her life with him entitled Duke: A Love Story in 1983.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/duke-a-love-story-an-intimate-memoir-of-john-waynes-last-years/oclc/9082896|title=Duke: a love story: an intimate memoir of John Wayne's last years|publisher=WorldCat|accessdate=December 12, 2011[/tpl]
Wayne's hair began thinning in the 1940s, and he started wearing a hairpiece by the end of that decade. He was occasionally seen in public without the hairpiece (notably, according to Life magazine, at Gary Cooper's funeral).[tpl]cite web|url=http://images.google.com/hosted/life/f?q=Gary+Cooper+funeral+source:life&prev=/images%3Fq%3DGary%2BCooper%2Bfuneral%2Bsource:life%26ndsp%3D20%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DN%26start%3D60&imgurl=afe6f658739e168a |title=John Wayne and wife arriving at church for funeral service for actor Gary Cooper |publisher=Images.google.com |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2011[/tpl] During a widely noted appearance at Harvard University, Wayne was asked by a student, "Where did you get that phony hair?" He responded, "It's not phony. It's real hair. Of course, it's not mine, but it's real."[tpl]Cite book|title=John Wayne: The Man Behind the Myth|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qqatDJRg1NYC&pg=PA311&lpg=PA311&dq=john+wayne+It%27s+not+mine,+but+it%27s+real!&source=bl&ots=eBnGSmLy4m&sig=erOML5XqaeDqGviQwQPPFzz6MVc&hl=en&ei=7mvmTvevB4r10gHa_ZDwBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=john%20wayne%20It%27s%20not%20mine%2C%20but%20it%27s%20real!&f=false|isbn=978-0-451-21414-0|first=Michael|last=Munn|year=2005|publisher=New American Library|location=New York|page=311|accessdate=December 12, 2011[/tpl]
A close friend of Wayne's, California Congressman Alphonzo Bell, wrote of him, "Duke's personality and sense of humor were very close to what the general public saw on the big screen. It is perhaps best shown in these words he had engraved on a plaque: 'Each of us is a mixture of some good and some not so good qualities. In considering one's fellow man it's important to remember the good things ... We should refrain from making judgments just because a fella happens to be a dirty, rotten SOB.'"Alphonzo Bell, with Marc L. Weber, The Bel-Air Kid: An Autobiography, Trafford Publishing, 2002, ISBN 978-1-55369-378-9.
Wayne biographer Michael Munn chronicled Wayne's drinking habits. According to Sam O'Steen's memoir, Cut to the Chase, studio directors knew to shoot Wayne's scenes before noon, because by afternoon he "was a mean drunk"."Cut to the Chase" by Sam O'Steen. Los Angeles: Michael Wiese Productions (February 2002) ISBN 0-941188-37-X, p. 11. He had been a chain-smoker of cigarettes since young adulthood and was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1964.

Despite efforts by his business associates to prevent him from going public with his illness for fear that it would cost him work, Wayne announced he had cancer and called on the public to get preventive examinations.

===Politics===

Throughout most of his life, Wayne was a vocally prominent conservative Republican. Initially a self-described socialist during his college years, he voted for Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1936 presidential election and expressed admiration for Roosevelt's successor, fellow Democratic President Harry S Truman.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.playboy.co.uk/life-and-style/interview/64826/1/Playboy-Interview-John-Wayne/commentsPage/1/contentPage/4 |title=Interview: John Wayne |publisher=Playboy |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100718002740/http://www.playboy.co.uk/life-and-style/interview/64826/1/Playboy-Interview-John-Wayne/commentsPage/1/contentPage/4 |archivedate=July 18, 2010 |accessdate=April 2, 2014[/tpl] He took part in creating the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals in February 1944 and was elected president of that organization in 1947. An ardent anti-communist and vocal supporter of the House Un-American Activities Committee, in 1952 he made Big Jim McLain to show his support for the anti-communist cause. Recently declassified Soviet documents reveal that despite being a fan of Wayne's movies, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin contemplated Wayne's assassination as a result of his frequently-espoused anti-communist politics.Montefiore, Sebag (2003).

Wayne supported Vice President Richard Nixon in the presidential election of 1960, but expressed his vision of patriotism when John F. Kennedy won the election: "I didn't vote for him but he's my president, and I hope he does a good job."[tpl]cite book |title=Howard Hawks: The Grey Fox of Hollywood |last=McCarthy |first=Todd |page=583[/tpl] He used his iconic star power to support conservative causes, including rallying support for the Vietnam War by producing, co-directing, and starring in the critically panned The Green Berets in 1968. In a May, 1971 interview with Playboy magazine Wayne responded to questions about whether entitlement programs including Medicare and Social Security were good for the country:
Due to his enormous popularity and his status as the most famous Republican star in Hollywood, wealthy Texas Republican Party backers asked Wayne to run for national office in 1968, as had his friend and fellow actor Senator George Murphy. He declined, joking that he did not believe the public would seriously consider an actor in the White House. Instead he supported his friend Ronald Reagan's runs for Governor of California in 1966 and 1970. He was asked to be the running mate for Democratic Alabama Governor George Wallace in 1968, rejecting the offer and actively campaigned for Richard Nixon;Judis, John. — "Kevin Phillips, Ex-Populist: Elite Model". — The New Republic. — (c/o Carnegie Endowment for International Peace) — May 22, 2006.

===Death===

Although he enrolled in a cancer vaccine study in an attempt to ward off the disease, Wayne died of stomach cancer on June 11, 1979, at the UCLA Medical Center, and was interred in the Pacific View Memorial Park cemetery in Corona del Mar. According to his son Patrick and his grandson Matthew Muñoz, a priest in the California Diocese of Orange, he converted to Roman Catholicism shortly before his death.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pw/John_Wayne.html |title=The religion of John Wayne, actor |publisher=Adherents.com |date= |accessdate=October 20, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.calcatholic.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?id=9e13fe4d-3aac-4aec-abab-032cc267b317 |title=My granddaddy John Wayne |work=California Catholic Daily |first=David |last=Kerr |date=October 4, 2011 |accessdate=October 4, 2011[/tpl] He requested that his tombstone read "Feo, Fuerte y Formal", a Spanish epitaph Wayne described as meaning "ugly, strong, and dignified".Candelaria, Nash.

Among the cast and crew who filmed the 1956 film The Conqueror on location near St. George, Utah, 91 developed some form of cancer at various times, including stars Wayne, Susan Hayward, and Agnes Moorehead, and director Dick Powell. The film was shot in southwestern Utah, east of and generally downwind from the site of recent U.S. Government nuclear weapons tests in southeastern Nevada.

===Awards, celebrations, and landmarks===

John Wayne's enduring status as an iconic American was formally recognized by the U.S. government by awarding him the two highest civilian decorations. He was recognized by the United States Congress on May 26, 1979, when he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Hollywood figures and American leaders from across the political spectrum, including Maureen O'Hara, Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, Mike Frankovich, Katharine Hepburn, General and Mrs. Omar Bradley, Gregory Peck, Robert Stack, James Arness, and Kirk Douglas, testified to Congress of the merit and deservedness of this award. Most notable was the testimony of Robert Aldrich, then president of the Directors Guild of America, who said:

On June 9, 1980, Wayne was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Jimmy Carter, at whose inaugural ball Wayne had appeared "as a member of the loyal opposition," as Wayne described it in his speech to the gathering.
In 1998, Wayne was posthumously awarded the Naval Heritage Award by the U S Navy Memorial Foundation for his support of the U S Navy and military during his film career.
Various public locations are named in honor of Wayne, including the John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, where a nine-foot bronze statue of him stands at the entrance; the John Wayne Marina[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.portofpa.com/marinas/john-wayne-marina.html |title=John Wayne Marina |publisher=Portofpa.com |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2011[/tpl] that Wayne bequeathed the land for, near Sequim, Washington; John Wayne Elementary School (P.S. 380) in Brooklyn, New York, which boasts a 38-foot mosaic mural commission by New York artist Knox Martin[tpl]cite web|author=www.esensedesigns.com |url=http://www.knoxmartin.com/exhibitions.html |title=Exhibitions |publisher=Knoxmartin.com |date=September 21, 2008 |accessdate=July 30, 2011[/tpl] entitled "John Wayne and the American Frontier";[tpl]cite web|url=http://schools.nyc.gov/community/facilities/PublicArt/Art/artitem.htm?ac=314&an=20056 |title=John Wayne, Knox Martin — Public Art for Public Schools |publisher=Schools.nyc.gov |date=May 21, 2009 |accessdate=July 30, 2011[/tpl] and a 100-plus-mile trail named the "John Wayne Pioneer Trail" in Washington state's Iron Horse State Park. A larger than life-size bronze statue of Wayne atop a horse was erected at the corner of La Cienega Boulevard and Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California at the former offices of the Great Western Savings & Loan Corporation, for whom Wayne had made a number of commercials. In the city of Maricopa, Arizona, part of Arizona State Route 347 is named John Wayne Parkway, which runs through the center of town.
In 2006, friends of Wayne's and his former Arizona business partner, Louis Johnson, inaugurated the "Louie and the Duke Classics" events benefiting the John Wayne Cancer Foundation[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jwcf.org/ |title=John Wayne Cancer Foundation |publisher=Jwcf.org |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2011[/tpl] and the American Cancer Society.Olson, Jim. — "Louie and the Duke Classics 2006". — Grande Living. — October 2006. — (Adobe Acrobat *.PDF document).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jwcf.org/news/2006.html |title=News and Events: 2006 Archive |publisher=Jwcf.org |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2011[/tpl] The weekend long event each fall in Casa Grande, Arizona includes a golf tournament, an auction of John Wayne memorabilia and a team roping competition.

Wayne's films ran repetitiously at the local theater. Ground was broken for the New John Wayne Birthplace Museum and Learning Center at a ceremony consisting of over 30 of Wayne's family members, including Melinda Wayne Munoz, Aissa, Ethan and Marisa Wayne.

===Cultural image as an American icon===

Wayne rose beyond the typical recognition for a famous actor to that of an enduring icon who symbolized and communicated American values and ideals. By the middle of his career, Wayne had developed a larger-than-life image, and as his career progressed, he selected roles that would not compromise his off-screen image. By the time of his last film The Shootist (1976), Wayne refused to allow his character to shoot a man in the back as was originally scripted,Trivia — The Shootist (1976) — IMDb. saying "I've made over 250 pictures and have never shot a guy in the back. Change it."
Wayne's rise to being the quintessential movie war hero began to take shape four years after World War II, when Sands of Iwo Jima (1949) was released. His footprints at Grauman's Chinese theater in Hollywood were laid in concrete that contained sand from Iwo Jima.Endres, Stacey and Robert Cushman. Hollywood at Your Feet. Beverly Hills: Pomegranate Press, 1993 ISBN 0-938817-08-6. His status grew so large and legendary that when Japanese Emperor Hirohito visited the United States in 1975, he asked to meet John Wayne, the symbolic representation of his country's former enemy.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946563,00.html |title=The Nation: Hirohito Winds Up His Grand U.S. Tour |publisher=Time.com |date=October 20, 1975 |accessdate=July 30, 2011[/tpl]
Wayne was a popular visitor to the war zones in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. By the 1950s, perhaps in large part due to the military aspect of films such as the Sands of Iwo Jima, Flying Tigers, They Were Expendable, and the Ford cavalry trilogy, Wayne had become an icon to all the branches of the United States Armed Forces, even in light of his actual lack of military service. Many veterans have said their reason for serving was in some part related to watching Wayne's movies. His name is attached to various pieces of gear, such as the P-38 "John Wayne" can opener, so named because "it can do anything", paper towels known as "John Wayne toilet paper" because "it's rough and it's tough and don't take shit off no one," and C-ration crackers are called "John Wayne crackers" because presumably only someone as tough as Wayne could eat them. A rough and rocky mountain pass used by military tanks and jeeps at Fort Irwin in San Bernardino County, California, is named "John Wayne Pass".[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2013[/tpl]
Wayne is the only actor to appear in every edition of the annual Harris Poll of Most Popular Film Actors, and the only actor to appear on the list after his death. Wayne has been in the top ten in this poll for 19 consecutive years, starting in 1994, 15 years after his death.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/NewsRoom/HarrisPolls/tabid/447/mid/1508/articleId/1141/ctl/ReadCustom%20Default/Default.aspx|title=Denzel Washington Flies to Number One and is America's Favorite Movie Star |publisher=Harris Interactive |date=January 23, 2013 |accessdate=October 2, 2013[/tpl]

===Brass Balls Award===

In 1973, The Harvard Lampoon, a satirical paper run by Harvard University students, invited Wayne to receive The Brass Balls Award, created in his "honor", after calling him "the biggest fraud in history". Harvard Square had become a hot bed of leftist intellectualism and protest throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Wayne accepted the invitation as a chance to promote the recently released film McQ, and a Fort Devens Army convoy offered to drive him into the square on an armored personnel carrier.[tpl]cite book|last=Lotman|first=Mo|title=Harvard Square: An Illustrated History Since 1950|year=2009|publisher=Stewart, Tabori & Chang|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58479-747-0|page=95[/tpl] The ceremony was held on January 15, 1974, at the Harvard Square Theater and the award was officially presented in honor of Wayne's "outstanding machismo and penchant for punching people".[tpl]cite web|last=Zegarac|first=Nick|title=John Wayne – American|url=http://thehollywoodart.blogspot.com/2006/11/john-wayne-american.html|work=The Hollywood Art|accessdate=June 24, 2013[/tpl] Although the convoy was met with protests by members of the American Indian Movement and others, some of whom threw snowballs, Wayne received a standing ovation from the audience when he walked onto the stage.[tpl]cite news|last=Reed|first=Phillip, Jr.|title=John Wayne handles Harvard challenge well|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=799&dat=19740116&id=LrhaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JFMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1039,904103|accessdate=June 24, 2013|newspaper=The Bryan Times|date=January 16, 1974[/tpl] An internal investigation was launched into the Army's involvement in the day.
