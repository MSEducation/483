She rises to this occasion and offers astonishing, unique takes on songs by Rodgers and Hart, George and Ira Gershwin, Antônio Carlos Jobim, Randy Newman, and other legendary writers.

Vivino performed in Stars Of David, which opened November 12 at the Daryl Roth Theatre. The show ran until December 15, and Donna was seen in roles such as Mandy, Ruth Ginsberg and Fran Drescher.

===Wicked===

Vivino played a 20-month stint as Elphaba on the first national tour of hit musical Wicked. She joined the tour on October 30, 2007, serving as the standby for Carmen Cusack. Her first ever performance took place on December 26, 2007, and her first in the lead role on November 5, 2008. She starred alongside Katie Rose Clarke and later Chandra Lee Schwartz as Glinda. Her final performance took place on July 4, 2010. On August 23, 2011, Donna took over the position of Elphaba standby on Broadway, replacing Jennifer DiNoia. She first covered during the absence of lead Teal Wicks on the matinee of September 14. Jackie Burns replaced Wicks once her contract ended. Incidentally, Burns was Vivino's replacement on the national tour. Vivino has been re-united with Clarke (who reprises her lead role) while performing as standby. Vivino went on for Burns the last two weeks of Burns' contract while she was suffering from the flu. She then went on standby for Willemijn Verkaik and then for Lindsay Mendez. She left the show on November 3, 2013, and will be seen soon in Stars of David off-Broadway at the Daryl Roth Theatre.
