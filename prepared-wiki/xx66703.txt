Kimpo played a major role during the Korean War, the USAF designated the airfield as Kimpo Air Base or K-14.
North Korean forces attacked South Korea on 25 June 1950 starting the Korean War. During one of the first Korean People's Air Force (KPAF) attacks on 25 June a Military Air Transport Service C-54 Skymaster was destroyed on the ground at Kimpo. On 27 June US naval and air forces began evacuating 748 US diplomats, military dependents, and civilians by air transport from Kimpo and Suwon Airfield.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/information/heritage/milestones.asp?dec=1950|title=History Milestones Sunday, January 01, 1950 - Thursday, December 31, 1959|publisher=U.S. Air Force|accessdate=25 June 1950|archiveurl=http://archive.is/ZikPk|archivedate=2013-06-28[/tpl] On the afternoon of 27 June five F-82 Twin Mustangs of the 68th Fighter Squadron and 339th Fighter Squadron were escorting four C-54 Skymaster aircraft out of Kimpo when the C-54s were attacked by five KPAF Lavochkin La-7 fighters. In the subsequent dogfights three LA-7s were shot down for the loss of no US aircraft in the first air battle of the war.[tpl]cite web|url=http://militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=25221 |title=Valor Awards for James Walter Little |publisher=Gannett Company |year=2011 |accessdate=25 June 2013[/tpl]
Later that day four F-80Cs of the 35th Fighter-Bomber Squadron shot down four Ilyushin Il-10s for no losses over Kimpo in the USAF's first jet-aircraft victory.
Kimpo was captured by the KPA shortly after the capture of Seoul on 28 June 1950. On 29 June eight B-29s of the 19th Bomb Group bombed Kimpo and the Seoul railyards. By July the KPAF were using the base for attacks on UN forces, on July 10, seven Yak-7s were hidden at Kimpo and used in strikes against UN positions at Cheongju. The next day they surprised and damaged several F-80s in the area. On July 15 the US launched an attack on Kimpo, destroying two or three of the seven Yak-7s there and damaging the runway.[tpl]cite book|first=Robert F.|last=Futrell |title=The United States Air Force in Korea, 1950–1953|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|year=1997|isbn=9780160488795|pages=99-101[/tpl] On 5 August 5th Air Force fighters strafed and bombed Kimpo destroying 9 aircraft and damaging 9 others.Futrell, p.102

The airfield was in excellent shape as the North Koreans had not had time to do any major demolition.Hoyt, p.61 On 19 September, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers repaired the local railroad up to eight miles (13 km) inland and 32 C-54 transport planes began flying in gasoline and ordnance.

Following the Chinese Third Phase Campaign and the defeat of UN Forces at the 38th parallel, on 5 January 1951 General Ridgway ordered the evacuation of Seoul and the withdrawal of UN forces to a new defensive line along the 37th parallel. Units based at Kimpo were withdrawn to the south and facilities were destroyed to prevent their use by Chinese and North Korean forces.
UN Forces resumed the offensive again in late January 1951 and launched Operation Thunderbolt on 25 January with the aim of pushing Chinese and North Korean forces back north of the Han River. By 10 February 1951, UN forces once again had control of Kimpo.Futrell, p.293

===Postwar===

In 1958 Kimpo was designated as the international airport of the South Korean capital city and has grown into a much more significant airport that is capable of handling 226,000 flights a year. The airport had one domestic and two international terminals before its international function was replaced by Incheon International Airport. Gimpo currently has two runways (3600 m×45 m & 3200 m×60 m), two passenger terminals, and one cargo terminal.
The airport is located south of the Han River in western Seoul. (The name "Gimpo" comes from the nearby city of Gimpo, of which the airport used to be a part.)
