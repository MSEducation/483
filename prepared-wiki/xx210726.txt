The University of El Salvador or Universidad de El Salvador (UES) is the oldest and the most prominent university institutions in El Salvador. It serves as the national university of the country. The main campus, Ciudad Universitaria, is located in the capital of San Salvador, but there are also branches of the university in other Salvadoran cities such as Santa Ana, San Miguel and San Vicente. In addition, there is a new branch of University of El Salvador in the municipality of Nueva Concepcion, Chalatenango, located in the north of El Salvador.

==History==

The University of El Salvador was founded on February 16, 1841, as an initiative of the Gral. Francisco Malespin and the priest Crisanto Salazar, with the objective of providing a centre for further education for the Salvadoran youth.  
Throughout much of its existence, the university has had a precarious existence, in the earlier years characterised by lack of governmental support and funding. In the 1950s, the University of El Salvador faced opposition from the authoritarian government of the country and many of the students and university professors were victims of the military repression. In the 1970s student uprisings took place. On July 19, 1972, the government of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina intervened at the university to suppress the student uprising with military action. During the period of occupation, that extended until the end of 1973, the university campus was occupied by troops. When the university reopened, a campaign against the university community began, accusing it to be a center of Marxist indoctrination. In the following years, hundreds of students, university professors, and university authorities faced government repression, and in October 1980, the university's chancellor, Felix Ulloa, was assassinated.
On June 26, 1980, the University was once again occupied by the Armed Forces, having begun a period of three years in exile. The earthquake of 10 October 1986, seriously damaged the infrastructure of the University in San Salvador. Until the end of Civil War of El Salvador (1980–1992), the UES underwent a period of decay.
In 1991, with the election of Dr. Fabio Castillo, a period of recovery of the University began. In the administration of Maria Isabel Rodriguez, who served from 1999–2008, the University reached out to the government, and campus's infrastructure was improved. Meanwhile, the University maintains a progressive and democratic line in favor of the great majorities.
