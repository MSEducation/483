Roy Oliver Disney (June 24, 1893 – December 20, 1971) was an American businessman, partner and co-founder, along with his younger brother Walt Disney, of Walt Disney Productions, now known as The Walt Disney Company.

==Early life==

Roy was born to Irish-Canadian Elias Disney and English-German-American Flora Call Disney in Chicago, Illinois. Roy served in the US Navy from 1917–1919; a year later his brother Walt tried joining the US Army, only being refused due to being under age. Roy was later discharged from military duty after contracting tuberculosis, and became a banker in Los Angeles. In 1923, Walt moved to Hollywood, joining Roy, together founding the Disney Bros Studio. Roy and Walt ordered and built kit houses from Pacific Ready Cut Homes (a Los Angeles company) and in 1928, they built their homes side by side on Lyric Avenue. Their homes were slightly customized and enlarged, and do not exactly match the original homes featured in the Pacific Ready Cut Homes catalogs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jul/16/realestate/re-kit16 |title=Pollard-Terry, Gayle.

==Walt Disney Productions==

While Walt was the creative man, Roy was the one who made sure the company was financially stable; Roy and Walt both founded Disney Studios as brothers, but Walt would buy out most of Roy's share in 1929 and, unlike Max and Dave Fleischer of rival Fleischer Studios, Roy was not a co-producer.
Roy became the company's first CEO in 1929, although the official title was not given until 1968. He also shared the role of Chairman of the Board with Walt from 1945. Walt however dropped the Chairman title in 1960 so he could focus more on the creative aspects of the company. After Walt Disney's death in 1966, Roy postponed his retirement to oversee construction of what was then known as Disney World, and later renamed it Walt Disney World as a tribute to his brother. Roy became the president of Walt Disney Productions on December 15, 1966, and remained so until 1968.

Throughout his life, Roy rejected the publicity and fame that came with being Walt's brother. He was extremely camera shy, and a passive individual resulting in few public photos being in existence.

==Death==

After Walt Disney World opened in October 1971, Roy Disney finally retired. In early December of that year, he complained of a "spot" over one of his eyes and was scheduled to visit his optometrist for a new eyeglass prescription.  He was discovered in a dazed condition, collapsed, next to his bed by family members; he died from a seizure.  His interment is located in Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery.
