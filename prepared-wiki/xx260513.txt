The Body in Question is a British-based, internationally co-produced medical television series first aired in the UK in November 1978.

==Premise==

This is a 13-part series (1 hour episodes) on all aspects of medicine and health science, written and presented by Dr Jonathan Miller.
Miller considers the functioning of the body as a subject of private experience. He explores our attitudes towards our bodies, our ignorance of them, and our inability to read our body's signals.  The first episode starts with vox populi asking where various organs in the body are located.  By the final episode we are left in no doubt, as the show became the first in television history to depict the dissection of a human cadaver (i.e. post-mortem or autopsy).
Taking as his starting point the experience of pain, Dr. Miller analyses the elaborate social process of "falling ill", considers the physical foundations of "disease" and looks at the types of individuals humankind has historically attributed with the power of healing.  The series was nominated for two 1979 BAFTAs: Best Factual Television Series and Most Original Programme/Series.BAFTA Awards History Search = Patrick Uden
