==History==

===Amateur era===

Cornish emigrant miners working for the Compañía Real del Monte y Pachuca founded the "Pachuca Athletic Club" in 1901. Originally they practiced football only as a pastime during the free time they had while working at the mines owned by William Blamey. Alfred C. Crowle was the man who first introduced the sport to the mine workers, bringing the first footballs and the rules. Other clubs soon were established in surrounding states, including  Albinegros de Orizaba, Reforma AC, British Club, Puebla A.C. and Mexico Cricket Club.
On July 19, 1907 the Mexican Primera División was founded, with Pachuca as one of the founding members.
In the 1908 season, a Mexican born player, David Islas, appeared for the first time in the ranks of the team. From 1910 to 1912, the Mexican Revolution decimated professional football in Mexico until only three clubs remained; Pachuca being one of them. By 1915, most of the players on the team were Mexicans. From 1917 to 1920, Pachuca were league champions under British coach Alfred C. Crowle. Pachuca then went into a hiatus during the 1920–1921 season when most of its players moved to Mexico City. Many years passed by until a second division Mexican Second Division team were reassembled.

===Professional era===

In 1967 the team is crowned champion of the Segunda División and is able to move up to the Primera División. The team fares poorly and returns to the Segunda División in the early 1970s. The "Tuzos" would have to wait 19 years before being able to return to the Primera División in the 1992–1993 season, where they would struggle to remain and were relegated at the end of that same season. The loss of prestige of the Segunda División causes a new division of play to be created. The Primera División A is created in 1994, later called Liga de Ascenso and the team is a sensation. However, they are unable to crown their efforts and fall to Atlético Celaya in an overtime final. In the 1995–1996 season, the team becomes champion of the Primera "A" tournament and is promoted to the Primera División. The team struggles yet again, and returns to the Primera División "A" once more.
After the FMF splits the calendar into two half-length tournaments, Pachuca becomes champion of the Winter tournament. After defeating Tigrillos in the promotion final, once again, Pachuca returns to the Primera División. In the 1998–1999 season, the team breaks its own bad streak by a draw against Atlante in the Estadio Azteca in front of 30,000 people and avoid returning to the Primera División "A" and for the first time in 30 years remaining in the top league for two consecutive years under coach Javier Aguirre. In the winter tournament of 1999, Pachuca makes history by crowning itself for the first time since the league become professional. They defeat Cruz Azul in the second leg of the final playoff. Javier Aguirre leads an unexpected team to victory, which culminated with a golden goal scored by Argentinian striker Alejandro Glaria who used his inner thigh to push the ball into the net. Repeatedly interviewed during quarterfinals and semifinals, Aguirre declared that he never expected to get so far, and originally expected to be on vacation by that point. As a result of their conquest, the team is invited to participate in the now defunct Copa Merconorte. With a strong effort from the organization, they manage to keep 85% of the original championship team and by 2001, the "Tuzos", again under Javier Aguirre, are finalists in the summer tournament. They fall to Santos Laguna in the Estadio Corona in Torreón, Coahuila. During that season, the team lost one of its biggest figures when Pablo Hernán Gómez was killed in a car accident on January 29, 2001. By the end of 2001, Javier Aguirre is chosen by Femexfut to coach the Mexican national football team which found itself at risk of not qualifying for the FIFA World Cup in Korea and Japan. The team selects Alfredo Tena to be the new coach. Tena leads the team to the 2001 Winter Tournament Finals where they face UANL in the Estadio Universitario and conquer their second league title.
