==Music video==

The music video for the song showed Madness performing in a rainy street. Toward the end they are joined by a number of Madness fans who join in the dancing. There are also scenes showing the band dressed in red with umbrella hats, supposedly wreaking havoc inside Suggs' ear, and shots of Lee Thompson running around with a rocket strapped to his back, a reference to the single's b-side.
