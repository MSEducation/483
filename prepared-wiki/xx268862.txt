==Plagiarism controversy==

In April 1998, Bruce accused Scottish historian James A. Mackay of plagiarizing his book Bell: Alexander Graham Bell and The Conquest of Solitude, even as Mackay acknowledged Bruce on page 12 of his book.[tpl]cite news|title=Repeat Accusations Of Plagiarism Taint Prolific Biographer|first=Ralph|last=Blumenthal|author2=Sarah Lyall|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/21/books/repeat-accusations-of-plagiarism-taint-prolific-biographer.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 21, 1999|accessdate=2011-09-23[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Media Talk; Pulitzer-Winning Writer Cries Foul Over a Bell Biography|first=Doreen|last=Carvajal|date=June 22, 1998|accessdate=2011-09-23|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/22/business/media-talk-pulitzer-winning-writer-cries-foul-over-a-bell-biography.html[/tpl] Accusations also appeared in the review of Mackay's book by The Washington Post.[tpl]cite news|title=The Bell Curve|first=Judith|last=Shulevitz|date=June 11, 1998|url=http://www.slate.com/id/1000893/|accessdate=2011-09-23|newspaper=Slate[/tpl] By Bruce's own count, 285 pages of Mackay's 297-page book Alexander Graham Bell: A Life contained plagiarisms from his book, including Mackay's acknowledging the National Geographic Society and other organizations that had not heard of Mackay. Eventually, John Wiley & Sons took the book out of print and destroyed any remaining copies at Mackay's expense in exchange for Bruce's promise not to sue.[tpl]cite news|title=Scotching Plagiarism|first=Robert V.|last=Bruce|url=http://hnn.us/articles/633.html|publisher=History News Network|date=July 8, 2002|accessdate=2011-09-23[/tpl] Mackay also later apologized to Bruce.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/plagism02.htm |title=Plagiarism: A Case of Not Avoiding It |accessdate=2011-09-24 |publisher=California State University, Dominguez Hills |last1=Curran|first1=Jeanne|first2=Susan R.|last2=Takata|date=1999-09-21[/tpl] The American Historical Association later found that Mackay had violated its Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct.[tpl]cite journal|author=American Historical Association|authorlink=American Historical Association|date=March 2001|magazine=Perspectives|volume=39|issue=3|publisher=American Historical Association|url=http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/Issues/2001/0103/0103aha1.cfm|title=Council Decides on Complaint Filed with the Professional Division[/tpl]
