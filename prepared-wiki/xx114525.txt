The 2002 CD Reissue added the following bonus tracks.Dryden K. Allmusic Review accessed 15 September 2009
On the original “Columbia Jazz Masterpieces” CD issue on Columbia/CBS Records (CK 40786), the song “Bye-Ya” clocks in at 6:03.  The 2002 re-mastered edition on the Columbia/Legacy imprint (CK 63536) contains a version which runs only 5.25.
The most obvious difference between the versions is the longer arrangement before the piano solo (which starts at 2.46 on the original CD but at 2.07 on the Legacy version).  It is difficult to tell if the shorter version is an edit or a completely different take.
