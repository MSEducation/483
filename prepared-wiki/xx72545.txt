The manipulation of devil sticks (also devil-sticks, devilsticks, flower sticks, gravity sticks, or juggling sticks) is a form of gyroscopic juggling or equilibristics, consisting of manipulating one stick ("baton") between two other sticks held one in each hand. The baton is lifted, struck, or stroked alternately by the two control sticks ('handsticks' or 'sidesticks'), stabilising the baton through gyroscopic motion.[tpl]cite book|author1=Hovey Burgess|author2=Judy Finelli|title=Circus techniques: juggling, equilibristics, (+) vaulting|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fty1AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=8 September 2012|year=1976|publisher=Drama Book Specialists|page=106[/tpl]

==Variants==

Flower sticks are one variation on devil sticks, with tassles to slow down the movement of the baton to learn more difficult moves and tricks. Fire devil sticks (also known as firesticks) typically have an aluminum core and have fuel-soaked wicks on the ends to allow them to be set on fire for visual effect.
