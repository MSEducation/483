In 2010, Ryan barely missed a spot on the Open Water National Team placing 7th in the Open Water Nationals in May 2010. After a somewhat disappointing swim in the open water, Ryan decided to focus on pool swimming for the summer. After a month of training with Jon Urbanchek out in Fullerton, CA and a few weeks taper with coach Stan Corcoran, Ryan's work paid off with a third place finish at US Nationals right behind Peter Vanderkaay. Ryan finished with a time of 15:04.84 which placed him at 7th in the world at the time.[tpl]cite news|title = Sean Ryan: Early Birthday Present|last=| first=|url =http://www.usaswimming.org/ViewNewsArticle.aspx?TabId=0&itemid=2949&mid=8712|newspaper =|publisher =USA Swimming|date = 2010-08-13|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uFE9nTzj| archivedate = 2010-11-14| accessdate =2010-11-14[/tpl] This time qualified him to represent the United States at the Pan Pacific Championships in Irvine, CA.

Ryan later in 2011 went on to the Open Water World Championships to represent the USA in the 10k swim. There he finished 25th. He missed his automatic birth to the US Olympic team by missing the top 10. 
In the 5k team event Ryan, along with Andrew Gemmell and Ashley Twitchell captured the gold medal and won the first ever World Championship in this event. The US beat Australia by one second. 
At Long Course Nationals in 2011 Ryan finished second in the 1500 freestyle to Gemmell in 15:01 and is currently the fourth fastest American in the event for 2011 and the 11th in the world.
