Aviadvigatel OJSC (Russian: ОАО "Авиадвигатель", lit. Aeromover) is a developer and builder of aero-engines for  Ilyushin Il-76MF, Ilyushin Il-96, Tupolev Tu-204, Tupolev Tu-214, and other aircraft.  It also designs and builds  high-efficiency gas turbine units for  electric power stations and for gas pumping plants.
Perm Motors Joint Stock Company (JSC), the founder of Perm motor constructors, was founded June 1, 1934  when an engine design and manufacturing factory was built at Perm Krai, Russia. The factory was originally known as OKB-19 - Soloviev, or the  Soloviev Design Bureau.OKB is the Russian acronym for "Опытное конструкторское бюро" - Opytnoe Konstructorskoe Byuro, meaning Experimental Design Bureau.
The firm was headed by Arkady Dmitrievich Shvetsov from its foundation date in 1939. Starting in early 1950s the Company was headed by Pavel Alexandrovich Soloviev, Mr.Shvetsov's successor, and was engaged in development of new gas turbine engines. Since 1989, and up to June, 2001, with a break in 1995-1997, the enterprise was headed by Yuri Evgenievich Reshetnikov. 
The first engine to be built at OKB-19 was a licensed variant of the Wright R-1820-F3 Cyclone 9, designated the Shvetsov M-25 radial engine. Other Shevtsoy designed piston engines produced at OKB-19 were the M-11, M-71 ASh-2, ASh-21, ASh-62, ASh-73 and ASh-82. In just four years OKB-19 was Russia's major manufacturer of aircraft engines.
During World War II the Plant exceeded its original design capacity by a factor of 12, producing more than 32,000 engines for Lavochkin La-5, Sukhoi Su-2 and Tupolev Tu-2s. In the 1950s the factory transitioned from piston engines to jet engines. The Plant has consolidated its positions and has become a regular partner and supplier of products for  Tupolev, Ilyushin, Mikoyan, Mil, and Myasishchev.
Perm Engine Company was established in 1997 as a subsidiary of Perm Motors Company inheriting the gas turbine production facility and the rich traditions of the largest company of the West Ural. In June 2001 Alexander A. Inozemtsev, General Designer, became the General Director of  Aviadvigatel Open Joint Stock Company (OJSC).  Starting in October 2006 he was the Managing Director & General Designer.
In October 2003, "Perm Motors Group Management Company" was established to: 1) coordinate the corporative relations and management of the Perm Motors Group companies, 2) resolve strategic marketing matters 3)  investment planning.
"Aviadvigatel" OJSC was merged into the Perm Engine Company, Perm Motors Group.Aviadvigatel's history
