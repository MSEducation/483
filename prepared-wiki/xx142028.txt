==Early settlement==

The area was first explored by Europeans in January 1838 when Dr George Imlay and John Hill passed through while making the first crossing of the Central Mount Lofty Ranges.The Colonist newspaper, 7 March 1838, p. 2. The first European settlers were the family of John and Margaret Murdoch from Scotland, who pioneered a sheep station in early 1839, giving their name to Murdoch Valley and Murdoch Hill.Southern Australian newspaper, 16 October 1839, p. 3.  Many subsequent pioneers were also of Scottish presbyterian origin, leading to the establishment in the early 1840s of a Church of Scotland church. Although initially populated by mainly Scottish settlers, a number of English and German settlers arrived later.[tpl]cite web|url=https://aadaa.asn.au/Unit%20History.html |title=Woodside Barracks History |publisher=Australian Air Defence Artillery Association |accessdate=15 September 2012[/tpl] 

==Economy==

The geography is mostly well-watered hilly timbered country with some alluvial flats, which particularly lends itself to grazing. Dairy produce and pastoralism have long been mainstays of the economy, as well as limited grain and market garden cropping. Positioned as a stop-over for people travelling to Adelaide, the township originally consisted of a single church, a pub and a number of small houses. In 1863 gold was discovered in the district and the largest and richest mine, the Bird in Hand, opened in 1881. This provided local employment for many decades, until closed by flooding in the 1940s. Other than that, little commercial development has taken place. The district is quite picturesque which, with the growth of local wine production, has led to an increasing tourism industry.  

==Military presence==

In the early 1920s the Federal government made a series of land purchases that were part of the establishment of an Army camp known as Woodside Camp in 1927, now known as Woodside Barracks. Throughout the interwar years, the camp was occupied by units of the Citizens Forces. During the Second World War, the camp was used to raise units of the Second Australian Imperial Force and a number of US Army units were also based there. In the post war period the base has been home to a number of regular Army infantry units but since 1981 has only been occupied by the 16th Air Defence Regiment.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/place_504052.asp |title=Woodside Camp |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=15 September 2012[/tpl]

==Refugee camp==

After the Second World War, Inverbrackie was the site of a refugee camp.  In 2010, the Australian Federal Government announced that it would house refugees again. It is now a low security, family orientated detention centre, with the children attending local primary and high schools.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/hills-school-welcomes-refugee-children/story-e6frea6u-1225995754624?from=public_rss |title=Hills school welcomes asylum seeker children  |author= |accessdate=24 October 2011 |date=28 January 2011 |newspaper=The Advertiser |publisher=News Limited [/tpl] The detention centre is managed by Serco and houses 400 people.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/inverbrackie-a-powder-keg-say-police-amid-claims-violent-incidents-are-being-covered-up/story-e6frea6u-1226051743344 |title=Inverbrackie a 'powder keg', say police, amid claims violent incidents are being covered up |author=Brad Crouch |accessdate=24 October 2011 |date=8 May 2011 |work=Adelaide Now |publisher=News Limited [/tpl] While there was some controversy regarding the establishment of the detention centre in the area, community anger has subsided.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/inside-the-secret-world-of-inverbrackie-detention-centre/story-e6frea6u-1226091448715 |title=Inside the secret world of Inverbrackie Detention Centre  |author=Alice Monfries |accessdate=24 October 2011 |date=9 July 2011 |work=Adelaide Now |publisher=News Limited [/tpl]
