Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sampson HA, Muñoz-Furlong A, Campbell RL, et al. |title=Second symposium on the definition and management of anaphylaxis: summary report—Second National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network symposium |journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=117 |issue=2 |pages=391–7 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16461139|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2005.12.1303[/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli))|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=177–182 |isbn=0-07-148480-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=[/tpl] It typically causes a number of symptoms including an itchy rash, throat swelling, and low blood pressure. Common causes include insect bites/stings, foods, and medications.
On a mechanistic level, anaphylaxis is caused by the release of mediators from certain types of white blood cells triggered either by immunologic or non-immunologic mechanisms. It is diagnosed on the basis of the presenting symptoms and signs. The primary treatment is injection of epinephrine, the administration of intravenous fluids, and positioning the person flat, with other measures being complementary.
Worldwide, 0.05–2% of the population is estimated to have anaphylaxis at some point in life, and rates appear to be increasing.[tpl]cite journal|last=Simons|first=FE|coauthors=World Allergy, Organization|title=World Allergy Organization survey on global availability of essentials for the assessment and management of anaphylaxis by allergy-immunology specialists in health care settings|journal=Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology |date=May 2010|volume=104|issue=5|pages=405–12|pmid=20486330|url=http://www.csaci.ca/include/files/WAO_Anaphylaxis_Guidelines_2011.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.anai.2010.01.023[/tpl] The term comes from the Greek words ἀνά ana, against, and φύλαξις phylaxis, protection.

==Signs and symptoms==

Anaphylaxis typically presents many different symptoms over minutes or hours[tpl]cite journal |author=Oswalt ML, Kemp SF |title=Anaphylaxis: office management and prevention |journal=Immunol Allergy Clin North Am |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=177–91, vi |date=May 2007 |pmid=17493497 |doi=10.1016/j.iac.2007.03.004|quote=Clinically, anaphylaxis is considered likely to be present if any one of three criteria is satisfied within minutes to hours[/tpl] with an average onset of 5 to 30 minutes if exposure is intravenous and 2 hours for foods. The most common areas affected include: skin (80–90%), respiratory (70%), gastrointestinal (30–45%), heart and vasculature (10–45%), and central nervous system (10–15%) with usually two or more being involved.

===Skin===

Symptoms typically include generalized hives, itchiness, flushing, or swelling (angioedema) of the afflicted tissues. Those with angioedema may describe a burning sensation of the skin rather than itchiness. Swelling of the tongue or throat occurs in up to about 20% of cases. Other features may include a runny nose and swelling of the conjunctiva. The skin may also be blue tinged because of lack of oxygen.

===Respiratory===

Respiratory symptoms and signs that may be present include shortness of breath, wheezes, or stridor. The wheezing is typically caused by spasms of the bronchial muscles while stridor is related to upper airway obstruction secondary to swelling.[tpl]cite journal|last=Brown|first=SG|coauthors=Mullins, RJ, Gold, MS|title=Anaphylaxis: diagnosis and management|journal=The Medical journal of Australia|date=Sep 4, 2006|volume=185|issue=5|pages=283–9|pmid=16948628[/tpl] Hoarseness, pain with swallowing, or a cough may also occur.

===Cardiovascular===

Coronary artery spasm may occur with subsequent myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, or cardiac arrest. Those with underlying coronary disease are at greater risk of cardiac effects from anaphylaxis. The coronary spasm is related to the presence of histamine-releasing cells in the heart. While a fast heart rate caused by low blood pressure is more common, a Bezold–Jarisch reflex has been described in 10% of cases where a slow heart rate is associated with low blood pressure. A drop in blood pressure or shock (either distributive or cardiogenic) may cause the feeling of lightheadedness or loss of consciousness. Rarely very low blood pressure may be the only sign of anaphylaxis.

===Other===

Gastrointestinal symptoms may include crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. There may be confusion, a loss of bladder control or pelvic pain similar to that of uterine cramps. Dilation of blood vessels around the brain may cause headaches. A feeling of anxiety or of "impending doom" has also been described.

==Causes==

Anaphylaxis can occur in response to almost any foreign substance. Common triggers include venom from insect bites or stings, foods, and medication.[tpl]cite journal|last=Worm|first=M|title=Epidemiology of anaphylaxis|journal=Chemical immunology and allergy|year=2010|volume=95|pages=12–21|pmid=20519879|doi=10.1159/000315935|series=Chemical Immunology and Allergy|isbn=978-3-8055-9441-7[/tpl] Foods are the most common trigger in children and young adults while medications and insect bites and stings are more common in older adults. Less common causes include: physical factors, biological agents such as semen, latex, hormonal changes, food additives such as monosodium glutamate and food colors, and topical medications. Physical factors such as exercise (known as exercise-induced anaphylaxis) or temperature (either hot or cold) may also act as triggers through their direct effects on mast cells.[tpl]cite book|last=editors|first=Marianne Gausche-Hill, Susan Fuchs, Loren Yamamoto,|title=The pediatric emergency medicine resource|year=2007|publisher=Jones & Bartlett|location=Sudbury, Mass.|isbn=978-0-7637-4414-4|pages=69|edition=Rev. 4.|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=lLVfDC2dh54C&pg=PA69[/tpl] Events caused by exercise are frequently associated with the ingestion of certain foods. During anesthesia, neuromuscular blocking agents, antibiotics, and latex are the most common causes.[tpl]cite journal|last=Dewachter|first=P|author2=Mouton-Faivre, C|author3=Emala, CW|title=Anaphylaxis and anesthesia: controversies and new insights|journal=Anesthesiology|date=November 2009|volume=111|issue=5|pages=1141–50|pmid=19858877|doi=10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181bbd443[/tpl] The cause remains unknown in 32-50% of cases, referred to as "idiopathic anaphylaxis".[tpl]cite book|last=editor|first=Mariana C. Castells,|title=Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions|year=2010|publisher=Humana Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60327-950-5|pages=223|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=bEvnfm7V-LIC&pg=PA223[/tpl] Six vaccines (MMR, varicella, influenza, hepatitis B, tetanus, meningococcal) are recognized as a cause for anaphylaxis, and the HPV may cause anaphylaxis as well.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.iom.edu/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2011/Adverse-Effects-of-Vaccines-Evidence-and-Causality/summary2.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=U.S. Institute of Medicine | title=Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality | year=2011 | accessdate=2014-01-16[/tpl]

===Food===

Many foods can trigger anaphylaxis; this may occur upon the first known ingestion.  Common triggering foods vary around the world.  In Western cultures, ingestion of or exposure to peanuts, wheat, nuts, certain types of seafood like shellfish, milk, and eggs are the most prevalent causes. Sesame is common in the Middle East, while rice and chickpeas are frequently encountered as sources of anaphylaxis in Asia. Severe cases are usually caused by ingesting the allergen, but some people experience a severe reaction upon contact. Children can outgrow their allergies.  By age 16, 80% of children with anaphylaxis to milk or eggs and 20% who experience isolated anaphylaxis to peanuts can tolerate these foods.

===Medication===

Any medication may potentially trigger anaphylaxis. The most common are β-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin) followed by aspirin and NSAIDs.[tpl]cite book|last=Volcheck|first=Gerald W.|title=Clinical allergy : diagnosis and management|year=2009|publisher=Humana Press|location=Totowa, N.J.|isbn=978-1-58829-616-0|pages=442|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=pWZLkZB7EW8C&pg=PA442[/tpl] Other antibiotics are implicated less frequently and the reactions to NSAIDs are agent specific meaning that if one is allergic to one NSAID they can typically tolerate a different one.  Other relatively common causes include chemotherapy, vaccines, protamine and herbal preparations. Some medications (vancomycin, morphine, x-ray contrast among others) cause anaphylaxis by directly triggering mast cell degranulation.
The frequency of a reaction to an agent partly depends on the frequency of its use and partly on its intrinsic properties.[tpl]cite journal|last=Drain|first=KL|author2=Volcheck, GW|title=Preventing and managing drug-induced anaphylaxis|journal=Drug safety : an international journal of medical toxicology and drug experience|year=2001|volume=24|issue=11|pages=843–53|pmid=11665871|doi=10.2165/00002018-200124110-00005[/tpl] Anaphylaxis to penicillins or cephalosporins only occurs after they bind to proteins inside the body with some agents binding more easily than other. Anaphylaxis to penicillin occurs once in every 2,000 to 10,000 courses of treatment, with death occurring in less than one in every 50,000 courses of treatment. Anaphylaxis to aspirin and NSAIDs occurs in about one in every 50,000 persons. If someone has a reaction to penicillins their risk of a reaction to cephalosporins is greater but still less than one in 1000. The old radiocontrast agents caused reactions in 1% of cases while the newer lower osmolar agents cause reactions in 0.04% of cases.

===Venom===

Venom from stinging or biting insects such as Hymenoptera (bees and wasps) or Triatominae (kissing bugs) may cause anaphylaxis in susceptible people.[tpl]cite journal|last=Klotz|first=JH|coauthors=Dorn, PL, Logan, JL, Stevens, L, Pinnas, JL, Schmidt, JO, Klotz, SA|title="Kissing bugs": potential disease vectors and cause of anaphylaxis|journal=Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America|date=Jun 15, 2010|volume=50|issue=12|pages=1629–34|pmid=20462351|doi=10.1086/652769[/tpl] Previous systemic reactions, which are anything more than a local reaction around the site of the sting, are a risk factor for future anaphylaxis;[tpl]cite journal|last=Bilò|first=MB|title=Anaphylaxis caused by Hymenoptera stings: from epidemiology to treatment|journal=Allergy|date=July 2011|volume=66 Suppl 95|pages=35–7|pmid=21668850|doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2011.02630.x[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Cox|first=L|author2=Larenas-Linnemann, D|author3=Lockey, RF|author4=Passalacqua, G|title=Speaking the same language: The World Allergy Organization Subcutaneous Immunotherapy Systemic Reaction Grading System|journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=March 2010|volume=125|issue=3|pages=569–74, 574.e1–574.e7|pmid=20144472|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2009.10.060[/tpl] however, half of fatalities have had no previous systemic reaction.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bilò|first=BM|author2=Bonifazi, F|title=Epidemiology of insect-venom anaphylaxis|journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=August 2008|volume=8|issue=4|pages=330–7|pmid=18596590|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e32830638c5[/tpl]

===Risk factors===

People with atopic diseases such as asthma, eczema, or allergic rhinitis are at high risk of anaphylaxis from food, latex, and radiocontrast but not from injectable medications or stings. One study in children found that 60% had a history of previous atopic diseases, and of those who die from anaphylaxis more than 90% have asthma. Those with mastocytosis or of a higher socioeconomic status are at increased risk. The longer the time since the last exposure to the agent in question the lower the risk.

==Pathophysiology==

Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction of rapid onset affecting many body systems.[tpl]cite journal|last=Khan|first=BQ|author2=Kemp, SF|title=Pathophysiology of anaphylaxis|journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=August 2011|volume=11|issue=4|pages=319–25|pmid=21659865|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e3283481ab6[/tpl] It is due to the release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines from mast cells and basophils, typically due to an immunologic reaction but sometimes non-immunologic mechanism.

===Immunologic===

In the immunologic mechanism, immunoglobulin E (IgE) binds to the antigen (the foreign material that provokes the allergic reaction). Antigen-bound IgE then activates FcεRI receptors on mast cells and basophils. This leads to the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine. These mediators subsequently increase the contraction of bronchial smooth muscles, trigger vasodilation, increase the leakage of fluid from blood vessels, and cause heart muscle depression. There is also an immunologic mechanism that does not rely on IgE, but it is not known if this occurs in humans.

===Non-immunologic===

Non-immunologic mechanisms involved substances that directly cause the degranulation of mast cells and basophils. These include agents such as contrast medium, opioids, temperature (hot or cold), and vibration.

==Diagnosis==

Anaphylaxis is diagnosed on the basis of a person's signs and symptoms. When any one of the following three occurs within minutes or hours of exposure to an allergen there is a high likelihood of anaphylaxis:
During an attack, blood tests for tryptase or histamine (released from mast cells) might be useful in diagnosing anaphylaxis due to insect stings or medications. However these tests are of limited use if the cause is food or if the person has a normal blood pressure, and they are not specific for the diagnosis.

===Classification===

There are three main classifications of anaphylaxis. Anaphylactic shock is associated with systemic vasodilation that causes low blood pressure which is by definition 30% lower than the person's baseline or below standard values.[tpl]cite journal|last=Limsuwan|first=T|author2=Demoly, P|title=Acute symptoms of drug hypersensitivity (urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock)|journal=The Medical clinics of North America|date=July 2010|volume=94|issue=4|pages=691–710, x|pmid=20609858|url=http://smschile.cl/documentos/cursos2010/MedicalClinicsNorthAmerica/Acute%20Symptoms%20of%20Drug%20Hypersensitivity%20(Urticaria,%20Angioedema,%20Anaphylaxis,%20Anaphylactic%20Shock).pdf|doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2010.03.007[/tpl] Biphasic anaphylaxis is the recurrence of symptoms within 1–72 hours with no further exposure to the allergen. Reports of incidence vary, with some studies claiming as many as 20% of cases. The recurrence typically occurs within 8 hours. It is managed in the same manner as anaphylaxis.  Pseudoanaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions are a type of anaphylaxis that does not involve an allergic reaction but is due to direct mast cell degranulation.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lee|first=JK|author2=Vadas, P|title=Anaphylaxis: mechanisms and management|journal=Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=July 2011|volume=41|issue=7|pages=923–38|pmid=21668816|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2222.2011.03779.x[/tpl] Non-immune anaphylaxis is the current term use by the World Allergy Organization with some recommending that the old terminology no longer be used.

===Allergy testing===

Allergy testing may help in determining the trigger. Skin allergy testing (such as patch testing) is available for certain foods and venoms. Blood testing for specific IgE can be useful to confirm milk, egg, peanut, tree nut and fish allergies.
Skin testing is available to confirm penicillin allergies, but is not available for other medications. Non-immune forms of anaphylaxis can only be determined by history or exposure to the allergen in question, and not by skin or blood testing.

===Differential diagnosis===

It can sometimes be difficult to distinguish anaphylaxis from asthma, syncopy, and panic attacks. Asthma however typically does not entail itching or gastrointestinal symptoms, syncope presents with pallor rather than a rash, and a panic attack may have flushing but does not have hives. Other conditions that may present similarly include: scrombroidosis and anisakiasis.

===Post-mortem findings===

In a person who died from anaphylaxis, autopsy may show an "empty heart" attributed to reduced venous return from vasodilation and redistribution of intravascular volume from the central to the peripheral compartment.Anaphylaxis, Author: Stephen F Kemp, MD, FACP; Chief Editor: Michael A Kaliner, MD;http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/135065-overview#showall Other signs are laryngeal edema, eosinophilia in lungs, heart and tissues, and evidence of myocardial hypoperfusion. Laboratory findings could detect increased levels of serum tryptase, increase in total and specific IgE serum levels.[tpl]cite journal|last=Da Broi|first=U|author2=Moreschi, C|title=Post-mortem diagnosis of anaphylaxis: A difficult task in forensic medicine|journal=Forensic Science International|date=Jan 30, 2011|volume=204|issue=1–3|pages=1–5|pmid=20684869|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2010.04.039[/tpl]

==Prevention==

Avoidance of the trigger of anaphylaxis is recommended. In cases where this may not be possible, desensitization may be an option. Immunotherapy with Hymenoptera venoms is effective at desensitizing 80–90% of adults and 98% of children against allergies to bees, wasps, hornets, yellowjackets, and fire ants. Oral immunotherapy may be effective at desensitizing some people to certain food including milk, eggs, nuts and peanuts; however, adverse effects are common. Desensitization is also possible for many medications, however it is advised that most people simply avoid the agent in question. In those who react to latex it may be important to avoid cross-reactive foods such as avocados, bananas, and potatoes among others.

==Management==

Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that may require resuscitation measures such as airway management, supplemental oxygen, large volumes of intravenous fluids, and close monitoring.  Administration of epinephrine is the treatment of choice with antihistamines and steroids (for example, dexamethasone) often used as adjuncts.  A period of in-hospital observation for between 2 and 24 hours is recommended for people once they have returned to normal due to concerns of biphasic anaphylaxis.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/reaction.pdf |title=Emergency treatment of anaphylactic reactions – Guidelines for healthcare providers |date=January 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-22 |format=PDF |work= |publisher=Resuscitation Council (UK)[/tpl]

===Epinephrine===

Epinephrine (adrenaline) is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis with no absolute contraindication to its use. It is recommended that an epinephrine solution be given intramuscularly into the mid anterolateral thigh as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. The injection may be repeated every 5 to 15 minutes if there is insufficient response. A second dose is needed in 16-35% of episodes with more than two doses rarely required. The intramuscular route is preferred over subcutaneous administration because the latter may have delayed absorption.[tpl]cite journal|last=Simons|first=KJ|author2=Simons, FE|title=Epinephrine and its use in anaphylaxis: current issues|journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=August 2010|volume=10|issue=4|pages=354–61|pmid=20543673|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e32833bc670[/tpl] Minor adverse effects from epinephrine include tremors, anxiety, headaches, and palpitations.
People on β-blockers may be resistant to the effects of epinephrine. In this situation if epinephrine is not effective intravenous glucagon can be administered which has a mechanism of action independent of β-receptors.[tpl]cite journal|last=Tang|first=AW|title=A practical guide to anaphylaxis.|journal=American family physician|date=Oct 1, 2003|volume=68|issue=7|pages=1325–32|pmid=14567487[/tpl]
If necessary, it can also be given intravenously using a dilute epinephrine solution. Intravenous epinephrine however has been associated both with dysrhythmia and myocardial infarction.[tpl]cite journal|last=Mueller|first=UR|title=Cardiovascular disease and anaphylaxis|journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=August 2007|volume=7|issue=4|pages=337–41|pmid=17620826|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e328259c328[/tpl] Epinephrine autoinjectors used for self-administration typically come in two doses, one for adults or children who weigh more than 25 kg and one for children who weigh 10 to 25 kg.[tpl]cite journal|last=Sicherer|first=SH|coauthors=Simons, FE, Section on Allergy and Immunology, American Academy of, Pediatrics|title=Self-injectable epinephrine for first-aid management of anaphylaxis|journal=Pediatrics|date=March 2007|volume=119|issue=3|pages=638–46|pmid=17332221|doi=10.1542/peds.2006-3689|last3=Section On Allergy Immunology[/tpl]

===Adjuncts===

Antihistamines (both H1 and H2), while commonly used and assumed effective based on theoretical reasoning, are poorly supported by evidence. A 2007 Cochrane review did not find any good-quality studies upon which to base recommendations[tpl]cite journal |author=Sheikh A, Ten Broek V, Brown SG, Simons FE |title=H1-antihistamines for the treatment of anaphylaxis: Cochrane systematic review |journal=Allergy |volume=62 |issue=8 |pages=830–7 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17620060 |doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01435.x |url=[/tpl] and they are not believed to have an effect on airway edema or spasm.  Corticosteroids are unlikely to make a difference in the current episode of anaphylaxis, but may be used in the hope of decreasing the risk of biphasic anaphylaxis. Their prophylactic effectiveness in these situations is uncertain.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lieberman P |title=Biphasic anaphylactic reactions |journal=Ann. Allergy Asthma Immunol. |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=217–26; quiz 226, 258 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16200811 |doi= 10.1016/S1081-1206(10)61217-3|url=[/tpl]  Nebulized salbutamol may be effective for bronchospasm that does not resolve with epinephrine. Methylene blue has been used in those not responsive to other measures due to its presumed effect of relaxing smooth muscle.

===Preparedness===

People prone to anaphylaxis are advised to have an "allergy action plan", and parents are advised to inform schools of their children's allergies and what to do in case of an anaphylactic emergency.  The action plan usually includes use of epinephrine autoinjectors, the recommendation to wear a medical alert bracelet, and counseling on avoidance of triggers.[tpl]cite journal|last=Martelli|first=A|author2=Ghiglioni, D|author3=Sarratud, T|author4=Calcinai, E|author5=Veehof, S|author6=Terracciano, L|author7=Fiocchi, A|title=Anaphylaxis in the emergency department: a paediatric perspective|journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=August 2008|volume=8|issue=4|pages=321–9|pmid=18596589|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e328307a067[/tpl] Immunotherapy is available for certain triggers to prevent future episodes of anaphylaxis.  A multi-year course of subcutaneous desensitization has been found effective against stinging insects, while oral desensitization is effective for many foods.

==Prognosis==

In those in whom the cause is known and prompt treatment is available, the prognosis is good.[tpl]cite book|last=Harris|first=edited by Jeffrey|title=Head and neck manifestations of systemic disease|year=2007|publisher=Informa Healthcare|location=London|isbn=978-0-8493-4050-5|pages=325|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=31yUl-V90XoC&pg=PA325|author2=Weisman, Michael S.[/tpl] Even if the cause is unknown, if appropriate preventative medication is available, the prognosis is generally good. If death occurs, it is usually due to either respiratory (typically asphyxia) or cardiovascular causes (shock), with 0.7–20% of cases causing death.[tpl]cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice 7th edition |last=Marx |first=John |authorlink= |year=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn=978-0-323-05472-0 |page=15111528 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Triggiani|first=M|author2=Patella, V|author3=Staiano, RI|author4=Granata, F|author5=Marone, G|title=Allergy and the cardiovascular system|journal=Clinical and experimental immunology|date=September 2008|volume=153 Suppl 1|pages=7–11|pmid=18721322|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2515352/?tool=pubmed|pmc=2515352|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03714.x|issue=s1[/tpl] There have been cases of death occurring within minutes. Outcomes in those with exercise-induced anaphylaxis are typically good, with fewer and less severe episodes as people get older.

==Epidemiology==

The number of people who get anaphylaxis is 4–5 per 100,000 persons per year, with a lifetime risk of 0.05–2%. Rates appear to be increasing: with the numbers in the 1980s being approximately 20 per 100,000 per year, while in the 1990s it was 50 per 100,000 per year.[tpl]cite journal |author=Simons FE |title=Anaphylaxis: Recent advances in assessment and treatment |journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=124 |issue=4 |pages=625–36; quiz 637–8 |date=October 2009 |pmid=19815109 |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2009.08.025 |url=https://secure.muhealth.org/~ed/students/articles/JAClinImmun_124_p0625.pdf[/tpl] The increase appears to be primarily for food-induced anaphylaxis.[tpl]cite journal|last=Koplin|first=JJ|coauthors=Martin, PE, Allen, KJ|title=An update on epidemiology of anaphylaxis in children and adults|journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=October 2011|volume=11|issue=5|pages=492–6|pmid=21760501|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e32834a41a1[/tpl] The risk is greatest in young people and females.
Currently, anaphylaxis leads to 500–1,000 deaths per year (2.4 per million) in the United States, 20 deaths per year in the United Kingdom (0.33 per million), and 15 deaths per year in Australia (0.64 per million). Mortality rates have decreased between the 1970s and 2000s.[tpl]cite journal|last=Demain|first=JG|coauthors=Minaei, AA, Tracy, JM|title=Anaphylaxis and insect allergy|journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=August 2010|volume=10|issue=4|pages=318–22|pmid=20543675|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e32833a6c72[/tpl] In Australia, death from food-induced anaphylaxis occur primarily in women while deaths due to insect bites primarily occur in males. Death from anaphylaxis is most commonly triggered by medications.

==History==

The term aphylaxis was coined by Charles Richet in 1902 and later changed to anaphylaxis due to its nicer quality of speech.[tpl]cite journal|last=Boden|first=SR|coauthors=Wesley Burks, A|title=Anaphylaxis: a history with emphasis on food allergy|journal=Immunological reviews|date=July 2011|volume=242|issue=1|pages=247–57|pmid=21682750|doi=10.1111/j.1600-065X.2011.01028.x|pmc=3122150[/tpl] In his experiments, Richet injected a dog with sea anemone toxin in an attempt to protect it. Although the dog had previously tolerated the toxin, on re-exposure with the same dose three weeks later it developed fatal anaphylaxis. Thus instead of inducing tolerance ( prophylaxis), when lethal responses resulted from previously tolerated doses, he coined the word ana (without) phylaxis (protection). He was subsequently awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on anaphylaxis in 1913. The phenomenon itself however has been described since ancient times.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ring|first=J|coauthors=Behrendt, H, de Weck, A|title=History and classification of anaphylaxis|journal=Chemical immunology and allergy|year=2010|volume=95|pages=1–11|pmid=20519878|url=http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/42/04708611/0470861142.pdf|doi=10.1159/000315934|series=Chemical Immunology and Allergy|isbn=978-3-8055-9441-7[/tpl] The term comes from the Greek words ἀνά, ana, "against", and φύλαξις, phylaxis, "protection".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anaphylaxis|title=anaphylaxis |accessdate=2009-11-21|publisher=merriam-webster.com [/tpl]

There are ongoing efforts to develop sublingual epinephrine to treat anaphylaxis. Subcutaneous injection of the anti-IgE antibody omalizumab is being studied as a method of preventing recurrence, but it is not yet recommended.[tpl]cite journal|last=Vichyanond|first=P|title=Omalizumab in allergic diseases, a recent review|journal=Asian Pacific journal of allergy and immunology / launched by the Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand|date=September 2011|volume=29|issue=3|pages=209–19|pmid=22053590[/tpl]
