Getz dropped out of college to attend the respected American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. While working in a winery, he helped found the Napa Valley Theater Company. His location in the grape-growing Napa Valley led to Getz' television debut as an Attendant in a made-for-television horror film. Killer Bees (1974) starred icon of silent film Gloria Swanson, as well as Craig Stevens (Peter Gunn), Kate Jackson (Charlie's Angels), and Edward Albert (Butterflies Are Free).

There were high hopes for the show; and the pilot was given the coveted post-Super Bowl time slot, contributing to its strong debut in the ratings. However, ABC rescheduled it repeatedly and finally relegated it to the "graveyard slot", 10:00 PM EST, Monday night. In 1998, he co-starred in Maggie as the title character's husband, "Dr. Arthur Day". Getz has guest-starred in many television series, including the long-running Three's Company (1980) as Lee Tripper, brother of Jack Tripper played by John Ritter. More recently, he has guest-starred in How I Met Your Mother, Prison Break, The King of Queens and Private Practice.

In 1991, Getz appeared as the unpleasant boyfriends of professional women in Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead and Curly Sue.  In 1990, Getz appeared as a crime boss in the Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez spoof Men At Work. In 1994, he appeared in the film Playmaker, starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Rubin.
In 2007, he had a role in David Fincher's film Zodiac. Also in 2007, he appeared in Bill Guttentag and Dan Sturman's documentary film Nanking as George Ashmore Fitch, head of the local YMCA and Administrative Director of the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone. Fitch documented atrocities committed during the massacre and toured the U.S. in 1938, lecturing on the subject. Getz' most recent role is in David Fincher's film The Social Network (2010), based on the 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires about the founding of Facebook. He also recently completed filming the suspense thriller Elevator, in which he plays a Wall Street executive trapped in an elevator with a group of strangers, one of whom has a bomb. Written and produced by Marc Rosenberg and directed by Stig Svendsen, Elevator is expected to be released in January 2012.[tpl]update after|2012|01|31[/tpl]
