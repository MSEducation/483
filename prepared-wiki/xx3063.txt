Evolutionism was a widely held 19th century belief that organisms are intrinsically likely, over time, to increase in complexity through evolution.[tpl]cite book |author=Kirkpatrick, E.

The term is sometimes also colloquially used to refer to acceptance of the modern evolutionary synthesis, a scientific theory that describes how biological evolution occurs. In addition, the term is used in a broader sense to cover a world-view on a wide variety of topics, including chemical evolution as an alternative term for abiogenesis or for nucleosynthesis of chemical elements, galaxy formation and evolution, stellar evolution, spiritual evolution, technological evolution and universal evolution, which seeks to explain every aspect of the world in which we live.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.allaboutphilosophy.org/evolutionism.htm |title=Evolutionism |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2002–2008 |work= |publisher=AllAboutGOD.com, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80949 |accessdate=2008-12-05[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last=Bitbol |first=Olivier |last2=Darrigol |year=1992 |title=Erwin Schrödinger—Philosophie et Naissance de la Méchanique Quantique |trans_title=Erwin Schrödinger—Philosophy and the Birth of Quantum Mechanics |publisher=Atlantica Séguier Frontières |isbn=978-2-86332-116-4 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3SlJsTH1ehsC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA134 |page=134[/tpl]
Since the overwhelming majority of scientists accept the modern evolutionary synthesis as the best explanation of current data,"Nearly all scientists (97%) say humans and other living things have evolved over time", Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media, Pew Research Center, 9 July 2009 the term is seldom used in the scientific community; to say someone is a scientist implies acceptance of evolutionary views,[tpl]cite web |url=http://ncse.com/cej/4/2/supposed-dichotomy-between-creationism-evolution |title=The Supposed Dichotomy between Creationism and Evolution |author=J.

In the creation-evolution controversy, creationists often call those who accept the validity of the modern evolutionary synthesis "evolutionists" and the theory itself as "evolutionism." Some creationists and creationist organizations, such as the Institute of Creation Research, use these terms in an effort to make it appear that evolutionary biology is a form of secular religion.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/299/5612/1523 |title=Perceptions in science: Is Evolution a Secular Religion? -- Ruse |author=Michael Ruse |authorlink=Michael Ruse |date=March 2003 |work= |publisher=Science |pages=299 (5612): 1523 |accessdate=2008-12-05|quote=A major complaint of the Creationists, those who are committed to a Genesis-based story of origins, is that evolution--and Darwinism in particular--is more than just a scientific theory.

==19th-century use==

Evolution originally was used to refer to an orderly sequence of events with the outcome somehow contained at the start.Carneiro, Robert Léonard (2003) Evolutionism in cultural anthropology: a critical history Westview Press pg 1-3  Darwin did not use the term in Origin of Species until its sixth edition in 1872, (though earlier editions did use the word "evolved")[tpl]cite book|last=Darwin|first=Charles|title=The Origin of Species|year=1986|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England|isbn=0-14-043205-1|edition=reprint of 1st|editor=Burrow, JW|page=460|quote=...from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved (italics not in original)[/tpl]  by which time Herbert Spencer had given it scientific currency with a broad definition of progression in complexity in 1862.  Edward B. Tylor and Lewis H Morgan brought the term "evolution" to anthropology though they tended toward the older pre-Spencerian definition helping to form the concept of unilineal evolution used during the later part of what Trigger calls the Antiquarianism-Imperial Synthesis period (c1770-c1900).Trigger, Bruce (1986) A History of Archaeological Thought Cambridge University Press pg 102

==Modern use==

In modern times, the term evolution is widely used, but the terms evolutionism and evolutionist are seldom used in the scientific community to refer to the biological discipline as the term is considered both redundant and anachronistic, though it has been used by creationists in discussing the creation-evolution controversy.
The Institute for Creation Research, in order to treat evolution as a category of religions, including atheism, fascism, humanism and occultism, commonly uses the words evolutionism and evolutionist to describe the consensus of mainstream science and the scientists subscribing to it, thus implying through language that the issue is a matter of religious belief. The goal of this argument is to equate the validity of the theory of evolution with the pseudoscientific concept of Intelligent Design.
The BioLogos Foundation, an organization that promotes the idea of theistic evolution, uses the term "evolutionism" to describe "the atheistic worldview that so often accompanies the acceptance of biological evolution in public discourse." It views this as a subset of scientism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://biologos.org/questions/biologos-id-creationism|title=How is BioLogos different from Evolutionism, Intelligent Design, and Creationism|publisher=The BioLogos Foundation|quote= While BioLogos accepts evolution, it emphatically rejects evolutionism, the atheistic worldview that so often accompanies the acceptance of biological evolution in public discourse. Proponents of evolutionism believe every aspect of life will one day be explained with evolutionary theory. In this way it is a subset of scientism, the broader view that the only real truth is that which can be discovered by science. These positions are commonly held by materialists (also called philosophical naturalists) who deny the existence of the supernatural.|accessdate=2012-01-19[/tpl]
