During qualification, each team could have up to five gymnasts compete on each apparatus, and could count the four highest scores for the team total.

Individual gymnasts, including those who were not part of a team, competed for places in the all-around and apparatus finals.  The twenty-four gymnasts with the highest scores in the all-around advanced to that final, except that each country could only send two gymnasts to the all-around final.  The eight gymnasts with the highest scores on each apparatus advanced to those finals, except that each country could only send two gymnasts to each apparatus final.
