The CMLL World Women's Championship (Campeonato Mundial Femenil de CMLL in Spanish) is the top female professional wrestling championship promoted by the Mexican lucha libre promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). The championship has existed since 1992 and is one of two women's championships currently recognized by CMLL; the other is the Mexican National Women's Championship. Being a professional wrestling championship, it is not won legitimately; it is instead won via a scripted ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline.
Bull Nakano became the first CMLL World Women's Champion after winning a 12-woman battle royal to receive the title on June 12, 1992. Marcela is the current CMLL World Women's Champion, having defeated Ayumi on March 9, 2012. This is Marcela's third reign with the title; she is the 15th overall champion and the 11th person to hold the championship. La Amapola holds the record for the longest reign with 1,442 days. Marcela and Lady Apache have had the most reigns, with three each. Marcela has had the shortest title reign, at 29 days.
