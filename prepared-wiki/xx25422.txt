In addition, mothers who forego breastfeeding in favour of formula feeding are reported more likely to develop certain types of cancer.

====Melamine contamination====

Health officials around the world have been on alert for melamine contamination in infant formula since the 2008 discovery of a massive case of melamine poisoning in China, where milk was deliberately adulterated with the chemical, leading to illnesses in more than 300,000 infants, including cases of acute kidney failure, and blamed for the deaths of at least six babies. Large quantities of melamine were added to watered-down milk to give it the appearance of having adequate protein levels.
In November 2008, traces of melamine were reported to have been found by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in infant formula sold in the United States made by the three main American firmsFDA Finds Traces Of Melamine In US Infant Formula, posted by Associated Press, November 26, 2008.Calls for national infant formula recall spread: Worried parents look for guidance after traces of melamine found, posted by MSNBC.com, November 26, 2008. — Abbott Laboratories, Nestle and Mead Johnson — responsible for 90–99% of the infant formula market in that country. The levels were much less than those reported in China, where levels of melamine contamination had reached as much as 2,500 parts per million, about 10,000 times higher than the recorded US levels. The material safety data sheet for melamine (CAS registry number 108-78-1; C3-H6-N6) recorded the acute oral toxicity (median lethal dose) at 3161 mg/kg (3161 ppm) for a rat.
Health Canada conducted a separate test and also detected traces of melamine in infant formula available in Canada. The melamine levels were well below Health Canada's safety limits,Health Canada.

====Other health controversies====

==Policy, industry and marketing==

The policy, regulatory and industry environments surrounding the infant formula market vary tremendously between countries.

===International===

The International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes is an international health policy framework adopted by the World Health Assembly of the WHO in 1981 regarding infant formula marketing, including strict restrictions on advertising. Its implementation depends on the laws of different countries and the behavior of infant formula manufacturers – the code has no power itself. Legislation and corporate behavior vary significantly between countries: at least 65 countries have enacted national legislation implementing all or many of the provisions of the Code;UNICEF. International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. Retrieved August 9, 2011. whereas elsewhere neither the Code nor its principles are followed by governments or formula manufacturers.
Practices that are banned in the Code include most advertising, claiming health benefits for formula, and giving free samples to women able to breastfeed – this latter practice is particularly criticized because it can interfere with lactation, creating dependence on formula. In many countries free samples of infant formula have been provided to hospitals for decades; infant formula is often the only product routinely provided free of charge to hospitals.Counseling the nursing mother, By Judith Lauwers, Anna Swisher, p. 597 The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative aims to reduce and eliminate this controversial practice.

===By country===

====Philippines====

Infant formula is one of the top three consumer commodities in the Philippines, and among the most imported products.Milk wars in the Philippines: Breastmilk versus Infant Formula, Global Voices, posted July 11, 2007. Annual sales amount to some US$469 million annually. US$88 million is spent on advertising the product.Cher S Jimenez, Spilled corporate milk in the Philippines, Asia Times Online, July 25, 2007, retr 22Dec 2008
Infant formula marketing has been regulated since the 1987 Executive Order 51 or "Milk Code", which regulated, but did not ban, practices such as advertising and providing free samples. Shortly after it was enacted, Wyeth introduced "follow-on formula", which was not in the purview of the Milk Code which predated its market entry.
In 2006, the Department of Health banned the advertising of infant formula and the practice of providing free samples, regardless of intended age group (in the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of Executive Order 51, or RIRR).UNICEF Philippines. Breastfeeding advocates form consolidated action against formula companies.  Makati City, November 13, 2006. Retrieved August 9, 2011. The new regulation was challenged by the infant formula industry in the Supreme Court. Initially the challenge was dismissed, but this decision was reversed following industry pressure and a controversial letter by American business leader Thomas Donahue,Letter by Thomas Donahue, August 11, 2006 then President and CEO of the US Chamber of Commerce, resulting in the regulation being suspended and advertising continuing.The Philippine Milk Code: A timelineBreast or bottle: The final showdown

====United Kingdom====

In the United Kingdom, infant formula advertising has been illegal since 1995,Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 77: The Infant Formula and Follow-on Formula Regulations 1995 but advertising for "follow-on formula" is legal, which has been cited as a loophole allowing advertising of similarly-packaged formula.Legal loophole allows banned formula advertising to mothers

====United States====

In the United States, infant formula is both heavily marketed – the country has not adopted the Code, nor is it being systematically implemented by manufacturers for domestic marketingBreastfeeding Around the World: The International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes. Retrieved August 9, 2011. – and even heavily subsidized by the government: at least one third of the American market is supported by the government, with over half of infant formula sold in the country provided through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (known as WIC).Sharing the Economic Burden: Who Pays for WIC’s Infant Formula?, AmberWaves, September 2004.
According to surveys, over 70% of large U.S. hospitals dispense infant formula to all infants, a practice opposed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and in violation of the Code.Periodic Survey of Fellows: Survey shows most AAP members support formula advertising policy, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). The Gerber Products Company began marketing its brand of infant formula directly to the public in October 1989, while the Carnation Company began marketing Good Start infant formula directly to the public in January 1991.
Infant formula costs are a significant fraction of the WIC program costs: 21% post-rebate and 46% pre-rebate. Formula manufacturers are granted a WIC monopoly in individual states. Meanwhile breastfeeding rates are substantially lower for WIC recipients;Breastfeeding: Some Strategies Used to Market Infant Formula May Discourage Breastfeeding; State Contracts Should Better Protect against Misuse of WIC Name, U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) this is partly attributed to formula being free of charge to mothers in the WIC program, who are of lower socio-economic status. Violations of federal policy have also been found in terms of infant formula company advertising using the WIC trademark, to reach both WIC and non-WIC participants. In recent years WIC has been expanding its breastfeeding promotion strategies, including providing subsidies for clients who use milk banks.Banking on Breastmilk

==Infant formula processing==

===History===

===Current general procedure===

The manufacturing process may differ for different types of formula made; therefore the following is the general procedure for liquid-milk based formulas:

====Mixing ingredients====

Primary ingredients are blended in large stainless steel tanks and skim milk is added and adjusted to 60 °C. Then, fats, oils and emulsifiers are added. Additional heating and mixing may be required to get proper consistency. Next, minerals, vitamins, and stabilizing gums are added at various points, depending on their sensitivity to heat. The batch is temporarily stored and then transported by pipelines to pasteurization equipment when mixing is complete.

====Pasteurization====

This is a process that protects against spoilage by eliminating bacteria, yeasts and molds.
It involves quickly heating and then cooling of the product under controlled conditions which micro-organisms cannot survive. The batch is held at around 85–94 °C for approximately 30 seconds which is necessary to adequately reduce micro-organisms and prepare the formula for filling.

====Homogenization====

This is a process which increases emulsion uniformity and stability by reducing size of fat and oil particles in the formula. It is done with a variety of mixing equipment that applies shear to the product and this mixing breaks fat and oil particles into very small droplets.

====Standardization====

Standardization is used to ensure that the key parameters like pH, fat concentration and vitamins and mineral content are correct. If insufficient levels of these are found, the batch is reworked to achieve appropriate levels. After this step, the batch is ready to be packaged.

====Packaging====

Packaging depends on manufacturer and type of equipment used, but in general, liquid formula is filled into metal cans with lids crimped into place.

====Heat treatment or sterilization====

Finally, infant formulas are heat treated to maintain the bacteriologic quality of the product. This can be done traditionally by either retort sterilization or high-temperature short-time (HTST) treatment. Recently, ultrahigh-temperature treated formula has become more commonly used. If powdered formula is made, then spray drying would be required in addition.[tpl]cite journal | author = Lonnerdal B., Hernell O. | year = 1998 | title = Effects of feeding ultrahigh-temperature (UHT)-treated infant formula with different protein concentrations or powdered formula, as compared with breast-feeding, on plasma amino acids, hematology, and trace element status | url = | journal = Am. J. Clin. Nutr. | volume = 68 | pages = 350–6 [/tpl] Retort sterilization is a traditional retort sterilization method that uses 10-15mins treatment at 118 °C. Ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) is a method that uses a brief (2–3 seconds) treatment at 142 °C. Because of the short time used, there is little protein denaturation, but the process still ensures sterility of the final product.

===Recent and future potential new ingredients===

====Probiotics====

Recently, probiotics have become a new ingredient in many of our foods, and studies have been completed regarding the use of probiotics in infant formulaCarvalho, R.S., Michail, S., Ashai-Khan, F., Mezoff, A.G. (2008). An Update on Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition: A Review of Some Recent Advances. Curr Probl Pediatr Adolesc Health Care, 204–228. Several randomized, controlled trials completed recently have shown limited and short term clinical benefits for the use of probiotics in infants’ diet The safety of probiotics in general and in infants, especially preterm infants, has been investigated in a limited number of controlled trials. The findings thus far suggest probiotics are generally safe. Therefore, the study suggested more scientific research is necessary before a conclusion can be made about probiotic supplementation in infant formula, since the research is still quite preliminary.

====Prebiotics====

Prebiotics are undigestible carbohydrates that promote the growth of probiotic bacteria in the gut. Human milk contains a variety of oligosaccharides believed to be an important factor in the pattern of microflora colonization of breastfed infants. Because of variety, variability, complexity and polymorphism of the oligosaccharide composition and structure, it is currently not feasible to reproduce the oligosaccharide components of human milk in a strictly structural fashion.International Assassination of Infant Food Manufacturers,“Prebiotics in Infant Nutrition”, November 9, 2009
The European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition Committee on Nutrition found evidence to support short term effects of ingesting prebiotics on stool microflora of infants with increased in the number of bifidobacteria. Babies can be at risk of dehydration with the induction of softer stools, if they have the kidney immaturity and/or a poor ability to concentrate urine. A reduction of pathogens has been associated with the consumption of prebiotics. However, there was no evidence to support major clinical or long-term benefits. Therefore, there is little evidence of beneficial effects of prebiotics in dietary products.

====Lysozyme and lactoferrin====

Lysozyme is an enzyme that is responsible for protecting the body by damaging bacterial cell walls. Lactoferrin is a globular, multifunctional protein that has antimicrobial activity. Compared to human milk, cow’s milk has a signifactly lower levels of lysozyme and lactoferrin; therefore, the industry has an increasing interest in adding them into infant formulas.
