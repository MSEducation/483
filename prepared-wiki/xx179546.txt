Croton eluteria, known as Cascarilla, is a plant species of the genus Croton, that is native to the Caribbean. It has been naturalized in other tropical regions of the Americas.  It grows to be a small tree or tall shrub (about 20 feet), rarely reaching 20 feet in height. Leaves scanty, alternate, ovate-lanceolate, averaging 2 inches long, closely scaled below, giving a metallic silver-bronze appearance, with scattered white scales above. The flowers are small, with white petals, and very fragrant, appearing in March and April. The scented bark is fissured, pale yellowish brown, and may be covered in lichen.http://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/c/cascar28.html
Tincture from the bark is used as a tonic and stimulant, and a fever reducer.  Cascarilla bark is also used to flavour the liqueurs Campari and Vermouth.http://www.yourdictionary.com/cascarilla
