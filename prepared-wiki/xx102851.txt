Guernsey Airport [tpl]Airport codes|GCI|EGJB[/tpl] is the largest airport in the Bailiwick of Guernsey and is the only airport on the island of Guernsey. It is located in the Forest, a parish in Guernsey, [tpl]convert|2.5|NM|abbr=on|lk=in[/tpl] west southwest of St. Peter Port.

==History==

The airport was officially opened on 5 May 1939. However, regular air services only commenced in October 1946. By 1948, BEA were operating a daily service to Southampton using Douglas DC-3 aircraft. From 1951, Jersey Airlines flew BEA associate scheduled services to Southampton at weekends using Rapide eight-seat biplane airliners.Merton Jones, A.C., British Independent Airlines since 1946, Merseyside Aviation Society & LAAS, 1976, ISBN 0-902420-09-7
In 1960 there were four grass runways, with lengths ranging from [tpl]convert|2040|ft|abbr=on|0[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|3060|ft|abbr=on|0[/tpl]. 1960 also saw the construction of a new tarmacked runway of a length of [tpl]convert|4800|ft|abbr=on|0[/tpl]. In early 2000s alongside the work on the new terminal, Commerce and Employment claimed an extension was necessary to allow use of larger aircraft such as the Boeing 737, or other larger jets for trans-European flights. In 2012, a set of four two-day closures under the Airport 2040 programme allowed the States of Guernsey to resurface the existing runway, extend safety areas and also reconstruct parts of the concrete apron areas. Taxiways which connect the aprons to the runway were also resurfaced and realigned, whilst a new drainage system was implemented. New airfield ground lighting and navigational aids were also installed.[tpl]cite web|title=Airport 2040|url=http://www.gov.gg/airport2040|publisher=States of Guernsey|accessdate=26 March 2012[/tpl]

===Terminal Facilities===

Work started on a new terminal building in 2002, which became operational on 19 April 2004. The old terminal was demolished in May 2004 to make space for additional aircraft stands and a passenger walkway from the new terminal. The new terminal was designed to be able to handle about 1.25 million passengers per year. In 2013, 886,396 passengers used the airport, with 49,403 aircraft movements.

===Runway===

Flybe are unable to operate their Embraer 195 aircraft into Guernsey due to the low strength of the runway, and elected to operate the smaller de Havilland Dash 8s.Flybe Blames The Runway as Gatwick Jet Link Ceases At End of OctoberFlybe is Committed Although Runway Has Cost us Millions  In 2008 business leaders and deputies were arguing the case for an extension from its current length of [tpl]convert|1463|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|1700|m|abbr=on|0[/tpl].we-need-a-longer-runway Following several years of debate it was announced on 2 October 2009 that Guernsey's airport runway and apron will be extended and repaired at an estimated cost of Â£81m.http://www.thisisguernsey.com/2009/10/03/81m-runway-spending-plans-to-go-ahead-despite-concerns/
The proposal is to add runway safety areas, RESAs, extend the take-off section by [tpl]Convert|120|m|abbr=on[/tpl], and displace the landing section to the west, the first of a two phase runway extension. The extension has mixed support, with some islanders and politicians campaigning against it, while others support it. The issue was settled by the island's government, with an Engineered materials arrestor system (EMAS) considered to save space.  The runway extension and Airport 2040 works were voted for by States members in 2011.
Sufficient progress on these works has taken place to enable Flybe to introduce an Embraer 175 jet (88 seats) on their existing Gatwick service from 31 March 2013.http://www.flybe.com/

==Airlines and destinations==

Atlantic Airlines operates from Bournemouth carrying mail, and from London Luton bringing in newspapers and DHL parcels. They also bring in general freight from Coventry. Aurigny Air Services carries some other post and also parcels on behalf of carriers including FedEx and UPS.

===General aviation===

A large number of single and twin-engined light and business aircraft are based at the airport. These, and numerous visiting general aviation aircraft, are serviced by based aviation engineering firms located in several hangars located at the southwest and southeast portions of the airport.

==Environment==

The airport currently runs two liaison groups; one for commercial airport users and one for airport neighbours. In 2002, an overturned firetruck discharged PFOS fire retardant onto the airport apron and surrounding soil. PFOS was added to Annex B of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in May 2009 and has been shown to cause chronic kidney disease amongst people and animals exposed to larger quantities. Traces of PFOS spilt later entered the island's water supply although quantities were not high enough to make it unsafe to drink. However, because the airport is at the top of the island the accident highlighted the vulnerability of the water supply to airport effluence and other water pollutants. Aerodrome works have subsequently involved environmental engineering projects to better contain and divert contaminated effluence away from the water supply. As part of the Airport 2040 development, a new drainage system is being installed and this will allow airport effluence to be contained in a manner which does not affect water supplies in the future.

==Accidents and incidents==

Main article: List of aviation accidents and incidents in the Channel Islands
On 7 December 1997 an F-27 (registration: G-BNCY) operated by AirUK arriving from Southampton overshot the runway while landing in high cross winds. The Fokker Aircraft aquaplaned on standing water, left the runway end and slid on the wet grass.  The aircraft nosed into the cross wind, ending up some [tpl]Convert|100|m|abbr=on[/tpl] off the centre line in a field to the south of the runway. There were no fatalities among the 50 passengers and 4 crew members, although the aircraft was damaged beyond repair and subsequently written off.http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19971207-0.
On 12 January 1999 a F-27 (registration: G-CHNL) operating a cargo flight for Channel Express arriving from Luton crashed short of runway 27 after deploying full flap on approach. As the flap deployed, the cargo moved aft and exited the aeroplane's mass and balance limits, the flight crew initiated a go-around which further exacerbated problem by raising the gear and applying power. The aeroplane pitched up uncontrollably and stalled which resulted in the aircraft impacting the conservatory of a house located under the flight path. Fortunately no one on the ground was injured, however both flight crew were killed by the resulting fire which engulfed the aircraft. The investigation concluded the aeroplane was not loaded in accordance with the loadsheet. http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19990112-0.
