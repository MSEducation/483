The Neue Nationalgalerie (New National Gallery) at the Kulturforum is a museum for modern art in Berlin, with its main focus on the early 20th century. It is part of the National Gallery of the Berlin State Museums. The museum building and its sculpture gardens were designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and opened in 1968.[tpl]cite web|title=Neue Nationalgalerie|url=http://www.miessociety.org/legacy/projects/neue-nationalgalerie/#6|publisher=Mies van der Rohe Society|accessdate=9 May 2013[/tpl] 

==Collection==

The collection features a number of unique highlights of modern 20th-century art. Particularly well represented are Cubism, Expressionism, the Bauhaus and Surrealism. The collection owns masterpieces of artists like Pablo Picasso, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Joan Miró, Wassily Kandinsky and Barnett Newman.  The design of the building, despite its large site, allows for the display of only a small part of the collection, and the displays are therefore changed at intervals. In 2010 and most of 2011, the exhibitions covers the time period 1900–1945; from late 2011 post-war art will be the following exhibition.[tpl]cite web|title=New National Gallery|url=http://www.smb.museum/smb/standorte/index.php?p=2&objID=31&n=16|publisher=State Museums of Berlin|accessdate=9 May 2013[/tpl] 

==Architecture==

===Dimensions, specifications and materials===

The plan of the Neue Nationalgalerie is divided into two distinct stories. The upper story serves as an entrance hall as well as the primary special exhibit gallery, totaling 2,683 square meters of space. It is elevated from street level and only accessible by three flights of steps.[tpl]cite web|last=Pica|first=Agnoldomenico|title=Less Is Forever|url=http://www.domusweb.it/en/from-the-archive/2011/03/28/less-is-forever.html|publisher=Domus|accessdate=9 May 2013[/tpl]  Though it only comprises a small portion of the total gallery space, the exhibition pavilion stands boldly as the building’s primary architectural expression. Eight cruciform columns, two on each length placed so as to avoid corners, support a square pre-stressed steel roof plate 1.8 meters thick and painted black. An eighteen-meter cantilever allows for ample space between the gallery’s glazed façade and eight supporting columns. Mies’ office studied this cantilever extensively in various scaled models in order to ensure its structural stability as well as the seeming flatness of the roof plate. The floor-to-ceiling height reaches 8.4 meters, and the space is laid out on a 3.6-meter square dimensional grid. Black anodized aluminum “egg crates” fit within the grid house lighting fixtures, with air ducts suspended above. The lower story serves primarily as housing for the gallery’s permanent collection, though it also includes a library, offices, and a shop and café, and totals about 10,000 square meters of space. It is three quarters below ground so as to allow for safe storage of the artwork, its sole glazed façade looking out on the museum’s sloping sculpture garden and providing ample indirect interior lighting.  A rooftop plaza further extends the museum’s exhibition space.[tpl]cite book|last=Lambert|first=Phyllis|title=Mies in America|year=2001|publisher=Canadian Centre for Architecture|location=Montreal|page=475[/tpl] 

===Contemporaneous projects===

In 1956, José M. Bosch, President of Ron Bacardí y Compañía approached Mies to commission the design of a new office space. He was particularly interested in a very open plan, and the relatively simple idea Mies came up with involved a square roof plate supported on each side by two columns. Though initial structural challenges had to be dealt with, the resulting pavilion typology became integral to Mies’ architectural lexicon, in many ways the epitome of his universal conception of space. Unfortunately, the Bacardí Building was abandoned in September 1960 due to general political unrest in Cuba, but at the same time, two other museum commissions were brought to Mies’ office. Georg Schaefer, a wealthy industrialist living in Schweinfurt approached Mies about the construction of a museum for his nineteenth-century art collection during the summer of 1960. A modest initial plan was drawn for the structure, but later that year Mies decided to reconfigure the unbuilt Bacardí project to fit Schaefer’s program as he wished to see it built. Consequently, a scaled-down model of the Bacardí project this time rendered in steel rather than concrete was created. In March of 1961, Mies also received a letter from the Senator for Building and Housing in Berlin, inviting him to build what was to be called the Neue Nationalgalerie, an exhibition space for the states collection of early twentieth-century art. The two museum projects, though slightly different in scale, where to be essentially identical in form, both a version in steel of the original Barcardí design. Though the Schweinfurt project never came to fruition, the reductive exercise of continual reconfiguration allowed for the perfection of Mies' expression in Berlin, and the Neue Nationalgalerie remains as the sole built form of the initial tripartite conception.[tpl]cite book|last=Lambert|first=Phyllis|title=Mies in America|year=2001|publisher=Canadian Centre for Architecture|location=Montreal|page=488[/tpl] 

===Aesthetic Importance===

Much of Mies’ syntactical development throughout the three building progression leading up to the Neue Nationalgalerie was prefigured in an earlier project for a Museum for a Small City. This project was published in a special May 1943 edition of Architectural Forum. In his publication, Mies describes a seemingly floating roof plane, suspended above a single clear-span space punctuated by equidistant columns. This project is now seen as a significant move on Mies’ part toward the alleviation of interior space by both defining and minimizing structural enclosure, thus joining exterior and interior space in a meaningful way. The structure itself, a composite of little more than ground plane, support and roof, thus becomes the building. The aesthetic importance of the clear-span was directly related to Mies’ conception of museum space in general, a “defining, rather than confining space.”[tpl]cite book|last=Blaser|first=Werner|title=Mies van der Rohe: Furniture and Interiors|year=1982|publisher=Academy Editions|location=London|page=94[/tpl] The completely open nature of the plan also serves to eliminate the barrier between art and community, simultaneously breaking down the reverence enacted by severely partitioned spaces and inviting interaction between viewer and art.[tpl]cite book|last=Blaser|first=Werner|title=Mies van der Rohe: Furniture and Interiors|year=1982|publisher=Academy Editions|location=London|page=94[/tpl] The overall aesthetic affect is thus one of vitalizing liberation.[tpl]cite book|last=Lambert|first=Phyllis|title=Mies in America|year=2001|publisher=Canadian Centre for Architecture|location=Montreal|page=499[/tpl] This infinitely transformative capability and universality is also seen in Mies’ buildings from the interveneing years, namely the Farnsworth House in Plano, Illinois, and Crown Hall of the Illinois Institute of Technology campus. Various commentators have recognized the structure’s ties to classical building, seeing it as a modern temple whose monumental simplicity evinces the immense skill behind its design and conception.[tpl]cite book|last=Lambert|first=Phyllis|title=Mies In America|year=2001|publisher=Canadian Centre for Architecture|location=Montreal|page=489[/tpl]

==Criticism==

The ability of clearly articulated external structures to alleviate façades and create large-scale universal spaces required certain boldness on the part of the client. The ineffable expression of the Neue Nationalgalerie’s entrance pavilion had certain logistical downsides. Its smooth granite flooring reflects the warm natural light that floods the space, creating hazy shadow and making curatorial efforts notoriously complicated.[tpl]cite book|last=Lambert|first=Phyllis|title=Mies in America|year=2001|publisher=Canadian Centre for Architecture|location=Montreal|page=497[/tpl] The singular expression of the pavilion space also relegated the lower story to a secondary position, presenting further difficulties for the display of artwork involving a lack of natural lighting and relatively pedestrian layout of viewing space.[tpl]cite web|title=New National Galery|url=http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/New_National_Gallery.html|publisher=Artifice, Inc.|accessdate=9 May 2013[/tpl] When asked later to renovate and expand the building’s lower story, Mies refused, as to do so would destroy the perfect proportions of the temple above.[tpl]cite web|last=Glynn|first=Simon|title=Neue Nationalgalerie (New National Gallery)|url=http://www.galinsky.com/buildings/neuenationalgalerie/index.htm|publisher=Galinsky|accessdate=9 May 2013[/tpl] He originally conceived of the entrance pavilion as a place for very large works, allowing for unencumbered visual interaction and for use of the piece as space element in itself.[tpl]cite book|last=Blaser|first=Werner|title=Mies van der Rohe: Furniture and Interiors|year=1982|publisher=Academy Editions|location=London|page=94[/tpl] An early collage included in the May 1943 Architectural Forum article about Museum for a Small City includes Picasso’s Guernica, along with other large, plane-like paintings.[tpl]cite book|last=Lambert|first=Phyllis|title=Mies in America|year=2001|publisher=Canadian Centre for Architecture|location=Montreal|page=426[/tpl] Yet smaller works had to be shown on moveable freestanding walls or hanging partitions, making a curator’s ability to effectively differentiate spaces difficult.[tpl]cite book|last=Blaser|first=Werner|title=Mies van der Rohe: Furniture and Interiors|year=1982|publisher=Academy Editions|location=London|page=94[/tpl]  

==Future renovation==

The Neue Nationalgalerie has had no thorough modernization since its inauguration. In 2012 it was announced that British architect David Chipperfield will oversee a major renovation of the building. In a non-competitive selection processes common for public contracts in Germany, his firm was chosen for the contract out of 24 architectural firms based on a two-stage negotiation process. The museum requires new security and fire technology and the shop and cafe will be renovated. The renovation will start in 2015 and last three years, during which time the museum will be closed.Catherine Hickley (March 29, 2012), David Chipperfield to Renovate Berlin’s Neue Nationalgalerie Bloomberg.

==Art installations==

The New National Gallery's ceiling, constructed as a grid of black-painted steel beams, has been used as an exhibit surface in itself for Installation for the Neue Nationalgalerie, an installation of long lines of LCD displays by artist Jenny Holzer in 2001, which continuously scrolled abstract patterns down their length.
The New National Gallery's terrace provides a particularly prominent space for large-scale pieces of sculpture from the 20th century. Permanently installed sculptures include Gudari (1957) by Eduardo Chillida, Polis (1968) by Joannis Avramidis, the kinetic metal sculpture Vier Vierecke im Geviert (1969) by George Rickey, Three Way Piece No.2: The Archer (1964-65) by Henry Moore, Têtes et Queue (1965) by Alexander Calder, and Berlin Block Charlie Chaplin (1978) by Richard Serra. In 2003, with the permission of the Barnett Newman Foundation, a fourth edition of the sculpture Broken Obelisk (1963) by Barnett Newman was cast and temporarily installed in front of the museum. In 2011, Thomas Schütte's work Vater Staat (2010) was donated by Nicolas Berggruen and installed on the terrace.Thomas Schütte’s ‘Vater Staat’ on the forecourt terrace of the New National Gallery, Press Release of July 6, 2011 Staatliche Museen zu Berlin. Many other pieces of sculpture - by artists from Auguste Renoir to Ulrich Rückriem - are on permanent display in the museum's garden.Neue Nationalgalerie - Collection Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.
