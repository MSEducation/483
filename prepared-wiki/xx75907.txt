==Present and historical use of the motto==

The motto of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, the Scottish chivalrous order, is also that of the British Army regiments The Royal Regiment of Scotland, Scots Guards and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. It was also the motto of several former units of the British Army, including the Royal Scots, Royal Scots Greys, Royal Highland Fusiliers and Black Watch, some of which went on to be amalgamated to form the Royal Regiment of Scotland in 2006. The motto is also that of the Royal Company of Archers and has been displayed upon the unit's second standard since 1713, following the grant of a Royal charter by Queen Anne.
During the reign of Charles II,[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] the motto, appearing on a scroll under the shield and overlying the compartment, was added to the Royal coat of arms of Scotland and, since 1707,[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] has appeared in the Scottish version of the arms of British Monarchs, including the present Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom used in Scotland.

==Possible origin of the motto==

It has been suggested that the phrase was originally used by Julius Caesar as he was attacked by the Roman Senate.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2011[/tpl] However, according to legend, the "guardian thistle" (see Scotch thistle) played a vital part in the defence of the ancient realm of Scotland against a night attack by Norwegian Vikings, one of whom let out a yell of pain when he stepped on a prickly thistle, thus alerting the Scottish defenders. In the motto "No-one harasses me with impunity" (Latin: "Nemo me impune lacessit"), "me" was therefore originally the thistle itself, but by extension now refers to the Scottish regiments which have adopted it.
The modern form of the motto was used by Francesco I, Duke of Milan and had been used in Britain on the colours of the Scottish Royalist officer John Urry during the English Civil War.Ian Gentles, "The Iconography of Revolution: England 1642–1649," in Soldiers, Writers and Statesmen of the English Revolution, edited by Ian Gentles, John Morrill & Blair Worden, pp. 91–113 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998) p. 100. It was also used by the Parliamentarian propagandist Marchamont Nedham as the motto for his newsletters.Ian Gentles, "The Iconography of Revolution: England 1642–1649," p. 100, note 34.
Another traditional source appears in the form of a Scots proverb; "Ye maunna tramp on the Scotch thistle, laddie", this being immortalised in marble by Glasgow monumental sculptors James Gibson & Co. for the Kelvingrove International Exhibition of 1888.Glasgow - City of Sculpture, by Gary Nisbet The phrase "Wha daur meddle wi' me?" also appears in a traditional border ballad entitled "Little Jock Elliot",Jedburgh Online - Border Ballads which recalls the exploits of a 16th-century border reiver, ('John Elliot of the Park'), with particular reference to an infamous encounter in the summer of 1566 with James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell,Lord Bothwell the third husband of Mary, Queen of Scots.
The French city of Nancy has a similar motto, Non inultus premor ("I cannot be touched unavenged"), also a reference to the thistle, which is the symbol of the region of Lorraine.
