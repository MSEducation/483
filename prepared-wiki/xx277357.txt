[[Smooth Radio presenter history]]

CATEGORIES: Smooth Radio

The presenter history of Smooth Radio includes many well-known British radio personalities who made their names on networks such as Radio 1, Radio 2, and other stations. The Smooth Radio brand began life in 2004 with the Manchester-based 100.4 Smooth FM, and gradually expanded to encompass a number of regional stations; these were subsumed into a UK-wide station in 2010. The regional stations were reintroduced in 2014.
Several prominent broadcasters and disc jockeys have been recruited to the line-up. Current and former presenters on Smooth include Emma B, Simon Bates, Tony Blackburn, Paul Coia, Kate Garraway, Mark Goodier, Kevin Greening, David Jensen, Myleene Klass, Lynn Parsons, Andy Peebles and Graham Torrington. As a national broadcaster, the station's flagship breakfast show was presented by Simon Bates, who left Classic FM after more than a decade to join Smooth. Breakfast and Drivetime shows are currently fronted by a number of regional presenters. In addition, Smooth has also played featured one-off specials presented by personalities such as Russell Grant, Denise Van Outen and Dionne Warwick.
