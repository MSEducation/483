Aluminium composite panel (ACP) also aluminium composite material, (ACM) is a type of flat panel that consists of two thin aluminium sheets bonded to a non-aluminium core. ACPs are frequently used for external cladding or facades of buildings, insulation, and signage.
Aluminium sheets can be coated with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), fluoropolymer resins (FEVE), or polyester paint. Aluminium can be painted in any kind of colour, and ACPs are produced in a wide range of metallic and non-metallic colours as well as patterns that imitate other materials, such as wood or marble. The core is commonly low density polyethylene, or a mix of low density polyethylene and mineral material to exhibit fire retardant properties.
3A Composites (formerly Alcan Composites & Alusuisse) invented aluminium composites over 40 years ago[tpl]clarify|date=April 2014[/tpl] with Alucobond, followed by Dibond 20 years ago, all other grades are in effect copies.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

==Applications==

ACP is mainly used for external and internal architectural cladding or partitions, false ceilings, signage, machine coverings, container construction etc. Applications of ACP are not limited to external building cladding, but can also be used in any form of cladding such as partitions, false ceilings etc. ACP is also widely used within the signage industry as an alternative to heavier, more expensive substrates.
ACP has been used as a light-weight but very sturdy material in construction, particularly for transient structures like trade show booths and similar temporary elements. It has recently also been adopted as a backing material for mounting fine art photography, often with an acrylic finish using processes like Diasec or other face-mounting techniques. ACP material has been used in famous structures as Spaceship Earth, VanDusen Botanical Garden, the Leipzig branch of the German National Library.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.alucobond.com/a2-product-properties.html |publisher=Alucobond |title=ALUCOBOND® A2 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-01-31[/tpl]
These structures made optimal use of ACP through its cost, durability and efficiency. Its flexibility, low weight and easy forming and processing allow for innovative design with increased rigidity and durability.

==Other names==

Many people use Dibond or sandwich panel as a generic name (genericized trademark) for aluminum composite panels that are typically 0.3 to 0.5 mm thick aluminum sheets covering a solid polyethylene core with a total thickness of 3 mm or more, or similar panels from any manufacturer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aluminiumcomposite.co.uk/dibond.htm |title=The original aluminium composite is Dibond |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-01-31[/tpl]
A variety of manufacturers sell aluminium composite panels under a wide variety of brand names, including:

Some people use sandwich panel for any structural sandwich (sandwich-structured composite) of a core bonded between two cover sheets,
no matter what material(s) it is made of, and no matter if the core is solid, foam, flutes, or honeycomb.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.alcoa.com/fastening_systems/aerospace/catalog/pdf/AFS_Delron_honeycomb_sandwich_panels_08_2011.pdf |format=pdf |title=Delron Inserts for Honeycomb and Sandwich Panels |deadurl=no|accessdate=2013-01-31[/tpl]
