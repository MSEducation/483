In 1884 a submarine communications cable was laid between Europe, Africa, India and North America, making Mindelo an important communications centre for the British Empire. 
The shift from coal to oil as fuel for ships after 1900 caused the decline of Mindelo. Unemployment and poverty struck the island, even worsened by famines and the economical crisis of the 1930s. Many inhabitants emigrated. With independence, the city gained more prominence and has seen steady growth.
