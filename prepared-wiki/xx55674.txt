The Star Trek character Hikaru Sulu is named after the Sulu Sea. According to Sulu actor George Takei, "Gene Roddenberry's vision for Sulu was to represent all of Asia, being named for the Sulu Sea instead of using a specific country-specific name".[tpl]cite web|url=http://trekmovie.com/2010/07/25/video-george-takei-on-star-trek-vi-captain-sulu-to-the-rescue-john-cho-shatner-feud-more/|title=George Takei On "Star Trek VI: Captain Sulu To The Rescue" + John Cho, Shatner Feud + more|last=Pascale|first=Anthony|publisher=TrekMovie.com|accessdate=26 July 2010[/tpl]
