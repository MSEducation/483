==Service history==

YP-422 was briefly commanded by L. Ron Hubbard, later known as the controversial founder of Scientology, who supervised the conversion in his capacity as a US Navy lieutenant.  He was assigned to Lawley and Sons shipyard in connection with the conversion of the YP-422 from 25 June to 28 July 1942.  He was relieved of his command on 1 October 1942, a few weeks after YP-422 underwent a 27-hour training exercise in August 1942. A dispatch sent by the Commandant of the Boston Navy Yard described Hubbard as "not temperamentally fitted for independent command".[tpl]cite book|last=Atack|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Atack|title=A Piece of Blue Sky|page=74|publisher=Carol Publishing Group|year=1990|isbn=0-8184-0499-X[/tpl]
