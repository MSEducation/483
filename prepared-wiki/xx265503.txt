[[Jola-Felupe language]]

CATEGORIES: Languages of Senegal, Jola languages

Ejamat (Ediamat), or Jola-Felupe (Feloup, Felup, Felupe, Floup, Flup, Fulup) is a Jola language of the Casamance region of Senegal and neighboring Guinea-Bissau.
Kerak (Keerak, Keeraku; also Her) appears to be a dialect, though Ethnologue assigns it a separate ISO code due to early survey work which suggested it was more distinct.
