CATEGORIES: Maratha Empire, Hindu rituals

Indrabhisheka was a ceremony performed by Indian kings and mentioned in the Aiteraya Brahmanas.Gaṅgā Rām Garg., Encyclopaedia of the Hindu world, Volume 1 Encyclopaedia of the Hindu world, Volume 1 By Gaṅgā Rām Garg

==History==

With the loss of political power to the Turks and collapse of tradition, Indrabhishek ceremony was relegated to the background. The Yadavas and Chauhans were the last to perform a coronation but whether they performed Indrabhishek ceremony is not clear. Shivaji revived it. Gagabhat wrote a detailed book on the procedure. Accordingly it was then performed. A thread ceremony, Upanayanam, of Shivaji took place on May 29, 1674, and then a Vratya Stoma ceremony was performed.

==Subaltern view==

Some historians attribute the need for the coronation to resentment by the other Maratha Deccan nobles of Shivaji's success (he being a Bhosale) and his taking a higher seat than them at state dinners.Vaidya, C.V., History of Mediaeval India Shivaji claimed he was of the line of Vishwamitra in his danpatra (donation).Prof.Bhagat, Datta., Sabhasad Written Shiv Charitra (Edited) Late nineteenth century theories are not valid.

==Legacy==

Modern interpretations vary, but this coronation ceremony created a legacy. After the death of Shivaji, Marathas fought the mughals and defeated them in the war of 27 years. This demonstrated that coronation was an instrument of sovereignty valid in other parts of the world.
