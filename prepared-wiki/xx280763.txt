[[The Saint Helena Journal of General Baron Gourgaud]]

CATEGORIES: Napoleon, 1899 books

The Saint Helena Journal of General Baron Gourgaud is a private journal written down by Gaspard Gourgaud as a result of his conversations with  Napoleon I of France between June 1815 and March 1818 during the former's exile on Saint Helena.
According to Lord Rosebery "The one capital and superior record of life at St.  Helena is the private journal of General Gourgaud. It  was written, in the main at least, for his own eye, without 
flattery or even prejudice. It is sometimes almost brutal in its realism. He alone of all the chroniclers strove to be accurate, and on the whole succeeded."
This journal, which consists of about twelve hundred printed pages, was not published until 1899.
