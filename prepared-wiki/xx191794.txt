[[Beltrami identity]]

CATEGORIES: Calculus of variations

The Beltrami identity, named after Eugenio Beltrami, is a simplified and less general version of the Euler–Lagrange equation in the calculus of variations.
The Euler–Lagrange equation serves to extremize action  functionals of the form[tpl]cite book | authors = Courant R, Hilbert D | title = Methods of Mathematical Physics | volume = Vol. I | edition = First English | publisher = Interscience Publishers, Inc | year = 1953 | location = New York | page = 184 | accessdate = 2012-10-22 | isbn = 978-0471504474[/tpl] 
where [tpl]math|a, b[/tpl] are constants and [tpl]math|u′(x) [tpl]=[/tpl] du / dx[/tpl].
For the special case of [tpl]math|∂L / ∂x [tpl]=[/tpl] 0[/tpl], the Euler–Lagrange equation reduces to the Beltrami identity,Weisstein, Eric W. "Euler-Lagrange Differential Equation."  From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. See Eq. (5).

where [tpl]math|C[/tpl] is a constant.  Thus, the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian, the Hamiltonian, is constant on the dynamical path.

==Derivation==

The following derivation of the Beltrami identityThis derivation of the Beltrami identity corresponds to the one at — Weisstein, Eric W. "Beltrami Identity." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. starts with the Euler–Lagrange equation, 
Multiplying both sides by [tpl]math|u′[/tpl],
According to the chain rule,
where [tpl]math|u′′ [tpl]=[/tpl] du′/dx [tpl]=[/tpl] d2u / dx2[/tpl].
Rearranging this yields
Thus, substituting  this expression for [tpl]math|u′ ∂L/∂u[/tpl]  into the second equation of this derivation,  
By the product rule, the last term is re-expressed as
and rearranging,
For the case of [tpl]math|∂L / ∂x [tpl]=[/tpl] 0[/tpl], this reduces to 
so that taking the antiderivative results in the Beltrami identity,
where [tpl]math|C[/tpl] is a constant.

==Application==

An example of an application of the Beltrami identity  is the Brachistochrone problem, which involves finding the curve [tpl]math|y [tpl]=[/tpl] y(x)[/tpl] that minimizes the integral
The integrand 
does not depend explicitly on the variable of integration [tpl]math|x[/tpl], so the Beltrami identity applies,
Substituting for [tpl]math|L[/tpl] and simplifying,
which can be solved with the result put in the form of parametric equations 
with [tpl]math|A[/tpl] being half the above constant, 1/(2C ²), and [tpl]math|φ[/tpl] being a variable. These are the parametric equations for a cycloid.This solution of the Brachistochrone problem corresponds to the one in — [tpl]cite book | last1 = Mathews | first1 = Jon | last2 = Walker | first2 = RL | title = Mathematical Methods of Physics | publisher = W.
