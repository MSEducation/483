Akkadian (li≈°ƒÅnum akkadƒ´tum, [tpl]lang|akk|[tpl]linktext|íÖé|íÄù|íÇµ|íåà[/tpl][/tpl] ak.kAD√ª) (also Accadian, Assyro-Babylonian)Akkadian language - Britannica Online Encyclopedia is an extinct Semitic language (part of the greater Afroasiatic language family) that was spoken in ancient Mesopotamia. The earliest attested Semitic language,John Huehnergard and Christopher Woods, Akkadian and Eblaite, in Roger D. Woodard, ed., The Ancient Languages of Mesopotamia, Egypt and Aksum, Cambridge University Press, 2008, p.83 it used the cuneiform writing system, which was originally used to write ancient Sumerian, an unrelated language isolate.  The name of the language is derived from the city of Akkad, a major center of Semitic Mesopotamian civilization during the Akkadian Empire (ca. 2334‚Äì2154 BC), although the language predates the founding of Akkad.
The mutual influence between Sumerian and Akkadian had led scholars to describe the languages as a sprachbund.[tpl]cite book|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-953222-3|pages=20‚Äì21[/tpl]
Akkadian proper names were first attested in Sumerian texts from ca. the late 29th century BC.http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/3139/1/PAGE_31%2D71.pdf Andrew George, "Babylonian and Assyrian: A History of Akkadian", In: Postgate, J. N., (ed.), Languages of Iraq, Ancient and Modern. London: British School of Archaeology in Iraq, pp. 31-71. From the second half of the third millennium BC (ca. 2500 BC), texts fully written in Akkadian begin to appear. Hundreds of thousands of texts and text fragments have been excavated to date, covering a vast textual tradition of mythological narrative, legal texts, scientific works, correspondence, political and military events, and many other examples. By the second millennium BC, two variant forms of the language were in use in Assyria and Babylonia, known as Assyrian and Babylonian respectively.
Akkadian had been for centuries the lingua franca in Mesopotamia and the Ancient Near East. However, it began to decline around the 8th century BC, being marginalized by Aramaic during the Neo Assyrian Empire. By the Hellenistic period, the language was largely confined to scholars and priests working in temples in Assyria and Babylonia. The last Akkadian cuneiform document dates to the 1st century AD.Marckham Geller, "The Last Wedge," Zeitschrift f√ºr Assyriologie und vorderasitische Arch√§ologie 86 (1997): 43‚Äì95. A fair number of Akkadian loan words survive in the Mesopotamian Neo Aramaic dialects spoken in and around modern Iraq by the indigenous Assyrian (aka Chaldo-Assyrian) Christians of the region, and the giving of Akkadian personal names, along with a number of Akkadian last names and tribal names, is still common amongst Assyrian people.

==Classification==

Akkadian belongs with the other Semitic languages in the Near Eastnorth branch of the Afro-Asiatic family of languages, a language family native to Western Asia and Northern Africa.
Within the Near Eastern Semitic languages, Akkadian forms an East Semitic subgroup (with Eblaite). This group distinguishes itself from the Northwest and South Semitic languages by its SOV word order, while the other Semitic languages usually have either a VSO or SVO order. This novel word order is due to the influence of the Sumerian substratum, which has an SOV order.
Additionally Akkadian is the only Semitic language to use the prepositions ina and ana (locative, English in/on/with, and dative-locative, for/to, respectively). Other Semitic languages like Arabic and Aramaic have the prepositions bi/b…ô and li/l…ô (locative and dative, respectively). The origin of the Akkadian spatial prepositions is unknown.
In contrast to most other Semitic languages, Akkadian has only one non-sibilant fricative: [tpl]unicode|·∏´[/tpl] [tpl]IPA|x[/tpl]. Akkadian lost both the glottal and pharyngeal fricatives, which are characteristic of the other Semitic languages. Up until the Old Babylonian period, the Akkadian sibilants were exclusively affricate.

==History and writing==

===Writing===

Old Akkadian is preserved on clay tablets dating back to 2600 BC. It was written using cuneiform, a script adopted from the Sumerians using wedge-shaped symbols pressed in wet clay. As employed by Akkadian scribes, the adapted cuneiform script could represent either (a) Sumerian logograms (i.e., picture-based characters representing entire words), (b) Sumerian syllables, (c) Akkadian syllables, or (d) phonetic complements. However, in Akkadian the script practically became a fully fledged syllabic script, and the original logographic nature of cuneiform became secondary. However, logograms for frequent words such as 'god' and 'temple' were still used. For this reason, the sign AN can on the one hand be a logogram for the word ilum ('god') and on the other signify the god Anu or even the syllable -an-. Additionally, the sign was used as a determinative for divine names.
Example 4 in the image on the right shows another peculiarity of Akkadian cuneiform. Many signs do not have a well-defined phonetic value. Certain signs, such as [tpl]transl|sem|A·∏™[/tpl], do not distinguish between the different vowel qualities. Nor is there any coordination in the other direction; the syllable [tpl]transl|sem|-≈°a-[/tpl], for example, is rendered by the sign [tpl]transl|sem|≈†A[/tpl], but also by the sign [tpl]transl|sem|Nƒ™ƒú[/tpl]. Both of these are often used for the same syllable in the same text.
Cuneiform was in many ways unsuited to Akkadian: among its flaws was its inability to represent important phonemes in Semitic, including a glottal stop, pharyngeals, and emphatic consonants. In addition, cuneiform was a syllabary writing system‚Äîi.e., a consonant plus vowel comprised one writing unit‚Äîfrequently inappropriate for a Semitic language made up of triconsonantal roots (i.e., three consonants plus any vowels).

===Development===

Akkadian is divided into several varieties based on geography and historical period:Caplice, p.5 (1980)
The earliest known Akkadian inscription was found on a bowl at Ur, addressed to the very early pre-Sargonic king Meskiang-nuna of Ur by his queen Gan-saman, who is thought to have been from Akkad.
The Akkadian Empire, established by Sargon of Akkad, introduced the Akkadian language (the "language of Akkad") as a written language, adapting Sumerian cuneiform orthography for the purpose. During the Middle Bronze Age (Old Assyrian and Old Babylonian period), the language virtually displaced Sumerian, which is assumed to have been extinct as a living language by the 18th century BC.
Old Akkadian, which was used until the end of the 3rd millennium BC, differs from both Babylonian and Assyrian, and was displaced by these dialects. By the 21st century BC Babylonian and Assyrian, which were to become the primary dialects, were easily distinguishable. Old Babylonian, along with the closely related dialect Mariotic, is clearly more innovative than the Old Assyrian dialect and the more distantly related Eblaite language. For this reason, forms like lu-prus ('I will decide') are first encountered in Old Babylonian instead of the older la-prus (even though it was archaic compared to Akkadian). On the other hand, Assyrian developed certain innovations as well, such as the "Assyrian vowel harmony" (which is not comparable to that found in Turkish or Finnish). Eblaite is even more archaic, retaining a productive dual and a relative pronoun declined in case, number and gender. Both of these had already disappeared in Old Akkadian.
Old Babylonian was the language of king Hammurabi and his code, which is one of the oldest collections of laws in the world.  (see Code of Ur-Nammu.)
The Middle Babylonian (or Assyrian) period started in the 16th century BC. The division is marked by the Kassite invasion of Babylonia around 1550 BC. The Kassites, who reigned for 300 years, gave up their own language in favor of Akkadian, but they had little influence on the language. At its apogee, Middle Babylonian was the written language of diplomacy of the entire ancient Orient, including Egypt. During this period, a large number of loan words were included in the language from North West Semitic languages and Hurrian; however, the use of these words was confined to the fringes of the Akkadian speaking territory.
Middle Assyrian served as a lingua franca in much of the Ancient Near East of the Late Bronze Age (Amarna Period). During the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Neo-Assyrian began to turn into a chancellery language, being marginalized by Old Aramaic. Under the Achaemenids, Aramaic continued to prosper, but Assyrian continued its decline. The language's final demise came about during the Hellenistic period when it was further marginalized by Koine Greek, even though Neo-Assyrian cuneiform remained in use in literary tradition well into Parthian times. The latest known text in cuneiform Babylonian is an astronomical text dated to 75 AD.Adkins 2003, p.¬†47. The youngest texts written in Akkadian date from the 3rd century AD. A number of Akkadian words and many personal names survive to this day in the modern Assyrian (or Neo Aramaic) language spoken by ethnic Assyrians (aka Chaldo-Assyrians)in Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey.
Old Assyrian developed as well during the second millennium BC, but because it was a purely popular language ‚Äî kings wrote in Babylonian ‚Äî few long texts are preserved. From 1500 BC onwards, the language is termed Middle Assyrian.
During the first millennium BC, Akkadian progressively lost its status as a lingua franca. In the beginning, from around 1000 BC, Akkadian and Aramaic were of equal status, as can be seen in the number of copied texts: clay tablets were written in Akkadian, while scribes writing on papyrus and leather used Aramaic. From this period on, one speaks of Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian. Neo-Assyrian received an upswing in popularity in the 10th century BC when the Assyrian kingdom became a major power with the Neo Assyrian Empire, but texts written 'exclusively' in Neo-Assyrian disappear within 10 years of Nineveh's destruction in 612 BC.
After the end of the Mesopotamian kingdoms, which fell due to the Persian conquest of the area, Akkadian (which existed solely in the form of Late Babylonian) disappeared as a popular language. However, the language was still used in its written form; and even after the Greek invasion under Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC, Akkadian was still a contender as a written language, but spoken Akkadian was likely extinct by this time, or at least rarely used.  The latest positively identified Akkadian text comes from the 1st century AD.John Huehnergard & Christopher Woods, 2004 "Akkadian and Eblaite", The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the World's Ancient Languages, pg. 218.

===Decipherment===

The Akkadian language began to be rediscovered when Carsten Niebuhr in 1767 was able to make extensive copies of cuneiform texts and published them in Denmark. The deciphering of the texts started immediately, and bilinguals, in particular Old Persian-Akkadian bilinguals, were of great help. Since the texts contained several royal names, isolated signs could be identified, and were presented in 1802 by Georg Friedrich Grotefend. By this time it was already evident that Akkadian was a Semitic language, and the final breakthrough in deciphering the language came from Henry Rawlinson in the middle of the 19th century.

===Dialects===

The following table summarises the dialects of Akkadian certainly identified so far.
The status of [tpl]unicode|*≈°[/tpl] as postalveolar and of [tpl]unicode|*z *s *·π£[/tpl] as fricatives is contested, for instance by KoganKogan, Leonid (2011). "Proto-Semitic Phonetics and Phonology". In Semitic languages: an international handbook, Stefan Weninger, ed. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. p. 68. and Dolgopolsky, due to attested assimilations of voiceless coronal affricates to [tpl]unicode|*s[/tpl]. For example, when the possessive suffix [tpl]unicode|-≈°u[/tpl] is added to the root [tpl]unicode|awat[/tpl] ('word'), it is written [tpl]unicode|awassu[/tpl] ('his word') even though [tpl]unicode|≈°≈°[/tpl] would be expected. What triggered the change from [tpl]unicode|t≈°[/tpl] to [tpl]unicode|ss[/tpl] is unclear, especially since a shift of [tpl]unicode|≈°[/tpl] to [tpl]unicode|s[/tpl] does not occur in other contexts.
According to Patrick R. Bennett's "Comparative Semitic Linguistics: a manual", the *≈° was a voiceless alveolo-palatal. In the pronunciation of an alveolo-palatal, the tongue approximates the teeth more closely.
An alternative approach to the phonology of these consonants is to treat *s *·π£ as voiceless coronal affricates [tpl]IPA|tÕ°s º[/tpl], *≈° as a voiceless coronal fricative [tpl]IPA|s[/tpl] and *z as a voiced coronal affricate or fricative [tpl]IPA|dÕ°z~z[/tpl]. In this vein, an alternative transcription of *≈° is *sÃ†, with the macron below indicating a soft (lenis) articulation in Semitic transcription. The assimilation is then awat-su to [tpl]IPA|awatÕ°su[/tpl], which is quite common across languages.
The following table shows Proto-Semitic phonemes and their correspondences among Akkadian, Arabic and Tiberian Hebrew:

===Vowels===

Translation: This man is a thief
(2) ≈°arrum lƒÅ ≈°anƒÅn
Translation: The king who cannot be rivaled
The Status Constructus is a great deal more common, and has a much wider range of applications. It is employed when a noun is followed by another noun in the genitive, a pronominal suffix, or a verbal clause in the subjunctive, and typically takes the shortest form of the noun which is phonetically possible. In general, this amounts to the loss of case endings with short vowels, with the exception of the genitive -i in nouns preceding a pronominal suffix, hence:
(3) mƒÅri-≈°u
Translation: His son, its (masculine) son
but
(4) mƒÅr ≈°arr-im
Translation: The king's son
There are numerous exceptions to this general rule, usually involving potential violations of the language's phonological limitations. Most obviously, Akkadian does not tolerate word final consonant clusters, so nouns like kalbum (dog) and ma·∏´rum (front) would have illegal construct state forms *kalb and *ma·∏´r unless modified. In many of these instances, the first vowel of the word is simply repeated (e.g. kalab, ma·∏´ar). This rule, however, does not always hold true, especially in nouns where a short vowel has historically been elided (e.g. ≈°aknum (5) kalab belim
Translation: The master's dog
(6) sakin ƒÅlim
A genitive relation can also be expressed with the relative preposition ≈°a, and the noun that the genitive phrase depends on appears in status rectus.
(7) salƒ´mƒÅtum ≈°a awƒ´l E≈°nunna
Translation: The alliances of the Ruler of E≈°nunna (literally "Alliances which man of E≈°nunna (has)")
The same preposition is also used to introduce true relative clauses, in which case the verb is placed in the subjunctive mood.
(7) awƒ´l-um ≈°a mƒÅt-am i-k≈°ud-√ò-u
Translation: The man who conquered the land

====Verbal morphology====

=====Verb aspects=====

The Akkadian verb has six finite verb aspects (preterite,  perfect, present, imperative, precative and vetitive) and three infinite forms (infinitive, participle and verbal adjective). The preterite is used for actions that are seen by the speaker as having occurred at a single point in time. The present is primarily imperfective in meaning and is used for concurrent and future actions as well as past actions with a temporal dimension. The final three finite forms are injunctive where the imperative and the precative together form a paradigm for positive commands and wishes, and the vetitive is used for negative wishes. Additionally the periphrastic prohibitive, formed by the present form of the verb and the negative adverb lƒÅ, is used to express negative commands. The infinitive of the Akkadian verb is a verbal noun, and in contrast to some other languages the Akkadian infinitive can be declined in case. The verbal adjective is an adjectival form and designates the state or the result of the action of the verb, and consequently the exact meaning of the verbal adjective is determined by the semantics of the verb itself. The participle, which can be active or passive, is another verbal adjective and its meaning is similar to the English gerund.
The following table shows the conjugation of the G-stem verbs derived from the root PRS ("to decide") in the various verb aspects of Akkadian:
The table below shows the different affixes attached to the preterite aspect of the verb root PRS "to decide"; and as can be seen, the grammatical genders differ only in the second person singular and third person plural.

=====Verb moods=====

Akkadian verbs have 3 moods:
The following table demonstrates the verb moods of verbs derived from the root PRS ("to decide","to separate"):

=====Verb patterns=====

Akkadian verbs have thirteen separate root stems. The basic, underived, stem is the G-stem (from the German Grundstamm, meaning "basic stem"). Causative or intensive forms are formed with the doubled D-stem, and it gets its name from the doubled middle radical that is characteristic of this form. The doubled middle radical is also characteristic of the present, but the forms of the D-stem use the secondary conjugational affixes, so a D-form will never be identical to a form in a different stem. The ≈†-stem is formed by adding a prefix ≈°-, and these forms are mostly causatives. Finally, the passive forms of the verb are in the N-stem, formed by adding a n- prefix. However the n- element is assimilated to a following consonant, so the original /n/ is only visible in a few forms.
Furthermore, reflexive and iterative verbal stems can be derived from each of the basic stems. The reflexive stem is formed with an infix -ta, and the derived stems are therefore called Gt, Dt, ≈†t and Nt, and the preterite forms of the Xt-stem are identical to the perfects of the X-stem. Iteratives are formed with the infix -tan-, giving the Gtn, Dtn, ≈†tn and Ntn. Because of the assimilation of n, the /n/ is only seen in the present forms, and the Xtn preterite is identical to the Xt durative.
An alternative to this naming system is a numerical system. The basic stems are numbered using Roman numerals so that G, D, ≈† and N become I, II, III and IV, respectively, and the infixes are numbered using Arabic numerals; 1 for the forms without an infix, 2 for the Xt, and 3 for the Xtn. The two numbers are separated using a solidus. As an example, the ≈†tn-stem is called III/3. The most important user of this system is the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary.
There is mandatory congruence between the subject of the sentence and the verb, and this is expressed by prefixes and suffixes. There are two different sets of affixes, a primary set used for the forms of the G and N-stems, and a secondary set for the D and ≈†-stems.
The stems, their nomenclature and examples of the third-person masculine singular stative of the verb parƒÅsum (root PRS: 'to decide, distinguish, separate') is shown below:

===Stative===

A very often appearing form which can be formed by nouns, adjectives as well as by verbal adjectives is the stative. Nominal predicatives occur in the status absolutus and correspond to the verb "to be" in English. The stative in Akkadian corresponds to the Egyptian pseudo-participle. The following table contains an example of using the noun ≈°arrum (king), the adjective rap≈°um (wide) and the verbal adjective parsum (decided).
Thus, the stative in Akkadian is used to convert simple stems into effective sentences, so that the form ≈°arr-ƒÅta is equivalent to: "you were king", "you are king" and "you will be king". Hence, the stative is independent of time forms.

===Derivation===

Beside the already explained possibility of derivation of different verb stems, Akkadian has numerous nominal formations derived from verb roots. A very frequently encountered form is the maPRaS form. It can express the location of an event, the person performing the act and many other meanings. If one of the root consonants is labial (p, b, m), the prefix becomes na- (maPRaS > naPRAS).  Examples for this are: ma≈°kanum (place, location) from ≈†KN (set, place, put), ma≈°ra·∏´um (splendour) from ≈†R·∏™ (be splendid), ma·π£·π£arum (guards) from N·π¢R (guard), nap·∏´arum (sum) from  P·∏™R (summarize).
A very similar formation is the maPRaSt form. The noun derived from this nominal formation is grammatically feminine. The same rules as for the maPRaS form apply, for example ma≈°kattum (deposit) from ≈†KN (set, place, put), narkabtum (carriage) from RKB (ride, drive, mount).
The suffix - ≈´t is used to derive abstract nouns. The nouns which are formed with this suffix are grammatically feminine. The suffix can be attached to nouns, adjectives and verbs, e.g. ab≈´tum (paternity) from abum (father), rabutum (size) from rabum (large), wa·π£≈´tum (leaving) from W·π¢Y (leave).
Also derivatives of verbs from nouns, adjectives and numerals are numerous. For the most part, a D-stem is derived from the root of the noun or adjective. The derived verb then has the meaning of "make X do something" or "becoming X", for example: du≈°≈°√ªm (let sprout) from di≈°u (grass), ≈°ullu≈°um (to do something for the third time ) from ≈°alƒÅ≈° (three).

===Pronouns===

====Personal pronouns====

=====Independent personal pronouns=====

Independent personal pronouns in Akkadian are as follows:

=====Suffixed (or enclitic) pronouns=====

Suffixed (or enclitic) pronouns (mainly denoting the genitive, accusative and dative) are as follows:

====Demonstrative pronouns====

Demonstrative pronouns in Akkadian differ from the Western Semitic variety. The following table shows the Akkadian demonstrative pronouns according to near and far deixis:

====Relative pronouns====

Relative pronouns in Akkadian are shown in the following table:
Unlike plural relative pronouns, singular relative pronouns in Akkadian exhibit full declension for case. However, only the form ≈°a (originally accusative masculine singular) survived, while the other forms disappeared in time.

====Interrogative pronouns====

The following table shows the Interrogative pronouns used in Akkadian:

===Prepositions===

Akkadian has prepositions which consist mainly of only one word. For example: ina (in, on, out, through, under), ana (too, for, after, approximately), adi (to), a≈°≈°u (because of), eli (up, over), i≈°tu/ultu (of, since), mala (in accordance with), itti (also, with). There are, however, some compound prepositions which are combined with ina and ana (e.g. ina ma·∏´ar (forwards), ina balu (without), ana ·π£ƒìr (up to), ana ma·∏´ar (forwards). Regardless of the complexity of the preposition, the following noun is always in the genitive case.
Examples: ina bƒ´tim (in the house, from the house), ana dummuqim (to do good), itti ≈°arrim (with the king), ana ·π£ƒìr mƒÅrƒ´≈°u (up to his son).

===Numerals===

Since numerals are written mostly as a number sign in the cuneiform script, the transliteration of many numerals is not well ascertained yet. Along with the counted noun, the cardinal numerals are in the status absolutus. Because other cases are very rare, the forms of the status rectus are known only by isolated numerals. The numerals 1 and 2 as well as 21‚Äì29, 31‚Äì39, 41‚Äì49 correspond with the counted in the grammatical gender, while the numerals 3‚Äì20, 30, 40 and 50 show gender polarity, i.e. if the counted noun is masculine, the numeral would be feminine and vice versa. This polarity is typical of the Semitic languages and appears also in classical Arabic for example. The numerals 60, 100 and 1000 do not change according to the gender of the counted noun. Counted nouns more than two appear in the plural form. However, body parts which occur in pairs appear in the dual form  in Akkadian. e.g. ≈°epum (foot) becomes ≈°epƒÅn (two feet).
The ordinals are formed (with a few exceptions) by adding a case ending to the nominal form PaRuS (the P, R and S. must be substituted with the suitable consonants of the numeral). It is noted, however, that in the case of the numeral "one", the ordinal (masculine) and the cardinal number are the same. A metathesis occurs in the numeral "four". The following table contains the masculine and feminine forms of the status absolutus of some of the Akkadian cardinal numbers, as well as the corresponding ordinals.
Examples: erbƒì a≈°≈°ƒÅtum (four wives) (male numeral), me æat ƒÅlƒÅn≈´ (100 towns).

===Syntax===

====Nominal phrases====

Adjectives, relative clauses and appositions follow the noun.
While numerals precede the counted noun.
In the following table the nominal phrase erbƒìt ≈°arr≈´ dann≈´tum ≈°a ƒÅlam ƒ´pu≈°≈´ ab≈´ya 'the four strong kings who built the city are my fathers' is analyzed:

====Sentence syntax====

Akkadian sentence order was Subject+Object+Verb (SOV), which sets it apart from most other ancient Semitic languages such as Arabic and Biblical Hebrew, which typically have a verb‚Äìsubject‚Äìobject (VSO)  word order.  (Modern South Semitic languages in Ethiopia also have SOV order, but these developed within historical times from the classical verb‚Äìsubject‚Äìobject (VSO) language Ge'ez.) It has been hypothesized that this word order was a result of influence from the Sumerian language, which was also SOV. There is evidence that native speakers of both languages were in intimate language contact, forming a single society for at least 500 years, so it is entirely likely that a sprachbund could have formed. Further evidence of an original VSO or SVO ordering can be found in the fact that direct and indirect object pronouns are suffixed to the verb.  Word order seems to have shifted to SVO/VSO late in the 1st millennium BC to the 1st millennium AD, possibly under the influence of Aramaic.

==Vocabulary==

The Akkadian vocabulary is mostly of Semitic origin. Although classified as 'East Semitic', many elements of its basic vocabulary find no evident parallels in related Semitic languages. For example: mƒÅru 'son' (Semitic *bn), qƒÅtu 'hand' (Semitic *yd), ≈°ƒìpu 'foot' (Semitic *rgl), qab√ª 'say' (Semitic *qwl), izuzzu 'stand' (Semitic *qwm), ana 'to, for' (Semitic *li).
Due to extensive contact with Sumerian and Aramaic, the Akkadian vocabulary contains many loan words from these languages. Aramaic loan words, however, were limited to the 1st centuries of the 1st millennium BC and primarily in the north and middle parts of Mesopotamia, whereas Sumerian loan words were spread in the whole linguistic area. Beside the previous languages, some nouns were borrowed from Hurrian, Kassite, Ugaritic and other ancient languages.
Since Sumerian and Hurrian, two non-Semitic languages, differ from Akkadian in word structure, only nouns and some adjectives (not many verbs) were borrowed from these languages. However, some verbs were borrowed (along with many nouns) from Aramaic and Ugaritic, both of which are Semitic languages.
The following table contains examples of loan words in Akkadian:
Akkadian was also a source of borrowing to other languages, above all Sumerian. Some examples are: Sumerian da-ri ('lastingly', from Akkadian dƒÅru), Sumerian ra gaba ('riders, messenger', from Akkadian rƒÅkibu).

==Example text==

The following text is the 7th section of the Hammurabi law code, written in the mid-18th century BC:
Translation: If a man bought silver, gold, a slave (masculine), a slave (feminine), an ox, a sheep, a donkey or something other from the hand of another man or a slave of a man without witnesses or contract, or accepted (them) for safekeeping (without same), then this man is a thief; he is to be killed.
