Aruba's national flag (23px) was adopted on March 18, 1976. The design consists of a field of light blue (called "Larkspur" or "U.N. blue"), two narrow parallel horizontal yellow ("Bunting Yellow") stripes in the bottom half, and a four-pointed white-fimbriated red ("Union Flag red") star in the canton.

==Description==

The design elements have multiple symbolic meanings:
March 18 is a public holiday in Aruba, known as Flag Day and it is celebrated through carnivals and fairs.

==Governor's standard==

There is also a standard for use by the Governor of Aruba in his capacity as representative of the Monarch of the Netherlands. It consists of a white field, with the flag of the Netherlands stripped across both the top and the bottom, and a circular version of the flag of Aruba in the centre.
