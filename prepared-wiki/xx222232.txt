The First Presbyterian Church of Far Rockaway, formerly known as the Russell Sage Memorial Church, is a historic Presbyterian church located in the Far Rockaway neighborhood of Queens, New York.  It was commissioned by Olivia Slocum Sage as a memorial to her late husband, Russell Sage (1816-1906), as they used to summer in the area.  She also commissioned a large, memorial stained glass window of a landscape, designed by Tiffany Studio.
Designed by the noted architect Ralph Adams Cram (1863-1942), the church was built between 1908 and 1910 and is a Neo-Gothic-style building laid out in a traditional cruciform plan.  It is constructed of brick with concrete trim and a steeply sloping slate covered roof.  Connected to the church are a parish hall and manse.  The surrounding landscape, designed by the Olmsted Brothers, is a contributing element to is designation of historic significance.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7399 |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Russell Sage Memorial Church / First Presbyterian Church of Far Rockaway |date=July 1986 |accessdate=2008-10-03 |author=Merrill Hesch |publisher=New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation[/tpl] See also: [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7410 |title=Accompanying six photos, exterior and interior, from 1986[/tpl]
