==Outline==

While both Remedy Lane and Pain of Salvation's second album, One Hour by the Concrete Lake, feature a protagonist searching for self-discovery, Remedy Lane addresses a wider variety of themes, including love, loss, lust, sex and self-understanding. The album, written by guitarist and vocalist Daniel Gildenlöw, is semi-autobiographical in nature.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] The liner notes include poems and photos related to the concept as well as date markings to signify the chronological order of the album.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]  Gildenlöw has said that the inspiration for Remedy Lane was an era of his life in which he wished to understand the nature of freedom.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
The album's production is similar to its predecessor, The Perfect Element, part I.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] While its mood is dark, there are some moments of happiness.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl]
