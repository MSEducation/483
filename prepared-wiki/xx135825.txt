==History==

David D'Evelyn was influential in helping the Colorado Charter Schools Act of 1993 become law. He died in a plane crash shortly before the act went into effect.[tpl]cite news |first=Tracy |last=Harmon |title=Sangres crash kills education officials |work=The Pueblo Chieftain |date=1993-05-27 [/tpl]
At the same time the Colorado Charter Schools Act was going through the legislative process, the Dennison option school in Lakewood, Colorado was straining at the limits of its site capacity providing a K-8 program. In response to a need and desire to expand Dennison's program through high school, a group of parents proposed a combined junior and senior high school that would relocate the 7th and 8th grades from Dennison and add the high school at a rate of one grade level per year. Naming themselves the Initiating Committee, they submitted an application to the Jefferson County School Board to operate as an educational option school with a request to be considered for a charter school if the educational option request was denied on December 17, 1993.[ref]

The charter school application was denied by the school board on March 17, 1994, citing that the concept set forth in the charter application had been approved as an educational option. A memorandum of understanding was signed on April 4, 1994 to establish the school as an extension of the Dennison program with Dr. Lloyd Carlton, principal of Dennison, as the principal overseeing both programs for the 1994-1995 school year.
In August 1994, the school commenced classes in the building formerly occupied by Manning Junior High School at 3200 West 32nd Ave. in Golden, Colorado with its first class of ninth graders and the seventh and eighth grade classes transferred to the school from the Dennison program. Succeeding years saw the first class advance in grade until the school served a full 7-12 program in the 1997-1998 school year.
A bond issue passed by Jefferson County voters in 1998 funded a new building for the school, which opened at the school's present location in 2001.
On September 23, 2012, the school was visited by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney during his campaign.

===Governance===

D'Evelyn is governed by a Steering Committee consisting of the principal, three teachers and four parents. Steering Committee members are elected by a majority vote of the parents, teachers and staff. Under the Steering Committee, the Accountability Committee is charged with monitoring, evaluating and improving school progress.

==Campus==

Nassau Ave.The Jefferson County school district acquired [tpl]convert|40|acre|m2[/tpl] of the historic Fehringer Ranch property during master planning for the area in the late 1990s. Funds to build the new campus were approved in a school bond election in 1998. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place in early 2000 and the school's grand opening was on August 25, 2001.
The campus was designed by Slater Paull & Associates. A design advisory group that included Steering Committee members, teachers, and parents worked with the design team to develop the school's design concept and reflect classical academic architecture. The school's design was part of the 2002 Exhibition of School Planning & Architecture judged by the Council of Educational Facility Planners.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cefpi.org/archexhibit/memberdisplay.esiml?year=2002&jid=68 |title=2002 Exhibition of School Planning & Architecture - D'Evelyn Jr/Sr High School [/tpl]

==Students==

Seventh grade students matriculate from Dennison Elementary School, D'Evelyn's predecessor and feeder school. Seventh and ninth grades and transfer admission is by lottery.  However, it is also possible to enroll if another sibling already attends.
D'Evelyn has a reputation for culling the top students from the district because it is supposedly a magnet program. Current and former students may disagree, as student Allison Schroeder '07 told the Denver Post, "All the people here aren't brilliant. They just care about what they learn."[tpl]cite news |first=Jim |last=Spencer |title=School's secret: It takes hard work, not genius, to excel |work=Denver Post |date=2005-12-19 |page=B-05 [/tpl]
