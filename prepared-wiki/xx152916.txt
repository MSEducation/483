==Bio==

Carlos Timón was born on November 24, 1972 in Madrid, Spain.
Timón got into the music business at an early age. In the summer of 1989 he was playing music at Sirocco and Maravillas in Madrid. He would get up between band sound checks and perform on a stage.
His five-string stylings, which blended elements of classical guitar with an ironic No Wave aesthetic, caught the ear of a number of artists who were also interested in amalgamating and disrupting disparate musical traditions.
In recent years, Carlos's work has included Insecto's sessions with Fran Bell, Belinda Baxter, Malik Otham Yaqub, Matt Elliott (Third eye foundation). Carlos also continues to do a great deal of work with Fran Padilla - Irakere -, Javier Gallego, Javier Díez and Javier Adán (former members of Dead Capo), having all of them played on Lava's Swings of Fate album.
