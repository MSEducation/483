The BPost Bank Trophy ([tpl]lang-nl|BPost Bank Trofee[/tpl]) is a series of cyclo-cross races organised by the BPost bank which until 2011–2012 was known as the Gazet van Antwerpen Trofee. Many races are held in the province of Antwerp with others being held elsewhere in Belgium. The first ever event was held on 1 November 1987 in Putte-Peulis. It is part of the grand slam of cyclo-cross.
In 2012–2013, the general classification changed from using points to using the times of each race.
