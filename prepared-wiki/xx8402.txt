==History==

===Beginnings of Datsun name from 1914===

Masujiro Hashimoto founded the Kwaishinsha Motor Car Works in 1911. In 1914, the company produced its first car, called DAT.
The new car's name was an acronym of the company's investors' family names:
It was renamed to Kwaishinsha Motorcar Co., Ltd. in 1918, and again to DAT Jidosha & Co., Ltd. (DAT Motorcar Co.) in 1925. DAT Motors built trucks in addition to the DAT and Datsun passenger cars. The vast majority of its output were trucks, due to an almost non- existent consumer market for passenger cars at the time. Beginning in 1918, the first DAT trucks were produced for the military market. At the same time, Jitsuyo Jidosha Co., Ltd. produced small trucks using parts, and materials imported from the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/COMPANY/PROFILE/HERITAGE/HISTORY/ |title=NISSAN | CORPORATE INFORMATION | Outline of Company|Company Development, Heritage | First half of the history of Nissan |publisher=Nissan-global.com |accessdate=25 November 2011[/tpl]
In 1926 the Tokyo-based DAT Motors merged with the Osaka-based [tpl]nihongo|Jitsuyo Jidosha Co., Ltd.|実用自 動車製造株式会社|Jitsuyō Jidōsha Seizō Kabushiki-Gaisha[/tpl] a.k.a. Jitsuyo Jidosha Seizo (established 1919, as a Kubota subsidiary) to become [tpl]nihongo|DAT Jidosha Seizo Co., Ltd Automobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd. |ダット自動車製造株式会社| DAT Jidōsha Seizō Kabushiki-Gaisha[/tpl] in Osaka until 1932. From 1923 to 1925, the company produced light cars and trucks under the name of Lila.The Complete Encyclopedia of Motorcars 1885 to the Present Edited by G.N. Georgano; 1968; E.P. Dutton and Company; New York, NY
In 1931, DAT came out with a new smaller car, the first "Datson", meaning "Son of DAT". Later in 1933 after Nissan took control of DAT Motors, the last syllable of Datson was changed to "sun", because "son" also means "loss" (損) in Japanese, hence the name [tpl]nihongo|"Datsun"|ダットサン| Dattosan[/tpl].Cusumano page 33
In 1933, the company name was Nipponized to [tpl]nihongo|Jidosha-Seizo Co., Ltd.| 自動車製造株式会社|Jidōsha Seizō Kabushiki-Gaisha|"Automobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd."[/tpl] and was moved to Yokohama.

===Nissan name first used in 1930s===

In 1928, Yoshisuke Aikawa founded the holding company Nihon Sangyo (Japan Industries or Nihon Industries). The name 'Nissan' originated during the 1930s as an abbreviationCusumano pp 28 used on the Tokyo stock market for Nihon Sangyo. This company was the famous Nissan "Zaibatsu" (combine) which included Tobata Casting and Hitachi. At this time Nissan controlled foundries and auto parts businesses, but Aikawa did not enter automobile manufacturing until 1933.Cusumano pp 28, 30, 33
Nissan eventually grew to include 74 firms, and became the fourth-largest combine in Japan during World War II.Cusumano pp 28, 30
In 1931, DAT Jidosha Seizo became affiliated with Tobata Casting, and was merged into Tobata Casting in 1933. As Tobata Casting was a Nissan company, this was the beginning of Nissan's automobile manufacturing.Cusumano pp 30.

===Nissan Motor founded in 1934===

In 1934, Aikawa separated the expanded automobile parts division of Tobata Casting and incorporated it as a new subsidiary, which he named [tpl]nihongo|Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.|日産自動車|Nissan Jidōsha[/tpl]. The shareholders of the new company however were not enthusiastic about the prospects of the automobile in Japan, so Aikawa bought out all the Tobata Casting shareholders (using capital from Nihon Industries) in June 1934. At this time, Nissan Motor effectively became owned by Nihon Sangyo and Hitachi.Cusumano, page 37
In 1935, construction of its Yokohama plant was completed. 44 Datsuns were shipped to Asia, Central and South America. In 1935, the first car manufactured by an integrated assembly system rolled off the line at the Yokohama plant.
Nissan built trucks, airplanes, and engines for the Japanese military.
In 1937, the company's main plant was moved to the occupied Manchuria, and named Manchuria Heavy Industries Developing Co.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ebha-bhsj-paris.sciencesconf.org/6602|title=Manchurian Industrial Development: Companies and the Development of Manchuria under Occupation |publisher=EBHA-BHSJ Paris 20012| year=2012 |accessdate=15 September 2013[/tpl]
In 1940, first knockdown kits were shipped to Dowa Jidosha Kogyo (Dowa Automobile), one of MHID’s companies, for assembly. In 1944, the head office was moved to Nihonbashi, Tokyo, and the company name was changed to Nissan Heavy Industries, Ltd., which the company kept through 1949.

===Nissan's early American connection===

DAT had inherited Kubota's chief designer, American engineer William R. Gorham. This, along with Aikawa's 1908 visit to Detroit, was to greatly affect Nissan's future."A Brief History of Nissan Motor Company", Nissan corporate website.
Although it had always been Aikawa's intention to use cutting-edge auto making technology from America, it was Gorham that carried out the plan. Most of the machinery and processes originally came from the United States. When Nissan started to assemble larger vehicles under the “Nissan” brand in 1937, much of the design plans and plant facilities were supplied by the Graham-Paige Company. Nissan also had a Graham license under which passenger cars, buses and trucks were made.

===Austin Motor Company===

From 1934 Datsun began to build Austin Sevens under licence. This operation became the greatest success of Austin's overseas licensing of its Seven and marked the beginning of Datsun's international success.Sheepish start for the lion of Longbridge. Lord Montagu of Beaulieu. The Times, Saturday, 26 August 1995; pg. 3S1; Issue 65356.
In 1952, Nissan Motor Company of Japan entered into a legal agreement with Austin,Cususmano[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nissan-global.com/GCC/Japan/History/history/index-e.html |title=The Short History of Nissan Moter Company |publisher=Nissan-global.com |accessdate=2014-02-25[/tpl] for Nissan to assemble 2,000 Austins from imported partially assembled sets and sell them in Japan under the Austin trademark. The agreement called for Nissan to make all Austin parts locally within three years, a goal Nissan met. Nissan produced and marketed Austins for seven years. The agreement also gave Nissan rights to use Austin patents, which Nissan used in developing its own engines for its Datsun line of cars. In 1953, British-built Austins were assembled and sold, but by 1955, the Austin A50 – completely built by Nissan and featuring a new 1489 cc engine—was on the market in Japan. Nissan produced 20,855 Austins from 1953 to 1959.Cusumano, pp 90–92
Nissan leveraged the Austin patents to further develop their own modern engine designs past what the Austin's A- and B-family designs offered. The apex of the Austin-derived engines was the new design A series engine in 1966. In 1967, Nissan introduced its new highly advanced four cylinder overhead cam (OHC) Nissan L engine, which while similar to Mercedes-Benz OHC designs was a totally new engine designed by Nissan. This engine powered the new Datsun 510, which gained Nissan respect in the worldwide sedan market. Then, in 1969 Nissan introduced the Datsun 240Z sports car which used a six-cylinder variation of the L series engine. The 240Z was an immediate sensation and lifted Nissan to world class status in the automobile market.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/features/archive/112_9907_1970_datsun_240z/viewall.html |title=1970 Datsun 240Z - Motor Trend All Pages |publisher=Motortrend.com |accessdate=2014-02-25[/tpl]

===Merger with Prince Motor Company===

In 1966, Nissan merged with the Prince Motor Company, bringing more upmarket cars, including the Skyline and Gloria, into its selection. The Prince name was eventually abandoned, and successive Skylines and Glorias bore the Nissan name. "Prince," was used at the Japanese Nissan dealership "Nissan Prince Shop" until 1999, when "Nissan Red Stage" replaced it. Nissan Red Stage itself has been replaced as of 2007. The Skyline lives on as the G Series of Infiniti.

===Miss Fairlady===

To capitalize the renewed investment during 1964 Summer Olympics, Nissan established the gallery on the second and third floors of the San-ai building. To attract visitors, Nissan started using beautiful female showroom attendants where Nissan held a competition to choose five candidates as the first class of Nissan Miss Fairladys, modeled after "Datsun Demonstrators" from the 1930s who introduced cars. The Fairlady name was used as a link to the popular Broadway play of the era. Miss Fairladys became the marketers of Datsun Fair Lady 1500.Nissan recalls the birth of Miss Fairlady. Autoblog.com.

===Foreign expansion===

In the 1950s, Nissan decided to expand into worldwide markets. Nissan management realized their Datsun small car line would fill an unmet need in markets such as Australia and the world's largest car market, the United States. They first showed cars at the 1958 Los Angeles Auto Show and sold a few that year in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.datsunhistory.com/datsunhistory5.html |title=(datsunstory 5) |publisher=Datsunhistory.com |accessdate=2014-02-25[/tpl] The company formed a U.S. subsidiary, Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A., in 1960, headed by Yutaka Katayama. Nissan continued to improve their sedans with the latest technological advancements and chic Italianate styling in sporty cars such as the Datsun Fairlady roadsters, the race-winning 411 series, the Datsun 510 and the world-class Datsun 240Z. By 1970, Nissan had become one of the world's largest exporters of automobiles.
In the wake of the 1973 oil crisis, consumers worldwide (especially in the lucrative U.S. market) began turning to high-quality small economy cars. To meet the growing demand, the company built new factories in Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Africa.
The "Chicken Tax" of 1964 placed a 25% tax on commercial vans imported to the United States.[tpl]cite news| title = To Outfox the Chicken Tax, Ford Strips Its Own Vans | publisher=The Wall Street Journal, Matthew Dolan, 22 September 2009| url = http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125357990638429655.html| date=23 September 2009[/tpl] In response, Nissan, Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. began building plants in the U.S. in the early 80s.
Nissan's initial assembly plant, in Smyrna, Tennessee, at first built only trucks such as the 720 and Hardbody, but has since expanded to produce several car and SUV lines, including the Altima, Maxima, Xterra, Pathfinder and LEAF. The addition of mass-market automobiles was in response to the 1981 Voluntary Export Restraints imposed by the U.S. Government. An engine plant in Decherd, Tennessee followed, most recently a second assembly plant was established in Canton, Mississippi.
In order to overcome export tariffs and delivery costs to its European customers, Nissan contemplated establishing a plant in Europe. After an extensive review, Sunderland in the north east of England was chosen for its skilled workforce and its location near major ports. The plant was completed in 1986 as the subsidiary Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) Ltd. By 2007, it was producing 400,000 vehicles per year, landing it the title of the most productive plant in Europe.
In 2001, Nissan established a manufacturing plant in Brazil. In 2005, Nissan added operations in India, through its subsidiary Nissan Motor India Pvt. Ltd.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nissan.in/en/web/header/header_4385.htm |title=Nissan – Corporate Information |publisher=Nissan.in |accessdate=4 December 2009[/tpl] With its global alliance partner, Renault, Nissan invested $990 million to set up a manufacturing facility in Chennai, catering to the Indian market as well as a base for exports of small cars to Europe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2010/_STORY/100317-01-e.html |title=Nissan | The Renault-Nissan Alliance Inaugurates Plant In Chennai, India |publisher=Nissan-global.com |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2014-02-25[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/5019205.cms |title=Nissan launches 2 new cars in India- Automobiles-Auto-News By Industry-News-The Economic Times |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=16 September 2009 |accessdate=4 December 2009[/tpl]

Previously, Nissan used two dealership names called [tpl]Nihongo|"Nissan Blue Stage"|:ja:日産・ブルーステージ[/tpl], [tpl]Nihongo|"Nissan Red Stage"|:ja:日産・レッドステージ[/tpl], and [tpl]Nihongo|"Nissan Red and Blue Stage"|:ja:日産・レッド&ブルーステージ[/tpl], established in 1999. Before that, Nissan Red Stage was the result of combining an older sales channel of dealerships under the names [tpl]Nihongo|"Nissan Prince Store"|:ja:日産・プリンス店[/tpl], established in 1966 after the merger of Prince Motors by Nissan, which sold the Nissan Skyline, [tpl]Nihongo|"Nissan Satio Store"|日産・サティオ店[/tpl], which sold cars developed from the Nissan Sunny at its introduction in 1966, and [tpl]Nihongo|"Nissan Cherry Store"|日産・チェリー店[/tpl], cars associated with the Nissan Cherry and established in 1970.
Nissan Blue Stage was the result of combining older sales channels, called [tpl]Nihongo|"Nissan Store"|:ja:日産店[/tpl], then renamed "Nissan Bluebird Store" in 1959, selling cars associated with the Nissan Bluebird, and [tpl]Nihongo|"Nissan Motor Store"|日産・モーター店[/tpl], for cars associated with the Nissan Laurel starting in 1968. In 1970, Nissan also set up a separate sales chain which sold used cars including auctions, called [tpl]Nihongo|Nissan U-Cars|:ja:日産ユーズドカーセンター[/tpl], which they still maintain.
In the early days of Nissan's dealership network, Japanese consumers were directed towards specific Nissan stores for cars that were of a specific size and pricepoint. Over time as sales progressed and the Japanese automotive industry became more prolific, vehicles that were dedicated to particular stores were badge engineered, given different names, and shared within the existing networks thereby selling the same platforms at different locations.
Starting in 1960, another sales distribution channel was established that sold diesel products for commercial use, called Nissan Diesel until the diesel division was sold in 2007 to Volvo AB. To encourage retail sales, Nissan passenger vehicles that were installed with diesel engines, like the Cedric, were available at Nissan Diesel locations.
