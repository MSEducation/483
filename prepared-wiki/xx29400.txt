==History==

Suwannee County was created in 1858, as railways were constructed through the area connecting it to Jacksonville, Tallahassee, and points north. It was named after the Suwannee River, which forms the county's northern, western, and much of its southern border. The word "Suwannee" may either be a corruption of the Spanish San Juan ("Saint John") or from the Cherokee sawani ("echo river").
The rural areas supported numerous lumber and turpentine camps. In the 1930s, the anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston did research in North Florida timber camps.
