The Lexus marque is marketed in over 70 countries and territories worldwide,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.roadandtrack.com/tests/drives/2010_lexus_rx_350_rx_450h|title=2010 Lexus RX 350 & RX 450h - First Drive|work=Road & Track|accessdate=2010-05-15|last=Wilson|first=Tom|date=2009-02-13[/tpl] and has ranked among the ten largest Japanese global brands in market value.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.interbrand.com/Libraries/Files/-1_Japan_BGB2009_pdf.sflb.ashx|title=Japan's Best Global Brands 2009|year=2009|work=Interbrand|accessdate=2010-09-20[/tpl] Lexus is headquartered in Nagoya, Japan. Operational centers are located in Brussels, Belgium, and Torrance, California, USA.
Lexus originated from a clandestine flagship sedan project, code-named F1, which began in 1983 and culminated in the launch of the original Lexus LS in 1989. Subsequently, the division added sedan, coupé, convertible, and SUV models. In 2005, a hybrid version of the RX crossover debuted, and additional hybrid models later joined the division's lineup. In 2007, Lexus launched its own F marque performance division with the debut of the IS F sport sedan, followed by the LFA supercar in 2009.
From the start of production, Lexus vehicles have been produced in Japan, with manufacturing centered in the Chūbu and Kyūshū regions, and in particular at Toyota's Tahara, Aichi, Chūbu and Miyata, Fukuoka, Kyūshū plants. Assembly of the first Lexus built outside the country, the Ontario, Canada-produced RX 330, began in 2003. Following a corporate reorganization from 2001 to 2005, Lexus also operates its own design, engineering, and manufacturing centers, solely responsible for the division's vehicles.
Since the 2000s, Lexus has increased sales outside its largest market, the USA, through an ongoing global expansion. The division inaugurated dealerships in Japan's domestic market in 2005, becoming the first Japanese premium car marque to launch in its country of origin. Further debuts in Southeast Asia, Latin America, Europe, and other  export regions have since followed. The division's lineup has also been expanded to reflect regional specifications in model and powertrain configurations.

==History==

===1980s: The F1 project===

In 1983, Toyota chairman Eiji Toyoda summoned a secret meeting of company executives, to whom he posed the question, “Can we create a luxury vehicle to challenge the world's best?”[tpl]Harvnb|May|2006|p=43[/tpl] This question prompted Toyota to embark on a top-secret project, code-named F1 (“Flagship One”).[tpl]Harvnb|May|2006|p=42[/tpl] The F1 project, whose finished product was ultimately the Lexus LS 400, aimed to develop a flagship sedan that would expand Toyota’s product line, giving it a foothold in the premium segment and offering both longtime and new customers an upmarket product.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.autolinedetroit.tv/autoline/watch.php?stream=927|title=How Lexus Was Successful in the U.S. (interview)|year=2006|format=WMV|last=Press|first=Jim|accessdate=2006|publisher=Auto Line Detroit[/tpl] The F1 project followed the success of the Toyota Supra sports car and the premium Toyota Cressida models.White, John. New Route for Japanese Cars: Luxury. The Boston Globe. (1989-10-23) Both the Supra and Cressida were rear-wheel drive cars with a powerful 7M-GE/7M-GTE inline-six engine. The largest sedan Toyota built at the time was the limited-production, 1960s-vintage Toyota Century, its domestic, hand built, limousine flagship and sole V8-powered model, followed by the inline-six-engined Toyota Crown premium sedan.[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=6–7, 63[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Long|2001|pp=16–21[/tpl] The Century was conservatively styled for the Japanese market, and along with the Crown not slated for export, despite having undergone a complete restyle in 1982. F1 designers targeted their new sedan at international markets and began development on a new V8 engine.
The opportunity for Japanese manufacturers to export more expensive models had grown in the 1980s due to voluntary export restraints, negotiated by the Japanese government and U.S. trade representatives, restricting mainstream car sales.[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=xix, 28[/tpl] In 1986, Honda launched its Acura marque in the U.S., influencing Toyota's plans for a luxury division;[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|p=109[/tpl] the initial Acura model was an export version of the Honda Legend, itself launched in Japan in 1985 as a rival to the Toyota Crown, Nissan Cedric/Gloria and Mazda Luce.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.zakzak.co.jp/society/domestic/news/20100716/dms1007161623011-n2.htm|title=Honda's premium sedan, "Legend"|language=Japanese|work=Sankei Shimbun|date=2010-07-16|accessdate=2011-01-31[/tpl] In 1987, Nissan unveiled its plans for a premium brand, Infiniti,[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=72, 88, 116[/tpl] and revised its flagship Nissan President sedan in standard wheelbase form for export as the Infiniti Q45, which it launched in 1990.[tpl]cite web|url=http://gazoo.com/meishakan/meisha/shousai.asp?R_ID=5498&ex_spec=shousai|title=Profile: 1990 Nissan President|language=Japanese|publisher=Gazoo|accessdate=2011-01-31|year=2011[/tpl] In 1988, Mazda began selling the Luce as the Mazda 929 in North America, and later began plans to develop an upscale marque, to be called Amati, but its plans did not come to fruition.
Toyota researchers visited the USA in May 1985 to conduct focus groups and market research on luxury consumers.[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=35, 41[/tpl] During that time, several F1 designers rented a home in Laguna Beach, California to observe the lifestyles and tastes of American upper class consumers. Meanwhile, F1 engineering teams conducted prototype testing on locations ranging from the German autobahn to U.S. roads.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/lexus/|title=Edmunds.com Lexus Overview|publisher=Edmunds.com|accessdate=2011-05-23[/tpl] Toyota’s market research concluded that a separate brand and sales channel were needed to present its new flagship sedan, and plans were made to develop a new network of dealerships in the U.S. market.[tpl]Harvnb|Morgan|Liker|2006|p=121[/tpl]

====Brand development====

In 1986, Toyota’s longtime advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi formed a specialized unit, Team One, to handle marketing for the new premium brand. Image consulting firm Lippincott & Margulies was hired to develop a list of 219 prospective names; Vectre, Verone, Chaparel, Calibre and Alexis were chosen as top candidates.[tpl]Harvnb|Mahler|2004|pp=56–57[/tpl] While Alexis quickly became the front runner, concerns were raised that the name applied to people more than cars (being associated with the Alexis Carrington character on the popular 1980s primetime drama Dynasty), and as a result the first letter was removed and the "i" replaced with a "u" to morph the name to Lexus.[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=111[/tpl]
The etymology of the Lexus name has been attributed to the combination of the words "luxury" and "elegance,"[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/facesinthenews/2005/07/26/toyota-lexus-autos-cx_cn_0726autofacescan02.html|title=Watanabe's Toyota Rolls Out Lexus In Japan|date=2005-07-26|work=Forbes|last=Noon|first=Chris|accessdate=2008-06-05[/tpl] and another theory claims it is an acronym for "luxury exports to the U.S." According to Team One interviews, the brand name has no specific meaning and simply denotes a luxurious and technological image. Just prior to the release of the first vehicles, database service LexisNexis obtained a temporary injunction forbidding the name Lexus from being used as they stated it might cause confusion.[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=128–30[/tpl] The injunction threatened to delay the division's launch and marketing efforts. Upon reflection, a U.S. appeals court lifted the injunction, deciding that there was little likelihood of confusion between the two products.
The original Lexus slogan, developed after Team One representatives visited Lexus designers in Japan and noted an obsessive attention to detail, became "The Relentless Pursuit of Perfection."[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=113–14[/tpl] The Lexus logo was developed by Molly Designs and Hunter Communications.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mollydesigns.com/history.html|title=Molly Designs history, Lexus logo design|publisher=Molly Designs|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080611081501/http://www.mollydesigns.com/history.html|archivedate=2008-06-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://huntercommunications.com/HCmain/company/lexus.html|title=An Enduring Symbol of Excellence|publisher=Hunter Communications|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/2003040715380/http://huntercommunications.com/HCmain/company/lexus.html|archivedate=2003-04-07[/tpl] The final design for the Lexus logo featured a stylized “L” within an oval, and according to Toyota, was rendered using a precise mathematical formula. The first teaser ads featuring the Lexus name and logo, designed by Team One, appeared at the Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York auto shows in 1988.[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|p=115[/tpl]

====Launch====

In 1989, after an extended development process involving 60 designers, 24 engineering teams, 1,400 engineers, 2,300 technicians, 220 support workers, approximately 450 prototypes, and over [tpl]USD|1 billion[/tpl] in costs, the F1 project was completed.[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|p=24[/tpl] The resulting flagship, the Lexus LS 400, had a unique design that shared no major elements with previous Toyota vehicles, with a new 4.0 L V8 gasoline engine and rear-wheel drive.[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=xxi, 69[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Mahler|2004|p=31[/tpl] The LS 400 debuted in January 1989 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, and officially went on sale the following September at a network of 81 new Lexus dealerships across the U.S.[tpl]Harvnb|May|2006|p=47[/tpl] The LS 400 was sold along with a smaller sibling, the Toyota Camry-based ES 250. The launch of Lexus was heralded by a multimillion dollar advertising campaign in both television and print media.[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=117–18[/tpl]
At its debut, the LS 400 was widely praised for its quietness, well-appointed and ergonomic interior, engine performance, build quality, aerodynamics, fuel economy, and value,[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=68–76[/tpl] although it was criticized by some automobile columnists for derivative styling and a suspension regarded as too compromising of handling for ride comfort.[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=72–6[/tpl] The LS 400 debuted at [tpl]USD|38,000[/tpl] in the U.S. (in some markets, it was priced against mid-size six-cylinder Mercedes-Benz and BMW models)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=115368 |title=Lexus LS 400, LS 430 and LS 460 Generations:  Setting the Standard in the Most Comfortable Way Possible|accessdate=2010-07-08|publisher=Edmunds.com|date=2003-03-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080705230718/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=115368 |archivedate = 2008-07-05[/tpl] and was rated by Car and Driver magazine as better than both the [tpl]USD|63,000[/tpl] Mercedes-Benz 420 SEL and the [tpl]USD|55,000[/tpl] BMW 735i in terms of ride, handling, and performance.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,971153-1,00.html|title=New Kid on The Dock|date=1990-09-17|accessdate=2007-04-29|last=Detroit|first=S.C. Gwynne|work=Time Magazine[/tpl] The LS 400 also won major motoring awards from publications including Automobile Magazine and Wheels Magazine.Davis, David E. 1990 All-Stars, Automobile Magazine. (1990-01).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wheelsmag.com.au/wheels/site/articleIDs/C40CA2CB6C8577F1CA257285001E7302?open&template=domWheels|title=Wheels' COTY the real McCoy|last=Gable|first=Chris|work=Wheels Magazine|date=2006-12-04|accessdate=2007-05-15[/tpl] Despite being an upstart, Lexus established instant customer loyalty and its debut was generally regarded as a major shock to the pedigree luxury marques. BMW's and Mercedes-Benz's U.S. sales figures dropped 29% and 19%, respectively, with BMW executives accusing Lexus of dumping in that market, while 35% of Lexus buyers traded in a Lincoln or Cadillac to make their purchase.
In December 1989, Lexus initiated a voluntary recall of all 8,000 LS 400s sold to date, based upon two customer complaints over defective wiring and an overheated brake light. In a sweeping 20-day operation which replaced the parts on all affected vehicles, Lexus sent technicians to pick up, repair, and return cars to customers free of charge, and also flew in personnel and rented garage space for owners in remote locations. This response was lauded in media publications and helped establish the marque's early reputation for customer service.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060327/SUB/60322012/1003|title=How a recall earned Lexus a top reputation |work=Automotive News|accessdate=2009-02-19|last=Denove|first=Chris|date=2006-03-27|coauthors=Power, James[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Long|2001|pp=38–39[/tpl]
By 1989's end, 16,392 LS 400 and ES 250 sedans had been sold in the four months following the U.S. launch.[tpl]Harvnb|Long|2001|p=36[/tpl] Although sales had begun at a slower pace than expected, the final tally matched the division's target of 16,000 units for that year.[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=125, 141[/tpl] Following initial models, plans called for the addition of a sports coupe along with a redesigned ES sedan.

===1990s: Growth and expansion===

In 1990, during its first full year of sales, Lexus sold 63,594 LS 400 and ES 250 sedans in the U.S.,[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=139–41[/tpl] the vast majority being the LS model. That year, Lexus also began limited exports to the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada, and Australia.[tpl]Harvnb|Long|2001|pp=41–42[/tpl] In 1991, Lexus launched its first sports coupe, the SC 400, which shared the LS 400’s V8 engine and rear-wheel drive design. This was followed by the second generation ES 300 sedan, which succeeded the ES 250 and became Lexus' top seller.[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=141–46[/tpl] At the conclusion of 1991, Lexus had become the top-selling premium car import in the U.S.,[tpl]cite web|url=http://autos.msn.com/browse/Lexus.aspx|title=Overview: The Lexus Story|year=2008|publisher=MSN Autos|accessdate=2008-12-25[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Long|2001|p=51[/tpl] with sales reaching a total of 71,206 vehicles. That year, Lexus ranked highest in J.D. Power and Associates' studies on initial vehicle quality, customer satisfaction, and sales satisfaction for the first time.[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|p=75[/tpl] The marque also began increasing U.S. model prices past those of comparable American premium makes, but still below high-end European models; by 1992, the LS 400's base price had risen 18% to nearly [tpl]USD|45,000[/tpl].[tpl]Harvnb|Long|2001|p=57[/tpl]
In 1993, Lexus launched the mid-size GS 300 sports sedan, based on the Toyota Aristo using the Toyota "S" platform from the Toyota Crown, which had sold for two years prior in Japan. The GS 300 was priced below the LS 400 in the marque's lineup.[tpl]Harvnb|Long|2001|p=73[/tpl] That same year, Lexus also became one of the first marques to debut a certified pre-owned program, with the aim of improving trade-in model values.[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|p=149[/tpl] In 1994, the marque introduced the second generation LS 400, a complete redesign of its flagship model.[tpl]Harvnb|Long|2001|p=89[/tpl] In May 1995, sales were threatened by the U.S. government's proposal of 100% tariffs on upscale Japanese cars in response to the widening U.S.-Japan trade deficit.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071029/ANA03/710290340/1128/ANA03&Profile=1128|title=Bold moves halt tariff stalemate, save Lexus brand|work=Automotive News|accessdate=2009-02-02|date=2007-10-29|last=Treece|first=James[/tpl] SUVs were exempt from the proposed sanctions.[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=160–61[/tpl] Normal sales operations resumed by late 1995 when the Japanese auto manufacturers collectively agreed to greater American investments, and the tariffs were not enacted.
In 1996, Lexus debuted its first sport utility vehicle, the LX 450,[tpl]Harvnb|Long|2001|pp=105–07[/tpl] followed by the third generation ES 300 sedan. The marque's plans for developing an SUV model had accelerated during the U.S.-Japan tariff discussions of 1995. In 1998, Lexus added the first luxury-branded crossover SUV, the RX 300, and the second generation GS 300 and GS 400 sedans. The RX crossover targeted suburban buyers who desired an upmarket SUV but did not need the LX's off-road capability; it was particularly successful, becoming the marque's top-selling model ahead of the ES 300.[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=171–72[/tpl] The same year, Lexus made its debut in South America's most populous country when it launched sales in Brazil.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/suplementos/not_sup342035,0.htm|title=Em busca de notoriedade|work=Estadao|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2009-06-08|date=2009-03-20[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://diariodonordeste.globo.com/2000/03/19/050002.htm|title=Tecnologia é destaque no Lexus ES 300 |work=Diário do Nordeste|accessdate=2009-06-08|language=Portuguese|date=2000-03-19[/tpl] In 1999, Lexus recorded its one-millionth vehicle sold in the U.S. market, and was ranked as the top-selling premium car maker in the U.S. overall.

===2000s: Global reorganization===

In 2000, Lexus introduced the IS line, a new series of entry-level sport sedans.  In 2001, the marque debuted its first convertible, the SC 430, a redesigned ES 300, and the third generation LS 430.Mahler 204, pp. 27, 196. The GX 470 mid-size SUV debuted in 2002, followed by the second generation RX 330 in 2003.[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|p=189[/tpl] The following year, Lexus recorded its two-millionth U.S. vehicle sale,[tpl]cite web|url=http://wardsdealer.com/ar/auto_millionth_lexus_customer/|title=2-Millionth Lexus Customer|quote=RX 330 owner Steven Sandman, trip winner|date=2004-06-01|work=Ward's Dealer[/tpl][tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|p=xxiv[/tpl] and debuted the first luxury-branded production hybrid SUV, the RX 400h.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailynews.com/search/ci_3076458|title=Lexus introduces first luxury hybrid SUV|date=2005-10-26|agency=Associated Press|last=Job|first=Ann|accessdate=2008-06-21[/tpl] This vehicle used a Lexus Hybrid Drive system which combined gasoline and electric motors for increased power, fuel efficiency, and lower emissions relative to gasoline-only equivalents.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/autos/content/mar2006/bw20060308_999129.htm  |title=Hybrid Heaven in a Lexus|last=Petersen|first=Thane|work=BusinessWeek|date=2006-03-08|accessdate=2007-05-06[/tpl]

====Hybrids and F models====

In 2006, Lexus began sales of the GS 450h, a V6 hybrid performance sedan, and launched the fourth generation flagship LS line, comprising both standard- and long-wheelbase V8 (LS 460 and LS 460 L) and hybrid (LS 600h and LS 600h L) versions. The fifth generation ES 350 also debuted in the same year. The LS 600h L subsequently went on sale as the most expensive sedan ever produced in Japan, with a sticker price of approximately [tpl]USD|125,000[/tpl]. By the end of 2006, Lexus' annual sales had reached 475,000 vehicles worldwide. In January 2007, Lexus announced a new F marque performance division, which would produce racing-inspired versions of its performance models. The first of this line, the IS F, made its debut at the 2007 North American International Auto Show,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thecarconnection.com/autoshownews/1010188_lexus-confirms-f-performance-cars|title=Lexus Confirms "F" Performance Cars|date=2006-12-11|publisher=The Car Connection|last=Padgett|first=Marty|accessdate=2007-05-06[/tpl] accompanied by a supercar concept, the LF-A.
In October 2007, Lexus entered the Specialty Equipment Market Association show in the U.S. for the first time with the IS F, and announced its F-Sport performance trim level and factory-sanctioned accessory line. Automotive columnists noted Lexus' increased emphasis on sporty models as an effort to bolster the marque's performance credentials and target rivals from Mercedes-Benz's AMG and BMW's M divisions.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businesscar.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=1182|title=Lexus ISF proves Japanese brand can do sporty|date=2007-03-16|publisher=BusinessCar|accessdate=2007-10-01[/tpl] While previous Lexus models such as the SC 400 and GS 400 had received favorable reactions from sport luxury buyers,[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=141–47, 163–65[/tpl] other Lexus models had been characterized as favoring comfort over sporty road feel and handling, compared with European rivals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mpt.org/motorweek/reviews/rt2621a.shtml|title=Motorweek Lexus LS 460 test drive|year=2007|accessdate=2011-07-29|work=MotorWeek[/tpl] By the end of 2007, Lexus annual worldwide sales had surpassed 500,000 vehicles,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/09/19/lexus-targets-500-000-units-for-2007/|title=Lexus targets 500,000 units for 2007|publisher=Autoblog.com|last=Waterman|first=Stuart|date=2006-09-19|accessdate=2007-05-06[/tpl] and the marque ranked as the top-selling premium import in China for the first time.

===Regional operations===

Lexus sales operations vary in structure by region. In many markets, such as the U.S., the dealership network is a distinct organization from corporate headquarters, with separately owned and operated Lexus showrooms.[tpl]Harvnb|Long|2001|pp=29[/tpl] By contrast, in Japan all 143 dealerships in the country are owned and operated by Lexus. Several markets have a designated, third party regional distributor; for example, in the United Arab Emirates, sales operations are managed by Al-Futtaim Motors LLC, and in Costa Rica, Lexus vehicles are sold via regional distributor Purdy Motors S.A.[tpl]cite web|archiveurl=http://replay.web.archive.org/20071218193844/http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2006/octubre/27/economia874532.html|archivedate=2007-12-18|url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2006/octubre/27/economia874532.html|title=Firmas automotrices realizan inversiones|language=Spanish|accessdate=2009-05-29|work=La Nación (San José)|date=2006-10-27[/tpl] Other officially sanctioned regional distributors have sold Lexus models prior to the launch of, or in absence of, a dedicated dealership network.

===Financial performance===

Financial data of Lexus operations are not disclosed publicly.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&sid=aJNPURUsO0Kg&refer=japan|title=Toyota’s U.S. Pain Amplified by Falling Lexus Sales |publisher=Bloomberg|date=2009-04-06|last=Ohnsman|first=Alan|accessdate=2009-04-19[/tpl] However, automotive analysts estimate that the Lexus division contributes a disproportionate share of Toyota's profits, relative to its limited production and sales volume. Interviews with retired division officials indicate that depending on sales volume, vehicle product development cycles, and exchange rates, Lexus sales have accounted for as much as half of Toyota's annual U.S. profit in certain years. Division executives have employed pricing strategies aimed at sustaining profit margins rather than sales volume, with historically fewer price incentives than rival brands. In 2006, Lexus entered Interbrand's list of the Top 100 Global Brands for the first time, with an estimated brand value of approximately [tpl]USD|3 billion[/tpl] annually.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.interbrand.com/en/best-global-brands/best-global-brands-2008/best-global-brands-2006.aspx|title=The 100 Top Brands 2006|year=2007|work=Interbrand|accessdate=2010-09-20[/tpl] In 2009, Interbrand ranked Lexus as Japan's seventh largest brand, between Panasonic and Nissan, based on revenue, earnings, and market value.

===Vehicle lineup===

The global Lexus lineup features sedans of different size classes, including the compact IS and HS models,  mid-size ES and GS models, and the full-size LS flagship. Convertibles include the IS C models. Sport-utility vehicles range in size from the crossover RX, the mid-size GX, to the full-size LX. Hybrid models include the CT hatchback, HS sedan, and variants of the GS, LS, and RX. The F marque line produces a variant of the IS sedan and the LFA coupe.

===F marque===

Lexus produces its highest-performance models under its F marque division.  The name refers to Flagship and Fuji Speedway in Japan, whose first corner, 27R, inspired the shape of the "F" emblem.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/EE775C71EC94A9A5CA257300001FC985|title=IS-F, TRD power-plays |date=2007-06-21|publisher=GoAuto|last=Pettendy|first=Marton|coauthors=Martin, Terry|accessdate=2007-08-27[/tpl] F marque models are developed by the Lexus Vehicle Performance Development Division.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.automotorevue.cz/auto/svezli-jsme-se/lexus-is-f-japonsky-expres.html|title=Lexus IS F-Japonský expres|work= Automotorevue|accessdate=2010-10-01|date=2008-06-28|language=Czech[/tpl] The first F marque model, the IS F, went on sale in 2007, followed by the LFA in 2009.

===Model nomenclature===

Lexus production models are named alphanumerically using two-letter designations followed by three digits. The first letter indicates relative status in the Lexus model range (ranking),[tpl]cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/09/07/pf/autos/car_name_decoder/|title=Car name decoder|date=2004-09-11|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2009-02-01|last=Valdes-Dapena|first=Peter[/tpl] and the second letter refers to car body style or type (e.g. LS for 'luxury sedan'). The three digits indicate engine displacement in liters multiplied by a factor of one hundred (e.g. 350 for a 3.5 L engine). A space is used between the letters and numbers. The same letter may be used differently depending on the model; 'S' can refer to 'sedan' or 'sport'[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nihoncar.com/en/review-292-Lexus+IS250+Test+Drive,+HDTV.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090603165332/http://www.nihoncar.com/en/review-292-Lexus+IS250+Test+Drive%2C+HDTV.html|archivedate=2009-06-03|title=Lexus IS250 Test Drive|publisher=Nihoncar.com|date=2006-08-06|accessdate=2009-02-01[/tpl] (e.g. in LS and SC), while 'X' refers to 'luxury utility vehicle' or SUV.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/autos/content/feb2007/bw20070214_857806.htm|title=Sales of Foreign Autos Climb|work=BusinessWeek|date=2007-02-14|accessdate=2009-02-01[/tpl] On hybrids, the three digits refer to the combined gasoline-electric output. For certain models, a lower case letter placed after the alphanumeric designation indicates powerplant type ('h' for hybrid, 'd' for diesel), while capital letter(s) placed at the end indicates a class subtype (e.g. 'L' for long-wheelbase, 'C' for coupe, 'AWD' for all-wheel drive). On F marque models, the two-letter designation and the letter 'F' are used with no numbers or hyphens (e.g. IS F).

===L-finesse===

Lexus introduced a new design language known as "L-finesse" in the mid-2000s with its LF series concepts and the 2006 Lexus GS.[tpl]cite web|url=http://car-reviews.automobile.com/news/lexus-l-finesse-design-analysis-is-is-it/1450/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110707191605/http://www.automobile.com/lexus-l-finesse-design-analysis-is-is-it.html|archivedate=2011-07-07|title=Lexus L-Finesse Design Analysis: IS is IT!|last=Yarkony|first=Jonathan|date=2005-09-26|publisher=American Auto Press|accessdate=2007-05-06[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.automobear.com/WhatThe2006LexusISIsAndIsnt.html|title=What the 2006 Lexus IS is, and isn't|publisher=AutomoBear.com|date=2005-03-07|accessdate=2007-05-06[/tpl] L-finesse is represented by three Japanese kanji characters which translate as  "Intriguing Elegance, Incisive Simplicity, and Seamless Anticipation". Design characteristics, including a fastback profile, lower-set grille,Rechtin, Mark. Lexus Finally Gets a Design of its Own. Automotive News, 2003-10-27. and the use of both convex and concave surfaces, are derived from Japanese cultural motifs (e.g. the phrase kirikaeshi in arrowhead shapes).Morrison, Mac. Mountain Climber: Lexus unveils the next IS sport sedan. AutoWeek, 2005-03-21. While earlier Lexus models were criticized for reserved and derivative styling, and often mistaken for understated domestic market cars, automotive design analyses described L-finesse as adding a distinctive nature and embrace of Japanese design identity. Opinions varied for L-finesse's debut on the GS; Sports Car International's analysis praised the vehicle's in-person appearance;Coates, Del. Design Matters. Sports Car International, 2005-09. Automobile Magazine criticized the daring of its forward styling,Cumberford, Robert. Not There Yet But Getting Closer. Automobile Magazine.

==Marketing==

From its inception, Lexus has been advertised to luxury consumers using specific marketing strategies, with a consistent motif used for the marque's advertisements. Beginning in 1989, television ads were narrated by actor James Sloyan (the voice of "Mr. Lexus" until 2009),[tpl]cite web|url=http://adage.com/adages/post?article_id=135239|title=Lexus Trades in Sloyan for New Set of Voice-Over Pipes|work=Advertising Age|accessdate=2009-03-19|last=Halliday|first=Jean|date=2009-03-13[/tpl] and accompanied by vehicles that performed unusual stunts onscreen.[tpl]Harvnb|Dawson|2004|p=119[/tpl] The first decade of Lexus commercials (1989–99) consisted primarily of disjunctive verbal descriptions, such as "relentless," "pursuit," and "perfection,"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.insideline.com/lexus/is-f/2008/first-look-2008-lexus-is-f.html|title=First Look: 2008 Lexus IS-F|date=2007-09-23|publisher=Edmunds.com|last=Huffman|first=John Pearley|accessdate=2011-05-23[/tpl] while vehicles were used to claim superiority in precision, idling, and interior quiet and comfort on camera. Examples included the champagne glass "Balance" (1989) and rolling "Ball Bearing" (1992). In the 2000s, commercials included descriptions of novel features,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&code=3631a5a1&atype=news&id=18636|title=Boxer Films Knocks Out New Lexus Spot|publisher=VFXWorld|accessdate=2009-05-20|date=2006-08-15[/tpl] or a narration of the events onscreen, and were often targeted at the marque's German competitors.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.topspeed.com/cars/car-news/lexus-takes-swipe-at-german-counterparts-in-latest-print-ad-ar94128.html|title=Lexus Takes Swipe At German Counterparts|publisher=Top Speed|accessdate=2010-07-30|last=Garlitos|first=Kirby|year=2010[/tpl] An annual "December to Remember" campaign featured scenes of family members surprising loved ones with the gift of a new Lexus.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE4DB1F31F936A25751C1A9639C8B63|title=A Lexus for Christmas?

Industry observers have attributed Lexus' early marketing successes to higher levels of perceived quality and lower prices than competitors, which have enabled the marque to attract customers upgrading from mass-market cars. A reputation for dependability, bolstered by reliability surveys, also became a primary factor in attracting new customers from rival premium makes.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2004/nov/07/germany.theobserver|title=Vorsprung durch Technik?

Several analysts have stated that Lexus will have to develop its own heritage over time by highlighting technological innovations and producing substantial products.
Lexus' marketing efforts have extended to sporting and charity event sponsorships, including the U.S. Open tennis Grand Slam event from 2005 to 2009, and the  United States Golf Association's U.S. Open, U.S. Women's Open, U.S. Senior Open, and U.S. Amateur tournaments since 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://promomagazine.com/eventmarketing/news/lexus_usopen_083006/|title=Lexus Drives Promos Courtside for US Open|date=2006-08-30|last=Scott|first=Andrew|accessdate=2007-05-06|publisher=Promo[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/article/109085|title=Luxury Drive: USGA Signs Lexus As First Automotive Partner|date=2007-01|work=Sports Business Daily|accessdate=2009-06-08[/tpl] Lexus has organized an annual Champions for Charity golf series in the U.S. since 1989.Lexus Golf Tourney Benefits Charities.
