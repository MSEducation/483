The Band-Aid was invented in 1920 by  Johnson & Johnson employee Earle Dickson for his wife Josephine, who frequently cut and burned herself while cooking.BAND-AID Brand Adhesive Bandages Beginnings The prototype allowed her to dress her wounds without assistance. Dickson passed the idea on to his employer, which went on to produce and market the product as the Band-Aid. Dickson had a successful career at Johnson & Johnson, rising to vice president before his retirement in 1957.
The original Band-Aids were handmade and not very popular. By 1924, Johnson & Johnson introduced a machine that produced sterilized Band-Aids. In World War II, millions were shipped overseas, helping popularize the product. 
In 1951, the first decorative Band-Aids were introduced. They continue to be a commercial success today, with such themes as Superman, Spider-Man, Hello Kitty, Rocket Power, Rugrats, smiley faces, Barbie, Dora the Explorer, and Batman and Duck Dynasty.
