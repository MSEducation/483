The Ku Klux Klan has had a history in the U.S. state of New Jersey since the early part of the 1920s. The Klan was in the area around Trenton and Camden and had a presence in several of the state's northern counties, but its largest presence was in Monmouth County, where it had a resort at Wall Township's Camp Evans.

==History==

The first appearance of the KKK in New Jersey was in 1921, where it had crossed over from New York and Pennsylvania. Arthur Hornbui Bell was the state's first Grand Dragon, and continued serving in that post until the Ku Klux Klan was disbanded in 1944.
As early as 1922, arguing that it was a breach of the U.S. legal doctrine of separation of church and state, the New Jersey Klan flexed its political muscle in an unsuccessful attempt to intimidate Paterson, New Jersey's honored burial of the Roman Catholic priest William N. McNulty.[tpl]cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Ku Klux Protest Honor to Late Dean. Members of Klan at Paterson Try to Prevent the Closing of Schools During Funeral. But Mayor Ignores Them.
