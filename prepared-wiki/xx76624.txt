Hell's Pit is the second part of the sixth Joker's Card, The Wraith, written with the opposite intent of its counterpart, Shangri-La, Hell's Pit is intended to illustrate the horrors of hell itself. Many of the songs feature [[Joseph Bruce|
Violent J]] and Shaggy 2 Dope fictitiously dying, to be sent to Hell, depicted in the album as a place void of all hope and peace, where those who do not atone for their sins and follow the ways of Shangri-La will presumably be sent upon their death. Bruce described the album as "Horror tale after Horror tale, mixed in with songs that describe hell" and stated that it was the darkest, most painful work he had ever done.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.insaneclownposse.com/carnival/iframe.php?page_id=icp_history_8 |title=Who R ICP > History > The Wraith: Hell's Pit |accessdate=2008-05-02 |publisher=Psychopathic Records[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

Critic Steve 'Flash' Juon of Rap Reviews wrote that "Hell's Pit may be [tpl]sic|appopriately[/tpl] named, if only because I felt like I was in a burning pit of Hell in my ears while listening to it.
