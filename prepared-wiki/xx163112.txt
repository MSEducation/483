Meeker Slough is a slough in Richmond, California formed by a creek of the same name and drains into the Richmond Inner Harbor, part of San Francisco Bay.  The area lies between modern tract housing in the Marina Bay neighborhood and the University of California, Berkeley Richmond Field Station's portion of Western Stege Marsh, which has been cleaned of legacy industrial contamination and restored to a productive tidal salt marsh home to the endangered California clapper rail (Rallus longirostris oboletus).  The slough is across from Stege Marsh from which Baxter Creek drains across from a small bay they both form known as Campus Bay.  The site is currently undergoing wetlands restoration.UC Berkeley, retrieved August 1, 2007
