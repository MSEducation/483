The 2007 tuberculosis scare occurred when Atlanta personal-injury lawyer Andrew "Drew" Speaker flew from Atlanta, Georgia to Paris, France and on to Greece and then Italy before returning on a flight from Prague, Czech Republic to Montreal, Canada, where he crossed over the border and back into the United States while infected with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis.Border security scrutinized after TB patient slips in, CNN.comEmily Brown and Jeff Bliss, "Border Agents Failed to Stop Man With Tuberculosis" (Update4). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention believed at the time that Speaker was suffering from extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). The incident sparked a debate in Congress on the failure of federal customs agents to stop him. Upon Speaker's return to the United States, the CDC placed him under involuntary isolation (similar to quarantine) using a provision of the Public Health Service Act.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/isolationquarantine.htm|title=Fact Sheet on Isolation and Quarantine|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2007-06-03[/tpl]  With this action, Speaker became the first individual subjected to a CDC isolation order since 1963.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/other/news/may3107tb.html|title=Odd twist in TB alert: Patient is TB researcher's son-in-law|publisher=CIDRAP|accessdate=2007-06-02| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070603154608/http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/other/news/may3107tb.html| archivedate= 3 June 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Background==

In January 2007, Speaker suffered a fall and went to the doctor, concerned that he had bruised a rib. Doctors X-rayed his chest and found an abnormality that required further testing.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2008[/tpl] Andrew Speaker was suspected of having TB when a positive PPD test came back on March 2, 2007. His third CT scan was done on March 3 and a bronchoscopy was done on March 8. After 18 days of incubation the isolate was sent to CDC for confirmation of his susceptibility results that were done by the Georgia Department of Human Resources (DHR).
On March 28, 2007 his doctors and the health department believed the TB strain Speaker had was a resistant one and communicated this to the CDC. On May 1 the apparent MDR TB infection was discussed with the CDC lab by his doctors and they discussed discontinuing the treatment he was on at that time. On May 9 the suspicion of MDR TB was confirmed. A meeting was held with Fulton County Health Officials, his doctors, his fiancée and his father and father-in-law on May 10, 2007. At this time he was told that he was not contagious and not a threat to anyone[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] but that he would need to go to Denver for treatment. It would take a few weeks to arrange this. He was advised, or according to some accounts strongly recommended, not to travel.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl]

==Travel Sequence==

On May 12, 2007, Speaker flew from the U.S. to Paris. On May 14, he flew on to Athens and, two days later, flew to the Aegean holiday island of Santorini for his wedding (Santorini's Mayor Angelos Roussos, states that Speaker lacked the necessary paperwork for the civil ceremony.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/06/01/tb.flight/index.html?xid=rss-world |title=CNN story on wedding |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071212013325/http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/06/01/tb.flight/index.html?xid=rss-world |archivedate = 2007-12-12[/tpl]). Speaker then flew to Rome for his honeymoon.
Doctors say that only after Speaker left the United States did they realize he likely had XDR-TB. Speaker says that he was informed of MDR TB before leaving the country, and that while officials preferred him not to fly, they said that he was not a threat and was not required to wear a mask.Andrew Speaker Says He's Being Unfairly Attacked by Eve Conant, Newsweek, 2 Jun 2007. Accessed 2009-04-30.  Archived 2009-05-21. Once Speaker was in Europe, however, test results showed his strain of tuberculosis was even rarer than originally thought, leading public health officials to try to persuade Speaker to turn himself in to Italian health authorities.http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/06/07/tb.borders/index.html http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3344625&page=1 The CDC informed him that there were no options for the CDC to get him home, and that he would have to arrange private transportation. Speaker instead flew by commercial jet to Prague and then on to Montréal.Park, Alice. "The TB Scare: A Broken System?" Time. May 31, 2007.

Speaker has also said that the CDC told him they were going to send officials to put him in Italian quarantine for up to two years, and that he was not told special transportation was arranged.
Once in Montréal, Speaker rented a car and drove across the Canada – United States border. A Customs and Border Protection Officer failed to detain him at the frontier, disregarding a warning after he had passed Speaker's passport through the Treasury Enforcement Communications System (TECS) to hold the traveler, wear a protective mask when dealing with him, and call health authorities because he "did not look sick".[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.9news.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=71772 | publisher=Fox News | accessdate=2007-06-11 | title= Border agent fired after allowing TB patient into country[/tpl]

==Tuberculosis case notes==

On May 31, 2007, Speaker was moved from Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta to the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, Colorado, for further treatment.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,276613,00.html |title=Foxnews.com: TB Patient moved to Denver hospital, May 31, 2007 |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=May 31, 2007 |accessdate=2008-11-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081002135315/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,276613,00.html| archivedate= 2 October 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
It was reported that Speaker's father-in-law, Robert C. Cooksey, works for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and is a microbiologist who has conducted research on tuberculosis, according to his CDC biography posted on the agency's Web site.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/05/31/tb.flight/index.html |title=CNN web site: TB patient's name released; father-in-law works at CDC |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080308192527/http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/conditions/05/31/tb.flight/index.html |archivedate = 2008-03-08[/tpl]  However, Cooksey has never worked with the strain of tuberculosis Speaker has been diagnosed with.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl]
Wearing a medical mask, Speaker was interviewed by Diane Sawyer on the June 1 edition of the American talk show Good Morning America on ABC and apologized to all passengers, explaining that he had not intended to endanger them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=3231184&page=1 |title=ABCNews.com: TB Patient: "I Really Believed I Wasn't Putting People at Risk" June 1, 2007 |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080929161834/http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=3231184&page=1| archivedate= 29 September 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
According to an interview on Larry King Live, Speaker said that he had not been told that there was any risk of transmitting the disease to others, nor did the May 10 letter recommending against his travel state this, which Speaker in any case had not received before leaving May 14.  His wife, with whom he lived for five months without precautions, remained uninfected.

==New diagnosis==

On July 4, 2007 the National Jewish Medical and Research Center announced, and the CDC confirmed, that Mr. Speaker's earlier diagnosis was incorrect and that he instead had multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), a more treatable form of tuberculosis.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/07/03/tb.speaker/index.html | publisher=CNN | accessdate=2007-07-04 | title=Doctors: TB traveler's diagnosis more treatable than thought | date=2007-07-04| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070712192138/http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/07/03/tb.speaker/index.html#cnnSTCVideo| archivedate= 12 July 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

==Isolation and law==

Before a Congressional hearing, Speaker and his father played audio recordings from CDC and Fulton County health officials which say he was not a danger to others.  He asked such questions on five recordings repeatedly and was given the same answers even after stating on two recordings that he was going out of the country and the CDC later admitted they were aware and waited until he had already left before taking further actions.
Speaker was in New York when the CDC served him with an isolation order but CDC director Julie Gerberding stated that the government was legally constrained prior to that order.  The federal statute granting quarantine authority allows isolation or quarantine but only for individuals coming into the country from a foreign country or territory.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1181207137498 | publisher=Law.com | accessdate=2007-06-08 | title=The Legal Questions Behind the TB Case[/tpl]
Georgia TB law may have required Speaker to be confined for two weeks and only allowed travel for medical appointments.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.physorg.com/news103981421.html | publisher=Physorg.com | accessdate=2007-07-18 | title=TB patient travel may have been illegal| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070826171751/http://www.physorg.com/news103981421.html| archivedate= 26 August 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]  A court confinement order can isolate a patient only after the infected patient ignores medical advice.  This method can be overridden by a declaration of public health emergency by the governor of Georgia.
On July 12, 2007 it was announced that seven Canadians and two Czechs will launch $1.3 million in civil lawsuits in Montreal. Eight were on the same flight as Andrew Speaker and one was a roommate of one of those on the same flight.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8QB9BV80&show_article=1 | publisher=Breitbart.com | accessdate=2007-07-12 | title=Nine File Suit Against TB-Infected Man[/tpl]
