[[Queer literary interpretation]]

CATEGORIES: Literary criticism, Queer, Queer theory

Queer literary interpretation is a method of literary interpretation stemming from Marxism, feminism, psychoanalysis and the gay rights movement. It is an addition to literary theory in the 1980s.
Only partially based on gay, lesbian and bisexual issues, a queer literary interpretation is largely concerned with sexual identity, especially "closeted" (hidden) sexual identity.  Other "closeted" aspects of works are often examined, as well.
There are opposing views of queer literary theory.  One view is that sexual identity is "fixed", and may be discerned by careful study.  The opposing view is that sexual identity is both fluid and socially constructed, and thus there is no "absolute" identity.

A traditional work of literature can be "queered" by applying this type of interpretation.
