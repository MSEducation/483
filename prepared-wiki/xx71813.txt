CATEGORIES: Peninsulas of Japan, Geography of Ishikawa Prefecture

Noto Peninsula (能登半島, Noto-hantō) is a peninsula that projects north into the Sea of Japan from the coast of Ishikawa Prefecture in central Honshū, the main island of Japan. The main industries of the peninsula are agriculture, fisheries, and tourism.

==Name==

Noto has no meaning in Japanese. It appears to come from Ainu, where not means "peninsula"; the final -o is presumably a paragogic echo vowel, since the Japanese language does not allow final consonants.Vovin, Alexander (2008). "Man'yōshū to Fudoki ni Mirareru Fushigina Kotoba to Jōdai Nihon Retto ni Okeru Ainugo no Bunpu." Kokusai Nihon Bunka Kenkyū Sentā.  The two kanji that form the word Noto (能登) denote "skill / climbing", but may be a case of ateji; that is, a kanji spelling constructed to spell a previously existing word, with little or no regard to the meaning of the kanji.

Noto Peninsula is also the setting of Hirokazu Koreeda's second film Maborosi (1995).
