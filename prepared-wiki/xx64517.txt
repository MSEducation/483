[[Communication Canada]]

CATEGORIES: Former Canadian federal departments and agencies

Communication Canada was an agency of the Department of Public Works and Government Services in the Government of Canada. Its responsibility was primarily for keeping federal government departments and their agencies connected with Canadian citizens.  Responsibility for developing the federal government's web presence and primary web site rested with Communication Canada.
The agency was created in the mid-1990s following the 1995 Quebec referendum, ostensibly to promote federal government communications with all of Canada, however many Canadians viewed it as a government propaganda agency.  Communication Canada became linked to the Sponsorship Scandal and was disbanded in a federal government reorganization at the end of the fiscal year, effective March 31, 2004.
