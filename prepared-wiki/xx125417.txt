Kelly's 2006 season was fairly average throughout the first six rounds, albeit largely through mechanical failures, however after strong driving performances at the next three rounds including second in both the Sandown 500 and Bathurst 1000 when he paired up with younger brother Rick Kelly.  Kelly's seat was taken by HSV Dealer Team driver Garth Tander.  He was just starting to show some of the form that had him finish fourth in championship in 2005.  He finished the year off strongly, with a second and first place in the last two rounds which left him in sixth place[tpl]cite news |title=2006 V8 Supercar Championship Final Points|publisher=V8 Supercars Australia|url=http://www.v8supercars.com.au/v8data/2006/dpprgmjreasy.asp?EvntId=198&SrsInd=M&SrsName=2006%20V8%20SUPERCAR%20CHAMPIONSHIP%20SERIES%20POINTS&SrsMEDFile=/v8data/sers/sers_14m.gif&EvtName=Caterpillar%20Grand%20Finale&EvtRnds=Round%2013&EvtDates=08/12/2006%20-%2010/12/2006&DPdataDt=10/12/2006&TPdataDt10/12/2006&CtName=Phillip%20Island%20Grand%20Prix%20Circuit&ssn=2006&ts=&keepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=400&width=800|accessdate=2009-03-04[/tpl] at the end of the year.
Season 2007 was another average year for Kelly, he won the Clipsal 500 but was not able to continue that edge.  He came second at Phillip Island and at the Grand Finale, finishing seventh[tpl]cite news |title=2007 V8 Supercar Championship Final Points|publisher=V8 Supercars Australia|url=http://www.v8supercars.com.au/v8data/2007/dpprgmjreasy.asp?EvntId=245&SrsInd=M&SrsName=2007%20V8%20SUPERCAR%20CHAMPIONSHIP%20SERIES%20POINTS&SrsMEDFile=/v8data/sers/sers_14m.gif&EvtName=Dunlop%20Grand%20Finale&EvtRnds=Round%2014&EvtDates=30/11/2007%20-%2002/12/2007&DPdataDt=02/12/2007&TPdataDt02/12/2007&CtName=Phillip%20Island%20Grand%20Prix%20Circuit&ssn=2007&ts=&keepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=400&width=800|accessdate=2009-03-04[/tpl] in the championship.

At the conclusion of the season, Kelly announced he would drive for Jack Daniel's Racing from 2008 onwards after a five-year association with HRT.Jack Daniel's Racing Signs Todd Kelly  This move is believed to have also been supported by 2007 champion Garth Tander confirming he will be moving from HSVDT to HRT.
Kelly's 2008 proved to be inconsistent.  After starting the year well at Clipsal, where he finished fifth for the round, the middle part of the season saw a lack of the results expected from Kelly.  After a major suspension geometry issue was resolved during the course of the Bathurst weekend, the car showed a sudden turn of speed.  He finished 4th at Surfers Paradise, then scored a stunning race win in the wet at Symmons Plains,[tpl]cite news |date=22 November 2008|title=Hot Toddy goes down well in cold Tassie|url=http://www.v8supercars.com.au/content/hero_news/november_08/hot_toddy_goes_down_well_in_cold_tassie/|accessdate=2009-03-04[/tpl] the first victory of any kind (race or round) for a Perkins Engineering entry since 2006.
