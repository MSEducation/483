[[Feri Tradition]]

CATEGORIES: Neopagan traditions, Neopaganism

The Feri Tradition (which is a different tradition than Faery, Fairy, Faerie, or Vicia,) is an initiatory tradition of non-Wiccan witchcraft. It is an ecstatic (rather than fertility) tradition stemming from the experience of Cora and Victor Anderson . Strong emphasis is placed on sensual experience and awareness, including sexual mysticism, which is not limited to heterosexual expression."The Faery Tradition" Â©1988, 1995, 2000 Anna Korn The Feri Tradition has very diverse influences, such as Huna, Vodou, Faery lore, Kabbalah, Hoodoo, Tantra, and Gnosticism. 
Among the distinguishing features of the Feri tradition is the use of a specific Feri power or energetic current. Feri witches often see themselves as "fey": outside social definitions and intentionally living within paradox. They believe that much of reality is unseen, or at least has uncertain boundaries. Within the tradition there is a deep respect for the wisdom of nature, a love of beauty, and an appreciation of bardic and mantic creativity.
Core teachings acknowledged by most branches of the tradition include the concepts of the Three Souls and the Black Heart of Innocence, the tools of the Iron and Pearl Pentacle (now commonly also used by Reclaiming (Neopaganism)), as well as an awareness of "energy ecology", which admonishes practitioners to never give away or waste their personal power. Trance experiences and personal connection to the Divine are at the heart of this path, leading to a wide variety of practices throughout the larger body of the tradition.
Feri is not a tradition of Wicca; there are Wiccan groups and traditions sometimes calling themselves "Fairy" (Faerie, Faery, etc.), but these are distinct from the Feri Tradition.Is Feri a Wiccan tradition?http://www.feritradition.org/FAQ.htm#noconnection

==Practices and beliefs==

There are several practices and beliefs in the larger body of the Feri tradition that are almost universal:

==Deities of the Feri Tradition==

While some lines place a special emphasis on certain deities or pantheons, there is no one pantheon that is universal among Feri. However, certain deities are given special importance in most lines of the tradition:
Some practitioners use the infinity symbol as a cosmological glyph to illustrate the other main deities of the tradition, sometimes called The Infinitum. As an infinity loop has two lobes, but is in fact one continuous line, so the Divine Twins appear separate, but in the universe manifest as many gods, who are still mysteriously interwoven into one: the Star Goddess. The gods of the Infinitum include beings similar to gods known in more conventional Wicca, such as the Horned God, Green Man, Mother Goddess, and Crone, and others who are very unique. Some of these gods have names and attributes of deities from diverse cultures, such as Nimue, Mari, and Krom, but they also have many aspects and attributes which are distinctively Feri.

==Significant Events==

Early in 2011, a split in the tradition broke one tradition into two. Initiates who call themselves "Feri" allow public, classroom-style teaching and teaching for pay. Initiates who teach privately and/or for free (and who prefer that the tradition be secret in its entirety) split from Feri completely.  While some of the privacy-favoring initiates chose to adopt the "Faery" spelling of the tradition in order to distinguish themselves from the public for-profit faction, some "public Feri" also use "Faery" as an alternate spelling. The term "Faery" has additional contextual uses within the neopagan milieu which are not related to the "Feri vs. Faery" question.
The "private Faery" folk see themselves as a separate tradition, yet related to Feri by common ancestry. This was not only a political split in nature, since "private Faery" also has a distinct and separate culture, theology, liturgy, and secrets that are no longer shared with their Feri cousins.[tpl]cite web|last=Pitzl-Waters|first=Jason|title=When Schism Happens to Pagans|url=http://wildhunt.org/blog/2011/01/when-schism-happens-to-pagans.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Mater|first=Art|title=The Faery Well|url=http://www.faerytradition.eu/Statement.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Ravenna|first=Morpheus|title=Two Roads Diverged in a Wood and I|url=http://shield-maiden.blogspot.com/2011/01/two-roads-diverged-in-wood-and-i.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Coyle|first=Thorn|title=The Sundering of Feri|url=http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Sundering-of-Feri-T-Thorn-Coyle-01-24-2011.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Our Principles|url=http://www.faerytradition.org/OurPrinciples.html[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The Faery Tradition|url=http://www.faerytradition.org/index.html[/tpl]
