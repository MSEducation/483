Sir John Brewer Davis (born 1741 in England; died 9 November 1817 in Westminster) is notable for his involvement in major cricket through his connections with the Kent county team. He was a noted amateur player during the 1760s and until 1773.
Davis was mainly active as a player before cricket's statistical record began in 1772. In the 1773 season, he has been recorded in two major matches playing for Kent against Surrey. He scored 23 and 4 in the first match at Laleham Burway; and 4 and 0 in the return game at Bishopsbourne Paddock. He took 2 catches in the latter match.
