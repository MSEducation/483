The Prime Minister of Jordan is the head of government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.  
The Prime Minister is appointed by the King of Jordan, along with other ministers and members of the government that the new Prime Minister recommends. The Parliament of Jordan then approves the legislative program of the new government, before the new government formally takes office. There are no constitutional limits on a Prime Minister's term, and several of them served multiple non-consecutive terms.  
The past five years have seen six different prime ministers appointed. While the government cites this variation as a sign of the King's openness towards reform, critics claim it to be an attempt to distract from the King's perceived absolutism.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sharnoffsglobalviews.com/refugees-jordan-147/|title=Refugees and the Arab Spring in Jordan|first=Michael|last=Sharnoff|work=Sharnoff's Global Views|date=24 July 2013|accessdate=2 September 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/11/jordans-experiment-does-top-down-democratic-reform-work/248000/|title=Jordan's Experiment: Does Top-Down Democratic Reform Work?|first=Shadi|last=Hamid|work=The Atlantic|date=7 November 2011|accessdate=2 September 2013[/tpl]
