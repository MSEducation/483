Keeping Up Appearances is a BBC television sitcom created and written by Roy Clarke for the BBC. Centred on the life of eccentric, social-climbing snob Hyacinth Bucket (who insists that her surname is pronounced "Bouquet"), the sitcom follows an obsessive and determined snobbish middle class woman who desperately and continually looks for opportunities to climb the social ladder by attempting to impress people (particularly rich people) and portray herself as more affluent than she truly is, despite being wedged between a working class background and upper class aspirations.
The show stars Patricia Routledge, who received two BAFTA nominations for her performance as Hyacinth.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/keepingupappearances/ |title=BBC Keeping Up Appearances page [/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Search results|url=http://www.bafta.org/search.html?pageNo=1234&q=television&w=true|work=Bafta.org|accessdate=18 July 2013[/tpl] Broadcast between 1990 and 1995 on BBC One, the sitcom spawned five series and 44 episodes—4 of which are Christmas specials. Keeping Up Appearances was a great success in the UK and also captured large audiences in the US, Canada, and Australia, but ceased production in 1995 when Routledge wanted to move on to other projects. Since its original release, all five series—including Christmas specials—are available on DVD. In 2004, the sitcom was ranked 12th in the countdown of Britain's Best Sitcom.[tpl]cite web|title=Britain's Best Sitcom - Top 11 to 100|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sitcom/top11to100.shtml|work=BBC|accessdate=29 June 2013[/tpl] It is regularly repeated worldwide (PBS in the US; BBC One, Gold, and Drama in the UK and Ireland).

==Background==

Hyacinth Bucket (Patricia Routledge)— who insists her surname is pronounced Bouquet (although in reality, "It was always 'Bucket' until I met you!")[tpl]Cite episode|series=Keeping Up Appearances |seriesno=5 |number=3 |minutes= |time=8:57|quote=Yes, I'll give you my name and address. It's "Bouquet." B-u-c-k-e-t. No, it is "Bouquet."[/tpl] — is a pompous social-climbing snob, originally from a very poor working-class background, whose main mission in life is to impress others with her lifestyle and perceived affluence and refinement. Hyacinth likes to spend her days visiting stately homes (convinced she will meet and strike up a friendship with the owners, especially if they are nobility) and hosting "executive-style" candlelight suppers (with her Royal Worcester double-glazed Avignon china and Royal Doulton china with "the hand-painted periwinkles").[tpl]Cite episode|series=Keeping Up Appearances |seriesno=5 |number=3 |minutes= |time=19:28|quote=It houses my Royal Doulton with the hand-painted periwinkles.[/tpl] She ostentatiously brags about her possessions to others, including her "white slimline telephone with automatic redial," which she always answers with "The Bouquet residence, the lady of the house speaking."[tpl]Cite episode|series=Keeping Up Appearances |seriesno=5 |number=1 |time=5:46[/tpl] (Frequently she receives calls asking for a Chinese take-away, which make her very angry.)
Hyacinth's endeavours makes other people's lives more difficult by being extremely snobbish, by continually behaving annoyingly, disturbing people by nearly forcing them to come to her candlelight suppers, and having disastrous consequences to all parties when she is executing her plans. Although Hyacinth is not deterred by the latter, everyone else is afraid of her to the point of fleeing the scene when she appears. The one who suffers the most, obviously, is her husband Richard (Clive Swift). He initially worked for the council but, at the beginning of series 3, reluctantly accepts early retirement. Although he loves and puts up with Hyacinth, he is notably annoyed by her plans and her habit of spending things. Although she is snobbish, Hyacinth regularly competes with normal people whom she considers snobbish such as Sonia Barker-Finch, Delia Wheelwright, and Lydia Hawksworth (although Lydia Hawksworth does appear to be snobbish, as she disdains kiwifruit as "lower middle-class".) Hyacinth sometimes says things like "I haven't a snobbish bone in my body" or "I can't abide such snobbery like that" when talking about her "enemies" (although she herself is snobbish).
Always hindering Hyacinth's best efforts to impress - and providing an unwelcome reminder of her less-than-refined roots - are her underclass sisters Daisy (Judy Cornwell) and Rose (Shirley Stelfox in series 1; Mary Millar thereafter), and Daisy's proudly "bone-idle" husband Onslow (Geoffrey Hughes). They, along with Hyacinth's senile father, frequently turn up inconveniently (usually in their clapped out Ford Cortina Mk IV - which always makes a characteristic backfire when it pulls up), with Hyacinth going to great lengths to avoid them (saying "Richard, you know I love my family, but that's no reason why I should have to acknowledge them in broad daylight!"). Hyacinth's father frequently has flashbacks to the Second World War, and often exhibits bizarre behavior, sometimes involving embarrassing situations with women.  (Onslow describes him as "barmy.") Two relatives Hyacinth is not ashamed of are her wealthy sister Violet (Anna Dawson) and her unseen son Sheridan. Violet frequently telephones Hyacinth for advice, allowing her to loudly announce to anyone in earshot, "It's my sister Violet - the one with a Mercedes, swimming pool, sauna, and room for a pony". However, Violet's social acceptability is damaged by the eccentric behaviour of her transvestite, equestrian-loving husband Bruce, whom she violently attacks because of his behavior. Hyacinth also tries to impress people with the intellectual prowess of her beloved Sheridan (who actually only takes courses in needlework at a polytechnic). Hyacinth boasts about the "psychic" closeness of their relationship and how often he writes to her and phones her, although he never writes to her and usually phone calls her only to ask for money (much to the despair of Richard).[tpl]Cite episode|series=Keeping Up Appearances |seriesno=5 |number=1 |minutes= |time=1:03|quote=Do you think Sheridan's voice is getting deeper?" "It's still asking for money, I know that.[/tpl] Hyacinth is blissfully oblivious to the seemingly obvious hints that Sheridan, who lives with a man named Tarquin (who makes his own curtains, wears silk pyjamas, and has won prizes for embroidery), is homosexual.
Hyacinth's neighbour Elizabeth Warden (Josephine Tewson) is frequently invited round to the Buckets for coffee.  Ordinarily calm, Liz's nerves go to pieces in Hyacinth's house, causing her to smash Hyacinth's china and spill coffee and biscuits on Hyacinth's Burmese rug.[tpl]Cite episode|series=Keeping Up Appearances |seriesno=5 |number=3 |minutes= |time=13:40[/tpl] Liz's brother Emmet moves in with her at the beginning of series 2 after a messy divorce. Hyacinth, upon learning that Emmet is a musician, frequently and horribly sings at him ("She'll sing at me!") in an attempt to get a part in one of his productions, making him terrified of leaving the house (in case she sees him).  Emmet's problems are further complicated by Hyacinth's mistaken belief that his frightened reactions indicate that he is infatuated with her, which in fact could not be further from the truth.
Hyacinth frequently confronts the postman with ridiculous complaints, such as having to receive mail bearing second-class stamps, harassing him to the point that he will go to extreme lengths not to face her; and she often forces workmen and other visitors to her home to remove their shoes before entering.  Michael, the vicar of the local church (Jeremy Gittins) is also loath to face the overbearing Hyacinth, whom he refers to (behind her back) as "the Bucket woman."  The Vicar and his wife (who constantly believes the Vicar is having an affair) sometimes exact comic revenge on Hyacinth for her snobbishness; on one occasion, when she was one of a group of volunteer helpers at the church, the Vicar's wife saw to it that Hyacinth's hand went up prematurely and assigned her the job of cleaning the church toilets.

==Cast==

==Episodes==

Keeping Up Appearances aired for five series, four Christmas specials, and one short Children in Need special, from 29 October 1990 to 25 December 1995. The series officially ended after the episode "The Pageant", because Patricia Routledge wanted to focus on other TV and theatre work, including Hetty Wainthropp Investigates which began airing in 1996. Clive Swift, who portrayed Richard, stated in a BBC interview that Routledge "didn't want to be remembered as simply 'Mrs Bucket'".[tpl]cite episode|title=Comedy Connections - Keeping Up Appearances|series=Comedy Connections|serieslink=Comedy Connections#Series Two (2004)|credits=|network=BBC|station=BBC One|airdate=26 July 2004[/tpl]

Stars Clive Swift, Josephine Tewson, Judy Cornwell, and David Griffin, along with writer Roy Clarke and producer/director Harold Snoad, all discussed the series.

===Books===

Three books related to the series have been released in the UK. Two were written by Jonathan Rice and published by BBC Books and the other one was written by Harold Snoad (the director of Keeping Up Appearances) and was published by Book Guild Publishing.
This was first published in 1993, and is a light-hearted guide to manners, as seen through Hyacinth Bucket's eyes. It is based on the TV series' scripts and contains many black-and-white photos of scenes from the show.
This was published in 1995 and is presented in a diary format chronicling a year in Hyacinth Bucket's life, with typical comments about her relations and neighbours.
This was published in late 2009, the book includes rare photos which were taken during the filming of Keeping Up Appearances. The book contains full plot synopses for all episodes, main cast details, filming locations for all episodes which used outside shots, and stories of some entertaining events which happened during filming.
Due to the popularity of Keeping Up Appearances in the United States, books about the series have also been published across the Atlantic.
This comical series guidebook was published in the late 1990s by WLIW21. It was co-authored by mother and daughter writers, Georgene and Mary Lee Costa. It features summary descriptions of each episode, cast and crew biographies, series photographs, and an interview with Harold Snoad.
Since it was written during the filming of the final series of episodes, Snoad included the co-authors of the guide as extras in the episode, “The Fancy Dress Ball.”

==Theatre adaptation==

In 2010, the television show was adapted into a play entitled Keeping Up Appearances that toured theatres in the UK.[tpl]cite web|last=Berry|first=Kevin|title=Keeping Up Appearances|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/28457/keeping-up-appearances|work=thestage.co.uk|accessdate=4 July 2013|date=3 June 2010[/tpl] The cast included Rachel Bell as Hyacinth, Kim Hartman as Elizabeth, Gareth Hale as Onslow, Steven Pinder as Emmet, Debbie Arnold as Rose, David Janson (who had previously appeared in the TV show as the postman) as Mr Edward Milton, a new character created for the stage show),[tpl]cite web|last=Burbridge|first=Steve|title=Theatre review: Keeping Up Appearances at Darlington Civic Theatre and touring|url=http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/keepingappear-rev|work=britishtheatreguide.info|accessdate=4 July 2013[/tpl] Christine Moore as Daisy and Sarah Whitlock as Mrs Debden.[tpl]cite web|last=Barr|first=Gordon|title=Preview: Keeping Up Appearances, Playhouse Whitley Bay|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/theatre/preview-keeping-up-appearances-playhouse-1416155|work=chroniclelive.co.uk|accessdate=4 July 2013|date=12 June 2010[/tpl] Main character Richard Bucket, Hyacinth's husband, does not appear in the production, but is frequently referred to: Hyacinth addresses to him off-stage and talks to him on the phone. The main plot of the show revolves around Emmet directing a play at the local village hall, but when Hyacinth is cast in the play's leading role disaster is in the making.
