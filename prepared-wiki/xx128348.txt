==Overview==

The Mundaring and Hills Historical Society was formed in 1989. Prior to this historical and heritage issues in the hills region saw significant losses of information, and loss of details of people and properties.  The Society has corrected this, being able to attract significant funding and patronage to maintain a museum and to collect a wide range of materials and information. It is also one of the organisations heavily involved in the annual Trek the Trail which utilises sections of the Railway Reserve Heritage Trail as an outdoor event.
Mundaring and Hills Historical Society was a finalist in the 2011 West Australian Heritage Awards.
