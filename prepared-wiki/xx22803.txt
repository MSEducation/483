[[Angler's loop]]

CATEGORIES: Fishing knots

An Angler's loop is a type of knot which forms a fixed loop.  Useful for fine or slippery line, it is one of the few loop knots which holds well in bungee cord.  It is quite secure but it jams badly and is not suitable if the knot will need to be untied. This loop may be tied in the bight.

==Structure==

Overhand knot on standing part and half-hitch by the working end.
