===Religious foundations===

Welfare programs for the needy are managed by more than 30 public agencies alongside semi-state organizations known as bonyads, together with several private non-governmental organizations. Bonyads are a consortium of over 120 tax-exempt organizations that receive subsidies and religious donations. They answer directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran and control over 20% of GDP.Abrahamian, History of Modern Iran (p.178). Cambridge University Press (2008), ISBN 978-0-521-52891-7 Operating everything from vast soybean and cotton farms to hotels, soft drink, auto-manufacturing and shipping lines, they are seen as overstaffed, corrupt and generally unprofitable.Dr. Abbas Bakhtiar (2007): "Ahmadinejad's Achilles Heel: The Iranian Economy". Payvand. Retrieved 12 February 2008. Bonyad companies also compete with Iran's unprotected private sector, whose firms complain of the difficulty of competing with the subsidized bonyads. Bonyads are not subject to audit or Iran's accounting laws.[ref]
