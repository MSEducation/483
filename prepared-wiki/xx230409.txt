Travellers Rest is a very small southwestern suburb of Greater Launceston and has a population of 244.
In the 19th century the area was largely uninhabited. At the junction where the road from Launceston branches — the branches lead now and led then to Longford and Hadspen — a hotel was built in 1833Dyer, p.7 by G & T Burnett. The hotel was initially called the Travellers Rest Hotel. It burned down in March 1930 due to a hotel employee's accident; he was filling a motorcycle with petrol while holding a lit storm lantern.[tpl]cite news|title=FIRE NEAR LAUNCESTON, Travellers' Rest Hotel, Occupants' narrow escape|date = 28 May 1930|work=The Mercury|location=Hobart|page=7[/tpl] By 1941 only the front wall remained, a state that led to a call for its demolition.[tpl]cite news|date=20 December 1941|title=Travellers' Rest walls cited|work=The Examiner|location=Launceston|page=6[/tpl] The remaining ruins were finally removed in 1990 when the site was covered by construction of the Bass Highway.Dyer, p.10
