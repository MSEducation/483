In 2000, [[Space.com]] described Rohrabacher as "a strident advocate for supremacy in space, a philosophy shaped along a winding road from [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] activist to White House speech writer in the Reagan administration." In 2007, Rohrabacher introduced a bill that would direct NASA to develop a strategy “for deflecting and mitigating potentially hazardous near-Earth objects.”<ref>[tpl]cite news |last=Stein |first=Jeff |title= The End Might Be Nearer Than You Think |publisher= CQ Politics |date=2008-05-16 |url= http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?parm1=5&docID=hsnews-000002877953|accessdate=2008-05-22[/tpl]</ref> Rohrabacher has applauded the [[Apollo]] astronauts claiming them as unofficial ambassadors.

===Aid to Pakistan===

In May 2011 Rohrabacher introduced a bill to stop aid to Pakistan in the wake of Osama Bin Laden's death, claiming the Pakistani's were either sheltering Bin Laden or completely incompetent. “We can no longer afford this foolishness,” said Rohrabacher. “The time has come for us to stop subsidizing those who actively oppose us. Pakistan has shown itself not to be America’s ally.” Rohrabacher also demanded the return of the US helicopter that crashed in the operation to kill Bin Laden. “If this is not done immediately, it is probable, given Pakistan’s history, that our technology has already found its way into the hands of the Communist Chinese military that is buying, building, and stealing the necessary military technology to challenge the United States,” Rohrabacher stated.http://rohrabacher.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=240546

===Foreign policy===

In February 2013, Rohrabacher gave a poignant speech urging the right to self-determination for the Baloch people in Pakistan at a UNPO conference in London.http://dawn.com/2013/02/27/us-congressman-rohrabacher-demands-referendum-in-balochistan/
In March 2005, Rohrabacher introduced HR 1061, the American Property Claims Against Ethiopia Act, which would "prohibit United States assistance to the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia until the Ethiopian government returns all property of United States citizens." The bill was introduced by Rohrabacher at the behest of Gebremedhin Berhane, a former Eritrean national and friend of the Rohrabacher family, after his business was expropriated by the Ethiopian government.
On March 7, 2006, Rohrabacher introduced HR 4895, an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, "to limit the provision of the United States military assistance and the sale, transfer, or licensing of United States military equipment or technology to Ethiopia." 
On September 8, 2008, at a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee meeting, Rorabacher argued that the Georgians had initiated the recent military confrontation in the ongoing Russian-South Ossetian conflict.

.
During an appearance on MSNBC's The Ed Show, Rohrabacher accused Barack Obama of allowing violence in Iran to get out of hand because he did not speak forcefully enough against the country's leadership. He also claimed that Gorbachev tore down the Berlin Wall because Reagan told him to (“Tear down this wall”).MSNBC "The Ed Show" Interview – Transcript 2009-06-23
In early 2010, he went to Honduras to commend the election of the new president.

===Bosnia and Kosovo independence===

Rohrabacher was opposed to American ground troops in the Yugoslav Wars. He advocated for the direct bombing of the Serb military on Serbian soil, criticizing the ineffectiveness of western forces against the Serbs, NATO was limited to small fixed attacks, as the Serbs penetrated UN safe areas and attacked Bosnian forces.  Rohrabacher said they "should bomb Serbia's military infrastructure, in Serbia – get that, in Serbia – rather than dropping a couple of duds on tents, which only proves the West's gutlessness, and emboldens Serbian cutthroats."[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hE3oIMB6aj8C&pg=PA58&dq=rohrabacher+bomb+serbs#v=snippet&q=rohrabacher%20bomb%20serbs.%20military&f=false|title=Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia at peace and at war: selected writings, 1983–2007|author=Sabrina P.

The leader of the Albanian American Civic League ethnic lobby group, Joseph J.

===Support for the Taliban in the early 1990s===

Rohrabacher voiced support for the Taliban when they seized power in the 1990s, visiting Afghanistan when it came under their control, saying that the Taliban would provide "stability", and eliminate threats to the United States.  He also claimed the Taliban "intend to establish a disciplined, moral society". He said he believed complete Taliban control over Afghanistan would be a "positive development", that they were "devout traditionalists, not terrorists or revolutionaries", and that "sensationalist" media coverage of the Taliban's introduction of Sharia law was "nonsense".[tpl]cite news|title=Congressman Dana Rohrabacher: An Expert on South and Central Asia|author=Shirl McArthur|url=http://wrmea.org/archives/174-washington-report-archives-1994-1999/november-december-1996/2354-congressman-dana-rohrabacher-an-expert-on-south-and-central-asia-.html|newspaper=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, November/December 1996, page 8|date=November–December 1996|page=8|accessdate=February 17, 2011[/tpl] Later, during the Clinton administration, he was critical of the Taliban for harboring Osama Bin Laden.http://gawker.com/5331541/barney-franks-recess-promises-to-be-100-pure-adrenaline

In 2007 Rohrabacher supported Mohiuddin Ahmed, detained in the USA, who was involved in a coup in Bangladesh during which several people were murdered. Dana halted his deportation to Bangladesh when they requested his extradition and voiced concern about his legal rights, saying that he should be sent somewhere with no death penalty.

===Defense of interrogation techniques and extraordinary rendition===

On April 17, 2007, while defending the Bush administration's program of extraordinary rendition.  During a House hearing on trans-atlantic relations, Rohrabacher stated that the unfair treatment of one innocent suspect is an acceptable "unfortunate consequence" of holding others who would otherwise be free to commit terror acts. After he received boos and groans from the gallery, Rohrabacher responded, "Well, I hope it's your families, I hope it's your families that suffer the consequences", and "I hope it's your family members that die". Rohrabacher was subsequently interrupted by protesters wearing orange jumpsuits who were removed from the gallery. For his comment that imprisoning and torturing one innocent person was a fair price to pay for locking up 50 terrorists who would "go out and plant a bomb and kill 20,000 people," Rohrabacher was named Countdown with Keith Olbermann's "Worst Person in the World" on April 25.[tpl]cite news|title=Congressman Dana Rohrabacher Personifies Why Many Dislike America and Its Policies|author=Ann Wright|url=http://www.truth-out.org/article/ann-wright-rep-rohrabacher-typifies-why-many-dislike-america|newspaper=truthout|date=23 April 2007|page=|accessdate=February 17, 2011[/tpl]Think Progress » Rep.

===Terrorism===

In 2006, Rohrabacher chaired the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the U.S. House Committee on International Relations, which investigated whether the Oklahoma City bombers had assistance from foreign sources and determined there was no conclusive evidence of a foreign connection.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/24/AR2006122400571.html | work=The Washington Post | first=John | last=Solomon | title=Panel Faults FBI in Okla.

===Illegal immigration===

Rohrabacher was an advocate for the state of California's Proposition 187, which prohibited illegal immigrants from acquiring government services. In 2004, he sponsored an amendment that would have prohibited federal reimbursement of hospital-provided emergency care and certain transportation services to undocumented aliens unless the hospital provided information about the aliens' citizenship, immigration status, financial data, and employer to the Secretary of Homeland Security. Aliens who were in the country illegally would receive reimbursement only after they were deported. The proposed bill was defeated 88 – 331.[ref]
</ref>
In early 2008, Rohrabacher endorsed Mitt Romney in the Republican presidential primary, citing his positions on stemming illegal immigration and criticizing John McCain. About McCain, he said, "He's been the enemy of those of us who have stemmed the flow of illegals into our country, whereas Romney has made some very tough commitments."
In 2011 Rohrabacher proposed the bill H.R. 787 known as the "No Social Security for Illegal Immigrants Act of 2011." The bill "Amends title II of the Social Security Act to exclude from creditable wages and self-employment income any wages earned for services by aliens performed in the United States, and self-employment income derived from a trade or business conducted in the United States, while the alien was not authorized to be so employed or to perform a function or service in such a trade or business."http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h787/show
In 2013, an 18 year old student visited Rohrabacher's office to discuss immigration reform. At some point their conversation became disagreeable, and the student claims the congressman yelled at her "I hate illegals," and threatened to deport her family, statements which Rohrabacher's spokesperson has disputed. The spokesperson claims that it was the student who started the confrontation by yelling at her and telling her to "butt out." http://www.scpr.org/blogs/politics/2013/02/14/12556/golden-west-student-says-congressman-rohrabacher-d/

===Global warming===

Rohrabacher doubts that global warming is caused by humans. During a congressional hearing on climate change on February 8, 2007, Rohrabacher mused that previous warming cycles may have been caused by carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by "dinosaur flatulence." He stated, "In fact, it is assumed at best to be unproven and at worst a liberal claptrap, trendy, but soon to go out of style in our new Congress."  On May 25, 2011, Rohrabacher expressed further skepticism regarding the existence of man-made global warming.  However, he suggested that if it is an issue, a possible solution could be clear-cutting rain forests, and possibly replanting.  This was strongly criticized by scientists, including Oliver Phillips, a geography professor at the University of Leeds.  They noted the consensus that intact forests act as net absorbers of carbon, reducing global warming.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0511/55731.html|title=Do trees cause global warming?|work=Politico|date=25 May 2011|accessdate=2011-05-30|first=Darren|last=Samuelsohn[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/republicans-climate-solution-clearcut-the-rain-forest/|title=Republican’s Climate Solution: Clear-Cut the Rain Forest|work=The New York Times|date=26 May 2011|accessdate=2011-05-30|first=John|last=Rudolf[/tpl] In response, Rohrabacher stated, "Once again those with a global agenda have created a straw man by misrepresenting the position of their critics. I do not believe that CO2 is a cause of global warming, nor have I ever advocated the reduction of CO2 through the clearing of rainforests or cutting down older trees to prevent global warming. But that is how my question to a witness during my subcommittee hearing on May 25th is being reported. I simply asked the witness, Dr. Todd Stern, who is a supporter of a global climate treaty that would dramatically hurt the standard of living for millions of human beings, if he was considering a policy that would address naturally emitted carbon dioxide, which makes up over 90% of emissions. To suggest that I’m advocating such a radical approach instead of simply questioning the policy is a total misrepresentation of my position."[tpl]cite web|url=http://rohrabacher.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=243674|title=Rohrabacher Response to Misleading Reports on His Position Concerning Rainforests and Climate Change|publisher=Office of Dana Rohrabacher|date=May 5, 2011|accessdate=June 4, 2011[/tpl]

===Ukraine===

Rohrabacher supported the right of Crimea to secede from Ukraine and join Russia in 2014. On March 6, 2014, he was one of 23 members of the House of Representatives to vote against a $1 billion loan guarantee to support the new government of Ukraine.[tpl]cite news|last=Simon|first=Richard|title=Dana Rohrabacher on Russia-Ukraine crisis: 'Putin is not Satan'|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-dana-rohrabacher-ukraine-putin-20140314,0,1857686.story#axzz2wNymU526|accessdate=19 March 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 14, 2014[/tpl] In the March 11, 2014, House of Representatives vote (402 voting yes; 7 opposed) to condemn Russia for violating Ukraine's sovereignty, Rohrabacher voted "present." Commenting on the issue, he stated, "Starting with our own American Revolution, groups of people have declared themselves, rightfully, to be under a different government or a government of their choosing. People forget that’s what our Declaration of Independence is all about." He also said, "The sanctions are an abomination of hypocrisy. This is ridiculous: What we were doing with the violence and military action we took to secure the Kosovars’ right to self-determination was far more destructive and had far more loss of life than what Putin’s done trying to ensure the people of Crimea are not cut off from what they would choose as their destiny with Russia."[tpl]cite news|last=Nelson|first=Steven|title=Crimea Policy an 'Abomination of Hypocrisy,' Says GOP Congressman|url=http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/03/18/crimea-policy-an-abomination-of-hypocrisy-says-gop-congressman|accessdate=19 March 2014|newspaper=U.S. News & World Report|date=March 18, 2014[/tpl]
