Pennsylvania Route 352 (PA 352) is a [tpl]convert|19|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] northâ€“south route that begins at U.S. Route 13 (US 13) in Chester, Delaware County and ends at US 30 in Frazer, Chester County. The route passes through suburban areas of Delaware and Chester counties, serving Parkside, Brookhaven, Elwyn, Lima, Gradyville, and Goshenville. PA 352 is a four- to five-lane road between Brookhaven and US 1, otherwise it is generally a two-lane road. The route intersects Interstate 95 (I-95) in Chester and US 1 near Lima at interchanges. PA 352 was first designated by 1928 to run between its current termini. A portion of the route between Brookhaven and US 1 was realigned to a straighter alignment in the 1950s. By 1980, PA 352 was realigned to a short concurrency with PA 3 to avoid intersecting it at a sharp angle.
