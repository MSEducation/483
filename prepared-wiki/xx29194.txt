The figure of Mother Goose is an imaginary author of a collection of fairy tales and nursery rhymesMacmillan Dictionary for Students Macmillan, Pan Ltd. (1981), page 663. Retrieved 2010-7-15. often published as Mother Goose Rhymes.  As a character, she appears in one nursery rhyme.Margaret Lima Norgaard, "Mother Goose", Encyclopedia Americana 1987; see, for instance, Peter and Iona Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (1951) 1989. A Christmas pantomime called Mother Goose is often performed in the United Kingdom. The so-called "Mother Goose" rhymes and stories have formed the basis for many classic British pantomimes. Mother Goose is generally depicted in literature and book illustration as an elderly country woman in a tall hat and shawl, a costume identical to the peasant costume worn in Wales in the early 20th century, but is sometimes depicted as a goose (usually wearing a bonnet).

==Identity==

Mother Goose is the name given to an archetypal country woman.  English readers were familiar with Mother Hubbard, already a stock figure when Edmund Spenser published his satire "Mother Hubbard's tale", 1590; with the superstitious advice on getting a husband or a wife of  "Mother Bunch", who was credited with the fairy stories of Madame d'Aulnoy when they first appeared in English.Ryoji Tsurumi, "The Development of Mother Goose in Britain in the Nineteenth Century" Folklore 101.1 (1990:28–35) p. 330 instances these, as well as the "Mother Carey" of sailor lore— "Mother Carey's Chicken" being the European Storm-petrel— and the Tudor period prophetess "Mother Shipton". Mother Goose is credited with the Mother Goose stories and rhymes; yet no specific writer has ever been identified with such a name.  An early mention appears in an aside in a versified chronicle of weekly happenings that appeared regularly for several years, Jean Loret's La Muse Historique, collected in 1650.[tpl]cite journal |last=Shahed |first=Syed Mohammad |title=A Common Nomenclature for Traditional Rhymes |jstor=1178946 |journal=Asian Folklore Studies |volume=54 |number=2 |date=1995 |pages=307–314[/tpl] His remark, comme un conte de la Mère Oye ("like a Mother Goose story") shows that the term was already familiar.
Other references to "mère l'oye" or "mère oye" occur in earlier French writings.  A compilation of satires published in 1626 mentions "un conte d'Urgande et de ma mère l'Oye," (Les satyres de Saint-Regnier)[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ux46AAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Les+satyres+de+Saint-Regnier&hl=en&ei=Lu0gTevnJIP98AaO5fjdDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Les satyres de Saint-Regnier – ...

Literary Trail of Greater Boston. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2000: 23. ISBN 0-618-05013-2 After Isaac died, Elizabeth went to live with her eldest daughter, who had married Thomas Fleet, a publisher who lived on Pudding Lane (now Devonshire Street). According to Early, "Mother Goose" used to sing songs and ditties to her grandchildren all day, and other children swarmed to hear them. Finally, her son-in-law gathered her jingles together and printed them.Reader's Digest April 1939:28.
In The Real Personages of Mother Goose (1930), Katherine Elwes Thomas submits that the image and name "Mother Goose", or "Mère l'Oye", may be based upon ancient legends of the wife of King Robert II of France, Berthe la fileuse ("Bertha the Spinner") or Berthe pied d'oie ("Goose-Foot Bertha" ), called in the Midi the reine Pedauque  who, according to Thomas, is often referred in French legends as spinning incredible tales that enraptured children. The authority on the Mother Goose tradition, Iona Opie, does not give any credence to either the Elwes Thomas or the Boston suppositions.

==Perrault's Tales of My Mother Goose==

The initiator of the literary fairy tale genre, Charles Perrault, published in 1695 under the name of his son a collection of fairy tales Histoires ou contes du temps passés, avec des moralités, which became better known under its subtitle of Contes de ma mère l'Oye or Tales of My Mother Goose. Perrault's publication marks the first authenticated starting-point for Mother Goose stories.
In 1729 an English translation of Perrault's collection appeared, Robert Samber's Histories or Tales of Past Times, Told by Mother Goose,Reprinted, Garland Publishing Co., 1977. which introduced Sleeping Beauty, Little Red Riding Hood, Puss in Boots, Cinderella and other Perrault tales to English-speaking audiences. These were fairy tales.
The first public appearance of the Mother Goose stories in the New World was in Worcester, Massachusetts, where printer Isaiah Thomas reprinted Samber's volume under the same title, in 1786.Charles Francis Potter, Mother Goose, Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology, and Legends II (1950), p. 751f.

==Mother Goose as nursery rhymes==

John Newbery was once believed to have published a compilation of English nursery rhymes entitled [tpl]visible anchor|Mother Goose's Melody[/tpl], or, Sonnets for the cradle[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.archive.org/details/mothergoosesmelo00pridiala |title=Mother Goose's melody : Prideaux, William Francis, 1840–1914 : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=14 February 2012[/tpl] some time in the 1760s, but the first edition was probably published in 1780 or 1781 by Thomas Carnan, one of Newbery's successors. This edition was registered with the Stationers' Company in 1780. However, no copy has been traced, and the earliest surviving edition is dated 1784.Nigel Tattersfield in Mother Goose's melody ... (a facsimile of an edition of ca. 1795, Oxford: Bodleian Library, 2003). The name "Mother Goose" has been associated, in the English-speaking world, with children's poetry ever since.[tpl]cite book |last1=Driscoll |first1=Michael |last2=Hamilton |first2=Meredith |last3=Coons |first3=Marie |title=A Child's Introduction Poetry |publisher=Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers |year=2003 |page=10 |isbn=1-57912-282-5 |url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/A-Childs-Introduction-to-Poetry/Michael-Driscoll/e/9781579122829[/tpl]
In 1837, John Bellenden Ker Gawler published a book (with a 2nd-volume sequel in 1840) deriving the origin of the Mother Goose rhymes from Flemish ('Low Dutch') puns.[tpl]cite news |last=Shilling |first=Jane |title= |newspaper=The Sunday Times |date=20 May 2005 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article524173.ece?token=null&offset=12&page=2 |accessdate=26 September 2010[/tpl]
In music, Maurice Ravel wrote Ma mère l'oye, a suite for the piano, which he then orchestrated for a ballet. There is also a song called "Mother Goose" by progressive rock band Jethro Tull from their 1971 Aqualung album. The song seems to be unrelated to the figure of Mother Goose since she is only the first of many surreal images that the narrator encounters and describes through the lyrics.

=="Old Mother Goose"==

In addition to being the purported author of nursery rhymes, Mother Goose is herself the title character of one such rhyme:

==Pantomime==

The transition from a shadowy generic figure to one with such concrete actions was effected at a pantomime Harlequin and Mother Goose: or, The Golden Egg in 1806–07, Ryoji Tsurumi has shown;Tsurumi 1990:28–35. The pantomime was first performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, on 29 December, and many times repeated in the new year. Harlequin and Mother Goose: or, The Golden Egg, starring the famous clown Joseph Grimaldi, was written by Thomas Dibdin, who invented the actions suitable for a Mother Goose brought to the stage, and recreated her as a witch-figure, Tsurumi notes: in the first scene the stage directions show her raising a storm and, for the very first time, flying a gander. The magical Mother Goose transformed the old miser into Pantaloon of the commedia dell'arte and the British pantomime tradition, and the young lovers Colin and Colinette, into Harlequin and Columbine. Played en travesti by Samuel SimmonsTsurumi (1990:30) notes that Simmon's "Mother Goose" was memorialised at the time in a popular engraving. – a pantomime tradition that survives today – she also raises a ghost in a macabre churchyard scene.
