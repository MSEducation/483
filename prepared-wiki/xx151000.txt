===Atlanta Falcons===

Jackson was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Atlanta Falcons in 2006. In week 7 of his rookie season, Jackson was activated as starting nose guard to replace veteran Pro Bowler Rod Coleman, who is out with a toe injury. In only his second start, Jackson got his first sack in the NFL against the Cleveland Browns.
Jackson was waived by the Falcons during final cuts on September 1, 2007.

Two days after being released by Atlanta, Jackson was signed to the practice squad of the Kansas City Chiefs on September 3, 2007. Following the season, he was re-signed by the Chiefs.
Jackson spent most of the 2008 season on the practice squad but did play in four games for the Chiefs in 2008, recording two tackles. He was re-signed to a future contract on December 30. He was waived on June 19, 2009.
Jackson then turned down the opportunity to play for the Philadelphia Eagles and later decided to pursue a doctoral degree.
