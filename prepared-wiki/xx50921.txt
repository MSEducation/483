===1920s===

In 1925, Houdina Radio Control demonstrated the radio-controlled driverless car "linrrican Wonder" at New York City streets, traveling up Broadway and down Fifth Avenue through the thick of the traffic jam. The linrrican Wonder was a 1926 Chandler that was equipped with a transmitting antennae on the tonneau and was operated by a second car that followed it and sent out radio impulses which were caught by the transmitting antennae. The antennae introduced the signals to a circuit- breakers which operated small electric motors that directed every movement of the car. Achen Motor, a distributor of cars in Milwaukee and surrounding territory, used Francis' invention under the name "Phantom Auto" and demonstrated it in December 1926 at the streets of Milwaukee.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=unBQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QQ8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7304,3766749|title='Phantom Auto' will tour city|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|publisher=Google News Archive|date=8 December 1926|accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl] It was demonstrated again in June 1932 at the streets of Fredericksburg as a feature attraction of Bigger Bargain Day in which most of the merchants of the city were participating.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PthNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yYoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6442,3879017|title="Phantom Auto" to Be Operated Here|work=The Free-Lance Star|publisher=Google News Archive|date=17 June 1932|accessdate=14 September 2013[/tpl]

===1930s===

An early representation of the autonomous car was Norman Bel Geddes's Futurama exhibit sponsored by General Motors at the 1939 World's Fair, which depicted electric cars powered by circuits embedded in the roadway and controlled by radio.O'Toole (2009) pp. 189-192

===1950s===

In 1953, RCA Labs successfully built a miniature car that was guided and contolled by wires that were laid in a pattern on a laboratory floor. The system sparked the imagination of Leland M. Hancock, traffic engineer in the Nebraska Department of Roads, and of his director, L. N. Ress, state engineer. The decision was made to experiment with the system in actual highway installations. In 1958, a full size system was successfully demonstrated by RCA Labs and the State of Nebraska on a 400-foot strip of public highway just outside Lincoln, Neb. A series of experimental detector circuits buried in the pavement were a series of lights along the edge of the road. The detector circuits were able to send impulses to guide the car and determine the presence and velocity of any metallic vehicle on its surface. It was developed in collaboration with General Motors, who paired two standard models with equipment consisting of special radio receivers and audible and visual warning devices that were able to simulate automatic steering, accelerating and brake control. It was further demonstrated on 5 June 1960, at RCA Lab's headquarter in Princeton, New Jersey, where reporters were allowed to "drive" on the cars. Commercialization of the system was expected to happen by 1975.[tpl]cite news|title=ELECTRONIC ROADS CALLED PRACTICAL|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10C13FE395916738DDDAF0894DE405B808AF1D3|newspaper=nytimes.com|date=6 June 1960|first=Joseph C.|last=Ingraham[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vUpeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3WANAAAAIBAJ&pg=6885,3667738|title=Reporter Rides Driverless Car|work=The Press-Courier|publisher=Google News Archive|date=7 June 1960|accessdate=21 July 2013[/tpl] Also during the 1950s throughout the 1960s, General Motors showcased the Firebirds, a series of experimental cars that were described to have an "electronic guide system can rush it over an automatic highway while the driver relaxes".

===1960s===

In 1960, Ohio State University's Communication and Control Systems Laboratory launched a project to develop driverless cars which were activated by electronic devices imbedded in the roadway. Head of the project, Dr. Robert L. Cosgriff, claimed in 1966 that the system could be ready for installation on a public road in 15 years.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MKskAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PaEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3093,3999582|title=This Automobile Doesn't Need Driver|work=Palm Beach Daily News|publisher=Google News Archive|date=15 December 1966|accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl]
In the early 1960s, the Bureau of Public Roads considered the construction of an experimental electronically controlled highway. Four states - Ohio, Massachusetts, New York and California - were bidding for the construction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zUxQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TQ4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7032,1811148|title=DiSalle Seeks Road Funds In Washington|date=3 August 1961|publisher=Toledo Blade[/tpl]
During the 1960s, the United Kingdom's Transport and Road Research Laboratory tested a driverless Citroen DS that interacted with magnetic cables that were embedded in the road. It went through a test track at [tpl]convert|80|mph|kph[/tpl] without deviation of speed or direction in any weather conditions, and in a far more effective way than by human control. Research continued in the '70s with cruise control devices activated by signals in the cabling beneath the tracks. According to cost benefit analyses that were made, adoption of system on the British motorways would been repaid by end of the century, increase the road capacity by at least 50% and prevent around 40% of the accidents. Funding for these experiments was withdrawn by the mid-1970s.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/4750544/Cruising-into-the-future.html|title=Cruising into the future|date=26 May 2001|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|location=London|first=John|last=Reynolds[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/how-the-first--driverless-car--was-invented-in-britain-in-1960-093127757.html#TAIMeVa|title=How the first "driverless car" was invented in Britain in 1960|date=17 July 2013|publisher=Yahoo!

Also during the 1960s and the 1970s, Bendix Corporation developed and tested autonomous cars that were powered and controlled by buried cables, with wayside communicators relaying computer messages.

===1980s===

In the 1980s, a vision-guided Mercedes-Benz robotic van, designed by Ernst Dickmanns and his team at the Bundeswehr University Munich in Munich, Germany, achieved a speed of [tpl]convert|39|mph|kph[/tpl] on streets without traffic. Subsequently, EUREKA conducted the [tpl]currency|749 million|Teuro[/tpl] Prometheus Project on autonomous vehicles from 1987 to 1995.
In the same decade, the DARPA-funded Autonomous Land Vehicle (ALV) project in the United States made use of new technologies developed by the University of Maryland, Carnegie Mellon University, the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan, Martin Marietta and SRI International. The ALV project achieved the first road-following demonstration that used laser radar, computer vision and autonomous robotic control to direct a robotic vehicle at speeds of up to [tpl]convert|19|mph|kph[/tpl]. In 1987, HRL Laboratories (formerly Hughes Research Labs) demonstrated the first off-road map and sensor-based autonomous navigation on the ALV. The vehicle traveled over [tpl]convert|2000|ft|m[/tpl] at [tpl]convert|1.9|mph|kph[/tpl] on complex terrain with steep slopes, ravines, large rocks, and vegetation.

===1990s===

In 1991, the United States Congress passed the ISTEA Transportation Authorization bill, which instructed USDOT to "demonstrate an automated vehicle and highway system by 1997."  The Federal Highway Administration took on this task, first with a series of Precursor Systems Analsyes and then by establishing the National Automated Highway System Consortium (NAHSC). This cost-shared project was led by FHWA and General Motors, with Caltrans, Delco, Parsons Brinkerhoff, Bechtel, UC-Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon University, and Lockheed Martin as additional partners.  Extensive systems engineering work and research culminated in Demo '97  on I-15 in San Diego, California, in which about 20 automated vehicles, including cars, buses, and trucks, were demonstrated to thousands of onlookers, attracting extensive media coverage.  The demonstrations involved close-headway platooning intended to operate in segregated traffic, as well as "free agent" vehicles intended to operate in mixed traffic.  Other carmakers were invited to demonstrate their systems, such that Toyota and Honda also participated.  While the subsequent aim was to produce a system design to aid commercialization, the program was cancelled in the late 1990s due to tightening research budgets at USDOT. Overall funding for the program was in the range of $90 million.[tpl]cite book|last=Bishop|first=Richard|title=Intelligent Vehicle Technologies and Trends|year=2005|publisher=Artech House|location=Boston|isbn=978-1580539111|page=300|url=http://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Vehicle-Technology-Trends-Library/dp/1580539114[/tpl]
In 1994, the twin robot vehicles VaMP and Vita-2 of Daimler-Benz and Ernst Dickmanns of UniBwM drove more than  [tpl]convert|620|mi|km[/tpl] on a Paris three-lane highway in standard heavy traffic at speeds up to  [tpl]convert|81|mph|kph[/tpl], albeit semi-autonomously with human interventions.

In 1995, Dickmanns' re-engineered autonomous S-Class Mercedes-Benz undertook a [tpl]convert|990|mi|km|[/tpl] journey from Munich in Bavaria, Germany to Copenhagen, Denmark and back, using saccadic computer vision and transputers to react in real time. The robot achieved speeds exceeding [tpl]convert|109|mph|kph[/tpl] on the German Autobahn, with a mean time between human interventions of [tpl]convert|5.6|mi|km[/tpl], or 95% autonomous driving. It drove in traffic, executing manoeuvres to pass other cars. Despite being a research system without emphasis on long distance reliability, it drove up to [tpl]convert|98|mi|km[/tpl] without human intervention.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl]
In 1995, the Carnegie Mellon University Navlab project achieved 98.2% autonomous driving on a [tpl]convert|3100|mi|km[/tpl] cross-country journey which was dubbed "No Hands Across America". This car, however, was semi-autonomous by nature: it used neural networks to control the steering wheel, but throttle and brakes were human-controlled.No Hands Across America Home Page. Retrieved 4 February 2013.
In 1996, (now Professor) Alberto Broggi  of the University of Parma launched  the ARGO Project, which worked on enabling a modified Lancia Thema to follow the normal (painted) lane marks in an unmodified highway. The culmination of the project was a journey of [tpl]convert|1,200|mi|km[/tpl] over six days on the motorways of northern Italy dubbed Mille Miglia in Automatico ("One thousand automatic miles"), with an average speed of [tpl]convert|56|mph|kph[/tpl]. The car operated in fully automatic mode for 94% of its journey, with the longest automatic stretch being [tpl]convert|34|mi|km[/tpl]. The vehicle had only two black-and-white low-cost video cameras on board and used stereoscopic vision algorithms to understand its environment.

===2000s===

The US Government funded three military efforts known as Demo I (US Army), Demo II (DARPA), and Demo III (US Army). Demo III (2001)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.isd.mel.nist.gov/documents/albus/4DRCS.pdf |format=PDF|title=4-D/RCS reference model architecture for unmanned ground vehicles[/tpl] demonstrated the ability of unmanned ground vehicles to navigate miles of difficult off-road terrain, avoiding obstacles such as rocks and trees.  James Albus at the National Institute for Standards and Technology provided the Real-Time Control System which is a hierarchical control system.  Not only were individual vehicles controlled (e.g. throttle, steering, and brake), but groups of vehicles had their movements automatically coordinated in response to high level goals.

In June 2011, the Nevada Legislature passed a law to authorize the use of autonomous cars. Nevada thus became the first jurisdiction in the world where autonomous vehicles might be legally operated on public roads. The bill was signed into law by Nevada's Governor on 16 June 2011. According to the law, the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles (NDMV) is responsible for setting safety and performance standards and the agency is responsible for designating areas where autonomous cars may be tested.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/06/ab511-20110625.html|title=Nevada enacts law authorizing autonomous (driverless) vehicles |publisher=Green Car Congress|date=25 June 2011 |accessdate=25 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://blogs.forbes.com/alexknapp/2011/06/22/nevada-passes-law-authorizing-driverless-cars/|title=Nevada Passes Law Authorizing Driverless Cars|author=Alex Knapp|work=Forbes|date=22 June 2011|accessdate=25 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110628165915/http://blogs.forbes.com/alexknapp/2011/06/22/nevada-passes-law-authorizing-driverless-cars/| archivedate= 28 June 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2011/06/24/nevada-state-law-paves-the-way-for-driverless-cars/|title=Nevada state law paves the way for driverless cars |author=Christine Dobby |work=Financial Post|date=24 June 2011 |accessdate=25 June 2011[/tpl]  The law went into effect on 1 March 2012.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/08/uk-usa-nevada-google-idUSLNE84701320120508|title=Google gets first robotic car license in Nevada|first=Mary |last=Slosson |work=Reuters|date=8 May 2012|accessdate=9 May 2012[/tpl] This legislation was supported by Google in an effort to legally conduct further testing of its Google driverless car.
The Nevada law defines an autonomous vehicle to be "a motor vehicle that uses artificial intelligence, sensors and global positioning system coordinates to drive itself without the active intervention of a human operator." The law also acknowledges that the operator will not need to pay attention while the car is operating itself. Google had further lobbied for an exemption from a ban on distracted driving to permit occupants to send text messages while sitting behind the wheel, but this did not become law.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/science/11drive.html?_r=1&emc=eta1|title=Google Lobbies Nevada To Allow Self-Driving Cars|author=John Markoff|work=The New York Times|date=10 May 2011|accessdate=11 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/76th2011/Bills/AB/AB511_EN.pdf|title=Bill AB511 Nevada Legislature|publisher=Nevada Legislature|accessdate=25 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1062178_nevada-passes-law-allowing-self-driving-cars|title=Nevada Passes Law Allowing Self-Driving Cars|author= Tim Healey|work=Motor Trend|date=24 June 2011 |accessdate=25 June 2011[/tpl]  Furthermore, Nevada's regulations require a person behind the wheel and one in the passenger’s seat during tests.
In May 2012, the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) issued the first license for a self-driven car to a Toyota Prius modified with Google's experimental driverless technology. Google's autonomous system permits a human driver to take control of the vehicle at any time by stepping on the brake or turning the wheel. License plates issued in Nevada for autonomous cars will have a red background and feature an infinity symbol (∞) on the left side, which, according to the DMV Director, "was the best way to represent the 'car of the future'."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/may/07/nevada-issues-google-first-license-self-driving-ca/|title=Nevada issues Google first license for self-driving car|author=Cy Ryan|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=7 May 2012|accessdate=12 May 2012[/tpl]
On 1 July 2012, Florida became the second state to recognize the legality of autonomous vehicles. Florida's law clarifies that, "the State does not prohibit or specifically regulate the testing or operation of autonomous … vehicles on public roads."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=_h0119er.docx&DocumentType=Bill&BillNumber=0119&Session=2012|title=FL HB 192 of 2012 as enrolled |publisher=State of Florida |accessdate=8 February 2013[/tpl]
On 25 September 2012, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill allowing the legalization of driverless cars in the state of California which also requires the California Department of Motor Vehicles to draft regulations by 2015.[tpl]cite web|title=Google's Sergey Brin joins California Gov.

Slate.com. 5 September 2012. Retrieved 7 January 2013.
In the 2013–2014 legislative session, Colorado and Michigan introduced legislation addressing the regulation of autonomous vehicles. Governor Rick Snyder signed legislation allowing the testing of automated or self-driving vehicles on Michigan’s roads in December 2013, but requires a human in the driver seat at all time while the vehicle is in use. Colorado's proposed bill was rejected in committee in February 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2013/02/05/colorado-rejects-driverless-car-proposal/|title=MColorado Rejects Driverless Car Proposal |publisher=CBS Local Denver|date=5 February 2013 |accessdate=8 February 2013[/tpl]

==Vehicular communication systems==

Individual vehicles may benefit from information obtained from other vehicles in the vicinity, especially information relating to traffic congestion and safety hazards. Vehicular communication systems use vehicles and roadside units as the communicating nodes in a peer-to-peer network, providing each other with information. As a cooperative approach, vehicular communication systems can allow all cooperating vehicles to be more effective. According to a 2010 study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicular communication systems could help avoid up to 81 percent of all traffic accidents.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
In 2012, computer scientists at the University of Texas in Austin began developing smart intersections designed for autonomous cars. The intersections will have no traffic lights and no stop signs, instead using computer programs that will communicate directly with each car on the road.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/video/2012/03/22/no-lights-no-signs-no-accidents-future-i?videoId=232193655 |title=No lights, no signs, no accidents - future intersections for driverless cars | Video |publisher=Reuters.com |date= |accessdate=28 April 2012[/tpl]

==Public opinion surveys==

In a 2011 online survey of 2,006 consumers in the US and the UK conducted by Accenture, 49% of those surveyed said they would be comfortable using a "driverless car".[tpl]cite web|url=http://newsroom.accenture.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=5146|title=Consumers in US and UK Frustrated with Intelligent Devices That Frequently Crash or Freeze, New Accenture Survey Finds|publisher=Accenture|date=10 October 2011|accessdate=30 June 2013[/tpl] According to a 2012 survey of 17,400 vehicle owners conducted by J.D. Power and Associates, 37% of all survey responders initially said they would be interested in purchasing a fully autonomous car. However, that figure dropped to 20% once they learned the technology would cost an additional $3,000. With an additional cost of $3,000, 25% of the male vehicle buyers were willing to pay for a fully autonomous vehicle, while only 14 percent of women wanted the feature.[tpl]cite web|last=Yvkoff |first=Liane |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-57422698-48/many-car-buyers-show-interest-in-autonomous-car-tech/ |title=Many car buyers show interest in autonomous car tech |publisher=CNET |date=27 April 2012 |accessdate=30 June 2013[/tpl]
According to a survey of about 1,000 German drivers that were conducted by the German automotive research company Puls, 22% of the respondents had a positive attitude towards these cars, 10% were undecided, 44% were skeptical and 24% were hostile towards autonomous cars.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.motorvision.de/service-ratgeber/selbstfahrende-autos-deutschland-22-prozent-deutschen-grosse-akzeptanz-roboterfahrzeuge-39281.html|title=Große Akzeptanz für selbstfahrende Autos in Deutschland|publisher=motorvision.de|date=9 October 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013[/tpl]
