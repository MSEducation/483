A handkerchief [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|ŋ|k|ər|tʃ|ɪ|f[/tpl], also called a handkercher or hanky, is a form of a kerchief, typically a hemmed square of thin fabric that can be carried in the pocket or purse, and which is intended for personal hygiene purposes such as wiping one's hands or face, or blowing one's nose. A handkerchief is also sometimes used as a purely decorative accessory in a suit pocket.

==Modern usage==

The material of a handkerchief can be symbolic of the social-economic class of the user, not only because some materials are more expensive, but because some materials are more absorbent and practical for those who use a handkerchief for more than style.  Handkerchiefs can be made of cotton, cotton-synthetic blend, synthetic fabric, silk, or linen.
Handkerchiefs were also used, especially by children, as an impromptu way to carry around small items when a bag or basket was unavailable. They could also serve as a substitute for a bandage over a small injury.  In the United Kingdom, the habit of wearing a handkerchief with tied corners on one's head at the beach has become a seaside postcard stereotype, referenced by the Gumby characters in Monty Python's Flying Circus.
Signals may also be sent by handkerchief, such as the American LGBT handkerchief codes. In Spanish football or in bullfighting, it is a common sight to see supporters waving white handkerchiefs as an expression of deep emotion. It is used both positively, in admiration of an exceptional performance by a team or player, or as a negative sign of disgust at an especially bad performance.
Besides their intended use, they could be used by soldiers, campers, hunters, and other outdoorsmen for cleaning equipment, pre-inspection shoe-buffing, cleaning hands and face, signal flag to attract attention, sweat band, neckerchief, bandanna to protect the nose/mouth from blowing dust or cold, neck sun-protectors on caps or helmets (havelock), tied over a cap to retain it in high winds or to protect the ears in the cold, tie a knot in each corner and use as an emergency substitute sun cap, tie two together for a replacement trousers belt, tie broken camping equipment components together, tear in strips and knot together to provide a securing cord/strap, repair footwear, cut out pieces to patch clothes, cut up as emergency firearms cleaning patches, Molotov cocktail wick (fire-bomb), place a bar of soap or rock in the center and fold it together and tie a knot for a blackjack, wrap up food, impromptu water or fuel filter (not completely adequate), hot cooking utensil holder, bandage, tourniquet, arm sling, tie on splints, gag and secure prisoners, etc.
Disposable paper handkerchiefs have a long history in Japan where as early as the 17th-century:
and today the use of a cloth handkerchief is considered old-fashioned or unhygienic to blow the nose in some parts of the world, because they are stored in a pocket or a purse after being used.

==Origin==

Before people used the word handkerchief, the word kerchief alone was common. This term came from two French words: couvrir, which means “to cover,” and chef, which means “head.”
In the time of ancient Greece and Rome, handkerchiefs were often used the way they are today. But in the Middle Ages, kerchiefs were usually used to cover the head.
Then in the 16th century, people in Europe began to carry kerchiefs in their pockets to wipe their forehead or their nose. To distinguish this kind of kerchief from the one used to cover the head, the word hand was added to kerchief.
King Richard II of England, who reigned from 1377 to 1399, is widely believed to have invented the cloth handkerchief, as surviving documents written by his courtiers describe his use of square pieces of cloth to wipe his nose. Certainly they were in existence by Shakespeare's time, and a handkerchief is an important plot device in his play Othello.

==Suit accessories==

In addition to carrying for practical purposed, handkerchiefs have long been displayed in the top pocket of mens jackets. Used it this way, they are referred to as a pocket handkerchief - or pocket square. As a visible fashion item there are a wide variety of ways to fold a pocket square, ranging from the austere to the flamboyant:
