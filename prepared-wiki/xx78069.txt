CATEGORIES: National symbols of Nauru, National flags

Following the indepencence of Nauru, the flag of Nauru was raised for the first time.
The flag, chosen in a local design competition, was adopted on independence day, 31 January 1968. It depicts Nauru's geographical position, one degree below the Equator. A gold horizontal stripe representing the Equator runs across a blue field for the Pacific Ocean. Nauru itself is symbolized by a white 12-pointed star. Each point represents one of the 12 indigenous tribes on the island.

==Proportions and symbolism==

The flag displays the geographical location of the island nation.
The narrow yellow stripe with a width of 1/24 of the length of the flag represents the Equator.
The twelve-pointed white star signifies the location of the island in the blue waters of the Pacific Ocean just south of the Equator.  The separation of the blue flag cloth into two equal parts recalls the saga, that the first inhabitants were to have been brought to Earth from two boulders.
The twelve points on the star represent the island's twelve original tribes.
The white represents the phosphate, through which the island's residents acquired wealth from mining.

==Creation and adoption==

The flag was created by a resident employed by the Australian flag manufacturer Evans. It was officially adopted on 31 January 1968. Unlike some flags of Pacific nations (e.g., that of Tuvalu), Nauru's flag has evoked little controversy.
