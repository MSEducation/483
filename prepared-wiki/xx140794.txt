"Brasil" is a pop-rock song written and performed by Cazuza, recorded as the sixth track in his third solo album Ideologia (1988). The most well-known version of this song was recorded as a samba by Gal Costa on the soundtrack album of the telenovela Vale Tudo (1988).

==Song information==

The lyrics of "Brasil" were composed by Cazuza and Nilo Romero, and the music by George Israel (saxophone player of Kid Abelha). The song expresses an anti-nationalist feeling and a pessimist view on the Brazilian lifestyle and "way to handle things" (the famous "jeitinho brasileiro"). Although the song was featured on the soundtrack of Vale Tudo, a Rede Globo telenovela, it criticized the popular fascination with the network's newsmagazine program Fant√°stico.
