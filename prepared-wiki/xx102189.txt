==History==

NetNewsWire was developed by Brent and Sheila Simmons for their company Ranchero Software. It was introduced on July 12, 2002, with NetNewsWire Lite, a free version missing some advanced features of the (then commercial) version,[tpl]cite web| title =NetNewsWire feature chart| publisher =NewsGator| url =http://www.newsgator.com/nnwlite-compare.aspx?nnw=1| accessdate =2007-05-30[/tpl] introduced some weeks later. Version 1.0 was released on February 11, 2003, and version 2.0 was released in May 2005. At that time it included custom feed views, custom downloading and opening of podcasts, synchronization of feeds and feed status between computers, Bloglines support, and a built-in tabbed browser.
In October 2005, NewsGator bought NetNewsWire, bringing their NewsGator Online RSS synchronization service to OS X.[tpl]cite web| last =Fleischman| first =Glenn| title =NewsGator Acquires NetNewsWire| work =TidBITS| publisher =Adam C.

NetNewsWire 3.0 was released on June 5, 2007.[tpl]cite web| last =McNulty| first =Scott| title =NetNewsWire 3.0 now available| work =TUAW| date =2007-06-05| url =http://www.tuaw.com/2007/06/05/netnewswire-3-0-now-available/| accessdate =2007-06-05[/tpl] The version added Spotlight indexing of news items, integration with iCal, iPhoto, Address Book, and VoodooPad, Growl support, a new user interface, performance enhancements, and more.
The application was originally shareware, but became free with the release of NetNewsWire 3.1 on January 10, 2008. NetNewsWire Lite was discontinued at the same time. NetNewsWire 3.2 moved to an advertisement-supported model, with an option to purchase the application to remove ads.
An iOS version of NetNewsWire with support for the iPhone, iPod Touch and later for the iPad was released on the first day of the App Store. It includes syncing of unread articles with the desktop version.
NetNewsWire Lite 4.0 was introduced on March 3, 2011 on the Mac App Store. While it misses several of the advanced features included in NetNewsWire 3.2, it includes a completely rewritten code base. In the future, this will be used in the iOS versions of the app and for NetNewsWire 4.0 which will be shareware again.[tpl]cite web| title =The return of NetNewsWire Lite| publisher =Brent Simmons| url =http://inessential.com/2011/03/02/the_return_of_netnewswire_lite| accessdate =2011-06-12[/tpl]
