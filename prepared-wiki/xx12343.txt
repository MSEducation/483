CATEGORIES: Construction records, Lists of buildings and structures, Lists of tallest structures

The world's tallest man-made structure is the [tpl]convert|829.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] tall Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The building gained the official title of "Tallest Building in the World" at its opening on January 4, 2010.
The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, an organization that certifies buildings as the "World’s Tallest", recognizes a building only if at least fifty percent of its height is made up of floor plates containing habitable floor area.[tpl]cite web |title=CTBUH Criteria for Defining and Measuring Tall Buildings |url=http://www.ctbuh.org/HighRiseInfo/TallestDatabase/Criteria/tabid/446/Default.aspx |publisher=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |accessdate=August 19, 2008[/tpl] Structures that do not meet this criterion, such as the CN Tower, are defined as "towers".
There are dozens of radio and television broadcasting towers which measure over 600 metres (about 2,000 ft) in height, and only the tallest are recorded in publicly available information sources.

==Debate over definitions==

When assessing the placings of structures, there is some debate about:
For buildings, there is debate over:

==Tallest structures==

thumb|upright|The CN Tower in Toronto, Canada, was the world's tallest freestanding structure from 1975 to 2007. This category does not require the structure be "officially" opened.
The tallest man-made structure is Burj Khalifa, a skyscraper in Dubai that reached [tpl]convert|829.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in height on January 17, 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.business24-7.ae/articles/2009/1/pages/01182009_63dc3a90c9a848219058be301f3f7ded.aspx |title=Burj Dubai all set for 09/09/09 soft opening |publisher=Emirates Business24/7 |accessdate=January 17, 2009[/tpl] By April 7, 2008 it had been built higher than the KVLY-TV mast in North Dakota, USA.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.emaar.ae/MediaCenter/PressReleases/2008April07.asp|title=Burj Dubai surpasses KVLY-TV mast to become the world’s tallest man-made structure|publisher=Emaar|accessdate=May 28, 2008[/tpl] That September it officially surpassed Poland's [tpl]convert|646.38|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] Warsaw radio mast, which stood from 1974 to 1991, to become the tallest structure ever built. Guyed lattice towers such as these masts had held the world height record since 1954.
The CN Tower in Toronto, Canada, standing at [tpl]convert|553.3|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], was formerly the world's tallest completed freestanding structure on land. Opened in 1976, it was surpassed in height by the rising Burj Khalifa on September 12, 2007.[tpl]cite news| title = CN Tower dethroned by Dubai building |location=Canada  | publisher=CBC News | date = September 12, 2007 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/09/12/cntower-surpassed.html?ref=rss | accessdate = September 2, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite press release | title = Burj Dubai scales 150 storeys and is the world’s tallest free-standing structure | publisher=Emaar Properties PJSC | date = September 13, 2007 | url = http://www.emaar.com/MediaCenter/PressReleases/2008September01.asp | accessdate = September 2, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news | title = Dubai building surpasses CN Tower in height | work=CTV.ca | publisher=CTVglobemedia | date = September 13, 2007 | url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070913/cn_tower_070913/20070913?hub=TorontoHome | accessdate = September 2, 2008[/tpl] It has the world's highest public observation deck at [tpl]convert|446.5|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl].
The Petronius Platform stands [tpl]convert|610|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] off the sea floor leading some, including Guinness World Records 2007, to claim it as the tallest freestanding structure in the world. However, it is debated whether underwater height should be counted in the same manner as height below ground is ignored on buildings. The Troll A platform is [tpl]convert|472|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], without any part of that height being supported by wires. The tension-leg type of oil platform has even greater below-water heights with several examples more than [tpl]convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] deep. However, these platforms are not considered constant structures as the vast majority of their height is made up of the length of the tendons attaching the floating platforms to the sea floor. Despite this, Guinness World Records 2009 listed the Ursa tension leg platform as the tallest structure in the world with a total height of [tpl]convert|1306|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. The Magnolia Tension-leg Platform in the Gulf of Mexico is even taller with a total height of [tpl]convert|1432|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl].
Taipei 101 in Taipei, Taiwan, set records in three of the four skyscraper categories at the time it opened in 2004; at the time the Burj Khalifa opened in 2010 it remained the world's tallest inhabited building [tpl]convert|509.2|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] as measured to its architectural height (spire). The height of its roof [tpl]convert|449.2|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] and highest occupied floor [tpl]convert|439.2|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] had been surpassed by the Shanghai World Financial Center with corresponding heights of [tpl]convert|487|and|474|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) was the highest in the final category: the greatest height to top of antenna of any building in the world at [tpl]convert|527.3|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl].
Burj Khalifa broke the height record in all four categories for completed buildings by a wide margin.

===Tallest structure by category===

Due to the disagreements over how to measure height and classify structures, engineers have created various definitions for categories of buildings and other structures. One measure includes the absolute height of a building, another includes only spires and other permanent architectural features, but not antennas. The tradition of including the spire on top of a building and not including the antenna dates back to the rivalry between the Chrysler Building and 40 Wall Street. A modern-day example is that the antenna on top of Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) is not considered part of its architectural height, while the spires on top of the Petronas Twin Towers are counted.
Note: The following table is a list of the tallest structure in each of the categories below. There can only be one structure in each category, unless the title for the tallest is a draw.

===Tallest destroyed structures by category, not surpassed by existing structures===

There are some destroyed architectural structures which were taller than the tallest existing structure of their type. There are also destroyed structures omitted from this list that had been surpassed in height prior to being destroyed.

===Tallest building by function===

 Mixed-Use is defined as having three or more real estate uses (such as retail, office, hotel, etc.) that are physically and functionally integrated in a single property and are mutually supporting.Schwanke D. et al. (2003). Mixed-use Development Handbook, 2nd edition. Washington: Urban Land Institute ISBN 978-0-87420-888-7

==Tallest buildings==

Prior to 1998, the tallest building status was determined by the height of the building to the top of its architectural elements including spires, but not including "temporary" structures (such as antennae or flagpoles), which could be added or changed relatively easily without requiring major changes to the building's design. Other criteria for height measurement were not used. For this reason, the originally [tpl]convert|1451|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us[/tpl] to rooftop or 1518 feet with original antennas http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=5/ Willis Tower (formerly Sears Tower) was generally accepted as being the tallest building continuously after its completion in 1973, and being taller than both World Trade Center towers, in spite of the fact the 1 World Trade Center Tower (North Tower) possessed a higher pinnacle absolute height after it added its [tpl]convert|360|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] radio antenna (total height of 1727 feet or 526.3 meters) in 1978. The 1 World Trade Center building maintained a higher absolute height to antenna top until the Sears Tower enlarged its own radio antenna in 2000 to a total height of 1730 feet. However, the Willis Tower was always considered the taller building because it still possessed a greater height to its architectural top (1451 feet vs. 1362 feet), and thus its status as the world's tallest was generally not contested.
Other historic cases in which a building with a taller absolute pinnacle height was not considered the tallest building include, in 1905 when the former New York Times building or The Times Square Building (at 229 West 43rd Street in New York) was completed at [tpl]convert|111|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] to the roof with [tpl]convert|128|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] including a flagpole. That building was never considered to be taller than the [tpl]convert|119|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] high then-current record-holder Park Row Building of New York because a flagpole is not an integral architectural part of a building.http://ctbuh.org/AboutCTBUH/History/MeasuringTall/tabid/1320/language/en-US/Default.aspx
Prior to 1998 the tallest building status had been contested on occasion, but the disputes did not result in a change of the criteria used to determine the world's tallest building. A famous historical case of this discrepancy was the rivalry between The Trump Building (then known as the Bank of Manhattan Building) and the Chrysler Building. The Bank of Manhattan Building employed only a short spire and was [tpl]convert|927|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] tall and had a much higher top occupied floor (the second category in the 1996 criteria for tallest building). In contrast, the Chrysler Building employed a very large [tpl]convert|125|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] spire secretly assembled inside the building to claim the title of world's tallest building with a total height of [tpl]convert|1048|ft|m[/tpl], despite having a lower top occupied floor and a shorter height when both buildings' spires are not counted in their heights. Upset by Chrysler’s victory, Shreve & Lamb, the consulting architects of Bank of Manhattan building, wrote a newspaper article claiming that their building was actually the tallest, since it contained the world's highest usable floor. They pointed out that the observation deck in the Bank of Manhattan Building was nearly [tpl]convert|100|ft|m[/tpl] above the top floor in the Chrysler Building, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and essentially inaccessible.Binders, George (August 2006). 101 of the World's Tallest Buildings. p. 102. However, the Chrysler Building was generally accepted as the tallest building in the world despite their protests.
However, none of the previous discrepancies or disputes in criteria to measure height (spires vs antennae, absolute pinnacle height vs. architectural height, height of highest occupied floor, etc.) resulted in the controversy that occurred upon the completion of the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1998. The Petronas Towers possessed a higher architectural height (spires, but not antennae), but a lower absolute pinnacle height and lower top occupied floor than the previous record-holder Willis Tower in Chicago, United States. Counting buildings as structures with floors throughout, and with antenna masts excluded, Willis Tower was still considered the tallest at that time. When the Petronas Twin Towers were built, controversy arose because their spires extended nine metres higher than the roof of Willis Tower. Excluding their spires, the Petronas Towers are not taller than Willis Tower. At their convention in Chicago, the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) found the Willis Tower to be the third-tallest building, and the Petronas Towers to be the world's tallest buildings. This decision caused a considerable amount of controversy in the news media because this was the first time a country outside the United States had held the world’s tallest building record. Therefore, the CTBUH revised their criteria and defined four categories in which the world's tallest building can be measured,– CTBUH Criteria for Defining and Measuring Tall Buildings by retaining the old criterion of height to architectural top and added three new categories
The height to roof criterion was discontinued because relatively few modern tall buildings possess flat rooftops, making this criterion difficult to determine and measure.http://www.ctbuh.org/NewsMedia/PR_091117_ChangeHeightCriteria/tabid/1273/language/en-US/Default.aspx The CBTUH has further clarified their definitions of building height, including specific criteria concerning subbasements and ground level entrances (height measured from lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance rather than from a previously undefined "main entrance"), building completion (must be topped out both structurally and architecturally, fully clad, and  able to be occupied), condition of the highest occupied floor (must be continuously used by people living or working and be conditioned, thus including observation decks, but not mechanical floors) and other aspects of tall buildings.http://www.ctbuh.org/HighRiseInfo/TallestDatabase/Criteria/tabid/446/Default.aspx.
The height is measured from the level of the lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance. At the time, the Willis Tower held first place in the second and third categories, the Petronas Towers held the first category, and the 1 World Trade Center building held the fourth with its antenna height to top of pinnacle. In 2000, however, a new antenna mast was placed on the Willis Tower, giving it hold of the fourth category. On April 20, 2004, Taipei 101 in Taipei, Taiwan, was completed. Its completion gave it the world record for the first three categories. On July 21, 2007 it was announced that Burj Khalifa had surpassed Taipei 101 in height, reaching [tpl]convert|512|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl].
Since being completed in early 2010, Burj Khalifa leads in all categories (the first building to do so). With a spire height of [tpl]convert|829.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl], Burj Khalifa surpassed Taipei 101 as the tallest building to architectural detail and the Willis Tower as the tallest building to tip. It also leads in the category of highest occupied floor.
Before Burj Khalifa was completed, Willis Tower led in the fourth category with [tpl]convert|527|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], previously held by the World Trade Center until the extension of the Chicago tower's western broadcast antenna in 2000, over a year prior to the World Trade Center's destruction in 2001. Its antenna mast included, One World Trade Center measured [tpl]convert|526|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. The World Trade Center became the world's tallest buildings to be destroyed or demolished; indeed, its site entered the record books twice on September 11, 2001, in that category, replacing the Singer Building, which once stood a block from the World Trade Center site.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] A different superlative for skyscrapers is their number of floors. The World Trade Center set that at 110, and this was not surpassed for nearly four decades until the Burj Khalifa, which opened in 2010.
Structures such as the CN Tower, the Ostankino Tower and the Oriental Pearl Tower are excluded from these categories because they are not "habitable buildings", which are defined as frame structures made with floors and walls throughout.

===History of record holders in each CTBUH category===

==World's tallest freestanding structure on land==

Freestanding structures include observation towers, monuments and other structures not generally considered to be "Habitable buildings", but excludes supported structures such as guyed masts and ocean drilling platforms.
(See also history of tallest skyscrapers.)
The world's tallest freestanding structure on land is defined as the tallest self-supporting man-made structure that stands above ground. This definition is different from that of world's tallest building or world's tallest structure based on the percentage of the structure that is occupied and whether or not it is self-supporting or supported by exterior cables. Likewise, this definition does not count structures that are built underground or on the seabed, such as the Petronius Platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Visit world's tallest structure by category for a list of various other definitions.
As of May 12, 2008, the tallest freestanding structure on land is the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The building, which now stands at [tpl]convert|829.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl], surpassed the height of the previous record holder, the [tpl]convert|553.3|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] CN Tower in Toronto, Ontario, on September 12, 2007. It was completed in 2010, and was topped out at [tpl]convert|829.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in January 2009.

===History===

The following is a list of structures that have held the title as the tallest freestanding structure on land. (See also Timeline of three tallest structures in the world until Empire State Building).
Notable mentions include the Pharos (lighthouse) of Alexandria, built in the third century BC and estimated between [tpl]convert|115|–|135|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. It was the world's tallest non-pyramidal building for many centuries. Another notable mention includes the Jetavanaramaya stupa in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, which was built in the third century, and was similarly tall at [tpl]convert|122|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl]. These were both the world's tallest or second tallest non-pyramidal buildings for over a thousand years.
The tallest secular building between the collapse of the Pharos and the erection of the Washington Monument may have been the Torre del Mangia in Siena, which is [tpl]convert|102|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] tall, and was constructed in the first half of the fourteenth century, and the [tpl]convert|97|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] tall Torre degli Asinelli in Bologna, also Italy, built between 1109 and 1119.

===World's highest observation deck===

Timeline of development of world's highest observation deck since inauguration of Eiffel Tower.
Higher observation decks have existed on mountain tops or cliffs, rather than on tall structures. For example, the Royal Gorge Bridge in Cañon City, Colorado, USA, was constructed in 1929 spanning the Royal Gorge at a height of [tpl]convert|321|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] above the Arkansas River. The Grand Canyon Skywalk, constructed in 2007, protrudes [tpl]convert|70|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip[/tpl] over the west rim of the Grand Canyon and is approximately [tpl]convert|1100|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] above the Colorado River, making it the highest of these types of structures.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]

===Timeline of guyed structures on land===

As most of the tallest structures are guyed masts, here is a timeline of world's tallest guyed masts, since the beginning of radio technology.
As many large guyed masts were destroyed at the end of World War II, the dates for the years between 1945 and 1950 may be incorrect. If Wusung Radio Tower survived World War II, it was the tallest guyed structure shortly after World War II.

==Under construction and on-hold==

Numerous supertall skyscrapers are in various stages of proposal, planning, or construction. Each of the following are under construction and, depending on the order of completion, could become the world's tallest building or structure in at least one category:

==Proposed==

Many proposed structures have not yet been built, and many probably never will be built. See proposed tall buildings and structures for structures that have been or are being proposed.
