Samuel Stewart "Sam" Witwer (born October 20, 1977) is an American actor and musician. He has portrayed Lt. Crashdown in Battlestar Galactica, Davis Bloome in Smallville, and vampire Aidan Waite of the US/Canadian remake of BBC's supernatural drama series Being Human on Syfy in the US and Space in Canada. He also voiced main protagonist Galen Marek/Starkiller in the successful multimedia project Star Wars: The Force Unleashed as well as The Son & Darth Maul for Cartoon Network's Star Wars: The Clone Wars.

==Early life==

Witwer grew up in Glenview, Illinois, a small suburb outside of Chicago. He attended Glenbrook South High School, during which time he was involved in drama and theater classes, as well as being the lead singer of a high school band called "Love Plumber". He attended the Juilliard School for a time before moving to Los Angeles.

==Acting==

Witwer claims that his first on-screen credit was that of a Chicago Bulls commercial. He soon found himself in speaking roles on hit television series, such as ER.
Witwer's first major recurring role came in the form of portraying Lt. Crashdown on Battlestar Galactica, although he has credited much of his current success to his role as Neil Perry on the Showtime series Dexter. Witwer also appeared as Private Wayne Jessup in the movie The Mist.
From 2008 to 2009, Witwer was cast Season 8 of Smallville as Davis Bloome, a charming paramedic who struggles with a darkness within as he is the human camouflage of Doomsday, a character in the comics best known for being the only villain to have killed Superman. While Witwer played Davis, Doomsday was played by stuntman Dario Delacio. Although uncredited, Witwer also played the full-physical form of the show's version of Zod at the end of the Season 8 finale (while the role would later be played in Season 9 by British actor Callum Blue). Witwer's performance in Smallville was incredibly well-received, and he has stated that his experience on the show had opened more opportunities for him in the future of acting.
Witwer made a cameo appearance in The Walking Dead as a dead (zombie) soldier in a tank in the Season 1 episode "Days Gone Bye" which reunited him with director Frank Darabont from The Mist.
Witwer is now currently starring in the North American remake of Being Human. He plays the role of vampire Aidan Waite.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Sam-Witwer-Human-1019989.aspx|title=Sam Witwer Joins U.S. Cast of Being Human|publisher=TVGuide.com[/tpl]

A lifelong Star Wars fan, Witwer provided both his voice and likeness for lead character Galen Marek/Starkiller (Darth Vader's secret apprentice) in the 2008 video game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed and 2010 sequel Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II.
