==History==

===Early career (1974–78)===

Inspired by the burgeoning new music scene at the Mercer Arts Center, Chris Stein sought to join a similar band. He joined The Stilettos in 1973 as their guitarist and formed a romantic relationship with one of the band's vocalists, Deborah Harry, a former waitress and Playboy Bunny. Harry had been a member of a folk-rock band, The Wind in the Willows, in the late 1960s. In 1974, Stein parted ways with The Stilettos and Elda Gentile, the band's originator. Stein and Harry formed a new band with drummer Billy O'Connor and bassist Fred Smith. By 1975, after some personnel turnover (including sisters Tish and Snooky Bellomo on backing vocals), Stein and Harry were joined by drummer Clem Burke, keyboard player Jimmy Destri and bass player Gary Valentine. Originally billed as Angel and the Snake, they renamed themselves Blondie in late 1975. The name derived from comments made by truck drivers who catcalled "Hey, Blondie" to Harry as they drove by.[tpl]cite journal |first= Simon |last= Glickman |editor = Suzanne M.

Blondie became regular performers at Max's Kansas City and CBGB. The band signed with Private Stock Records and their debut album, Blondie, was issued in December 1976 but was initially not a commercial success. In September 1977, the band bought back its contract with Private Stock and then signed with Chrysalis Records."Talent Talk" Billboard October 22, 1977: 54 The first album was re-released on the new label in October 1977. Rolling Stone's review of the debut album observed the eclectic nature of the group's music, comparing it to Phil Spector and the Who, and commented that the album's two strengths were Richard Gottehrer's production and the persona of Deborah Harry, saying she performed with "utter aplomb and involvement throughout: even when she's portraying a character consummately obnoxious and spaced-out, there is a wink of awareness that is comforting and amusing yet never condescending." It also noted that Harry was the "possessor of a bombshell zombie's voice that can sound dreamily seductive and woodenly Mansonite within the same song".[tpl]cite web |first= Ken |last= Tucker |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blondie/albums/album/248822/review/5941424/blondie |title = Blondie album review|work = Rolling Stone | date= 1977-04-07 | accessdate = 2006-07-25 [/tpl]
The band's first commercial success occurred in Australia in 1977, when the music television program Countdown mistakenly played their video "In the Flesh", which was the B-side of their then current single "X-Offender". Jimmy Destri later credited the show's Molly Meldrum for their initial success, commenting that "we still thank him to this day" for playing the wrong song.[tpl]cite web |first= Joe |last= Matera | title = Blondie, for the Big Takeover No. 53| publisher = Blondie official website | date= August 2003 | url =http://archive.blondie.net/jimmy_destri_interview_200308_b.shtml |accessdate = 2006-07-25 [/tpl] In a 1998 interview, drummer Clem Burke recalled seeing the episode in which the wrong song was played, but he and Chris Stein suggested that it may have been a deliberate subterfuge on the part of Meldrum. Stein asserted that "X-Offender" was "too crazy and aggressive become a hit", while "In the Flesh" was "not representative of any punk sensibility. Over the years, I've thought they probably played both things but liked one better. That's all." In retrospect, Burke described "In the Flesh" as "a forerunner to the power ballad".[tpl]cite web |first= Paul |last= Cashmere | title = The Blondie Interview| work = Undercover Media | year= 1998 |accessdate = 2006-07-24 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061231163913/http://www.undercover.com.au/idol/blondie.html|archivedate=December 31, 2006| url =http://www.undercover.com.au/idol/blondie.html  [/tpl]
The single reached number 2 in Australia, while the album reached the Australian top twenty in October 1977, and a subsequent double-A release of "X-Offender" and "Rip Her to Shreds" was also popular. A successful Australian tour followed in December, though it was marred by an incident in Brisbane when disappointed fans almost rioted after Harry cancelled a performance due to illness.[tpl]cite web | url =http://archive.blondie.net/memorabilia.shtml | title = Wild Rock Scenes| publisher = Blondie.net (link to copy of Brisbane Telegraph front page, date 1977-12-09) | accessdate = 2006-07-24 [/tpl]
In February 1978, Blondie released their second album, Plastic Letters (UK No. 10, US No. 78, Australia No. 64). The album was recorded as a four-piece band as Gary Valentine had left the band in mid 1977.[ref]
