Vermont is the 6th least extensive and the 2nd least populous of the 50 United States after Wyoming.  It is the only New England state not bordering the Atlantic Ocean. Lake Champlain forms half of Vermont's western border, which it shares with the state of New York. The Green Mountains are within the state. Vermont is bordered by Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east across the Connecticut River, New York to the west, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north.
Originally inhabited by two major Native American tribes (the Algonquian-speaking Abenaki and the Iroquois), much of the territory that is now Vermont was claimed by France during its early colonial period. France ceded the territory to the Kingdom of Great Britain after being defeated in 1763 in the Seven Years' War (in the United States, referred to as the French and Indian War). For many years, the nearby colonies, especially New Hampshire and New York, disputed control of the area (then called the New Hampshire Grants).
Settlers who held land titles granted by these colonies were opposed by the Green Mountain Boys militia, which eventually prevailed in creating an independent state, the Vermont Republic. Founded in 1777 during the Revolutionary War, the republic lasted for fourteen years. Aside from the Thirteen Colonies, Vermont is one of only four U.S. states (along with Texas, Hawaii, and California) to have been a sovereign state in its past. In 1791, Vermont joined the United States as the 14th state, the first in addition to the original 13 Colonies. Vermont was the first state to partially abolish slavery[tpl]cite web|title=Vermont Constitution of 1777|url=http://vermont-archives.org/govhistory/constitut/con77.htm|publisher=State of Vermont|accessdate=12 February 2014|location=Chapter I, Section I|quote=Therefore, no male person, born in this country, or brought from over sea, ought to be holden by law, to serve any person, as a servant, slave, or apprentice, after he arrives to the age of twenty-one years; nor female, in like manner, after she arrives to the age of eighteen years, unless they are bound by their own consent, after they arrive to such age, or bound by law for the payment of debts, damages, fines, costs, or the like.[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Lee Ann|first=Cox|title=UVM historian examines Vermont’s mixed history of slavery and abolition|url=http://www.uvm.edu/research/?Page=news&storyID=17688&category=uvmresearch|publisher=University of Vermont|accessdate=12 February 2014[/tpl] while still independent.

==Geography==

Vermont is located in the New England region in the eastern United States and comprises [tpl]convert|9614|sqmi|km2[/tpl], making it the 45th-largest state. It is the only state that does not have any buildings taller than [tpl]convert|124|ft|m[/tpl]."Burlington high rise gets facelift", Burlington Free Press Land comprises [tpl]convert|9250|sqmi|km2[/tpl] and water comprises [tpl]convert|365|sqmi|km2[/tpl], making it the 43rd-largest in land area and the 47th in water area. In total area, it is larger than El Salvador and smaller than Haiti.

Lake Champlain, the major lake in Vermont, is the sixth-largest body of fresh water in the United States and separates Vermont from New York in the northwest portion of the state. From north to south, Vermont is [tpl]convert|159|mi|km[/tpl] long. Its greatest width, from east to west, is [tpl]convert|89|mi|km[/tpl] at the Canadian border; the narrowest width is [tpl]convert|37|mi|km[/tpl] at the Massachusetts line. The width averages [tpl]convert|60.5|mi[/tpl]. The state's geographic center is approximately three miles (5 km) east of Roxbury, in Washington County. There are fifteen US federal border crossings between Vermont and Canada.
The origin of the name "Vermont" is uncertain, but likely comes from the French les Verts Monts, meaning "the Green Mountains".[tpl]cite book |author=Van DeWater, Frederic F. |title=The Reluctant Republic, Vermont 1724–1791. |year=1941, 1974 |publisher=The Countryman Press |pages=195, 218–219 |isbn=0-914378-02-3[/tpl] Thomas Young introduced it in 1777.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vt-fcgs.org/vermont_by_andre.html|title=The Name Vermont|first =Joseph-Andre |last=Senecal[/tpl] Some authorities[tpl]specify|date=November 2012[/tpl] say that the mountains were called green because they were more forested than the higher White Mountains of New Hampshire and Adirondacks of New York; others say that the predominance of mica-quartz-chlorite schist, a green-hued metamorphosed shale, is the reason. The Green Mountain range forms a north–south spine running most of the length of the state, slightly west of its center. In the southwest portion of the state are the Taconic Mountains; the Granitic Mountains are in the northeast.[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8NWPJkRK-VMC&pg=RA1-PA274-IA1&lpg=RA1-PA274-IA1&dq=%22granitic+mountains%22+vermont#PRA1-PA272,M1 |title=Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=August 28, 2006 |accessdate=July 31, 2010[/tpl] In the northwest, near Lake Champlain, is the fertile Champlain Valley. In the south of the valley is Lake Bomoseen.
Several mountains have timberlines with delicate year-round alpine ecosystems, including Mount Mansfield, the highest mountain in the state; Killington Peak, the second-highest; Camel's Hump, the state's third-highest; and Mount Abraham, the fifth-highest peak. About 77% of the state is covered by forest;[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] the rest is covered in meadow, uplands, lakes, ponds, and marshes.

===Geology===

There are five distinct physiographic regions of Vermont. Categorized by geological and physical attributes, they are the Northeastern Highlands, the Green Mountains, the Taconic Mountains, the Champlain Lowlands, and the Vermont Piedmont.[tpl]cite web|title=Academics Content Server at Saint Michael's |work=The Physiographic Regions of Vermont|url=http://academics.smcvt.edu/vtgeographic/textbook/physiographic/physiographic_regions_of_vermont.htm|accessdate=January 3, 2007[/tpl]
About 500 million years ago, Vermont was part of Laurentia and located in the tropics.[tpl]Cite news | first=Joel Banner | last=Baird | title=Tremors of discovery | url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/article/20110724/GREEN01/107240301/Tremors-Discovery-Lone-Rock-Point-bears-scars-ancient-earthly-disruptions| work= | newspaper=Burlington Free Press | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages= 1–3D | date=July 24, 2011 | id= | accessdate=[/tpl]
The central and southern Green Mountain range include the oldest rocks in Vermont, formed about one billion years ago during the first mountain building period (or orogeny). Subsequently, about [tpl]Nowrap|400 million[/tpl] years ago, the second mountain building period created Green Mountain peaks that were [tpl]convert|15000|-|20000|ft[/tpl] tall, three to four times their current height and comparable to the Himalayas. The geological pressures that created those peaks remain evident as the Champlain Thrust, running north–south to the west of the mountains (now the eastern shore of Lake Champlain). It is an example of geological fault thrusting where bedrock is pushed over the newer rock formation.
As a result of tectonic formation, Vermont east of the Green Mountains tends to be formed from rocks produced in the Silurian and Devonian periods. Western Vermont mainly from the older Pre-Cambrian and Cambrian material.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.anr.state.vt.us/dec/geo/images/gengeo52.pdf |title=Generalized geologic map of Vermont |format=PDF |accessdate=February 23, 2012[/tpl]
