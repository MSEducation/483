Windex is a glass and hard-surface cleaner manufactured since 1933. S. C. Johnson acquired Windex in 1993 and has been manufacturing it since. The product was reformulated in 2006.[tpl]cite press release |author=S.C.

The original Windex was colored a light, transparent shade of blue,[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] but varieties are marketed today in a variety of colors (ocean fresh blue, sunshine lemon and citrus orange) and fragrances (spring bouquet, ocean mist, lavender and tea tree), and with a variety of additives such as vinegar, lemon, lime, or orange juice.
When Windex was invented in 1933 by Harry R. Drackett, it was almost 100% solvent. It was highly flammable and had to be sold in metal cans.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] When modern surfactants were introduced after World War II, the product was reformulated.
Windex was a 5% ammonia solution in 1989.[tpl]cite news|last=Lewis|first=Peter H.|title=PERSONAL COMPUTERS; Cleaning Screens Safely|work=The New York Times|page=9|date=August 8, 1989|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/08/science/personal-computers-cleaning-screens-safely.html[/tpl]
The Sam Wise patent[tpl]clarify|reason=Who is Sam Wise and why is it relevant?|date=July 2013[/tpl] #3,463,735 lists example formulae, one of which is 4.0% isopropyl alcohol (a highly volatile solvent) 1% ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (a less volatile solvent), 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate (a surfactant), 0.01% tetrasodium pyrophosphate (a water softener), 0.05% of 28% ammonia, 1% of a dye solution, and 0.01% perfume. This formula was not only less expensive to manufacture, but allowed the product to be packaged in glass bottles and dispensed with a plastic sprayer.
The popularity of Windex in the U.S. led to the generic use of the trademark for similar product, including those marketed under different brands Window Cleaner.
The blueish-green color inspired bartenders to make similarly tinted mixed drinks.  For example, a "Windex shot" typically contains vodka, triple sec, and Blue Cura√ßao for color.

==Popular culture==

Windex is alluded to numerous times by Gus in the romantic comedy My Big Fat Greek Wedding as a "cure" for a host of ills from rashes to acne.
It is also mentioned in The Lost Boys (1987) when Grandpa asks Sam what could pass off as aftershave.
