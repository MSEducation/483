In June 1972, when Sholayis (Maoists) and Ikhwanis (Islamic fundamentalists) clashed on the campus of Kabul University, Saydal Sokhandan was killed by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, [ref] leader of the Islamic Party of Afghanistan, during this clash in June 1972.
Saydal Sokhandan has many poems in the Pashto language.  One of his poems is:
په ټوپک او په برچه دی استعمار  پاره پاره کړه
شابه شابه ای کارګره خپل ایمان غیرت ښکاره کړه
Translation:
Tear apart colonialism with your gun and knife
Bravo Bravo Workers show your faith and determination
