Kennedy High School.[tpl]cite web | title=John Stamos Bio ~ Information ~ Facts | website=pop-culture.net | accessdate=December 24, 2013 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131023060743/http://www.pop-culture.net/J/John-Stamos.html | archivedate=March 11, 2011 | url=http://www.pop-culture.net/j/John-Stamos.html[/tpl] He is the oldest child and only son of Loretta ([tpl]née[/tpl] Phillips), a former swimsuit model who was raised in England and is of Irish and English ancestry,[tpl]cite web | url=http://ethnicelebs.com/john-stamos | title=John Stamos — EthniCelebs - Celebrity Ethnicity |What Nationality Background Ancestry Race | website=ethnicelebs.com | accessdate=December 24, 2013[/tpl] and Bill Stamos, a restaurateur of Greek descent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/8/John-Stamos.html |title=John Stamos Biography (1963–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=February 25, 2011[/tpl] Stamos has two younger sisters, Jannen and Alaina, who are both teachers. His family's last name was originally Stamatopoulos ([tpl]lang-el|Σταματόπουλος[/tpl]) but his paternal grandparents shortened the name to Stamos when they moved to the United States from Greece. ('-poulos' -πουλος is a common Greek suffix in surnames, meaning "son of"; 'Stamat-' is the root, which is derived from the name Stamat-ios Σταμάτ-ιος --> Stamat-is Σταμάτ-ης, with the -o- in between being an addition for easier pronunciation).

==Early career==

Stamos began his acting career with the role of Blackie Parrish on the soap opera General Hospital in late January 1982, for which he was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in 1984. His stint on the show got him noticed by daytime viewers. Stamos decided to move on in April 1984, when he auditioned for and got the lead role in a short-lived CBS sitcom called Dreams, in which he played an aspiring musician in a band of the same name.
Later, he played a role in the sitcom You Again? (1986) with Jack Klugman.

==Full House==

In the late 1980s, ABC's Full House gradually became a hit, and the show solidified Stamos's career. In the first season, his character's full name was credited as Jesse Cochran. During the second season he then changed his character's last name to Katsopolis to highlight his Greek heritage, according to Jeff Franklin. He played one of the show's protagonists, Jesse, who lives with his brother in-law, whose deceased wife was Jesse's older sister. Danny's best friend, Joey, also lives in the house with them. The three help each other raise three young girls. Jesse is known to be the "bad boy" at first, until he falls in love with and marries Rebecca Donaldson and has twin boys, Nicky and Alex. In 1995, after eight seasons, the series came to an end. Stamos has since maintained close relationships with co-stars Bob Saget, Dave Coulier, Lori Loughlin, Jodie Sweetin, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, and Candace Cameron Bure. As of 2014, the show airs in syndication on TBS and Nick at Nite.

==Post-Full House==
