CATEGORIES: Trees in mythology, Fictional trees

Talking trees are a form of sapient trees in mythologies and stories, most famously known as the Ents in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth stories.
According to Greek mythology, all the trees in the Dodona (northwestern Greece, Epirus) grove (the forest beside the sanctuary of Zeus) became endowed with the gift of prophecy, and the oaks not only spoke and delivered oracles while in a living state, when built into the ship Argo the wood spoke and warned of approaching calamities.Cultus Arborum 1890
The rustling of the leaves on an Oak tree was regarded as the voice of Zeus."Plants of Life, Plants of Death" Frederick J. Simoons 1998
