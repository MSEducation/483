The Wandering Jew is a figure whose legend began to spread in Europe in the 13th century.as described in the first chapter of Curious Myths of the Middle Ages where Sabine Baring-Gould attributed the earliest extant mention of the myth of the Wandering Jew to Matthew Paris. The chapter began with a reference to Gustave Doré's series of twelve illustrations to the legend, and ended with a sentence remarking that, while the original legend was so 'noble in its severe simplicity' that few could develop it with success in poetry or otherwise, Doré had produced in this series 'at once a poem, a romance, and a chef-d'oeuvre of art'. First published in two parts in 1866 and 1868, the work was republished in 1877 and in many other editions.http://archive.org/stream/curiousmythsofmi00bariuoft/curiousmythsofmi00bariuoft_djvu.txt
The original legend concerns a Jew who taunted Jesus on the way to the Crucifixion and was then cursed to walk the earth until the Second Coming. The exact nature of the wanderer's indiscretion varies in different versions of the tale, as do aspects of his character; sometimes he is said to be a shoemaker or other tradesman, while sometimes he is the doorman at Pontius Pilate's estate.

==Name==

The legend appears in the earliest extant manuscript under the title Of the Jew Joseph who is still alive awaiting the last coming of Christ.part, for the year 1228, of a chronicle in Latin written in 13th century England, Flores Historiarum by Roger of Wendoverhttp://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eQNIAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA513&lpg=PA513&dq=Flowers+of+History+1228+armenia&source=bl&ots=Qb3TUNuGw6&sig=Jpt9gWN_WTG_KKRICyV1mdmfJrQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=n6h2UJuuIuyp0AXl0YB4&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Flowers%20of%20History%201228%20armenia&f=false (Latin, De Joseph, qui ultimum Christi adventum adhuc vivus exspectat) p.175 http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G-4sAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=Flowers+of+History+1228&source=bl&ots=t1xzNX5eib&sig=LQNgGbbK0mFjoiDaJozS9zz82LE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=V6h2UJ_4DaK90QWf14E4&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Flowers%20of%20History%201228&f=false and Encyc. Brit. 11th edition http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/The_Wandering_Jew
At least from the 17th century the name Ahasver has been given to the Wandering Jew, apparently adapted from Ahasuerus, the Persian king in the Book of Esther, who was not a Jew, and whose very name among medieval Jews was an exemplum of a fool.David Daube, "Ahasver" The Jewish Quarterly Review New Series 45.3 (January 1955), pp 243-244.
A variety of names have since been given to the Wandering Jew, including Matathias, Buttadeus, Paul Marrane,[tpl]cite book|title=The Turkish Spy|year=1644|volume=Book 3, Letter I[/tpl] and Isaac Laquedem (a name for him in France and the Low Countries, in popular legend as well as in a novel by Dumas).
Where the German language is spoken the emphasis has been on the perpetual character of his punishment and he is known as "Ewige Jude", the Eternal Jew. In French and other Romance languages, the usage has been to refer to the wanderings, as in French "le Juif errant", and this has been followed in English from the Middle Ages.[ref]Encyc. Brit. 11th edition.http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/The_Wandering_Jew
The title for the article in the print edition was "Jew, the Wandering". It was signed "J.Ja." for "Joseph Jacobs, Litt.D., Professor of English Literature in the Jewish Theological Seminary, New York., formerly President of the Jewish Historical Society of England, author of Jews of Angevin England, ''Studies in Biblical Archaeology etc."[/ref]

==Origin and evolution==

===Biblical sources===

The origins of the legend are uncertain; perhaps one element is the story in  Genesis of Cain, who is issued with a similar punishment — to wander over the earth, never reaping a harvest again, but scavenging.   According to Jehoshua Gilboa, many commentators have pointed to Hosea 9:17 as a statement of the notion of the "eternal/wandering Jew".[tpl]cite book|last1=Sweeney|first1=Marvin Alan|last2=Cotter|first2=David W. |last3=Walsh|first3=Jerome T.|coauthors=Franke, Chris|title=The Twelve Prophets: Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4vOwFysWpogC&pg=PA102|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=October 2000|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5095-0|page=102[/tpl]
According to some sources, the legend stems from Jesus' words given in Matthew 16:28:
A belief that the disciple whom Jesus loved would not die before the Second Coming was apparently popular enough in the early Christian world to be denounced in the Gospel of John:
Another passage in the Gospel of John speaks about a guard of the high priest who slaps Jesus (John 18:19-23, KJV). Earlier, the Gospel of John talks about Simon Peter striking the ear from a servant of the high priest, named Malchus (John 18:10, KJV). Although this servant is probably not the same guard who struck Jesus, Malchus is nonetheless one of the many names given to the wandering Jew in later legend.[tpl]cite book|title=Italian Popular Tales|author=Thomas Frederick Crane|publisher=Macmillan|year=1885|location=page 197|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8kFdaz7OVT8C&pg=PA197#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=2011-12-21[/tpl]

===Early Christianity===

Extant manuscripts have shown that as early as the time of Tertullian some Christian proponents were likening the Jewish people to a "new Cain", asserting that they would be "fugitives and wanderers (upon) the earth".Salo Wittmayer Baron, Social and Religious History of the Jews, 18 vols., 2d ed., Columbia University Press, 1952–1983. Volume titles http://www.amazon.com/Social-Religious-History-Wittmayer-Baron/dp/0231088566#reader_0231088566
Aurelius Prudentius Clemens (b. 348) writes in his Apotheosis (c. 400): "From place to place the homeless Jew wanders in ever-shifting exile, since the time when he was torn from the abode of his fathers and has been suffering the penalty for murder, and having stained his hands with the blood of Christ whom he denied, paying the price of sin.[tpl]cite book|author=Aurelius Prudentius Clemens|title=Apotheosis|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/prudentiuswithen01pruduoft/prudentiuswithen01pruduoft_djvu.txt|accessdate=2011-12-22|year=400[/tpl]

===Medieval legend===

Some scholars have identified components of the legend of the Eternal Jew in Teutonic legends of the Eternal Hunter, some features of which are derived from Wotan mythology.[tpl]cite book|title=A social and religious history of the Jews: Citizen or alien conjurer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eXVDceafeiEC&pg=PA178|accessdate=13 December 2011|volume=11|year=1967|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-08847-3|page=178[/tpl]
"In some areas the farmers arranged the rows in their fields in such a way that on Sundays the Eternal Jew might find a resting place. Elsewhere they assumed that he could rest only upon a plough or that he had to be on the go all year and was allowed a respite only on Christmas."
A variant of the Wandering Jew legend is recorded in the Flores Historiarum by Roger of Wendover around the year 1228.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=910n83JaIREC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Flowers+of+History#PPA512,M1 |title=Roger of Wendover's Flowers of ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2010-10-11[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dv8KAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA149&cad=0_0#PPA193,M1 |title=Flores historiarum - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2007-08-07 |accessdate=2010-10-11[/tpl]For 13c.expulsion of Jews see History of the Jews in England and Edict of Expulsion. An Armenian archbishop, then visiting England, was asked by the monks of St Albans Abbey about the celebrated Joseph of Arimathea, who had spoken to Jesus, and was reported to be still alive. The archbishop answered that he had himself seen such a man in Armenia, and that his name was Cartaphilus, a Jewish shoemaker, who, when Jesus stopped for a second to rest while carrying his cross, hit him, and told him "Go on quicker, Jesus! Go on quicker! Why dost Thou loiter?", to which Jesus, "with a stern countenance", is said to have replied: "I shall stand and rest, but thou shalt go on till the last day." The Armenian bishop also reported that Cartaphilus had since converted to Christianity and spent his wandering days proselytizing and leading a hermit's life.
Matthew Paris included this passage from Roger of Wendover in his own history; and other Armenians appeared in 1252 at the Abbey of St Albans, repeating the same story, which was regarded there as a great proof of the truth of the Christian religion.Matthew Paris, Chron. Majora, ed. H. R. Luard, London, 1880, v. 340-341 The same Armenian told the story at Tournai in 1243, according to the Chronicles of Phillip Mouskes, (chapter ii. 491, Brussels, 1839). After that, Guido Bonatti writes people saw the Wandering Jew in Forlì (Italy), in the 13th century; other people saw him in Vienna and elsewhere.Anderson (1991), 22-23
The figure of the doomed sinner, forced to wander without the hope of rest in death till the second coming of Christ, impressed itself upon the popular medieval imagination, mainly with reference to the seeming immortality of the wandering Jewish people. These two aspects of the legend are represented in the different names given to the central figure. In German-speaking countries he is referred to as "Der Ewige Jude" (the immortal, or eternal, Jew), while in Romance-speaking countries he is known as "Le Juif Errant" (the Wandering Jew) and "L'Ebreo Errante"; the English form, probably because it is derived from the French, has followed the Romance. As well as "El Judío Errante" (The Wandering Jew), he is known in Spanish as "Juan que Espera a Dios", (John who waits for God).For Jews in Germany in and after middle ages see History of the Jews in Germany.For 14c. expulsion of Jews and 16c. return see History of the Jews in France.For Jews in Spain in and after middle ages see History of the Jews in Spain.
There were claims of sightings of the Wandering Jew throughout Europe, since at least 1542 in Hamburg up to 1868 in Harts Corners, New York."Editorial Summary", Deseret News, 23 September 1868. Joseph Jacobs, writing in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, commented  'It is difficult to tell in any one of these cases how far the story is an entire fiction and how far some ingenious impostor took advantage of the existence of the myth'.[tpl]1911|title=Jew, The Wandering|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/The_Wandering_Jew|first=Joseph|last=Jacobs|volume=15|page=362a|inline=1[/tpl] It has been alleged by an 1881 writer, who however cites no instances, that the supposed presence of the Wandering Jew has occasionally been used as a pretext for incursions by Gentiles into  Jewish quarters during the late Middle Ages, when the legend was accepted as fact.[tpl]cite book|last=Conway|first=Moncure Daniel|title=The Wandering Jew|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IkMKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA28|accessdate=2 December 2010|year=1881|publisher=Chatto and Windus|page=28|quote=The animus of the revival of the legend is shown by instances in which the Jews' quarters were invaded under rumours that they were concealing the Wanderer.[/tpl]

==In literature==

===17th and 18th centuries===

The legend became more popular after it appeared in a 17th-century pamphlet of four leaves, "Kurtze [tpl]sic[/tpl] Beschreibung und Erzählung von einem Juden mit Namen Ahasverus" ("Short description and tale of a Jew with the name Ahasuerus").This professes to have been printed at Leiden in 1602 by an otherwise unrecorded printer "Christoff Crutzer"; the real place and printer can not be ascertained. "Here we are told that some fifty years before, a bishop met him in a church at Hamburg, repentant, ill-clothed and distracted at the thought of having to move on in a few weeks".Daube 1955:244. As with urban legends, particularities lend verisimilitude: the bishop is specifically Paulus von Eitzen, General Superintendent of Schleswig. The legend spread quickly throughout Germany, no less than eight different editions appearing in 1602; altogether forty appeared in Germany before the end of the 18th century. Eight editions in Dutch and Flemish are known; and the story soon passed to France, the first French edition appearing in Bordeaux, 1609, and to England, where it appeared in the form of a parody in 1625.Jacobs and Wolf, Bibliotheca Anglo-Judaica, p. 44, No. 221. The pamphlet was translated also into Danish and Swedish; and the expression "eternal Jew" is current in Czech, Slovak, and German, der Ewige Jude. Apparently the pamphlets of 1602 borrowed parts of the descriptions of the wanderer from reports (most notably by Balthasar Russow) about an itinerant preacher called Jürgen.Beyer, Jürgen, 'Jürgen und der Ewige Jude. Ein lebender Heiliger wird unsterblich', Arv. Nordic Yearbook of Folklore 64 (2008), 125-40
In France, the Wandering Jew appeared in Simon Tyssot de Patot's La Vie, les Aventures et le Voyage de Groenland du Révérend Père Cordelier Pierre de Mésange (1720).
In England the Wandering Jew makes an appearance in one of the secondary plots in Matthew Lewis's Gothic novel The Monk (1796). The Wandering Jew is depicted as an exorcist whose origin remains unclear. The Wandering Jew also plays a role in St. Leon (1799) by William Godwin.[ref]Wallace Austin Flanders,

====England====

In England a ballad with the title The Wandering Jew was included in Thomas Percy's Reliques published in 1765.Third edition: Reliques of ancient English poetry: consisting of old heroic ballads, songs, and other pieces of our earlier poets, (chiefly of the lyric kind.) Together with some few of later date (Volume 3) - p.295-301, 128 lines of verse, with prose introduction http://archive.org/stream/reliquesancient00dodsgoog#page/n309/mode/2up

In 1810 Shelley had written a poem in four cantos with the title The Wandering Jew but it remained unpublished until 1877.The Wandering Jew, A Poem in Four Cantos by Percy Bysshe Shelley. Written in 1810, published posthumously for the Shelley Society by Reeves and Turner, London 1877. In two other works of Shelley, Ahasuerus appears, as a phantom in his first major poem Queen Mab: A Philosophical Poem (1813) and later as a hermit healer in his last major work, the verse drama Hellas.The Impiety of Ahasuerus: Percy Shelley's Wandering Jew Tamara Tinker, revised edition 2010
Thomas Carlyle, in his Sartor Resartus (1834), compares its hero Diogenes Teufelsdroeckh on several occasions to the Wandering Jew, (also using the German wording 'der ewige Jude').
George MacDonald includes pieces of the legend in Thomas Wingfold, Curate (London, 1876).

=====North America=====

Nathaniel Hawthorne's stories "A Virtuoso's Collection" and "Ethan Brand" feature the Wandering Jew serving as a guide to the stories' characters.Brian Stableford, "Introduction" to Tales of the Wandering Jew edited by Stableford.Dedalus, Sawtry, 1991. ISBN 0-946626-71-5 . (pp.1-25).
In 1873 a publisher in North America (Philadelphia, Gebbie) produced 'The Legend of the Wandering Jew, a series of twelve designs by Gustave Doré (Reproduced by Photographic Printing) with Explanatory Introduction. For each illustration there was a couplet, such as "Too late he feels, by look, and deed, and word, / How often he has crucified his Lord".[ref]Gebbie's edition 1873

In 1901 a New York publisher reprinted, under the title "Tarry Thou Till I Come", George Croly's "Salathiel", which treated the subject in an imaginative form. It had appeared anonymously in 1828.
In Lew Wallace's novel The Prince of India, the Wandering Jew is the protagonist.  The book follows his adventures through the ages, as he takes part in the shaping of history.William Russo's 1999 novella Mal Tempo details Wallace's research and real-life attempt to find the mythical character for his novel. Russo also wrote a sequel, entitled Mal Tempo & Friends in 2001. An American rabbi, H.M. Bien, turned the character into the "Wandering Gentile" in his novel Ben-Beor: A Tale of the Anti-Messiah; in the same year John L. McKeever wrote a novel, The Wandering Jew: A Tale of the Lost Tribes of Israel.

====Germany====

The legend has been the subject of German poems by Schubart, Aloys Schreiber, Wilhelm Müller, Lenau, Chamisso, Schlegel, Julius Mosen (an epic, 1838), and Köhler; of novels by Franz Horn (1818), Oeklers, and Schücking; and of tragedies by Klingemann ("Ahasuerus", 1827) and Zedlitz (1844). It is either the Ahasuerus of Klingemann or that of Ludwig Achim von Arnim in his play, Halle and Jerusalem to whom Richard Wagner refers in the final passage of his notorious essay Das Judentum in der Musik.
There are clear echoes of the Wandering Jew in Wagner's The Flying Dutchman, whose plot line is adapted from a story by Heinrich Heine in which the Dutchman is referred to as 'the Wandering Jew of the ocean',Heinrich Heine, Aus den Memoiren des Herren von Schnabelewopski, 1834. See Barry Millington, The Wagner Compendium, London (1992), p. 277 and his final opera Parsifal features a woman called Kundry who is in some ways a female version of the Wandering Jew. It is alleged that she was formerly Herodias, and she admits that she laughed at Jesus on his route to the Crucifixion, and is now condemned to wander until she meets with him again (cf. Eugene Sue's version, below).
Robert Hamerling, in his "Ahasver in Rom" (Vienna, 1866), identifies Nero with the Wandering Jew. Goethe had designed a poem on the subject, the plot of which he sketched in his Dichtung und Wahrheit.Fifteenth Book of The autobiography of Goethe: truth and poetry, from my own life translated from the German by John Oxenford (1848).Full text of "The autobiography of Goethe : truth and poetry, from my own life"P.

====Denmark====

Hans Christian Andersen made his "Ahasuerus" the Angel of Doubt, and was imitated by Heller in a poem on "The Wandering of Ahasuerus", which he afterward developed into three cantos. Martin Andersen Nexø wrote a short story named "The Eternal Jew", in which he also refers to Ahasuerus as the spreading of the Jewish gene pool in Europe.
The story of the Wandering Jew is the basis of the essay, "The Unhappiest One" in Søren Kierkegaard's Either/Or (published 1843 in Copenhagen). It is also discussed in an early portion of the book that focuses on Mozart's opera Don Giovanni.
In the play "Genboerne" (The neighbors across the street), the Wandering Jew is a character (in this context called "Jerusalem's shoemaker" and his shoes will make you invisible when you wear them. The protagonist of the play borrows the shoes for a night and visits the house across the street as an invisible man.

====France====

[tpl]Wikisourcelang|fr|Isaac Laquedem|Isaac Laquedem[/tpl]The French writer Edgar Quinet published his prose epic on the legend in 1833, making the subject the judgment of the world; and Eugène Sue wrote his Juif errant in 1844, in which the author connects the story of Ahasuerus with that of Herodias. Grenier's 1857 poem on the subject may have been inspired by Gustave Doré's designs, which were published the preceding year. One should also note Paul Féval, père's La Fille du Juif Errant (1864), which combines several fictional Wandering Jews, both heroic and evil, and Alexandre Dumas' incomplete Isaac Laquedem (1853), a sprawling historical saga.

====Russia====

In Russia, the legend of the Wandering Jew appears in an incomplete epic poem by Vasily Zhukovsky, "Ahasuerus" (1857) and in another epic poem by Wilhelm Küchelbecker, "Ahasuerus, a Poem in Fragments", written from 1832–1846 but not published until 1878, long after the poet's death. Alexander Pushkin also began a long poem on Ahasuerus (1826) but abandoned the project quickly, completing under thirty lines.

====Other literature====

The Wandering Jew makes a notable appearance in the gothic masterpiece of the Polish writer Jan Potocki, The Manuscript Found in Saragossa, written about 1797.
Brazilian writer and poet Machado de Assis often used Jewish themes in his writings. One of his short stories, Viver! ("To Live!"), is a dialog between the Wandering Jew (named as Ahasuerus) and Prometheus at the end of time. It was published in 1896 as part of the book Várias histórias ("Several stories").
Castro Alves, another Brazilian poet, wrote a poem named "Ahasverus e o gênio" ("Ahasverus and the genie"), in a reference to the Wandering Jew.
The Hungarian poet János Arany also wrote a ballad called "Az örök zsidó", meaning "The everlasting Jew".

===20th century===

====Latin America====

In Argentina, the topic of the Wandering Jew has appeared several times in the work of Enrique Anderson Imbert, particularly in his short-story El Grimorio (The Grimoire), included in the eponymous book.  Chapter XXXVII, El Vagamundo, in the collection of short stories, Misteriosa Buenos Aires, by the Argentine writer Manuel Mujica Láinez also centres round the wandering of the Jew. The great Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges named the main character and narrator of his short story "The Immortal" Joseph Cartaphilus (in the story he was a Roman military tribune who gained immortality after drinking from a magical river and dies in the 1920s). In Green Mansions, W.H. Hudson's protagonist Abel, references Ahasuerus, as an archetype of someone, like himself, who prays for redemption and peace; while condemned to walk the earth. In 1967, the Wandering Jew appears as an unexplained magical realist townfolk legend in Gabriel García Márquez's 100 Years of Solitude.

The German writer Stefan Heym in his novel Ahasver (translated into English as The Wandering Jew)Northwestern University Press (1983) ISBN 978-0-8101-1706-8 maps a story of Ahasver and Lucifer against both ancient times and socialist East Germany. In Heym's depiction, the Wandering Jew is a highly sympathetic character.

====Dutch====

The Belgian writer August Vermeylen published in 1906 a novel called De wandelende Jood ("The Wandering Jew").

====Romanian====

Mihai Eminescu, an influential Romanian writer, depicts in his romantic fantastic novella Sarmanul Dionis a variation. A student follows a surreal journey trough the book of Zoroaster, a book seeming to give him God-like abilities. The book is given to him by Ruben, his Jewish master which is a philosopher. Dan is eventually tricked by Ruben, and is sentenced by God to a life of insanity, which he can escape only by resurrection.
Similarly, Mircea Eliade presents in his novel Dayan (1979) a student's mystic and fantastic journey through time and space under the guidance of the Wandering Jew, in the search of a higher truth and of his own self.

====Russian====

The Soviet satirists Ilya Ilf and Yevgeni Petrov had their hero Ostap Bender tell the story of the Wandering Jew's death at the hands of Ukrainian nationalists in The Little Golden Calf. In Vsevolod Ivanov's story Ahasver a weird man comes to a Soviet writer in Moscow in 1944, introduces himself as "Ahasver the cosmopolite" and claims he is Paul von Eitzen, a theologian from Hamburg,  who concocted the legend of Wandering Jew in the 16th century to become rich and famous but then turned himself into a real Ahasver against his will. The novel Overburdened with Evil (1988) by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky involves a character in modern setting who turns out to be Ahasuerus, identified at the same time in a subplot with John the Divine.

====Swedish====

In Pär Lagerkvist's 1956 novel The Sibyl, Ahasuerus and a woman who was once the Delphic Sibyl each tell their stories, describing how an interaction with the divine damaged their lives. Lagerkvist continued the story of Ahasuerus in Ahasverus död ("The Death of Ahasuerus", 1960).
