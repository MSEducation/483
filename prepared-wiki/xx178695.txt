Dr. Nathaniel Thomas Wetherell MRCS FGS (September 6, 1800 - December 22, 1875) was a British geologist and surgeon. His work involved the collection of various fossils found in England.  He was born, lived, and died in Highgate, England.[tpl]cite DNB|wstitle=Wetherell, Nathaniel Thomas|volume=60[/tpl]
Wetherell discovered a strange mixture of rocks and fossils of northern provenance in Coldfall Wood, Muswell Hill in 1835. This led subsequently to the recognition that glaciation had affected southern England.Walker, H. (1874),The Glacial Drifts of Muswell Hill & Finchley, reprinted 1993, London: Jack Whitehead
