</ref> In unwounded tissue, these fibers are not overexpressed with thick collagen and do not contract.
The fibroblast involved in scarring and contraction is the myofibroblast, which is a specialized contractile fibroblast. These cells express a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA).[ref]
</ref>
The myofibroblasts are absent in the first trimester in the embryonic stage; damage then heals scar free;  small incisional or excision wounds less than 2 mm also heal without scarring;[ref]
</ref> and in adult unwounded tissues where the fibroblast in itself is arrested; however, the myofibroblast is found in massive numbers in adult wound healing which heals with a scar.<ref name=myo2011033/>
The myofibroblasts make up a high proportion of the fibroblasts proliferating in the postembryonic wound at the onset of healing. In the rat model, for instance, myofibroblasts can constitute up to 70% of the fibroblasts, and is responsible for fibrosis on tissue.[ref]
</ref>
Generally, the myofibroblasts disappear from the wound within 30 days, but can stay around in pathological cases in hypertrophy, such as keloids.
Prolonged inflammation, as well as the fibroblast proliferation can occur. Redness that often follows an injury to the skin is not a scar, and is generally not permanent (see wound healing). The time it takes for this redness to dissipate may, however, range from a few days to, in some serious and rare cases, a few years. [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
Scars form differently based on the location of the injury on the body and the age of the person who was injured. [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
The worse the initial damage is, the worse the scar will generally be. [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]
Skin scars occur when the dermis (the deep, thick layer of skin) is damaged. Most skin scars are flat and leave a trace of the original injury that caused them. [tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2010[/tpl]

==Treatments==

Early and effective treatment of acne scarring can prevent severe acne and the scarring that often follows.[tpl]cite web | title= What is a Scar |  url= http://www.aad.org/public/publications/pamphlets/cosmetic_scar.html | publisher = American Academy of Dermatology | quote = Early and effective acne treatment can prevent severe acne and the scarring that often follows | year = 2011 | accessdate=2011-08-25[/tpl] High melanin levels and either African or Asian ancestry may make adverse scarring more noticeable.[tpl]Cite pmid|19608056[/tpl] [tpl]Asof|2014[/tpl] no prescription drugs for the treatment or prevention of scars were available.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ferguson MW, O'Kane S |title=Scar-free healing: from embryonic mechanisms to adult therapeutic intervention |journal=Philos.

===Collagen induction therapy===

Collagen induction therapy (CIT) is an aesthetic medical procedure that involves repeatedly puncturing the skin with tiny, sterile needles. Typically, this is done with a specialized device called a microneedling device. CIT is often referred to as "microneedling" or "skin needling" in media and literature.

===Chemical peels===

Chemical peels are chemicals which destroy the epidermis in a controlled manner, leading to exfoliation and the alleviation of certain skin conditions, including superficial acne scars.[tpl]cite pmid|18688101[/tpl] Various chemicals can be used depending upon the depth of the peel, and caution should be used, particularly for dark-skinned individuals and those individuals susceptible to keloid formation or with active infections.Khunger N. Standard guidelines of care for chemical peels. Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol online 2008 2010 May 22;74(Suppl):S5-S12. Free full-text.

===Filler injections===

Filler injections of collagen or Artefill can be used to raise atrophic scars to the level of surrounding skin.[tpl]cite pmid|20024872[/tpl] Risks vary based upon the filler used, and can include further disfigurement and allergic reaction.[tpl]cite pmid|16936549[/tpl]

===Dermabrasion===

Dermabrasion involves the removal of the surface of the skin with special equipment, and usually involves a local anaesthetic.

===Laser treatment===

Nonablative lasers, such as the Starlux Non-ablative FDA approved laser by Palomar, 585 nm pulsed dye laser, 1064 nm and 1320 nm Nd:YAG, or the 1540 nm Er:Glass are used as the standard laser therapy for hypertrophic scars and keloids.[tpl]cite pmid|21061757[/tpl] This therapy smooths the epidermis via contact cooling. Multiple sessions are usually required for a significant reduction in redness and improvement in the texture and pliability of hypertrophic scars and keloids.
Ablative lasers such as the carbon dioxide laser or Er:YAG offer the best results for atrophic and acne scars.[tpl]cite pmid|21401378[/tpl] Like dermabrasion, ablative lasers work by destroying the epidermis to a certain depth. Healing times for ablative therapy are much longer and the risk profile is greater compared to nonablative therapy; however, nonablative therapy offers only minor improvements in cosmetic appearance of atrophic and acne scars.

===Radiotherapy===

Low-dose, superficial radiotherapy is sometimes used to prevent recurrence of severe keloid and hypertrophic scarring. It is thought to be effective despite a lack of clinical trials, but only used in extreme cases due to the perceived risk of long-term side effects.[tpl]cite pmid|19935303[/tpl]
Brachytherapy or a very local radiation use radioactive patch demonstrates efficacy of keloids and hypertropic scars treatment up to 50 percent in 4 months, 90 percent in 8 months and 100 percent in 11 months with no recurrence, if not a 100 percent at least the lessions are almost diminishing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ijdvl.com/article.asp?issn=0378-6323;year%3D2007;volume%3D73;issue%3D5;spage%3D336;epage%3D339;aulast%3DVivante |title=P-patch contact brachyradiotherapy in the management of recalcitrant keloids and hypertrophic scars |accessdate=10 March 2014[/tpl]

===Semiocclusive ointments and pressure dressing===

Silicone scar treatments are commonly used in preventing scar formation and improving existing scar appearance.[tpl]cite pmid|20354695[/tpl]  A meta-study published in the Cochrane Library concluded that it is unclear whether silicone gel sheeting helps prevent scarring.Silicon gel sheeting for preventing and treating hypertrophic and keloid scars  It found that many of the studies advocating their use were of poor quality and susceptible to bias.
Semiocclusive, silicone-based ointments[tpl]cite journal |author=Ziegler UE |title=clinical recommendations on scar management |language=German |journal=Zentralbl Chir |volume=129 |issue=4 |pages=296–306 |year=2004 |pmid=15354252 |doi=10.1055/s-2004-822830[/tpl] are used to speed healing and reduce the appearance of scars, and likely work in a similar manner as silicone scar sheets.
Pressure dressings are commonly used in managing burn and hypertrophic scars, although supporting evidence is lacking.[tpl]cite journal |author=Shih R, Waltzman J, Evans GR |title=Review of over-the-counter topical scar treatment products |journal=Plast. Reconstr. Surg. |volume=119 |issue=3 |pages=1091–5 | date=March 2007 |pmid=17312518 |doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000255814.75012.35 |url=[/tpl] These involve elastic materials or gauze to apply pressure to the area. For large scars and particularly large burns, pressure garments may be worn. They are believed to work by applying constant pressure to surface blood vessels, and eventually causing scars to flatten and become softer.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] Retrospective and ultrasonic studies since the 1960s have supported their use, but the only randomized clinical trial found no statistically significant difference in wound healing. Care providers commonly report improvements, however, and pressure therapy has been effective in treating ear keloids. The general acceptance of the treatment as effective may prevent it from being further studied in clinical trials.

===Steroids===

Under medical supervision, a long-term course of corticosteroid injections into the scar may help flatten and soften the appearance of keloid or hypertrophic scars.[tpl]cite pmid|18611924[/tpl]
The steroid is injected into the scar itself; since very little is absorbed into the blood stream, side effects of this treatment are minor. However, it does cause thinning of the scar tissue so it does carry risks when injected into scars caused by operations into ruptured tendons. This treatment is repeated at four- to six-week intervals.
Topical steroids are ineffective.Jenkins M, Alexander JW, MacMillan BG, Waymack JP, Kopcha R. Failure of topical steroids and vitamin E to reduce postoperative scar formation following reconstructive surgery. J Burn Care Rehabil. 1986 Jul–Aug;7(4):309–312.

===Surgery===

Scar revision is a process of cutting the scar tissue out. After the excision, the new wound is usually closed up to heal by primary intention, instead of secondary intention. Deeper cuts need a multilayered closure to heal optimally, otherwise depressed or dented scars can result.[ref]
</ref>
Surgical excision of hypertrophic or keloid scars is often associated to other methods, such as pressotherapy or silicone gel sheeting. Lone excision of keloid scars, however, shows a recurrence rate close to 45%. A clinical study is currently ongoing to assess the benefits of a treatment combining surgery and laser-assisted healing in hypertrophic or keloid scars. [tpl]uncited|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Subcision is a process used to treat deep rolling scars left behind by acne or other skin diseases. It is also used to lessen the appearance of severe glabella lines, though its effectiveness in this application is debatable. Essentially the process involves separating the skin tissue in the affected area from the deeper scar tissue. This allows the blood to pool under the affected area, eventually causing the deep rolling scar to level off with the rest of the skin area. Once the skin has leveled, treatments such as laser resurfacing, microdermabrasion or chemical peels can be used to smooth out the scarred tissue. [tpl]uncited|date=November 2013[/tpl]

===Vitamins===

Research shows the use of vitamin E and onion extract (sold as Mederma) as treatments for scars is ineffective. Vitamin E causes contact dermatitis in up to 33% of users and in some cases it may worsen scar appearance. But Vitamin C and some of its esters fade the dark pigment associated with some scars.Farris PK. Topical vitamin C: a useful agent for treating photoaging and other dermatologic conditions. Although many people claim that vitamin therapy does in fact help. Dermatol Surg 2005;31:814-818.  This is reinforced by medical literature that supports sterile and natural oils applied on the skin epidermis can aid in moisturizing, thereby keeping the skin moist and elastic during the healing process.

==Intentional scarring==

The permanence of scarring has led to its intentional use as a form of body art within some cultures and subcultures. These forms of  ritual and non-ritual scarring practices can be found in many groups and cultures around the world.

==Research==

An intradermal injection of transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGFβ3) is being tested. The results of three trials already completed were published in the Lancet along with an editorial commentary.Renovo. http://www.renovo.com/en/news/lancet-publication.

A study implicated the protein ribosomal s6 kinase (RSK) in the formation of scar tissue and found the introduction of a chemical to counteract RSK could halt the formation of cirrhosis.
