==History==

Juye originally belonged to Huxi prefecture.

===Qing & Republic===

Juye was the site of the so-called "Juye Incident" on November 1, 1897, which provided the German government an excuse to occupy Jiaozhou Bay.

===Liberation===

From 1949 to 1952 Huxi prefecture (Juye and the other county-level parts) was under the provincial administration of Pingyuan.
In April 1953 Huxi was dismantled and its parts shared out. Juye then came into its present municipal region of Heze.
