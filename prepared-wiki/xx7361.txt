Abū al-Qāsim Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib ibn Hāshim ([tpl]lang-ar|[tpl]large|ابو القاسم محمد ابن عبد الله ابن عبد المطلب ابن هاشم[/tpl][/tpl]; [tpl]circa[/tpl] 570 – [tpl]circa[/tpl] 8 June 632),Elizabeth Goldman (1995), p. 63 gives 8 June 632, the dominant Islamic tradition. Many earlier, mainly non-Islamic traditions refer to him as still alive at the time of the invasion of Palestine. See Stephen J. Shoemaker,The Death of a Prophet: The End of Muhammad's Life and the Beginnings of Islam, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011. also transliterated as Muhammad ([tpl]lang|ar|[tpl]large|محمد[/tpl][/tpl]), was a man from Mecca who unified Arabia into a single religious polity under Islam. Believed by Muslims and Bahá'ís to be a messenger and prophet of God, Muhammad, with the exception of Ahmadi Muslims,[ref]The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community considers Muhammad to be the "Seal of the Prophets" (Khātam an-Nabiyyīn) and the last law-bearing Prophet but not the last Prophet. See:
Born in about 570 CE in the Arabian city of Mecca,[ref]
Muhammad gained few followers early on, and was met with hostility from some Meccan tribes. To escape persecution, Muhammad sent some of his followers to Abyssinia before he and his followers in Mecca migrated to Medina (then known as Yathrib) in the year 622. This event, the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar, which is also known as the Hijri Calendar.
In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina. After eight years of fighting with the Meccan tribes, his followers, who by then had grown to 10,000, took control of Mecca in the largely peaceful Conquest of Mecca. He destroyed the pagan idols in the citySahih-Bukhari, Book 43, #658 and then sent his followers out to destroy all of the remaining pagan temples in Eastern Arabia.Sahih Bukhari Book 59, #641Hisham Ibn Al-Kalbi – The Book of Idols. Translated by Nabih Amin Faris. Princeton University Press, pg. 21–22 In 632, a few months after returning to Medina from The Farewell Pilgrimage, Muhammad fell ill and died. By the time of his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam, and he had united Arabia into a single Muslim religious polity."Muhammad," Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim world[ref]See:

The revelations (each known as Ayah, lit. "Sign God") which Muhammad reported receiving until his death form the verses of the Quran, regarded by Muslims as the "Word of God" and around which the religion is based. Besides the Quran, Muhammad's teachings and practices (sunnah), found in the Hadith and sira literature, are also upheld by Muslims and used as sources of Islamic law. Muslims discuss Muhammad and other prophets of Islam with reverence, adding the phrase peace be upon him whenever their names are mentioned.Ann Goldman, Richard Hain, Stephen Liben (2006), p. 212 While conceptions of Muhammad in medieval Christendom and other premodern contexts were largely negative, appraisals in modern history have been far less unfavorable.Watt (1974) p. 231

==Names and appellations in the Quran==

The name Muhammad means "praiseworthy" and occurs four times in the Quran.Jean-Louis Déclais, Names of the Prophet, Encyclopedia of the Quran The Quran addresses Muhammad in the second person not by his name but by various appellations; prophet, messenger, servant of God ('abd), announcer (bashir)[tpl]Quran-usc|2|119|q=[/tpl], witness (shahid),[tpl]Quran-usc|33|45|q=[/tpl] bearer of good tidings (mubashshir), warner (nathir),[tpl]Quran-usc|11|2|q=[/tpl] reminder (mudhakkir),[tpl]Quran-usc|88|21|q=[/tpl] one who calls God (dā‘ī),[tpl]Quran-usc|12|108|q=[/tpl] light personified (noor)[tpl]Quran-usc|05|15|q=[/tpl], and the light-giving lamp (siraj munir)[tpl]Quran-usc|73|1|q=[/tpl]. Muhammad is sometimes addressed by designations deriving from his state at the time of the address: thus he is referred to as the enwrapped (al-muzzammil) in Quran [tpl]cite quran|73|1|s=ns|b=n[/tpl] and the shrouded (al-muddaththir) in Quran [tpl]cite quran|74|1|s=ns|b=n[/tpl].Uri Rubin, Muhammad, Encyclopedia of the Qur'an In the Quran, believers are not to distinguish between the messengers of God and are to believe in all of them (Sura Al-Baqara [tpl]cite quran|2|285|s=ns|b=n[/tpl]). God has caused some messengers to excel above others [tpl]cite quran|2|253|s=ns|b=n[/tpl] and in Sura Al-Ahzab [tpl]cite quran|33|40|s=ns|b=n[/tpl] He singles out Muhammad as the "Seal of the Prophets".Ernst (2004), p. 80 The Quran also refers to Muhammad as Aḥmad "more praiseworthy" ([tpl]lang-ar|أحمد[/tpl], Sura As-Saff [tpl]cite quran|61|6|s=ns|b=n[/tpl]).
