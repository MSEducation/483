"Tripping on Your Love" is a song recorded by English girl group Bananarama.  It appears on the group's fifth studio album Pop Life and was released as the album's fourth single in the UK and the first single in the United States.  The track was co-written and produced by Youth.
The single is considered by Bananarama to be their biggest commercial flop in the UK, just missing the top 75 of the UK singles chart.  It was originally intended to be the album's second single (following "Only Your Love") but was delayed as two different songs were released as singles.  By the time "Tripping on Your Love" was issued, Jacquie O'Sullivan had announced her departure from the group, and Bananarama's long-time manager Hillary Shaw also quit http://www.bananaramauk.com/html/discography/singles/trippingonyourlove/toylmain.html.  In addition, group member Sara Dallin was pregnant with her first child, which made promotion nearly impossible.
The song is a fusion of acid house, South Asian, rap, and Caribbean music. The album version was remixed by Robin Hancock before it was released as a single. It was not included on the original version of The Very Best of Bananarama, but a remix was included on a special edition bonus CD of the compilation.
The single's biggest success came in U.S. dance clubs, climbing to number fourteen on the Hot Dance Club Play chart.  It would be Bananarama's last appearance on that chart until 2006 when "Look on the Floor (Hypnotic Tango)" peaked at number two. The song boasts the most commissioned remixes of any Bananarama single (twenty mixes by nine different remixers, including George Michael).
In 2007 Keren said she considered the song to be one of the band's best.True Confessions Over Lunch

The music video features the girls filmed in slow-moving cinematography on a beach dune, in front of a house, and in a car. As Sara Dallin was pregnant at the time, she was shot only from the shoulder upwards.
