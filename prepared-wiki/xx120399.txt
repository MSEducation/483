Peterhead Community Hospital  is located in Peterhead, a coastal town approximately 32 miles north of Aberdeen, Scotland. 
The services provided include a small midwife led maternity unit. In August 2005 Aberdeenshire Community Health Partnership issued a consultation document on Older People’s Services, Maternity Services and Diagnostic and Treatment Services which includes several proposals for reorganisation of services in these areas.[tpl]cite web | title=Older People’s Services, Maternity Services and Diagnostic and Treatment Services | work=Aberdeenshire Community Health Partnership | url=http://193.195.78.72/nhsgrampian/files/Aberdeenshire.rtf | accessdate=2006-07-05[/tpl]
A telemedicine link has been installed with Aberdeen Royal Infirmary to enable staff in the small Minor Injuries Unit to get advice from colleagues in the Accident & Emergency department.
