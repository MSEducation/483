ABC Radio National is an Australia-wide non-commercial radio network run by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. On air, the network styles itself "RN".
Radio National broadcasts national programming in subjects that include news and current affairs, the arts, social issues, science, drama and comedy. Some programs are relayed on Radio Australia, the ABC's international free-to-air shortwave service.
Radio National currently has 327 transmitter sites and covers over 98% of the permanently inhabited areas of Australia.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl] Remote areas are served by satellite service.
All radio programs are available for live streaming over the Internet, and most (excluding drama, poetry and music) as audio-on-demand, or for download as MP3s for at least four weeks after broadcast. Some programs are available as MP3s going back to 2005, when Radio National commenced podcasting. About 25% of shows, mainly the flagship weekly shows, have written transcripts archived back to 1996.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]

==History==

From 1928, the National Broadcasting Service, as part of the federal Postmaster-General's Department, gradually took over responsibility for all the existing stations that were sponsored by public licence fees ("A" Class licences). The outsourced Australian Broadcasting Company supplied programs from 1929. In 1932 a commission was established, merging the original ABC company and the National Broadcasting Service. It is from this time that Radio National dates as a distinct network within the ABC, in which a system of program relays was developed during the subsequent decades to link stations spread across the nation.

The origins of the other stations in the network were:
The first transmitters for 2FC, 5CL and 4QG were made by AWA with power output at 5 kW. They used a MT7A valve for the final high power RF stage and a MT7B for the modulator. The power supply was 12000 volts from three phase power rectified by MR7 valves.[tpl]cite book|title=Australian Radio the Technical Story 1923-83|author=Winston T.

The radio transmitters for 3AR and 2FC were upgraded to 10 kW in a contract let in 1938 to  STC. The transmitters were designed by Charles Strong in London, and were notable in using negative feedback to ensure a high quality flat frequency response.[tpl]cite book|title=Australian Radio the Technical Story 1923-83|author=Winston T.

From 1947 until the mid-1980s, "Radio 2" (as it came to be known) was broadcast to the major metropolitan centres, with a large broadcast footprint in adjacent areas due to the powerful AM transmitters in use. It contained most of the ABC's national programming.
The power level of 2FC 3AR and 5CL was upgraded to 50 kW in the early 1950s. The transmitters for these were housed in the same building as the radio 1 network. They were manufactured by STC. The final stage contained three parallel 3J/261E air cooled triodes running in class C amplifier at 90% efficiency. These were driven by a class B modulator with the same type of valves.[tpl]cite book|title=Australian Radio the Technical Story 1923-83|author=Winston T.

In the 1970s, the network's program format began to take on a more serious tone, a style which continues to this day. Art critic Peter Timm later remarked that the network is  "virtually the only non-print media forum for art in this country."Timms, Peter. What's wrong with contemporary art? 2004, UNSW Press, ISBN 0-86840-407-1, p. 102
In the early 1980s the broadcast footprint was extended with the construction of the first of over 300 regional FM transmitters (including community re-broadcast sites). In 1985, the ABC renamed "Radio 2" as "Radio National".
Since 1990, all Radio National stations have had the same callsign format, Radio National preceded by the appropriate number for the state or territory, sometimes followed by the locality (e.g., "2RN Sydney", "3RN Melbourne").
As a result of cuts in the 1996–97 budget, Radio National was hit with a reduction of a million dollars in its funding, with a significant impact on programming.Budget Review 1996-97 Parliament House
In January 2012 Radio National was rebranded as RN, partly in recognition of the stations growing digital audience. RN has also been used as shorthand for the station's name by many presenters going back several years. The stations tagline, which has changed regularly over the years, was also changed to "Your World Unfolding" to mesh with the station's new logo and viual identity.

==2008 program schedule controversy==

In 2008, controversial programming changes once more raised the issue of funding cuts to the public broadcaster.[tpl]cite web|url=http://theland.farmonline.com.au/news/metro/national/general/abc-flagship-radio-shows-axed/1334972.aspx |title=ABC flagship radio shows axed  | work = Land |publisher=Farm Online |date=16 October 2008 |accessdate=1 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/anger-as-abc-axes-specialist-programs-from-radio-national/1335009.aspx |title=Anger as ABC axes specialist programs from Radio National | work = Canberra Times  | publisher = Fairfax |date=16 October 2008 |accessdate=1 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/10/15/2392185.htm |title=Programs axed amid Radio National reshuffle | work =  ABC News | publisher = ABC |date=15 October 2008 |accessdate=1 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2011[/tpl]  Presenter Stephen Crittenden leaked confidential Radio National programming changes in an unscheduled live broadcast before the start of his show, vehemently criticising his superiors.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2011[/tpl] [tpl]Wikiquote|Epitaphs|"... spells the death of religion at the ABC."[/tpl] Stephen Crittenden was suspended for his outburst, amid criticism from some colleagues for his unprofessionalism and praise from others for his outspokeness.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2011[/tpl] His unscripted comments were cut from Radio National's podcast and transcript of the program, but the subsequent comment by religious commentator Paul Collins on crikey.com reiterated Crittenden's fears.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crikey.com.au/Media-Arts-and-Sports/20081015-What-are-they-doing-to-Radio-National-God-help-us.html?source=kwoff |title=What are they doing to Radio National?

Another casualty of the controversy was head of ABC Radio Sue Howard, who was dismissed in 2009, partly for the perception that the controversy was mishandled.[tpl]cite web|first = Margaret | last = Simons |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/Media-Arts-and-Sports/20081217-Sue-Howard.html |title=Goodbye Sue Howard, hello ABC restructure? |publisher=Crikey |date=17 December 2008 |accessdate=1 April 2011[/tpl]
Eventually in 2012 a new Religion and Ethics report was re-launched, hosted by Andrew West. The Media Report was also relaunched, hosted by veteran broadcaster and former Life Matters host Richard Aedy.[ref]
