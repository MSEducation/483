[[Australian Mother of the Year Award]]

CATEGORIES: Australian people of the year awards

Barnardos Australia’s Mother of the Year Awards is an award which aims to recognise mothers and the important role that they play in our society; highlighting key themes such as nurturing and caring. Barnardos Australia developed the Mother of the Year Awards (BAMYA) in 1994, as an opportunity to showcase the women responsible for excellent parenting within the community.  
Nominations for the awards take place over a four-month period during which a campaign is undertaken in major print and electronic media.  Nominators prepare a statement about “why they believe their mother is Australia’s number 1 mum”.
A judging panel assesses the top 100 nominations, selecting State/Territory finalists and an overall national winner.  Each State/Territory Finalist is flown to Sydney for the announcement of the National Mother of the Year.
A number 1 mum is announced for every respective State/Territory, at a morning tea function, held to showcase that woman’s achievements.  These  events attracts wide coverage from local media, culminating in a  national presentation held in Sydney in May just prior to the Sunday designated as Mother's Day in Australia.
