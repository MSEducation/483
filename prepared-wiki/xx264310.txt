===Metalurh Donetsk===

On 2 January 2013, Marc Overmars announced the direct transfer of Lorenzo Ebecilio to the Ukrainian club for a sum of €500.000. The winger had played a significant role in the Ajax title win during the 2010–11 season, in which he had started all 16 matches after Frank de Boer's takeover following Martin Jol's resignation. However the next season saw Lorenzo receiving much less playing time, which led to his subsequent transfer during the 2012–13 winter transfer window. His contract with Ajax ran until the summer of 2014, taking a three-year contract with the Ukrainian club from Donetsk.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rtl.nl/(/actueel/rtlnieuws/cookieless/)/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/2013/01_januari/02/sport/ebecilio-op-weg-naar-metalloerg-donetsk.xml |title=Ebecilio op weg naar Metalloerg Donetsk (Dutch) |publisher=RTL News |date=3 January 2013 |accessdate=3 January 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/telesport/voetbal/ajax/21191676/__Ebecilio_drie_jaar_Donetsk__.html |title=Ebecilio drie jaar Donetsk (in Dutch) |publisher=De Telegraaf |date=3 January 2013 |accessdate=3 January 2013[/tpl]
