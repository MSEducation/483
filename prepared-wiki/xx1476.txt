</ref> Conflicts between the [[Boer]] republics in the interior and the British colonial government resulted in the [[Second Boer War]] of 1899–1902, which Britain won. In 1910, Britain established the [[Union of South Africa]], which unified the Cape Colony with the two defeated Boer Republics and the British [[colony of Natal]]. Cape Town became the legislative capital of the Union, and later of the [[Republic of South Africa]].
In the 1948 national elections, the National Party won on a platform of apartheid (racial segregation) under the slogan of "swart gevaar". This led to the erosion and eventual abolition of the Cape's multiracial franchise, as well as to the Group Areas Act, which classified all areas according to race. Formerly multi-racial suburbs of Cape Town were either purged of unlawful residents or demolished. The most infamous example of this in Cape Town was District Six. After it was declared a whites-only region in 1965, all housing there was demolished and over 60,000 residents were forcibly removed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/history/districtsix.htm|publisher=SouthAfrica.info|title=Recalling District Six|date=19 August 2003[/tpl] Many of these residents were relocated to the Cape Flats and Lavender Hill. Under apartheid, the Cape was considered a "Coloured labour preference area", to the exclusion of "Bantus", i.e. blacks.
Cape Town was home to many leaders of the anti-apartheid movement. On Robben Island, a former penitentiary island [tpl]convert|10|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] from the city, many famous political prisoners were held for years. In one of the most famous moments marking the end of apartheid, Nelson Mandela made his first public speech since his imprisonment,  from the balcony of Cape Town City Hall hours after being released on 11 February 1990. His speech heralded the beginning of a new era for the country, and the first democratic election, was held four years later, on 27 April 1994. Nobel Square in the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront features statues of South Africa's four Nobel Peace Prize winners: Albert Luthuli, Desmond Tutu, F. W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela. Since 1994, the city has struggled with problems such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, a surge in violent drug-related crime and more recent xenophobic violence. At the same time, the economy has surged to unprecedented levels due to the boom in the tourism and the real estate industries.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2008[/tpl] With a Gini coefficient of 0.67, Cape Town has the highest rate of equality in South Africa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/cape-town-least-unequal-sa-city-1.1435199#.UjdA9KwazCR |title=Cape Town least unequal SA city - Politics | IOL News |publisher=IOL.co.za |date=2012-12-04 |accessdate=2014-02-24[/tpl]

==Geography==

Cape Town is located at latitude 33.55° S (approx. the same as Sydney and Buenos Aires and equivalent to Casablanca and Los Angeles in the northern hemisphere) and longitude 18.25° E. Table Mountain, with its near vertical cliffs and flat-topped summit over [tpl]convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] high, and with Devil's Peak and Lion's Head on either side, together form a dramatic mountainous backdrop enclosing the central area of Cape Town, the so-called City Bowl. A thin strip of cloud, known colloquially as the "tablecloth", sometimes forms on top of the mountain. To the immediate south, the Cape Peninsula is a scenic mountainous spine jutting [tpl]convert|40|km[/tpl] southwards into the Atlantic Ocean and terminating at Cape Point. There are over 70 peaks above [tpl]Convert|300|m|abbr=on[/tpl] within Cape Town's official city limits. Many of the city's suburbs lie on the large plain called the Cape Flats, which extends over [tpl]convert|50|km|-1[/tpl] to the east and joins the peninsula to the mainland. The Cape Flats is situated on what is known as a rising marine plain, consisting mostly of sandy geology and confirming that at one point Table Mountain was itself an island.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl].  The Cape Town region generally, with its Mediterranean climate, extensive coastline, rugged mountain ranges, coastal plains, inland valleys and semi-desert fringes, has much in common with Southern California.

===Climate===

Cape Town has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen Csb), with mild, moderately wet winters and dry, warm summers. Winter, which lasts from the beginning of June to the end of August, may see large cold fronts entering for limited periods from the Atlantic Ocean with significant precipitation and strong north-westerly winds. Winter months in the city average a maximum of [tpl]convert|18.0|C|0[/tpl] and minimum of [tpl]convert|8.5|C|0[/tpl] [tpl]cite web |url=http://www.worldweather.org/035/c00138.htm|title=World Weather Information Service – Cape Town |accessdate=4 May 2010 [/tpl]  Total annual rainfall in the city averages [tpl]convert|515|mm|in|1[/tpl]. Summer, which lasts from early December to March, is warm and dry with an average maximum of [tpl]convert|26.0|°C|0[/tpl] and minimum of [tpl]convert|16.0|°C|0[/tpl]. The region can get uncomfortably hot when the Berg Wind, meaning "mountain wind", blows from the Karoo interior for a couple of weeks in February or early March.  Late spring and early summer may sometimes feature a strong wind from the south-east, known locally as the Cape Doctor, so called because it blows air pollution away. This wind is caused by a high-pressure system which sits in the South Atlantic to the west of Cape Town, known as the South Atlantic High. Cape Town's average amount of sunshine per year (3,100 hours) compares favourably with that of Los Angeles (3,300 hours) [tpl]cite web | url=http://www.los-angeles.climatemps.com/ | title=Los Angeles climate | publisher=climatemps.com | accessdate=30 June 2012[/tpl] and exceeds that of Athens and Madrid (2,900 hours).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.madrid.climatemps.com/ | title=Madrid climate | publisher=climatemps.com | accessdate=30 June 2012[/tpl]
Water temperatures range greatly, between [tpl]convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] on the Atlantic Seaboard, to [tpl]convert|22|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in False Bay. Average annual Ocean temperatures are between [tpl]convert|13|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] on the Atlantic Seaboard (similar to Californian waters, such as San Francisco or Big Sur), and [tpl]convert|17|°C|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in False Bay (similar to Northern Mediterranean temperatures, such as Nice or Monte Carlo).

===Flora and fauna===

Located in a CI Biodiversity hotspot as well as the unique Cape Floristic Region, the city of Cape Town has one of the highest levels of biodiversity of any equivalent area in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/publications/Pages/BrochuresBooklets.aspx |title=Brochures, booklets and posters |publisher=Capetown.gov.za |date= |accessdate=1 October 2011[/tpl] These protected areas are a World Heritage Site, and an estimated 2,200 species of plants are confined to Table Mountain – more than exist in the whole of the United Kingdom which has 1200 plant species and 67 endemic plant species.[tpl]cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Unique Biodiversity Poster | url = http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/publications/Documents/Biodiversity_poster-CT_Unique_Biodiv_SPECIES_2011-02.pdf | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 6 February 2013 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Cape Town Tourism |url=http://www.capetown.travel/votefortablemountain/ |title=Vote for Table Mountain – Cape Town Tourism |publisher=Capetown.travel |date= |accessdate=2013-01-12[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.southafricaholiday.org.uk/places/p_western_cape.htm |title=Western Cape |publisher=Southafricaholiday.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-01-12[/tpl] Many of these species, including a great many types of proteas, are endemic to the mountain and can be found nowhere else.A.G. Rebelo, C. Boucher, N. Helme, L. Mucina, M.C. Rutherford et al. 2006. Fynbos Biome, in: L. Mucina & M.C. Rutherford (eds). The Vegetation of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland.
It is home to a total of 19 different vegetation types, of which several are completely endemic to the city and occur nowhere else in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/stats/Documents/Vegetation%20Types.mht|title=National Spatial Biodiversity Assessment 2005 Targets|publisher=Capetown.gov.za|accessdate=2014-02-24[/tpl]
It is also the only habitat of hundreds of endemic species,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/EnvironmentalResourceManagement/publications/Documents/Biodiv_fact_sheet_suppl_Endemic_spp_list_2010-03.pdf|title=Endemic Species of the city of Cape Town[/tpl] and hundreds of others which are severely restricted or threatened. This enormous species diversity is mainly because the city is uniquely located at the convergence point of several different soil types and micro-climates.
Table Mountain has an unusually rich biodiversity. Its vegetation consists predominantly of several different types of the unique and rich Cape Fynbos. The main vegetation type is endangered Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos,  but critically endangered Peninsula Granite Fynbos, Peninsula Shale Renosterveld and Afromontane forest occur in smaller portions on the mountain.
Unfortunately, rapid population growth and urban sprawl has covered much of these ecosystems with development. Consequently Cape Town now has over 300 threatened plant species and 13 which are now extinct. The Cape Peninsula, which lies entirely within the city of Cape Town, has the highest concentration of threatened species of any continental area of equivalent size in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://perceval.bio.nau.edu/downloads/grail/climate_seminar/section2/Hannah_etal05.pdf |title=The View from The Cape: Extinction Risk, Protected Areas, and Climate Change |publisher=Perceval.bio.nau.edu |accessdate=2014-02-24[/tpl]
Tiny remnants of critically endangered or near extinct plants often survive on road sides, pavements and sports fields.[tpl]dead link|date=March 2011[/tpl]
The remaining ecosystems are partially protected through a system of over 30 nature reserves – including the massive Table Mountain National Park.

==Suburbs==

Cape Town's urban geography is influenced by the contours of Table Mountain its surrounding peaks, the Durbanville Hills, and the expansive lowland region known as the Cape Flats. These geographic features in part divide the city into several commonly known groupings of suburbs (equivalent to districts outside South Africa), many of which developed historically together and share common attributes of language and culture.

===City Bowl===

The City Bowl is a natural amphitheatre-shaped area bordered by Table Bay and defined by the mountains of Signal Hill, Lion's Head, Table Mountain and Devil's Peak.
The area includes the central business district of Cape Town, the harbour, the Company's Garden, and the residential suburbs of De Waterkant, Devil's Peak, District Six, Zonnebloem, Gardens, Bo-Kaap, Higgovale, Oranjezicht, Schotsche Kloof, Tamboerskloof, University Estate, Vredehoek, Walmer Estate and Woodstock.

===Atlantic Seaboard===

The Atlantic Seaboard lies west of Cape Town and Table Mountain, and is characterised by its beaches, cliffs, promenade and hillside communities. The area includes, from north to south, the neighbourhoods of Green Point, Mouille Point, Three Anchor Bay, Sea Point, Fresnaye, Bantry Bay, Clifton, Camps Bay, Llandudno, and Hout Bay. The Atlantic Seaboard has some of the most expensive real estate in South Africa particularly on Nettleton and Clifton Roads in Clifton, Ocean View Drive and St Leon Avenue in Bantry Bay, Theresa Avenue in Bakoven and Fishermans Bend in Llandudno. Camps Bay is home to the highest concentration of multimillionaires in Cape Town and has the highest number of high-priced mansions in South Africa with more than 155 residential units exceeding R20 million (or $US1.8 million).[tpl]cite web|last=Muller|first=Joan|title=Joburg has the cash, Cape Town the class|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/business/property/2014/01/15/joburg-has-the-cash-cape-town-the-class|work=BDLive|publisher=Business Day|accessdate=15 January 2014[/tpl]

===West Coast===

The West Coast suburbs lie along the beach to the north of the Cape Town city centre, and include Bloubergstrand, Milnerton, Tableview, West Beach, Big Bay, Sunset Beach, Sunningdale and Parklands, as well as the exurbs of Atlantis and Melkbosstrand. The Koeberg Nuclear Power Station is located within this area and maximum housing density regulations are enforced in much of the area surrounding the nuclear plant.

===Northern Suburbs===

The Northern Suburbs are mostly Afrikaans-speaking, and include Bellville, Bothasig, Brooklyn, Burgundy Estate, Durbanville, Edgemead, Elsie's River, Factreton, Goodwood, Kensington, Maitland, Monte Vista, Panorama, Parow, Richwood, Thornton, Table View, and Welgemoed. Much of the northern suburbs is colloquially known as Tygerberg and is home to Tygerberg Hospital, the largest hospital in the Western Cape and second largest in South Africa[tpl]cite web|last=Editor|title=Tygerberg Hospital: Overview|url=http://www.westerncape.gov.za/your_gov/153|work=Western Cape Department of Health|publisher=Western Cape Government|accessdate=15 January 2014[/tpl]

===Southern Suburbs===

The Southern Suburbs hug along the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, southeast of the city centre. This area has mixed languages but is predominantly English-speaking, and includes, from north to south, Rondebosch, Pinelands, Newlands, Mowbray, Observatory, Bishopscourt, Claremont, Wynberg, Plumstead, Ottery, and Bergvliet. West of Wynberg lies Constantia which, in addition to being a wealthy neighbourhood, is a notable wine-growing region within the City of Cape Town.

===South Peninsula===

The South Peninsula is generally regarded as the area south of Muizenberg on False Bay and Noordhoek on the Atlantic Ocean, all the way to Cape Point. Until recently quite rural, the population of the area is growing quickly as new coastal developments proliferate and larger plots are subdivided to provide more compact housing. It includes Capri Village, Clovelly, Fish Hoek, Glencairn, Kalk Bay, Kommetjie, Masiphumelele, Muizenberg, Noordhoek, Ocean View, Scarborough, Simon's Town, St James, Sunnydale, Sun Valley, and Steenberg. South Africa's largest naval base is located at Simon's Town harbour as well as Boulders Beach, the site of a large colony of African penguins[tpl]cite web|last=Editor|title=History of the South African Navy|url=http://www.navy.mil.za/aboutus/history/index.htm|work=SA Navy|publisher=SA Navy|accessdate=15 January 2014[/tpl]

===Eastern Suburbs===

The Eastern Suburbs lie southeast of the Afrikaans-speaking neighbourhoods in the Northern Suburbs, beyond the airport, and notably are the site of several new subsidized housing projects. Communities include Fairdale, Brackenfell, Kraaifontein, Kuils River, Blue Downs, Belhar, Delft, Mfuleni and Protea Hoogte.

===Cape Flats===

The Cape Flats is an expansive, low-lying, flat area situated to the southeast of the central business district of Cape Town. Described by some as 'Apartheid's dumping ground', from the 1950s the area became home to people the apartheid government designated as non-White. Race-based legislation such as the Group Areas Act and pass laws either forced non-white people out of more central urban areas designated for white people and into government-built townships in the Flats, or made living in the area illegal, forcing many people designated as Black into informal settlements elsewhere in the Flats.
The Flats have since then been home to much of the population of Greater Cape Town, and most of the residents in the area are of African descent. This area includes the neighbourhoods of Mitchell's Plain, Gugulethu, Nyanga, Langa, and Khayelitsha.

==Government==

Cape Town's local government is the City of Cape Town, which is a metropolitan municipality. Cape Town is governed by a 221-member city council. The city is divided into 111 electoral wards; each ward directly elects one member of the council, whilst the other 110 councillors are elected by a system of party-list proportional representation. The Executive Mayor and Executive Deputy Mayor are chosen by the city council.
In the local government elections of 18 May 2011, the Democratic Alliance (DA) won an outright majority, taking 135 of the 221 council seats. The African National Congress, the national ruling party, received 73 seats.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elections.org.za/content/LGEPublicReports/197/Seat%20Calculation%20Detail/WP/CPT.pdf |title=Seat Calculation Detail: City of Cape Town |publisher=Independent Electoral Commission |date=21 May 2011 |accessdate=23 May 2011[/tpl] As a result of this victory Patricia de Lille, the DA mayoral candidate, was inaugurated as Executive Mayor on 1 June.
