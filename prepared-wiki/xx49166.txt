Bedtime for Bonzo is a 1951 comedy film directed by Frederick de Cordova, starring future U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Diana Lynn.  It revolves around the attempts of the central character, Psychology Professor Peter Boyd (Ronald Reagan), to teach human morals to a chimpanzee, hoping to solve the "nature versus nurture" question. He hires Jane Linden, a woman (Diana Lynn) to pose as the chimp's mother while he plays father to it, and uses 1950s-era child rearing techniques.Rickey, Carrie.
