==Gameplay==

Hearts of Iron III allows the player to take control of almost any nation that existed during the period of 1936â€“1948, guiding it through World War II.[tpl]cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/hearts-of-iron-3/902663p1.html|title=Hearts of Iron III Preview|publisher=GameSpy|accessdate=2009-01-24[/tpl] A variety of decisions regarding the armed forces, production, research, diplomacy, politics and espionage is the focus of the game.
The game centers around three factions: the Axis (led by Germany), the Allies (led by Great Britain), and the Comintern (led by the Soviet Union). All other nations can slowly align with one of the factions. Nations are more likely to side with those with similar ideology, threat and proximity
Resources found in the game include: energy, metal, rare materials, and oil. The first three are required for industrial production, while oil is converted to fuel for vehicles, planes and ships.
The scope of military organization ranges from brigades to entire theaters of operation.

Although happy with the scope of Hearts of Iron II, lead designer Johan Andersson wanted to improve upon every aspect of the game, starting again with a new engine.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/05/31/interview-johan-andersson-on-hearts-of-iron-3/ |title=RPS interview |accessdate=2009-10-06 |publisher=www.rockpapershotgun.com[/tpl] The game's artificial intelligence (AI) was designed to be able to achieve strategic objectives and control forces delegated to it, including whole theatres of operation.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hoi3.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=96:dev-diary-27-ai-control&catid=46:developer-diary&Itemid=62 |title=Dev diary 27 |accessdate=2009-10-06 |publisher=hoi3.com[/tpl] The AI can also remember and compare strategic possibilities as circumstances change. Changing to 3D graphics helped improve other areas, as Andersson explained:
 
 "Going 3D meant we could do another type of architecture where we could support more screen resolutions, and develop our maps in a quicker way. The biggest advantage from going 3D though was the ability to offload more to the GPU. With the machine advances during the last decade this gives us the biggest benefits in development when it comes to gameplay and AI."

Paradox had a vision for the style of the map, given that the player would spend the majority of their time looking at it: "...to create a map that feels like a WW2 map, like it could be a map which...a commander in the War would be looking at himself."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hoi3.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=59:thursday-16th-october-2008-map-philosophy&catid=46:developer-diary&Itemid=62 |title=Dev diary 1 |accessdate=2009-05-06 |publisher=HOI3.com[/tpl] The content of the map was also altered; the number of provinces increased to more than 15,000 over Hearts of Iron II's 2,600. Customizable divisions, a first for the series, are available, each one containing two to five brigades, with each brigade increasing the division's combat power and cost.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hoi3.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=52:wednesday-26th-november-2008&catid=46:developer-diary&Itemid=62 |title=Dev diary 7 |accessdate=2009-05-06 |publisher=HOI3.com[/tpl]

==Reception==

Hearts of Iron III initially received a mixed reception because the game shipped with a large number of bugs in the initial release.See official patch notes and change log 1.1-1.3 Patch Changelog After several patches eliminated many bugs, reception improved and the game received generally positive reviews. In 2009 December it had a combined average of a 77 on Metacritic"2009 December score and a 79% on Gamerankings."2009 December score
Gamepro wrote "perhaps the worst problem is the interface itself, or more specifically, the amount of feedback it affords the player. In contrast to the old system, there is no instant way to assess how many divisions you have in each province, nor important values like their units' organization or combat values."
On the other hand, the game has been praised as being "tailored for experienced strat heads and wargamers with a lot of patience, but the game is more accessible than either of its predecessors and a great jumping-on point for new players who want to make the leap into a grand strategy epic."[tpl]cite web|author=August 12, 2009 6:24PM PDT |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/heartsofironiii/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;read-review |title=Hearts of Iron III Review - GameSpot.com |publisher=Uk.gamespot.com |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2013-05-08[/tpl]
