==Early life==

Named after Shirley Temple, Shirley MacLean Beaty was born in Richmond, Virginia. Her father, Ira Owens Beaty,New England Historic Genealogical Society was a professor of psychology, public school administrator, and real estate agent, and her mother, Kathlyn Corinne (née MacLean), was a drama teacher, originally from Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada. Shirley's younger brother is the actor/writer/director Warren Beatty; he changed the spelling of his surname when he became an actor.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/shirley-maclaines-recent-lives/|title=Shirley MacLaine's Recent Lives|last=Kohn|first=David|coauthors=Mike Wallace|date=May 16, 2000|work=60 Minutes|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=4 January 2014[/tpl] Their parents raised them as Baptists.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pb/Warren_Beatty.html |title=The religion of Warren Beatty, actor, director|publisher=Adherents.com|date=2005-08-30|accessdate=2010-03-06[/tpl] Her uncle (her mother's brother-in-law) was A. A. MacLeod, a Communist member of the Ontario legislature in the 1940s.[tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl] While Shirley was still a child, Ira Beaty moved his family from Richmond to Norfolk, and then to Arlington and Waverly, eventually taking a position at Arlington's Thomas Jefferson Junior High School. Shirley played baseball on an all-boys team, holding the record for most home runs which earned her the nickname "Powerhouse".  During the 1950s, the family resided in the Dominion Hills section of Arlington.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.arlingtonva.us/departments/CPHD/ons/hp/file84027.pdf|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Dominion Hills Historic District|author=Laura Trieschmann, Paul Weishar, and Anna Stillner|date= May 2011[/tpl]
She had weak ankles as a toddler, so her mother decided to enroll her in ballet class at the age of three.[tpl]cite book|last=Denis|first=Christopher |title=The films of Shirley MacLaine |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PwEvAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=April 11, 2011|year=1980|publisher=Citadel Press|isbn=978-0-8065-0693-7|page=14[/tpl] This was the beginning of her interest in performing. Strongly motivated by ballet, she never missed a class. In classical romantic pieces like Romeo and Juliet and The Sleeping Beauty, she always played the boys' roles due to being the tallest in the group and the absence of males in the class. Eventually she had a substantial female role as the fairy godmother in Cinderella; while warming up backstage, she broke her ankle, but proceeded to dance the role all the way through. Ultimately she decided against making a career of professional ballet because she had grown too tall and was unable to acquire perfect technique. She explained that she didn't have the ideal body type, lacking the requisite "beautifully constructed feet" of high arches, high insteps and a flexible ankle.[tpl]cite book|last=MacLaine|first=Shirley| title=My Lucky Stars: A Hollywood Memoir |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kSKjB8WWKoIC |accessdate=April 11, 2011|date=November 1, 1996|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-553-57233-9[/tpl] Also slowly realising ballet's propensity to be too all-consuming, and ultimately limiting, she moved on to other forms of dancing, acting and musical theatre.
She attended Washington-Lee High School, where she was on the cheerleading squad and acted in school theatrical productions. The summer before her senior year, she came to New York City to try acting on Broadway, and had some success. After she graduated, she returned and within a year became an understudy to actress Carol Haney in The Pajama Game; Haney broke her ankle, and Shirley replaced her. A few months after, with Haney still injured, film producer Hal B. Wallis saw Shirley's performance, and signed her to work for Paramount Pictures. She later sued Wallis over a contractual dispute, a suit that has been credited with ending the old-style studio star system of actor management.Hanrihan v. Parker, 19 Misc. 2d 467, 469 (N.Y. Misc. 1959)

==Career==

MacLaine made her film debut in Alfred Hitchcock's The Trouble with Harry (1955), for which she won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress. In 1956, she had roles in Hot Spell and Around the World in 80 Days. At the same time she starred in Some Came Running, the film that gave her first Academy Award nomination – one of five that the film received – and a Golden Globe nomination. Her second Oscar nomination came two years later for The Apartment, starring with Jack Lemmon. The film won five Oscars, including Best Director for Billy Wilder. She later said, "I thought I would win for The Apartment, but then Elizabeth Taylor had a tracheotomy." She starred in The Children's Hour (1961) also starring Audrey Hepburn and James Garner, based on the play by Lillian Hellman and directed by William Wyler. She was again nominated, this time for Irma la Douce (1963), which reunited her with Wilder and Lemmon. Don Siegel, her director on Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970) said of her: "It's hard to feel any great warmth to her. She's too unfeminine and has too much balls. She's very, very hard."Patrick McGilligan, Clint: The Life and Legend (1999), p. 182
In 1975, she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Feature for her documentary film The Other Half of the Sky: A China Memoir. Two years later, she was once again nominated for an Oscar for The Turning Point co-starring Anne Bancroft, in which she portrayed a retired ballerina much like herself. In 1978, she was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award for outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry.http://wif.org/past-recipients In 1980, she starred in A Change of Seasons alongside Anthony Hopkins.
