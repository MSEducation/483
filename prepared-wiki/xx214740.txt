Shokeda ([tpl]lang-he-n|שׁוֹקֵדָה[/tpl]) is a religious moshav in southern Israel. Located approximately six kilometres west of Netivot and covering 6,000 dunams, it falls under the jurisdiction of Sdot Negev Regional Council. In 2006 it had a population of 224.
The village was established in 1957 by the Jewish Agency for immigrants from Morocco. They arrived in two groups, and the original aim was to found two settlements; Shokeda and Tzumha. However, only one of them was established.
