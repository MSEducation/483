Ali ([tpl]lang-ar|علي[/tpl], [tpl]transl|ar|ʿAlī[/tpl]) is a male Arabic name, derived from the Arabic root [tpl]transl|ar|ʿ-L-Y[/tpl] which literally means "high" or "Elevated". It is a common name in Arabic countries and the rest of the Muslim world.
Islamic traditional use of the name goes back to Ali ibn Abu Talib, the Islamic leader and cousin of Muhammad, but the name is identical in form and meaning to the [tpl]lang-he | עֵלִי [/tpl], Eli, which goes back to the Eli in the Books of Samuel.
The name Ali can arise away from Islam; among English-speakers as short for male and female names starting with "Al-", or the Old Norse man's name Áli. It can also be a girl's name, as a shortened form of Alexandra or Alison.
Ali is also a Finnish male given name, derived from Aleksanteri.Kustaa Vilkuna, Marketta Huitu and Pirjo Mikkonen. Etunimet, published in Joka kodin suuri nimikirja. Suuri Suomalainen Kirjakerho, 1990. Also, households by a river are often named Ali- "downstream" and Yli- "upstream", thus the component Ali- occurs in surnames derived from these, e.g. Ali-Yrkkö "the house downstream of Yrkkö".  Finnish people whose names start "Ali..." are sometimes suspected abroad of being terror suspects and thus are excessively targeted for security checks at U.S and German airports. http://yle.fi/uutiset/ali-nimisia_suomalaisia_epaillaan_muslimeiksi_yhdysvaltain_rajalla/6312781 (in Finnish)
