Baal I was the king of Tyre (680 - 660 BC). His name is the same as that of the Phoenician deity, Baal. He was tributary to the Assyrians, who had conquered the rest of Phoenicia, and sent his son Yehawmelek to Ashurbanipal (r. 668-627 BC) with heavy tribute.  He also may have assisted the Assyrians in their war against Elam.
In c.675 BC he entered into a treaty with Assyrian king Esarhaddon, currently in the British Museum.
