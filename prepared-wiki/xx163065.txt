Silver is the third live album released by Cheap Trick. It was performed at Davis Park in the band's hometown of Rockford, Illinois in 1999, to celebrate the band's 25th anniversary since their formation. The album was recorded and released as a two-disc set in 2001, and re-released in 2004 with two additional tracks ("Daddy Should Have Stayed in High School" and "On Top of the World").
The band performed at least one song from each of their albums, including The Doctor, "I Want You To Want Me" (from In Color) was performed slightly differently, with the "I'd love you to love me" line sung in a different tune. Jon Brant made a brief return to play "If You Want My Love" and "She's Tight" (both from One on One). The band made acoustic arrangements of "I Can't Take It" (from Next Position Please), "Take Me to the Top" (from The Doctor), "It All Comes Back to You" (from their 2nd eponymous album), and "Tonight It's You" (from Standing on the Edge). Holland Zander, Robin Zander's daughter and former lead singer of The Snaggs, made a guest appearance to sing a duet version of "Time Will Let You Know" (from Robin Zander's solo album). Slash played guitar on "You're All Talk", ex-Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan plugs in his guitar for "Just Got Back" and Art Alexakis joined the band for a cover of The Beatles' "Day Tripper". Rick Nielsen did lead singing in "World's Greatest Lover" (from All Shook Up).
