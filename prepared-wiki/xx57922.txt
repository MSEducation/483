Route 152 is a [tpl]convert|3.16|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] long state highway in Atlantic County, New Jersey, United States. Route 152 begins at an intersection with County Route 620 and County Route 635 in the city of Somers Point. The route heads along two causeways, ending at the foot of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge over the Intracoastal Waterway in Egg Harbor Township, where the state turns maintenance back to Atlantic County as County Route 629 to Longport.
Route 152 originates as an alignment of Atlantic County Route 20, which ran along the entire alignment of Route 152 from Somers Point to Longport. The state took over Route 20 in 1969, designating the route as 152 in relation to the Route 52 designation further south. In 1988, the former bridge over the Broad Thoroughfare was demolished and replaced by the Dolores G. Cooper Bridge.

Kennedy Memorial Bridge. There, the state designation ends, and it continues as Atlantic County Route 629 (Ventnor Avenue) into Longport.

==History==

The current alignment of Route 152 originates as a state takeover of Atlantic County Route 20, which was first brought to the floor of the New Jersey State Legislature in 1968. The state approved the measure, and effective January 19, 1969, the New Jersey Department of Transportation took over maintenance of County Route 20.[tpl]cite book|title=ROUTE NO. ----.

Kennedy Memorial Bridge over Risley Channel in Atlantic county and thence proceeding toward Somers Point in said county and being presently designated as Atlantic County Route No. 20.|publisher=New Jersey State Legislature|year=1968|chapter=397[/tpl] The alignment was designated as Route 152, numbered after nearby New Jersey Route 52 to the south in Somers Point and Ocean City. Route 152 originally went along a lower bridge across the Broad Thoroughfare. In 1988, a new [tpl]convert|2862.86|ft|m[/tpl] long bridge, named the Dolores G. Cooper Bridge, was completed to the north of the former route.[tpl]cite book|last=Inventory|first=National Bridge|title=Structure Number: ++++++++0122155|publisher=United States Department of Transportation|year=2008|pages=1[/tpl] The former alignment to the south, designated as Old Road, comes to an end at a now fishing pier as the bridge has been mostly demolished. 
The route has remained intact virtually since 1988.[tpl]cite map|title=New Jersey Official Road Map|year=2007|publisher=New Jersey Department of Transportation|cartography=New Jersey Department of Transportation[/tpl]
