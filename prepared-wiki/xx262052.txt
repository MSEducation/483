==History==

Prior to the Mexican-American War the area that is today Palm City was part of Rancho La Punta, sometimes referred to as Rancho Milijo, granted to Santiago Emilio Arguello in 1834. The U.S. Land Commission rejected his claim, opening up the area to settlement; which in turn led to the creation of communities in the area.[tpl]cite book |title=San Diego County Place Names A to Z |last=Fetzer |first=Leland |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Sunbelt Publications, Inc. |location=San Diego, California |isbn=978-0-932653-73-4 |pages=76–77 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AOVyQyWDyqUC&lpg=PA77&ots=BM_sNeClvt&dq=Rancho%20Milijo&pg=PA76#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=1 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |last1=Corona |first1=Antonio Padilla |editor=Paul Bryan Gray |year=2004 |title=The Rancho Tia Juana (Tijuana) Grant |journal=The Journal of San Diego History |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages= |publisher=San Diego Historical Society |doi= |url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/v50-1/rancho_tiajuana.pdf |accessdate=1 June 2011 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.sdcounty.ca.gov/reusable_components/images/parks/doc/Cultural_Resources_Report.pdf |title=Cultural and Paleontological Research Study for the Tijuana River Valley Regional Park Trails and Habitat Restoration Enchantment Project San Diego County, California |author=SWCA Environmental Counsultants |date=24 November 2004 |work=Department of Parks and Recreation |publisher=County of San Diego |accessdate=1 June 2011[/tpl]
In the 1880s, John J. Montgomery built and designed his own ornithopters and manned glider designs at the Montgomery family Fruitland Ranch near what would become Palm City. His gliders were tested on the surrounding hillsides of Otay Mesa. These flights represented the first of their kind in the nation.Harwood, Craig S. and Fogel, Gary B. Quest for Flight: John J.
