[[Collectibles Vol 1]]

Collectibles is a compilation album released by Canadian singer-songwriter Willie P. Bennett, released in 1991 on cassette and compact disc by Dark Light Records, who also released Bennett's next album Take My Own Advice. In 1996, Bennett re-released the album independently, with a new cover and the title Collectibles Vol. 1, although a Vol. 2 was never produced.
Bennett chose to release this "best of" collection with songs from his first three albums because these albums were, at the time, long out of print and had never been available on CD. All have since been reprinted on compact disc.  The version of "Country Squall" included on this compilation is a live recording, otherwise unavailable.
