==Release==

Lemmy premiered in March 2010 at the South by Southwest film festival in Austin, Texas. After the world premiere, Wired magazine wrote "'Lemmy' mines pure gold," and Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle wrote: "What's in a name? Lemmy, Greg Olliver and Wes Orshoski's portrait of Motorhead founder Lemmy Kilmister is one of the most thorough and entertaining rock and roll documentaries since Ondi Timoner's 'Dig!' Like its subject, it's by turns, philosophical, brash, and thoroughly kickass." It was then screened at film festivals in Canada, Australia, Mexico, South Korea, Greece, Chile, Brazil, Spain, France, and elsewhere. The film was released theatrically in the U.K. in December 2010, and in the U.S. in January and February 2011. It was released on DVD, Blu-ray and digital download in the U.S. in March 2011. The U.S. version of the film is considered the "definitive," as the Blu-ray version includes more than 4 hours of extras, and the double-DVD release features more than three hours of bonus features, including more than 30 minutes of Kilmister jamming with Metallica. "Lemmy" was first screened in Britain at the London Film Festival on 23 October 2010. Entertainment One released the DVD on 24 January 2011 in the U.K.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=149836 | title='Lemmy' Movie: New Trailer Released | publisher=Blabbermouth | date=23 November 2010 | accessdate=1 January 2011 [/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://www.straight.com/article-353256/vancouver/documentary-motorhead-frontman-lemmy-kilmister-due-dvd-january | title=Documentary on Motörhead frontman Lemmy Kilmister due on DVD in January | newspaper=Georgia Straight | date=16 October 2010 | first=Steve | last=Newton | accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl]
