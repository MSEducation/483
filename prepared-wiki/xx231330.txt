The pearlescent, silver-grey colour of this fish is broken by dark stripes. It is distinguished from a species found in the eastern states of Australia by a dark stripe over the eye region. This striping is prominent in juveniles and fades as the fish matures at about three or four years old.
The breeding season is between December and March, when it may be found in depths as shallow as 20 m, over reefs, but is otherwise found in deep waters.
