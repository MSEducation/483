[[Vertex angle]]

CATEGORIES: Euclidean geometry

In geometry, a vertex angle is the angle associated with a vertex of a polygon.
The vertex angle (denoted by α1 or A1) in a polygon is measured by the interior side of the vertex. For any simple n-gon, the sum of the interior angles is π(n − 2) radians or 180(n − 2) degrees.[tpl]mathworld | urlname = VertexAngle | title = Vertex angle[/tpl]
In higher-dimensional polyhedra and polytopes, a vertex angle is an angle formed by two edges of the polyhedron that both belong to a common two-dimensional face of the polyhedron. That is, it is a vertex angle of one of the polygons that form the polyhedron.
