Nicholas Aylward Vigors (1785 – 26 October 1840) was an Irish zoologist and politician.

==Early life==

==Zoology==

Vigors was a co-founder of the Zoological Society of London in 1826, and its first secretary until 1833. In that year, he founded what became the Royal Entomological Society of London. He was a fellow of the Linnean Society and the Royal Society. He was the author of 40 papers, mostly on ornithology. He described 110 species of birds, enough to rank him among the top 30 bird authors historically. He provided the text for John Gould's A Century of Birds from the  Himalaya Mountains (1830–32).
One bird that he described was "Sabine's Snipe". This was treated as a Common Snipe by Barrett-Hamilton in 1895[tpl]cite journal | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/25584879.pdf | title=Sabine's Snipe. Gallinago Coelestis, var.

Vigors lent a skin for later editions of Thomas Bewick's History of British Birds.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v057n01/p0075-p0076.pdf | title=General Notes | journal=The Wilson Bulletin |date=March 1945 | volume=57 | issue=1 | pages=75–76[/tpl]

==Politics==

Vigors succeeded to his father's estate in 1828. He was MP for the borough of Carlow from 1832 until 1835. He briefly represented the constituency of County Carlow in 1835. Vigors had been elected in a by-election in June after the Conservative MPs originally returned at the United Kingdom general election, 1835 were unseated on petition and a new writ issued. On 19 August 1835 Vigors and his running mate, in the two member county constituency, were unseated on petition. The same two Conservatives who had previously been unseated were awarded the seats. On the death of one of them, Vigors won the subsequent by-election in 1837 and retained the seat until his own death.
