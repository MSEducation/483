Isomerisation of meta-xylene to para-xylene on passing through a ZSM-5 catalyst.
]]
ZSM-5 has been used as a support material for catalysis. In one such example, copper is deposited on the zeolite and a stream of ethanol is passed through at temperatures of 240 to 320 Â°C as a vapour stream, which causes the ethanol to oxidize to acetaldehyde; two hydrogens are lost by the ethanol as hydrogen gas. It appears that the specific pore size of ZSM-5 is of benefit to this process, which also functions for other alcohols and oxidations. The copper is occasionally combined with other metals, such as chromium, to fine tune the diversity and specificity of the products, as there is likely to be more than one. Acetic acid is an example of one possible byproduct from hot copper oxidation.
