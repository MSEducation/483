The Webster Chicago Corporation was a maker of electronic equipment in Chicago Illinois.  The product line included record changers, wire recorders and reel to reel tape recorders.  They also made phonograph amplifiers that are now used as guitar amps in some cases. These amps' sounds are similar to the sounds of the Fender Princeton.  They are valued for their all-tube signal path and hand-wired circuit. Many Webster Chicago record changers were installed in Magnavox home entertainment systems in the 1940s and early 1950s.
Many products were sold under the brand name Webcor.
