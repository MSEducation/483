[[Red Spider Nebula]]

CATEGORIES: NGC objects, Planetary nebulae, Sagittarius (constellation)

The Red Spider Nebula is a planetary nebula located in the constellation Sagittarius.  The nebula has a prominent two-lobed shape, possibly due to a binary companion or magnetic fields.
The central white dwarf, the remaining compact core of the original star, produces a powerful and hot (â‰ˆ10,000 K) wind blowing with a speed of 300 kilometers per second, which has generated waves 100 billion kilometres high. These winds are what give this nebula its unique 'spider' shape and also contribute to the expansion of the nebula.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/R/Red_Spider_Nebula.html|title=Red Spider Nebula (NGC 6537)|publisher=Encyclopedia of Science|accessdate=2009-08-12[/tpl]
The star at the center of the Red Spider Nebula is surrounded by a dust shell making its exact properties hard to determine.  Its surface temperature is probably 150,000-250,000 K although a temperature of 340,000 K or even 500,000 K is not ruled out, making it among the hottest white dwarf stars known.
The Red Spider Nebula lies toward the constellation of Sagittarius. Its distance has been variously estimated as 1900 light yearshttp://www.spacetelescope.org/images/html/heic0109a.html or, more likely, 3000-8000 light-years.
