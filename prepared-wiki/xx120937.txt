==Walser culture and language==

Though historically Gressoney-Saint-Jean and Gressoney-La-Trinité are two separate comunes, they form a Walser German cultural unity known as Greschòney or Creschnau in Greschoneytitsch (or simply Titsch), the local Walser German dialect, or Kressenau in German. They were united into one commune named Gressoney from 1928 until 1946, when the two former communes were reconstituted.
