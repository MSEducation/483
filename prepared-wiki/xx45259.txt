The Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra (GSO; [tpl]lang-sv|Göteborgs Symfoniker[/tpl]) is a symphony orchestra based in Gothenburg, Sweden. Founded in 1905, it was granted the title of the National Orchestra of Sweden ([tpl]lang-sv|Sveriges Nationalorkester[/tpl]) in 1997.  The GSO is resident at the Gothenburg Concert Hall at Götaplatsen.
Although the GSO has a broad repertoire, it has a special affinity for the works of the Nordic Late Romantic composers, such as Jean Sibelius and Edvard Grieg, which has comprised the bulk of its recorded output, as well as Neeme Järvi's specialty, Prokofiev. During Järvi's 22 years as principal conductor, the orchestra's longest, its reputation on the world stage was greatly increased, including sponsorships from Volvo and a recording contract with Deutsche Grammophon.[tpl]cite news | author=Andrew Clements | title=Sibelius: The Symphonies, Gothenburg SO/ Jarvi(Deutsche Grammophon, four SACDs) | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/sep/09/classicalmusicandopera.shopping2 | work=The Guardian | date=2005-09-09 | accessdate=2012-07-22[/tpl]  Järvi currently holds the title of Principal Conductor Emeritus (Chefdirigent Emeritus) with the GSO.
The orchestra's most recent principal conductor was Gustavo Dudamel,[tpl]cite news | author=Reed Johnson | title=Conductor Gustavo Dudamel is riding a wave of Dudamania | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-et-dudamel23-2008nov23,0,1947651.story | work=Los Angeles Times | date=2008-11-23 | accessdate=2008-11-23[/tpl] from 2007 to 2012.[tpl]cite press release | url=http://www.gso.se/?pageid=8216 | title=Dudamel förnyar kontrakt med Göteborgs Symfoniker till 2012 | publisher=Göteborgs Symfoniker | date=30 September 2009 | accessdate=2009-12-06[/tpl]  Dudamel now has the title of hedersdirigent (honorary conductor) of the GSO.  The orchestra's current principal guest conductor is Christian Zacharias.  In August 2012, the GSO announced the appointment of Kent Nagano as its principal guest conductor and artistic advisor, as of the 2013-2014 season, with an initial contract of 3 years.[tpl]cite news | author=Malin Clausson | title=Nagano tar över efter Dudamel | url=http://www.gp.se/kulturnoje/1.1049887-nagano-tar-over-efter-dudamel | work=Göteborgs-Posten | date=2012-08-30 | accessdate=2012-09-03[/tpl]
