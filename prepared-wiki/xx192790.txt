The Principality of Peremyshl was a medieval petty principality centred on Peremyshl (now Przemyśl, Poland) in the Cherven lands ("Red Rus'"). 

==First mentioning==

The Rus' Primary Chronicle, writing for the year 981, gives the first mention of Peremyshl relating the wars of Saint Vladimir: [tpl]cquote|Vladimir marched up the Lyachs and took their cities: Peremyshl, Cherven and other towns, all of which are subject to Rus even to this day.Cross, Russian Primary Chronicle, p. 95.[/tpl] 
It is possible that the Lyakhs here are the Poles. Cross argued that Lyakh was the early term for a Polish person.Cross, Russian Primary Chronicle, p. 231. Franklin and Shepard argued that these people are the same as the Ledzanians, mentioned in the 10th century De Administrando Imperio as tributaries of the Rus.Franklin & Shepard, Emergence of Rus, p. 157. Peremyshl may have been one of the Cherven towns captured by the Polish prince Boleslaw I in 1018, towns recaptured by Rus in 1031.Martin, Medieval Russia, p. 45.

==Rostislavichi==

Peremyshl was ruled initially by the descendants of Vladimir Yaroslavich — who had helped recapture the towns of Cherven Rus in 1031 — and his only son Rostislav Vladimirovich; they are hence known as the Rostislavichi.Franklin & Shepard, Emergence of Rus, p. 269. The earliest known Prince of Peremyshl is Ryurik Rostislavich, who was occupying the city when the murderers of Yaropolk Izyaslavich fled to him in 1087.Cross, Russian Primary Chronicle, p. 169.  Vsevolod I Yaroslavich, Grand Prince, is alleged to have apportioned Volhynian territories, distributing Vladimir-in-Volhynia (modern Volodymyr-Volynskyi) to Davyd Igorevich, Terebovl to Vasilko Rostislavich and Peremyshl to Volodar Rostislavich, grants confirmed at the Council of Liubech of 1097.Cross, Russian Primary Chronicle, p. 188; Franklin & Shepard, Emergence of Rus, p. 245. The city, defended by Prince Volodar, was besieged in 1097 by Yaroslav Svyatopolkovich, allied to King Coloman of Hungary.Franklin & Shepard, Emergence of Rus, p. 196. However Davyd Svyatoslavich, Prince of Chernigov, and his Polovtsy ally Bonyak defeated the Hungarians. 
Peremyshl, although originally subordinate to the Principality of Vladimir-in-Volhynia, remained a semi-independent principality into the middle of the 13th century and beyond. Although the details are not always available, it formed part of the orbit of the emerging Principality of Halych. During the conflict between Rostislav Mikhailovich and Daniil Romanovich (formerly its prince), it was one of the former's strongholds; its bishop supported Rostislav, and when Rostislav occupied Halych, he appointed Konstantin of Ryazan to oversee Peremyshl.Dimnik, Dynasty of Chernigov, p. 263. Peremyshl is known to have been the main fort of Boleslaw-Yuri, King of Rus,Rowell, Lithuania Ascending, p. 268. going into Polish hands after his death."Lords of  Peremyshl and Galich" (XPOHOC)
