But it's clever, anyway.[tpl]cite book|last=Dostoyevsky|first=Fyodor|title=The Brothers Karamazov|year=1880|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/28054/28054-h/28054-h.html|accessdate=20 February 2012|chapter=Chapter VIII: Over The Brandy[/tpl] [/tpl]

Janice: Yeah. Well, if that gets him off, I mean, it's not any different than garter belts and nurse's uniforms.
Carmela: Well, it's a gun, Janice. I thought you were a feminist.
