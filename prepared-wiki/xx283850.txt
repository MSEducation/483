Uccello was an executive at the Hartford department store G. Fox & Co.. She approached her boss in 1963 and said she would like to run for Hartford city council. Since the council met on Mondays, a day the department store was closed, her boss gave her permission to run. She served two terms on the council before being elected mayor in 1967. She ran as a Republican in a mainly Democratic Party city, and remains the city's last Republican mayor.[tpl]cite web|url=http://articles.courant.com/2012-05-18/news/hc-ed-ann-uccello-birthday-20120517_1_female-mayor-strong-mayor-system-city-council|title=Trail-Blazing Former Hartford Mayor Ann Uccello Turns 90|publisher=Hartford Courant|date=2012-05-18[/tpl] She was re-elected as mayor in 1969, and was subsequently asked by President Richard Nixon to go to Washington to work in the U.S. Department of Transportation, where she later also worked during the successive administrations of presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.
