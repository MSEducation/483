Club América Reserves are the reserve team of Club América. It was founded as Socio Águila  with the purpose of creating a bond between the fans of América and the team itself through a series of exclusive benefits. One buys a membership to become a Socio (partner) Águila, and can be entered in drawings to win prizes, such as autographed jerseys, team apparel, posters, etc. There is even membership for children under 15, known as "Socio Águila Junior". Socio Águila was in the spotlight the last two weeks of the Apertura 2007 tournament. Due to the absence of the first team, which was in Argentina to play Arsenal de Sarandí in the Copa Sudamericana 2007 championship game, Socio Águila had most of its players called up to the first team. The Mexican sports press dubbed them "Las Águilitas" (The Little Eagles). The young players performed flawlessly, beating Necaxa and Monterrey in the final two weeks, and leading Ámerica to a spot in the repechaje (wild-card playoffs), where the true first team ultimately lost to Monarcas Morelia. The call-up of their players was the only positive note in a dismal season for Socio Águila in which they only won 2 games, tied 5, and lost 11, ending up with a measly 11 points out of a possible 51, making them the worst team in the Primera A. The next season saw better but not great results.
For the 2010 season, the club signed 2 important players like Mexican Jesus Reyes Monroy and the Spaniard Rubén Mesa Visiga. They won 5, tied 4, and lost 7. They finished 14th overall. By Apertura 2009, Socio Aguila changed to Club America U-20 and U-17.
