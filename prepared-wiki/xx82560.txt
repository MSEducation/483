===We should all be Feminists===

"We Should all be Feminists" was a TED talk that was given by Adichie in 2012.
She shared her experiences of being an African feminist, and her views on gender construction and sexuality. 
Adichie believes that the problem with gender is that it shapes who we are. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg3umXU_qWc
″I am angry. Gender as it functions today is a grave injustice. We should all be angry. Anger has a long history of bringing about positive change, but in addition to being angry, I’m also hopeful because I believe deeply in the ability of human beings to make and remake themselves for the better." http://vialogue.wordpress.com/2013/12/30/ted-we-should-all-be-feminists-chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-at-tedxeuston-transcript/
The talk was sampled in Beyoncé's song 'Flawless' in December 2013.
Different parts of the speech are featured.
Adichie commented about the featuring of her speech in 'Flawless' in an interview with NPR.org. She believes it is great that the young generation starts talking about feminism. http://www.npr.org/2014/03/18/291133080/news-maker
The use of Adichie's speech in the song has brought many critiques against Beyoncé that she was a feminist. 
Adichie defended Beyoncé by asserting that people who say others are feminists are indeed feminists. http://www.clutchmagonline.com/2014/03/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie-defends-beyonce-asks-shouldnt-women-sexuality/
