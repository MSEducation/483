CATEGORIES: Tourism in Australia

Tourism is an important industry for the Australian economy. In the financial year 2010/11, the tourism industry represented 2.5% of Australia's GDP at a value of approximately A$35 billion to the national economy. This is equivalent to tourism contributing $94.8 million a day to the Australian economy.[tpl]cite web|last=Australian Bureau of Statistics|title=Tourism Satelite Account 2010-11:Key Figures|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/5249.0?OpenDocument[/tpl] Domestic tourism is a significant part of the tourism industry, and was responsible for 73% of the total direct tourism GDP. 
The 2010-11 financial year saw a record number of overseas arrivals in the financial year, with 5.9 million short-term visitor arrivals to Australia (or 588 extra visitors a day extra).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/5249.0?OpenDocument[/tpl] Tourism employed 513,700 people in Australia in 2010-11, or which 43.7% of total tourism employed persons were part-time. Tourism also contributed 8.0% of Australia's total export earnings in 2010-11.
Popular Australian destinations include the coastal cities of Sydney and Melbourne, as well as other high profile destinations including regional Queensland, the Gold Coast and the Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest reef. Uluru and the Australian outback are other popular locations, as is Tasmanian wilderness. The unique Australian wildlife is also another significant point of interest in the country's tourism.

==Trends==

Despite a year of global economic challenges and natural disasters in 2010-2011, Australia's tourism growth was supported by increased consumption (up 4.4% over the previous year, largely due to an increase in the number of visitors from overseas). On the back of a strong Australian dollar, 2010-11 also saw a record 7.4 million short-term resident departures from Australia, an increase of 9.9% from 2009-10. Domestic tourism consumption grew at less than half the pace of international consumption in 2010-11 (up 2.1% compared to 4.4%).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/5249.0?OpenDocument|title=5249.0 - Australian National Accounts: Tourism Satellite Account, 2010-11|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics[/tpl]
The Australian Government released the 2020 Tourism Industry Potential on 15 November 2010, and estimates the Australian tourism industry to be worth up to $140 billion in overnight expenditure. This growth will largely be due to key emerging markets, including the China market, which is estimated to be the largest economic contributor to the Australian tourism industry by 2020. The number of Chinese visitors has more than doubled from 2006 to 2012 reaching a peak of 626,400 in 2012 and surpassing for the first time the number of arrivals from the UK.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.carhiresearch.com.au/2012-in-numbers-australian-tourism-statistics/|title=2012 in Numbers: Australian Tourism Statistics|accessdate=2013-02-23|publisher=Car Hire Search[/tpl] In 2013, China was Australia's fastest growing tourist market.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-06-04/china-tourism-boom/4732668 |title=Australia targets China for tourism boost |author=Nicole Chettle |accessdate=6 July 2013 |date=4 June 2013 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation [/tpl] According to Tourism Australia Managing Director Andrew McEvoy Chinese are the highest spending visitors to the country.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/what-rich-chinese-tourists-want--and-where-theyre-going-to-get-it-20130606-2nryx.html |title=What rich Chinese tourists want - and where they're going to get it |author=Robert Upe |accessdate=6 July 2013 |date=6 June 2013 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media [/tpl]

==Visas==

All visitors to Australia, apart from New Zealanders, require advance permission to enter the country. For most countries, a full visa is required. Holders of passports of all European Union countries as well as all Schengen Area countries and European microstates only need to apply online for an eVisitor authorisation. Citizens of some OECD and some East Asian countries are able to apply for the similar Electronic Travel Authority authorisation.Visitors - Visas & Immigration

==Marketing==

Australia's international tourism campaigns have focused on Australia's laid back style, such as an 1980s advertising campaign featuring actor Paul Hogan telling American tourists "I'll slip an extra shrimp on the barbie for you", or its cheeky side, as in its controversial 2006 campaign in the United Kingdom using the Australian colloquialism slogan "So where the bloody hell are you?".[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]
Tourism Australia’s “No Leave No Life” campaign was launched in March 2009 by the Federal Minister for Tourism, the Hon. Martin Ferguson AM MP. This campaign was designed to remind employees of the personal and professional benefits of taking annual leave, and of taking that leave in Australia. At 30 June 2009 there were 126 million days of stockpiled annual leave in the Australian economy.[tpl]cite book |title=Annual Report 2008-2009 |publisher=Tourism Australia |page=14 |url=http://www.tourism.australia.com/documents/corporate/Annual_Report_2008_2009.pdf |accessdate=5 July 2013[/tpl] At the end of the June 2010 quarter, this number had decreased to 117 million days, following falls in the preceding three quarters.
Tourism Australia’s latest consumer campaign “There’s Nothing Like Australia” invites Australians to share their favourite Australian place or experience with the world.
The campaign is based on research conducted by Tourism Australia that showed Australians were eager to get involved in promoting their country. It was developed to involve Australians because they are the experts on what makes Australia unlike anywhere else. The core message, that ‘There’s Nothing Like Australia’ was designed for longevity through different mediums, audiences and activities.Tourism Australia Annual Report 2009-2010

==Types of tourists==

===International tourists===

New Zealand tourists make up a distinctive part of the Australian tourism market, usually taking short package tours which concentrate heavily on the iconic sights (typically Sydney, Uluru, Gold Coast and Cairns),[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl] and viewing Australian native animals (particularly the koala and kangaroo).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clivehamilton.net.au/cms/media/documents/articles/Cashing_in_on_Koalas.pdf |title=Hamilton, Clive - Cashing In On Koalas |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-07-09[/tpl]

===Backpackers===

Another major source of tourists to Australia include backpackers, mostly young people from Western European countries (particularly Britain) and North America. Spending more time in Australia, these travelers tend to explore considerably more of the country. Many backpackers participate in working holidays enabling them to stay longer in the country. Working holiday visas for Australia are available for those aged 18 to 30 for most Western European citizens, and also citizens of Canada and some developed East Asian nations such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/visitors/working-holiday/visa-options.htm |title=Visa Options - Working Holiday Makers - Visas & Immigration |publisher=Immi.gov.au |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2010-07-09[/tpl]
