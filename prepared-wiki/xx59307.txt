The term "Chung Hsing" ([tpl]lang|zh-tw|中興[/tpl]) is from the Chinese legend "[tpl]lang|zh-tw|少康中興[/tpl]" Shàokāng Zhōngxīng, referring to the restoration of the Xia Dynasty by king Shaokang, an allusion to the ROC government taking back mainland China.
It is a planned town with a population of 25,549 as of February 2010. With all the buildings owned by the government, development is strictly controlled and carefully planned.

==Overview==

Taipei, capital of the Republic of China (Taiwan), was also the capital of Taiwan Province until 1956. Ground was broken on the village on November 4, 1955, and branches of the government began moving in July 5, 1956.[tpl]cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.taichung.fcu.edu.tw/whc.pdf|title=中興新村申請聯合國世界文化遺產計畫|publisher=Center for Taichung Studies|language=Chinese|date=May 2005|accessdate=2010-12-24[/tpl] The provincial government held its first meeting at Chung Hsing New Village on November 27, 1957, and the provincial administration building began use on July 1, 1957.
The People's Republic of China (PRC), which has ruled the Chinese mainland since 1949, does not recognize the move of the provincial government from Taipei to Chung Hsing New Village as legitimate. Thus, the PRC publishes Taipei as the claimed provincial capital on its official maps.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl]

==Research development==

There are plans for an industrial innovation park to be set up in the planned zone in the city; domestic research institutes have been invited to open innovation and incubation centers there.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2010/04/14/2003470574|title=Plans for industrial innovation park to go ahead: CEPD|publisher=Taipei Times|date=2010-04-14|accessdate=2010-12-24[/tpl] In addition, a market intelligence technology center is also planned for the development of green intelligence mobile technologies through cloud computing.
The park is scheduled to begin construction after the completion of an environmental impact assessment in 2011.[tpl]cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&ID=201101210028|title=Taiwan to build advanced tech development park|publisher=Focus Taiwan News Channel|date=2011-01-21|accessdate=2011-01-21[/tpl] It is estimated to cost NT$10.7 billion (US$367.5 million) to construct, and will house 250 research and development units and provide 13,000 new jobs. No manufacturing activities will be conducted at the park, which will instead focus on emerging and advanced industrial technology.
