Bioelectronics is a recently coined term for a field of research that works to establish a synergy between electronics and biology.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.nist.gov/pml/div683/bioelectronics_report.cfm |title = A Framework for Bioelectronics: Discovery and Innovation |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology[/tpl] One of the main forums for information about the field is the Elsevier journal Biosensors and Bioelectronics, published since 1990. The journal describes the scope of bioelectronics as follows:
 The emerging field of Bioelectronics seeks to exploit biology in conjunction with electronics in a wider context encompassing, for example, biological fuel cells, bionics and biomaterials for information processing, information storage, electronic components and actuators. A key aspect is the interface between biological materials and micro- and nano-electronics.[tpl]cite web |url = http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/405913/authorinstructions |title = Biosensors and Bioelectronics |publisher=Elsevier[/tpl]
