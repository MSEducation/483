The 1986–87 Serie A season ended with S.S.C. Napoli doing the "domestic double", winning their first Scudetto and third Coppa Italia, spurred on by their talismanic captain Diego Maradona, who had also just played a key part in World Cup glory for his home country of Argentina.
Juventus, Inter Milan, Hellas Verona and AC Milan all qualified for the 1987/1988 UEFA Cup, while Brescia, Atalanta and Udinese were all relegated to Serie B.
Atalanta B.C., while being relegated to Serie B, had the unusual distinction of also qualifying for the 1987/1988 Cup Winners' Cup as 1986/1987 Coppa Italia runners-up.
