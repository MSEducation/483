4 Nights at the Palais Royale is a live album released by the Canadian rock band Sloan in 1999.  It was recorded from four live shows performed at the Palais Royale in Toronto, Ontario, in 1998 (although some of the songs were taken from other concerts on their 1998 tour).  The band and fans alike consider it a fairly accurate representation of a typical Sloan concert, with a mix of old and new songs and plenty of audience participation.
