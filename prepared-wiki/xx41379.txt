The founder of the company, Eikichi Matsuda (松田栄吉), was from the former town of Yoshino (吉野町) in Osaka Prefecture, and there is a predominant belief that it is the origin of the name,"吉野家の歴史に関するご質問." (Japanese) YOSHINOYA CO., LTD. Retrieved July 6, 2011. and the letter 家 (ya) means "house." The letter 吉 (yoshi) means "good fortune" and 野 (no) means "field."
The nickname of the restaurant is "yoshigyū" (吉牛), which is an abbreviation of Yoshinoya no gyūdon (吉野家の牛丼, Yoshinoya's gyūdon).Wikipedia contributors. "吉野家." Wikipedia: Japanese language version. June 22, 2011, 03:38 UTC. Retrieved July 6, 2011.
The kanji of yoshi is slightly different from 吉 and has a part of 土 instead of 士, which is not included in standard Japanese computer fonts, while a Unicode number is assigned to it (𠮷).

==Logo==

“The Logo of Yoshinoya is a “bull horn” was invented by Yoshinoya’s founder Eikichi Matsuda.The idea of the "bull horn" logo derived from the initial letter of Yoshinoya's English name "Y", while the rope surrounding the horn represents the "Yokozuna" ranking (winner) in Japanese sumo-wrestling, also representing the "Yokozuna" quality of our food. The surrounding rope is made up of 27 rice grains and the whole logo means Yoshinoya sells the "best beef bowls". “ Hong Kong Yoshinoya official website: http://www.yoshinoya-hk.com/en/

==History==

Yoshinoya first opened in 1899 at the Nihonbashi fish market in Tokyo.http://www.yoshinoya.com/shop/tsukiji/ (Retrieved on April 10, 2010)  When the market was devastated by the Great Kanto Earthquake, Yoshinoya moved to the new Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo in 1926. 
The chain opened its first store that is open 24 hours in 1952. 
On December 27th, 1958, the chain's business model was changed from self-employed restaurants to a stock company, as an attempt to gain more profit.  
In 1965, the chain earned million dollars in sales, which led to the idea of expanding the chain's operations in Japan. 
The chain's first franchised store was opened in Shinsaibashi, in 1968. 
In 1975, the first American store of the fast-food chain was opened in Colorado.       
In the early 2000s, Yoshinoya triggered a price war in Japan along with other chains such as McDonald's, by introducing a regular beef bowl dish for 280 yen, or around US$3.
In late 2001, a domestic mad cow incident critically damaged beef bowl sales. In late 2003, Japan suspended imports of American beef due to a BSE incident in Washington State, cutting off Yoshinoya's main source of short plate (fatty beef) that is the main component of its beef bowl. This forced Yoshinoya to terminate beef bowl sales in Japan for the first time in its history on February 11, 2004. News of the removal of this item from Yoshinoya's menu caused its fans and non-fans alike to queue in massive lines at its restaurants all around Japan to taste what might be their last beef bowl for a long time. Yoshinoya then switched to serving pork bowl (butadon) instead of beef. On the other hand, its restaurants in the United States continued to serve the beef bowl using American short plate. From December 2, 2004, restaurants in Japan started serving "beef yakiniku bowls" (牛焼肉丼, gyū-yakiniku-don) which use Australian beef, different sauce and additional vegetables,Press release http://www.yoshinoya-holdings.com/dc/2004/pdf/041125.pdf (Retrieved on April 10, 2010) distinguished from original "beef bowls" that use American beef.
In December 2005, Japan agreed to remove the restriction on importing beef from the United States. A letter to customers was then put up in restaurants promising that the beef bowl would return in a couple months or so. In January 2006, imports stopped again because inspectors found banned cattle parts in a veal shipment from the United States. In June 2006, Japan lifted the ban on imports again, and on July 31, 2006, Yoshinoya re-posted the letter promising to resume serving the beef bowl in about two months.
On September 18, 2006, Yoshinoya brought back their beef bowl for one day as "the beef bowl revival festival" (牛丼復活祭, gyūdon fukkatsusai). This "revival", however, meant that its beef bowls would be available only the first five days of the month in October and November. On December 1, 2006, they began serving beef bowls daily, albeit at limited hours. These hours were extended once during special campaigns in February and December of 2007. By March 17, 2008, Yoshinoya announced that they would resume 24-hour sales of the beef bowl, rolling out through their then 1040 stores nationwide through March 20, 2008. An announcement of banned cattle products in a Californian beef import on April 21, 2008, did not halt the company's plans, as they felt they had enough stock from other sources to avoid a recall.
