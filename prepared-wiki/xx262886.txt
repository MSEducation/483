The Simplício Hydroelectric Complex is located on the Paraíba do Sul river on the border of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais states in Brazil. Supported by the Anta Dam, it transfers water through a [tpl]Convert|26|km|mi|0[/tpl] circuit to a downstream power plant. After years of delay and a cost of US$2 billion, the power complex became operational in June 2013.[tpl]cite web|title=Delay in operation of HPP Simplicio, Furnas, already exceeds one year|url=http://www.cerpch.unifei.edu.br/noticias/atraso-na-operacao-da-uhe-simplicio-de-furnas-ja-ultrapassa-um-ano.html|publisher=Cerpch|accessdate=8 February 2013|language=Portugues[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Plant stands by Simplicio single drop of 115 m|url=http://www.piniweb.com.br/construcao/infra-estrutura/obra-da-usina-de-simplicio-se-destaca-por-queda-unica-292341-1.asp|publisher=PINI Web|accessdate=2 August 2013|language=Portuguese|date=10 July 2013[/tpl]

==Background==

Construction on the complex began in January 2007 after the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) issued an installation permit. One goal of the project is to reduce environmental impacts created by large reservoirs. The complex's five reservoirs will have a surface area of [tpl]Convert|15.36|km2|mi2|0[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|title=Water takes a surprising course|url=http://www.odebrechtonline.com.br/materias/01501-01600/1532/|publisher=Odebrecht|accessdate=2 January 2011[/tpl] On August 5, 2009, the river was diverted through the Anta Dam's spillway.[tpl]cite web|title=Simplício Hydroelectric Complex carries out re-routing of Paraíba do Sul river|url=http://www.odebrecht.com/en/node/3509|publisher=Odebrecht|accessdate=2 January 2011[/tpl] The rate progress is such that the completion of construction is on schedule for commissioning in 2013.[tpl]cite web|title=A strong focus on renewables|url=https://www.ambienteenergia.com.br/index.php/2011/12/uma-forte-aposta-nas-fontes-renovaveis/16352|publisher=Ambiente Energia|language=Portuguese|accessdate=11 January 2012|date=28 December 2011[/tpl] The Anta Dam began to impound its reservoir in late February 2013.[tpl]cite news|last=Harris|first=Michael|title=Reservoir Filling Begins at Brazil's Simplicio Hydroelectric Complex|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/02/reservoir-filling-begins-at-brazils-simplicio-hydroelectric-complex|accessdate=6 May 2013|newspaper=HydroWorld.com|date=26 February 2013[/tpl] All three generators went into operation by early June 2013. The project was completed almost three years behind schedule. Delays were attributed to increased costs, lengthy permit approvals and a court decision which delayed the Anta Reservoir from being filled.

==Operation==

Water from the Paraíba do Sul is impounded at the [tpl]Convert|29.5|m|ft|0[/tpl] high and [tpl]Convert|260|m|ft|0[/tpl] long roller-compacted concrete Anta Dam before being diverting into a series of eight water channels, four water tunnels and five reservoirs totaling [tpl]Convert|26|km|mi|0[/tpl] in length. At the end of the circuit, the water is fed to a power station containing 3 x 101.3 MW Francis turbines. The Anta Dam itself supports a 28.8 MW power station with 2 x 14.4 MW Kaplan turbine-powered generators.[tpl]cite web|title=Sandvik Drill Rigs Tackle Brazilian Hydropower Tunnels|url=http://tunnelbuilder.com/news-archive-detail.php?nsid=660|publisher=Tunnel Builder|accessdate=2 January 2011[/tpl]
The water diverted by the dam first enters channel C1 which is [tpl]Convert|1.9|km|mi|0[/tpl] long, [tpl]Convert|28|m|ft|0[/tpl] wide and [tpl]Convert|8|m|ft|0[/tpl] deep. After C1, the water moves into the [tpl]Convert|1458|m|ft|0[/tpl] long tunnel T1 before entering the [tpl]Convert|1|km|mi|0[/tpl] long channel C2. After C2 and the use of a dike, the water forms the Tocaia reservoir before entering channel C3 which is [tpl]Convert|565|m|ft|0[/tpl] long.  From C3, water is led into tunnel T2 and then to the [tpl]Convert|85|m|ft|0[/tpl] long channel C4 before reaching tunnel T2A. Water from T2A enters a valley and with the assistance of two dikes, creates Louriçal reservoir. From the reservoir, water enters channel C5 which directs it to the third Calçado reservoir which is partially created by the project's largest dike of [tpl]Convert|75|m|ft|0[/tpl] in height and [tpl]Convert|400|m|ft|0[/tpl] in length. The Calçado reservoir uses an outlet works to remove any excess water from the reservoir and help maintain appropriate levels.
Water from the reservoir then moves into the [tpl]Convert|73|m|ft|0[/tpl] long channel C6 which feeds the project's longest tunnel, T3, at [tpl]Convert|6.03|km|mi|0[/tpl] in length. From T3, water moves into the Antonina reservoir before reaching the [tpl]Convert|203|m|ft|0[/tpl] long channel C7 and then into the Peixe reservoir which is created with the assistance of three dikes. After the reservoir, the water is transferred to intake channel C8 and from there into three [tpl]Convert|300|m|ft|0[/tpl] long penstocks which feed the Simplício Power Plant's three Francis turbines. The penstocks provide [tpl]Convert|80|m|ft|0[/tpl] of hydraulic head and are at a 12.48 percent angle. Once the water is discharged from the power station, it returns to the Paraíba via a [tpl]Convert|760|m|ft|0[/tpl] long tailrace channel.
