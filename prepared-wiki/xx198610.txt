Avelino Arredondo was a Uruguayan assassin.

==Background==

Arredondo was a strong supporter of a rival faction of the ruling Colorado Party government of President of Uruguay Juan Idiarte Borda. An apparent attempt was made on the life of President Idiarte in April 1897, and which was widely publicized, including in El Día, edited by José Batlle y Ordóñez, where Arredondo's name also mysteriously appeared in connection with this incident, although he was ostensibly unconnected with this attempt on Idiarte's life.
