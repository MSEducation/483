Ysgol Aberconwy is an English medium mixed comprehensive school on the North Wales coast. The school occupies a partly new, partly refurbished campus completed in 2005 situated directly onto the  Conwy estuary and is two minutes from the A55 Expressway linking Chester to North Wales. 
The current headteacher is David Wylde, who entered this post at the beginning of the 2004-05 academic year. Ysgol Aberconwy's school day currently consists of five lessons, from 08.45 until 15.10. Pupils are sorted into 1 of 4 different houses, which each have a corresponding colour on the uniform.
Catering and maintenance of the school and its grounds is contracted out to the private company Sodexho, the French catering and facilities management organisation.
