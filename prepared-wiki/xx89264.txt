==Tully's Coffee==

In January 2013, Dempsey announced that his company (Global Baristas) had secured the winning bid to purchase Seattle-based Tully's Coffee, which had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October. Dempsey's bid of $9.15M was enough to secure Tully's over the bids of six others including Starbucks. Dempsey's company will control 47 Tully's locations in the Seattle area, but not the online business which had been purchased by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters in 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/04/showbiz/patrick-dempsey-coffee-chain/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|title=Patrick Dempsey: Winning bid for coffee-shop chain 'just felt right'|date=January 5, 2013|accessdate=January 6, 2013|publisher=CNN[/tpl]
Following a legal dispute with investor group Global Baristas owner Michael Avenatti, Dempsey left the group, in effect officially leaving his managerial positions with Tully's. Dempsey had filed a lawsuit on behalf of Global Baristas, claiming that Avenatti borrowed $2 million against Tully's assets without informing Dempsey, rather than fully financing the coffee chain as was promised, calling the 15 percent interest rate on the loan “exorbitant” and sued for Avenatti to fund Tully’s operations and meet its working capital needs, as well as for any damages owed the company. Soon after, Avenatti’s office issued a second statement saying the partnership was dissolved and that Dempsey wished the lawyer and the company “all the best.” Avenatti has stated the dispute was only a "misunderstanding" and will continue operating the group with other investors and new management.[tpl]cite news|title=Patrick Dempsey Says Goodbye to the Coffee Chain He Rescued|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-27/patrick-dempsey-says-goodbye-to-the-coffee-chain-he-rescued|accessdate=November 13, 2013|newspaper=businessweek.com|date=August 27, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Dempsey walks away from Tully’s after suing partner|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2021672793_dempseytullysxml.html|accessdate=November 13, 2013|newspaper=seattletimes.com|date=August 23, 2013[/tpl]
