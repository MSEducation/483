==Composition and Lyrics==

The song begins with a progressive chorus guitar riff played, and the song soon becomes heavier occasionally. Vinnie has said that this song was about a relationship Anselmo had been in previously. "This Love was pretty much the story of a relationship he had been in, and he was really mad about it!"

==Reception==

"This Love" is one of Pantera's most popular songs. It was the band's first song to chart on the US Billboard Hot 100 reaching #6.

==Music video==

The music video for "This Love" was directed by Kevin Kerslake and shows the band playing on a rooftop while smoke drifts over them. The shot cuts to scenes of prostitution and the chorus shows the band inside, playing on a stage, cutting between this and the rooftop. The prostitute gets into a cab which is occupied by another man, who tries to rape her. From the last moments of the video, it appears that she kills him, because she is seen dragging him from the cab and leaving him by the roadside. Phil Anselmo can be seen wearing a Down t-shirt.
