==Government==

Organisation of the eyalet in the 17th century, from the accounts of Evliya Çelebi: "In this province there are nineteen sanjaks and five hakumets (or hereditary governments) ... eight sanjaks were at the time of the conquest conferred on Kurdish Begs with the patent of family inheritance for ever. Like other sanjaks they are divided into ziamets and Timars, the possessors of which are obliged to serve in the field; but if they do not, the ziamet or Timar may be transferred to a son or relation, but not to a stranger.
The hakumets have neither ziamets nor Timars. Their governors exercise full authority, and receive not only the land revenues, but also all the other taxes which in the sanjaks are paid to the possessor of the ziamet or Timar, such as the taxes for pasturage, marriages, horses, vineyards, and orchards. ...
The officers of the divan of Diarbeker are the Defterdar of the treasury with a ruz-namji (journal writer); a Defterdar of the feudal forces an inspector (Emin), and a lieutenant Kehiya of the Defter, and another for the Chavushes; a secretary (Katib), a colonel, and a lieutenant colonel of the militia".[tpl]Google books|66hCAAAAcAAJ|page=90|Narrative of travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa in the ..., Volume 1[/tpl] By Evliya Çelebi, Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall
