Fimbulwinter was a black metal band that was part of the early Norwegian black metal scene. It formed in Oslo during 1992 and released two demos that year. In 1994 it released its only album, Servants of Sorcery. Featuring a cover of Celtic Frost's "Morbid Tales", it was the first release by newly formed Hot Records.
The band broke up shortly after. Guitarist Shagrath joined Dimmu Borgir and bassist Skoll joined Ulver.
The band is named after Fimbulvetr (or Fimbulvinter), an event in Norse mythology.
