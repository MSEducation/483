==Operational history==

The de Havilland Mosquito operated in many roles during the Second World War, being tasked to perform medium bomber, reconnaissance, tactical strike, anti-submarine warfare and shipping attack and night fighter duties, both defensive and offensive, until the end of the war.Bowman 2005, p. 7.
In July 1941, the first production Mosquito W 4051 (a production fuselage combined with some prototype flying surfaces â€“ see section of Article "Prototypes and test flights") was sent to No. 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU), operating at the time at RAF Benson.[ref]
