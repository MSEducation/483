==Overview==

North Cypress is located in the Westman region of Manitoba, between Brandon and Portage la Prairie. The area includes the independently governed town of Carberry and the unincorporated communities of Brookdale, Wellwood and Edrans. Also located in North Cypress are the Acadia, Fairway and Riverbend Hutterite colonies. The municipality has connections to the Trans Canada Highway (which runs directly through North Cypress), as well as Highway 5 and PR 351, which both service the municipality. Carberry is the largest community in the area, although it is not technically a part of the RM. It is the centre of the trade region, and the location of all municipal government offices.

==Economy==

North Cypress enjoys a healthy economy, in part due to its location along the Trans Canada Highway, access to both the Canadian Pacific and Canadian National rail lines, close proximity to Brandon and direct route to Winnipeg. The municipality is set upon rich sandy soil, and is widely known for the high quality potatoes which are grown on large, technologically advanced farming operations. The municipality is also known for the dense forests of spruce, poplar and aspen oak trees and scenic residential subdivisions and property in the Carberry sandhills that make up significant portions of the municipality. It is home to several major employers including McCain Foods and ADM Agri Industries. The Manitoba Crop Diversification Centre (MCDC) is also located in North Cypress.

==Services==

Emergency services in the municipality are provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Carberry/North Cypress Fire Department, and the Carberry & District Health Center.
Schools in North Cypress are overseen by the Beautiful Plains School Division, and include R.J. Waugh Elementary School and Carberry Collegiate Institute in Carberry, Brookdale Elementary School in Brookdale, and several small Hutterite colony schools located on the Acadia, Fairway and Riverbend Hutterite colonies.  

==Wildlife==

The area is home to many species of wildlife including some protected and endangered species. White-tailed deer, moose, elk, great horned owl, snowy owl, gray wolf, canadian lynx, peregrine falcon, coyote and the rare skink are just a few of the animal species that are found within North Cypress.  Although not common, American black bears, bobcats and pumas are also routinely spotted in the area. 
Because of the unique ecosystem and large forests, there are several large parcels of crown land and protected land areas within North Cypress, including a large part of the Spruce Woods Provincial Forest, and a small part of Spruce Woods Provincial Park. Most of both of these actually lie in the Rural Municipality of South Cypress, to the south, in addition to being partially in the Rural Municipality of Victoria, to the east.
As in most districts in Canada, hunting and trapping within North Cypress is regulated, and poaching laws are strictly enforced.

==Historic note==

In the past, the municipality was home to two major Canadian Forces installations, Camp Hughes and RCAF Station Carberry.
