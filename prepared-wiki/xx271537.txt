[[Lamb Dicke regime]]

CATEGORIES: Atomic physics

In ion trapping experiments, the Lamb Dicke regime (or Lamb Dicke limit) is a quantum regime in which the coupling (induced by an external light field) between the ion's internal qubit's states and its motional states is sufficiently small so that transitions that change the motional quantum number by more than one, are strongly suppressed.
This condition is quantitively expressed by the inequality

where 
The Lamb Dicke regime corresponds to the condition
The Lamb-Dicke parameter actually is defined as
The square of the Lamb Dicke parameter then is given by

==Mathematical background==

If the condition for the Lamb-Dicke regime is met, a Taylor expansion is possible,

==Meaning of Lamb Dicke regime==

In the Lamb Dicke regime spontaneous decay occurs predominantly at the frequency of the qubit's internal transition (carrier frequency) and therefore does not affect the ion's motional state most of the time. This is a necessary requirement for resolved sideband cooling to work efficiently.
Reaching the Lamb Dicke regime is a requirement for many of the schemes used to perform coherent operations on ions.  It therefore establishes the upper limit on the temperature of ions in order for these methods to create entanglement. During manipulations on ions with laser pulses, the ions cannot be laser cooled. They must therefore be initially cooled down to a temperature such that they stay in the Lamb Dicke regime during the entire manipulation process that creates entanglement.
