Key Tronic (NASDAQ:KTCC) is a computer equipment manufacturer founded in 1969. Its core product group includes keyboards, mice and other input devices. They are considered to be one of the pioneers in ergonomic keyboard design.  Key Tronic operates worldwide with activities in The United States, Mexico, and China.
After the introduction of the IBM PC, Key Tronic began manufacturing keyboards compatible with the IBM PC keyboard.
Most of their keyboards are based on the 8048 microcontroller to communicate to the computer.  Their early keyboards used an Intel 8048 MCU, however as the company evolved, they began to use their own 8048-based MCUs.
In 1978, Key Tronic Corporation introduced keyboards with capacitive-based switches, one of the first keyboard technologies to not use self-contained switches. There was simply a sponge pad with a conductive-coated Mylar plastic sheet on the switch plunger, and two half-moon trace patterns on the printed circuit board below. As the key was depressed, the capacitance between the plunger pad and the patterns on the PCB below changed, which was detected by integrated circuits (IC). These keyboards were claimed to have the same reliability as the other "solid-state switch" keyboards such as inductive and Hall-Effect, but competitive with direct-contact keyboards. Prices of $60 for keyboards were achieved and Key Tronic rapidly became the largest independent keyboard manufacturer.
