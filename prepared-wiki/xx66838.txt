Brian Cowen (born  10 January 1960) is a former Irish politician who served as Taoiseach of Ireland from 7 May 2008 to 9 March 2011. He was head of a coalition government led by Fianna Fáil which until 23 January 2011 had the support of the Green Party and independent TDs.The Progressive Democrats party was part of the coalition government from May 2008 until the partys dissolution in November 2009.
Cowen was also leader of Fianna Fáil from 7 May 2008 until 22 January 2011, when he resigned under political pressure after a failed and highly controversial attempt at a cabinet reshuffle.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0122/politics.html |title=Cowen resigns as FF leader, remains Taoiseach |work=RTÉ News |date=22 January 2011[/tpl]
He was a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Laois–Offaly constituency from 1984 to 2011. He previously served as Minister for Labour (1992–93), Minister for Energy (1993), Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (1993–94), Minister for Health (1997–2000), Minister for Foreign Affairs (2000–04) and Minister for Finance (2004–08)[tpl]cite web|url=http://oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&HouseNum=30&MemberID=253&ConstID=123|title=Mr. Brian Cowen|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=14 May 2009[/tpl] and also as Tánaiste (2007–08). He became leader of Fianna Fáil on the resignation of Bertie Ahern. On 7 May 2008, following the resignation of Ahern as Taoiseach, Cowen was nominated by Dáil Éireann to replace him and was appointed by the President later that day.
Cowen's administration coincided with the Irish financial and banking crises. He has received substantial criticism for his failure to stem the tide of either crisis, ultimately culminating in his government's formal request for financial rescue from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, widely seen in Ireland as a national humiliation.Recapturing relevance a huge challenge for FF Cowen has brought record low levels of public support for Fianna Fáil, his government, and the Taoiseach himself. With approval at 8 percent by the time the 30th Dáil was dissolved,  he was the least popular incumbent politician in the history of Irish opinion polling. "As Taoiseach," said The Sunday Times, "he has proved to be a dismal failure." In 2011, the Irish Independent called Cowen the "worst Taoiseach in the history of the State."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/the-worst-week-for-the-worst-taoiseach-in-the-states-history-2507517.html |title=The worst week for the worst Taoiseach in the State's history |work=The Irish Independent |date=23 January 2011 |accessdate=23 January 2011[/tpl]

==Early and private life==

Brian Cowen was born in Tullamore, County Offaly[ref]

Archived from Jan. 2010[/ref] on 10 January 1960. He grew up at the family home in Clara. He is the son of May and Bernard Cowen, a former Fianna Fáil TD and Senator. The family owned a public house in Clara town, beside the family home. His father also worked as an auctioneer. Cowen often worked as a barman in his father's pub when he was growing up. He has two brothers – Christopher and Barry. His brother, Barry, is also involved in politics and is a TD for Laois Offaly. His other brother, Christopher, is a publican (who was found by taxation authorities to have failed to pay taxes), runs the family pub and is the oldest of the Cowen brothers. The old Cowen family home and pub are soon to be demolished to make way for a new development.
Cowen was educated at Clara National School, Árd Scoil Naomh Chiaráin (St. Ciaran's High School), located at Clara, County Offaly, and the Cistercian College of Mount St. Joseph in Roscrea, County Tipperary. He was twelve years old when he entered Mount St. Joseph College, as a boarder. After secondary school, he attended University College Dublin where he studied law. He subsequently qualified as a solicitor from the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, Dublin.
Cowen is married to Mary Molloy and they have two daughters.
He is a member of the Gaelic Athletic Association and continues to serve as president of Clara GAA club.  He also played with the Offaly Gaelic football team in the early 1980s.  Cowen likes to socialise with his constituents in some of the local pubs in his native Offaly. In May 2003, he took part in a charity CD project organised by The Brewery Tap pub in Tullamore. The CD featured 28 songs, including Cowen singing the Phil Coulter song, "The Town I Loved So Well".
In May 2007, Cowen told Jason O'Toole of Hot Press that, as a student: "I would say there were a couple of occasions when marijuana was passed around – and, unlike President Clinton, I did inhale. There wasn't a whole lot in it really."

==Early political career==

Cowen was elected to Dáil Éireann in the Laois–Offaly by-election of 1984, caused by the death of his father. At the time Cowen, at the age of 24, became the youngest member of the 24th Dáil. He was also elected to Offaly County Council in the same year, taking over the seat vacated by his late father. He served on that authority until 1992.
Cowen remained on the backbenches of Dáil Éireann for the next seven years. Following the 1989 general election when Fianna Fáil formed a coalition government with the Progressive Democrats for the first time, Cowen was one of a number of TDs who were vehemently opposed to the move. Two years later in November 1991, the then Minister for Finance, Albert Reynolds, challenged Charles Haughey for the leadership of the party. Cowen firmly aligned himself behind Reynolds and quickly became associated with the party's so-called '"Country & Western" wing.  (Reynolds's supporters earned this nickname due to the fact that the vast majority were rural deputies and that Reynolds had made a lot of money in the dance hall business in the 1960s.) Reynolds became leader on his second attempt, when Haughey was forced to retire as Taoiseach in 1992.
Reynolds appointed Cowen, aged 32, to his first cabinet position as Minister for Labour. In spite of being a member of the cabinet, Cowen's attitude was hostile to his coalition partners, the Progressive Democrats.  This was evident at the Fianna Fáil party's Ardfheis in March 1992.  In the warm-up speech before the leader's address, Cowen remarked, "What about the PDs?  When in doubt, leave them out." He fought with the PDs, being furious at their interference with Fianna Fáil's view that, as majority partner, they should have wielded the power.
The 1992 general election produced a hung Dáil and resulted in negotiations between all the main parties.  Cowen, along with Noel Dempsey and Bertie Ahern, negotiated on behalf of Fianna Fáil in an attempt to form a government with the Labour Party. A deal was  reached between the two parties, and Cowen was again appointed Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. In that role, he implemented the controversial decision to relax the so-called stopover at Shannon Airport, which allowed limited direct trans-Atlantic flights from Dublin Airport.  The decision proved divisive and saw one Fianna Fáil TD, Síle de Valera, resign from the party in protest.
In October 1994, it was revealed that Cowen had 1,000 shares in Arcon, a company to which he was in the process of awarding a mining licence. He quickly sold the shares and apologised in the Dáil for causing himself and his colleagues "some embarrassment".
Later in 1994, Albert Reynolds resigned as Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil. Bertie Ahern became the new leader; however the party was now in opposition. Cowen  was appointed to the front bench, first as spokesperson on Agriculture, Food and Forestry (1994), and later as spokesperson on Health (1997).

==Cabinet career: 1997–2008==

===Minister for Health and Children===

When Fianna Fáil returned to power following the 1997 general election, Cowen was appointed to the newly expanded position of Minister for Health and Children. He described his period there as like being in Angola because administrative "landmines" could detonate without warning. During his tenure, he had to deal with problems of bed shortages and overcrowding in hospitals, as well as a prolonged nurses' strike in 1999.  It came as a relief to Cowen when he vacated the Department  for Health and Children on being appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in January 2000.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2008[/tpl]

===Minister for Foreign Affairs===

Cowen's tenure as Foreign Minister saw extensive negotiations continue regarding the Northern Ireland peace process and other international activities, particularly when Ireland gained a place on the United Nations Security Council. In 2003, he was the victim of a personal attack by the leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, Ian Paisley, a former outspoken critic of the Republic of Ireland and its government. In front of a crowd of party supporters and in the presence of television cameras and radio reporters, Paisley uttered a diatribe about Cowen's personal appearance and also insulted his mother. In 2004, Cowen played a key role during Ireland's Presidency of the European Council and the simultaneous expansion of the European Union.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl]

===Minister for Finance===

Following the departure of Charlie McCreevy in September 2004, Cowen became Minister for Finance. On 1 December 2004, he announced his first budget, one that was viewed as a give-away budget in which spending was increased by 9%.
Cowen's second budget in 2005 was dominated by a new childcare package, and measures to take 'tax-free millionaires' back into the tax net from 2007 by restricting tax breaks. A readjustment of income-tax measures were designed to take 52,000 low earners out of the tax net and remove 90,000 middle earners from the higher tax band.
Cowen's third budget in 2007, in anticipation of the 2007 general election, was regarded[tpl]who|date=December 2011[/tpl] as one of the biggest spending sprees in the history of the state. The €3.7 billion package included increases in pension and social welfare allowances, a marked green agenda, as well as a reduction in the top rate of income tax from 42% to 41%. Cowen has been criticised for alleged complacency during the economic turmoil in January 2008.

==Leader of Fianna Fáil==

During his ministerial career, Cowen was often identified in the media as the front-runner to succeed Bertie Ahern as leader of Fianna Fáil. Cowen's position was strengthened when he succeeded Mary O'Rourke as deputy leader of the party in 2002. Subsequently, in 2004, he was appointed Minister for Finance, seen as an almost mandatory position for any aspiring Taoiseach, and Tánaiste in 2007.
On 4 April 2008, two days after Ahern announced his intention to resign as Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna Fáil, Cowen was nominated by Brian Lenihan and Mary Coughlan to the position of Leader of Fianna Fáil. The following day he was confirmed as the sole nominee for the position, He was elected as the seventh leader of Fianna Fáil on 9 April 2008, and assumed office upon Ahern's resignation becoming effective on 6 May.
On 7 May 2008, Cowen was nominated by Dáil Éireann as Taoiseach, by 88 votes to 76, and was appointed by President Mary McAleese.
On 22 January 2011, despite winning a secret confidence motion the week before, Cowen announced he was stepping down as leader, in advance of the 2011 election, in order to put the party in "the best possible position".[tpl]cite news|author=Shane Harrison BBC NI Dublin correspondent |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12259306 |title=BBC News – Irish PM Brian Cowen steps down as Fianna Fail leader |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=22 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl]

==Taoiseach: 2008–11==

Upon appointment, Cowen formed the 28th Government of Ireland out of a coalition of Fianna Fáil, the Green Party, the Progressive Democrats, and initially three independent TDs.  His choices of Mary Coughlan for Tánaiste and Brian Lenihan, Jnr as Minister for Finance were criticised as inappropriate by The Irish Times for their "distressing" lack of experience.

===Treaty of Lisbon===

The Irish electorate's rejection of the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon on 12 June 2008 was viewed by some media and political observers as a protest against Cowen and his government.[tpl]cite news|author=Gaelic games |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/buck-stops-at-top-cowen-has-failed-his-first-big-test-1409571.html?startindex=10#comments |title=Buck stops at top: Cowen has failed his first big test |publisher=Independent.ie |date=14 June 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2010[/tpl]  The Irish Independent called the failed referendum's aftermath the government's "biggest political crisis in decades."[tpl]cite news|author=Gaelic games |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/lisbon-treaty/cowen-disaster-little-authority-and-no-leadership-1410607.html |title=Cowen disaster: little authority and no leadership |publisher=Independent.ie |date=15 June 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2010[/tpl] Columnist Brendan O'Connor called the outcome "a humiliating failure for Cowen and the people who put him there."
The Taoiseach himself arguably dealt a damaging blow to his own side when, on 12 May 2008, he admitted in a radio interview that he had not read the Treaty of Lisbon in its entirety. The treaty was eventually approved by Irish voters when the successful Twenty-eighth Amendment of the constitution was approved in the second Lisbon referendum, held in October 2009.

===2009 Budget===

Cowen delivered the Irish government budget for 2009 on 14 October 2008, brought forward from its usual December date due to the global financial crisis. The budget, labelled "the toughest in many years",[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/1009/1223445618089.html|title=Ministers prepare for toughest budget in years|date=9 October 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=The Irish Times[/tpl] included a number of controversial measures, such as a proposed income levy and the withdrawal of previously promised HPV vaccines for schoolgirls. Other results of the budget included a new income levy being imposed on all workers above a specified threshold and the closure of a number of military barracks near the border with Northern Ireland.
Public outcry arose over the proposed withdrawal of medical cards and the reinstatement of university fees. A series of demonstrations ensued amongst teachers and farmers, whilst on 22 October 2008, at least 25,000 pensioners and students descended in solidarity on government buildings at Leinster House, Kildare Street, Dublin. Some of the pensioners were even seen to cheer on the students as the protests passed each other on the streets of Dublin.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2008/1023/1224713994987.html?via=rel|title=Thousands march in day of anti-Budget protests|date=23 December 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=The Irish Times[/tpl] Changes to education led to a ministerial meeting with three Church of Ireland bishops over what was viewed as a disproportionate level of cuts to be suffered by Protestant Secondary schools.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breaking/ireland/mhidojideycw/|title=COI bishops to meet Education Minister over Budget cuts.|date=12 November 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=Irish Examiner[/tpl] Separately representatives of the Roman Catholic Church were assured by O'Keeffe that it would continue to be able to provide religious instruction to pupils in primary schools not under the patronage of the Church.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2008/1113/1226408582468.html|title=O'Keeffe reassures on religious instruction|date=13 November 2008|accessdate=7 January 2009|publisher=The Irish Times[/tpl]
Rebellion within the ranks of the government led to a number of defections of disenchanted coalition members. County Wicklow TD Joe Behan resigned from the Fianna Fáil party in protests at the proposed medical card changes. He, alongside two other government deputies, later voted against his former colleagues in two crucial Dáil votes on medical cards and cancer vaccines. These defections reduced the Irish government's majority of twelve by one quarter. Finian McGrath, an Independent TD, who agreed to support the government after the 2007 election, also withdrew his support from the government. A senior political source said: "The Budget was an accident waiting to happen."[tpl]cite news|author=Independent.ie |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/discontented-ministers-suppress-fury-1510534.html |title=Discontented ministers suppress fury |publisher=Independent.ie |date=26 October 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2010[/tpl]
Under the European Union stability and growth pact, EU states are required to keep their budget deficit-to-GDP ratio below a three percent limit and maintain a debt-to-GDP ratio below 60 percent. On 31 October 2008, the European Commission opened an excessive deficit procedure against the Government for allowing its budget deficit to exceed the required EU deficit-to-GDP ratio of 3 percent. The Irish deficit was expected to be 5.5 percent in 2008, and 6.5 percent in 2009.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2008/1103/breaking37.htm |title=Commission takes action against Ireland over deficit |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=11 November 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2010[/tpl] This response forced reversals of proposed changes in several areas, contributing to perceived weakness in his Government.[tpl]cite news|author=If you want to get ahead... |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/taoiseach-talks-tough-then-does-third-uturn-1514643.html |title=Taoiseach talks tough, then does third U-turn |publisher=Independent.ie |date=31 October 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2010[/tpl]

===2008 Pork crisis===

On 6 December 2008, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland ordered the recall, withdrawal and destruction of all Irish pork products dating back to 1 September, due to the discovery of toxic levels of dioxin in a small percentage of the pig stock. Cowen additionally approved a five-day withdrawal of Irish pork from the market, Within days thousands of jobs were either lost or under threat at pig processing plants across the country, as processors refused to resume slaughter of pigs until they received financial compensation; the crisis ultimately cost taxpayers approximately €180 million.[ref]

===Anglo Irish Bank===

The heavy exposure of Anglo Irish Bank to property lending, with most of its loan book being to builders and property developers, meant that it was badly affected by the downturn in the Irish property market in 2008.[tpl]cite news|author=Insurance |url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/onetrick-commercial-loan-lender-came-unstuck-1603989.html |title=One-trick commercial loan lender came unstuck |publisher=Independent.ie |date= 16 January 2009|accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl] On 15 January 2009, after attempting to salvage the Bank by injecting €1.5bn into its coffers, the Government announced that it would take steps that would enable the Bank to be taken into State ownership. The Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act, 2009 provided for the transfer of all the shares of the Bank to the Minister for Finance and was enacted under Irish law on 21 January 2009. On the same date, the Bank was re-registered as a private limited company.Ministers Statement>
Observers at the time commented that the government had been slow to respond to the collapse of the Bank, with the Sunday Times stating that “Nationalisation was good enough for other European governments but Brian Cowen’s administration avoided the inevitable until its back was to the wall. Too frequently, it is seen to be reacting to events, not controlling them.”

===2009 Emergency budget===

In a second emergency budget, delivered in April 2009, a fiscal deficit of 10.75 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) was addressed.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0408/breaking51.html |title=World reaction to Budget |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=4 April 2009 |accessdate=12 June 2010[/tpl] The budget's initiatives included a doubling of the previous year's income levy to 2%, 4% and 6%; increases on the excise duties on a regular packet of cigarettes (25 cents) and a litre of diesel (5 cents); a new "asset management agency" established to remove bad loans from Irish banks; the gradual elimination of early childcare supplement by 2010, to be replaced by a subsidy towards pre-school for 3 and 4-year olds; and no further increases in social welfare for at least two years.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/money/budget2009/stories/2009/0407/budgetmeasures.html|title=Budget Measures|date=7 April 2009|accessdate=7 April 2009|publisher=RTÉ[/tpl] Cowen defended the emergency measures as necessary.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0407/breaking81.html|title=Budget 'toughest' in years – Cowen|date=7 April 2009|accessdate=9 April 2009|publisher=The Irish Times[/tpl]

===First no confidence vote===

National and international press reactions to the budget were largely favourable, with the economics editor of the BBC reported that there were lessons for the United Kingdom to learn from this emergency procedure and the European Commission hailing the budget as a form of "decisive action".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0408/breaking51.html|title=World reaction to Budget|date=8 April 2009|accessdate=8 April 2009|publisher=The Irish Times[/tpl] However, it did little to revive the political fortunes of Cowen's government. After Fianna Fáil performed badly in the elections of 5 June 2009, losing half its European Parliament seats, Fine Gael tabled a motion of no confidence against Cowen on 9 June. He survived the vote by a thin margin of 85–79.

===2010 Budget and NAMA controversy===

Cowen's government's third budget within 14 months, delivered on 9 December 2009, saw the government facing the reality of the country nearly becoming insolvent.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/podcasts/2009/pc/pod-v-101209-51m11s-todaywithpatkenny.mp3 |title=RTÉ podcast with Minister for Finance 10 December 2009 |date= |accessdate=12 June 2010 |work=RTÉ News[/tpl]

According to the BBC, social welfare cuts had not been implemented by the country since 1924.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8413122.stm|title=Irish MP's F-word outburst sparks parliament review|date=15 December 2009|accessdate=15 December 2009|publisher=BBC[/tpl] The cuts prompted at least one angry outburst in Dáil Éireann.
In February 2010, Cowen defended his claim that the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) would increase the supply of credit into the economy despite the International Monetary Fund (IMF) saying it would not lead to any significant increase. "People should contemplate what level of credit accessibility we'd have in this economy without NAMA," he said.
"It's not just sufficient in itself obviously for credit flow, it's certainly an important and necessary part of restructuring our banking system, of that there's no doubt, in terms of improving as a location for funding of banking operations," said Mr. Cowen. He previously said that the Government's objective in restructuring the banks through NAMA was to "generate more access to credit for Irish business at this critical time". In September 2009, the Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, expressed a similar view, saying it would lead to more lending for business and households. Cowen was responding to reports published on 8 February that the IMF had told Brian Lenihan in April 2009 that the NAMA would not lead to a significant increase in lending by the banks.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2010/0208/1224263954908.html |title=IMF warned Nama would not lead to significant bank lending |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=8 February 2010 |accessdate=12 June 2010[/tpl]
The comments, which appear in internal Department of Finance documents released under the Freedom of Information Act, were made by senior IMF official, Steven Seelig, who was to join the board of NAMA in May 2010. Minutes of a private meeting at the department between Mr. Lenihan and IMF officials on 29 April 2009 state that the "IMF (Mr. Seelig) do not believe that Nama will result in significant increase in bank lending in Ireland". The Government has maintained that NAMA's purchase of bad loans from the banks with State bonds would increase the flow of credit in the economy since the plan was unveiled April 2009. Speaking at the publication of the NAMA legislation in September 2009, Mr. Lenihan said it would "strengthen and improve" the funding positions of the banks "so that they can lend to viable businesses and households". The IMF estimated in their published report that domestic banks would face losses of up to €35 billion, though the department pointed out this would be partly funded from operating profits and provisions already taken against some loan losses.

===Second no confidence vote===

Speaking on RTÉ on 15 May 2010, Cowen said that, in hindsight, he should have introduced a property tax to cool the property boom. Responding to the Taoiseach's defence of his actions as minister for finance, Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny accused him of "washing his hands" of his role in Ireland's economic crisis. Speaking during a front bench meeting in Cork Mr. Kenny also claimed Fianna Fáil was spreading fear by considering cuts to the old age pension. "Sorry is a word that Fianna Fáil do not recognise, they don't understand," Mr. Kenny told party colleagues. Mr. Kenny said Taoiseach Cowen, in defending his own personal handling of events, was refusing to acknowledge that he drove the economy "up on the rocks" for four years when he was minister for finance. "He expects everybody else to accept responsibility for it but not him. It's another example of hands being washed by those in charge, a refusal to accept responsibility for their part in destroying the Irish economy and heaping economic woes . . . upon so many people." The Fine Gael leader said the best thing the Taoiseach could do was to hold the three pending by-elections, or a general election, so the people could have their say.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2010/0515/1224270465049.html |title=Ahern accepts he played a role in economic crisis |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=15 May 2010 |accessdate=12 June 2010[/tpl]
On 15 June 2010, Cowen faced his second no-confidence motion in just over a year, tabled by Fine Gael after the publication of two reports that criticised government policies in the run-up to Ireland's banking crisis. He again survived the motion, 82-77.

===EU and IMF Rescue===

On the evening of 21 November 2010, Cowen confirmed that Ireland had formally requested financial support from the European Union's European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), after long resisting pressure from other eurozone nations, particularly France and Germany.[tpl]citation | title = Ireland confirms EU financial rescue deal | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11807730 | publisher = BBC News | date = 21 November 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/1121/imf2-business.html|title=Plan will have policy conditions – ECB|date=21 November 2010|work=RTÉ News and Current Affairs|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|accessdate=21 November 2010[/tpl] On 28 November, the European Union agreed to a €85 billion rescue deal of which €22.5 billion from the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), €22.5 billion from the IMF, €22.5 billion from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and bilateral loans from the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden. The remaining €17.5 billion will come from a state contribution from the National Pension Reserve Fund (NPRF) and other domestic cash resources.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/1128/govtstatement.html|title=Government Statement on the announcement of joint EU – IMF Programme for Ireland|date=29 November 2010|work=Government of Ireland|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|accessdate=29 November 2010[/tpl]
The bailout was widely seen in Ireland as a national humiliation, a betrayal of the long-fought struggle for Irish independence whose legacy forms a major part of the Irish identity. The Irish Times asked
[tpl]cquote|whether this is what the men of 1916 died for: a bailout from the German chancellor with a few shillings of sympathy from the British chancellor on the side. There is the shame of it all.

On 24 November 2010 Cowen unveiled a four-year plan to stabilise the economy by 2014.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/1124/economy.html |title=Minimum wage lowered, VAT to rise in plan |publisher=Rte.ie |date=24 November 2010 |accessdate=18 January 2011[/tpl] The plan was met with great protest as it included deeply unpopular elements, including drastic cuts in social welfare, the lowering of the minimum wage, and an increase in the value added tax while maintaining the state's low corporate tax rate.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/1124/economy_tracker.html |title=Govt four-year plan unveiled – As it happened |publisher=Rte.ie |date=18 January 2011 |accessdate=18 January 2011[/tpl] In recognition of the political disaster this would inflict on his government, Cowen indicated that the election would take place in early 2011 after the 2011 budgetary process has been completed, though at the time he would not set a specific date.[tpl]cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/11/2010112219263374514.html |title=Irish election set for early 2011 |work=Aljazeera |date=22 November 2010[/tpl]

==Fall from power==

===Meeting with Seán FitzPatrick===

It was revealed following the publication of the book,[tpl]cite web|author=Dominic Hyde |url=http://www.broadsheet.ie/2011/01/12/how-you-didnt-hear-about-the-fitzpatrick-tapes-until-you-picked-up-the-sunday-times |title=How You Didn’t Hear About The Fitzpatrick Tapes Until You Picked Up The Sunday Times |publisher=Broadsheet.ie |date=12 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl] The Fitzpatrick TapesISBN 978-1-84488-260-1 by Tom Lyons and Brian Carey, that two previously undisclosed meetings had occurred between Sean FitzPatrick the chairman of Anglo Irish Bank and Brian Cowen.
The first was a telephone call in March 2008, while Cowen was overseas in Vietnam and when Cowen was then Minister of Finance.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0109/anglo.html |title=Taoiseach confirms contacts with FitzPatrick – RTÉ News |publisher=Rte.ie |date=9 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl] The second meeting took place on 28 July 2008 at Druids Glen in County Wicklow.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0109/breaking12.html |title=Cowen confirms FitzPatrick talks – The Irish Times – Sun, Jan 09, 2011 |publisher=The Irish Times |date= 1 January 2011|accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://irishpublishingnews.com/2011/01/11/the-fitzpatrick-tapes-tuesday-round-up/ |title=The Fitzpatrick Tapes ~ Tuesday Round Up |publisher=Irish Publishing News |date=11 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl]
At that time Anglo Irish Bank was badly affected by the downturn in the property market. On 28 September 2008, the Irish government made the decision to introduce a bank guarantee to cover Anglo Irish Bank, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland. Seán FitzPatrick was forced to resign in January 2009 over the Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy. The meeting, over a seven-hour period, took place over a round of golf and a subsequent dinner with Fitzpatrick and two other directors of Anglo Irish Bank.
During a heated Leader's Question session in Dáil Éireann, which ran over the allotted time considerably, Cowen denied that Anglo Irish Bank had been discussed.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0112/politics.html |title=Taoiseach rejects 'absurd conspiracy theory' – RTÉ News |publisher=Rte.ie |date= 13 January 2011|accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl] However when questioned by the Sinn Féin Dáil leader Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin (who had been attending a wedding at the hotel and by chance had encountered Cowen and Fitzpatrick), Cowen was forced to admit that there were two other people at the meeting, Gary McGann, a director of Anglo Irish Bank and Alan Gray, a director of the Central Bank and currently managing director of a consultancy company Indecon.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0113/1224287413115.html |title=Sinn Féin's sucker punch takes the wind out of Taoiseach but no doubt he's forgotten it already – The Irish Times – Thu, Jan 13, 2011 |publisher=The Irish Times |date=13 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011 |first=Miriam |last=Lord[/tpl] Brian Cowen has claimed that the meeting was a social event while Gray has stated that he was invited to provide economic advice on stimulating the economy.[tpl]cite web|url=http://m.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0113/breaking22.htm?via=latest |title=Full text of Alan Gray statement | The Irish Times |publisher=M.irishtimes.com |date=13 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl] Tánaiste Mary Coughlan described the purpose of the meeting as a fundraiser for Fianna Fáil.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newstalk.ie/2011/news/6no-banking-discussed-between-taoiseach-and-fitzpatrick-says-coughlan84/ |title=No banking discussed between Taoiseach and FitzPatrick, says Coughlan |publisher=Newstalk.ie |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl]
Cowen has subsequently threatened to sue Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin if he repeated the accusation outside the Dáil.

===January cabinet reshuffle===

In the stir created by the revelations of Cowen's meetings with Fitzpatrick, Labour Party Leader Eamon Gilmore announced his plan to table a third motion of no confidence in Cowen's government, and calling on the Green Party and Independent partners in the coalition government[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0114/breaking50.html|title= Gilmore tables 'no 'confidence' motion |author=Eanna O Caollai |work=The Irish Times |date=14 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011[/tpl] At the time, however, Cowen’s more immediate concern was pressure from within his own party to step down as leader of Fianna Fáil. Cowen announced on 16 January 2011 that he would not resign as party leader of his own accord; however, he would put down a motion of confidence in his leadership at Fianna Fáil's parliamentary party meeting on 18 January, to be decided by secret ballot. Foreign Minister Micheál Martin publicly announced that he would vote against the motion, effectively presenting himself as a challenger to Cowen's leadership.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0117/breaking4.html |title=Martin claims support for Fianna Fáil leadership bid |work=The Irish Times |date=17 January 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0116/politics.html |title=Martin calls for Fianna Fáil to change leader |work=RTÉ News |date=16 January 2011 |accessdate=16 January 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0116/breaking2.html |title=Martin to vote against Cowen |work=The Irish Times |date=16 January 2011 |accessdate=16 January 2011[/tpl] On the evening of 18 January Government Chief Whip John Curran announced that Cowen had prevailed in the confidence vote, although the exact counts were to remain secret and the ballots had been shredded.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0118/politics.html |title=LIVE – Brian Cowen wins leadership vote |work=Raidió Teilifís Éireann |date=18 January 2011 |accessdate=18 January 2011[/tpl] Cowen also announced that he had "reluctantly" accepted Martin's resignation from his government.
The following day, however, Cowen forced the resignation from cabinet of three more Fianna Fáil ministers, Noel Dempsey, Dermot Ahern, Tony Killeen  as well as independent minister Mary Harney;[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0119/harneym.html |title=Four ministers resign from Cabinet| work=RTÉ News |date=20 January 2011|accessdate=21 January 2011[/tpl] the day after that, another minister, Batt O'Keefe, resigned. The resignations (all of whom had already declined to stand in the 2011 general election) were engineered to allow Cowen to appoint replacement Fianna Fáil ministers who might strengthen his party's position for the election. However, the junior coalition partner, the Green Party, expressed outrage that they had not been consulted about the reshuffle. The Greens accordingly refused to endorse the replacements, obliging Cowen to reassign the vacant portfolios to incumbent Fianna Fáil ministers. They also demanded a firm date for the general election; Cowen subsequently announced that it would take place on 11 March.
Moreover, Green Party leader John Gormley publicly stated that trust between the coalition parties had been greatly eroded, perhaps irreparably.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0120/cowenb.html |title=Taoiseach expected Greens to back changes |work=Raidió Teilifís Éireann |date=20 January 2011 |accessdate=22 January 2011[/tpl] At that point, members of Fianna Fáil, including many of those who had previously announced support for Cowen in the party's confidence motion, began questioning his leadership and pressing for his resignation from leadership before the election.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0121/1224288009729.html |title=Cowen's spectacular coup ends as one of the greatest self-inflicted wounds |work=The Irish Times |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=22 January 2011 |first=Harry |last=McGee[/tpl] The press, meanwhile, compared the attempted reshuffle and its fallout to the GUBU political disaster of the early 1980s Charles Haughey government, up to that point the most sensational political scandal in the history of the Republic.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0121/1224288007036.html |title=GUBU is back as Cowen presses self-destruct button |work=The Irish Times |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=22 January 2011 |first=Deaglán |last=De Bréadún[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/lise-hand-never-mind-gubu-these-are-the-mad-last-days-of-biffo-2505505.html |title=Lise Hand: Never mind GUBU, these are the mad last days of BIFFO |work=The Irish Independent |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=21 January 2011[/tpl] Fianna Fáil, already at a record low 14% approval rating, slid in the wake of the botched reshuffle to 8%.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/cowen-bails-out-as-ff-hit-8pc-low-2507450.html |title=Cowen bails out as FF hit 8pc low |work=’’The Irish Independent’’ |date=23 January 2011 |accessdate=23 January 2011 |first1=Jody |last1=Corcoran |first2=Daniel |last2=McConnell[/tpl]

===Resignation as leader===

Faced with the collapse of his coalition, rebellion within his own party, and an acknowledged public relations disaster,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/allies-turn-backs-on-cowen-2506559.html |title=Allies Turn Backs on Cowen |work=The Irish Independent |date=22 January 2011 |accessdate=22 January 2011 |first1=Fiach |last1=Kelly |first2=Aine |last2=Kerr[/tpl] Cowen announced his resignation as leader of Fianna Fáil on 22 January 2011. He insisted, however, that he would continue as Taoiseach until the election, in order to complete legislation for the 2011 budget.
The resignation did not quell the consequences of Cowen’s actions, however. Eamon Gilmore announced that he would go forward with his motion of no confidence on Wednesday, 26 January. Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny also announced that if Cowen did not ask President Mary McAleese for an immediate dissolution of the Dáil Éireann, his own party would put forward a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach on Tuesday, ahead of Labour's motion.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0122/breaking19.html |title=Cowen to face FG confidence vote |work=The Irish Times |date=22 January 2011 |accessdate=22 January 2011[/tpl] Then, on Sunday the 23rd, John Gormley announced that the Green Party was withdrawing from the government coalition, leaving Cowen at the head of a minority government (with seven ministers, the absolute minimum mandated by the constitution) and facing two consecutive no-confidence votes in the Dáil.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2011/0124/1224288165852.html |title=Early election looms after Greens leave government |work=’’The Irish Times’’ |date=24 January 2011 |accessdate=23 January 2011 |first=Stephen |last=Collins[/tpl]

===Finance Bill, dissolution and retirement===

On 24 January, Finance Minister Brian Lenihan met with delegations from Fine Gael, Labour, and the Greens, striking a final deal. Labour and Fine Gael agreed to drop their no-confidence motions in exchange for an agreement that the finance bill would be finalised in the Dáil by Friday the 28th (with the Seanad to finalise on Saturday), upon which Cowen would immediately petition the president for dissolution.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0124/breaking8.html |title=Lenihan and Opposition reach deal on Finance Bill |work=’’The Irish Times’’ |date=24 January 2011 |accessdate=24 January 2011[/tpl]
The Dáil actually passed the finance bill on Thursday, 27 January, with the Seanad following on Saturday.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0127/breaking18.html |title=Finance Bill passed by Dáil |work=The Irish Times |date=27 January 2011 |accessdate=29 January 2011 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0129/financebill.html |title=Finance Bill passes all stages in Seanad |work=RTE News |date=29 January 2011 |accessdate=29 January 2011[/tpl] Accordingly, Cowen sought and received formal dissolution of the Dáil from President McAleese on Tuesday, 1 February,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0201/politics.html |title=LIVE – Dissolution of the 30th Dáil |work=RTE |date=1 February 2011[/tpl] and confirmed that the general election would take place on 25 February.Election date confirmed as 25 February breakingnews.ie, 1 February 2011. Cowen also announced that he would not contest his Dáil seat, but would retire from politics after 27 years.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2011/0201/1224288695881.html?digest=1 |title=Cowen calls time on his political career after 27 years |work=The Irish Times |date=1 February 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2011 |first=Deaglán |last=De Bréadún[/tpl] He was succeeded by a Fine Gael-Labour coalition led by Enda Kenny, which took power on 9 March 2011; because Cowen was no longer a TD when the new Dáil convened, he was unable to preside over the opening; Fianna Fáil Leader Micheál Martin and outgoing Finance Minister Brian Lenihan appeared on the government front bench in his stead.

Cowen is often referred to in Irish satirical and tabloid media as BIFFO, a nickname applied to people from Offaly.[ref]

 [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][/ref] BIFFO is an acronym for "Big Ignorant Fecker/Fucker[tpl]cite news |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/04/eu_referendum_will_be_cowens_f.html |title=EU referendum will be Cowen's first test |work=The Guardian politics blog |date=4 April 2008 |author=McDonald, Henry |accessdate=7 May 2008 |location=London[/tpl] From Offaly". Cowen has said that 'BIFFO' stands for "Beautiful Intelligent Fellow From Offaly'. An unnamed journalist described Cowen "as subtle as a JCB".[tpl]cite news |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/04/eu_referendum_will_be_cowens_f.html |title=EU referendum will be Cowen's first test |work=The Guardian politics blog |date=4 April 2008 |author=McDonald, Henry |accessdate=19 January 2010 |location=London[/tpl]
Wikileaks cables from Ireland to the US revealed, that US diplomats in Ireland reported that the nickname 'BIFFO' applied "especially well" to former Taoiseach Brian Cowen, as described in leaked US embassy dispatches.[tpl]cite web|author=Shane Phelan Investigative Correspondent – 01 June 2011 |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/wikileaks/biffo-nickname-suited-cowen-especially-well-said-us-envoy-2662657.html |title=BIFFO nickname suited Cowen 'especially well', said US envoy |publisher=Independent.ie |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=2013-06-27[/tpl]
In a candid profile from  Wikileaks, of Cowen as the  Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader, then US Ambassador Thomas Foley described  Cowen as "burly and brusque" saying that he had "a reputation of not being much concerned with his public image."
The ambassador also described Mr Cowen's fondness for frequenting pubs and singing,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j8F-9nmZ5I |title=An Taoiseach Brian Cowen Singing |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-27[/tpl] saying he would likely be more approachable than his predecessor Bertie Ahern.
Cowen was accused of 'conduct unbecoming', over comments he made in the Dáil when, at the end of a heated exchange, he sat down and spoke to Tánaiste Mary Coughlan; Dáil microphones picked up the Taoiseach using the word "fuckers", though he was not referring to any opposition politician.
He later apologised for his remark.
Cowen has been openly criticised by his parliamentary party colleagues including one who said in an interview that Cowen has suffered from "poor communications and consultation" and expressed concern about the emergence of a perceived "triumvirate" (comprising the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Finance) within the Cabinet.[tpl]cite news|author=O2 Ideas Room |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/cowen-faces-new-backbench-revolt-1566345.html |title=Cowen faces new backbench revolt |publisher=Independent.ie |date=7 December 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2010[/tpl]Kitt attacks Cowen leadership[tpl]dead link|date=June 2010[/tpl]

Cowen was criticised as being inept during the approach to the third budget, in December 2009. He said, "our priority is to stabilise the public finances", a year after the Irish public was told that this was the priority for 2008.[tpl]cite news|author=Festival guide |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/john-drennan/john-drennan-tattered-taoiseach-is-but-a-paltry-thing-1965628.html |title=John Drennan: Tattered Taoiseach is but a paltry thing |publisher=Independent.ie |date=6 December 2009 |accessdate=12 June 2010[/tpl]

===Approval ratings===

Although Cowen's satisfaction rating had sunk to 18% in Ireland by August 2010, he was listed as one of the top ten leaders in the world by Newsweek magazine, which praised his handling of the Irish economy. While The Wall Street Journal stated that "Cowen has presided over the worst economic crisis in modern times",Ireland Gasps after Newsweek Names PM One of Top 10 World Leaders The Wall Street Journal, 2010-08-20.

According to TheJournal.ie, Cowen was "the least popular incumbent in the history of Irish opinion polling," with approval between 8 and 10 percent of the electorate. As of January 2011, Fianna Fáil's popularity had fallen to a record low and was tied with Sinn Féin on 14% in joint third place.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/1202/politics.html |title=Poll sees Fianna Fáil support fall further |publisher=Rte.ie |date= 17 December 2010|accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Insurance |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/fg-tops-new-poll-at-35pc-while-ff-still-at-dismal-low-2488693.html |title=FG tops new poll at 35pc while FF still at dismal low |publisher=Independent.ie |date= 8 January 2011|accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl]

==Legacy==

Cowen became a leader of Fianna Fáil and Taoiseach without ever facing a general election in either capacity.  Under his stewardship of the country, his party Fianna Fáil, saw its electoral support base diminished by 75% in the
general election of February 2011, as a reaction to the intervention, in the running of the Irish economy, of the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank in November 2010.Angry electorate coldly voted to liquidate Fianna Fáil
Cowen was criticisedTaoiseach's failings as national leader may inflict most damage on FF at polls  for being a poor communicator and for his perceived failure to connect with the electorate.
Historian Diarmaid Ferriter described Cowen's "appalling communication skills and self-destructive stubbornness" as inflicting most damage to Fianna Fáil.
As the scale of the party's electoral defeat became evident, Cowen accepted responsibility for decisions taken in government.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/elections/latest-news/fianna-fail-pay-the-price-for-economic-collapse-2558427.html |title=Fianna Fail pay the price for economic collapse |publisher=Irish Independent|date=27 February 2011|accessdate=27 June 2013[/tpl] 
 From my point of view as Taoiseach and as minister in the past I take full responsibility. I've never quibbled or suggested otherwise.  
In November 2011, a review of Cowen's governance was broadcast[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/programmes/crisis_inside_the_cowen_government.html |title=Crisis: Inside the Cowen Government |publisher=RTÉ News|date= |accessdate=27 June 2013[/tpl] on RTÉ television over two episodes entitled Crisis: Inside the Cowen Government. Cowen did not contribute to the series, but many of his former ministerial colleagues critiqued his performance as Taoiseach
On 21 March 2012, Cowen delivered a speech at the BMW Center for German and European Studies at Georgetown University, Washington, DC, entitled "The Euro: From Crisis to Resolution? Some Reflections from Ireland on the Road Thus Far".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/gene-kerrigan/gene-kerrigan-mr-cowen-goes-to-washington-and-rewrites-history-26838408.html|title=Mr Cowen goes to Washington and rewrites history|date=1 April 2012|work=Irish Independent[/tpl] In his first public comments since leaving office, he defended his government's blanket bank guarantee in 2008,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2012/0327/world/cowen-breaks-silence-on-guarantee-188479.html|title=Cowen breaks silence on guarantee|date=27 March 2012|work=Irish Examiner[/tpl] but admitted that his government should have increased taxes and cut spending.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0326/315119-cowenb/|title=Brian Cowen admits govt should have increased taxes|date=27 March 2012|work=RTÉ News[/tpl] He also admitted that his government should accept some blame for Ireland's economic downfall.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Former-Irish-leader-Brian-Cowen-admits-blame-for-Irish-economic-collapse-144598605.html|title=Former Irish leader Brian Cowen admits blame for Irish economic collapse|date=28 March 2012|work=Irish Central[/tpl] He compared the start of the 2008 economic crisis to a series of plane crashes, all taking place at the same time and each for different reasons.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/cowen-compares-banking-crisis-to-multiple-plane-crashes-occurring-at-once-397366-Mar2012/|title=Cowen compares banking crisis to ‘multiple plane crashes occurring at once’|date=26 March 2012|work=TheJournal.ie[/tpl]
