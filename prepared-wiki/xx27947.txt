==Telephone==

Armenia has 2.8 million subscribers in total, or an 86% penetration rate.
There are three mobile telephone network operators currently in Armenia. Viva Cell MTS, Orange and Beeline. All three have up to 95% 2G coverage of the population and around 90% 3G coverage. All three networks are widely modern and reliable with shops located around the city where one can purchase a sim card if needed. Most unlocked mobile phones are able to be used on roaming however network charges apply. Orange and Viva Cell are often recommended to tourists due to the variety of tariffs available and the help available in a variety of languages.http://www.akep.al/images/stories/AKEP/statistika/Treguesit-Statistikore-6_Mujori-I-re-2011.pdf

3G service was announced by Beeline in the summer of 2008. VivaCell-MTS announced their service at the end of 2008. Both Viva Cell MTS and Beeline provide 3G in many towns and cities around Armenia including the largest ones, Gyumri, Vanadzor and the capital city, Yerevan. Orange, a recent newcomer to Armenia has a modern high quality 2G, 3G and 3G+ network which covers almost 90% of the population.

===International system===

Yerevan is connected to the Trans-Asia-Europe fiber-optic cable via Georgia. There is general plan to make better connection via Turkey, after opening Turkey-Armenian borders. Additional international service is available by microwave radio relay and landline connections to other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Moscow international switch and by satellite.
Main backbones of Armenian networks are made by E3 or STM-1 lines via microwave units across whole country with many passive retranslations.

===Dial-up===

A major way of connecting to the Internet used to be dial-up. This was caused by very high prices of Internet access, and only very few people could use other types of connections until Beeline, Vivacell MTS and Orange started selling portable USB-modems. The average price for one hour of dial-up Internet access was about 48 cents, plus 20 cents for using phone line (summary 68 cents per hour).[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Pearce|first=Katy|title=Armenian Media Landscape Formative Research for the Alternative Resources in Media Program|url=http://crrc.am/store/armedia/CRRC_ArMedia%20Survey%20Report_FINAL%20KP_edited.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2012[/tpl]

===Censorship===

Access to the Internet in Armenia is largely unfettered, although evidence of second- and third-generation filtering is mounting. Armenia’s political climate is volatile and largely unpredictable. In times of political unrest, the government has not hesitated to put in place restrictions on the Internet as a means to curtail public protest and discontent.
