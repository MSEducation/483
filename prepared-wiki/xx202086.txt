C. Hinrichs'sche Buchhandlung|location=Leipzig|page=34[/tpl] It is a Greek uncial manuscript of the New Testament, dated palaeographically to the 9th century. The manuscript has complex contents. It has marginalia and was prepared for liturgical (religious) use.
The text of the manuscript was held in high esteem by some 19th-century scholars, but this general opinion changed in the 20th century; as a result the manuscript is rarely cited in critical editions of the Greek New Testament.
