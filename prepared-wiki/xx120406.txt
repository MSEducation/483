[[Graded bedding]]

CATEGORIES: Sedimentology

In geology, a graded bed is one characterized by a systematic change in grain or clast size from the base of the bed to the top. Most commonly this takes the form of normal grading, with coarser sediments at the base, which grade upward into progressively finer ones.  Normally graded beds generally represent depositional environments which decrease in transport energy as time passes, but also form during rapid depositional events.   They are   perhaps best represented in turbidite strata, where they indicate a sudden strong current that deposits heavy, coarse sediments first, with finer ones following as the current weakens.  They can also form in terrestrial stream deposits.
In reverse or    inverse grading the bed coarsens upwards. This type of grading is relatively uncommon but is characteristic of sediments deposited by grain flow and debris flow.Tucker, M. 2003.

A favored explanation is kinetic sieving.http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/462/2067/947.full Time-dependent solutions for particle-size segregation in shallow granular avalanches, (2005)J.M.N.T Gray1*, M Shearer2 and A.R Thornton1
