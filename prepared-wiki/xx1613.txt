===Hydrography===

Most of Catalonia belongs to the Mediterranean Basin. The Catalan hydrographic network consists of two important basins, the one of the Ebro and the one that comprises the internal basins of Catalonia, all of them flow to the Mediterranean. Furthermore, there is the Garona river basin that flows to the Atlantic Ocean, but it only covers 1.7% of the Catalan territory.
The hydrographic network can be divided in two sectors, an occidental slope or Ebre river slope and one oriental slope constituted by minor rivers that flow to the Mediterranean along the Catalan coast. The first slope provides an average of [tpl]convert|18700|hm3|cumi|lk=on[/tpl] per year, while the second only provides an average of [tpl]convert|2020|hm3|cumi|abbr=on[/tpl]/year. The difference is due to the big contribution of the Ebre river, from which the Segre is an important tributary. Moreover, in Catalonia there is a relative wealth of groundwaters, although there is inequality between comarques, given the complex geological structure of the territory.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.enciclopedia.cat/enciclop%C3%A8dies/gran-enciclop%C3%A8dia-catalana/EC-GEC-0016439.xml |title=Catalunya: El clima i la hidrografia |language=catalán |work=l'Enciclopèdia |location=Barcelona |editor=Gran Enciclopedia Catalana[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] In the Pyrenees there are many small lakes, remnants of the ice age. The biggest is the one of Banyoles.
The Catalan coast is almost rectilinear, with a length over [tpl]convert|500|km[/tpl] and few landforms—the most relevant are the Cap de Creus and the Gulf of Roses to the north and the Ebre Delta to the south. The Catalan Coastal Range hugs the coastline, and it is split into two segments, one between L'Estartit and the town of Blanes (the Costa Brava), and the other at the south, at the Costes del Garraf.Catalunya.

The principal rivers in Catalonia are the Ter, Llobregat, and the Ebre, all of which run into the Mediterranean.

==Politics==

After Franco's death in 1975 and the adoption of a democratic constitution in Spain in 1978, Catalonia recovered and extended the powers that it had gained in the Statute of Autonomy of 1932[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/guia/antecedents/antecedents15.htm |title=Beginnings of the autonomous regime, 1918–1932 |publisher=Gencat.net |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl] but lost with the fall of the Second Spanish Republic[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/guia/antecedents/antecedents16.htm |title=The republican Government of Catalonia, 1931–1939 |publisher=Gencat.net |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl] at the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939.
The region has gradually achieved more autonomy since the approval of the Spanish Constitution of 1978. The Generalitat holds exclusive jurisdiction in culture, environment, communications, transportation, commerce, public safety and local government, and shares jurisdiction with the Spanish government in education, health and justice.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gencat.cat/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_4.htm |title=Title IV.

A relatively large sector of the population supports the ideas and policies of Catalan nationalism,[tpl]cite web |url=http://premsa.gencat.cat/pres_fsvp/docs/2012/06/27/10/36/60220d32-3dde-4bbe-bd32-e66085959a29.pdf |title=CEO Public Opinion Poll covering, among others, nationalist opinions |publisher=ceo.gencat.cat |accessdate=2012-10-12[/tpl] a political movement which defends the notion that Catalonia is a separate nation and advocates for either further political autonomy or full independence of Catalonia.
The support for Catalan nationalism ranges from a demand for further autonomy and the federalisation of Spain to the desire for independence from the rest of Spain, expressed by Catalan independentists. The first survey following the Constitutional Court ruling that cut back elements of the 2006 Statute of Autonomy, published by La Vanguardia on July 18, 2010, found that a majority would support independence in a referendum.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/politica/noticias/20100718/53967434806/el-fallo-del-tc-catapulta-el-respaldo-a-la-independencia-que-roza-el-50.html |title=La Vanguardia poll[/tpl] In February of the same year, a poll by the Open University of Catalonia gave more or less the same results.http://www.uoc.edu/portal/_resources/CA/documents/sala_premsa/noticies/Dossier_premsa_Diagnxstic_Catalunya-_Espanya.pdf

In hundreds of non-binding local referendums on independence, organised across Catalonia from 13 September 2009, a large majority voted for independence, although critics argued that the polls were mostly held in pro-independence areas.

Two major factors were Spain's Constitutional Court's 2010 decision to declare part of the  2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia unconstitutional, as well as the fact that Catalonia contributes 19.49% of the federal government’s tax revenue, but only receives 14.03% of federal spending.[tpl]cite news |last=Abend |first=Lisa |title=Spain Barcelona Warns Madrid: Pay Up, or Catalonia Leaves Spain |url=http://world.time.com/2012/09/11/barcelona-warns-madrid-pay-up-or-catalonia-leaves-spain/?xid=newsletter-weekly |publisher=TIME |accessdate=17 September 2012 |date=2012-09-11[/tpl]
Parties that consider themselves either Catalan nationalist or independentist have been present in all Catalan governments since 1980. The largest Catalan nationalist party, Convergence and Union, ruled Catalonia from 1980 to 2003, and returned to power in the 2010 election. Between 2003 and 2010, a leftist coalition, composed by the Catalan Socialists' Party, the pro-independence Republican Left of Catalonia and the leftist-environmentalist Initiative for Catalonia-Greens, implemented policies that widened Catalan autonomy.[tpl]cite book| author = Xavier Mir i Oliveras| title = Vostè Té Un Problema i Aquest Problema Es Diu PSC| url = http://books.google.com/?id=JKPZOz6t0TkC&pg=PA67| year = 2007| publisher = Lulu.com| isbn = 978-1-84799-752-4| page = 67 [/tpl]
In the November 25, 2012 Catalan parliamentary election, sovereigntist parties supporting a secession referendum gathered 59.01% of the votes and hold 87 of the 135 seats in the Catalan Parliament. Parties supporting independence from the rest of Spain obtained 49.12% of the votes and a majority of 74 seats.

===Statutes of Autonomy===

The Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia is the fundamental organic law, second only to the Spanish Constitution from which the Statute originates.
In the Spanish Constitution of 1978 Catalonia, along with the Basque Country and Galicia, was defined as a "nationality". The same constitution gave Catalonia the automatic right to autonomy, which resulted in the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 1979.
Both the 1979 Statute of Autonomy and the current one, approved in 2006, state that "Catalonia, as a nationality, exercises its self-government constituted as an Autonomous Community in accordance with the Constitution and with the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, which is its basic institutional law, always under the law in Spain".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a1 |title=First article of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalunya |publisher=Gencat.net |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl]
The Preamble of the 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia states that the Parliament of Catalonia has defined Catalonia as a nation, but that "the Spanish Constitution recognizes Catalonia's national reality as a nationality".Constitución Española, Título Preliminar.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2010[/tpl] While the Statute was approved by and sanctioned by both the Catalan and Spanish parliaments, and later by referendum in Catalonia, it has been subject to a legal challenge by the surrounding autonomous regions of Aragon, Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community,[tpl]cite web|author=Europa Press/Madrid |url=http://www.hoy.es/prensa/20061115/nacional/admitidos-recursos-aragon-valencia_20061115.html |title=Admitidos los recursos de Aragón, Valencia y Baleares contra el Estatuto catalán. |publisher=Hoy.es |date=1997-12-01 |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl] as well as by the conservative People's Party. The objections are based on various issues such as disputed cultural heritage but, especially, on the Statute's alleged breaches of the principle of "solidarity between regions" in fiscal and educational matters enshrined by the Constitution.[tpl]cite web |author=El País |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/anos/encarnizada/batalla/politica/elpepuesp/20100416elpepunac_26/Tes |title=Cuatro años de encarnizada batalla política. |publisher=El País |date=2010-06-29 |accessdate=2010-06-29[/tpl]
Spain's Constitutional Court assessed the disputed articles and on 28 June 2010, issued its judgment on the principal allegation of unconstitutionality presented by the People's Party in 2006. The judgment granted clear passage to 182 articles of the 223 that make up the fundamental text. The court approved 73 of the 114 articles that the People's Party had contested, while declaring 14 articles unconstitutional in whole or in part and imposing a restrictive interpretation on 27 others.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/retoque/74/articulos/recurridos/elpepunac/20100629elpepinac_4/Tes |title=Ni un retoque en 74 artículos recurridos |publisher=El País |accessdate=2010-06-29[/tpl] The court accepted the specific provision that described Catalonia as a "nation", however ruled that it was a historical and cultural term with no legal weight, and that Spain remained the only nation recognised by the constitution.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/news/Catalonia-39is-not-a-nation39.6412380.jp |title=Catalonia 'is not a nation' 10 July 2010 |publisher=News.scotsman.com |date= 2010-07-10|accessdate=2011-01-06 |location=Edinburgh[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.matthewbennett.es/60/is-catalonia-a-nation-or-a-nationality-or-is-spain-the-only-nation-in-spain/ |title=Is Catalonia a nation or a nationality, or is Spain the only nation in Spain? |publisher=Matthewbennett.es |accessdate=2011-01-06[/tpl][tpl]cite news |author=Fiona Govan in Madrid 1:59PM BST 29 Jun 2010 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/7861118/Catalonia-can-call-itself-a-nation-rules-Spains-top-court.html |title=Catalonia can call itself a 'nation', rules Spain's top court 29 Jun 2010 |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2010-06-29 |accessdate=2011-01-06 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16490065 |title=A nationality, not a nation Jul 1st 2010 |publisher=Economist.com |date= 2010-07-01|accessdate=2011-01-06[/tpl]

===Government and law===

The Catalan Statute of Autonomy establishes that Catalonia is organised politically through the Generalitat de Catalunya, conformed by the Parliament, the Presidency of the Generalitat, the Government or Executive Council and the other institutions created by the Parliament.
The seat of the Executive Council is the city of Barcelona. Since the restoration of the Generalitat on the return of democracy in Spain, the presidents of Catalonia have been Jordi Pujol (1980–2003), Pasqual Maragall (2003–2006), José Montilla Aguilera (2006–2010) and Artur Mas incumbent [tpl]as of|2010|lc=on[/tpl].

===Security forces===

Catalonia has its own police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, whose origins date back to the 18th century. Since 1980 they have been under the command of the Generalitat, and since 1994  they have expanded in number in order to replace the national Guardia Civil and Policía Nacional, which report directly to the Homeland Department of Spain. The national bodies retain personnel within Catalonia to exercise functions of national scope such as overseeing ports, airports, coasts, international borders, custom offices, the identification of documents and arms control amongst others.
Most of the justice system is administered by national judicial institutions. The criminal justice system is uniform throughout Spain, while "civil law" is administered separately within Catalonia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://civil.udg.es/normacivil/catalunya.htm |title=Legislació civil catalana |publisher=Civil.udg.es |date=2006-07-20 |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl]
Navarre, the Basque Country and Catalonia are the Spanish regions with the highest degree of autonomy in terms of law enforcement.

===Administrative and territorial division===

Catalonia is organised territorially into provinces, further subdivided into comarques and municipalities. The 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia establishes the administrative organisation of three local authorities: vegueries, comarques, and municipalities.

====Provinces====

Catalonia is divided administratively into four provinces, the governing body of which is the Diputació ([tpl]lang-es|Diputación[/tpl]). The four provinces and their populations are:[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.idescat.cat/territ/BasicTerr?TC=5&V0=5&V1=08&V3=863&V4=435&ALLINFO=TRUE&PARENT=1&GERMANS=TRUE&CTX=B |title=Padró municipal d'habitants.

====Municipalities====

There are at present 947 municipalities in Catalonia.

====Comarques====

Comarques (Shires) are entities composed by the municipalities to manage their responsibilities and services.  The current regional division has its roots in a decree of the Generalitat de Catalunya of 1936, in effect until 1939, when it was suppressed by Franco.  In 1987 the Government adopted the territorial division again and in 1988 three new comarques were added (Alta Ribagorça, Pla d'Urgell i Pla de l'Estany).  At present there are 41.
The comarca of Val d'Aran (Aran Valley) has a special status and its autonomous government is named Conselh Generau d'Aran.[tpl]cite web |url=http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/CCAA/ca-l16-1990.html# |title=Ley 16/1990, de 13 de julio, sobre el régimen especial del Valle de Arán. |author= |work= |publisher=Noticias Jurídicas |accessdate=20 July 2010[/tpl]

====Vegueries====

The vegueria is a new type of division defined as a specific territorial area for the exercise of government and inter-local cooperation with legal personality. The current Statute of Autonomy states vegueries are intended to supersede provinces in Catalonia, and take over many of functions of the comarques.
The territorial plan of Catalonia (Pla territorial general de Catalunya) provided six general functional areas,[tpl]cite web |title=Pla territorial general de Catalunya |url=http://www10.gencat.net/ptop/AppJava/cat/plans/general/ptgeneral.jsp |publisher=Generalitat de Catalunya |accessdate=20 July 2010[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] but was amended by Law 24/2001, of December 31, recognizing the Alt Pirineu i Aran as a new functional area differentiated of Ponent.Aprovació del Pla territorial parcial de l'Alt Pirineu i Aran.[tpl]dead link|date=January 2011[/tpl]  On 14 July 2010 the Catalan Parliament approved the creation of the functional area of the Penedès.[tpl]cite web |url=http://avui.elpunt.cat/noticia/article/3-politica/17-politica/195270.html |date=15 July 2010 |work=Avui |title=El Parlament reconeix l'àmbit funcional del Penedès[/tpl]

==Economy==

In 2008, the regional GDP of Catalonia was €216.9  billion ($314.4 billion), the highest in Spain, and per capita GDP was €28,750 – similar to that of countries such as the United Kingdom or Austria. It had the fourth per capita GDP in Spain, considerably behind the Basque Country (€34,100), Madrid (autonomous community) (€34,100) and Navarra (€32,900).Cidem.com[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl].Madrid, con una renta de 28.850 euros por habitante, se sitúa más de un 30 por ciento por encima de la media nacional Madrid tiene el PIB per cápita más alto de España.

==Demographics==

Catalonia covers an area of [tpl]convert|32114|km2|abbr=on[/tpl] with an official population of 7,354,411 (2008), of which non-Spanish immigrants represent about 19% according to the Spanish Statistics Institute (INE) for 2012.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ine.es/jaxi/menu.do?type=pcaxis&path=%2Ft20%2Fe260&file=inebase&L=0 |title=Instituto Nacional de Estadística, padrón por municipios, 2012|publisher=Ine.es |accessdate=2014-01-31[/tpl] About 66% of the population defines itself as Roman Catholic (45% non practicing, 18% practicing), 7% as Muslim, and 29% as atheist or agnostic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uaoceu.es/ca/recerca/catedres-i-instituts/institut-del-capital-social/estudis-i-publicacions-1/monografics/la-disminucio-del-sentit-religios-en-la-joventut-secularitzacio-o-desvinculacio |title=La disminucio del sentit religios en la joventut secularitzacio o desvinculacio |accessdate=2014-01-31[/tpl]

In 1900, the population of Catalonia was 1,984,115 people and in 1970 it was 5,107,606.Gencat.net. (in Catalan)[tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] That increase was due to the demographic boom in Spain during the 60s and early 70s and also to the large-scale internal migration from the rural interior of Spain to its industrial cities. In Catalonia that wave of internal migration arrived from several regions of Spain, especially Andalusia, Murcia and Extremadura.
Immigrants from other countries settled in Catalonia in the 1990s and 2000s; a large percentage came from Africa and Latin America, and smaller numbers from Asia and Eastern Europe, often settling in urban centers such as Barcelona and industrial areas.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl]

===Languages===

According to the most recent linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia [tpl]As of|2009|lc=on[/tpl], a plurality claims Spanish as "their own language" (46.53% Spanish compared to 37.26% Catalan). In everyday use, 11.95% of the population claim to use both languages equally, whereas 45.92% mainly use Spanish and 35.54% mainly use Catalan. There is a significant difference between the Barcelona metropolitan area (and, to a lesser extent, the Tarragona area), where Spanish is more spoken than Catalan, and the rest of Catalonia, where Catalan clearly prevails over Spanish.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.idescat.cat/dequavi/?TC=444&V0=15&V1=2 |title=Idescat.

Since the Statute of Autonomy of 1979, Aranese (a dialect of Gascon Occitan) has also been official and subject to special protection in Val d'Aran. This small area of 7,000 inhabitants was the only place where a dialect of Occitan has received full official status. Then, on 9 August 2006, when the new Statute came into force, Occitan became official throughout Catalonia. Occitan is the mother tongue of 22.4% of the population of Val d'Aran.Enquesta d'usos lingüístics de la població 2008, cap. 8. La Val d’Aran. Catalan Sign Language is also officially recognised.

The other languages with official status are Spanish, which has official status throughout Spain, and Aranese Occitan, which enjoys co-official status with Catalan and Spanish in the Val d'Aran.
Although not considered an "official language" in the same way as Catalan, Spanish, and Aranese, Catalan Sign Language, with about 18,000 users in Catalonia,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=csc |title=Ethnologue Report for Catalan Sign Language. Usage population as of 1994 |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date=1999-02-19 |accessdate=2014-02-01[/tpl] is granted official recognition and support: "The public authorities shall guarantee the use of Catalan sign language and conditions of equality for deaf people who choose to use this language, which shall be the subject of education, protection and respect."
Under the Franco dictatorship, Catalan was excluded from the public education system and all other official use, so that for example families were not allowed to officially register children with Catalan names.[tpl]cite book| author = Joan Miralles i Montserrat| coauthors = Josep Massot i Muntaner| title = Entorn de la histáoria de la llengua| year = 2001| publisher = L'Abadia de Montserrat| isbn = 978-84-8415-309-2| page = 72 [/tpl] Although never completely banned, Catalan language publishing was severely restricted during the early 1940s, with only religious texts and small-run self-published texts being released. Some books were published clandestinely or circumvented the restrictions by showing publishing dates prior to 1936.[tpl]cite book| author = Pelai Pagès i Blanch| title = Franquisme i repressió: la repressió franquista als països catalans 1939–1975| url = http://books.google.com/?id=OWDyyyaL7dMC&pg=PA182| accessdate = 2011-01-06| year = 2004| publisher = Universitat de València| isbn = 978-84-370-5924-2 [/tpl] This policy was changed in 1946, when unrestricted publishing in Catalan resumed.[tpl]cite book| author = Pelai Pagès i Blanch| title = Franquisme i repressió: la repressió franquista als països catalans (1939–1975)| url = http://books.google.com/?id=OWDyyyaL7dMC&pg=PA182| year = 2004| publisher = Universitat de València| isbn = 978-84-370-5924-2 [/tpl]
Rural–urban migration originating in other parts of Spain also reduced the social use of Catalan in urban areas and increased the use of Spanish. Lately, a similar sociolinguistic phenomenon has occurred with foreign immigration. Catalan cultural activity increased in the 1960s and Catalan classes began thanks to the initiative of associations such as Òmnium Cultural.
After the end of Franco's dictatorship, the newly established self-governing democratic institutions in Catalonia embarked on a long-term language policy to increase the use of Catalan[tpl]cite book| author = M.

This policy, known as the "linguistic normalisation" (normalització lingüística in Catalan, normalización lingüística in Spanish) has been supported by the vast majority of Catalan political parties through the last thirty years. Some groups consider these efforts a way to discourage the use of Spanish,[tpl]cite web |author=Belen Parra |url=http://medios.mugak.eu/noticias/noticia/150764 |title=Diario El Mundo, Spanish Only |publisher=Medios.mugak.eu |date=2008-06-05 |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.elimparcial.es/contenido/19605.html |title=Diario El Imparcial, Spanish Only |publisher=Elimparcial.es |date=2008-07-26 |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://blogs.periodistadigital.com/ultimahora.php/2006/06/17/llaman_lputo_inmigrante_espanolr_al_padr |title=Diario Periodista Digital, Spanish Only |publisher=Blogs.periodistadigital.com |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://blogs.periodistadigital.com/ultimahora.php/2006/02/02/la_justicia_obliga_a_una_escuela_de_bada |title=Diario Periodista Digital, Spanish Only |publisher=Blogs.periodistadigital.com |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] whereas some others, including the Catalan governmentPage 13: Catalan Deputy of Education Ernest Maragall declares respect from the Catalan Government to Spanish language and to everyone's rights (in Calatan) and the European UnionEU takes Basque Country, Galicia, Catalonia and Valencia as examples of bilingualism.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2010[/tpl] consider the policies respectful,The President Montilla promises to look after the use and respect both for Spanish and Catalan languages or even as an example which "should be disseminated throughout the Union".[tpl]cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/publ/pdf/language/highreport_en.pdf |title=High Level Group on Multilingualism – Final Report: from the Commission of the European Communities in which Catalan immersion is taken as an example which "should be disseminated throughout the Union" (page 18). |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]
Today, Catalan is the main language of the Catalan autonomous government and the other public institutions that fall under its jurisdiction. Basic public education is given in Catalan, except for two hours per week of Spanish medium instruction. Businesses are required to display all information (e.g. menus, posters) in Catalan under penalty of fines. There is no obligation to display this information in either Occitan or Spanish, although there is no restriction on doing so in these or other languages. The use of fines was introduced in a 1997 linguistic law[tpl]cite web |url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Llengcat/menuitem.df5fba67cac781e7a129d410b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=d287f9465ff61110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=d287f9465ff61110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default&newLang=en_GB |title=Catalonia's linguistic law |publisher=0.gencat.cat |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl] that aims to increase the public use of Catalan and defend the rights of Catalan speakers.
The law ensures that both Catalan and Spanish – being official languages – can be used by the citizens without prejudice in all public and private activities,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Llengcat/menuitem.21576464db9e81e7a129d410b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=d287f9465ff61110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=d287f9465ff61110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=detall&contentid=bc1f657030672110VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD |title=Second article of Catalonia's linguistic law |publisher=0.gencat.cat |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl] but primary education can only be taken in Catalan language. The Generalitat uses Catalan in its communications and notifications addressed to the general population, but citizens can also receive information from the Generalitat in Spanish if they so desire.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Llengcat/menuitem.21576464db9e81e7a129d410b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=d287f9465ff61110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=d287f9465ff61110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=detall&contentid=7368c3eea7672110VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD |title=Ninth article of Catalonia's Linguistic Law |publisher=0.gencat.cat |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl] Debates in the Catalan Parliament take place almost exclusively in Catalan and the Catalan public television broadcasts programs only in Catalan.
Due to the intense immigration which Spain in general and Catalonia in particular experienced in the first decade of the 21st century, many foreign languages are spoken in various cultural communities in Catalonia, of which Rif-Berber,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ub.edu/cusc/revista/lsc/hemeroteca/numero8/articles/comellas.pdf |title=DESCOBRIR LES LLENGÜES DE LA IMMIGRACIÓ |publisher=University of Barcelona |accessdate=2012-10-06[/tpl]  Moroccan Arabic, Romanian[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2010[/tpl] and Urdu are the more common.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.europapress.es/cultura/noticia-catalunya-arabe-urdu-aparecen-lenguas-habituales-catalunya-creando-peligro-guetos-20090629150020.html |title=Árabe y urdu aparecen entre las lenguas habituales de Catalunya, creando peligro de guetos. |publisher=Europapress.es |date=2009-06-29 |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl]
Recently, some of these policies have been criticised for trying to promote Catalan by imposing fines on businesses. For example, following the passage of a March 2010 law on Catalan cinema, which establishes that half of the movies shown in Catalan cinemas must be in Catalan, a general strike of 75% of the cinemas took place.[tpl]cite web |author=by Louis @ |url=http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/article/32923/catalan-cinema-dubbing-protest-law.html |title=Cinema law: rude case to not dub and subtitle all films in Catalan |publisher=Cafebabel.co.uk |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl] These criticisms mostly come from outside Catalonia, especially from conservative, conservative liberal  and classical liberal circles of Spanish society. In Catalonia, on the other hand, there is a high social and political consensus on the language policies favoring Catalan, also among Spanish speakers and speakers of other languages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.presencia.cat/noticia/article/2-societat/5-societat/349929-els-nous-catalanoparlants-a-favor-de-la-immersio-lingueistica.html |title=Presència |publisher=Presencia.cat |date=2014-01-26 |accessdate=2014-01-31[/tpl]http://www.asabadell.cat/ca/notices/2010/04/els_nous_catalanoparlants_defensen_la_llengua_catalana_8694.php[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.normalitzacio.cat/noticia/index.php?sec=noticia&n=17756 |title=normalitzacio.cat |publisher=normalitzacio.cat |accessdate=2014-01-31[/tpl][tpl]cite book| author = Joan Albert Argenter| coauthors = Institut d'Estudis Catalans.

In Catalonia, the Catalan language policy has been challenged by some anti-nationalist intellectuals like Albert Boadella. Since 2006, the liberal Citizens - Party of the Citizenry has been one of the most consistent critics of the Catalan language policy within Catalonia. The local Catalan branch of the People's Party has a more ambiguous position on the issue: on one hand, it demands a bilingual Catalan–Spanish education and a more balanced language policy that would defend Catalan without favoring it over Spanish,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y3yT9t_IDA |title=Alicia Sánchez-Camacho responde en 'Tengo una pregunta para usted' |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-11-11 |accessdate=2014-01-31[/tpl] whereas on the other hand, a few local PP politicians have supported in their municipalities measures privileging Catalan over Spanish[tpl]cite web|author=Regió7 |url=http://www.regio7.cat/arreu-catalunya-espanya-mon/2010/10/28/ppc-votar-favor-dun-reglament-sobre-catala/110435.html |title=El PPC va votar a favor d´un reglament sobre el català - Regió7 :: El Diari de la Catalunya Central |publisher=Regio7.cat |accessdate=2014-01-31[/tpl] and it has defended some aspects of the official language policies, sometimes against the positions of its colleagues from other parts of Spain.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.3cat24.cat/noticia/889146/barcelones/Sanchez-Camacho-rebutja-la-postura-inicial-de-Bauza-de-derogar-la-llei-de-Normalitzacio-Linguistica-a-les-Illes-Balears |title=Sánchez-Camacho rebutja la postura inicial de Bauzá de derogar la llei de Normalització Lingüística a les Illes Balears |publisher=3cat24.cat |accessdate=2014-01-31[/tpl]

==Transport==

===Airports===

Airports in Catalonia are owned and operated by Aena (a Spanish Government entity) except two airports in Lleida which are operated by Aeroports de Catalunya (an entity belonging to the Government of Catalonia).

===Commercial and passenger ports===

The two main commercial and passenger ports in Catalonia are owned and operated by Puertos del Estado (a Spanish Government entity).

===Roads===

There are [tpl]convert|12000|km[/tpl] of roads throughout Catalonia.
The principal highways are  AP-7  (Autopista del Mediterrani) and  A-7  (Autovia del Mediterrani). It follows the coast from the French border to Valencia, Murcia and Andalusia. The main roads generally radiate from Barcelona.  The A-2 and AP-2 connect inland and onward to Madrid.
Other major roads are:
Public-own roads in Catalonia are either managed by the autonomous government of Catalonia (e.g.,  C-  roads) or the Spanish Government (e.g.,  AP- ,  A- ,  N-  roads).

===Railways===

Catalonia saw the first railway construction in the Iberian Peninsula in 1848, linking Barcelona with Mataró. Given the topography most lines radiate from Barcelona.  The city has both suburban and inter-city services.  The main east coast line runs through the province connecting with the SNCF (French Railways) at Portbou on the coast.
There are two publicly owned railway companies operating in Catalonia: the Catalan FGC that operates commuter and regional services, and the Spanish national RENFE that operates long-distance and high-speed rail services (AVE and Avant).
High-speed rail (AVE) services from Madrid currently reach Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona. The official opening between Barcelona and Madrid took place 20 February 2008. The journey between Barcelona and Madrid now takes about two-and-a-half hours. A connection to the French high-speed TGV network has been completed, but is awaiting the completion of stations along the route to begin passenger service in April 2013.  This new line (currently the LGV Perpignan- Figueres Vilafant) passes through Girona and Figueres with a tunnel through the Pyrenees. There is a direct train from Barcelona Estació de França to Paris Austerlitz along the older railway tracks.

==Culture==

===Symbols of Catalonia===

Catalonia has its own representative and distinctive symbols such as:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gencat.net/generalitat/eng/estatut/titol_preliminar.htm#a8 |title=Statute of Catalonia (Article 8) |publisher=Gencat.net |accessdate=2010-04-25[/tpl]

===UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Catalonia===

There are several UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Catalonia:

===Popular culture===

Castells are one of the main manifestations of Catalan popular culture. The activity consists in constructing human towers by competing colles castelleres (teams). This practice originated in the southern part of Catalonia during the 18th century. The tradition of els Castells i els Castellers was declared Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2010.
The sardana is the most characteristic Catalan popular dance, other groups also practice Ball de bastons, moixiganga, galops or jota in the southern part. Musically, the Havaneres are also characteristic in some marine localities of the Costa Brava especially during the summer months when these songs are sung outdoors accompanied by a cremat of burned rum. Other music styles are Catalan rumba, Catalan rock and Nova Cançó.
In the greater celebrations other elements of the Catalan popular culture are usually present: the parades of gegants (giants) and correfocs of devils and firecrackers. Another traditional celebration in Catalonia is La Patum de Berga declared Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 25 November 2005.Patum de Berga.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2010[/tpl]
In addition to traditional local Catalan culture, traditions from other parts of Spain can be found as a result of migration from other regions. On July 28, 2010, Catalonia became the second Spanish territory, after the Canary Islands, to forbid bullfighting. The ban, which went into effect on January 1, 2012, had originated in a popular petition supported by over 180,000 signatures.The Press Association: Catalonia votes to ban bullfighting, 28 July 2010.[tpl]dead link|date=January 2011[/tpl]
