Magnesium is a chemical element with the symbol Mg and atomic number 12. Its common oxidation number is +2. It is an alkaline earth metal and the eighth-most-abundant element in the Earth's crust and ninth in the known universe as a whole.[tpl]Housecroft3rd|pages=305–306[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last = Ash|first = Russell|title = The Top 10 of Everything 2006: The Ultimate Book of Lists|publisher = Dk Pub|year = 2005|url = http://plymouthlibrary.org/faqelements.htm|isbn = 0-7566-1321-3[/tpl] Magnesium is the fourth-most-common element in the Earth as a whole (behind iron, oxygen and silicon), making up 13% of the planet's mass and a large fraction of the planet's mantle. The relative abundance of magnesium is related to the fact that it easily builds up in supernova stars from a sequential addition of three helium nuclei to carbon (which in turn is made from three helium nuclei).[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl] Due to magnesium ion's high solubility in water, it is the third-most-abundant element dissolved in seawater.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.seafriends.org.nz/oceano/seawater.htm#composition|title=The chemical composition of seawater|author=Anthoni, J Floor|year=2006[/tpl] Magnesium is produced in stars larger than 3 solar masses by fusing helium and neon in the alpha process at temperatures above 600 megakelvins.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2013[/tpl]
The free element (metal) is not found naturally on Earth, as it is highly reactive (though once produced, it is coated in a thin layer of oxide (see passivation), which partly masks this reactivity). The free metal burns with a characteristic brilliant-white light, making it a useful ingredient in flares. The metal is now obtained mainly by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine. In commerce, the chief use for the metal is as an alloying agent to make aluminium-magnesium alloys, sometimes called magnalium or magnelium. Since magnesium is less dense than aluminium, these alloys are prized for their relative lightness and strength.
In human biology, magnesium is the eleventh-most-abundant element by mass in the human body. Its ions are essential to all living cells, where they play a major role in manipulating important biological polyphosphate compounds like ATP, DNA, and RNA. Hundreds of enzymes, thus, require magnesium ions to function.  Magnesium compounds are used medicinally as common laxatives, antacids (e.g., milk of magnesia), and in a number of situations where stabilization of abnormal nerve excitation and blood vessel spasm is required (e.g., to treat eclampsia). Magnesium ions are sour to the taste, and in low concentrations they help to impart a natural tartness to fresh mineral waters.
In vegetation, magnesium is the metallic ion at the center of chlorophyll, and is, thus, a common additive to fertilizers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mg12.info|title=Magnesium in health|publisher=magnesium.com |accessdate=2013-10-10[/tpl]

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===

Elemental magnesium is a rather strong, silvery-white, light-weight metal (two-thirds the density of aluminium). It tarnishes slightly when exposed to air, although, unlike the alkali metals, an oxygen-free environment is unnecessary for storage because magnesium is protected by a thin layer of oxide that is fairly impermeable and difficult to remove.
Like its lower periodic table group neighbor calcium, magnesium reacts with water at room temperature, though it reacts much more slowly than calcium. When submerged in water, hydrogen bubbles almost unnoticeably begin to form on the surface of the metal—though, if powdered, it reacts much more rapidly. The reaction occurs faster with higher temperatures (see precautions). Magnesium's ability to react with water can be harnessed to produce energy and run a magnesium-based engine. Magnesium also reacts exothermically with most acids, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl). As with aluminium, zinc, and many other metals, the reaction with HCl produces the chloride of the metal and releases hydrogen gas.

===Chemical properties===

Magnesium is a highly flammable metal, but, while it is easy to ignite when powdered or shaved into thin strips, it is difficult to ignite in mass or bulk. Once ignited, it is difficult to extinguish, being able to burn in nitrogen (forming magnesium nitride), carbon dioxide (forming magnesium oxide, and carbon) and water (forming magnesium oxide and hydrogen). This property was used in incendiary weapons used in the firebombing of cities in World War II, the only practical civil defense being to smother a burning flare under dry sand to exclude the atmosphere. On burning in air, magnesium produces a brilliant-white light that includes strong ultraviolet. Thus, magnesium powder (flash powder) was used as a source of illumination in the early days of photography. Later, magnesium ribbon was used in electrically ignited flashbulbs. Magnesium powder is used in the manufacture of fireworks and marine flares where a brilliant white light is required. Flame temperatures of magnesium and magnesium alloys can reach [tpl]convert|3100|°C|K °F|abbr=on[/tpl],[tpl]cite journal|title=Condensed-phase modifications in magnesium particle combustion in air|author=Dreizin, Edward L.; Berman, Charles H. and Vicenzi, Edward P.|journal=Scripta Materialia|volume=122|doi=10.1016/S0010-2180(00)00101-2|year=2000|pages=30–42[/tpl] although flame height above the burning metal is usually less than [tpl]convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl]. Magnesium may be used as an ignition source for thermite, a mixture of aluminium and iron oxide powder that is otherwise difficult to ignite. Those properties are due to magnesium's high specific heat, the fourth-highest specific heat among the metals.
Magnesium compounds are typically white crystals. Most are soluble in water, providing the sour-tasting magnesium ion Mg2+. Small amounts of dissolved magnesium ion contribute to the tartness and taste of natural waters. Magnesium ion in large amounts is an ionic laxative, and magnesium sulfate (common name: Epsom salt) is sometimes used for this purpose. So-called "milk of magnesia" is a water suspension of one of the few insoluble magnesium compounds, magnesium hydroxide. The undissolved particles give rise to its appearance and name. Milk of magnesia is a mild base commonly used as an antacid, which has some laxative side-effect.

===Occurrence===

Magnesium is the eighth-most-abundant element in the Earth's crust by mass and tied in seventh place with iron in terms of molarity.[tpl]cite journal |title=Abundance and form of the most abundant elements in Earth's continental crust |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-02-15|url=http://www.gly.uga.edu/railsback/Fundamentals/ElementalAbundanceTableP.pdf[/tpl] It is found in large deposits of magnesite, dolomite, and other minerals, and in mineral waters, where magnesium ion is soluble.
Although magnesium is found in over 60 minerals, only dolomite, magnesite, brucite, carnallite, talc, and olivine are of commercial importance.
The [tpl]chem|Mg|2+[/tpl] cation is the second-most-abundant cation in seawater (occurring at about 12% of the mass of sodium there), which makes seawater and sea-salt an attractive commercial source of Mg. To extract the magnesium, calcium hydroxide is added to seawater to form magnesium hydroxide precipitate.
Magnesium hydroxide (brucite) is insoluble in water, so it can be filtered out and reacted with hydrochloric acid to obtain concentrated magnesium chloride.
From magnesium chloride, electrolysis produces magnesium.

==Forms==

===Alloy===

As of 2013, magnesium alloy consumption is less than a million tons per year, compared with 50 million tons of aluminum alloys. Its use has been historically limited by its tendency to corrode, high-temperature creep, and flammability.
Research and development eliminated magnesium's tendency toward high-temperature creep by inclusion of scandium and gadolinium. Flammability was greatly reduced by introducing a small amount of calcium into the mix.
The presence of iron, nickel, copper, and cobalt strongly activates corrosion. This is due to their low solid solubility limits (above a very small percentage, they precipitate out as intermetallic compounds) and because they behave as active cathodic sites that reduce water and cause the loss of magnesium.
Reducing the quantity of these metals improves corrosion resistance. Sufficient manganese overcomes the corrosive effects of iron. This requires precise control over composition, increasing costs.
Adding a cathodic poison captures atomic hydrogen within the structure of a metal. This prevents the formation of free hydrogen gas, which is required for corrosive chemical processes. The addition of about one-third of a percent of arsenic reduces its corrosion rate in a salt solution by a factor of nearly ten.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/stainless-magnesium-corrosion-monash/28856 |title=Stainless magnesium breakthrough bodes well for manufacturing industries |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-29[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.elecom.2013.07.021[/tpl]

===Compounds===

Magnesium forms a variety of industrially and biologically important compounds, including magnesium oxide, various salts, and others.

===Isotopes===

Magnesium has three stable isotopes: 24Mg, 25Mg and 26Mg. All are present in significant amounts (see table of isotopes above). About 79% of Mg is 24Mg. The isotope 28Mg is radioactive and in the 1950s to 1970s was made commercially by several nuclear power plants for use in scientific experiments. This isotope has a relatively short half-life (21 hours) and so its use was limited by shipping times.
26Mg has found application in isotopic geology, similar to that of aluminium. 26Mg is a radiogenic daughter product of 26Al, which has a half-life of 717,000 years. Large enrichments of stable 26Mg have been observed in the Ca-Al-rich inclusions of some carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. The anomalous abundance of 26Mg is attributed to the decay of its parent 26Al in the inclusions. Therefore, the meteorite must have formed in the solar nebula before the 26Al had decayed. Hence, these fragments are among the oldest objects in the solar system and have preserved information about its early history.
It is conventional to plot 26Mg/24Mg against an Al/Mg ratio. In an isochron dating plot, the Al/Mg ratio plotted is27Al/24Mg. The slope of the isochron has no age significance, but indicates the initial 26Al/27Al ratio in the sample at the time when the systems were separated from a common reservoir.

==Production==

China is the dominant supplier of magnesium, with approximately 80% of the world market share. China is almost completely reliant on the silicothermic Pidgeon process (the reduction of the oxide at high temperatures with silicon) to obtain the metal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chinamagnesiumcorporation.com/our-business/magnesium-overview| publisher=China magnesium Corporation| title=Magnesium Overview|accessdate=2013-05-08[/tpl]
In the United States, magnesium is obtained principally by electrolysis of fused magnesium chloride from brines, wells, and sea water. At the cathode, the [tpl]chem|Mg|2+[/tpl] ion is reduced by two electrons to magnesium metal:
At the anode, each pair of [tpl]chem|Cl|-[/tpl] ions is oxidized to chlorine gas, releasing two electrons to complete the circuit:
A new process, solid oxide membrane technology, involves the electrolytic reduction of MgO. At the cathode, [tpl]chem|Mg|2+[/tpl] ion is reduced by two electrons to magnesium metal. The electrolyte is Yttria-stabilized zirconia(YSZ). The anode is a liquid metal. At the YSZ/liquid metal anode [tpl]chem|O|2-[/tpl] is oxidized. A layer of graphite borders the liquid metal anode, and at this interface carbon and oxygen react to form carbon monoxide. When silver is used as the liquid metal anode, there is no reductant carbon or hydrogen needed, and only oxygen gas is evolved at the anode.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Pal|first1=Uday B. |last2=Powell|first2=Adam C.|title=The Use of Solid-Oxide-Membrane Technology for Electrometallurgy|year=2007|publisher=JOM|bibcode=2007JOM....59e..44P|volume=59|page=44|journal=JOM|doi=10.1007/s11837-007-0064-x|issue=5[/tpl] It has been reported that this method provides a 40% reduction in cost per pound over the electrolytic reduction method.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/pdfs/merit_review_2011/lightweight_materials/lm035_derezinski_2011_o.pdf|publisher=MOxST| title=Solid Oxide Membrane (SOM) Electrolysis of Magnesium: Scale-Up Research and Engineering for Light-Weight Vehicles |first=Steve| last=Derezinski |date=May 12, 2011| accessdate=2013-05-27[/tpl] This method is more environmentally sound than others because there is much less carbon dioxide emitted.
The United States has traditionally been the major world supplier of this metal, supplying 45% of world production even as recently as 1995. Today, the US market share is at 7%, with a single domestic producer left, US Magnesium, a Renco Group company in Utah born from now-defunct Magcorp.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0722/044_print.html| publisher=Forbes.com| title=Man With Many Enemies| first=Nathan| last= Vardi |date=February 22, 2007|accessdate=2006-06-26[/tpl]

==History==

The name magnesium originates from the Greek word for a district in Thessaly called Magnesia. It is related to magnetite and manganese, which also originated from this area, and required differentiation as separate substances. See manganese for this history.
In 1618, a farmer at Epsom in England attempted to give his cows water from a well there. The cows refused to drink because of the water's bitter taste, but the farmer noticed that the water seemed to heal scratches and rashes. The substance became known as Epsom salts and its fame spread. It was eventually recognized as hydrated magnesium sulfate, MgSO4·7[tpl]hsp[/tpl]H2O.
The metal itself was first produced by Sir Humphry Davy in England in 1808. He used electrolysis on a mixture of magnesia and mercuric oxide.[tpl]cite journal| last = Davy | first = H. | year= 1808 | title =  Electro-chemical researches on the decomposition of the earths; with observations on the metals obtained from the alkaline earths, and on the amalgam procured from ammonia | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 98 | pages = 333–370|bibcode = 1808RSPT...98..333D | jstor=107302 | doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0023| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&pg=102#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl] Antoine Bussy prepared it in coherent form in 1831. Davy's first suggestion for a name was magnium, but the name magnesium is now used.

==Applications==

===As metal===

Magnesium is the third-most-commonly-used structural metal, following iron and aluminium. It has been called the lightest useful metal by The Periodic Table of Videos.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.periodicvideos.com/videos/012.htm|title = Magnesium Video – The Periodic Table of Videos – University of Nottingham|accessdate=2011-02-23[/tpl]

Historically, magnesium was one of the main aerospace construction metals and was used for German military aircraft as early as World War I and extensively for German aircraft in World War II.
The Germans coined the name 'Elektron' for magnesium alloy. The term is still used today. The application of magnesium in the commercial aerospace industry was generally restricted to engine related components, due either to perceived hazards with magnesium parts in the event of fire or to corrosion. Currently, the use of magnesium alloys in aerospace is increasing, mostly driven by the increasing importance of fuel economy and the need to reduce weight.[tpl]cite journal |doi= 10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.350-351.19 |title= Magnesium Alloys Development towards the 21st Century |year= 2000 |last1= Aghion |first1= E. |last2= Bronfin |first2= B. |journal= Materials Science Forum |volume= 350-351 |pages= 19[/tpl] The development and testing of new magnesium alloys continues, notably Elektron 21, which has successfully undergone extensive aerospace testing for suitability in engine and internal and airframe components.[tpl]cite book|last1=Bronfin|first1=B|last2=et al.|first2=|editor=Kainer, Karl|title=Magnesium: Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Magnesium Alloys and Their Applications|year=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=Weinheim, Germany|isbn=978-3-527-31764-6|page=23|chapter=Elektron 21 specification[/tpl] The European Community runs three R&D magnesium projects in the Aerospace priority of Six Framework Program.

====Automotive====

Both AJ62A and AE44 are recent developments in high-temperature low creep magnesium alloys. The general strategy for such alloys is to form intermetallic precipitates at the grain boundaries, for example by adding mischmetal or calcium.[tpl]cite journal |title=Tensile and Compressive Creep of Magnesium-Aluminum-Calcium Based Alloys |format=PDF |year=2001 |author=Luo, Alan A. and Powell, Bob R. |publisher=Materials & Processes Laboratory, General Motors Research & Development Center |accessdate=2007-08-21 |url=http://doc.tms.org/ezmerchant/prodtms.nsf/productlookupitemid/01-481x-137/%24FILE/01-481X-137F.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070928023445/http://doc.tms.org/ezmerchant/prodtms.nsf/productlookupitemid/01-481x-137/$FILE/01-481X-137F.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 [/tpl] New alloy development and lower costs that make magnesium competitive with aluminium will increase the number of automotive applications.

====Electronics====

Because of low weight and good mechanical and electrical properties, magnesium is widely used for manufacturing of mobile phones, laptop and tablet computers, cameras, and other electronic components.

====Niche uses of the metal====

Magnesium, being readily available and relatively nontoxic, has a variety of uses:

Other uses include flash photography, flares, pyrotechnics, and fireworks sparklers. Magnesium is also often used to ignite thermite, or other materials that require a high ignition temperature.thumb|Magnesium firestarter (in left hand), used with a pocket knife and flint to create sparks that ignite the shavings

===In compounds===

Magnesium compounds, primarily magnesium oxide (MgO), are used as a refractory material in furnace linings for producing iron, steel, nonferrous metals, glass, and cement.  Magnesium oxide and other magnesium compounds are also used in the agricultural, chemical, and construction industries. Magnesium oxide from calcination is used as an electrical insulator in fire-resistant cables.[tpl]cite book|last=Linsley|first=Trevor|title=Basic Electrical Installation Work|isbn=978-0-08-096628-1|page=362|chapter=Properties of conductors and insulators[/tpl]
Magnesium reacted with an alkyl halide gives a Grignard reagent, which is a very useful tool for preparing alcohols.
Magnesium salts are frequently included in various foods, fertilizers (magnesium is a component of chlorophyll), and culture media.
Magnesium sulfite is used in the manufacture of paper (sulfite process).
Magnesium phosphate is used to fireproof wood used in construction.
Magnesium hexafluorosilicate is used in mothproofing of textiles.
In the form of turnings or ribbons, Mg is useful in purification of solvents, for example the preparation of super-dry ethanol.

====Biological====

Pharmaceutical preparations of magnesium are used to treat magnesium deficiency and hypomagnesemia, as well as eclampsia.[tpl]cite doi|10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.527788[/tpl] Usually in lower dosages, magnesium is commonly included in dietary mineral preparations, including many multivitamin preparations.
Sorted by type of magnesium salt, biological applications of magnesium include:

==Biological roles==

Because of the important interaction between phosphate and magnesium ions, magnesium ions are essential to the basic nucleic acid chemistry of life, and thus are essential to all cells of all known living organisms. Over 300 enzymes require the presence of magnesium ions for their catalytic action, including all enzymes utilizing or synthesizing ATP, or those that use other nucleotides to synthesize DNA and RNA. ATP exists in cells normally as a chelate of ATP and a magnesium ion.
Plants have an additional use for magnesium in that chlorophylls are magnesium-centered porphyrins. Magnesium deficiency in plants causes late-season yellowing between leaf veins, especially in older leaves, and can be corrected by applying Epsom salts (which is rapidly leached), or else crushed dolomitic limestone to the soil.
Magnesium is a vital component of a healthy human diet. Human magnesium deficiency (including conditions that show few overt symptoms) is relatively rare[tpl]cite web|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/magnesium |title=Magnesium |publisher=Ods.od.nih.gov |date=2009-07-13 |accessdate=2011-11-04[/tpl] although only 32% of people in the United States meet the RDA-DRI;[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/may04/energy0504.htm?pf=1|title = Lack Energy?

Taken in the proper amount, magnesium plays a role in preventing both stroke and heart attack.  The symptoms of people with fibromyalgia, migraines, and premenstrual syndrome are less severe, and magnesium can shorten the length of the migraine symptoms.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/magnesium-000313.htm|title = Magnesium|publisher = University of Maryland Medical Center[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author = Larsson SC, Virtanen MJ, Mars M, Männistö S, Pietinen P, Albanes D, Virtamo J|title= Magnesium, calcium, potassium, and sodium intakes and risk of stroke in male smokers|journal = Arch.

Adult human bodies contain about 24 grams of magnesium, with 60% in the skeleton, 39% intracellular (20% in skeletal muscle), and 1% extracellular.[tpl]cite web|title=Dietary Supplement Fact Sheet:Magnesium|url=http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/|publisher=US National Institute of Health[/tpl] Serum levels are typically 0.7–1.0 mmol/L or 1.8–2.4 mEq/L. Serum magnesium levels may appear normal even in cases of underlying intracellular deficiency, although no known mechanism maintains a homeostatic level in the blood other than renal excretion of high blood levels.
Intracellular magnesium is correlated with intracellular potassium. Magnesium is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, with more absorbed when status is lower. Magnesium competes with calcium in the human body,[tpl]cite web|url=http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/magnesium |title=Magnesium | University of Maryland Medical Center |publisher=Umm.edu |date=2013-05-07 |accessdate=2013-09-19[/tpl] in this way it actually keeps calcium in check.

In addition to its therapeutic role, magnesium improves calcification. Patients with chronic kidney disease have a high prevalence of vascular calcification, and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in this population. Several in vitro and animal studies point toward a protective role of magnesium through multiple molecular mechanisms. Magnesium is a natural calcium antagonist, and both human and animal studies have shown that low circulating magnesium levels are associated with vascular calcification.[tpl]cite journal |author= Hashimoto T, Hara A, Ohkubo T, Kikuya M, Shintani Y, Metoki H, Inoue R, Asayama K, Kanno A, Nakashita M, Terata S, Obara T, Hirose T, Hoshi H, Totsune K, Satoh H, Imai Y|title= Serum magnesium, ambulatory blood pressure, and carotid artery alteration: the Ohasama study |journal= Am J Hypertens |volume=23 |pages=1292–1298 |year=2010 |pmid= 20706194 |doi= 10.1038/ajh.2010.168 |issue= 12[/tpl] Results from an observational study conducted in the general Japanese population demonstrated that lower serum magnesium levels were significantly and independently associated with a greater average intima-media thickness and the risk of at least two carotid plaques.[tpl]cite journal |author= Massy ZA, Drüeke TB |title= Magnesium and outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease: focus on vascular calcification, atherosclerosis, and survival |journal= Clin Kidney J |volume=5 |issue= Suppl 1 |pages= i52–i61 |year=2012 |doi=10.1093/ndtplus/sfr167|url= http://ckj.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/Suppl_1/i52.full.pdf[/tpl] Magnesium supplementation might be useful in reducing the progression of atherosclerosis in chronic dialysis patients.[tpl]cite journal |author= Turgut F, Kanbay M, Metin MR, Uz E, Akcay A, Covic A |title= Magnesium supplementation helps to improve carotid intima media thickness in patients on hemodialysis |journal = Int Urol Nephrol |volume=40 |pages=1075–1082 |year=2008 |doi= 10.1007/s11255-008-9410-3 |pmid= 18568412|issue= 4 [/tpl] Low serum magnesium may be an independent risk factor for death in patients with chronic kidney disease,[tpl]cite journal |author= Passlick-Deetjen J, Wang W et al. |title= Magnesium and mortality risk in hemodialysis patients.

===Magnesium overdose===

Since the kidneys are responsible for the excretion of magnesium, anyone with a heart or kidney disorder should not take any extra magnesium except under their doctor's supervision. It is very rare to overdose on magnesium from food, however, people that ingest large amounts of milk of magnesia (as a laxative or antacid), epsom salts (as a laxative or tonic), or magnesium supplements may overdose, especially if they suffer from kidney problems. Too much magnesium can cause several serious health problems, including nausea, vomiting, severely lowered blood pressure, confusion, slowed heart rate, respiratory paralysis, deficiencies of other minerals, coma, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, and eventually death. The most common side effects of magnesium toxicity are stomach upset and diarrhea.

==Safety precautions for magnesium metal==

Magnesium metal and its alloys are explosive hazards; they are highly flammable in their pure form when molten or in powder or ribbon form. Burning or molten magnesium metal reacts violently with water. When working with powdered magnesium, safety glasses with welding eye protection are employed, because the bright-white light produced by burning magnesium contains ultraviolet light that can permanently damage the retinas of the eyes.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/docs/support/scisafe/chapter8.html |title=Science Safety: Chapter 8 |publisher=Government of Manitoba |accessdate=2007-08-21[/tpl]
Magnesium is capable of reducing water to highly flammable hydrogen gas:[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.webelements.com/webelements/elements/text/Mg/chem.html| title=Chemistry : Periodic Table : magnesium : chemical reaction data| accessdate=2006-06-26| publisher=webelements.com[/tpl]
As a result, water cannot extinguish magnesium fires. The hydrogen gas produced only intensifies the fire. Dry sand is an effective smothering agent, but only on relatively level and flat surfaces.
Magnesium also reacts with carbon dioxide to form magnesium oxide and carbon:
hence, carbon dioxide fire extinguishers cannot be used for extinguishing magnesium fires, either.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ilpi.com/genchem/demo/co2mg/| title=Demo Lab: Reaction Of Magnesium Metal With Carbon Dioxide| accessdate=2006-06-26[/tpl]
Burning magnesium is usually quenched by using a Class D dry chemical fire extinguisher, or by covering the fire with sand or magnesium foundry flux to remove its air source.
