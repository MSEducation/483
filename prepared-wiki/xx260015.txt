==History==

In 1910, Our Lady of Mount Carmel church opened on what is now Mount Carmel Place. The parish was incorporated on February 19, 1908 out of the parish of St. Peter's, Poughkeepsie. Property was purchased June 1909 for the church from John I. Platt on the west side of Cataract Place,.Hasbrouck, Frank, ed. The History of Dutchess County New York, p647, S.A. Mathieu, Poughkeepsie, NY 1909 and ground was broken the following March. The cornerstone was laid May 1, 1910 by Bishop Cusack and the church was dedicated on October 12, 1910 by the Mgr. Lavelle, V.G.. A rectory in was built November 1913. The parish was built for the Italian population on Poughkeepsie and had (in 1913) 245 families of about 1,700 souls. The first pastor was the Rev. N. Pavone, who was born at Trivento, Italy, on August 18, 1878, ordained at a seminary there December 23, 1901, and studied at La Minerva University in Rome. From 1903 to 1904, he was a bishop's secretary in Trevienta, then he taught at the seminary at Larino before arriving in New York on December 20, 1905 where he was assigned to St. Peter's in Poughkeepsie.
Nearly 60 years later, the congregation moved into the former St. Peterâ€™s Church at 97 Mill Street.  A parish school was established in 1935, closing in 2007 due to low enrollment. Two years later, the school building was reopened under the direction of Astor Services and now functions as a school for special-needs students.  Astor Services also occupies the original Church building on Mount Carmel Place.Our Lady of Mount Carmel Parish Website available at http://mtcarmelpok.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=5&Itemid=33
The area has been home to many of Poughkeepsie's new immigrant populations, starting with the Irish, later the Italians.  Still home to several Italian restaurants and bakeries, the area is widely referred to as Poughkeepsie's Little Italy. Each June Our Lady of Mount Carmel Parish hosts the St. Anthony's Street Festival.
