Hurricane Faith reached the northernmost latitude and had the longest track of any Atlantic tropical cyclone. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1966 Atlantic hurricane season, Faith developed from an area of disturbed weather between Cape Verde and the west coast of Africa on August 21. Tracking westward, the depression gradually intensified and became Tropical Storm Faith on the following day. Moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean, it continued to slowly strengthen, reaching hurricane status early on August 23. About 42 hours later, Faith reached an initial peak with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), before weakening slightly on August 26. Located near the Lesser Antilles, the outer bands of Faith produced gale force winds in the region, especially Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Antigua. Minor coastal damage occurred as far south as Trinidad and Tobago.
By August 28, the storm began to re-intensify, after curving north-northwestward near The Bahamas. At 0000 UTC on the following day, Faith peaked as a 125 mph (205 km/h) Category 3 hurricane Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. Eventually, the storm weakened back to a Category 2 hurricane and re-curved to the northeast. One person drowned in the western Atlantic after his ship sunk. Heavy rainfall and strong winds pelted Bermuda, though no damage occurred. The storm maintained nearly the same intensity as a Category 2 hurricane for several days, while tracking northeastward into the far North Atlantic Ocean. Faith finally weakened while north of Scotland and became extratropical near the Faroe Islands on September 6. Three other drowning deaths occurred in the North Sea near Denmark. A fifth death occurred after a man succumbed to injuries sustained during a boating incident related to the storm.

==Meteorological history==

Television Infrared Observation Satellite XI (TIROS XI) imagery indicated the presence of an area of disturbed weather over Ivory Coast on August 18. The system moved slowly westward and eventually reached the Atlantic Ocean.[tpl]cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1966-prelim/faith/prelim01.gif|title=Hurricane Faith, August 18 – September 12, 1966 (Preliminary Report)|page=1|year=1966|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=February 14, 2013[/tpl] It is estimated that a tropical depression developed at 0000 UTC on August 21, while located about [tpl]convert|240|mi|km[/tpl] southeast of Cape Verde.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] Continuing westward, the depression intensified, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Faith on the following day. Gradual intensification persisted as Tropical Storm Faith headed nearly due westward at [tpl]convert|17|to|23|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] By August 23, Faith was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] Curving slightly west-northwestward, the storm reached Category 2 intensity and briefly peaked at sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). Hurricane Faith curved to the northwest and weakened back to a Category 1 hurricane while approaching the northeastern Leeward Islands on August 25.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] Initially, Faith was scheduled to be seeded as part of Project Stormfury. However, the scheduled seeding was cancelled as Faith was approaching The Bahamas.[tpl]cite report|author=Ray Popkin|title=The Environmental Science Services Administration|publisher=Environmental Science Services Administration|date=1967|page=240|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WusOAAAAMAAJ&q=bahamas+%22hurricane+faith%22+1966&dq=bahamas+%22hurricane+faith%22+1966&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3XstUamVNImA0AHkmIF4&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ|accessdate=February 27, 2013[/tpl] Bypassing the Leeward Islands, Faith remained at nearly the same intensity, until re-strengthening into Category 2 hurricane on August 28, near Turks and Caicos Islands. The storm quickly intensified further into a Category 3 hurricane only six hours later.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] 
At 0000 UTC on August 29, Faith attained its maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h).[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] After reaching maximum sustained winds late on August 29, Faith began to gradually weaken and decreased to Category 2 hurricane intensity early on August 30.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] By that time, the storm turned to the northeast around the periphery of an Atlantic subtropical anticyclone while located about midway between Bermuda and Florida.[tpl]cite report|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/094/mwr-094-11-0669.pdf|page=672|title=The Weather and Circulation of August 1966|author=James F.

While approaching Europe, Faith's forward speed increased to as much as 50 mph (75 km/h). At 0600 UTC on September 3, a minimum barometric pressure of [tpl]convert|950|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|lk=on[/tpl] was recorded – the lowest in relation to the storm. After remaining a Category 2 hurricane since August 29, Faith weakened slightly to a Category 1 hurricane early on September 6, as it neared the Faroe Islands.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] Crossing the North Sea, Faith finally transitioned into an extratropical storm at 1200 UTC later that day, while centered about 125 miles (200 km) east-northeast of Tórshavn.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] The extratropical remnants of Faith headed eastward and affected Norway with winds as high as 60 mph (95 km/h).[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl] Tracking over Scandinavia, the extratropical storm weakened to the equivalency of a tropical depression before entering the Soviet Union (present day Russia). Eventually, the storm degenerated into an extratropical low pressure area, curved northward, and retained its identity until September 15,[tpl]cite report|author=Arnold L.

==Impact and records==

In the Leeward Islands, the approach of Faith caused the tracking station on Antigua – which was monitoring an unmanned rocket launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) – to shut down 45 minutes after the rocket lifted off.[tpl]cite report|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4204/ch17-7.html|title=More Launches of the Saturn IB|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=February 14, 2013[/tpl] Other than on Antigua, Faith also produced gale force winds across Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, though only minor damage and no fatalities or injuries were reported. Further south, Faith brought rough seas to Trinidad and Tobago, with waves ranging from [tpl]convert|10|to|15|ft|m[/tpl]. These conditions inflicted minor damage to small boats and jetties. In Turks and Caicos Islands, the sea defenses were suffered some damage as Faith passed about 65 miles (105 km) east-northeast of the island.[tpl]cite report|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|date=1968|title=Turks and Caicos Islands: Report|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=npi72EgeGf0C&q=bahamas+%22hurricane+faith%22+1966&dq=bahamas+%22hurricane+faith%22+1966&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3XstUamVNImA0AHkmIF4&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw|page=38|accessdate=February 27, 2013[/tpl] On the East Coast of the United States, the storm produced rough seas and high tides from Cape Canaveral (then Cape Kennedy), Florida, to the Virginia Capes. Additionally, the Weather Bureau warned of possible gale force winds in The Carolinas and Virginia, but also noted that the area would only experience fringe effects from the storm.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1774&dat=19660901&id=TxgvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mGUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2153,7071|title=Hurricane Faith Losing Its Punch|date=September 1, 1966|agency=United Press International|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|page=1|accessdate=February 23, 2013[/tpl] In Bermuda, the outer rainbands of Hurricane Faith produced heavy rainfall and wind gusts up to [tpl]convert|62|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite report|url=http://bermuda-online.org/climateweather.htm|publisher=Bermuda Climate and Weather|title=Hurricane history (b) 1963-present that affected Bermuda|date=February 6, 2013[/tpl] 
Five people died as a result of the storm, though only one occurred on land. One man was pitched overboard the Alberto Benati, which was battered by heavy seas in the western Atlantic Ocean. Two others drowned near Denmark while trying to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat. Another man was missing and presumed dead after heavy seas forced him and his shipmates to abandon their boat off the north coast of Denmark. Property damage was minimal, mainly because the areas impacted by Faith were sparsely populated.[tpl]cite report|url=http://www.atl.ec.gc.ca/weather/hurricane/storm66.html|date=October 12, 1999|title=Storms of 1966|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=February 14, 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20001007233143/http://www.atl.ec.gc.ca/weather/hurricane/storm66.html|archivedate=October 7, 2000[/tpl] A 2,726 ton Norwegian car ferry known as Skagerak began to sink as it headed for Hirtshals in Region Nordjylland of Denmark. Waves pounded the side hatches, which flooded in the engine room, causing the ship to become disabled. A large scale search operation was conducted to rescue the 144 passengers aboard. All passengers were rescued and treated for their injuries in Hjørring, Denmark. However, one person died in the hospital.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UiJlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=H4gNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1166,1657589&hl=en|title=Ferry Boat Captain Credits Luck|date=September 8, 1966|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Edmonton Journal|page=41|accessdate=February 14, 2013[/tpl] In Norway, the remnants of Faith impacted areas between Ryfylke and Sunnfjord. The storm brought heavy rainfall and resulted in glacier melting, which in turn caused "large" flooding in some locations. Discharge from the Folgefonna, Fjærland, and Sunnfjord glaciers reached a record high due to the remnants of Faith.[tpl]cite report|url=http://www.nve.no/Global/Publikasjoner/Publikasjoner%202008/Oppdragsrapport%20A%202008/oppdragsrapportA14-08.pdf|title=Rainfall Floods and Weather  Patterns|author=Lars Andreas Roald|date=2008|publisher=Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate|pages=31 and 34|accessdate=February 14, 2013|format=PDF[/tpl] 
Throughout its duration, Faith traveled for [tpl]convert|6850|mi|km[/tpl], thus it had the longest track of an Atlantic hurricane and the second longest worldwide, after Hurricane John in 1994 in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.[tpl]cite report|author=Neal Dorst and Sandy Delgado|date=May 20, 2011|title=Subject: E7) What is the farthest a tropical cyclone has traveled?|publisher=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/E7.html|accessdate=February 14, 2013[/tpl] Faith also traveled to the northernmost latitude of any Atlantic tropical cyclone, reaching as far north as 61.1°N.[tpl]cite report|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1628|title=Igor delivers punishing blow to Newfoundland; 95L growing more organized|author=Jeffrey Masters|date=September 22, 2010|publisher=Weather Underground|accessdate=February 14, 2013[/tpl]
