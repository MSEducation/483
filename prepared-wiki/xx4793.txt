The Isle of Man ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|n[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-gv|Ellan Vannin[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-gv|ˈɛlʲən ˈvanɪn|[/tpl]Ellan is Manx for "island"; Vannin is the genitive case of Mannin, and means "of Mann".), otherwise known simply as Mann ([tpl]lang-gv|Mannin[/tpl], [tpl]IPA-gv|ˈmanɪn|IPA[/tpl]), is a self-governing British Crown Dependency, located in the Irish Sea between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor, but its foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government.
The island has been inhabited since before 6500 BC. As one of the six Celtic nations, Gaelic cultural influence began in the 5th century AD, and the Manx language, a branch of the Gaelic languages, gradually emerged. In 627, Edwin of Northumbria conquered the Isle of Man along with most of Mercia. In the 9th century, the Norse began to settle there. Norse people from Scotland then established the Kingdom of the Isles. The King's title would then carry the suffix, "and the Isles". Magnus III, the King of Norway, was also known as "King of Mann and the Isles" as part of the Hebrides civilization between 1099 and 1103.Magnus 3 Olavsson Berrføtt – Norsk biografisk leksikon. Snl.no. Retrieved on 29 July 2013. A Norse-Gaelic culture arose and the island came under Norse control. In 1266, the island became part of Scotland, as formalised by the Treaty of Perth. After a period of alternating rule by the kings of Scotland and England, the island came under the feudal lordship of the English Crown in 1399. The lordship revested into the British Crown in 1765, but the island never became part of the kingdom of Great Britain or its successor the United Kingdom, retaining its status as an internally self-governing Crown dependency.

==Etymology==

The Isle of Man is [tpl]lang-gv|Ellan Vannin[/tpl], where [tpl]lang|gv|ellan[/tpl] is a Manx word meaning island. The earliest form of Man is [tpl]lang|gv|Manu[/tpl] or [tpl]lang|gv|Mana[/tpl],[tpl]Cite book | last=Kinvig | first=R. H. | title=The Isle of Man: A Social, Cultural and Political History | page=18 |year=1975 | edition=3rd | isbn=0-85323-391-8 | publisher=Liverpool University Press | ref=harv | postscript=[/tpl] which appears in the genitive case as [tpl]lang|gv|Vaninn[/tpl], hence [tpl]lang|gv|Ellan Vannin[/tpl]'' "Island of Man".
The name [tpl]lang|gv|Mana/u[/tpl] is related to the figure of Celtic mythology known as Manannán mac Lir to the Irish and Manawydan to the Welsh.[tpl]Cite book | last=Kneale | first=Victor | chapter=Ellan Vannin (Isle of Man).

The name enters recorded history as Mona (Julius Caesar, 54 BC), and is also recorded as Monapia or Monabia (Pliny the Elder, AD 77), Monœda (Ptolemy, AD 150), Mevania or Mænavia (Orosius, AD 416), and Eubonia or Eumonia by Irish writers. Welsh records it as Manaw, and in the Sagas of Icelanders it is Mön.
Though the Isle of Man was never incorporated into the Roman Empire, the island was noted in the Classics where it was called variously Monapia, [tpl]lang|gk|Mοναοιδα[/tpl] (Monaoida), [tpl]lang|gk|Mοναρινα[/tpl] (Monarina), Menavi and Mevania. The Old Welsh and Old Irish names for the Isle of Man, Manau and Mano, also occur in Manaw Gododdin, the name for an ancient district in north Britain along the lower Firth of Forth. The name is probably connected with the Welsh name of the island of Anglesey, Ynys Môn and possibly with the Celtic root reflected in Welsh mynydd, Breton menez, and Scottish Gaelic monadh, all of which mean "mountain" and probably derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *men-, "to tower".Indogermanisches Etymologisches Woerterbuch: Record number 1277 (Root / lemma: men-1) In this case, such a name may have referred to the island apparently rising out of the Irish Sea on the horizon.

==History==

Rising water levels cut off the island from the surrounding islands around 8000 BC. Evidence suggests that colonisation of the island took place by sea some time before 6500 BC. The first residents lived in small huts, hunting, fishing and gathering their food. They used small tools made of flint or bone, examples of which have been found near the coast. Representatives of these artefacts are kept at the Manx Museum.Manx Museum Mesolithic collections
The Neolithic Period marked the coming of knowledge of farming, better stone tools and pottery. It was during this period that megalithic monuments began to appear around the island. Examples from this period can be found at Cashtal yn Ard near Maughold, King Orry's Grave at Laxey, Meayll Circle near Cregneash, and Ballaharra Stones at St John's. This was not the only Neolithic culture: there were also the local Ronaldsway and Bann cultures.Manx Museum Neolithic collections
During the Bronze Age, the large communal tombs of the megalith builders were replaced with smaller burial mounds. Bodies were put in stone-lined graves along with ornamental containers. The Bronze Age burial mounds created long-lasting markers around the countryside.Manx Museum Bronze Age collections
The Iron Age marked the beginning of Celtic cultural influence. Large hill forts appeared on hill summits, and smaller promontory forts along the coastal cliffs, while large timber-framed roundhouses were built. It is likely that the first Celts to inhabit the island were Britons speaking Common Brittonic.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] Around the 5th century AD, cultural influence from Ireland and migration precipitated a process of Gaelicisation evidenced by Ogham inscriptions, giving rise to the Manx language, which is a Goidelic language closely related to Irish and Scottish Gaelic.Manx Museum Celtic Farmers (Iron Age) collections
Viking settlement of the Isle of Man began at the end of the 8th century. The Vikings established Tynwald and introduced many land divisions that still exist.

==Geography==

The Isle of Man is located in the middle of the northern Irish Sea, almost equidistant from England, Ireland, Scotland, (closest), and Wales, furthest. It is [tpl]convert|52|km[/tpl] long and, at its widest point, [tpl]convert|22|km[/tpl] wide. It has an area of around [tpl]convert|572|km2[/tpl].Geography – Isle of Man Public Services Besides the island of Mann itself, the political unit of the Isle of Man includes some nearby small islands: the seasonally inhabited Calf of Man,[tpl]cite book | title = Bird Observatories of Britain and Ireland | last = Archer | first = Mike | isbn = 1-4081-1040-7 | publisher = A&C Black | year = 2010 | edition = 2nd[/tpl] Chicken Rock on which stands an unmanned lighthouse, St Patrick's Isle and St Michael's Isle. Both of the latter are connected to the mainland by permanent roads/causeways.
Hills in the north and south are separated by a central valley. The extreme north is exceptionally flat, consisting mainly of deposits from glacial advances from western Scotland during colder times. There are more recently deposited shingle beaches at the Point of Ayre. The island has one mountain higher than [tpl]convert|600|m[/tpl], Snaefell, with a height of [tpl]convert|620|m|ft|0[/tpl]. According to an old saying, from the summit one can see six kingdoms: those of the Mann, Scotland, England, Ireland, Wales, and Heaven. Some versions add a seventh kingdom, that of the Sea, or Neptune.Ian O'Leary Lecture

===Population===

At the 2006 interim census, The Isle of Man was home to 81,048 people, of whom 26,218 resided in the island's capital city, Douglas. Most of the population was born in Britain or Ireland, with 47.6% born in the Isle of Man, 37.2% born in England, 3.4% in Scotland, 2.1% in Northern Ireland, 2.1% in the Republic of Ireland, 1.2% in Wales and 0.3% born in the Channel Islands. The remaining 6.1% were born elsewhere in the world.

====Census====

The Isle of Man Full Census, last held in 2011, has been a decennial occurrence since 1821, with interim censuses being introduced from 1966. It is separate from, but similar to, the Census in the United Kingdom.
The 2001 Census was conducted by the Economic Affairs Division of the Isle of Man Treasury, under the authority of the Census Act 1929.

==Climate==

The Isle of Man has a temperate climate with cool summers and mild winters. Average rainfall is higher than that of the British Isles, because the Isle of Man is far enough from Ireland for the prevailing south-westerly winds to accumulate moisture. Average rainfall is highest at Snaefell, where it is around [tpl]convert|1900|mm[/tpl] a year. At lower levels it can be around [tpl]convert|800|mm[/tpl] a year. Temperatures remain fairly cool with the recorded maximum being [tpl]convert|28.9|C|F[/tpl] at Ronaldsway on 12 July 1983.
