Blanchardstown ([tpl]Irish place name|Baile Bhlainséir[/tpl]) is a large suburb of Dublin in Fingal, Ireland, located 10 km north-west of the city centre.

The 2011 Census recorded a population of 68,156 in Blanchardstown and its immediate environs.

==History==

Blanchardstown has grown up alongside its smaller neighbouring town, Castleknock. Both towns shared a common history until well into the 19th century, when their development diverged. The name Blanchardstown comes from the Blanchard family, who were granted their estate some time between 1250 and 1260. The name 'Blanchard' is thought to come from the French word blanch, meaning white, and could refer to white or fair hair.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.askaboutireland.ie/learning-zone/primary-students/looking-at-places/fingal/blanchardstown-through-ti/early-history/|title=Early History|publisher=Ask About Ireland|accessdate=5 December 2012[/tpl] The townland has an area of over 454 acres.
Blanchardstown was a rural village in western County Dublin until the late 1960s, when the first housing estates began to be developed. Blanchardstown developed in tandem with neighbouring settlement Castleknock, both of which grew rapidly from the early 1970s to the present. During the 1970s/80s, the village became subsumed into the suburban fabric of Dublin.
The Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown (ITB) was established in 1999.
A criminal gang from Blanchardstown became notorious as "The Westies"; their leaders were killed in Spain in 2004.[tpl]cite news|title=Garda swoop foils the revival of feared Westies crime gang - See more at: http://www.herald.ie/news/garda-swoop-foils-the-revival-of-feared-westies-crime-gang-27982139.html#sthash.74lQiqON.dpuf|url=http://www.herald.ie/news/garda-swoop-foils-the-revival-of-feared-westies-crime-gang-27982139.html|accessdate=28 February 2013|newspaper=The Herald|date=13 June 2011|author=Ken Foy[/tpl]

===Ecclesiastical history===

In the 19th century, the Roman Catholic parish of Blanchardstown encompassed much of the area now within the Dublin 15 postal district. Following the relaxation of the Penal Laws, it became possible for the Catholic adherents to consider the construction of additional churches and to repair the existing stock of religious buildings. Church authorities used the opportunity to implement the Tridentine reform which saw the parish as the basic unit of ecclesiastical organisation and the parish priest as the central figure within the parish.Cronin, Elizabeth, Fr Michael Dungan's Blanchardstown, 1836-1968, Four Courts Press (2002), p. 10.
The new parish priest of Blanchardstown in 1839, Fr Michael Dungan, oversaw the construction of a number of new churches, which are today independent parishes in their own right, and invited a number of religious communities to provide for the education of Catholic children. St Brigid's Church, Blanchardstown – not to be confused with a church of the Church of Ireland in nearby Castleknock – was constructed in 1837 upon the foundation of a church that had been built prior to 1731. It is the Mother church of 12 other churches constituted out of the parish over the following 156 years.Cronin, Elizabeth, Fr Michael Dungan's Blanchardstown, 1836-1968, Four Courts Press (2002), p  56.
