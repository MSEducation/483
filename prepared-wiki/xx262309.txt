[[Earthquakes in 2011]]

CATEGORIES: 2011 earthquakes, Lists of earthquakes

This is a list of earthquakes in 2011. Only earthquakes of magnitude 6 or above are included, unless they result in damage and/or casualties, or are notable for some other reason.  All dates are listed according to UTC time.

==Compared to other years==

Note that an increase in detected earthquake numbers does not necessarily represent an increase in earthquakes per se. Population increase, habitation spread, and advances in earthquake detection technology all contribute to higher earthquake numbers being recorded over time.  USGS's Earthquake Myths has more information.
