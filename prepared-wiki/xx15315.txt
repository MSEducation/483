Hyderabad ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|d|ər|ə|ˌ|b|ae|d |audio=Hyderabad.ogg[/tpl] [tpl]respell|HY|dər-ə-bad[/tpl]; often [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|d|r|ə|ˌ|b|ae|d[/tpl]) is the capital and largest city of the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Occupying [tpl]convert|650|km2|sqmi[/tpl], along the banks of the Musi River, it has a population of [tpl]nowrap|6.8 million[/tpl] and a metropolitan population of [tpl]nowrap|7.75 million[/tpl], making it the fourth most populous city and sixth most populous urban agglomeration in India. At an average altitude of [tpl]convert|542|m|ft[/tpl], much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around artificial lakes, including Hussain Sagar—predating the city's founding—north of the city centre.
Established in 1591 by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, Hyderabad remained under the rule of the Qutb Shahi dynasty for nearly a century before the Mughals captured the region. In 1724, Mughal viceroy Asif Jah I declared his sovereignty and created his own dynasty, also known as the Nizams of Hyderabad. The Hyderabad State ultimately became a princely state during British rule, and remained so for [tpl]nowrap|150 years[/tpl], with the city serving as its capital. The city continued as capital of a new Hyderabad State after joining the Indian Union in 1948 and before attaining its current status as the focal point of Andhra Pradesh in 1956.Hyderabad city would be part of Telangana but it will first serve as the shared capital of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh for the duration of ten years.
Relics of Qutb Shahi and Nizam rule remain visible today, with the Charminar—commissioned by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah himself—coming to symbolise Hyderabad. Golconda fort is also a major landmark of Hyderabad. That legacy is also evident in the city's distinctive cuisine, which includes Hyderabadi biriyani and Hyderabadi haleem. The Qutb Shahis and Nizams established Hyderabad as a cultural hub, attracting men of letters from different parts of the world. Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with the decline of the Mughal Empire in the mid-19th century, with artists migrating to the city from the rest of the Indian subcontinent. While Hyderabad is losing its cultural pre-eminence, it is today, due to the Telugu film industry, the country's second-largest producer of motion pictures.
Hyderabad was historically known as a pearl and diamond trading centre, and it continues to be known as the City of Pearls. Many of the city's traditional bazaars, including Laad Bazaar, Begum Bazaar and Sultan Bazaar, have remained open for centuries. However, industrialisation throughout the [tpl]nowrap|20th century[/tpl] has also attracted major Indian manufacturing, research and financial institutions, including the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, National Geophysical Research Institute and the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology. Special economic zones dedicated to information technology have encouraged companies from across India and around the world to set up operations and the emergence of pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in the 1990s led to the title of Genome Valley. With an output of [tpl]US$[/tpl]74 billion, Hyderabad is the fifth-largest contributor to India's overall gross domestic product.

==History==

===Toponymy===

The name Hyderabad means "Hyder's abode" or "lion city", derived from the Persian/Urdu words "haydar" or "hyder" (lion) and "ābād" (city or abode).[tpl]cite book|title=Concise dictionary of world place names|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=223|isbn=978-0-19-860537-9|last=Everett-Heath|first=John|year=2005[/tpl] According to John Everett-Heath, the author of Oxford Concise Dictionary of World Place Names, Hyderabad was named to honour the Caliph Ali Ibn Abi Talib, who was also known as Hyder because of his lion-like valour in battles. One popular theory suggests that Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the founder of the city, named it "Bhaganagar" or "Bhāgnagar" after Bhagmati, a local nautch (dancing) girl with whom he had fallen in love.[ref][tpl]cite book|title=Rights at work: pay equity reform and the politics of legal mobilization|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=6|isbn=0-226-55571-2|last=McCann |first=Michael W.|year=1994[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The march of India|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d5AhAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=7 January 2013|year=1959|publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Informations and Broadcasting, Government of India|page=89[/tpl]

The Kakatiya dynasty was later reduced to a vassal of the Khilji dynasty (1310–1321) after its defeat by Sultan Alauddin Khilji of the Delhi Sultanate.

===Modern history===

In 1713 Farrukhsiyar, the later Mughal emperor, appointed Asif Jah I to be Viceroy of the Deccan, with the title Nizam-ul-Mulk (Administrator of the Realm).[ref][tpl]cite book|title=Advanced Study in the History of Modern India: 1707–1813|publisher=Sterling Publishing|page=143|isbn=978-1-932705-54-6|last=Mehta|first=Jaswant Lal|year=2005[/tpl]
In 1769 Hyderabad city became the formal capital of the Nizams. In response to regular threats from Hyder Ali, Dalwai of Mysore, Baji Rao I, Peshwa of the Maratha Empire, and Basalath Jung (Asif Jah II's elder brother, who was supported by the Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau), the Nizam signed a subsidiary alliance with the East India Company in 1798, allowing the British Indian Army to occupy Bolarum (modern Secunderabad) to protect the state's borders, for which the Nizams paid an annual maintenance to the British. Until 1874 there were no modern industries in Hyderabad. With the introduction of railways in the 1880s, four factories were built to the south and east of Hussain Sagar Lake,[tpl]cite web|title=The mills, Hyderabad.|url=http://www.europeana.eu/resolve/record/92037/D57DBD2A497C5C91F360ECF37818532883C65807|year=2013|publisher=Europeana|last=Dayal|first=Deen|accessdate=6 May 2013[/tpl] and during the early 20th century, Hyderabad was transformed into a modern city with the establishment of transport services, underground drainage, running water, electricity, Begumpet Airport, telecommunications, universities and industries. The Nizams ruled the state from Hyderabad until 17 September 1948, a year after India's independence from Britain.
After India gained independence, the Nizam declared his intention to remain independent rather than become part of the Indian Union. The Hyderabad State Congress, with the support of the Indian National Congress and the Communist Party of India, began agitating against Nizam VII in 1948. On 17 September 1948, the Indian Army took control of Hyderabad State after an invasion codenamed Operation Polo. With the defeat of his forces, Nizam VII capitulated to the Indian Union by signing the Instrument of Accession, which made him the Rajpramukh (Princely Governor) of the state until 31 October 1956.[tpl]cite news|title=Momentous day for lovers of freedom, democracy|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/09/17/stories/2004091706840400.htm|newspaper=The Hindu|last=Venkateshwarlu|first=K|date=17 September 2004|accessdate=23 May 2012[/tpl] Between 1946 and 1951, the Communist Party of India fomented the Telangana uprising against the feudal lords of the Telangana region and later against the princely state of Hyderabad.[tpl]cite book |title=Affirming life and diversity|publisher=Pragati Offset |pages=1–10 |isbn=978-1-84369-674-2| last1=Sathees| first1=P.V.|last2=Pimbert|first2=Michel|last3=The DDS Community Media Trust|year=2008[/tpl] The Constitution of India, which became effective on 26 January 1950, made Hyderabad State one of the part B states of India, with Hyderabad City continuing to be the capital.[tpl]cite news|title=Demand for states along linguistic lines gained momentum in the '50s |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-10/india/28375513_1_separate-state-new-state-punjab-and-uttar-pradesh|newspaper=The Times of India|date=10 January 2011|accessdate=31 July 2013[/tpl] In his 1955 report Thoughts on Linguistic States, B.

==Administration==

===Local government===

The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) oversees the civic infrastructure of the city's 18 "circles", which together encompass 150 municipal wards. Each ward is represented by a corporator, elected by popular vote. The corporators elect the Mayor, who is the titular head of GHMC; executive powers rest with the Municipal Commissioner, appointed by the Government of Andhra Pradesh.

==Culture==

Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with the decline of the Mughal Empire in Delhi in 1857 AD. The migration of performing artists to the city particularly from the north and west of the Indian sub continent, under the patronage of the Nizam, enriched the cultural milieu.[tpl]cite news|title=The courtesans of Hyderabad & Mehboob Ki Mehendi|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-23/hyderabad/35982664_1_qutub-shahi-courtesans-golconda|work=Times of India|date=23 December 2012|accessdate=4 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The Nocturnal Court: The Life of a Prince of Hyderabad|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=xlii|year=2004|last1=Jaisi|first1=sadiq|last2=Luther|first2=Narendra|isbn=978-0-19-566605-2[/tpl] This migration resulted in a mingling of North and South Indian languages, cultures and religions, which has since led to a co-existence of Hindu and Muslim traditions, for which the city has become noted.[ref][tpl]cite book|title=Hyderabad: an expat survival guide|publisher=Chillibreeze|page=9|year=2007|isbn=978-81-904055-5-3[/tpl]

===Literature===

In the past, Hyderabad had received royal patronage for arts, literature and architecture from Qutb Shahi rulers and Nizams attracting artists and men of letters from different parts of the world. The resulting multi-ethnic settlements popularised cultural events such as mushairas (poetic symposia).[tpl]cite news|title=Anjuman Muhibban-e-Urdu to hold international mushaira|url=http://www.siasat.com/english/news/anjuman-muhibban-e-urdu-hold-international-mushaira|newspaper=The Siasat Daily|date=13 April 2012|accessdate=13 April 2012[/tpl] The Qutb Shahi dynasty particularly encouraged the growth of Deccani Urdu literature leading to works such as the Deccani Masnavi and Diwan poetry, which are among the earliest available manuscripts in Urdu.[tpl]cite book|title=Mohammad Quli Qutb Shah|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|pages=50–77|year=1996|isbn=81-260-0233-6|last=Hussain Khan|first=Masud[/tpl] Lazzat Un Nisa a book compiled in the 15th century at Qutb Shahi courts, contains erotic paintings with diagrams for secret medicines and stimulants in the eastern form of ancient sexual acts.[tpl]cite book|title=Scent in the Islamic Garden: A Study of Deccani Urdu Literary Sources|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=40|year=2001|isbn=978-0-19-579334-5|first=Ali Alber|last=Husain[/tpl] The reign of the Nizams saw many literary reforms and the introduction of Urdu as a language of court, administration and education.[tpl]cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian literature: Devraj to Jyoti, Volume 2|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|pages=1260, 1746–1748|year=2005|isbn=81-260-1194-7|last=Datta|first=Amaresh[/tpl] In 1824, a collection of Urdu Ghazal poetry, named Gulzar-e-Mahlaqa, authored by Mah Laqa Bai—the first female Urdu poet to produce a Diwan—was published in Hyderabad.[tpl]cite book|title=Women writing in India volume 1, 600 BC to the early twentieth century|publisher=The Feminist Press| pages=120–122|year=1991|isbn=1-55861-027-8|first1=Susie J.|last1=Tharu|first2=K.|last2=Lalita[/tpl]

===Music and films===

South Indian music and dances such as the Kuchipudi and Kathakali styles are popular in the Deccan region. As a result of their culture policies, North Indian music and dance gained popularity during the rule of the Mughals and Nizams,[tpl]cite book|title=Romance of Hyderabad culture|page=44|last1=Nigam|first1=Mohan Lal|last2=Bhatnagar|first2=Anupama|publisher=Deva Publication|year=1997|oclc=DS 486 .H9 N54 1997[/tpl] and it was also during their reign that it became a tradition among the nobility to associate themselves with Tawaif (courtesans).

Although not a centre for handicrafts itself, the patronage of the arts by the Mughals and Nizams attracted artisans from the region to Hyderabad.
