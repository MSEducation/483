Kromdraai is a fossil-bearing breccia filled cave located about 2 km east of the well known South African hominid-bearing site of Sterkfontein and about 45 km Northwest of the City of Johannesburg, South Africa. It is situated within the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site and is itself a South African National Heritage Site.[tpl]cite web|title=9/2/233/0022-001 - Kromdraai Palaeontological Reserve, Kromdraai 71, Krugersdorp District|url=http://www.sahra.org.za/node/19150|publisher=South African Heritage Resources Agency|accessdate=16 September 2013[/tpl]

==History of investigations==

In 1938, the site was brought to the attention of Robert Broom by a local schoolboy named Gert Terrblanche who had discovered several hominin teeth.  The teeth formed part of a skull that would become the holotype of Paranthropus robustus. Broom began excavations at the site that would continue until approximately 1947 and would result in the discovery of numerous hominin remains.  Two deposits were noted and named at the site — Kromdraai A and Kromdraai B — the latter being the site where the hominin remains were recovered.[tpl]cite book|title=Finding the Missing Link|accessdate=|author=R.

In 1955 C.K. Brain recommenced work at Kromdraai B and discovered numerous additional hominin remains as well as abundant non-hominin fauna.[tpl]cite book|title=Hominid fossils from Kromdraai: a revised list of specimens discovered since 1938|accessdate=|author=J.F.

In the 1980s Elizabeth Vrba briefly conducted excavations at Kromdraai B in order to recover additional samples for her work on South African bovids.[tpl]cite book|title=The Kromdraai Australopithecine site revisited in 1980: recent investigations and results|accessdate=|author=E.

In 1993 excavations were re-opened by Francis Thackeray of the Transvaal Museum and Lee Berger of the University of the Witwatersrand. They were later joined by teams from Harvard University and other collaborators.[tpl]cite book|title=The renewal of excavation activities at Kromdraai, South Africa|accessdate=|author= L.R.

==Recovered fossils==

Besides the holotype specimen of P. robustus, at the time of the writing of this article 29 hominin specimens had been recovered from Kromdraai B. Many thousands of animal fossils have also been recovered from both Kromdraai A and B.

===Age of the deposits===

Kromdraai B is dated to between approximately 2.0 - 1.6 Ma with the majority if not all the Paranthropus robustus fossils dating to between 1.8 and 1.6 Ma.Herries, A.I.R., Hopley, P.J., Adams, J.W., Curnoe, D., Maslin, M.A. 2010.
