Sasibuqa (1309-1315?) was the khan of Orda's Ulus. He was one of Bayan's four sons. 
The rulers of Orda's Ulus (the White Horde) or the Left wing of the Jochid Ulus issued decrees with the name of khan in Sarai, though, they were reigning largely independent. Because he resisted Uzbeg Khan's Islamicization policy, Sasibuqa might have been executed in 1315.
