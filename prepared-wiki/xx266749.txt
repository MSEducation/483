==History==

Huntsville was ordered on May 1, 1862 by the Confederate States Navy.  She was launched at the Confederate Naval Works at Selma on February 7, 1863 and finished in Mobile.  She was finally delivered on August 1, 1863.  She was only partially armored, with the armor plate delivered by the Shelby Iron Company of Shelby, Alabama and the Atlanta Rolling Mill.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/cfa5/huntsville.htm |title=Huntsville |date=September 24, 2011 |work=Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships |publisher=United States Navy [/tpl]  She had defective engines that were obtained from a river steamer and an incomplete armament, so was assigned to guard the waters around Mobile.
Huntsville escaped up the Spanish River following the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864.  The city of Mobile held out another eight months, with the upper portion of Mobile Bay remaining in Confederate hands.  She, along with the CSS Tuscaloosa, was scuttled where the Spanish River splits off from the Mobile River on the north side of Blakeley Island, just north of Mobile, on April 12, 1865 to prevent her capture following the surrender of the city.  The wreck was located in the river in 1985.[tpl]cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Civil War Shipwrecks |last=Gaines |first=W.
