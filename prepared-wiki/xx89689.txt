Top Thrill Dragster is a steel accelerator roller coaster built by Intamin at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. It was the sixteenth roller coaster built at the park since the Blue Streak in 1964. When built in 2003, it was the first full circuit roller coaster to exceed [tpl]convert|400|ft|m[/tpl] in height, and was the tallest roller coaster in the world, before being surpassed by Kingda Ka in May 2005. Top Thrill Dragster, along with Kingda Ka, are the only strata coasters in existence.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thecoastercritic.com/2006/11/what-is-hyper-coaster.html |title=Kingda Ka vs. Top Thrill Dragster |publisher= thecoastercritic.com |date=November 16, 2006 |accessdate=June 8, 2012[/tpl] It was the second hydraulically launched roller coaster built by Intamin, following Xcelerator at Knott's Berry Farm.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rcdb.com/r.htm?ot=2&pp=86 |title=Hydraulic launched roller coasters at RCDB|publisher= Roller Coaster DataBase |accessdate=July 7, 2012[/tpl] The tagline for Top Thrill Dragster is "Race for the Sky".

==History==

Planning for Top Thrill Dragster started around 2000 when Millennium Force opened. Footers started being poured during the winter of 2001/2002 then were covered up during the 2002 operating season. To construct the roller coaster, the park had to use a [tpl]convert|480|ft|m[/tpl] crane, only one of four in the United States. Vertical construction by Martin & Vleminckx[tpl]cite web|title=Intamin|url=http://www.martin-vleminckx.com/mva_web_3_019.htm|publisher=Martin & Vleminckx|accessdate=16 November 2013[/tpl] started in fall 2002, months before the announcement.[tpl]cite news |title=Top Thrill Dragster TV announcement|year=2010|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lqmnZnByqA|accessdate=July 7, 2012[/tpl] By October 2002, the roller coaster had reached [tpl]convert|200|ft|m[/tpl].[tpl]cite news|title = Top Thrill Dragster 200 foot support|publisher =CoasterGallery.com |year = 2002| url = http://www.coastergallery.com/CP/91.html |accessdate = July 6, 2012[/tpl] The ride was announced on January 9, 2003 and the structure, built by Intamin's subcontractor Stakotra,Stakotra was finished shortly after. It is tied with Millennium Force for being the two largest investments in Cedar Point history. The announcement revealed the park's goal to build "the tallest and fastest roller coaster on earth", reaching [tpl]convert|420|ft|m[/tpl] and accelerating up to [tpl]convert|120|mi/h|km/h|0[/tpl] in 3.8 seconds.  On March 10, 2003, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company filed a trademark for the name Top Thrill Dragster.[tpl]cite news |title=Top Thrill Dragster Trademark |url=http://www.trademarkia.com/top-thrill-dragster-76496254.html |publisher=Legal Force|accessdate=July 16, 2012[/tpl]
Top Thrill Dragster's media day was held on May 1, 2003[tpl]cite web|title=PointBuzz history|url=http://pointbuzz.com/c/history.aspx|publisher=PointBuzz|accessdate=October 21, 2012[/tpl] then it officially opened to the public on May 4.[tpl]Cite RCDB|coaster_name=Top Thrill Dragster|location=Cedar Point|rcdb_number=1896|accessdate=October 21, 2012[/tpl] It became the "tallest" and "fastest" roller coaster in the world overtaking both world records from Steel Dragon 2000 at Nagashima Spa Land that was just built three years earlier. It lost the title of being the world's tallest and fastest roller coaster when Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure opened in May 2005. Intamin designed both Kingda Ka and Top Thrill Dragster, and the two share a similar design and layout that differs primarily by the theme and the additional hill featured on Kingda Ka.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thecoastercritic.com/2007/07/top-thrill-dragster-vs-kingda-ka-roller.html |title=Kingda Ka vs. Top Thrill Dragster |publisher= thecoastercritic.com |date=July 18, 2007 |accessdate=June 8, 2012[/tpl]
The ride had constant downtime in its first couple seasons. Several problems such as the ride's hydraulic system and launch cable caused the ride to experience downtime. Top Thrill Dragster was also closed in 2003 for the annual event, CoasterMania.

==Ride experience==

===Layout===

After leaving the station, the train enters the launch area. To the left of the launch area is a "Christmas tree" light, similar to those employed at the starting line of a drag strip. A brief message is played to the riders to: "keep arms down, head back, and hold on." Once the train is prepared to launch, a motor revving sound effect is played and its magnetic braking fins are lowered from the launch track. It then launches, accelerating to a speed of [tpl]convert|120|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] in 3.8 seconds. Shortly after reaching its maximum velocity, the train begins its ascent up a 90-degree incline, twisting 90 degrees counter-clockwise before climbing over the [tpl]convert|420|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] top hat. Upon descending, the track twists 270 degrees before leveling out, allowing the train to be stopped by the magnetic brakes.[tpl]cite news |title=Top Thrill Dragster POV|year=2009|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbN3NU4hIZg|accessdate=July 6, 2012[/tpl]

===Theme/trains===

The roller coaster is based on the Top Fuel Drag Racing motor sport. A real Top Fuel dragster weighs approximately one ton, while each train on the coaster weighs 15 tons. Its dragster themed trains once had decorative spoilers and engines, but these were removed soon after opening, allowing an extra row of seats to be added to each one. Also, when the ride opened, it had only four cars on each train, including the decals. By the middle of the 2003 season, the fifth cars were added to all trains, making them the five cars long that they are now. The fifth cars were added on shortly before the decals were removed.[tpl]cite news|title = Top Thrill Dragster old trains|publisher =CoasterGallery.com |year = 2003| url = http://www.coastergallery.com/CP/105.html |accessdate = July 6, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title = Top Thrill Dragster images at RCDB|publisher = Roller Coaster Database|url = http://www.rcdb.com/1896.htm?p=0|accessdate = July 7, 2012[/tpl] The ride's theme song, "Ready to Go" by Republica, is played while in the station.[tpl]cite news |title=Top Thrill Dragster Station/Theme Music|year=2009|url=http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vunO1Zgl3e4|accessdate=July 7, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Top Thrill Dragster Station/Theme Music 2|year=2010|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jv7L1lylAA|accessdate=July 6, 2012[/tpl]

===Rollbacks===

Occasionally, a train is launched with not enough speed to clear the crest. This typically happens in cool, wet, or breezy weather, or when the wind is working against it. In these conditions, the launch often does not provide it with enough speed to climb over the hill, which causes it to stop short of the top, and roll back down the hill in reverse, hence the term "rollback". The launch track is equipped with retractable magnetic braking fins which are raised after the train is launched in order to slow one that did not crest the hill.[tpl]cite news | title = Top Thrill Dragster rollback review | publisher = Thrill Network | url = http://ptreport.thrillnetwork.net/reviews/ttd.htm | accessdate = July 6, 2012 [/tpl]
On very rare occasions a combination of the weight distribution of the train, the force of the launch, and the wind can stall a train on the top of the tower. When this happens, a mechanic takes the elevator to the top and pushes the train down the hill.[tpl]cite news|title = Top Thrill Dragster elevator|publisher =CoasterGallery.com |year = 2008| url = http://www.coastergallery.com/CP/101.html |accessdate = July 6, 2012[/tpl] This has only happened three times with passengers on board, June 24, 2005,[tpl]cite news |title = Top Thrill Dragster Stuck at Top |publisher = Xtreme Coastin |date = June 24, 2005 |url = http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6254958468684676624 |accessdate = July 7, 2012 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2014[/tpl] October 25, 2008,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cedarpoint.com/public/fun/blog/index.cfm?entry=48a5a061-f8d7-4e18-b733-8eaec1685b30| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081031063607/http://www.cedarpoint.com/public/fun/blog/index.cfm?entry=48a5a061-f8d7-4e18-b733-8eaec1685b30|archivedate=October 31, 2008|title=Top Thrill Dragster stuck October 31, 2008 |date= October 31, 2008|accessdate=July 6, 2012[/tpl] and May 25, 2009.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.cedarpoint.com/public/fun/blog/index.cfm?entry=546e3519-1f9c-4d11-a74b-e3e2251f419b |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090529142625/http://www.cedarpoint.com/public/fun/blog/index.cfm?entry=546e3519-1f9c-4d11-a74b-e3e2251f419b|archivedate=May 25, 2009|title=Top Thrill Dragster stuck May 25, 2009 |date= May 25, 2009|accessdate=July 6, 2012[/tpl]

==World records==

When Top Thrill Dragster debuted, it set four new records:
It was the fourth roller coaster to break the [tpl]convert|100|mph[/tpl] speed barrier. It was preceded by Tower of Terror II at Dreamworld, Superman: Escape from Krypton at Six Flags Magic Mountain and Dodonpa at Fuji-Q Highland.
The previous record holder for overall height was Superman: Escape from Krypton at Six Flags Magic Mountain, standing at [tpl]convert|415|ft[/tpl]. Its record was broken in 2005 when Kingda Ka opened at Six Flags Great Adventure, standing [tpl]convert|456|ft[/tpl] tall.
The previous record holder for speed was Dodonpa, at [tpl]convert|107|mph[/tpl]. This record was broken by Top Thrill Dragster, which reaches speeds up to [tpl]convert|120|mph[/tpl], which was later broken by Kingda Ka which reached a top speed of [tpl]convert|128|mph[/tpl]. In November 2010, Formula Rossa at Ferrari World broke the record for fastest roller coaster, with a top speed of [tpl]convert|149.1|mph[/tpl].[tpl]cite news |title=Top Thrill Dragster records|url=http://people.setonhill.edu/ChristopherUlicne/project1_cu.html|accessdate=July 6, 2012[/tpl]

==Operation==

Top Thrill Dragster is negatively affected by unfavourable weather conditions as both a high altitude and high velocity ride. "Rain, high winds, and/or lightning" may result in the closing of the ride depending on the severity. It will close in high winds and any kind of precipitation.[tpl]cite news |title=Ride policies and Procedures|year=2012|url=http://www.cedarpoint.com/plan-a-visit/ride-policies-and-procedures|accessdate=July 7, 2012[/tpl]

Passengers on Dragster may not bring any loose articles onto the train and will be required to wear shirts and footwear. Headphones must be removed before boarding.
Passengers are advised that they must not ride Dragster if they have "a history of recent surgery, heart trouble/high blood pressure, neck trouble, back trouble, or any other condition that may be aggravated by riding, or who are pregnant".[tpl]cite news |title=Guests with Special Needs|url=http://www.cedarpoint.com/plan-a-visit/guests-with-disabilities|accessdate=July 7, 2012[/tpl]

==Accident==

On July 14, 2004 at around 8:20 PM, four people were struck by flying debris while riding the coaster. Reports indicated that its metal cable frayed as the train was being launched. Shards of metal sheared off of it and struck the riders as the train launched. The riders were left with abrasions mainly on their arms and one rider had cuts on his face. The injured ones were treated at the park's first aid station, and two of them later sought further medical attention on their own.[tpl]cite news| title = July 14, 2004 incident| newspaper = Toledo Blade| url = http://www.toledoblade.com/frontpage/2004/07/14/Cedar-Point-shuts-down-coaster-after-riders-hurt.html|date = July 14, 2004| accessdate = July 7, 2012 [/tpl]
