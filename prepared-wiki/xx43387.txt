"Why did the chicken cross the road?" is a common riddle or joke. The answer or punchline is: "To get to the other side." The riddle is an example of anti-humor, in that the curious setup of the joke leads the listener to expect a traditional punchline, but they are instead given a simple statement of fact. "Why did the chicken cross the road?" has become largely iconic as an exemplary generic joke to which most people know the answer, and has been repeated and changed numerous times.

==History==

The first known printing of this riddle was in 1847, in The Knickerbocker, a New York City monthly magazine:The Knickerbocker, or The New York Monthly, March 1847, p. 283.
 
 ...There are ‘quips and quillets’ which seem actual conundrums, but yet are none.  Of such is this:  ‘Why does a chicken cross the street?’   Are you ‘out of town?’    Do you ‘give it up?’  Well, then:  ‘Because it wants to get on the other side!’

The joke had become widespread by the 1890s, when a variant version appeared in the magazine Potter's American Monthly:Potter's American Monthly (1892), p. 319.
 
 Why should not a chicken cross the road?
It would be a fowl proceeding.

==Variations==

There are many riddles that assume a familiarity with this well-known riddle and its answer. One class of variations enlists a creature other than the chicken to cross the road, in order to refer back to the original riddle. For example, a turkey or duck crosses "because it was the chicken's day off," and a dinosaur "because chickens didn't exist yet." Some variants are both puns and references to the original, such as "Why did the duck cross the road?" "To prove he's no chicken"
Other variations replace side with another word often to form a pun. Some examples are "Why did the chicken cross the playground? To get to the other slide" or "Why did the whale cross the ocean? To get to the other tide." A mathematical version asks, "Why did the chicken cross the Möbius strip?" "To get to the same side."
Another interpretation of the joke is that "the other side" is a reference to the afterlife, and that the chicken intended to commit suicide.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2013[/tpl]
Another class of variations, designed for written rather than oral transmission, employs parody by pretending to have notable individuals or institutions give characteristic answers to the question posed by the riddle.Why Did the Chicken Cross the Road? Joke As with the lightbulb joke, variants on this theme are virtually infinite.
