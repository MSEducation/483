Kymi (Greek: Κύμη, Kýmē) is a coastal town and a former municipality (8,772 inhabitants in 2001) in the island of Euboea, Greece, named after an ancient Greek place of the same name. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Kymi-Aliveri, of which it is a municipal unit.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior [tpl]el icon[/tpl] The ancient Euboean Kyme is mentioned as a harbor town related to the more prominent poleis of Chalkis and Eretria in antiquity. Together with these, it is sometimes named as the founding metropolis of the homonymous Kymē (Cumae) in Italy, an important early Euboean colony, which was probably named after it.
There are few or no archaeological traces of ancient Euboean Kyme, and its exact location is not known. A Bronze Age settlement has been excavated in nearby Mourteri. Some modern authors believe that Kyme never existed as an independent polis in historical times but that it was a mere village dependent on either Chalkis or Eretria.[tpl]cite book|first=Keith G.|last=Walker|title=Archaic Eretria: a political and social history from the earliest times to 490 BC|place=London|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|page=143[/tpl]
