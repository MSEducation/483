The manor was part of the fee of the Constables whose manor was at Constable Burton and followed that descent. Around 1240 a mesne lordship was granted to Jollan de Nevill. Other landowners included the Staveley family who claimed land in 1272, though the major landowner were the Whitwell family. At the end of the 17th century, the manor was in the hands of John Belasyse of Worlaby, whose heirs owned a quarter share of the manor thereafter.[tpl]cite book|title=Bulmer's Topography, History and Directory (Private and Commercial) of North Yorkshire 1890 |page=377|year=1890 |publisher= S&N Publishing|isbn= 1-86150-299-0|accessdate=30 May 2013[/tpl]
