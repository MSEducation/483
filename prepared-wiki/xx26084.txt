The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is a single-seat, twin-engine fifth-generation supersonic supermaneuverable fighter aircraft that uses stealth technology. It was designed primarily as an air superiority fighter, but has additional capabilities that include ground attack, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence roles.Reed, John. "Official: Fighters should be used for spying." Airforce Times, 20 December 2009. Retrieved: 9 May 2010. Lockheed Martin Aeronautics is the prime contractor and is responsible for the majority of the airframe, weapon systems and final assembly of the F-22. Program partner Boeing Defense, Space & Security provides the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, and training systems.
The aircraft was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 prior to formally entering service in December 2005 as the F-22A. Despite a protracted development, the United States Air Force considers the F-22 a critical component of their tactical air power, and claims that the aircraft is unmatched by any known or projected fighter."F-22 Raptor fact sheet." U.S. Air Force, March 2009. Retrieved: 23 July 2009. Lockheed Martin claims that the Raptor's combination of stealth, speed, agility, precision and situational awareness, combined with air-to-air and air-to-ground combat capabilities, makes it the best overall fighter in the world today.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/products/f22/f-22-requirement.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090428162415/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/products/f22/f-22-requirement.html |archivedate=28 April 2009 |title=Why F-22? |publisher=Lockheed Martin |accessdate=10 November 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, former Chief of the Australian Defence Force, said in 2004 that the "F-22 will be the most outstanding fighter plane ever built."Houston, A.

The high cost of the aircraft, a lack of clear air-to-air missions because of delays in Russian and Chinese fighter programs, a ban on exports, and development of the cheaper and more versatile F-35 led to the end of F-22 production.[tpl]#tag:ref|Referring to statements made by the Secretary of Defense Robert Gates: "The secretary once again highlighted his ambitious next-year request for the more-versatile F-35s."[tpl]cite web|last=Baron|first=Kevin|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/gates-outlines-air-force-priorities-and-expectations-1.94837 |title=Gates outlines Air Force priorities and expectations |work=Stars and Stripes |date= 16 September 2009|accessdate=30 October 2013[/tpl]|group=N[/tpl] A final procurement tally of 187 operational aircraft was established in 2009; the final F-22 rolled off the assembly line on 13 December 2011 during a ceremony at Dobbins Air Reserve Base.[tpl]Cite news |last=Serrie|first=Jonathan. |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/12/13/last-f-22-raptor-rolls-off-assembly-line/ |title=Last F-22 Raptor Rolls Off Assembly Line |work=Fox News|date=13 December 2011|accessdate=30 October 2013[/tpl]
Starting in 2010, the F-22 was plagued by oxygen system problems that contributed to a fatal crash. In 2011 the fleet was grounded for four months before resuming flight, reports of oxygen issues persisted.Sughrue, Karen (producer) and Lesley Stahl. "Is the Air Force's F-22 fighter jet making pilots sick?" 60 Minutes: CBC News, 6 May 2012. Retrieved: 7 May 2012. In July 2012, the Air Force announced that the hypoxia-like symptoms experienced were caused by a faulty valve in the pilots' pressure vest; the valve was replaced and the filtration system also changed.

==Development==

===Origins===

In 1981 the U.S. Air Force developed a requirement for an Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) as a new air superiority fighter to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. This was influenced by the emerging worldwide threats, including development and proliferation of Soviet Su-27 "Flanker"- and MiG-29 "Fulcrum"-class fighter aircraft. It would take advantage of the new technologies in fighter design on the horizon, including composite materials, lightweight alloys, advanced flight-control systems, more powerful propulsion systems, and stealth technology. A request for proposals (RFP) was issued in July 1986 and two contractor teams, Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics and Northrop/McDonnell Douglas, were selected on 31 October 1986 to undertake a 50-month demonstration phase, culminating in the flight test of two prototypes, the YF-22 and the YF-23.Jenkins and Landis 2008, pp. 233–234.Williams 2002, pp. 5–6."Fact sheet: Lockheed-Boeing-General Dynamics YF-22." U.S. Air Force, 11 February 2009. Retrieved: 18 June 2011.
Each design team produced two prototypes, one for each of the two engine options. The Lockheed-led team chose to employ thrust vectoring for enhanced pitch performance, a useful capability in dogfights. The ATF's increasing weight and cost drove out some features during development. A dedicated infra-red search and track (IRST) system was downgraded from multi-color to single color and then deleted, the side-looking radars were deleted and the ejection seat requirement was downgraded from a fresh design to the existing McDonnell Douglas ACES II.Aronstein and Hirschberg 1998, p. 108.
After a 90-day flight test validation of the prototype air vehicles, on 23 April 1991, Secretary of the U.S. Air Force Donald Rice announced the YF-22 was the winner of the ATF competition.Jenkins and Landis 2008, p. 234. The YF-23 design was more stealthy and faster, but the YF-22 was more agile.Goodall 1992, p. 110. The aviation press speculated that the YF-22 was also more adaptable to the Navy's Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), but by 1992, the U.S. Navy had abandoned NATF.Miller 2005, p. 76. In 1991, the USAF planned to buy 650 aircraft.Pearlstein, Steven and Barton Gellman. "Lockheed wins huge jet contract; Air Force plans to buy 650 stealth planes at $100 million each". The Washington Post, 24 April 1991.

===Production and procurement===

On 9 April 1997, the production F-22 model was unveiled at Lockheed Georgia Co., Marietta, Georgia. It first flew on 7 September 1997. The first production F-22 was delivered to Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, on 7 January 2003.Miller 2005, p. 65. In 2006, the Raptor's development team, composed of Lockheed Martin and over 1,000 other companies, plus the United States Air Force, won the Collier Trophy, American aviation's most prestigious award."F-22 Raptor Wins 2006 Collier Trophy." National Aeronautic Association. Retrieved: 23 July 2009. In 2006, the USAF sought to acquire 381 F-22s, to be divided among seven active duty combat squadrons and three integrated Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard squadrons.
Several design changes were made from the YF-22 for production. The swept-back angle on the wing's leading edge was decreased from 48° to 42°, while the vertical stabilizers were shifted toward the rear and their area decreased by 20%."F-22 Partners."[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] NASA. Retrieved: 25 July 2009. To improve pilot visibility, the canopy was moved forward 7 inches (178 mm), and the engine intakes moved rearward 14 inches (356 mm). The shapes of the wing and stabilator trailing edges were refined to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics.Pace 1999, pp. 12–13."YF-22/F-22A comparison diagram." GlobalSecurity.org. Retrieved: 13 June 2010. During development, the aircraft increased in weight, reducing its range and aerodynamic performance slightly."F-22 weight increase agreed."

The United States Air Force originally planned to order 750 ATFs at a cost of $26.2 billion,[tpl]harvnb|Williams|2002|p=22.[/tpl] with production beginning in 1994; however, the 1990 Major Aircraft Review led by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney altered the plan to 648 aircraft beginning in 1996. In 1994, the number was cut to 438 aircraft to enter service in 2003–2004; a 1997 Department of Defense report put the purchase at 339. In 2003, the Air Force state the existing congressional cost cap limited the purchase to 277. In December 2004, the Department of Defense reduced funding so only 183 aircraft could be bought.Grant, Rebecca. "Losing Air Dominance." Airforce Magazine, December 2008. The Pentagon stated the reduction to 183 fighters would save $15 billion but raise the cost of each aircraft; this was implemented in the form of a multi-year procurement plan, which allowed for further orders later. The total cost of the program by 2006 was $62 billion.Lopez, C.T. "F-22 excels at establishing air dominance." Air Force Print News, 23 June 2006. Retrieved: 23 July 2009.
In April 2006, the cost of the F-22 was assessed by the Government Accountability Office to be $361 million per aircraft. By April 2006, $28 billion had been invested in F-22 development and testing; while the Unit Procurement Cost was estimated at $177.6 million in 2006, based on a production run of 181 aircraft."Sticker Shock: Estimating the Real Cost of Modern Fighter Aircraft, p. 2."

The Air Force claims that the Raptor cannot be matched by any known or projected fighter types, and Lockheed Martin claims: "the F-22 is the only aircraft that blends supercruise speed, super-agility, stealth and sensor fusion into a single air dominance platform."[tpl]Cite press release |url=http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/news/press-releases/2008/december/LockheedMartinRecognizedF.html |title=Lockheed Martin Recognized For Excellence In F-22 Raptor Sustainment |publisher=Lockheed Martin |date=9 December 2008 |accessdate=26 August 2012[/tpl]
To withstand both stress and heat factors, the F-22 makes extensive use of materials such as high-strength titanium and composites to a greater degree than previous fighters, at 39% and 24% respectively.F-22 Materials and Processes The use of internal weapons bays allows the aircraft to maintain a comparatively higher performance while carrying a heavy payload over most aircraft due to a lack of drag from external stores. It is one of only a few aircraft that can supercruise or sustain supersonic flight without the use of afterburners, which consume vastly more fuel; targets can be intercepted which subsonic aircraft would lack the speed to pursuit and an afterburner-dependent aircraft lack the fuel to reach."F-22 v F-35 Comparison."[tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] Air Force Association. Retrieved: 7 November 2009.
The F-22 is highly maneuverable, at both supersonic and subsonic speeds. It is extremely departure-resistant,Kopp, Carlo. "Just how good is the F-22 Raptor: Carlo Kopp interviews F-22 Chief Test Pilot, Paul Metz." Air Power Australia. Retrieved: 10 November 2012. enabling it to remain controllable at extreme pilot inputs. The Raptor's thrust vectoring nozzles allow the aircraft to turn tightly, and perform extremely high alpha (angle of attack) maneuvers such as the Herbst maneuver (or J-turn), Pugachev's Cobra, and the Kulbit. The F-22 is also capable of maintaining a constant angle of attack of over 60° while maintaining some control of roll.Peron, L. R. "F-22 Initial High Angle-of-Attack Flight Results."(Abstract)." Air Force Flight Test Center. Retrieved: 7 November 2009. During June 2006 exercises in Alaska, F-22 pilots demonstrated the significant effect of cruise altitude on combat performance, attributing the altitude advantage as a major factor in achieving an unblemished kill ratio against other fighters.Fulghum, D.A and M.J. Fabey. "F-22: Unseen and Lethal: Raptor Scores in Alaskan Exercise" (online edition)."[tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] Aviation Week. 8 January 2007. Retrieved: 28 August 2011.  The F-22's design has its engines positioned close together, so there is no room for weapons bays on the same plane as the engines; the bays were placed around and below inlet ducts.  The inlets' twisting design adds extra weight and recovery from stalls is complicated if thrust vectoring fails.Sweetman, Bill. "New moves", Aviation Week and Space Technology, August 10, 2013, p. 43.
The F-22 has a unique combination of speed, altitude, agility, sensor fusion and stealth that work together for increased effectiveness. Altitude and advanced active and passive sensors allows targets to be spotted at considerable ranges; altitude and speed increases weapons reach. Altitude increases range from ground defenses, which increases stealth's effectiveness, combined with speed, defensive systems have less time to react to an F-22.Bedard, David.

===Avionics===

Key avionics include BAE Systems E&IS radar warning receiver (RWR) AN/ALR-94,Klass, Philip J. "Sanders Will Give BAE Systems Dominant Role in Airborne EW." Aviation Week, Volume 153, issue 5, 31 July 2000, p. 74. AN/AAR-56 Infra-Red and Ultra-Violet MAWS (Missile Approach Warning System) and the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-77 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar. The RWR is a passive radar detector, more than 30 antennas are blended into the wings and fuselage for all-round coverage. Tom Burbage, former F-22 program head at Lockheed Martin, described it as "the most technically complex piece of equipment on the aircraft."  The range of the RWR (250+ nmi) exceeds the radar's, allowing radar emissions to be limited for maximized stealth. The RWR can cue the radar to track approaching targets with a narrow beam ( down to 2° by 2° in azimuth and elevation).Sweetman 2000, pp. 41–47.
The AN/APG-77 radar, designed for air superiority and strike operations, features a low-observable, active-aperture, electronically scanned array that can track multiple targets in any weather. Additionally, the radar emissions can be focused in an electronic-attack capability to overload enemy sensors."JSF-Raptor Radar Can Fry Enemy Sensors." defensenews.com. Retrieved: 7 November 2009.Retrieved: 7 November 2009.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lockheedmartin.ca/us/products/f22.html |title=F-22 Raptor |publisher=Lockheed Martin |accessdate=10 November 2012[/tpl] The AN/APG-77 changes frequencies more than 1,000 times per second to lower interception probability. The radar has an estimated range of 125–150 miles, though planned upgrades will allow a range of [tpl]convert|250|mi|km[/tpl] or more in narrow beams.
Radar information is processed by two Raytheon Common Integrated Processor (CIP)s; each CIP can process up to 10.5 billion instructions per second. Information from the radar, other sensors, and external systems is filtered by the CIP in a process known as sensor fusion; combining and processing data from multiple systems into a common view to prevent the pilot from being overwhelmed."Defense Science Board report on Concurrency and risk of the F-22 program." Dtic.mil, April 1995. Retrieved: 31 August 2011. The F-22's software has some 1.7 million lines of code, the majority involving processing radar data.Pace 1999, p. 58. In 2007, tests by Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, and L-3 Communications used the F-22's radar as a wireless data transceiver, able to transmit data at 548 megabits per second and receive at gigabit speed, far faster than the Link 16 system.Page, Lewis. "F-22 superjets could act as flying Wi-Fi hotspots." The Register, 19 June 2007. Retrieved: 7 November 2009.
The F-22 has a threat detection and identification capability comparative with the RC-135 Rivet Joint. The F-22's stealth allows it to safely operate far closer to the battlefield, compensating for the reduced capability. The F-22 is capable of functioning as a "mini-AWACS", however the radar is less powerful than those of dedicated platforms such as the E-3 Sentry. The F-22 allows its pilot to designate targets for cooperating F-15s and F-16s, and determine whether two friendly aircraft are targeting the same aircraft. This radar system can sometimes identify targets "many times quicker than the AWACS". The radar is capable of high-bandwidth data transmission; conventional radio "chatter" can be reduced via these alternative means. The IEEE-1394B data bus developed for the F-22 was derived from the commercial IEEE-1394 "FireWire" bus system.Philips, E.H. "The Electric Jet." Aviation Week, 5 February 2007.

===Cockpit===

The F-22 features a glass cockpit with all-digital flight instruments. The primary flight controls are a force-sensitive side-stick controller and a pair of throttles. The USAF initially wanted to implement direct voice input (DVI) controls; however this was judged to be too technically risky and abandoned.Goebel, Greg.

The F-22 has a complex life support system. Components include the on-board oxygen generation system (OBOGS), protective pilot garments, and a breathing regulator/anti-g valve controlling flow and pressure to the pilot's mask and garments. The protective garments are designed to protect against chemical/biological hazards and cold-water immersion, to counter g-forces and low pressure at high altitudes, and to provide thermal relief. It was developed under the Advanced Technology Anti-G Suit (ATAGS) project."A preliminary investigation of a fluid-filled  ECG-triggered anti-g suit", February 1994 Suspicions regarding the performance of the OBOGS and life support equipment have been raised by several mishaps, including a fatal crash.Majumdar, Dave.

===Armament===

The Raptor has three internal weapons bays: a large bay on the bottom of the fuselage, and two smaller bays on the sides of the fuselage, aft of the engine intakes.Pace 1999, pp. 65–66. It can carry six medium range missiles in the center bay and one short range missile in each side bay;"Technologies for Future Precision Strike Missile Systems – Missile/Aircraft Integration." Handle.dtic.mil. Retrieved: 26 September 2010. Four of the medium range missiles can be replaced with two bomb racks that can each carry one medium-size or four smaller bombs. Carrying armaments internally maintains its stealth capability and lowers drag for higher top speeds and longer range. Missile launches require the bay doors to be open for less than a second, hydraulic arms push missiles clear of the aircraft; this is to reduce vulnerability to detection and to deploy missiles during high speed flight."LAU-142/A AMRAAM Vertical Eject Launcher AVEL."[tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl] es.is.itt.com.

While the F-22 typically carries its weapons internally, the wings include four hardpoints, each rated to handle [tpl]convert|5000|lb|kg|abbr=on[/tpl]. Each hardpoint has a pylon that can carry a detachable 600 gallon fuel tank or a launcher holding two air-air missiles. However, the use of external stores has a detrimental effect on the F-22's stealth, maneuverability and speed. The two inner hardpoints are "plumbed" for external fuel tanks; the hardpoints can be jettisoned in flight so the fighter can maximize its stealth after exhausting external stores.Pace 1999, pp. 71–72.

===Stealth===

The stealth of the F-22 is due to a combination of factors, including the overall shape of the aircraft, the use of radar absorbent material, and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return."F-22 Stealth." GlobalSecurity.org. Retrieved: 21 February 2007. However, reduced radar cross section is one of five facets of presence reduction addressed in the designing of the F-22.

The F-22 reportedly relies less on maintenance-intensive radar absorbent coatings than previous stealth designs like the F-117. These materials are susceptible to adverse weather conditions.Fulghum, David A. "Away Game" Aviation Week. 8 January 2007. Retrieved: 25 July 2009. Unlike the B-2, which requires climate-controlled hangars, the F-22 can undergo repairs on the flight line or in a normal hangar.

The effectiveness of the stealth characteristics is difficult to gauge. The RCS value is a restrictive measurement of the aircraft's frontal or side area from the perspective of a static radar. When an aircraft maneuvers it exposes a completely different set of angles and surface area, potentially increasing visibility. Furthermore, stealth contouring and radar absorbent materials are chiefly effective against high-frequency radars, usually found on other aircraft. Low-frequency radars, employed by weather radars and ground warning stations, are alleged to be less affected by stealth technologies and are thus more capable as detection platforms.Sprey, Pierre. "Interview," 22 June 2008.Weiner, Tim. Blank Check: The Pentagon's Black Budget. New York: Warner Books, 1990. ISBN 978-0-44639-275-4.

==Operational history==

===Designation and testing===

The YF-22 was originally given the unofficial name "Lightning II", after the World War II fighter P-38, by Lockheed, which persisted until the mid-1990s when the USAF officially named the aircraft "Raptor". The aircraft was also briefly dubbed "SuperStar" and "Rapier"."Military Aircraft Names." Aerospaceweb.org. Retrieved: 26 September 2010. In September 2002, Air Force leaders changed the Raptor's designation to F/A-22, mimicking the Navy's McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet and intended to highlight a planned ground-attack capability amid debate over the aircraft's role and relevance. The F-22 designation was reinstated in December 2005, when the aircraft entered service."U.S. to Declare F-22 Fighter Operational." Agence France-Presse, 15 December 2005.
Flight testing began with Raptor 4001, the first engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) jet, in 1997. Nine F-22s would participate in the EMD and flight testing program.[tpl]cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/f-22-testfly.htm |title=F-22 Flight Test |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-16[/tpl] Raptor 4001 was retired from flight testing in 2000 and subsequently sent to Wright-Patterson AFB for survivability testing, including live fire testing and battle damage repair training.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.codeonemagazine.com/gallery_slideshow.html?fa44c7e5ba83d833e4ac50ea5bc58dd6=2&gallery_id=129&gallery_style=3 |title=F-22 Milestones - Part 2 |publisher=Code One Magazine |date= |accessdate=2013-11-16[/tpl] Several EMD F-22s have been used for testing upgrades, and also as maintenance trainers.[tpl]cite web|author=7 May 2013 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/the-dewline/2013/05/raptor-4007-starts-testing-inc/ |title=Raptor 4007 starts testing Inc 3.2A upgrade on its 1000th sortie |publisher= Flightglobal.com |date=2013-05-07 |accessdate=2013-11-16[/tpl]
In May 2006, a released report documented a problem with the F-22's forward titanium boom, caused by defective heat-treating.  This made the boom on roughly the first 80 F-22s less ductile than specified and potentially shortened the part's life. Modifications and inspections were implemented to the booms to restore life expectancy."F-22 design problems force expensive fixes". Air Force Times, 12 November 2007.

In the exercises, the Raptor-led Blue Force amassed 241 kills against two losses in air-to-air combat; neither Blue Force loss was an F-22. During Red Flag 07-1 in February 2007, 14 F-22s of the 94th FS supported Blue Force strikes and undertook close air support sorties. Against superior numbers of Red Force Aggressor F-15s and F-16s, 6–8 F-22s maintained air dominance throughout. No sorties were missed because of maintenance or other failures, a single one F-22 was judged lost against the defeated opposing force.[tpl]#tag:ref|The F-22 was "lost" when a victim exited the area, regenerated and immediately re-engaged; the pilot had erroneously assumed it was still "dead".|group=N[/tpl] F-22s also provided airborne electronic surveillance.Schanz, Marc V.
