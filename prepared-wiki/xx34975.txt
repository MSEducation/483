==History==

The land now occupied by Wyrrabalong National Park was first inhabited by the Darkinjung people and the Awabakal people, the Indigenous Australians. The Darkinjung occupied the southern section and The Awabakal occupied the northern section. It is believed Europeans first discovered the Tuggerah Lakes in 1796. It was found by Governor of Tasmania, Colonel David Collins, who had arrived on the First Fleet, during the search for an escaped convict, Mary Morgan, who was said to be living with the Aborigines to the North of the Hawkesbury River.[tpl]cite web | title=theentrancetcm.com.au | work=Who Found Tuggerah Lake? | url=http://www.theentrancetcm.com.au/history/who_found.html | accessdate=18 July 2006[/tpl]
