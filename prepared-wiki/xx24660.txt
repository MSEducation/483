Yabasic (Yet Another BASIC) is a free and open source BASIC interpreter for Windows and Unix platforms.[tpl]cite web|author=Marc-Oliver Ihm |url=http://www.yabasic.de |title=Yabasic, Yet another Basic for Unix and Windows |publisher=Yabasic.de |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22[/tpl] Yabasic was originally developed by Marc-Oliver Ihm, who released the last stable version 2.763 in 2005. As a continuation of the project, version 3 is now developed by a team centered around Pedro Sá and Thomas Larsen. The Yabasic interpreter is quite compact at about 250 kilobytes total.

==History==

Yabasic started as a very simple interpreter around May 1995. When it was released as version 1.0 it lacked many features like arrays and loops. In summer 1996, Yabasic was ported to the Win32 platform (Version 2.0). Further improvements were the addition of subroutines and libraries (summer 1999, version 2.57), and graphic capabilities.
In August 2007, Ihm stated that "probably (he) will not develop Yabasic any further (beyond version 2.763) within the foreseeable future", due to a lack of time. Sá and Larsen have revived the project, and currently work on Yabasic 3,Wiki of the developer team for Yabasic 3 www.basicprogramming.org and on releasing bugfixes for version 2.763.Yabasic::Dev Article Future of Yabasic www.basicprogramming.org Several beta releases of version 3 have been released since December 2009.Announcement: Yabasic 3 beta release (2.9.5) Thomas H. Larsen, via basicprogramming.org forum, 26 November 2009, forum.basicprogramming.org
As of February 2014, Ihm has updated the original version of Yabasic in January 2014 with regard to bugfixes and its toolchain and has stated his intent to keep it up to date with regard to maintenanceOfficial Yabasic website while no new version of Yabasic 3 has been published by Larsen despite his announcement to do so on 24 December 2013.Yabasic 3 website of Thomas Larsen

==Features==

Passing of arguments is always by value, except for arrays, which are always passed by reference.
The interpreter is very lenient in syntactical matters—for example, both color and colour are legal variants for the same command. Likewise, there are a number of different versions for if and for constructs, giving the programmer freedom of choice in their design.

===Yabasic 3===

The most significant change from version 2 to version 3 is the introduction of user-defined data types.Tutorial on how to create UDTs in Yabasic 3 www.basicprogramming.org
Yabasic's idiosyncratic way of accessing system variables with peek and poke-commands has been dropped in favour of reserved variable names. Old-style BASIC control flow features (goto, gosub, labels) are no longer supported. Declaration of variables prior to use can optionally be enforced.

==Examples==

The classic Hello World program looks like this in Yabasic,
 print "Hello World"
The following example will calculate prime numbers,
 print "This program will calculate the prime numbers below the limit"
 input "limit: " limit
 n=2
 do
   for i=2 to sqrt(n)
     if (frac(n/i)=0) then
       notprime=1
       break
     endif
   next i
   if notprime<>1 then
     print n
   endif
   notprime=0
   n=n+1
   if n>limit break
 loop

===Self-modifying code===

String variables can be compiled into program code at runtime, allowing for self-modifying code.
For example, the sequence
 x$= "sub printme() \n print \"Hello world!\" \n end sub"
 compile(x$)
would create a new procedure,
 sub printme()
  print "Hello world!"
 end sub
while the program is running. This procedure can from this point on be invoked in either the 'traditional' way,
 printme()
or via the slightly more clever:
 y$= "printme()"
 execute(y$)

==Other versions==

===Flyab===

A port of Yabasic to the Fltk toolkit called "Flyab" was under development.  It would have been source-compatible with programs written in yab, a variant of Yabasic that enables graphical programs to be written using the BeOS API. Ports for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux were planned. Flyab added the ability to Yabasic to create native graphical user interfaces on all supported platforms.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl] As of November 2008, the project appears to be halted.

===PlayStation 2===

Sony also packaged a version of Yabasic for the PlayStation 2 with PS2 consoles in PAL territories.
