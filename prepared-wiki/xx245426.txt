Elephants Only Talk Occasionally is the first of three studio albums released by EOTO. It was recorded in the studio in Boulder, CO. Before EOTO had ever played a live show.http://tribes.tribe.net/eoto/thread/0b717af3-6e19-4c25-a500-2b8e6c65a40f The title of the album has been speculated  to be a reference to a recently found form of communication among elephants, which involves the creation of subsonic tones (15–35 Hz) that can be picked up by distant neighboring herds.
