==History==

===Early Years===

Mudcrutch was formed in 1970 by Tom Petty and Tom Leadon, who had been playing together in a band called the Epics.  Mudcrutch's lineup consisted of Tom Petty (bass and vocals), Tom Leadon (guitar and vocals), Jim Lenehan (lead vocals), Randall Marsh (drums) and Mike Campbell (guitar). Leadon and Lenehan left the band in 1972 and were replaced by bassist/guitarist/vocalist Danny Roberts.  Keyboardist Benmont Tench also joined the band. Ricky Rucker was a part of the band for a short time.  Mudcrutch served as the house band at Dub's Lounge in its hometown of Gainesville, Florida.
In 1974, Mudcrutch signed with Shelter Records and re-located to Los Angeles, California.  The band released one single, "Depot Street," in 1975, which failed to chart.  After Danny Roberts left the group, Tom invited Charlie Souza to take over on bass guitar and the band continued recording in Leon Russell's Tulsa Studio, and later at Leon's Encino California home. The band's record company broke them up in late 1975.  Petty, Campbell and Tench went on to form The Heartbreakers in 1976 with fellow Gainesville natives Stan Lynch and Ron Blair.DeYoung, Bill.
