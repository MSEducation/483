CATEGORIES: 2003 singles, Skin songs

"Purple" is the third release from Skin's second album Fake Chemical State. It has only been released on CD in The Netherlands but was set for release elsewhere in Europe later in 2006; however, the single release outside of the Netherlands never occurred. A download EP is available from the iTunes Store to most audiences. The CD single features live-acoustic tracks from a recent radio broadcast for 3FM in The Netherlands. The song was originally planned to contain much darker music, but was changed at the last moment. Skin has stated that it is her favourite song from Fake Chemical State[tpl]fact|date=June 2009[/tpl], and it is a firm favourite amongst fans[tpl]weasel word|date=June 2009[/tpl].
