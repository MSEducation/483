Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport [tpl]Airport codes|TPE|RCTP[/tpl] is an international airport serving the capital city of Taiwan, Taipei, and the northern parts of the country. Located about 40 km from Taipei in Dayuan Township, Taoyuan County, Taiwan, the airport is Taiwan's largest airport.  It is one of five Taiwanese airports with regular international flights, and is by far the busiest international air entry point amongst them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.immigration.gov.tw/immigration/FileSystem/Statistics/02%20%20Entry%20990430.xls|title=實際入境人數－按入境地點分 Entry Persons - By Arriving Point|publisher=National Immigration Agency|accessdate=2010-06-09[/tpl] It is the main international hub for China Airlines and EVA Air.
The airport opened for commercial operations in 1979 and is an important regional trans-shipment center, passenger hub, and gateway for destinations in China and the rest of Asia.  The airport was formerly known as Chiang Kai-shek International Airport (CKS International Airport) until the name was changed in 2006 to its current name.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2006/09/07/2003326501|title=`Chiang Kai-shek' airport enters dustbin of history|publisher=Taipei Times|date=2006-09-07|accessdate=2010-06-07[/tpl]
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport is one of two airports that serves Taipei and northern Taiwan; the other, Taipei Songshan Airport, is located within Taipei City limits and served Taipei as its international airport until 1979. Songshan now mainly serves chartered flights, most of which are to and from mainland China (see cross-strait charter), domestic flights, and some international flights.
Taiwan Taoyuan handled a total of 30,701,987 passengers and 1,571,814,300 kg of freight in 2013. The airport is the 13th busiest airport worldwide in terms of international passengers number and 10th busiest in terms of international freight traffic.

==Origin of the name==

The airport, originally planned as Taoyuan International Airport, bore the name of late President Chiang Kai-shek until 2006. In Chinese, its former name was literally "Chung-Cheng (Zhongzheng) International Airport", where Chung-Cheng is the legal given name which Chiang Kai-shek had used since the 1910s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/2007/12/17/135199/De-Chiang-ization-demonizes.htm|title=De-Chiang-ization demonizes Ma|publisher=The China Post|date=2007-12-17|accessdate=2010-07-10[/tpl] In Taiwan, Chiang Kai-shek is associated with the Chinese Nationalist Party or Kuomintang and its many years of one-party authoritarian rule. Local officials in Taoyuan County and members of the Pan-Green Coalition often referred to the hub by the name originally associated with it: "Taoyuan International Airport".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2006/new/sep/2/today-fo1.htm|title=當年啟用前11天… 桃園機場硬被改名中正|publisher=Liberty Times|date=2006-09-02|accessdate=2010-07-10[/tpl] News organizations and local residents sometimes combined the two commonly used names as "Taoyuan Chung-Cheng Airport."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nownews.com/2005/02/06/327-1751550.htm|title=濃霧影響　中正機場一度停止起降　旅客行程大亂|publisher=NOWnews|date=2005-02-06|accessdate=2010-07-10[/tpl]
The Executive Yuan of then-President Chen Shui-bian's administration officially approved the name Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport for the hub on September 6, 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cna.com.tw/eng/cepread.php?id=200609060048|title=Signboard replacement to reflect airport name-change gets underway|date=2006-09-06|accessdate=2006-09-06[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/06/asia/AS_GEN_Taiwan_Airport_Name.php|title=Cabinet approves new name for Taiwan's main international airport|date=2006-09-06|accessdate=2006-09-06[/tpl]ATVnews (Hong Kong, Traditional Chinese)BBC (Traditional Chinese) The opposition Kuomintang, which together with its political allies held a one-vote majority in the Legislative Yuan, decried the change and proposed "Taiwan Taoyuan Chiang Kai-shek International Airport" instead.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cna.com.tw/eng/cepread.php?id=200609010046|title=CKS AIRPORT SHOULD BE RENAMED 'TAIWAN TAOYUAN CKS AIRPORT': KMT|date=2006-09-01|accessdate=2006-09-03[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The disagreement, like those affecting the names of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall and other Taiwan landmarks, stands as another manifestation of the trend known as Taiwan localization among pan-Green officials and desinicization by Pan-Blue Coalition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=3&art_id=qw1157098862938B235&set_id=|title=Taipei airport name change removes China link|publisher=iOL|date=2006-09-01|accessdate=2010-07-10[/tpl] The media in mainland China has always referred to the airport as "Taoyuan International Airport" so as to avoid mentioning Chiang Kai-shek.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2010[/tpl] Despite the name change, the airport is still known as Chiang Kai-Shek (CKS) International Airport in all official records of IATA.

==History==

In the 1970s, the original airport in Taipei City — Taipei Songshan Airport — had become overcrowded and could not be expanded due to space limitations. Thus, a new airport was planned to alleviate congestion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.rti.org.tw/Content/GetSingleNews.aspx?ContentID=104139|title=Taiwan News Encyclopedia: Songshan Airport|publisher=Radio Taiwan International|date=2010-06-19|accessdate=2010-07-10[/tpl] The new airport opened (with Terminal 1) on February 26, 1979, as part of the Ten Major Construction Projects pursued by the government in the 1970s. The airport was originally planned under the name Taoyuan International Airport but was later changed to Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in memory of former President Chiang Kai-shek.
The airport is the main hub of China Airlines, the ROC's flag carrier, as well as EVA Air, a private airline established in 1989. Overcrowding of the airport in recent years prompted the construction of Terminal 2, which was opened on July 29, 2000, with half of its gates operational; EVA Air was the first airline to move into Terminal 2. The remaining gates opened on January 21, 2005 for China Airlines. (Making China Airlines the only airline to operate from both terminals.)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.china-airlines.com/en/other/faq-10.htm|title=About the D Concourse of Terminal 2|author=China Airlines|publisher=China Airlines|date=2005-01-25|accessdate=2006-05-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060510111448/http://www.china-airlines.com/en/other/faq-10.htm  |archivedate = 2006-05-10[/tpl] There are plans for the construction of a third terminal, which will be built to alleviate congestion in Terminals 1 and 2.
In January 2006, a Foreign Laborers' Service Center was set up[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cksairport.gov.tw/CKSeng/news/event_e_e.jsp?newsid=17|title=Opening of Foreign Laborer's Service Center|author=Chiang Kai-Shek International Airport|publisher=Chiang Kai-Shek International Airport|date=2006-01-20|accessdate=2006-05-19[/tpl] to provide airport pick-up services and serve the needs of migrant workers. There are service desks in the Arrival lobby of Terminal 1 and Terminal 2, and in the Departure lobby of Terminal 1. Service hotlines in Vietnamese, Thai, English, and Indonesian are provided.

==Terminals==

Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport currently has two terminals which are connected by two, short people movers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=702#|title=Terminal|publisher=Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|accessdate=2010-06-08[/tpl] A third terminal is planned, and a rapid transit system currently under construction will link the terminals together underground.

===Terminal 1===

Terminal 1 is the original passenger terminal of the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. The design of the building is based on the main terminal of Washington Dulles International Airport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/editorial/detail.asp?onNews=&GRP=i&id=89541|title=Why rename CKS Airport?|publisher=The China Post|date=2006-09-14|accessdate=2010-06-07[/tpl] The five-story, 169,500-m2 terminal, along with the airport, opened in 1979 to relieve the overcrowded Taipei Songshan Airport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=702|title=Termina|publisher=Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|accessdate=2010-06-07[/tpl] All international flights were moved to the airport following the completion of this terminal. Terminal 1 featured 22 gates. A row of 11 gates are located on the north end of the airfield facing the north runway and another row of 11 gates are located on the south end airfield facing the south runway. The two concourses that contained the airplane gates are linked together by a main building that contained the check-in areas, baggage claim, passport immigration areas, and security checkpoint areas. Together they form a giant "H". All gates are equipped with jetways. Gates located at the end of the concourses have one jetway and gates not located at the end of the concourses have two jetways. The terminal used to be very white in color when it first opened. As the years gradually passed, the façade and color has become more tan and yellow colored due to air pollution in Taipei.
After the completion of Terminal 2, some gates from Terminal 1 were removed to make space for Terminal 2. Currently Terminal 1 has 18 gates.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/web/english/about/about_e.jsp|title=Taipei Taoyuan International Airport- Basic Information[/tpl] Alphabetical letters were introduced when Terminal 2 was completed. The north concourse is now Concourse A and the south concourse is now Concourse B. Before Terminal 2, gates were numbered from 1 to 22. China Airlines uses Concourse A for the majority of its flights in Terminal 1, while the third largest carrier of the airport, Cathay Pacific, operates most of its flights at Concourse B.

====Terminal 1 renovation====

Terminal 1 is also currently undergoing a $57.4 million renovation[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2009/02/24/2003436880|title=Taoyuan airport's first terminal to get facelift|publisher=Taipei Times|date=2009-02-24|accessdate=2010-06-07[/tpl] consisting of an exterior facelift (designed by Japanese architect Norihiko Dan) and a renovated interior. It will also include construction of dividing walls on the east and west sides of the terminal, renovation of the arrival and departure halls, and construction of new parking garages. It will double its floor area, expand the number of check-in counters, and have enlarged shopping areas. It is expected to increase Terminal 1's capacity from 12 million to 15 million passengers per year when completed. The renovation will take place during late hours to avoid congestion during peak hours. It is scheduled to be completed in second quarter 2012.

===Terminal 2===

Terminal 2 opened in 2000 to reduce congestion in the aging Terminal 1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.taoyuan-airport.com/english/Publish.jsp?cnid=356|title=Basic Information|publisher=Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport|accessdate=2010-06-07[/tpl] Only the South Concourse had been completed by the time the terminal opened. The South Concourse alone has 10 gates, each with 2 jetways and their own security checkpoints. The North Concourse opened later in 2005, bringing the total number of gates for Terminal 2 to 20 gates; the security checkpoints were moved to a central location in front of the passport control. The 318,000-m2 facility is capable of handling 17 million passengers per year.
The Southern and Northern Concourses are also known as Concourse C and Concourse D, respectively. Terminals 1 and 2 are connected by two short people mover lines, with one from Concourse A to D, and the other from B to C. China Airlines uses Concourse D for the majority of its flights in Terminal 2 while EVA Air uses Concourse C for most of its operations.
Terminal 2 is also currently undergoing a small-scale renovation and is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.

==Operations==

The airport is operated by the Taoyuan International Airport Corporation, a company wholly owned by the Government of Taiwan. The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) is responsible for the provision of air traffic control services, certification of Taiwan registered aircraft, and the regulation of general civil aviation activities.
The airport has two parallel runways, with one 3660 meters in length and another 3350 meters in length and both 60 meters wide, enabling them to cater to the next generation of aircraft. The south runway has been given a Category I Precision Approach, while the north runway has the higher Category II Precision Approach, which allows pilots to land in only 350 metre visibility. The two runways have an ultimate capacity of over 60 aircraft movements an hour. The Airport is upgrading ATC and runways.
There are 41 frontal stands at the main passenger concourse, 15 remote stands and 25 cargo stands. The airport was the seventh busiest for passenger traffic in Asia in 2010, and the world's fourteenth busiest for cargo traffic in 2008.
The operation of scheduled air services to and from Taoyuan is facilitated by air services agreements between Taiwan and other countries. Since the opening of RCTP, the Taiwan Government has implemented a policy of progressive liberalisation of air services with the intention of promoting consumer choice and competition. Many low-cost airlines have started various regional routes to compete head-on with full-service carriers on trunk routes.
The airport's long term expansion opportunities are subject to variables. An NTD 300 billion proposal to build a third runway and a third terminal has been under feasibility study and consultation. However, building a new runway would be very expensive as it would involve a huge compensation for acquiring land.

==Airport Facilities==

===Passenger Facilities===

Transportation between Terminal 1 and 2 is provided by the TTIA Skytrain, a driverless people mover system. The train transports both passengers who have cleared security and those who have not through separate train cars.
Airport Business Center
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport recently finished developing the airports business travel center in late 2011. The facility is a three-story building located between the first and second terminals. Business travelers paying to use the travel center can drive into the airports restricted zone and park their cars directly in front of the building. This allows business travelers to arrive at the airport much closer to the actual departure time versus arriving two hours before departure time like most regular international passengers are required to do. The business center is equipped with over 15 isolated areas allowing travelers to eat their meals without any distractions or disruptions. The facility also includes a spa, sauna, and gymnasium that are available for use by travelers. However, all of these luxuries come with a one-time price tag of $8,000. Travelers who wish to use the facility must make reservations at least three days in advance. Statistics showed that 376 private jets landed and departed the airport through a six month timeframe in 2011; this is a 100 percent increase from the same time frame in 2010

It will provide a multimedia conference room, passenger lounge, private rooms and showers, spa, sauna, gym, and business centre facilities. Other services that will be provided include ground handling, baggage handling, fuelling, security, customs and flight planning. Passengers planning to utilize TYBAC must sign up (to the Taiwanese immigration service) 3 days before use.

===Baggage and cargo facilities===

The handling and transportation of mail, passenger baggage, cargo, and the operation of aerobridges and passenger stairways in Taoyuan Airport is provided by Taoyuan International Airport Services Limited (TIAS) and Evergreen Airline Services (EGAS).
