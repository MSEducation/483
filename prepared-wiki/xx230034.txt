==Chosen To Be A Soldier==

Those that become Soldiers of the Salvation Army adhere to the rules and regulations of the Salvation Army, listed in Chosen To Be A Soldier: Orders and Regulations for Soldiers of the Salvation Army. These orders and regulations together make up a manual of operations for furthering the mission on which Salvationists are engaged.
As conditions, challenges and opportunities change, orders and regulations are reviewed and amended. A recent notable trend has been towards giving territories greater discretion in applying or adapting regulations to fit their particular circumstances.  http://www.salvationist.org/extranet_main.nsf/vw_sublinks/FA9C803EA3D8448880256BBB0035DCD6?openDocument
