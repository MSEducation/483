==Etymology==

Vancouver shares its name with the larger city of Vancouver located [tpl]convert|305|mi[/tpl] north in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Both cities were named in honor of sea captain George Vancouver, although the Canadian city was incorporated 29 years after the incorporation of Vancouver, Washington. This occurred more than 60 years after the name Vancouver was first used in reference to the historic Fort Vancouver trading post on the Columbia River. City officials have periodically suggested changing the U.S. city's name to Fort Vancouver, Vancouver USA, or even Old Vancouver to reduce confusion with its northern neighbor. Many Pacific Northwest residents distinguish between the two cities by referring to the Canadian city as "Vancouver, B.C." and the United States one as "Vancouver, Washington," or "Vancouver USA." Local nicknames include: "Vantucky" (though the nickname is often used as a derogatory term)"[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-03-29/fisher-lured-to-washington-woods-offering-tax-haven#p1|title=Fisher Lured to Washington Woods Offering Tax Haven|last=Robison|first=Peter|date=29 March 2012|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=29 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|archivedate=2009-06-01 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090601093700/http://www.vanvoice.com/article/19677-vantucky-meets-tin-pan-alley |title=Vantucky meets Tin Pan Alley |publisher=vanvoice.com |date=June 1, 2009 |accessdate=2012-05-10|url=http://www.vanvoice.com/article/19677-vantucky-meets-tin-pan-alley [/tpl]http://vanvoice.com/article?articleTitle=you+know+your+from+vantucky+if...--1287789309--453--[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.oregonlive.com/clark-county/index.ssf/2011/05/cafe_offers_vantucky_strikes_back_t-shirts_humor_along_with_coffee.html| title=Cafe offers 'Vantucky Strikes Back' T-shirts, humor along with coffee|date=17 May 2011|work=The Oregonian|accessdate=5 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url= http://clarkcountyblog.com/vancouver-coffee-shop-strikes-back-and-abides-withlatest-couve-tshirt-promotion/|title=Vancouver coffee shop Strikes Back and Abides with latest Couve T-shirt promotion|date=16 May 2011|work=The Oregonian News Network|publisher=The Oregonian|accessdate=5 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stumpedinstumptown.com/2011/03/portlands-wacky-and-wonderful-neighboring-cities/|title= Portland's wacky and wonderful neighboring cities.|date=29 March 2011|work=Stumped in Stumptown|accessdate=5 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2011/jun/05/maneuver-by-council-makes-county-look-like-podunkv/|title=Maneuver by council makes county look like Podunkville (commentary)| last=Jayne| first=Greg|date=5 June 2011|work=The Columbian|accessdate=5 June 2011|quote=Because part of the impact of bringing professional baseball to town would be in helping Vancouver to shed its image as Podunkville.

==History==

The Vancouver, Washington, area was inhabited by a variety of Native American tribes, most recently the Chinook and Klickitat nations, with permanent settlements of timber longhouses.[tpl]cite web | title = History of Vancouver – Early Northwest Native People | publisher = City of Vancouver | url = http://www.cityofvancouver.us/cmo/page/early-northwest-native-people | accessdate = July 12, 2013[/tpl] The Chinookan and Klickitat names for the area were reportedly Skit-so-to-ho and Ala-si-kas, respectively, meaning "land of the mud-turtles."[tpl]cite web|url=http://gesswhoto.com/ns-chronology.html |title=– Native Sons 1900 |publisher=Gesswhoto.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-10[/tpl] First European contact was in 1775, with approximately half of the indigenous population dead from smallpox before the Lewis and Clark expedition camped in the area in 1806.  Within another fifty years, other actions and diseases such as measles, malaria and influenza had reduced the Chinookan population from an estimated 80,000 "to a few dozen refugees, landless, slaveless and swindled out of a treaty."
Meriwether Lewis wrote that the Vancouver area was "the only desired situation for settlement west of the Rocky Mountains." The first permanent European settlement did not occur until 1824, when Fort Vancouver was established as a fur trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company. From that time on, the area was settled by both the US and Britain under a "joint occupation" agreement. Joint occupation led to the Oregon boundary dispute and ended on June 15, 1846, with the signing of the Oregon Treaty, which gave the United States full control of the area. Before 1845, American Henry Williamson laid out a large claim west of the Hudson's Bay Company (including part of the present-day Port of Vancouver), called Vancouver City and properly registered his claim at the U.S. courthouse in Oregon City, before leaving for California."Images of America DOWNTOWN VANCOUVER," Pat Jollota, p 42 In 1850, Amos Short traced over the claim of Williamson and named the town Columbia City. It changed to Vancouver in 1855.HistoryLink.org Item 9101. The City of Vancouver was incorporated on January 23, 1857.[tpl]cite web | title = History of Vancouver – An Overview of Vancouver's History | publisher = City of Vancouver | url = http://www.cityofvancouver.us/history.asp?menuid=10466&submenuid=10537&itemID=16090 | accessdate = November 18, 2007[/tpl]
Based on an act in the 1859–60 legislature, Vancouver was briefly the capital of Washington Territory, before capital status was returned to Olympia, Washington by a 2–1 ruling of the territory's supreme court, in accordance with Isaac Stevens' preference and concern that proximity to Oregon might give its southern neighbor undue influence.[tpl]cite web | title = Single Vote Robbed Vancouver of State Capitol | publisher = The Columbian | url = http://www.columbian.com/history/Vancouver/vancouvercapitol.cfm | accessdate = November 18, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927174307/http://www.columbian.com/history/Vancouver/vancouvercapitol.cfm  |archivedate = September 27, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Governor Isaac Stevens selects Olympia as capital of Washington Territory on November 28, 1853. | publisher = HistoryLink.org | url = http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5054 | accessdate = November 18, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Senate Resolution 8636  | publisher = Washington State Legislature | url = http://www.leg.wa.gov/pub/billinfo/2005-06/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Resolutions/8636-City%20of%20Olympia.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = November 18, 2007[/tpl]
U.S. Army Captain (and future President) Ulysses S. Grant was quartermaster at what was then known as Columbia Barracks for 15 months beginning in September 1852. Soon after leaving Vancouver, he resigned from the army and did not serve again until the outbreak of the American Civil War. Other notable generals to have served in Vancouver include George B. McClellan, Philip Sheridan, Oliver O. Howard and 1953 Nobel Peace Prize recipient George Marshall.[tpl]cite web | title = About Vancouver's 150th Anniversary | publisher = City of Vancouver | url = http://www.cityofvancouver.us/150th.asp? | accessdate = November 18, 2007[/tpl]
Army presence in Vancouver was very strong, as the Department of the Columbia built and moved to Vancouver Barracks, the military reservation for which stretched from the river to what is currently Fourth Plain Boulevard and was the largest Army base in the region until surpassed by Fort Lewis, [tpl]convert|120|mi|km|-1[/tpl] to the north. Built on the old company gardens and skirmish range, Pearson Army Field (later Pearson Field) was a key facility, and at one point the US Army Signal Corps operated the largest spruce cut-up plant in the world to provide much-needed wood for airplanes. Vancouver became the end point for two ultra-long flights from Moscow, USSR over the North Pole. The first of these flights was performed by Valery Chkalov in 1937 on a Tupolev ANT-25RD airplane. Chkalov was originally scheduled to land at an airstrip in nearby Portland, Oregon, but redirected at the last minute to Vancouver's Pearson Airfield. Today there is a street named for him in Vancouver. In 1975 an obelisk was erected at Pearson Field commemorating this event.
Separated from Oregon until 1917, when the Interstate Bridge began to replace ferries, Vancouver had three shipyards just downstream which produced ships for World War I before World War II brought an enormous economic boom. An Alcoa aluminum plant opened on September 2, 1940, using inexpensive power from the nearby New Deal hydropower turbines at Bonneville Dam. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Henry Kaiser opened a shipyard next to the U.S. Army reserve, which by 1944 employed as many as 36,000 people in a twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week production of liberty ships, LST's, and "baby flat tops." This influx of shipyard workers boosted the population from 18,000 to over 80,000 in just a few months, leading to the creation of the Vancouver Housing Authority and six new residential developments: Fruit Valley, Fourth Plain Village, Bagley Downs, Ogden Meadows, Burton Homes and McLoughlin Heights. Each of these was later incorporated into the city, and are well-known neighborhoods, while the neighboring "shipyard city" of Vanport, Oregon, would be destroyed by the Memorial Day flood of 1948.
Vancouver has recently experienced conflicts with other Clark County communities because of rapid growth in the area. The city's first annexation more than doubled its size in 1909, with the largest annexation of 1997 adding [tpl]convert|11258|acre|km2[/tpl] and 58,171 residents.Annexation History, City of Vancouver website, accessed 2010-07-30. As a result of urban growth and the 1997 annexation, Vancouver is often thought of as split between two areas, East and West Vancouver, divided by NE Andresen Road. West Vancouver is home to downtown Vancouver and some of the more historical parts of the city, as well as recent high-density mixed-use development.
More than one-third of the Vancouver urban area's population lives in unincorporated urban area north of the city limits, including the communities of Hazel Dell, Felida, Orchards and Salmon Creek. If county leaders had approved a major annexation plan in 2006, Vancouver would have passed Tacoma and Spokane to become the state's second-largest city.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.komotv.com/stories/40936.htm |title=Annexation Would Make Vancouver State's Second Largest City |publisher=komotv.com |date=December 23, 2005 |accessdate=2012-05-10[/tpl]

==Geography and climate==

Vancouver is located at 45°38′1″ North, 122°36′11″ West (45.633743, −122.603011)[tpl]GR|1[/tpl] just north of the Columbia River, just west of where the Columbia River Gorge bisects the volcanic Cascade Range and just east of where the Willamette River enters the Columbia. The city of Vancouver[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cityofvancouver.us/ |title=City of Vancouver, Washington, USA |work=Home page |publisher=Cityofvancouver.us |date= |accessdate=2012-05-10[/tpl] is in the Western Lowlands region of Washington.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.access.wa.gov/ |title=Access Washington - Welcome to the State of Washington |work=Home page |publisher=Access.wa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-05-10[/tpl] When clouds do not blanket the Puget-Willamette trough formed by the Cascade and Coast Range, Mount Hood, Mount Saint Helens, Mount Jefferson and Mount Adams are all visible from Vancouver.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of [tpl]convert|49.86|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl], of which, [tpl]convert|46.46|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is land and [tpl]convert|3.40|sqmi|sqkm|2[/tpl] is water.[tpl]cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=2012-12-19[/tpl]
Vancouver lies just north of Portland, Oregon and shares a similar climate. Both are classified as dry-summer subtropical (Csb) on the Köppen climate classification, with certain key exceptions. High pressures east of the Cascade Range create something of a venturi effect, leading to cold east winds down the Columbia River Gorge. Unsheltered by the Willamette Valley, Vancouver has historically seen colder temperatures, including "silver thaw" storms where freezing rain cakes limbs and power lines. Such storms can paralyze Vancouver. This occasionally freezes the river, and in 1916 cut electric power in the city for almost two weeks. Rainfall occurs frequently throughout the fall, winter, and spring, but ceases around the middle of June, with dry and warm weather lasting through September. Average annual precipitation is [tpl]convert|42|in|mm[/tpl]. Heavy snowfalls are infrequent and snow often falls and doesn't stick, with major snowstorms only occurring every 2–4 years. Close proximity to the river was also a concern for flooding, before dams constricted the river, destroying features such as Celilo Falls. Periodic floods have been a nuisance, with two of the most destructive in June 1894 and May, 1948. The 1948 Memorial Day flood almost topped the Interstate Bridge's support piers and completely destroyed nearby Vanport, Oregon. Other unusual storms include the Columbus Day windstorm of 1962 and an April 5, 1972 tornado which rated F3 on the Fujita scale, striking a local school. A F1 tornado struck on January 10, 2008 just after noon causing moderate damage along a [tpl]convert|2|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] path from Vancouver Lake to the unincorporated Hazel Dell area.
Because many Vancouver residents work in Portland, there is typically significant rush hour traffic congestion on two bridges that cross the Columbia River — the Interstate Bridge and the Glenn Jackson Bridge.  In 2006 there were 278,043 weekday vehicle crossings on the two bridges.[tpl]cite web | title = Columbia River Bridge Crossings: Historical | publisher = Southwest Washington Regional Transportation Council | url = http://www.rtc.wa.gov/data/traffic/brdgawd.asp | accessdate = November 18, 2007[/tpl]

==Economy==

The Vancouver economy is characterized by border economics with neighboring Portland, Oregon. The state of Washington levies no individual or corporate income taxes and levies a property tax below the national average and a sales tax above the national median.[tpl]cite web|url=http://taxfoundation.org/state-tax-climate/washington |title=Tax Policy Washington |publisher=The Tax Foundation |date= |accessdate=2014-02-10[/tpl] The State of Oregon has even lower property taxes and no sales tax but one of the highest state income taxes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://taxfoundation.org/state-tax-climate/oregon |title=Tax Policy Oregon |publisher=The Tax Foundation |date= |accessdate=2014-02-10[/tpl] As a result, many Vancouver residents prefer to shop in neighboring Portland where they do not pay sales taxes then live and work in Vancouver where they do not pay state income tax. (Washington residents who work in Oregon must pay Oregon income tax.) For the same reasons, the city is popular with retirees. Conversely, the city is less favored by students and young adults. In 2003, 70% of workers in Vancouver worked in Clark County. There is a risk in sales tax avoidance because Washington has a use tax due on all purchases made in Oregon that are then returned to Washington. Vancouver residents "shop at their own risk" when attempting to avoid the sales tax in Washington, although the rule is rarely, if ever, enforced[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl] except for purchases requiring registration, such as motor vehicles.
The taxation and demographics of the area depresses the retail sector of Vancouver's economy.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]  Oregon has stricter development laws to protect the timber industry[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]; therefore, Vancouver tends to attract a higher proportion of the region's sprawling development. The voting base also lead to rejection of extension of Portland's light-rail system into the city for several years. In 2013, Washington transitioned away from being a control state.
The economic history of Vancouver reflects the region. Moving from a salmon- and trade-based indigenous economy by the Chinook people, the Hudson's Bay Company pioneered extractive industries such as the fur trade and timber. Subsistence agricultural gave way to market and export crops such as apples, strawberries and prunes. Largely bypassed by the railroad in the 1880s, when the Oregon Steam Navigation company would ferry trains across the river downstream from St. Helens, Oregon to Kalama, Washington, early downtown development was focused around Washington Street (where ferries arrived), lumber and Vancouver Barracks activities such as a large spruce mill for manufacturing airplanes. A 1908 railroad swing bridge across the Columbia allowed greater industrial developments such as the Standifer Shipyard during the first world war. With the Interstate Bridge and Bonneville Dam Vancouver saw an industrial boom in the 1940s, including the Kaiser shipyard and Alcoa, as well as a Boise Cascade paper mill, just west of the Interstate Bridge.[ref]

As the old-growth forests were depleted and heavy industry left the United States, Vancouver's economy has largely changed to high tech and service industry jobs, with many residents commuting to Portland. Vancouver contains the corporate headquarters for Nautilus, Inc. and The Holland (parent company of the Burgerville, USA restaurant chain).Vancouver Business Journal Book of Lists 2007, p. 24.
The Port of Vancouver USA operates a port on the Columbia River, which separates Oregon to the south and Washington to the north. It handles over 400 ocean-going vessels annually, as well as a number of barges which ply the river and its tributaries as far as Lewiston, Idaho.

===Largest employers===

According to the City's 2012 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.cityofvancouver.us/sites/default/files/fileattachments/financial_and_management_services/page/1060/cityofvancouver2012cafr.pdf |title=City of Vancouver Comprehensive Annual Financial Report |format=PDF |date= |page=186 |accessdate=2013-09-19 [/tpl] the largest employers in the city are:

===Downtown revitalization===

In 1997 the city of Vancouver decided to dedicate the next 15–20 years to redevelop and revitalize a huge portion of the downtown core. The first projects started in the early 2000s with the construction of many tall condominium structures around Esther Short park and in the Uptown Village neighborhood. The most lauded outside investment was the construction of a Hilton hotel directly across from the park. Currently the city is building a new shopping complex, including a recently finished Fred Meyer, just outside of the downtown core.
The Columbian newspaper finished building a new seven-story building adjacent to the Hilton in 2008 which due to financial strains in the company remained vacant and unused. Early in 2010, The Columbian filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and the building defaulted to Bank of America. In statement issued June 3, 2010 by City Manager Pat McDonnell, the City of Vancouver has reached a tentative agreement to purchase the former downtown Columbian office building for a fraction of the construction cost. Under the terms of the pending deal, the city will buy the two-year-old building and [tpl]convert|5.14|acre|m2[/tpl] for $18.5 million for use as a new city hall. Before giving up the building in bankruptcy, the owners of The Columbian office building had been asking $41.5 million. By making the move, the city will save $1 million annually it pays on leases to house about 300 employees in about five buildings around the city, McDonnell said in his announcement.[tpl]cite news |title=City of Vancouver agrees to buy Columbian office building for $18.5 million |author=Allan Brettman |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2010/06/city_of_vancouver_agrees_to_bu.html |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=June 3, 2010 |accessdate=April 20, 2012[/tpl]
There are plans in the future for a new development along C Street in downtown that would include a new library (opened July 2011), a new Marriott hotel and roughly 250 new condominiums. Other planned projects include:

==Education==

==Architecture and notable buildings==

Mother Joseph was one of the first architects in the region, and because of its relatively long history, Vancouver contains a variety of buildings. Homes vary from Victorians and craftsman bungalows downtown, to small wartime tract housing and ranch-styles mid-town, with rural styles and larger homes in the outer ring. In addition to the reconstructed Fort Vancouver at the Fort Vancouver National Historic Site, the city was named one of the National Register of Historic Places' "Dozen Distinctive Destinations" for 2003.[tpl]cite web | title = Quick Facts | publisher = SW Washington Convention and Visitors Bureau | url = http://www.southwestwashington.com/quick_facts.asp | accessdate = November 18, 2007[/tpl]
Other notable buildings in Vancouver include:
Many of these buildings have been re-purposed. The 1867 Slocum House, an Italianate villa style residence originally built one block south of its current location in Esther Short Park, was moved to its present location in 1966 and now houses a community theatre company.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.slocumhouse.com/?content=slocum_house_history.php |title=History |publisher=slocumhouse.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-10[/tpl] The Carnegie Library was expanded in the 1940s, becoming the Clark County Historical Museum after a new library was built in 1963. Other buildings have been torn down for urban renewal or renovated to house professional offices such as lawyers and accountants.

==Art and culture==

Vancouver has recently[tpl]When|date=April 2011[/tpl] seen a revitalization of local art and cultural events. In 2010 there was a movement among local artists to form cooperatives and meet with established local gallery owners for a monthly forum known as "Art Conversations". Much of Vancouver's art scene is located in Downtown Vancouver.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2011[/tpl]
The Kiggins Theatre located within the Downtown Vancouver Art District, was built in 1936 by architect Day Hillborn. It was named for J.P. Kiggins, an entrepreneur and politician who cut a swath through town in the early 20th century, serving as Vancouver's mayor for 15 non-consecutive years between 1908 and 1935.

==Annual events==

Since the mid-1960s, Vancouver hosted a Fourth of July fireworks display on the grounds of Fort Vancouver National Historic Site that draws many people to the city. The display routinely ran to 45 minutes, attracted up to 60,000 visitors and was broadcast on area television, one of the largest west of the Mississippi River. Due to the death of key organizer "Mister Fireworks" Jim Larson and a poor economy, the show was not held in 2009. A shorter, redesigned 2010 show charged admission and brought in approximately 35,000 people.
Late August features the Vancouver Wine and Jazz Festival in Esther Short Park, which brought 13,500 attendees and which is considered the largest jazz festival in the Pacific Northwest.[tpl]cite news|first=Melanie|title=Annual Vancouver Wine and Jazz Festival 2011|url=http://www.clarkcountylive.com/clark-county/annual-vancouver-wine-and-jazz-festival-2011|newspaper=Clark County Live|date=July 25, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Vorensburg|first=Sue|title=Vancouver Wine and Jazz Festival draws about 13,500 attendees|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2012/aug/28/vancouver-wine-and-jazz-festival-draws-about-13500/|newspaper=The Columbian|date=August 28, 2012[/tpl]

==Local media==

Vancouver is located within the Portland media market for print, radio, and television media. It does however serve as the hometown for some media.

==Transportation==

Vancouver has two interstate freeways, I-5 and I-205, both of which run north–south, across the Columbia River into Portland and toward Seattle. It also has two heavily travelled state highways within the city limits. SR 14 begins at I-5 in downtown Vancouver and makes its way east. It is a freeway all the way until Camas. SR 500 begins from I-5 at 39th Street in north Vancouver, travels east connecting with I-205, and continues east into the suburb of Orchards where the freeway terminates at Fourth Plain Boulevard, and meets with the south end of north-south-oriented 117th Ave., SR 503. A third state highway, SR 501, starts at I-5 and heads west through downtown and continues along a path that runs between the Columbia River and Vancouver Lake.  Route 501 – SR501 dead ends a few miles north of Vancouver.
The area's mass transit system is C-TRAN, the Clark County Public Transportation Benefit Area Authority, which operates 135 buses, vanpools, and paratransit vehicles. There are also a number of express routes into Portland's downtown.
In 1995, Clark County voters defeated a ballot measure that would have funded extension of Portland's MAX Light Rail system north into Vancouver.Stewart, Bill (February 8, 1995). "Clark County turns down north-south light rail." The Oregonian, p. A1. Opposition to paying for light rail was strong at that time, but slowly declined over the following several years, eventually leading Vancouver officials to begin discussing the idea again.Church, Foster (March 26, 2001). "Vancouver mayor revives discussion of light rail." The Oregonian. Meanwhile, TriMet reconstituted its planned MAX line to Vancouver as a shorter line running only within Portland, which potentially could later be extended across the river and into Clark County.  This extension of the MAX system opened in 2004 as the Yellow Line,[tpl]cite news|title= Making tracks to the MAX|first=Don|last=Hamilton|work=Portland Tribune|date=April 30, 2004|url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=23819|accessdate = August 8, 2009[/tpl] running as far north as the Portland Expo Center, approximately [tpl]convert|1|mi|km|0[/tpl] south of downtown Vancouver. Vancouver voters have rejected light rail operations monies in connection with the Columbia River Crossing proposal.http://www.columbian.com/news/2012/nov/06/voters-soundly-reject-c-tran-measure-outcome-deliv/
Vancouver has always been well served by rail; current freight railroads operating in Vancouver include the BNSF, Union Pacific, and the local shortline Lewis and Clark Railway.  Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Vancouver Station. Three routes, the Coast Starlight, the Empire Builder, and the Amtrak Cascades, serve the city.
Pearson Field, located near downtown Vancouver, is the main airport serving the city. The airport is intended primarily for general aviation without any commercial air service. The nearest commercial airport is Portland International Airport (PDX).
In 2008, Vancouver passed a citywide law requiring anyone on a wheeled device such as a bicycle, skateboard, scooter or skates to wear a helmet while on any sidewalk, street, trail or other public property. Many local cyclists opposed the law as a misuse of city funds and police efforts, as well as encroachment on personal freedoms. Despite opposition from the public, the Vancouver City Council passed the measure 5-1 with the mayor saying, "Statistics be damned. I support this."[tpl]cite news |title=Updated: Vancouver passes all-ages helmet law |url=http://bikeportland.org/2008/02/25/vancouver-passes-all-ages-helmet-law/ |work=http://bikeportland.org |date=February 25, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Vancouver city council enacts helmet law |url=http://www.columbian.com/news/localNews/2008/02/02262008_Vancouver-city-council-enacts-helmet-law.cfm |work=The Columbian |date=February 26, 2008[/tpl]
