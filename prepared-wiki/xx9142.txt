In terms of lives lost per unit of energy generated, nuclear power has caused fewer accidental deaths per unit of energy generated than all other major sources of energy generation. Energy produced by coal, petroleum, natural gas and hydropower has caused more deaths per unit of energy generated, from air pollution and energy accidents. This is found in the following comparisons, when the immediate nuclear related deaths from accidents are compared to the immediate deaths from these other energy sources, when the latent, or predicted, indirect cancer deaths from nuclear energy accidents are compared to the immediate deaths from the above energy sources,http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/ with and without Chernobyl's total predicted, by the Linear no-threshold, cancer deaths included. and when the combined immediate and indirect fatalities from nuclear power and all fossil fuels are compared, fatalities resulting from the mining of the necessary natural resources to power generation and to air pollution.[tpl]cite pmid|17876910[/tpl] - Nuclear power has lower electricity related health risks than Coal, Oil, & gas. ...the health burdens are appreciably smaller for generation from natural gas, and lower still for nuclear power. This study includes the latent or indirect fatalities, for example those caused by the inhalation of fossil fuel created particulate matter, smog induced Cardiopulmonary events, black lung etc. in its comparison.) With these data, the use of nuclear power has been calculated to have prevented a considerable number of fatalities,  by reducing the proportion of energy that would otherwise have been generated by fossil fuels, and is projected to continue to do so.[tpl]cite web|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/91/web/2013/04/Nuclear-Power-Prevents-Deaths-Causes.html |title=Nuclear Power Prevents More Deaths Than It Causes | Chemical & Engineering News |publisher=Cen.acs.org |accessdate=2014-01-24[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1021/es3051197 [/tpl]
Nuclear power plant accidents, according to Benjamin K. Sovacool, rank first in terms of their economic cost, accounting for 41 percent of all property damage attributed to energy accidents.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.enpol.2008.01.040[/tpl] However analysis presented in the international Journal, Human and Ecological Risk Assessment found that coal, oil, Liquid petroleum gas and hydro accidents have cost more than nuclear power accidents.[tpl]cite doi|10.1080/10807030802387556[/tpl]
Following the 2011 Japanese Fukushima nuclear disaster, authorities shut down the nation's 54 nuclear power plants, but it has been estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power, accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life.[tpl]cite journal|url = http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/07/is-nuclear-power-good-for-you.html |author= Dennis Normile |title= Is Nuclear Power Good for You? |journal=Science|page= 395 |volume= 337 |date= 27 July 2012|doi = 10.1126/science.337.6093.395-b|issue = 6093|ref = harv[/tpl] As of 2013, the Fukushima site remains highly radioactive, with some 160,000 evacuees still living in temporary housing, and some land will be unfarmable for centuries. The difficult Fukushima disaster cleanup will take 40 or more years, and cost tens of billions of dollars.
Forced evacuation from a nuclear accident may lead to social isolation, anxiety, depression, psychosomatic medical problems, reckless behavior, even suicide. Such was the outcome of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Ukraine. A comprehensive 2005 study concluded that "the mental health impact of Chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident to date".[tpl]cite news |url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/10/nuclear-risk-and-fear-from-hiroshima-to-fukushima/ |title=Nuclear Risk and Fear, from Hiroshima to Fukushima |author=Andrew C.

==Nuclear proliferation==

Many technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear power program have a dual-use capability, in that they can be used to make nuclear weapons if a country chooses to do so. When this happens a nuclear power program can become a route leading to a nuclear weapon or a public annex to a "secret" weapons program. The concern over Iran's nuclear activities is a case in point.[tpl]cite journal  |title=Nuclear power without nuclear proliferation? |author=Steven E. Miller & Scott D. Sagan |date=Fall 2009  |work=Dædalus |doi=10.1162/daed.2009.138.4.7  |volume=138  |issue=4  |page=7  |ref=harv [/tpl]
A fundamental goal for American and global security is to minimize the nuclear proliferation risks associated with the expansion of nuclear power. If this development is "poorly managed or efforts to contain risks are unsuccessful, the nuclear future will be dangerous". The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership is one such international effort to create a distribution network in which developing countries in need of energy, would receive nuclear fuel at a discounted rate, in exchange for that nation agreeing to forgo their own indigenous develop of a uranium enrichment program.
According to Benjamin K. Sovacool, a "number of high-ranking officials, even within the United Nations, have argued that they can do little to stop states using nuclear reactors to produce nuclear weapons". A 2009 United Nations report said that:
 the revival of interest in nuclear power could result in the worldwide dissemination of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technologies, which present obvious risks of proliferation as these technologies can produce fissile materials that are directly usable in nuclear weapons.Benjamin K. Sovacool (2011). Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy, World Scientific, p. 190.
 
On the other hand, one factor influencing the support of power reactors is due to the appeal that these reactors have at reducing nuclear weapons arsenals through the Megatons to Megawatts Program, a program which has thus far eliminated 425 metric tons of highly enriched uranium, the equivalent of 17,000 nuclear warheads, by converting it into fuel for commercial nuclear reactors, and it is the single most successful non-proliferation program to date.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/op-eds/support-of-the-megatons-to-megawatts-program |title= The Bulletin of atomic scientists support the megatons to megawatts program |accessdate=15 September 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl]
The Megatons to Megawatts Program has been hailed as a major success by anti-nuclear weapon advocates as it has largely been the driving force behind the sharp reduction in the quantity of nuclear weapons worldwide since the cold war ended. However without an increase in nuclear reactors and greater demand for fissile fuel, the cost of dismantling and down blending has dissuaded Russia from continuing their disarmament.
Currently, according to Harvard professor Matthew Bunn: "The Russians are not remotely interested in extending the program beyond 2013. We've managed to set it up in a way that costs them more and profits them less than them just making new low-enriched uranium for reactors from scratch. But there are other ways to set it up that would be very profitable for them and would also serve some of their strategic interests in boosting their nuclear exports."[tpl]cite web|author=All Things Considered |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121125743 |title=Future Unclear For 'Megatons To Megawatts' Program |publisher=Npr.org |date=2009-12-05 |accessdate=2013-06-22[/tpl]
In the Megatons to Megawatts Program approximately $8 billion of weapons grade uranium is being converted to reactor grade uranium in the elimination of 10,000 nuclear weapons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usec.com/news/megatons-megawatts-eliminates-equivalent-10000-nuclear-warheads |title=Megatons to Megawatts Eliminates Equivalent of 10,000 Nuclear Warheads |publisher=Usec.com |date=2005-09-21 |accessdate=2013-06-22[/tpl]

==Environmental issues==

Life cycle analysis (LCA) of carbon dioxide emissions show nuclear power as comparable to renewable energy sources. Emissions from burning fossil fuels are many times higher.Benjamin K. Sovacool. Valuing the greenhouse gas emissions from nuclear power: A critical survey. Energy Policy, Vol. 36, 2008, p. 2950.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf100.html |title=Energy Balances and CO2 Implications|publisher=World Nuclear Association|date=November 2005 |accessdate=2014-01-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.nei.org/keyissues/protectingtheenvironment/lifecycleemissionsanalysis/ |title=Life-cycle emissions analyses |publisher=Nei.org |accessdate=2010-08-24[/tpl]
According to the United Nations (UNSCEAR), regular nuclear power plant operation including the nuclear fuel cycle causes radioisotope releases into the environment amounting to 0.0002 mSv (milli-Sievert) per year of public exposure as a global average.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.unscear.org/docs/reports/2008/09-86753_Report_2008_GA_Report_corr2.pdf |title=UNSCEAR 2008 Report to the General Assembly |publisher=United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation |year=2008[/tpl] (Such is small compared to variation in natural background radiation, which averages 2.4 mSv/a globally but frequently varies between 1 mSv/a and 13 mSv/a depending on a person's location as determined by UNSCEAR). As of a 2008 report, the remaining legacy of the worst nuclear power plant accident (Chernobyl) is 0.002 mSv/a in global average exposure (a figure which was 0.04 mSv per person averaged over the entire populace of the Northern Hemisphere in the year of the accident in 1986, although far higher among the most affected local populations and recovery workers).

===Climate change===

Climate change causing weather extremes such as heat waves, reduced precipitation levels and droughts can have a significant impact on nuclear energy infrastructure.Dr. Frauke Urban and Dr. Tom Mitchell 2011. Climate change, disasters and electricity generation. London: Overseas Development Institute and Institute of Development Studies Seawater is corrosive and so nuclear energy supply is likely to be negatively affected by the fresh water shortage. This generic problem may become increasingly significant over time. This can force nuclear reactors to be shut down, as happened in France during the 2003 and 2006 heat waves. Nuclear power supply was severely diminished by low river ﬂow rates and droughts, which meant rivers had reached the maximum temperatures for cooling reactors. During the heat waves, 17 reactors had to limit output or shut down. 77% of French electricity is produced by nuclear power and in 2009 a similar situation created a 8GW shortage and forced the French government to import electricity. Other cases have been reported from Germany, where extreme temperatures have reduced nuclear power production 9 times due to high temperatures between 1979 and 2007. In particular:
Similar events have happened elsewhere in Europe during those same hot summers. If global warming continues, this disruption is likely to increase.

==Nuclear decommissioning==

The price of energy inputs and the environmental costs of every nuclear power plant continue long after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity. Both nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities must be decommissioned, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses. After a cooling-off period that may last as long as a century, reactors must be dismantled and cut into small pieces to be packed in containers for final disposal. The process is very expensive, time-consuming, dangerous for workers, hazardous to the natural environment, and presents new opportunities for human error, accidents or sabotage.
The total energy required for decommissioning can be as much as 50% more than the energy needed for the original construction. In most cases, the decommissioning process costs between US $300 million to US$5.6 billion. Decommissioning at nuclear sites which have experienced a serious accident are the most expensive and time-consuming. In the U.S. there are 13 reactors that have permanently shut down and are in some phase of decommissioning, and none of them have completed the process.Benjamin K. Sovacool (2011). Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy, World Scientific, p. 118-119.
Current UK plants are expected to exceed £73bn in decommissioning costs.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.edie.net/news/news_story.asp?id=15009&title=Nuclear+decommissioning+costs+exceed+%26%23163%3B73bn |title=Nuclear decommissioning costs exceed £73bn[/tpl]

==Debate on nuclear power==

The nuclear power debate concerns the controversy which has surrounded the deployment and use of nuclear fission reactors to generate electricity from nuclear fuel for civilian purposes.  The debate about nuclear power peaked during the 1970s and 1980s, when it "reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies", in some countries.Jim Falk (1982). Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power, Oxford University Press.
Proponents of nuclear energy contend that nuclear power is a sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions and increases energy security by decreasing dependence on imported energy sources. Proponents claim that nuclear power produces virtually no conventional air pollution, such as greenhouse gases and smog, in contrast to the chief viable alternative of fossil fuel.[tpl]cite news| last =Patterson| first =Thom| title =Climate change warriors: It's time to go nuclear| newspaper =CNN| date =November 3, 2013| url =http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists/index.html[/tpl] Nuclear power can produce base-load power unlike many renewables which are intermittent energy sources lacking large-scale and cheap ways of storing energy.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf10.html| title= Renewable Energy and Electricity|date=June 2010 | publisher= World Nuclear Association| accessdate= 2010-07-04 [/tpl] M. King Hubbert saw oil as a resource that would run out, and  proposed nuclear energy as a replacement energy source. Proponents claim that the risks of storing waste are small and can be further reduced by using the latest technology in newer reactors, and the operational safety record in the Western world is excellent when compared to the other major kinds of power plants.[ref]

Opponents believe that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment. These threats include the problems of processing, transport and storage of radioactive nuclear waste, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation and terrorism, as well as health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining.Greenpeace International and European Renewable Energy Council (January 2007). Energy Revolution: A Sustainable World Energy Outlook, p. 7.Giugni, Marco (2004). Social Protest and Policy Change: Ecology, Antinuclear, and Peace Movements. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong; and there have been serious nuclear accidents.Benjamin K. Sovacool. The costs of failure: A preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, 1907–2007, Energy Policy 36 (2008), pp. 1802-1820.Stephanie Cooke (2009). In Mortal Hands: A Cautionary History of the Nuclear Age, Black Inc., p. 280. Critics do not believe that the risks of using nuclear fission as a power source can be fully offset through the development of new technology. They also argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is neither a low-carbon nor an economical electricity source.Kurt Kleiner. Nuclear energy: assessing the emissions Nature Reports, Vol. 2, October 2008, pp. 130-131.Mark Diesendorf (2007).

Arguments of economics and safety are used by both sides of the debate.

==Comparison with renewable energy==

As of 2013, the World Nuclear Association has said "There is unprecedented interest in renewable energy, particularly solar and wind energy, which provide electricity without giving rise to any carbon dioxide emission. Harnessing these for electricity depends on the cost and efficiency of the technology, which is constantly improving, thus reducing costs per peak kilowatt".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Energy-and-Environment/Renewable-Energy-and-Electricity/#.Uk55wWV-9LM |title=Renewable Energy and Electricity |author=World Nuclear Association |date=September 2013 |work= [/tpl]
Renewable electricity production, from sources such as wind power and solar power, is sometimes criticized for being intermittent or variable.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/nuclear_power/2013/01/nuclear_energy_and_climate_change_environmentalists_debate_how_to_stop_global.html|title=The Pro-Nukes Environmental Movement|last=Kloor|first=Keith|date=11 January 2013|work=Slate.com "The Big Questions" Blog|publisher=The Slate Group|accessdate=11 March 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Smil |first=Vaclav |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/a-skeptic-looks-at-alternative-energy/0 |title=A Skeptic Looks at Alternative Energy - IEEE Spectrum |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date=2012-06-28 |accessdate=2014-01-24[/tpl]  However, the International Energy Agency concluded that deployment of renewable technologies (RETs), when it increases the diversity of electricity sources, contributes to the flexibility of the system. However, the report also concluded (p. 29): "At high levels of grid penetration by RETs the consequences of unmatched demand and supply can pose challenges for grid management. This characteristic may affect how, and the degree to which, RETs can displace fossil fuels and nuclear capacities in power generation."International Energy Agency (2007). Contribution of Renewables to Energy Security IEA Information Paper, p. 5.
Renewable electricity supply in the 20-50+% range has already been implemented in several European systems, albeit in the context of an integrated European grid system.Amory Lovins (2011). Reinventing Fire, Chelsea Green Publishing, p. 199. In 2012, the share of electricity generated by renewable sources in Germany was 21.9%, compared to 16.0% for nuclear power after Germany shut down 7-8 of its 18 nuclear reactors in 2011.Entwicklungen in der deutschen Strom- und Gaswirtschaft 2012[tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] BDEW (german) In the United Kingdom, the amount of energy produced from renewable energy is expected to exceed that from nuclear power by 2018,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/30/renewable-energy-nuclear-power|title=Renewable energy will overtake nuclear power by 2018, research says | location=London | work=The Guardian|first=Fiona|last=Harvey|date=2012-10-30[/tpl] and Scotland plans to obtain all electricity from renewable energy by 2020.[tpl]cite news|author=Steve Colquhoun |url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/carbon-economy/scotland-aims-for-100-renewable-energy-by-2020-20121031-28jbv.html |title=Scotland aims for 100% renewable energy by 2020 |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=2012-10-31 |accessdate=2014-01-24[/tpl] The majority of installed renewable energy across the world is in the form of hydro power.
The IPCC has said that if governments were supportive, and the full complement of renewable energy technologies were deployed, renewable energy supply could account for almost 80% of the world's energy use within forty years. Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the IPCC, said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1% of global GDP annually. This approach could contain greenhouse gas levels to less than 450 parts per million, the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/may/09/ipcc-renewable-energy-power-world |title=Renewable energy can power the world, says landmark IPCC study |author=Fiona Harvey |date=9 May 2011  |work=The Guardian |location=London[/tpl]
