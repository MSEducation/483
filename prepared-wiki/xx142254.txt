The State of Kuwait became the 111th member state of the United Nations on 14 May 1963. It is a long-standing member of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. It is also a key member of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, also known as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), along with Bahrain, Qatar, UAE, Oman and Saudi Arabia. Having modeled the GCC on the European Union, member states enjoy free trade, and citizens of GCC member states can travel to other GCC countries with their civil identification, not requiring visas.
Kuwait's relationship with its neighbors has been influenced by the Arab-Iran conflict. After the Iranian revolution of 1979, Kuwait began supporting the Arab regime of Iraq's Saddam Hussein in its subsequent eight-year war with the hardline regime of Iran. Despite prior tensions, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia provided considerable financial support to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Kuwait's ties with Iraq remained severed after the 1991 Gulf War, until the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime. Kuwait enjoys a strong relationship with Saudi Arabia, which provided considerable support for the deposed royal family of Kuwait.
Kuwait and Iran have full diplomatic and trade relations although there was tension during the Iran-Iraq war. Kuwait's ties with states that supported Saddam Hussein's invasion, such as Yemen and the Palestine Liberation Organization, remain testy, although Kuwait has always refused to establish ties with Israel. Kuwait enjoys a strong relationship with the United States, playing host to major U.S. military bases. Following U.S. leadership in the effort to liberate Kuwait, both nations have forged close political and economic relations. Although most Arab nations expressed opposition to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Kuwait supported it and provided its territory as a launching pad for the invasion.

===Military===

The Kuwait National Guard, the Kuwaiti Armed Forces, the Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior and the Kuwaiti Emiri Guard trace their original roots to the Kuwaiti cavalrymen and infantrymen that used to protect Kuwait and its wall since the early 1900s. These cavalrymen and infantrymen formed the Defense and Security Forces in metropolitan and desert areas; charged with protecting outposts outside the wall of Kuwait.
The Military of Kuwait supersedes the Politics of Kuwait in seniority and is older than the Government of Kuwait, the Constitution of Kuwait and the  National Assembly of Kuwait.
The State of Kuwait spends close to US$ 5 billion for defense. Its military consists of the Kuwaiti Army, with an estimated strength of 11,000 personnel, the Kuwaiti Navy & Coast Guard, with 2,000 naval personnel and 400 coast guards, and the Kuwaiti Air Force, with an estimated strength of 2,500 personnel. The Kuwaiti National Guard is the main internal security force. Owing to its demographics and small population, Kuwait has not been able to build a sizeably large military and therefore collaborates extensively with foreign nations to preserve its security. After liberation from Iraq, Kuwait signed long-term defense cooperation agreements with the United States, Britain and France, and purchased military equipment from Egypt, Russia and the People's Republic of China as well.
The Military of Kuwait consists principally of the Kuwaiti Army, Kuwaiti Navy & Coast Guard, Kuwaiti Air Force and the Kuwaiti Emiri Guard.http://www.mod.gov.kw/MOD/Arabic_P/index.jsp, Kuwaiti Ministry of Defense,(Section Arabic Read الجيش الكويتي) Each armed force has its own Commander who reports to the Chief of Staff of the Kuwaiti Armed Forces; the later reports to the Kuwaiti Minister of Defense who is also designated by government protocol as Deputy Prime Minister. The Kuwaiti National Guard is an independent corps of the Kuwait Armed Forces with its own indepedent Commander, who reports directly to the Kuwaiti Minister of Defense. The Kuwaiti Emiri Guard is an independent unit with its own independent Commander and is part of the Kuwaiti Armed Forces. Similarly to the Kuwaiti Emiri Guard, the Kuwait 25th Commando Brigade is an independent brigade with its own independent commander and is part of the Kuwaiti Armed Forces.
Kuwaiti Defense Forces also include the Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior which also preforms military duties. The Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior is in charge of internal (criminal, immigration, drug trafficking and other internal departments), border and costal security; each with its own Commander; reporting to the Kuwaiti Minister of Interior, who is also designated by government protocol as Deputy Prime Minister. The Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior closely coordinates operations with the Kuwaiti Armed Forces, the Kuwaiti National Guard and the Kuwaiti Emiri Guard. Unlike most countries that have different ranks amongst the respective armed forces; in Kuwait; all military ranks across Kuwaiti Defense Forces follow the same rank insignia and chevron with no separation amongst the various forces. The Kuwaiti Defense Forces rank insignia is based on the British Army rank insignia; all under alike, in defense of the Crown.
Both the Kuwaiti Minister of Defense and the Kuwaiti Minister of Interior are officially designated by protocol as Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Ministers; both reporting to His Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad Al-Sabah (1942–present), the Prime Minister of Kuwait. His Highness, the Prime Minister later reports to His Highness Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah (1937–present), the Crown Prince of Kuwait and Deputy Supreme Commander of the Military of Kuwait who reports to the Supreme Commander of the Military of Kuwait, His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah (1926–present), the Emir and Ruler of Kuwait.

Dhows, large wooden ships made from teak wood imported from India, became an indistinct part of Kuwait's maritime fleet and dhow building is still practiced in this Persian Gulf state.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kuwaitboom.com/history/eng_ver/eng_main.htm |title=The Kuwaiti history by:QUSAY ALASWAD|work=Kuwaitboom.com|accessdate=28 June 2010[/tpl]
Kuwait's architecture is largely inspired by Islamic architecture. The most prominent landmark in country, the Kuwait Towers, were designed by Swedish architect Sune Lindström and are a unique blend of traditional minaret and modern architectural designs. The National Assembly of Kuwait, another famous landmark building, was designed by the famous Danish architect Jørn Utzon and completed in 1982.
Sawt is the most prominent style of Kuwaiti music and is performed by oud (plucked lute) and mirwas (a drum), with a violin later supplementing the arrangement. The Bedouins are known for an instrument called the rubabah, while the use of oud, tanbarah (string instrument) and habban (bagpipe) are also widespread.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=27 September 2005|title=Art and Craft|work=kuwait-info.com|url=http://www.kuwait-info.com/sidepages/culture_artcraft.asp |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050405022715/http://www.kuwait-info.com/sidepages/culture_artcraft.asp |archivedate = 5 April 2005[/tpl]

===Dress===

The traditional attire for men is the dishdasha, an ankle-length garment woven from wool or cotton. This attire is particularly well-suited for Kuwait's hot and dry climate. The traditional male headdress involves the ghutrah headscarf and the agal circlet, often with a gahfiah skullcap underneath to help keep the headscarf in place. The ghutrah is a square scarf made from cotton; it may be worn differently according to the situation, but most commonly it is folded into a triangle and placed centrally on the head so that the ends hang down equally over the shoulders. The agal is a double circlet of black cord, worn on the ghutrah to hold it in place.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aware.com.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?ID=14 |title=Traditional Clothing in Kuwait & the Gulf |work=AWARE |date=16 December 2010[/tpl] Women sometimes wear the aba, a black cloak covering most parts of the body and a dress; the traditional floor-length daraa’ or the more festive thobe. A hejab headscarf is worn with this, with some adding a bushiya face veil.
Western style clothing is very popular among the youth of Kuwait.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl]

===Media===

Kuwait has one of the most vocal and transparent media in the Middle East. Though the government funds several leading newspapers and satellite channels,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kuwait-info.com/sidepages/media_over.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030620023810/http://www.kuwait-info.com/sidepages/media_over.asp|archivedate=20 June 2003|title=Kuwait Media overview|publisher=Kuwait-Info|date=20 June 2003|accessdate=14 January 2013[/tpl] Kuwaiti journalists enjoy greater freedom than their regional counterparts. The state-owned Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) is the largest media house in the country. The Ministry of Information regulates media and communication industry in Kuwait.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kuwait-info.com/sidepages/media_mininfo.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030604003647/http://kuwait-info.com/sidepages/media_mininfo.asp|archivedate=4 June 2003|title=Kuwait Media, Ministry of Information, Muhammad Abbas Abulhassan|publisher=Kuwait-Info|accessdate=14 January 2013[/tpl]

There are 16 Arabic daily newspapers besides the English newspapers. A press law forbids insulting references to God and Islamic prophet Muhammad. Another law which made leading newspaper publishers eligible for hefty fines for criticizing the ruling family was lifted in 1992. Leading newspapers continue to impose self-restraint while remaining uncritical of the emir.[tpl]cite web|url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/spring06/eisa/media.html|title=About Kuwait- Media|work=LML|accessdate=28 June 2010[/tpl] However, no such restraint is observed while criticizing the government.

===Celebrations===

Eid ul Fitr and Eid ul Adha are two of the major festivals in Kuwait. Each year, the people of Kuwait celebrate 25 and 26 February, as the national and liberation day, respectively. On 10 November 2012, Kuwait marked the golden jubilee of its constitution with a spectacular KD 4.06-million ($15-million) fireworks display, featuring 77,282 fireworks, which earned the state a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.[tpl]cite news |title=Kuwait marks golden jubilee of constitution’s ratification |author=Nawara Fattahova |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117084042/http://news.kuwaittimes.net/2012/11/11/kuwait-marks-golden-jubilee-of-constitutions-ratification-colourful-celebration-on-gulf-road/ |newspaper=Kuwait Times |date=November 14, 2012 |accessdate=November 12, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Celebrating a golden jubilee Kuwait style |author=Phil Vinter |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2231223/Celebrating-golden-jubilee-Kuwait-style-Gulf-state-spends-10million-biggest-firework-display-time.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=November 14, 2012 |accessdate=November 12, 2012[/tpl]

==Education==

The adult literacy rate in 2008 was 93.9%.[tpl]cite web|title=National adult literacy rates (15+), youth literacy rates (15–24) and elderly literacy rates (65+)|url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=210|publisher=UNESCO Institute for Statistics[/tpl] Kuwait is directing its attention towards Inclusive Education, which provides opportunity to all children, irrespective of their social class, including children with special needs. Kuwait education system is marked by several achievements in recent years. As of 2005/06 Kuwait allocates 13% of all public expenditure to education, which is comparable to the allocation of public funds to education in many OECD countries but lower than other Arab countries. For the same years the public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP was 3.9% in 2005/12 which is well below the percentage of GDP spent by OECD countries on education.
Kuwait is facing challenges in improving the quality of education at all levels and to build capacities of students' from a young age. The Ministry of Education is also making efforts to incorporate women into the educated workforce through various programs, for instance the 1989 initiative to establish daytime literacy clinics for women. The Kuwaiti government also offers full scholarships to students accepted in universities in United States, United Kingdom and other foreign institutes. The scholarships cover all aspects of life, including textbooks, health insurance, accommodation and pocket money. The Kuwait Scholarship, offering full financial and moral support to its students, has thus made Kuwait a popular destination for secondary education, as the scholarship is not exclusive to Kuwaiti citizens. The criteria of acceptance into the scholarship is the student's secondary school grade point average.
According to the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities, the top-ranking universities in the country are Kuwait University (2068th worldwide), the College of Technological Studies (2730th) and Gulf University for Science & Technology (7922th).[tpl]cite web|title=Kuwait|url=http://www.webometrics.info/en/aw/Kuwait|publisher=Ranking Web of Universities|accessdate=22 April 2014[/tpl]
