Marc Veyrat (born 8 May 1950) is a French chef from the Haute-Savoie region, who specialises in molecular gastronomy and the use of mountain plants and herbs. Although he is hardly known in the American culinary scene, he is one of the most famous chefs in the European restaurant scene.  
Veyrat is considered by some to be the best chef in the world. He obtained a total of six Michelin Stars (three stars for each of his first two restaurants). Also, he is the first cook to get the perfect grade of 20/20 in the Gault-Millau guide, for his two restaurants.
He was the owner of the restaurants la Maison de Marc Veyrat (or l'Auberge de l'Eridan) in Veyrier-du-Lac and la Ferme de mon Père in Megève.
On 24 February 2009, he announced that he would cease all of his activities at la Maison de Marc Veyrat due to his declining health. The hotel is currently being run by his children.
He started a chain of organic "fast-food" restaurants all over France called la Cozna Vera. The first one opened in Annecy in 2008 and was later closed in 2010. He has plans to build other restaurants in Épagny, Brussels, and Paris. 
His work was featured on the Discovery Channel's Discovery Atlas:France Revealed.
