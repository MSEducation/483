[[Disulfide]]

CATEGORIES: Anions, Sulfides

In chemistry, a disulfide usually refers to the structural unit composed of a linked pair of sulfur atoms.  Disulfide usually refer to a chemical compound that contains a disulfide bond, such as diphenyl disulfide, C6H5S-SC6H5.

==Inorganic vs. organic disulfides==

The disulfide anion is S22−, or −S–S−.  Sulfur is usually assigned to the reduced oxidation number −2, described as S2− and called sulfide.  It has the electron configuration of a noble gas (argon). In disulfide, sulfur is only reduced to a state with oxidation number −1. Its  configuration then resembles that of a chlorine atom.  It thus tends to form a covalent bond with another S− center to form S22− group. Oxygen also behaves similarly, e.g. in peroxides such as H2O2.  Examples:
In many cases, each of the sulfur atoms in a disulfide group is covalently bonded to a carbon atom in an organic compound, forming a disulfide bond, sometimes called a disulfide linkage or a disulfide bridge.  Examples:

==Misnomers==

Disulfide is also used to refer to compounds that contain two sulfide (S2−) centers.  The compound carbon disulfide, CS2 is described with the structural formula  i.e. S=C=S.  This molecule is not a disulfide in the sense that it lacks a S-S bond.  Similarly, molybdenum disulfide, MoS2, is not a disulfide in the sense again that its sulfur atoms are not linked.
