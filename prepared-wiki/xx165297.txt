"Hero/Heroine" is a single from Boys Like Girls' eponymous debut album. It was originally released as the first single, along with a music video, but it did not chart in its initial run at radio.
However, following the success of "The Great Escape", the band decided to re-release the song and premiered a new video for it on MTV's TRL in November, 2007. The song was certified Gold by the R.I.A.A. in late January 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Boys%20Like%20Girls&format=SINGLE&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2009&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |title=Recording Industry Association of America |publisher=RIAA |date= |accessdate=2012-02-21[/tpl]
