[[Hero Bay]]

CATEGORIES: Bays of Livingston Island

Hero Bay ([tpl]Coord|62|31|S|60|27|W|source:GNIS|display=inline,title[/tpl]) is a bay, [tpl]convert|17|nmi|km[/tpl] wide, which indents for [tpl]convert|6|nmi|km[/tpl] the northern side of Livingston Island between Cape Shirreff and Williams Point, in the South Shetland Islands. The name "Blythe Bay", originally applied to a small bay on the southeast side of Desolation Island on George Powell's chart of 1822 published by Richard Holmes Laurie, was erroneously transferred to this bay in the 1930s. This error has now been rectified and a new name approved for the feature here described. Hero Bay is named for the American sloop Hero, under Captain Nathaniel B. Palmer, which was one of the vessels of the Pendleton sealing fleet from Stonington, Connecticut, which visited the South Shetland Islands in 1820â€“21.
