==Climate==

El Alamein has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), in common with most of the Middle East and north Africa. However, like the rest of the northern coast of Egypt, its climate is slightly less hot, compared to the rest of Egypt, because of the prevailing Mediterranean Sea winds.
Alamein is also known for its unpolluted environment, air, and beaches.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]
