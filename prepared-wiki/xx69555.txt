The Liberty Bowl is an annual U.S. American college football bowl game played in late December or early January since 1959. Since 1965, the game has been held at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee. For its first five years, it was played in Philadelphia. Since 2004, the game has been sponsored by Memphis-based auto parts retailer AutoZone.

==History==

A. F. "Bud" Dudley, a former Villanova athletic-director, created the Liberty Bowl in Philadelphia in 1959. The game was played at Philadelphia's Municipal Stadium. It was the only cold-weather bowl game of its time, and was plagued by poor attendance. The inaugural game was the most successful of the five held in Philadelphia, as 38,000 fans watched Penn State beat Alabama 7â€“0 in 1959.
Atlantic City convinced Dudley to move his game from Philadelphia to Atlantic City's Convention Hall for 1964 and guaranteed Dudley $25,000. It would be the first Bowl Game played indoors. AstroTurf was still in its developmental stages and was unavailable for the game. Convention Hall was equipped with a [tpl]convert|4|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick[/tpl] grass surface with two inches of burlap underneath it (as padding) on top of concrete. To keep the grass growing, artificial lighting was installed and kept on 24 hours a day. The entire process cost about $16,000. End-zones were only 8 yards long. 6,059 fans saw Utah rout West Virginia. Dudley was paid $25,000 from Atlantic City businessmen, $60,000 from the gate, and $95,000 from television revenues, for $10,000 net profit.[tpl]cite news | first=John| last=Antonick| coauthors= | title=Unique Game | date=2005-06-22| publisher=MSNsportsNET.com| url =http://www.msnsportsnet.com/page.cfm?section=8032| work =West Virginia Mountaineers | pages = | accessdate = 2009-04-26| language = [/tpl]
Dudley moved the game to Memphis in 1965, where it has made its home at what became Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium to much larger crowds and has established itself as one of the oldest non-BCS bowls.

==Matchup==

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Liberty Bowl offered an automatic invitation to the winner of the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy, if that team was bowl eligible.[tpl]cite news | first=Jack| last=Cavanaugh| coauthors=| title=COLLEGE FOOTBALL; Boston College Surprises Army| date=1989-11-12 | publisher=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/12/sports/college-football-boston-college-surprises-army.html| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-05-04 | language = [/tpl]
Beginning in 1996, the Liberty Bowl started to affiliate itself with the newly launched Conference USA, offering its champion an automatic bid and the right to host the game. Beginning in 2005, the winner of the C-USA championship game was offered the berth.
In 1996 and 1997, the opponent for the C-USA champion was a team from the Big East. In 1998, the Liberty Bowl replaced the Holiday Bowl in a shared contract with the Cotton Bowl Classic and had second choice between the WAC champion and a team from the SEC. From 1999 to 2005, the opponent for the C-USA champion was the Mountain West champion. There were two exceptions:
In 1999, the Mountain West Conference did not have an outright champion, as three teams tied for the conference lead. The conference's bid for the game was given to [tpl]cfb link|year=1999|team=Colorado State Rams|title=Colorado State[/tpl].
The bowl's current contract, adopted in 2006, pits the winner of the C-USA championship game against the eighth pick from the SEC. The American (the successor to the Big East), is to provide its fifth-place team as an alternate if the SEC cannot fulfill the bid. The SEC was also given veto power for the bowl, and chose to use it in 2011 to block C-USA champion Southern Miss from playing Vanderbilt; instead Cincinnati got the spot and Southern Miss accepted an invitation to the Hawaii Bowl instead.UCF Knights news, scores & more for the University of Central Florida - Orlando SentinelJSilver's UConn blog: Big East Bowl lineup complete

The 2010 win by UCF was the program's first-ever bowl victory.
The 2011 game of the Liberty Bowl matched Coaches' Poll #24 Cincinnati against Vanderbilt and unlike most minor bowls aired on the broadcast network ABC rather than its cable brandmate ESPN. The game returned to December at the end of 2010 after being played on January 2 in 2009 and 2010, the only times since the bowl was founded in 1959 that it had a non-December date. (Technically there was no 2008 game, as the game after the 2008 season was played January 2, 2009.)  Cincinnati defeated Vanderbilt in a second-half comeback.
The 2012 Liberty Bowl featured a matchup between the Iowa State Cyclones (9th place in the Big 12) and the Tulsa Golden Hurricane (Conference USA champions).[ref]
