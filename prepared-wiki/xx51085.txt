[[Summation by parts]]

CATEGORIES: Summability methods, Real analysis, Lemmas

In mathematics, summation by parts transforms the summation of products of sequences into other summations, often simplifying the computation or (especially) estimation of certain types of sums. The summation by parts formula is sometimes called Abel's lemma or Abel transformation.

==Statement==

Note that summation by parts is an analogue to the integration by parts formula,
Note also that although applications almost always deal with convergence of sequences, the statement is purely algebraic and will work in any field.  It will also work when one sequence is in a vector space, and the other is in the relevant field of scalars.

==Newton series==

The formula is sometimes given in one of these - slightly different - forms
both result from iterated application of the initial formula. The auxiliary quantities are Newton series:
and

==Similarity with an integration by parts==

==Applications==

In both cases, the sum of the series satisfies:
