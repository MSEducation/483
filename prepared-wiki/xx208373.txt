Pegāh Ahmadi ([tpl]lang-fa|پگاه احمدی[/tpl]) (born 1974) is an Iranian poet, scholar, literary critic and translator of poetry.
Pegah Ahmadi was born in Tehran. She began writing poetry at the age of seven. At seventeen she made her début as a poet by the publication of a poem in the literary magazine Takāpu, edited by Mansur Kushān. Since then she has regularly contributed to literary magazines inside Iran.  She has studied Persian Literature at University of Tehran.
Pegah Ahamdi has published four books of poetry, On the Final Sol G (1999), Cadence (2001), Writing Footnotes on the Wall of the Family Home (200?), and My These Days Is Throat The actual title of this book is In Ruzhā'yam Galust (این روزهایم گلوست). The accuracy of the translation My These Days Is Throat is to be ascertained. (2004). Her fifth book of poems, To Find Faults The actual title of this book is Āhu Khāni (آهوخوانی). Since the writer of these lines is not familiar with this book, the translation To Find Faults is likely to be inaccurate. The following considerations have underlined this translation. According to Dehkhoda in Loghat'nāmeh-ye Dehkhoda (3rd Edition, Tehran University Press, 2006), Āhu (not to be confused with the same word in the meaning of Gazelle) consists of Ā and Huk, where Ā negates the meaning of Huk. Thus Āhu means Fault, Shortcoming, Error or Wrongdoing. The word Khāni refers to Khāndan, To Read. It is therefore very conceivable that Āhu Khāni refers to the disagreeable act or habit of reminding others of their shortcomings or mistakes. Whence the present translation To Find Faults. will be published in the course of this year (2008). She has further published two works of translation from English into Persian, one an anthology of the poems by Sylvia Plath, with the title The Love Song of the Insane Girl (2000), and the other, a translation of the book Haiku: Poetry Ancient and Modern, by Jakie Hardy, with the title Hundred and One Haikus, From Past to Present (2007). Ms Ahmadi's scholarly book Women's Poetry from the Beginning to the Present Day was published by Nashr-e Sāles (Sāles Publications) in 2005. The first volume of Ms Ahmadi's second scholarly book A Comprehensive Anthology of the Poetry by Iranian Women, will be published shorty by Cheshmeh Publications.
Ms Ahmadi has published over sixty articles on subject matters related to criticism of verse, theoretical issues pertaining to poetry and translation of poems in such monthly and quarterly arts and literary magazines as Dourān, Kārnāmeh, Kelk, Jahān-e Ketāb, Bokhārā, Bidār, Sabk-e Nou, Film, Zanān, Thursday Evening, Āzarang, Nāfeh, Shoukarān, Āzmā, Negāh-e Nou, Payām-e Shomāl and Pāprik.
