Yashinoshima (born 28 October 1952) is a former sumo wrestler from Tonga. He was one of six Tongan wrestlers recruited by the Asahiyama stable. He made his debut in November 1974 and reached his highest rank of Makushita 53 in March 1976. He was forced to quit sumo in September 1976 after he and his fellow Tongans refused to accept the new head of the stable following the death of the man who had recruited them.[tpl]Cite book |author=Sharnoff, Lora |title=Grand Sumo|publisher=Weatherhill |year=1993 |id=ISBN 0-8348-0283-x[/tpl]
