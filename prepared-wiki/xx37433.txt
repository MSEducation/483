Calcium oxide (CaO), commonly known as quicklime or burnt lime, is a widely used chemical compound. It is a white, caustic, alkaline crystalline solid at room temperature. The broadly used term "lime" connotes calcium-containing inorganic materials, which include carbonates, oxides and hydroxides of calcium, silicon, magnesium, aluminium, and iron predominate, such as limestone. By contrast, "quicklime"  specifically applies to a single chemical compound.
Quicklime is relatively inexpensive. Both it and a chemical derivative (calcium hydroxide, of which quicklime is the base anhydride) are important commodity chemicals.

==Preparation==

Calcium oxide is usually made by the thermal decomposition of materials such as limestone, or seashells, that contain calcium carbonate (CaCO3; mineral calcite) in a lime kiln. This is accomplished by heating the material to above [tpl]convert|825|C|F[/tpl],Merck Index of chemicals and Drugs , 9th edition monograph 1650 a process called calcination or lime-burning, to liberate a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2); leaving quicklime. The quicklime is not stable and, when cooled, will spontaneously react with CO2 from the air until, after enough time, it will be completely converted back to calcium carbonate unless slaked with water to set as lime plaster.
Annual worldwide production of quicklime is around 283 million metric tons. China is by far the world's largest producer, with a total of around 170 million tonnes per year. The United States is the next largest, with around 20 million tonnes per year.[tpl]cite book|first=M.

==Usage==

===Use as a weapon===

Historian and philosopher David Hume, in his history of England, recounts that early in the reign of Henry III, the English Navy destroyed an invading French fleet by blinding the enemy fleet with quicklime:
[tpl]quote|D’Albiney employed a stratagem against them, which is said to have contributed to the victory: Having gained the wind of the French, he came down upon them with violence; and throwing in their faces a great quantity of quicklime, which he purposely carried on board, he so blinded them, that they were disabled from defending themselves.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19212/19212-h/19212-h.htm#2H_4_0002|title=History of England| volume=I|author=David Hume|year=1756[/tpl][/tpl]
Quicklime is also thought to have been a component of Greek fire. Upon contact with water, quicklime would increase its temperature above 150 °C and ignite the fuel.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MQMGhInCvlgC&pg=PA128|page=128|title=Chemical and biological warfare: a comprehensive survey for the concerned citizen|author=Croddy, Eric |publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=0-387-95076-1[/tpl]

==Health issues==

Because of vigorous reaction of quicklime with water, quicklime causes severe irritation when inhaled or placed in contact with moist skin or eyes. Inhalation may cause coughing, sneezing, labored breathing. It may then evolve into burns with perforation of the nasal septum, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Although quicklime is not considered a fire hazard, its reaction with water can release enough heat to ignite combustible materials.CaO MSDS. hazard.com
