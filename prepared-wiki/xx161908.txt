"Wie es geht" ("How to do it", lit. "How it goes") is a punk song by Die Ärzte. It is the first track and the first single from their 2000 album Runter mit den Spendierhosen, Unsichtbarer!. The singer addresses a woman, trying several times to tell her "I love you", but keeps on ending up saying "(I just don't know) how to do it"; at the end of the song he finally manages to say the words.
The packaging of the single was made to resemble a cheap, consumer level CD-R and alludes to music piracy.
