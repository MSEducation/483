Ludwig Türck (June 22, 1810 - February 25, 1868) was an Austrian neurologist who was a native of Vienna. 
In 1836 he obtained his medical doctorate from the University of Vienna, where in 1864 he became a full professor. 
He is remembered for his pioneer investigations of the central nervous system, particularly his studies involving nerve fiber localization, direction and degeneration.http://books.google.com/books?id=Q_rO4ZFpUcgC&pg=RA1-PA284&lpg=RA1-PA284&dq=%22Ludwig+T%C3%BCrck%22+degeneration&source=bl&ots=re9IJ5wEvE&sig=96he0cFYtXjHLSqA_Bre62piFTs&hl=en&ei=5uYZSuSRC5q0NdCQhJMP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4 The human brain and spinal cord by Edwin Clarke and Charles Donald O'Malley His name is lent to the "bundle of Türck", which are uncrossed fibers forming a small bundle in the pyramidal tract. Today this bundle of fibers is usually called by its clinical name: the anterior corticospinal tract. In medical literature, the terms "Türck's bundle", "Türck's column" and "Türck's tract" are also used for the anterior corticospinal tract.http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?Turck's+bundle Mondofacto Dictionary
During the latter part of the 1850s, Türck, along with physiologist Johann Nepomuk Czermak (1828-1873) were responsible for introducing the laryngoscope into medicine. Among Türck's assistants and students in Vienna were laryngologists Karl Stoerk (1832-1899), Leopold von Schrötter (1837-1908) and Johann Schnitzler (1835-1893).
