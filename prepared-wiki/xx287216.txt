Pure Heroine was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. The album was also noted for its impact on present-day pop music and its challenge on modern-day artists.
The lead single, "Royals", was a critical and commercial success, topping the charts in Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States, where Lorde became the first solo New Zealand act to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the youngest act to do so since Tiffany's 1987 single "I Think We're Alone Now".

"Team" was released as the third single from the album and charted within the top ten of New Zealand, Canada and the United States, and also charted in the top twenty of Australia.

==Background==

From the age of 14, Lorde worked with Universal to develop her sound and artistic vision. She was signed to Universal by Scott Maclachlan when she was 13, and was initially put together with a succession of different songwriters in attempt to develop her own music, but without success. Maclachlan told HitQuarters: "Fundamentally I think she understood that she was going to write her own music but would need someone to help with the production side of it."

Lorde's debut extended play, 2013's The Love Club EP, was both a critical and commercial success. It received acclaim from music critics who also compared the EP to the work of  Sky Ferreira, Florence + the Machine, Lana Del Rey, and Grimes,[tpl]cite web|last=Christopher Monger|first=James|url=[tpl]Allmusic|class=album|id=mw0002512787|pure_url=yes[/tpl]|title=The Love Club EP – Lorde|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=7 September 2013[/tpl] and reached number one in New Zealand, number two in Australia where it was certified five times platinum for shipments of 350,000 copies,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ariacharts.com.au/chart/singles/|title=ARIA Singles Chart – 02/09/2013|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association|date=31 August 2013|accessdate=8 September 2013[/tpl] and twenty-three on the US Billboard 200.Lorde – Chart history: Billboard 200.

==Production==

Immediately prior to beginning work on Pure Heroine, Lorde stated her intentions for the debut album to be a "cohesive" work.
As with The Love Club EP, Pure Heroine was recorded with producer Joel Little at Golden Age Studios in Auckland.[tpl]cite news| url=   http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=10880718| title= Lorde: Behind the success story (+audio)| date=  2 May 2012 | work=The New Zealand Herald[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=   http://twitter.com/iamjoellittle/status/367094975277707265| title= Album's all done, am away next week but can do week after?| date = 12 August 2012[/tpl]
Initially Lorde and Little played demo's to A&R Scott Maclachlan, in which they would discuss to songs exchange comments and change some aspects of the songs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_ScottM.html#ixzz2rWCgCWfQ |title=A&R, Record Label / Company, Music Publishing, Artist Manager and Music Industry Directory |publisher=Hitquarters.com |date= |accessdate=10 March 2014[/tpl]
Recording for the album was overseen by Lorde and Little, but was described by Lorde's A&R Scott Maclachlan as being fairly short, with the majority of what Lorde played him ending up on the final edition of the album. The recording took place in a Golden Age Studios, a small studio with no extra musicians and expensive technology, and was done in less than a year. Lorde wanted to write her own music and the albums content, which she did alongside co-writer Joel Little.[tpl]cite web|author=Kate Mossman |url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/24/lorde-pop-royals-ella-yelich-oconnor |title=Lorde: 'People have treated me like a fascinating toy' | Music | The Observer |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=10 March 2014[/tpl]
Ten songs were included in the album's final track listing, with around seven or eight that had not been included. When choosing the amount of songs to include on the final track listing, Lorde and her A&R decided to keep the amount at around ten songs to avoid "filler material."
During the recording of the album, Lorde stated that she "didn’t really have a specific sound in mind when I started recording", continuing to say she listened to large amount of "hip-hop and electronic music, and also full-on top 40 pop".[tpl]cite web|last=Darwin |first=Liza |url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/meet-lorde-shes-a-talented-teenage-badass |title=Meet Lorde: She's a Talented Teenage Badass | NOISEY |publisher=Noisey.vice.com |date=27 June 2013 |accessdate=10 March 2014[/tpl] For influence she cited James Blake and minimalist music.

Later, Lorde went to show the lyrics to boyfriend, James Lowe, and stated that sharing things with her boyfriend encouraged much of the albums writing and ultimately inspired and drove her to write the majority of the album.[tpl]cite web|author=Effie Mann |url=http://www.dailylife.com.au/dl-people/five-life-lessons-from-tavis-interview-with-lorde-20140106-30cfj.html |title=Five life lessons from Tavi's interview with Lorde |publisher=Dailylife.com.au |date=6 January 2014 |accessdate=10 March 2014[/tpl]
Lorde was a collaborative producer along with Little, in which she listened to a lot of electronic music in order for her to develop a "real taste" of what she wanted the albums production to sound like.[tpl]cite web| url= http://pigeonsandplanes.com/2013/05/taking-flight-16-year-old-ella-yelich-oconnor-vs-lorde-popstar| title= Taking Flight| date= 21 May 2013[/tpl]

My vocal-scape is really important."[tpl]cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/meet-lorde-shes-a-talented-teenage-badass |title=Meet Lorde: She's a Talented Teenage Badass | NOISEY |publisher=Noisey.vice.com |date=27 June 2013 |accessdate=16 December 2013[/tpl]

The album is built around Little's heavy production noted for containing "deep bass rumbles, lilting loops and programmed beats", evoking "shadowy sonics" compared by Jason Lipshutz to that of Massive Attack and the XX. 
Critics praised the albums music and sound, particularly praising Lordes partnership with Joel Little, Clash Music praised the albums "glittering, forward-thinking pop soundscapes". Continuing to note Little's "less-is-more approach is stunningly minimal at times, and it’s vital in accentuating Lorde’s vocals and creating a focal point".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/lorde-pure-heroine |title=Lorde - Pure Heroine | Reviews | Clash Magazine |publisher=Clashmusic.com |date= |accessdate=10 March 2014[/tpl]

The album's lyrics have been said to "explore classic teen-pop themes – social anxiety, romantic yearning, debilitating ennui, booze-soaked ragers – with an eerie, zoomed-out detachment;" and be "certainly underpinby" "an adolescent aggrievance and angst." 
The albums lyrics revisits Lorde's common theme of "youth", with the album primarily being inspired by her youth and critiques of mainstream culture.Gold Teeth, White Teeth, and Lorde's 'Pure Heroine' | PopMatters
Rolling Stone wrote "Lorde's languidly aphoristic lyrics balance rock-star swagger and torqued-up teenage angst" and that her lyrics "have a rattle-nerve pathos and power like nothing else going in 2013."[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/50-best-albums-of-2013-20131202/lorde-pure-heroine-19691231 |title=50 Best Albums of 2013: Lorde, Pure Heroine |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2 December 2013 |accessdate=11 December 2013[/tpl]
The albums lyrical themes and concept are introduced immediately with the opening track of the album declaring Lorde is "bored", the themes continue throughout the album with Lorde taking aim at "pop culture" picking about the "falsity of her fellow chart toppers."[tpl]cite web|last=Maine |first=Sammy |url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/17931/reviews/4147053 |title=Album Review: Lorde - Pure Heroine / Releases / Releases // Drowned In Sound |publisher=Drownedinsound.com |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=10 March 2014[/tpl] Lorde's lyrics are noted for talking about "the mundanity of teenage life - celebrating the often ignored intelligence of the next generation." Lorde also uses metaphors mentioning teeth, using teeth to talk about the "Hollywood smile" and "our gnashers as a way to speak of unrealistic expectations set by society - ringing particularly true on the reverb-happy, military-driven 'White Teeth Teens'".
The album's lyrical content was noted as "smart" by Billboard magazine who praised the albums opening line "Don't you think that it's boring how people talk?", continuing to praise to albums closing line "Let them talk" noting a link between the albums opening and closing line.

==Songs==

The album's opening track, "Tennis Court", has been described as "older, slightly crazier cousin" of debut single "Royals". Billboard characterised "Tennis Court" as having "detached attitude, woozy production and being chopped-n-screwed", and second-song "400 Lux" (named for the illuminance of a sunset), as "femme fatale pop at its finest", including "over canyon-sized bass and popping percussion".[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/5733177/lorde-pure-heroine-track-by-track-review| title= Lorde, 'Pure Heroine': Track-By-Track Review| last= Lipshutz| first= Jason| work= Billboard| date= 25 September 2013| accessdate= 26 September 2013[/tpl] Lorde wrote the lyrics to "Royals" in only half an hour.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5687161/lorde-the-billboard-cover-story| title= Lorde: The Billboard Cover Story| first= Jason| last= Lipshutz| work= Billboard| publisher= Prometheus Global Media| date= 6 September 2013| accessdate= 6 September 2013[/tpl] She was influenced by hip hop and singer Lana Del Rey. "I was listening to a lot of rap, but also a lot of Lana Del Rey, because she’s obviously really hip-hop influenced, but all those references to expensive alcohol, beautiful clothes and beautiful cars – I was thinking, 'This is so opulent, but it’s also bullshit.'"
"Ribs" starts with an "ambient opening" and an "exhausted-sounding Lorde growing more frantic with each passing second", with the lyrics that include the singer discovering her maturity and "grown-up problems". 
"Buzzcut Season" has a "tropical paradise" style production with lyrics describing Lorde trying to remain "in blissful ignorance to the crumbling world trying to permeate through news broadcasts." The album's sixth song, "Team", contains a "crashing, synth-heavy beat" and was described by Billboard as being "darkly melodic."[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5695042/lorde-unveils-team-single-listen-to-the-royals-follow-up| title= Lorde Unveils 'Team' Single: Listen To The 'Royals' Follow-Up| last= Lipshutz| first= Jason| work= Billboard| accessdate= 13 September 2013[/tpl] Lyrically, the song touches up on her "disconnect with modern pop music" and the difference between onscreen portrayals and reality. Next, "Glory and Gore" is a song with lyrics that talk about "society's obsession with violence." "Still Sane" was praised for Lorde's voice being described as "smoky and restrained", with lyrics touching upon the "all work and no play" craziness of her rise to fame and the duality of fame and legacy". "White Teeth Teens" is a doo-wop style song that speaks on the imperfections of teenagers and the way they present themselves. "A World Alone", the album's closing track, includes a "roaring dance beat". Its lyrics speak of a world "which is composed of haters, existential musings, endless Internet chatter and the one person with whom one can escape all the judgments." About the song, Jonah Weiner of Rolling Stone wrote "describing a passionate romance, her mind can't help but jump-cut not only to the relationship's inevitable failure, but past that, to death."[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lordes-teenage-dream-20131028| title= Lorde's Teenage Dream| last= Weiner| first= Jonah| work= Rolling Stone| date= 28 October 2013| accessdate= 5 December 2013[/tpl]

==Impact==

The album was the center of praise due to its genres and take on pop. The album was praised for challenging present day pop and for challenging the music of artists including Miley Cyrus and Rihanna. Clash said, "But the popularity of Pure Heroine suggests all is not lost. It says there's still an intellectual, polished and important place for pop, that doesn't rely on open letters, open legs, Twitter, twerking and obscenely desperate electro hooks. Whether the burgeoning pressure of becoming a star will get the better of Lorde, we'll undoubtedly find out. But for now, she is most definitely our 'queen bee'."
Forbes placed Lorde on their '30 Under 30' list of young people "who are changing our world".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=11182484 |title=Lorde is 'changing our world' says Forbes - Entertainment - NZ Herald News |publisher=Nzherald.co.nz |date=7 January 2014 |accessdate=10 March 2014[/tpl] Lorde became the youngest act in the music category, with the writers of the article saying, "New Zealand's biggest star has rocketed to mainstream acclaim with debut album Pure Heroine and unexpected hit 'Royals'. She's already cashing in with a (US) $2.5 million publishing deal, and more is undoubtedly on the way." Lorde was also featured and topped Time magazine's list of the most influential teenagers in the world, with Time commenting that she was "forging her own path." Forbes also wrote in favour of the album calling it a "breakout success" stating that there is a "larger evolution on the horizon."
Pure Heroine was noted for being "cohesive and mainstream" and simultaneously "breaking barriers in terms of unachieved success and lyrical content, while maintaining universal appeal." Lorde and the album prove that "mainstream pop doesn't have to be dumb downed" to be accepted. The album was further praised for speaking for the "generation" raised in the internet age with social networks and "sites like Perez Hilton and TMZ furthering our obsession with celebrities as idols." She was also praised as one of the most prominent artists in the "post-millennial" era that has made such an "impact in popular music."http://www.themoodofmusic.com/2013/10/why-lordes-pure-heroine-might-be-album.html
