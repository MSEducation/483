Sonfjället, also written as Sånfjället (local dialect: Sôna), is a national park situated in Härjedalen, in central Sweden. It was established in 1909, making it one of Europe's oldest national parks. Following a land extension in 1989, it now covers [tpl]convert|103|km2|abbr=on[/tpl].
The mountainous area is filled with large boulders, intersected by streaming lakes. Trailing around the mountain area is also a wide spread forest area.
The park is famous for its animal fauna: a resident bear tribe, and a large elk tribe. Other animals are also common, including wolves and lynx.

==Etymology==

The national park is named after the mountain Sonfjället which reaches 1,278 meters above sea level. The exact meaning of the word son in this context is not known. It may be related to the Old West Norse word sunna, meaning Sun, and Sonfjället would thus literally mean "the sun fell".[tpl]cite book |first=Elof |last=Hellquist |year=1922 |title=Svensk etymologisk ordbok |location=Lund |publisher=Gleerups förlag|pages=826[/tpl] This theory has however been disputed and claimed to be inconsistent with the local pronunciation.Svenskt ortnamnslexikon, SOFI 2003
