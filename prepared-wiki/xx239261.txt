Daniel graduated from the University of Southern California in 2005 with a degree in economics.  He was also a track star at both the University of Oregon and USC.

==Professional life==

Unable to find a job in his chosen field after college, Daniel envisaged the plan of working a different job in a different state each week.   Not long thereafter, Daniel fulfilled his plan, each week working a job that manifested the culture and economy of the state through which he passed.  Daniel completed his last job in September 2009 and now has released an internationally bestselling book to share his experiences. He is also working on a lecture circuit and semester program for college students to help find their interests and experience the different cultures and lifestyles of America.
Daniel has parlayed his experiences into a public speaking tour. He will be speaking at Champlain College (Burlington, VT), among many others, on September 29, 2013. 

==Personal life==

Daniel grew up in Los Altos, California.
