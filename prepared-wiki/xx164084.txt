==Biography==

Mirza started his career in 1985 when he joined his brother Saeed Mirza and veteran director Kundan Shah to set a new production company called Iskra.
He made his directional debut with the 1989 television serial Circus starring Ashutosh Gowariker and Shahrukh Khan, who was a newcomer actor at the time. Since then, he has collaborated with Shahrukh Khan and Juhi Chawla in every other project in his career.
He made his first cinematic debut with Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman (1992) starring Khan and Chawla. The movie was inspired by Raj Kapoor's classic comedy Shree 420 (1955). The movie did pretty well at the box office. However, his next project, Yes Boss (1997) did fairly well at the box office and was well received overall.
In 1999, he set up a production company called Dreamz Unlimited with Juhi Chawla and Shahrukh Khan. Their first movie Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (2000) was directed by Mirza and failed to do well at the box office. However, in 2003 Mirza directed the third film out of Dreamz Unlimited, Chalte Chalte starring Khan and Rani Mukerji in lead roles. The movie was the first box office hit from this production house. After this he took a hiatus from film directing due to the death of his wife.
In 2007, Mirza returned to directing and has released his next film titled Kismat Konnection which did average business in 2008 and boasted of stars like Shahid Kapoor and Vidya Balan in lead roles.
