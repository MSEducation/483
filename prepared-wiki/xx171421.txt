[[Steady state visually evoked potential]]

CATEGORIES: Neurology

In neurology, Steady State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) are signals that are natural responses to visual stimulation at specific frequencies.  When the retina is excited by a visual stimulus ranging from 3.5 Hz to 75 Hz,Beverina F, Palmas G, Silvoni S, Piccione F and Giove S 2003 User adaptive BCIs: SSVEP and P300 based interfaces PsychNol. J. 1 331–54 the brain generates electrical activity at the same (or multiples of) frequency of the visual stimulus.  
This technique is used widely with electroencephalographic research regarding vision.  SSVEP's are useful in research because of the excellent signal-to-noise ratioD.

SSVEP is generated by stationary localized sources and distributed sources that exhibit characteristics of wave phenomena.
