Test Pilot is a 1938 film directed by Victor Fleming, starring Clark Gable, Myrna Loy and Spencer Tracy, and featuring Lionel Barrymore. The film tells the story of a daredevil test pilot (Gable), his wife (Loy), and his best friend (Tracy). 
Test Pilot was written by Howard Hawks, Vincent Lawrence, John Lee Mahin, Frank Wead and Waldemar Young. The screenplay was largely based on an original story by former naval aviator Wead.

==Plot==

Reckless test pilot Jim Lane (Clark Gable) is forced to land on a Kansas farm in his aircraft, the "Drake Bullet", where he meets Ann "Thursday" Barton (Myrna Loy). They spend the day together and fall in love. Once Jim's best friend and mechanic, Gunner Morris (Spencer Tracy), arrives, Jim ignores Ann. To spur him, she gets engaged to her sweetheart. Jim leaves in the morning, but soon comes back for her. They quickly get married.
Jim loses his job at Drake, when he clashes with the owner (Lionel Barrymore), and takes a job with another outfit, flying a very experimental aircraft. Ann soon finds out how dangerous her husband's occupation is, but she promises Gunner that she will stick to her man. Jim wins the race, but Benson, the man Drake sends in Jim's place, dies, leaving a wife and three children behind.
Jim tries to reform his ways and begins by taking a job testing aircraft, even conducting dangerous flights as he wants to give Ann a real home. Gunner remains true to his friend.[tpl]#tag:ref|Gunner has a superstitious preflight ritual of putting a piece of chewing gum on the aircraft. In The Right Stuff (1983), Jack Ridley, Chuck Yeager's best friend and engineer on his test missions, also had given him a stick of Beemans chewing gum before Yeager's test flights. This allusion to a chewing gum ritual was later included in The Rocketeer (1991)."Beemans Gum Featured In The Right Stuff." Beemans gum.

Upon reaching 30,000 feet, something goes wrong; the bomber goes into a spin and sandbags (substituting for the weight of bombs) break loose, pinning Gunner. Unwilling to bail out without his buddy, Jim manages to crash land, and pulls a badly injured Gunner out of the wreckage right before it burst into flames; but it is too late for Gunner. When Jim realizes the toll his job has taken on his wife, he gives it up.

==Production==

Test Pilot brought together three of the most "bankable" Hollywood stars of the period, but while Loy and Gable became friends, an uneasy relationship existed between Tracy and Gable. Although recognizing that the film was an "actioneer", Tracy was aware that his male co-star and tacitly, the lead of the film, was awed by acting with him, and proceeded to steal as many scenes as possible, including the lengthy "death" scene in the doomed aircraft. At the climax of another lengthy take where he was cradling his comrade's head in his arms, Gable was reported to have said, "'Die, goddamn it, Spence! I wish to Christ you would!' ” and dropped Tracy’s head with a thud.Tatara, Paul. "Test Pilot: Articles." Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: January 5, 2013.
Principal photography took place from December 1, 1937 to February 18, 1938 at MGM studios and on location at Van Nuys,  California,  Lindbergh Field (San Diego), March Field, California and at the Cleveland National Air Races, with retakes  on March 30 to early April 1938."Test Pilot: Original Print Information."Turner Classic Movies.

Test Pilot utilized authentic United States Army Air Corps airfield settings and was able to obtain rights to film using Boeing's new Y1B-17, which was destined to become the progenitor of the wartime B-17 bomber series.  The Drake Bullet was actually the SEV-S2 NR70Y, a modified civilian racer version of the U.S. Army Air Corps P-35. The other test aircraft that is flown to its top diving speed is a Northrop A-17 attack bomber."Test Pilot". Aero Files.

==Reception==

Proving to be an "audience-pleaser", becoming one of MGM's top money-makers in 1938, Test Pilot also found favor with critics, with  The New York Times review characterizing it as "... one of those irresistible MGM potboilers of the 1930s that coast along on sheer star power."Erickson, Hal.

Today, it is considered a significant aviation film by historians due to the use of contemporary aircraft.Hardwick and Schnepf 1989, p. 61. Even at the time of its release, Variety noted that the "story bespeaks authority in detail, obviously explained by the fact that Capt. Frank Wead, who authored the original, has had (a) practical aviation background.""Test Pilot." Variety, January 1, 1938. Retrieved: February 3, 2010.
Both Loy and Tracy (despite his obvious scene-stealing battles with Gable) later claimed Test Pilot was their favorite film.
