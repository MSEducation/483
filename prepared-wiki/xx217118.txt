[[Radiation monitoring]]

CATEGORIES: Radiobiology, Radioactive contamination

Radiation monitoring involves the measurement of radiation dose or radionuclide contamination for reasons related to the assessment or control of exposure to radiation or radioactive substances, and the interpretation of the results.[tpl]Cite book|title=IAEA Safety Glossary: Terminology Used in Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection |last1=International Atomic Energy Agency |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=IAEA |location=Vienna |isbn=92-0-100707-8 |pages= |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1290_web.pdf |accessdate=[/tpl]

==Environmental monitoring==

Environmental monitoring is the measurement of external dose rates due to sources in the environment or of radionuclide concentrations in environmental media.

==Source monitoring==

Source monitoring is the measurement of activity in radioactive material being released to the environment or of external dose rates due to sources within a facility or activity. 
The methodological and technical details of the design and operation of source and environmental radiation monitoring programmes and systems for different radionuclides, environmental media and types of facility are given in IAEA Safety Standards Series No. RS–G-1.8 [tpl]Cite book|title=Environmental and Source Monitoring for Purposes of Radiation Protection, IAEA Safety Standards Series No. RS–G-1.8 |last1=International Atomic Energy Agency |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=IAEA |location=Vienna |isbn= |pages= |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1216_web.pdf |accessdate=[/tpl] and in IAEA Safety Reports Series No.  64.[tpl]Cite book|title= Programmes and Systems for Source and Environmental Radiation Monitoring.
