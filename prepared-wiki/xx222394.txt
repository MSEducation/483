==Football career==

Adnane began his career in the youth system of his hometown club FC Mulhouse. After spending a decade there, he was signed by Ligue 2 club Stade Brestois 29. He only made seven appearances at the club scoring no goals before being loan out to Championnat National side SO Châtellerault for the winter, where he made 11 appearances and scored 4 goals. Following his return to Brest, he was again loaned out, this time for two years to AS Cherbourg. Adnane adjusted well with the Normandy-based side scoring 34 goals in 50 matches over two league seasons.
After his two spectacular seasons with Cherbourg, Ligue 1 club SM Caen secured his services for the 2008–09 season. Adnane appeared in 14 matches for the season and, for the 2009–10 season, was signed by Angers SCO. Adnane's stint with Angers was brief appearing in 12 matches and scoring one goal during the first half of the season. In the second half of the season, Adnane was loaned out to third division club Évian. He scored ten goals on nine appearances helping the club win National and earn promotion to Ligue 2 for the first time in the club's history. On 10 July 2010, Adnane was signed on a permanent three-year deal with Évian.
In July 2013, Adnane was given a trial at Seattle Sounders in the Major League Soccer but he was not offered a contract. Next month, he joined Tours in Ligue 2.
