His relationship with his Assyrian counterpart, Tukultī-apil-Ešarra,Synchronistic king list, KAV 216, Ass 14616c, ii 17 and fragment KAV 12, VAT 11338, 5ff. was antagonistic and he launched a raid early in his reign into Assyria, capturing the cultic idols of Adad and Šala from Ekallāte, a town only around thirty miles from Assur. For his part, Tukultī-apil-Ešarra led several retaliatory raids into the heartland of Babylonia, recalled with typical bombastic rhetoric:
[tpl] quotation|I marched to the land of Karduniaš. I conquered the cities Dūr-Kurigalzu, Sippar of Šamaš, Sippar of Anunitu, Babylon and Upi, the great shrine of Karduniaš, including their fortresses. I massacred them in great number. I plundered countless amounts of their booty. I conquered the palaces of Babylon belonging to Marduk-nādin-aḫḫē, the king of Karduniaš, and I burned them with fire. Twice I drew up a battle line of chariots against Marduk-nādin-aḫḫē, the king of Karduniaš, and I defeated him.[tpl] cite book | title = The ancient Near East: historical sources in translation | author = Kyle Greenwood | editor = Mark William Chavalas | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | year = 2006 | page = 156 [/tpl]|Tukultī-apil-Ešarra|Building Inscription, lines 37 to 40.Weidner’s “Text II”, AfO 18 (1957-58) pp. 347ff.

The Synchronistic History recalls the battles were in the first instance “by the Lower Zab, opposite Ahizûhina, and in the second year he defeated Marduk-nadin-ahhe at Gurmarritu, which is upstream from Akkad.”Synchronistic History ii 14-24, preserved in three copies, K 4401a + Rm 854, K 4401b and Sm 2106. Although “Ugarsallu (immediately south of the Lesser Zab) he plundered as far as Lubda (located in the area of Arrapha). He ruled every part of Suhu (in the middle Euphrates Valley) as far as Rapiqu (southern border of Assyria),” these places are on the periphery of Babylonia and the idols were not recovered until centuries later:

There are seven kudurrus, two building inscriptions, four Luristan daggers, oneLuristan dagger ME 123060.

One,Aradsu, son of Rišnunak, Kudurru BM 90938, published as BBSt 25. issued by Aradsu, son of Rišnunak, grants independence from forced labor for the residents living near the mouth of the Ṣalmani Canal, dated to his first year. Another gives land to a certain Adad-zer-iqiša in grateful thanks for his efforts fighting the Assyrians and is dated to his 10th year. One of the witnesses is given as Abullu-tetaparâu, the son of the king of Babylon. Another,Kudurru IM 90585, ii 10. dated to his 13th year, confirms the ownership of seven GUR of arable land to a certain Iqīša-Ninurta and is witnessed in the city of Opis.[tpl] cite journal | title = A neglected Kudurru or boundary stone of Marduk-Nādin-Aḫḫē? | author = A.

Another kudurruThe Warwick Kudurru, Warwickshire Museum. dated eight months earlier in the same year granted Iddin-Ninurta, a leather worker, two GUR of land and was witnessed by the same seven officers of royal service: Irība-Ištarān, the governor of Isin, Bābilāiu, the chamberlain, Eulmaš-šākin-šumi, the marshall, Marduk-andulli, the vizier, Enlil-mukîn-apli, the commandant, Ea-kudirri-ibni, the provincial governor and Nabû-nādin-aḫḫē, the overseer of the storehouse. As this was from Kār-Bēl-mātāti, a town probably in the vicinity of Babylon, it is thought the men were courtiers who accompanied the king in his travels.[tpl] cite journal | title = The Warwick Kudurru | author = W.

Another is a deed recording Marduk-naṣir’s purchase of land from Amêl-Enlil, son of Khanbi, for a chariot, saddles, two asses, an ox, grain, oil, and certain garments.[tpl] cite book | title = Babylonian boundary-stones and memorial tablets in the British Museum | author = L.

[tpl] quotation|As to the rains which have been so scanty this year that no harvests were reaped, it is a good omen for the life and vigour of the king, my lord. Perhaps, the king, my lord, will say: “Where did you find (this)? Tell me!” In a report by Ea-mušillim to his lord Marduk-nādin-aḫḫē, it is written: “If a sign occurs in the sky that cannot be cancelled, and if it happens to you that rains become scanty (maqāt zunnē), make the king undertake a campaign against the enemy: he will be victorious wherever he goes and his days will be long.”[tpl] cite book | title = Letters from Assyrian Scholars to the Kings Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal: Commentary and Appendix No. 2 | author = Simo Parpola | publisher = Eisenbrauns | year = 2009 | pages = 375–376 [/tpl]|Akkullanu, Ashurbanipal’s astrologer|LAS 110 + 300, reverse 1 to 1183-1-18,61 + Ki 1904-10-9,59 99030.

Sadly, it was not to be, as he seems to have lost his throne and “disappeared” (šadâ ēmid) following the disruptions caused by Arameans migrating into Mesopotamia under the pressure from famine, the Babylonians themselves apparently resorting to cannibalism, "....they ate one another's flesh..."Assyrian chronicle fragment 4, VAT 10453, 2f.
