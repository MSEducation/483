Ethernet [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|θ|ər|n|ɛ|t[/tpl] is a family of computer networking technologies for local area networks (LANs). Ethernet was commercially introduced in 1980 and standardized in 1983 as IEEE 802.3.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://standards.ieee.org/news/2013/802.3_30anniv.html|title=IEEE 802.3 'Standard for Ethernet' Marks 30 Years of Innovation and Global Market Growth|publisher=IEEE|date=June 24, 2013|accessdate=January 11, 2014[/tpl] Ethernet has largely replaced competing wired LAN technologies such as token ring, FDDI, and ARCNET.
The Ethernet standards comprise several wiring and signaling variants of the OSI physical layer in use with Ethernet. The original 10BASE5 Ethernet used coaxial cable as a shared medium. Later the coaxial cables were replaced with twisted pair and fiber optic links in conjunction with hubs or switches. Data rates were periodically increased from the original 10 megabits per second to 100 gigabits per second.
Systems communicating over Ethernet divide a stream of data into shorter pieces called frames. Each frame contains source and destination addresses and error-checking data so that damaged data can be detected and re-transmitted. As per the OSI model Ethernet provides services up to and including the data link layer.
Since its commercial release, Ethernet has retained a good degree of compatibility. Features such as the 48-bit MAC address and Ethernet frame format have influenced other networking protocols.

==History==

Ethernet was developed at Xerox PARC between 1973 and 1974.[tpl]cite video |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5MezxMcRmk |title=The History of Ethernet |publisher=NetEvents.tv |date=2006 |accessdate=September 10, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_687626 |title=Ethernet Prototype Circuit Board |year=1973 |publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of American History |accessdate=September 2, 2007[/tpl] It was inspired by ALOHAnet, which Robert Metcalfe had studied as part of his PhD dissertation.[tpl]cite book |title=The Second Information Revolution |author=Gerald W. Brock |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=September 25, 2003 |isbn=0-674-01178-3 |page=151[/tpl] The idea was first documented in a memo that Metcalfe wrote on May 22, 1973, where he named it after the disproven luminiferous ether as an "omnipresent, completely-passive medium for the propagation of electromagnetic waves".[tpl]Cite journal|publisher=The Register |title=Ethernet — a networking protocol name for the ages: Michelson, Morley, and Metcalfe |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/03/13/metcalfe_remembers/page2.html |accessdate=March 4, 2013 |date=March 13, 2009 |author=Cade Metz |page=2[/tpl][tpl]Cite web |title=Inventors of the Modern Computer |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa111598.htm |author=Mary Bellis |publisher=About.com |accessdate=September 10, 2011[/tpl] In 1975, Xerox filed a patent application listing Metcalfe, David Boggs, Chuck Thacker, and Butler Lampson as inventors.[tpl]US patent|4063220[/tpl] "Multipoint data communication system (with collision detection)" In 1976, after the system was deployed at PARC, Metcalfe and Boggs published a seminal paper.[tpl]Efn|The experimental Ethernet described in the 1976 paper ran at 2.94 Mbit/s and had eight-bit destination and source address fields, so the original Ethernet addresses were not the MAC addresses they are today.[tpl]cite journal |title= Evolution of the Ethernet Local Computer Network |author1= John F.

Shoch [/tpl] By software convention, the 16 bits after the destination and source address fields specified a "packet type", but, as the paper says, "different protocols use disjoint sets of packet types". Thus the original packet types could vary within each different protocol. This is in contrast to the EtherType in the IEEE Ethernet standard, which specifies the protocol being used.[/tpl]
Metcalfe left Xerox in June 1979 to form 3Com. He convinced Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Intel, and Xerox to work together to promote Ethernet as a standard. The so-called "DIX" standard, for "Digital/Intel/Xerox", specified 10 Mbit/s Ethernet, with 48-bit destination and source addresses and a global 16-bit Ethertype-type field. It was published on September 30, 1980 as "The Ethernet, A Local Area Network. Data Link Layer and Physical Layer Specifications".[tpl]Cite journal |url=http://ethernethistory.typepad.com/papers/EthernetSpec.pdf |date=30 September 1980 |title=The Ethernet, A Local Area Network.

Formal standardization efforts proceeded at the same time and resulted in the publication of IEEE 802.3 on June 23, 1983.
Ethernet initially competed with two largely proprietary systems, Token Ring and Token Bus. Because Ethernet was able to adapt to market realities and shift to inexpensive and ubiquitous twisted pair wiring, these proprietary protocols soon found themselves competing in a market inundated by Ethernet products, and, by the end of the 1980s, Ethernet was clearly the dominant network technology. In the process, 3Com became a major company. 3Com shipped its first 10 Mbit/s Ethernet 3C100 transceiver in March 1981, and that year started selling adapters for PDP-11s and VAXes, as well as Multibus-based Intel and Sun Microsystems computers.[tpl]cite book |title=Switched, Fast, and Gigabit Ethernet |year=1999 |author=Robert Breyer & Sean Riley |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=1-57870-073-6[/tpl][tpl]rp|9[/tpl] This was followed quickly by DEC's Unibus to Ethernet adapter, which DEC sold and used internally to build its own corporate network, which reached over 10,000 nodes by 1986, making it one of the largest computer networks in the world at that time.[tpl]cite book |title=Digital at Work |author=Jamie Parker Pearson |year=1992 |publisher=Digital Press |isbn=1-55558-092-0 |page=163[/tpl] An Ethernet adapter card for the IBM PC was released in 1982, and, by 1985, 3Com had sold 100,000.
Since then, Ethernet technology has evolved to meet new bandwidth and market requirements.[tpl]Cite journal|url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4211609/Shifts-growth-ahead-for-10G-Ethernet |title=Shifts, growth ahead for 10G Ethernet |publisher=E Times |date=December 20, 2010 |author=Rick Merritt |accessdate=September 10, 2011[/tpl] In addition to computers, Ethernet is now used to interconnect appliances and other personal devices.

==Standardization==

In February 1980, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) started project 802 to standardize local area networks (LAN).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ieeeusa.org/policy/policy/2001/01aug27IEEE802.pdf |title=Letter to FCC |author=Vic Hayes |date=August 27, 2001 |quote=IEEE 802 has the basic charter to develop and maintain networking standards... IEEE 802 was formed in February 1980... |accessdate=October 22, 2010[/tpl] The "DIX-group" with Gary Robinson (DEC), Phil Arst (Intel), and Bob Printis (Xerox) submitted the so-called "Blue Book" CSMA/CD specification as a candidate for the LAN specification. In addition to CSMA/CD, Token Ring (supported by IBM) and Token Bus (selected and henceforward supported by General Motors) were also considered as candidates for a LAN standard. Competing proposals and broad interest in the initiative led to strong disagreement over which technology to standardize. In December 1980, the group was split into three subgroups, and standardization proceeded separately for each proposal.[tpl]cite journal |last=von Burg |first=Urs |last2=Kenney |first2=Martin |title=Sponsors, Communities, and Standards: Ethernet vs. Token Ring in the Local Area Networking Business |journal=Industry & Innovation |date=December 2003 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=351–375 |doi=10.1080/1366271032000163621 |url=http://hcd.ucdavis.edu/faculty/webpages/kenney/articles_files/Sponsors,%20Communities,%20and%20Standards:%20Ethernet%20vs.%20Token%20Ring%20in%20the%20Local%20Area%20Networking%20Business.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66LCgXKhx |archivedate=2012-03-21 |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 February 2014[/tpl]
Delays in the standards process put at risk the market introduction of the Xerox Star workstation and 3Com's Ethernet LAN products. With such business implications in mind, David Liddle (General Manager, Xerox Office Systems) and Metcalfe (3Com) strongly supported a proposal of Fritz Röscheisen (Siemens Private Networks) for an alliance in the emerging office communication market, including Siemens' support for the international standardization of Ethernet (April 10, 1981). Ingrid Fromm, Siemens' representative to IEEE 802, quickly achieved broader support for Ethernet beyond IEEE by the establishment of a competing Task Group "Local Networks" within the European standards body ECMA TC24. As early as March 1982 ECMA TC24 with its corporate members reached agreement on a standard for CSMA/CD based on the IEEE 802 draft.[tpl]rp|8[/tpl] Because the DIX proposal was most technically complete and because of the speedy action taken by ECMA which decisively contributed to the conciliation of opinions within IEEE, the IEEE 802.3 CSMA/CD standard was approved in December 1982. IEEE published the 802.3 standard as a draft in 1983 and as a standard in 1985.IEEE 802.3-2008, p.iv
Approval of Ethernet on the international level was achieved by a similar, cross-partisan action with Fromm as liaison officer working to integrate International Electrotechnical Commission, TC83 and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) TC97SC6, and the ISO/IEEE 802/3 standard was approved in 1984.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]

==Evolution==

Ethernet evolved to include higher bandwidth, improved media access control methods, and different physical media. The coaxial cable was replaced with point-to-point links connected by Ethernet repeaters or switches to reduce installation costs, increase reliability, and improve management and troubleshooting. Many variants of Ethernet remain in common use.
Ethernet stations communicate by sending each other data packets: blocks of data individually sent and delivered. As with other IEEE 802 LANs, each Ethernet station is given a 48-bit MAC address. The MAC addresses are used to specify both the destination and the source of each data packet. Ethernet establishes link level connections, which can be defined using both the destination and source addresses. On reception of a transmission, the receiver uses the destination address to determine whether the transmission is relevant to the station or should be ignored. Network interfaces normally do not accept packets addressed to other Ethernet stations. Adapters come programmed with a globally unique address.[tpl]Efn|In some cases, the factory-assigned address can be overridden, either to avoid an address change when an adapter is replaced or to use locally administered addresses.[/tpl] An EtherType field in each frame is used by the operating system on the receiving station to select the appropriate protocol module (e.g., an Internet Protocol version such as IPv4). Ethernet frames are said to be self-identifying, because of the frame type. Self-identifying frames make it possible to intermix multiple protocols on the same physical network and allow a single computer to use multiple protocols together.[tpl]cite book |author=Douglas E.

Despite the evolution of Ethernet technology, all generations of Ethernet (excluding early experimental versions) use the same frame formats[tpl]cite web|author=Iljitsch van Beijnum|title=Speed matters: how Ethernet went from 3Mbps to 100Gbps... and beyond|url=http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/07/ethernet-how-does-it-work/3/|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=July 15, 2011|quote=All aspects of Ethernet were changed: its MAC procedure, the bit encoding, the wiring... only the packet format has remained the same.[/tpl] (and hence the same interface for higher layers), and can be readily interconnected through bridging.
Due to the ubiquity of Ethernet, the ever-decreasing cost of the hardware needed to support it, and the reduced panel space needed by twisted pair Ethernet, most manufacturers now build Ethernet interfaces directly into PC motherboards, eliminating the need for installation of a separate network card.[tpl]cite web |url=http://pcquest.ciol.com/content/search/showarticle.asp?artid=63428 |title=Motherboard Chipsets Roundup |publisher=PCQuest |date=November 1, 2004 |author=Geetaj Channana |quote=While comparing motherboards in the last issue we found that all motherboards support Ethernet connection on board. |accessdate=October 22, 2010[/tpl]

===Shared media===

Ethernet was originally based on the idea of computers communicating over a shared coaxial cable acting as a broadcast transmission medium. The methods used were similar to those used in radio systems,[tpl]Efn|There are fundamental differences between wireless and wired shared-medium communications, such as the fact that it is much easier to detect collisions in a wired system than a wireless system.[/tpl] with the common cable providing the communication channel likened to the Luminiferous aether in 19th century physics, and it was from this reference that the name "Ethernet" was derived.[tpl]cite book |title=Ethernet: The Definitive Guide |author=Charles E. Spurgeon |publisher=O'Reilly |isbn=978-1-56592-660-8 |year=2000[/tpl]
Original Ethernet's shared coaxial cable (the shared medium) traversed a building or campus to every attached machine. A scheme known as carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) governed the way the computers shared the channel. This scheme was simpler than the competing token ring or token bus technologies.[tpl]Efn|In a CSMA/CD system packets must be large enough to guarantee that the leading edge of the propagating wave of the message got to all parts of the medium before the transmitter could stop transmitting, thus guaranteeing that collisions (two or more packets initiated within a window of time that forced them to overlap) would be discovered. Minimum packet size and the physical medium's total length were, thus, closely linked.[/tpl] Computers were connected to an Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) transceiver, which was in turn connected to the cable (later with thin Ethernet the transceiver was integrated into the network adapter). While a simple passive wire was highly reliable for small networks, it was not reliable for large extended networks, where damage to the wire in a single place, or a single bad connector, could make the whole Ethernet segment unusable.[tpl]Efn|Multipoint systems are also prone to strange failure modes when an electrical discontinuity reflects the signal in such a manner that some nodes would work properly, while others work slowly because of excessive retries or not at all. See standing wave for an explanation. These could be much more difficult to diagnose than a complete failure of the segment.[/tpl]
Through the first half of the 1980s, Ethernet's 10BASE5 implementation used a coaxial cable [tpl]convert|0.375|in[/tpl] in diameter, later called "thick Ethernet" or "thicknet". Its successor, 10BASE2, called "thin Ethernet" or "thinnet", used a cable similar to cable television cable of the era. The emphasis was on making installation of the cable easier and less costly.
Since all communications happen on the same wire, any information sent by one computer is received by all, even if that information is intended for just one destination.[tpl]Efn|This "one speaks, all listen" property is a security weakness of shared-medium Ethernet, since a node on an Ethernet network can eavesdrop on all traffic on the wire if it so chooses.[/tpl] The network interface card interrupts the CPU only when applicable packets are received: The card ignores information not addressed to it.[tpl]Efn|Unless it is put into promiscuous mode.[/tpl] Use of a single cable also means that the bandwidth is shared, such that, for example, available bandwidth to each device is halved when two stations are simultaneously active.
Collisions happen when two stations attempt to transmit at the same time. They corrupt transmitted data and require stations to retransmit. The lost data and retransmissions reduce throughput. In the worst case where multiple active hosts connected with maximum allowed cable length attempt to transmit many short frames, excessive collisions can reduce throughput dramatically. However, a Xerox report in 1980 studied performance of an existing Ethernet installation under both normal and artificially generated heavy load. The report claims that 98% throughput on the LAN was observed.[ref]
