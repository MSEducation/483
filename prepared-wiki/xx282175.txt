===Critical response===

Film critic Bosley Crowther had morality problems with the script, writing, "We might also note that the acting of Richard Conte in the principal role and of Sam Jaffe, Royal Dano, Richard Taber and John McIntire is good. But we can't for the life of us figure any reason for such an aimless tale, except to indulge in bleak sadism. The marksmanship is infinitely better than the film."Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, February 23, 1951. Accessed: August 10, 2013.
Time Out magazine liked the acting in the film, "No forgotten masterpiece, but a neat little crime thriller, ingeniously plotted by George Zuckerman ... Worth watching for the admirable Conte, the Florida locations, and fitful direction by Tetzlaff, a fine cameraman (My Man Godfrey, Notorious) who never quite hit his director's stride again after the excellent The Window in 1949."Time Out London.
