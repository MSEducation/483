==History==

Founded in 1956, the college grew slowly, adding academic programs over several decades. Originally lacking a campus, academic programs were scattered and held where ever space could be found. In 1997, Donald Wenz was named the college's tenth president, and launched a "Campaign for Renewal" to purchase and renovate the old Woolworth's building in downtown Lebanon. The building was made into the main campus center for the college. In 2008 a second [tpl]convert|11000|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] building, to house the new and existing health and science courses and programs, was acquired. That same year, bachelors degrees in nursing and radiography were authorized by the State. Students will enter the new 4-year degrees in 2009.
In 1980 a small endowment of $100,000 was fund raised. http://www.lebanoncollege.edu/pdf/Newsletters/Lebanon%20College07-Winter.pdf In 2006, on the institution's 50th anniversary, the college launched a "Campaign for the Future", an effort to raise $3 million to establish an endowment. Former surgeon general C. Everett Koop is the campaign's honorary chairman. http://www.lebanoncollege.edu/pdf/campaign%20catalog.pdf
