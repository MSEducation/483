San Diego State University, College of Arts & Letters
The College of Arts and Letters provides liberal arts education at San Diego State University (SDSU). Its programs in the humanities and social sciences are offered through nineteen (19) academic departments and a number of interdisciplinary programs, each of which is designed to help students understand their role in society and to develop aesthetic sensibilities. With three hundred (300) permanent faculty and many associated lecturers, the College is the largest of the seven (7) colleges and is responsible for over one-third (1/3) of the instruction at the SDSU. Because the College occupies an important role in General Education, virtually all SDSU students take courses offered by the College.
