Ida Orloff (also written Ida Orlov, pseudonym of Ida Siegler von Eberswald; 16 February 1889 â€“ 9 April 1945) was an Austrian actress of silent film and the stage. She starred in the classic Danish silent film Atlantis which was based upon the 1912 novel by Gerhardt Hauptmann. It was discovered years later that Orloff had been a secret lover and an inspirational muse for Hauptmann, who won the 1912 Nobel Prize for Literature.
On 9 April 1945, while the Battle of Vienna was raging only a few miles away, Ida Orloff committed suicide at her home in the suburb of Tullnerbach.
