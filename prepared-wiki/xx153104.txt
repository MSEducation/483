National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER) is a higher education institute located in Mohali focusing on education and research in the pharmaceutical sciences.

==Academics==

NIPER offers Masters and Doctoral programs in various fields of the pharmaceutical sciences.

===System of Studies===

The course duration of Masters programs is four semesters, while the doctoral programs typically take six to ten semesters depending on the subject area of research. A scholar has to take a minimum number of credits offered from various departments depending on the program and branch of study. The Research, its presentation, and defense carry their own credits reflected in the final Cumulative Graded Point Average (CGPA).

====Admissions====

Every year in June and July NIPER conducts national level entrance examinations for admissions to its M.S.(Pharm)/M.Tech/M.Pharm., MBA(Pharm.) and PhD programs. Candidates interested in MBA (Pharmaceutical Management) and the doctoral programs are further screened by personal interview.
The candidates are required to have qualified the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) or now Graduate Pharmacy Aptitude Test (GPAT) in a suitable subject area, although exceptions are allowed for some applicants/programs. Now GATE in Pharmacy discipline has been replaced by GPAT and pharmacy graduate has to qualify the GPAT. The entrance examination is conducted at Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chandigarh, New Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Nagpur and Pune. Depending on the rank secured in the entrance examination and number of seats offered in a department, the applicants get to opt for their choice in a counseling session. NIPER also has reservation for SC, ST, Physically Handicapped and Kashmiri Migrant candidates.
Exam for doctoral program is subject and/or department specific. For doctoral studies, normally the PI has sufficient funding to support the student, but in its absence a fellowship via the National Eligibility Test conducted by the University Grants Commission or such student support schemes makes the applicant's case strong.
