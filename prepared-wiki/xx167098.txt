[[Mourning ring]]

CATEGORIES: Rings, Death customs

A mourning ring is a finger ring worn in memory of someone who has died.  It often bears the name and date of death of the person, and possibly an image of them, or a motto. They were usually paid for by the person commemorated, or their heirs, and often specified, along with the list of intended recipients, in wills.  Any stone is usually in black, typically Jet stone.  They were  popular  in Victorian times, and earlier; such as this example of a ring commemorating Jeremy Bentham.  In many cases, there is a lock of hair of the deceased placed under the crystal stone.
