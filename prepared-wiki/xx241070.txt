John Pyne (died 1679) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1625 and 1653. He supported the Parliamentary cause during the English Civil War, but fell out with Oliver Cromwell during the Interregnum. At the Restoration he was exempted from the general pardon.

==Life==

Pyne was the son of Thomas Pyne and his wife Amey Hanham, daughter of Thomas Hanham, serjeant-at-law, of Wimbome Minster,  Dorset.Burke, p. 1242 
In 1625, Pyne was elected Member of Parliament for Poole. He was re-elected in 1626 and 1628 and sat until 1628 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years.[tpl]Cite Notitia Parliamentaria|converted=1|part=2|pages=229–239[/tpl] In 1629, his father already dead, he succeeded to the estates of his grandfather in  several counties including the manors of Crewkerne and Little Windsor.
In April 1640, Pyne was re-elected MP for Poole in the Short Parliament,  and he was elected again for Poole in the Long Parliament in November 1640. In 1643 he was listed as a colonel of the militia raised for the сounty of Somerset, a commissioner for levying taxes for the parliament. Though a strong republican, and an opponent of the Church and churchmen, he withdrew from taking any part as soon as he saw what he thought were the ultimate designs of Oliver Cromwell, and he strongly disapproved of the trial and death of King Charles I. 
Pyne refused also to join any of the plots and conspiracies from the death of the Protector to the restoration of the monarchy under King Charles II. However he was one of the twenty persons excepted out of the Act of Oblivion.
Pyne succeeded at last in obtaining the pardon of himself and eldest son (then 27 years of age), which was signed at Breda in 1660. His circumstances appear to have been much reduced as a result of the civil wars, and he seems to have sold and encumbered his property to pay off debts, and perhaps to meet fines and penalties, the consequence of his part in it. Pyne died  in 1679 at a "very advanced age".

==Family==

Pyne married Eleanor Hanham, daughter of Sir John Hanham, of the City of London, and of Wimborne, Dorset. She was possessed of a good fortune and various estates and died  1662, aged 43, leaving him with four sons and two daughters. In 1668, Pyne married for the second time, to Amey, daughter of John White, of Tharnhull, who died in 1692, leaving no children. 
Pyne disinherited his eldest son, John Pyne, who died unmarried, at Pitney, in 1696  and lost his second son Arthur at Aleppo. His estates therefore went to his third son Charles.
