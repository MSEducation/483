New Town Plaza  is a shopping mall in the town centre of Sha Tin in Hong Kong, China. Developed by Sun Hung Kai Properties, it was the biggest shopping mall in the New Territories of Hong Kong when it was completed in the early 1980s. Covering 200,000 square metres (49.4 acres), the plaza comprises Phase 1 (the main mall) and Phase 3, which are connected to each other, as well as the Grand Central Plaza, which is less than one kilometre from Phase 1. Phase 1 underwent extensive renovation from 2003 to 2008. The nine-storey main mall is right next to Sha Tin Station and Citylink Plaza. Until now, it remains one of the busiest shopping malls in Hong Kong. There are many different transportation links to New Town Plaza, such as shuttle services from nearby estates, minibus routes, the MTR station located right within the plaza itself, and so forth.
