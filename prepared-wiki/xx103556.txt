[[Outro]]

An outro (sometimes spelled outtro or extro) is the conclusion or epilogue to a piece of music, work of literature, television program, or video game.  It is the opposite of an intro. "Outro" is a blend or portmanteau as it replaces the element "in" of the "intro" with its opposite, to create a new word. Slang for a musical coda.
