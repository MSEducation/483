CATEGORIES: Rivers of New Hampshire, Saco River

The East Fork of the East Branch of the Saco River is a 2.2 mile long (3.6Â km)New Hampshire GRANIT state geographic information system stream in the White Mountains of New Hampshire in the United States.  It is a tributary of the East Branch of the Saco River, with its waters ultimately flowing to the Atlantic Ocean in Maine. 
The East Fork rises on the western slopes of North and South Baldface, two rocky summits that each stand over [tpl]convert|3500|ft[/tpl] above sea level, in the eastern part of the White Mountain National Forest.  The stream flows south, entering the town of Jackson, and joins the East Branch of the Saco in a broad valley between Sable Mountain to the east and Black Mountain to the west.
