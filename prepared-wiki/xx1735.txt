[[Culture of Canada]]

CATEGORIES: Canadian culture

Canadian culture is a term that embodies the artistic, culinary, literary, humour, musical, political and social elements that are representative of Canada and Canadians. Throughout Canada's history, its culture has been influenced by European culture and traditions, especially British and French, and by its own indigenous cultures.[tpl]cite book|author1=Sana Loue|author2=Martha Sajatovic|title=Encyclopedia of Immigrant Health|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zQUd4W_mK1UC&pg=PA337|year= 2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4419-5655-2|page=337[/tpl] Over time, elements of the cultures of Canada's immigrant populations have become incorporated into mainstream Canadian culture.[tpl]cite book|author1=Paul R.

Canada's federal government has influenced Canadian culture with programs, laws and institutions. It has created crown corporations to promote Canadian culture through media, such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and promotes many events which it considers to promote Canadian traditions. It has also tried to protect Canadian culture by setting legal minimums on Canadian content in many media using bodies like the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).[tpl]cite web |author=National Film Board of Canada |authorlink=National Film Board of Canada|url=http://www.nfb.ca/atonf/organisation.php?v=h&lg=en |title=Mandate of the National Film Board |year=2005|accessdate=March 15, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060421170854/http://www.nfb.ca/atonf/organisation.php?v=h&lg=en |archivedate = April 21, 2006[/tpl]

==Development of Canadian culture==

===Historical influences===

The British conquest of New France and subsequent immigration, during the mid-18th century brought the large Francophone population under British rule, creating a need for compromise and accommodation. The migration of 46,000 United Empire Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies during the American Revolution (1775–1783) brought loyalist influences.

===Evolution of legislation===

French Canada's early development was relatively cohesive during the 17th and 18th centuries, and this was preserved by the Quebec Act of 1774, which allowed Roman Catholics to hold offices and practice their faith. In 1867, the Constitution Act was thought to meet the growing calls for Canadian autonomy while avoiding the overly strong decentralization that contributed to the Civil War in the United States. The compromises reached during this time between the English- and French-speaking Fathers of Confederation set Canada on a path to bilingualism which in turn contributed to an acceptance of diversity.[tpl]cite book|author=François Vaillancourt, Olivier Coche|title=Official Language Policies at the Federal Level in Canada:costs and Benefits in 2006|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QCZm8op2bjQC&pg=PA11|publisher=The Fraser Institute|page=11|id=GGKEY:B3Y7U7SKGUD[/tpl] The English and French languages have had limited constitutional protection since 1867 and full official status since 1969.

===Identity===

Canada's large geographic size, the presence of a significant number of indigenous peoples, the conquest of one European linguistic population by another and relatively open immigration policy have led to an extremely diverse society. As a result the issue of Canadian identity remains under scrutiny, perhaps more than the identity of the people of any other modern nation.MacGregor, p.39 Journalist and professor Andrew Cohen wrote in 2007:
[tpl]Quote|The Canadian Identity, as it has come to be known, is as elusive as the Sasquatch and Ogopogo.

The question of Canadian identity was traditionally dominated by three fundamental themes: first, the often conflicted relations between English Canadians and French Canadians stemming from the French Canadian imperative for cultural and linguistic survival; secondly, the generally close ties between English Canadians and the British Empire, resulting in a gradual political process towards complete independence from the imperial power; and finally, the close proximity of English-speaking Canadians to the United States.[tpl]cite book|author=Martin N.

===Nationalism and protectionism===

In general, Canadian nationalists are highly concerned about the protection of Canadian sovereignty and loyalty to the Canadian State, placing them in the civic nationalist category.

===Literature===

Canadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively.[tpl]cite book|author=W. J. Keith|title=Canadian literature in English|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rGawhTGpGK0C&pg=PA19|year= 2006|publisher=The Porcupine's Quill|isbn=978-0-88984-283-0|page=19[/tpl] Canada’s early literature, whether written in English or French, often reflects the Canadian perspective on nature, frontier life, and Canada’s position in the world, for example the poetry of Bliss Carman or the memoirs of Susanna Moodie and Catherine Parr Traill. These themes, and Canada's literary history, inform the writing of successive generations of Canadian authors, from Leonard Cohen to Margaret Atwood.
By the mid-20th century, Canadian writers were exploring national themes for Canadian readers. Authors were trying to find a distinctly Canadian voice, rather than merely emulating British or American writers. Canadian identity is closely tied to its literature. The question of national identity recurs as a theme in much of Canada's literature, from Hugh MacLennan's Two Solitudes (1945) to Alistair MacLeod's No Great Mischief (1999). Canadian literature is often categorised by region or province; by the socio-cultural origins of the author (for example, Acadians, Aboriginal peoples, LGBT, and Irish Canadians); and by literary period, such as "Canadian postmoderns" or "Canadian Poets Between the Wars."
