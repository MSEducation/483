The École Polytechnique Massacre, also known as the Montreal Massacre,  occurred on December 6, 1989 at the École Polytechnique in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Twenty-five-year-old Marc Lépine, armed with a legally obtained Mini-14 rifle and a hunting knife, shot twenty-eight people before killing himself. He began his attack by entering a classroom at the university, where he separated the male and female students. After claiming that he was "fighting feminism" and calling the women "a bunch of feminists," he shot all nine women in the room, killing six. He then moved through corridors, the cafeteria, and another classroom, specifically targeting women to shoot. Overall, he killed fourteen women and injured ten other women and four men in just under twenty minutes before turning the gun on himself.Sourour, Teresa K., (1991) Report of Coroner's Investigation (PDF).

Lépine was the son of a French-Canadian mother and an Algerian father, and had been physically abused by his father. His suicide note claimed political motives and blamed feminists for ruining his life. The note included a list of nineteen Quebec women whom Lépine considered to be feminists and apparently wished to kill.[tpl]cite journal| last =Chun| first =Wendy Hui Kyong| title =Unbearable Witness: towards a Politics of Listening | journal =Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies | volume =11| issue =1| pages =112–149| year =1999[/tpl]
Since the attack, Canadians have debated various interpretations of the events, their significance, and Lépine's motives. Many feminist groups and public officials have characterized the massacre as an anti-feminist attack that is representative of wider societal violence against women.[tpl]cite book |author=Young, Katherine K.; Nathanson, Paul |title=Legalizing Misandry: From Public Shame to Systematic Discrimination Against Men |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |location=Montreal |year=2006 |pages= 59–61|isbn=0-7735-2862-8 |oclc= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=cqKxhhu55SMC&pg=PA59[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Conway|first=John Frederick|title=The Canadian Family in crisis|publisher=James Lorimer and Company|year=2003|pages=163–64|isbn= 978-1-55028-798-1 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=-Spqsukv9aQC&pg=PA163[/tpl][tpl]cite news | last =Fitzpatrick| first =Meagan| title =National day of remembrance pays tribute to victims of Montreal massacre| publisher =CanWest News Service| date = December 6, 2006 | url =http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=dcb98c06-2c4f-46f1-bc6f-6a147308a252&k=33060| accessdate =December 27, 2006[/tpl] Consequently, the anniversary of the massacre has since been commemorated as the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women.

==Massacre==

Sometime after 4 p.m. on December 6, 1989, Marc Lépine arrived at the building housing the École Polytechnique, an engineering school affiliated with the Université de Montréal, armed with a semi-automatic rifle and a hunting knife. He had purchased the Sturm, Ruger brand rifle, Mini-14 model, on November 21, 1989 in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal, telling the clerk that he was going to use it to hunt small game.[tpl]cite news|last =Weston| first =Greg| title =Why? We may never know|work=Toronto Sun| date = September 14, 2006[/tpl] Lépine was familiar with the layout of the building since he had been in and around the École Polytechnique at least seven times in the weeks leading up to the event.
Lépine sat for a time in the office of the registrar on the second floor. He was seen rummaging through a plastic bag and did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. He left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10 p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.[tpl]cite web| title =Gunman massacres 14 women| work =Archives| publisher =CBC| date = December 6, 1989| url =http://archives.cbc.ca/society/crime_justice/topics/398-2235/| archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20110604052652/http://archives.cbc.ca/society/crime_justice/topics/398-2235/| archivedate =2011-06-04| format =video stream| accessdate =December 29, 2006[/tpl]
Lépine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and ordered the men to leave. Speaking in French, he asked the remaining women whether they knew why they were there, and when one student replied "no," he answered: "I am fighting feminism". One of the students, Nathalie Provost, said, "Look, we are just women studying engineering, not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men, just students intent on leading a normal life." Lépine responded that "You're women, you're going to be engineers. You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists." He then opened fire on the students from left to right, killing six, and wounding three others, including Provost.  Before leaving the room, he wrote the word shit twice on a student project.
Lépine continued into the second floor corridor and wounded three students before entering another room where he twice attempted to shoot a female student. His weapon failed to fire so he entered the emergency staircase where he was seen reloading his gun. He returned to the room he had just left, but the students had locked the door; Lépine failed to unlock it with three shots fired into the door. Moving along the corridor he shot at others, wounding one, before moving towards the financial services office where he shot and killed a woman through the window of the door she had just locked.
He next went down to the first floor cafeteria, in which about a hundred people were gathered. The crowd scattered after he shot a woman standing near the kitchens and wounded another student. Entering an unlocked storage area at the end of the cafeteria, Lépine shot and killed two more women hiding there. He told a male and female student to come out from under a table; they complied and were not shot.
Lépine then walked up an escalator to the third floor where he shot and wounded one female and two male students in the corridor. He entered another classroom and told the three students giving a presentation to "get out," shooting and wounding Maryse Leclair, who was standing on the low platform at the front of the classroom. He fired on students in the front row and then killed two women who were trying to escape the room, while other students dove under their desks. Lépine moved towards some of the female students, wounding three of them and killing another. He changed the magazine in his weapon and moved to the front of the class, shooting in all directions. At this point, the wounded Leclair asked for help and, after unsheathing his hunting knife, Lépine stabbed her three times, killing her. 
He took off his cap, wrapped his coat around his rifle, exclaimed, "Ah shit," and then committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, twenty minutes after having begun his attack. About sixty bullets remained in the boxes he carried with him. He had killed fourteen women in total (twelve engineering students, one nursing student and one employee of the university) and injured fourteen other people, including four men.
After briefing reporters outside, Montreal Police director of public relations Pierre Leclair entered the building and found his daughter Maryse's stabbed body.[tpl]cite news | last =Came| first =Barry| coauthors =Burke, D, Ferzoco, G., O'Farreli, B, Wallace, B| title = Montreal Massacre: Railing Against Feminists| publisher = Maclean's Magazine | date =December 18, 1989| url= http://business.highbeam.com/4341/article-1G1-8269667/montreal-massacre-railing-against-feminists-gunman[/tpl][tpl]cite news | last =Mennie| first =James| coauthors = and Bauch, Hubert| title = A quiet goodbye for slain women| page =A1| newspaper = The Gazette |location=Montreal | date =December 12, 1989[/tpl]
The Quebec and Montreal governments declared three days of mourning. A joint funeral for nine of the women was held at Notre-Dame Basilica on December 11, 1989, which was attended by Governor General Jeanne Sauvé, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Quebec premier Robert Bourassa, and Montreal mayor Jean Doré, along with thousands of other mourners.

===Suicide letter===

Marc Lépine's inside jacket pocket contained a suicide letter and two letters to friends, all dated the day of the massacre. Some details from the suicide letter were revealed by the police two days after the event,[tpl]cite news| last =Malarek| first =Victor| title =More Massacre Details to be Released by Police, but an Inquiry Ruled Out| page =A6| newspaper =Globe and Mail| date = December 12, 1989[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Malarek|first =Victor| title =Killer's letter blames feminists| page =A7| newspaper =Globe and Mail |date = December 8, 1989[/tpl] but the full text was not disclosed.

==Marc Lépine==

Marc Lépine was born Gamil Gharbi to a French-Canadian mother and an Algerian father. His father, a mutual funds salesman, was contemptuous of women, and was physically and verbally abusive to his wife and son, discouraging tenderness between mother and child.[tpl]cite news | last =CTV.ca News Staff|title =Mother of Marc Lepine finally breaks her silence |publisher =CTV| date = September 18, 2006| url =http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/print/CTVNews/20060925/lepine_mother_060925/20060925/?hub=Canada&subhub=PrintStory| archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20090418004957/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/print/CTVNews/20060925/lepine_mother_060925/20060925/?hub=Canada&subhub=PrintStory| archivedate =2009-04-18| accessdate =January 1, 2007[/tpl] When Gamil was seven his parents separated; his father ceased contact with his children soon after. His mother returned to nursing to support the family, and due to her schedule the children lived with other families during the week. At 14, he changed his name to "Marc Lépine", citing his hatred of his father as the reason for taking his mother's surname.[ref]

==Search for a rationale==

The massacre profoundly shocked Canadians. Government and criminal justice officials feared that extensive public discussion about the massacre would cause pain to the families and lead to antifeminist violence. As a result, a public inquiry was not held,[tpl]cite news| last =Malarek| first =Victor| title =More Massacre Details to be Released by Police, but an Inquiry Ruled Out| page =A14|work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada | date = December 12, 1989[/tpl] and Marc Lépine's suicide letter was not officially released. In addition, though an extensive police investigation into Marc Lépine and the killings took place,[tpl]cite news | last =Canadian Press| title = Police scour the life of mass killer| page =  B9| newspaper = Edmonton Journal| date =January 12, 1990[/tpl] the resulting report was not made public, though a copy was used by the coroner as a source in her investigation.[tpl]cite news| last =Poirier| first =Patricia| title =Police can't find cause for Lepine's rampage on Montreal campus| page =A17|work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada | date = March 1, 1990[/tpl]  The media, academics, women's organizations, and family members of the victims protested the lack of a public inquiry and paucity of information released.[tpl]cite news| last =Canadian Press| title =Parents fear coverup over murdered 14| page = A15| newspaper =Toronto Star| date =May 30, 1990[/tpl]
The gender of Marc Lépine's victims as well as his oral statements during the massacre and suicide note quickly led to the event being seen as an antifeminist attack and as an example of the wider issue of violence against women.[tpl]sfn|Eglin|Hester|2003|pp=65–88[/tpl][ref]
