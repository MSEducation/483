Hugo normally gives masterclasses and seminars on violin teaching and lectures on music-related subjects all over the world. In autumn 2008, he was invited to become the guest violin teacher and lecturer in music history at a new university in New York. Hugo’s teaching basically searches for ways to apply the physical and spiritual aspects of meditation to practicing art, playing and living in music.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.festivalomodernt.com/artists-2011/musicians/soloists/hugo-ticciati-violin/ |title=Hugo Ticciati, violin |accessdate=24 September 2011 |authorlink= www.hugoticciati.com |publisher=O Modernt |location= Sweden[/tpl]
London was the place where Hugo started studying violin, before going to the University of Toronto. He continued studying with the Russian violinists, Nina and Oleg Balabina in Sweden, where he now is considered as a Swedish citizen. Hugo has won the international competitions Giovani Talenti and Rovere d’Oro at San Bartolomeo al Mare, Italy (2002), and the Mendelssohn Cup in Bari, Italy (2004).

==Projects==

Ticciati has started a new festival named O/MODƏRNT (which means “Unmodern”) as artistic director at Ulrikdals Castle Theatre Confidencen, in Sweden.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.festivalomodernt.com/artists-2011/musicians/soloists/hugo-ticciati-violin/ |title=Hugo Ticciati, violin |accessdate=24 September 2011 |authorlink= www.hugoticciati.com |publisher=O Modernt |location= Sweden[/tpl]
Ticciati’s philosophy over the festival establishes that the best way to outperform is creating a premeditated concept of what the expectation of the festival should be. He is interested in looking back to the past and structuring his own musical vision, just as Bach did. That is why his first O/ Modernt festival was focused on Bach´s music and its influences in the musical world since his death.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/07/01/triumphs-of-the-o-modernters/  |title=Triumphs of the O/Modernters  |author=David Yearsley |accessdate=29 September 2011 |publisher= Counterpunch [/tpl]
Hugo enhances the contemporary music world, working with composers such as Albert Schnelzer, Anders Hillborg, Djuro Zivkovic, Leonardo Coral, Andrea Tarrodi, Tobias Broström, Thomas Jennefelt, Sergey Yevtushenko and Esaias Järnegard.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.hugoticciati.com/?page_id=61 |title= Hugo Ticciati |accessdate=24 September 2011 [/tpl]
