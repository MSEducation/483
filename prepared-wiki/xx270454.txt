Irion has defended popular commercial literature, in a Whiskey Round Table essay titled "Why the Literary Community Needs 'Twilight'", stating that "I am in no way arguing an equality in quality of New Moon to The Great Gatsby. That doesn’t matter. Nor am I equating commercial success with creative depth. From what I understand from the Wikipedia articles on these books, their plots are simple and predictable, and their characters relatively flat and derivative. But there was something about the books that made people want to read. There was something in those books that made a lot of people want to read. In a time when attention spans are getting shorter and shorter and the number of children who read for recreation plummeting with all the delicateness of a bowling ball tied to an eighteen wheeler, I think we should all be thankful for something–no matter how silly it may seem–that keeps young–and maybe not so young–people in libraries, in bookstores, and in the infinite universe of their own imagination."[tpl]dead link|date=October 2011[/tpl]
He has had short fiction published by Paper Darts, This Great Society, Whiskey Round Table], and Fiction Daily.
Irion also played guitar and back up vocals for Roy Robertson, a musician based out of Denton, Texas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/royrobertsonmusic?v=info |title=Roy Robertson |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15[/tpl]
