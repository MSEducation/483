The style of the cemetery is characterized more by its architectural than by its sculptural features.Aproximación a la Iconografía Funeraria en Puerto Rico: Análisis de Tumbas y Pinturas Puertorriqueñas Representativas de Finales del Siglo XIX al Inicio del XXI.

The quality of the construction is such that "it is considered the posthumous mansion" of those buried there.Aproximación a la Iconografía Funeraria en Puerto Rico: Análisis de Tumbas y Pinturas Puertorriqueñas Representativas de Finales del Siglo XIX al Inicio del XXI.

Of special significance for their architectural value are the Serralles family mausoleum composed of a central chaple raised over a raised plaza, the Mario Mercado Montalvo family mausoleum also over a raised plaza, and the Valdivieso family mausoleum. The Toro family mausoleum also presents a funerary chapel but it is not raised over a plaza nor is the Chardon family mausoleum.

==Today==

Many of these magnificent tombs have been abandoned after their owners moved corpses of their dead to the Cementerio Civil de Ponce. This was due in part to the high cost of maintenance and the strict regulations set by the administration. Under no condition would they allow a non-Catholic to be buried there. Some families did not want to be separated by this rule and moved their loved ones to the Civil Cemetery. As a result some graves have been abandoned and cannot be sold by the cemetery administration since they are private property and have a legal, albeit uninterested, owner.
