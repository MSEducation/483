Hamilton also has two [tpl]convert|3500|hp[/tpl] Fairbanks-Morse diesel engines, capable of driving the ship economically at [tpl]convert|17|kn|km/h|0[/tpl] for up to [tpl]convert|14400|nmi|km|-2[/tpl] without refueling.  A retractable/rotatable bow propulsion unit provides exceptional maneuverability in tight situations.

===Flight Support===

Hamilton[tpl]'[/tpl]s flight deck and hangar, capable of handling both Coast Guard and Navy helicopters extends the vesselâ€™s rescue and maritime law enforcement operations.

==Renovation==

In 1988, Hamilton completed a three-year fleet renovation and modernization that provided the ship with modern weapons and electronics systems.  All spaces and machinery were also completely overhauled and refurbished.  The new technology enables Hamilton to operate seamlessly with the United States Navy.

==Missions==

thumb|300px|Crewmembers of the USCGC Hamilton, San Diego, 2010Hamilton has served a variety of missions with distinction.  During a 1969-70 deployment to Vietnam, Hamilton interdicted weapons smugglers and fired more than 4,600 rounds of gunfire in support of U.S. and Vietnamese troops ashore.  From 1965-1975, Hamilton served on Atlantic Ocean Stations, collecting valuable oceanographic data and conducting frequent search and rescue missions.  Hamilton also directed the interdictions of over 21,000 Haitian migrants throughout the Caribbean during Operation Able Manner.  In 1994, Hamilton received the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation for rescuing 135 Haitians from the sea after their sailboat capsized and sank.  In 1996, Hamilton transited the Panama Canal and served as the command and control platform for Operation Frontier Shield, a multi-agency effort to curtail the influx of narcotics into the United States.  Hamilton intercepted 14 drug-laden vessels carrying more than 115 tons of contraband worth 200 million dollars.  In 1999, Hamilton seized over 2,700 kilograms of cocaine bound for the U.S. in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.  Hamilton frequently patrols the Bering Sea off the Alaskan coast at the Maritime Boundary Line (MBL) which separates the Russian and the United States[tpl]'[/tpl] Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ).  Hamilton[tpl]'[/tpl]s presence on the MBL deters foreign fishing vessels from fishing in the U.S. EEZ.
In March 2007, Hamilton assisted the [tpl]USCGC|Sherman|WHEC-720|2[/tpl] in the largest recorded maritime drug bust in history. The two vessels intercepted the Panamanian-flagged fishing vessel Gatun in international waters and were able to recover 20 metric tons of cocaine, with an estimated street value of $600 million retail. The seizure was the largest drug bust in US history and the largest interdiction at sea.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/786/151219/ |title=Coast Guard Makes Recort Maritime Cocaine Seizure |accessdate=2008-08-08 |last=Carter |first=Cmdr.
