Jammu and Kashmir consists of three regions: Jammu, the Kashmir valley and Ladakh. Srinagar is the summer capital, and Jammu is the winter capital. Although the Kashmir valley is famous for its beautiful mountainous landscape, Jammu's numerous shrines attract tens of thousands of Hindu pilgrims every year. Ladakh, also known as "Little Tibet", is renowned for its remote mountain beauty and Buddhist culture.

==History==

Hari Singh had ascended the throne of Kashmir[tpl]cite web|last=Sharma|first=Vivek|title=Kashmir Ki Kahani|url=http://www.aajkiawaaz.com/editorial/941-story-of-kashmir.html|work=Aajkiawaaz|publisher=Arpana Singh Parashar|accessdate=12 August 2013[/tpl] in 1925 and was the reigning monarch at the conclusion of British rule in the subcontinent in 1947. One of the conditions of the partition of India imposed by Britain was that the rulers of princely states would have the right to opt for either Pakistan or India or remain independent. In 1947, Kashmir's population was 77% Muslim and it shared a boundary with both Dominion of Pakistan and Union of India.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] On 20 October 1947, tribesmen backed by Pakistan invaded Kashmir.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/5030514.stm|title=Quick guide: Kashmir dispute|publisher=BBC News|date=29 June 2006|accessdate=14 June 2009[/tpl]
The Maharaja initially fought back but appealed for assistance to the Governor-General Louis Mountbatten, who agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India.Stein, Burton. 1998.

The UN resolution asked both India and Pakistan to vacate the areas they had occupied and hold a referendum under UN observation. The holding of this plebiscite, which India initially supported, was dismissed by India because the 1952 elected Constituent assembly of Jammu and Kashmir voted in favour of confirming the Kashmir region's accession to India.[tpl]cite book|url = http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,HRW,COUNTRYREP,PAK,,4517b1a14,0.html|title= "With Friends Like These...": Human Rights Violations in Azad Kashmir|quote=In January 194,|publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|accessdate =31 December 2007[/tpl] The United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) was deployed to supervise the ceasefire between India and Pakistan. UNMOGIP's functions were to investigate complaints of ceasefire violations and submit findings to each party and to the U.N. secretary-general. Under the terms of the ceasefire, it was decided that both armies would withdraw and a plebiscite would be held in Kashmir to give Kashmiris the right to self-determination. The primary argument for the continuing debate over the ownership of Kashmir is that India did not hold the promised plebiscite. In fact, neither side has adhered to the U.N. resolution of 13 August 1948; while India chose not to hold the plebiscite, Pakistan failed to withdraw its troops from Kashmir as was required under the resolution. Instead,for not holding the plebiscite,India gave below reasons:

Diplomatic relations between India and Pakistan soured for many other reasons and eventually resulted in three further wars in Kashmir the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 and the Kargil War in 1999. India has control of 60% of the area of the former Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir (Jammu, Kashmir Valley, and Ladakh); Pakistan controls 30% of the region (Gilgit–Baltistan and Azad Kashmir). China occupied 10% (Aksai Chin) of the state in 1962.
The Chenab formula was a compromise proposed in the 1960s, in which the Kashmir valley and other Muslim-dominated areas north of the Chenab river would go to Pakistan, and Jammu and other Hindu-dominated regions would go to India.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/south_asia/03/kashmir_future/html/7.stm |title= |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=2 February 2010[/tpl]
The eastern region of the erstwhile princely state of Kashmir has also been beset with a boundary dispute. In the late 19th- and early 20th centuries, although some boundary agreements were signed between Great Britain, Tibet, Afghanistan and Russia over the northern borders of Kashmir, China never accepted these agreements, and the official Chinese position did not change with the communist revolution in 1949. By the mid-1950s the Chinese army had entered the northeast portion of Ladakh:"Kashmir" Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved 27 March 2007
By 1956–57 they had completed a military road through the Aksai Chin area to provide better communication between Xinjiang and western Tibet. India's belated discovery of this road led to border clashes between the two countries that culminated in the Sino-Indian war of October 1962. China has occupied Aksai Chin since 1962 and, in addition, an adjoining region, the Trans-Karakoram Tract was ceded by Pakistan to China in 1963.
For intermittent periods between 1957, when the state approved its own Constitution,[tpl]Harvnb|Schofield|2003|p=94[/tpl] and the death of Sheikh Abdullah in 1982, the state had alternating spells of stability and discontent. In the late 1980s, however, simmering discontent over the high-handed policies of the Union Government[tpl]Harvnb|Schofield|2003|p=137[/tpl] and allegations of the rigging of the 1987 assembly elections triggered a violent uprising which was backed by Pakistan.[tpl]Harvnb|Schofield|2003|p=210[/tpl]
Since then, the region has seen a prolonged, bloody conflict between separatists and the Indian Army, both of whom have been accused of widespread human rights abuses, including abductions, massacres, rapes and lootings.[tpl]cite video | people = Billal A.

==Geography and climate==

Jammu and Kashmir is home to several valleys such as the Kashmir Valley, Tawi Valley, Chenab Valley, Poonch Valley, Sind Valley and Lidder Valley. The main Kashmir valley is [tpl]convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] wide and [tpl]convert|15520.3|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] in area. The Himalayas divide the Kashmir valley from Ladakh while the Pir Panjal range, which encloses the valley from the west and the south, separates it from the Great Plains of northern India. Along the northeastern flank of the Valley runs the main range of the Himalayas. This densely settled and beautiful valley has an average height of [tpl]convert|1850|m|ft[/tpl] above sea-level but the surrounding Pir Panjal range has an average elevation of [tpl]convert|5000|m|ft[/tpl].
Because of Jammu and Kashmir's wide range of elevations, its biogeography is diverse. Northwestern thorn scrub forests and Himalayan subtropical pine forests are found in the low elevations of the far southwest. These give way to a broad band of western Himalayan broadleaf forests running from northwest-southeast across the Kashmir Valley. Rising into the mountains, the broadleaf forests grade into western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests. Above the tree line are found northwestern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows. Much of the northeast of the state is covered by the Karakoram-West Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe. Around the highest elevations, there is no vegetation, simply rock and ice.
The Jhelum River is the only major Himalayan river which flows through the Kashmir valley. The Indus, Tawi, Ravi and Chenab are the major rivers flowing through the state. Jammu and Kashmir is home to several Himalayan glaciers. With an average altitude of [tpl]convert|5753|m|ft[/tpl] above sea-level, the Siachen Glacier is [tpl]convert|76|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] long making it the longest Himalayan glacier.
The climate of Jammu and Kashmir varies greatly owing to its rugged topography. In the south around Jammu, the climate is typically monsoonal, though the region is sufficiently far west to average 40 to 50 mm (1.6 to 2 inches) of rain per month between January and March. In the hot season, Jammu city is very hot and can reach up to 40 °C (104 °F) whilst in July and August, very heavy though erratic rainfall occurs with monthly extremes of up to 650 millimetres (25.5 inches). In September, rainfall declines, and by October conditions are hot but extremely dry, with minimal rainfall and temperatures of around 29 °C (84 °F).
Across from the Pir Panjal range, the South Asian monsoon is no longer a factor and most precipitation falls in the spring from southwest cloudbands. Because of its closeness to the Arabian Sea, Srinagar receives as much as [tpl]convert|635|mm|in|0[/tpl] of rain from this source, with the wettest months being March to May with around 85 millimetres (3.3 inches) per month. Across from the main Himalaya Range, even the southwest cloudbands break up and the climate of Ladakh and Zanskar is extremely dry and cold. Annual precipitation is only around 100 mm (4 inches) per year and humidity is very low. In this region, almost all above 3,000 metres (9,750 ft) above sea level, winters are extremely cold. In Zanskar, the average January temperature is −20 °C (−4 °F) with extremes as low as −40 °C (−40 °F). All the rivers freeze over and locals make river crossings during this period because their high levels from glacier melt in summer inhibits crossing. In summer in Ladakh and Zanskar, days are typically a warm 20 °C (68 °F), but with the low humidity and thin air nights can still be cold.

==Administrative divisions==

Jammu and Kashmir consists of three divisions: Jammu, Kashmir Valley and Ladakh, and is further divided into 22 districts.[tpl]cite web| url = http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=306| title = Ministry of Home Affairs:: Department of Jammu & Kashmir Affairs| accessdate =28 August 2008[/tpl] The Siachen Glacier, although under Indian military control, does not lie under the administration of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Kishtwar, Ramban, Reasi, Samba, Bandipora, Ganderbal, Kulgam and Shopian are newly formed districts, and their areas are included with those of the districts from which they were formed.

===Major cities===

In Jammu and Kashmir, the principal spoken languages are Kashmiri, Urdu, Dogri, Pahari, Balti, Ladakhi, Gojri, Shina and Pashto. However, Urdu written in the Persian script is the official language of the state. Many speakers of these languages use Hindi or English as a second language.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=kas|title = Kashmiri: A language of India |publisher = Ethnologue |accessdate =16 September 2007[/tpl]
The Kashmir Valley is dominated by ethnic Kashmiris, who have largely driven the Azadi campaign. Non-Kashmiri Muslim ethnic groups (Paharis, Sheenas, Gujjars and Bakarwalas), who dominate areas along the Line of Control, have remained indifferent to the separatist campaign. Jammu province region has a 70:30 Hindu-Muslim ratio. Parts of the region were hit by militants, but violence has ebbed there, along with the Valley, after India and Pakistan started a peace process in 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=VE9JTS8yMDEwLzA5LzE2I0FyMDE0MDA%3D |title=Descent into Chaos |publisher=Epaper.timesofindia.com |date=16 September 2010 |accessdate=16 April 2013[/tpl]
Dogras (67%) are the single largest group in the multi-ethnic region of Jammu living with Punjabis, Paharis, Bakerwals and Gujjars. Statehood is demanded in Hindu-dominated districts. Ladakh is the largest region in the state with over 200,000 people. Its two districts are Leh (77% Buddhist) and Kargil (80% Muslim population). Union territory status has been the key demand of Leh Buddhists for many years.

==Politics and government==

Jammu and Kashmir is the only state in India which enjoys special autonomy under Article 370 of the Constitution of India, according to which no law enacted by the Parliament of India, except for those in the field of defence, communication and foreign policy, will be extendable in Jammu and Kashmir unless it is ratified by the state legislature of Jammu and Kashmir. Subsequently, jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of India over Jammu and Kashmir has been extended.States: Jammu & Kashmir: Repeating History:By Harinder Baweja (3 July 2000)India Today[tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl]

Like all the states of India, Jammu and Kashmir has a multi-party democratic system of governance with a bicameral legislature. At the time of drafting the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, 100 seats were earmarked for direct elections from territorial constituencies. Of these, 25 seats were reserved for the areas of Jammu and Kashmir State that came under Pakistani occupation; this was reduced to 24 after the 12th amendment of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kashmir-information.com/LegalDocs/140.html |title=Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir Section 4 Read with Section 48(a) |publisher=Kashmir-information.com |date= |accessdate=16 April 2013[/tpl]

The Katra-Banihal section is under construction. The route crosses major earthquake zones, and is subjected to extreme temperatures of cold and heat, as well as inhospitable terrain, making it an extremely challenging engineering project.  It is expected to increase tourism and travel to Kashmir. Three other railway lines, the Bilaspur–Mandi–Leh railway, Srinagar-Kargil-Leh railway and the Jammu-Poonch railway have been proposed.

==Tourism==

Before the insurgency intensified in 1989, tourism formed an important part of the Kashmiri economy. The tourism economy in the Kashmir valley was worst hit. However, the holy shrines of Jammu and the Buddhist monasteries of Ladakh continue to remain popular pilgrimage and tourism destinations. Every year, thousands of Hindu pilgrims visit holy shrines of Vaishno Devi and Amarnath, which has had significant impact on the state's economy.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/002200709130350.htm | work=Online edition of The Hindu, dated 13 September 2007|title=Amarnath Board to study yatra impact on Kashmir economy | accessdate=6 June 2009|location=Chennai, India|date=13 September 2007[/tpl] It was estimated in 2007 that the Vaishno Devi yatra contributed [tpl]INRConvert|4.75|b[/tpl] to the local economy annually a few years ago.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.merinews.com/catFull.jsp?articleID=126009 |title=Vaishno Devi yatra injects Rs 475 cr to Katra economy annually(CJ: Rattan Sharma, 27 Aug 2007) |publisher=Merinews.com |date=27 August 2007 |accessdate=16 April 2013[/tpl] The contribution would be much more now as the numbers of visitors have increased considerably. Foreign tourists have been slower to return. The British government still advises against all travel to Jammu and Kashmir with the exception of the cities of Jammu and Srinagar, travel between these two cities on the Jammu-Srinagar highway, and the region of Ladakh.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/asia-oceania/india |title=India travel advice – GOV.UK |publisher=Fco.gov.uk |date=9 April 2013 |accessdate=16 April 2013[/tpl]
Besides Kashmir, Jammu region too has a lot of tourism potential. There are various place in Jammu which are worth seeing. Bhau Fort in Jammu city is the major attraction centre for the tourists visiting the city. Bage-e-Bahu is the another tourist destination. Aquarium established by the fisheries department is being visited by many these days.
Jammu is being majorly visited by the tourist from across the India as a pilgrimage to Mata Vaishno Devi. Mata Vaishno Devi is located on the trikuta hills which is around 40 to 45 km away from Jammu City. Approximately 10 million Pilgrims visit this holy place every year.
Tourism in the Kashmir valley has rebounded in recent years, and in 2009, the state became one of the top tourist destinations of India.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/004200903181221.htm|work=Online edition of The Hindu, dated 18 March 2009|title=Foreign tourists flock Kashmir|accessdate=18 March 2009|location=Chennai, India|date=18 March 2009[/tpl] Gulmarg, one of the most popular ski resort destinations in India, is also home to the world's highest green golf course.[tpl]cite web|last=Prystay |first=Cris |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119332713217271534.html?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=Fairway to Heaven – WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=26 October 2007 |accessdate=16 April 2013[/tpl] However, the decrease in violence in the state has boosted the state's economy and tourism.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sify.com/news/Tourists-arrival-gives-boost-to-J-K-economy-news-jm3v4cihjai.html |title=Tourists arrival gives boost to J-K economy |publisher=Sify.com |date=29 December 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2013[/tpl] It was reported that more than a million tourists visited Kashmir in 2011.http://news.oneindia.in/2011/01/16/jand-k-hopeful-of-wooing-10-lakh-tourists-thisyear-aid0126.html[tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl]NDTV News reportWelcome to Jammu and Kashmir's new tourist hot-spot | NDTV.com

==Culture==

Ladakh is famous for its unique Indo-Tibetan culture. Chanting in Sanskrit and Tibetan language forms an integral part of Ladakh's Buddhist lifestyle. Annual masked dance festivals, weaving and archery are an important part of traditional life in Ladakh. Ladakhi food has much in common with Tibetan food, the most prominent foods being thukpa, noodle soup; and tsampa, known in Ladakhi as Ngampe, roasted barley flour. Typical garb includes gonchas of velvet, elaborately embroidered waistcoats and boots, and gonads or hats. People adorned with gold and silver ornaments and turquoise headgears throng the streets during Ladakhi festivals.
The Dumhal is a famous dance in the Kashmir Valley, performed by men of the Wattal region. The women perform the Rouff, another traditional folk dance. Kashmir has been noted for its fine arts for centuries, including poetry and handicrafts. Shikaras, traditional small wooden boats, and houseboats are a common feature in lakes and rivers across the Valley.
The Constitution of India does not allow people from regions other than Jammu and Kashmir to purchase land in the state. As a consequence, houseboats became popular among those who were unable to purchase land in the Valley and has now become an integral part of the Kashmiri lifestyle.
Kawa, traditional green tea with spices and almond, is consumed all through the day in the chilly winter climate of Kashmir. Most of the buildings in the Valley and Ladakh are made from softwood and are influenced by Indian, Tibetan, and Islamic architecture.
Jammu's Dogra culture and tradition is very similar to that of neighbouring Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. Traditional Punjabi festivals such as Lohri and Vaisakhi are celebrated with great zeal and enthusiasm throughout the region, along with Accession Day, an annual holiday which commemorates the accession of Jammu & Kashmir to the Dominion of India.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.indianexpress.com/news/jk-accession-day-to-be-celebrated-as-diwali-bjp/702249/|title=J-K Accession Day to be celebrated as Diwali: BJP|publisher=Rediff|accessdate =31 December 2007[/tpl] After Dogras, Gujjars form the second-largest ethnic group in Jammu. Known for their semi-nomadic lifestyle, Gujjars are also found in large numbers in the Kashmir Valley. Similar to Gujjars, Gaddis are primarily herdsmen who hail from the Chamba region in Himachal Pradesh. Gaddis are generally associated with emotive music played on the flute. The Bakkarwalas found both in Jammu and the Valley of Kashmir are wholly nomadic pastoral people who move along the Himalayan slopes in search for pastures for their huge flocks of goats and sheep.

==Education==

In 1970, the state government of Jammu and Kashmir established its own education board and university. Education in the state is divided into primary, middle, high secondary, college and university level. Jammu and Kashmir follows the 10+2 pattern for education of children. This is handled by Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (abbreviated as JKBOSE). Private and public schools are recognised by the board to impart education to students. Board examinations are conducted for students in class VIII, X and XII. In addition, there are Kendriya Vidyalayas (run by the Government of India) and Indian Army schools that impart secondary school education. These schools follow the Central Board of Secondary Education pattern.
Notable higher education or research institutes in Jammu and Kashmir include Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences Soura Srinagar,
Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, National Institute of Technology, Srinagar, Government College of Engineering and Technology, Jammu and the Government Medical College of Jammu. University-level education is provided by University of Jammu, University of Kashmir, Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Jammu, Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Kashmir, Islamic University of Science & Technology, Baba Ghulam Shah Badhshah University, Institution of Technicians and Engineers (Kashmir),Government Degree College Kathua and Government degree college Ramnagar.
