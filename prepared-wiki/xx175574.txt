==Rural Poverty==

According to a recent 'Der Spiegel' article, the children who attend the elementary school in Chynów are suffering the consequences of rising food prices, to the point that a school meal is the best meal a child may receive, and has come to represent a major incentive for a child to attend school.
This state of affairs is difficult to reconcile with the facts that Poland is a contributor to many international and EU-wide food-aid programmes, and Chynów is situated in an area well endowed with agricultural land.
As to why such a problem has arisen with regard to food supply, above and beyond the current rise in prices, it would seem likely that lack of food production is due to EU agricultural policies and /or mal-administration at the state and/or county levels.
