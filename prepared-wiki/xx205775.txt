Retrieved 11 May 2013. Goya imagines himself asleep amidst his drawing tools, his reason dulled by slumber and bedeviled by creatures that prowl in the dark. The work includes owls that may be symbols of folly and bats symbolising ignorance. The artist's nightmare reflected his view of Spanish society, which he portrayed in the Los Caprichos as demented, corrupt, and ripe for ridicule.[tpl]cite web | last = The Metropolitan Museum of Art | authorlink = Metropolitan Museum of Art | title = Francisco de Goya y Lucientes: The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters: Plate 43 of The Caprices (Los Caprichos) | url = http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/09/eusi/ho_18.64.43.htm | accessdate = 2008-12-14[/tpl]
