The Trust is based at Neatishead on the Norfolk Broads and provides boating opportunities and water-based activities for disabled and disadvantaged people from anywhere in the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1984 by Richard Kenyon in memory of his parents.

The Trust offers courses and activities, run by Royal Yachting Association trained staff and 40 volunteers.
The Trust is a RYA Training Centre, and runs training courses in sailing throughout the year, which lead to RYA qualifications.
