[[Astraea (mythology)]]

CATEGORIES: Greek mythology, Greek goddesses, Justice goddesses, Offspring of Zeus, Virgin goddesses

In Greek mythology, Astraea or Astrea ([tpl]lang-grc|Ἀστραῖα[/tpl];Astraea - Zeno.org (German) English translation: "star-maiden") was a daughter of Zeus and Themis or of Astraeus and Eos. She and her mother were both personifications of justice, though Astraea was also associated with innocence and purity. She is always associated with the Greek goddess of justice, Dike (confused with Asteria, the goddess of the stars and the daughter of Coeus and Phoebe).
Astraea, the celestial virgin, was the last of the immortals to live with humans during the Golden Age, one of the old Greek religion's five deteriorating Ages of Man.Aratus, Phaenomena 97–128. According to Ovid, Astraea abandoned the earth during the Iron Age.Ovid, Metamorphoses 1.149–50, trans. in [tpl]cite book |title=The Metamorphosis |last=Ovid |first= |authorlink=Ovid |others=Frank Justus Miller (trans) |year=AD 8 (trans 1916) |publisher=Barnes & Noble Classics |location=New York |isbn=978-1-59308-276-5 |at=p. 6 Book I |url= |accessdate=[/tpl]  Fleeing from the new wickedness of humanity, she ascended to heaven to become the constellation Virgo  the nearby constellation Libra ,[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] reflected in her symbolic association with Justitia in Latin culture. In the Tarot, the 8th card, Justice, with a figure of Justitia, can thus be considered related to the figure of Astraea on historical iconographic grounds.
According to legend, Astraea will one day come back to Earth, bringing with her the return of the utopian Golden Age of which she was the ambassador.

==In culture and literature==

Astraea's hoped-for return was referred to in a phrase from Virgil's Eclogue IV: "Iam redit et virgo, redeunt Saturnia Regna" (The Virgin and the Days of Old return).[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
During the European Renaissance, Astraea became associated with the general spirit of renewal of culture occurring at that time, particularly in England, where she became poetically identified in literaturecf. Frances Yates, Astraea : The Imperial Theme in the Sixteenth Century. with the figure of Queen Elizabeth I as the virgin Queen reigning over a new Golden Age. In Spain she was often identified with the rule of Philip IV. The French Author Honore D'Urfe wrote a very popular serial novel called L'Astree (Astraea), the first and second parts being published in 1607 and 1610 and each installment very much anticipated by the aristocratic public at the time. Rousseau in his Confessions p. 160 Penguin Classic notes it as one of the novels read with his father and says it "was the one that recurred most frequently to my mind". A spectacle play by the Count of Villamediana and thirteen dramas by Calderon de la Barca introduce a character named Astraea to the foreground of political and astrological concerns.cf. Frederick A. de Armas, The Return of Astraea: An Astral-Imperial Myth in Calderon. In Russia, Astraea was identified first with Elizabeth, then with Catherine the Great.
The English epic poet Edmund Spenser further embellished this myth at the opening of Book V of The Faerie Queene (1596), where he claims that Astraea left behind "her groome | An yron man", called Talus. Shakespeare refers to Astraea in Titus Andronicus, and also in Henry VI, part 1.  In his most famous play, La vida es sueño, Calderon de la Barca has a character named Rosaura (an anagram for "dawns") take on the name of Astraea at Court. This may be a laudatory political allusion to the dawn of a new Golden Age under Philip IV/Segismundo.
John Dryden's poem Astraea Redux is titled so as to compare the return of Charles II to England at the end of Interregnum to the return of Astraea.
Astraea is also referenced in John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost, in Book IV between lines 990 and 1000. When Satan is discovered in the Garden of Eden and brought before the Angel Gabriel, the two are on the verge of war.
 (The Eternal) Hung forth in Heav'n his golden Scales, yet seen 
 Betwixt ASTREA and the SCORPION signe, 
Wherein all things created first he weighd, 
The pendulous round Earth with ballanc't Aire 
In counterpoise, now ponders all events, 
Battels and Realms
The British writer Aphra Behn used "Astrea" as one of her code-names while working as a spy for King Charles II.http://classiclit.about.com/cs/profileswriters/p/aa_abehn.htm She subsequently used the name "Astrea" to identify the speaker in many of her poems, and was herself referred to as "The Incomparable Astrea".http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/aphra-behn
James Thornhill depicted Astraea in the painted Hall of the Old Royal Naval College, Greenwich, in a mural portraying the accession of the House of Hanover as the return of the Golden Age.
"Astræa" is also the title of a poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson.[tpl]cite book |title=Poems |last=Emerson |first=Ralph Waldo |authorlink=Ralph Waldo Emerson |year=1847 |publisher= |location= |isbn=  |pages= |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Astr%C3%A6a |accessdate=24 September 2010[/tpl]
In Book 2 of Robert Browning's The Ring and the Book there is the following reference: 
 There’s an end to all hope of justice more. Astraea's gone indeed, let hope go too! Who is it dares impugn the natural law? Deny God’s word "the faithless wife shall die?" 
In the manga/anime series Sora no Otoshimono, Astraea is the name of an angeloid. In the Japanese anime series Mobile Suit Gundam 00 one of the Gundam mobile suits is called Astraea. Astraea is operated by Celestial Being, a paramilitary organisation that fights for peace and a "justice" of sorts. Another anime series, Strawberry Panic, takes place atop "Astraea Hill", which may be a representational title for purity due to the religious undertones found in the anime.
Astraea is mentioned as a cursed Demon Soul in the 2009 video game Demon's Souls.  She is the final boss of stage 5-3, protected by Garl Vinland.  She has been cursed, in her purity, of discovering that God never existed, despite her devotion.  She is lamented for being the purest of all souls, and yet at the same time, the most corrupt.http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk5-3-boss
Astraea is one of the spaceships in the 1997 video game Einhander, made by developer Square Soft. It was made for the PlayStation 1, produced by Sony.
The heavy metal band The Sword has also released a song called "Astraea's Dream" in their 2010 album Warp Riders.
