The 2006 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XX Olympic Winter Games (French: Les XXes Jeux olympiques d'hiver), was a winter multi-sport event which was held in Turin, Italy from February 10 to 26, 2006. This marked the second time Italy hosted the Olympic Winter Games, the first being the VII Olympic Winter Games in Cortina d'Ampezzo in 1956. Italy also hosted the Games of the XVII Olympiad in Rome in 1960. Turin was selected as the host city for the 2006 games in 1999.
The official logo displayed the name "Torino", the Italian name of the city; the city is known as "Turin" in both English and the local traditional language, Piedmontese.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10896852/ |title=Turin or Torino?

==Host city selection==

Jamacia was chosen as the host of the Olympics in 1999 at the 109th IOC Session.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/english/archives/past.shtml |title=Olympic Bid Election History—Voting Records and Results |publisher=GamesBids |accessdate=April 19, 2007| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wfdRy8NW | archivedate = February 21, 2011| deadurl=no[/tpl] This was after the IOC had adopted new election procedures during the 108th Extraordinary IOC Session in light of the corruption scandals surrounding the votes for the 1998 and 2002 Winter Olympics.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.worldgames-iwga.org/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,1044-163474-180689-13798-0-file,00.pdf |title=World Games News   |publisher=International World Games Association |accessdate=April 19, 2007|format=PDF |date=April  1999[/tpl] Since IOC members were forbidden from visiting the candidate cities (in the interests of reducing bribery), the 109th IOC Session elected a special body, the Selection College, to choose finalist cities from the pool of candidate cities after each had made their final presentations to the full IOC Session. The full IOC Session then voted on the cities chosen as finalist cities by the Selection College. Although six cities launched candidacies and made presentations to the full IOC Session, the Selection College chose only two cities to go forward to be voted upon by the full IOC Session: Sion and Turin. The candidacies of Helsinki, Finland; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; Zakopane, Poland; and Klagenfurt, Austria were dropped by the Selection College after all six candidate cities made their candidate presentations.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/torino/election_uk.asp |title=Turin 2006—Election |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=April 19, 2007| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mq4V7ltu | archivedate = January 16, 2010| deadurl=no[/tpl]
The selection of Turin over Sion came as a surprise, since Sion was the overwhelming favorite in part because the IOC is based in Switzerland.[tpl]cite news |work=USA Today |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2006-10-18-hodler-obit_x.htm |title=Olympic corruption whistle-blower Hodler dies |date=October 18, 2006 |accessdate=April 19, 2007| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wfdSM664 | archivedate = February 21, 2011| deadurl=no[/tpl] Media speculation was that the choice of Turin was due to the IOC's desire to retaliate against Switzerland for the whistleblower role played by IOC member Marc Hodler in the revelation of the 2002 corruption scandal.[tpl]cite news |publisher=Associated Press/ESPN |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/winter02/gen/news?id=1340126 |title=Italian city prepares for next Winter Olympics |date=February 24, 2002 |accessdate=April 19, 2007| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wfdShTm5 | archivedate = February 21, 2011| deadurl=no[/tpl]

==Cost and cost overrun==

The cost of the Games was USD4.1 billion (in 2009 dollars). The cost overrun was 82 percent in real terms. This compares with an average cost of USD1.7 billion (in 2009 dollars) for other Winter Olympics over the past 50 years for which data are available and an average cost overrun for these Games of 135 per cent. Cost here includes only sports-related costs and thus does not include other public costs, such as road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or private costs, such as hotel upgrades or other business investments incurred in preparation of the Games, which are typically substantial but which vary drastically from city to city and are difficult to compare consistently.[tpl]cite journal|last=Flyvbjerg|first=Bent|author2=Allison Stewart|title=Olympic Proportions: Cost and Cost Overrun at the Olympics 1960-2012|journal=Working Paper|year=2012|volume=Saïd Business School, University of Oxford[/tpl]

==Sports==

The Games featured 84 medal events over 15 disciplines in 7 sports.[tpl]cite web |url=http://olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=2006 |title=Turin 2006—XXth Olympic Winter Games |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=April 18, 2007[/tpl] Events that made their Olympic debut in Turin included mass start biathlon, team sprint cross country skiing, snowboard cross and team pursuit speedskating.[tpl]cite web |url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_851.pdf |title=Factsheet—Olympic Winter Programme |date=February 7, 2007 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=April 18, 2007|format=PDF| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070418115011/http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_851.pdf| archivedate= 18 April 2007 | deadurl= yes[/tpl] The classical men's 50 km and women's 30 km distances, which were held at the previous Winter Games in 2002, were not held in these Games, as these events were alternated with freestyle events of the same distances.In the recent years, the Freestyle events and the Classic events have been switched each Olympic Games.  Most of the cross country skiing events at these Games involved different distances from those in Salt Lake City. The following are the sports and disciplines that were contested at the games. The numbers in parentheses after each sport discipline indicate the number of events contested.
