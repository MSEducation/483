Perospirone (Lullan) is an atypical antipsychotic of the azapirone family.[tpl]cite journal | author = Onrust, SV; McClellan, K | title = Perospirone | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 329–37; discussion 338 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11463136 | doi = 10.2165/00023210-200115040-00006 | url = http://link.springer.com/article/10.2165%2F00023210-200115040-00006[/tpl] It was introduced in Japan by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma in 2001 for the treatment of schizophrenia and acute cases of bipolar mania.[tpl]cite journal | author = de Paulis, T | title = Perospirone (Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals) | journal = Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 121–9 |date=January 2002 | pmid = 12054062[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ds-pharma.co.jp/english/news/sumitomo_2001/no_002.html | title = Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals 2001 | News Release | Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma | work = | accessdate = [/tpl]

==Medical uses==

Its primary uses are in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar mania.[tpl]cite journal | author = de Paulis, T | title = Perospirone (Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals) | journal = Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 121–9 |date=January 2002 | pmid = 12054062[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ds-pharma.co.jp/english/news/sumitomo_2001/no_002.html | title = Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals 2001 | News Release | Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma | work = | accessdate = [/tpl]

===Schizophrenia===

In a clinical trial that compared it to haloperidol in the treatment of schizophrenia it was found to produce significantly superior overall symptom control.[tpl]cite journal|last=Murasaki|first=M|coauthors=Koyama, T; Machiyama, Y; et al.|title=Clinical evaluation of a new antipsychotic, perospirone HCl, on schizophrenia: a comparative double-blind study with haloperidol|journal=Rinsho Hyoka|year=1997|volume=24|issue=2-3|pages=159–205[/tpl] In another clinical trial perospirone was compared with mosapramine and produced a similar reduction in total PANSS score, except with respect to the blunted affect part of the PANSS negative score, in which perospirone produced a significantly greater improvement.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kudo|first=Y|coauthors=Nakajima, T; Saito, M; et al.|title=Clinical evaluation of a serotonin-2 and dopamine-2 receptor antagonist (SDA), perospirone HCl on schizophrenia: a comparative double-blind study with mosapramine HCl|journal=Rinsho Hyoka|year=1997|volume=24|issue=2-3|pages=207–48[/tpl] In an open-label clinical trial comparing aripiprazole with perospirone there was no significant difference between the two treatments discovered in terms of both efficacy and tolerability.[tpl]cite journal|title=A 12-week randomized, open-label study of perospirone versus aripiprazole in the treatment of Japanese schizophrenia patients|journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry|date=January 2013|volume=40|pages=110-114|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2012.09.010|pmid=23022672|author=Takekita, Y; Kato, M; Wakeno, M; Sakai, S; Suwa, A; Nishida, K; Okugawa, G; Kinoshita, T[/tpl] In 2009 a clinical trial found that perospirone produced a similar reduction of PANSS score than risperidone and the extrapyramidal side effects was similar in both frequency and severity between groups.[tpl]cite journal|last=Okugawa|first=G|coauthors=Kato, M; Wakeno, M; Koh, J; Morikawa, M; Matsumoto, N; Shinosaki, K; Yoneda, H; Kishimoto, T; Kinoshita, T|title=Randomized clinical comparison of perospirone and risperidone in patients with schizophrenia: Kansai Psychiatric Multicenter Study|journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|date=June 2009|year=2009|volume=63|issue=3|pages=322–328|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.2009.01947.x|pmid=19566763|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1440-1819.2009.01947.x/pdf[/tpl]
A meta-analysis published in 2013 found that it is statistically significantly less efficacious than other second-generation antipsychotics.[tpl]cite journal|title=Efﬁcacy and Tolerability of Perospirone in Schizophrenia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials|journal=CNS Drugs|date=September 2013|volume=27|issue=9|pages=731-741|doi=10.1007/s40263-013-0085-7|pmid=23812802|url=http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40263-013-0085-7.pdf|author=Kishi, T; Iwata, N[/tpl]

==Adverse effects==

Has a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side effects than the other atypical antipsychotics, but still less than that seen with typical antipsychotics.[tpl]cite book|title=Perospirone Hydrochloride|work=Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference|publisher = The Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain|date=23 September 2011|accessdate=3 November 2013|url=http://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/current/15232-k.htm[/tpl] A trend was observed in a clinical trial comparing mosapramine with perospirone that favoured perospirone for producing less prominent extrapyramidal side effects than mosapramine although statistical significant was not reached. It may produce less QT intervalprolongation than zotepine, as in one patient who had previously been on zotepine switching to perospirone corrected their prolonged QT interval.[tpl]cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=Y|coauthors=Watanabe, J; Sugai, T; Fukui, N; Ono, S; Tsuneyama, N; Saito, M; Someya T|title=Improvement in QTc prolongation induced by zotepine following a switch to perospirone|journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|date=March 2012|year=2012|volume=66|issue=3|page=244|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.2012.02321.x|pmid=22443250|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1440-1819.2012.02321.x/pdf[/tpl] It also tended to produce less severe extrapyramidal side effects than haloperidol in a clinical trial comparing the two (although statistical significance was not reached). 

==Pharmacology==

Perospirone binds to the following receptors with very high affinity (as an antagonist unless otherwise specified):[tpl]cite web | title = PDSP Ki Database | work = Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (PDSP) | author = Roth, BL; Driscol, J | url = http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/pdsp.php | publisher = University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the United States National Institute of Mental Health | accessdate = 3 November 2013 | date = 12 January 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Hirose, A; Kato, T; Ohno, Y; Shimizu, H; Tanaka, H; Nakamura, M; Katsube, J| title = Pharmacological actions of SM-9018, a new neuroleptic drug with both potent 5-hydroxytryptamine2 and dopamine2 antagonistic actions | journal = Japanese Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | pages = 321–9 |date=July 1990| pmid = 1975278 | doi = 10.1254/jjp.53.321[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Kato, T; Hirose, A; Ohno, Y; Shimizu, H; Tanaka, H; Nakamura, M | title = Binding profile of SM-9018, a novel antipsychotic candidate | journal = Japanese Journal of Pharmacology| volume = 54 | issue = 4 | pages = 478–81 |date=December 1990 | pmid = 1982326 | doi = 10.1254/jjp.54.478[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Odagaki, Y; Toyoshima, R | title = 5-HT1A receptor agonist properties of antipsychotics determined by 35SGTPgammaS binding in rat hippocampal membranes | journal = Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology & Physiology |volume = 34 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 462–6 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17439416 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1681.2007.04595.x[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Seeman, P; Tallerico, T | title = Antipsychotic drugs which elicit little or no parkinsonism bind more loosely than dopamine to brain D2 receptors, yet occupy high levels of these receptors | journal = Molecular Psychiatry |volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–34 |date=March 1998 | pmid = 9577836 | doi = 10.1038/sj.mp.4000336[/tpl]
