==History==

===St. Benedict Parish===

St. Benedict Parish was established in 1912 and the pastoral care for the parish was given to Benedictine Monks from St. Meinrad Abbey.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.evansville-diocese.org/cathedrals/cathedrals.htm |title=Cathedrals of the Diocese of Evansville |publisher= Diocese of Evansville |accessdate=2011-09-26|last= Smith |first= Tom [/tpl]  The present church building was completed in 1928 in the Lombard-Basilica style.[tpl]cite web|url= http://historicevansville.com/site.php?id=stbenedict|title=Parish History |publisher= Historic Evansville |accessdate=2011-09-26|last= |first= [/tpl]  It was dedicated  on March 18, 1928 by Abbot Athanasius Schmidt, OSB.  The cathedral features ceilings that are 65 feet (19.8 m) high, a baldachin over the altar and a seating capacity of over 1,000 people.  
The church was renovated after the liturgical reforms of the Second Vatican Council.  The baldachin was moved forward about 25 feet (7.6 m) and the former high altar was dismantled and new altar was created.  Two of Evansville’s bishops were ordained and installed in St. Benedict’s before it became a cathedral; Francis R. Shea in 1970 and Gerald A. Gettelfinger on April 11, 1989.    
Most of the other parish buildings are older than the cathedral church.  The convent was completed in 1913 and the older school building the following year.  The rectory was built from 1921-1922.  The newer school building opened in 1953.
