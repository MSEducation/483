Miquel Martí i Pol ([tpl]IPA-ca|miˈkɛɫ mərˈti j ˈpɔɫ[/tpl]) (March 19, 1929 – November 11, 2003) was one of the most popular Catalan poets in Catalan in the 20th century.
Martí i Pol was of humble origin and had to quit studying at 14 years, to start working at a factory. Nevertheless, he started publishing poetry in 1954. In 1970 he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Despite his illness, he continued publishing high quality poetry. His poetry became very popular in Catalonia and all the Catalan speaking territories (mainly: Andorra, the Balearic Islands, the Valencian Community, Northern Catalonia in France and the Italian city of Alghero).
