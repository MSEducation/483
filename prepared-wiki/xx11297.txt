Captain: Va'Kel Shon

One version of the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-F) appears in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game Star Trek Online. Its design is based on the entry submitted by Adam Ihle for the 2011 "Design the next Enterprise" contest, a joint venture between Cryptic Studios, CBS, and Intel, which ran shortly before the game went "free to play." The Enterprise-F made its first appearance in the mission "Boldly They Rode", at the point where the USS Enterprise-F appears to help the player defeat the Dominion fleet surrounding Deep Space Nine

====Mirror Universe[tpl]anchor|ISS Enterprise[/tpl]====

The Mirror Universe first appeared in the original series as alternate reality where the militaristic Terran Empire exists in place of the regular universe's United Federation of Planets ("Mirror, Mirror"). Subsequent episodes have shown that the divergence at least predates the Moon landing, with licensed novels putting the divergence before Shakespeare, or even classic Greek literature.
Registry: ISS Enterprise (NX-01)

Class: NX

Service: 2150s

Captains: Maximilian Forrest (Vaughn Armstrong), Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula)

The Star Trek: Enterprise episode "In a Mirror, Darkly" features a Mirror Universe version of the NX-01 Enterprise. This ship is equipped with a cloaking device, deflector shields, a tractor beam, a prototype agony booth, and different exterior markings. It is commanded by Captain Maximilian Forrest, although for a brief time his first officer, Commander Jonathan Archer, takes command following a mutiny. This Enterprise is destroyed by the Tholians.
Registry: ISS Enterprise (NCC-1701)

Class: Constitution

Service: 2260s

Captains: Christopher Pike, James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Spock (Leonard Nimoy)

A Mirror Universe Enterprise appears in the original Star Trek episode "Mirror, Mirror". The ship is equipped with an agony booth and the mirror in the captain's quarters conceals Captain Kirk's deadly Tantalus device. The ISS Enterprise was originally the same shooting model as the regular Enterprise. The remastered version of "Mirror, Mirror" includes a CGI version of Enterprise with "ISS" markings on the hull and minor physical differences from USS Enterprise, such as a larger deflector dish, a taller bridge, and altered nacelle details.[tpl]cite web |url=http://trekmovie.com/2006/11/16/review-of-mirror-mirror-remastered/ |title=Review of Mirror Mirror Remastered |date=November 16, 2006 |first=Rick |last=Sternbach |authorlink=Rick Sternbach |publisher=TrekMovie.com[/tpl]

====Altered reality timeline====

The 2009 Star Trek film takes place in a new reality created when the Romulan character Nero traveled through time via an artificial black hole. thumb|left|NCC-1701

The Enterprise is shown during its construction phase at the Riverside Shipyard in Iowa during the movie.  A brief shot of the NCC-1701 is seen as the shuttlecraft carrying Kirk and the new recruits into space departs the shipyard.
Measurements for this version's final size range from 610 meters to 910 meters.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.postmagazine.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications::Article&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&tier=4&id=C0928902C93D4F8682FB2117F7DD841F |date=May 1, 2009 |title=Cover Story: 'Star Trek' Returns |first=Ken |last=McGorry |work=Post magazine |quote=The Enterprise is [tpl]convert|3000|ft[/tpl] long but bad guy Eric Bana's ship is designed to appear a humongous five miles long.[/tpl] (Quote from Russell Earl, co-VFX supervisor for ILM.)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.studiodaily.com/filmandvideo/currentissue/Reinventing-Star-Treks-VFX_10905.html |title=Reinventing Star Trek's VFX |first=Barbara |last=Robertson |date=May 13, 2009 |publisher=Film & Video |quote=The Narada was six miles long and the Enterprise is [tpl]convert|2000|ft[/tpl].[/tpl] (Quote from Bruce Holcomb, Digital Model Supervisor for Star Trek.)[tpl]cite web |url=http://features.cgsociety.org/story_custom.php?story_id=5071 |title=Star Trek: Production Focus |publisher=CCGSociety |date=May 26, 2009 |first=Renee |last=Dunlop |quote=One challenge was to sell the weight and scale of the ships that ranged from a 30 foot shuttle to the new Enterprise at [tpl]convert|2357|ft[/tpl] long, to the nemesis ship, the Narada, five miles long.[/tpl] (Source Russell Earl & Roger Guyett, co-VFX Supervisors at ILM.)[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.experience-the-enterprise.com/ |title=Experience the Enterprise |publisher=Paramount Pictures & CBS Studios Inc. |quote=Length: [tpl]convert|2500|ft[/tpl].[/tpl]  In an interview in Cinefex magazine No. 118, Industrial Light & Magic Art Director Alex Jaeger discussed the design's growth in size during early production of the film, saying "The reconfigured ship was a larger vessel than previous manifestations – approximately [tpl]convert|1200|ft[/tpl] long compared to the [tpl]convert|947|foot[/tpl] ship of the original series. Once we got the ship built and started putting it in environments it felt too small. The shuttle bay gave us a clear relative scale – shuttles initially appeared much bigger than we had imagined – so we bumped up the Enterprise scale, which gave her a grander feel and allowed us to include more detail."  A special feature on starships in the Blu-ray Disc (BD) version of the movie gives the length as [tpl]convert|2379|ft[/tpl], which would make it larger than the Next Generation D and E versions, in fact it would be the largest USS Enterprise in the series history. (not counting the XCV 330, which is only seen as a model). This would result in a height of 167m, and a beam of 339m.

==Captain's yacht==

The captain's yacht is a large auxiliary starship built into the design of several Federation starship designs including the Galaxy-class and Sovereign-class. It was docked to the underside of the saucer section. On the USS Enterprise-E, the name of the captain's yacht is the Cousteau. In 2375, the crew of the USS Enterprise-E used the Cousteau to travel to the surface of the Ba'ku homeworld.
Designer Andrew Probert came up with the concept of the captain's yacht while designing the USS Enterprise-D. Although it was never seen in use, it is labeled on the master systems display screen in main engineering, docked at the bottom of the saucer section almost directly opposite the main bridge. Probert suggested possible ways for the yacht to be used during the first season, including not showing the yacht but mentioning it in dialogue, but his ideas were rejected. The Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual (page 164) claims that the producers almost used the yacht in TNG: "Samaritan Snare", but decided to use an "executive shuttlecraft" due to budgetary constraints. According to Patrick Stewart, the yacht would have been called the Calypso. Rick Sternbach designed similar craft into the USS Voyager and the USS Equinox, known as the aeroshuttle and the waverider, respectively. As on the Enterprise-D, however, these vessels were only depicted on technical schematics and never seen in operation or referred to in dialog.
Ronald B. Moore notes in the Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual that real-life naval tradition would insist on calling such a craft the captain's gig rather than the captain's yacht.

==Reception and impact==

thumb|left|Space Shuttle Enterprise As the result of a successful letter writing campaign, NASA named the initial flight-test Space Shuttle Enterprise. In 1994, the real aircraft carrier Enterprise hosted a Star Trek convention, and Star Trek memorabilia could be found throughout the ship.[tpl]cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=VP&p_theme=vp&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_dispstring=CARRIER%20ENTERPRISE%20MEETS%20STARSHIPS%20ENTERPRISE&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=1994&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=%28%22CARRIER%20ENTERPRISE%20MEETS%20STARSHIPS%20ENTERPRISE%22%29&xcal_numdocs=20&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no|title=CARRIER ENTERPRISE MEETS STARSHIPS ENTERPRISE \ STAR TREK FANS PLAN TO BOLDLY GO ABOARD THE NAVY SHIP FOR CONVENTION TOUR|author=DENNIS JOYCE, STAFF WRITER |date=October 28, 1994|work=The Virginian-Pilot Archives|publisher=PilotOnline.com |accessdate=14 May 2012[/tpl]
