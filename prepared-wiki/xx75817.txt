Émile Egger (18 July 1813 – 1 September 1885) was a French scholar who was born in Paris.
From 1840 to 1855, Egger was assistant professor, and from 1855 until his death he was professor of Greek literature in the Faculté des Lettres at Paris University. In 1854 Egger was elected a member of the Académie des Inscriptions and in 1873 of the Conseil supérieur de l'instruction publique.
Egger was a voluminous writer, a sound and discerning scholar, and his influence was largely responsible for the revival of the study of classical philology in France. His most important works are as follows:
He was also the author of Observations et réflexions sur le développement de l'intelligence et du langage chez les enfants (1879).
Egger died in 1885 and was buried at the Cimetière Montparnasse in Paris (facing the western wall, on the far right on entering from the north).
