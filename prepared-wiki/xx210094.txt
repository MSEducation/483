==History==

Due to Charlestown, Rhode Island being a summertime beach and tourism community, the Charlestown Police Department's call volume significantly increases during the summer months. The population in town increases from a year-round population of approx. 8,000 to 20,000 and higher on busy weekends.
From the 1910s to the 1970s, the Town of Charlestown had no organized police department. A part-time Chief of Police and a few constables were appointed by the town council and only used during emergencies. The town's first Chief of Police was Chief Robert P. Day around 1912. Since Chief Day, nine others have held the position including The current chief, Jeffrey Allen.
Current police operations are based out of a brand new state-of-the-art police facility located just off U.S. Route 1 across from Ninigret Park.
