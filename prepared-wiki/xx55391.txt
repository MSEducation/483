Carbonation or fizz is the process of dissolving carbon dioxide in a liquid. The process usually involves carbon dioxide under high pressure. When the pressure is reduced, the carbon dioxide is released from the solution as small bubbles, which causes the solution to become effervescent, or fizzy. An example of carbonation is the dissolving of carbon dioxide in water, resulting in carbonated water.

==Chemistry==

Carbon dioxide is weakly soluble in water, therefore it separates into a gas when the pressure is released.

==Biochemistry==

Carbonation also describes the incorporation of carbon dioxide into chemical compounds. Our carbon-based life originates from a carbonation reaction that is most often catalysed by the enzyme RuBisCO. So important is this carbonation process that a significant fraction of leaf mass consists of this carbonating enzyme.[tpl]cite book |last=Stryer |first=Lubert |last2=Berg |first2=Jeremy Mark |last3=Tymoczko |first3=John L. |title=Biochemistry |edition=5th |publisher=W.
