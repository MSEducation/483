A planet ([tpl]ety|grc|ἀστὴρ πλανήτης (astēr planētēs)|wandering star[/tpl]) is an astronomical object orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals.This definition is drawn from two separate IAU declarations; a formal definition agreed by the IAU in 2006, and an informal working definition established by the IAU in 2001/2003 for objects outside of the Solar System. The official 2006 definition applies only to the Solar System, whereas the 2003 definition applies to planets around other stars. The extrasolar planet issue was deemed too complex to resolve at the 2006 IAU conference.[tpl]cite web |title=IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes |url=http://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau0603/ |publisher=International Astronomical Union |year=2006 |accessdate=2009-12-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web |year=2001 |title=Working Group on Extrasolar Planets (WGESP) of the International Astronomical Union | work=IAU |url=http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html |accessdate=2008-08-23[/tpl]
The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, science, mythology, and religion. The planets were originally seen by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain "planets" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno, Vesta (each an object in the Solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first-discovered trans-Neptunian object), that were once considered planets by the scientific community are no longer viewed as such.
The planets were thought by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and epicycle motions. Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times, it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by Galileo Galilei. By careful analysis of the observation data, Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits were not circular but elliptical. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes, and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.
Planets are generally divided into two main types: large, low-density gas giants and smaller, rocky terrestrials. Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System. In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they are the four terrestrials, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then the four gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Six of the planets are orbited by one or more natural satellites.

Around one in five Sun-like stars is thought to have an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone.

==History==

The idea of planets has evolved over its history, from the divine wandering stars of antiquity to the earthly objects of the scientific age. The concept has expanded to include worlds not only in the Solar System, but in hundreds of other extrasolar systems. The ambiguities inherent in defining planets have led to much scientific controversy.
The five classical planets, being visible to the naked eye, have been known since ancient times and have had a significant impact on mythology, religious cosmology, and ancient astronomy. In ancient times, astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the sky in relation to the other stars. Ancient Greeks called these lights [tpl]lang|grc|πλάνητες ἀστέρες[/tpl] ([tpl]Transl|grc|planetes asteres[/tpl], "wandering stars") or simply [tpl]lang|grc|πλανῆται[/tpl] ([tpl]Transl|grc|planētai[/tpl], "wanderers"),πλανήτης, H. G. Liddell and R. Scott, A Greek–English Lexicon, ninth edition, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940). from which today's word "planet" was derived.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/planet |title=Definition of planet |publisher=Merriam-Webster OnLine |accessdate=2007-07-23[/tpl] In ancient Greece, China, Babylon, and indeed all pre-modern civilizations,[tpl]cite journal |first=Otto E. |last=Neugebauer |year=1945 |title=The History of Ancient Astronomy Problems and Methods |journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=1–38 |doi=10.1086/370729[/tpl][tpl]cite book |first=Colin |last=Ronan |title=Astronomy in China, Korea and Japan |edition=Walker |chapter=Astronomy Before the Telescope |pages=264–265[/tpl] it was almost universally believed that Earth was the center of the Universe and that all the "planets" circled Earth. The reasons for this perception were that stars and planets appeared to revolve around Earth each day[tpl]cite book |first=Thomas S. |last=Kuhn |title=The Copernican Revolution |pages=5–20 |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1957 |isbn=0-674-17103-9[/tpl] and the apparently common-sense perceptions that Earth was solid and stable and that it was not moving but at rest.

===Babylon===

The first civilization known to possess a functional theory of the planets were the Babylonians, who lived in Mesopotamia in the first and second millennia BC. The oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the Babylonian Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa, a 7th-century BC copy of a list of observations of the motions of the planet Venus, that probably dates as early as the second millennium BC. The MUL.APIN is a pair of cuneiform tablets dating from the 7th century BC that lays out the motions of the Sun, Moon and planets over the course of the year.[tpl]cite book|author= Francesca Rochberg|chapter=Astronomy and Calendars in Ancient Mesopotamia|title= Civilizations of the Ancient Near East|volume= III|editor=Jack Sasson|year=2000|page=1930[/tpl] The Babylonian astrologers also laid the foundations of what would eventually become Western astrology.[tpl]cite book |last=Holden |first=James Herschel |title=A History of Horoscopic Astrology |year=1996 |publisher=AFA |isbn=978-0-86690-463-6 |page=1[/tpl] The Enuma anu enlil, written during the Neo-Assyrian period in the 7th century BC,[tpl]cite book | volume=8 |series=State Archives of Assyria |title=Astrological reports to Assyrian kings |editor=Hermann Hunger |year=1992 |publisher=Helsinki University Press |isbn=951-570-130-9[/tpl] comprises a list of omens and their relationships with various celestial phenomena including the motions of the planets.[tpl]cite journal |title=Babylonian Planetary Omens.

===Greco-Roman astronomy===

The ancient Greeks initially did not attach as much significance to the planets as the Babylonians. The Pythagoreans, in the 6th and 5th centuries BC appear to have developed their own independent planetary theory, which consisted of the Earth, Sun, Moon, and planets revolving around a "Central Fire" at the center of the Universe. Pythagoras or Parmenides is said to have been the first to identify the evening star (Hesperos) and morning star (Phosphoros) as one and the same (Aphrodite, Greek corresponding to Latin Venus).[tpl]cite book | first=John |last=Burnet |title= Greek philosophy: Thales to Plato |year=1950 |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |pages=7–11 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=7yUAmmqHHEgC&pg=PR4 |accessdate=2008-02-07 |isbn=978-1-4067-6601-1[/tpl] In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of Samos proposed a heliocentric system, according to which Earth and the planets revolved around the Sun. However, the geocentric system would remain dominant until the Scientific Revolution.
By the 1st century BC, during the Hellenistic period, the Greeks had begun to develop their own mathematical schemes for predicting the positions of the planets. These schemes, which were based on geometry rather than the arithmetic of the Babylonians, would eventually eclipse the Babylonians' theories in complexity and comprehensiveness, and account for most of the astronomical movements observed from Earth with the naked eye. These theories would reach their fullest expression in the Almagest written by Ptolemy in the 2nd century CE. So complete was the domination of Ptolemy's model that it superseded all previous works on astronomy and remained the definitive astronomical text in the Western world for 13 centuries. To the Greeks and Romans there were seven known planets, each presumed to be circling Earth according to the complex laws laid out by Ptolemy. They were, in increasing order from Earth (in Ptolemy's order): the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.[tpl]cite web | url= http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50180718?query_type=word&queryword=planet |publisher = Oxford English Dictionary | title = planet, n | accessdate=2008-02-07|year=2007[/tpl] Note: select the Etymology tab [tpl]cite journal |first=Bernard R. |last=Goldstein |title=Saving the phenomena: the background to Ptolemy's planetary theory | journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |volume=28 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=1–12 |location=Cambridge (UK) |bibcode=1997JHA....28....1G[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title=Ptolemy's Almagest |author1= Ptolemy |authorlink=Ptolemy |author2=Toomer, G.

===India===

In 499 CE, the Indian astronomer Aryabhata propounded a planetary model that explicitly incorporated Earth's rotation about its axis, which he explains as the cause of what appears to be an apparent westward motion of the stars. He also believed that the orbit of planets are elliptical.J. J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson, Aryabhata the Elder, MacTutor History of Mathematics archive''
Aryabhata's followers were particularly strong in South India, where his principles of the diurnal rotation of Earth, among others, were followed and a number of secondary works were based on them.Sarma, K. V. (1997) "Astronomy in India" in Selin, Helaine (editor) Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures, Kluwer Academic Publishers, ISBN 0-7923-4066-3, p. 116
In 1500, Nilakantha Somayaji of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics, in his Tantrasangraha, revised Aryabhata's model.[tpl]cite journal |title=Model of planetary motion in the works of Kerala astronomers |last=Ramasubramanian |first=K. |journal=Bulletin of the Astronomical Society of India |volume=26 |pages=11–31 23–4 |year=1998 |bibcode=1998BASI...26...11R[/tpl] In his Aryabhatiyabhasya, a commentary on Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya, he developed a planetary model where Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits Earth, similar to the Tychonic system later proposed by Tycho Brahe in the late 16th century. Most astronomers of the Kerala school who followed him accepted his planetary model.Ramasubramanian etc. (1994)

===European Renaissance===

With the advent of the Scientific Revolution, understanding of the term "planet" changed from something that moved across the sky (in relation to the star field); to a body that orbited Earth (or that were believed to do so at the time); and by the 18th century to something that directly orbited the Sun when the heliocentric model of Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler gained sway.
Thus, Earth became included in the list of planets, whereas the Sun and Moon were excluded. At first, when the first satellites of Jupiter and Saturn were discovered in the 17th century, the terms "planet" and "satellite" were used interchangeably – although the latter would gradually become more prevalent in the following century.See primary citations in Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons Until the mid-19th century, the number of "planets" rose rapidly because any newly discovered object directly orbiting the Sun was listed as a planet by the scientific community.

===19th century===

In the 19th century astronomers began to realize that recently discovered bodies that had been classified as planets for almost half a century (such as Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta) were very different from the traditional ones. These bodies shared the same region of space between Mars and Jupiter (the asteroid belt), and had a much smaller mass; as a result they were reclassified as "asteroids". In the absence of any formal definition, a "planet" came to be understood as any "large" body that orbited the Sun. Because there was a dramatic size gap between the asteroids and the planets, and the spate of new discoveries seemed to have ended after the discovery of Neptune in 1846, there was no apparent need to have a formal definition.[tpl]cite web | last =Hilton |first =James L. |date = 2001-09-17 |url =http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/minorplanets.php |title =When Did the Asteroids Become Minor Planets? |publisher =U.S. Naval Observatory |accessdate = 2007-04-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070921162818/http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/minorplanets.php |archivedate = 2007-09-21[/tpl]

===20th century===

However, in the 20th century, Pluto was discovered. After initial observations led to the belief it was larger than Earth,[tpl]cite book | title = Planet Quest: The Epic Discovery of Alien Solar Systems |first = K. |last=Croswell |publisher = The Free Press |year = 1997 |page = 57 |isbn = 978-0-684-83252-4[/tpl] the object was immediately accepted as the ninth planet. Further monitoring found the body was actually much smaller: in 1936, Raymond Lyttleton suggested that Pluto may be an escaped satellite of Neptune,[tpl]cite journal | last=Lyttleton |first=Raymond A. |year=1936 |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=97 |page=108 |title= On the possible results of an encounter of Pluto with the Neptunian system |bibcode=1936MNRAS..97..108L[/tpl] and Fred Whipple suggested in 1964 that Pluto may be a comet.[tpl]cite journal | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=52 |pages=565–594 |last=Whipple |first=Fred |year=1964 |bibcode=1964PNAS...52..565W |title= The History of the Solar System |doi= 10.1073/pnas.52.2.565 | pmid=16591209 | issue=2 | pmc=300311[/tpl] However, as it was still larger than all known asteroids and seemingly did not exist within a larger population,[tpl]cite journal | journal=Scientific American |year=1996 |pages=46–52 |last1=Luu |first1=Jane X. |author2=Jewitt, David C. |title=The Kuiper Belt |volume=274 |issue=5 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0596-46[/tpl] it kept its status until 2006.
In 1992, astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail announced the discovery of planets around a pulsar, PSR B1257+12. This discovery is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of a planetary system around another star. Then, on October 6, 1995, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva announced the first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star (51 Pegasi).[tpl]cite journal | last1=Mayor |first1=Michel |author2=Queloz, Didier | title=A Jupiter-mass companion to a solar-type star | journal=Nature | year=1995 | volume=378 | issue=6356 | pages=355–359 | doi= 10.1038/378355a0 | bibcode=1995Natur.378..355M[/tpl]
The discovery of extrasolar planets led to another ambiguity in defining a planet: the point at which a planet becomes a star. Many known extrasolar planets are many times the mass of Jupiter, approaching that of stellar objects known as "brown dwarfs".[tpl]cite web | year=2006 |title=IAU General Assembly: Definition of Planet debate | url=http://astro2006.meta.mediastream.cz/Astro2006-060822-01.asx |format=.wmv |publisher=MediaStream.cz |accessdate=2008-08-23[/tpl] Brown dwarfs are generally considered stars due to their ability to fuse deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen. Although objects more massive than 75 times that of Jupiter fuse hydrogen, objects of only 13 Jupiter masses can fuse deuterium. However, deuterium is quite rare, and most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusing deuterium long before their discovery, making them effectively indistinguishable from supermassive planets.[tpl]cite journal | last=Basri |first=Gibor |title= Observations of Brown Dwarfs |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |year=2000 |volume=38 | issue=1 |page=485 |doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.38.1.485 |bibcode=2000ARA&A..38..485B[/tpl]

===21st century===

With the discovery during the latter half of the 20th century of more objects within the Solar System and large objects around other stars, disputes arose over what should constitute a planet. There were particular disagreements over whether an object should be considered a planet if it was part of a distinct population such as a belt, or if it was large enough to generate energy by the thermonuclear fusion of deuterium.
A growing number of astronomers argued for Pluto to be declassified as a planet, because many similar objects approaching its size had been found in the same region of the Solar System (the Kuiper belt) during the 1990s and early 2000s. Pluto was found to be just one small body in a population of thousands.
Some of them including Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris were heralded in the popular press as the tenth planet, failing however to receive widespread scientific recognition. The announcement of Eris in 2005, an object 27% more massive than Pluto, created the necessity and public desire for an official definition of a planet.
Acknowledging the problem, the IAU set about creating the definition of planet, and produced one in August 2006. The number of planets dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had cleared their orbit (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), and a new class of dwarf planets was created, initially containing three objects (Ceres, Pluto and Eris).[tpl]cite journal | last=Green |first=D.

====Extrasolar planet definition====

In 2003, The International Astronomical Union (IAU) Working Group on Extrasolar Planets made a position statement on the definition of a planet that incorporated the following working definition, mostly focused upon the boundary between planets and brown dwarfs:
This definition has since been widely used by astronomers when publishing discoveries of exoplanets in academic journals.See for example the list of references for: [tpl]cite web | author=Butler, R. P. et al. |year=2006 |url=http://exoplanets.org/ |title=Catalog of Nearby Exoplanets |publisher =University of California and the Carnegie Institution |accessdate = 2008-08-23[/tpl] Although temporary, it remains an effective working definition until a more permanent one is formally adopted. However, it does not address the dispute over the lower mass limit,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/outerplanets-04b.html |title=Gravity Rules: The Nature and Meaning of Planethood |last=Stern |first=S. Alan |date=2004-03-22 |publisher=SpaceDaily |accessdate=2008-08-23[/tpl] and so it steered clear of the controversy regarding objects within the Solar System. This definition also makes no comment on the planetary status of objects orbiting brown dwarfs, such as 2M1207b.
One definition of a sub-brown dwarf is a planet-mass object that formed through cloud collapse rather than accretion. This formation distinction between a sub-brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon; astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation process of a planet as part of its division in classification.[ref]
