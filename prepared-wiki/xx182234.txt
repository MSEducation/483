Chamaeleon (or Chameleon, [tpl]lang-el|Χαμαιλέων[/tpl]; c. 350 -c. 275 BC), was a Peripatetic philosopher of Heraclea Pontica. He was one of the immediate disciples of Aristotle. He wrote works on several of the ancient Greek poets, namely: 
He also wrote on the Iliad, and on Comedy (περι κωμῳδίας). In this last work he treated, among other subjects, of the dances of comedy.Athenaeus, xiv. 628 This work is quoted by AthenaeusAthenaeus, ix. 374 by the title περὶ τῆς ἀρχαίας κωμῳδίας, which is also the title of a work by the Peripatetic philosopher Eumelus.  It would seem also that he wrote on Hesiod, for Diogenes Laërtius says, that Chamaeleon accused Heraclides Ponticus of having stolen from him his work concerning Homer and Hesiod.Diogenes Laërtius, v. 6. § 92. The above works were probably both biographical and critical. He also wrote works entitled περὶ θεῶν, and περὶ σατύρων, and some moral treatises, περι ἡδονῆς (which was also ascribed to Theophrastus), προτρεπικόν, and περι μέθης. Of all his works only a few fragments are preserved by Athenaeus and other ancient writers.
