Koha is an open source Integrated Library System (ILS), used world-wide by public, school and special libraries.  The name comes from a Māori term for a gift or donation.

==Features==

Koha is web-based ILS, with a SQL database (MySQL preferred) backend with cataloguing data stored in MARC and accessible via Z39.50 or SRU. The user interface is very configurable and adaptable and has been translated into many languages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://koha-community.org/2101koha-3-2-3/ |title=Koha 3.2.3 is now available | Koha Library Software Community |publisher=Koha-community.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl] Koha has most of the features that would be expected in an ILS, including:

==History==

Koha was created in 1999 by Katipo Communications for the Horowhenua Library Trust in New Zealand, and the first installation went live in January 2000.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6350| title=Koha: a Gift to Libraries from New Zealand| date=1 February 2003| first=Pat| last=Eyler[/tpl]
From 2000, companies started providing commercial support for koha, building to more than 20 today.[tpl]cite web|url=http://koha-community.org/support/paid-support/ |title=Paid Support | Koha Library Software Community |publisher=Koha-community.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl]
In 2001, Paul Poulain (of Marseille, France) began adding many new features to Koha, most significantly support for multiple languages.BibLibre By 2010, Koha has been translated from its original English into French, Chinese, Arabic and several other languages. Support for the cataloguing and search standards MARC and Z39.50 was added in 2002 and later sponsored by the Athens County Public Libraries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.myacpl.org/library/koha |title=The Koha Project | Athens County Public Libraries |publisher=Myacpl.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl]  In France Paul Poulain co-founded BibLibre in 2007.About BibLibre Biblibre main Website
In 2005, an Ohio-based company, Metavore, Inc., trading as LibLime, was established to support Koha and added many new features, including support for Zebra sponsored by the Crawford County Federated Library System. Zebra support increased the speed of searches as well as improving scalability to support tens of millions of bibliographic records.
In 2007 a group of libraries in Vermont began testing the use of Koha for Vermont libraries. At first a separate implementation was created for each library. Then the Vermont Organization of Koha Automated Libraries (VOKAL) was organized to create one database to be used by libraries. This database was rolled out in 2011. Thirty-seven libraries have chosen to adopt Koha and moved to the shared production environment hosted and supported by ByWater Solutions.[tpl]cite web|title=VOKAL, The Vermont Koha Project|url=http://www.vermontlibraries.org/vokal-the-vermont-koha-project|work=Green Mountain Library Consortium|accessdate=9 December 2011[/tpl] Previously Vermont used software from Follett.[tpl]cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/vokalvtpublic/ |title=VOKAL VT Public |publisher=Sites.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl]

===Dispute with LibLime / PTFS===

In 2009 a dispute arose between LibLime and other members of the Koha community. The dispute centred on LibLime's apparent reluctance to be inclusive with the content of the http://koha.org/ sites and the non-contribution of software patches back to the community. A number of participants declared that they believed that LibLime had forked the software and the community.[tpl]cite web|author=Joann Ransom |url=http://library-matters.blogspot.com/2009/09/liblime-forks-koha.html |title=Library Matters: Liblime forks Koha |publisher=Library-matters.blogspot.com |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.librarian.net/stax/2967/koha-and-liblime-and-the-letter-and-the-spirit-of-open-source/ |title=Blog Archive » Koha and LibLime and the letter and the spirit of open source |publisher=librarian.net |date=2009-08-06 |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://blog.libraryjournal.com/tennantdigitallibraries/2009/09/15/liblime-to-the-koha-community-fork-you/ |title=LibLime To the Koha Community: Fork You! « Tennant: Digital Libraries |publisher=Blog.libraryjournal.com |date=2009-09-15 |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://librariansmatter.com/blog/2009/09/19/the-koha-fork-and-being-the-change-you-want-to-see/ |title=The Koha fork and being the change you want to see |publisher=Librarians Matter |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://lwn.net/Articles/386284/ |title=Koha community squares off against commercial fork |publisher=Lwn.net |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl]http://irc.koha-community.org/irclog/koha/2010-02-02#i_381857 Log of IRC discussion and vote, February 2, 2010. A separate web presence, source code repository and community was established at http://koha-community.org/ . The fork continued after March 2010, when LibLime was purchased by PTFS.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6714841.html |title=LibLime Acquisition by PTFS Marks a New Era for Koha |publisher=Libraryjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl]
In November, 2011, LibLime announced they had been granted a provisional trademark on the use of the name koha in New Zealand by Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.liblime.com/ptfsliblime-granted-provisional-use-of-koha-trademark-in-new-zealand |title=PTFS/LibLime Granted Provisional Use of Koha Trademark in New Zealand |publisher=Liblime.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-25[/tpl] The provisional trademark grant was successfully appealed by the Koha community lead by Catalyst, with a decision handed down in December 2013http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/morningreport/audio/2579603/koha-trademark-case-won-by-nz-developers and with Liblime to pay costs.http://www.itwire.com/business-it-news/open-source/62619-koha-wins-trademark-stoush-with-us-defence-contractorhttp://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11172076(2013) NZIPOTM 47

==Current status==

The latest stable release of Koha is 3.14.6[tpl]cite web|url=http://download.koha-community.org/ |title=Koha downloads |publisher=Download.koha-community.org[/tpl]
Koha is currently a very active project. According to ohloh, it has  a very large, active development team and a mature, well-established codebase.[tpl]cite web|last=Azevedo |first=Andre |url=https://www.ohloh.net/p/koha |title=Koha Library Automation Package |publisher=Ohloh.net |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18[/tpl] The analysis of the size of the code base may be deceptive because Koha stores  user interface translations alongside actual source code and ohloh cannot always distinguish them.
