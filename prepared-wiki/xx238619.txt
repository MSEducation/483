==History==

San Dimas High School was opened in 1970 to serve the growing population of San Dimas, Californiahttp://sandimashigh.com/index.php/95-news/2-sample-feature-article.  A distinctive bell tower was built on campus in 1980 to create an icon for the main quad. The bell tower houses the bell from the original San Dimas Elementary School and is rung each time a team wins a CIF Championship. The bell tower was refurbished in 2011 with a wider base to support the structure http://sandimashigh.com/index.php/95-news/233-bell-tower-facelift. Each year the school plays their cross town rivals, Bonita High School, in the Smudge Pot Bowl football game http://www.sgvtribune.com/ci_18801995?IADID=Search-www.sgvtribune.com-www.sgvtribune.com. The winner of the game takes home a silver smudge pot reminiscent of the area's citrus growing history.
