Randy Pedersen (born 1962) is a professional bowler and color analyst for ESPN's coverage of the PBA Tour.  He works alongside play-by-play commentator Lon McEachern.  Pedersen grew up in Southern California, but relocated to Clermont, Florida in the early 1990s, where he has resided ever since.  He and his wife Becky have two children: a son, Chad and a daughter, Savannah.

==Bowling career==

As a bowler, Pedersen has won 13 PBA titles, with his last coming at age 40 in the 2002 Pepsi Open. That title pushed him over the $1 million career earnings mark, making him the 24th millionaire in PBA history at the time.  Most dominant from the mid-1980s to early 1990s, Pedersen captured the prestigious PBA National Championship crown in 1987.  
At the same time, he is also known for two of the worst breaks in PBA history.  He lost both his tour exemption and a PBA Tournament of Champions match due to leaving one pin standing in the last frame on each of those occasions.  He was ranked #35 on the PBA's 2008 list of 50 Greatest Players of the last 50 years.  
Pedersen was elected to the PBA Hall of Fame in October, 2010, and was inducted with the 2011 class on January 22, 2011.Schneider, Jerry. "Randy Pedersen, Dale Eagle and Len Nicholson Elected to PBA Hall of Fame." Article at www.pba.com on October 20, 2010.
Randy joined the PBA50 Tour (formerly PBA Senior Tour) in 2013, and on May 16 of that year he won the very first tournament he entered: the PBA50 Dayton Classic.Randy Pedersen is Unlikely Winner in PBA50 Dayton Classic Schneider, Jerry at pba.com, May 16, 2013.

==Television and Film==

Off the lanes, Pedersen has had great success behind the microphone as a TV analyst since joining ESPN in 2001; Pedersen earned the position after getting his start in broadcasting as a lane-level reporter on ABC's Pro Bowlers Tour.  He also worked for Fox Sports Net for a brief time in 2000. 
Pedersen has been lauded for his extensive knowledge of the game, associated bowling lingo and catch phrases (see below) as well as his sense of humor.  He also had a small part in the 1996 comedy movie Kingpin along with several other professional bowlers.

Pedersen once commented on his role as PBA Analyst on ESPN telecasts.  He said, "I want to convey to the viewing public that they are watching the best bowlers in the world.  It's my job to explain what makes them that good, as well as provide other information that 'Johnny 150 average' doesn't already know. One thing I learned is if you can bring enthusiasm to the table, sometimes it doesn't really matter what is coming out of your mouth.  The viewing audience senses the enthusiasm."
