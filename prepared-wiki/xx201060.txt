==Football career==

Djalmir was born in Aracaju, Sergipe. After only playing in modest clubs in his homeland, he moved to Portugal in 2000, going on to remain in the country for the following 12 years. He started with F.C. Famalicão in the third division and, after scoring 15 goals in each of his two seasons (only playing in the first half of 2001–02), moved straight to the top level with C.F. Os Belenenses, where he failed to reproduce his previous form. 
From 2003 to 2009 Djalmir competed in division two, with S.C. Salgueiros, C.D. Feirense and S.C. Olhanense. In the latter season, with the last, he netted a career-best 20 goals in 27 games, helping the Algarve side return to the top division after a lengthy absence;[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/futebol/nacional/interior.aspx?content_id=383359|title=Boavista-Olhanense, 1–4: Goleada de olho na subida|trans_title=Boavista-Olhanense, 1–4: Routing to eye promotion|publisher=Record|language=Portuguese|date=1 March 2009|accessdate=24 April 2014[/tpl] in 2009–10 he added 12 in only 17 appearances as the club retained its league status.
In the following two seasons Djalmir was used sparingly by Olhanense. On 1 May 2011, however, he scored in the 93rd minute for the final 1–1 home draw against S.L. Benfica, which certified his team's permanence in the main category.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.portugoal.net/index.php/more-liga-sagres-news/23641-imperious-porto-march-on-benfica-draw|title=Imperious Porto march on|publisher=PortuGOAL|date=2 May 2011|accessdate=4 September 2012[/tpl]
