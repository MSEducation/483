==Politics==

Jamyang Norbu has been called a "radical Tibetan separatist" by the People's Daily.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://chinatibet.people.com.cn/6789022.html|title=Tibetan separatist exposes Dalai Lama's "democracy myth"|date=2009-10-21|accessdate=2010-09-06|publisher=China Tibet Information Center|agency=People's Daily[/tpl] His advocacy for complete Tibetan independence and criticism of the nonviolent "Middle Way" autonomy plan of the Central Tibetan Administration has led him to push for more "confrontational" methods.
Jamyang Norbu is also critical of the role of religion in the Tibetan exile community, and of its Western benefactors whom, he argues, see Tibetans one-dimensionally.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=21740|title=IT’S NOT THE ECONOMY, STUPID!|first=Jamyang|last=Norbu|publisher=phayul.com|date=2008-06-23|accessdate=2010-09-06[/tpl] He calls the "New Age perception of Tibet... that this even materialist west will be saved by the spiritualism of the Tibetan Buddhists" "total nonsense."[tpl]Cite web|title=jamyang norbu|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tibet/interviews/norbu.html|work=Dreams of Tibet|publisher=Frontline|year=1994|accessdate=2010-09-06[/tpl] He said of a scene from the American film Seven Years in Tibet where Tibetan monks rescue earthworms from a construction site, that Tibetan viewers would find it ridiculous.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Mountains, monks, and mandalas: 'Kundun' and 'Seven Years in Tibet.'|first=Mark|last=Abramson|publisher=Cineaste|volume=23|number=3|pages=8–12|date=Summer 1998|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-EPT/abramson.htm|accessdate=2010-09-06[/tpl] In a 2005 article for the New Humanist, he recalled an outbreak of rabies in 1983 Dharamsala: when he advocated that a Tibetan woman get a rabies shot instead of seeing a shaman, he was shunned in the community as a "nonbeliever." He lamented, "We are frankly, a people still in thrall to ignorance and superstition, which far from declining with the years seems to be gaining new life and impetus with foreign sponsorship and encouragement."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/904/trapped-by-buddha|title=Trapped by buddha|first=Jamyang|last=Norbu|volume=120|issue=4|date=July–August 2005|accessdate=2010-09-06|publisher=New Humanist[/tpl]
