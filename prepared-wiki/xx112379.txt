CJPN-FM is a French-language Canadian radio station in Fredericton, New Brunswick, broadcasting at 90.5 MHz.
The station signed on in 1997 from its studios at Ã‰cole Sainte-Anne.Decision CRTC 96-707
CJPN-FM airs live programming from its own studios, as well as francophone music from Quebec, Acadia and other regions.
In June 2013, CJPN announced that due to financial difficulties, the station may close as early as July 15 if additional funding is not secured; the station needs at least $25,000 to stay on the air after July 15, and $50,000 to stay on through the end of 2013. A shutdown of the station would leave Fredericton without a locally-based French-language station.[tpl]cite news|last=Yard|first=Bridget|title=Fredericton's only French radio station may close|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/story/2013/06/17/nb-french-radio-fredericton-cjpn.html?autoplay=true|accessdate=June 19, 2013|newspaper=CBC News|date=June 18, 2013[/tpl]
