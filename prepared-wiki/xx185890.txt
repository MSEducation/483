The renin receptor also known as ATPase H(+)-transporting lysosomal accessory protein 2, or the prorenin receptor, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ATP6AP2 gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Ludwig J, Kerscher S, Brandt U, Pfeiffer K, Getlawi F, Apps DK, Schagger H | title = Identification and characterization of a novel 9.2-kDa membrane sector-associated protein of vacuolar proton-ATPase from chromaffin granules | journal = J Biol Chem | volume = 273 | issue = 18 | pages = 10939–47 |date=Jun 1998 | pmid = 9556572 | pmc =  | doi =10.1074/jbc.273.18.10939  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Demirci FY, White NJ, Rigatti BW, Lewis KF, Gorin MB | title = Identification, genomic structure, and screening of the vacuolar proton-ATPase membrane sector-associated protein M8-9 gene within the COD1 critical region (Xp11.4) | journal = Mol Vis | volume = 7 | issue =  | pages = 234–9 |date=Oct 2001 | pmid = 11590366 | pmc =  | doi =  [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: ATP6AP2 ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal accessory protein 2| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=10159| accessdate = [/tpl]

==Function==

The renin receptor binds renin and prorenin. Binding of renin to this receptor induces the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I.[tpl]cite journal | author = Nguyen G, Delarue F, Burcklé C, Bouzhir L, Giller T, Sraer JD | title = Pivotal role of the renin/prorenin receptor in angiotensin II production and cellular responses to renin | journal = J.

This protein is associated with adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases). Proton-translocating ATPases have fundamental roles in energy conservation, secondary active transport, acidification of intracellular compartments, and cellular pH homeostasis. There are three classes of ATPases- F, P, and V. The vacuolar (V-type) ATPases have a transmembrane proton-conducting sector and an extramembrane catalytic sector. This protein has been found associated with the transmembrane sector of the V-type ATPases.
