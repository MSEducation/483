==History==

Idearc Media, formerly Verizon Information Services, was spun off from Verizon in 2006. It consisted of Superpages.com and functioned as publisher of the Verizon Yellow Pages, which itself consisted of the former directory operations of Bell Atlantic, NYNEX, and GTE. It also offered "Solutions Direct" full-color direct mail postcards.  It previously offered several proprietary magazines such as "Solutions at Hand" and "Solutions at Home".[tpl]cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2007_August_31/ai_n27360860/ |title=Solutions at Hand and Solutions at Home |author= |date=August 31, 2007 |work= |publisher=bNet Business Wire |accessdate=3 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.supermedia.com/media-network/our-brands |title=Our Brands |author= |date= |work= |publisher=SuperMedia  |accessdate=3 September 2010[/tpl]
