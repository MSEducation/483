[[HSwMS Älvsnabben (M01)]]

CATEGORIES: Mine warfare vessels of the Swedish Navy, 1943 ships

HSwMS ''Älvsnabben'' was a minelayer of the Swedish Navy.  She was built as a freighter, but was requisitioned by the Swedish Navy in 1943.
A single screw and good fuel economy meant that she was used as the cadet training vessel of the Swedish Navy for a number of years, and she travelled the globe multiple times.
