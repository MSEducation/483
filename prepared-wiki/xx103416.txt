The NWA Western States Heritage Championship was a short-lived National Wrestling Alliance title in World Championship Wrestling that was filled via a tournament in the Universal Wrestling Federation in 1987, and defended in WCW until it was abandoned in 1989.
It has long been reported that when Ric Flair took the NWA/WCW World Heavyweight Championship "Big Gold Belt" with him when he was fired and eventually went to the World Wrestling Federation, the NWA Western States Heritage Championship belt was used as the WCW World Heavyweight Championship belt for one night at the 1991 Great American Bash; a gold plate with the words "WCW WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION" was tacked onto the Western States Title's faceplate. In truth, however, Zbyszko took the title with him to the American Wrestling Association and was even photographed with both the WSH and AWA title belts. The actual belt used at the Great American Bash is now believed to have been the heavyweight championship belt that was used by the Professional Wrestling Federation, Dusty Rhodes' short-lived post-Championship Wrestling from Florida promotion.[tpl]cite book | author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | year=2006|edition=4th | isbn=0-9698161-5-4 [/tpl]
