CATEGORIES: Dwarves (mythology), Elves, Frankish kings, German heroic legends, Germanic mythology, Nibelung tradition

In the  Middle High German Nibelungenlied, Alberich   is a dwarf, who guards the treasure of the Nibelungen, but is overcome by Siegfried.
News of the gold robbery and ring of power incited gods and giants alike to action.  The giants Fafner and Fasolt demanded the ring in payment for building Valhalla, and carried off Freyja as a hostage.  In the border, the gods, Odin, Frigg, Loki, Freyr, and Thor all search despairingly for the hidden treasure.

==Wagner==

In Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen, Alberich is chief of the Nibelungen race of dwarfs and the main antagonist driving events. He gains the power to forge the ring after renouncing love. His brother, the smith Mime, creates the Tarnhelm for Alberich. Hagen, the murderer of the hero Siegfried, is son of Alberich. 
Wagner's Alberich is a composite character, mostly based on Alberich from the Nibelungenlied, but also on Andvari from Norse mythology. He has been widely described, most notably by Theodor Adorno, as a negative Jewish stereotype, with his race expressed through "distorted" music and "muttering" speech;[tpl]cite book |last=Schausten| first=Monika |editor-first=Barbara| editor-last=Kosta |title=Writing against boundaries: nationality, ethnicity and gender in the German-speaking context |publisher=Rodopi |year=2003 |pages=9–27 |chapter="Only Germany raises real men for the world": Richard Wagner's Ring des Nibelungen, Nation, and the Third Reich[/tpl][tpl]Cite book |title=Wagner: Race and Revolution |last=Rose |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Lawrence Rose |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1996 |pages=69–70[/tpl][tpl]Cite book |title=Richard Wagner and the Anti-Semitic Imagination |last=Weiner |first=Mark |pages=135–143 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=1997[/tpl] other critics, however, disagree with this assessment.See e.g. [tpl]Cite book|title=I Saw the World End: A study of Wagner's Ring |authorlink=Deryck Cooke |last=Cooke |first=Deryck | publisher=Oxford University Press| page=264[/tpl]
