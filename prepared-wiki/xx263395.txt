Kirkburton railway station served the village of Kirkburton, West Yorkshire, England until closure in 1930.

==History==

The Huddersfield-Kirkburton Branch Line opened on 7 October 1867, serving [tpl]rws|Deighton[/tpl], [tpl]rws|Kirkheaton[/tpl], [tpl]rws|Fenay Bridge and Lepton[/tpl] and Kirkburton.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lostrailwayswestyorkshire.co.uk/Kirkburton%20Branch.htm |title=Lost Railways of West Yorkshire - Kirkburton  Branch |date=2007 |accessdate=23 December 2010[/tpl] It was unusual in that it was built by the London and North Western Railway in an area where the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway had a virtual monopoly. Plans to extend the line to [tpl]rws|Barnsley[/tpl] never materialised and so Kirkburton remained at the end of the line. It was primarily used for the transportation of goods, although passenger services ran until the station closed on 28 July 1930.[tpl]cite book |last=Butt |first=R.V.J. |title=The Directory of Railway Stations |year=1995 |publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd |location=Yeovil |isbn=1-85260-508-1 |id=R508 |page=135 |ref=harv [/tpl] These terminated shortly after the LMS had gained a half share in Huddersfield Corporation bus operations.[tpl]cite book |title=Huddersfield - The Corporation Bus Story |first1=Peter |last1=Cardno |first2=Stephen |last2=Harling |publisher=Robin Hood Publishing |year=2003 |isbn=0 948854 15 4 |page=[tpl]page needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] [/tpl] The line continued to be used to transport goods until 1965, when a combination of road haulage and a decline in industry lead to closure.  A one-mile stub off the main line at [tpl]rws|Deighton[/tpl] remained to serve the ICI works until February 1971.[tpl]cite book |title=The Huddersfield and Kirkburton Branch |first=J.N. |last=Fisher |publisher=Oakwood Press |year=1997 |isbn=0 85361 510 1 |page=[tpl]page needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] [/tpl]
The bulk of the station site is now occupied by a housing development along North Wood Park, which follows the old track bed. A retaining wall and arch remain at the junction of North Wood Park and North Road (B6116).
