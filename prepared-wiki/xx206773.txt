Cheese Days is a biannual celebration of cheese and the dairy industry, taking place in Monroe, Wisconsin.  The weekend long event typically occurs on the third weekend in September of even-numbered years in the historic downtown area known as “the Square”.  The festivities include carnival rides, a variety of local food, restaurant, craft, and club stands, live, traditional Swiss-Germanic music (including polkas and waltzes), and a culmination of it all into a two-hour parade on the Sunday afternoon.  Over one hundred thousand people come for the festivities throughout the three-day event.
