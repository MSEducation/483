The Quinn River, once known as the Queen River, is an intermittent river, approximately [tpl]convert|110|mi[/tpl] long, in the desert of northwestern Nevada in the United States. It drains an enclosed basin inside the larger Great Basin.
It rises in northeastern Humboldt County, on the west side of the Santa Rosa Range, just south of the Oregon state line. Its course flows southwest, through the main Nevada lands of the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribes and then south and southwest, receiving the Kings River flowing south from Kings River Valley. The Quinn River evaporates in a sink at the Black Rock Desert approximately [tpl]convert|60|mi[/tpl] northwest of Winnemucca on the Hog John Ranch of the Fort McDermitt Paiute-Shoshone Tribe.
