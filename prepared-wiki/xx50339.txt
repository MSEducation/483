The Plains-wanderer (Pedionomus torquatus) or Plains Wanderer, is a bird, the only representative of its family. It is endemic to Australia.  The majority of the remaining population are found in the Riverina region of New South Wales.

==Description==

The Plains-wanderer is a quail-like ground bird, measuring 15–19 cm. The adult male is light brown above, with fawn-white underparts with black crescents. The adult female has a distinctive white-spotted black collar. They are poor flyers, preferring to run when startled. Females lay four eggs, which the male then incubates.[tpl]cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author= Archibald, George W.|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds|publisher= Merehurst Press|location=London|pages= 101|isbn= 1-85391-186-0[/tpl]

==Taxonomy==

It was formerly believed to be related to the buttonquails and thus placed in the gamebird order Galliformes or with the cranes and rails in Gruiformes. DNA-DNA hybridization and RAG-1 sequence data  places it as a wader related to the jacanas (Sibley & Ahlquist 1990, Paton et al. 2003, Thomas et al. 2004, van Tuinen et al. 2004). It thus represents a remarkable case of morphological convergence, or perhaps it is simply extremely plesiomorphic in morphology (the buttonquails, meanwhile, having turned out to be a very basal offshoot of the wader radiation). In the latter case, this would mean that the jacanas, painted snipe and seedsnipes – all ecologically very different birds – all evolved from birds very similar to the living Plains-wanderer.

==Status and conservation==

Population decline has been caused by the conversion of native grasslands to cultivation.  Sites identified by BirdLife International as being important for Plains-wanderer conservation are Boolcoomatta, Bindarrah and Kalkaroo Stations in north-eastern South Australia, Diamantina and Astrebla Grasslands in western Queensland, Patho Plains in northern Victoria and the Riverina Plains in New South Wales.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.birdlife.org |title= Plains-wanderer |accessdate=2012-11-04 |work= Important Bird Areas |first= |last= |publisher= BirdLife International |year= 2012[/tpl]

===International===

This bird is listed as an endangered species on the 2007 IUCN Red List.

===Australia===

Plains Wanderers are listed as vulnerable on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC).  Their conservation status also varies from state to state within Australia. For example:
The Plains Wanderer is likely to change status to nationally endangered under the EPBC Act 1999.
