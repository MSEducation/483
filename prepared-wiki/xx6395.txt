CATEGORIES: Military of Lesotho

The security forces are composed of the Lesotho Defence Force (LDF) and the Lesotho Mounted Police Service. The LDF consists of an army, an air wing, and a newly formed paramilitary wing. The LDF is answerable to the Prime Minister through the Ministry of Defence, while the Lesotho Mounted Police report to the Prime  Minister through the ministry of Defense, Police and National Security Service. There also is a National Security Service, Intelligence, which is directly accountable to the Prime Minister. Relations between the police and the army have been tense, and in 1997 the army was called upon to put down a serious police mutiny.
