==Abduction and manhunt==

===Boulevard murders===

James DiMaggio had invited Christina Anderson and her children to his home at 2071 Ross Avenue in Boulevard, ostensibly to say goodbye because he was planning to move to Texas.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://fox5sandiego.com/2013/08/05/amber-alert-issued-for-2-missing-kids/#axzz2c0wL7JN7|title=Man suspected of double murder, kidnapping|work=FOX5|date=August 6, 2013 |accessdate=August 10, 2013[/tpl] The Anderson family, who lived about [tpl]convert|45|mi|km|0[/tpl] away in Lakeside, stayed over at his home.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/national/california-amber-alert-remains-idd-as-8-year-old-ethan-anderson-dimaggio-christina-still-missing |title=California Amber Alert: Kidnapping suspect James DiMaggio shot, killed in Idaho, teen alive|agency=Associated Press |accessdate=August 10, 2013[/tpl] The children's father, Brett Anderson, was on a three-month job in Tennessee at the time.[tpl]cite news|url=http://foxnewsinsider.com/2013/08/08/emotional-interview-brett-anderson-dad-kidnapped-kids-murdered-wife-speaks-fox-and |title=Emotional Interview: Brett Anderson, Dad of Kidnapped Kids, Murdered Wife Speaks ... |work=Fox News Insider |date=2013-08-08 |accessdate=2013-11-10[/tpl]
On August 4, a fire was reported at DiMaggio's house in Boulevard, where firemen found the bodies of Hannah Anderson's mother, Christina, her 8-year-old brother Ethan and the family dog, Cali.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2013/08/20/mom-of-california-kidnap-victim-died-of-blows-to-head|title=Kidnapper leaves $112,000 to Hannah Anderson's grandmother|first=Marty|last=Graham|agency=Reuters|work=Toronto Sun|date=August 20, 2013|accessdate=October 9, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author= |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/car-belonging-man-suspected-kidnapping-california-teen-found-idaho-article-1.1423155 |title=Hannah Anderson, abducted California teen, found alive after manhunt ends in alleged kidnapper's death |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl] Christina Anderson died of blunt force trauma, believed to have been caused by a crowbar.

In late September 2013, the San Diego County Medical Examiner's office released results of the autopsies of Christine and Ethan Anderson.  The autopsy of Christine Anderson found that a plastic cable tie had been used to bind her ankles, and that duct tape was wrapped around her neck and mouth. Her right arm and both legs were fractured, and there was a cut on her neck. She had been struck at least twelve times in the head. The autopsy of Ethan Anderson determined that the boy died because of the fire, though he also had skeletal fractures that could have been caused by events the day of the murders.[tpl]cite news|title=Autopsy: Hannah Anderson's mother, brother were beaten and burned|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/24/justice/hannah-anderson-family-autopsy/index.html|work=CNN|last1=Mungin|first1=Lateef|last2=Corder|first2=Calandra|date=September 25, 2013[/tpl]

===Sightings in Idaho===

On August 8, a couple meeting the description of DiMaggio and Anderson was seen by horseback riders in Cascade, Idaho. The next day, authorities were notified of this sighting after the riders watched a news report about the abduction.[tpl]cite news|first1=Mariano|last1=Castillo|first2=Michael|last2=Martinez|title=Authorities hunt for Amber Alert suspect, girl in Idaho wilderness|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/09/justice/california-amber-alert/index.html?iref=allsearch|work=CNN|accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/08/08/19888144-missing-siblings-kidnap-suspects-car-may-have-been-spotted-authorities-say?lite |title=Missing siblings: Kidnap suspect's car may have been spotted, authorities say |work=NBC News |date=August 8, 2013 |accessdate=August 11, 2013|last1=Lafferty|first1=Andrew|last2=Santini|first2=Olivia|last3=Austin|first3=Henry[/tpl]

===Shooting and rescue===

According to Hannah Anderson, DiMaggio, while they were fugitives, had threatened to kill her and anyone who tried to rescue her.[tpl]cite web|title=Hannah Anderson on Ask.fm: Rescued Teen Answers Questions Online|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/244276-hannah-anderson-on-ask-fm-rescued-teen-answering-questions-online/|work=The Epoch Times|date=August 13, 2013|last=Stieber|first=Zachary|accessdate=October 9, 2013[/tpl] On the same day that the sightings were reported, DiMaggio's car, a blue Nissan Versa, was discovered near the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness.

On August 10, police discovered DiMaggio's campsite and an FBI tactical agent killed DiMaggio near Morehead Lake around 5 pm. DiMaggio fired at least one shot at the officers, causing the officers to fire back and kill him.[tpl]cite news|title=Sheriff: Suspect in Idaho exchanged gunfire|url=http://news.yahoo.com/sheriff-suspect-idaho-exchanged-gunfire-180312133.html|work=Yahoo!

==Suspect==

The suspect was James Lee DiMaggio (January 17, 1973 – August 10, 2013), age 40, a telecommunications technician in San Diego. According to a friend of DiMaggio, his father, James Everet DiMaggio, died exactly 15 years to the day before his son. The friend said the elder DiMaggio, who was accused of attempting in 1988 to kidnap the 16-year-old daughter of an ex-girlfriend, committed suicide in August 1998. However, public records indicate his suicide was on August 10, 1995.[tpl]cite news|title=Reports: Father of Hannah Anderson's abductor has violent past|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/12/justice/california-suspect-father|work=CNN|date=August 12, 2013|accessdate=September 6, 2013|last1=Levs|first1=Josh|last2=Wian|first2=Casey[/tpl]
DiMaggio was said to be the best friend of Christina's husband, Brett Anderson, and like an uncle to the children."Hannah Anderson returns home to be with family and friends, says her Dad", Associated Press He had helped them with various tasks, such as driving Hannah and a friend from a gymnastics meet,[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://www.wetpaint.com/moms/articles/2013-08-08-amber-alert-hannah-anderson-kidnapping |title=Amber Alert: Friend Says Kidnapping Suspect Had a Crush on Hannah Anderson - Moms |work=Wetpaint.com |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl] during which he had unnerved her by saying he would like to date her, if they were the same age. During a trip to Los Angeles with Anderson, DiMaggio also complained she "wasn't paying enough attention to him." Anderson's friends said she did not like being alone with him and was "creeped out" by his comments on the drive from the meet.[tpl]cite web|last=Donaghue|first=Erin|title=James DiMaggio Manhunt: Suspected Calif. abductor may have abandoned car and rigged it with explosives, police say|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-57597762-504083/james-dimaggio-manhunt-suspected-calif-abductor-may-have-abandoned-car-and-rigged-it-with-explosives-police-say/|work=CBS News|accessdate=August 11, 2013[/tpl]
DiMaggio listed Brett Anderson's mother as beneficiary to his life insurance in 2011, while he lived with her. He intended the $112,000 for the children, but did not trust their parents to handle it. This revelation prompted members of DiMaggio's family to request a paternity test to determine if he fathered the Anderson children. Brett called the suggestion "disgusting" and an Anderson family spokeswoman said DiMaggio had not met Christina till she was six months pregnant with Hannah.[tpl]cite news|last=Spagat|first=Elliot|title=Hannah Anderson kidnapping: Family of suspect wants DNA test to see if he was her father|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/08/21/hannah_anderson_kidnapping_family_of_suspect_wants_dna_test_to_see_if_he_was_her_father.html|accessdate=August 26, 2013|agency=Associated Press|date=August 21, 2013[/tpl] The DiMaggio family later withdrew their request for DNA testing.[tpl]cite news|title=Kidnapper James DiMaggio's sister drops bid for Hannah Anderson DNA tests|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/08/28/20225956-kidnapper-james-dimaggios-sister-drops-bid-for-hannah-anderson-dna-tests?lite|work=NBC News|date=August 28, 2013|last=Spagat|first=Elliot|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=October 9, 2013[/tpl]
According to released warrants, DiMaggio received letters from Hannah Anderson which were found in his home by investigators, and exchanged over a dozen calls with her before the murders occurred.[tpl]cite news|title=Hannah Anderson sent James Lee DiMaggio letters, warrants reveal|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57598826/hannah-anderson-sent-james-lee-dimaggio-letters-warrants-reveal/|work=CBS News|agency=Associated Press|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=September 6, 2013[/tpl] However, San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said Anderson was "a victim in every sense of the word" and did not willingly go with DiMaggio.
