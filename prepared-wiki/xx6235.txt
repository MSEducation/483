</ref> Metal ion lasers are gas lasers that generate [[deep ultraviolet]] wavelengths. [[Helium]]-silver (HeAg) 224&nbsp;nm and [[neon]]-copper (NeCu) 248&nbsp;nm are two examples. Like all low-pressure gas lasers, the gain media of these lasers have quite narrow oscillation [[linewidth]]s, less than 3 [[GHz]] (0.5 [[picometers]]),<ref>
