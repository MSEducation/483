Trafford is a metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester, England. With an estimated population of about 211,800 in 2006,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=9666&More=Y |title=Population estimates 2006 by district |publisher=Statistics.gov.uk |date=21 August 2007[/tpl] Retrieved on 17 December 2007. it covers [tpl]convert|41|sqmi|km2|0[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=Trafford Metropolitan Borough population density |publisher=Statistics.gov.uk |url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=276784&c=Trafford&d=13&e=16&g=356269&i=1001x1003x1004&o=1&m=0&r=1&s=1197508310484&enc=1&dsFamilyId=789[/tpl] Retrieved on 13 December 2007. and includes the towns of Altrincham, Partington, Sale, Stretford, and Urmston. The borough was formed on 1 April 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972 as a merger of the municipal boroughs of Altrincham, Sale, and Stretford, the urban districts of Bowdon, Hale, and Urmston and part of Bucklow Rural District. All were previously in Cheshire, apart from Stretford and Urmston which were in Lancashire. The River Mersey flows through the borough, separating North Trafford from South Trafford. Historically the Mersey also acted as the boundary between the historic counties of Lancashire and Cheshire.
The Trafford area has a long heritage, with evidence of Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Roman activity. Amongst the relics of the past are two castles – one of them a Scheduled Ancient Monument – and over 200 listed buildings. The area underwent change in the late 19th century and the population rapidly expanded with the arrival of the railway. Trafford is the home of Manchester United F.C. and Lancashire County Cricket Club and since 2002 the Imperial War Museum North.
Trafford has a strong economy with low levels of unemployment and contains both Trafford Park industrial estate and the Trafford Centre, a large out-of-town shopping centre. Apart from the City of Manchester, Trafford is the only borough in Greater Manchester to be above the national average for weekly income. Socially, the area includes both working class areas like Old Trafford and Stretford and middle class ones such as Bowdon and Hale. Altrincham and Sale West is one of the two parliamentary constituencies in Greater Manchester to be held by the Conservative Party, the other being Bury North.

==History==

The choice of the name Trafford for the borough was a "compromise between Altrincham, Stretford and Sale", and "seemed to have wide support". A Liberal councillor for the Municipal Borough of Sale suggested "Crossford ... whilst "Watlingford" was suggested by councillors in Hale, after the supposed name of an ancient Roman road in the district. Those names were rejected in favour of Trafford, because of the district's "famous sports venue, a major employer as well as historic associations", referring to Old Trafford (cricket and football), Trafford Park and the de Trafford baronets respectively.[tpl]Harvnb|Clark|1973|p=101[/tpl].
As a place name, Trafford is an Anglo-French version of Stratford, deriving from the Old English words stræt (a street, more specifically a Roman road) and ford (a river crossing). The Metropolitan Borough of Trafford has existed since 1974, but the area it covers has a long history. Neolithic arrowheads have been discovered in Altrincham and Sale,Nevell (1997), pp. 12–13. and there is evidence of Bronze Age habitation in Timperley.Faulkner (2004), pp. 1–5. Fragments of Roman pottery have been found in Urmston, and Roman coins have been found in Sale. The Roman road between the legionary fortresses at Chester (Deva Victrix) and York (Eboracum) crosses Trafford, passing through Stretford, Sale, and Altrincham.Nevell (1997), pp. 17, 20, 75. The settlements in Trafford have been based largely around agriculture, although Altrincham was founded as a market town in the mid 1200s.Nevell (1997), p. 51. Although the Industrial Revolution affected Trafford, the area did not experience the same rate of growth as the rest of Greater Manchester.Nevell (1997), pp. 90–91. A 100% increase in population in the Trafford area between 1841 and 1861 was a direct result of an influx due to the construction of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway, which allowed residents to more easily commute from Trafford into Manchester. The area developed its own centres of industry in Broadheath (founded in 1885) and Trafford Park (founded in 1897).Nevell (1997), pp. 127, 131. They have since declined, although Trafford Park still employs 40–50,000 people.[tpl]cite web |title=Salford Quays & Trafford Park |publisher=Manchester Investment and Development Agency Service Ltd |url=http://www.investinmanchester.com/propertysites_salfordquays |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080117100823/http://www.investinmanchester.com/propertysites_salfordquays |archivedate = 2008-01-17[/tpl] Retrieved on 4 May 2009.[tpl]cite web |title=Trafford at GMeP.org |publisher=Greater Manchester e-Government Partnership |url=http://www.gmep.org.uk/ccm/content/map-links/trafford/|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071223210424/http://www.gmep.org.uk/ccm/content/map-links/trafford/ |archivedate = December 23, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Retrieved on 12 December 2007.

==Geography==

The metropolitan boroughs of the City of Salford and the City of Manchester border Trafford to the north and east respectively; the Cheshire East area of Cheshire lies to the south. The geology of South Trafford is Keuper marl with some Keuper waterstone and sandstone, whilst the geology of North Trafford is Bunter sandstone.Nevell (1997), pp. 3, 10, 94. The River Mersey runs east to west through the area, separating North Trafford from South Trafford; other rivers in Trafford include the Bollin, the River Irwell, Sinderland Brook, and Crofts Bank Brook. The Bridgewater Canal, opened in 1761 and completed in 1776, follows a course through Trafford roughly north to south and passes through Stretford, Sale, and Altrincham. The Manchester Ship Canal, opened in 1894, forms part of Trafford's northern and western boundaries with Salford.Nevell (1997), p. 125.
Trafford is generally flat, with most of the land lying between [tpl]convert|66|ft|m[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|98|ft[/tpl] above sea level, apart from Bowdon Hill in South Trafford which rises [tpl]convert|200|ft|m|-1[/tpl] above sea level.

===Population change===

The table below details the population change since 1801, including the percentage change since the last census 10 years earlier. Although Trafford was formed as a Metropolitan Borough in 1974, figures have been generated by combining data from the towns, villages, and civil parishes that would later be constituent parts of Trafford. The greatest percentage change in the population occurred between 1851 and 1871, and was a result of the construction of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway in 1849. The decrease by 7.7% in Trafford's population since the 1971 census mirrors the trend for Greater Manchester, although on a smaller scale; this has been accounted for by the decline of Greater Manchester's industries, particularly those in Manchester and Salford but including those in Trafford, and residents leaving to seek new jobs.[tpl]cite web |title=Trafford Metropolitan Borough key statistics  |publisher=audit-commission.gov.uk |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527132527/http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/Products/BVIR/9AC95DA0-C6A1-4b9b-9A0D-D305DE72FFC8/ManchesterSalford.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] Retrieved on 2 March 2014.

==Economy==

Historically, the economy of the Trafford area has been dominated by agriculture. This continued to some extent even during the Industrial Revolution, as the textile industry in Trafford did not develop as quickly or to the same extent as it did in the rest of Greater Manchester.Nevell (1997), pp. 88–91 There are only two known 18th-century mill sites in Trafford, compared with 69 known in Tameside and 51 in Manchester. After reaching a high of 43% in 1812, employment in the textile industry in Trafford declined to 12% according to the 1851 census. The textile industry in Trafford could not compete with that in places such as Manchester, Oldham, and Ashton-under-Lyne, partly because of a reluctance to invest in industry on the part of the two main land owners in the area: the Stamfords and the de Traffords.
Trafford Park was founded in 1897, and at its peak in 1945 employed 75,000 people.Nevell (1997), pp. 130–131 As well as being the world's first planned industrial estate,Nicholls (1996), p. xiii. it is Europe's largest business park. More than 1,400 companies are within the park, employing between 40,000 and 50,000 people.
