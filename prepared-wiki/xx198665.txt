[[Albania–Greece relations]]

CATEGORIES: Albania–Greece relations

Albanian–Greek relations refer to bilateral foreign relations between Albania and Greece. Due to the strong presence of Albanian communities in Greece and the Greek communities in Albania, the two countries today enjoy very warm diplomatic relations. Both countries are members of many international organizations, including the Council of Europe and NATO, and share common political views about the Balkans and the world, with Greece being a strong supporter of the EU Candidate of Albania, by proposing the "Agenda 2014" for boosting the integration of all the Western Balkan states into the European Union. Greece is also Albania's top investor and main trading partner, and along with Italy, Greece strongly supported Albania's NATO entry. The governments of the two countries cooperate in many fields, from market and energy, to military, tourism and culture, with large projects such as the Trans Adriatic Pipeline and the Hydroelectric power plants. The Greek government also is one of Albania's largest donors and the main foreign donor of the National Theater of Albania.
Albania maintains an embassy in Athens and consulates in Ioannina and Thessaloniki. Greece maintains an embassy in Tirana and consulates in Gjirokastër and Korçë. 

==History==

After Albanian declaration of independence in 1912 land division between Albania and Greece was finally solved under the force of the Great Powers (Austria–Hungary and Italy) with the Florence Protocol. Relations did not improve until 1939 with the occupation of Albania by Italy. Greek and Albanian forces came into conflict during the Greco-Italian War even though during the Axis Occupation of Greece the Greek and Albanian resistance groups were in close contact and even exchanged information about the Nazi occupation forces.http://www.ahistoryofgreece.com/worldwarII.htm
Following a freeze lasting more than 30 years, the two countries re-established diplomatic relations in 1971, at an instance where economic cooperation and strategic calculations made Enver Hoxha and the right-wing Greek military junta of 1967–1974 explore paths of cooperation.[tpl]cite book|author=Nafpliotis, Alexandros, "The 1971 Re-establishment of Diplomatic Relations between Greece and Albania: Cooperation and Strategic Partnership within Cold War Bipolarity?" in Anastasakis, Bechev and Vrousalis (eds.)|title=Greece in the Balkans: Memory, Conflict and Exchange|url=http://books.google.gr/books?id=yH8fQAAACAAJ&dq=Greece+in+the+Balkans:+Memory,+Conflict+and+Exchange&hl=en&sa=X&ei=p7uQUcqhMory4QSiqIHgCw&redir_esc=y|year=2009|publisher=Newcastle: Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn= 9781443813150[/tpl]

==Current relations==

After the fall of communism in Albania in 1992, a large number of economic refugees and immigrants from Albania (and other formerly Communist countries including Bulgaria, Republic of Macedonia, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, Armenia and Georgia) arrived in Greece, mostly as illegal immigrants, to seek employment. Albanians in Greece comprise 60-65% of the total number of immigrants in Greece. According to the 2001 census, there are officially 443,550 holders of Albanian citizenship in Greece.Greencard1998_ ResPerm2004v4correctedFINAL.xlsAlbanians in Greece
Today, relations have significantly improved; Greece and Albania signed a Friendship, Cooperation, Good Neighborliness and Security Agreement on 21 March 1996. Additionally, Greece is Albania's main foreign investor, having invested more than 400 million dollars in Albania, Albania's second largest trading partner, with Greek products accounting for some 21% of Albanian imports, and 12% of Albanian exports coming to Greece, and Albania's fourth largest donor country, having provided aid amounting to 73.8 million euros.Greek Ministry for Foreign Affairs: Bilateral relations between Greece and Albania.
