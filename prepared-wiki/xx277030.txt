The Blessed Otto Neururer (1882-1940) was an Austrian Roman Catholic priest and martyr. He was the first priest to die in a Nazi Concentration Camp and was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1996.

He advised a girl not to marry a divorced man of questionable morality. The man was a personal friend of the Nazi Gauleiter (party leader) of Tirol. Neururer was arrested on the charge of "slander to the detriment of German marriage" and sent to Dachau Concentration Camp and later to Buchenwald, where he faced torture.
