[tpl]Nihongo|FLCL|フリクリ|Furi Kuri| pronounced in English as Fooly Cooly[/tpl] is an original video animation series written by Yōji Enokido, directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki and produced by the FLCL Production Committee, which included Gainax, Production I.G, and Starchild Records. FLCL follows Naota Nandaba, a twelve-year-old boy living in the fictional Japanese suburb of Mabase, and his interactions with Haruko Haruhara, who arrives in the quiet suburb, drawn by the industrial town houses and the Medical Mechanica building.
The English adaptation of the series was first licensed by Synch-Point which released the DVDs and soundtrack, but these went out of print in 2006. In January 2010, Funimation Entertainment announced that they would be re-releasing the series on DVD and releasing it for the first time on Blu-ray. 
The series aired in Canada on G4techTV Canada's Anime Current block, and in America on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim several times. It aired on the channel's Toonami block from October 26, 2013 to January 25, 2014. The series is also available via Hulu, iTunes, and on Funimation's website.

==Plot==

FLCL revolves around Naota Nandaba, a 12-year-old, working class boy living with his widower father and grandfather. His life in the city of Mabase is interrupted by the arrival of Haruko Haruhara, who runs over Naota with her yellow Vespa 180 SS scooter, gives him CPR, then hits him on the head with a blue vintage Rickenbacker 4001 left-handed electric bass guitar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://synch-point.com/production/flcl/index.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080626113505/http://synch-point.com/production/flcl/index.html|archivedate=June 26, 2008|title=Synch-Point: Production – FLCL index|publisher=Synch-Point|accessdate=October 24, 2008[/tpl]FLCL Ultimate edition liner notes[tpl]cite AV media | title=FLCL DVD 1 (Inside jacket) | publisher=Synch point | year=2002 | medium=DVD[/tpl] Naota discovers that the blow to his head created an "N.O." portal, from which giant robots produced by a company known as Medical Mechanica emerge periodically.
Naota later finds Haruko working in his house as a live-in maid. It is later discovered that Haruko is an investigator for the Galactic Space Police Brotherhood. Haruko uses Naota for her search for the Pirate King, Atomsk. She is at odds with Medical Mechanica, a monolithic industrial corporation. Naota is being watched by Commander Amarao, a special agent of the Bureau of Interstellar Immigration, who believes that Medical Mechanica is out to conquer the galaxy. Naota is ultimately drawn into a three-way battle between Haruko, Amarao and Medical Mechanica.

==Production==

FLCL[tpl]'[/tpl]s localization director and script writer Marc Handler stated that localization of the script was the hardest part of the show. The in-jokes in the show included obscure pop culture references that had to be decoded and transferred to English audiences. One example was a reference to Cheerio, a discontinued soft drink in Japan, for the English release the choice was made to use a discontinued American soft drink, Crystal Pepsi.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.anime-tourist.com/article.php?sid=34 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040305000511/http://www.anime-tourist.com/article.php?sid=34 | archivedate=2004-03-05 | title=Anime Tourist Interview: Behind the Scenes of FLCL. | publisher=Anime Tourist | accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl] Director Kazuya Tsuramaki responded to criticism of FLCL, stating "comprehension should not be an important factor in FLCL."[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.production-ig.com/furiKuri.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021220121354/http://www.production-ig.com/furiKuri.html | archivedate=2002-12-20 | title=FURI KURI | publisher=Production I.G. | accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl]
The Medical Mechanica building featured is in the shape of a large iron. The character, Amarao, describes Medical Mechanica's goal as the destruction of all thought. FLCL uses the iron as a symbolic breakdown of "thought" by smoothing out the wrinkles as equated to the removing of the brains wrinkles. For English localization, the Japanese team had to explain the concept because a direct translation of script did not convey the ideology.[tpl]cite web | url=http://anime-tourist.com/article.php?sid=33 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040116113414/http://anime-tourist.com/article.php?sid=33 | archivedate=2004-01-16 | title=Interviews: Anime Tourist Interview: Behind the Scenes of FLCL | publisher=Anime Tourist | accessdate=24 July 2013[/tpl]

==Episodes==

FLCL is directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki and produced by the FLCL Production Committee, which included Gainax, Production I.G,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.productionig.com/contents/works/04_/000088.html|title=FLCL|work=Work List|publisher=Production I.G.|accessdate=December 19, 2013[/tpl] and Starchild Records.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.starchild.co.jp/e/special/library/032.html|title=FLCL|publisher=Starchild|accessdate=December 19, 2013[/tpl]
Tsurumaki has said that he tried to "break the rules" of anime when making FLCL, for example, by choosing a contemporary Japanese band to provide the soundtrack, and patterning the style more after "a Japanese TV commercial or promotional video", creating a work that is "short, but dense-packed".PULP : : The Manga Magazine : : 6.03 FLCL

==Other media==

===Novels===

A three-volume novel series was written by screenwriter Yoji Enokido and published by Kadokawa Shoten. The novels were released in Japan on June 2000, October 2000, and March 2001 respectively. The English-language versions were published by Tokyopop and were released in North America on March 11, 2008; September 9, 2008; and March 10, 2009 respectively.

===Manga===

A two-volume manga was created by artist Hajime Ueda. The manga interprets the series with all of the key elements intact, and tells the events of the anime with a crude artwork and unsteady pacing. Jack Kotin defended the unique artstyle of the manga, saying "It can be crudely drawn at times, but this style fits in well with the overall story and atmosphere...".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.teenreads.com/reviews/flcl-volume-1 | title=FLCL, Volume 1 - Teenreads | publisher=Teenreads | accessdate=4 August 2013[/tpl]

===Soundtracks===

Six pieces of theme music are used for the episodes; five opening themes and one closing theme, all by the Japanese rock band, The Pillows.

The closing theme of each episode is "Ride on Shooting Star". Geneon Entertainment has released three original soundtracks encompassing the songs, with the soundtracks titled Addict (released on January 20, 2004), King of Pirates (released on September 7, 2004), and FLCL No. 3 (released on June 7, 2005).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000UX5OI/ |title=Amazon.com: Fooly Cooly OST 1: Addict|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=January 10, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002CHJ14/ |title=Amazon.com: Fooly Cooly OST 2: King of Pirates|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=January 10, 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007OY30C/ |title=Amazon.com: FLCL (Fooly Cooly) OST 3|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=January 10, 2008[/tpl] The remaining music was written by Shinkichi Mitsumune. Three soundtrack CDs were released in Japan and later distributed to America.

====FLCL No.1: Addict====

[tpl]Nihongo|FLCL No.1: Addict| フリクリNo.1 アディクト |[/tpl] is the first soundtrack from the anime series FLCL. The album contains tracks that were featured in the first three episodes of FLCL.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www2.gainax.co.jp/shop/index.cgi?rm=detail&id=730 |title= フリクリサントラ全巻セット（No.１~３） |publisher=Gainax |language=Japanese |accessdate=December 24, 2011[/tpl] Most of the music is by Japanese rock group The Pillows. The rest is by Shinkichi Mitsumune, a composer.

====FLCL No.2: King of Pirates====

[tpl]Nihongo|FLCL No.2: King of Pirates|フリクリNo.2 海賊王|[/tpl] is the second soundtrack from the anime series FLCL. The album contains tracks featured in the last three episodes of FLCL. Most of the music is by Japanese rock group The Pillows, the rest by Shinkichi Mitsumune. This volume features several audio dramas, with the cast of FLCL playing the various parts. Due to the dramas included, this album acts as a sequel of sorts to the anime.

====FLCL No.3====

[tpl]Nihongo|FLCL No.3|フリクリNo.3|[/tpl] is the third soundtrack from the anime series FLCL. The album is a compilation of the first two soundtracks, Addict and King of Pirates, featuring only music by the Japanese rock group The Pillows.  Unlike the previous two soundtracks, the songs are the original vocal versions from the band's LPs.

==Reception==

FLCL has received positive reviews. Christopher McDonald of Anime News Network called it "downright hilarious" and "visually superb" with great music, citing the packaging of 2 episodes per DVD as the only weakness of Synch-Point's original release.[tpl]cite web|last=McDonald|first=Christopher|title=FLCL DVD 1 review|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/flcl/dvd-1|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=August 10, 2007[/tpl] Robert Nelson of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews gave the anime 4 out of 5 stars stating, "FLCL may not have a straightforward or deep plot. It may not have complex characterizations. Hell, it may not have any meaning. But FLCL does succeed in its true objective. It is fun to watch!"[tpl]cite web|last=Nelson|first=Robert|title=FLCL|url= http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=43 |publisher=T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews|accessdate=December 27, 2012[/tpl] Chris Beveridge of Mania gave it an A- stating, " FLCL is something that allowed those involved to try a wide variety of styles and techniques and does come off as quite experimental. But nearly everything worked in their favor and you end up with three hours of nearly break neck speed action, comedy and commentary on modern life."[tpl]cite web|last=Beveridge|first=Chris|title=FLCL Complete series|url=http://www.mania.com/flcl-complete-series_article_126452.html |publisher=Mania|date=March 3, 2011|accessdate=December 27, 2012[/tpl] Brian Ruh praised the series stating, "It was very frenetic and kept pushing the envelope on what was possible in Japanese animation."[tpl]cite web|last=Ruh|first=Brian|title=Brain Diving The Filth and the Furi |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/brain-diving/2011-02-22|publisher=Anime News Network|date=February 22, 2011|accessdate=December 27, 2012[/tpl]
