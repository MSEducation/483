Arginine ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|g|ɪ|n|iː|n[/tpl], abbreviated as Arg or R)[tpl]cite web | author=IUPAC-IUBMB Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature | title=Nomenclature and Symbolism for Amino Acids and Peptides | work=Recommendations on Organic & Biochemical Nomenclature, Symbols & Terminology etc | url=http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/AminoAcid/ | accessdate=2007-05-17| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070529233449/http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/AminoAcid/| archivedate= 29 May 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] is an α-amino acid. It was first isolated in 1886. The L-form is one of the 20 most common natural amino acids. At the level of molecular genetics, in the structure of the messenger ribonucleic acid mRNA, CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG, are the triplets of nucleotide bases or codons that code for arginine during protein synthesis. In mammals, arginine is classified as a semiessential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual.[tpl]cite journal | last = Tapiero | first = H. |author2=et al. | title = L-Arginine | journal = Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy | volume = 56 | issue = 9 |date=November 2002 | pages = 439–445 REVIEW | pmid = 12481980 | accessdate = 2009-11-29 [/tpl] Preterm infants are unable to synthesize or create arginine internally, making the amino acid nutritionally essential for them.[tpl]cite journal | last = Wu | first = G. |author2=et al. | title = Arginine deficiency in preterm infants: biochemical mechanisms and nutritional implications | journal = Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry | volume = 15 | issue = 8 |date=August 2004 | pages = 332–451 REVIEW | pmid = 15302078 | accessdate = 2009-11-29 | doi = 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2003.11.010 [/tpl] There are some conditions that put an increased demand on the body for the synthesis of L-arginine, including surgical or other trauma, sepsis and burns.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] Arginine was first isolated from a lupin seedling extract in 1886 by the Swiss chemist Ernst Schultze.
In general, most people do not need to take arginine supplements because the body usually produces significant amounts in healthy individuals.Mayo Clinic

==Structure==

The amino acid side-chain of arginine consists of a 3-carbon aliphatic straight chain, the distal end of which is capped by a complex guanidinium group.
With a pKa of 12.48, the guanidinium group is positively charged in neutral, acidic, and even most basic environments, and thus imparts basic chemical properties to arginine.
Because of the conjugation between the double bond and the nitrogen lone pairs, the positive charge is delocalized, enabling the formation of multiple H-bonds.

==Sources==

===Dietary sources===

Arginine is a conditionally nonessential amino acid, meaning that most of the time it can be manufactured by the human body, and does not need to be obtained directly through the diet. The biosynthetic pathway, however, does not produce sufficient arginine, and some must still be consumed through diet. Individuals with poor nutrition or certain physical conditions may be advised to increase their intake of foods containing arginine. Arginine is found in a wide variety of foods, including:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.keysupplements.com/articles/L-Arginine-Supplements-Nitric-Oxide-Scientific-Studies.htm |title=L-Arginine Supplements Nitric Oxide Scientific Studies Food Sources |accessdate=2007-02-20[/tpl]

===Biosynthesis===

Arginine is synthesized from citrulline by the sequential action of the cytosolic enzymes argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL). In terms of energy, this is costly, as the synthesis of each molecule of argininosuccinate requires hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), i.e., two ATP equivalents. In essence, taking an excess of arginine gives more energy by saving ATPs that can be used elsewhere.
Citrulline can be derived from multiple sources:
The pathways linking arginine, glutamine, and proline are bidirectional. Thus, the net utilization or production of these amino acids is highly dependent on cell type and developmental stage.
On a whole-body basis, synthesis of arginine occurs principally via the intestinal–renal axis, wherein epithelial cells of the small intestine, which produce citrulline primarily from glutamine and glutamate, collaborate with the proximal tubule cells of the kidney, which extract citrulline from the circulation and convert it to arginine, which is returned to the circulation. As a consequence, impairment of small bowel or renal function can reduce endogenous arginine synthesis, thereby increasing the dietary requirement.
Synthesis of arginine from citrulline also occurs at a low level in many other cells, and cellular capacity for arginine synthesis can be markedly increased under circumstances that also induce iNOS. Thus, citrulline, a coproduct of the NOS-catalyzed reaction, can be recycled to arginine in a pathway known as the citrulline-NO or arginine-citrulline pathway. This is demonstrated by the fact that, in many cell types, citrulline can substitute for arginine to some degree in supporting NO synthesis. However, recycling is not quantitative because citrulline accumulates along with nitrate and nitrite, the stable end-products of NO, in NO-producing cells.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Morris Jr | first1 = SM | title = Enzymes of arginine metabolism. | url = http://www.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/134/10/2743S | pmid = 15465778  | author-separator =, | journal = The Journal of nutrition | author-name-separator= | volume=134 | issue=10 Suppl |date=October 2004 | pages=2743S–2747S [/tpl]

==Function==

Arginine plays an important role in cell division, the healing of wounds, removing ammonia from the body, immune function, and the release of hormones.[tpl]cite journal | last = Stechmiller | first = J.K. |author2=et al. | title = Arginine supplementation and wound healing | journal = Nutrition in Clinical Practice | volume = 20 | issue = 13 |date=February 2005 | pages = 52–61 REVIEW | pmid = 16207646 | accessdate = 2009-11-29 | doi = 10.1177/011542650502000152 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | last = Witte | first = M.B. |author2=Barbul, A | title = Arginine physiology and its implication for wound healing | journal = Wound Repair and Regeneration | volume = 11 | issue = 6 |date=Nov–Dec 2003 | pages = 419–423 REVIEW | pmid = 14617280 | accessdate = 2009-11-29 | doi = 10.1046/j.1524-475X.2003.11605.x [/tpl]
The benefits and functions attributed to oral supplementation of L-arginine include:

===Proteins===

The distributing basics of the moderate structure found in geometry, charge distribution, and ability to form multiple H-bonds make arginine ideal for binding negatively charged groups. For this reason, arginine prefers to be on the outside of the proteins, where it can interact with the polar environment.
Incorporated in proteins, arginine can also be converted to citrulline by PAD enzymes. In addition, arginine can be methylated by protein methyltransferases.

===Precursor===

Arginine is the immediate precursor of nitric oxide (NO), urea, ornithine, and agmatine; is necessary for the synthesis of creatine; and can also be used for the synthesis of polyamines (mainly through ornithine and to a lesser degree through agmatine), citrulline, and glutamate. As a precursor of nitric oxide, arginine may have a role in the treatment of some conditions where vasodilation is required. The presence of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a close relative, inhibits the nitric oxide reaction; therefore, ADMA is considered a marker for vascular disease, just as L-arginine is considered a sign of a healthy endothelium.

===Treatment of dentin hypersensitivity===

Arginine (8%) in dental products (e.g., toothpaste) provides effective relief from sensitive teeth by depositing a dentin-like mineral, containing calcium and phosphate, within the dentin tubules and in a protective layer on the dentin surface.[tpl]cite journal | last = Petrou | first = I. |author2=et al. | title = A breakthrough therapy for dentin hypersensitivity: how dental products containing 8% arginine and calcium carbonate work to deliver effective relief of sensitive teeth. | journal = The Journal of Clinical Dentisry | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | year = 2009 | pages = 23–31 | pmid = 19489189 | accessdate = 2011-05-02 | doi=[/tpl]

===Treatment of herpes simplex virus===

An unproven claim is that a low ratio of arginine to lysine may be of benefit in the treatment of herpes simplex virus.

Hajime Koyama [/tpl]

===Possible increased risk of death after supplementation following heart attack===

A clinical trial found that patients taking an L-arginine supplement following a heart attack found no change in the heart's vascular tone or decrease in the symptoms of congestive heart failure (the heart's ability to pump). In fact, six more patients that were taking L-arginine died than those taking a placebo, resulting in early termination of the study with the recommendation that the supplement not be used by heart attack patients.Medical College of Georgia. "Diabetes Makes It Hard For Blood Vessels To Relax." ScienceDaily 1 February 2008. 1 February 2008[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Schulman | first1 = SP | last2 = Becker | first2 = LC | last3 = Kass | first3 = DA | last4 = Champion | first4 = HC | last5 = Terrin | first5 = ML | last6 = Forman | first6 = S | last7 = Ernst | first7 = KV | last8 = Kelemen | first8 = MD | last9 = Townsend | first9 = SN | title = L-arginine therapy in acute myocardial infarction: the Vascular Interaction With Age in Myocardial Infarction (VINTAGE MI) randomized clinical trial. | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/295/1/58 | pmid = 16391217  | author-separator =, | journal = JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association | author-name-separator= | doi=10.1001/jama.295.1.58 | volume=295 | issue=1 |date=January 2006 | pages=58–64[/tpl] These findings suggest L-arginine is not beneficial post-heart-attack.

==Potential medical uses==

===Lung inflammation and asthma===

Inhalation of L-arginine can increase lung inflammation and worsen asthma.Sapienza MA, Kharitonov SA, Horvath I, Chung KF, Barnes PJ. "Effect of inhaled L-arginine on exhaled nitric oxide in normal and asthmatic subjects." Thorax. 1998 Mar;53(3):172-5.

===Growth hormone===

Intravenously-administered arginine stimulates the secretion of growth hormone,[tpl]cite journal |author=Alba-Roth J, Müller O, Schopohl J, von Werder K |title=Arginine stimulates growth hormone secretion by suppressing endogenous somatostatin secretion |journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab |volume=67 |issue=6 |pages=1186–9 |year=1988 |pmid=2903866 |doi=10.1210/jcem-67-6-1186[/tpl] and is used in growth hormone stimulation tests.U.S. National Library of Medicine (September 2009). Growth hormone stimulation test  
Two studies have found that oral L-arginine supplementation is also effective at increasing resting GH levels.  The first study found that oral preparations of L-arginine are effective at increasing growth hormone levels.  In fact, the 9-gram dose resulted in mean peak GH levels of 6.4 (+/- 1.3) microg/L versus placebo levels of 2.9 (+/- 0.7).[tpl]cite pmid|15809017[/tpl]  Another study found similar results.  It included resting versus exercise and oral L-arginine versus oral placebo.  The authors concluded that "Oral arginine alone (7 g) stimulated GH release, but a greater GH response was seen with exercise alone.  The combined effect of arginine before exercise attenuates the GH response... GH production: Ex > Arg+Ex > Arg > placebo" suggesting against supplementing with arginine alone prior to exercise if the goal is to raise GH levels, but concurring with the previous study that oral L-arginine increases GH on days free of significant exercise.[tpl]cite pmid|16741262[/tpl]  In contrast to these two studies that found increased resting GH due to oral arginine supplementation, a third study did not find increase in resting GH levels from oral supplementation.  In that study, oral preparations of L-arginine were ineffective at increasing growth hormone levels despite being effective at increasing plasma levels of L-arginine.[tpl]cite journal|last=Forbes|first=SC|author2=Bell, GJ|title=The acute effects of a low and high dose of oral L-arginine supplementation in young active males at rest.|journal=Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism = Physiologie appliquee, nutrition et metabolisme|date=June 2011|year=2011|volume=36|issue=3|pages=405–11|doi=10.1139/h11-035|pmid=21574873|accessdate=16 April 2013[/tpl]

===Sepsis===

Cellular arginine biosynthetic capacity determined by activity of argininosuccinate synthetase (AS) is induced by the same mediators of septic response — endotoxin and cytokines — that induce nitric oxide synthase (NOS), the enzyme responsible for nitric oxide synthesis.[tpl]cite journal |year=1995 |title= ROLE OF ARGININE SYNTHESIS IN SURGICAL SEPSIS |publisher=Crisp Data Base National Institutes Of Health |volume= |issue= |pages= |pmid= |doi= |url= http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/ |accessdate=2010-02-22 |quote= |author=MORRIS SM | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100226170753/http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/| archivedate= 26 February 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===Anxiety===

Dietary supplementation of L-arginine taken in combination with L-lysine has been shown potentially useful in treating people subjected to high levels of mental stress and anxiety, in a double-blind, placebo controlled and randomized study, involving 108 Japanese adults. Trait anxiety and state anxiety induced by cognitive stress battery was significantly reduced, and basal levels of the stress hormone cortisol were decreased. The study was funded by Ajinomoto, Co. Inc., an industrial manufacturer of lysine and arginine.[tpl]cite journal | author=Smriga M, Ando T, Akutsu M, Furukawa Y, Miwa K, Morinaga Y.| title=Oral treatment with L-lysine and L-arginine reduces anxiety and basal cortisol levels in healthy humans | journal=Institute of Life Sciences | year=2007 | pages=85–90 | issue=2 | volume=28 | pmid= 17510493 [/tpl]
