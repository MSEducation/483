</ref> Unhappily, Parker failed to commission anyone to act as supervisory editor for the work completed by the various translatorsâ€”and was too busy to do so himself, and accordingly translation practice varies greatly from book to book. Hence, in most of the Hebrew Bible (as is standard in English Versions) the [[Yahweh|tetragrammaton]] YHWH is represented by "the Lord", and the Hebrew "Elohim" is represented by "God". But in the Psalms the practice is the opposite way around. The books that Parker himself worked on are fairly sparingly edited from the text of the Great Bible, while those undertaken by [[Grindal]] of London emerged much closer to the Geneva text.
The bishops deputed to revise the Apocrypha appear to have delivered very little, as the text in these books reproduce that of the Great Bible broadly the same. As the Apocrypha of the Great Bible was translated from the Latin Vulgate, the Bishops' Bible cannot strictly claim to have been entirely translated from the original tongues.
The Bishops' Bible was first published in 1568,[ref]
