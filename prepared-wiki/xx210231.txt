==Etymology==

Over the past 3,000 years, the city of Beijing has had numerous other names. The name Beijing, which means "Northern Capital" (from the Chinese characters [tpl]lang|zh|北[/tpl] for north and [tpl]lang|zh|京[/tpl] for capital), was applied to the city in 1403 during the Ming Dynasty to distinguish the city from Nanjing (the "Southern Capital").Hucker, Charles O. "Governmental Organization of The Ming Dynasty", p. 5{–}6. Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, Vol. 21 (Dec. 1958). Harvard-Yenching Institute. Retrieved 20 October 2012. The English spelling is based on the pinyin romanization of the two characters as they are pronounced in Standard Mandarin.  An older English spelling, Peking, is the Postal Map Romanization of the same two characters as they are pronounced in Chinese dialects spoken in the southern port towns first visited by European traders and missionaries.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lane Harris |title=A 'Lasting Boon to All': A Note on the Postal Romanization of Place Names, 1896-1949 |journal=Twentieth Century China |volume=34 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=96–109 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/tcc/summary/v034/34.1.harris.html |doi=10.1353/tcc.0.0007 [/tpl]  Those dialects preserve the Middle Chinese pronunciation of [tpl]lang|zh|京[/tpl] as kjaeng,Baxter, Wm.

==History==

===Early history===

The earliest traces of human habitation in the Beijing municipality were found in the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near the village of Zhoukoudian in Fangshan District, where Peking Man lived. Homo erectus fossils from the caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago. Paleolithic homo sapiens also lived there more recently, about 27,000 years ago.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/ext/field/beijing/whc/pkm-site.htm|title=The Peking Man World Heritage Site at Zhoukoudian[/tpl] Archaeologists have found neolithic settlements throughout the municipality, including in Wangfujing, located in downtown Beijing.
The first walled city in Beijing was Ji, a city-state from the 11th to 7th century BC. Within modern Beijing, Ji was located south of the present Beijing West Railway Station.[tpl]cite web |title=Beijing's History |url=http://china.org.cn/english/features/beijing/30785.htm |publisher=China Internet Information Center|accessdate=1 May 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080501152800/http://www1.china.org.cn/english/features/beijing/30785.htm| archivedate= 1 May 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] This settlement was later conquered by the state of Yan and made its capital under the name Yanjing.Haw, Stephen. Beijing: A Concise History. Routledge, 2007. p. 136.

===Early Imperial China===

After the First Emperor unified China, Beijing became a prefectural capital for the region. During the Three Kingdoms period, it was held by Gongsun Zan and Yuan Shao before falling to Cao Cao's Wei Kingdom. The AD 3rd-century Western Jin demoted the town, placing the prefectural seat in neighboring Zhuozhou.  During the Sixteen Kingdoms period when northern China was conquered and divided by the Wu Hu, Beijing, as Jicheng was briefly the capital of the Xianbei Former Yan Kingdom.
After China was reunified during the Sui Dynasty, Beijing, known as Zhuojun, became the northern terminus of the Grand Canal.  Under the Tang Dynasty, Beijing as Fanyang, served as a military frontier command center. During the An-Shi Rebellion and again amidst the turmoil of the late Tang, local military commanders founded their own short-lived Yan Dynasties and called the city Yanjing, or the "Yan Capital."  In 938, after the fall of the Tang, the Later Jin ceded the entire northern frontier to the Khitan Liao Dynasty, which renamed the city, Nanjing, or the "Southern Capital", one of four secondary capitals to complement its "Supreme Capital", Shangjing (modern Baarin Left Banner in Inner Mongolia).  Some of the oldest surviving structures in Beijing date to the Liao period, including the Tianning Pagoda.
The Liao fell to the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1122, which gave the city to the Song Dynasty and then retook it in 1125 during its conquest of northern China.  In 1153, the Jin made Beijing their "Central Capital", called Zhongdu. The city was besieged by Genghis Khan's invading Mongolian army in 1213 and razed to the ground two years later.[tpl]cite news |title=Beijing – Historical Background |url=http://www.economist.com/cities/findstory.cfm?city_id=BJS&folder=Facts-History |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070522144445/http://www.economist.com/cities/findstory.cfm?city_id=BJS&folder=Facts-History |archivedate=2007-05-22 |work=The Economist|year=2007[/tpl] Two generations later, Kublai Khan ordered the construction of Dadu (or Daidu to the Mongols, commonly known as Khanbaliq), a new capital for his Yuan dynasty to be located adjacent to the Jin ruins. The construction took from 1264 to 1293,Brian Hook, Beijing and Tianjin: Towards a Millennial Megalopolis, p. 2 but greatly enhanced the status of a city on the northern fringe of China proper. The city was centered on the Drum Tower slightly to the north of modern Beijing and stretched from the present-day Chang'an Avenue to the Line 10 subway. Remnants of the Yuan packed earth wall still stand and are known as the Tucheng.[tpl]cite web |title=元大都土城遗址公园  |url=http://www.tuniu.com/places/17645 |work=Tuniu.com |accessdate=15 June 2008[/tpl] [tpl]zh icon[/tpl]

===Ming Dynasty===

In 1368, soon after declaring the new Hongwu era of the Ming Dynasty, the rebel leader Zhu Yuanzhang sent an army to Khanbaliq and burnt it to the ground.Ebrey, Patricia Buckley. The Cambridge Illustrated History of China. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999. ISBN=0-521-66991-X Since the Yuan continued to occupy Shangdu and Mongolia, however, a new town was established to supply the military garrisons in the area.[tpl]harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|p=23[/tpl] This was called 'Beiping'Susan Naquin, Peking: Temples and City Life, 1400–1900'', p xxxiii and under the Hongwu Emperor's feudal policies it was given to Zhu Di, one of his sons, who was created "Prince of Yan".
The early death of Zhu Yuanzhang's heir led to a succession struggle on his death, one that ended with the victory of Zhu Di and the declaration of the new Yongle era. Since his harsh treatment of the Ming capital Yingtian (Nanjing) alienated many there, he established his fief as a new co-capital. The city of Beiping became Shuntian[tpl]cite web|title=An Illustrated Survey of Dikes and Dams in Jianghan Region|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4451|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=9 May 2013[/tpl]  {–} now Beijing in 1403. The construction of the new imperial residence, the Forbidden City, took from 1406 to 1420; this period was also responsible for several other of the modern city's major attractions, such as the Temple of Heaven[ref]
