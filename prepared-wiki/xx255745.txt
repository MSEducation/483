The events began on 18 December 2010 and led to the ousting of longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. It eventually led to a thorough democratization of the country and to free and democratic elections. They saw the victory of a coalition of the Islamist Ennahda Movement with the centre-left Congress for the Republic and the left-leaning Ettakatol as junior partners.

Following Ben Ali's departure from the country, a state of emergency was declared. The Constitutional Court affirmed Fouad Mebazaa as acting president under Article 57 of the Constitution. A caretaker coalition government was also created, including members of Ben Ali's party, the Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD), in key ministries, while including other opposition figures in other ministries, with elections to take place within 60 days. However, five newly appointed non-RCD ministers resigned almost immediately, and daily street protests in Tunis and other towns around Tunisia continued, demanding that the new government have no RCD members and that the RCD itself be disbanded. On 27 January Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi reshuffled the government, removing all former RCD members other than himself. On 6 February the new interior minister suspended all party activities of the RCD, citing security reasons.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/02/05/tunisian-police-chief-fires-crowd-kills/ |agency=Associated Press|title=Tunisian minister suspends ex-ruling party |publisher=Fox News |date=5 February 2011[/tpl] The party was dissolved, as protesters had demanded, on 9 March 2011.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-03-09-Tunisia_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Most Popular E-mail Newsletter | date=9 March 2011[/tpl]
Following further public protests, Ghannouchi himself resigned on 27 February, and Beji Caid el Sebsi became Prime Minister; two other members of the Interim Government resigned on the following day. On 3 March 2011, the president announced the elections for the Constituent Assembly, which were held on 23 October 2011 with the Islamist Ennahda Party winning the plurality of seats.

==Naming==

In Tunisia and the wider Arab world, the protests and change in government are called the Sidi Bouzid Revolt, derived from Sidi Bouzid, the city where the initial protests began.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=151395198244689 |title=Niet compatibele browser |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=8 February 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://libcom.org/forums/news/protests-spread-tunisia-29122010 |title=The Sidi Bouzid Revolution: Ben Ali flees as protests spread in Tunisia |publisher=libcom.org |accessdate=8 February 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8thJM2nmd_g |title=Revolte Tunisie Sidi bouzid 3 |publisher=YouTube |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2011[/tpl] In the Western media, these events have been dubbed the Jasmine Revolution or Jasmine Spring[tpl]cite web|last=Carvin|first=Andy|title=Sidi Bou Zid: A Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia|url=http://storify.com/acarvin/sidi-bou-zid-a-jasmine-revolution-in-tunisia|publisher=Storify|accessdate=7 December 2013[/tpl] after Tunisia's national flower and in keeping with the geopolitical nomenclature of "color revolutions".

The Tunisian revolution has also been considered the first of a series of revolutions named the Arab Spring.

==Background==

President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali had ruled Tunisia since 1987. His government was characterized by the development of Tunisia's private sector in favor of foreign investment, and the repression of political opposition. Foreign media and NGOs criticized his government, which was supported by the United States and France. As a result, the initial reactions to Ben Ali's abuses by the U.S. and France were muted, and most instances of socio-political protest in the country, when they occurred at all, rarely made major news headlines.
Riots in Tunisia were rare[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/10/world/main7233191.shtml |title=Deadly Riots in Tunisia Shut Down Schools |publisher=CBS News |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=15 January 2011[/tpl] and noteworthy, especially since the country is generally considered to be wealthy and stable as compared to other countries in the region.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/2011191414183128.html |title=Protesters killed in Tunisia riots |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=9 January 2011 |accessdate=15 January 2011[/tpl] Any form of protests in the country were previously successfully oppressed and kept silent by the former regime and protesters would be jailed for such actions, as were for example protests by hundreds of unemployed demonstrators in Redeyef in 2008.[tpl]cite web|first1=Jean-Marie|last1=Lemaire|first2=Rim|last2=Mathlouti|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110215-reporters-tunisia-redeyef-gafsa-mining-phosphate-accusations-competition-rigged-ben-ali-supporters-protests-journalists |title=Redeyef, the precursor of the Tunisian revolution |publisher=http://www.france24.com |date=15 February 2011 |accessdate=15 February 2011[/tpl] Al Jazeera English also said that Tunisian activists are amongst the most outspoken in its part of the world with various messages of support being posted on Twitter for Bouazizi.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/2010122063745828931.html |title=Riots reported in Tunisian city – Africa – Al Jazeera English |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=20 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011[/tpl] An op-ed article in the same network said of the action that it was "suicidal protests of despair by Tunisia's youth." It pointed out that the state-controlled National Solidarity Fund and the National Employment Fund had traditionally subsidized many goods and services in the country but had started to shift the "burden of providence from state to society" to be funded by the bidonvilles, or shanty towns, around the richer towns and suburbs.[tpl]clarify|date=January 2011[/tpl] It also cited the "marginalisation of the agrarian and arid central and southern areas that continues unabated."[tpl]cite web|author=Sadiki, Larbi |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2010/12/20101227142811755739.html |title=Tunisia: The battle of Sidi Bouzid – Opinion – Al Jazeera English |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=27 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011[/tpl] The protests were also called an "uprising" because of "a lethal combination of poverty, unemployment and political repression: three characteristics of most Arab societies."[tpl]cite web|author=Andoni, Lamis |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2010/12/20101231161958792947.html |title=The rebirth of Arab activism – Opinion |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=31 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011[/tpl]

===Mohamed Bouazizi and Sidi Bouzidi===

Twenty-six-year-old Mohamed Bouazizi had been the sole income earner in his extended family of eight. He operated a vegetable cart for seven years in Sidi Bouzid 190 miles (300 km) south of Tunis. On 17 December 2010, a policewoman confiscated his cart and produce. Bouazizi, who had such an event happen to him before, tried to pay the 10-dinar fine (a day's wages, equivalent to 7USD). In response the policewoman 
insulted his deceased father and slapped him. The policewoman, Faida Hamdi, tells a markedly different story.[tpl]cite journal|title=The Woman Who Blew Up the Arab World|journal=World Affairs Journal|date=17 May 2012|month=May–June |url=http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/michael-j-totten/woman-who-blew-arab-world|accessdate=17 May 2012|author=Totten, Michael J. |quote="Barack Obama mentioned me in a speech. He said I was a cop. He said I slapped Mohamed Bouazizi. He's a stupid fool for not checking. Americans are great people, but you need to do a better job of checking your information."[/tpl] A humiliated Bouazizi then went to the provincial headquarters in an attempt to complain to local municipality officials and to have his produce returned. He was refused an audience. Without alerting his family, at 11:30 am and within an hour of the initial confrontation, Bouazizi returned to the headquarters, doused himself with a flammable liquid and set himself on fire. Public outrage quickly grew over the incident, leading to protests.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2043557,00.html | title=Bouazizi: The Man Who Set Himself and Tunisia on Fire | author=Abouzeid, Rania | date=21 January 2011|work=Time[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/922279--suicide-protest-helped-topple-tunisian-regime | title=Suicide protest helped topple Tunisian regime | location=Toronto | work=The Star | date=14 January 2011[/tpl] This immolation and the subsequent heavy-handed response by the police to peaceful marchers caused riots the next day in Sidi Bouzid that went largely unnoticed, although social media sites such as Facebook and YouTube featured images of police dispersing youths who attacked shop windows and damaged cars. Bouazizi was subsequently transferred to a hospital near Tunis. In an attempt to quell the unrest President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali visited Bouazizi in hospital on 28 December 2010. Bouazizi died on 4 January 2011.[tpl]Cite news | url=http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE70408420110105 | title=Tunisian who sparked rare protests dies: relatives -Reuters | agency=Reuters | date=5 January 2011 | accessdate=14 January 2011[/tpl]

==Protests==

Though the bulk of protests followed Mohamed Bouazizi's self-immolation and led to the departure of Ben Ali, protests also continued after his departure in demanding his party be removed from government. Some more minor protests followed the cabinet reshuffle.

===Early Protests===

There were reports of police obstructing demonstrators and using tear gas on hundreds of young protesters in Sidi Bouzid in mid-December 2010. The protesters had gathered outside regional government headquarters to demonstrate against the treatment of Mohamed Bouazizi. Coverage of events was limited by Tunisian media. On [tpl]Nowrap|19 December[/tpl], extra police were present on the streets of the city.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/2010122063745828931.html|title=Images posted on social-network sites show police intervening to halt disturbances ignored by national media|date=20 December 2010|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=20 December 2010[/tpl]
On 22 December, Lahseen Naji, a protester, responded to "hunger and joblessness" by electrocuting himself after climbing an electricity pylon. Ramzi Al-Abboudi also killed himself because of financial difficulties arising from a business debt by the country's micro-credit solidarity programme. On [tpl]Nowrap|24 December[/tpl], Mohamed Ammari was fatally shot in the chest by police in Bouziane. Other protesters were also injured, including Chawki Belhoussine El Hadri, who died later on [tpl]Nowrap|30 December[/tpl].[tpl]Cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/201012317536678834.html|title=A protester dies after being shot by police, as activists criticise government repression of protests|date=31 December 2010|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=31 December 2010[/tpl] Police claimed they shot the demonstrators in "self-defence."

On 30 December, police peacefully broke up a protest in Monastir while using force to disrupt further demonstrations in Sbikha and Chebba. Momentum appeared to continue with the protests on [tpl]Nowrap|31 December[/tpl] and further demonstrations and public gatherings by lawyers in Tunis and other cities following a call by the Tunisian National Lawyers Order. Mokhtar Trifi, president of the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH), said that lawyers across Tunisia had been "savagely beaten." There were also unconfirmed reports of another man attempting to commit suicide in El Hamma.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://24sur24.posterous.com/video-today-a-young-unemployed-man-trying-to|title=video: today a young unemployed man trying to commit a suicide in El Hamma #sidibouzid|date=31 December 2010|work=Nawaat|accessdate=31 December 2010[/tpl]
On 3 January 2011, protests in Thala over unemployment and a high cost of living turned violent. At a demonstration of 250 people, mostly students, in support of the protesters in Sidi Bouzid, police fired tear gas; one canister landed in a local mosque. In response, the protesters were reported to have set fire to tyres and attacked the office of Constitutional Democratic Rally.[tpl]cite web|author=Randeree, Bilal |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/201114101752467578.html |title=Violent clashes continue in Tunisia – Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011[/tpl]
Some of the more general protests sought changes in the government's online censorship, where a lot of the media images have been broadcast. Tunisian authorities also allegedly carried out phishing operations to take control of user passwords and check online criticism. Both state and non-state websites had been hacked.[tpl]cite web|author=Ryan, Yasmine |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/01/20111614145839362.html |title=Tunisia's bitter cyberwar – Features |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011[/tpl]

===Rising elites' support and continuing protests===

On 6 January 95% of Tunisia's 8,000 lawyers went on strike, according to the chairman of the national bar association. He said "The strike carries a clear message that we do not accept unjustified attacks on lawyers. We want to strongly protest against the beating of lawyers in the past few days."[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/201116193136690227.html |title=Thousands of Tunisia lawyers strike – Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011[/tpl] It was reported on the following day that teachers had also joined the strike.[tpl]Cite news|last=Sandels |first=Alexandra |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-tunisia-riots-20110108,0,1279820.story |title=Rioting spreads across Tunisia; unrest also reported in Algeria |work=Los Angeles Times |date=8 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011[/tpl]
In response to 11 January protests police used riot gear to disperse protesters ransacking buildings, burning tires, setting fire to a bus and burning two cars in the working class suburb of Ettadhamen-Mnihla in Tunis. The protesters were said to have chanted "We are not afraid, we are not afraid, we are afraid only of God." Military personnel were also deployed in many cities around the country.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/video/africa/2011/01/2011111214716877786.html |title=Tunisia unrest spreads to capital – Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=14 January 2011[/tpl]

===Protests against the RCD and new government===

Internal and external protests against the presence of RCD members in the new government occurred daily starting on 17 January, the day that the new cabinet was announced.

====Cabinet reshuffle====

On 27 January 2011 Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi announced that six former members of the RCD party had left the interim government. These included Defence Minister, Foreign Minister, Finance Minister and Interior Minister. Apart from the prime minister, the new government retained just two ministers from Ben Ali's old government—the industry and international cooperation ministers—but neither of these had been a member of his ruling RCD party.

Another protestor, Naim Garbousi from Casbah Media Relations, stated, "The new line-up is a theatre. The symbols of the old regime are left, like Ghannouchi. Why is he insisting on staying? We are 10 million people, there will surely be someone who can replace him."
On 2 February 2011, the former interior minister, Rafik Belhaj Kacem also, was arrested by his successor, Farhat Rajhi, concurrently with accusations of former allies of Ben Ali trying to destabilize the state.[tpl]cite web|url=http://dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&categ_id=2&article_id=124437#axzz1CtomXvJQ |title=Politics – Tunisia interior minister says predecessor arrested |work=The Daily Star |date=2 February 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2011[/tpl]

On 4 February, Sidi Bouzid was again the scene of protests despite the arrests of two security forces personnel for deaths of two. Several hundred people turned up at the local police station as a result of medical staff at a local hospital saying they found signs of burning on the victims' bodies. On 5 February, protesters in El Kef called for the local police chief Khaled Ghazouani to be sacked for abusing his authority. Protesters threw stones and small firebombs as well as burned two cars, one of which was a police vehicle.

===Refugees===

In mid-February 2011, about 4,000 mostly Tunisian refugees landed on the Italian island of Lampedusa, causing the authorities to declare a state of emergency[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/02/20112122328974957.html |title=Italy declares migrant emergency – Europe |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=13 February 2011[/tpl] that would allow for federal aid to the island. Interior Minister Roberto Maroni accused the EU of not doing enough to curb immigration and asked them to do more.[tpl]cite news|agency=Agenzia Giornalistica Italia |url=http://www.agi.it/english-version/world/elenco-notizie/201102112043-pol-ren1094-tunisia_italy_asks_eu_to_start_frontex_mission |title=Tunisia: Italy Asks Eu To Start Frontex Mission |publisher=Agi.it |accessdate=13 February 2011[/tpl] He said that the "Tunisian system was 'collapsing'" and that he would "ask the Tunisian Foreign Ministry for permission for our authorities to intervene to stop the flow in Tunisia," suggesting Italian troops would be on Tunisian soil.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12443740 |title=Italy 'to deploy police to Tunisia' to tackle migration |publisher=BBC News |date=13 February 2011|accessdate=13 February 2011[/tpl] He called the event a "biblical exodus." The comments started a row between the two countries with the Tunisian Foreign Ministry saying it was ready to work with Italy and others but that it "categorically rejects any interference in its internal affairs or any infringement of its sovereignty." In response, Italy's Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said that both countries share a "common interest" to halt the immigration, while he also offered "logistical help in terms of police and equipment. Until now the system of patrolling the coasts of Northern Africa has worked and we want to re-establish the technique, which had reduced illegal immigration to zero until a month ago." Tunisia then said that it had troops patrolling southern fishing ports and that checkpoints had been erected in coastal towns. By 14 February, at least 2,000 refugees had been sent to Sicily with the other 2,000 quarantined at a re-opened holding centre. On 2 March about 350 more people arrived on the island. In response Italy declared a humanitarian emergency.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/03/201132135258524383.html |title=Tunisian migrants land in Italy |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=2 March 2011 |accessdate=22 June 2011[/tpl]
The International Organisation for Migration said that no new boats had been spotted. The EU's Catherine Ashton was on a visit to Tunisia to discuss the issue.

In January 2011, Ben Ali said 300,000 new jobs would be created, though he did not clarify what that meant. However, he also described the protests as "the work of masked gangs that attacked at night government buildings and even civilians inside their homes in a terrorist act that cannot be overlooked." Ahmed Najib Chebbi, the leader of the Progressive Democratic Party, then said that despite official claims of police firing in self-defense "the demonstrations were non-violent and the youths were claiming their rights to jobs" and that "the funeral processions those killed on 9 January turned into demonstrations, and the police fired at the youths who were at these ... processions." He then criticised Ben Ali's comments as the protesters were "claiming their civil rights, and there is no terrorist act...no religious slogans," while accusing Ben Ali of "looking for scapegoats." He further criticised the additional jobs offered as mere "promises."[tpl]cite web|author=Randeree, Bilal |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/201111016239214548.html |title=Tunisian leader promises new jobs – Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011[/tpl]

===International and non-state===

Many governments and supranational organisations expressed concerns over use of force against protesters. France, the former colonial power of Tunisia, was one of just a few states that expressed strong support for the Ben Ali government prior to its ouster, though protests were held in solidarity with Tunisia in several French cities and the French Socialist Party voiced support for the popular revolution.

The lack of coverage in the domestic state-controlled media was criticised. Writer/activist Jillian York alleged that the mainstream media, particularly in the Western world, was providing less coverage and less sympathetic coverage to the Tunisia protests relative to Iranian protests and the Green movement and China's censorship. York alleged the "US government—which intervened heavily in Iran, approving circumvention technology for export and famously asking Twitter to halt updates during a critical time period—has not made any public overtures toward Tunisia at this time."[tpl]cite web|author=York, Jillian |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/20111981222719974.html |title=Activist crackdown: Tunisia vs Iran – Opinion |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=9 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011[/tpl]

==Repercussion analysis==

Al Jazeera believes the ousting of the president means the "glass ceiling of fear has been for ever shattered in Tunisia and that the police state that Ben Ali created in 1987 when he came to power in a coup seems to be disintegrating", though it added that Ben Ali's resignation following his statement that he had been "duped by his entourage" may not entirely be sincere just yet. Le Monde criticised French President Nicolas Sarkozy and the European Union's "Silence over the Tragedy" when the unrest broke.[tpl]cite web|author=Ahelbarra, Hashem |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/2011/01/14/tunisia-end-era |title=Tunisia: The end of an era | Al Jazeera Blogs |publisher=Blogs.aljazeera.net |accessdate=15 January 2011[/tpl] The Christian Science Monitor suggested that mobile telecommunications played an influential role in the "revolution."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/Africa-Monitor/2011/0115/Tunisia-s-Jasmine-Revolution-and-how-mobile-phones-helped-it-happen |title=Tunisia's Jasmine Revolution, and how mobile phones helped it happen |work=The Christian Science Monitor |date=15 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl]
The revolt in Tunisia began speculation that the Tunisian Jasmine Revolution would lead to protests against the multiple other autocratic regimes across the Arab world. This was most famously captured in the phrase asking whether "Tunisia is the Arab Gdańsk?. The allusion refers to the Polish Solidarity movement and Gdańsk's role as the birthplace of the movement that ousted Communism in Eastern Europe. The phrase appeared in outlets such as the BBC,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9362000/9362677.stm |title=Today – Is this the 'Arab world's Gdansk?' |publisher=BBC News |date=15 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl] as well as editorials by well known columnists Rami Khouri[tpl]cite web|url=http://mondoweiss.net/2011/01/khouri-tunisia-is-gdansk-shipyard-of-80-with-jazeera-as-megaphone-to-other-arab-countries.html |title=Khouri: Tunisia is Gdansk shipyard of ‘80 with Jazeera as megaphone to other Arab countries! |publisher=Mondoweiss.net |date=16 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl] and Roger Cohen.[tpl]Cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/opinion/18iht-edcohen18.html | title = The Arab Gdansk | accessdate=28 January 2011 | author=Cohen, Roger |work=The New York Times | date=17 January 2011[/tpl]
Larbi Sadiki suggested that although "conventional wisdom has it that 'terror' in the Arab world is monopolised by al-Qaeda in its various incarnations" there was also the fact that "regimes in countries like Tunisia and Algeria have been arming and training security apparatuses to fight Osama bin Laden but were still caught unawares by the 'bin Laden within': the terror of marginalisation for the millions of educated youth who make up a large portion of the region's population. The winds of uncertainty blowing in the Arab west – the Maghreb – threaten to blow eastwards towards the Levant as the marginalised issue the fatalistic scream of despair to be given freedom and bread or death."[tpl]cite web|author=Sadiki, Larbi |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/201111413424337867.html |title=The 'bin Laden' of marginalisation – Opinion |publisher=Al Jazeera |accessdate=15 January 2011[/tpl] A similar op-ed in Al Jazeera by Lamis Ardoni said that the protests had "brought down the walls of fear, erected by repression and marginalisation, thus restoring the Arab peoples' faith in their ability to demand social justice and end tyranny." He also said that the protests that succeeded in toppling the leadership should serve as a "warning to all leaders, whether supported by international or regional powers, that they are no longer immune to popular outcries of fury" even though Tunisia's ostensible change "could still be contained or confiscated by the country's ruling elite, which is desperately clinging to power." He called the protests the "Tunisian intifada" which had "placed the Arab world at a crossroads." He further added that if the change was ultimately successful in Tunisia it could "push the door wide open to freedom in Arab word [tpl]sic[/tpl]. If it suffers a setback we shall witness unprecedented repression by rulers struggling to maintain their absolute grip on power. Either way, a system that combined a starkly unequal distribution of wealth with the denial of freedoms has collapsed."[tpl]cite web|author=Andoni, Lamis|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/2011115135046129936.html |title=To the tyrants of the Arab world... |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=16 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl]
Similarly, Mark LeVine noted that the events in Tunisia could spiral into the rest of the Arab world as the movement was "inspiring people...to take to the streets and warn their own sclerotic and autocratic leaders that they could soon face a similar fate." He then cited solidarity protests in Egypt where protesters chanted "Kefaya" and "We are next, we are next, Ben Ali tell Mubarak he is next;" and that Arab bloggers were supporting the movement in Tunisia as "the African revolution commencing...the global anti-capitalist revolution." He pointed to an article in al-Nahar that talked of an "inhuman globalisation" that had been imposed on the Arab world, however a "human" nationalism had not taken place. LeVine then accused the Obama administration in the United States of double standards when Clinton was in the region meeting with political and civil society leaders, however she responded to a question about the protests saying "We can't take sides," which was read as a failure to seize the "reigns of history" and "usher in a new era" to "defeat the forces of extremism" without the violent conflict in the Afghanistan-Pakistan area. Pointing out Clinton's remarks about regimes whose "foundations are sinking into the sand" and needed "reform", LeVine argued that US foreign policy in the Middle East and the Muslim world was "equally in danger of sinking into the sands if the President and his senior officials are not willing to get ahead of history's suddenly accelerating curve." He added, "It is the US and Europe, as much as the leaders of the region, who in Clinton's words are in need of 'a real vision for that future.'" Finally he said there were two scenarios that could play out: "a greater democratic opening across the Arab world," or a similar situation to Algeria in the early 1990s when the democratic election was annulled and the Algeria went into a civil war.[tpl]cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/20111167156465567.html|title=Tunisia: How the US got it wrong[/tpl]
Robert Fisk asked if this was "The end of the age of dictators in the Arab world?" and partly answered the question in saying that Arab leaders would be "shaking in their boots." He also pointed out that the "despot" Ben Ali sought refuge in the same place as the ousted Idi Amin of Uganda and that "the French and the Germans and the Brits, dare we mention this, always praised the dictator for being a 'friend' of civilised Europe, keeping a firm hand on all those Islamists." He notably pointed at the "demographic explosion of youth" of the Maghreb, though he said that the change brought about in Tunisia may not last. He thinks "this is going to be the same old story. Yes, we would like a democracy in Tunisia – but not too much democracy. Remember how we wanted Algeria to have a democracy back in the early Nineties? Then when it looked like the Islamists might win the second round of voting, we supported its military-backed government in suspending elections and crushing the Islamists and initiating a civil war in which 150,000 died. No, in the Arab world, we want law and order and stability." He added that "If it can happen in the holiday destination Tunisia, it can happen anywhere, can't it?"[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/fisk/the-brutal-truth-about-tunisia-2186287.html|title=The brutal truth about Tunisia|work=The Independent | location=London|first=Robert|last=Fisk|date=17 January 2011[/tpl]
Blake Hounshell wrote on Foreign Policy.com that the Tunisian precedent raised the prospect of a "new trend. There is something horrifying and, in a way, moving about these suicide attempts. It's a shocking, desperate tactic that instantly attracts attention, revulsion, but also sympathy."[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl]

===Impact of the internet===

The use of communication technologies, and the Internet in particular, has been widely credited as contributor to the mobilisation of protests.Kravets, David. (22 August 2013) Threat Level. Wired.com. Retrieved on 9 September 2013. A blog associated with Wired described the intricate efforts of the Tunisian authorities to control such online media as[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/01/tunisia/|title=Tweeting Tyrants Out of Tunisia: Global Internet at Its Best|publisher=Threat Level / Wired | first1=Nate|last1=Anderson|first2=Ars|last2=Technica|date=14 January 2011[/tpl] Twitter and Facebook. Other regional regimes were also on higher alert to contain spillover effects that may ensue.
On 11 March 2011, Reporters Without Borders gave its annual award for online media freedom to the Tunisian blogging group Nawaat.org. Founded in 2004, it played an important role rallying anti-government protesters by reporting on the protests which the national media ignored.Tunisian bloggers win online media award, AP, 11 March 2011

==Regional instability==

Bouazizi's actions resonated across the region, with many others across the Arab world following suit: "Clearly the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi has resonated across the region...'There is great interest. The Egyptian people and the Egyptian public have been following the events in Tunisia with so much joy, since they can draw parallels between the Tunisian situation and their own.'"[tpl]Cite news|last=Westcott |first=Kathryn |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12206551 |title=Why do people set themselves on fire? |publisher=BBC News |date=18 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011[/tpl]
After the beginning of the uprising in Tunisia, similar protests took place in almost all Arab countries from Morocco to Iraq, as well as in other states, ranging from Gabon to Albania, Iran, Kazakhstan, United States, India and others. Following weeks of protests, Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak resigned on 11 February. Major protests against longtime Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi broke out on 17 February and quickly deteriorated into civil war, ultimately resulting in the downfall of the Gaddafi regime later in the year. Syria is currently experiencing a major uprising of people calling for the removal of President Bashar al-Assad, during which the UN estimates over 70,000 people have died.[tpl]cite news|last=Kennedy |first=Elizabeth |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i07kWOqElvzDuz7D_jIW3e6qFKfA?docId=5018e08ad07842a796e9a88e8b8e830c |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120109160607/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i07kWOqElvzDuz7D_jIW3e6qFKfA?docId=5018e08ad07842a796e9a88e8b8e830c |archivedate=2012-01-09 |title=UN says death toll in Syria exceeds 5,000 |agency=Associated Press |date=13 December 2011|accessdate=18 December 2011[/tpl] In addition, Yemen, Bahrain, and Algeria have seen major protests.
However, a financial analyst in Dubai suggested that "the spillover effect of the political turbulence to the large countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council is non-existent as there are no similar drivers."[tpl]cite news|last=Hankir |first=Zahra |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-30/dubai-shares-plunge-most-in-year-lead-gulf-drop-on-egypt-risk-protests.html |title=Dubai Shares Fall Most Since May on Egypt Unrest, Pacing Mideast Decline |publisher=Bloomberg |date=30 January 2011|accessdate=1 February 2011[/tpl]

==Aftermath==

In mid-May 2013, Tunisia banned Salafist Ansar al-Sharia (Tunisia) from carrying out party congresses. The day after the congress was due to be carried out, clashes between security forces and party supporters in Kairouan resulted in one death amid attempts to disperse those who wanted to carry out the events.Salafist group clashes with police in Tunisia – Africa.
