==Early life==

Pauline Esther Friedman, nicknamed "Popo", was born in Sioux City, Iowa to Russian Jewish immigrants, Rebecca (née Rushall) and Abraham B. Friedman, owner of a chain of movie theaters."Pauline Phillips, Flinty Adviser to Millions as Dear Abby, Dies at 94", The New York Times, January 17, 2013 She was the youngest of four sisters and grew up in Sioux City. One sister was an identical twin, Esther Pauline Friedman, who later became the columnist Ann Landers.
In describing her family's emigration to America, Phillips says, "My parents came with nothing. They all came with nothing." She adds that her parents never forgot first seeing the Statue of Liberty:
Her sister, Esther, recalls their home life: "My father was the sort of man people came to for advice. My mother couldn't turn away anyone with a hard-luck story. Our house was always full of guests." Phillips agrees, and understood that her parents had a clear effect on her own personality:

They both played the violin. In 1939, they were married in a double-wedding ceremony on their birthday.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jodyewing.com/jeanne_phillips_8_01.html |title=Daughter Helps Keep 'Abby' Ink Flowing |author=Ewing, Jody |date=August 23, 2001 |publisher=Ewing, Jody |accessdate=September 26, 2010[/tpl] She married Morton Phillips of Minneapolis, and had two children, a son, Edward Jay Phillips, and a daughter, Jeanne Phillips.

==Career==

Pauline's writing career that led to "Dear Abby" began in January 1956 when she was 37 and new to the greater San Francisco area.  Sometime during this period she phoned the editor of the San Francisco Chronicle and said that she could write a better advice column than the one she had been reading in the newspaper. After hearing her modest credentials, editor Stanleigh "Auk" Arnold gave her some letters in need of answers and said to bring back her replies in a week; Phillips got her replies back to the Chronicle in an hour and half. In an interview with Larry King, she said she had no work experience, lacking even a social security number. The editor, however, asked her if she was a professional writer. He said her writing was "fabulous," and she was hired that day.video interview: "'Dear Abby' talks about her big break", CNN
She went by the pen name Abigail Van Buren, after the Old Testament prophetess from the Book of Samuel: Then David said to Abigail ... ‘Blessed is your advice and blessed are you. "Van Buren" was used after the president, Martin Van Buren.[tpl]cite news |title=At 72, 'Dear Abby' Says Retirement Is A Dirty Word |author=Ander, Marsha S. |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/s/InfoWeb/aggdocs/AWNB/0EB04D391BB2E2F9/0D0CB57AB53DF815 |newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |date=June 8, 1991 |accessdate=2011-09-14 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/61hknl0Nb |archivedate=September 14, 2011 [/tpl]
Phillips says that because she applied for the columnist job without notifying her sister first, it created bad feelings between them for many years. They each wrote their own advice column, and as competing columnists, they sometimes clashed; in 1956, Phillips offered her column to the Sioux City Journal at a reduced price, provided that the paper refused to print her sister's column. The sisters ostensibly reconciled in 1964, although some suggest the acrimony between them remained.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Landers.html|first=Robin|last=Judd|title=Ann Landers biography |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library[/tpl] In 1958, after only two years writing their columns, they became "the most widely read and most quoted women in the world," according to Life magazine.Life magazine, April 7, 1958 pp. 102–112

===Writing style===

Although newspapers had included gossip and personal columnists for over a century, the two sisters added "something special," writes Life, in that they were the first to publish letters and their replies covering a wide range of personal problems. From as many as 9,000 letters in a single week in their initial years, they responded with answers to people from all walks of life, including doctors, lawyers and clergymen, as well as from pregnant teenagers, harassed husbands, unwed mothers, alcoholics, gays, and mistresses. Setting their column apart even more from columnists of earlier decades was their particular style of writing, replying with "vaudeville punch lines" yet always rooted in common sense. Phillips is described by the New York Times:
Phillips was considered liberal minded politically, yet personally conservative. She remained reluctant to advise unmarried couples to live together, for instance, until the 1990s, yet she adapted readily to social changes. One example:

Both Phillips and her sister were considered remarkable women soon after starting their careers, recognized for being bright and entertaining, and writing with "an earthy wit, audacity and awesome self-confidence," often exemplified in Phillips' "crackling one-liners."
 The editor of the Chicago Sun-Times described their skill as "beyond mere shrewdness—a quality very close to genuine wisdom." Amy Dickinson, a syndicated advice columnist who styles her columns after "Dear Abby," says that  Phillips' was a "master" in her ability to write with both "genuine honesty" and "compassion," while at the same time being able to respond with "tough love" when needed.video interview: "Remembering Pauline Phillips, 'Dear Abby'", PBS Newshour interview with Amy Dickinson, January 17, 2013

The letters Phillips and her sister picked for publication were meant to give the public glimpses of "the most intimate of human difficulties," which contributed to their immediate acceptance. Life magazine explains:
Phillips admits that the most sensitive letters she receives are never published, but are instead replied to individually. Sometimes she would write a brief note on the letter itself, letting one of her secretaries respond fully using her advice. If a person seemed suicidal from their letter, she would call them on the phone. As noted by Life:

===Public relations===

As part of their work both sisters engaged with other editors, publishers, and the general public whenever they could. "Neither ever forgets a name," and they were uninhibited public speakers: they "whirl around the country appearing on radio and television and—dressed like visiting movie actresses—holding thousands of housewives spellbound in speeches at theaters and auditoriums."

==Personal life and beliefs==

Like her sister, Phillips was considered "the embodiment of female orthodoxy." They made their husbands and families a high priority in their lives, feeling that "marriage must be permanent, even when disturbed by masculine lunacy." Phillips typically spoke in glowing terms about her husband in public, calling him "loveboat" or smooching with him in restaurants. This attitude carried over into their columns in the late 1950s, with Phillips considering women who were unable to make their marriages work as "faintly ridiculous." Her "code of conduct" was "husband and children first." In her later years, she did not avoid suggesting divorce when a relationship became "intolerable", and considered how a bad marriage might affect children: "When kids see parents fighting, or even sniping at each other, I think it is terribly damaging.""Dear Abby, advice columnist, sister of Ann Landers, dies at 94", The Chronicle Herald, Canada, January 17, 2013
Both Phillips and her sister enjoyed socializing with celebrities, and because of their notoriety, celebrities liked being seen with either of them. Among Phillips' friends soon after she began her column were politicians, including Senators Hubert Humphrey and Herbert Lehman; and entertainers, including Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin.
They also admired Bishop Fulton Sheen, whom they met when learning about Catholicism while studying about other religions. The bishop admired them both in return due to their ability to remain "unawed" and unaffected by the fame of others. Phillips, who was Jewish, commented: "He's one of the greatest men I ever met, but he'll be a Jew before I'm a Catholic." Phillips and Bishop Sheen corresponded often and she recalls their letters:
Phillips was an honorary member of Women in Communications, the American College of Psychiatrists, and the National Council of Jewish Women. She authored six books:  Dear Abby, Dear Teenager, Dear Abby on Marriage, Where Were You When President Kennedy was Shot?, The Dear Abby Wedding Planner, and The Best of Dear Abby. "The Dear Abby Show" aired on the CBS Radio Network for 12 years.Universal Press Syndicate historical files. When asked near the end of her career whether her years of writing the column were a lot of work, she said, "It's only work if you'd rather be doing something else." She felt that her career had been "fulfilling, exciting and incredibly rewarding."
In 2002, when Phillips suffered from the onset of Alzheimer's disease, her daughter Jeanne assumed all the writing responsibilities of Dear Abby. After the family's announcement of Pauline's illness, Jeanne assumed the pen name Abigail Van Buren; from 1987 until her mother's retirement, Jeanne had been co-writing the column with her mother.[tpl]cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/DrJohnson/story?id=128029&page=1|title='Dear Abby' Struggles With Alzheimer's|date=February 12, 2010|author=Johnson, Dr. Tim|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=September 26, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Fisher|first=Luchina|title='Dear Abby' Advice Columnist Dies|url=http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/dear-abbys-pauline-phillips-dies-94-185625189--abc-news-celebrities.html|publisher=ABC News Blogs|accessdate=January 17, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-08-07/news/0208070300_1_jeanne-phillips-dear-abby-eppie-lederer|title=Dear Abby creator has Alzheimer's, family announces|date=August 7, 2002|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=September 26, 2010[/tpl]
