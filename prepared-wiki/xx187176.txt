The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via secret ballot to determine the five nominees for the award. Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by Bangladesh for review by the Academy for the award by year and the respective Academy Awards ceremony.
The Bangladeshi nominee is decided annually by the Bangladesh Federation of Film Societies. All Bangladeshi submissions were filmed in Bengali.
All Bangladeshi submissions since 2005 have been produced by Impress Tele Films film studio, based in the capital Dhaka, and there was a lot of cast crossover between the films. Actors Fazlur Rahman Babu, Jayanta Chattopadhyay and Shahidul Islam Sachchu, as well as actress Rokeya Prachi each had leading roles in three out of the six submitted films, including Britter Baire in which all four co-starred.
