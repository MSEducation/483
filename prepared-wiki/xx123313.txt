AISZ was a secondary day school offering a college-preparatory curriculum in English to young people in the international community of Zurich and the surrounding area. Co-educational, non-sectarian, and non-political, AISZ aimed to serve the educational needs of the international community in a changing world.
Founded in 1963 by a group of parents and educators, the American International School of Zurich, a secondary day school (grades 7-13), offered a broad college-preparatory curriculum in English to students from the international community of Zurich and the surrounding area. As an international school AISZ aimed to provide a sound education for its students both in academic achievement and personal growth, regardless of religion, race, nationality or sex. 90%+ of the graduating seniors entered universities and institutions of higher learning worldwide.
A strong academic program, centered around the traditional core disciplines, prepared the academically-inclined student for university entrance. However, the school also offered courses and learning support services which addressed the needs of a student body diverse in educational background and ability.
A small middle and high school with a dedicated faculty, AISZ sought to foster an atmosphere conducive to personal growth which it pursued with vigor not only within, but also outside the classroom through a variety of other activities, clubs, sports, and field trips.
AISZ was accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) and by the European Council of International Schools (ECIS).
