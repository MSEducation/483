Illinois Wesleyan University is an independent undergraduate liberal arts college located in Bloomington, Illinois. Founded in 1850, the central portion of the present campus was acquired in 1854 with the first building erected in 1856. It comprises 17 academic departments offering 50 majors and 476 courses.
The University's mission is to foster the traditional liberal arts of creativity, character, and knowledge. Its motto – Scientia et sapientia, or "Knowledge and wisdom" – was coined by famed explorer and Wesleyan Professor John Wesley Powell.

==History==

Illinois Wesleyan University was founded in 1850 by a diverse group of 30 civic and religious leaders who came together to establish "an Institution of learning of Collegiate grade." When a sponsor was needed, the founders gained support from the United Methodist Church, which is how "Wesleyan" was added to the original name, "Illinois University." While maintaining its Methodist affiliation, Illinois Wesleyan continues to be a diverse and inclusive community, independent in its governance.
Illinois Wesleyan's tradition of engaging its students inside and outside the classroom dates back to its earliest days when explorer-geologist John Wesley Powell, a founder of the National Geographic Society, joined the faculty in 1865. A pioneer of using field work in teaching science, Powell in 1867 took Illinois Wesleyan students to Colorado's mountains – one of the first expeditions of its kind in U.S. higher education.
The liberal arts and sciences have been at the foundation of Illinois Wesleyan's curriculum since its inception, and the fine arts were taught from its earliest years in the 19th century.IWU.edu
In 2005, the Undergraduate Economic Review was formed. The first of its kind, the journal is a peer-managed, open access Economics publication that features original content from undergraduate students both in the U.S. and at least 15 other countries. Published papers cover a variety of Economics-related topics, ranging from labor and monetary policy issues, to game theory frameworks.http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/uer/
On May 15, 2009, the University announced the beginning of its "Transforming Lives" fundraising campaign. The campaign aims to raise $125,000,000 to create endowed faculty positions, increase the number of grants and scholarships to students, create an expanded Theatre Arts Complex, a new Center for Instruction, and new student housing.IWU.edu

===May Term===

Illinois Wesleyan offers a May Term course option. The University refers to it as a 4–4–1 system. This allows any student who has completed a full course-load in either the Spring or Fall Semesters of that academic year to enroll in a May Term class.
May Term classes last approximately three weeks during the month of May. Students take several hours of instruction in the same course each day for five days each week. This allows the students to immerse themselves in that one topic. At the end of the May Term a student completes the equivalent of a single course during one semester.
May Term emphasizes curricular experimentation, and also offers an opportunity for service projects, study-abroad, and internships.IWU.edu
May Term is also sometimes referred to as "Play Term" by the students of Illinois Wesleyan. This applies to very few students as most of the May Term classes meet three hours every day and the workload is that of an entire semester. "Play" simply refers to the fact that there is more time to lounge on the quad, get off campus, and spend time with friends. Classes may also be more participatory or have lighter topics than those offered during the traditional semesters.

 And I still have faith in America because I love America and I believe that we will continue to build a coalition of conscience that one day will solve this problem. We sing a little song in our movement and it has been our guiding faith. Sometimes we’ve been facing hooded perpetrators of violence; sometimes we face jeering mobs. Sometimes we face dogs and the gushing waters from fire hoses. Sometimes in crowded jail cells we join hands to sing it. And sometimes in just open mass meetings. But we could sing it as a hymn of faith. We shall overcome, we shall overcome, deep in my heart I do believe we shall overcome.
