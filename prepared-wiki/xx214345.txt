The Lochridge estate was in the old feudal Baillerie of Cunninghame, near Stewarton in what is now East Ayrshire, Scotland.

==The history of Lochridge==

Nether Lochridge or Lochrig as it was originally known, belonged to the Arnots for nearly 400 years. Mathew Arnot Stewart, the last direct representative of the family, sold the estate to David Provan, a surgeon, in 1830.Dobie, Page 319 Robertson (1820) shows an Upper Lochridge as well as Lochridge. This property seems to be at the site of what is now called Draffen House. Colonel Barns owned Upper Lochrig, part of Auchenharvie and Kirkland in 1820. A Hugh Wyllie who died on 22 December 1823, aged 51, is recorded on his tombstone in the Laigh Kirk churchyard in Stewarton as having lived at Over Lochridge.
In 1691 the Hearth Tax records show that the mansion house had seven hearths and that seven other dwellings were associated with the estate.Urquhart, Page 105
Mr. J. Proven of Lochridge attended the famous 1839 Eglinton Tournament in what is now Eglinton Country Park and he was alloted a seat in the Grand Stand.Aikman, J & Gordon, W. (1839) An Account of the Tournament at Eglinton. Pub. Hugh Paton, Carver & Gilder. Edinburgh. M.DCCC.XXXIX.
It is stated locally that a Lochridge Halt existed on the railway at one time, but no evidence has yet been found to support this. The new junction on the doubled track from Stewarton to Lugton is officially known as 'Lochridge Junction'.[tpl]cite web |last=  |first= |authorlink=Scot-rail.co.uk|title=The Lugton Loop|publisher=|url=http://www.scot-rail.co.uk/page/Signalling:Lugton+Loop+2009|accessdate=2009-10-25[/tpl]
Wardhead, next to Lochridge, was farmed by Alexander Cameron and his spouse Janet Ingrwm in the early 18th. century. Alexander died on 5 April 1761 and Janet died on 20 May 1736, aged 50. They were both buried at the Laigh Kirk in Stewarton.
This was a dower house or factor's residence on the Lochridge Estate and was built around 1860. The older farmhouse building may be incorporated at the back. An old walled garden was later used as a car park.[ref]Davis, page 397 It is now the site of Provan Engineering that manufactures wind turbines.

The Draffen Stone used to be located in a field near the house of the same name. Due to a housing development it has been moved to a site in front of Draffen House. It is not known whether this stone is merely a 'rubbing stone' for cattle or a menhir.  It is not recorded by Historic Scotland.

The course of the drive was altered when the railway was built in the 1840.
