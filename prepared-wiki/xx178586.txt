Badsworth Boy (1975–2002) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse. He completed a hat-trick from 1983-1985 in the Queen Mother Champion Chase. In so doing, he also became a winner for all three members of the Dickinson family as Tony, Michael and Monica all trained him in their turn, and he became the 12th horse in jumping history to pass the £100,000 earnings mark. In all, he claimed victory eight times over hurdles and eighteen times over fences, in spite of the fact that his very fast jumping sometimes led to disaster. In the first of his three Champion Chase triumphs, Badsworth Boy won by a distance from Artifice, with his stablemate and favourite Rathgorman - the 1982 winner - well behind. In 1984, he had ten lengths to spare over Little Bay, and in his final success, he finished the same distance in front of Far Bridge. His final trip into the winner's circle came in January 1987.
Badsworth Boy died of a heart attack at age twenty-seven in October 2002.
