[[Atmospheric entry]]

CATEGORIES: Spaceflight, Space technology, Flight phases

Atmospheric entry is the movement of an object into and through the gases of a planet's atmosphere from outer space. There are two main types of atmospheric entry - uncontrolled entry, such as in the entry of celestial objects, space debris or bolides - and controlled entry, such as the entry (or reentry) of technology capable of being navigated or following a predetermined course.
Atmospheric drag and aerodynamic heating can cause atmospheric breakup capable of completely disintegrating smaller objects. These forces may cause objects with lower compressive strength to explode.
For Earth, atmospheric entry occurs above the Kármán Line at an altitude of more than 100 km above the surface while Venus atmospheric entry occurs at 250 km and Mars atmospheric entry at about 80 km. Uncontrolled, objects accelerate through the atmosphere at extreme velocities under the influence of Earth's gravity. Most controlled objects enter at hypersonic speeds due to their suborbital (e.g. ICBM reentry vehicles), orbital (e.g. the Space Shuttle), or unbounded (e.g. meteors) trajectories.   Various advanced technologies have been developed to enable atmospheric reentry and flight at extreme velocities. An alternative, low velocity, method of controlled atmospheric entry is buoyancyhttp://www.jpaerospace.com/atohandout.pdf which is suitable for planetary entry where thick atmospheres, strong gravity or both factors complicates high-velocity hyperbolic entry, such as the atmospheres of Venus, Titan and the gas giants.http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1965-1407

==History==

The concept of the ablative heat shield was described as early as 1920 by Robert Goddard: "In the case of meteors, which enter the atmosphere with speeds as high as 30 miles per second, the interior of the meteors remains cold, and the erosion is due, to a large extent, to chipping or cracking of the suddenly heated surface. For this reason, if the outer surface of the apparatus were to consist of layers of a very infusible hard substance with layers of a poor heat conductor between, the surface would not be eroded to any considerable extent, especially as the velocity of the apparatus would not be nearly so great as that of the average meteor."[tpl]cite web|last=Goddard|first=Robert H.|title=Report Concerning Further Developments|date=Mar 1920|url= http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/documents/goddardmarch1920.htm|publisher=The Smithsonian Institution Archives|accessdate= 2009-06-29|quote=In the case of meteors, which enter the atmosphere with speeds as high as 30 miles per second, the interior of the meteors remains cold, and the erosion is due, to a large extent, to chipping or cracking of the suddenly heated surface.

Practical development of reentry systems began as the range and reentry velocity of ballistic missiles increased. For early short-range missiles, like the V-2, stabilization and aerodynamic stress were important issues (many V-2s broke apart during reentry), but heating was not a serious problem. Medium-range missiles like the Soviet R-5, with a 1200 km range, required ceramic composite heat shielding on separable reentry vehicles (it was no longer possible for the entire rocket structure to survive reentry). The first ICBMs, with ranges of 8000 to 12,000 km, were only possible with the development of modern ablative heat shields and blunt-shaped vehicles.  In the USA, this technology was pioneered by H. Julian Allen at Ames Research Center.Boris Chertok, "Rockets and People", NASA History Series, 2006

==Terminology, definitions and jargon==

Over the decades since the 1950s, a rich technical jargon has grown around the engineering of vehicles designed to enter planetary atmospheres.  It is recommended that the reader review the jargon glossary before continuing with this article on atmospheric reentry.

==Blunt body entry vehicles==

These four shadowgraph images represent early reentry-vehicle concepts. A shadowgraph is a process that makes visible the disturbances that occur in a fluid flow at high velocity, in which light passing through a flowing fluid is refracted by the density gradients in the fluid resulting in bright and dark areas on a screen placed behind the fluid.
In the United States, H. Julian Allen and A. J. Eggers, Jr. of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) made the counterintuitive discovery in 1951[ref]
