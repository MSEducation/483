===Procedures and techniques===

The procedures of documentation vary from one sector, or one type, to another. In general, these may involve document drafting, formatting, submitting, reviewing, approving, distributing, repositing and tracking, etc., and are convened by associated SOPs in a regulatory industry [ref]

==Producing documentation==

Technical writers and corporate communicators are professionals whose field and work is documentation. Ideally, technical writers have a background in both the subject matter and also in writing and managing content (information architecture). Technical writers more commonly collaborate with subject matter experts (SMEs), such as engineers, medical professionals, or other types of clients to define and then create content (documentation) that meets the user's needs. Corporate communications includes other types of written documentation that is required for most companies.

==Documentation in computer science==

The following are typical documentation types
Documentation include such as feasibility report, technical documentation, operational documentation, log book and etc. 

===Tools for documenting software===

There are many types of software and applications used to create documentation.
SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION FOLDER (SDF)
A common type of software document written by software engineers in the simulation industry is the SDF. When developing software for a simulator, which can range from embedded avionics devices to 3D terrain databases by way of full motion control systems, the engineer keeps a notebook detailing the development "the build" of the project or module. The document can be a wiki page, MS word document or other environment.  They should contain a requirements section, an interface section to detail the communication interface of the software.  Often a notes section is used to detail the proof of concept, and then track errors and enhancements. Finally, a testing section to document how the software was tested.  This documents conformance to the client's requirements. The result is a detailed description of how the software is designed, how to build and install the software on the target device, and any known defects and work-arounds. This build document enables future developers and maintainers to come up to speed on the software in a timely manner, and also provides a roadmap to modifying code or searching for bugs.

==Documentation in criminal justice==

"Documentation" is the preferred term for the process of populating criminal databases.  Examples include the National Counterterrorism Center's Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment ("TIDE"), sex offender registries, and gang databases.[tpl]cite journal|last=Rader Brown|first=Rebecca|title=The Gang's All Here: Evaluating the Need for a National Gang Database|journal=Columbia Journal of Law and Social Problems|year=2009|volume=42|pages=293â€“333[/tpl]
