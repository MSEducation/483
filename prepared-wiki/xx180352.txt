John Cathles Hill (1857 – 5 April 1915) was an architect and property developer who was born in Hawkshill, part of Dundee. When he was three years old his family moved to the village Auchterhouse in Angus County (now Tayside). His father was toll booth keeper of Auchterhouse which he combined with working as a cartwright and joiner.Hill Archive Guide, University of East Anglia, Bridget Gillies, October 2006.
When Hill was seventeen he left home and became a self-employed journeyman carpenter and joiner. After two years he settled in Glasgow where he attended the Mechanics' Institute. There he learned the principles of architecture and construction. At the age of 21 he moved to London. After quickly establishing himself as a joiner, Hill was able to set up his own joinery business within a year. His business was successful and it was not long before he was exploiting the suburban building boom and building houses.Dictionary of Business Biography: Biographical Dictionary of Business Leaders Active in Britain in the Period 1860-1980, Vol III, David J. Jeremy (Ed.), Butterworths,1984, ISBN 978-0-406-27342-0 By 1881 he was described as a "builder employing 8 men".Dictionary of Scottish Architects 1840-1940 His first offices were established in Archway, London.
Hill became a prolific developer-architect in North London. Records indicate that he was responsible for building 2,397 houses in or near London and in the neighbourhood of Peterborough. He focussed on suburban communities for the middle classes complete with houses, shops and pubs. In the 1890s he built up a good part of Harringay, North London. In addition to a few streets of terraced houses to the east of Green Lanes, the development also included a magnificent terrace of shops, Grand Parade, and a vast ornate public house, The Salisbury. He is also credited with large developments in Crouch End including the Grade II* listed Queens pub in Crouch End (and is also in CAMRA's National inventory),"London Heritage Pubs - An inside story", G. Brandwood & J. Jephcote, CAMRA (2008), ISBN 978-1-85249-247-2 the Broadway Parade on the western side of Crouch End Broadway and the Rathcole estate.
As a developer Hill experienced a shortage of bricks. He resolved this problem by acquiring a brickfield at Fletton in 1889. This eventually became the London Brick Company. At his Fletton works, he built a huge kiln, called 'Napoleon' which was the biggest in the world.This article has relied heavily on [tpl]cite book|last = Schwitzer |first=Joan|title=A London Developer: John Cathles Hill, 1857 - 1915'', Hornsey Historical Society Bulletin, 40|publisher=Hornsey Historical Society|year=2002[/tpl] (issn: 0955 8071)
Hill also owned a chain of five off-licences in north London. When his businesses ran into trouble, these five were taken over by his cousin William Cathles and some survived till the middle of the Twentieth century.
When he first moved to London Hill was recorded as living at 9 Albert Road, Tottenham, Middlesex. In 1882 he married a grocer’s daughter, Matilda Mose and by 1890 they had moved to Highgate, at the top of Whitehall Park. Four years later, success enabled a further move to a pseudo-gothic mansion called Southwood Hall in Highgate.Hampstead & Highgate Directory, 1895  
It is likely that by the middle of the first decade of the 20th century, his business was not succeeding as it had before. In 1905 the family moved out of Southwood and into a mansion flat in Hornsey Gardens, albeit an elegant one. In 1912 Hill was declared bankrupt with a deficit of over one million pounds.
In 1910 Hill founded a national association of brick manufacturers to try and tackle the trade's endemic competition which had been threatening its ruin. He was a local councillor both in Fletton  and served on the London County Council from 1910.
Hill died of a heart attack on 5 April 1915 and is buried at Highgate Cemetery, London.
