[[Isomorphism theorem]]

CATEGORIES: Isomorphism theorems

In mathematics, specifically abstract algebra, the isomorphism theorems are three theorems that describe the relationship between quotients, homomorphisms, and subobjects.  Versions of the theorems exist for groups, rings, vector spaces, modules, Lie algebras, and various other algebraic structures.  In universal algebra, the isomorphism theorems can be generalized to the context of algebras and congruences.

==History==

The isomorphism theorems were formulated in some generality for homomorphisms of modules by Emmy Noether in her paper Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern which was published in 1927 in Mathematische Annalen.  Less general versions of these theorems can be found in work of Richard Dedekind and previous papers by Noether.
Three years later, B.L. van der Waerden published his influential Algebra, the first abstract algebra textbook that took the groups-rings-fields approach to the subject. Van der Waerden credited lectures by Noether on group theory and Emil Artin on algebra, as well as a seminar conducted by Artin, Wilhelm Blaschke, Otto Schreier, and van der Waerden himself on ideals as the main references. The three isomorphism theorems, called homomorphism theorem, and two laws of isomorphism when applied to groups, appear explicitly.

==Groups==

We first state the three isomorphism theorems in the context of groups. Note that some sources switch the numbering of the second and third theorems.Jacobson (2009), p. 101, use "first" for the isomorphism of the modules (S + T) / T and S / (S ∩ T), and "second" for (M / T) / (S / T) and M / S. Sometimes the  lattice theorem is referred to as the fourth isomorphism theorem or the correspondence theorem.

===Statement of the theorems===

====First isomorphism theorem====

Let G and H be groups, and let φ: G → H be a homomorphism.  Then:
In particular, if φ is surjective then H is isomorphic to G / ker(φ).

====Second isomorphism theorem====

Let G be a group.  Let S be a subgroup of G, and let N be a normal subgroup of G.  Then:
Technically, it is not necessary for N to be a normal subgroup, as long as S is a subgroup of the normalizer of N.  In this case, the intersection S ∩ N is not a normal subgroup of G, but it is still a normal subgroup of S.

====Third isomorphism theorem====

Let G be a group.  Let N and K be normal subgroups of G, with
Then

===Discussion===

In the second isomorphism theorem, the product SN is the join of S and N in the lattice of subgroups of G, while the intersection S ∩ N is the meet.
The third isomorphism theorem is generalized by the nine lemma to abelian categories and more general maps between objects.  It is sometimes informally called the "freshman theorem", because "even a freshman could figure it out: just cancel out the Ks!"

==Rings==

The statements of the theorems for rings are similar, with the notion of a normal subgroup replaced by the notion of an ideal.

===First isomorphism theorem===

Let R and S be rings, and let φ: R → S be a ring homomorphism.  Then:
In particular, if φ is surjective then S is isomorphic to R / ker(φ).

===Second isomorphism theorem===

Let R be a ring.  Let S be a subring of R, and let I be an ideal of R.  Then:

===Third isomorphism theorem===

Let R be a ring.  Let A and B be ideals of R, with
Then

==Modules==

The statements of the isomorphism theorems for modules are particularly simple, since it is possible to form a quotient module from any submodule.  The isomorphism theorems for vector spaces and abelian groups are special cases of these.  For vector spaces, all of these theorems follow from the rank-nullity theorem.
For all of the following theorems, the word “module” will mean “R-module”, where R is some fixed ring.

===First isomorphism theorem===

Let M and N be modules, and let φ: M → N be a homomorphism.  Then:
In particular, if φ is surjective then N is isomorphic to M / ker(φ).

===Second isomorphism theorem===

Let M be a module, and let S and T be submodules of M.  Then:

===Third isomorphism theorem===

Let M be a module.  Let S and T be submodules of M, with
Then

==General==

To generalise this to universal algebra, normal subgroups need to be replaced by congruences.
