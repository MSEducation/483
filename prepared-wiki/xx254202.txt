The UK Singles Chart is a record chart compiled by The Official Charts Company (OCC) on behalf of the British record industry. The chart week runs from Sunday to Saturday, with the top 40 singles being broadcast on BBC Radio 1's Chart Show each Sunday. Until the end of 2004 the chart was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets, at which point legal music downloads were included in the compilation of the chart.[tpl]cite book|title=Guinness World Records: British Hit Singles and Albums (18th edition)|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2005|isbn=1-904994-00-8|pages=14|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited[/tpl]
