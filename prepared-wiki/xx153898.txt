The Progressive Democratic Party, ([tpl]lang-th|ประชาธิปไตยก้าวหน้า[/tpl], Prachathipatai Kao Na) is a minor political party in Thailand that was dissolved. It was founded on March 5, 2005, and had about 11.000 members at its peak. On May 30, 2007 its dissolution was ordered by the Constitutional Court, as the party had falsified membership records of their candidates for the 2006 election in Trang Province.[tpl]cite news|title=Progressive Democratic Party to be disbanded|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/05/31/headlines/headlines_30035631.php|date=2007-05-31|publisher=The Nation[/tpl]
