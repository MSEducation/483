CATEGORIES: Samsung mobile phones

The Samsung SGH-U600 is a mobile phone manufactured in Korea by Samsung and is part of the Ultra Edition II series of Samsung phones. One of its main features are the call and select buttons, which are touch-sensitive instead of physical buttons.

==Features==

The phone has features including:

===Slider settings===

The slider can be configured to accept and close calls, as well as to close all open applications (except the MP3 player when settings are set properly). (These are the only settings).
Settings are available which allow for the phone to stay unlocked when closed. This is also the first Samsung phone that provides the availability to use MP3 files as SMS message tones.

===MM3 ringtones===

In some firmware versions, the first 1.5 seconds (approx.) of an MP3 ringtone is cut off. This can be circumvented by inserting 1.5 seconds of silence in the beginning of the audio file, using a digital audio editor.

===Video playback and conversion===

Full length movies can be converted by using Samsung PC Studio which comes with the phone.
Mencoder can also be used with this command line to convert file inputName.flv (or any other video type) to outputName.mp4:
 mencoder -oac lavc -ovc lavc -of lavf -lavcopts aglobal=1:vglobal=1:vcodec=mpeg4:acodec=libfaac:vbitrate=256:abitrate=64 -lavfopts format=mp4 -ofps 15 -vf scale=320:240,harddup -o outputName.mp4 inputName.flv 
While recording you cannot pause the video in this phone. The output framerate of the video is 8 frame/s.
