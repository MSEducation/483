CATEGORIES: Former local government areas of Victoria (Australia)

The City of Doncaster & Templestowe was a local government area located about [tpl]convert|20|km|mi|0[/tpl] east-northeast of Melbourne, the state capital of Victoria, Australia. The city covered an area of [tpl]convert|89.42|km2|sqmi|2[/tpl], and existed from 1915 until 1994. At its peak in the early 1990s, it had a population of just over 100,000.

==History==

The origin of local government in the area dates back to 19 December 1856, when the Templestowe Road District was formed, following a public meeting and election at Bulleen Hotel.[tpl]Cite book| title=Doncaster Templestowe & Warrandyte since 1837  | year= 1970| publisher=Doncaster-Templestowe Historical Society | isbn= 0-9500920-0-2[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/default.asp |title= Templestowe I (Roads Board 1856-1875) Agency VA 4760  |accessdate=2008-01-05 |publisher=Public Record Office Victoria[/tpl] Two decades later, on 7 May 1875, the Shire of Bulleen was formed, incorporating the Roads Board area and Warrandyte.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.prov.vic.gov.au/default.asp |title= Bulleen (Shire 1875 - 1892)   Agency VA 4358  |accessdate=2008-01-05 |publisher=Public Record Office Victoria[/tpl] On 30 May 1890, the Doncaster Riding was severed and incorporated as the Shire of Doncaster, meeting in the old Shire Hall in Council Street. By this time, fruit growing had become the mainstay of Doncaster's rural economy. The Shire of Bulleen was renamed to the Shire of Templestowe on 12 May 1892 and reunited with Doncaster 23 years later under local government reforms on 1 October 1915, with the combined entity named the Shire of Doncaster & Templestowe on 16 March 1926. Urbanisation was slow to reach the area, and the 1949 Australian Blue Book described the shire as "mainly undulating country with extensive views and some low, hilly ranges". Agricultural activities, such as fruit growing, dairying and sheep and cattle grazing, dominated the shire's economic life.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.arts.monash.edu.au/ncas/multimedia/gazetteer/list/donc+tempstwe.html|title=Australian Places - Doncaster & Templestowe|author=Monash University|year=1999|accessdate=2008-01-04|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021103011835/http://www.arts.monash.edu.au/ncas/multimedia/gazetteer/list/donc+tempstwe.html|archivedate=3 November 2002[/tpl] By 1955 the population of the area had grown with suburban settlement and a new Shire Hall was built. On 28 February 1967, at a time of rapid suburban growth, Doncaster & Templestowe was proclaimed a City.[tpl]Cite book|title=Victorian Municipal Directory|year=1992|publisher=Arnall & Jackson|location=Brunswick|pages=314â€“315[/tpl] Also VMD 1915:612.
