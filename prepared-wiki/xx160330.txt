The International Student Film and Video Festival is the first international festival in Slovenia, the focal point of which is student film and video production. It takes place annually at the Faculty of Arts, University of Ljubljana, since 2006. The festival is organized by the students of the faculty in cooperation with the Educational Centre of Radio-Television Slovenia.
Along with its primary role as a film festival, the International Student Film and Video Festival Filofest is accompanied by additional programme in the form of lectures, panel discussions, exhibitions, social gatherings and other events.
The competition part of the programme is open exclusively to independent student films, whose authors are amateurs without formal film education.  Films directed by students of film academies or film schools are screened within the non-competition part of the programme. The festival accepts fiction, documentary, animated and experimental films.
