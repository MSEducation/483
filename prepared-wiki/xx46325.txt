CATEGORIES: German idealism, German philosophy, German romantic painters, Romanticism, 19th-century German literature

In the philosophy, art, and culture of German-speaking countries, German Romanticism was the dominant  movement of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. German Romanticism developed relatively late compared to its English counterpart, coinciding in its early years with the movement known as German Classicism or Weimar Classicism.  In contrast to the seriousness of English Romanticism, the German variety is notable for valuing humor and wit as well as beauty.
The early German romantics tried to create a new synthesis of art, philosophy, and science, looking to the Middle Ages as a simpler, more integrated period.  As time went on, however, they became increasingly aware of the tenuousness of the unity they were seeking.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-232415/German-literature |title=German literature - Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2012-12-07 |accessdate=2014-01-13[/tpl]  Later German Romanticism emphasized the tension between the everyday world and the seemingly irrational and supernatural projections of creative genius.  Heinrich Heine in particular criticized the tendency of the early romantics to look to the medieval past for a model of unity in art and society.
