==England==

After he moved to England in 1993, Rancadore opened a travel agency with his wife.  While English authorities were aware that Rancadore was in London they were unable to arrest him because, unlike Italy, in England Mafia association is not a crime.[tpl]cite web | url=http://news.sky.com/story/1126058/mafia-boss-domenico-rancadore-held-in-london | title=Mafia Boss Domenico Rancadore Held In London | work=Sky News | date=8 August 2013 | accessdate=9 August 2013 | last=Pisa|first=Nick[/tpl] Italian authorities asked for his extradition to Italy in January 2012, which was denied by the British authorities.
