Lara Roxx was the stage name of a Montreal, Quebec-born Canadian, former pornographic actress who, in March 2004, became the first known individual in four years to contract HIV while making a US pornographic video.

==Career==

Roxx became famous in 2004 at age 21, after being exposed to HIV while doing a pornographic scene with Darren James. She allegedly contracted the disease just two months after doing her first scene, a double anal.[tpl]cite news | url=http://blogs.montrealgazette.com/2013/01/25/inside-lara-roxx-former-montreal-adult-film-star-on-the-deadly-price-of-porn-fame/ | title=Inside Lara Roxx: former Montreal adult-film star on the deadly price of porn fame | work=Montreal Gazette | date=January 25, 2013 | accessdate=January 26, 2013 | author=Burnett, Richard | authorlink=Richard Burnett[/tpl] Roxx said previously that she relied on the industry's HIV standards to ensure her safety.[tpl]cite web|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/15762.html|title=Lara Roxx: "I thought porn people were the cleanest people in the world."|work=Adult Video News|date=2004-04-17|accessdate=2009-02-08[/tpl]
James and Roxx have been banned from any further porn production in the US. At the end of April 2004, it was confirmed that Jessica Dee and Miss Arroyo, after having worked with James, also tested positive for HIV.[tpl]cite web|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/15987.html|title=Another First-Gen Woman Diagnosed as HIV-Positive|work=Adult Video News|date=2004-05-05|accessdate=2009-02-08[/tpl]
Roxx, on learning about James being HIV-positive, said, "It totally made me realize how I trusted this system that wasn't to be trusted at all, because it obviously doesn't work," and "I thought porn people were the cleanest people in the world."
This outbreak, the first in four years, led to a voluntary moratorium on porn production for 30 days (60 days was originally announced), starting in April 2004, while it confirmed all possible contacts among porn performers. No adult video production companies were required to comply.
Roxx appeared on Entertainment Tonight, in an ABC special. In 2007, on an episode of  The Maury Povich Show, she came on to talk to wild teens about her past, and to help them prevent making the mistakes she made in the past.
She is currently working on various projects linked to the 2004 events, such as her Lara Roxx Foundation, which is committed to educating the public and preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS. 
She is the subject of a Canadian documentary film entitled Inside Lara Roxx directed by Canadian filmmaker and photographer Mia Donovan, which explores her 2004 HIV infection and her life since the media coverage of this incident subsided.
