A Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God in the Conversion of Many Hundred Souls in Northampton is an essay written in 1737 by Jonathan Edwards about the process of Christian conversion in Northampton, Massachusetts during the Great Awakening, which emanated from Edwards' congregation in 1734.

==Analysis==

Edwards wrote the Narrative to dispel rumors and to clarify how conversion to Christianity occurs. Edwards gives a background of the town and its relatively mundane history prior to the Awakening of 1734.
In the book, Edwards describes God's grace by using examples of various people from his local congregation, such as Abigail Hutchinson, a young woman who died joyfully. These examples illustrate the psychology of conversion by grace. He outlines several universal steps in conversion:

==History and impact==

Edwards published the "Narrative" in England in 1737, Boston in 1738, and later in German and Dutch, and it brought him a large international following.  Prominent Christians such as George Whitefield, a British minister, came to visit Edwards in Northhampton after the publication.
The "Narrative" remains popular and modern day evangelists such as Timothy Keller often refer to this and other Edwards works as models for their ministry.[tpl]citation|last=Keller|first=Timothy|authorlink=Timothy J.
