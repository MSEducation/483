The Solomon Islands national rugby union team represent Solomon Islands in the sport of rugby union.
They played their first international at 18 August 1969, losing to Papua New Guinea by 23-5. Their next game, three days later, with Fiji show their record loss of 113-13. Both games were part of the 3rd South Pacific Games. Since then they have played in only a small number of internationals. Their first win came in 1983, in a 19-12 win over Niue, for the 7th South Pacific Games.
Solomon Islands have yet to qualify for the Rugby World Cup finals, but did take part in the qualifying tournaments in Oceania for the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia, and the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, but did not end up qualifying.
