A building society is a financial institution owned by its members as a mutual organisation. Building societies offer banking and related financial services, especially mortgage lending. These institutions are found in the United Kingdom (UK) and several other countries.
The term "building society" first arose in the 18th century in Great Britain from cooperative savings groups. In the UK today, building societies actively compete with banks for most consumer banking services, especially mortgage lending and savings accounts.
Every building society in the UK is a member of the Building Societies Association. At the start of 2008, there were 59 building societies in the UK, with total assets exceeding £360 billion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bsa.org.uk |title=Building Societies Association |publisher=Bsa.org.uk |date= |accessdate=6 June 2012[/tpl] The number of societies in the UK fell by four during 2008 due to a series of mergers brought about, to a large extent, by the consequences of the financial crisis of 2007-2010. With three further mergers in each of 2009 and 2010, and a demutualisation and a merger in 2011, the current number of building societies is at 45.

==History==

The origins of the building society as an institution lie in late-18th century Birmingham – a town which was undergoing rapid economic and physical expansion driven by a multiplicity of small metalworking firms, whose many highly skilled and prosperous owners readily invested in property.[tpl]Cite book|last=Ashworth|first=Herbert|title=The Building Society Story|year=1980|publisher=Franey & Co.|location=London|isbn=0-900382-38-4|page=4[/tpl]; [tpl]Cite book|last=Berg|first=Maxine|editor=Berg, Maxine|title=Markets and Manufacture in Early Industrial Europe|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NfkNAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=7 September 2010|year=1991|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-03720-4|page=194|chapter=Commerce and Creativity in Eighteenth-Century Birmingham|chapterurl=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NfkNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA173[/tpl] Many of the early building societies were based in taverns or coffeehouses, which had become the focus for a network of clubs and societies for co-operation and the exchange of ideas among Birmingham's highly active citizenry as part of the movement known as the Midlands Enlightenment.[tpl]Cite book|last=Jones|first=Peter M.|title=Industrial Enlightenment: Science, technology and culture in Birmingham and the West Midlands, 1760–1820|year=2009|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=0-7190-7770-2|page=65[/tpl]; [tpl]Cite news|first=Carl|last=Chinn|title=Brum's building society origins|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Brum's+building+society+origins-a0188546654857|work=Strabane Mail|publisher=Birmingham Post and Mail Ltd.|date=15 November 2008|accessdate=6 September 1905[/tpl] The first building society to be established was Ketley's Building Society, founded by Richard Ketley, the landlord of the Golden Cross inn, in 1775.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bsa.org.uk/consumer/factsheets/100009.htm|title=The History of Building Societies|accessdate=6 September 2010|last=Rex|first=Simon|date=20 April 2010|publisher=Building Societies Association[/tpl]; [tpl]Cite book|last=Ashworth|first=Herbert|title=The Building Society Story|year=1980|publisher=Franey & Co.|location=London|isbn=0-900382-38-4|page=2[/tpl] Members of Ketley's society paid a monthly subscription to a central pool of funds which was used to finance the building of houses for members, which in turn acted as collateral to attract further funding to the society, enabling further construction.[tpl]Cite journal|last=Peterson|first=Christopher L.|date=October 1991|publisher=|title=Truth, Understanding, and High-Cost Consumer Credit: The Historical Context of the Truth in Lending Act|journal=Florida Law Review|issue=55|pages=839–840|url=|accessdate=6 September 2010[/tpl] By 1781 three more societies had been established in Birmingham, with a fourth in the nearby town of Dudley; and 19 more formed in Birmingham between 1782 and 1795.[tpl]Citation|last=Clark|first=Peter|year=2002|title=British Clubs and Societies 1580–1800: The Origins of an Associational World|publication-place=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=129|isbn=0-19-924843-5|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h18rP1hrNLQC&pg=PA129|accessdate=20 November 2010[/tpl] The first outside the English Midlands was established in Leeds in 1785.[tpl]Cite book|last=Cleary|first=E.

Most of the original societies were fully terminating, where they would be dissolved when all members had a house: the last of them, First Salisbury, was wound up in March 1980.[tpl]cite web|last=Rex|first=Simon|title=The History of Building Societies|url=http://www.bsa.org.uk/consumer/factsheets/100009.htm|publisher=Building Societies Association|accessdate=8 June 2010[/tpl] In the 1830s and 1840s a new development took place with the Permanent Building Society, where the society continued on a rolling basis, continually taking in new members as earlier ones completed purchases, such as Leek United Building Society. The main legislative framework for the Building Society was the Building Society Act of 1874, with subsequent amending legislation in 1894, 1939 (see Coney Hall), and 1960.
In their heyday, there were hundreds of building societies: just about every town in the country had a building society named after that town. Over succeeding decades the number of societies has decreased, as various societies merged to form larger ones, often renaming in the process, and other societies opted for demutualisation followed by – in the great majority of cases – eventual takeover by a listed bank. Most of the existing larger building societies are the end result of the mergers of many smaller societies.

===1980s and 1990s===

In the 1980s, British banking laws were changed to allow building societies to offer banking services equivalent to normal banks. The management of a number of societies still felt that they were unable to compete with the banks, and a new Building Societies Act was passed in 1986 in response to their concerns. This permitted societies to 'demutualise'. If more than 75% of members voted in favour, the building society would then become a limited company like any other. Members' mutual rights were exchanged for shares in this new company. A number of the larger societies made such proposals to their members and all were accepted. Some became independent companies quoted on the London Stock Exchange, others were acquired by larger financial groups.
The process began with the demutualisation of the Abbey National building society in 1989. Then, from 1995 to late-1999, eight societies demutualised accounting for two-thirds of building societies assets as at 1994. Five of these societies became joint stock banks (Plc), one merged with another and the other four were taken over by Plc's (in two cases after the mutual had previously converted to a Plc).
As Tayler (2003) refers, demutualisation moves succeeded immediately because neither Conservative nor Labour party UK Governments created a framework which put obstacles in the way of demutualisation. Political acquiescence in demutualisation was clearest in the case of the position on 'carpet baggers', that is those who joined societies by lodging minimum amounts of £100 or so in the hope of profiting from a distribution of surplus after demutualisation. The deregulating 1986 Building Societies Act contained an anti-carpet bagger provision in the form of a two-year rule. This prescribed a qualifying period of two years before savers could participate in a residual claim. But, before the 1989 Abbey National Building Society demutualisation, the Courts found against the two-year rule after legal action brought by Abbey National itself to circumvent the intent of the legislators. After this the legislation did prevent a cash distribution to members of less than two years standing, but the same result was obtained by permitting the issue of 'free' shares in the acquiring Plc, saleable for cash. The Thatcher Conservative government declined to introduce amending legislation to make good the defect in the 'two-year rule'.
Building societies, like mutual life insurers, arose as people clubbed together to address a common need interest; in the case of the building societies, this was housing and members were originally both savers and borrowers. But it very quickly became clear that 'outsider' savers were needed whose motive was profit through interest on deposits. Thus permanent building societies quickly became mortgage banks and in such institutions there always existed a conflict of interest between borrowers and savers. It was the task of the movement to reconcile that conflict of interest so as to enable savers to conclude that their interests and those of borrowers were to some extent complementary rather than conflictive. Conflict of interest between savers and borrowers was never fully reconciled in the building societies but upon deregulation that reconciliation became something of a lost cause. The management of building societies apparently could expend considerable time and resources (which belonged the organisation) planning their effective capture—of as much of the assets as they could. If so, this is arguably insider dealing on a grand scale with the benefit of inside specialist knowledge of the business and resources of the firm not shared with outsiders like politicians and members (and, perhaps, regulators). Once the opportunity to claim was presented by management the savers in particular could be relied upon to seize it. There were sufficient hard up borrowers to take the inducement offered them by management (in spite of few simple sums sufficing to demonstrate that they were probably going to end up effectively paying back the inducement). (Tayler 2003)
Managements promoting demutualisation also thereby met managerial objectives because the end of mutuality brought joint stock company (Plc) style remuneration committee pay standards and share options. Share options for management of converting societies appear to be a powerful factor in management calculation. Rasmusen (1988) refers to this in the following terms:
" ... perks do not rise in proportion to mutual bank size. If a mutual is large, or is expected to grow if it can raise capital by a conversion, its managers derive more value from a conversion but do not suffer much loss of perks than if the bank were small. Their benefit is in the right to purchase the new stock, which are valuable because the new issues are consistently underpriced to USA mutual bank conversions. Moreover, by no means are all mutual managers incompetent, and conversions allows the bank to expand more easily and to grant executive stock options that are valuable to skilled managers".
Instead of deploying their margin advantage as a defence of mutuality, around 1980 building societies began setting mortgage rates with reference to market clearing levels. In sum they began behaving more like banks, seeking to maximise profit instead of the advantages of a mutual organisation. Thus, according to the Bank of England's Boxall and Gallagher (1997), "... there was virtually no difference between banks and building society 'listed' interest rates for home finance mortgage lending between 1984 and 1997. This behaviour resulted in a return on assets for building societies which was at least as high as Plc banks and, in the absence of distribution, led to rapid accumulation of reserves". As Boxall and Gallagher (1997) also observe; "... accumulation of reserves in the early-1990's, beyond regulatory and future growth requirements, is difficult to reconcile with conventional theories of mutual behaviour".
Llewellyn (1996) draws a rather more direct and cynical conclusion;
"By adopting a policy of building up reserves by maintaining an excess margin, building societies simultaneously allowed banks to compete and may have undermined the long run viability of mutuality. A more cynical approach is that some societies may have adopted an excess-margin strategy simply to enhance their value for conversion".
Some of these managements ended up in dispute with their own members. Of the first major conversion of the Abbey in 1989, Kay (1991) observed;
" ... the paradox of the Abbey members who campaigned against flotation to a Plc bank of their building society. They were fighting to preserve a degree of accountability to the membership which the management of the Society patently did not feel. For incumbent management, the contrary views of some of their members were not matters to be weighed in the balance and taken account of in formulation of policy. They were a nuisance to be dealt with by the costly use of public relations advisers and legal processes".
In the end, after a number of large demutualisations, and pressure from carpetbaggers moving from one building society to another to cream off the windfalls, most of the remaining societies modified their rules of membership in the late 1990s. The method usually adopted were membership rules to ensure that anyone newly joining a society would, for the first few years, be unable to get any profit out of a demutualisation. With the chance of a quick profit removed, the wave of demutualisations came to an end in 2000.
One academic study (Heffernan, 2003) found that demutualised societies' pricing behaviour on deposits and mortgages was more favourable to shareholders than to customers, with the remaining mutual building societies offering consistently better rates.[tpl]cite web| title = The Effect of UK Building Society Conversion on Pricing Behaviour (March 2003) | author = Shelagh Heffernan | publisher = Faculty of Finance, CASS Business School, City of London | url = http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/facfin/papers/WP2003/Mutuals-WP.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 10 October 2007 [/tpl]

===2000s and 2010s===

The Butterfill Act was passed in 2007 giving building societies greater powers to merge with other companies. These powers have been used by the Britannia in 2009 and Kent Reliance in 2011 leading to their demutualisation.
Prior to 31 December 2010, deposits with building societies of up to £50,000 per individual, per institution, were normally protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), but Nationwide and Yorkshire Building Societies negotiated a temporary change to the terms of the FSCS to protect members of the societies they acquired in late 2008/early 2009. The amended terms allowed former members of multiple societies which merge into one to maintain multiple entitlements to FSCS protection until 30 September 2009 (later extended to 30 December 2010), so (for example) a member with £50,000 in each of Nationwide, Cheshire and Derbyshire at the time of the respective mergers would retain £150,000 of FSCS protection for their funds in the merged Nationwide.http://www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk/news/product/bs_merger_compensation.html On 31 December 2010 the general FSCS limit for retail deposits was increased to £85,000 for banks and building societies and the transitional arrangements in respect of building society mergers came to an end.

==List of building societies==

===United Kingdom===

====Current====

The remaining building societies are:
(Total group assets of building societies) Source: Building Societies Association updated for subsequent mergers and the administration of Dunfermline Building Society

====Demutualised====

Ten building societies of the United Kingdom demutualised between 1989 and 2000, either becoming a bank or being acquired by a larger bank.Building Society Takeovers and Flotations Building Societies Association website . Retrieved 5 April 2007. By 2008, every building society that floated on the stock market in the wave of demutualisations of the 1980s and 1990s had either been sold to a conventional bank, or been nationalised.

====No longer exist====

The following is an incomplete list of building societies in the United Kingdom that no longer exist independently, since they either merged with or were taken over by other building societies or mutuals.Building Society Mergers and Conversions since 1980 Building Societies Association website . Retrieved 5 April 2007. However, they may still have an active presence on the high street (or online) as a trading name or as a distinct brand. This is typically because brands will often build up specific reputations and attract certain clientele, and this can continue to be marketed successfully. 

===Australia===

In Australia, building societies evolved along British lines. Because of strict regulations on banks, building societies flourished until the deregulation of the Australian financial industry in the 1980s. Eventually many of the smaller building societies disappeared, while some of the largest (such as St. George) officially attained the status of banks.
A particular difference between Australian building societies and those elsewhere, is that Australian building societies are required to incorporate as limited companies.
Current building societies are

===Ireland===

The Republic of Ireland had around 40 building societies at the mid-20th century peak.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ibf.ie/Libraries/Guides_Forms/bsnames_1.sflb.ashx |title=List of Building Society Changes |publisher=Irish Banking Federation |date= |accessdate=25 April 2013[/tpl] Many of these were very small and, as the Irish commercial banks began to originate residential mortgages, the small building societies ceased to be competitive. Most merged or dissolved or, in the case of First Active plc, converted into conventional banks. The last remaining building societies, EBS Building Society and Irish Nationwide Building Society, demutualised and were transferred or acquired into Bank subsidiaries in 2011 following the effects of the 2008–2011 Irish financial crisis.
Leeds Building Society Ireland and Nationwide UK (Ireland) are Irish branches of building societies based in the United Kingdom.

====Society closures====

===Jamaica===

In Jamaica, four building societies compete with commercial banks and credit unions for most consumer financial services.

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand, a number of building societies were established. Some, including Countrywide Building Society and United Building Society, became banks in the 1980s and 1990s. Remaining building societies include:
Registration as a building society in the past where largely a formality.  Nowadays the Registrar of Building Societies seeks that every Building Society has minimum subscribed members with full paid-up capital no less the NZD 200,000 also makes sure all its members fully registered with all companies that are members must not be dormant.  All member companies must have their annual returns lodged, the  registrar’s assessment of any new or old new entity will be based on its compliance with the registrars rules,  The financial soundness of every Building Society must have independent Audited accounts so that the public my assess the risk of dealing with such an institution, as if a part of the registration compliance under the building societies act of 1965.

===Zimbabwe===

In Zimbabwe, Central Africa Building Society (CABS) is the leading building society offering a diverse range of financial products and services that include transaction and savings accounts, mobile banking, mortgage loans, money market investments, term deposits and pay-roll loans.

==Similar organisations in other countries==

In other countries there are mutual organisations similar to building societies:

==Operational differences from banks==

Because most building societies were not direct members of the UK clearing system, it was common for them to use a roll number to identify accounts rather than to allocate a six-digit sort-code and eight-digit account number to the BACS standards.
More recently, building societies have tended to obtain sort-code and account number allocations within the clearing system, and hence the use of roll numbers has diminished. When using BACS, one needs to enter roll numbers for the reference field and the building society's generic sort code and account number would be entered in the standard BACS fields.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.experianpayments.com/glossary/roll-number.html |title=Roll Number |publisher= Experianpayments.com [/tpl]
