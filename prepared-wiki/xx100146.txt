The department's annual budget is £350 million; it has 3,500 staff, 2,000 of whom are journalists. Through the BBC English Regions, BBC News has regional centres across England as well as national news centres in Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. All regions and nations produce their own local news programmes and other current affairs and sport programmes.
Radio and television operations are currently broadcast from the newly refurbished Broadcasting House, with all domestic, global, and online news divisions housed in Europe's largest live newsroom inside the building. Parliamentary coverage is produced and broadcast from studios in Millbank in London.The BBC's Millbank Studios are also a fall-back for news operations in the event of TVC[tpl]clarify|date=September 2011[/tpl] failure, and continually record the last hour of BBC News Channel output (less in-vision clock) for this purpose.
The BBC is a quasi-autonomous corporation authorised by Royal Charter, making it formally independent of government, and required to report impartially. It has been accused of political bias from across the political spectrum. Internationally, the BBC has been banned from reporting from within some countries which accuse the corporation of working to destabilise their governments.
In 2004, the BBC celebrated 50 years of television news broadcasts. BBC News journalists, cameramen, and programmes have won awards over the years for reporting, particularly from the Royal Television Society. The BBC founded the BBC College of Journalism in 2005 as a part of the BBC Academy, following recommendations made after the Hutton Report.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/journalism/about-us/about-the-college/what-we-offer.shtml |title=What is the college? |author=BBC |date= |work=|publisher=BBC Online |accessdate=28 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100727072915/http://www.bbc.co.uk/journalism/about-us/about-the-college/what-we-offer.shtml| archivedate= 27 July 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

The public's interest in television and live events was stimulated by Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953. It is estimated that up to 27 million people[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvhistory.btinternet.co.uk/html/landmark.html|title=British TV Landmark Dates|accessdate=3 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070506033602/http://www.tvhistory.btinternet.co.uk/html/landmark.html| archivedate= 6 May 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] viewed the programme in the UK, overtaking radio's audience of 12 million for the first time.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/Chronomedia/years/1953.htm |title=Chronomedia: 1953 |accessdate=3 April 2007[/tpl] Those live pictures were fed from 21 cameras in central London to Alexandra Palace for transmission, and then on to other UK transmitters opened in time for the event.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thevalvepage.com/tvyears/articals/coronation/arrangements/arrangements.htm |title=1950 |accessdate=3 April 2007[/tpl] That year, there were around two million TV Licences held in the UK, rising to over three million the following year and four and a half million by 1955.

===1950s===

Television news, although physically separate from its radio counterpart, was still firmly under its control– correspondents provided reports for both outlets–and that first bulletin, shown on 5 July 1954 on the then BBC television service and presented by Richard Baker, involved his providing narration off-screen while stills were shown.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/5/newsid_3856000/3856397.stm |title=BBC launches daily TV news |accessdate=9 April 2010 |work=BBC News |date=5 July 1954[/tpl] This was then followed by the customary Television Newsreel with a recorded commentary by John Snagge (and on other occasions by Andrew Timothy).
It was revealed that this had been due to producers fearing a newsreader with visible facial movements would distract the viewer from the story. On-screen newsreaders were finally introduced a year later in 1955 – Kenneth Kendall (the first to appear in vision), Robert Dougall, and Richard Baker–three weeks before ITN's launch on 21 September 1955.
Mainstream television production had started to move out of Alexandra Palace in 1950[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/Chronomedia/years/1950.htm|title=Chronomedia: 1950|accessdate=8 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071016210036/http://terramedia.co.uk/Chronomedia/years/1950.htm| archivedate= 16 October 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] to larger premises – mainly at Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd's Bush, west London – taking Current Affairs (then known as Talks Department) with it, and it was from here that the first Panorama, a new documentary programme, was transmitted on 11 November 1953, with Richard Dimbleby becoming anchor in 1955.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/08/programmes_past_faces_of_panorama/html/1.stm|title=In pictures: Past Faces of Panorama|accessdate=9 April 2010 | work=BBC News[/tpl] On 18 February 1957, the topical early-evening programme Tonight hosted by Cliff Michelmore and designed to fill the airtime provided by the abolition of the Toddlers' Truce, was broadcast from Marconi's Viking Studio in St Mary Abbott's Place, Kensington – with the programme moving into a Lime Grove studio in 1960, where it already maintained its production office.
On 28 October 1957, the Today programme a morning radio programme was launched in central London on the Home Service.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/about_today/default.stm|title=About Today|accessdate=9 April 2010 | work=BBC News | date=6 June 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100401050803/http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/about_today/default.stm| archivedate= 1 April 2010 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
In 1958, Hugh Carleton Greene became head of News and Current Affairs. He set up a BBC study group whose findings, published in 1959, were critical of what the television news operation had become under his predecessor, Tahu Hole. The report proposed that the head of television news should take control (away from radio), and that the television service should have a proper newsroom of its own, with an editor-of-the-day.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-roger-lazar-1146847.html |title=Obituary: Roger Lazar |accessdate=9 April 2010 |work=The Independent |location=London |date=25 February 1998[/tpl]

===1960s===

On 1 January 1960, Greene became Director-General and brought about big changes at BBC Television and BBC Television News. BBC Television News had been created in 1955 in response to the founding of ITN. The changes made by Greene were aimed at making BBC reporting more similar to ITN which had been highly rated by study groups held by Greene.
A newsroom was created at Alexandra Palace, television reporters were recruited and given the opportunity to write and voice their own scripts–without the "impossible burden" of having to cover stories for radio too.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/aboutbbcnews/spl/hi/history/noflash/html/1950s.stm |title=About BBC NEWS – Timeline of events – 1950s |accessdate=11 April 2007 |work=BBC News[/tpl]
In 1987, almost thirty years later, John Birt, resurrected the practice of correspondents working for both TV and radio with the introduction of bi-media journalism,[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/newswatch/history/noflash/html/1980s.stm |title=About BBC NEWS – Timeline of events – 1980s |accessdate=25 August 2007 |work=BBC News[/tpl] and 2008 saw tri-media introduced across TV, radio, and online.

BBC2 started transmission on 20 April 1964, and with it came a new news programme for that channel, Newsroom.
The World at One, a lunchtime news programme, began on 4 October 1965 on the then Home Service, and the year before News Review had started on television. News Review was a summary of the week's news, first broadcast on Sunday, 26 April 1964[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/Chronomedia/years/1964.htm|title=Chronomedia: 1964|accessdate=3 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070303014530/http://www.terramedia.co.uk/Chronomedia/years/1964.htm| archivedate= 3 March 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] on BBC 2 and harking back to the weekly Newsreel Review of the Week, produced from 1951, to open programming on Sunday evenings–the difference being that this incarnation had subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing. As this was the decade before electronic caption generation, each superimposition ("super") had to be produced on paper or card, synchronised manually to studio and news footage, committed to tape during the afternoon, and broadcast early evening. Thus Sundays were no longer a quiet day for news at Alexandra Palace. The programme ran until the 1980s[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/bbcnews/bbcnationalnewsother.html|title=TV Ark: BBC News|accessdate=16 August 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070516061628/http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/bbcnews/bbcnationalnewsother.html  |archivedate = 16 May 2007[/tpl] – by then using electronic captions, known as Anchor – to be superseded by Ceefax subtitling (a similar Teletext format), and the signing of such programmes as See Hear (from 1981).
On Sunday 17 September 1967 The World This Weekend, a weekly news and current affairs programme, launched on what was then Home Service, but soon-to-be Radio 4.
Preparations for colour began in the autumn of 1967 and on Thursday 7 March 1968 Newsroom on BBC2 moved to an early evening slot, becoming the first UK news programme to be transmitted in colourHistory of the BBC – key dates page 5 BBC Heritage 1960s. – from Studio A at Alexandra Palace. News Review and Westminster (the latter a weekly review of Parliamentary happenings) were "colourised" shortly after.
However, much of the insert material was still in black and white, as initially only a part of the film coverage shot in and around London was on colour reversal film stock, and all regional and many international contributions were still in black and white. Colour facilities at Alexandra Palace were technically very limited for the next eighteen months, as it had only one RCA colour Quadruplex videotape machine and, eventually two Pye plumbicon colour telecines–although the news colour service started with just one.
Black and white national bulletins on BBC 1 continued to originate from Studio B on weekdays, along with Town and Around, the London regional "opt out" programme broadcast throughout the 1960s (and the BBC's first regional news programme for the South East), until it started to be replaced by Nationwide on Tuesday to Thursday from Lime Grove Studios early in September 1969. Town and Around was never to make the move to Television Centre – instead it became London This Week which transmitted on Mondays and Fridays only from the new TVC studios.London This Week had started in early 1969 as a once per week "opt out" replacing the Friday edition of Town and Around [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvradiobits.co.uk/news/southeast.htm|title=TV & Radio Bits: BBC South East: History|accessdate=21 June 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

====Television News moves to Television Centre====

The final news programme to come from Alexandra Palace was a late night news on BBC 2 on Friday 19 September 1969 in colour. It was said that over this September weekend, it took 65 removal vans to transfer the contents of Alexandra Palace across London.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bawdeswell.net/newsbob|title=Bob Taylor: 50 years of BBC Television News|accessdate=25 January 2009[/tpl] Bawdeswell.net BBC Television News resumed operations the next day with a lunchtime bulletin on BBC 1 – in black and white – from Television Centre, where it remained until March 2013.
This move to better technical facilities, but much smaller studios, allowed Newsroom and News Review to replace back projection with Colour-separation overlay. It also allowed all news output to be produced in PAL colour, ahead of the development in all of BBC 1 from 15 November 1969 – and, like Alexandra Palace Studio A, these studios too were capable of operating in NTSC for the US, Canada, and Japan as the BBC occasionally provided facilities for overseas broadcasters. During the 1960s satellite communication had become possible,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tvhistory.btinternet.co.uk/html/early_satellite.html|title=Early Satellite Broadcasts|archiveurl=http://archive.is/eZX2P|archivedate=27 October 2010[/tpl] 1960s & 70s, British TV History[tpl]dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot[/tpl] however colour field-store standards converters were still in their infancy in 19681968 – A new field store converter for Mexico City Olympic Games 1960s Milestones, BBC Research Department. and it was some years before digital line-store conversion was able to undertake the process seamlessly.1970 – Digital line-store standards converter work commences 1970s Milestones, BBC Research Department.

===1970s===

On 14 September 1970 the first Nine O'Clock News was broadcast on television. Robert Dougall presented the first week from studio N1[ref]

Newswatch, BBC.—the bulletin having been moved from the earlier time of 20.50 as a response to the ratings achieved by ITN's News at Ten, introduced three years earlier on the rival ITV. Richard Baker and Kenneth Kendall presented subsequent weeks, thus echoing those first television bulletins of the mid-1950s.
Angela Rippon became the first female news presenter of the Nine O'Clock News in 1975. Her work outside the news was controversial at the time, appearing on The Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show in 1976 singing and dancing.
The first edition of John Craven's Newsround, initially intended only as a short series and later renamed just Newsround, came from studio N3 on 4 April 1972.
Afternoon television news bulletins during the mid to late 1970s were broadcast from the BBC newsroom itself, rather than one of the three news studios. The newsreader would present to camera while sitting on the edge of a desk; behind him staff would be seen working busily at their desks. This period corresponded with when the Nine O'Clock News got its next makeover, and would use a CSO background of the newsroom from that very same camera each weekday evening.
Also in the mid-1970s, the late night news on BBC 2 was briefly renamed Newsnight,[ref]
[tpl]cite web|url=http://tvlistings.thetvroomplus.com/listing-2528.html|title=The TV Room+|accessdate=5 April 2009[/tpl][/ref] but this was not to last, or be the same programme as we know today – that would be launched in 1980 – and it soon reverted to being just a news summary with the early evening BBC 2 news expanded to become Newsday.
News on radio was to change in the 1970s, and on Radio 4 in particular, brought about by the arrival of new editor Peter Woon from television news and the implementation of the Broadcasting in the Seventies  report. These included the introduction of correspondents into news bulletins where previously only a newsreader would present, as well as the inclusion of content gathered in the preparation process. New programmes were also added to the daily schedule, PM and The World Tonight as part of the plan for the station to become a "wholly speech network". Newsbeat launched as the news service on Radio 1 on 10 September 1973.History of the BBC – key dates page 4 BBC Heritage 1970s.
On 23 September 1974, a teletext system which was launched to bring news content on television screens using text only was launched. Engineers originally began developing such a system to bring news to deaf viewers, but the system was expanded. The Ceefax service became much more diverse before it ceased on 23 October 2012: it not only had subtitling for all channels, it also gave information such as weather, flight times and film reviews.
By the end of the decade, the practice of shooting on film for inserts in news broadcasts was declining, with the introduction of ENG technology into the UK. The equipment would gradually became less cumbersome – the BBC's first attempts had been using a Philips colour camera with backpack base station and separate portable Sony U-matic recorder in the latter half of the decade.

===1980s===

By 1982 ENG technology had become sufficiently reliable for Bernard Hesketh to use an Ikegami camera to cover the Falklands War, coverage for which he won the "Royal Television Society Cameraman of the Year" award[ref]

BBC News won the BAFTA for its actuality coverage,BAFTA 1982 – page 10 British Academy of Film and Television Arts (PDF). however the event has become remembered in television terms for Brian Hanrahan's reporting where he coined the phrase "I'm not allowed to say how many planes joined the raid, but I counted them all out and I counted them all back"Barnes, Julian (25 February 2002), "The worst reported war since the Crimean", The Guardian. to circumvent restrictions, and which has become cited as an example of good reporting under pressure.Media & War – The Falklands Conflict Imperial War Museum.
Two years before that the Iranian Embassy Siege had been shot electronically by the BBC Television News Outside broadcasting team, and the work of reporter Kate Adie, broadcasting live from Prince's Gate, was nominated for BAFTA actuality coverage, but this time beaten by ITN for the 1980 award.BAFTA 1980 – page 2 British Academy of Film and Television Arts (PDF).
Newsnight, the news and current affairs programme, was due to go on air on 23 January 1980, although trade union disagreements meant that its launch from Lime Grove was postponed by a week. On 27 August 1981 Moira Stuart became the first African Caribbean female newsreader to appear on British television.
The first BBC breakfast television programme, Breakfast Time also launched during the 1980s, on 17 January 1983 from Lime Grove Studio E and two weeks before its ITV rival TV-am. Frank Bough, Selina Scott, and Nick Ross helped to wake viewers with a relaxed style of presenting.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/17/newsid_2530000/2530363.stm|title=BBC on this day – 17 January. 1983: BBC wakes up to morning TV|accessdate=3 April 2007 |publisher=BBC News | date=17 January 1983[/tpl]
The Six O'Clock News first aired on 3 September 1984, eventually becoming the most watched news programme in the UK (however, since 2006 it has been overtaken by the BBC News at Ten).
Starting in 1981, the BBC gave a common theme to its main news bulletins with new electronic titles–a set of computer animated "stripes" forming a circleThe circle had been a recurring theme of the BBC1 news logo since the start of the Nine in 1970, as it was thought to fit in nicely with the long-running BBC 1 globe ident, and clock face which normally precedes news broadcasts. Used until 1986, the hard wired news version was known as ANT (Animated News Titles) BBCEng.info and this new logo was drawn live – triggered by an audio tone on track 2 of the 2-track mono quarter-inch audio tape of opening title music to ensure sychronisation – and also produced the "venetian blind" wipe to the opening story. on a red background with a "BBC News" typescript appearing below the circle graphics, and a theme tune consisting of brass and keyboards. The Nine used a similar (striped) number 9. The red background was replaced by a blue from 1985 until 1987.
By 1987, the BBC had decided to re-brand its bulletins and established individual styles again for each one with differing titles and music, the weekend and holiday bulletins branded in a similar style to the Nine, although the "stripes" introduction continued to be used until 1989 on occasions where a news bulletin was screened out of the running order of the schedule.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/bbcnews/bbcnationalnewsother.html|title=TV Ark: BBC News Report: Zeebrugge ferry disaster from 6 March 1987|accessdate=1 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095542/http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/bbcnews/bbcnationalnewsother.html  |archivedate = 29 September 2007[/tpl]

===1990s===

During the 1990s, a wider range of services began to be offered by BBC News, with the split of BBC World Service Television to become BBC World (news and current affairs), and BBC Prime (light entertainment). Content for a 24-hour news channel was thus required, followed in 1997 with the launch of domestic equivalent BBC News 24. Rather than set bulletins, ongoing reports and coverage was needed to keep both channels functioning and meant a greater emphasis in budgeting for both was necessary. In 1998, after 66 years at Broadcasting House, the BBC Radio News operation moved to BBC Television Centre.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/120791.stm|title= BBC NEWS – New era for BBC radio news|accessdate=18 August 2007| date=26 June 1998 | work=BBC News[/tpl]
New technology, provided by Silicon Graphics, came into use in 1993 for a re-launch of the main BBC 1 bulletins, creating a virtual set which appeared to be much larger than it was physically. The relaunch also brought all bulletins into the same style of set with only small changes in colouring, titles, and music to differentiate each. A computer generated glass sculpture of the BBC coat of arms was the centrepiece of the programme titles until the large scale corporate rebranding of news services in 1999.
In 1999, the biggest relaunch occurred, with BBC One bulletins, BBC World, BBC News 24, and BBC News Online all adopting a common style. One of the most significant changes was the gradual adoption of the corporate image by the BBC regional news programmes, giving a common style across local, national and international BBC television news. This also included Newyddion, the main news programme of Welsh language channel S4C, produced by BBC News Wales.

===2000s===

Following the relaunch of BBC News the previous year, regional headlines were included at the start of the BBC One news bulletins in 2000. The English regions did however lose five minutes at the end of their bulletins, due to a new headline round-up at 18:55. 2000 also saw the Nine O'Clock News moved to the later time of 22:00. This was in response to ITN who had just moved their popular News at Ten programme to 23:00. ITN briefly returned News at Ten but following poor ratings when head to head against the BBC's Ten O'Clock News, the ITN bulletin was moved to 22.30, where it remained until 14 January 2008.
The retirement of Peter Sissons and departure of Michael Buerk from the Ten O'Clock News led to changes in the BBC One bulletin presenting team on 20 January 2003. The Six O'Clock News became double headed with George Alagiah and Sophie Raworth after Huw Edwards and Fiona Bruce moved to present the Ten. At the time of the changes, a new set design featuring a projected background image of a fictional newsroom was introduced. New programme titles were introduced on 16 February 2004 to match those of BBC News 24.
BBC News 24 and BBC World introduced a new style of presentation in December 2003, that was slightly altered on 5 July 2004 to mark 50 years of BBC Television News.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3829605.stm|title= Fifty years of TV news |accessdate=3 April 2007 |date=5 July 2004 |publisher=BBC News |first=Chris |last=Heard[/tpl]
The individual positions of editor of the One and Six O'Clock News were replaced by a new daytime position in November 2005. Kevin Bakhurst became the first Controller of BBC News 24, replacing the position of editor. Amanda Farnsworth became daytime editor while Craig Oliver was later named editor of the Ten O'Clock News. The bulletins also began to be simulcast with News 24, as a way of pooling resources.
Bulletins received new titles and a new set design in May 2006, to allow for Breakfast to move into the main studio for the first time since 1997. The new set featured Barco videowall screens with a background of the London skyline used for main bulletins and originally an image of cirrus clouds against a blue sky for Breakfast. This was later replaced following viewer criticism.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast/5048764.stm|title=Breakfast's new look|accessdate=3 April 2007 | date=5 June 2006|publisher=BBC News[/tpl] The studio bore similarities with the ITN-produced ITV News in 2004, though ITN uses a CSO Virtual studio rather than the actual screens at BBC News.
BBC News became part of a new BBC Journalism group in November 2006 as part of a restructuring of the BBC.

The various separate newsrooms for television, radio and online operations were merged into a single multimedia newsroom. Programme making within the newsrooms was brought together to form a multimedia programme making department. BBC World Service director Peter Horrocks said that the changes would achieve efficiency at a time of cost-cutting at the BBC. In his blog, he wrote that by using the same resources across the various broadcast media meant fewer stories could be covered, or by following more stories, there would be fewer ways to broadcast them.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2007/11/multimedia_news.html|title=Multimedia News|publisher=BBC News Online|date=12 November 2007|accessdate=19 December 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071115103603/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2007/11/multimedia_news.html| archivedate= 15 November 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
A new graphics and video playout system was introduced for production of television bulletins in January 2007. This coincided with a new structure to BBC World News bulletins, editors favouring a section devoted to analysing the news stories reported on.
The first new BBC News bulletin since the Six O'Clock News was announced in July 2007 following a successful trial in the Midlands.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6291338.stm|title=BBC One gets extra news bulletin|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=11 July 2007 | date=11 July 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070714232708/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6291338.stm| archivedate= 14 July 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The summary, lasting 90 seconds, has been broadcast at 20:00 on weekdays since December 2007 and bears similarities with 60 Seconds on BBC Three, but also includes headlines from the various BBC regions and a weather summary.
As part of a long-term cost cutting programme, bulletins were renamed the BBC News at One, Six and Ten respectively in April 2008 while BBC News 24 was renamed BBC News and moved into the same studio as the bulletins at BBC Television Centre.[tpl]cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article3735982.ece |title=BBC rings changes with news revamp |work=The Times |location=London|date= 13 April 2008|accessdate=30 April 2009 | first=Dipesh | last=Gadher[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.tv-ark.org.uk/news/bbcnews24/2008.html |title=BBC News Channel – 2008 |publisher=TV Ark |date=21 April 2008|accessdate=30 April 2009[/tpl] BBC World was renamed BBC World News and regional news programmes were also updated with the new presentation style, designed by Lambie-Nairn.[tpl]cite web|author=Peter Horrocks |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2008/04/new_news.html |title=BBC NEWS – The Editors Blog – New News |publisher=BBC|date=21 April 2008|accessdate=30 April 2009[/tpl]
The studio moves also meant that Studio N9, previously used for BBC World, was closed, and operations moved to the previous studio of BBC News 24. Studio N9 was later refitted to match the new branding, and was used for the BBC's UK local elections and European elections coverage in early June 2009.

==Broadcasting media==

===Television===

BBC News is responsible for the news programmes – and some documentary content – on the BBC's general television channels, as well as the news coverage on the BBC News channel in the UK and 22 hours of programming for the corporation's BBC World News channel internationally. Coverage for BBC Parliament is carried out on behalf on the BBC at Millbank Studios though BBC News provides editorial and journalistic content. BBC News content is also output onto the BBC's digital interactive television services under the BBC Red Button brand, and until 2012, on the Ceefax teletext system.
The distinctive music on all BBC television news programmes was introduced in 1999 and composed by David Lowe. It was part of the extensive re-branding which commenced in 1999 and features the classic 'BBC Pips'. The general theme was used not only on bulletins on BBC One but News 24, BBC World and local news programmes in the BBC's Nations and Regions. Lowe was also responsible for the music on Radio One's Newsbeat. The theme has had several changes since 1999, the latest in March 2013.
The BBC Arabic Television news channel launched on 11 March 2008, a Persian-language channel followed on 14 January 2009, broadcasting from the Peel wing of Broadcasting House; both include news, analysis, interviews, sports and highly cultural programmes and are run by the BBC World Service and funded from a grant-in-aid from the British Foreign Office (and not the television licence).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/news/story/2007/04/070426_adverttv.shtml |title=آگهی استخدام در تلویزیون فارسی بی بی سی |publisher=BBC News |language=Persian |date=26 April 2007 |accessdate=4 January 2009[/tpl]

===Radio===

BBC Radio News produces bulletins for the BBC's national radio stations and provides content for local BBC radio stations via the General News Service (GNS), a BBC-internalCeefax: The early days. news distribution service. BBC News does not produce the BBC's regional news bulletins, which are produced individually by the BBC nations and regions themselves.

==Opinions==

===Political and commercial independence===

The BBC is required by its charter to be free from both political and commercial influence and answers only to its viewers and listeners. This political objectivity is sometimes questioned. For instance, The Daily Telegraph (3 August 2005) carried a letter from the KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky, referring to it as "The Red Service". Books have been written on the subject, including anti-BBC works like Truth Betrayed by W J West and The Truth Twisters by Richard Deacon.
The BBC's Editorial Guidelines on Politics and Public Policy state that whilst "the voices and opinions of opposition parties must be routinely aired and challenged", "the government of the day will often be the primary source of news"."Editorial Guidelines Extracts", BBC.
The BBC is regularly accused by the government of the day of bias in favour of the opposition and, by the opposition, of bias in favour of the government. Similarly, during times of war, the BBC is often accused by the UK government, or by strong supporters of British military campaigns, of being overly sympathetic to the view of the enemy. An edition of Newsnight at the start of the Falklands War in 1982 was described as "almost treasonable" by John Page, MP, who objected to Peter Snow saying "if we believe the British".Denis Taylor, "BBC broadcasts jammed", The Times, 4 May 1982, p. 2.
During the first Gulf War, critics of the BBC took to using the satirical name "Baghdad Broadcasting Corporation". During the Kosovo War, the BBC were labelled the "Belgrade Broadcasting Corporation" (suggesting favouritism towards the FR Yugoslavia government over ethnic Albanian rebels) by British ministers,[tpl]cite news|publisher=News 24|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_1390672,00.html|title=BBC versus British government|date=21 July 2003[/tpl] although Slobodan Milosević (then FRY president) claimed that the BBC's coverage had been biased against his nation.[tpl]cite news|publisher=BBC News|date=22 August 2002|title=Milosevic attacks BBC 'bias'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2220904.stm | accessdate=1 January 2010[/tpl]
Conversely, some of those who style themselves anti-establishment in the United Kingdom or who oppose foreign wars have accused the BBC of pro-establishment bias or of refusing to give an outlet to "anti-war" voices. Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq a study, by the Cardiff University School of Journalism, of the reporting of the war, found that nine out of 10 references to weapons of mass destruction during the war assumed that Iraq possessed them, and only one in 10 questioned this assumption. It also found that out of the main British broadcasters covering the war the BBC was the most likely to use the British government and military as its source. It was also the least likely to use independent sources, like the Red Cross, who were more critical of the war. When it came to reporting Iraqi casualties the study found fewer reports on the BBC than on the other three main channels. The report's author, Justin Lewis, wrote "Far from revealing an anti-war BBC, our findings tend to give credence to those who criticised the BBC for being too sympathetic to the government in its war coverage. Either way, it is clear that the accusation of BBC anti-war bias fails to stand up to any serious or sustained analysis."[tpl]cite book|last=McNair|first=Brian|title=News and Journalism in the UK|date=18 February 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1134128846|page=79|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HlB8AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA79|accessdate=17 March 2014[/tpl] 
Prominent BBC appointments are constantly assessed by the British media and political establishment for signs of political bias. The appointment of Greg Dyke as Director-General was highlighted by press sources because Dyke was a Labour Party member and former activist, as well as a friend of Tony Blair. The BBC's current Political Editor, Nick Robinson, was some years ago a chairman of the Young Conservatives and did, as a result, attract informal criticism from the former Labour government, but his predecessor Andrew Marr faced similar claims from the right because he was editor of The Independent, a liberal-leaning newspaper, before his appointment in 2000.
Mark Thompson, former Director-General of the BBC, admitted the organisation has been biased "towards the left" in the past. He said, "In the BBC I joined 30 years ago, there was, in much of current affairs, in terms of people's personal politics, which were quite vocal, a massive bias to the left".[tpl]cite web|last=Yesawich |first=Avi |url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=186893 |title=Report: BBC dir.-gen. admits previous organizational bias |publisher=Jerusalem Post |date= |accessdate=22 September 2011[/tpl] He then added, "The organization did struggle then with impartiality. Now it is a completely different generation. There is much less overt tribalism among the young journalists who work for the BBC."

===India===

Hindu groups in the United Kingdom have accused the BBC of anti-Hindu bigotry and favouring Islamist groups that demonise the British Indian minority.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/storyOld.php?storyId=42169 |title=BBC coverage biased, say British Hindus |publisher=Indianexpress.com |date=2 March 2004 |accessdate=22 September 2011[/tpl]
In protest against the claimed biased coverage of the BBC, M. J. Akbar, a journalist, boycotted the BBC to speak about the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. Stephen Pound MP has supported these claims, referring to the BBC's reporting of the terror attacks as "the worst sort of mealy mouthed posturing. It is desperation to avoid causing offence which ultimately causes more offence to everyone."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/bbc-flayed-for-not-terming-mumbai-gunmen-as/393175/ |title=BBC flayed for not terming Mumbai gunmen as terrorists |publisher=Indianexpress.com |date=2 December 2008 |accessdate=5 July 2012[/tpl]
Writing for The Hindu Business Line, Premen Addy criticised the BBC's reportage on South Asia as consistently anti-India and pro-Islamist, and that they under-report India's economic and social achievements, as well as political and diplomatic efforts, and disproportionately highlight and exaggerate problems in the country.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blonnet.com/businessline/2001/05/22/stories/042255pr.htm |title=Business Line : Home Page News & Features |publisher=Blonnet.com |date= |accessdate=22 September 2011[/tpl] In addition, Addy alludes to discrimination against Indian anchors and reporters in favour of Pakistani and Bangladeshi ones who are hostile to India.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2011[/tpl]
Writing for the Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, Alasdair Pinkerton analysed the coverage of India by the BBC since India's independence from British rule in 1947 until 2008. Pinkerton observes a tumultuous history involving allegations of anti-India bias in the BBC's reportage, particularly during the cold war, and concludes that the BBC's coverage of South Asian geopolitics and economics shows a pervasive and hostile anti-India bias due to the BBC's alleged imperialist and neo-colonialist stance.
Writing on western media bias regarding South Asia in the journal of the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, media analyst Ajai K. Rai strongly criticised the BBC for anti-India bias. He claims that there is a total lack of depth or fairness in the BBC's reportage on conflict zones in South Asia, and that the BBC has, on one occasion, fabricated photographs while reporting on the Kashmir conflict to make India look bad. He also writes that the BBC made false allegations that the Indian Army stormed a sacred Muslim shrine, the tomb of Hazrat Sheikh Noor-u-din Noorani in Charari Sharief, and only retracted the claim after strong criticism from the media in India for several weeks.

===Hutton Inquiry===

BBC News was at the centre of one the largest political controversies in recent years. Three BBC News reports (Andrew Gilligan's on Today, Gavin Hewitt's on The Ten O'Clock News and another on Newsnight) quoted an anonymous source that stated the British government (particularly the Prime Minister's office) had embellished the September Dossier with misleading exaggerations of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities. The government denounced the reports and accused the corporation of poor journalism.
In subsequent weeks the corporation stood by the report, saying that it had a reliable source. Following intense media speculation, David Kelly was named in the press as the source for Gilligan's story on 9 July 2003. Kelly was found dead, by suicide, in a field close to his home early on 18 July. An inquiry led by Lord Hutton was announced by the British government the following day to investigate the circumstances leading to Kelly's death, concluding that "Dr. Kelly took his own life."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/MOO401A.html|title=Suicide or Murder? The Dr. David Kelly Affair |date=25 December 2004|accessdate=26 February 2013[/tpl]
In his report on 28 January 2004, Lord Hutton concluded that Gilligan's original accusation was "unfounded" and the BBC's editorial and management processes were "defective". In particular, it specifically criticised the chain of management that caused the BBC to defend its story. The BBC Director of News, Richard Sambrook, the report said, had accepted Gilligan's word that his story was accurate in spite of his notes being incomplete. Davies had then told the BBC Board of Governors that he was happy with the story and told the Prime Minister that a satisfactory internal inquiry had taken place. The Board of Governors, under the chairman's, Gavyn Davies, guidance, accepted that further investigation of the Government's complaints were unnecessary.
Because of the criticism in the Hutton report, Davies resigned on the day of publication. BBC News faced an important test, reporting on itself with the publication of the report, but by common consent (of the Board of Governors) managed this "independently, impartially and honestly".[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3890821.stm |title=BBC Iraq war coverage criticised |accessdate=11 April 2007 |date=13 July 2004 |publisher=BBC News[/tpl] Davies' resignation was followed by the resignation of Director General, Greg Dyke, the following day, and the resignation of Gilligan on 30 January. While undoubtedly a traumatic experience for the corporation, an ICM poll in April 2003 indicated that it had sustained its position as the best and most trusted provider of news.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3889595.stm |title=BBC report 2004: At a glance |accessdate=11 April 2007 |date=13 July 2004 |publisher=BBC News[/tpl]

===Israeli-Palestinian conflict===

The BBC has faced accusations of holding both anti-Israel and anti-Palestine bias.
Douglas Davis, the London correspondent of The Jerusalem Post, has described the BBC's coverage of the Arab-Israeli conflict as "a relentless, one-dimensional portrayal of Israel as a demonic, criminal state and Israelis as brutal oppressors which bears all the hallmarks of a concerted campaign of vilification that, wittingly or not, has the effect of delegitimising the Jewish state and pumping oxygen into a dark old European hatred that dared not speak its name for the past half-century.".Davis, Douglas. "Hatred in the air: the BBC, Israel and Antisemitism" in Iganski, Paul & Kosmin, Barry. (eds) A New Anti-Semitism? Debating Judeophobia in 21st century Britain. Profile Books, 2003, p. 130.

Critics of the BBC argue that the Balen Report proves systematic bias against Israel in headline news programming. Daily Mail and The Daily Telegraph criticised the BBC for spending hundreds of thousands of British tax payers' pounds from preventing the report being released to the public.BBC fights to suppress internal report into allegations of bias against Israel by Andy McSmith (The Independent) 28 March 2007.BBC pays £200,000 to 'cover up report on anti-Israel bias' Daily Mail 22 March 2007.Telegraph: BBC mounts court fight to keep 'critical' report secret, 15 October 2006.
Jeremy Bowen, the Middle East Editor for BBC world news, was singled out specifically for bias by the BBC Trust which concluded that he violated "BBC guidelines on accuracy and impartiality."The Independent, 16 April 2009, Bowen 'breached rules on impartiality'.
An independent panel appointed by the BBC Trust was set up in 2006 to review the impartiality of the BBC's coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbcgovernorsarchive.co.uk/docs/reviews/panel_report_final.pdf |title=Impartiality Review: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict |publisher=BBC Governors |accessdate=14 May 2007 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614000035/http://www.bbcgovernorsarchive.co.uk/docs/reviews/panel_report_final.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The panel's assessment was that "apart from individual lapses, there was little to suggest deliberate or systematic bias." While noting a "commitment to be fair accurate and impartial" and praising much of the BBC's coverage the independent panel concluded "that BBC output does not consistently give a full and fair account of the conflict. In some ways the picture is incomplete and, in that sense, misleading." It notes that, "the failure to convey adequately the disparity in the Israeli and Palestinian experience, reflects the fact that one side is in control and the other lives under occupation".
Writing in the FT, Philip Stephens, one of the panellists, later accused the BBC's director-general, Mark Thompson, of misrepresenting the panel's conclusions.

The description by one BBC correspondent reporting on the funeral of Yassir Arafat that she had been left with tears in her eyes led to other questions of impartiality, particularly from Martin Walker[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,1072-2174641,00.html |title= The BBC pro-Israeli?

Walker argues that the independent inquiry was flawed for two reasons. Firstly, because the time period over which it was conducted (August 2005 to January 2006) surrounded the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Ariel Sharon's stroke, which produced more positive coverage than usual. Furthermore, he wrote, the inquiry only looked at the BBC's domestic coverage, and excluded output on the BBC World Service and BBC World.

===The view of foreign governments===
