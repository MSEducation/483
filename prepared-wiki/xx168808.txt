Brīvā Latvija (Free Latvia; [tpl]ISSN|0934-6759[/tpl]) is a weekly newspaper for Latvians living outside Latvia, aimed mainly at those residing in western Europe. It was founded in 1986 through the merger of two émigré newspapers: the UK-based Londonas Avīze (London News; founded 1942) and Latvija (Latvia; founded 1946 in postwar DP camps), based in West Germany. BL is co-owned by the Latvian communities of western Europe. The Latvian communities in Britain, Germany, and Sweden each provide members for the newspaper's board. In the mid-1990s, after Latvia regained its independence, the printing of BL was moved for economical reasons to Riga, where the editorial office also later moved.
