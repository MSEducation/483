Da Vinci's City Hall is a Canadian dramatic television series, which premiered on CBC Television on 25 October 2005. The series was a spin-off of the long-running Canadian series Da Vinci's Inquest. The creator, writer and executive producer of the series was Chris Haddock.

==Overview==

Nicholas Campbell reprises his role as Dominic Da Vinci, a former coroner entering municipal politics as the mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia. Da Vinci is based on the real-life experiences of Larry Campbell, the former chief coroner of Vancouver who was elected that city's mayor in 2002.
With the series regular Ian Tracey (playing Mick Leary) inheriting the coroner's job, the show toggles back and forth between crime scenes and politics. Haddock says: "My approach was to make all the political stuff criminal and all the criminal stuff political. When we're in city hall we're really about conspiracy and scheming, who's crooked and who's going to get caught."

==Cancellation==

With an average weekly audience of just 400,000 viewers, Da Vinci's City Hall lost about half of the former audience for Da Vinci's Inquest. On February 13, 2006, the CBC announced that the show would not be brought back for a second season in 2006, although they also indicated that negotiations were underway to reprise the Da Vinci character in a series of television movies, similar to the manner in which North of 60 continued after its run as a weekly series had ended. The first of those TV movies, The Quality of Life, aired on CBC on June 14, 2008.[tpl]cite web | title= The Quality of Life (2008)| url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1166823/| work= Internet Movie Database| publisher= IMDb.com, Inc.| date= c. 2009| accessdate=2009-04-26[/tpl]
The show's final episode was aired on February 28, 2006.  The program was repeated on the Canadian channel Showcase during the summer of 2008.
CBC management has been criticized for cancelling the show to make room for other series that have since proved less successful."Blame for The One belongs to two on top," Toronto Star, Toronto, Ontario: August 4, 2006. pg. D.9.

==City Hall in the United States==

Beginning April 27, 2007, Superstation WGN began airing Da Vinci's City Hall, but it is promoted by American syndicator Program Partners as "Season 8" of Da Vinci's Inquest, even using the same intro as that series (which was used only late into the show's original run) despite the fact that some of the characters seen are not present in the new series.
Nationwide syndication to local stations began in November 2007, also as part of the Da Vinci's Inquest package, with that show's titles.
