Merchants with very low average transaction prices or very high average transaction prices are more averse to accepting credit cards. In some cases merchants may charge users a "credit card supplement" (or surcharge), either a fixed amount or a percentage, for payment by credit card.<ref>[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bmibaby.com/bmibaby/terms_and_conditions/our_top_booking_tips,_baby/fees_and_charges.aspx |title=Example of a supplement chargeable to the customer when paying by credit card |publisher=Bmibaby.com |date=2011-01-05 |accessdate=2011-07-28[/tpl]</ref> This practice is prohibited by most credit card contracts in the United States, and is actually illegal in 10 states,<ref name=gensler2013/> although the contracts allow the merchants to give discounts for cash payment.
Merchants are also required to lease or purchase processing equipment, in some cases this equipment is provided free of charge by the Processor. Merchants must also satisfy data security compliance standards which are highly technical and complicated. In many cases, there is a delay of several days before funds are deposited into a merchant's bank account. Because credit card fee structures are very complicated, smaller merchants are at a disadvantage to analyze and predict fees.
Finally, merchants assume the risk of chargebacks by consumers.

===Parties involved===

The flow of information and money between these parties — always through the card associations — is known as the interchange, and it consists of a few steps.

===Transaction steps===

===Secured credit cards===

A secured credit card is a type of credit card secured by a deposit account owned by the cardholder.  Typically, the cardholder must deposit between 100% and 200% of the total amount of credit desired. Thus if the cardholder puts down $1,000, they will be given credit in the range of $500–1,000. In some cases, credit card issuers will offer incentives even on their secured card portfolios.  In these cases, the deposit required may be significantly less than the required credit limit, and can be as low as 10% of the desired credit limit.  This deposit is held in a special savings account. Credit card issuers offer this because they have noticed that delinquencies were notably reduced when the customer perceives something to lose if the balance is not repaid.
The cardholder of a secured credit card is still expected to make regular payments, as with a regular credit card, but should they default on a payment, the card issuer has the option of recovering the cost of the purchases paid to the merchants out of the deposit.  The advantage of the secured card for an individual with negative or no credit history is that most companies report regularly to the major credit bureaus.  This allows building a positive credit history.
Although the deposit is in the hands of the credit card issuer as security in the event of default by the consumer, the deposit will not be debited simply for missing one or two payments.  Usually the deposit is only used as an offset when the account is closed, either at the request of the customer or due to severe delinquency (150 to 180 days).  This means that an account which is less than 150 days delinquent will continue to accrue interest and fees, and could result in a balance which is much higher than the actual credit limit on the card.  In these cases the total debt may far exceed the original deposit and the cardholder not only forfeits their deposit but is left with an additional debt.
Most of these conditions are usually described in a cardholder agreement which the cardholder signs when their account is opened.
Secured credit cards are an option to allow a person with a poor credit history or no credit history to have a credit card which might not otherwise be available. They are often offered as a means of rebuilding one's credit.  Fees and service charges for secured credit cards often exceed those charged for ordinary non-secured credit cards, however, for people in certain situations, (for example, after charging off on other credit cards, or people with a long history of delinquency on various forms of debt), secured cards are almost always more expensive than unsecured credit cards.
Sometimes a credit card will be secured by the equity in the borrower's home.

===Prepaid "credit" cards===

A "prepaid credit card" is not a true credit card, since no credit is offered by the card issuer: the card-holder spends money which has been "stored" via a prior deposit by the card-holder or someone else, such as a parent or employer. However, it carries a credit-card brand (such as Discover, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or JCB etc.) and can be used in similar ways just as though it were a regular credit card. Unlike debit cards, prepaid credit cards generally do not require a PIN. An exception are prepaid credit cards with an EMV chip. These cards do require a PIN if the payment is processed via Chip and PIN technology.
After purchasing the card, the cardholder loads the account with any amount of money, up to the predetermined card limit and then uses the card to make purchases the same way as a typical credit card. Prepaid cards can be issued to minors (above 13) since there is no credit line involved. The main advantage over secured credit cards (see above section) is that the cardholder is not required to come up with $500 or more to open an account. With prepaid credit cards purchasers are not charged any interest but are often charged a purchasing fee plus monthly fees after an arbitrary time period. Many other fees also usually apply to a prepaid card.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PrepaidCards_e.asp| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070307084013/http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PrepaidCards_e.asp| archivedate=2007-03-07| title=Credit Cards and You – About Pre-paid Cards| publisher=Financial Consumer Agency of Canada| accessdate=2008-01-09[/tpl] document: [tpl]cite web| url=http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PDFs/Prepaid-e.pdf| title=Pre-paid Cards| publisher=Financial Consumer Agency of Canada| format=PDF| accessdate=2008-01-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080229122947/http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/publications/CreditCardsYou/PDFs/Prepaid-e.pdf  |archivedate = 2008-02-29[/tpl]
