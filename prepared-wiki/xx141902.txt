[[Phytotoxin]]

CATEGORIES: Plant toxins

Phytotoxin refers to a substance, known as phytotoxic substances, in soils inhibitory to the growth of or poisonous to plants. Phytotoxic substances may result from human activity, or they may be produced by plant roots, by microorganisms, or by naturally-occurring chemical reactions."Science Encyclopedia:Biochemistry" http://science.jrank.org/pages/39180/phytotoxin.html 2010/4/5. A good soil will protect plants from toxic concentrations of such substances by ventilating gases, by decomposing or adsorbing organic toxins, or by suppressing toxin-producing organisms. Many substances produced by plants are secondary metabolites and are the by-products of primary physiological processes.Raven, Peter H,Ray F. Evert, Susan E. Eichhorn: "Biology of Plants", pages 27-33. Some examples of phytotoxins exist among the plant secondary compound classes of alkaloids, terpenes, and especially phenolics, though not all such compounds are phytotoxic. They can be found as well in herbicides and substances produced by bacteria.

==Toxins Produced By Plants==

===Alkaloids===

Alkaloids are derived from amino acids, and contain nitrogen.Zeiger, L. Taiz: "Plant Physiology: Plant Defenses" pages 349-376. They are medically important by interfering with components of the nervous system affecting membrane transport, protein synthesis, and enzyme activities.
They generally have a bitter taste. Alkaloids usually end in -ine (caffeine, nicotine, cocaine, morphine, ephedrine).

===Terpenes===

Terpenes are made of water insoluble lipids, and synthesized from acetyl CoA or basic intermediates of glycolysisPlant Sciences "Poisonous Plants". pages 170-175. They often end in -ol (menthol) and make the majority of plant essential oils.

===Phenolics===

Phenolics are made of a hydroxyl group bonded to an aromatic hydrocarbon. Furanocoumarin is a phenolic and is non-toxic until activated by light. Furancoumarin blocks the transcription and repair of DNA. Tannins are another group of phenolics and they are important in tanning leather. Lignins, also a group of phenolics, is the most common compound on earth and helps conduct water in plant stems and fill spaces in the cell.

==Substances Toxic to Plants==

===Herbicides===

Herbicides usually interfere with plant growth and often imitate plant hormones.

===Bacterial Phytotoxins===
