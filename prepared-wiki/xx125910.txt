===Business in the Parliament===

To work in partnership with business and establish an Annual Business Forum.
The Partnership Agreement commits the Scottish Government to work in partnership with business and establish an Annual Business Forum to develop ideas and maximise the drivers for growth.
The Executive jointly hosted a business conference with the Scottish Parliament on 22 and 23 April 2004.

The Executive has considered the main issues raised at the Conference and in September 2004 produced a formal response to each of these issues. In July 2005, an updated response was published, to show policy development and implementation progress.

===Convention of the Highlands and Islands===

The Convention is a meeting between the Executive and its main partner agencies, represented by the Chairperson of each organisation.
It is currently held twice yearly, and is hosted by a different local authority each time with the location alternating between a mainland and an island.
The Convention is intended to strengthen co-ordination between member organisations, the Executive and other representative bodies to better inform the development and realisation of strategic economic, environmental, cultural and social justice objectives.
The Convention is unique to the Highlands and Islands because the level of remoteness, rurality and sparseness of population here is not mirrored elsewhere in Scotland.
It recognises the diversity and differing needs of Highland and Islands communities, and the distinct nature of the challenges and opportunities that exist in the area. The Convention's focus will be on delivering these strategic objectives to the long-term benefit of the people of the Highlands and Islands, and Scotland.
The Convention is held in a different location once every six months.
