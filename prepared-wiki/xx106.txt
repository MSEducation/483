The Black Russian is a cocktail of vodka and coffee liqueur. It contains either three parts vodka and two parts coffee liqueur, per the Kahl√∫a bottle's label, or five parts vodka to two parts coffee liqueur, per IBA specified ingredients. Traditionally the drink is made by pouring the vodka over ice cubes or cracked ice in an old-fashioned glass, followed by the coffee liqueur.[tpl]Cite web | title = SpiritDrinks.com - Black Russian | publisher = SpiritDrinks | url = http://www.spiritdrinks.com/cocktails/Black_Russian.asp | accessdate = July 12, 2010[/tpl]
This combination first appeared in 1949, and is ascribed to Gustave Tops, a Belgian barman, who created it at the Hotel Metropole in Brussels in honor of Perle Mesta, then U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg.[tpl]Cite web | last = Sicard | first = Cheri | title = Featured Cocktails - Black Russian and White Russian | publisher = FabulousFoods.com | date = August 6, 2007 | url = http://www.fabulousfoods.com/index.php?option=com_resource&controller=article&article=21219&category_id=237&Itemid=177 | accessdate = June 8, 2010[/tpl] The cocktail owes its name to the use of vodka, a typical Russian spirit, and the blackness of the coffee liqueur.
