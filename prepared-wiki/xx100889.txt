==Biography==

Maude was born in London and educated at Wixenford and Charterhouse School. In 1881, he was sent to Adelaide, South Australia, on the clipper ship City of Adelaide to regain his health.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hat-archive.blogspot.com/2010/10/cyril-maude.html|title=Cyril Maude |publisher=History of Australian Theatre |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=4 June 2011 [/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15744976 |title=THE CYRIL MAUDE SEASON. |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842-1954) |location=NSW |date=4 August 1917 |accessdate=4 June 2011 |page=16 |publisher=National Library of Australia[/tpl]  He returned to Britain without having regained his health, but nursing the ambition to be an actor.
Maude fulfilled his acting ambition in Denver, Colorado, in the U.S., in 1883. From 1896 until 1905 he was co-manager of the Haymarket Theatre in London with Frederick Harrison. There he became known for his quietly humorous acting in many parts. In 1906 he went into management on his own account, and in 1907 he opened the Playhouse, also in London.
Maude became very well known for his role as "Grumpy" a spoilt old man, who as a retired lawyer solved a crime to keep his loved ones happy. Maude took this play to Australia and toured Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney where it was immensely popular.  In 1923 he toured America with Lydia Bilbrook and Mabel Terry-Lewis in If Winter Comes, playing at Chicago in April and New York in the autumn."Dramatis Personae", The Observer, 25 February 1923, p. 11

He starred in several films in the 1930s, including Grumpy. In 1947, he appeared at the age of 85 in the film While the Sun Shines.
