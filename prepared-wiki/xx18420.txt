Straw is an agricultural by-product, the dry stalks of cereal plants, after the grain and chaff have been removed.  Straw makes up about half of the yield of cereal crops such as barley, oats, rice, rye and wheat.  It has many uses, including fuel, livestock bedding and fodder, thatching and basket-making.  It is usually gathered and stored in a straw bale, which is a bundle of straw tightly bound with twine or wire. Bales may be square, rectangular, or round, depending on the type of baler used.

==Uses==

Current and historic uses of straw include:

January 2003.[/ref]  However, bales are often ineffective in protecting water quality and are maintenance-intensive.  For these reasons the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and various state agencies recommend use of alternative sediment control practices where possible, such as silt fences, fiber rolls and geotextiles.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

==Research==

In addition to its current and historic uses, straw is being investigated as a source of fine chemicals including alkaloids, flavonoids, lignins, phenols, and steroids.[tpl]cite journal| author=Schnitzer M, Monreal CM, Powell EE| title=Wheat straw biomass: A resource for high-value chemicals| journal=Journal of Environmental Science and Health, Part B: Pesticides, Food Contaminants, and Agricultural Wastes| year= 2014 | volume= 49 | issue= 1 | pages= 51–67 | pmid=24138469 | doi=10.1080/03601234.2013.836924[/tpl]
