==Early life==

Princess Eugenie was born in London at the Portland Hospital on 23 March 1990, the second child of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and Sarah, Duchess of York, and sixth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. She is also a distant cousin of her late aunt Diana, Princess of Wales, whose father was John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer, since Eugenie's mother Sarah, Duchess of York is a direct descendant of Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, daughter of John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer, (via Georgiana's illegitimate daughter Eliza Courtney). On the seventh day after her birth it was announced (30 March) that the Duke and Duchess of York had named the princess Eugenie Victoria Helena.[ref]
Buckingham Palace announcement, 30 March 1990[/ref] She was baptised at the Church of St Mary Magdalene, Sandringham, by the Bishop of Norwich, on 23 December 1990. She was the first royal baby to have a public christening, and her godparents were James Ogilvy (her father's second cousin), Captain Alastair Ross (who was unable to attend), Mrs. Ronald Ferguson (her maternal grandfather's 2nd wife), Mrs. Patrick Dodd-Noble, and Miss Louise Blacker.Yvonne's Royalty Home Page – Royal Christenings She was named after Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg and Princess Helena, Queen Victoria's granddaughter and daughter respectively.Illustrated biography of Princess Eugenie She and her sister are the only granddaughters of the Queen to hold the title of Princess of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the style Her Royal Highness: their cousin, Lady Louise Windsor is styled as the daughter of an earl at the request of the Queen and her parents; their other female first cousin, Zara Phillips, is the Queen's granddaughter through the female line, therefore allowing her only the title and style of her father, who has none.
Eugenie is also the first British Princess since her grandmother's aunt, Princess Victoria Alexandra Alice Mary (known as Princess Mary), to bear the name Victoria; Queen Victoria had requested that her female descendants bear the name Victoria somewhere in their name, however neither the Queen, the late  Princess Margaret, Princess Alexandra, Princess Anne, nor Princess Beatrice hold the name Victoria.
Princess Eugenie's parents divorced when she was six years old. When she was not at school, her time was spent with her family, as the divorce had been amicable and the Duke and Duchess of York had agreed to joint custody of the girls. Eugenie and her sister frequently travel abroad with one or both of their parents. In the April 2008 issue of Tatler, Eugenie described her grandmother as "one of the most amazing women ever", and her parents as "the best divorced couple" she knew.
In October 2002, 12-year-old Eugenie underwent back surgery at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in London to correct scoliosis. She still has the two titanium rods in her back that were put in place in 2002.[tpl]cite web|url=http://celebrity.rightpundits.com/?p=3876 |title=Princess Eugenie Biography;[/tpl] She made a full recovery and is not expected to undergo any further surgery for the condition. When Princess Eugenie turned 17, she underwent orthodontic treatment, like her sister. She had her orthodontic appliances on for two years before they were taken off. In 2014, Eugenie re-opened the children's unit at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital.
