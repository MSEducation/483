[[White cane]]

CATEGORIES: Accessibility, Mobility devices, Blindness equipment

A white cane is used by many people who are blind or visually impaired. Its primary uses are as a mobility tool and as a courtesy to others, but there are at least five varieties, each serving a slightly different need.

==Types==

Mobility canes are often made from aluminium, graphite-reinforced plastic or other fibre-reinforced plastic, and can come with a wide variety of tips depending upon user preference.
White canes can be either collapsible or straight, with both versions having pros and cons. The National Federation of the Blind in the United States affirms that the lightness and greater length of the straight canes allows greater mobility and safety, though collapsible canes can be stored with more ease, giving them advantage in crowded areas such as classrooms and public events.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl]

==History==

Blind people have used canes as mobility tools for centuries,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.orientationandmobility.org/profession.html|title=Historical Development of Orientation and Mobility as a Profession|first=Pat|last=Kelley|publisher=OrientationAndMobility.org|year=1999|accessdate=20 January 2012[/tpl] but it was not until after World War I that the white cane was introduced.
In 1921 James Biggs, a photographer from Bristol who became blind after an accident and was uncomfortable with the amount of traffic around his home, painted his walking stick white to be more easily visible.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
In 1931 in France, Guilly d'Herbemont launched a national white stick movement for blind people. On February 7, 1931, Guilly d'Herbemont symbolically gave the first two white canes to blind people, in the presence of several French ministers. 5,000 more white canes were later sent to blind French veterans from World War I and blind civilians.[tpl]Citation | author = Bailly, Claude | year = 1990  | title = Les débuts de la canne blanche | journal = l'Auxilaire des aveugles| url = http://dherbemont.free.fr/en/textes/cannes.html|language=French|accessdate=20 January 2012[/tpl]
In the United States, the introduction of the white cane is attributed to George A. Bonham of the Lions Clubs International.White Cane Day[tpl]wayback | url = http://www.lionsclubs.org/EN/content/vision_services_whitecane.shtml | date = 20021027155024[/tpl] In 1930, a Lions Club member watched as a man who was blind attempted to cross the street with a black cane that was barely visible to motorists against the dark pavement. The Lions decided to paint the cane white to make it more visible. In 1931, Lions Clubs International began a program promoting the use of white canes for people who are blind.
The first special white cane ordinance was passed in December 1930 in Peoria, Illinois granting blind pedestrians protections and the right-of-way while carrying a white cane. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
The long cane was improved upon by World War II veterans rehabilitation specialist, Richard E. Hoover, at Valley Forge Army Hospital.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.afb.org/unseen/book.asp?ch=Koe-33omchron|title=Historical Chronologies , The Unseen Minority: A Social History of Blindness in the United States|publisher=American Printing House for the Blind|first=Frances A|last=Koestler|accessdate=20 January 2012[/tpl]  In 1944, he took the Lions Club white cane (originally made of wood) and went around the hospital blindfolded for a week. During this time he developed what is now the standard method of "long cane" training or the Hoover Method.  He is now called the "Father of the Lightweight Long Cane Technique."  The basic technique is to swing the cane from the center of the body back and forth before the feet.  The cane should be swept before the rear foot as the person steps.  Before he taught other rehabilitators, or "orientors," his new technique he had a special commission to have light weight, long white canes made for the veterans of the European fronts.

On October 6, 1964, a joint resolution of the Congress, HR 753, was signed into law authorizing the President of the United States to proclaim October 15 of each year as "White Cane Safety Day". President Lyndon Johnson was the first to make this proclamation. [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]

==Legislation about canes==

While the white cane is commonly accepted as a "symbol of blindness", different countries still have different rules concerning what constitutes a "cane for the blind".
In the United Kingdom, the white cane indicates that the individual has a visual impairment; with two red bands added it indicates that the user is deafblind.
In the United States, laws vary from state to state, but in all cases, those carrying white canes are afforded the right-of-way when crossing a road.  They are afforded the right to use their cane in any public place as well. In some cases, it is illegal for a non-blind person to carry a white cane.http://www.nfb-nagdu.org/laws/usa/usa.html[tpl]wayback | url = http://www.nfb-nagdu.org/laws/usa/usa.html | date = 20031010015519[/tpl]

==Comparison to guide dogs==

While a guide dog, the other major mobility aid for blind people, can interact more with the user and the environment, making them more useful in certain locations, white canes are alternatives for reasons of price, care, and in case of some people, allergies. Despite the high profile of guide dogs, however, most blind people still use canes at least sometimes, and many still use canes entirely.

==Children and canes==

In many countries, including the UK, a cane is not generally introduced to a child until they are between 7 and 10 years old.  However, more recently canes have been started to be introduced as soon as a child learns to walk to aid development with great success.http://www.worldaccessfortheblind.org/sites/default/files/Facilitating_Movement.pdf[tpl]page needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]http://www.commonsense.me.uk
Joseph Cutter and Lilli Nielsen, pioneers in research on the development of blind and multiple-handicapped children, have begun to introduce new research on mobility in blind infants in children.  Cutter's book, Independent Movement and Travel in Blind Children,[tpl]Citation | author = Cutter, Joseph | year = 2007  | title = Independent Movement and Travel in Blind Children | ISBN= 1-59311-603-9[/tpl][tpl]page needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] recommends a cane to be introduced as early as possible, so that the blind child learns to use it and move around naturally and organically, the same way a sighted child learns to walk.  A longer cane, between nose and chin height, is recommended to compensate for a child's more immature grasp and tendency to hold the handle of the cane by the side instead of out in front.  Mature cane technique should not be expected from a child, and style and technique can be refined as the child gets older.
