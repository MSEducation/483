CATEGORIES: Lists of The Simpsons characters

Along with the Simpson family, The Simpsons includes a large array of characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople, local celebrities, and fictional characters. The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokesters or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to creator Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the Canadian sketch comedy show Second City Television.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771/1 |title=Matt Groening: Interview |accessdate=29 September 2008 |author=Rabin, Nathan |date=26 April 2006 |publisher=The A.V.
