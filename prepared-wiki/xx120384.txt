==History==

Before being built at Great Adventure, Xcalibur was used in carnivals in Europe.

===Six Flags Great Adventure (1999-2002)===

Xcalibur was announced at Six Flags Great Adventure as Evolution, for the 1999 season along with 24 other attractions, known as War on Lines. Evolution was supposed to be built in Movietown but later the ride was built where Fantasy Fling was located in the Fantasy Forest section of the park. Before it opened the ride went through rigorous testings and state inspections. Since Evolution opened the ride faced multiple problems with operations on the control panel that few can operate. Just after four seasons at the park Evolution was removed and relocated to Six Flags St. Louis. Currently the new Fender Benders (bumper cars) are currently being constructed at the former site of Evolution and opened in Summer 2012.[tpl]cite web|title=Six Flags Great Adventure Announces New Attractions for 2012|url=http://news.sixflags.com/2012news/2011/08/26/greatadventure/|work=Press Release|publisher=Six Flags|accessdate=April 21, 2012|author=Six Flags Great Adventure|date=September 1, 2011[/tpl]

===Six Flags St. Louis (2003-present)===

Evolution was relocated to Six Flags St. Louis and opened at the Missouri park in Spring 2003 as Xcalibur. During the relocation Xcalibur received a better control panel than before and enhanced Medieval theme elements. Also each of the 16 gondolas received a sound system where the ride operator can talk during the ride and play theme music. The ride is currently operating.
