Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department, commonly known as the Home Secretary, is the minister responsible for the Home Office of the United Kingdom, one of the four Great Offices of State. The Home Secretary is responsible for the internal affairs of England and Wales, and for immigration and citizenship for the whole of the United Kingdom. 
The remit of the Home Office also includes policing in England and Wales and matters of national security, as the Security Service, MI5, is directly accountable to the Home Secretary. Formerly, the Home Secretary was the minister responsible for prisons and probation in England and Wales; however, in 2005 those responsibilities were transferred to the newly created Ministry of Justice under the Lord Chancellor.
The current Home Secretary is The Rt Honourable Theresa May, MP, appointed on 12 May 2010 by the Prime Minister, David Cameron, to serve in the Conservative-Liberal Democratic coalition government.
