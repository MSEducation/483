National Heart Institute of Malaysia ([tpl]lang-ms|Institut Jantung Negara[/tpl], abbreviated as IJN), is Malaysiaâ€™s premier heart centre. Established in September 1992, IJN provides cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery services for both adult and paediatric cases. As the national referral centre for cardiovascular disease, IJN sees new cases referred from all over the country and abroad as well as follow-up cases at the outpatient clinics.
The only centre specialising in treatment and management of heart diseases, IJN offers a comprehensive range of services for cardiovascular medicine with all types of interventions; both diagnostic and therapeutic and cardiac surgeries for open heart, closed heart, thoracic and transplants are performed.
Since its establishment, IJN has kept abreast with the latest medical advances from just handling a simple hole in the heart to heart and lung transplantations. Today, we have a highly competent team of cardiologists, paediatric cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, cardiac anaesthesiologists, support staff to handle emergencies and even the most complicated cases. We are ready to provide our patients with the expertise they acquired with kindness, care and comfort at anytime.
IJN is currently expanding to increase the facilities and is expected to complete by 2nd quarter of 2009. Upon completion, IJN will have a total of 432 beds specially dedicated for heart treatment and will be one of the largest heart centres in the region.
