==History==

Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation was founded in 1954, as a government parastatal, whose primary objective was to provide a vehicle for Kenyans to invest in the economy of newly independent Kenya, by investing in Kenyan companies. In 1967 ICDC formed a subsidiary called ICDC Investment Company Limited, whose shares were listed on the NSE. In 1998, with the Government of Kenya, having sold some of its majority shareholding, ICDC Investment Company adopted a new management structure, handing over day-to-day management to an independent professional managerial team, supervised by an independent board of directors, elected by the shareholders. In 2007, the shareholders opted to change the name of the company to Centum Investment Company Limited.[tpl]cite web|title=Centum: Our History |publisher=Centum Investment Company Limited|url=http://www.centum.co.ke/index.php/about-us/our-history|accessdate=14 April 2014[/tpl] The shares Centum Investments Company Limited are publicly traded on the Nairobi Stock Exchange since 1967, and on the Uganda Securities Exchange, effective 10 February 2011. Plans are underway to crosslist the company stock on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange and on the Rwanda Stock Exchange.[tpl]cite web|first=Fred|last=Ojambo|title=Centum Investments Starts Secondary Trading In Uganda|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-10/centum-of-kenya-starts-secondary-trading-in-uganda-in-regional-expansion.html|date=10 February 2011|accessdate=14 April 2014[/tpl]
