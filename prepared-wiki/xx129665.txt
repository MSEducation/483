CATEGORIES: Mountains and hills of County Kerry

The Black Valley in County Kerry, is a remote location in the Macgillycuddy's Reeks situated south of the Gap of Dunloe and north of Moll's Gap. The valley is also part of the Kerry Way, a walkers version of the Ring of Kerry beginning and ending in Killarney.
The valley is also noted for being the last place in Ireland to be connected to the electricity and telephone networks due to its remoteness.  The connection happened in 1978, according to a CIE Tour Guide.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.kerryway.com/towns-villages/black-valley.php|title=Kerry Way - Town & Villages - Black Valley|accessdate=2009-10-19[/tpl]
