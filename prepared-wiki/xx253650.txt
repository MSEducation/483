[[Energy-Efficient Ethernet]]

CATEGORIES: IEEE 802, Ethernet, Energy conservation, Computers and the environment

Energy-Efficient Ethernet is a set of enhancements to the twisted-pair and backplane Ethernet family of computer networking standards that allow for less power consumption during periods of low data activity.  The intention was to reduce power consumption by 50% or more, while retaining full compatibility with existing equipment.[tpl]Cite web |author=Sean Michael Kerner |url= http://blog.internetnews.com/skerner/2009/07/energy-efficient-ethernet-hits.html |title=Energy Efficient Ethernet hits standards milestone — InternetNews:The Blog — Sean Michael Kerner |work= Internetnews blog |date= July 17, 2009 |accessdate= July 5, 2011 [/tpl]  The  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), through the IEEE 802.3az task force developed the standard. The first study group had its call for interest in November 2006, and the official standards task force was authorized in May 2007.[tpl]cite web |title= IEEE 802.3 Energy Efficient Ethernet Study Group|url= http://www.ieee802.org/3/eee_study/index.html |date= September 21, 2007 |accessdate= July 5, 2011 [/tpl] The IEEE ratified the final standard in September 2010.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.lightwaveonline.com/education/news/IEEE-ratifies-new-8023az-standard-to-reduce-network-energy-footprint--104392129.html |title=IEEE ratifies new 8023az standard to reduce network energy footprint |date= October 5, 2010 |work= Lightwaveonline.com |accessdate= July 5, 2011 [/tpl] Some companies introduced technology to reduce the power required for Ethernet before the standard was ratified, using the name Green Ethernet.

==Potential savings==

In 2005, all the network interface controllers in the United States (in computers, switches, and routers) used an estimated 5.3 terawatt-hours of electricity.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/energyefficient-ethernet |work=IEEE SpectrumEnergy-Efficient Ethernet: Ethernet connections waste lots of watts. It need not be so |author= Prachi Patel-Predd |title= Energy-Efficient Ethernet |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date= May 2008 |accessdate= July 5, 2011 [/tpl]  According to a researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Energy-Efficient Ethernet can potentially save an estimated [tpl]nowrap|US$450 million[/tpl] a year in energy costs in the U.S. Most of the savings from homes ([tpl]nowrap|$200 million[/tpl]), and offices ([tpl]nowrap|$170 million[/tpl]), and the remaining [tpl]nowrap|$80 million[/tpl] from data centers.

==Concepts==

The power reduction is accomplished in a few ways.  
In [tpl]nowrap|100 Mbit/s[/tpl], 1 gigabit and [tpl]nowrap|10 Gbit/s[/tpl] speed data links, energy is used to keep the physical layer transmitters on all the time. If they could be put into "sleep" mode when no data is being sent that energy could be saved.[tpl]Cite news |url= http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4076984/Energy-efficient-Ethernet-standard-gains-traction/ |title=Energy-efficient Ethernet standard gains traction |work=EE Times |date= May 8, 2008 |author= Rick Merritt |accessdate= July 5, 2011 [/tpl] By sending a low-power-idle (LPI) indication signal for a specified time the transmit chips in the system can be turned off. LPI is sent periodically to refresh the sleep mode. When there is data to transmit a normal idle signal is sent to wake the transmit system up before data is due to be sent. The data link is considered to be always operational, as the receive signal circuit remains active even when the transmit path is in sleep mode.

===Features compared to Green Ethernet===

Some energy-efficient switch-integrated circuits were developed before the  IEEE 802.3az standard was finalized.[tpl]cite press release |publisher=Broadcom Corporation|date=June 3, 2009 |title=Top OEMs 'Go Green' With Broadcom's 65nm SMB Switch Family |quote='The reduced power consumption offered by these single-chip switch solutions results in an energy saving device with reduced operating costs.' said Jacky Chang, Senior Director at D-Link. 'As part of our D-Link Green™ initiative, we aim to give consumers ecologically friendly choices. By combining Broadcom's switch solutions with our green technology, we have been able to develop our second generation of Green Ethernet switches that provide competitive solutions with enhanced power saving benefits for all of our customers, from home users to enterprise.' |url= http://www.broadcom.com/press/release.php?id=s387906  |accessdate= July 5, 2011 [/tpl][tpl]Cite web |url= http://www.calit2.uci.edu/uploads/Media/Text/Ilyadis_BRCM_EEN_Update_UCI%20Workshop%20April%201%202010.pdf |format=PDF |title= Broadcom Energy Efficiency Initiatives |date=April 1, 2010 |author=Nicholas Ilyadis |publisher=Broadcom |accessdate= July 5, 2011[/tpl]
Green Ethernet technology was a superset of the 802.3az standard.  In addition to the link load power savings of Energy-Efficient Ethernet, Green Ethernet works in one of two ways.  First, it detects link status, allowing each port on the switch to power down into a standby or ‘sleep’ mode when a connected device, such as a computer, is not active. Second, it detects cable length and adjusts the power accordingly. Previous standard switches provide enough power to send a signal up to [tpl]convert|100|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl].[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/routers/ps133/products_tech_note09186a00801f5d9e.shtml#limits|title=Ethernet 100BaseTX and 10BaseT Cables: Guidelines and specifications|work=Cisco 10000 Series Routers |publisher=Cisco Systems|at=Specifications and Connection Limits for 100-Mbps Transmission|date=August 1, 2006|accessdate=August 29, 2010[/tpl] However, this is often unnecessary, especially in the home, where [tpl]convert|5|to|10|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl] of cabling are typical between rooms.
Green Ethernet also encompasses the use of more efficient circuitry in Ethernet chips, and the use of "off-load engines" on Ethernet interface cards intended for network servers.

===Routers===

In April 2008, the term was used for switches, and, in July 2008, introduced into wireless routers.[tpl]cite news |publisher=D-Link| url= http://www.dlinkgreen.com/press.asp?pressrelease_id=3 |accessdate= July 5, 2011 |date= July 28, 2008 |title=D-Link First Company to Offer Green Wi-Fi Home Networking |work= News release[/tpl] A Wireless LAN scheduler using Wireless N Gigabit routers automatically determines when Wi-Fi radio signals are turned on and off to further reduce energy consumption.

===Power savings===

Green Ethernet was first employed on home products. However, low port counts mean that significant cost savings are not going to be made using this technology only in the home. Turning off existing devices when they are idle is likely to provide a more immediate saving.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/lanwan/lanwan-features/30407-how-much-can-d-links-qgreen-ethernetq-switch-save-you |title=How Much Can D-Link's "Green Ethernet" Switch Save You? |author= Tom Higins |date= April 23, 2008 |work= Small Net Builder blog |accessdate= July 5, 2011[/tpl] Projected power savings of up to [tpl]nowrap|45 - 80 percent[/tpl] were estimated using Green Ethernet switches,[tpl]cite news |publisher= D-Link |url= http://www.dlinkgreen.com/press.asp?pressrelease_id=6 |accessdate= July 5, 2011 |date= October 24, 2007 |title= D-Link First Company to Offer 'Green Ethernet™' Technology for Network Connectivity, Embrace Energy-Saving Initiatives |quote=For example, when connected and subsequently powered down, the DGS-2208  multi-port desktop switch can realize up to 80 percent savings in power usage*, and the other D-Link 'Green Ethernet' switches can save up to 45 percent in power usage.[/tpl] translating into a longer product life due to reduced heat dissipation.[tpl]Cite news |title=Green Ethernet |author=Brad Kenney |date=April 11, 2008 |work= IndustryWeek |url=http://www.industryweek.com/articles/green_ethernet_16103.aspx |accessdate= July 5, 2011 [/tpl]
