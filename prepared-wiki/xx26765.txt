[[The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time]]

CATEGORIES: 1973 books, Physics books, Books by Stephen Hawking

The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time[tpl]ref|a|a[/tpl] is a book on the theoretical physics of spacetime, written by Stephen Hawking and George Ellis and published in 1973 by Cambridge University Press.
The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time is an in-depth 384-page long science book co-written by Stephen Hawking and George Ellis. Hawking and Ellis attempt to describe the foundation of space itself and its nature of infinite expansion, using differential geometry to examine the consequences of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.
Hawking co-wrote the book with Ellis, while a post doc at Cambridge University.  In his 1988 book A Brief History of Time, he describes The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time as "highly technical" and unreadable for the common reader.
The book, now considered a classic, has also appeared in paperback format and has been reprinted many times.[tpl]ref|b|b[/tpl]
