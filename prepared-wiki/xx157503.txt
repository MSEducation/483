European Superstate is a term mainly used to describe a potential result of the European Union's integration, though it could also be linked to other historical attempts to bring the continent together as one single national entity.
Traditionally, the term 'European Superstate', particularly within the UK, is used as a criticism of further integration into the EU with the term implying a forced loss of national sovereignty.http://www.sovereignty.org.uk/features/articles/eucost.html 
Along with this connotation is the implication of the loss of individual state's national identity with the replacement of one single homogenous identity which groups such as UKIP argue is a goal which the EU is trying to achieve.http://www.ukip.org/content/prince-charles-and-the-eu/490-nigel-did-the-right-thing
The term is often used in contrast to an idea of a Federal Europe which argues that  is to accommodate other national identitities with partial sovereignty being retained by individual member states, though often the terms are mistakely used synonymously.
