[[Newlands Cross]]

CATEGORIES: Clondalkin, Transport in South Dublin (county)

Newlands Cross is a well-known crossroads in south-west Dublin in the county of South Dublin. It is the point where the N7 National Route to the South West and Mid West crosses an orbital local route, the R113. For many years this area roughly marked the place where Dublin City ended and the "country" began, though it is now inside the urban area.  
The R113 (in the form of the Belgard Road dual-carriageway) joins Newlands to Tallaght in the South and to the Fonthill Road in Clondalkin village to the North; the cross itself is located at the southern end of Clondalkin.
A very busy traffic junction, as of 2013 it is the only remaining at-grade and signal controlled crossing of the N7 between the M50 and Limerick, but work is underway to upgrade it to a grade-separated interchange to relieve serious traffic congestion. The upgraded N7 will pass over the R113. Construction went to tender in August 2008 and preparatory work started in September 2008. Following delays, construction proper started in June 2013 and is expected to be completed in May 2015.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/sod-turned-on-282m-newlands-cross-flyover-and-n11-projects-1.1419707|title=Sod turned on â‚¬282m Newlands cross flyover and N11 projects|work=Irish Times|date=6 June 2013|accessdate=7 June 2013|author=Genevieve Carbery[/tpl]
