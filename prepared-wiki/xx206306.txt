===New Infrastructure===

The school has recently had a multi-purpose gymnasium/hall built on site after decades of lobbying government representatives. The hall was funded as a result of joint funding grants from the Howard Government's Capital Grants Program for Austrralian Schoolshttp://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/school_education/programmes_funding/general_funding/capital_grants/cgp/government/documents/NSW_all_years_gov_schools_pdf.htm | Department of Eductation Science and Training - Grants to NSW Schools 20 Aug 2007 with equivalent funding matched by the Carr/Iemma State government.
Holroyd High School also did well under the federal government's Investing In Our Schools Program, which saw the school exceed its $150,000 entitlement for grants funding which covered library refurbishments, security fencing and sheltered walkways between buildings.

==Friends of Zainab Trust Fund==

When Zainab Kaabi, a refugee from Iran, who spent two years living in Australia, had her temporary protection visa benefits cut, the school's principal, Dorothy Hoddinott, set up a trust fund to support her financially so that she was able to complete her education. She kickstarted the fund with her own personal finances and over time invited more people to contribute. In 2008, Hoddinott was made an officer of the Order of Australia in recognition of her work with the Friends of Zainab Trust fund.http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/giving-all-children-a-chance/2008/06/08/1212863458346.html|SMH - Giving all children a chance
