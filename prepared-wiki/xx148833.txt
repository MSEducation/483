Ralph Stanley "Buck" Buxton (June 7, 1911 - January 6, 1988) was a major league pitcher.

==Early life and career==

Buxton attended high school in Long Beach, California, and played a couple of years in the minors before making his major league debut in 1938 for the Philadelphia Athletics for whom he appeared in 5 games that season. However, it would be a long wait for Buxton as he didn't play another game in the majors until 1949 when he pitched 14 times for the New York Yankees as one of many Oakland Oaks brought to New York by Oaks', then Yankees' manager Casey Stengel.  In between, he pitched for the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League.
