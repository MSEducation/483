In November 2006, Majority Leader Harry Reid announced that Stabenow would leave the caucus secretary position to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton as chair of the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee, charged with "engaging Democratic Senators and community leaders across the country in an active dialogue".[tpl]cite web|url=http://democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/record.cfm?id=265865& |title=Senator Harry Reid, Majority Leader |publisher=Democrats.senate.gov |date=2006-11-14 |accessdate=2010-08-29[/tpl]
Following the withdrawal of Tom Daschle as President Barack Obama's nominee as United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, the National Organization for Women endorsed Stabenow for the position and urged the president to appoint Stabenow, saying, "Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) has long focused on health care as a priority, and with her background as a social worker she is well positioned to take the helm of this agency that is so critical to women and families."[tpl]cite web|last=Davis |first=Teddy |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2009/02/womens-group-pu.html |title=Women's Group Pushes Stabenow for HHS |publisher=ABC News: The Note |date=February 3, 2009 |accessdate=February 20, 2012[/tpl]

In March 2011, the Think Progress website criticized Stabenow for joining “the pro-polluter frenzy sweeping the U.S. Senate, introducing legislation to permanently cripple Clean Air Act rules on global warming pollution.  The legislation in question was the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011 (S.493), which, according to Think Progress, was “being used as a vehicle for senators who wish to prevent regulation of greenhouse pollution from oil refineries, coal-fired power plants, heavy industry, and other major emitters. Stabenow has added her amendment to three others intended to hamstring the Environmental Protection Agency on behalf of carbon polluters.”[tpl]cite web|title=Sen.

==Criticism==

In 2009, Stabenow said, “I have always said that a strong, national fuel-economy standard is what our country needs, not a confusing patch work of different state standards. I am pleased that the Obama administration heeded my call and developed a national standard for our automakers to follow — a clear standard that will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil." However, an article from The Washington Independent states that her voting record "tells a different tale."[tpl]cite web|last=Lillis|first=Mike|title=Stabenow Tries to Rewrite History|url=http://washingtonindependent.com/43582/stabenow-tries-to-rewrite-history|publisher=The Washington Independent|accessdate=21 February 2012[/tpl]  In 2002, she voted against "a proposal that would have forced automakers to create vehicles with fleetwide averages of 40 miles-per-gallon by 2015 — 'a strong, national fuel economy standard'."  Also, in June 2007, she voted against a bill that would mandate "fleet-wide averages of 35 mpg by 2020."
