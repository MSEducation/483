[[X-ray computed tomography]]

CATEGORIES: X-ray computed tomography, 1972 introductions, Medical tests

X-ray computed tomography (x-ray CT) is a technology that uses computer-processed x-rays to produce tomographic images (virtual 'slices') of specific areas of the scanned object, allowing the user to see what is inside it without cutting it open. Digital geometry processing is used to generate a three-dimensional image of the inside of an object from a large series of two-dimensional radiographic images taken around a single axis of rotation.Herman, G. T., Fundamentals of computerized tomography: Image reconstruction from projection, 2nd edition, Springer, 2009 Medical imaging is the most common application of x-ray CT. Its cross-sectional images are used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in various medical disciplines.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/computed+tomography |title=computed tomography – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |work= |accessdate=2009-08-18[/tpl] The rest of this article discusses medical-imaging x-ray CT; industrial applications of x-ray CT are discussed at industrial computed tomography scanning.
As x-ray CT is the most common form of CT in medicine and various other contexts, the term computed tomography alone (or CT) is often used to refer to x-ray CT, although other types exist (such as positron emission tomography PET and single-photon emission computed tomography SPECT). Older and less preferred terms that also refer to x-ray CT are computed axial tomography (CAT scan) and computer-assisted tomography. X-ray CT is a form of radiography, although the word "radiography" used alone usually refers, by wide convention, to non-tomographic radiography.
CT produces a volume of data that can be manipulated in order to demonstrate various bodily structures based on their ability to block the x-ray beam. Although, historically, the images generated were in the axial or transverse plane, perpendicular to the long axis of the body, modern scanners allow this volume of data to be reformatted in various planes or even as volumetric (3D) representations of structures. Although most common in medicine, CT is also used in other fields, such as nondestructive materials testing. Another example is archaeological uses such as imaging the contents of sarcophagi. Individuals responsible for performing CT exams are called radiologic technologists or radiographers[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.arrt.org/Patient-Public/Patient-Page |title=Patient Page | ARRT - The American Registry of Radiologic Technologists |publisher=ARRT |accessdate=2014-01-05[/tpl] and are required to be licensed in most states of the USA.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.asrt.org/main/standards-regulations/state-legislative-affairs/individual-state-licensure-info | title=Individual State Licensure Information | publisher=American Society of Radiologic Technologists | accessdate=19 July 2013[/tpl]

Kidney problems following intravenous contrast agents may also be a concern in some types of studies.

==Diagnostic use==

Since its introduction in the 1970s, CT has become an important tool in medical imaging to supplement x-rays and medical ultrasonography. It has more recently been used for preventive medicine or screening for disease, for example CT colonography for patients with a high risk of colon cancer, or full-motion heart scans for patients with high risk of heart disease. A number of institutions offer full-body scans for the general population although this practice goes against the advice and official position of many professional organizations in the field.CT Screening

===Head===

CT scanning of the head is typically used to detect infarction, tumors, calcifications, haemorrhage and bone trauma. Of the above, hypodense (dark) structures can indicate edema and infarction, hyperdense (bright) structures indicate calcifications and haemorrhage and bone trauma can be seen as disjunction in bone windows. Tumors can be detected by the swelling and anatomical distortion they cause, or by surrounding edema. Ambulances equipped with small bore multi-sliced CT scanners respond to cases involving stroke or head trauma.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head provides superior information as compared to CT scans when seeking information about headache to confirm a diagnosis of neoplasm, vascular disease, posterior cranial fossa lesions, cervicomedullary lesions, or intracranial pressure disorders.[ref][tpl]Citation |author1 = American Headache Society |author1-link = American Headache Society |date = September 2013 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Headache Society |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the ABIM Foundation |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-headache-society/ |accessdate = 10 December 2013[/tpl], which cites

===Lungs===

CT can be used for detecting both acute and chronic changes in the lung parenchyma, that is, the internals of the lungs. It is particularly relevant here because normal two-dimensional X-rays do not show such defects. A variety of techniques are used, depending on the suspected abnormality. For evaluation of chronic interstitial processes (emphysema, fibrosis, and so forth), thin sections with high spatial frequency reconstructions are used; often scans are performed both in inspiration and expiration. This special technique is called high resolution CT. Therefore, it produces a sampling of the lung and not continuous images.
An incidentally found nodule in the absence of symptoms (sometimes referred to as an incidentaloma) may raise concerns that it might represent a tumor, either benign or malignant. Perhaps persuaded by fear, patients and doctors sometimes agree to an intensive schedule of CT scans, sometimes up to every three months and beyond the recommended guidelines, in an attempt to do surveillance on the nodules.[ref][tpl]Citation |author1 = American College of Chest Physicians |author1-link = American College of Chest Physicians |author2 = American Thoracic Society |author2-link = American Thoracic Society |date = September 2013 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American College of Chest Physicians and American Thoracic Society |work = Choosing Wisely: an initiative of the ABIM Foundation |page = |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-college-of-chest-physicians-and-american-thoracic-society/ |accessdate = 6 January 2013[/tpl], which cites

}}[/ref] However, established guidelines advise that patients without a prior history of cancer and whose solid nodules have not grown over a two-year period are unlikely to have any malignant cancer. For this reason, and because no research provides supporting evidence that intensive surveillance gives better outcomes, and because of risks associated with having CT scans, patients should not receive CT screening in excess of those recommended by established guidelines.

===Pulmonary angiogram===

CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is a medical diagnostic test used to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE). It employs computed tomography and an iodine based contrast agent to obtain an image of the pulmonary arteries.

===Cardiac===

With the advent of subsecond rotation combined with multi-slice CT (up to 320-slices), high resolution and high speed can be obtained at the same time, allowing excellent imaging of the coronary arteries (cardiac CT angiography).

===Abdominal and pelvic===

CT is a sensitive method for diagnosis of abdominal diseases. It is used frequently to determine stage of cancer and to follow progress. It is also a useful test to investigate acute abdominal pain.

===Extremities===

CT is often used to image complex fractures, especially ones around joints, because of its ability to reconstruct the area of interest in multiple planes. Fractures, ligamentous injuries and dislocations can easily be recognised with a 0.2 mm resolution.[tpl]cite web| url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00391| title=Ankle Fractures | publisher=American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons| work=orthoinfo.aaos.org| author=| accessdate=2010-05-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/content/full/176/4/979| title=Musculoskeletal Imaging with Multislice CT| author= Buckwalter, Kenneth A. et al. | work=ajronline.org| publisher=American Journal of Roentgenology| date=11 September 2000| accessdate=2010-05-22[/tpl]

==Advantages==

There are several advantages that CT has over traditional 2D medical radiography. First, CT completely eliminates the superimposition of images of structures outside the area of interest. Second, because of the inherent high-contrast resolution of CT, differences between tissues that differ in physical density by less than 1% can be distinguished. Finally, data from a single CT imaging procedure consisting of either multiple contiguous or one helical scan can be viewed as images in the axial, coronal, or sagittal planes, depending on the diagnostic task. This is referred to as multiplanar reformatted imaging.
CT is regarded as a moderate- to high-radiation diagnostic technique. The improved resolution of CT has permitted the development of new investigations, which may have advantages; compared to conventional radiography, for example, CT angiography avoids the invasive insertion of a catheter.  CT Colonography (also known as Virtual Colonoscopy or VC for short) may be as useful as a barium enema for detection of tumors, but may use a lower radiation dose. CT VC is increasingly being used in the UK as a diagnostic test for bowel cancer and can negate the need for a colonoscopy.
The radiation dose for a particular study depends on multiple factors: volume scanned, patient build, number and type of scan sequences, and desired resolution and image quality. In addition, two helical CT scanning parameters that can be adjusted easily and that have a profound effect on radiation dose are tube current and pitch. Computed tomography (CT) scan has been shown to be more accurate than radiographs in evaluating anterior interbody fusion but may still over-read the extent of fusion.Brian R. Subach M.D., F.A.C.S et al."Reliability and accuracy of fine-cut computed tomography scans to determine the status of anterior interbody fusions with metallic cages"

==Adverse effects==

===Cancer===

The radiation used in CT scans can damage body cells, including DNA molecules, which can lead to cancer. A single CT scan will expose a patient to enough radiation to cause cancer, while children who received multiple CT scans were found to be three times more likely to develop leukemia and brain cancer. The Institute of Medicine found that such imaging radiation, along with hormone therapy, were, until recent years, the "leading" causes of breast cancer." The most common cancers caused by radiation exposure are thought to be lung cancer, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, stomach cancer and leukemia.
According to the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, between the 1980s and 2006, the use of CT scans has increased sixfold (600%). The radiation doses received from CT scans are 100 to 1,000 times higher than conventional X-rays.Redberg, Rita F., and Smith-Bindman, Rebecca. "We Are Giving Ourselves Cancer", New York Times, Jan. 30, 2014 A study by a New York hospital found that nearly a third of its patients who underwent multiple scans received the equivalent of 5,000 chest X-rays.
Some experts note that CT scans are known to be "overused," and "there is distressingly little evidence of better health outcomes associated with the current high rate of scans."
Early estimates of harm from CT are partly based on similar radiation exposures experienced by those present during the atomic bomb explosions in Japan during the second world war and those of nuclear industry workers. A more recent study by the National Cancer Institute in 2009, based on scans made in 2007, estimated that 29,000 excess cancer cases and 14,500 excess deaths would be caused over the lifetime of the patients. Some experts project that in the future, between three and five percent of all cancers would result from medical imaging.
A person's age plays a significant role in the subsequent risk of cancer. Estimated lifetime cancer mortality risks from an abdominal CT of a 1-year-old is 0.1% or 1:1000 scans. The risk for someone who is 40 years old is half that of someone who is 20 years old with substantially less risk in the elderly. 
The International Commission on Radiological Protection estimates that the risk to a fetus being exposed to 10 mGy (a unit of radiation exposure, see Gray (unit)) increases the rate of cancer before 20 years of age from 0.03% to 0.04% (for reference a CT pulmonary angiogram exposes a fetus to 4 mGy). A 2012 review did not find an association between medical radiation and cancer risk in children noting however the existence of limitations in the evidences over which the review is based.[tpl]cite journal|last=Baysson|first=H|coauthors=Etard, C; Brisse, HJ; Bernier, MO|title=radiation exposure in children and cancer risk: current knowledge and perspectives.|journal=Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie|date=January 2012|volume=19|issue=1|pages=64–73|pmid=22130615|doi=10.1016/j.arcped.2011.10.023[/tpl]
CT scans can be performed with different settings for lower exposure in children with most manufacturers of CT scans as of 2007 having this function built in. Furthermore, certain conditions can require children to be exposed to multiple CT scans. Studies support informing parents of the risks of pediatric CT scanning.[tpl]cite journal|author=Larson DB, Rader SB, Forman HP, Fenton LZ |title=Informing parents about CT radiation exposure in children: it's OK to tell them |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol|volume=189 |issue=2 |pages=271–5 | date=August 2007 |pmid=17646450|doi=10.2214/AJR.07.2248|url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17646450[/tpl]

===Contrast===

In the United States half of CT scans involve intravenously injected radiocontrast agents. The most common reactions from these agents are mild, including nausea, vomiting and an itching rash; however, more severe reactions may occur.[tpl]cite journal|last=Christiansen|first=C|title=X-ray contrast media – an overview.|journal=Toxicology|date=2005-04-15|volume=209|issue=2|pages=185–7|pmid=15767033|doi=10.1016/j.tox.2004.12.020[/tpl] Overall reactions occur in 1 to 3% with nonionic contrast and 4 to 12% of people with ionic contrast. Skin rashes may appear within a week to 3% of people.
The old radiocontrast agents caused anaphylaxis in 1% of cases while the newer, lower-osmolar agents cause reactions in 0.01–0.04% of cases.[tpl]cite journal|last=Drain|first=KL|coauthors=Volcheck, GW|title=Preventing and managing drug-induced anaphylaxis.|journal=Drug safety : an international journal of medical toxicology and drug experience|year=2001|volume=24|issue=11|pages=843–53|pmid=11665871|doi=10.2165/00002018-200124110-00005[/tpl] Death occurs in about two to 30 people per 1,000,000 administrations with newer agents being safer.[tpl]cite journal |author=Wang H, Wang HS, Liu ZP |title=Agents that induce pseudo-allergic reaction |journal=Drug Discov Ther |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=211–9 | date=October 2011 |pmid=22466368 |doi= 10.5582/ddt.2011.v5.5.211|url=[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=editor|first=Mariana C. Castells,|title=Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions|publisher=Humana Press|location=New York|isbn=9781603279505|page=187|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=bEvnfm7V-LIC&pg=PA187[/tpl] When deaths do occur it is more typically in those who are female, elderly or in poor health and is secondary to either anaphylaxis or acute renal failure.[tpl]cite journal|last=Namasivayam|first=S|coauthors=Kalra, MK; Torres, WE; Small, WC|title=Adverse reactions to intravenous iodinated contrast media: a primer for radiologists.|journal=Emergency radiology|date=Jul 2006|volume=12|issue=5|pages=210–5|pmid=16688432|doi=10.1007/s10140-006-0488-6[/tpl]
The contrast agent may induce contrast-induced nephropathy.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hasebroock|first=KM|coauthors=Serkova, NJ|title=Toxicity of MRI and CT contrast agents.|journal=Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology|date=April 2009|volume=5|issue=4|pages=403–16|pmid=19368492|doi=10.1517/17425250902873796[/tpl] This occurs in 2 to 7% of people who receive these agents, with greater risk in those who have preexisting renal insufficiency, preexisting diabetes, or reduced intravascular volume. People with mild kidney impairment are usually advised to ensure full hydration for several hours before and after the injection. For moderate kidney failure, the use of  iodinated contrast should be avoided; this may mean using an alternative technique instead of CT. Those with severe renal failure requiring dialysis require less strict precautions, as their kidneys have so little function remaining that any further damage would not be noticeable and the dialysis will remove the contrast agent; it is normally recommended, however, to arrange dialysis as soon as possible following contrast administration to minimize any adverse effects of the contrast.
In addition to the use of intravenous contrast, orally administered contrast agents are frequently used when examining the abdomen. These are frequently the same as the intravenous contrast agents, merely diluted to approximately 10% of the concentration. However, oral alternatives to iodinated contrast exist, such as very dilute (0.5–1% w/v) barium sulfate suspensions. Dilute barium sulfate has the advantage that it does not cause allergic-type reactions or kidney failure, but cannot be used in patients with suspected bowel perforation or suspected bowel injury, as leakage of barium sulfate from damaged bowel can cause fatal peritonitis.

==Scan dose==

The table reports average radiation exposures, however, there can be a wide variation in radiation doses between similar scan types, where the highest dose could be as much as 22 times higher than the lowest dose.  A typical plain film x-ray involves radiation dose of 0.01 to 0.15 mGy, while a typical CT can involve 10–20 mGy for specific organs, and can go up to 80 mGy for certain specialized CT scans.[tpl]cite journal|last=Hall|first=EJ|coauthors=Brenner, DJ|title=Cancer risks from diagnostic radiology.|journal=The British journal of radiology|date=May 2008|volume=81|issue=965|pages=362–78|pmid=18440940|doi=10.1259/bjr/01948454[/tpl]
For purposes of comparison, the world average dose rate from naturally occurring sources of background radiation is 2.4 mSv per year, equal for practical purposes in this application to 2.4 mGy per year.[tpl]cite journal|author=Cuttler JM, Pollycove M |title=Nuclear energy and health: and the benefits of low-dose radiation hormesis |journal=Dose Response |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=52–89 |year=2009 |pmid=19343116 |pmc=2664640|doi=10.2203/dose-response.08-024.Cuttler[/tpl] While there is some variation, most people (99%) received less than 7 mSv per year as background radiation.[tpl]cite book|last=Poston|first=edited by Michael T. Ryan, John W.|title=A half century of health physics|year=2005|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=9780781769341|page=164|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=qCebxPjdSBUC&pg=PA164[/tpl] Medical imaging as of 2007 accounted for half of the radiation exposure of those in the United States with CT scans making up two thirds of this amount. In the United Kingdom it accounts for 15% of radiation exposure. The average radiation dose from medical sources is ~0.6 mSv per person globally as of 2007. Those in the nuclear industry in the United States are limited to doses of 50 mSv a year and 100 mSv every 5 years.

===Radiation dose units===

The radiation dose reported in the gray or mGy unit is proportional to the amount of energy that the irradiated body part is expected to absorb, and the physical effect (such as DNA double strand breaks) on the cells' chemical bonds by x-ray radiation is proportional to that energy.[tpl]cite journal |author=Polo SE, Jackson SP |title=Dynamics of DNA damage response proteins at DNA breaks: a focus on protein modifications |journal=Genes Dev. |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=409–33 | date=March 2011 |pmid=21363960 |pmc=3049283 |doi=10.1101/gad.2021311 |url=[/tpl]
The sievert unit is used in the report of the effective dose. The sievert unit in the context of CT scans, does not correspond to the actual radiation dose that the scanned body part absorbs, but rather to another radiation dose of another scenario, in which the whole body absorbs the other radiation dose, and where the other radiation dose is of a magnitude that is estimated to have the same probability to induce cancer as the CT scan.The Measurement, Reporting, and Management of Radiation Dose in CT "It is a single dose parameter that reflects the risk of a nonuniform exposure in terms of an equivalent whole-body exposure." Thus, as is shown in the table above, the actual radiation that is absorbed by a scanned body part is often much larger than the effective dose suggests. A specific measure, termed the computed tomography dose index (CTDI), is commonly used as an estimate of the radiation absorbed dose for tissue within the scan region, and is automatically computed by medical CT scanners.
The equivalent dose is the effective dose of a case, in which the whole body would actually absorb the same radiation dose, and the sievert unit is used in its report. In the case of non-uniform radiation, or radiation given to only part of the body, which is common for CT examinations, using the local equivalent dose alone would overstate the biological risks to the entire organism.

===Excess doses===

In October, 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated an investigation of brain perfusion CT (PCT) scans, based on overdoses of radiation caused by incorrect settings at one particular facility for this particular type of CT scan. Over 256 patients over an 18 month period were exposed, over 40% lost patches of hair, and prompted the editorial to call for increased CT quality assurance programs, while also noting that "while unnecessary radiation exposure should be avoided, a medically needed CT scan obtained with appropriate acquisition parameter has benefits that outweigh the radiation risks."[tpl]cite journal|last=Furlow|first=B|title=Radiation dose in computed tomography.|journal=Radiologic technology|date=May–Jun 2010|volume=81|issue=5|pages=437–50|pmid=20445138|url=http://www.northernradiology.com/assets/Imaging%20Services/Images/furlow%20ct%20scan%20info.pdf[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Wintermark M, Lev MH|title=FDA investigates the safety of brain perfusion CT |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol|volume=31|issue=1 |pages=2–3 | date=January 2010 |pmid=19892810 |doi=10.3174/ajnr.A1967|url=[/tpl] Similar problems have been reported at other centers. These incidents are believed to be due to human error.

===Campaigns===

In response to increased concern by the public and the ongoing progress of best practices, The Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging was formed within the Society for Pediatric Radiology. In concert with The American Society of Radiologic Technologists, The American College of Radiology and The American Association of Physicists in Medicine, the Society for Pediatric Radiology developed and launched the Image Gently Campaign which is designed to maintain high quality imaging studies while using the lowest doses and best radiation safety practices available on pediatric patients.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.pedrad.org/associations/5364/ig/?page=365 | title=Image Gently | publisher=The Alliance for Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging | accessdate=19 July 2013[/tpl] This initiative has been endorsed and applied by a growing list of various professional medical organizations around the world and has received support and assistance from companies that manufacture equipment used in Radiology.
Following upon the success of the Image Gently campaign, the American College of Radiology, the Radiological Society of North America, the American Association of Physicists in Medicine and the American Society of Radiologic Technologists have launched a similar campaign to address this issue in the adult population called Image Wisely.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.imagewisely.org/ | title=Image Wisely | publisher=Joint Task Force on Adult Radiation Protection | accessdate=19 July 2013[/tpl]
The World Health Organization and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of the United Nations have also been working in this area and have ongoing projects designed to broaden best practices and lower patient radiation dose.[tpl]cite web | url=http://new.paho.org/hq10/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3365&Itemid=2164 | title=Optimal levels of radiation for patients | publisher=World Health Organization | accessdate=19 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/about/GI_TM_Report_2008_Dec.pdf | title=Global Initiative on Radiation Safety in Healthcare Settings | publisher=World Health Organization | accessdate=19 July 2013[/tpl]

==Prevalence==

Usage of CT has increased dramatically over the last two decades. An estimated 72 million scans were performed in the United States in 2007. Of these, six to eleven percent are done in children, an increase of seven to eightfold from 1980. Similar increases have been seen in Europe and Asia.  In Calgary, Canada 12.1% of people who present to the emergency with an urgent complaint received a CT scan, most commonly either of the head or of the abdomen.  The percentage who received CT, however, varied markedly by the emergency physician who saw them from 1.8% to 25%.[tpl]cite journal |author=Andrew Skelly |title=CT ordering all over the map |journal=The Medical Post |date=Aug 3, 2010 |pmid= |doi= |url=[/tpl] In the emergency department in the United States, CT or MRI imaging is done in 15% of people who present with injuries as of 2007 (up from 6% in 1998).[tpl]cite journal |author=Korley FK, Pham JC, Kirsch TD |title=Use of advanced radiology during visits to US emergency departments for injury-related conditions, 1998–2007 |journal=JAMA |volume=304 |issue=13 |pages=1465–71 | date=October 2010 |pmid=20924012 |doi=10.1001/jama.2010.1408 |url=[/tpl]
The increased use of CT scans has been the greatest in two fields: screening of adults (screening CT of the lung in smokers, virtual colonoscopy, CT cardiac screening, and whole-body CT in asymptomatic patients) and CT imaging of children. Shortening of the scanning time to around 1 second, eliminating the strict need for the subject to remain still or be sedated, is one of the main reasons for the large increase in the pediatric population (especially for the diagnosis of appendicitis). As of 2007 in the United States a proportion of CT scans are performed unnecessarily.[tpl]cite journal |author= Semelka, RC; Armao, DM; Elias, J, Jr.; Huda, W.| date=May 2007 |title= Imaging strategies to reduce the risk of radiation in CT studies, including selective substitution with MRI.|journal= J Magn Reson Imaging |publisher=  |pmid= 17457809|volume= 25 |issue= 5 |pages= 900–9 |url=|doi=10.1002/jmri.20895[/tpl] Some estimates place this number at 30%. There are a number of reasons for this including: legal concerns, financial incentives, and desire by the public. For example, some healthy people avidly pay to receive full-body CT scans as screening, but it is not at all clear that the benefits outweigh the risks and costs, because deciding whether and how to treat incidentalomas is fraught with complexity, radiation exposure is cumulative and not negligible, and the money for the scans involves opportunity cost (it may have been more effectively spent on more targeted screening or other health care strategies).

==Process==

X-ray slice data is generated using an X-ray source that rotates around the object; X-ray sensors are positioned on the opposite side of the circle from the X-ray source. The earliest sensors were scintillation detectors, with photomultiplier tubes excited by (typically) cesium iodide crystals. Cesium iodide was replaced during the 1980s by ion chambers containing high-pressure Xenon gas. These systems were in turn replaced by scintillation systems based on photodiodes instead of photomultipliers and modern scintillation materials (for example rare earth garnet or rare earth oxide ceramics) with more desirable characteristics.
Initial machines would rotate the X-ray source and detectors around a stationary object. Following a complete rotation, the object would be moved along its axis, and the next rotation started. Newer machines permitted continuous rotation with the object to be imaged slowly and smoothly slid through the X-ray ring. These are called helical or spiral CT machines. A subsequent development of helical CT was multi-slice (or multi-detector) CT; instead of a single row of detectors, multiple rows of detectors are used effectively capturing multiple cross-sections simultaneously. Systems with a very large number of detector rows, such that the z-axis coverage is comparable to the xy-axis coverage are often termed ''cone beam CT', due to the shape of the X-ray beam (strictly, the beam is pyramidal in shape, rather than conical).
In conventional CT machines, an X-ray tube and detector are physically rotated behind a circular shroud (see the image above right). An alternative, short lived design, known as electron beam tomography (EBT), used electromagnetic deflection of an electron beam within a very large conical X-ray tube and a stationary array of detectors to achieve very high temporal resolution, for imaging of rapidly moving structures, for example the coronary arteries. Cone-beam CT functionality is also an increasingly common function found in medical fluoroscopy equipment; by rotating the fluoroscope around the patient, a geometry similar to CT can be obtained, and by treating the 2D X-ray detector in a manner similar to a CT detector with a massive number of rows, it is possible to reconstruct a 3D volume from a single rotation using suitable software.
