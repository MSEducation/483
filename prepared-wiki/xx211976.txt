The Samsung Omnia comes with the following applications preinstalled to make its GUI and its functions distinguishable from other Windows Mobile 6–based smartphones:
All these applications have the ability to be controlled by sliding the finger across the screen. The third Today Screen has gained interest because of its control method. It uses about a fourth of the screen on the left side to hold a bar of widgets that can be scrolled up and down. The rest of the screen is customizable, as widgets can be pulled out of the sidebar and onto the main screen to be expanded for quick use.

The Samsung Omnia has a 5.0-megapixel camera with autofocus and LED flash. Additionally Samsung Omnia supports VGA resolution video recording with about 20 - 25 frame/s. Samsung Omnia's front-facing 3G camera has a resolution of 0.3 megapixels (VGA).

==Japanese edition (930SC)==

In Japan, SoftBank Mobile announced that the Samsung Omnia will be sold as 930SC in November 2008. However, it adopted the proprietary operating system instead of Windows Mobile. It has a [tpl]convert|3.3|in|mm|adj=on[/tpl] Wide VGA LCD and 1seg tuner, but GPS has been excluded. It is also available for SoftBank Mobile's own mobile Internet service.

==North American edition (SCH-i910)==

The Samsung Omnia has been released under the version name SCH-i910 in North America, with Verizon Wireless as the network operator. The SCH-i910 has a speaker on the back and has CDMA2000 instead of the GSM radio. The SCH-i910 still runs Windows Mobile 6.1 along with some added software such as Visual Voicemail. Most other features stay the same as the SCH-i900. Most noticeably, the i910 does not include the secondary VGA camera on the front; presumably due to the lack of support for video calls in North America. The North American version of the phone uses the same 624 MHz chip used by other versions. This has been confirmed by numerous North American users through the "settings" menu on the Omnia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php?t=1465998&page=2&pp=15 |title=Verizon Verizon Samsung Omnia - MSM7500 400mhz CPU instead of Marvell 624mhz CPU = SUCKS - Page 2 |publisher=Howardforums.com |date=2008-11-30 |accessdate=2013-10-04[/tpl]
