Indianapolis 500 Legends is a racing game recounting the history of the Indianapolis 500.  Players take on the roles of various famous racers between 1961 and 1971, completing tasks such as overtaking a specified number of cars or qualifying with a good enough time. Some missions will change the course of history, such as guiding Parnelli Jones to victory in 1967 when historically, in the 197th lap, a faulty bearing ground his car to a halt.  The option will also be given to race the full 200 laps.[tpl]Cite news|last=Shepperd|first=Chris|author-link=Chris Shepperd|title=Legends of the Indy 500|newspaper=Nintendo Power V217|pages=54–55|year=2007|date=July 2007|url=http://www.nintendopower.com/home|format=[tpl]dead link|date=April 2009[/tpl] – Scholar search|postscript=[/tpl]
