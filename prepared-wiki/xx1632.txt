Coronation Street is a British  soap opera that was first broadcast on Granada Television on 9 December 1960. It was soon syndicated on other ITV franchises. The programme centres on the lives of the residents of Coronation Street in the fictional town of Weatherfield, a town based on Salford,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a365197/coronation-street-writer-defends-salford-references.html |title='Coronation Street' writer defends Salford references - Coronation Street News - Soaps |publisher=Digital Spy |date=11 February 2012 |accessdate=27 November 2013[/tpl] in its terraced houses, cafe, corner shop, newsagents, textile factory and the Rovers Return pub. In the show's fictional history, the street was built in the early 1900s and named in honour of the coronation of King Edward VII.
The programme was devised in 1960 by scriptwriter Tony Warren at Granada Television in Manchester. Warren's initial kitchen sink drama proposal was rejected by the station's founder Sidney Bernstein but he was persuaded by producer Harry Elton to produce the programme for thirteen pilot episodes. It was first broadcast on 9 December 1960 and within six months had become the most-watched programme on British television. It has been one of the most financially lucrative programmes on British commercial television, underpinning the success of Granada Television and ITV.
Coronation Street is made by Granada Television at MediaCityUK in Greater Manchester. It is shown in all ITV regions as well as internationally. On 17 September 2010, it became the world's longest-running TV soap opera in production.[tpl]Cite news|title=Coronation Street breaks two world records|first=Matthew|last=Hemley|work=The Stage|date=24 September 2010|accessdate=26 September 2010|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/29700/coronation-street-breaks-two-world-records[/tpl] Coronation Street is noted for its depiction of a down-to-earth working class community combined with light-hearted humour and strong characters.Little, Daran (1998).

==History==

===1960s===

The first episode was aired on 9 December 1960 and was not initially a critical success; Daily Mirror columnist Ken Iriwin claimed the series would only last three weeks. Granada Television initially commissioned only 13 episodes and some inside the company doubted the show would last beyond its planned production run.Little. (1995) p.10. Despite the criticism, viewers were immediately drawn to the serial, won over by Coronation Street's 'ordinary' characters.Little. (1995) p.26. The programme also made use of Northern English language and dialect; affectionate local terms like "eh, chuck?", "nowt" ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|n|aʊ|t[/tpl], means nothing), and "by 'eck!" became widely heard on British television for the first time.[tpl]cite book |first=Jeffrey |last=Miller |editor=Graham Nown |title=Street Talk: The Language of Coronation Street |publisher=Ward Lock|year=1986 |location=London|isbn= 978-0-7063-6514-6[/tpl]
Early episodes told the story of student Kenneth Barlow (William Roache), who had won a place at university and thus found his working-class background something of an embarrassment.TV Times. (1960) p.8. The character was one of the few to have experienced life 'outside' of Coronation Street, and in some ways predicts the growth of globalisation and the decline of similar communities. In a 1961 episode, Barlow declares: "You can't go on just thinking about your own street these days. We're living with people on the other side of the world. There's more to worry about than Elsie Tanner and her boyfriends."[tpl]cite video | people = Granada Television | title =Coronation Street 1961 | medium = Television serial drama  | publisher = Granada | location =Quay Street, Manchester | date =8 November 1961 [/tpl] Roache was the only remaining member of the original cast until Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie) returned on 12 May 2011, and is currently the longest-serving actor in Coronation Street and in British and global soap overall.
Also at the centre of many early stories was Ena Sharples (Violet Carson), caretaker of the Glad Tidings Mission Hall, and her friends: timid Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant) and bespectacled Martha Longhurst (Lynne Carol). The trio were likened to the Greek chorus, and the three witches in William Shakespeare's Macbeth, as they would sit in the snug bar of the Rovers Return, passing judgement over family, neighbours and frequently each other.Tinker. p.31. Headstrong Ena often clashed with Elsie Tanner, whom she believed espoused a dauntlessly loose set of morals. Elsie resented Ena's interference and gossip, which most of the time had little basis in reality.
In April 1961, Jed Stone made his first appearance and returned the following year in 1962. He left in 1963, but returned three years later in 1966. He left again and then returned 42 years later in 2008.
In March 1961, Coronation Street reached No.1 in the television ratings and remained there for the rest of the year. Earlier in 1961, a Television Audience Measurement (TAM) showed that 75% of available viewers (15 million) tuned into Corrie and by 1964 the programme had over 20 million regular viewers, with ratings peaking on 2 December 1964, at 21.36 million viewers.Little. (1995) p.35.[tpl]cite web|title=BFI Most Watched 1960s|work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/mostwatched/1960s.html|accessdate=29 January 2007[/tpl]
Storylines throughout the decade included: a mystery poison-pen letter received by Elsie Tanner, the 1962 marriage of Ken Barlow and Valerie Tatlock, the death of Martha Longhurst in 1964, the birth of the Barlow twins in 1965, Elsie Tanner's wedding to Steve Tanner as well as a train crashing from the viaduct (both in 1967), the murder of Steve Tanner in 1968, and a coach crash in 1969.
In spite of rising popularity with viewers, Coronation Street was criticised by some for its outdated portrayal of the urban working class, and its representation of a community that was a nostalgic fantasy.[tpl]cite web|first=Robert C| last=Allen|title=Soap Opera|work=The Museum of Broadcast Communications |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/soapopera/soapopera.htm|accessdate=7 January 2007[/tpl] After the first episode in 1960, the Daily Mirror printed: "The programme is doomed from the outset ... For there is little reality in this new serial, which apparently, we have to suffer twice a week."Tinker. pp.12–13. By 1967, critics were suggesting that the programme no longer reflected life in 1960s Britain, but reflected how life was in the 1950s. Granada hurried to update the programme, with the hope of introducing more issue-driven stories, including Lucille Hewitt becoming addicted to drugs, Jerry Booth being in a storyline about homosexuality, Emily Nugent having an out of wedlock child, and introducing a black family, but all of these ideas were dropped for fear of upsetting viewers.Little. (2000) p.45.

===1970s===

The show's production team was tested when many core cast members left the programme in the early 1970s. When Arthur Leslie died suddenly in 1970, his character, Rovers' landlord Jack Walker, died with him.Little. (2000) p.67. Anne Reid quit as Valerie Barlow, and was killed off in 1971, electrocuting herself with a faulty hairdryer. Ratings reached a low of 8 million in February 1973, Pat Phoenix quit as Elsie Tanner, Violet Carson (Ena Sharples) was written out for most of the year due to illness, and Doris Speed (Annie Walker) took two months' leave due to bereavement..Little. (2000) p.86. ITV's other flagship soap opera Crossroads saw a marked increase in viewers at this time, as its established cast, such as Meg Richardson (Noele Gordon), grew in popularity. These sudden departures forced the writing team to quickly develop characters who had previously stood in the background. The roles of Bet Lynch, Ivy Tilsley (Lynne Perrie), Deirdre Hunt (Anne Kirkbride), Rita Littlewood (Barbara Knox) and Mavis Riley (Thelma Barlow) were built up between 1972 and 1973 with characters such as Gail Potter (Helen Worth), Blanche Hunt (Patricia Cutts and Maggie Jones) and Vera Duckworth (Elizabeth Dawn) first appearing in 1974. These characters would remain at the centre of the programme for many years.Little. (2000) p.93.Little. (2000) p.79.
Comic storylines had been popular in the series in the 1960s but had become sparse during the early 1970s. These were re-introduced by new producer Bill Podmore who joined the series in 1976. He had worked on Granada comedy productions prior to his appointment.Little. (2000) p.107. Stan and Hilda Ogden were often at the centre of overtly funny storylines, with other comic characters including Eddie Yeats (Geoffrey Hughes), Fred Gee (Fred Feast) and Jack Duckworth (William Tarmey) all making their first appearances during the decade.
In 1976, Pat Phoenix returned to her role as Elsie Tanner and, after a spate of ill health, Violet Carson returned on a more regular basis as Ena.Little. (1995) p.131. Coronation Street's stalwart cast slotted back into the programme alongside the newcomers, examining new relationships between characters of different ages and backgrounds: Eddie Yeats became the Ogdens' lodger, Gail Potter and Suzie Birchall moved in with Elsie, Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) arrived in 1976 as the tough factory boss, and Annie Walker reigned at the Rovers with her trio of staff Bet Lynch, Betty Turpin and Fred Gee.
Storylines throughout the decade included: a warehouse fire in 1975, the birth of Tracy Langton in 1977, the murder of Ernest Bishop in 1978, a lorry crashing into the Rovers Return in 1979, and the marriage of Brian Tilsley and Gail Potter (also in 1979).
For eleven weeks, between August and October 1979, industrial action forced Coronation Street and the whole of the ITV network (apart from the Channel Islands) off the air. When ITV did return, its first evening schedule included a special "catch-up" edition of Coronation Street, in which storylines which would have taken place during the strike were explained away in the form of a narrative chat between Len Fairclough and Bet Lynch. For several weeks the channel had very few fresh episodes to show, and episodes of the game show 3-2-1 were screened in its place. Coronation Street returned to ITV screens at a regular time late in 1979.
Coronation Street had little competition within its prime time slot, and certain critics suggested that the programme had grown complacent, moving away from socially viable storylines and again presenting a dated view of working class life.Liddement. (2004)

===1980s===

Between 1980 and 1989, Coronation Street underwent some of the biggest changes since its launch. By May 1984, Ken Barlow stood as the only original cast member, after the departures of Ena Sharples (in 1980), Annie Walker (in 1983), Elsie Tanner (in 1984) and Albert Tatlock (also 1984).Little. (2000) p.134. and pp.153–59. In 1983, antihero Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson), one of the show's central male characters since 1961, was killed off, and in 1984, Stan Ogden (Bernard Youens) died.Little. (2000) pp.153–59. While the press predicted the end of Corrie, H. V. Kershaw declared that "There are no stars in Coronation Street."Tinker. p.62. Writers drew on the show's many archetypes, with previously established characters stepping into the roles left by the original cast.Little. (1995) p.172. Phyllis Pearce (Jill Summers) was hailed as the new Ena Sharples in 1982, the Duckworths moved into No.9 in 1983 and slipped into the role once held by the Ogdens, while Percy Sugden (Bill Waddington) appeared in 1983 and took over the grumpy war veteran role from Albert Tatlock.Little. (1995) p.162.Little. (1995) p.171. The question of who would take over the Rovers Return after Annie Walker's 1983 exit was answered in 1985 when Bet Lynch (who also mirrored the vulnerability and strength of Elsie Tanner) was installed as landlady. In 1983, Shirley Armitage became the first major black character in her role as machinist at Baldwin's Casuals.
Ken Barlow married Deirdre Langton on 27 July 1981. The episode was watched by over 24 million viewers – more ITV viewers than the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana two days later.[tpl]cite web|work=Icons – a portrait of England|title=Soaps through the decades |url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/the-archers/features/soaps-a-history|accessdate=27 March 2007[/tpl] The 1980s also saw the cementing of relationships between established characters: Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley) married Audrey Potter (Sue Nicholls) in 1985, Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) married Sally Seddon (Sally Dynevor) in 1986.Little. (1995) p.174, pp.182–83. Bet Lynch married Alec Gilroy in 1987 and the marriages of Ivy Tilsley and Don Brennan, and Derek Wilton and Mavis Riley took place in 1988.Little. (1995) pp.184, 189.
The arrival of Channel 4 and its edgy new soap opera Brookside in 1982 was one of the biggest changes for Coronation Street. Unlike Coronation Street which had a very nostalgic view of working-class life, Brookside brought together working and middle-class families in a more contemporary environment. The dialogue often included expletives and the stories were more hard-hitting and of the current Zeitgeist. Whereas stories at this time in Coronation Street were largely about family affairs, Brookside concentrated on social affairs such as industrial action, unemployment and the black market. The BBC also introduced a new prime time soap opera, EastEnders in 1985.Little. (2000) p.165. Like Brookside, EastEnders had a more gritty premise than Coronation Street, although unlike Brookside it tended to steer clear of blue language and politicised stories.
While ratings for Coronation Street remained consistent throughout the decade, EastEnders regularly obtained higher viewing figures.Little. (2000) p.170. With prime time competition, Corrie was again seen as being old fashioned, with the introduction of the 'normal' Clayton family in 1985 being a failure with viewers. Between 1988 and 1989, many aspects of the show were modernised by new producer David Liddiment. A new exterior set had been built in 1982 and in 1989 it was redeveloped to include new houses and shops. Production techniques were also changed, with a new studio being built and the inclusion of more location filming, which had moved from being shot on film to videotape in 1988.Little. (2000) p.188. New pressures also saw introduction of the third weekly episode on 20 October 1989, broadcast each Friday at 19:30.
The 1980s featured some of the most prominent storylines in the programme's history, such as Deirdre Barlow's affair with Mike Baldwin in 1983, the first soap storyline to receive widespread media attention.Little. (1995) p.165. The feud between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin would continue for many years, with Mike even marrying Ken's daughter, Susan. In 1986, there was a fire at the Rovers Return, which attracted an audience of just under 27 million, and between 1986 and 1989, the story of Rita Fairclough's psychological abuse at the hands of Alan Bradley (Mark Eden), and his subsequent death under the wheels of a Blackpool tram, was played out. The episode where Alan met his death under the tram gave Coronation Street its highest ever viewing figures of 26.9 million, and is still the 9th most watched UK broadcast of all time. Other stories included: the birth of Nicky Tilsley in 1980, Elsie Tanner's departure and Stan Ogden's funeral in 1984, the birth of Sarah-Louise Tilsley in 1987, and Brian Tilsley's murder in 1989.
New characters were introduced, such as Terry Duckworth (Nigel Pivaro), Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy), Martin Platt (Sean Wilson), Reg Holdsworth (Ken Morley) and the McDonald family; one of whom, Simon Gregson, started on the show as Steve McDonald a week after his 15th birthday, and has been in the programme ever since.

===1990s===

In spite of updated sets and production changes, Coronation Street still received criticism. In 1992, chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Council, Lord Rees-Mogg, criticised the low-representation of ethnic minorities and the programme's portrayal of the cosy familiarity of a bygone era. Some newspapers ran headlines such as "Coronation Street shuts out blacks" (The Times) and "'Put colour in t'Street" (Daily Mirror).Little. (1995) p.217. Patrick Stoddart of The Times wrote: "The millions who watch Coronation Street – and who will continue to do so despite Lord Rees-Mogg – know real life when they see it ... in the most confident and accomplished soap opera television has ever seen".Little. (2000) p.205.'' Black and Asian characters had appeared, but it was not until 1999 that the show featured its first regular non-white family, the Desai family.
New characters Des and Steph Barnes moved into one of the new houses in 1990, being dubbed by the media as 'Yuppies'.Little. (2000) p.194. Raquel Wolstenhulme (Sarah Lancashire) first appeared in 1991 and went on to become one of the most popular characters. The McDonald family were developed and the fiery relationships between Liz, Jim, Steve and Andy interested viewers.Little. (2000) p.199.Little. (1995) p.211. Other newcomers were Maud Grimes (Elizabeth Bradley), Roy Cropper (David Neilson), Judy and Gary Mallett, Fred Elliot (John Savident) and Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold). The amount of slapstick and physical humour in storylines increased during the 1990s, with comic characters such as Reg Holdsworth and his water bed.Little. (1995) p.220.
Storylines in the early part of the decade included: the death of newborn Katie McDonald in 1992, Mike Baldwin's wedding to Alma Sedgewick (Amanda Barrie) in 1992, Tommy Duckworth being sold by his father Terry in 1993, Deirdre Barlow's marriage to Moroccan Samir Rachid, and the rise of Tanya Pooley (Eva Pope) between 1993 and 1994.
Key character Bet Lynch departed in 1995 when her portrayer Julie Goodyear decided to leave. Bet would subsequently make brief return appearances in 1999, 2002 and 2003.
In 1997, Brian Park took over as producer, with the idea of promoting young characters as opposed to the older cast. On his first day he axed the characters of Derek Wilton, Don Brennan, Percy Sugden, Bill Webster, Billy Williams and Maureen Holdsworth.Little. (2000) p.235. Thelma Barlow, who played Derek's wife Mavis, was angered by the sacking of her co-star and resigned, while the production team also lost some of its key writers when Barry Hill, Adele Rose and Julian Roach all resigned.
In line with Park's suggestion, younger characters were introduced: Nick Tilsley was recast, played by Adam Rickitt, single mother Zoe Tattersall (Joanne Froggatt) first appeared, and the Battersbys moved into No.5. Storylines focussed on tackling 'issues', such as drug dealers, eco-warriors, religious cults and a transsexual woman.Little. (2000) p.241. Park quit in 1998, after deciding that he had done what he intended to do; he maintained that his biggest achievement was the introduction of Hayley Patterson (Julie Hesmondhalgh), the first transsexual character in a British soap.
Some viewers were alienated by the new-look Coronation Street, and the sections of the media voiced their disapproval. Having received criticism of being too out of touch, Corrie now struggled to emulate the more modern Brookside and EastEnders. In the Daily Mirror, Victor Lewis-Smith wrote: "Apparently it doesn't matter that this is a first-class soap opera, superbly scripted and flawlessly performed by a seasoned repertory company."
One of Coronation Street's best known storylines took place in March/April 1998, with Deirdre Rachid being wrongfully imprisoned after a relationship with con-man Jon Lindsay. 19 million viewers watched Deirdre being sent to prison, and 'Free the Weatherfield One' campaigns sprung up in a media frenzy. The then Prime Minister Tony Blair even passed comment on Deirdre's sentencing in Parliament.[tpl]cite news|title=PM supports Weatherfield One|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/71934.stm|date=31 March 1998|accessdate=7 January 2007[/tpl] Deirdre was freed after three weeks, with Granada stating that they had always intended for her to be released, in spite of the media interest.

===2000s===

On 8 December 2000, the show celebrated its fortieth year by broadcasting a live, hour-long episode. The Prince of Wales appeared as himself in an ITV News bulletin report.[tpl]cite news | work=BBC News| title= Prince stars in live soap |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1061585.stm| accessdate=2 September 2006 | date=8 December 2000[/tpl] Earlier in the year, 13-year-old Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien) had become pregnant and given birth to a baby girl, Bethany, on 4 June. The episode where Gail was told of her daughter's pregnancy was watched by 15 million viewers.Little. (2000) p.256. In September 2000, Mike Baldwin married Linda Sykes but shortly afterwards, his drunken son Mark confessed he and Linda had been having an affair behind his dad's back. The episode attracted an audience of 16.8 million and in the 2001 British Soap Awards won Best Storyline.
From 1999 to 2001, issue-led storylines were introduced such as Toyah Battersby's rape, Roy and Hayley Cropper abducting their foster child, Sarah Platt's Internet chat room abduction and Alma Halliwell's death of cervical cancer.[tpl]cite web|title=Coronation Street Producer|publisher= Corrie.net |url=http://www.corrie.net/profiles/staff/producers.html|accessdate=27 March 2007[/tpl] Such storylines were unpopular with viewers and ratings dropped and in October 2001, Macnaught was abruptly moved to another Granada department and Carolyn Reynolds took over. Corrie continued to struggle in the ratings, with EastEnders introducing some of its strongest stories. In 2002, Kieran Roberts was appointed as producer and aimed to re-introduce "gentle storylines and humour", after deciding that the Street should not try to compete with other soaps. In 2002, Gail Platt married Richard Hillman (Brian Capron), a financial advisor, who would go on to leave Duggie Ferguson to die, murder his ex-wife Patricia, attempt to murder his mother-in-law, Audrey Roberts, murder Maxine Peacock and attempt to murder Emily Bishop. After confessing to the murder of Maxine and his ex-wife, Hillman attempted to kill Gail, her children Sarah and David, and her granddaughter Bethany, by driving them into a canal. The storyline received wide press attention, and viewing figures peaked at 19.4 million, with Hillman dubbed a "serial killer" by the media.[tpl]cite news|title=Street drama hits ratings high|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2796201.stm |date=25 February 2003 |accessdate=12 March 2007[/tpl] Todd Grimshaw became Corrie's first regular homosexual character.[tpl]cite news |title=Street gay kiss complaints rejected |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3238111.stm|accessdate=12 March 2007 | date=3 November 2003[/tpl] 2003 saw the introduction of another gay male character, Sean Tully played by Antony Cotton. The character of Karen McDonald (Suranne Jones) was developed, with her fiery marriage to Steve and warring with Tracy Barlow. In 2004, Coronation Street retconned the Baldwin family when Mike's nephew Danny Baldwin and his wife Frankie moved to the area from Essex, with their two sons Jamie and Warren. Until this time, Mike Baldwin had been portrayed as an only child, with his father appearing in the programme between 1980 and 1982 confirming the fact. The bigamy of Peter Barlow and his addiction to alcohol, later in the decade, Maya Sharma's revenge on former lover Devendra Alahan, Charlie Stubbs's psychological abuse of Shelley Unwin, and the deaths of Mike Baldwin, Vera Duckworth and Fred Elliott. In 2007, Tracy Barlow murdered Charlie Stubbs and claiming it was self-defense, the storyline saw viewing figures peaking at 13.3 million. At the 2007 British Soap Awards, it won Best Storyline, and Kate Ford was voted Best Actress for her portrayal. Other storylines included Leanne Battersby becoming a prostitute and the show's first bi-sexual love triangle (between Michelle Connor, Sonny Dhillon, and Sean Tully). The Connor family were central to many storylines during 2007—the accidental death of a Polish worker at Underworld due to overworking, Michelle's discovery that her brothers Paul and Liam were the cause of her husband's death, Paul's use of an escort service, his kidnapping of Leanne and his subsequent death.

William Roache was listed as the world's longest-running soap actor.
Coronation Street's 50th anniversary week was celebrated with seven episodes, plus a special one-hour live episode, broadcast from 6–10 December. The episodes averaged 14 million viewers, a 52.1% share of the audience. The anniversary was also publicised with ITV specials and news broadcasts. In the storyline, Nick Tilsley and Leanne Battersby's bar—The Joinery—exploded during Peter Barlow's stag party. As a result, the viaduct was destroyed, sending a tram careering onto the street, destroying D&S Alahan's Corner Shop and The Kabin. Two characters, Ashley Peacock and Molly Dobbs, along with an unknown taxi driver, were killed as a result of the disaster. Rita Sullivan survived, despite being trapped under the rubble of her destroyed shop. Fiz Stape prematurely gave birth to a baby girl, Hope, after her husband, John, struck his stalker Charlotte Hoyle with a hammer to silence her. He later attempted to turn off Charlotte's life support machine, having gained access to her bedside by allowing her parents to believe he was her fiancé; they later made the decision themselves. Peter Barlow, believing himself on his deathbed, married Leanne Battersby in an impromptu ceremony, shortly before going into cardiac arrest, although he later rallied and made a slow recovery. The episode of EastEnders broadcast on the same day as Coronation Street[tpl]'s[/tpl] 50th anniversary episode included a tribute, with the character Dot Branning saying that she never missed Coronation Street.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.beehivecity.com/television/eastenders-to-celebrate-coronation-street-50th-with-on-screen-mention182823/|title=EastEnders to celebrate Coronation Street 50th with on screen mention|date=1 December 2010|work=Beehive City|publisher=Honeycomb Publishing & Media|accessdate=1 December 2010[/tpl]

==Characters==

Since 1960, Coronation Street has featured many characters whose popularity with viewers and critics has differed greatly. The original cast was created by Tony Warren, with the characters of Ena Sharples (Violet Carson), Elsie Tanner (Patricia Phoenix) and Annie Walker (Doris Speed) as central figures.Little. (1995) p.7. These three women remained with the show for 20 years or more, and became archetypes of British soap opera, often being emulated by other serials. Ena was the street's busybody, battleaxe and self-proclaimed moral voice.Tinker. p.38. Elsie was the tart with a heart, who was constantly hurt by men in the search for true love.Tinker. p.57. Annie Walker, landlady of the Rovers Return Inn, had delusions of grandeur and saw herself as better than other residents of Coronation Street.Tinker. p.40.
Coronation Street became known for the portrayal of strong female characters,Geraghty, Christine. Women and Soap Opera, Polity Press, London, 1991. (ISBN 978-0-7456-0568-5) including characters like Sharples, Walker and Tanner, and Hilda Ogden, who became household names during the 1960s.Little. (2000) p.5. Warren's programme was largely matriarchal, which some commentators put down to the female-dominant environment in which he grew up.[tpl]cite web |first = Will |last = Hadcroft |title = Daran Little interview |url = http://www.corrie.net/profiles/interviews/little.html |work = Corrie.net |accessdate =22 February 2007[/tpl] Consequently, the show has a long tradition of psychologically abused husbands, most famously Stan Ogden and Jack Duckworth, husbands of Hilda and Vera, respectively.
Ken Barlow (William Roache) entered the storyline as a young radical, reflecting the youth of 1960s Britain, where figures like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and the model Twiggy were to reshape the concept of youthful rebellion. Though the rest of the original Barlow family were killed off, Ken, who for 27 years was the only character from the first episode remaining, has remained the constant link throughout the entire series. In 2011, Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie), another character from the first episode, returned to Coronation Street after a 43-year absence.
Stan Ogden and Hilda Ogden were introduced in 1964, with Hilda (Jean Alexander) becoming one of the most famous British soap characters of all time. In a 1982 poll, she was voted fourth most recognisable woman in Britain, after Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, Queen Elizabeth II and Diana, Princess of Wales.Little. (1995) p.188. Hilda's best-known attributes were her pinny, hair curlers, and the "muriel" in her living room with three "flying" duck ornaments. Hilda Ogden's final episode on Christmas Day 1987, remains the highest-rated episode of Coronation Street ever, with nearly 27 million viewers.[tpl]cite news |first = Dennis |last = Barker |title = Obituary: Leslie Duxbury |url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,,1635800,00.html |work = The Guardian |date = 7 November 2005 |accessdate =2 September 2006 |location=London[/tpl]
Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear) first appeared in 1966, before becoming a regular in 1970, and went on to become one of the most famous Corrie characters.Little. (2000) p.66. Bet stood as the central character of the show from 1985 until departing in 1995, often being dubbed as "Queen of the Street" by the media, and indeed herself. The character briefly returned in June 2002.[tpl]cite web |title = Queen Of The Street The Amazing Life Of Julie Goodyear |url = http://www.alkenmrs.com/soapsrus/coronationstreet/csqueenstreet.html|work = Alken M R S |accessdate =9 March 2007[/tpl]
Coronation Street and its characters often rely heavily on archetypes, with the characterisation of some of its current cast based loosely on past characters. Phyllis Pearce, Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones)and Sylvia Goodwin embodied the role of the acid-tongued busybody originally held by Ena Sharples, Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) has grown snobbish, like Annie Walker, and a number of the programme's female characters mirror the vulnerability of Elsie Tanner and Bet Lynch. Other recurring archetypes include the war veteran (Albert Tatlock, Percy Sugden and Gary Windass), the bumbling retail manager (Leonard Swindley, Reg Holdsworth, Norris Cole), quick-tempered toughmen (Len Fairclough, Jim McDonald, Tommy Harris and Owen Armstrong), and the perennial losers (Stan and Hilda Ogden, Jack and Vera Duckworth, Les Battersby-Brown, Beth Tinker and Kirk Sutherland).[tpl]cite video | people = David Liddiment | title =How Soaps Changed the World | medium = Television Documentary | publisher = Channel 4| date = 17 July 2004 [/tpl] The show's former archivist and scriptwriter Daran Little disagreed with the characterisation of the show as a collection of stereotypes. "Rather, remember that Elsie, Ena and Co. were the first of their kind ever seen on British television. If later characters are stereotypes, it's because they are from the same original mould. It is the hundreds of programmes that have followed which have copied Coronation Street."Little. (1998) p.7.

==Production==

===Broadcast format===

Between 9 December 1960 and 3 March 1961, Coronation Street was broadcast twice weekly, on Wednesday and Friday. During this period, the Friday episode was broadcast live, with the Wednesday episode being pre-recorded 15 minutes later.Kershaw. p.30. When the programme went fully networked on 6 March 1961, broadcast days changed to Monday and Wednesday.Little. (2000) p.10. The last regular episode to be shown live was broadcast on 3 February 1961.
The series was transmitted in black and white for the majority of the 1960s. Preparations were made to film episode 923, to be transmitted Wednesday 29 October 1969, in colour. This instalment featured the street's residents on a coach trip to the Lake District. In the event suitable colour film stock for the cameras could not be found and the footage was shot in black and white. The following episode, transmitted Monday 3 November, was videotaped in colour but featured black and white film inserts and title sequence. Like BBC1, the ITV network was officially broadcast in black and white at this point (though programmes were actually broadcast in colour as early as July that year for colour transmission testing and adjustment) so the episode was seen by most in black and white.
Daran Little, for many years the official programme archivist, claims that the first episode to be transmitted in colour was episode 930 shown on 24 November 1969.Little. (2000) p.58. The ITV network, like BBC1, began full colour transmissions on 15 November 1969 and it is therefore possible that the first transmitted colour episode is number 928 shown on 17 November.
In October 1970 a technician's dispute turned into a work-to-rule when sound staff were denied a pay rise given to camera staff the year before for working with colour recording equipment. The terms of the work-to-rule were that staff refused to work with the new equipment (though the old black and white equipment had been disposed of by then) and therefore programmes were recorded and transmitted in black and white, including Coronation StreetRichard Marson. "Inside Updown – the story of "Upstairs Downstairs". Kaleidoscope publishing 2001. p.50. The dispute was resolved in early 1971 and the last black and white episode was broadcast on 8 February 1971.
Episode 5191, originally broadcast on 7 January 2002, was the first to be broadcast in 16:9 widescreen format. Coronation Street was the last British soap to make the switch to 16:9 (Take the High Road remained in 4:3 until it finished in 2003).
From 22 March 2010, Coronation Street was produced in 1080/50i for transmission on HDTV platforms on ITV HD. First transmission in this format was episode 7351 on 31 May 2010 with a new set of titles and re-recorded theme tune. On 26 May 2010 ITV previewed the new HD titles on the Coronation Street website. Due to copyright reasons only viewers residing in the UK could see them on the ITV site.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/s3/coronation-street/news/a219473/coronation-street-to-join-itv1-hd.html |title='Coronation Street' to join ITV1 HD |publisher=Digital Spy |date=12 May 2010|accessdate=7 January 2011[/tpl]

===Production staff===

Coronation Street's creator, Tony Warren, wrote the first 13 episodes of the programme in 1960, and continued to write for the programme intermittently until 1976.[tpl]cite web|title=Coronation Street's top ten writers|work=Corrie.net|url=http://www.corrie.net/profiles/staff/writers.html|accessdate=31 December 2006[/tpl] He still retains links with Coronation Street, often advising on storylines.
Harry Kershaw[tpl]cite web|title=H V Kershaw|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0449958/|accessdate=31 December 2006[/tpl] was the script editor for Coronation Street when the programme began in 1960, working alongside Tony Warren. Kershaw was also a script writer for the programme and the show's producer between 1962 and 1971. He remains the only person, along with John Finch, to have held the three posts of script editor, writer and producer. Kershaw continued to write for the programme until his retirement in January 1988.
Adele Rose was the longest-serving Coronation Street writer, completing 455 scripts between 1961 and 1998. She also created Byker Grove.[tpl]cite web|title=Adele Rose|work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0741220/|accessdate=31 December 2006[/tpl]
Bill Podmore was the show's longest serving producer. By the time he stepped down in 1988 he had completed 13 years at the production helm. Nicknamed the "godfather" by the tabloid press,Podmore, p.33. he was renowned for his tough, uncompromising style and was feared by both crew and cast alike. He is probably most famous for sacking Peter Adamson, the show's Len Fairclough, in 1983.
Michael Apted, best known for the Up! series of documentaries was a director on the programme in the early 1960s. This period of his career marked the first of his many collaborations with writer Jack Rosenthal.

===Theme music===

The show's theme music, a cornet piece, accompanied by a brass band plus clarinet and double bass, reminiscent of northern band music, was written by Eric Spear.Kershaw, p.25.
The identity of the trumpeter was not public knowledge until 1994, when jazz musician and journalist Ron Simmonds revealed that it was the Surrey musician Ronnie Hunt. He added, "an attempt was made in later years to re-record that solo, using Stan Roderick, but it sounded too good, and they reverted to the old one."Ron Simmonds, "Stan Roderick – A tribute", Jazz Professional, 1994 In 2004, the Manchester Evening News published a contradictory story that a young musician from Wilmslow called David Browning played the trumpet on both the original recording of the theme in 1960 and a re-recording in 1964, for a one-off payment of £36.[tpl]cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/127724_just_36_notes_for_corrie_trumpet.html|title=Just 36 notes for Corrie trumpet|work=Manchester Evening News|date=19 August 2004|last=Palmer|first=Carl|publisher=M.E.N.

Media[/tpl] In June 2009, the Mail on Sunday resolved the matter. Browning conceded that Hunt recorded the original in 1960, but believed that his own re-recording in 1964Corrie tune row as musicians blow own trumpets, Mail on Sunday, 14 June 2009 or 1972 had been used since that date. ITV then confirmed to the Mail that a second version had been recorded in the 1970s, but was only used for a very short while before reverting to Hunt's 1960 recording. In the 1980s the same version was converted to stereo.Brass warfare on Coronation Street as rival trumpeters say: I played that solo, Mail on Sunday, 21 June 2009
Ronnie Hunt said he was paid £6, and found the experience frustrating as Eric Spear insisted on many takes before obtaining the sound that he wanted. After taking a break in a local pub, Hunt achieved the desired mournful sound by playing very close to the microphone.
A new, completely re-recorded version of the theme tune replaced the original when the series started broadcasting in HD on 31 May 2010. It accompanied a new montage-style credits sequence featuring images of Manchester and Weatherfield.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/soaps/coronationstreet/news/newopeningtitles/ |title=New Opening Titles|work= Coronation Street — ITV Soaps |publisher=ITV.com |accessdate=7 January 2011[/tpl]

The programme currently rates as one of the most watched programmes on UK television for every day it is aired. Viewership peaked on Christmas Day 1987 when an average of 28.5 million viewers tuned in to see Hilda Ogden leave the street to start a new life as a housekeeper for long term friend Dr Lowther (although there is some confusion as to whether or not this was actually the highest rating episode due to a special omnibus repeat of that week's episodes being combined with the original airing). Since EastEnders began in 1985, the two programmes have constantly battled it out for first place in the ratings.

===Sets===

The regular exterior buildings shown in Coronation Street include a row of terrace houses, several townhouses, and communal areas including a newsagents (The Kabin), a cafe (Roy's Rolls), a general grocery shop (D&S Alahan's), a factory (Underworld) and Rovers Return Inn public house. The Rovers Return Inn is the main meeting place for the show's characters.Little. (2000) p.73.
Between 1960 and 1968 street scenes were filmed before a set constructed in a studio, with the house fronts reduced in scale to 3/4 and constructed from wood.Tinker. p.95. In 1968 Granada built an outside set not all that different from the interior version previously used, with the wooden façades from the studio simply being erected on the new site. These were replaced with brick façades, and back yards were added in the 1970s.
In 1982 a permanent full-street set was built in the Granada backlot, an area between Quay Street and Liverpool Road in Manchester.[tpl]cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&ie=UTF8&ll=53.477749,-2.255217&spn=0.00068,0.001808&t=k&z=19 |title=Google Maps |publisher=Google Maps|accessdate=20 September 2009[/tpl] The set was constructed from reclaimed Salford brick. The set was updated in 1989 with the construction of a new factory, two shop units and three modern town houses on the south side of the street.Little. (1995) pp.194–95.
Between 1989 and 1999 the Granada Studios Tour allowed members of the public to visit the set. The exterior set was extended and updated in 1999. This update added to the Rosamund Street and Victoria Street façades, and added a viaduct on Rosamund Street. Most interior scenes are shot in the adjoining purpose-built studio.
In 2008, Victoria Court, an apartment building full of luxury flats, was started on Victoria Street.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/Soaps/coronationstreet/galleries/Picturespecials/NewCorrieflats/default.html |title=Coronation Street|publisher=ITV.com |date=16 September 2009 |accessdate=20 September 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2011[/tpl]

==Broadcast history==

===United Kingdom===

For 50 years, Coronation Street has remained at the centre of ITV's prime time schedule. The programme is currently shown in the UK in five episodes, over three evenings a week on ITV. From Friday 9 December 1960 until Friday 3 March 1961, the programme was shown in two episodes broadcast Wednesday and Friday at 19:00. Schedules were changed and from Monday 6 March 1961 until Wednesday 11 October 1989, the programme was shown in two episodes broadcast Monday and Wednesday at 19:30. The third weekly episode was introduced on Friday 20 October 1989, broadcast at 19:30. From 1996, an extra episode was broadcast at 19:30 on Sunday nights. Aside from Granada, the programme originally appeared on the following stations of the ITV network: Anglia Television, Associated-Rediffusion, Television Wales and the West, Scottish Television, Southern Television and Ulster Television. From episode 14 on Wednesday 25 January 1961, Tyne Tees Television broadcast the programme. That left ATV in the Midlands as the only ITV station not carrying the show. When they decided to broadcast the programme, national transmission was changed from Wednesday and Friday at 19:00 to Monday and Wednesday at 19:30 and the programme became fully networked under this new arrangement from episode 25 on Monday 6 March 1961.
As the ITV network grew over the next few years, the programme was transmitted by these new stations on these dates onward: Westward Television from episode 40 on 29 April 1961, Border Television from episode 76 on 1 September 1961, Grampian Television from episode 84 on 30 September 1961, Channel Television from episode 180 on 1 September 1962 and Teledu Cymru (north and west Wales) from episode 184 on 14 September 1962.

In January 2011 the omnibus moved to Saturday mornings on ITV at 09:25.

In Canada, Coronation Street is broadcast on CBC Television. Until 2011, episodes were shown in Canada approximately 10 months after they aired in Britain; however, beginning in the fall of 2011, the CBC began showing two episodes every weekday, in order to catch up with the ITV showings, at 18:30 and 19:00 local time Monday-Friday, with an omnibus on Sundays at 07:30. During NHL playoffs, it was broadcast at 15:30 local time each weekday afternoon. As of September 2012, the CBC was only two weeks behind Britain, leading to a show being reduced to a single showing weeknights at 19:30 local time, with a repeat showing at 00:00 local time.
The show debuted on Toronto's CBLT in July 1966.[tpl]cite journal|last=Groen|first=Danielle|title=http://walrusmagazine.com/articles/2011.01-television-craving-corrie/1/|journal=The Walrus|date=January 2011|url=http://walrusmagazine.com/articles/2011.01-television-craving-corrie/1/[/tpl] The 2002 edition of the Guinness Book of Records recognises the 1,144 episodes sold to the now-defunct CBC-owned Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, TV station CBKST by Granada TV on 31 May 1971 to be the largest number of TV shows ever purchased in one transaction.[tpl]cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2002|page=160|publisher=Guinness|year=2001|isbn=0-85112-124-1[/tpl] The show traditionally aired on weekday afternoons in Canada, with a Sunday morning omnibus.

In light of recent austerity measures imposed on the CBC in 2012, which includes further cutbacks on non-Canadian programming, one of the foreign shows to remain on the CBC schedule is Coronation Street, according to the CBC's director of content planning Christine Wilson, who commented: "Unofficially I can tell you Coronation Street is coming back. If it didn't come back, something would happen on Parliament Hill."The Record: "CBC to jettison Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy!", 30 April 2012. Kirstine Stewart, the head of the CBC's English-language division, once remarked: "Coronation Street fans are the most loyal, except maybe for curling viewers, of all CBC viewers,"
In Republic of Ireland, Coronation Street is simulcast on TV3. The show is TV3's most watched programme with an average of 365,000 people watching each night. The show was so popular that an omnibus is also shown on weekends. For a number of months in 2009 TV3 provided repeats of the night's episode on sister channel 3e at 21:00 Monday, Wednesday and Friday nights, this has since stopped. The show was first aired in 1978, beginning with episodes from 1976. Ireland eventually caught up with the current UK episodes in 1983. Until 1992 it was broadcast on RTÉ Two and from 1992 to 2001 it was broadcast on RTÉ One. In 2001 Granada TV bought 45 percent TV3, which resulted in TV3 broadcasting series since 2001. In 2006 ITV sold its share of the channel but TV3 and ITV have since agreed to allow the programme to remain on TV3. From 2015 UTV Ireland will broadcast Coronation Street, the channel is due to go on air in 2015.
In New Zealand, Coronation Street has been shown locally since 1964, first on NZBC television until 1975,1970s: TV Trivia and then on TV One, which currently broadcasts it in a 4-episode / 2-hour block on Fridays from 19:30. Because TVOne has never upgraded to showing the equivalent of 5 episodes per week, New Zealand continues to fall further and further behind with episodes, and is currently 23 months behind Britain (as of 28 March 2014) During the weekday nights of the week ending 11 April 2014 and previous weeks, Coronation Street was the least watched programme on TV One in the 19:30 slot by a considerable margin in comparison to other weeknights,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.throng.co.nz/2014/04/tv-ratings-11-april-2014/ |title=Throng TV Ratings |date=12 April 2014 |accessdate=7 April 2014[/tpl] The serial previously aired on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 19:30 until October 2011, when the show moved to a 17:30 half-hour slot every weekday.

Dutch broadcaster VARA showed 428 sub-titled episodes on Netherlands TV between 1967 and 1975. It wanted to terminate the series in 1971 but due to public pressure continued until 1975. Because VARA was running well behind the British broadcasts, causing the actors to refer to past British politics, a special episode was produced for VARA to bridge and jump the gap and allow VARA to broadcast newer episodes.
In 2011 Dutch broadcaster SBS6 started to show episodes from 26 November 2001 about four or five times a week during daytime (1:15 pm) starting with 3000 viewers every day, and till 5 November 2011 with an average of 35,000 viewers.
In Sweden Coronation Street was shown in the country's largest broadcaster TV4 during daytime in the early 2000s until it was taken off air a few years later. TV4 also broadcasts Emmerdale which (2012) is Swedens's most watched daytime programme and attracts some 150,000 to 200,000 viewers on a daily basis.
In the United States, Coronation Street is available by broadcast or cable only in northern markets where CBC coverage from Canada overlaps the border or is available on local cable systems. It was previously broadcast on CBC's former US cable channel, Trio until the CBC sold their stake in the channel to Universal, before it was shut down in 2006.

==Merchandise==

Several classic episodes were released on VHS video in the 1980s and 1990s in different sets, while a number of specially recorded feature-length episodes were released exclusively to video (see Coronation Street VHS and DVD releases).
The Street, a magazine dedicated to the show, was launched in 1989. Edited by Bill Hill, the magazine contained a summary of recent storylines, interviews, articles about classic episodes, and stories that occurred from before 1960. The format was initially A5 size, expanding to A4 from the seventh issue.The Street, Issue 7, The Street Ltd. The magazine folded after issue 23 in 1993 when the publisher's contract with Granada Studios Tour expired and Granada wanted to produce their own magazine.The Street, Issue 23, The Street Ltd.
During the time when the studio tour was operating, a huge amount of branded merchandise was available from an on-site shop—everything from soap, to tea-towels, to model houses. These items gradually became scarce as the tours complex was wound down. Although there were large numbers produced, these items are becoming collectable by fans.
On 25 June 2010 a video game of the show was released on Nintendo DS. Players take the role of a detective as they work through a brand new storyline and befriend the various characters from the street, including Ken, Norris, Maria and Blanche.

===Films===

Over the years Coronation Street has released several straight-to-video films.

ITV heavily promoted the programme as a direct-to-video exclusive but broadcast a brief version of it on 24 March 1996.

The British rock band Queen produced a single "I Want to Break Free" in 1984 which reached number 3 position in UK charts and which is largely known for its music video for which all the band members dressed in women's clothes, which parodied the characters and is considered as a homage to the show.[tpl]cite book|author=Sutcliffe, Phil; Hince, Peter and Mack, Reinhold|title=Queen: The Ultimate Illustrated History of the Crown Kings of Rock|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=adNONbUWLjgC&pg=PT183|date=15 November 2009|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-7603-3719-6 |page=180[/tpl] The video depicts Mercury as a housewife, loosely based on Bet Lynch, who wants to "break free" from his life. Although Lynch was a blonde in the soap opera, Mercury thought he would look too silly as a blonde and chose a dark wig.
