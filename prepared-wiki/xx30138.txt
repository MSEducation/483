[tpl]Unicode|Ç, ç[/tpl] (c-cedilla) is a Latin script letter, used in the Albanian, Azerbaijani, Ligurian, Tatar, Turkish, Turkmen, Kurdish and Zazaki alphabets. This letter also appears in Catalan, French, Friulian, Occitan and Portuguese as a variant of the letter "c". It is also occasionally used in Crimean Tatar, and Manx.
It was first used for the sound of the voiceless alveolar affricate [tpl]IPA|/t͡s/[/tpl] in old Spanish and stems from the Visigothic form of the letter "z". This phoneme originated in Vulgar Latin from the palatalization of the plosives [tpl]IPA|/t/[/tpl] and [tpl]IPA|/k/[/tpl] in some conditions. Later, [tpl]IPA|/t͡s/[/tpl] changed into [tpl]IPA|/s/[/tpl] in many Romance languages and dialects. Spanish has not used this symbol since an orthographic reform in the 18th century (which replaced "ç" with the now-devoiced "z"), but it was adopted for writing other languages.
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, "[tpl]IPA|ç[/tpl]" represents the voiceless palatal fricative.

==Usage as a letter variant in various languages==

It represents the "soft" sound [tpl]IPA|/s/[/tpl] where a "c" would normally represent the "hard" sound [tpl]IPA|/k/[/tpl] (before "a", "o", "u", or at the end of a word), in the following languages:

==Usage as a separate letter in various languages==

It represented a voiceless palatal click [tpl]IPA|/ǂ/[/tpl] in Juǀʼhoansi and Naro, though the former has replaced it with [tpl]angle bracket|ǂ[/tpl] and the latter with [tpl]angle bracket|tc[/tpl].
A letter that is identical to the C-cedilla is used in the Bashkir language's Cyrillic alphabet as the /θ/ sound and in the Chuvash language's Cyrillic alphabet as the /ɕ/ sound.
