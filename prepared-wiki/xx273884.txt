==Election history==

In 2000, Republican State Representative Todd Staples, now the Texas Agriculture Commissioner, was elected to the District 3 seat in the Texas State Senate. Hopson, as a Democrat was elected to succeed Staples. Nine years later on November 6, 2009, Hopson switched to GOP affiliation. He then secured his sixth term and his first as a Republican in 2010. His defection in 2009 made him the 77th Republican representative, then a majority by two seats. In January 2011, Hopson became one of 101 members of the GOP delegation, as the party gained a two-thirds majority in the 2010 general election.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/legeLeaders/members/memberDisplay.cfm?memberID=183&searchparams=chamber=~city=~countyID=0~district=~first=~gender=~last=HOpson~leaderNote=~leg=~party=~roleDesc=~Committee|title=Chuck Hopson|publisher=lrl.state.tx.us|accessdate=September 25, 2011[/tpl]
In explaining his party switch, Hopson said that his East Texas district does not share the philosophy of U.S. President Barack H. Obama. The lawmaker said, "I believe in democracy and respect its process." Then state Democratic chairman Boyd Ritchie, an attorney from Young County, replied to Hopson: "It takes strength and integrity to stand against the special interest. And while some members have that strength, others like Chuck Hopson, apparently do not." Joe Straus of San Antonio, the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, described Hopson as an "outstanding public servant who fights hard for his East Texas constituents."Gromer Jeffers, Jr., "Democrat Chuck Hopson Joins GOP," Dallas Morning News, November 6, 2009
In his first general election as a Democrat to succeed Todd Staples, Hopson defeated Republican Paul S. Woodard, Jr., 21,991 votes (53 percent) to 19,459 (47 percent).[tpl]cite web|url=http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe|title=Texas general election returns, November 7, 2000|publisher=elections.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=September 25, 2011[/tpl] Republicans did not challenge Hopson in 2002, but in November 2004, the Republican Mike Alberts received 24,123 votes (47.3 percent) in District 11 to Hopson's 26,885 (52.7 percent).[tpl]cite web|url=http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe|title=Texas general election returns, November 2, 2004|publisher=elections.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=September 25, 2011[/tpl] In 2006, in a lower-turnout general election, Republican Larry K. Durrett, also of Jacksonville, garnered 15,918 votes (46.1 percent) to Hopson's 17,603 (51 percent). Libertarian Paul "Blue" Story held the remaining 998 votes (2.9 percent).[tpl]cite web|url=http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe|title=Texas general election returns, November 7, 2006|publisher=elections.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=September 25, 2011[/tpl]

==Legislative service==

Hopson is the departing chairman of the House Ethics Committee and a member of the committees on (1) Public Health and (2) Pensions, Investments, and Financial Services as well as the Rural Caucus. According to his Internet biography, Hopson is committed to working with legislators in both parties to promote economic development, to fund public education, to lower property taxes, and to provide healthcare access. Former Lieutenant Governor Bill Ratliff of Mount Pleasant, who served in that position from 2001 to 2003, describes Hopson's record as that of an "independent conservative philosophy."[tpl]cite web|url=http://texas.onpolitix.com/bio/485/chuck-hopson|title=Chuck Hopson|publisher=texas.onpolitix.com by KXAN-TV|accessdate=September 25, 2011[/tpl]

==2012 election==

Hopson led the Republican primary on May 29, 2012 in his bid for renomination. He polled 9,249 votes (47.2 percent) but fell short of the outright majority required under Texas law. Travis Clardy, a lawyer from Nacogdoches, received 9,083 votes (46.3 percent), or 166 votes fewer than Hopson. A third candidate, Tony Sevilla, polled the critical 1,284 votes (6.5 percent).[tpl]cite web|url=http://enr.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/may29_160_state.htm|title=Republican primary election returns, May 29, 2012|publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=May 30, 2012[/tpl] In the July 31 runoff, Hopson was narrowly unseated by Clardy, 8,184 (51.1 percent) to 7,817 (48.9 percent). Hopson's defeat is attributed to his weak showing in Nacogdoches County, new to the 11th District.[tpl]cite web|url=http://enr.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/july31_162_state.htm?x=0&y=1397&id=96|title=2012 Republican Party Primary Runoff Results|publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=August 1, 2012[/tpl]
