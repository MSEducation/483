==History==

In 1913 the opening of the Brazeau Branch rail line to the coal mine at Nordegg created access to markets, and other mining ventures soon started near the tracks. The mine at Alexo, which was named after the Alexo Coal Company, was one of them.[tpl]cite book|last=Belliveau|first=Anne|title=Small moments in time, the story of Alberta's Big West country|year=1999|publisher=Detselig Enterprises Ltd, 238 p.|location=Calgary, Alberta|isbn=1-55059-178-9[/tpl]
The Alexo mine operated from 1920 to 1955. By 1948 annual production was about 33,000 tonnes. The payroll included about 70 people, of whom 30 were miners. There was a hotel, a cookhouse, a bunkhouse, a store, and 30 cottages.Pullen, P.F. and Tennant, R. 1948. Alexo has quality products. Western Miner 21(8): 88-89, August 1948.
The mine worked a single seam that was consistently about 5 feet (1.5m) thick, with a shallow dip to the northeast.  Mining was done by underground room and pillar methods. By 1948 the main slope had advanced to a length of [tpl]convert|824|m|ft|-1[/tpl], and levels driven from both sides covered a total east-west distance of [tpl]convert|2012|m|ft|-1[/tpl].
The Alexo mine closed in 1955 due to declining markets for steam coal as the railroads replaced steam locomotives with diesel,Dutton, J.A. 1954. Alberta coal output declines. Western Miner 27(4): 42, 44-46, April 1954. and the town was eventually dismantled.
Most of the former Alexo townsite is leased by the provincial government to the Youth and Volunteer Centre of Red Deer, Alberta and is home to a summer camp called Camp Alexo.
