[[FIDE Grand Prix 2008–10]]

CATEGORIES: FIDE Grand Prix, 2008 in chess, 2009 in chess, 2010 in chess

The FIDE Grand Prix 2008–10 was a series of six chess tournaments that formed part of the qualification for the World Chess Championship 2012. The top two finishers here formed two of the eight players who played in a Candidates Tournament to determine the challenger for the world champion. It was administered by FIDE, the World Chess Federation. The event was won by Levon Aronian. The runner-up was Teimour Radjabov.
The winner of the Grand Prix was originally scheduled to play a match in 2010 against the winner of the Chess World Cup 2009, with the winner of that match becoming the challenger for the World Chess Championship 2012.First FIDE Grand Prix in Baku, Azerbaijan, Chessbase, April 19, 2008 
On November 25, 2008, FIDE announced major changes, with the winner and runner-up qualifying instead for an eight-player Candidates Tournament. This caused a number of protests, with Magnus Carlsen and Michael Adams withdrawing, and two other players being replaced. (For details, see World Chess Championship 2012.)
A number of host cities withdrew, causing all the tournaments except the first two to be rescheduled.

==Format==

There were six tournaments spread over 2008, 2009 and 2010. Each of the 21 participating players played in exactly four of the six tournaments. 
Each tournament is a 14 player, single round-robin tournament. In each round players scored 1 point for a win, ½ point for a draw and 0 for a loss. Grand prix points were then allocated according to each player's standing in the tournament: 180 grand prix points for first place, 150 for second place, 130 for third place, and then 110 down to 10 points for places four to fourteen (decreasing by 10 points for each place). (Grand Prix points were split between players on equal tournament points).
Players only counted their best three tournament results. The player with the most grand prix points was the winner. 
If a tie-break was needed for the overall grand prix winner, the system was:Grand Prix Regulations, section 7.2, FIDE web site, accessed May 5, 2008

===Draw rules===

A variation from normal chess rules was that the players were not allowed to talk to each other during the game and a draw by agreement was not allowed.  A draw has to be claimed with the arbiter, who was assisted by an active grandmaster who had the title for at least ten years. The only draws allowed (except for stalemate) were:Grand Prix Regulations, section 4.4, FIDE web site, accessed May 2, 2008

==Participants==

===Qualification===

===Prominent non-participants===

Of the original 14 players who qualified, Anand, Kramnik and Topalov (2008/2010 contenders), Shirov (World Cup 2007) and Morozevich (ratings list) were all not taking part. One of the first four nominated reserves, Judit Polgár was also not participating. The lineup for the Grand Prix included 13 of the 20 top-rated Grandmasters at the time it was announced, though none of the top four.
The only one to publicly give a reason was Alexander Morozevich, who announced that he was boycotting the Grand Prix, saying the process was too long, unwieldy and disorganised. He claimed that Anand, Kramnik and Topalov were also boycotting.Alexander Morozevich: “I am not giving up the fight!”, Chessbase, February 27, 2008 The Week in Chess reported that Kramnik and Topalov were not participating because the event had insufficient prize money.The Week in Chess 697 March 17, 2008
