==Plot==

Years after the events of the first film, Sheriff Riley (John Schneider) investigates the disappearance of a researcher in Lake Placid. Emma, a member of the Fish and Wildlife department, is enlisted to help him. At the lake, they discover the severed head of the missing man, and move to decide to question Sadie, Delores Bickerman's sister. Sadie refuses to aid the investigation, and they leave. On their way back into the town, they are attacked by a twenty foot crocodile, and their boat is destroyed. They swim to the shore, and the crocodile follows them. Sadie is revealed to be feeding the crocodiles with hormone enhanced meat, and two of them have mated, creating a nest of giant eggs.
