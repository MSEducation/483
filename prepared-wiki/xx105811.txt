The University System of New Hampshire (USNH), established in 1963,  is responsible for overseeing the University of New Hampshire, Plymouth State University, Keene State College, and Granite State College. The University System is the largest provider of post-secondary education in New Hampshire.  The university system is governed by a single Board of Trustees (BOT) which is responsible for ensuring that each institution has a unique character and educational mission.

==History==

The decision to establish the university system came from the recommendation of the Interim Commission on Higher Education appointed in 1961 by Governor Wesley Powell.  In establishing the university system, the Keene and Plymouth Teachers' Colleges were removed from the supervision of the State Board of Education, were renamed "state colleges", and placed under the jurisdiction of the Board of Trustees of the University of New Hampshire.  The number of trustees increased from 13 to 22 with the establishment of the University System.  The Board designated the President of the University of New Hampshire as "first among equals" and assigned the responsibility to coordinate the activities of the three institutions.
In 1972, the Trustees established the School of Continuing Studies (now Granite State College) to serve the adult education needs of New Hampshire residents.
From 1963 to 1974, there was a growing concern of the trustees over the steadily increasing amount of time that senior UNH officials had to devote to the growing responsibilities to the University System. An appointed Committee representing a broad spectrum of political, professional, and educational interests later named"The Carter Commission" recommended the employment of a System Director of Personnel and the development of a comprehensive personnel system which would provide for the establishment of a state-wide educational system.  The trustees voted to physically separate the University System staff from the University staff.  In summer 1974, the newly designated USNH staff moved five miles west of Durham in Lee.  The trustees also had legislation passed and signed to create the position of chancellor. The chancellor was established as the chief executive and chief academic officer of the system to oversee the head of each institution, and is elected and answerable to the Trustees.

==Board of trustees==

The Board of Trustees, which has twenty-seven members, controls the operations of the university system and oversees the system schools.  The board is made up of the Governor (ex officio), eleven Governor-appointees, six members elected by alumni, two student-elected members (elected annually on a three-year rotation from UNH, PSU, and KSC), the Commissioner of Education (ex officio), the Commissioner of Agriculture (ex officio), the four presidents of the System's colleges and universities (ex officio), and the Chancellor (ex officio). The Chancellor is the chief executive officer of the university system appointed by the trustees.
