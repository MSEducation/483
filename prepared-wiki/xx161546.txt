==Biography==

Romero studied at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado "La Esmeralda", in Mexico City. From 1991 to 1997, Romero taught sculpture, painting and art history at La Esmeralda. Additionally, from 1991 to 1993, Romero taught art history, design, and drawing at the College Center for Studies in Science and Communications in Mexico City, and also in 2002 taught painting at the School for Visual Arts in Michoac√°n, Mexico.
In 1998, Romero represented Mexico in the Emerging Artists of Latin America exhibition at the Passage de Retz gallery in Paris, France, and in 2001 he lectured on sculpture and participated in the International Studio Program of the National Foundation for Advancement in the Arts in the United States.
A neoeclectic painter, Romero combines his versions of historic paintings by artists, such as Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Goya, and Bosch, with irreverent contemporary images, allowing emotion and reason free range.
