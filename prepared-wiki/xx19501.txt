Despite this, its canal system led to a thriving farming community, many of the original crops remaining important parts of the Phoenix economy for decades, such as alfalfa, cotton, citrus and hay (which was important for the cattle industry).[tpl]cite web | url=http://arizonaexperience.org/land/farming-and-ranching | title=Farming and Ranching | publisher=arizonaexperience.org | accessdate=February 17, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.barriozona.com/short_history_south_phoenix_1865_1930s.html | title=A Short History of South Phoenix from 1865 to the early 1930's | publisher=barriozona | accessdate=February 17, 2014[/tpl]  In fact, the "Five C's" (Cotton, Cattle, Citrus, Climate, and Copper), remained the driving forces of Phoenix's economy until after World War II, when high tech industries began to move into the valley.
The population growth rate of the Phoenix metro area has been nearly 4% per year for the past 40 years.  While that growth rate slowed during the Great Recession, it has already begun to rebound.

==History==

===Early history===

For more than 2,000 years, the Hohokam peoples occupied the land that would become Phoenix.[tpl]cite book | last=Trimble|first=Marshall | title=Arizoniana | publisher=American Traveler Press | year=1988 | page=103 | isbn=978-1-885590-89-3[/tpl]  The Hohokam created roughly 135 miles (217 km) of irrigation canals, making the desert land arable. Paths of these canals would later become used for the modern Arizona Canal, Central Arizona Project Canal, and the Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct. The Hohokam also carried out extensive trade with the nearby Anasazi, Mogollon and Sinagua, as well as with the more distant Mesoamerican civilizations.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.azmnh.org/arch/hohokam.aspx | title=The Hohokam | publisher=Arizona Museum of Natural History | accessdate=February 20, 2014[/tpl]  It is believed that between 1300 and 1450, periods of drought and severe floods led to the Hohokam civilization's abandonment of the area.Trimble 1988, p. 105. Local Akimel O'odham settlements, thought to be the descendants of the formerly urbanized Hohokam, concentrated on the Gila River.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.srpmic-nsn.gov/history_culture/maricopa.asp | title=Xalychidom Piipaash (Maricopa) People | publisher=Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community | accessdate=February 17, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/maricopa-tribe.htm | title=Maricopa Tribe | publisher=Access Genealogy | accessdate=February 17, 2014[/tpl]
When the Mexican-American War ended in 1848, Mexico sold its northern zone passed to the United States and residents became U.S. citizens. The Phoenix area became part of the New Mexico Territory.[tpl]cite book|author=Spencer C. Tucker|title=The Encyclopedia of the Mexican-American War: A Political, Social, and Military History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I9ceNvefrToC&pg=PA255|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=255[/tpl] In 1863 the mining town of Wickenburg was the first to be established in what is now Maricopa County, to the north-west of modern Phoenix. At the time Maricopa County had not yet been incorporated: the land was within Yavapai County, which included the major town of Prescott to the north of Wickenburg.
The U.S. Army created Fort McDowell on the Verde River in 1865 to forestall Native American uprisings.[tpl]cite book|author=Joan Fudala|title=Historic Scottsdale: A Life from the Land|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oSiRm6fUk4IC&pg=PA28|year=2001|publisher=HPN Books|page=28[/tpl] The fort established a camp on the south side of the Salt River by 1866, which was the first non-native settlement in the valley after the decline of the Hohokam. In later years, other nearby settlements would form and merge to become the city of Tempe,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tempe.gov/museum/Tempe_history/basics/timeline.htm#FIRS |publisher=Tempe.gov |title=Tempe History Timeline |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110105115517/http://www.tempe.gov/museum/Tempe_history/basics/timeline.htm |archivedate=January 5, 2011 |accessdate=January 31, 2013[/tpl] but this community was incorporated after Phoenix.

===Founding and incorporation===

The history of the city of Phoenix begins with Jack Swilling, a Confederate veteran of the Civil War. In 1867 he saw in the Salt River Valley a potential for farming, much like that already cultivated by the military further east, near Fort McDowell. He formed a small community that same year about 4 miles (6 km) east of the present city. Lord Darrell Duppa suggested the name "Phoenix", as it described a city born from the ruins of a former civilization.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thenaturalamerican.com/phoenix_history.htm|title=Phoenix Valley History|publisher=The Natural American|accessdate=February 4, 2014[/tpl]
The Board of Supervisors in Yavapai County, which at the time encompassed Phoenix, officially recognized the new town on May 4, 1868, and the first post office was established the following month, with Swilling as the postmaster.  On February 12, 1871, the territorial legislature created Maricopa County, the sixth one formed in the Arizona Territory, by dividing Yavapai County. The first election for county office was held in 1871, when Tom Barnum was elected the first sheriff, actually running unopposed when the other two candidates, John A. Chenowth and Jim Favorite, fought a duel wherein Chenowth killed Favorite, and then was forced to withdraw from the race.
The town grew during the 1870s, and President Ulysses S. Grant issued a land patent for the present site of Phoenix on April 10, 1874.  By 1875, the town had a telegraph office, sixteen saloons, and four dance halls, but the townsite-commissioner form of government needed an overhaul, so that year an election was held in which three village trustees as well as several other officials were selected.  By 1880, the town's population stood at 2,453.
By 1881, Phoenix' continued growth made the existing village structure with a board of trustees obsolete. The Territorial Legislature passed "The Phoenix Charter Bill", incorporating Phoenix and providing for a mayor-council government, and became official on February 25, 1881 when it was signed by Governor John C. Fremont, officially incorporating Phoenix as a city with an approximate population of 2,500.
The coming of the railroad in the 1880s was the first of several important events that revolutionized the economy of Phoenix.  Phoenix became a trade center, with its products reaching eastern and western markets. In response, the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce was organized on November 4, 1888.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-West/Phoenix-History.html|title=Phoenix: History|publisher=City-Data.com|accessdate=February 4, 2014[/tpl] Earlier in 1888 the city offices were moved into the new City Hall, at Washington and Central.  When the territorial capital was moved from Prescott to Phoenix in 1889 the temporary territorial offices were also located in City Hall.  With the arrival of the Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railroad in 1895, Phoenix was connected to the Prescott, Flagstaff and other northern state communities.  The increased access to commerce, expedited the city's economic rise. The year 1895 also saw the establishment of Phoenix Union High School, with an enrollment of 90.

===1900 to the post World War II years===

On February 25, 1901, Governor Murphy dedicated the permanent state Capitol building, and the Carnegie Free Library opened seven years later, on Feb.18, 1908, dedicated by Benjamin Fowler.  The National Reclamation Act was signed by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1902, which allowed for dams to be built on waterways in the west for reclamation purposes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.az100years.org/az-experience/this-day-in-arizona-history-2/|title=This Day in Arizona History | publisher=AZ100Years.org | accessdate=February 4, 2014[/tpl]  The first dam constructed under the act, the Theodore Roosevelt Dam was begun in 1906.  It supplied both water and electricity, becoming the first multiple-purpose dam, and Roosevelt would attend the official dedication himself, on May 18, 1911.  At the time, it was the largest masonry dam in the world, forming several new lakes in the surrounding mountain ranges.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hellophoenix.com/history.cfm |title=Phoenix History |publisher=Hello Phoenix | accessdate=February 4, 2014[/tpl]
On February 14, 1912, under President William Howard Taft, Phoenix became the capital of the newly formed state of Arizona. This occurred just six months after Taft had vetoed in August 1911, a joint congressional resolution granting statehood to Arizona, due to his disagreement of the state constitution's position regarding the recall of judges.  In 1913 Phoenix adopted a new form of government, changing from a mayor-council system to council-manager, making it one of the first cities in the United States with this form of city government. After statehood, Phoenix's growth started to accelerate, and by the end of its first eight years under statehood, Phoenix' population had grown to 29,053.  In 1920 Phoenix would see its first skyscraper, the Heard Building.  In 1929 Sky Harbor was officially opened, at the time owned by Scenic Airways.  It would later be purchased by the city in 1935, who operates it to this day.[tpl]cite web | url=http://skyharbor.com/about/earlyYears.html | title=1935 and The Farm – Sky Harbor's Early Years and Memories | publisher=skyharbor.com | date=August 30, 1930 | accessdate=February 5, 2014[/tpl]
On March 4, 1930, former U.S. President Calvin Coolidge dedicated a dam on the Gila River named in his honor. However, the state had just been through a long drought, and the reservoir which was supposed to be behind the dam, was virtually dry. The humorist Will Rogers, who was also on hand as a guest speaker joked, "If that was my lake I'd mow it." Phoenix's population had more than doubled during the 1920s, and now stood at 48,118.
During World War II, Phoenix's economy shifted to that of a distribution center, rapidly turning into an embryonic industrial city with mass production of military supplies. There were 3 air force fields in the area: Luke Field, Williams Field, and Falcon Field, as well as two large pilot training camps, Thunderbird Field No. 1 in Glendale and Thunderbird Field No. 2 in Scottsdale.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/airport/history.asp | title=Scottsdale Airport History | publisher=scottsdaleaz.gov | accessdate=February 19, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last=Manning | first=Thomas A. | year=2005 | title=History of Air Education and Training Command, 1942–2002 | publisher=Office of History and Research, Headquarters, AETC | place=Randolph AFB, Texas | isbn=978-1-178-48983-5[/tpl]
When the war ended, many of the men who had undergone their training in Phoenix returned, and their families came with them.  Large industry, learning of this labor pool, started to move branches here.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thenaturalamerican.com/1900_to_today.htm | title=Growing into a Metropolis | publisher=The Natural American | accessdate=February 5, 2014[/tpl] In 1948 high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when Motorola chose Phoenix for the site of its new research and development center for military electronics.  Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other high-tech companies such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas would also move into the valley and open manufacturing operations.
By 1950, over 105,000 people lived within the city and thousands more in surrounding communities.  The 1950s growth was spurred on by advances in air conditioning, which allowed both homes and businesses to offset the extreme heat known to Phoenix during its long summers.  There was more new construction in Phoenix in 1959 alone, than it in the prior thirty years between 1914 and 1946.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.arizonaedventures.com/reference-guide/arizona-history-timeline/20th-century/ | title=20th Century | publisher=Arizona Edventures | accessdate=February 5, 2014[/tpl]

===The 1960s through current===

Over the next several decades, the city and metropolitan area attracted more growth and became a favored tourist destination for its exotic desert setting and recreational opportunities. In 1960 the Phoenix Corporate Center opened; at the time it was the tallest building in Arizona, topping off at 341 feet.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/building/phoenixcorporatecenter-phoenix-az-usa | title=Phoenix Corporate Center | publisher=Emporis | accessdate=February 5, 2014[/tpl] The 1960s saw many other buildings constructed as the city expanded rapidly, including: the Rozenweig Center (1964), today called Phoenix City Square,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.emporis.com/complex/phoenix-city-square-phoenix-az-usa | title=Phoenix City Square | publisher=Emporis | accessdate=February 5, 2014[/tpl] the landmark Phoenix Financial Center (1964),[tpl]cite web | url=http://modernphoenix.net/phoenixfinancial.htm | title=The Phoenix Financial Center a.k.a. Western Savings and Loan | publisher=ModernPhoenix.net | accessdate=February 5, 2014[/tpl] as well as many of Phoenix's residential high-rises.  In 1965 the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum was opened on the grounds of the Arizona State Fair, west of downtown, and in 1968, the city was surprisingly awarded the Phoenix Suns NBA franchise,[tpl]cite web|url=http://origin.nba.com/suns/history/00827382.html | title=Suns Timeline | publisher=NBA.com | accessdate=February 5, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/suns/media/SunsMediaGuide2011-12.pdf | title=Season Review 68–69| publisher=NBA.com | page=122|accessdate=February 5, 2014[/tpl] which played its home games at the Coliseum until 1992.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nba.com/suns/media/SunsMediaGuide2011-12.pdf | title=Season Review 92–93 | publisher=NBA.com | page=170|accessdate=February 5, 2014[/tpl] In 1968, the Central Arizona Project was approved by President Lyndon B.

In the 1970s the downtown area experienced a resurgence, with a level of construction activity not seen again until the urban real estate boom of the 2000s. By the end of the decade, Phoenix adopted the Phoenix Concept 2000 plan which split the city into urban villages, each with its own village core where greater height and density was permitted, further shaping the free-market development culture.  Originally, there were 9 villages,[tpl]cite book| title=Phoenix: The History of a Southwestern Metropolis | last=Luckingham | first=Bradford |publisher=University of Arizona Press | year=1989 | isbn=0-8165-1116-0 |pages=235–7[/tpl] but this has been expanded to 15 over the years (see Cityscape below). This officially turned Phoenix into a city of many nodes, which would later be connected by freeways.  1972 would see the opening of the Phoenix Symphony Hall,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.phoenixconventioncenter.com/venues/symphony-hall/ | title=Symphony Hall — a perfect harmony between event and venue | publisher=Phoenix Convention Center | accessdate=February 27, 2014[/tpl]  Other major structures which saw construction downtown during this decade were the Wells Fargo Plaza, the Chase Tower (the tallest building in both Phoenix and Arizona)[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.emporis.com/building/chasetower-phoenix-az-usa | title=Chase Tower | publisher=Emporis | accessdate=February 27, 2014[/tpl] and the U.S.Bank Center.

==Geography==

Phoenix is in the southwestern United States, in the south-central portion of Arizona, and about halfway between Tucson to the south and Flagstaff to the north.  The metropolitan area is known as the "Valley of the Sun", due to its location in the Salt River Valley. It lies at a mean elevation of 1,117 feet (340 m), in the northern reaches of the Sonoran Desert.[tpl]cite web | url=http://geography.howstuffworks.com/united-states/geography-of-phoenix.htm| title=Geography of Phoenix | publisher=How Stuff Works | accessdate=February 10, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.phoenix-arizona.com/facts/ | title=Facts about Phoenix, Arizona | publisher=Phoenix-Arizona.com | accessdate=February 10, 2014[/tpl]
Other than the mountains in and around the city, the topography of Phoenix is generally flat, allowing the city's main streets to run on a precise grid with wide, open-spaced roadways.  Scattered, low mountain ranges surround the valley: McDowell Mountains to the northeast, the White Tank Mountains to the west, the Superstition Mountains far to the east, and the Sierra Estrella to the southwest.  On the outskirts of Phoenix are large fields of irrigated cropland and several Indian reservations.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-West/Phoenix-Geography-and-Climate.html | title=Phoenix: Geography and Climate | publisher=city-data.com | accessdate=February 10, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.summitpost.org/phoenix-mountains-and-neighboring-ranges/285171 | title=Phoenix Mountain Overview | publisher=summitpost.org | accessdate=March 5, 2014[/tpl]   The Salt River runs westward through the city of Phoenix, and the riverbed is often dry or contains a little water due to large irrigation diversions.  The community of Ahwatukee is separated from the rest of the city by South Mountain.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 517.9 square miles (1,341 km2); 516.7 square miles (1,338 km2) of it is land and 1.2 square miles (0.6 km², or 0.2%) of it is water.  Even though it is the 6th most populated city, the large area gives it a low density rate of approximately 2,797 people per square mile.[tpl]cite web | url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/04/0455000.html | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau | title=Phoenix (city) QuickFacts | accessdate=March 5, 2014[/tpl]  In comparison, Philadelphia, the 5th most populous city has a density of over 11,000.[tpl]cite web | url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/42/42101.html | title=Philadelphia (city) Quickfacts | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau | accessdate=March 5, 2014[/tpl]
As with most of Arizona, Phoenix does not observe daylight saving time. In 1973, Gov. Jack Williams argued to the U.S. Congress that due to air conditioning units not being used as often in the morning on standard time, energy use would increase in the evening. He went on to say that energy use would rise "because there would be more lights on in the early morning." He was also concerned about children going to school in the dark, which was quite accurate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/printDS/75798 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070929111247/http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/printDS/75798 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |title=Arizona does not need daylight saving time – Arizona Daily Star.'|date=May 19, 2005 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=September 29, 2007 |accessdate=June 19, 2012[/tpl]

===Cityscape===

====Neighborhoods====

Since 1979, the City of Phoenix has been divided into urban villages, many of which are based upon historically significant neighborhoods and communities that have since been annexed into Phoenix.[tpl]cite book | title=Phoenix General Plan Update: Transitioning to a Sustainable Future | publisher=Phoenix.gov | date=December 2010 |accessdate=February 5, 2014 |page=1 | url=http://phoenix.gov/webcms/groups/internet/@inter/@citygov/@future/@planphx/documents/web_content/052978.pdf[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://phoenix.gov/PLANNING/vpcommtt.html | title=Village Planning Committees | publisher=Phoenix City Government | accessdate=January 9, 2007[/tpl]  Each village has a planning committee that is appointed directly by the city council. According to the village planning handbook issued by the city, the purpose of the village planning committees is to work with the city's planning commission to ensure a balance of housing and employment in each village, concentrate development at identified village cores, and to promote the unique character and identity of the villages.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phoenix.gov/PLANNING/vpbook.pdf|title=The Village Planning Handbook|publisher=City of Phoenix|accessdate=July 7, 2009|format=PDF[/tpl]
The 15 urban villages are:
In addition to the above urban villages, Phoenix has a variety of commonly referred-to regions and districts, such as Downtown, Midtown, West Phoenix, North Phoenix, South Phoenix, Biltmore, Arcadia, and Sunnyslope.

===Climate===

Phoenix has a subtropical desert climate (Köppen: BWh), typical of the Sonoran Desert in which it lies. Phoenix has extremely hot summers and warm winters. The average summer high temperatures are some of the hottest of any major city in the United States, and approach those of cities such as Riyadh and Baghdad. On average (1981–2010), there are 107 days annually with a high of at least [tpl]convert|100|°F|0[/tpl],[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=psr|title = NowData – NOAA Online Weather Data|publisher = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate = January 15, 2013[/tpl] including most days from late May through early October. Highs top [tpl]convert|110|°F|0[/tpl] an average of 18 days during the year[ref]
</ref>  Every day from June 10 through August 24, 1993, the temperature in Phoenix reached 100&nbsp;°F or more, the longest continuous number of days (76) in the city's history.  Officially, the number of days with a high of at least 100&nbsp;°F ranges from 143 in 1989 to 48 in 1913.  For comparison, since 1870, New York City has seen a temperature of 100 degrees or more a total of only 59 days.  On June 26, 1990, the temperature reached an all-time recorded high of [tpl]convert|122|°F|0[/tpl].<ref>[tpl]cite web | url=http://phoenix-az.knoji.com/10-alltime-hottest-weather-temperature-days-in-phoenix/| title=10 All-Time Hottest Weather Temperature Days in Phoenix | publisher=Knoji | accessdate=February 5, 2014 | last=Dorish | first=Joe[/tpl]</ref>
Most deserts undergo drastic fluctuations between day and nighttime temperatures, but not Phoenix due to the urban heat island effect.  As the city has expanded, average summer low temps have been rising steadily.  The daily heat of the sun is stored in pavement, sidewalks and buildings, and is radiated back out at night.[tpl]cite book|title=Insider's Guide: Phoenix & Scottsdale|publisher=Morris Book Publishing|editor-last=Sirois|editor-first=Kevin | isbn=978-0-7627-7321-3 | edition=7th | year=2012 | page=186[/tpl]  During the summer, overnight lows greater than [tpl]convert|80|°F|°C|abbr=on[/tpl] are commonplace, as the daily normal low remains at or above 80 °F from June 22 to September 8. On average, 67 days throughout the year will see the nighttime low at or above [tpl]convert|80|°F|abbr=on[/tpl]. July 15, 2003 officially saw the record high daily minimum temperature, at [tpl]convert|96|°F|°C|abbr=on[/tpl].[ref]

The city averages over 330 days of sunshine, or over 90%, per year, and receives scant rainfall, the average annual total at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport being [tpl]convert|7|in[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://phoenix.gov/citygovernment/facts/stats/general/community/index.html |title=Community Profile |publisher=Phoenix.gov|accessdate=February 5, 2014[/tpl]  Precipitation is sparse during most of the year, but the monsoon season brings an influx of moisture.  The monsoon season officially started when the average Dew point was 55 degrees for three days in a row; however, in 2008 the National Weather Service decreed that from that point forward, June 15 would be the official first day of the monsoon, and it would end on September 30.[tpl]cite web | url=http://phoenix.about.com/od/weather/a/monsoontrivia.htm | title=Phoenix Monsoon Facts | publisher=phoenix.about.com | accessdate=February 5, 2014[/tpl] The monsoon raises humidity levels and can cause heavy localized precipitation, occasional flooding, large hail, strong winds, the rare tornado, and dust storms,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.researchhistory.org/2011/07/08/worst-dust-storm-in-arizona-history/ | title=Sweeping Dust Storm in Arizona History | publisher=Research History | accessdate=February 5, 2014[/tpl] which can rise to the level of a haboob in some years.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.weather.com/news/haboob-blasts-through-phoenix-20130712 | title=Haboob Blasts Through Phoenix Area | publisher=The Weather Channel | accessdate=February 5, 2014[/tpl] July is the wettest month of the year ([tpl]convert|1.05|in[/tpl]), while June is the driest ([tpl]convert|.02|in[/tpl]).
On average, Phoenix has only one day per year where the temperature drops to or below freezing. However, the frequency of freezes increases the further one moves outward from the urban heat island. Frequently, outlying areas of Phoenix see frost. Officially, the earliest freeze on record occurred on November 4, 1956, and the latest occurred on March 31, 1987.Since Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX) opened, the earliest and latest freezes recorded there are November 3, 1946 and April 4, 1945, respectively. However, as the official Phoenix climatology station was changed to PHX in October 1953, those records are not considered official. The all-time lowest recorded temperature in Phoenix was [tpl]convert|16|°F|0[/tpl] on January 7, 1913, while the coldest daily maximum was [tpl]convert|36|°F|0[/tpl] on December 10, 1898. The longest continuous stretch without a day of frost in Phoenix was over 5 years, from November 23, 1979 to January 31, 1985.[tpl]cite web | url=http://ag.arizona.edu/maricopa/garden/html/weather/frost.htm | title=Frost in the Valley of the Sun | publisher=The University of Arizona | accessdate=March 5, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/garden/az1002.pdf | title=Frost Protection | publisher=The University of Arizona | accessdate=March 5, 2014[/tpl]  Snow is a very rare occurrence for the city of Phoenix. Snowfall was first officially recorded in 1898, and since then, accumulations of [tpl]convert|0.1|in|cm[/tpl] or greater have occurred only eight times. The heaviest snowstorm on record dates to January 21–22, 1937, when [tpl]convert|1|to|4|in|cm[/tpl] fell in parts of the city and did not melt entirely for three days. Before that, [tpl]convert|1|in|cm[/tpl] had fallen on January 20, 1933. On February 2, 1939, [tpl]convert|0.5|in|cm[/tpl] fell. Snow also fell on March 12, 1917 and on November 28, 1919. The most recent snow of significance fell on, December 6, 1998 across the northwest portions of the valley that are below 2,000 feet. During the 1998 event, Sky Harbor reported a dusting of snow. The last measurable snowfall was recorded when [tpl]convert|0.1|in|cm[/tpl] fell in central Phoenix on December 11, 1985.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/psr/general/history/index.php?page=snow |title=A history of snow fall in Phoenix|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=December 5, 2011[/tpl]
On December 30, 2010 and February 20, 2013, graupel fell, although it was widely believed to be snow.[ref]

===Flora and fauna===

Unusual species are occasionally found within Phoenix boundaries and surrounding areas of Arizona. Native species include desert tortoises, gila monsters, roadrunners, coyotes, chuckwallas (large lizards), javelina (wild pigs), bobcats, jaguars, and mountain lions. There are many species of falcons, hawks, golden and bald eagles, and the state bird, the cactus wren.[tpl]cite web | url=http://phoenix.gov/recreation/rec/parks/preserves/outdoor/wildlife/index.html | title=The Wildlife of the Phoenix Mountain Preserves | publisher=phoenix.gov | accessdate=February 10, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.azgfd.gov/w_c/urban_az_wildlife.shtml |title=Living With Wildlife – Arizona Wildlife | publisher=Arizona Game and Fish Department | accessdate=February 10, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.city-data.com/states/Arizona-Flora-and-fauna.html|title=Arizona – Flora and fauna | publisher=city-data.com | accessdate=February 10, 2014[/tpl] Phoenix is also home to a plethora of snakes, such as the western diamondback rattlesnake, sonoran sidewinder, several other types of rattlesnakes, sonoran coralsnake, and dozens of other non-venomous snakes, including the California kingsnake.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.phoenixsnakeremoval.com/snakes-of-phoenix.php | title=Common Snakes of the Phoenix Area | publisher=Phoenix Snake Removal | accessdate=February 10, 2014[/tpl]
The Arizona Upland subdivision of the Sonoran Desert (of which Phoenix is a part) has the most structurally diverse vegetation in the United States. It includes one of the most famous species of succulents, the giant saguaro cactus. Other important species are organpipe, ocotillo, barrel, prickly pear and cholla cacti, Palo Verde trees, various types of palm trees, agaves, foothill and blue paloverde, ironwood, mesquite and creosote bush.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.desertmuseum.org/center/swbiodiversity.php | title=Sonoran Desert Region Flora – Maricopa County | publisher=Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum | accessdate=February 10, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://southwest.library.arizona.edu/azso/body.1_div.4.html | title=Natural Vegetation of Arizona | publisher=University of Arizona Library | accessdate=February 10, 2014[/tpl]

==Demographics==

Phoenix is the sixth most populous city in the United States according to the 2010 United States Census, with a population of 1,445,632, making it the most populous state capital in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/phoenix/articles/2011/03/13/20110313phoenix-6th-largest-city-philadelphia.html |title=Arizona Republic: "Phoenix drops to sixth largest city."|first= Lynh|last= Bui|publisher=Azcentral.com |date=March 13, 2011 |accessdate=June 19, 2012[/tpl]  Phoenix's ranking as the sixth most populous city was a drop from the number five position it had held since the U. S. Census Bureau released population estimates on June 28, 2007.  Those statistics used data from 2006, which showed Phoenix's population at 1,512,986, which put it just ahead of Philadelphia.  The 2010 Census, while showing an overall increase from the official 2000 Census showed a drop in Phoenix' population from the 2007 estimates, allowing Philadelphia to regain the fifth spot.
After leading the nation in population growth for over a decade, the sub-prime mortgage crisis, followed by the recession, led to a slowing in the growth of Phoenix. There were approximately 77,000 people added to the population of the Phoenix metropolitan area in 2009, which was down significantly from its peak in 2006 of 162,000.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/032410_census/census-estimates-show-sharp-drop-arizonas-population-growth/ | title=Census estimates show sharp drop in Arizona's population growth | publisher=Tucson Sentinel |last=Van Velzer | first=Ryan |accessdate=February 9, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/census/2011-04-07-1Acities07_ST_N.htm | title=Most major U.S. cities show population declines | publisher=US Today | last=El Nasser | first=Haya |accessdate=February 9, 2014[/tpl]  Despite this slowing, Phoenix's population grew by 9.4% since the 2000 census (a total of 124,000 people), while the entire Phoenix metropolitan area grew by 28.9% during the same period. This compares with an overall growth rate nationally during the same time frame of 9.7%.[tpl]cite web | url=http://phoenix.about.com/cs/living/a/census01_2.htm | title=Arizona Statistics: Taking a Look at Census 2010 | publisher=phoenix.about.com | accessdate=February 9, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0020.pdf | title=Large Metropolitan Statistical Areas—Population: 1990 to 2010 | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau | accessdate=March 19, 2014[/tpl]  Not since 1940-50, when the city had a population of 107,000, had the city gained less than 124,000 in a decade.  And when you look at the growth as a percentage of the population, you have to go all the way back to the 1880-90 census period to find a lower growth rate than the 9.4% Phoenix experienced during the last decade.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.newgeography.com/content/002115-phoenix-population-counts-lower-expected | title=Phoenix Population Counts Lower than Expected | publisher=newgeography.com | last=Cox | first=Wendell |accessdate=February 9, 2014[/tpl]
The Phoenix Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) (officially known as the Phoenix-Mesa-Glendale MSA), is one of 10 MSA's in Arizona, and is the 14th largest in the United States, with a total population of 4,192,887 as of the 2010 Census. Consisting of parts of both Pinal and Maricopa counties, the MSA accounts for 65.5% of the total population of the state of Arizona. Phoenix only contributed 13% to the total growth rate of the MSA, down significantly from its 33% share during the prior decade.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.newgeography.com/content/002115-phoenix-population-counts-lower-expected | title=Phoenix Population Counts Lower than Expected | publisher=newgeography.com | last=Cox | first=Wendell |accessdate=February 9, 2014[/tpl] Phoenix is also part of the Arizona Sun Corridor megaregion (MR), which is the 10th most populous of the 11 MRs, and the 8th largest by area.  It had the 2nd largest growth by percentage of the MRs (behind only the Gulf Coast MR) between 2000 and 2010.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.america2050.org/megaregions.html | title=Megaregions | publisher=america2050 | accessdate=February 10, 2014[/tpl]
The population is almost equally split between men and women, with men making up 50.2% of city's citizens. The population density is 2,797.8 people per square mile, and the median age of the city is 32.2 years, with only 10.9 of the population being over 62. 98.5% of Phoenix's population lives in households with an average household size of 2.77 people. There were 514,806 total households, with 64.2% of those households consisting of families: 42.3% married couples, 7% with an unmarried male as head of household, and 14.9% with an unmarried female as head of household. 33.6% of those households have children below the age of 18. Of the 35.8% of non-family households, 27.1% of them have a householder living alone, almost evenly split between men and women, with women having 13.7% and men occupying 13.5%.  Phoenix has 590,149 housing units, with an occupancy rate of 87.2%.  The largest segment of vacancies is in the rental market, where the vacancy rate is 14.9%, and 51% of all vacancies are in rentals.  Vacant houses for sale only make up 17.7% of the vacancies, with the rest being split among vacation properties and other various reasons.[tpl]cite web | url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_DP_DPDP1 | title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| accessdate=February 9, 2014[/tpl]
The median income for a household in the city was $47,866, and the median income for a family was $54,804. Males had a median income of $32,820 versus $27,466 for females. The per capita income for the city was $24,110. 21.8% of the population and 17.1% of families were below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 31.4% of those under the age of 18 and 10.5% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.[tpl]cite web | url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_5YR_DP03 | title=SELECTED ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS: 2008–2012 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau | accessdate=February 9, 2014[/tpl]
According to the 2010 Census, the racial breakdown of Phoenix is as follows:[tpl]cite web | url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_SF1_QTP3 | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau | title=Race and Hispanic or Latino Origin: 2010 | accessdate=March 2, 2014[/tpl]
Phoenix's population has historically been predominantly white.  Since 1890, up until 1970, over 90% of the citizens were white, although in recent years, this percentage has dropped; first to 85% in 1980, than to 81% in 1990.  In 2010, it had dipped to 65%.  However, a significant portion of this decrease can be attributed to new guidelines put out by the U.S. Census Bureau in 1980, when a question regarding Hispanic origin was added to the census questionnaire.  This has led to an increasing tendency for some groups to no longer self-identify as white, and instead categorize themselves as "other races".[tpl]cite web|title=Arizona – Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html| accessdate=March 2, 2014[/tpl]  20.6% of the population of the city was foreign born in 2010.  Of the 1,342,803 residents over 5 years of age, 63.5% speak only English, 30.6% speak Spanish as their primary language, 2.5% speak another Indo-European language, 2.1% speak Asian or Islander languages, with the remaining 1.4% speaking other languages.  15.7% of non-English speakers speak English less than "very well". The ancestral breakdown has the top 10 ancestries as: Mexican (35.9%), German (15.3%), Irish (10.3%), English (9.4%), Black (6.5%), Italian (4.5%), French (2.7%), Polish (2.5%), American Indian (2.2%), and Scottish (2.0%).[tpl]cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_1YR_DP02&prodType=table | title=SELECTED SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS IN THE UNITED STATES: 2012 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau | accessdate=March 19, 2014[/tpl]
In 2010, according to the Association of Religion Data Archives, which conducts religious census each ten years, 39% of those polled in Maricopa county considered themselves a member of a religious group, down from 40% in 2000.  Of those who expressed a religion, the area's religious composition was reported as 35% Catholic, 22% to Evangelical Protestant denominations, 16% Latter-Day Saints (LDS), 14% to nondenominational congregations, 7% to Mainline Protestant denominations, and 2% Hindu. The remaining 4% belong to other religions, such as Buddhism, and Judaism.  While there was an overall increase in the number of religious adherents over the decade of 103,000, that did not keep pace with the overall population increase in the country during the same period, which increased by almost three-quarters of million individuals, resulting in the percentage drop.  The largest aggregate increases were in the LDS (a 58% increase) and Evangelical Protestant churches (14% increase), while all other categories actually saw their numbers drop slightly, or remain static.  Overall, the Catholic Church had an 8% drop, while Mainline Protestant groups saw a 28% decline.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/c/04/rcms2010_04013_county_tradition_2010.asp |title=2010 U.S. Religion Census: Religious Congregations & Membership Study. |publisher=The Association of Religious Data Archives |accessdate=March 19, 2014[/tpl]

==Economy==

The early economy of Phoenix was focused primarily on agriculture and natural resources, dependent mainly on the "5Cs" which were copper, cattle, climate, cotton and citrus.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.azsos.gov/public_services/kids/five_Cs.htm | title=The Five C's – An Arizona History Lesson | publisher=azsos.gov | accessdate=February 11, 2014[/tpl]   Once the Salt River Project was completed, the city, and the valley in general, began to develop more rapidly, due to a now fairly reliable source of water. Led by agriculture, the number one crop in the 1910s was alfalfa, followed by citrus, cotton and other crops, with almost a quarter-million acres under cultivation by the middle of the decade.  World War I would greatly change the agricultural landscape of the valley, and teach the farmers of the region an invaluable, if difficult lesson.[tpl]sfn|Luckingham|1989|p.74[/tpl][tpl]sfn|VanderMeer|2010|p.32[/tpl]
As the war began, imports of foreign cotton were no longer available to American manufacturing, since cotton was a major material used in the production of tires and airplane fabric, those manufacturers began to look for new sources.  The Salt River Valley looked to be an ideal location for expansion of the cotton crop.  Led by Goodyear, tire and airplane manufacturers began to buy more and more cotton from valley growers.  In fact, the town of Goodyear was founded during this period when the company purchased desert acreage southwest of Phoenix to grow cotton.  By 1918, cotton had replaced alfalfa as the number one industry in Phoenix.  As the price of cotton rose, more and more of Phoenix acreage was devoted to the crop, however, in 1920, when cotton accounted for three-quarters of the cultivated acreage in the valley, the bottom fell out of the cotton market due to the dual reasons of lower demand due to the end of the war production machine and foreign growers now once again having access to the American market, resulting in their shipping large amounts of cotton to the U.S. This led to a diversification of crops in the valley from that point forward.[tpl]sfn|Luckingham|1989|pp.74-76[/tpl][tpl]sfn|VanderMeer|2010|p.32[/tpl]
Cattle, and the meat industry was also a vital part of the economy.  The cotton bust led to more production of alfalfa, wheat and barley, as well as citrus.  The grain production in turn led to an increase in the cattle ranching industry.  By the end of the Roaring Twenties, Phoenix boasted the largest meat processing plant between Dallas and Los Angeles.[tpl]sfn|Luckingham|1989|p.76[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.tovreacastle.com/articles/history-of-arizona/ | title=History of Arizona – Ed A. Tovrea | publisher=Tovrea Castle | accessdate=February 11, 2014[/tpl] While that plant, and its attendant stockyards are long gone, a remnant remains in the famous Stockyards Restaurant.  The prosperity following the local depression caused by the cotton bust enabled other industries to grow as well.  The city's first skyscraper, the 7-story Heard Building was built in 1920, followed by the 10-story Luhrs Building following the bust in 1924, and the Westward Ho, a 16-story hotel was constructed in 1928.[tpl]sfn|Luckingham|1989|p.79[/tpl]
With the establishment of a main rail line in 1926 (the Southern Pacific), the opening of the Union Station in 1923, and the creation of Sky Harbor airport by the end of the decade, it allowed greater ease of access to the city.[tpl]sfn|VanderMeer|2010|p.44[/tpl] The construction of the Westward Ho was part of a concerted effort on the part of both civic and business organizations in Phoenix to develop Phoenix as a tourist destination.  Phoenix already had two highly rated resorts, the Ingleside Inn and the Jokake Inn, and after the Westward Ho, the Arizona Biltmore, designed by one of Frank Lloyd Wright's students, was constructed in 1929.[tpl]sfn|Luckingham|1989|p.86[/tpl] Other major hotels were built during this era, such as the San Carlos (also in 1928), which led older hotels, like the Hotel Adams to refurbish themselves in order to remain competitive.[tpl]sfn|Luckingham|1989|p.86[/tpl] By the end of the decade, the tourism industry topped $10 million for the first time in the city's history.[tpl]sfn|Luckingham|1989|p.88[/tpl] Tourism remains one of the top ten economic drivers of the city to this day.
The Great Depression affected Phoenix, just as it did every other location in the country, but the effects were not as deep, nor lasted as long.  Phoenix had a very diverse economy, and was not heavily vested in the manufacturing sector.[tpl]sfn|VanderMeer|2010|p.79[/tpl] While the stock market crash did not affect the city very directly, the suppression of the national economy did.  Revenue from all major industries in the valley decreased drastically: copper mining dropped from $155 million in 1929 to $15 million by 1932; agriculture and livestock also saw reductions during that same period, although not as drastic, from $42 million to $14 million and $25.5 million to $15 million, respectively. Compared to the rest of the country, and even the rest of the state, Phoenix was not as badly affected by bankruptcies, foreclosures, or unemployment, and by 1934, the recovery was underway.[tpl]sfn|Luckingham|1989|p.102[/tpl]
At the conclusion of World War II, the valley's economy began to further grow and expand.  After the war, the city's population began to surge as many men who had undergone their military training at the various bases in and around Phoenix, returned with their families.  In 1948, Motorola chose Phoenix for the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. They were followed in time,  by other high-tech companies such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas.
The construction industry, spurred on by the city's growth, further expanded with the development of Sun City.  Much like Levittown, New York became the template for suburban development in post-WWII America,[tpl]cite journal| title=Levittown: the Archetype for Suburban Development | journal=American History Magazine | date=October 2007[/tpl] Sun City, just northwest of Phoenix, became the template for retirement communities when Del E. Webb opened the community in 1960. Over 100,000 people visited the community during the opening weekend.[tpl]cite web | url=http://sunaz.com/history/| title=The History of Sun City | publisher=sunaz.com | accessdate=February 11, 2014[/tpl]
As the financial crisis of 2007–10 began, construction in Phoenix collapsed in 2008, and housing prices plunged. Historically, Arizona trailed the rest of the country into recession but due to the prominence of the construction industry in its economy, Phoenix entered this last recession before the rest of the country.[tpl]cite journal | page=2 | journal=Arizona's Economy | publisher=Eller College of Management | title= Economic Outlook for 2009–2010: Riding Out the Storm | last=Vest | first=Marshall J. | date=January 2009 | issue=Winter[/tpl]
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S. Department of Commerce, in 2012 (the latest year for which data is available), the Phoenix MSA had a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of just over $201 billion, a 4.5% increase over the prior year.  Phoenix's GDP finally exceeded the high it had attained in 2008, prior to the recession. The top 10 industries were, in descending order:  real estate ($31B), financial services ($21.3B), manufacturing ($16.8B), health care ($15.7B), retail ($14.9B), wholesale ($12.9B), professional services ($12.8B), construction ($10.4B), waste management ($9.1B), and tourism ($6.8B).  Government, if it had been a private industry, would have been ranked third on the list, generating $18.9 billion.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=70&step=1&isuri=1&acrdn=2#reqid=70&step=10&isuri=1&7007=2012&7093=levels&7090=70&7035=-1&7036=-1&7001=2200&7002=2&7003=200&7004=naics&7005=-1&7006=38060 | title=GDP by Metropolitan Area | publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis | accessdate=February 11, 2014[/tpl]  Manufacturing now ranks third among Phoenix's industries, and includes the production of computers and other electronic equipment, missiles, aircraft parts, chemicals, and processed foods.
In major job markets, as defined as those markets with greater than 1 million jobs, Greater Phoenix ranked number 1 in employment growth prior to the recession beginning in 2007.  Just three years later, it ended its free fall in job growth by hitting the bottom of the list of those 28 major markets, dead last. However, 2013 saw Greater Phoenix rebound to 7th. Arizona's year-over-year job growth (of which Phoenix is the main driver) continued to outpace the nation through August 2013. Arizona's year-over-year job growth was at or above 2.0% each month of that year. In contrast, national job growth was between 1.5% and 1.7% on a year-over-year basis.[tpl]cite journal | page=1 | journal=Arizona's Economy | publisher=Eller College of Management | title=Still in a Hole, But Making Progress: Fourth Quarter Forecast Update | first=George W. | last=Hammond | date=January 2014 | issue=Winter[/tpl][tpl]cite web| url=http://www.edpco.com/files/Desert_Lifestyle_-_Economic_Snapshot.pdf | title=If you liked 2013, you'll probably enjoy 2014 | publisher=ArizonaEconomy.com | accessdate=February 11, 2014[/tpl]  Arizona is forecast to regain its previous employment peak in 2015, making it eight years for the state to get back to even terms after the Great Recession; the national economy is currently forecast to replace all of the jobs lost by 2014, one year earlier than Arizona. This is due to the more severe downturn in Arizona as compared to the rest of the nation, as evidenced by the fact that from peak to trough, Arizona jobs declined by 11.8%, compared to 6.3% for the nation.[tpl]sfn|Hammond|2014|p=3[/tpl]  In 2013, the Phoenix area saw a 2.7% increase in non-farm employment, from 1.758 million to 1.805 million.

===Fine arts===

The downtown Phoenix art scene has developed in the past decade. The Artlink organization and the galleries downtown have successfully launched a First Friday cross-Phoenix gallery opening. In April 2009, artist Janet Echelman inaugurated her monumental sculpture, Her Secret Is Patience, a civic icon suspended above the new Phoenix Civic Space Park, a two-city-block park in the middle of downtown. This netted sculpture makes the invisible patterns of desert wind visible to the human eye. During the day, the [tpl]convert|100|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl]-tall sculpture hovers high above heads, treetops, and buildings, the sculpture creates what the artist calls "shadow drawings", which she says are inspired by Phoenix's cloud shadows. At night, the illumination changes color gradually through the seasons. Author Prof. Patrick Frank writes of the sculpture that "... most Arizonans look on the work with pride: this unique visual delight will forever mark the city of Phoenix just as the Eiffel Tower marks Paris."

===Tourism===

The tourist industry is the longest running of today's top industries in Phoenix.

===Cuisine===

Like many other western towns, the earliest restaurants in Phoenix were often steakhouses.  In addition, Phoenix is also renowned for authentic Mexican food, thanks to both the large Hispanic population and proximity to Mexico. Like other major cities, some of the restaurants have a long and storied history.  The Stockyards steakhouse dates to 1947, while Monti's La Casa Vieja (Spanish for "The Old House") has been in operation as a restaurant since the 1890s.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.stockyardssteakhouse.com/history.html | title=Stockyards Steakhouse | publisher=stockyardssteakhouse.com | accessdate=February 9, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.montis.com/history.php | title=Monti's | publisher=montis.com |accessdate=February 9, 2014[/tpl]  Macayo's (a Mexican restaurant chain) was established in Phoenix in 1946, and other major Mexican restaurants include Garcia's (1956) and Manuel's (1964).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.macayo.com/about-us/history.php | title=History | publisher=Macayo's | accessdate=March 20, 2014[/tpl] The recent population boom has brought people from all over the nation, and to a lesser extent from other countries, and has since influenced the local cuisine. Today Phoenix, like most other large cities in the U.S. boasts cuisines from all over the world, such as Korean, barbecue, Cajun/Creole, Greek, Hawaiian, Irish, Japanese, sushi, Italian, fusion, Persian, Indian, Spanish, Thai, Chinese, southwestern, tex-mex, Vietnamese, Brazilian, and French.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.phoenixrestaurants.com/cuisine_all.cfm | title=Phoenix Restaurants by Cuisine Type | publisher=phoenixrestaurants.com | accessdate=February 9, 2014[/tpl]
Although a McDonald's restaurant which opened in Des Plaines, Illinois in 1955 is often incorrectly identified as the first franchise, the McDonald brothers actually sold their first franchise to a Phoenix entrepreneur in 1952.  Neil Fox, paid $1,000 for the rights to open an establishment based on the McDonald's brothers' restaurant. The McDonalds anticipated that once they had received the fee, they would have no further involvement with the property. Expecting the new restaurant to be called "Fox's", they were shocked when they learned that Fox wanted to call it McDonalds, "'What the hell for?' Dick McDonald asked Fox, 'McDonald's' means nothing in Phoenix.'"[tpl]cite web | url=http://doney.net/aroundaz/celebrity/mcdonald_bros.htm | title=McDonald Brothers | publisher=Around Arizona |accessdate=February 9, 2014[/tpl]  The hamburger stand opened in 1953 on the southwest corner of Central Avenue and Indian School Road on the growing north side of Phoenix, and was the first location to sport the now internationally known "arches", which were twice the height of the building. Three other franchise locations opened that year, a full two years before Kroc purchased McDonald's and opened his first franchise in Illinois.  It was also the site where the trademark "Golden Arches" were first used.

==Sports==

The Arizona Cardinals are the oldest continuously run professional football franchise in the nation.  They moved to Phoenix from St. Louis, Missouri in 1988 and currently play in the Western Division of the National Football League's National Football Conference. The Cardinals were founded in 1898 in Chicago, as the Morgan Athletic Club, and became known as the Cardinals shortly after, due to the color of their jerseys.  Around the turn of the last century, they were known as the Racine Cardinals, and in 1920, they became a charter member of the American Professional Football League, which would eventually become the National Football League.  Upon their move to Phoenix, the Cardinals originally played their home games at Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University in nearby Tempe.  In 2006 they moved to the newly constructed University of Phoenix Stadium in suburban Glendale.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.azcardinals.com/history/franchise.html | title=Franchise History | publisher=Arizona Cardinals | accessdate=February 14, 2014[/tpl] Since moving to Phoenix, the Cardinals have made one championship appearance, Super Bowl XLIII on February 1, 2009, where they lost 27-23 to the Pittsburgh Steelers.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/43 | title=Alone On Top | publisher=The National Football League | accessdate=March 29, 2014[/tpl]

==Parks and recreation==

Phoenix is home to a large number of parks and recreation areas. The city of Phoenix includes national parks, county (Maricopa County) parks and city parks.  Tonto National Forest forms part of the northeast boundary of the city, while the county has the largest park system in the country.Sirois 2012, page 195  The city park system was established to preserve the deseart landscape in areas that would otherwise have succumbed to development, and includes South Mountain Park, the world's largest municipal park with [tpl]convert|16500|acre|km2[/tpl].Sirois 2012, page 201  The city park system has 189 parks which contain over 33,000 acres, and has facilities for hiking, camping, swimming, horseback riding, cycling, and climbing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://phoenix.gov/parks/aboutparks/index.html|title=Parks and Recreation: About Us |publisher=Phoenix.gov|accessdate=February 7, 2014[/tpl]  Some of the other notable parks in the system are Camelback Mountain, Encanto Park (another large urban park) and Sunnyslope Mountain, also known as "S" Mountain.Sirois 2012, page 196  Papago Park in east Phoenix is home to both the Desert Botanical Garden and the Phoenix Zoo, in addition to several golf courses and the Hole-in-the-Rock geological formation.  The Desert Botanical Garden, which opened in 1939, is one of the few public gardens in the country dedicated to desert plants, and displays desert plant life from all over the world.  The Phoenix Zoo is the largest privately owned non-profit zoo in the United States, and is internationally known for its programs devoted to saving endangered species.Sirois 2012, page 147
In addition, many waterparks are scattered throughout the valley to help residents cope with the desert heat during the summer months. Some of the notable parks include Big Surf in Tempe, Wet 'n' Wild Phoenix in Phoenix, Golfland Sunsplash in Mesa, and the Oasis Water Park at the Arizona Grand Resort – formerly known as Pointe South Mountain Resort – in Phoenix. The area also has two small amusement parks, Castles N' Coasters in north Phoenix, next to the Metrocenter Mall and Enchanted Island located at Encanto Park.

==Government==

In 1913, Phoenix adopted a new form of government, switching from the mayor-council system to the council-manager system, making it one of the first cities in the United States with this form of city government, where a strong city manager supervises all city departments and executes the policies adopted by the Council.[tpl]cite web | url=http://phoenix.gov/citygovernment/facts/history/index.html | publisher=City of Phoenix | title=Establishing a Council-Manager Government | accessdate=March 2, 2014[/tpl][tpl]sfn|VanderMeer|2010|p=73[/tpl]
The city council consists of a mayor and eight city council members. While the mayor is elected in a citywide election, Phoenix City Council members are elected by votes only in the districts they represent, with both the Mayor and the Council members serving four year terms.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phoenix.gov/mayorcouncil/about/index.html |title=Official Site of the City of Phoenix- About the Phoenix City Council |publisher=Phoenix.gov |accessdate=June 19, 2012[/tpl]  The current mayor of Phoenix is Greg Stanton, a Democrat who was elected to a four-year term in 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://phoenix.gov/mayor/index.html |title=Official website of the City of Phoenix- Mayor Home |publisher=Phoenix.gov |accessdate=June 19, 2012[/tpl] In setting city policy and passing rules and regulations, the mayor and city council members each have equal voting power.

===Crime===

By the 1960s crime was becoming a significant problem in Phoenix, and by the 1970s crime continued to increase in the city at a faster rate than almost anywhere else in the country.[tpl]sfn|VanderMeer|2010|p=252[/tpl] It was during this time frame when an incident occurred in Phoenix which would have national implications. On March 16, 1963, Ernesto Miranda was arrested and charged with the rape of a mildly retarded teen-aged girl.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nndb.com/people/596/000125221/ | title=Ernesto Miranda, AKA Ernesto Arturo Miranda | publisher=NNDB | accessdate=April 4, 2014[/tpl]  The subsequent Supreme Court ruling on June 13, 1966, in the matter of Miranda v. Arizona, has led to practice in the United States of issuing a Miranda Warning to all suspected criminals.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.mirandawarning.org/historyofmirandawarning.html | title=History of Miranda Warning | publisher=mirandawarning.org | accessdate=April 4, 2014[/tpl]
By the mid 1970s, Phoenix was close to or at the top of the list for cities with the highest crime rate.  The mayor during the mid-70s, Mayor Graham, introduced policies which raised Phoenix from near the bottom of the statistics regarding police officers per capita, to where it resided in the middle of the rankings. He also implemented other changes, including establishing a juvenile department within the police force. With Phoenix's rapid growth, it drew the attention of con men and racketeers, with one of the prime areas of activity being land fraud.  The practice became so widespread that newspapers would refer to Phoenix as the Tainted Desert.[tpl]sfn|VanderMeer|2010|pp=252-3[/tpl]
These land frauds led to one of the more infamous murders in the history of the valley, when Arizona Republic writer Don Bolles was murdered by a car bomb at the Clarendon Hotel in 1976.[tpl]sfn|Vandermeer|2010|p=253[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Luckingham|1989|pp=211-2[/tpl] It was believed that his investigative reporting on organized crime and land fraud in Phoenix made him a target.[tpl]cite web | url=http://archive.azcentral.com/specials/special01/articles/0528bolles-overview.html | title=Journalism students revisit the death of Don Bolles | publisher=Arizona Republic/azcentral.com | date=March 28, 2006 | accessdate=April 4, 2014[/tpl] Bolles' last words referred to Phoenix land and cattle magnate Kemper Marley,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1993-02-10/news/the-bolles-trial-goes-into-reruns/full | title=The Bolles Trial Goes Into Reruns | last=Fitzpatrick | first=Tom | date=February 10, 1993 | publisher=Phoenix New Times | accessdate=April 4, 2014[/tpl] who was widely regarded to have ordered Bolles' murder, as well as John Harvey Adamson, who pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 1977 in return for testimony against contractors Max Dunlap and James Robison.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special01/0528bolles-keyplayers.html | title=Key players in the Bolles' case | publisher=Arizona Republic/azcentral.com | accessdate=February 19, 2014[/tpl]
The trial gained national attention since Bolles was the only reporter from a major U.S. newspaper to be murdered on U.S. soil due to his coverage of a story, and led to reporters from all over the country descending on Phoenix to cover his murder. Dunlap was convicted of first degree murder in the case in 1990 and remained in prison, until his death on July 21, 2009, while Robison was acquitted, but pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting violence against Adamson. Street gangs and the drug trade had turned into public safety issues by the 1980s. Despite continued improvements in the size of the police force and other anti-crime measures, the crime rate in Phoenix continued to grow, albeit at a lower growth rate than other southwestern cities.[tpl]sfn|VanderMeer|2010|p=323[/tpl]
After seeing a peak in the early and mid 1990s, the city has seen a general decrease in both the violent and property crime rates.  1993 saw the creation of "Tent City," by Sheriff Joe Arpaio, using inmate labor, to alleviate overcrowding in the Maricopa County Jail system, the fourth-largest in the world.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.azcentral.com/centennial/ent/articles/2011/10/08/20111008arizona-architecture-postmodern-now-timeline.html | title=Timeline: 1980–2010 | publisher=The Arizona Republic/AZCentral.com | accessdate=February 27, 2014[/tpl]  The violent crime rate peaked in 1993 at 1146 crimes per 100,000 people, while the property crime rate peaked a few years earlier, in 1989, at 9,966 crimes per 100,000.  In the most recent numbers from the FBI (2012), those rates currently stand at 637 and 4091, respectively.  When compared to the other cities on the 10 most populated list, this ranks Phoenix 5th and 6th, respectively.  Since their peak in 2003, murders have dropped from 241 to 123 in 2012.  Assaults have also dropped from 7800 in 1993 to 5260 in 2012.  In the 20 years since 1993, there have only been five years in which the violent crime rate has not declined.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/Local/RunCrimeJurisbyJurisLarge.cfm | title=Uniform Crime Reports | publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation | accessdate=February 19, 2014[/tpl]
The year 2012 was an anomaly to the general downward trend in violent crime in Phoenix, with the rates for every single violent crime, except rape, showing an increase.  The murder rate increased by 15.4% and aggravated assaults jumped by 27%, while rapes were down by 2%.  However, the property crime rate returned to the downward trend begun in the 1990s, after a slight uptick in the previous two years.  Vehicle thefts, which have been perceived as a major issue in the Valley of the Sun for decades, saw a continuation of a downward trend begun over a decade ago.  In 2001 Phoenix ranked first in the nation in vehicle thefts, with over 22,000 cars stolen that year.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.888notheft.com/888main/pages/III%20-%20Auto%20Theft%20is%20up!.htm | title=Auto Theft, Key Facts | publisher=Insurance Information Institute | accessdate=February 19, 2014 | date=June 2002[/tpl]  That continued in 2002, when car thefts rose to over 25,000, a rate of over 1825 thefts per 100,000 people.  It has declined every year since then, and last year stood at just over 480, a drop of almost 75% in the decade.  According to the "Hot Spots" report put out by the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB), The Phoenix MSA has dropped to 70th in the nation in terms of car thefts in 2012.[tpl]cite web | url= https://www.nicb.org/theft_and_fraud_awareness/top-places-for-vehicle-thefts | title= Hot Spots 2012 | publisher=NICB | accessdate=February 19, 2014[/tpl]
As the first decade of the new century came to a close, Arizona had become the gateway to the U.S. for drug trafficking.  By 2009, seizures in Arizona amounted for approximately half of all Marijuana captured along the U.S.-Mexican border.[tpl]cite web | url= http://www.drugaddictiontreatment.com/addiction-in-the-news/drug-crimes/phoenix-number-two-kidnapping-capital-as-drug-cartel-wars-intensify/ | title=Phoenix Number Two Kidnapping Capital as Drug Cartel Wars Intensify | date= January 28, 2010 | publisher=Drug Addiction Treatment | accessdate=February 19, 2014[/tpl]  Another crime issue related to the drug trade are kidnappings.  In the late 2000s, Phoenix earned the title "Kidnapping capital of the USA".[tpl]cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=6848672&page=1 |date=February 11, 2009 | accessdate=July 29, 2010 | title=Kidnapping Capital of the U.S.A.[/tpl] The majority of the kidnapped are believed to be victims of human smuggling, or related to illegal drug trade, while the kidnappers are believed to be part of Mexican drug cartels, particularly the Sinaloa cartel.

====Rail and bus====

Amtrak served Phoenix Union Station until 1996 when the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) threatened to abandon the route between Yuma, Arizona and Phoenix.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.azta.org/transit_resources/archived_hot_topic/arizona-passenger-railmore-than-just-light-rail-streetcar-and-trolley/ |title=Arizona Transit Association |publisher=Azta.org |accessdate=September 28, 2013[/tpl] Amtrak rerouted trains to Maricopa, 30 miles south of downtown Phoenix, where passengers can board the Texas Eagle (Los Angeles-San Antonio-Chicago) and Sunset Limited (Los Angeles-New Orleans).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.texaseagle.com/stations/MRC.htm |title=Amtrak's Texas Eagle | Maricopa, AZ |publisher=Texaseagle.com |accessdate=September 28, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.trainweb.org/usarail/phoenix.htm | title=Phoenix, AZ | publisher=TrainWeb.org | accessdate=February 13, 2014[/tpl] Though UP ultimately retained the trackage, Amtrak did not return, leaving Phoenix as the most populated city in the U.S. without passenger Amtrak service, although the station is still there (see photo).

====Public transportation====

Valley Metro provides public transportation throughout the metropolitan area, with its trains, buses, and a ride-share program. 3.38% of workers commute by public transit. During the summer it is very difficult to wait for a bus in the heat as many of the stops have no canopies. Valley Metro's [tpl]convert|20|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] light rail project, called METRO, through north-central Phoenix, downtown, and eastward through Tempe and Mesa, opened December 27, 2008. Future rail segments of more than [tpl]convert|30|mi|km[/tpl] are planned to open by 2030.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.valleymetro.org/projects_and_planning/current_projects |title=Current Valley Metro Projects |publisher=Valley Metro |accessdate=February 26, 2014[/tpl]

====Bicycle transportation====

====Roads and freeways====

Phoenix auto traffic depends on both surface streets and freeways.  Freeways fall under the auspices of the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT).  Phoenix ranks first in the nation in the quality of its urban freeways, and the state as a whole ranks first in the nation in the quality of bridges.[tpl]cite book | title=20th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems | publisher=Reason Foundation | date=July 2013 | first1=David T. | last1=Hartgen, Ph.D., P.E. | first2=M. Gregory | last2=Fields | first3=Elizabeth last3=San José[/tpl]  While being the sixth most populous city in the nation, Phoenix's freeways do not suffer from the same type of congestion seen in other large cities.  In fact, in a recent study, there is not a single stretch of freeway in Phoenix ranked in the 100 worst freeways for either congestion or unreliability.[tpl]cite book | title=TTI's 2011 CONGESTED CORRIDORS REPORT | first1=Bill | last1=Eisele | first2=David | last2=Schrank | first3=Tim | last3=Lomax | publisher=Texas A&M-Texas Transportation Institute | date=November 2011[/tpl]
thumb|alt=photo showing the multiple levels of roadways at the interchange between Interstates ten and seventeen, called "the stack" in downtown Phoenix at night.|left|The Stack (Interstates 10 and 17) interchange at night in 2012Part of the reason for this is the extensive freeway system in the city, due to the majority of that system being funded by local, rather than federal funds, through a ½ cent general sales tax measure approved by voters in 1985. Another offshoot of this local funding is that Phoenix is the largest city in the United States to have two Interstate Highways and no 3-digit interstates.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/reports/routefinder/table2.htm |title=Auxiliary Routes of the Dwight D.

As of 2005, the metropolitan area of Phoenix contains one of the nation's largest and fastest growing freeway systems, boasting over 1,405 lane miles.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/viewpoints/articles/2008/09/07/20080907vip-lavsphx0907.html |title=Transformation into Big City has Benefits, Burdens |work=Arizona Republic |first1=Yuri |last1=Artibise |first2=Grady |last2=Gammage Jr. |first3=Nancy |last3=Welch |date=September 7, 2008 |accessdate = October 12, 2008[/tpl]  The freeway system is a mix of Interstate, U.S., and State highways which include Interstate 10, Interstate 17, US 60, SR 51, Loop 101, Loop 202, SR 51, SR 143, and SR 30.

The street system in Phoenix (and some of its suburbs) is laid out in a grid system, with most roads oriented either north-south or east-west, and the zero point of the grid being the intersection of Central Avenue and Washington Street.  The original plan was for the east-west streets to be named after presidents, with the north-south streets named after Indians, however the north-south streets were quickly changed to numbers, with avenues running to west of Central, and streets to its east.  Major arterial streets are spaced one mile (1.6 km) apart, divided into smaller blocks approximately every 1/8 of a mile.  For example, Scottsdale Road, being the 7200 block, lies 9 miles to the east of Central Avenue (72 / 8).

===Utilities===

Being located in the desert, Phoenix relies on a water supply delivered to the city via a system of canals which divert water from the regions rivers and lakes, with the largest portion of the city's water coming from the Colorado River through the Central Arizona Project's canal.[tpl]cite web | url=http://water.ezinemark.com/geography-information-phoenix-az-17ffe0fea6c.html | title=Geography Information: Phoenix, AZ | publisher=ezinemark.com | accessdate=February 10, 2014[/tpl]  The city's electrical needs are served primarily by Arizona Public Service, although some customers receive their electricity from the Salt River Project (SRP).  The main sources of electrical generation are nuclear, and coal power plants.  Arizona is home to the Palo Verde Nuclear Power Station, the largest nuclear generating facility in the United States.  SRP is also the largest water provider in Phoenix.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.azenergy.gov/doclib/AZ_Energy_Infrastructure.pdf | title=Arizona's Energy Infrastructure | publisher=azenergy.com | accessdate=February 10, 2014[/tpl]

===Health care===

In 2011 (the last year for which information is available), Phoenix had a slightly younger population than the country as a whole.  While the United States had 13.3% of its population over the age of 65, Phoenix's percentage stood significantly lower, at 8.1%.  Phoenix's percentage of 18.8% in the next age group, 45–64 was also a great deal lower than the national average of 26.6%.  This results in 73% of Phoenix's population being 44 or younger, as compared to national percentage of 60.[tpl]cite book | title=Health Status Report for Cities and Towns in Maricopa County 2009 – 2011 | publisher=Maricopa County Department of Public Health, Office of Epidemiology | date=May 2013 | accessdate=February 13, 2014 | page=86 | url=http://www.maricopa.gov/publichealth/Services/EPI/pdf/hsr/2011-City-HSR.pdf[/tpl]

In most major categories, Phoenix had a lower incidence of death than the rest of the nation. Only deaths due to Alzheimer's (29.7 to 27.2 deaths per 100,000) and pre-natal conditions (5.3 to 3.8 deaths per 100,000) were slightly above the national average.  Deaths due to HIV and liver disease were exactly at the national average of 2.5 and 10.8 respectively.  However, in several major categories, Phoenix had significantly less indices of death: deaths by cancer stood at only 57% (106) of the national average of 184.6 deaths per 100,000; deaths due to heart disease, 56.1% of the national rate of 249.8 per 100,000.[tpl]cite book | title=Health Status Report for Cities and Towns in Maricopa County 2009 – 2011 | publisher=Maricopa County Department of Public Health, Office of Epidemiology | date=May 2013 | accessdate=February 13, 2014 | page=88| url=http://www.maricopa.gov/publichealth/Services/EPI/pdf/hsr/2011-City-HSR.pdf[/tpl]  Cancer and heart disease were the two top causes of death in the country.[tpl]cite journal | journal=National Vital Statistics Reports | volume=61| issue = 4 | date=May 8, 2013 | first1=Sherry L. | last1=Murphy B.S. | first2=Jiaquan | last2=Xu, M.D. | first3=Kenneth D. | last3=Kochanek, M.A. | publisher=CDC, Division of Vital Statistics | page=7 | title=Deaths: Final Data for 2010 | url=http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_04.pdf[/tpl]

==Sister cities==

With the creation of the Phoenix Sister Cities (PSC) organization in 1972, Phoenix became a member of the international Sister City movement. It would take the organization several years to become official, not filing for Articles of Incorporation until 1975, and not entering into their first Sister City agreement until 1976, with Hermosillo, Mexico.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phoenixsistercities.org/|title=Phoenix Sister Cities|publisher=phoenixsistercities.org|accessdate=February 8, 2014[/tpl] The organization's mission statement states their purpose is to "... create people-to-people relationships between the residents of Phoenix and its sister cities through commercial, educational, cultural and artistic exchange programs and events that create and sustain global, long-term, international partnerships and business opportunities for the citizens of Phoenix."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.phoenixsistercities.org/index.php/about-us-65/summary | title=Why a Sister City? | publisher=Phoenix Sister Cities | accessdate=April 17, 2014[/tpl] Currently, Phoenix has ten sister cities, as designated by the Phoenix Sister Cities Commission and Sister Cities International, shown in the table below.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sister-cities.org/interactive-map/Phoenix,%20Arizona|title=Interactive City Directory|publisher=Sister Cities International|accessdate=February 8, 2014[/tpl]  Phoenix and Prague have shared a Capital Cities relationship since May 1991, which was expanded to Sister City Status in 2013.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.phoenixsistercities.org/index.php/sister-city-committees-27/cityinfo | title=Prague, Czech Republic | publisher=Phoenix Sister Cities | accessdate=April 17, 2014[/tpl]
