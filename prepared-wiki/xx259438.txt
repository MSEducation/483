==Life==

Peter Nemenyi was born in Berlin, to which his parents had fled after the rise of fascism in Hungary. His parents separated, and he was brought up in a socialist boarding school operated by the ISK, a German socialist party founded by Leonard Nelson. 
After the rise of Nazism, the party was banned in Germany and its property was seized. The school frequently relocated to different European countries, as Nazi strength grew.  During the Second World War the adults in the party were interned on the Isle of Man and Nemenyi lived in a number of foster homes and youth homes.
After the war, Peter moved to the United States to live with his father in Hanford, Washington.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.crmvet.org/mem/nemenyi.htm|title=Sheila Michaels: Peter Nemenyi (1927--2002)|year=2002|accessdate=December 31, 2010[/tpl]Peter Nemenyi Papers 1952-1979, Wisconsin Historical Society Archives
