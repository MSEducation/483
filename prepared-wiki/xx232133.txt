[[Civil enforcement officer]]

CATEGORIES: Law enforcement occupations in the United Kingdom

A civil enforcement officer (CEO or colloquially traffic warden) is a person employed to enforce parking,  traffic and other restrictions and laws in England & Wales. In England, they are employed by county councils, London Borough Councils, metropolitan district councils or Transport for London, and in Wales by county (borough) councils - or private companies contracted by any of the above. Until the passage of the Traffic Management Act 2004, on-street parking and traffic movement violations were enforced by non-warranted police traffic wardens employed by constabularies. Off-street parking violations were enforced by parking attendants employed by local authorities and private companies.
