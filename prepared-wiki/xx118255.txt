A street piano is a piano placed in the street which passersby are encouraged to play. The best known example comes from the Play Me, I'm Yours project by artist Luke Jerram. The concept originated quite by accident in Sheffield, England.

==The Street Piano in Sheffield==

In Sheffield, The Street Piano was a piano on the pavement on Sharrow Vale Road. It was originally left outside temporarily because the owner could not get it up the steps into his new house. As a social experiment the owner and a friend then attached a sign inviting passersby to play the piano for free. This offer was taken up by a great many people and the piano became a part of the local community. It survived for over a year, including being stolen and subsequently replaced by a newer model (with several volunteers willing to provide a new one). [tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
The original street piano in Sheffield belonged to a family from Middlesbrough for decades before moving, with the daughter of the family, ending up in Sheffield. The original piano stool and music book holder did not make it on to Sharrow Vale Rd, parting company after many happy years together. 
The piano became the centre of a local campaign once the council decided it constituted an abandoned item, and the campaign to save it spread quickly to local news outlets, with several articles on Indymedia. As of July 2006 a spokesman said in an interview for the National BBC Radio 4 that the piano was no longer under threat of removal. However, it was eventually removed in 2008 because of weather damage.

==Play Me, I'm Yours==

Artist Luke Jerram installs street pianos in various cities. The project is intended to challenge the prohibition of playing music in public places without special arrangement. It prompts members of the public to use the piano, regardless of skill and popularity. Typically, a musician would have been stopped from playing outside the City of London and Sing London festival.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]. When the project gets to Boston in 2013, over 1000 pianos will have been installed in 38 cities.

===Birmingham===

In 2007, Jerram installed 15 street pianos throughout Birmingham, United Kingdom, for the public to play. In just three weeks, 140,000 people across the city played, listened and connected with one another.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]
Jerram said "Questioning the rules and ownership of public space 'Play Me I'm yours' is a provocation, inviting the public to engage with, activate and take ownership of their urban environment."

===São Paulo===

Thirteen pianos have been installed in São Paulo. Luke Jerram reported that many of those who stopped at the pianos had never played a real piano or even seen one.[tpl]cite news |first=Bill |last=Nash |title= Keys to the cities: Artist's piano project widens worldwide |work= Ventura County Star |date= 28 June 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2009 |url=http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2009/jun/28/keys-to-the-cities-artists-piano-project-widens/ [/tpl]

==The Public Piano Project in Joshua Tree California==

The Public Piano Project  in Joshua Tree California began as a public grand piano Valentine Gift to the community in 1995 as the Self Serve Serenade by artist Piano Bob (aka Bob Fenger).  In 2002 Piano Bob began a donated piano consolidation project building a weather proof outdoor piano from the parts of 3 pianos and installed  April 2004 in front of Joshua Tree Health Foods.  It was enjoyed by thousands of Joshua Tree National Park Visitors and locals for nearly 2 years and was reinstalled 20 April 2012 at the Coyote Corner Gift Shop in Joshua Tree as the  first Public Prepared Piano.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.publicpreparedpiano.com/  |title=First Public Prepared Piano |publisher=Public Prepared Piano.com |date= |accessdate=20 April 2012[/tpl]  The piano is reminiscent of a Gamelan Orchestra prepared with everyday items such as coins, screws, paper mutes, wedged into the strings in a typical John Cage manner(inventor of the prepared piano in the 1940s also see Bob Fenger's Acoustisizer at Prepared piano 2.10).  The Public Prepared Piano is the third phase of the Public Piano Project dedication to unknown closet pianists, art in public places, and instant drum circle fun around a keyboard. Through regular tuning and maintenance of the public pianos another opportunity presented itself for the public to observe, learn and interact with the total Public Piano Project experience.  Questions like:how long does it stay in tune outside? The short answer: the colder the better the more in tune.  The fact that Joshua Tree is in the High Desert above Palm Springs with many 100 degree plus days in the summer gave numerous opportunities for tuning, sharing and exchanging ideas.  The artist's stated intention:[tpl]cite web|url=http://pianobob.com/whyapublicpiano2.html |title=WHY A PUBLIC PIANO |publisher=Piano Bob.com |date= |accessdate=29 February 2012[/tpl] 'The Public Piano Project  creates momentary beauty thoughts and ideas that resonate out across fields, parking lots and sidewalks.  It invites others to play along and gives way to song and laughter, accidental bonding and new friends; even possibly an ephemeral center of insight and change'. On 21 December 2012 Piano Bob launched his fourth phase of the Public Piano Project with the Prepared and Unprepared dueling pianos for peace at the Joshua Tree Hospice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hwy62art.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=446:dueling-pianos-for-peace-with-piano-bob-dec-21&catid=1:news&Itemid=8 |title=Morongo Basin Cultural Arts Council |publisher=hwy62art.com | date=21 December 2012[/tpl]  Public Piano Locations[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.publicpiano.com/pplocations.html |title=Public Piano Locations |publisher=Public Piano.com |date= |accessdate=29 February 2012[/tpl] Public Piano Tour Pictures 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.playmeforward.com/tourpics.html  |title=Public Piano Tour Pictures |publisher=Play Me Forward.com |date= |accessdate=20 April 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news |first=Mark |last=Wheeler |title= Piano Bob adorns Joshua Tree with public instruments|work= High Desert Star |date= 3 March 2007 |accessdate=3 March 2007 |url=http://www.hidesertstar.com/news/article_d8708eb4-3649-5616-9467-29671a882503.html/ [/tpl]Biggerstaff,Jutta (17 November 2007) "Look out for that piano on the highway" http://www.hidesertstar.com/news/article_bd618dd6-c577-5f77-b681-d1bb4dba194d.html Joshua Tree CA, Retrieved 17 November 2007[tpl]cite web|last=Unger|first= Rebecca |date=26 July 2010 |title=Pianos for peace persist |url=http://www.hidesertstar.com/news/community_news/article_af58ba62-4069-5a45-8882-624001c9b272.html|publisher=Joshua Tree |location=CA|accessdate=26 July 2010[/tpl]

==Piano des villes, piano des champs in Montreal==

In 2012, the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough in Montreal installed two public pianos; Patrick Watson inaugurated the season by being the first to play on one of them while artist and compositor Victor Simon played on the second. "Patrick Watson inaugure Piano des villes, piano des champs" http://journalmetro.com/actualites/montreal/146774/patrick-watson-inaugure-piano-des-villes-piano-des-champs/, Montreal, Retrieved 28 June 2013  In 2013, following the success of the first season, the borough installed two more pianos and lent one to the Pointe-à-Callière Museum for a total of five public pianos, inaugurated by five different artists, Socalled, Yann Perreau, Louise-Andrée Baril, Alex Nevsky, Fanny Bloom and François Bourassa. "Piano des villes, piano des champs.
