The 24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom) was still stationed in Kenya until 1964, and the command maintained a common intelligence system linking Tanganyika, Uganda, and Kenya until 1964 at least.
Timothy Parsons writes: '..military authorities in Kenya took 1964 mutinies in Taganyika and Uganda very seriously and quickly developed plans to deal with a similar incident in their country. .. As a result General Ian Freeland had considerably more resources at his disposal to prevent and contain potential problems in the Kenyan soldiery. Once Lieutenant Colonel Mans gave East Africa Command a careful account of how trouble had broken out in the Tanganyika Rifles, Freeland ordered the Kenyan Special Branch to step up its surveillance of key army units.'Timothy Parsons, 'The 1964 Army Mutinies and the Making of Modern East Africa, 2003, 118. This did not prevent trouble breaking out on 24 January 1964 in the lines of 11th Kenya Rifles at Lanet Barracks near Nakuru. However, the problem was quickly contained, courts-martial ordered, and the unit was eventually disbanded.
East Africa Command was disbanded in 1964 being replaced by British Land Forces Kenya.[tpl]LondonGazette|issue=43598|supp=yes|startpage=2619|date=12 March 1965|accessdate=2008-08-26[/tpl]
