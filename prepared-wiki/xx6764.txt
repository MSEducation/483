La Jetée ([tpl]IPA-fr|la ʒəte, ʒte[/tpl], "The Jetty") is a 1962 French science fiction featurette by Chris Marker. Constructed almost entirely from still photos, it tells the story of a post-nuclear war experiment in time travel. It's 28 mins long, black and white. It won the Prix Jean Vigo for short film.
The 1995 science fiction film 12 Monkeys was inspired by, and borrows several concepts directly from, La Jetée.

==Plot==

A man (Davos Hanich) is a prisoner in the aftermath of the Third World War, in a destroyed, post-apocalyptic Paris where survivors live underground in the Palais de Chaillot galleries. Scientists research time travel, hoping to send test subjects to different time periods "to call past and future to the rescue of the present". They have difficulty finding subjects who can mentally withstand the shock of time travel. The scientists eventually settle upon the prisoner; his key to the past is a vague but obsessive memory, from his pre-war childhood, of a woman (Hélène Chatelain) he had seen on the observation platform ('the jetty') at Orly Airport shortly before witnessing a startling incident there.  He had not understood exactly what happened, but knew he had seen a man die.
After several attempts, he reaches the pre-war period. He meets the woman from his memory, and they develop a romantic relationship. After his successful passages to the past, the experimenters attempt to send him into the far future. In a brief meeting with the technologically advanced people of the future, he is given a power unit sufficient to regenerate his own destroyed society.
Upon his return, with his mission accomplished, he discerns that he is to be executed by his jailers. He is contacted by the people of the future, who offer to help him escape to their time permanently, but he asks instead to be returned to the pre-war time of his childhood, hoping to find the woman again. He is returned and does find her, on the jetty at the airport. However, as he rushes to her, he notices an agent of his jailers who has followed him and realizes the agent is about to kill him. In his final moments, he comes to understand that the incident which he witnessed as a child, which has haunted him for his entire life, was his own death.

==Production==

La Jetée is constructed almost entirely from optically printed photographs playing out as a photomontage of varying rhythm. It contains only one brief shot (of the woman mentioned above sleeping and suddenly waking up) originating on a motion-picture camera, this due to the fact that Marker could only afford to hire one for an afternoon. The stills were taken with a Pentax SpotmaticInterview with Antoine Bonfanti, 2004 and the motion-picture segment was shot with a 35mm Arriflex.La Jetée[tpl]Dead link|June 2011|date=June 2011[/tpl] revue & dvd et site internet.

The story is told by a voice-over narrator. The scene in which the hero and the woman look at a cut-away trunk of a tree is a reference to Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo which Marker also references in his 1983 film Sans soleil."On Vertigo", special feature on the Criterion Collection DVD of La Jetée and Sans soleil. The same scene also appears in Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys.

Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys (1995) was inspired by and takes several concepts directly from La Jetée (acknowledging this debt in the opening credits).

Time. 26 October 2010 Kode9 (music, script), in collaboration with Ms. Haptic (narration, script), Marcel Weber (aka MFO) (images, script) and Lucy Benson (images, script) created an homage to La Jetée in 2011, for the Unsound Festival.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://lucybenson.net/portfolio/her-ghost-kode9mfo-unsound-festival-2011/ |title=‘Her Ghost’ kode9, MFO, Ms Haptic, Lucy Benson |publisher=lucy benson |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13[/tpl] The plot of the homage centers around the woman instead of the man and is a 'reimagining' rather than a 'remix' in that it features a completely new, original script that further develops the narrative whilst remaining true to the original plot. Both stories function in harmony with one another. The images and music of "Her Ghost" are almost exclusively sourced from the original film, however they are significantly reworked so as to create an original piece. A live performance of "Her Ghost" was part of the Chris Marker retrospective at Centre Pompidou in Paris 2013.
In 2012, in correspondence with the Sight & Sound Poll, the British Film Institute deemed ″La Jetée″ as the 50th greatest film of all time.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time | title= The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time | date= 1 August 2012| work= Sight & Sound September 2012 issue| publisher= British Film Institute| accessdate=2012-12-19[/tpl]
