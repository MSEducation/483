==History==

Menri Monastery was established in 1405 by Nyammey Sherab Gyeltsen (mnyam med shes rab rgyal mtshan, 1356–1416) from Gyarong (Gyelrong), on the slope of Mt Shari Phowa (shar ri pho ba) in Tobgyel (thob rgyal), Tsang. Nyammey Sherab Gyeltsen had been the eighteenth abbot of an old monastery also called Menri. The first Menri founded in 1072 as Yayru Ensaka Monastery (or Yeru Wensaka, Wylie: g.Yas-ru dBen-sa-kha dGon-pa), was destroyed by a flood in 1386.[tpl]cite book|author1=Gray Tuttle|author2=Kurtis R.

Rinchen Gyeltsen became the second abbot. The monastery had 32 abbots between its founding and 1966. The administration of the monastery is the subject of an article by Per Kvaerne.[tpl]cite book|author1=Gray Tuttle|author2=Kurtis R.

Sanggye Tendzin (1912-1978) served as lobpon (slob dpon), or master scholar at Menri, and "was also in charge of printing important works of Dzogchen."
 
 Menri Monastery had four colleges: Lingmey (gLing-smad), Lingto (gLing-stod), Lingkey (gLing-ske) and Lingzur (gLing-zur). The colleges had twelve divisions and all together, in 1959, between 400 and 500 monks. Menri had 250 branch monasteries, in all areas of Tibet except U, as well as in India, China, Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal, and Mongolia.
  
In 1947, Menri itself established a debating college. Although Ensaka had the debate tradition study of sutra, tantra, and dzogchen, Menri was only able to institute it for sutra. The monastery carried out a full calendar of tantric rituals and practice.

The administration of the monastery is the subject of an article by Per Kvaerne.
Menri was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.

==Menri Monastery, Dolanji, Himachal Pradesh, India==

In 1967, Menri was re-founded at Dolanji in Himachal Pradesh, India by Lungtok Tenpai Nyima and Lopon Tenzin Namdak. This monastery has recreated the geshe training program, and is home to over two hundred monks. Menri in India and Triten Norbutse Monastery in Nepal now host the only two geshe programs in the Bon lineage.
