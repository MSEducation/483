==Way of Living==

Betong is a small town in Yala province. It is at the southern most of Thailand. Generally, most Betong people are Muslims, but there are also many Buddhists and Chinese. In every morning, the weather is usually foggy. Around 6:00 am to 7:00 am is quite a busy hour (not much like in Bangkok or other big cities) because the people are preparing for giving alms to the Buddhist monks, taking the children to school, and going to the market. After that period is the official time (around 8:00 am to 4:00 pm) the town is still busy but less than before. Most Betong people are merchants, and most of their profit is from Malaysian tourists. Around 4:00 pm to 5:00 pm is a rush hour again because the official time is over. People go back to their home, some go to the gym. Since around 7:30 pm, the town becomes more silent because the shops are closing. However, there are also karaoke, pubs and bars opened until the middle of the night.
