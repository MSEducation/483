Corinne Mae Griffith (November 21, 1894 – July 13, 1979) was an American film actress, producer and author. Dubbed "The Orchid Lady of the Screen",[tpl]cite book|last=Porter|first=Darwin |title=Howard Hughes: Hell's Angel|publisher=Blood Moon Productions, Ltd.|year=2005|pages=301|isbn=0-9748118-1-5[/tpl] she was one of the most popular film actresses of the 1920s and widely considered the most beautiful actress of the silent screen. Shortly after the advent of sound film, Griffith retired from acting and became a successful author.

==Early life and career==

Griffith was born in Texarkana, Texas to John Lewis Griffin and Ambolina (Ambolyn) Ghio. She attended Sacred Heart Convent school in New Orleans and worked as a dancer before she began her acting career.[tpl]cite book|title=Who's Who in America|publisher=Marquis-Who's Who.|year=1954|pages=1427[/tpl]
Griffith began her screen career at the Vitagraph Studios in 1916. She later moved to First National, where she became one of their most popular stars.[tpl]cite book|last=Lowe|first=Denise |title=An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Women in Early American Films, 1895–1930: 1895–1930|publisher=Haworth Press|year=2004|pages=258|isbn=0-7890-1843-8[/tpl] In 1928, she had the starring role in The Garden of Eden. The next year, in 1929, Griffith received an Academy Award nomination for her role in The Divine Lady.
Griffith's first sound film, Lilies of the Field, was released in 1930. Griffith's voice did not record well (The New York Times stated that she "talked through her nose"), and the film was a box office flop.[tpl]cite book|last=Barrios|first=Richard |title=A Song in the Dark: The Birth of the Musical Film|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=1995|pages=317|isbn=0-19-508811-5[/tpl] After appearing in one more Hollywood picture, Back Pay in 1930 and a British film Lily Christine in 1932, she retired from acting. She returned to the screen in 1962 in the low-budget melodrama Paradise Alley, which received scant release.

==Later career==

Griffith was one of the few film stars to move successfully into new careers once her stardom had ended. She was an accomplished writer who published eleven books including two best sellers, My Life with the Redskins and the memoir Papa's Delicate Condition, which was made into a 1963 film starring Jackie Gleason about the Ghio and Griffin family. Her actual family names were used in the film.
Her ventures into real estate were particularly successful (at one point she owned four different major office buildings in Los Angeles, each of them named after her).

==Personal life==

Griffith was a member of the Christian Science religion.[tpl]cite book|last=Slide|first=Anthony |title=Silent Players: A Biographical and Autobiographical Study of 100 Silent Film Actors and Actresses|year=2002|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-2249-X|page=169[/tpl]

===Marriages===

Griffith was married four times and produced no children. She married actor and frequent co-star Webster Campbell from 1920 to 1923, producer Walter Morosco from 1924 to 1934, and the owner of the Washington Redskins football team George Preston Marshall from 1936 to 1958. During her marriage to Marshall, she composed the lyrics to the Redskins fight song "Hail to the Redskins" which became one of the most famous football anthems.[tpl]cite book|last=Richman|first=Michael |title=The Redskins Encyclopedia|year=2007|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=1-59213-542-0|page=15[/tpl]
In 1966, within a few days, she married and divorced her fourth husband, Broadway actor Danny Scholl (Call Me Mister). Scholl was 45, more than 25 years Griffith's junior. In court she testified that she was not Corinne Griffith. She claimed that she was the actress's younger (by twenty years) sister who had taken her place upon the famous sister's death. Contradicting testimony by actresses Betty Blythe and Claire Windsor, who had both known her since the 1920s, did not shake her story. In 1974, Adele Whitely Fletcher, editor of Photoplay, said Griffith was still claiming that she was her own younger sister.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]

==Death==

On July 13, 1979, Griffith died of heart failure in Santa Monica, California, aged 84. At the time of her death, her personal estate was worth over $150,000,000.[tpl]Fact|date=January 2014[/tpl]
For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Corinne Griffith has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1560 Vine Street.
