CATEGORIES: United States presidential campaigns, 2000, Ralph Nader, Green Party of the United States

Ralph Nader ran in the 2000 United States presidential election as the nominee of the Green Party. He was also nominated by the Vermont Progressive Party(2000-08-01) "Vermont Progressives Nominate Nader", Ballot Access News. and the United Citizens Party of South Carolina.(2000-08-01) United Citizens Party Picks Nader, Ballot Access News. The campaign marked Nader's second presidential bid as the Green nominee, and his third overall, having run as a write-in campaign in 1992 and a passive campaign on the Green ballot line in 1996.
Nader's vice presidential running mate was Winona LaDuke, an environmental activist and member of the Ojibwe tribe of Minnesota.
Nader appeared on the ballot in 43 states and DC, up from 22 in 1996. He won 2,882,995 votes, or 2.74 percent of the popular vote. His campaign did not attain the 5 percent required to qualify the Green Party for federally distributed public funding in the next election. The percentage did, however, enable the Green Party to achieve ballot status in many new states, such as Delaware and Maryland.Levine, Harry G. (May 2004).
Some people claim that Nader acted as a third-party spoiler in the 2000 U.S. presidential election, while others, including Nader, dispute this claim.[tpl]cite news|last=Greenhouse |first=Steven|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E5DD133DF93BA15754C0A9629C8B63|title=The Constituencies: Liberals; From Chicago '68 to Boston, The Left Comes Full Circle|publisher=New York Times |date=2004-07-28|accessdate=2010-05-24[/tpl]Convictions Intact, Nader Soldiers On â€“ New York Times[tpl]dead link|date=May 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB121218925042534249.html|work=Wall Street Journal |title=Interview: Ralph Nader |first=Tunku | last=Varadarajan |date=2008-05-31[/tpl]
