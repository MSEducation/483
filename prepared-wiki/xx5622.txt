[[Klondike, Yukon]]

CATEGORIES: Geography of Yukon, Klondike Gold Rush, Geographic regions of Canada

The Klondike is a region of Yukon in northwest Canada, east of the Alaska border. It lies around the Klondike River, a small river that enters Yukon from the east at Dawson. 
The Klondike is famed because of the Klondike Gold Rush, which started in 1897 and lasted until 1899. Gold has been mined continuously in that area except for a hiatus in the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
The name "Klondike" evolved from the Hän word Tr'ondëk, which means "hammerstone water". Early gold seekers found it difficult to pronounce the First Nations word, so "Klondike" was the result of this poor pronunciation.

==Climate==

The climate is exceedingly severe — very hot and dry in the short summer, and extremely cold during the long winter.[tpl]Cite NIE|Klondike|year=1905[/tpl] For seven months of the year, intense cold prevails, varied by furious snow storms which begin in September and occur at intervals until May. By October 20, ice is formed over all the rivers. The ground for the better part of the year is frozen to the depth of 3 to 10 feet.[tpl]Cite Collier's|Klondike, The[/tpl]
