===Political career===

====2001 General Election====

Gomez joined the Workers' Party in 2001. He was a member of the Workers' Party team which attempted to contest the Aljunied Group Representation Constituency at the 2001 general election, but were disqualified because their nomination papers were incomplete. The name of the Group Representation Constituency (GRC) they were intending to contest had not been written down on the form.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.wp.org.sg/party/history/2001_ahead.htm | title = 2001 to Present | publisher = Workers' Party of Singapore[/tpl]

====2006 General Election====

Gomez came to national attention in Singapore during the 2006 general election campaign following an incident in which he accused the Elections Department of losing his minority-race candidate's application form, but was later forced to apologise when closed-circuit television evidence showed that he had placed the form in his briefcase. He stood as a member of the Workers' Party's team in the Aljunied Group Representation Constituency at the election, ultimately losing to the team of the governing People's Action Party (PAP) in the constituency by 43.9% of the votes to 56.1%.

=====Run-up to the election=====

The "James Gomez Saga" attracted considerable media attention during the 2006 general election. It began after Gomez claimed that he had submitted his minority-race candidate's application form during a visit to the Elections Department with Workers' Party Chairman Sylvia Lim on 24 April. (As teams of candidates in GRCs must include a minority-race candidate, a candidate from each party's team in a GRC must make such an application before the election.) Two days later, Gomez called in at the Elections Department to enquire about the status of the form. He was indignant when he was told that they had not received his form, and he told an officer from the department that there would be "consequences" if it had been misplaced. The following day, the Elections Department confirmed that their CCTV footage had revealed that Gomez had in fact put the form in his bag and left the building without submitting it.[tpl]cite news | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/205255/1/.html | title = Elections Dept confirms WP's James Gomez did not submit minority form | date = 27 April 2006[/tpl]
On 29 April 29, Gomez admitted that he had not filed his application, contrary to his earlier claims. He explained that he had been distracted by his busy schedule. (His failure to submit the form did not prevent the Workers' Party team from running in Aljunied GRC because they had a second minority candidate on their team, Mohammed Rahizan bin Yaacob, who had submitted the required paperwork.)
PAP candidate Inderjit Singh speculated that Gomez's non-submission of the form may have been an intentional ploy to try and gain publicity and cause confusion.[tpl]cite news | author = S. Ramesh | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 2 May 2006 | title = WP's Gomez said missing form was a "show": Inderjit Singh | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/206082/1/.html[/tpl] Gomez responded by insisting that he had made a genuine mistake and called for others to "move on" from the issue. On the eve of polling day, the Workers' Party leader, Low Thia Khiang, backed Gomez and stated that "the incident was merely an unintentional omission, a mistake made while busy". However Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng said that the facts showed that Gomez had lied.[tpl]cite news | publisher = The Straits Times | url = http://www.asiaone.com/specials/ge2006/news/20060503_story2_1.html | title = Gomez lied, facts show that clearly: Kan Seng | format = opinion[/tpl][tpl]cite news | author = Valerie Tan | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 6 May 2006 | title = DPM Wong surprised by WP's Low's latest comments on Gomez | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/206798/1/.html[/tpl]

=====Election results=====

On polling day, Gomez and his Workers' Party colleagues in Aljunied GRC lost to the PAP's team by 56,593 votes (43.9%) to 74,843 (56.1%). This was the highest percentage of the vote garnered by any opposition losing candidates, and was therefore enough to secure one of the team's members (Party Chairman Sylvia Lim) a seat as a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP).

=====After polling day=====

Immediately after the election, the Elections Department filed a complaint about Gomez threatening a member of their staff by saying there would be "consequences" if his form has been lost.
On 8 May, two days after the election, Gomez was stopped by police at Changi Airport and prevented from boarding a flight to Stockholm (where he worked at the time for the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance). He was held for questioning over whether he had committed criminal intimidation in his dealings with the Elections Department. Gomez and other members of the Workers' Party, including Low Thia Kiang and Sylvia Lim, were questioned regarding the issue.[tpl]cite news | author = Lee Ching Wern | publisher = Today | date = 8 May 2006 | title = James Gomez under police investigation | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/207142/1/.html | format = reprint[/tpl] On 9 May, Gomez was questioned for a second time for five hours,[tpl]cite news | author = Asha Popatlal | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 9 May 2006 | title = James Gomez questioned by police for second time | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/207405/1/.html[/tpl] and for a third time on 10 May for three hours.[tpl]cite web | title = Gomez to be questioned today for 3rd time | publisher = James Gomez @ WP | url = http://jamesgomeznews.blogspot.com/2006/05/gomez-to-be-questioned-today-for-3rd.html | date = 10 May 2006[/tpl] Meanwhile, Low assured police that there would be full co-operation with the police on the matter.[tpl]cite news | author = S.

In the end, Gomez was let off with a "stern warning" regarding the incident. The police maintained that there had been "several serious inconsistencies" in the account of events that Gomez had given. However the public prosecutor stated that the willingness of Gomez to co-operate with the police and his lack of a previous criminal record led to the decision.[tpl]cite news | author = Valerie Tan | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 12 May 2006 | title = WP's Gomez let off with stern warning in run-in with Elections Dept | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/207972/1/.html[/tpl]Gomez Let off with a Stern Warning, The Straits Times, 13 May 2006 Following this, former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said that the decision not to prosecute did not make Gomez any less dishonest and called him a "bad egg".[tpl]cite news | title =  MM Lee says Gomez is a liar, a bad egg in Workers' Party | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 2 May 2006 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/206150/1/.html [/tpl]
