[[Berry's Green]]

CATEGORIES: Areas of London, Districts of Bromley

Berry's Green is a small area in the London Borough of Bromley in London, UK. It is a fairly wooded rural area with a scattering of farmland.  Housing consists mainly of detached properties, mostly bungalows, with a row of local authority cottages and a static mobile home site. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, there was a sub-post office on the corner of Single Street and Jail Lane which sold basic provisions, such as bread, milk, sweets, and crisps. Mains sewerage was installed in around 1973.
On the junction of Jail Lane, Berry's Hill, and Berry's Green Road is a small wood with large World War II bomb crater. This may have been caused by a V-2 rocket as it is almost the same distance from Germany as the last known V-2, which was dropped in Kynaston Rd, Orpington. A lot of the V-2s fell short of London towards the end of the war. There are also a number of smaller bomb craters scattered around the surrounding woodlands, due to its proximity to Biggin Hill airfield. Berry's Green is home to the Cherry Lodge Golf Course.
