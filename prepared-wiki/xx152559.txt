The Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis, which is also known as the Stockholm Papyrus, dates from c. 300 AD and contains craft recipes written in Demotic Greek.  The Stockholm papyrus has 154 recipes for dying, coloring gemstones, cleaning (purifying) pearls, and imitation gold and silver.Caley, E. R.

Certain may derive from the Pseudo-Demikristo), and Zosimos of Panopolis, a Greek Alchemist of c. 100 AD,  gives similar recipes. Translations of certain of these recipes are found in mediaeval Latin collections of technological recipes, notably the Mappae clavicula.
The Leyden papyrus X derives from the same (or very similar) sources, and is written in a similar (possibly the same) hand.
