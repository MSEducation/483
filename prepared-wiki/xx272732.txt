[[Workplace communication]]

CATEGORIES: Communication theory

Workplace communication is the process of exchanging information, both verbal and non-verbal, within an organization. An organization may consist of employees from different parts of the society. In order to unite the activities of all employees, communication is crucial. Communicating necessary information to the entire workforce becomes necessary. Effective workplace communication ensures that all the organizational objectives are achieved.
The following are the factors influencing workplace communication:
Different people absorb information in different ways. To make sure that the information conveyed is understood by all, the method used for communication needs to be simple and clear. When presenting vital information, using pictures will make way for easy understanding. Preferring two-way communication is considered best for communicating. Adequate importance can be given for discussion, questions and clarifications.[tpl]cite book|last=Eunson|first=Baden|title=Communication in the workplace|year=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=Milton, Qld|isbn=0-7314-0650-8[/tpl]
The content of the information plays a major role in workplace communication. The level of detail must be according to the grasping capacity of the audience. Giving too much detail may get the audience bored and too little detail won’t make them involved. Use of jargon while communicating is not considered good for effective workplace communication.[tpl]cite book|last=Ludden|first=Marsha|title=Effective workplace communication : skills for success in life and on the job|year=2007|publisher=JIST Works|location=Indianapolis, Ind.|isbn=1-59357-433-9|edition=3rd ed.[/tpl]
While formal workplace communication that is done too rarely or too often is not good for an organization, frequent informal workplace communication has its benefits.[tpl]cite journal|last=Whittaker|first=Steve|coauthors=David Frohlich and Owen Daly-Jones|title=Informal workplace communication: what is it like and how might we support it?|journal=CHI '94 Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems: celebrating interdependence|date=April 24–28, 1994|year=1994|pages=131–137|accessdate=14 November 2011[/tpl]  A perfect balance is required for the proper functioning of an organization. Information must be communicated as and when required rather than holding unnecessary meetings frequently. At the same time crucial information must not be held till the last hour or day, instead they have to be communicated as early as possible to get the employees in tune with the objectives of the organization.[tpl]cite book|last=Picardi|first=Richard P.|title=Skills of workplace communication : a handbook for T & D specialists and their organizations|year=2001|publisher=Quorum Books|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-1-56720-362-2|edition=Online-Ausg.[/tpl]
Getting the message across efficiently depends on the skills of the communicator such as presentation skills, group facilitation skills and written communication skills. Successful communication also depends upon the capacity of the employees to understand the information. This requires providing the employees some basic financial literacy like financial statements, sales, profitability, etc.[tpl]cite book|last=Gerson|first=Sharon J.
