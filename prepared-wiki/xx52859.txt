Lawrence Eugene Doby (December 13, 1923 – June 18, 2003) was an American professional baseball player in the Negro leagues and Major League Baseball (MLB) who was the second black player to make his debut in MLB. A native of Camden, South Carolina and three-sport all-state athlete while in high school in Paterson, New Jersey, Doby accepted a basketball scholarship from Long Island University. At 17 years of age, he became the Newark Eagles' second basemen. Doby joined the United States Navy during World War II. His military service complete, Doby returned to baseball in 1946, and along with teammate Monte Irvin, helped the Eagles win the Negro League World Series.
In July 1947, Doby joined Jackie Robinson in breaking the MLB color barrier as he became the first black player to integrate the American League (AL) when he signed a contract to play with Bill Veeck's Cleveland Indians. Doby was the first player to go directly to the majors from the Negro leagues. A seven-time All-Star center fielder, Doby and teammate Satchel Paige were the first African-American players to win a World Series championship when the Indians won in 1948. He helped the Indians win a franchise-record 111 games and the AL pennant in 1954, finishing second in the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) award voting as the season's RBI leader and home run champion for the second time in three seasons. He went on to play for the Chicago White Sox, Detroit Tigers, and Chunichi Dragons before his retirement as a player.
Doby later served as the second black manager in the majors with the Chicago White Sox, and was a director with the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and in 1995 was appointed to a position in the AL's executive office. He was selected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in [tpl]By|1998[/tpl] by the Hall's Veterans Committee and died in 2003 at the age of 79.

==Early life==

Doby was born in Camden, South Carolina to David Doby and Etta Brooks.[tpl]cite book|last=Moore|first=Joseph Thomas|title=Pride and Prejudice: The Biography of Larry Doby|location=New York, NY|publisher=Praeger Publishers|year=1988|isbn=0-275-92984-1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LjfGgiauBfcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl][tpl]rp|p.7[/tpl] Doby's father served in World War I, worked as a horse groomer and played semi-pro baseball.

He first moved in with his grandmother but eventually lived with his father's sister and brother-in-law from 1934 to 1938.[tpl]rp|p.10[/tpl] Doby attended Jackson School, which was segregated under South Carolina state law. The first opportunity he had to play organized baseball came as a student at Browning Home-Mather Academy, a private school affiliated with the Methodist church. Richard Dubose, known locally in African-American circles for his baseball expertise and who had also managed Doby's father, gave Doby some of his first baseball lessons.[tpl]rp|p.59[/tpl] Reflecting on his years growing up in South Carolina, including how he and playmates used worn down broom handles for bats, Doby said, "Growing up in Camden, we didn't have baseball bats. We'd use a tree here, a tin can there, for bases."[tpl]cite news|newspaper=The News and Courier|location=Charleston, SC|date=7 July 1978|accessdate=25 August 2012|last=Laise|first=Jim|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=knNJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NQsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2636,1501560&dq=larry+doby+japan&hl=en|title=Larry Doby Meets Reporters After Being Named Manager|page=3C[/tpl]
After Doby had completed eighth grade, he moved north to Paterson at the age of 14 to be reunited with his mother, although he lived full-time with a friend of his mother's and visit his mother once per week.[tpl]rp|p.11[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The Negro Leagues in New Jersey: A History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FV0uF_RwC00C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|first1=Alfred M.|last1=Martin|first2=Alfred T.|last2=Martin|isbn=978-0-7864-3900-3|year=2008|publisher=McFarland & Company|location=Jeffeson, NC[/tpl][tpl]rp|p.30[/tpl] Doby lettered in track and also played, football as a wide receiver, baseball, and basketball while at Paterson Eastside High School. Eastside won a state championship in football and the team was subsequently invited to participate in a game in Florida. After the promoters of the game informed the team Doby, the only black player on the team, would not be allowed to participate, the team voted to forgo the trip as a gesture of support for Doby.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=l6zL-Nw-sbUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Carrying Jackie's Torch: The Players Who Integrated Baseball—and America|last=Jacobson|first=Steve|isbn=978-1-55652-639-8|year=2007|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|location=Chicago, IL[/tpl][tpl]rp|p.31[/tpl]
During summer vacation Doby played baseball with a black semi-pro team, the Smart Sets, where he played with shortstop teammate and future Hall of Famer Monte Irvin.[tpl]rp|p.15[/tpl] He also had a brief stint with the Harlem Renaissance, a professional basketball team, as an unpaid substitute player.[tpl]rp|p.30[/tpl] Upon completion of high school, he was offered an athletic scholarship to play basketball from head coach Clair Bee and enrolled at Long Island University (LIU).[tpl]rp|p.23[/tpl][tpl]citation |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-108hconres235ih/pdf/BILLS-108hconres235ih.pdf|date=26 June 2003|title=H.Con.Res.235 - Celebrating the life and achievements of Lawrence Eugene "Larry" Doby|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|place=Washington, DC[/tpl] Doby had been dating Eastside classmate Helyn Curvy since his sophomore year and, according to Doby, being able to remain close to Paterson was the "main reason" he selected LIU.[tpl]rp|p.23[/tpl]

==Negro leagues and WWII==

A Negro league umpire, Henry Moore, advised Newark Eagles' owners Abe and Effa Manley to give Doby a tryout at Hinchliffe Stadium in Paterson, which was successful; Doby joined the Eagles in 1942 at the age of 17 for $300.[tpl]rp|p.20[/tpl] The contract stated Doby would play until September when he would start classes at college; to protect his amateur status he signed using the alias "Larry Walker" and local reporters were told he originated from Los Angeles, California.[tpl]rp|p.20[/tpl] On May 31, Doby appeared in his first professional game when the Eagles played against the New York Cubans at Yankee Stadium.[tpl]rp|p.19[/tpl][tpl]rp|p.83[/tpl] Of the games Doby played in, his batting average was .391, determined from 26 box scores have been found.[tpl]rp|p.20[/tpl] Doby recalled a game against catcher Josh Gibson and pitcher Ray Brown of the Homestead Grays:
Doby's career in Newark was interrupted for two years for service in the United States Navy. Doby spent 1943 and part of 1944 at Camp Robert Smalls at the Great Lakes Naval Training School near Chicago.[tpl]cite journal|last=Young|first=A.S.|title=A Black Man in the Wigwam|journal=Ebony|date=February 1969|pages=66–74|accessdate=29 July 2012|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9eEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=larry+doby&source=bl&ots=VYovNgPBVa&sig=-0WWeUE3C5lCIGZZpwR2SN897YM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4AYVUMnaHYaWiQfFxYDICw&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=larry%20doby&f=false|volume=XXIV|issue=4|publisher=Johnson Publishing|location=Chicago, IL[/tpl][tpl]rp|p.68[/tpl] He appeared on an all-black baseball squad and maintained a .342 batting average against squads composed of white players, some of which featured major leaguers.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1120987/4/index.htm|title=Those Who Came After|date=27 June 1983|accessdate=1 August 2012|publisher=Time Warner|work=Si.com|last=Tygiel|first=Jules|location=New York, NY|volume=58|issue=26|pages=40–57[/tpl] He then went to Treasure Island Naval Base in San Francisco Bay, California. Before serving in the Pacific Theater of World War II, Doby spent time at Navy sites in Ogden, Utah and San Diego, California. He was stationed on Ulithi in the Pacific Ocean in 1945. Doby heard of Jackie Robinson's minor league contract deal with the Montreal Royals of the International League from his base on Ulithi listening to Armed Forces Radio, and as a result Doby saw real hope in becoming a professional baseball player.[tpl]rp|p.31[/tpl] While in Hawaii, Doby met fellow Navy man and future teammate Mickey Vernon.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/25/AR2008092504101.html|title=Mickey Vernon; Smooth Fielder, Hot Hitter for Senators|newspaper=The Washington Post|last=Schudel|first=Matt|date=26 September 2008|accessdate=31 July 2012[/tpl] Vernon, then with the Washington Senators, was so impressed with Doby's skills he wrote to Senators owner Clark Griffith, encouraging Griffith to sign Doby should the MLB ever allow integration.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WYfK1zOtoLwC&pg=PA186&lpg=PA186&dq=larry+doby+mickey+vernon&source=bl&ots=ukbzcVj5H8&sig=HdQa78h3E-0mV-CUAfED1KVCoBo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sbwXUJb1G7CSiQf18oHYAQ&ved=0CFgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=larry%20doby%20mickey%20vernon&f=false|title=Satch, Dizzy & Rapid Robert: The Wild Saga of Interracial Baseball Before Integration|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York, NY|year=2012|pages=186–187|last=Gay|first=Timothy M.|isbn=978-1-4165-4798-3[/tpl] During his time in the Navy, Doby was described by his colleagues as quiet.[tpl]rp|p.71[/tpl] Doby was discharged from the Navy in January 1946.[tpl]rp|p.57[/tpl] In the summer of that year, Doby and Helyn Curvy were married.[tpl]rp|p.33[/tpl]

For the Series, Doby hit .372 with one home run, five RBIs, and three stolen bases.[tpl]rp|p.31[/tpl] Many in the Negro leagues believed Doby or Irvin would be first to break the MLB color barrier, not Robinson.[tpl]cite news|url=http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_negro_leagues_profile.jsp?player=doby_larry|title=Living to tell about it|date=|accessdate=12 July 2012|last=Hill|first=Justice B.|work=Mlb.com|publisher=Major League Baseball Advanced Media[/tpl] On considering a career in the MLB, Doby said, "I never dreamed that far ahead. Growing up in a segregated society, you couldn't have thought that that was the way it was going to be. There was no bright spot as far as looking at baseball until Mr. Robinson got the opportunity to play in Montreal in '46."

==Major League Baseball career==

===Integration of American League (1947)===

Cleveland Indians owner and team president Bill Veeck proposed integrating baseball in 1942, which had been informally segregated since the turn of the century, but this was rejected by Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis.[tpl]rp|p.19[/tpl] Veeck had begun the process of finding a young, talented player from the Negro leagues, and told a reporter in Cleveland that he would integrate the Indians' roster if he could find a black player with the necessary talent level who could withstand the taunts and pressure of being the first black athlete in the AL. The reporter suggested Doby, of whom Veeck had seen at the Great Lakes Naval Training School. Doby's name was also mentioned when Veeck talked with reporters who covered the Negro leagues.[tpl]rp|p.4[/tpl] Indians scout Bill Killefer rated Doby favorably and perhaps just as important for Veeck, reported Doby's off-field behaviour was not a concern. The Dodgers rated Doby their top young Negro league prospect.[tpl]rp|p.4[/tpl] But unlike the Brooklyn Dodgers' Branch Rickey, who signed Robinson one full season before bringing him to the National League, Veeck used a different strategy, letting Doby remain with the Eagles instead of bringing him through the Indians' farm system. He told the Pittsburgh Courier, "One afternoon when the team trots out on the field, a Negro player will be out there with it."[tpl]rp|p.4[/tpl]
While Rickey declined to pay for the purchasing rights of Robinson while he played for the Kansas City Monarchs, Veeck was "determined to buy Doby's contract from the Eagles" and had no problem paying purchasing rights.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qoqyGjsXYnwC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=larry+dobby+effa+manley+bill+veeck+contract&source=bl&ots=ghY-NiRDeT&sig=3C0QhGIimHIzWBFUnhZCVytU_rU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lrgfUJKIEefDmQXKq4DwBQ&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=larry%20dobby%20effa%20manley%20bill%20veeck%20contract&f=false|title=Béisbol|editor=Ilan Stavans|series=The Ilan Stavans Library of Latino Civilization|year=2012|isbn=978-0-313-37513-2|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara, CA[/tpl][tpl]rp|p.37[/tpl] Effa Manley, business manager for the Eagles, believed her club's close relationship with the New York Yankees might put Doby in a Yankees uniform, but they did not take interest in him. Veeck finalized a contract deal for Doby with Manley on July 3. Veeck paid her a total of $15,000 for her second baseman—$10,000 for taking him from the Eagles and another $5,000 once it was determined he would stay with the Indians for at least 30 days.[tpl]cite book|title=The Cooperstown Symposium on Baseball and American Culture, 2000|editor=Alvin L.

"I moved slowly and carefully, perhaps even timidly," Veeck said.[tpl]rp|p.4[/tpl] The Eagles had a doubleheader on July 4 but Doby, who had a .415 batting average and 14 home runs to that point in the season, only played in the first as Veeck sent his assistant and public relations personnel member, Louis Jones, for Doby. The two took a train from Newark to Chicago where the Indians were scheduled to play the Chicago White Sox the next day.[tpl]rp|p.4[/tpl]
On July 5, with the Indians in Chicago in the midst of a road trip, Doby made his debut as the second black baseball player after Robinson to play in the majors. Veeck hired two plainclothes police officers to accompany Doby as he went to Comiskey Park.[tpl]cite book|title=Crossing the Line: Black Major Leaguers, 1947–1959|last1=Moffi|first1=Larry|last2=Kronstadt|first2=Jonathan|page=16|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jRHgMttlKDIC&pg=PA9&dq=larry+doby&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7lAWUOqYGMni0QHHs4DwBw&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=larry%20doby&f=false|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln, NE|isbn=0-8032-8316-4[/tpl][tpl]rp|p.16[/tpl] Player-manager Lou Boudreau initially had a hard time finding a place in the lineup for Doby, who had played second base and shortstop for most of his career. Boudreau himself was the regular shortstop, while Joe Gordon was the second baseman.[tpl]cite book|title=Our Tribe: A Baseball Memoir|last=Pluto|first=Terry|authorlink=Terry Pluto|location=New York City|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=1999|isbn=0-684-84505-9[/tpl] That day, Doby met his new teammates for the first time. "I walked down that line, stuck out my hand, and very few hands came back in return. Most of the ones that did were cold-fish handshakes, along with a look that said, 'You don't belong here," Doby reminisced years later.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/sports/ledger/izenbergcol/index.ssf/2012/07/izenberg_larry_doby_should_be.html|title=Larry Doby should be honored by Neward|last=Izenberg|first=Jerry|publisher=NJ.com|work=Newark Star-Ledger|date=7 July 2012|accessdate=12 July 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=1828|title=Ohio History Central - Larry Doby|work=Ohio History Central|accessdate=14 July 2012[/tpl] Four of Doby's teammates did not shake his hand, and of those, two turned their backs to Doby when he tried to introduce himself.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/20/sports/sports-of-the-times-larry-doby-understands-handshakes.html|title=Larry Doby Understands Handshakes|last=Anderson|first=Dave|date=20 April 1995|accessdate=29 July 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company[/tpl] During warm-ups, Doby languished for minutes while his teammates interacted with one another. Not until Joe Gordon asked Doby to play catch with him was Doby given the chance to engage.

In the 1949 movie The Kid from Cleveland, Veeck tells the story that Gordon struck out on three swings in his immediate at-bat after Doby to save face for his new teammate. However, Doby's second strike was the result of a foul ball, both the Associated Press and Chicago Tribune stated Doby struck out on five pitches instead of three, and in addition, Gordon was standing on third base during Doby's at-bat. From Pride and Prejudice: The Biography of Larry Doby:
The Indians had a doubleheader against the White Sox on Sunday, July 6, for which 31,566 were in attendance; it was estimated that approximately 30 percent of the crowd were black. Some congregations of black churches let out early while others walked immediately from Sunday service to Comiskey Park.[tpl]rp|p.53[/tpl] Boudreau had Doby pinch-hit in the first game but for the second, listed him a starter at first base, a position Doby was not expected to fill when the Indians brought him up to play at second base. Doby had played the position before with the Eagles but was without a proper glove for first base and met much resistance when attempts were made to borrow one from teammates, including first baseman Eddie Robinson, for whom Boudreau had asked Doby to replace that day.[tpl]rp|p.32[/tpl] Doby said only because Gordon asked in the clubhouse to borrow one of the first baseman's glove did he have one to use in the second game of the doubleheader as earlier direct requests from Doby were rejected. The glove was loaned by a White Sox player.[tpl]rp|p.32[/tpl] Boudreau recounts an incident where Robinson refused the glove to Doby, but when asked by Indians traveling secretary Spud Goldstein, Robinson obliged.[tpl]cite book|title=Lou Boudreau: Covering All the Bases|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8eSUdoov0AEC&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=larry+doby+gordon+cobbledick&source=bl&ots=K5GcvcbOhn&sig=cwGZY7zkPid1q4pVUvQDERaIorY&sa=X&ei=W6A1UNjKNueYiAeKzoCwAw&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=larry%20doby%20gordon%20cobbledick&f=false|last1=Boudreau|first1=Lou|last2=Schneider|first2=Russell|year=1993|isbn=0-915611-72-4|publisher=Sagamore Publishing|location=Chicago, IL[/tpl][tpl]rp|p.96[/tpl] It would be the only game Doby would start for the remainder of the season.

A columnist wrote in the Plain Dealer on July 8: "Cleveland's man in the street is the right sort of American, as was evidenced right solidly once more by the response to the question: 'How does the signing of Larry Doby by the Indians strike you?

===Cleveland Indians===

====1948-1950====

In 1948, Doby experienced his first spring training with the Indians in Tucson, Arizona. Unlike their white teammates, Doby, along with Satchel Paige and Minnie Miñoso, were not permitted to stay at the nearby Santa Rita hotel but instead stayed with a local black family and used a rental car provided by the Indians for transportation.[tpl]rp|p.71[/tpl] During spring training, Doby read books concerning outfield play, and received instruction and encouragement from former Indians manager Tris Speaker and Indians' farm system director Hank Greenberg. Doby also credited Indians coach Bill McKechnie with helping him adjust to the majors and learning the outfield. During an exhibition game in Houston against the New York Giants, Doby hit a home run that "may have traveled 500 feet before landing far beyond the fence in center field."[tpl]cite web|url=http://testaae.greenwood.com/doc_print.aspx?fileID=MPJ&chapterID=MPJ-878&path=books/greenwood|title=The African American Experience: Pride Against Prejudice: The Biography of Larry Doby|last=Moore|first=Joseph Thomas|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=Westport, CT|publisher=Praeger Publishers|date=23 August 2012|accessdate=24 August 2012[/tpl] As Moore wrote in his biography of Doby, "With that home run, all doubts that Doby would make the 1948 Cleveland team vanished. Doby's presence on the team grew in several categories. His game appearances jumped four-fold from one season ago to 121. He hit .301 on the season with 14 home runs and 66 RBIs, and he raised his batting average nearly 20 points in the last 25 games of the regular season from September 1 to October 4.[tpl]rp|p.71[/tpl] Throughout the regular season Doby was the recipient of racial slurs from opposing teams, and Veeck asked AL president Will Harridge for support in getting players to rein in their animosity towards Doby.[tpl]rp|p.71[/tpl]
Doby became an important piece of Cleveland's World Series victory against the Boston Braves. In Game 4 on October 9, Doby became the first black player to hit a home run in World Series history when he hit one off the Braves' Johnny Sain. A picture featuring an embrace between Doby and white teammate Steve Gromek, who pitched a complete game in Game 4, was on the cover of the next day's Plain Dealer. The photo has been called "a signature moment in the integration of Major League Baseball."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/23/sports/steve-gromek-82-a-pitcher-who-is-best-known-for-a-picture.html|last=Goldstein|first=Richard|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 March 2012|accessdate=4 August 2012|title=Steve Gromek, 82, a Pitcher Who Is Best Known for a Picture|publisher=The New York Times Company[/tpl] Of the picture, Doby said, "The picture was more rewarding and happy for me than actually hitting the home run.

Doby had participated in baseball clinics in 1962 as a member of a travel delegation from the U.S. Department of State.

After retiring as a player, Doby became a scout with the Montreal Expos in 1969 and served as a minor league instructor with the organization in 1970.

After Robinson's hire as manager, Doby returned to work for the Expos. In 1976, Bill Veeck purchased the White Sox for a second time and hired Doby to be the team's batting coach.

==Death and legacy==

Doby and his wife, Helyn, had five children, six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.[tpl]cite web|url=http://capitolwords.org/date/1997/07/08/E1365-2_tribute-to-baseball-legend-and-civil-rights-pionee/|title=Tribute to Baseball Legend and Civil Rights Pioneer, Larry Doby|publisher=Sunlight Foundation|work=Capitolwords.org|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=8 July 1997|last=Pascrell|first=Bill[/tpl] When the Dobys moved to Montclair, Yogi Berra and his wife became neighborhood friends and children of the two families played baseball and football together. Doby underwent a kidney removal operation after a cancerous tumor was detected in 1997. Helyn, married to Doby for 55 years, died in 2001 after a six-month battle with cancer.
Doby died on June 18, 2003, at his home in Montclair, New Jersey, at age 79 after suffering cancer.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/20/sports/larry-doby-who-broke-a-color-barrier-dies-at-79.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=Larry Doby, Who Broke a Color Barrier, Dies at 79|publisher=NYTimes.com|date=June 20, 2003|accessdate=14 July 2012[/tpl]  When Doby died, President George W. Bush made the following statement:
[tpl]quotation|"Larry Doby was a good and honorable man, and a tremendous athlete and manager. He had a profound influence on the game of baseball, and he will be missed. As the first African American player in the American League, he helped lead the Cleveland Indians to their last World Series title in 1948, became a nine-time All-Star and was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998. Laura joins me in sending our condolences to Larry's family during this difficult time."[tpl]cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/06/20030620-1.html|title= Statement on Larry Doby|date=20 June 2003|accessdate=13 August 2012|publisher=Whitehouse.archives.gov[/tpl][/tpl]
MLB Commissioner Bud Selig (1998–present) released a statement a day following Doby's death:
[tpl]quotation|"... Like Jackie, he endured the pain of being a pioneer with grace, dignity, and determination and eased the way for all who followed. He achieved another historic second 31 years later he became the second African-American to manage a big league club, following Frank Robinson."[tpl]cite press release|url=http://indians.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20030619&content_id=382806&vkey=pr_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|title=Commissioner's statement on Doby|date=19 June 2003|accessdate=13 August 2012|work=Mlb.com|publisher=Major League Baseball Advanced Media[/tpl][/tpl]
Former MLB Commissioner Fay Vincent said:
Long before Doby was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame came induction in the Indians Hall of Fame in August 1966. Later, in May 1973, he was inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame and in 2010, the New Jersey Hall of Fame.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=u3wsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1swEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5765,2668360&dq=larry+doby+1958+season&hl=en|title=Larry Doby Named to Hall of Fame|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=27 August 2012|date=12 May 1973|newspaper=Spartanburg Herald-Journal[/tpl] On August 10, 2007, the Indians paid tribute to Doby on Larry Doby Day by collectively using his number (14) on their uniforms. The franchise again honored him when in 2012, Eagle Avenue, next to the Indians' Progressive Field, was renamed "Larry Doby Way" in an on-field postgame ceremony. Among those present at the ceremony were Jim "Mudcat" Grant, Indians president Mark Shapiro, Cleveland mayor Frank Jackson, and various members of Doby's family.[tpl]cite news|first=Paul|last=Hoynes|title=Larry Doby's pioneering role with Tribe, American League recognized: Indians Insider |url=http://www.cleveland.com/tribe/index.ssf/2012/07/larry_dobys_pioneering_role_wi.html |newspaper=The Plain Dealer|publisher=Advance Media|date=6 July 2012|accessdate=7 July 2012|location=Cleveland, OH[/tpl]
The city of Paterson, New Jersey, renamed the Eastside Park baseball field "Larry Doby Field" on June 1, 2002.[tpl]rp|p.14[/tpl] The Yogi Berra Museum has a section named the Larry Doby Wing. Of Berra, Doby said, "Yogi was one of the first opposing players to talk to me. As a catcher, Yogi talked to everybody. I finally had to tell the umpire: 'Please tell him to shut up. He asked me how my family was back in the first inning.'" In 2011, the U.S. Postal Service announced that Doby would be one of the four baseball players (along with Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, and Willie Stargell) to appear on a postage stamp in 2012, as part of its "Major League Baseball All-Stars" series.[tpl]cite web|title=Larry Doby receives stamp of approval|date=18 August 2011|publisher=Foxsports.com|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/Larry-Doby-Cleveland-Indians-first-black-player-in-American-League-to-be-honored-with-US-postal-service-stamp-081811|accessdate=18 August 2011[/tpl] The stamp was released July 21, 2012.[tpl]cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/baseball/mlb/wires/07/21/2080.ap.bbo.larry.doby.stamp.0164/ | title = Cleveland's Hall of Famer Larry Doby gets US stamp|work =Si.com|location=New York, NY|publisher=Time Warner| date=21 July 2012|accessdate=28 July 2012[/tpl]
