Julia Carolyn Child (née McWilliams; August 15, 1912 – August 13, 2004) was an American chef, author, and television personality. She is recognized for bringing French cuisine to the American public with her debut cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and her subsequent television programs, the most notable of which was The French Chef, which premiered in 1963.

==Childhood and education==

Child was born Julia Carolyn McWilliams in Pasadena, California, the daughter of John McWilliams, Jr., a Princeton University graduate and prominent land manager, and his wife, the former Julia Carolyn ("Caro") Weston, a paper-company heiress whose father, Byron Curtis Weston, served as lieutenant governor of Massachusetts. The eldestThe Biography of Julia Child, Noel Riley Fitch, pg. 169, paragraph 2..."Dorothy (at six feet four)" of three children, she had a brother, John III (1914–2002), and a sister, Dorothy Dean Cousins (1917–2006).
Child attended Westridge School, Polytechnic School from fourth grade to ninth grade,  then the Katherine Branson School in Ross, California, which was at the time a boarding school. At six feet, two inches (1.88 m) tall, Child played tennis, golf, and basketball as a child and continued to play sports while attending Smith College, from which she graduated in 1934 with a major in English.[tpl]Cite video | people = Michael Rosen (interviewer) |title=Julia Child – Archive Interview, part 1 of 6 |medium=video |publisher=Archive of American Television |date=June 25, 1999  |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3u1ljheBtY&feature=related |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100408175729/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3u1ljheBtY&feature=related |archivedate=2010-04-08 |accessdate=2013-05-24[/tpl] A press release issued by Smith in 2004 states that her major was history.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.smith.edu/newssmith/fall2004/child.php|title = Farewell, "French Chef"| publisher = Smith College| publisher = NewsSmith | date = Fall 2004[/tpl]
Following her graduation from college, Child moved to New York City, where she worked as a copywriter for the advertising department of upscale home-furnishing firm W. & J. Sloane. Returning to California in 1937, she spent the next four years writing for local publications, working in advertising, and volunteering with the Junior League of Pasadena.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.juniorleaguegr.com/jlgr/npo.jsp?pg=news&article=532|title=The Junior League Asks: So What Else Was Julia Child Known For?[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl]

==World War II==

Child joined the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) after finding that she was too tall to enlist in the Women's Army Corps (WACs) or in the U.S. Navy's WAVES.[tpl]cite book|last=Child, Julia|coauthor=Prud'homme, Alex|title=My Life in France|publisher=Random House|year=2006|page=85|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8cKLQO4bgDQC&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=julia+child+oss+too+tall&source=bl&ots=DaMV9YVB0s&sig=yJw97hJgt2ehNBN0_-WsBmTEIO4&hl=en&ei=EgSvSvPVLo6llAew4ZjqBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6#v=onepage&q=&f=false|isbn=978-0-307-27769-5[/tpl] She began her OSS career as a typist at its headquarters in Washington, but because of her education and experience soon was given a more responsible position as a top secret researcher working directly for the head of OSS, General William J. Donovan.[tpl]cite web|title=Julia Child Dished Out ... Spy Secrets?|url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=5579095|publisher=ABC|date=2008-08-14|accessdate=2010-02-16[/tpl]
As a research assistant in the Secret Intelligence division, she typed 10,000 names on white note cards to keep track of officers. For a year, she worked at the OSS Emergency Rescue Equipment Section (ERES) in Washington, D.C. as a file clerk and then as an assistant to developers of a shark repellent needed to ensure that sharks would not explode ordnance targeting German U-boats. In 1944 she was posted to Kandy, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where her responsibilities included "registering, cataloging and channeling a great volume of highly classified communications" for the OSS's clandestine stations in Asia.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-archives15-2008aug15,0,1415513.story|title=Files from WWII Office of Strategic Services are secret no more|last=Miller|first=Greg|date=August 15, 2008|work=Los Angeles Times[/tpl] She was later posted to China, where she received the Emblem of Meritorious Civilian Service as head of the Registry of the OSS Secretariat.[tpl]cite web|title=A Look Back ...

While in Ceylon, she met Paul Cushing Child, also an OSS employee, and the two were married September 1, 1946, in Lumberville, Pennsylvania,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/pages/juliachild|work=Cooksinfo.com|title=Julia Child[/tpl] later moving to Washington, D.C.

He joined the United States Foreign Service, and in 1948 the couple moved to Paris when the US State Department assigned Paul there as an exhibits officer with the United States Information Agency. The couple had no children.

==Post-war France==

Child repeatedly recalled her first meal in Rouen as a culinary revelation; once, she described the meal of oysters, sole meunière, and fine wine to The New York Times as "an opening up of the soul and spirit for me." In Paris, she attended the famous Le Cordon Bleu cooking school and later studied privately with Max Bugnard and other master chefs.[tpl]cite news|journal=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/11/arts/11iht-bookwed.html|title=Books: My Life in France|author=William Grimes|date=April 11, 2006 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-05-24[/tpl] She joined the women's cooking club Cercle des Gourmettes, through which she met Simone Beck, who was writing a French cookbook for Americans with her friend Louisette Bertholle. Beck proposed that Child work with them, to make the book appeal to Americans. In 1951, Child, Beck, and Bertholle began to teach cooking to American women in Child's Paris kitchen, calling their informal school L'école des trois gourmandes (The School of the Three Food Lovers). For the next decade, as the Childs moved around Europe and finally to Cambridge, Massachusetts, the three researched and repeatedly tested recipes. Child translated the French into English, making the recipes detailed, interesting, and practical.
In 1963, the Childs built a home near the Provence town of Plascassier in the hills above Cannes on property belonging to co-author Simone Beck and her husband, Jean Fischbacher. The Childs named it "La Pitchoune", a Provençal word meaning "the little one" but over time the property was often affectionately referred to simply as "La Peetch".[tpl]cite book|last=Child|first=Julia|coauthor=Prud'homme, Alex|title=My Life in France|publisher=Random House|year=2006|pages=268–272|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8cKLQO4bgDQC&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=julia+child+oss+too+tall&source=bl&ots=DaMV9YVB0s&sig=yJw97hJgt2ehNBN0_-WsBmTEIO4&hl=en&ei=EgSvSvPVLo6llAew4ZjqBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6#v=onepage&q=&f=false|isbn=978-0-307-27769-5[/tpl]

==Media career==

The three would-be authors initially signed a contract with publisher Houghton Mifflin, which later rejected the manuscript for seeming too much like an encyclopedia. Finally, when it was first published in 1961 by Alfred A. Knopf, the 726-page Mastering the Art of French Cooking[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/161490-bless-this-mess-sweeping-the-kitchen-with-julia-child/|title=Bless This Mess: Sweeping the Kitchen with Julia Child|work=PopMatters|date=2012-08-13|author=J.C. Maçek III[/tpl] was a best-seller and received critical acclaim that derived in part from the American interest in French culture in the early 1960s. Lauded for its helpful illustrations and precise attention to detail, and for making fine cuisine accessible, the book is still in print and is considered a seminal culinary work. Following this success, Child wrote magazine articles and a regular column for The Boston Globe newspaper. She would go on to publish nearly twenty titles under her name and with others. Many, though not all, were related to her television shows. Her last book was the autobiographical My Life in France, published posthumously in 2006 and written with her grand nephew, Alex Prud'homme. The book recounts Child's life with her husband, Paul Child, in post-World War II France.

===The French Chef and related books===

A 1962 appearance on a book review show on the National Educational Television (NET) station of Boston, WGBH, led to the inception of her first television cooking show after viewers enjoyed her demonstration of how to cook an omelette. The French Chef had its debut on February 11, 1963, on WGBH and was immediately successful. The show ran nationally for ten years and won Peabody and Emmy Awards, including the first Emmy award for an educational program. Though she was not the first television cook, Child was the most widely seen. She attracted the broadest audience with her cheery enthusiasm, distinctively charming warbly voice, and unpatronizing and unaffected manner. In 1972, The French Chef became the first television program to be captioned for the deaf, albeit in the preliminary technology of open captioning.
Child's second book, The French Chef Cookbook, was a collection of the recipes she had demonstrated on the show. It was soon followed in 1971 by Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume Two, again in collaboration with Simone Beck, but not with Louisette Bertholle, with whom the professional relationship had ended. Child's fourth book, From Julia Child's Kitchen, was illustrated with her husband's photographs and documented the color series of The French Chef, as well as providing an extensive library of kitchen notes compiled by Child during the course of the show.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]

===Later career===

In the 1970s and 1980s, she was the star of numerous television programs, including Julia Child & Company, Julia Child & More Company and Dinner at Julia's. For the 1979 book Julia Child and More Company she won a National Book Award in category Current Interest.[ref]
"National Book Awards – 1980". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-09. 
There was a "Contemporary" or "Current" award category from 1972 to 1980.[/ref] In 1981 she founded The American Institute of Wine & Food,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aiwf.org/site/who-we-are.html|title=American Institute of Wine and Food[/tpl] with vintners Robert Mondavi and Richard Graff, and others, to "advance the understanding, appreciation and quality of wine and food," a pursuit she had already begun with her books and television appearances. In 1989, she published what she considered her magnum opus, a book and instructional video series collectively entitled The Way To Cook.
Child starred in four more series in the 1990s that featured guest chefs: Cooking with Master Chefs, In Julia's Kitchen with Master Chefs, Baking with Julia, and Julia Child & Jacques Pépin Cooking at Home. She collaborated with Jacques Pépin many times for television programs and cookbooks. All of Child's books during this time stemmed from the television series of the same names.
Child's use of ingredients like butter and cream has been questioned by food critics and modern-day nutritionists. She addressed these criticisms throughout her career, predicting that a "fanatical fear of food" would take over the country's dining habits, and that focusing too much on nutrition takes the pleasure from enjoying food.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/11/garden/savoring-the-world-according-to-julia.html|work=New York Times|title=Savoring the World According to Julia|first=Molly|last=O'Neill|date=October 11, 1989[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/24/business/24julia.html|work=New York Times|title=After 48 Years, Julia Child Has a Big Best Seller, Butter and All|first=Stephanie|last=Clifford|date=August 23, 2009[/tpl] In a 1990 interview, Child said, "Everybody is overreacting. If fear of food continues, it will be the death of gastronomy in the United States. Fortunately, the French don't suffer from the same hysteria we do. We should enjoy food and have fun. It is one of the simplest and nicest pleasures in life."[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/20/garden/julia-child-boiling-answers-her-critics.html|work=New York Times|title=Julia Child Boiling, Answers Her Critics|first=Carol|last=Lawson|date=June 19, 1990[/tpl]
thumb|right|Julia Child's kitchen Julia Child's kitchen, designed by her husband, was the setting for three of her television shows. It is now on display at the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. Beginning with In Julia's Kitchen with Master Chefs, the Childs' home kitchen in Cambridge was fully transformed into a functional set, with TV-quality lighting, three cameras positioned to catch all angles in the room, and a massive center island with a gas stovetop on one side and an electric stovetop on the other, but leaving the rest of the Childs' appliances alone, including "my wall oven with its squeaking door."[tpl]cite book |title=In Julia's Kitchen with Master Chefs|last=Child|first=Julia|year=1995|publisher=Knopf|isbn=0-679-43896-3|chapter=Acknowledgments[/tpl] This kitchen backdrop hosted nearly all of Child's 1990s television series.

==Last years and posthumous==

After the death of her beloved friend Simone Beck, Child relinquished La Pitchoune after a monthlong stay in June 1992 with her family, her niece, Phila, and close friend and biographer, Noël Riley Fitch. She turned the keys over to Jean Fischbacher's sister, just as she and Paul had promised nearly 30 years earlier. Also in 1992, Julia spent five days in Sicily at the invitation of Regaleali Winery.  American journalist Bob Spitz spent a brief time with Julia during that period while he was researching and writing his then working title, History of Eating and Cooking in America.
Spitz took notes and made many recordings of his conversation with Child and these later formed the basis of a secondary biography on Child, published August 7, 2012 (Knopf), five days before the centennial of her birthdate.[tpl]cite book|last=Spitz|first=Bob|title=Dearie: The Remarkable Life of Julia Child|publisher=Vintage Books|date=2013-04-23|isbn=978-0-307-47341-7[/tpl]"Biography reveals insecurities plagued Julia Child", CTV News, August 7, 2012 Paul Child, who was ten years older than his wife, died in 1994 after living in a nursing home for five years following a series of strokes in 1989.[tpl]cite book|last=Child|first=Julia|coauthor=Prud'homme, Alex|title=My Life in France|publisher=Random House|year=2006|pages=329–333|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8cKLQO4bgDQC&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=julia+child+oss+too+tall&source=bl&ots=DaMV9YVB0s&sig=yJw97hJgt2ehNBN0_-WsBmTEIO4&hl=en&ei=EgSvSvPVLo6llAew4ZjqBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6#v=onepage&q=&f=false|isbn=978-0-307-27769-5[/tpl]

==Legacy==

===The Julia Child Foundation===

While she was still alive, in 1995, Julia Child established The Julia Child Foundation for Gastronomy and Culinary Arts, a private charitable foundation to make grants to further her life's work.  The Foundation, originally set-up in Massachusetts, later moved to Santa Barbara, California, where it is now headquartered.  Inactive until after Julia's death in 2004, the Foundation makes grants to other non-profits.[tpl]cite web|title=Welcome|url=http://juliachildfoundation.org/|work=The Julia Child Foundation for Gastronomy and the Culinary Arts|accessdate=5 December 2013[/tpl]  The grants support primarily gastronomy, the culinary arts and the further development of the professional food world, all matters of paramount importance to Julia Child during her lifetime.  The Foundation's website provides a dedicated page listing the names of grant recipients with a description of the organization and the grant provided by the Foundation.[tpl]cite web|title=Grants|url=http://juliachildfoundation.org/grants.html|work=The Julia Child Foundation for Gastronomy and the Culinary Arts|accessdate=5 December 2013[/tpl]  Beyond making grants, the Foundation was also established to protect Julia Child's legacy; it is the organization to approach to seek permission to use images of Julia Child and/or excerpts of her work.  Many of these rights are jointly held with other organizations like her publishers and the Schlesinger Library at The Radcliffe Institute at Harvard University who may also need to be contacted.  Recently, the Foundation has been more active in protecting these posthumous rights.  Well known for her opposition to endorsements, the Foundation follows a similar policy regarding the use of Julia's name and image for commercial purposes.[tpl]cite news|title=Legal battle erupts over Julia Child images used in Thermador ads|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/28/news/la-dd-legal-battle-erupts-over-julia-child-images-used-in-thermador-ads-20120828|accessdate=5 December 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=28 August 2012[/tpl]

==Awards and nominations==

==In popular culture==

Child was a favorite of audiences from the moment of her television début on public television in 1963, and she was a familiar part of American culture and the subject of numerous references, including numerous parodies in television and radio programs and skits. Her great success on air may have been tied to her refreshingly pragmatic approach to the genre, "I think you have to decide who your audience is. If you don’t pick your audience, you’re lost because you’re not really talking to anybody. My audience is people who like to cook, who want to really learn how to do it."
In 1996, Julia Child was ranked No. 46 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.[tpl]cite journal |year=1996 |title=Special Collectors' Issue: 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time |journal=TV Guide |issue=December 14–20 |url=http://www.amiannoying.com/(S(ilbe3io1eaeucg5vjnkcwz1e))/collection.aspx?collection=1194  |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-05-24[/tpl]

===Julie/Julia===

In 2002, Child was the inspiration for "The Julie/Julia Project," a popular cooking blog by Julie Powell that was the basis of Powell's 2005 bestselling book, Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen. The paperback version of the book was retitled Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously.[tpl]cite web|last=Powell|first=Julie|publisher=Salon.com |url=http://blogs.salon.com/0001399/2002/08/25.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021013043154/http://blogs.salon.com/0001399/2002/08/25.html |title=The Julie/Julia Project: Nobody here but us servantless American cooks...|date=August 25, 2002|archivedate=October 13, 2002|accessdate=August 16, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/031610969X|title='Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen'|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2012-12-31[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/031604251X|title=Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2012-12-31[/tpl]  The blog and book, along with Child's own memoir My Life in France, in turn inspired the 2009 feature film Julie & Julia in which Meryl Streep portrayed Child. For her performance, Streep received an Academy Award for Best Actress nomination.
Child is reported to have been unimpressed by Powell's blog, believing Powell's determination to cook every recipe in Mastering the Art of French Cooking in a year to be a stunt. Child's editor, Judith Jones, said in an interview: "Flinging around four-letter words when cooking isn't attractive, to me or Julia. She didn't want to endorse it. What came through on the blog was somebody who was doing it almost for the sake of a stunt. She would never really describe the end results, how delicious it was, and what she learned. Julia didn’t like what she called 'the flimsies'. She didn't suffer fools, if you know what I mean."[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.eatmedaily.com/2009/07/julia-child-considered-the-juliejulia-project-a-stunt|title=Julia Child Considered 'The Julie/Julia Project' a Stunt|publisher=Eatmedaily.com|date=2009-07-20|accessdate=2012-12-31[/tpl]
