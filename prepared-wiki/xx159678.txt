The Australian Nations Cup Championship was a motor racing title sanctioned by the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport from 2000 to 2004. 

==History==

Nations Cup evolved from the GT Production category, which was created in 1995 by category managers PROCAR Australia. For 2000, PROCAR split The Australian GT Production Car Championship into two separate series so that the more exotic GT cars such as Porsche 911s and Ferrari 360s could compete in the new Australian Nations Cup Championship and the lesser vehicles such as the Mitsubishi Lancers and Subaru Imprezas could now compete for outright wins in the revised Australian GT Production Car Championship.

===Demise===

With the demise of PROCAR during 2004, CAMS revived the Australian GT Championship and the series was merged into the grids of the Australian Porsche Drivers Challenge, itself a class of refugees left over after the Australian Carrera Cup Championship replaced the former Porsche Cup. The regulations differed and not all Nations Cup cars were eligible to race in the GT series, the controversial Holden Monaro 427C the most notable such example.
