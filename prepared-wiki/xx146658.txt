Country Casanova is the third album by the band Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen.  It was released in 1973 on Paramount Records.  
The album was originally available on LP and 8-track, and later cassette.  In 1991, it was released on CD.
Country Casanova is highlighted by the band's classic cover version of "Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! (That Cigarette)." Their cover version of "Everybody's Doin' It" reportedly got them banned from some country music stations because it includes the word "fuckin'" repeated several times, band leader George Frayne claimed in the liner notes of Too Much Fun: The Best of Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen. The original song was a 1937 Western Swing recording by the Modern Mountaineers, a Texas band. It, too included "fuckin'" in the lyric, a trick pulled by pianist-vocalist Smokey Wood.  Cody copied the original arrangement at a slightly faster tempo and removed the original's reference to "darkies."

==Album cover==

The album cover shows George Frayne, a.k.a. "The Commander", leaning against a White 1962 or 1963 Lincoln Continental (suicide doors)  The car is backed up to a fence, and there is a donkey off to the left of the car.  According to The Commander, the Donkey's name was also George.  The Lincoln belonged to the famous Rock & Roll photographer Jim Marshall, who was the photographer who took the picture for the album cover.

==Back cover==

The back cover of the album features the band standing in front of their tour bus, which was a 1950s Greyhound Scenicruiser (double decker) in its past life.  The bus is pulled off to the side of a road...somewhere...and to the right of the bus, in the background, you can see what looks like a blue and white Ford pickup truck cruising down the road. If you notice, Commander Cody can be seen holding a drink of some sort in this picture.  Band members are displayed left to right, front to rear, as noted: Andy Stein (fiddle, saxophone) Billy C. Farlow (Lead Vocal) (both sitting on an instrument case) behind them, standing, left to right, we have Bill Kirchen (Lead guitar and banjo, lead vocal on "My Window Faces The South" and "Honeysuckle Honey") (On original the LP release, as well as the MCA CD issue of this album Kirchen's name is spelled "Kircher", which is incorrect.)
