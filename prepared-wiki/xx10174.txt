The population of Russia peaked at 148,689,000 in 1991, just before the breakup of the Soviet Union. Low birth rates and abnormally high death rates caused Russia's population to decline at a 0.5% annual rate, or about 750,000 to 800,000 people per year from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s. The UN warned in 2005 that Russia's then population of about 143 million could fall by a third by 2050, if trends did not improve.[tpl]cite news|author=Steven Eke|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4125072.stm|title=Russia's population falling fast|publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=15 March 2008  | date=23 June 2005 2007[/tpl]United Nations ECOSOC,http://esa.un.org/unpp/ World Population Prospects: the 2008 Revision Population Database, Medium variant.
The Russian state statistics service Rosstat had more optimistic forecasts in 2009, whose Medium variant predicted that Russia's population would only fall to 139 million by 2030Rosstat Retrieved 16 March 2010 (Low: 127 million; High: 147 million). Furthermore, in 2008 one demographic analyst (correctly) predicted a resumption in population growth by 2010, and of natural population growth by 2013.Da Russophile: Faces of the Future Retrieved 16 March 2010
The number of Russians living in poverty has decreased by 50% since the economic crisis following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the improving economy had a positive impact on the country's low birth rate. The latter rose from its lowest point of 8.27 births per 1000 people in 1999 to 12.6 per 1000 in 2010. Likewise, the fertility rate rose from its lowest point of 1.16 in 1999 to 1.54 in 2009. 2007 marked the highest growth in birth rates that the country had seen in 25 years, and 2009 marked the highest total birth rate since 1991.Russian policies ignite unprecedented birth rate in 2007 The Economic Times 21 March 2008
While the Russian birth rate is comparable to that of other developed countries, its death rate is much higher, especially among working-age males due to a comparatively high rate of fatalities caused by heart disease and other external causes such as accidents. The Russian death rate in 2010 was 14.3 per 1000 citizens. For comparison, the USCIA Factbook – USA Retrieved on 27 March 2010 death rate in 2009 was 8.4 per 1000 .

===Demographic crisis and recovery prospects===

The causes for this sharp increase in mortality are widely debated. According to a 2009 report by The Lancet,Mass privatisation and the post-communist mortality crisis: a cross-national analysis The Lancet Retrieved on 02-12-09 a British medical journal, mass privatization, an element of the economic-reform package nicknamed shock therapy, clearly correlates with higher mortality rates. The report argues that advocates of economic reforms ignored the human cost of the policies they were promoting, such as unemployment and human suffering, leading to an early death. These conclusions were criticized by The Economist.Ex-communist reform – Mass murder and the market The Economist Retrieved on 02-12-09 A WHO press-release in 2000, on the other hand, reported widespread alcohol abuse in Russia being used as the most common explanation of higher men's mortality.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.who.int/inf-pr-2000/en/pr2000-life.html |title=WHO Life Expectancy Projections 2000 – ministry|publisher=World Health Organisation |accessdate=7 January 2009[/tpl]
A 2009 study blamed alcohol for more than half the deaths (52%) among Russians aged 15 to 54 in the '90s. For the same demographic, this compares to 4% of deaths for the rest of the world. The study claimed alcohol consumption in mid-90s in Russia averaged 10.5 litres, and was based on personal interviews conducted in three Siberian industrial cities, Barnaul, Biysk and Omsk.Burlington Free Press, 26 June 2009, page 2A, "Study blames alcohol for half Russian deaths"
According to the Russian demographic publication Demoscope,Смертность в России сквозь призму приватизации [tpl]ru icon[/tpl] the rising male death rate was a long-term trend from 1960 to 2005. The only significant reversion of the trend was caused by Mikhail Gorbachev's anti-alcohol campaign, but its effect was only temporary. According to the publication, the sharp rise of death rates in the early 1990s was caused by the exhaustion of the effect of the anti-alcohol campaign, while the market reforms were only of secondary importance. The authors also claimed the Lancet's study is flawed because it used the 1985 death rate as the base, while that was in fact the very maximum of the effect of the anti-alcohol campaign.
Other factors contributing to the collapse, along with the economic problems, include the dying off of a relatively large cohort of people born between 1925 and 1940 (between the Russian Civil War and World War II), when Russian birth rates were very high, along with, ironically enough, an "echo boom" in the 1980s that may have satisfied the demand of women for children, leading to a subsequent drop in birth rates.
In 2006, the Minister of Health Mikhail Zurabov and Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee for Health Protection Nikolai Gerasimenko proposed reinstating the Soviet-era tax on childlessness, which ended in 1992."Childless Russian families to pay taxes for their social inaction," http://english.pravda.ru/russia/economics/15-09-2006/84467-childless-0 (accessed 3 January 2010.) So far, it has not been reinstated.
Government measures to halt the demographic crisis was a key subject of Vladimir Putin's 2006 state of the nation address.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mosnews.com/column/2006/05/11/PutinAddress.shtml |title=Vladimir Putin's State-of-the-Nation Address |publisher=Mosnews.com |date= |accessdate=23 October 2011[/tpl] As a result, a national programme was developed with the goal to reverse the trend by 2020. Soon after, a study published in 2007 showed that the rate of population decrease had begun to slow: if the net decrease from January to August 2006 was 408,200 people, it was 196,600 in the same period in 2007. The death rate accounted for 357,000 of these, which is 137,000 less than in 2006.Newsru, Население России за пять лет уменьшилось на 3,2 миллиона до 142 миллионов человек, 19.Oct.2007 Retrieved same date
At the same time period in 2007, there were just over one million births in Russia (981,600 in 2006), whilst deaths decreased from 1,475,000 to 1,402,300. In all, the number of deaths exceeded the number of births by 1.3 times, down from 1.5 in 2006. 18 of the 83 provinces showed a natural growth of population (in 2006: 16). The Russian Ministry of Economic Development expressed hope that by 2020 the population would stabilize at 138–139 million, and by 2025, to increase again to its present day status of 143–145, also raising the life expectancy to 75 years.
The natural population decline continued to slow through 2008—2012 due to declining death rates and increasing birth rates. In 2009 the population saw yearly growth for the first time in 15 years.Russia sees first population increase in 15 years BBC Retrieved on 18 February 2009 In September 2009, the Ministry of Health and Social Development reported that Russia recorded natural population growth for the first time in 15 years, with 1,000 more births than deaths in August.In Russia the first time in 15 years recorded population growth Retrieved on 09-09-30 In April 2011 the Russian Prime Minister (Russian president as of 2012) Vladimir Putin pledged to spend the 1.5 trillion rubles (£32.5 billion or $54 billion) on various measures to boost Russia's declining birthrate by 30 per cent in the next four years.[tpl]cite news|author=Tom Parfitt in Moscow |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/21/vladimir-putin-increasing-russian-life-expectancy |title=Vladimir Putin pledges to spend £32bn on increasing Russian life expectancy, World news |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=14 May 2011 |date=21 April 2011[/tpl]
In 2012, the birth rate increased again. Russia recorded 1,896,263 births, the highest number since 1990, and even exceeding annual births during the period 1967–1969, with a TFR of about 1.7, the highest since 1991. (Source: Vital statistics table below). In fact, Russia, despite having only slightly more people than Japan, has recently had nearly twice as many births as that country. The number of births is expected to fall over the next few years as women born during the baby bust in the 1990s enter their prime childbearing years, but this would not have an effect on the TFR. The preliminary 2013 figure again shows 1.9 million births, about the same as in 2012, but because the number of women of childbearing age is dropping, especially for those in their early 20s, the TFR will actually show a rise.

===Immigration===

In 2006, in a bid to compensate for the country's demographic decline, the Russian government started simplifying immigration laws and launched a state program "for providing assistance to voluntary immigration of ethnic Russians from former Soviet republics".RIA Novosti, 14 July 2006 http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20060714/51327247.html In August 2012, as the country saw its first demographic growth since the 1990s, President Putin declared that Russia's population could reach 146 million by 2025, mainly as a result of immigration.RIA Novosti, 20 August 2012, http://en.ria.ru/society/20120820/175324629.html

In recent years,[tpl]When|date=February 2014[/tpl] most immigrants have come from Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. This has resulted in ethnic tension. Every year, 300,000 immigrants arrive in Russia, of which almost half are ethnic Russians. In the 1990s, immigration was the main reason Russia didn't suffer substantial population decline. It reached a peak of 1,200,000 in 1994, mostly ethnic Russians from ex-Soviet states fleeing from social, economic or political reasons such as the civil war in Tajikistan from 1992 to 1997.
It has been noted that in the Far East a number of Mongols and Chinese immigrate for work. The problem has become so severe it has caused a rise in Russian nationalism, and spawned groups like Movement Against Illegal Immigration.[tpl]cite news|title= The Backlash Against Immigration in Russia |work=Newsweek|date=|url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/02/13/the-kremlin-vigilantes.html|accessdate=6 April 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title= Some 500 illegal immigrants from Vietnam arrested in Moscow |work=RIA Novosti|date=|url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/02/13/the-kremlin-vigilantes.html|accessdate=6 April 2012[/tpl]

===Total fertility rates===

As of 2013, Russian TFR of 1.707 children per woman is among the highest in the Eastern Europe, which means an average Russian family has more children (1.7) than an average family in most other Eastern European countries. Still, this rate is far below the replacement rate of 2.1 – 2.14.
In 1990, just prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia's total fertility rate (TFR) stood at 1.89. Fertility rates had already begun to decline in the late 80s due to the natural progression of Russia's demographic structure, but the rapid and widely negative changes in society following the collapse greatly influenced the rate of decline.Russia's Demographic "Crisis" 1996 RAND, page 13-18, Retrieved on 3 March 2009, ISBN 0-8330-2446-9 The TFR hit an historic low of 1.157 in 1999 and has since begun to rise again, reaching 1.707 in 2013 (growth of 47.5%).[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html |title=The World Factbook 2009 |publisher= Central Intelligence Agency |location =Washington DC |year=2009 |accessdate=7 December 9[/tpl] The only federal subject of Russia to see a decline in fertility since 1999 is Ingushetia, where the TFR has fallen by 20% from 2.44 to 1.97 as of 2009. However, TFR for Ingushetia for the year 2011 was recorded at 2.94.http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/doc_2012/wo-man12.rar
In 2009, 8 of Russia's federal subjects had a TFR above 2.1 children per woman (the approximate minimum required to ensure population replacement). These federal subjects are Chechnya (3.38), Tuva (2.81), Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug (2.73), Agin-Buryat Okrug (2.63), Komi-Permyak (2.16), Evenk Okrug (2.58), Altai Republic (2.36), Nenets Autonomous Okrug (2.1). Of these federal subjects, four have an ethnic Russian majority (Altai, Evenk, Ust-Orda and Nenets).Fertility Rate Statistics, Demoscope.ru, Retrieved on 10 September 2009 In 2011, the highest TFR were recorded in Chechnya (3.362), Tyva (3.249), Ingushetia (2.94), Altai Republic (2.836), Sakha Republic (2.057), Buryatia (2.027), and Nenets Autonomous Okrug (2.007).
Until 2010, the Russian republic of Chechnya was the region with the highest birth rate in the former USSR (excluding Central Asia). However in 2011, the Armenian province of Qashatagh overtook it (28.9 vs 29.3 per 1,000).http://www.stat-nkr.am/files/yearbooks/2004_2010/5_bnakchut.pdf
In 2010, The average number of children born to women has decreased from 1513 to 1000 women from 2002 to 1469 in 2010 in urban areas the figure was 1328 children (2002–1350), and in the village – 1876 (in 2002. – 1993 ).
In recent years the percentage of children per woman 16 years or more were:
Year :                             2002–2010
1 child :                          30.5%–31.2%
2 children :                       33.7%–34.4%
3 children :                        8.9%–8.7%
4 or more children :                5.2%–4.2%
no children :                      21.7%–21.5%
Note that despite a decrease in women who have not had children, the number of three-child and large families has declined between 2002 and 2010.
In every region in Russia rural areas reported higher TFR compared to urban areas. In most of the federal subjects in Siberia and the Russian Far East, the total fertility rates were high, but not high enough to ensure population replacement. For example, Zabaykalsky Krai had a TFR of 1.82, which is higher than the national average, but less than the 2.1 needed for population replacement.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gks.ru/dbscripts/Cbsd/DBInet.cgi?pl=2415002 |title=Rosstat TFR database |publisher=Gks.ru |accessdate=14 May 2011[/tpl]

==Health==

===Life expectancy===

total population: 70.8 years
 male: 65.1 years
 female: 76.5 years (2013)
The disparity in the average lifespan between genders in Russia is largest in the world. Women live 9–12 years longer than men, while the difference in lifespan is typically only five years in other parts of the world. While medical sources, like The Lancet, name mass privatization, and the neo-liberalist shock therapy policies of Yeltsin administration as key reasons of falling life expectancy of Russian men, other sources, like Luke Harding from The Guardian claim alcoholism explains the large difference in gender mortality levels in Russia.Luke Harding: No country for old men The Guardian, 11 February 2008 As of 2011, the average life expectancy in Russia was 64.3 years for males and 76.1 years for females.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.perepis-2010.ru/news/detail.php?ID=7049 |title=Ожидаемая продолжительность жизни россиян выросла на 3,7 года в 2011г – Голикова |publisher=Perepis-2010.ru |date= |accessdate=4 June 2013[/tpl] According to the WHO 2011 report,http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/msbgsruprofiles.pdf annual per capita alcohol consumption in Russia is about 15.76 litres, fourth highest volume in Europe (compare to 13.37 in the UK, 13.66 in France, 15.6 in Ukraine, 16.45 in the Czech Republic, etc.).
In the late 1950s, the USSR claimed a higher life expectancy than the United States,Yeltsin: healthier than the average Russian: Poverty, pollution and drink has slashed life expectancy, writes Phil Reeves The Independent, 29 September 1996 but the Soviet Union has lagged behind Western countries in terms of mortality and life expectancy since the late 1960s.
The life expectancy was about 70 in 1986,A Country Study: Soviet Union (Former) Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, Edited by Raymond E. Zickel 1989. Chapter 3 – Population – Vital Statistics prior to the transition-induced disruption of the healthcare system. The turmoil in the early 1990s caused life expectancy in Russia to steadily decrease while it was steadily increasing in the rest of the world. Recently however, Russian life expectancy has again begun to rise. Between 2006—2011 the male life expectancy in Russia rose by almost four years, increasing the overall life expectancy by nearly 4 years to 70.3.

===Mortality===

In 2012, 1,043,292, or 55% of all deaths in Russia were caused by cardiovascular disease. The second leading cause of death was cancer which claimed 287,840 lives (15.2%). External causes of death such as suicide (1.5%), road accidents (1.5%), murders (0.8%), accidental alcohol poisoning (0.4%), and accidental drowning (0.5%), claimed 202,175 lives in total (10.6%). Other major causes of death were diseases of the digestive system (4.6%), respiratory disease (3.6%), infectious and parasitic diseases (1.6%), and tuberculosis (0.9%). The infant mortality rate in 2012 was 7.6 deaths per 1,000 (down from 8.2 in 2009 and 16.9 in 1999).

===Under-five mortality rate===

===Abortions and Family Planning===

In the 1980s only 8–10% of married Russian women of reproductive age used hormonal and intrauterine contraception methods, compared to 20–40% in developed countries. This led to much higher abortion rates in Russia compared to developed countries: in the 1980s Russia had a figure of 120 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age compared with only 20 per 1,000 in Western countries. However, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union many changes took place, such as the demonopolization of the market for contraceptive drugs and media liberalization, which led to a rapid conversion to more efficient pregnancy control practices. Abortion rates fell in the first half of the 1990s for the first time in Russia's history, even despite declining fertility rates. From the early 1990s to 2006, the number of expected abortions per women during her lifetime fell by nearly 2.5 times, from 3.4 to 1.2. As of 2004, the share of women of reproductive age using hormonal or intrauterine birth control methods was about 46% (29% intrauterine, 17% hormonal).National Human Development Report Russian Federation 2008, UNDP,pages 47–49, Retrieved on 10 October 2009
Despite an increase in "family planning", the target of desired children at the desired time for a large portion of Russian families has not yet been achieved. According to a 2004 study, current pregnancies were termed "desired and timely" by 58% of respondents, while 23% described them as "desired, but untimely", and 19% said they were "undesired". The share of unexpected pregnancies remains much lower in countries with developed family planning culture, such as the Netherlands, whose percentage of unwanted pregnancies 20 years ago was half of that in Russia today.

==Ethnic groups==

The Russian Federation is home to as many as 160 different ethnic groups and indigenous peoples. As of the 2010 census, 80.90% of the population that disclosed their ethnicity (111,016,896 people) is ethnically Russian, followed by (groups larger than one million):
According to the 2010 Census in Russia lived 142,856,536 people. It is important to note that 5,629,429 people (3.94% of the overall population.) did not declare any ethnic origin, compared to about 1 million in the 2002 Census. This is due to the fact that those people were counted from administrative databases and not directly, and were therefore unable to state their ethnicity.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.perepis-2010.ru/news/detail.php?ID=6944 |title=Владивосток: В России стало больше русских |publisher=Perepis-2010.ru |date=20 December 2011 |accessdate=4 June 2013[/tpl] Therefore, the percentages mentioned above are taken from the total population that declared their ethnicity, given that the non-declared remainder is thought to have an ethnic composition similar to the declared segment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.perepis-2010.ru/news/detail.php?ID=6936 |title=Перепись-2010: русских становится больше |publisher=Perepis-2010.ru |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=4 June 2013[/tpl]
Most smaller groups live compactly in their respective regions and can be categorized by language group.
The ethnic divisions used here are those of the official census, and may in some respects be controversial. The following lists all ethnicities resolved by the 2010 census, grouped by language:
