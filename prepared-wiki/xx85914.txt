Gregor MacGregor (24 December 1786 – 4 December 1845) was a Scottish soldier, adventurer, land speculator, and colonizer who fought in the South American struggle for independence. Upon his return to England in 1820, he claimed to be cacique of Poyais (also known as Principality of Poyais, Territory of Poyais, Republic of Poyais), a fictional Central American country that MacGregor had invented which, with his help, drew investors and eventually colonists.

==Early life==

MacGregor was born in the family house of Glengyle in Stirlingshire, Scotland on Christmas Eve 1786 to Daniel MacGregor, a sea captain with the East India Company, and Ann Austin, a doctor's daughter.[tpl]cite book|title=The Scots Magazine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iysoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA154|year=1786|publisher=Sands, Brymer, Murray and Cochran|page=154[/tpl] Little is known of MacGregor's early life but apparently he had at least one sister.[tpl]cite book|author=David Sinclair|title=The Land That Never Was: Sir Gregor MacGregor And The Most Audacious Fraud In History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VS-SRLSVANwC&pg=PA110|accessdate=23 November 2012|date=28 December 2004|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81411-2|page=110[/tpl]
In 1803, at the age of 16, he joined the British Army and served in an infantry regiment, the 57th Foot.[tpl]cite book|author=Moises Enrique Rodriguez|title=Freedom's Mercenaries: Northern South America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Cxd7AAAAMAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Hamilton Books|isbn=978-0-7618-3437-3|page=187[/tpl] By 1804 he had risen to the rank of lieutenant, an unusually rapid progression in the ranks.

Sinclair 2004, p. 117
In July 1809, MacGregor's regiment was sent to Portugal, as reinforcements for the Duke of Wellington's second peninsular campaign to drive the French out of Spain. Accounts of MacGregor's service in this campaign vary, but it is known that for a time he was seconded to the Portuguese army with the rank of major, and that he sold out of the British Army in May 1810,[tpl]cite book|author=M.

MacGregor and his wife then went to Edinburgh, where he assumed the title of "Colonel", but by 1811 they were in London and MacGregor was styling himself Sir Gregor MacGregor, while claiming falsely to have succeeded to the chieftainship of the clan Gregor.Sinclair 2004, p. 124 He was in fact a grandson of one Gregor MacGregor, called "the Beautiful", who belonged to a junior branch of the Glengyle house and joined the Black Watch under the name Drummond.[tpl]cite book|author1=Sir George Grove|author2=David Masson|author3=John Morley|coauthors=Mowbray Morris|title=MacMillan's Magazine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9x4AAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA339|year=1905|pages=339[/tpl]

In December 1811, his wife Mary died.[tpl]cite book|author=Giorgio Antei|title=Los héroes errantes: historia de Agustín Codazzi, 1793–1822|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0N8XAAAAYAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Planeta Colombiana Editorial|language=Spanish|isbn=978-958-614-385-1|page=216[/tpl] By this time, MacGregor had heard about the independence movements in South America and the Captaincy General of Venezuela in particular. He sold his small Scottish estate and sailed for South America, arriving in Caracas in the spring of 1812. There he met Josefa Antonia Andrea Aristeguieta y Lovera,[tpl]cite book|author1=Frank L.

They were married on 10 June 1812.Sinclair 2004, p. 151 They eventually had three children, Gregorio (b. ca. 1817), Constantino, (b. ca. 1819) and Josefa Anna Gregoria (b. ca. 1821).[tpl]cite book|author=Tulio Arends|title=Sir Gregor Mac Gregor: Un Escocés Tras la Aventura de América|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bllsAAAAMAAJ|date=1 January 1991|publisher=Monte Avila Editores|isbn=978-980-01-0265-7|page=31[/tpl]
Upon his arrival in Caracas, MacGregor talked General Francisco de Miranda, the Commander in Chief of the new Venezuelan Republic's army, into appointing him a colonel,[tpl]cite book|title=Diversions of History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MoBmAAAAMAAJ|year=1954|publisher=A. Wingate|page=87[/tpl] and almost immediately became involved in a series of skirmishes that resulted in his promotion to brigadier-general. A month or so later, when General Miranda was captured and handed over to the royalist forces by Simon Bolívar, MacGregor and his wife fled to Curaçao on a British brig.[tpl]cite book|author=William Spence Robertson|title=Francisco de Miranda and the Revolutionizing of Spanish America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jchmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA476|year=1909|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=476[/tpl]  
From Curaçao, MacGregor decided to go to New Granada (present-day Colombia) and join the liberation forces of General Antonio Nariño. For Josefa's safety, he first took her to the British island of Jamaica and then sailed for Cartagena on the northern coast of New Granada. From there he made his way south to Tunja, where General Nariño put him in command of the military district of Socorro, near the Venezuelan border.[tpl]cite book|author=Edward Backhouse Eastwick|title=Venezuela: Or, Sketches of Life in a South American Republic: With the History of the Loan of 1864|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3x8PAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA320|year=1868|publisher=Chapman & Hall|page=320[/tpl] During the year or so he spent here, he earned what became a lifelong reputation as an unreliable braggart. One local official wrote of him: "I am sick and tired of this bluffer, or Quixote, or the devil knows what. This man can hardly serve us in New Granada without heaping ten thousand embarrassments upon us."Sinclair 2004, p. 154.
In 1814, the Spanish royalist forces routed General Nariño's army and MacGregor took refuge in Cartagena de Indias, where he played a role in organizing the city's defenses. In August 1815, the Spanish troops of General Pablo Morillo attacked the city and began a siege that lasted until December, when disease and starvation forced the city to surrender.[tpl]cite book|author=Paul K.

Sinclair 2004, p. 159Rafter 1820, p. 64
In Jamaica, MacGregor was treated as a hero, but by the spring of 1816 he had moved on with Josefa to the neighboring island of Haiti, where Simon Bolívar was raising a new army.[tpl]cite book|author=Gerhard Masur|title=Simon Bolivar|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jNnSqFh7JgwC|year=1969|page=194[/tpl] In April, MacGregor sailed with Bolívar's fleet as a brigadier-general to Venezuela, landing on the island of Margarita before crossing to Carupano on the mainland. Both Bolívar and MacGregor ran into trouble after their forces split up, and MacGregor's troops were eventually forced to retreat towards the town of Barcelona, fighting all the way.[tpl]cite book|author1=Richard W.

==Green Cross of Florida==

MacGregor claimed to be commissioned by representatives of the revolting South American countries to liberate Florida from Spanish rule.[tpl]cite book|author=Great Britain.

Through spies within the Spanish garrison, MacGregor had learned that the force there consisted of only 55 regulars and 50 militia men. He spread rumors in the town which eventually reached the ear of the garrison commander that an army of more than 1,000 men was about to attack. On 29 June 1817, he advanced on the fort, deploying his men in small groups coming from various directions to give the impression of a larger force.Owsley and Smith 1997, p. 127 The commander, Francisco Morales, struck the Spanish flag and fled.[tpl]cite book|author=Pan American Institute of Geography and History|title=La República de las Floridas: texts and documents|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=j9h-AAAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 November 2012|year=1986|publisher=Pan American Institute of Geography and History|page=21[/tpl] MacGregor raised his flag, the "Green Cross of Florida", a green cross on a white ground, over the fort and proclaimed the "Republic of the Floridas".[tpl]cite book|author=John Quincy Adams|title=Writings of John Quincy Adams|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qVsSAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=23 November 2012|year=1916|publisher=The Macmillan Company|page=285[/tpl]

The French privateer Luis Aury sailed into the port of Fernandina on 17 September 1817. Following negotiations with Hubbard and Irwin, Amelia Island was dubiously annexed to the Republic of Mexico on 21 September 1817, and its flag raised over Fort San Carlos.Owsley and Smith 1997, p. 138  Aury surrendered the island to U.S. forces on 23 December 1817.British and Foreign State Papers 1837, p. 773

The settlers found only an untouched jungle, and a few American hermits who had made their homes there. The capital of "St. Joseph" consisted only of ruins of a previous attempt at settlement abandoned in the previous century.

While some of the labourers began to build rudimentary shelter for themselves, the officers and civil servants decided to try to find a way out. Lieutenant-Colonel Hector Hall, would-be-governor of Poyais, left to look for another ship to take them back to Britain.

Edward Codd, Superintendent for Belize, sent a warning to London, sending back any ships of would-be-settlers that were headed for Poyais. Those survivors who did not decide to remain in the Americas departed for London on August 1, 1823. More people died during that journey, and fewer than 50 came back alive to Britain.

==Poyaisian scheme in France==

In France, MacGregor contacted the trading organization Compagnie de la Nouvelle Neustrie and commissioned it to solicit more Poyaisian settlers and investors in France.[tpl]cite book|author=Serge Mam Lam Fouck|title=Regards sur l'histoire de la Caraïbe: des Guyanes aux Grandes Antilles|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KzUYAAAAYAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Ibis rouge éd.|isbn=978-2-84450-110-3|page=398[/tpl]
In March 1825 MacGregor summoned Gustavus Butler Hippisley, an acquaintance from the army, and appointed him a representative of Poyais in Colombia.[tpl]cite book|title=Bello Y Londres: Segundo Congreso Del Bicentenario|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ztNJAAAAYAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Fundación La Casa de Bello|page=374[/tpl] Hippisley was asked to write about the Poyais affair in France in "Acts of Oppression Committed under the Administration of m. de Villele, Prime minister of Charles X," from 1825 to 1826.[tpl]cite book|author1=Gustavus Butler Hippisley|author2=Gregor MacGregor|title=Acts of Oppression: Committed Under the Administration of M. de Villéle, Prime Minister of Charles X in the Years 1825-6. In a Series of Letters|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Yu3hGwAACAAJ|year=1831|publisher=Alfred Miller[/tpl] MacGregor told Hippisley that he needed the help of the French government to obtain a formal renunciation of any (in reality nonexistent) claims Spain might have to Poyais and that he had met with French Prime Minister Jean-Baptiste de Villele. MacGregor and la Nouvelle Neustrie already had plans to send French emigrants to Poyais. Hippisley wrote back to London, castigating the journalists who had called MacGregor a "penniless adventurer".Rodriguez 2006, p. 250
In August, MacGregor published a new constitution of Poyais; he had changed it into a republic with himself as the head of state. On August 18, 1825 he issued a £300,000 loan with 2.5% interest, through the London bank of Thomas Jenkins & Company.Narbeth Hendy 1979, p. 114 The bond was probably never issued. At the same time, la Nouvelle Neustrie recruited settlers to buy shares in the company.[tpl]cite book|author=Adrien Balbi|title=Abrégé de géographie, rédigé sur un nouveau plan|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=stwUAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA974|year=1833|pages=974–[/tpl]
When French officials noticed that a number of people had obtained passports in order to voyage to a country they had never heard of, they seized the la Nouvelle Neustrie vessel in Le Havre. The would-be-emigrants demanded an investigation; Hippisley was arrested, but MacGregor was nowhere to be found.[tpl]cite book|author=Kari Nars|title=Erschwindelte Milliarden|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cUlTEISuS6oC&pg=PA101|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|language=German|isbn=978-3-527-50616-3|page=101|quote=Macgregor selbst war untergetaucht.[/tpl]
Hippisley and MacGregor's secretary Thomas Irving were held in custody in La Force prison pending an investigation. Lehuby, one of the directors of la Nouvelle Neustrie, fled to Belgium, which was a part of the Netherlands at the time. MacGregor went into hiding until he was apprehended on December 7, 1825.[tpl]cite book|author=Françoise Albrecht|title=Une courtisane au debut du XIXe siècle: Biographie|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Sp8hAQAAIAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Université de Paris VII|language=French|page=64[/tpl] In January 1826, he made a proclamation to Central American states, written in French.

The trial began on 6 April 1826. MacGregor, Hippisley, Irving and Lehuby (in absentia) were accused of fraud based on the Poyais emigration program. The prosecutor was willing to drop the charges if the men were deported from France. Initially the court agreed, but changed its mind when the Netherlands agreed to extradite Lehuby.[tpl]cite book|author1=Nancy L.

The new trial began on July 10, 1826, and lasted for four days. MacGregor's lawyer eloquently put the blame on anybody else but MacGregor.

==Lesser Poyais schemes==

In 1826, MacGregor returned to London, where the furor over his affairs had died down. He continued peddling modified, watered-down versions of his old schemes: this time he claimed that the natives of the country had elected him as the head of state and that he was now simply "Cacique of the Republic of Poyais"; subsequently he opened an office at 23 Threadneedle Street,GroveMasson 1905, p. 349 without any diplomatic trappings. In mid-1827 he issued a loan worth £800,000 as 30-year bonds[tpl]cite book|title=The Banker|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kPcdAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Poyaisian%20Office%22|year=1982|publisher=Financial News Limited|page=73[/tpl] with Thomas Jenkins & Company as brokers. However, an anonymous handbill was circulated that warned against investing in "Poyais humbug".[tpl]cite book|author=POYAIS.|title=Loan of Two Hundred Thousand Pounds Sterling for the Service of the State and Government of Poyais Divided Into Special Bonds of £100 Each, and Secured by a General Mortgage Bond, of which the Following is a Copy. by a Single Sheet Lithographed, Headed: "Take Care of Your Pockets.

Other Poyais schemes were equally unsuccessful. In 1828, MacGregor tried to sell Poyaisian land for 5 shillings per acre, but Robert Charles Frederic, the brother of George Frederic, king of the indigenous Miskito people, began to sell those same territories to lumber companies,[tpl]cite book|author=Christian Brannstrom|title=Territories, Commodities and Knowledges: Latin American Environmental History in The Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XuNCAAAAYAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Brookings Institutio|isbn=978-1-900039-57-4|page=56[/tpl] with certificates that competed with MacGregor's.
