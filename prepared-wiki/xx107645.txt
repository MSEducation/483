For this assumption, that air resistance may be taken to be in direct proportion to the velocity of the particle is not correct for a typical projectile in air with a velocity above a few tens of meters/second, and so this equation should not be applied to that situation.
To show why k = 7/4 N·s/m above, first equate 4 m/s and 7 N:
For more on proportionality, see: Proportionality (mathematics)

The relationships that represent the motion of the particle are derived by Newton's Second Law, both in the x and y directions. 

And by integration we find:

Solving for our initial conditions:

With a bit of algebra to simplify (3a): 

An example is given using values for the mass and terminal velocity for a baseball taken from http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/airfri2.html#c3.

In fluid dynamics, drag (sometimes called air resistance or fluid resistance) refers to forces which act on a solid object in the direction of the relative fluid flow velocity.1 2 3 4 Unlike other resistive forces such as dry friction, which is nearly independent of velocity, drag forces depend on velocity.5
Drag forces always decrease fluid velocity relative to the solid object in the fluid's path.
