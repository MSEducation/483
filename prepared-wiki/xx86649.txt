==History==

The club has had a chequered history experiencing turbulent times and many name changes.
The club was formed by a series of mergers and name changes. Firstly, Lake United renamed themselves A.F.C. Cardiff in 1984. In 1990, they merged with Sully F.C to form Inter Cardiff FC. In 1996, the club was renamed Inter CableTel A.F.C. (after their sponsors), but reverted to Inter Cardiff FC in 1999.
Meanwhile, the team of Cardiff College of Education was developing (now University of Wales Institute, Cardiff). The team went through a series of name changes, mirroring the name changes of the institution it represented. The team was originally known as Cardiff College of Education F.C.. They became South Glamorgan Institute F.C. in 1979; Cardiff Institute of Higher Education F.C. in 1990 and UWIC in 1996.
In 2000, Inter Cardiff merged with Cardiff Metropolitan University (UWIC) to form UWIC Inter Cardiff F.C.. The team's nicknames by fans included The International, The Sheep (Wales is famous for its sheep) or The Div's (from Car-DIFF). The Seagull on the team's logo originated from the Sully connection (nicknamed 'The Seagulls'). They changed their name again in the summer of 2012 to Cardiff Metropolitan University F.C.
