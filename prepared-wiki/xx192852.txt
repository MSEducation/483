[[Glidos]]

CATEGORIES: DOS games, Emulation software, Simulation software

The word Glidos comes from the first part of the phrase "Glide API" and the word DOS. Paul Gardiner wrote this small Win9x/XP/Vista application to allow old games written for DOS using the 3dfx proprietary Glide driver to be played on and thus take advantage of the power in newer computer hardware.
Paul's initial concept started in 2001 as a way to run Core Design's Tomb Raider on modern hardware.
Also, for Tomb Raider, Glidos restores the original ambient soundtrack which was on the Sony PlayStation version but was not accessible on the PC version.
