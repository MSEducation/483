[[Iron(III) acetate]]

CATEGORIES: Acetates, Iron compounds, Coordination compounds

Ferric acetate is the coordination compound more commonly known as "basic iron acetate". With the formula Fe3O(OAc)6(H2O)3OAc (OAc is CH3CO2-), it is a salt, composed of the cation Fe3(μ3-O)(OAc)6(H2O)3+ and an acetate anion.J. Burgess, M. V. Twigg "Iron: Inorganic & Coordination Chemistry" Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry, R. Bruce King, Editor, J. Wiley, ISBN 978-0-470-86078-6  The formation of the red-brown complex has long been used as a test for ferric ions.H. Brearley, F. Ibbotson "The Analysis of Steel-Works Materials," 1902, Longmans, Green, &Co.: London.

==Structure and synthesis==

Basic iron acetate forms on treating aqueous solutions of iron(III) sources with acetate salts.Manual of Chemistry , W. Simon , p.474 google books link Solid Iron may be mixed with hydrogen peroxide to form Iron (II and/or III) Hydroxide, which may then be reacted with vinegar/acetic acid or acetate salts. 
Early work showed that it is trinuclear.R. Weinland and E. Gussmann, "Über Salze einer Hexaacetato(formiato)-trichrombase. II" Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft 1909, volume 42, 2997-3018). [tpl]DOI|10.1002/cber.19090420318[/tpl]. The Fe centres are equivalent, each being octahedral, being bound to six oxygen ligands, including a triply bridging oxide at the center of the equilateral triangle.Figgis, B. N.; Robertson, G. B. “Crystal-Molecular Structure and Magnetic Properties of Cr3(CH3.COO)6OCl.5H2O” Nature 1965, volume 205, pages 694-5. [tpl]doi|10.1038/205694a0[/tpl].  This paper describes the isostructure chromium and iron compounds.  The compound was an early example of a molecular compound of iron that features an oxide ligand.  Ignoring its 24 hydrogen centres, the cation has D3h symmetry.

==Reactions==

The terminal aqua ligands on the trimetallic framework can be substituted with other ligands, such as pyridine and dimethylformamide.  Many different salts are known by exchanging the anion, e.g. Fe3(μ3-O)(OAc)6(H2O)3Cl. Reduction of the cation affords the neutral mixed-valence derivative that contains one ferrous and two ferric centers. Mixed metal species are known such as Fe2CoO(OAc)6(H2O)3.Blake, A. B.

Iron(III) acetate (lacking the oxo ligand) has been claimed as a red coloured compound from the reaction of silver acetate and iron(III) chloride.Ram C. Paul, Ramesh C. Narula and Sham K.

==Uses==

Materials prepared by heating iron, acetic acid, and air, loosely described as basic iron acetates, are used as dyes and mordants.
