[[GeForce]]

CATEGORIES: Graphics processing units, Video cards, Nvidia

GeForce is a brand of graphics processing units (GPUs) designed by Nvidia.  [tpl]As of|2013[/tpl], there have been twelve iterations of the design.  The first GeForce products were discrete GPUs designed for use on add-on graphics boards, intended for the high-margin PC gaming market.  Later diversification of the product-line covered all tiers of the PC graphics market, from cost-sensitive, motherboard-integrated GPUs to mainstream, add-in, retail boards.  Most recently, GeForce technology has been introduced into Nvidia's line of embedded application processors, designed for electronic handhelds and mobile handsets.
With respect to discrete GPUs, found in add-in graphics-boards, Nvidia's GeForce and AMD's Radeon GPUs are the only remaining competitors in the high-end market. Along with its nearest competitor, the AMD Radeon, the GeForce architecture is moving toward GPGPU (General Purpose-Graphics Processor Unit). GPGPU is expected to expand GPU functionality beyond the traditional rasterization of 3D graphics, to turn it into a high-performance computing device able to execute arbitrary programming code in the same way a CPU does, but with different strengths (highly parallel execution of straightforward calculations) and weaknesses (worse performance for complex decision-making code).

==Name origin==

The "GeForce" name originated from a contest held by Nvidia in early 1999 called "Name That Chip". The company called out to the public to name the successor to the RIVA TNT2 line of graphics boards. There were over 12,000 entries received and 7 winners received a RIVA TNT2 Ultra graphics card as a reward.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nvidia.com/namingcontest | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20000608011648/http://www.nvidia.com/namingcontest | title=Winners of the Nvidia Naming Contest | year=1999 | work=Nvidia | archivedate=June 8, 2000 | accessdate=May 28, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last=Taken | first=Femme | url=http://tweakers.net/nieuws/1967/nVidia-Name-that-chip-contest.html | title=Nvidia "Name that chip" contest | work=Tweakers.net | date=April 17, 1999 | accessdate=May 28, 2007[/tpl]

==Generations==

==Variants==

===Mobile GPUs===

Since the GeForce2, Nvidia has produced a number of graphics chipsets for notebook computers under the GeForce Go branding. Most of the features present in the desktop counterparts are present in the mobile ones. These GPUs have a lower power consumption but perform worse than their desktop counterpart.
Beginning with the GeForce 8 series, the GeForce Go brand was discontinued and the mobile GPUs were integrated with the main line of GeForce GPUs, but their name suffixed with an M.

===Small form factor GPUs===

Similar to the mobile GPUs, Nvidia also released a few GPUs in "small form factor" format, for use in all-in-one desktops. These GPUs are suffixed with an S, similar to the M used for mobile products.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/sff.html|title=NVIDIA Small Form Factor|publisher=NVIDIA|accessdate=2014-02-03[/tpl]

===Integrated desktop motherboard GPUs===

Beginning with the nForce 4, Nvidia started including onboard graphics solutions in their motherboard chipsets. These onboard graphics solutions were called mGPUs (motherboard GPUs).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/main_mobo_gpus.html|title=NVIDIA Motherboard GPUs|publisher=NVIDIA|accessdate=2010-03-22[/tpl] Nvidia discontinued the nForce range, including these mGPUs, in 2009.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
After the nForce range was discontinued, Nvidia released their Ion line in 2009, which consisted of an Intel Atom CPU partnered with an low-end GeForce 9 series GPU, fixed on the motherboard. Nvidia released an upgraded Ion 2 in 2010, this time containing a low-end GeForce 300 series GPU.

==Nomenclature==

From the GeForce 4 series until the GeForce 9 series, the naming scheme below was used.
Since the release of the GeForce 100 series of GPUs, NVIDIA changed their product naming scheme to the one below.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/geforce_family.html |publisher=Nvidia |title=GeForce Graphics Cards |accessdate=July 7, 2012[/tpl]

==[tpl]Anchor|VOLTA[/tpl]Future==

After Maxwell, the next architecture is code-named Pascal.
After Pascal, the next architecture is code-named Volta.[tpl]cite web|url=http://techreport.com/news/26226/nvidia-pascal-to-use-stacked-memory-proprietary-nvlink-interconnect |title=Nvidia's Pascal to use stacked memory, proprietary NVLink interconnect |publisher=The Tech Report |date= |accessdate=2014-03-26[/tpl]
