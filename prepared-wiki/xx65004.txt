Chaupar is a board game very similar to Pachisi of the Cross and Circle family played in India. It is believed that both games were created around the 4th century. The board is made of wool or cloth. The dice can be six cowry shells, although others distinguish chaupur from pachisi by the use of 3 tetrahedral (four sided) dice.[tpl]cite book|last=Swiss Committee for UNICEF|title=Games of the World|year=1982|publisher=National Committees for UNICEF|pages=28â€“29[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The Rules of Pachisi|url=http://www.mastersgames.com/rules/pachisi-rules.htm|publisher=Masters Traditional Games|accessdate=2 September 2013[/tpl] The pawns are made of wood. It is usually played on a table or the floor.

==Style and Nature of Play==

This game is usually played in a banter style of fashion and it is quite common for opponents to diss each other's play just before the chori's are thrown. The best examples of these are to snort, crack knuckles, pretend to spit or make absurd noises to "curse" or spoil your opponents turn.
If any of the players does not have his "thore" (to have killed at least one pawn) by the end of the game, then that player is known to have lost with a "bay-thoree" which is the most disgraceful form of losing.

==Stories==

There are famous stories amongst Mughals past from generation to generation about kings who played this magnificent game. One particular tale tells of a King who had 2 trained mice called "Sundhree and Mundhreee". This king would distract his opponent with details stories and tales. He would then casually pronounce "Sundhree and Mundhree"; at this point the mice would come and move the pieces around without the opponent noticing.
Legend has it, that Mughal emperors would often play with real life guards as their pawns. If their pawn was killed, then that guard was beheaded. They also often played whilst wagering gold/jewels/women/guards.
