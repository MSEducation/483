Originally Hutchison Whampoa was two separate companies, both founded in the 19th century.  Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock was established in 1863, by British merchant John Duflon Hutchison, and Hutchison International was formed in 1877.Hutchison-Whampoa: Milestones 1828-1959 
In the 1960s, Hutchison International - under Colonel Sir Douglas Clague (1917–1981) - gained a controlling interest of Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock,Hutchison-Whampoa: Milestones 1960-1969 and in 1977 Hutchison acquired all of Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock, creating Hutchison Whampoa Limited. 
Although Hutchison Whampoa had a large portfolio of valuable real estate interests, in docks and retail ventures, the company eventually ran into trouble.  It was rescued by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, with HSBC taking a 22% stake in the company and ensuring that Clague was replaced.Stephen Vines, The Other Handover, Time magazine, 6 August 2005
