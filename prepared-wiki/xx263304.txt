Untermyer Park (also known as Untermyer Gardens, previously part of an estate known as Greystone) is a historic park of 43 acres, situated in Yonkers, Westchester County, New York, just north of New York City. Untermyer Park is on a hillside above the Hudson River and features a rock garden, a "Grecian garden" (actually a Persian Paradise garden), a small Grecian-style amphitheater, a classical pavilion, pergola, statuary, and a view of the river.
The Untermyer Gardens were developed during the first 40 years of the 20th century, when the area now enclosed by the park was part of an 150-acre site that was the estate of the lawyer and civic leader Samuel Untermyer.
Greystone had previously been owned by defeated Presidential candidate Samuel Tilden. Untermeyer purchased Greystone when Tilden died in 1899; when Untermyer himself died in 1940, his plan had been to donate the whole estate to the Nation, or the State of New York or at least to the City of Yonkers. Eventually the city of Yonkers agreed to accept part of the estate; this parcel of land, which was the core of the gardens, was renamed Untermyer Park in his honor.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.backyardgardener.com/ginsburg/column175.html |title=Untermyer park |accessdate=2007-01-11[/tpl] The Park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

==History==

The land that is now known as Untermyer Park was originally part of a large (150 acre) estate known as Greystone, which had first been put together in 1864 by John T. Waring, a hat manufacturer. In 1879 Waring sold the estate to Samuel J. Tilden (1814-1886).http://nynjctbotany.org/lgtofc/nyuntrmy.html Tilden died at Graystone on August 4, 1886.[tpl]Google books|TmbOZd4D-ccC|New York: A Guide to the Empire State (1940)|page=374[/tpl]
The 150-acre piece of land then was then purchased by, and became the estate of, lawyer and civic leader Samuel Untermyer (1858-1940). Untermyer developed elaborate gardens in the Beaux Arts style during the years 1899 to 1940, when he died. Untermyer had wished to give the gardens to the Nation, to New York State or failing that, to the City of Yonkers, but because of the great cost of the upkeep of the gardens, which were not accompanied by an endowment, the bequest was initially refused by all three bodies. Finally, in 1946, part of the land, the core of the gardens, was accepted as a gift by the City of Yonkers, and made into a public park.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10819|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration:Untermyer Park|date=December 1973|accessdate=2011-01-01 |author=Lynn Beebe Weaver|publisher=New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation[/tpl] See also: [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=10797|title=Accompanying six photos[/tpl]
The Park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. As of 2011, the Untermyer Gardens Conservancy, a non-profit, is working on restoring the gardens.http://www.untermyergardens.org
