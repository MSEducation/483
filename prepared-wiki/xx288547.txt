The 2014 United States House of Representatives elections in Kansas will be held on Tuesday, November 4, 2014 to elect the four U.S. Representatives from the state of Kansas, one from each of the state's four congressional districts. The elections will coincide with the elections of other federal and state offices, including the 2014 Kansas gubernatorial election.

==District 1==

Republican Tim Huelskamp has represented the district since being elected in 2010. Huelskamp was reelected in 2012 with 100% of the vote, as no candidate filed to run against him. Jim Sherow, city co-commissioner and former mayor of Manhattan, is running for the Democratic nomination, as is Bryan Whitney, a member of the 2013 class of Wichita State University. Whitney lives in Wichita, which is not located in District 1, but candidates in Kansas are not required to live in the district they are running to represent. Alan LaPolice, a former school administrator, will run in the Republican primaries.

==District 2==

Republican Lynn Jenkins has represented the district since being elected in 2008. Family law attorney Margie Wakefield is running for the Democratic nomination.[tpl]cite news|last=Hudson|first=Kion|title=A Kansas Democrat Is Throwing Her Hat Into The Congressional Ring|url=http://www.wibw.com/home/headlines/A-Kansas-Democrat-Is-Throwing-Her-Hat-Into-The-Ring-Against-Rep-Lynn-Jenkins--227011631.html|accessdate=11 October 2013|newspaper=WIBW|date=8 October 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Rothschild|first=Scott|title=Lawrence attorney Wakefield may challenge Jenkins in U.S. House race|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2013/jul/15/lawrence-attorney-wakefield-challenge-jenkins-us-h/|accessdate=11 October 2013|newspaper=Lawrence Journal-World|date=15 July 2013[/tpl]
