[[Pegasus Toroidal Experiment]]

CATEGORIES: Nuclear fusion, Tokamaks, Fusion power, University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison

The Pegasus Toroidal Experiment is a plasma confinement experiment relevant to fusion power production, run by the Department of Engineering Physics of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It is a spherical tokamak, a very low-aspect-ratio version of the tokamak configuration, i.e. the minor radius of the torus is comparable to the major radius.
