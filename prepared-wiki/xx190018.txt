CATEGORIES: 1997 albums, Air Supply albums

The Book Of Love is the fourteenth studio album by Australian soft rock band Air Supply, released in 1997. The album was a serious attempt for the band to penetrate the charts, mainly focusing on mature adult contemporary songs. Though the album didn't have any chart entries, the singles "So Much Love" and "When I Say" have gained critical acclaim in USA, although in Asia the single "Strong Strong Wind" was a big hit.
