==Plot introduction==

Central to the story is an artificial intelligence named H.A.R.L.I.E., also referred to by the proper name "HARLIE"â€”an acronym for Human Analog Replication, Lethetic Intelligence Engine (originally Human Analog Robot Life Input Equivalents).
HARLIE's story revolves around his relationship with David Auberson, the psychologist who is responsible for guiding HARLIE from childhood into adulthood.  It is also the story of HARLIE's fight against being turned off, and the philosophical question whether or not HARLIE is human; for that matter, what it means to be human.
When HARLIE Was One contains one of the first fictional representations of a computer virus (after Gregory Benford and John Brunner), and one of the first uses of the term "virus" to describe a program that infects another computer.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kernelthread.com/publications/security/viruses.html |title=A Taste of Computer Security |date= |accessdate=2010-11-04[/tpl]
