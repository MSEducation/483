On December 22, 2010, as a result of the Continental-United Airlines merger, the FAA approved the combination of Continental Micronesia's air carrier operations with Continental's under the single Part 121 operating certificate of Continental; although Continental Micronesia remained as a corporation, all flights were then operated directly by Continental Airlines. This step was intended to simplify future integration steps between Continental and United. The callsign, ICAO and IATA codes were changed to reflect the new operating certificate.

==Code data==

Continental Micronesia flights used the regular Continental "CO" code on ticketing systems and for frequent-flyer benefit accounting, but used its ICAO code "CMI" and callsign "Air Mike" with air traffic control authorities. In airport terminals, Continental Micronesia flights were listed separately (from Continental) with its IATA code "CS". During the final decade, three airports had both "Air Mike" and mainline Continental present: Hong Kong, Tokyo and Honolulu.

==History==

The airline was established by Continental and other regional shareholders in the former U.S. Trust Territory and started operations on May 16, 1968 as Air Micronesia,"GAO-10-778T Issues Raised by the Proposed Merger of United and Continental Airlines." Government Accountability Office. Page 4. Retrieved on October 7, 2010. hence the nickname and callsign "Air Mike".  Service was started with a Boeing 727-100, number 475, which was nicknamed "Ju-Ju," and a Douglas DC-6.  It also operated two Grumman SA-16/ HU-16 Albatross amphibians to fly from Chuuk (Truk) to Pohnpei (Ponape), until an airfield could be built that could accommodate the 727. The 727's underside was coated with teflon, due to it having to operate on coral runways.  Additionally, the plane had to carry spare parts and a mechanic, as well as open-water survival gear and (beginning in 1975) onboard doppler radar, then a rarity.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]
William H. Stewart of the Saipan Tribune stated that the airline's foundation "in particular" "was probably the single most important factor in the future development of what were once remote and isolated islands in the Pacific." Stewart added that the jets "distorted the traveler's impression of time and distance and brought the islands closer to major market areas in Asia."Stewart, William H. "The NMI's recent economic history." Saipan Tribune. Wednesday May 18, 2005. Retrieved on October 13, 2010. The airline had a virtual monopoly in the Micronesia region.Vergara, Jaime R.

In the 1970s, each district that the airline flew to had an entirely Micronesian employee base, with the exception of Saipan, which housed the airline's headquarters.International Organization and Conference Series, Issues 107-111. United States Department of State. Supt. of Docs., U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1972. 85. Retrieved from Google Books on October 14, 2010. "In each district, except Air Micronesia's headquarters at Saipan, all Air Micronesia employees are Micronesian." William H. Stewart of the Saipan Tribune said the airline "was the only travel link many had with the world beyond the horizon."Stewart, William H. "A different time and place." Saipan Tribune. Monday April 19, 2010. Retrieved on October 14, 2010.
In the early 1980s the airline started service from Guam to Japan. As Continental's share and roles in Air Mike changed, the airline's name became "Continental Air Micronesia."[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] Eventually, Continental owned 100% of Air Mike, which provided the only scheduled service directly between Guam and any point in the 50 United States (namely, to/from Honolulu, Hawaii).
Before being headquartered in Guam, Continental Micronesia was headquartered in Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands."World Airline Directory." Flight International. March 30, 1985. 47." Retrieved on June 17, 2009. "PO Box 298, Saipan, Mariana Islands 96950, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands." As time passed, the airline's Saipan traffic decreased due to the breakup of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, which was subdivided into smaller political units. Because of the breakup, fewer people needed to travel to Saipan, which was the capital of the trust territory.

By 2003 the Guam International Airport Authority moved commuter airlines out of Antonio B.

In 2008 Continental Micronesia generated profits. Chad Blair of the Pacific Business News said that the airline did so because it "nurtured" its "niche" Guam-Honolulu route. In addition Japanese tourists, wanting to save money, decided to travel to locations closer to Japan for vacation, so Continental Micronesia gained Japanese passengers. As of that year the airline's annual payroll in Guam was $90 million ($[tpl]inflation|USD|90000000|2008|r=2[/tpl] when adjusted for inflation).Blair, Chad.

"Thirty percent of the airline's business comes from its 4,300-mile island-hopper route, which begins in Honolulu, makes five stops and ends -- 14 hours and 10 minutes later -- in Hagatna, Guam's capital city."
A Houston Chronicle article in May 2008 stated that expected subsequent military buildup and population growth could lead to an expansion of Continental Micronesia flights to and from Guam.Hensel, Bill Jr. "TRANSPORTATION / Carrier stands to gain in Guam / Pacific island expects a population influx as military realigns its forces, and Continental's hub will be there to handle it."

However, on June 12, 2008, Continental's announcement of cuts of services, routes and destinations due to high fuel prices Continental Micronesia To Cut Flights To Bali, Hong Kong And Manila, Pacific Magazine Daily News, June 13, 2008 included termination of flights to Hong Kong (which has since resumed) and Bali. Also among the cuts is the termination of the Saipan-Manila flights on July 15 which is the last remaining Air Mike flight for Saipan, the airline's original hub 40 years ago.Deposa, Moneth G. Continental shuts down Saipan office." Marianas Variety News & Views. July 17, 2008. Retrieved on February 25, 2009. According to Jaime R. Vergara of the Saipan Tribune, the declared reason for the cancellation of the Saipan-Manila route was the fact that NCLEX tests were now available in Manila, so Filipino nurses no longer had to travel to Saipan to take the test. Before the flight's cancellation, the flight also served medical referrals from the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to Manila and non-USA visa alien contract workers who were unable to transit to their final destinations via Guam; Vergara said that the alien workers "particularly were Air Micronesia’s captive audience." With only Continental Connection/Cape Air services left, Continental closed its Saipan city ticket office on the same day.

==Destinations==

Beside providing transportation within Micronesia and between the region and the United States, Continental Micronesia flew to cities in Japan (the region's main source of tourists) and other Pacific Rim destinations.
The airline flew to nine Japanese cities, more than any other U.S. carrier."2007 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS." Continental Airlines. 1. Retrieved on June 16, 2010. The airline also operated a five stop "island-hopper" route between Honolulu and Guam. The [tpl]convert|4300|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] route had an average duration of 14 hours and 10 minutes. Due to the special requirements of the route, each aircraft flying on this route houses an extra pilot, an extra flight attendant, a mechanic, and extra spare parts in case of a mechanical failure. Historically the airline received little competition on the "island-hopper" route. Continental Micronesia provided the only scheduled jet service in the Federated States of Micronesia and Majuro, Marshall Islands. The airline's route network linked to the network of its parent company at Honolulu, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, and Newark.
Due to small island populations and the corresponding amount of passenger traffic, many of Continental Micronesia's routes were flown less than daily (some as infrequent as twice weekly). The only routes with daily flights were between Guam and Fukuoka, Honolulu, Manila, Nagoya, Palau, and Tokyo.

==Fleet==

As of early 2010, Continental Micronesia operated 12 Boeing 737 and 4 Boeing 767-400 aircraft (in Pacific Configuration) from Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport on Guam. The aircraft were all owned by Continental Airlines and were rotated to Continental Micronesia.Aircraft for Continental Micronesia
