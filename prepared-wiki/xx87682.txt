The railway past the site of Jacana station opened in 1872 as part of the North East railway to Wodonga.

The North East standard gauge line is to the west of the station, crossing the broad gauge suburban lines by a flyover at the northern end of the station. The Albion-Jacana freight line joins the main suburban line after the flyover, and the Western Ring Road passes under the station via a short tunnel.
