The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations  (or RANS equations) are time-averaged[ref]
equations of motion for fluid flow. The idea behind the equations is Reynolds decomposition, whereby an instantaneous quantity is decomposed into its time-averaged and fluctuating quantities, an idea first proposed by Osborne Reynolds.[ref]

A, v. 186, pp. 123-164. Available online from JSTOR.[/ref]  The RANS equations are primarily used to describe turbulent flows. These equations can be used with approximations based on knowledge of the properties of flow turbulence to give approximate time-averaged solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations.
For a stationary, incompressible Newtonian fluid, these equations can be written in Einstein notation as:

==Derivation of RANS equations==

The properties of Reynolds operators are useful in the derivation of the RANS equations.  Using these properties, the Navier–Stokes equations of motion, expressed in tensor notation, are (for an incompressible Newtonian fluid):
Next, each instantaneous quantity can be split into time-averaged and fluctuating components, and the resulting equation time-averaged,
[ref]
Splitting each instantaneous quantity into its averaged and fluctuating components yields,
Time-averaging these equations yields,
[/ref] to yield:
The momentum equation can also be written as,[ref]
This follows from the mass conservation equation which gives,
[/ref]
On further manipulations this yields,
where,
is the mean rate of strain tensor.
Finally, since integration in time removes the time dependence of the resultant terms, the time derivative must be eliminated, leaving:
