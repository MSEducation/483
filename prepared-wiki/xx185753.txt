[[CYP7B1]]

25-hydroxycholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase also known as oxysterol and steroid 7-alpha-hydroxylase is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the CYP7B1 gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Setchell KD, Schwarz M, O'Connell NC, Lund EG, Davis DL, Lathe R, Thompson HR, Weslie Tyson R, Sokol RJ, Russell DW | title = Identification of a new inborn error in bile acid synthesis: mutation of the oxysterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene causes severe neonatal liver disease | journal = J Clin Invest | volume = 102 | issue = 9 | pages = 1690–703 |date=Dec 1998 | pmid = 9802883 | pmc = 509117 | doi = 10.1172/JCI2962 [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = Tsaousidou MK, Ouahchi K, Warner TT, Yang Y, Simpson MA, Laing NG, Wilkinson PA, Madrid RE, Patel H, Hentati F, Patton MA, Hentati A, Lamont PJ, Siddique T, Crosby AH | title = Sequence alterations within CYP7B1 implicate defective cholesterol homeostasis in motor-neuron degeneration | journal = Am J Hum Genet | volume = 82 | issue = 2 | pages = 510–5 |date=Feb 2008 | pmid = 18252231 | pmc = 2426914 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.10.001 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: CYP7B1 cytochrome P450, family 7, subfamily B, polypeptide 1| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=9420| accessdate = [/tpl] This gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids.

==Function==

This endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein catalyzes the first reaction in the cholesterol catabolic pathway of extrahepatic tissues, which converts cholesterol to bile acids. This enzyme likely plays a minor role in total bile acid synthesis, but may also be involved in the development of atherosclerosis, neurosteroid metabolism and sex hormone synthesis.
CYP7B was discovered by Stapleton in a screen for transcripts expressed differentially in rat hippocampus versus the remainder of the brain. The encoded polypeptide, initially designated hct-1 (hippocampus transcript 1), had significant homology with CYP7A1.[tpl]cite journal | author = Stapleton G, Steel M, Richardson M, Mason JO, Rose KA, Morris RG, Lathe R | title = A novel cytochrome P450 expressed primarily in brain | journal = J.
