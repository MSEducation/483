At the 1904 Summer Olympics, five rowing events were contested.  The Olympics were held in St. Louis, United States, and all of the rowing competitors, save the Canadian men's eight, were from the United States. All competitions were held on Saturday, July 30, 1904.
It was the second appearance of the sport in Olympic competition.  Coxless forms of the pairs and fours were introduced, replacing the coxed pairs and fours that had been used 4 years earlier.  Sculling was expanded, with double sculls as well as singles.
