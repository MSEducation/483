==Intervention by invitation or on request==

When a State interferes in the political affairs of another State by invitation, or on request, it can not be considered as an unlawful act. Interference of a State can never be unlawful if it is for the sake of humanity. It is necessary that the two States agree on the matter of intervention through a treaty. A request for assistance is not an unlawful act.

==Kinds of Intervention==

Intervention can be done by various means, e.g. military, subversive, economic, or diplomatic.
