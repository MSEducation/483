[[Ornament and Crime]]

CATEGORIES: Modernism, 1910 essays

Ornament and Crime was first spoken in a lecture on 21 January 1910 in Vienna and first published in Cahiers d'aujourd'hui 5/1913Janet Stewart, Fashioning Vienna: Adolf Loos's Cultural Criticism, London: Routledge, 2000 by the influential and self-consciously "modern" Austrian architect Adolf Loos under the German title Ornament und Verbrechen. It was under this challenging title that in 1913 the essay was translated into French and did not appear in German until 1929:Janet Stewart, Fashioning Vienna: Adolf Loos's Cultural Criticism, London: Routledge, 2000, p. 173 "The evolution of culture marches with the elimination of ornament from useful objects", Loos proclaimed, linking the optimistic sense of the linear and upward progress of cultures with the contemporary vogue for applying evolution to cultural contexts.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2007[/tpl]  
In Loos's essay, "passion for smooth and precious surfaces"Studio International, 1973, Volume 186, Number 957, "Adolf Loos: the new vision" he explains his philosophy, describing how ornamentation can have the effect of causing objects to go out of style and thus become obsolete.  It struck him that it was a crime to waste the effort needed to add ornamentation, when the ornamentation would cause the object to soon go out of style.  Loos introduced a sense of the "immorality" of ornament, describing it as  "degenerate", its suppression as necessary for regulating modern society. He took as one of his examples the tattooing of the "Papuan" and the intense surface decorations of the objects about himâ€”Loos considered the Papuan not to have evolved to the moral and civilized circumstances of modern man, who, should he tattoo himself,  would either be considered a criminal or a degenerate.[tpl]cite book|author=Loos, A.|year=1908|title=Ornament and Crime|location=Innsbruck, reprint Vienna, 1930[/tpl]
The essay was written when Art Nouveau, which Loos had excoriated even at its height in 1900, was about to show a new way of modern art. The essay is important in articulating some moralizing views, inherited from the Arts and Crafts movement, which would be fundamental to the Bauhaus design studio and would help define the ideology of Modernism in architecture.
