The North Syracuse Central School District (NSCSD) is a public school district in Central New York, in the United States of America. 
The district is located in the heart of Central New York, just outside the city of Syracuse. A short drive provides access to malls, hospitals and health care, four-season recreation, and many cultural facilities. The area is also home to many institutions of higher education. The District serves the communities of North Syracuse, Clay, Cicero, Bridgeport, and Mattydale and includes 89 square miles, with approximately 56,000 residents.  
In July, 2013, Annette Speach became the Superintendent of Schools for the North Syracuse Central School District. Superintendent Annette Speach has worked for the North Syracuse Central School District since 1985, first as a special education teacher, then as an elementary school principal, director of human resources and most recently, as the assistant superintendent for educator effectiveness and human resources. She replaces Dr. Kim Dyce Faucette as Superintendent of Schools.
The North Syracuse Central School District is the largest of the Onondaga-Cortland-Madison (OCM) BOCES' 23 component school districts. As a component of the OCM BOCES, NSCSD participates in its career and technical, alternative and special education programs. 
The NSCSD has a comprehensive instructional program from pre-kindergarten through high school graduation provided in its eleven buildings. Its Early Education Program at Main Street School offers an inclusive preschool program for three and four year olds. Children with special needs participate in a child-centered and socially stimulating learning experience with their peers at the Main Street School. Instruction in its six elementary schools is centered around district established standards in the four core areas of English/language arts, science, math and social studies. Each elementary building follows its own technology plan designed to enhance instruction and learning. In addition to providing challenging curricula, our two middle schools offer many extra-curricular opportunities for students to explore learning, through an award winning rocket club, drug quiz teams and by being part of culturally diverse musical and theatrical performances. Programs at the high school level include advanced credit courses from colleges and universities, and Advanced Placement (AP) courses. 
Cicero-North Syracuse High School was ranked by Newsweek magazine as a top performing school in 2006 and 2010. Only the top six percent of high schools in the nation receive this recognition. In addition, the high school offers a vast array of elective opportunities for students to appeal to all interests. This includes a full production studio and a sophomore through senior year leadership development program. Many support services are available to students through Academic Intervention, school resource officers, social workers and counseling services.

The North Syracuse Central Schools District logo was redesigned in 1994. The district held a contest open to the community to design the new district logo. The current logo was designed by then Junior Joseph Byrns (class of 95) in a computer graphics course at Cicero-North Syracuse High School.
