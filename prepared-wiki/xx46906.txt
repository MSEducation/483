Charles Richard Drew (June 3, 1904 – April 1, 1950) was an American physician, surgeon, and medical researcher. He researched in the field of blood transfusions, developing improved techniques for blood storage, and applied his expert knowledge to developing large-scale blood banks early in World War II.  This allowed medics to save thousands of lives of the Allied forces.[tpl]cite press release | title=Patent For Preserving Blood Issued November 10, 1942; Washingtonian's invention made Washingtonian's invention madeblood bank possible | url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/speeches/01-52.htm | publisher=Brigid Quinn, United States Patent and Trademark Office | date=9 November 2001 | accessdate=2009-02-03[/tpl]  The research and development aspect of his blood storage work is disputed.Charles E. Wynes, Charles Richard Drew: The Man and the Myth (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), p. 58. As the most prominent African-American in the field, Drew protested against the practice of racial segregation in the donation of blood, as it lacked scientific foundation, an action which cost him his job.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl]

==Early years==

A few years later, Drew did graduate work at Columbia University, where he earned his Doctor of Medical Science degree, becoming the first African American to do so.

==Academic career==

In 1941, Drew's distinction in his profession was recognized when he became the first African American surgeon selected to serve as an examiner on the American Board of Surgery.[tpl]cite book | url = http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/BG/p-nid/339 |title = The Charles R.

Drew had a lengthy research and teaching career and became a chief surgeon.

==Blood Plasma for Great Britain Project==

In late 1940, before the US entered World War II and just after earning his doctorate, Drew was recruited by John Scudder to help set up and administer an early prototype program for blood storage and preservation.  He was to collect, test, and transport large quantities of blood plasma for distribution in Great Britain.[tpl]cite book | last=Starr | first=Douglas P. | title=Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce | location=New York | publisher=Quill | year=2000 | isbn=0-688-17649-6[/tpl] Drew went to New York to direct the United States' Blood for Britain project. The Blood for Britain project was a project to aid British soldiers and civilians by giving US blood to Great Britain.
Drew created a central location for the blood collection process where donors could go to give blood. He made sure all blood plasma was tested before it was shipped out. He ensured that only skilled personnel handled blood plasma to avoid the possibility of contamination. The Blood for Britain program operated successfully for five months, with total collections of almost 15,000 people donating blood, and with over 5,500 vials of blood plasma. As a result, the Blood Transfusion Betterment Association applauded Drew for his work. Out of his work came the American Red Cross Blood Bank.

==Death==

Beginning in 1939, Drew traveled to Tuskegee, Alabama to attend the annual free clinic at the John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital.[tpl]citation|title=Charles Drew: Pioneer in Medicine|author=Anne E. Schraff|year=2003|publisher=Enslow Publishing, Inc.[/tpl] For the 1950 Tuskegee clinic, Drew drove along with three other black physicians. Drew was driving around 8 a.m. on April 1. Still fatigued from spending the night before in the operating theater, Drew lost control of the vehicle. After careening into a field, the car somersaulted three times. The three other physicians suffered minor injuries. Drew was trapped with serious wounds; his foot had become wedged beneath the brake pedal. When reached by emergency technicians, Drew was in shock and barely alive due to severe leg injuries. Drew was taken to Alamance General Hospital in Burlington, North Carolina.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/question/june04.htm|title=Question of the Month: The Truth About the Death of Charles Drew|date=June 2004|publisher=Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia|accessdate=November 19, 2013[/tpl] He was pronounced dead a half hour after he first received medical attention. Drew's funeral was held on April 5, 1950, at the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church in Washington,DC.
Despite a popular myth to the contrary, once repeated on an episode of the hit TV series M*A*S*H, Drew's death was not the result of his having been refused medical care because of his skin color.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1092/did-the-black-doctor-who-invented-blood-plasma-die-because-white-doctors-wouldnt-treat-him|title=Did the black doctor who invented blood plasma die because white doctors wouldn't treat him?|date=November 1989|publisher=The Straight Dope|accessdate=February 18, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Wz-DTSXeLRYC&q=fluids#v=snippet&q=fluids&f=false |author=Patricia Carter Sluby|title=The Inventive Spirit of African Americans: Patented Ingenuity|pages=112–13|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|accessdate=February 18, 2014[/tpl]
