==Background==

As at 2003, it became difficult for the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) to provide quality education for its staff in the southwestern geopolitical zone. As a result, in 2004, the then-Inspector General of Police, Sunday Ehindero, decided, with the then-Force Education Officer, DCP Abayomi Akeremale, to convert the police training school at Itaogbolu into PSSA. This was done to improve the ease of education for every officer in the NPF.
