[[New Jersey Route 64]]

CATEGORIES: State highways in New Jersey, Transportation in Mercer County, New Jersey

Route 64 is a [tpl]convert|0.32|mi|km|adj=on[/tpl] long state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is a state-maintained bridge over Amtrak and New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor line in West Windsor. Route 64 begins at an intersection with County Route 526 and County Route 571 in West Windsor. It heads along the bridge to an intersection with County Route 615, where Route 64 ends. County routes 526 and 571, which are unofficially concurrent with Route 64, continues to Hightstown.
Route 64 was designated originally as an alignment of Route 31A, a spur off of State Highway Route 31 (currently U.S. Route 206) from Princeton eastward to Hightstown, where it met State Highway Route 33. The state planned on turning the alignment into a full-fledged expressway for several decades, including constructing the alignment that Route 64 currently uses in 1939. The route was amended in 1941, and was renumbered from Route 31A to Route 64 in the 1953 renumbering. Route 64 was proposed to become part of the Princeton–Hightstown Bypass (later designated New Jersey Route 92), but completion never occurred. Currently, the route remains the bridge over the Northeast Corridor. However, it is not currently planned that Route 64 will receive an extension of sorts from the proposed Penns Neck Bypass to U.S. Route 1, a proposed realignment of County routes 526 and 571.

From this point, County Routes 526 and 571 continue along the right-of-way towards U.S. Route 130. The route heads north crosses over the Amtrak and New Jersey Transit-used Northeast Corridor Line and passes to the north of a local bus depot.  Route 64 continues westward for a short distance, crossing through a local woodland and by several local homes. The route makes a gradual curve to the west off the railroad bridge and passes a couple of homes before heading to the south slightly at a jughandle. Route 64 reaches its northern terminus and County Route 526 and County Route 571 make a right turn to head northwest toward U.S. Route 1.[tpl]cite map|title=Bing Maps - Overview map of Route 64|publisher=Microsoft Inc.|url=http://www.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?q=Penns+Neck+NJ&mkt=en-US&FORM=BYFD#JnJ0cD1wb3MucXFrbm4zOHNmZ3M3X25lYXIrSGlnaHRzdG93bitSZCUyYytQcmluY2V0b24rSnVuY3Rpb24lMmMrTmV3K0plcnNleSswODU1MCUyYytVbml0ZWQrU3RhdGVzX19fZV8lN2Vwb3MucXFtMjN6OHNmNjdkX25lYXIrV2FzaGluZ3RvbitSZCslMjZhbXAlM2IrTWFqb3IrUmQlMmMrUHJpbmNldG9uK0p1bmN0aW9uJTJjK05ldytKZXJzZXkrMDg1NTAlMmMrVW5pdGVkK1N0YXRlc19fX2VfJnJ0b3A9MCU3ZTA=|accessdate=August 24, 2009|year=2009[/tpl]

==History==

===Route 31A and the original freeway===

In the late-1920s, the state proposed a bypass along the alignment.
In 1938, the New Jersey State Highway Department and New Jersey General Assembly put forth a proposal detailing that a highway from State Highway Route 31 (co-signed with U.S. Route 206) in the city of Princeton eastward through Mercer County onto current-day County Route 571. From there, it would follow an alignment of highway to the intersection with State Highway Route 33 in the community of Hightstown. The original proposal for the highway was to turn the road into a limited-access freeway along its entirety. The route was designated as State Highway Route 31A, a suffixed spur of State Highway Route 31 that year.[tpl]Cite book|title=ROUTE NO. 31A.

Beginning in State highway route No. 31 in or near Princeton, and thence to a point at or near Hightstown and connecting there with State highway route No. 33 eastwardly of Hightstown. |year=1941|publisher=New Jersey State Assembly[/tpl] 
The new bridge remained in place along Route 31A, however, no new portions of the freeway were constructed in terms of creating the Route 31A Freeway, as proposed in 1938. In 1950, then-governor of New Jersey, Alfred E. Driscoll, cited the need for the expressway as an important truck and passenger car highway from Trenton to the Jersey Shore.[tpl]Cite book|quote=My studies have very definitely indicated that it is unwise to expect city streets to bear the brunt of through, truck and passenger traffic. A continuous line of trucks, or, for that matter, passenger cars, bound from the Trenton area to the seashore, or desiring to get on the (New Jersey) Turnpike after it is completed, may constitute a (brick wall) "Chinese Wall" just as effectively as an underpass or overpass.|author=Alfred E. Driscoll|publisher=State of New Jersey|year=1950[/tpl] Route 31A itself was decommissioned in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, and replaced by the designation of Route 64.[tpl]Cite book|title=1953 renumbering|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1953_New_Jersey_state_highway_renumbering|publisher=New Jersey Department of Highways|accessdate=July 31, 2009[/tpl] The route was truncated from both ends toward Princeton and Hightstown, leaving just the bridge in West Windsor.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1953, Chapter 112, Page 1298, Section 1. Route 31A remained in the state highway statutes for several decades after decommissioning, with a bill in 1991 being proposed. The bill passed, and Route 31A was stripped from the statutes on January 18, 1992.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1991, Page 1298, Section 2.

===Route 92 and future changes to CR 571===

Route 64, after designation in 1953, remained a short bridge along the highway.[tpl]cite map|title=New Jersey|publisher=American Oil Company|year=1959|cartography=General Drafting Inc.[/tpl] However, the need for an expressway from Trenton to the Jersey Shore remained, and in the late 1950s, the State Highway Department brought about plans for the Princeton–Hightstown Bypass, a four-lane freeway that would head for [tpl]convert|14|mi|km[/tpl] from U.S. Route 206 in Montgomery Township to New Jersey Route 33 in Hightstown. In the length, the freeway was to interchange with U.S. Route 1, U.S. Route 130 and New Jersey Route 27. The route was re-designated as Route 92,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/history/expwy-map_metro/|title=Proposed Expressways in New York City|publisher=Regional Plan Association News|date=May 1964|accessdate=2009-09-09[/tpl] and remained a high priority project for several decades. Even after changes in alignment, Route 64 was still an alternative.[tpl]cite book|title=Public Hearing for Proposed Route 92 Freeway|publisher=New Jersey Department of Transportation|date=December 18, 1991|author=New Jersey State Legislature[/tpl] However, Route 92 was shelved on December 1, 2006 in favor of widening the New Jersey Turnpike mainline,[tpl]cite news|title=Turnpike Won't Add Toll Link to Route 1|date=December 2, 2006|publisher=The Asbury Park Press[/tpl] and only New Jersey Route 133 was constructed for the proposal.[tpl]cite news|title=Long Wait Is Over|last=Armone|first=Michael|date=December 1, 1999|publisher=The Trenton Times[/tpl]
As part of the proposed Penns Neck Bypass on U.S. Route 1, the New Jersey Department of Transportation plans on realigning County Route 571 and Route 526 from the western terminus of Route 64 to a northerly route to Route 1.[tpl]cite journal|last=University|first=Rutgers|year=2009|title=Route 1/Penns Neck Area Final Enivornmental Impact Statement|publisher=New Jersey Department of Transportation[/tpl] Although Route 571 and Route 526 are proposed to be realigned onto the new alignment, there is no designated change proposed for Route 64. On the contrary to this, one state figure shows Route 64 running along Washington Road, where the two county routes currently run.[tpl]cite journal|last=University|url=http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/works/studies/pennsneck/pdf/app_c_7_1.pdf|first=Rutgers|year=2009|title=Route 1/Penns Neck Area Final Enivornmental Impact Statement - Figure 7-1|publisher=New Jersey Department of Transportation|accessdate=August 24, 2009[/tpl]
