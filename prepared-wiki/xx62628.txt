Cranbrook was designated a National Historic Landmark on June 29, 1989 for its significant architecture and design. It attracts tourists from around the world."Michigan modern architecture a draw for travelers", denverpost.com, February 6, 2010Class syllabus, Architectural Association School of Architecture, London Approximately [tpl]convert|40|acre|m2[/tpl] of Cranbrook Schools' campus are gardens.

==History of Cranbrook Schools==

265px|left|thumb|The Quad in the Cranbrook CampusIn 1915, George and Ellen Booth opened a portion of their property to the general public with the construction of a small Greek Theatre. In 1918, the Booths built the Meeting House, which became the Bloomfield Hills School, opening for local children in 1922 (grades 1–12).
Subsequently the Booths decided to build a middle school and a college preparatory school. Cranbrook School for Boys, which began operations in 1927, was designed by world-renowned Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen.  Completed in 1928, it was Saarinen's first executed architectural work in the United States."How one man's bad luck paved way for creation of Cranbrook", Detroit News, January 14, 2002.  The name "Cranbrook" was chosen since Cranbrook, England was the birthplace of George Booth's father. Kingswood School Cranbrook (for girls), also designed by Saarinen, opened in 1931. Cranbrook and Kingswood enrolled students from grades 7–12. The Bloomfield Hills School became an elementary school and was renamed Brookside School Cranbrook in 1930.
Unlike the Cranbrook School for Boys, which has several buildings, the Kingswood School has only one building, which includes supporting facilities. It houses dormitories, a dining hall, an auditorium, classrooms, lounge/common areas, a bowling alley, and a ballroom. The education at Kingswood School Cranbrook was initially primarily viewed as a "finishing school".
For the Booths and Saarinen, the conception and design of the Cranbrook and Kingswood schools, were greatly influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, which began in 19th-century England.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.nps.gov/history/NR/travel/detroit/d1.htm|title= National Park Service, Itinerary, Register of Historical Places[/tpl]
In 1923, Booth founded an Episcopal church to serve the nascent Cranbrook community, as well as surrounding communities. He chose the firm of Goodhue Associates to design the church. Groundbreaking took place in 1925, and Christ Church Cranbrook was consecrated on September 29, 1928.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.christchurchcranbrook.org/history.html|title = History of Christ Church Cranbrook|publisher = Christ Church Cranbrook[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=March 2011[/tpl] Originally Cranbrook and Kingswood schools were affiliated with the Episcopal Church, but they have since secularized. However, special occasions are still celebrated at Christ Church Cranbrook.
Cranbrook School, Kingswood School, and Brookside School operated separately until 1970, when it was decided to govern them together. This was followed by the creation of the Cranbrook Educational Community. In 1985, Cranbrook and Kingswood schools were merged to create a co-educational upper school institution.
The middle school did not become co-educational; it was divided into gender-specific campuses in 1984. The Community acquired Vaughan School to house the boys' middle school. The basement of Kingswood was at one point the girls' middle school. A new Middle School building opened in 2010. For boys and girls of grades 6–8, all classes are separate. The exceptions are those for the performing arts (Symphonic Band, Orchestra, and Choir). English, religion, and history classes are taught separately to boys and girls through the 10th grade.
Architecture critic Paul Goldberger of the New York Times called the Cranbrook campus "one of the greatest campuses ever created anywhere".[tpl]cite web|url = http://schools.cranbrook.edu/flash/cranbrook_place.pdf |title = Cranbrook| format = PDF[/tpl]; Includes comments about the Cranbrook campus by architecture critic Paul Goldberger and Florence Knoll (class of 1934)[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/08/magazine/the-cranbrook-vision.html|author = Paul Goldberger|title = The Cranbrook Vision |publisher= The New York Times|date= 8 April 1984[/tpl]

==Cranbrook Schools today==

265px|right|thumb|Christ Church Cranbrook (1925–1928), by architect Bertram Goodhue In 1985, Cranbrook School and Kingswood School were merged to create a coeducational upper school, the Cranbrook Kingswood Upper School. While the majority of the classes are coeducational, Conceptual Physics and 9th and 10th grade English and History classes are taught separately to gender for educational purposes. Classes are taught on both of the original Cranbrook and Kingswood campuses.
Frequently, the school is referred to as "CK" by its students, faculty, and alumni. Cranbrook Kingswood now lays claim to 70 athletic teams, which have recently won state championships in hockey, tennis, lacrosse, and golf. As of 2011, there are 795 students, approximately 1/3 of which are boarding students who live in single-sex residence halls.
A college preparatory school, Cranbrook Kingswood offers a comprehensive program that includes 15 Advanced Placement courses in its upper school. More than a 1/3 of AP Scholars in Michigan attend Cranbrook Kingswood. Despite the fairly extensive AP offerings, the school still restricts students to a maximum of 3 AP courses per school year. Its graduates often matriculate into Ivy League schools and other highly regarded colleges and universities. Cranbrook Kingswood accepts slightly less than half of all applicants, placing it in the most selective 25% of preparatory schools in the United States.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.boardingschoolreview.com/lowest_acceptance_rates/sort/1|title = Boarding Schools ranked by their acceptance rates[/tpl]

Traditionally, Cranbrook School also has an exchange program with Cranbrook School, Kent, a boarding school in Cranbrook, Kent, England in honor of George Booth's heritage.
In spring 2009 the Cranbrook Educational Community announced that it had reached the 150 million dollar fundraising goal of its "Campaign for Cranbrook", which had been started in November 2006.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.campaignforcranbrook.org/page19.aspx |title=Campaign for Cranbrook website[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=March 2011[/tpl] Roughly $81 million of that money will go to the Cranbrook Schools.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.campaignforcranbrook.org/page20.aspx |title=Campaign for Cranbrook website[/tpl] [tpl]dead link|date=March 2011[/tpl]

===Iconography===

The Archer, the symbol of Cranbrook school, is based on an episode in Book V (Latin) of the Aeneid, by Virgil, line 519:
In an archery contest, a bird is tethered to a cord, and there are four archers. The first three in turn miss, then hit the bird, while the fourth, Acestes, instead shoots his arrow into the air, where it bursts into flames. For this miracle, Acestes is declared the victor.
The design was chosen by William Oliver Stevens, the first headmaster of Cranbrook School, who sketched it. The actual logo was designed by Eero Saarinen.[tpl]cite web |url=http://schools.cranbrook.edu/ftpimages/209/misc/misc_21139.pdf |author=W.
