[[Second Henderson Ministry]]

CATEGORIES: Northern Territory ministries

The Second Henderson Ministry was the 51st ministry of the Government of the Northern Territory. It came into operation on 18 August 2008, following the narrow re-election of the Henderson Labor government in the 2008 election. The government had suffered the defeat of three ministers at the election: Chris Natt, Len Kiely and Mathew Bonson. The three vacancies were notably filled by three indigenous MLAs, Malarndirri McCarthy, Alison Anderson and Karl Hampton.
The Ministry ended when the Henderson government was defeated at the 2012 Northern Territory election, and was succeeded by the Mills Ministry on 4 September 2012.
