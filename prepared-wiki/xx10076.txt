[tpl]Legend|#804000|Municipalities which had introduced Rumantsch Grischun, but have since decided to revert to a regional variety[/tpl]]]
A major change in policy came in 2003, when the Cantonal government proposed a number of spending cuts, including a proposal according to which new Romansh teaching materials would only be published in Rumantsch Grischun from 2006 onwards, the logical result of which would be to abolish the regional varieties as languages of instruction. The Cantonal parliament passed the measure in August 2003, even advancing the deadline to 2005. This decision was met by strong opposition, in particular in the Engadine, where teachers collected over 4,300 signatures opposing the measure,Coray (2008). p. 195 followed by a second petition signed by around 180 Romansh writers and cultural figures,Coray (2008). pp. 204 including many who were supportive of Rumantsch Grischun, but opposed its introduction as a language of instruction. Opponents argued that Romansh culture and identity was transmitted through the regional varieties and not through Rumantsch Grischun, and that Rumantsch Grischun would serve to weaken rather than strengthen Romansh, possibly leading to a switch to German-language schools and a swift Germanization of Romansh areas.Coray (2008). p. 195-196, 203
The Cantonal government refused to debate the issue again however, instead deciding on a three-step plan in December 2004 to introduce Rumantsch Grischun as the language of schooling, allowing the municipalities to choose when they would make the switch. The decision not to publish any new teaching materials in the regional varieties was not overturned however, raising the question of what would happen with those municipalities which would not want to introduce Rumantsch Grischun at all, as the language of schooling is decided by the municipalities themselves in Grisons.Coray (2008). p. 210 The teachers of the Engadine in particular were outraged over the decision, whereas those in the Surmeir were mostly satisfied. Few opinions were heard from the Surselva, which was interpreted either as support or resignation, depending in the viewpoint of the observer.Coray (2008). pp. 210-215
In the school year 2007/08, 23 so called "pioneer-municipalities" introduced Rumantsch Grischun as the language of instruction in 1st grade, followed by an additional 11 the following year, and another 6 in 2009/10. 41 other municipalities however, including the entire Engadine valley and most of the Surselva, continued to use their regional variety. The cantonal government aimed to introduce Rumantsch Grischun as the sole language of instruction in Romansh schools by 2020.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drs.ch/www/de/drs/streitpunkt-rumantsch-grischun/260253.208496.rumantsch-grischun-bis-2020-an-allen-romanischen-schulen.html |title=Rumantsch Grischun bis 2020 an allen romanischen Schulen | Schweizer Radio DRS |publisher=Drs.ch |date=2010-08-24 |accessdate=2013-06-08[/tpl] In early 2011 however, a group of opponents in the Surselva and the Engadine founded the association Pro Idioms, demanding the overturning of the government decision of 2003 and launching numerous local initiatives to return to the regional varieties as the language of instruction. In April 2011, Riein became the first municipality to vote to return to teaching in Sursilvan,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drs.ch/www/de/drs/streitpunkt-rumantsch-grischun/260253.280276.riein-sursilvan-soll-zurueck-an-die-schule.html |title=Riein: Sursilvan soll zurück an die Schule | Schweizer Radio DRS |publisher=Drs.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-06-08[/tpl] followed by an additional 4 in December, and a further 10 in early 2012, including Val Müstair, which had been the first to introduce Rumantsch Grischun. As of September 2013, all municipalities in the Surselva with the exception of Pitasch have decided to return to teaching in Sursilvan.
Supporters of Rumantsch Grischun then announced that they would take the issue to the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.tagesschau.sf.tv/Hintergrund/Abstimmungen/Abstimmung-vom-11.-Maerz-2012/Muenstertal-GR |title=News - Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen |language=[tpl]de icon[/tpl] |publisher=Tagesschau.sf.tv |date=2010-11-30 |accessdate=2013-06-08[/tpl] as well as announcing their intention to launch a Cantonal referendum to enshrine Rumantsch Grischun as the language of instruction.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bote.ch/politik/pro-idioms-blickt-auf-erfolgsjahr-zurueck |title=Pro Idioms blickt auf Erfolgsjahr zurück | Bote der Urschweiz |publisher=Bote.ch |date=2012-06-14 |accessdate=2013-06-08[/tpl] The Lia Rumantscha opposes these moves and now supports a model of coexistence, where Rumantsch Grischun will supplement but not replace the regional varieties in school, citing the need for keeping the language peace among Romansh speakers, as the decades-long debate over the issue has according to them torn friends and even families apart.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.drs.ch/www/de/drs/streitpunkt-rumantsch-grischun/260253.305619.moegliche-wende-im-streit-um-rumantsch.html |title=Mögliche Wende im Streit um Rumantsch | Schweizer Radio DRS |publisher=Drs.ch |date=2011-11-16 |accessdate=2013-06-08[/tpl] The parliament of Grisons has also overturned its 2003 decision in December 2011, meaning that the Canton will again finance school books in the regional varieties.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.suedostschweiz.ch/politik/ruckschlag-fur-rumantsch-grischun-den-volksschulen |title=Rückschlag für Rumantsch Grischun an den Volksschulen | Mein Regionalportal |publisher=Suedostschweiz.ch |date=2012-10-08 |accessdate=2013-06-08[/tpl]
Rumantsch Grischun is still a project in progress.Cathomas (2012). pp. 47-58  At the start of 2014, it is in use as a school language in the central part of Canton Graubünden and in the bilingual classes in the region of Chur. It is taught in upper-secondary schools, in the university of teacher education in Chur and used at the universities of Zurich and Fribourg, along with the Romansh idioms. It remains an official and administrative language in the Swiss Confederation and Canton Graubünden, as well as in public and private institutions, for all kinds of texts intended for the whole Romansh-speaking territory. Rumantsch Grischun is read in the news of Radiotelevisiun Svizra Rumantscha and written in the daily newspaper “La Quotidiana”, along with the Romansh idioms. Thanks to many new texts in a wide variety of political and social functions, the Romansh vocabulary has been decisively broadened. The “Pledari Grond”http://www.pledarigrond.ch dictionary with more than 215 000 entries German ⇿ Rumantsch Grischun is the most comprehensive collection of Romansh words, which can also be used in the idioms with the necessary phonetic shifts. The signatories of “Pro Rumantsch”http://www.prorumantsch.ch stress that Romansh needs both the idioms and Rumantsch Grischun, if it is to improve its chances in today’s communication society.

==History==

===Origins and development until modern times===

Romansh originates from the spoken Latin brought to the region by Roman soldiers, merchants, and officials following the conquest of the modern-day Grisons area by the Romans in 15 BC. Before that, the inhabitants spoke Celtic and Raetic languages, with Raetic apparently being spoken mainly in the Lower Engadine valley. Traces of these languages survive mainly in toponyms, such as the names of villages such as Tschlin, Scuol, Savognin, Glion, Breil/Brigels, Brienz/Brinzauls, Purtenza, or Trun. Additionally, a small number of pre-Latin words have survived in Romansh, mainly concerning animals, plants, or geological features unique to the alps such as camutsch 'chamois' or grava 'scree'.
