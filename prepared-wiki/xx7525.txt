CATEGORIES: Foreign relations of Malaysia, Malaysia and the Commonwealth of Nations, Political history of Malaysia

Malaysia is an active member of various international organisations, including the Commonwealth of Nations, the United Nations, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and the Non-Aligned Movement. It has also in recent times been an active proponent of regional co-operation.

==Foreign policy 1957–1969==

Malaysia has been a member of the Commonwealth since independence in 1957, when it entered into the Anglo-Malayan Defence Agreement (AMDA) with the United Kingdom whereby Britain guaranteed the defence of Malaya (and later Malaysia). The presence of British and other Commonwealth troops were crucial to Malaysia's security during the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960) and the Indonesian Confrontation (1962–1966), which was sparked by Malaya's merger with the British colonies of Singapore, Sarawak and North Borneo to form Malaysia in 1963.
The British defence guarantee ended following Britain's decision in 1967 to withdraw its forces east of Suez, and was replaced in 1971 with the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) by which Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore agreed to co-operate in the area of defence, and to "consult" in the event of external aggression or the threat of attack on Malaysia or Singapore. The FPDA continues to operate, and the Five Powers have a permanent Integrated Area Defence System based at RMAF Butterworth, and organise annual naval and air exercises.
Under the leadership of Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman (up to 1970), Malaysia pursued a strongly pro-Commonwealth anti-communist foreign policy. Nonetheless, Malaysia was active in the opposition to apartheid that saw South Africa quit the Commonwealth in 1961, and was a founding member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 1967 and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in 1969, with the Tunku as its first Secretary-General in 1971.

==Foreign policy since 1969==

Under Prime Ministers Tun Abdul Razak and Tun Hussein Onn, Malaysia shifted its policy towards non-alignment and neutrality. Malaysia's foreign policy is officially based on the principle of neutrality and maintaining peaceful relations with all countries, regardless of their ideology or political system, and to further develop relations with other countries in the region.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.kln.gov.my/web/guest/foreign_policy | title = Malaysia's Foreign Policy | accessdate = 21 September 2010 | work = Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Malaysia)[/tpl] In 1971, ASEAN issued its neutralist and anti-nuclear Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality (ZOPFAN) Declaration. In the same year, Malaysia joined the Non-Aligned Movement. Consistent with this policy Malaysia established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1974.
This policy shift was continued and strengthened by Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad, who pursued a regionalist and pro-South policy with at times strident anti-Western rhetoric. He long sought to establish an East Asian Economic Group as an alternative to APEC, excluding Australia, New Zealand and the Americas, and during his premiership Malaysia signed up to an ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and ASEAN+3, a regional forum with China, Japan and South Korea. He was involved with a spat with Australian prime minister Paul Keating, who called him a "recalcitrant" after he refused to attend the APEC summit in Seattle.
A strong tenant of Malaysia's policy is national sovereignty and the right of a country to control its domestic affairs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/malaysia/malaysia_brief.html |title=Malaysia country brief |publisher=dfat.gov.au |date=October 2010 |accessdate=19 February 2011[/tpl]
Malaysia views regional cooperation as the cornerstone of its foreign policy. It attaches a high priority to the security and stability of Southeast Asia, and has tried to strengthen relations with other Islamic states.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.asean.fta.govt.nz/malaysia-foreign-relations |title=Malaysia Foreign Relations | ASEAN – Australia – New Zealand Free Trade Agreement |publisher=Asean.fta.govt.nz |date=4 December 2008 |accessdate=18 September 2010[/tpl] Malaysia was a leading advocate of expanding ASEAN's membership to include Laos, Vietnam, and Burma, arguing that "constructive engagement" with these countries, especially Burma, will help bring political and economic changes. Malaysia is also a member of G-15 and G-77 economic groupings.
Despite Mahathir's frequently anti-Western rhetoric he worked closely with Western countries, and led a crackdown against Islamic fundamentalists after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Under his successor, Abdullah Badawi, relations with Western countries, particularly Australia, have improved. The current Minister of Foreign Affairs is Datuk Seri Anifah Aman, who assumed office on 18 March 2008.
Malaysia has never recognised Israel and has no diplomatic ties with the state.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=3&DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=111&FID=624&PID=0&IID=1639&TTL=Malaysia:_Anti-Semitism_without_Jews |title=Malaysia: Anti-Semitism without Jews |publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs |accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl] It has remained a strong supporter of Palestine,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/MalaysiacanbeMuslim_thoughtleader_--Clinton/Article/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110622053918/http://www.nst.com.my/nst/articles/MalaysiacanbeMuslim_thoughtleader_--Clinton/Article/|archivedate=22 June 2011|title=Malaysia can be Muslim 'thought leader' – Clinton|work=New Straits Times|accessdate=15 November 2010[/tpl] and has called for Israel to be taken to the International Criminal Court over the Gaza flotilla raid.[tpl]cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2010/6/7/nation/20100607121340&sec=nation|title=Malaysia wants Israel referred to International Criminal Court (Updated)|author=Lee Yuk Peng|work=The Star|date=7 June 2010|accessdate=21 May 2011|archiveurl=http://archive.is/4QZg|archivedate=17 July 2012|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Malaysian peacekeeping forces are present in Lebanon[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/analisis/1054/1054_Ayala_Peacekeeping_Lebanon.pdf|title=Peacekeeping in Lebanon: A Necessary but Insufficient Risk|quote=Bangladesh has offered 1,500; Indonesia, 1,000; Malaysia, 1,000; and Nepal, 850.

Malaysia is affiliated with the United Nations and many of its specialised agencies, including UNESCO, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, International Atomic Energy Agency; General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It is also a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Developing 8 Countries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/members/list.shtml |title=List of Member States |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=8 November 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.apec.org/apec/member_economies.html|title=Member Economies|publisher=Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|accessdate=5 September 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.developing8.org/countries/malaysia/|title=Malaysia|publisher=Developing 8 Countries|accessdate=21 June 2010[/tpl] Asian Development Bank, Five-Power Defense Arrangement, and South Centre.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl] On 31 October 2011 Malaysia became a party to the Antarctic Treaty.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ats.aq/devAS/ats_parties.aspx?lang=e |title=Parties |publisher=Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty |accessdate=18 November 2011[/tpl]

==International disputes==

The policy towards territorial disputes by the Malaysian government is one of pragmatism, solving disputes in a number of ways, including some resolved in the International Court of Justice.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.academicjournals.org/jlcr/abstracts/abstracts/abstract2009/Oct/Salleh%20et%20al.htm |title=Malaysia's policy towards its 1963–2008 territorial disputes |publisher=Academicjournals.org |date=7 September 2009 |accessdate=1 October 2010[/tpl]

===Spratly Islands===

Malaysia has asserted sovereignty over the Spratly Islands together with China, the Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Brunei. Tensions have eased since the 2002 "Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea". However, it is not the legally binding code of conduct sought by some parties.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2070.html |title=FIELD LISTING :: DISPUTES – INTERNATIONAL |publisher=CIA |accessdate=26 October 2010[/tpl] Malaysia was not party to a March 2005 joint accord among the national oil companies of China, the Philippines and Vietnam on conducting marine seismic activities in the Spratly Islands.

===Ligitan, Sipadan and Ambalat===

ICJ awarded Ligitan and Sipadan islands, also claimed by Indonesia and Philippines, to Malaysia but left the maritime boundary in the hydrocarbon-rich Celebes Sea in dispute, culminating in hostile confrontations in March 2005 over concessions to the Ambalat oil block.

===Singapore===

Singapore was a part of Malaysia for two years (1963–65), but it ultimately was asked by Tunku to secede after increased racial tensions due to the election campaigns in 1964. Today, disputes continue among other things, over the pricing of deliveries of raw untreated water to Singapore, Singapore's land reclamation causing a negative environmental impact in Malaysian waters, a new bridge to replace the Johor-Singapore Causeway which Singapore does not want to pay for, maritime boundaries, the redevelopment of Malayan Railway lands in Singapore and Pedra Branca. Both parties however, agreed to ICJ arbitration on the island dispute. On 24 May 2008, the International Court of Justice ruled that Pedra Branca belonged to Singapore with the nearby Middle Rocks going to Malaysia. Regarding railway land in Singapore, see also Malaysia-Singapore Points of Agreement of 1990. On introducing budget flights between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, the stumbling block appears to be Malaysia's sympathy towards flag carrier Malaysia Airlines, and preference for the existing near duopoly with Singapore Airlines.

===The Philippines===

The Philippines has a dormant claim to eastern Sabah.

===Brunei===

Malaysia's land boundary with Brunei around Limbang is no longer in dispute. On 16 March 2009, Brunei announced its decision to drop a long-standing claim to Sarawak's Limbang district. This was the result of the two countries resolving their various land and sea territorial disputes. This issue was resolved along with several other disputes with the sealing and signing of letters of exchange by Abdullah and the Sultan Hasannal Bolkiah of Brunei at Istana Nurul Iman. As of 2010 the two countries are working towards resolving disputes over their maritime boundaries.
