[[Racks and quandles]]

CATEGORIES: Knot theory, Algebraic structures

In mathematics, racks and quandles are sets with binary operations satisfying axioms analogous to the Reidemeister moves used to manipulate knot diagrams.
While mainly used to obtain invariants of knots, they can be viewed as algebraic constructions in their own right.  In particular, the definition of a quandle axiomatizes the properties of conjugation in a group.

==History==

In 1943, Mituhisa Takasaki introduced an algebraic structure which he called a Kei, which would later come to be known as an involutive quandle.[tpl]cite journal|first=Mituhisa |last=Takasaki| title=Abstractions of symmetric functions|year=1943|journal=Tohoku Mathematical Journal|volume=49|pages=143–207[/tpl] His motivation was to find a nonassociative algebraic structure to capture the notion of a reflection in the context of finite geometry. The idea was rediscovered and generalized in (unpublished) 1959 correspondence between John Conway and Gavin Wraith,[tpl]Cite journal|first1=John H.|last1=Conway|first2=Gavin|last2=Wraith|title=(unpublished correspondence)|year=1959|postscript=[tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][/tpl] who at the time were undergraduate students at the University of Cambridge. It is here that the modern definitions of quandles and of racks first appear. Wraith had become interested in these structures (which he initially dubbed sequentials) while at school.[tpl]cite web|first=Gavin|last=Wraith|title=A Personal Story about Knots|url=http://www.wra1th.plus.com/gcw/rants/math/Rack.html[/tpl]  Conway renamed them wracks, partly as a pun on his colleague's name, and partly because they arise as the remnants (or 'wrack and ruin') of a group when one discards the multiplicative structure and considers only the conjugation structure.  The spelling 'rack' has now become prevalent.
These constructs surfaced again in the 1980s:  in a 1982 paper by David Joyce[tpl]cite journal|first=David|last=Joyce|title=A classifying invariant of knots: the knot quandle|journal=Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra|volume=23|year=1982|pages=37–65|doi=10.1016/0022-4049(82)90077-9[/tpl] (where the term quandle was coined), in a 1982 paper by Sergei Matveev (under the name distributive groupoids)[tpl]cite journal|first=Sergei|last=Matveev|title=Distributive groupoids in knot theory|journal=Math. USSR Sbornik|volume=47|year=1984|pages=73–83|doi=10.1070/SM1984v047n01ABEH002630[/tpl] and in a 1986 conference paper by Egbert Brieskorn (where they were called automorphic sets).[tpl]cite journal|first=Egbert|last=Brieskorn|title=Automorphic sets and singularities|journal=In "Braids (Santa Cruz, CA, 1986)", Contemporary Mathematics|volume=78|year=1988|pages=45–115[/tpl]  A detailed overview of racks and their applications in knot theory may be found in the paper by Colin Rourke and Roger Fenn.[tpl]cite journal|first2=Roger|last2=Fenn|first1=Colin|last1=Rourke|journal=Journal of Knot Theory and Its Ramifications|title=Racks and links in codimension 2|volume=1|year=1992|pages=343–406|doi=10.1142/S0218216592000203|issue=4[/tpl]

==Racks==

A rack may be defined as a
This definition, while terse and commonly used, is suboptimal for certain purposes because it contains an existential quantifier which is not really necessary. To avoid this,

while many others write
Yet another equivalent definition of a rack is that it is a set where each element acts on the left and right as automorphisms of the rack, with the left action being the inverse of the right one.  In this definition, the fact that each element acts as automorphisms encodes the left and right self-distributivity laws, and also these laws:
which are consequences of the definition(s) given earlier.

==Examples and Applications==

Every group gives a quandle where the operations come from conjugation:
In fact, every equational law satisfied by conjugation in a group follows from the quandle axioms.  So, one can think of a quandle as what is left of a group when we forget multiplication, the identity, and inverses, and only remember the operation of conjugation.
Every tame knot in three-dimensional Euclidean space has a 'fundamental quandle'.  To define this, one can note that the fundamental group of the knot complement, or knot group, has a presentation (the Wirtinger presentation) in which the relations only involve conjugation.  So, this presentation can also be used as a presentation of a quandle.  The fundamental quandle is a very powerful invariant of knots.  In particular, if two knots have isomorphic fundamental quandles then there is a homeomorphism of three-dimensional Euclidean space, which may be orientation reversing, taking one knot to the other.
Racks are a useful generalization of quandles in topology, since while quandles can represent knots on a round linear object (such as rope or a thread), racks can represent ribbons, which may be twisted as well as knotted.
