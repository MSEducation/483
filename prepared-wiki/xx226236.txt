The Delilah missile is a cruise missile developed in Israel by Israel Military Industries (IMI). The missile is designed to target moving and re-locatable targets with a CEP of [tpl]convert|1|m[/tpl]. Unlike a typical cruise missile, which is locked onto a pre-programmed target prior to launch, the Delilah missile is touted by the Israeli military as being able to "patrol" and surveil an area before a remote navigator identifies the specific target of the attack.http://www.idfblog.com/2012/01/19/5-more-incredible-technologies-used-by-the-idf/

==Overview==

The name Delilah had been used by an anti-radiation attack drone configured after the US MQM-74 Chukar aerial target. It entered service in IAF in the mid-1980s. This air-launched drone identifies radar sites, allowing them to be found and destroyed. The Delilah missile is the name of a missile familybuilt by IMI. Delilah was initially created as an aerial decoy, and was later developed into an offensive strike weapon in the 1990s used by Israeli F-16 and upgraded F-4E attack aircraft. It can be used as multi platformed and against multi target. Such as AS; Air to surface, SS ; Surface to surface, AtoA ; Air to air and SA ; Surface to air. Targeting ground targets, vehicles and sea vessels stable and / or moving. Can be classified as MRMPGM ; Medium Range, Multi Purpose Guided Missile as All in One. Combat Proven in Lebanon by Israeli Forces.
The Delilah is an air-launched stand-off missile and cruise missile with a range of 250km and can be fitted with a variety of warheads which can be targeted on both land and sea targets. It has a turbo jet engine that is able to loiter, allowing it to target well-hidden threats in addition to moving targets. This maneuverability makes the missile ideal for destroying Surface-to-air missile threats.  The onboard autopilot and INS/GPS navigation system allows the missile to perform its mission autonomously.  
A data link enables intervention and target validation. The Delilah missile was first used in combat by Israel over Lebanon in July and August 2006 and launched by F-16D fighter aircraft. The missile can be fired from most aircraft, helicopters, or ground launchers. Its compact dimensions allow it to be carried by the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk and SH-60B helicopters. It carries a small but effective warhead  to destroy the target with minimal collateral damage.
