MoSync is a free and open source software development kit (SDK) for mobile applications. It is integrated with the Eclipse development environment, and is provided under a dual license scheme; a commercial license and an open source GPL version 2 license.  However, note that the MoSync SDK https://github.com/MoSync/MoSync has been re-licensed to Apache License 2.0 since 26 August 2013.  The framework produces native mobile applications for multiple platforms using C/C++, HTML5 scripting and any combination thereof. The target group for MoSync are both web developers looking to enter the mobile space, as well as the ordinary PC/Mac desktop developer with knowledge in C/C++ development.
MoSync was developed by the Swedish software company MoSync AB (formerly Mobile Sorcery AB). The first version of the product was launched in early 2005 with support for the Java ME platform. Support for several other mobile development platforms has been added since. MoSync AB filed for bankruptcy in July 2013.http://www.allabolag.se/5566727045/verksamhet Allabolag.se - MoSync AB

It is also possible to run emulators from other SDKs, such as Android and iOS emulators ensuring that elements native to each OS has the right look Â´n feel in their respective environments.

==Wormhole technology==

Introduced in MoSync SDK 2.7 Pyramid is a technology called Wormhole, which creates a hook which connects javascript calls to MoSync's underlying C APIs, thereby allowing the developer to the functionality of the webview. Currently this functionality is available for Android, Windows Phone, and iOS, while other platforms could be added in future versions, due to the cross-platform nature of the MoSync SDK.
