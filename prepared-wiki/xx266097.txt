The College of Medicine (CoM) is a United Kingdom based organisation founded in 2010 for patients and healthcare professionals. It originated from the collapse of the Prince of Wales' controversial Foundation for Integrated Health, which was widely criticised for promoting integrated medicine and alternative medicine.[tpl]cite news | title=Prince’s foundation metamorphoses into new College of Medicine | author=Nigel Hawkes | publisher=British Medical Journal | year=2010 | volume=341 | page=6126 | doi=10.1136/bmj.c6126|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6126.full[/tpl] The College states that it aims to "promote a more politically and professionally transparent, patient centred, and sustainable approach to healthcare, using whatever social or therapeutic approaches are safe, effective, and empowering for patients".[tpl]cite journal | journal=British Medical Journal | url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4364.extract?sid=66683c7f-e8ba-4245-954b-0ebfbb090ea4 | authors=George T Lewith, Graeme Catto, Michael Dixon, Christine Glover, Aidan Halligan, Ian Kennedy, Christopher Manning, David Peters | title=College of Medicine replies to its critics | date=12 July 2011 | volume=343 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d4364 | pmid=21750060[/tpl]
It argues that a greater focus on compassionate caring is necessary because of the frequency of National Health Service scandals about care, such as the Stafford Hospital scandal.

Several commentators writing in the Guardian and the British Medical Journal, have expressed the opinion that the new organisation is simply a re-branding of the Prince's Foundation,[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/02/prince-charles-college-medicine-holistic-complementary |title=College of Medicine born from ashes of Prince Charles's holistic health charity |author=Ian Sample |publisher=The Guardian |date=August 2, 2010 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/jan/10/college-medicine-lobby-group-unproven |title=College of Medicine is a lobby group promoting unproven treatments |author=Edzard Ernst |publisher=The Guardian |date=10 January 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | journal=British Medical Journal | volume=343 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d3712 | date=15 June 2011 | title=Lobby Watch: The College of Medicine | author=Jane Cassidy | url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d3712.full | pmid=21677014[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | journal=British Medical Journal | volume=343 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d4368 | date=12 July 2011 | title=The College of Medicine is Prince’s Foundation reincarnated  | author=David Colquhoun | url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4368.full | pmid=21750061[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | journal=British Medical Journal | volume=343 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d4372 | date=12 July 2011 | title=College of Medicine: What is integrative health? | author=James May | url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4372.full | pmid=21750063[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | journal=British Medical Journal | volume=343 | doi=10.1136/bmj.d4370 | date=12 July 2011 | title=College of Medicine or College of Quackery? | author=Edzard Ernst | url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4370.full | pmid=21750062[/tpl] describing it as "Hamlet without the Prince".
In support of this connection with Prince Charles, alternative medicine critic and pharmacologist David Colquhoun has argued that the College (originally called "The College of Integrated Health") is extremely well-funded[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263 | title=Buckinghamgate: the new "College of Medicine" arising from the ashes of the Prince’s Foundation for Integrated Health | date=July 25, 2010 | author=David Colquhoun | publisher=DC's Improbable Science[/tpl] and seemed from the beginning to be very confident of the Prince's support, explicitly describing its mission as "to take forward the vision of HRH the Prince of Wales" in an early presentation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632|title=Don’t be deceived.

These claims have been contested by the College.
