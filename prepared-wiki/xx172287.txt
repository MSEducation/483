"This Little Girl of Mine" is a rhythm and blues single written and released as a single by Ray Charles in 1955 on the Atlantic label.
"This Little Girl of Mine" played off "This Little Light of Mine",[tpl]Gilliland|url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19748/m1/ |title=Show 3 - The Tribal Drum: The rise of rhythm and blues. 1 [/tpl] much like the previous "I Got a Woman" and the later "Hallelujah I Love Her So" played off other classic gospel hymns.  And much like those songs, replaced sacred lyrics with secular blues lyrics with doo-wop call and response harmonies.
The song was the B-side to Charles' number-one R&B single, "A Fool for You", and was a charted hit on its own, peaking at number nine on the chart.
The tune was re-made to top 40 pop status in 1958 by The Everly Brothers. It should not be confused with the 1981 Gary U. S. Bonds hit This Little Girl.
