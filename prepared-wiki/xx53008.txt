The Isle of Portland is a limestone tied island, [tpl]convert|6|km|mi|0[/tpl] long by [tpl]convert|2.4|km|mi|1[/tpl] wide, in the English Channel. Portland is [tpl]convert|8|km|mi|0[/tpl] south of the resort of Weymouth, forming the southernmost point of the county of Dorset, England. A barrier beach over which runs the A354 road connects it to Chesil Beach and the mainland. Portland and Weymouth together form the borough of Weymouth and Portland. The population of Portland is 12,400.
Portland is a central part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site on the Dorset and east Devon coast, important for its geology and landforms. Its name is used for one of the British Sea Areas, and has been exported as the name of North American and Australian towns. Portland stone, famous for its use in British and world architecture, including St Paul's Cathedral and the United Nations Headquarters, continues to be quarried.
Portland Harbour, in between Portland and Weymouth, is one of the largest man-made harbours in the world. The harbour was made by the building of stone breakwaters between 1848 and 1905. From its inception it was a Royal Navy base, and played prominent roles during the First and Second World Wars; ships of the Royal Navy and NATO countries worked up and exercised in its waters until 1995. The harbour is now a civilian port and popular recreation area, and was used for the 2012 Olympic Games.

==History==

Portland has been inhabited since at least the Mesolithic period (the Middle Stone Age)—there is archaeological evidence of Mesolithic inhabitants at the Culverwell Mesolithic Site, near Portland Bill,[tpl]cite web | year = 2002 | url = http://www.gallica.co.uk/celts/portland.htm | title = Mesolithic Site, Portland | publisher = Association for Portland Archaeology | accessdate = 2007-07-30 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070609212653/http://www.gallica.co.uk/celts/portland.htm  |archivedate = 2007-06-09[/tpl] and of inhabitation in ages since.

Sir Christopher Wren, the architect and Member of Parliament for nearby Weymouth, used six million tons of white Portland limestone to rebuild destroyed parts of London after the Great Fire of London of 1666. Well-known buildings in the capital, including St Paul's Cathedral[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.stpauls.co.uk/page.aspx?theLang=001lngdef&pointerid=32207NnDnfjeCGJ1g2bvy1Jt3FI0gUAP | title = 1710 — Construction is Completed | publisher = Dean and Chapter St Paul's | accessdate = 2007-04-03|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928083501/http://www.stpauls.co.uk/page.aspx?theLang=001lngdef&pointerid=32207NnDnfjeCGJ1g2bvy1Jt3FI0gUAP |archivedate = September 28, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] and the eastern front of Buckingham Palace feature the stone.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page568.asp | title = Buckingham Palace History | publisher = HM Queen Elizabeth II | accessdate = 2007-04-03[/tpl] After the First World War, a quarry was opened by The Crown Estate to provide stone for the Cenotaph in Whitehall and half a million gravestones for war cemeteries,[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.dorsets.co.uk/Portland/ | title = Portland—Dorset | publisher = Dorset Guide | accessdate = 2007-04-03[/tpl] and after the Second World War hundreds of thousands of gravestones were hewn for the fallen soldiers on the Western Front. Portland cement has nothing to do with Portland; it was named such due to its similar colour to Portland stone when mixed with lime and sand.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.cement.org/basics/concretebasics_history.asp | title = History & Manufacture of Portland Cement | publisher = Portland Cement Association | accessdate = 2007-07-26[/tpl]
There have been railways in Portland since the early 19th century. The Merchant's Railway was the earliest—it opened in 1826 (one year after the Stockton and Darlington railway) and ran from the quarries at the north of Tophill to a pier at Castletown, from where the Portland stone was shipped around the country.[tpl]cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://www.johnrnew.demon.co.uk/weyrails.htm | title = Railways of the Weymouth area | publisher = Island Publishing | accessdate = 2007-07-26[/tpl] The Weymouth and Portland Railway was laid in 1865, and ran from a station in Melcombe Regis, across the Fleet and along the low isthmus behind Chesil Beach to a station at Victoria Square in Chiswell.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=351 | title = Weymouth to Portland Railway, Construction and growth | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-26|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071008013056/http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=351 |archivedate = October 8, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] At the end of the 19th century the line was extended to the top of the island as the Easton and Church Hope Railway, running through Castletown and ascending the cliffs at East Weares, to loop back north to a station in Easton. The line closed to passengers in 1952, and the final goods train (and two passenger 'specials') ran in April 1965.
The Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck stationed a lifeboat at Portland in 1826, which was withdrawn in 1851.[tpl]cite book |last= Denton |first= Tony |title= Handbook 2009 |year= 2009 |publisher= Lifeboat Enthusiasts Society |location= Shrewsbury |page= 59 [/tpl] Coastal flooding has affected Portland's residents and transport for centuries—the only way off the island is along the causeway in the lee of Chesil Beach. At times of extreme floods (about every 10 years) this road link is cut by floods. The low-lying village of Chiswell used to flood on average every 5 years. Chesil Beach occasionally faces severe storms and massive waves, which have a fetch across the Atlantic Ocean.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://content.swgfl.org.uk/jurassic/chis10.htm | title = Chiswell case study: The Scheme | publisher = Jurassic Coast | accessdate = 2007-07-27[/tpl] Following two severe flood events in the 1970s, Weymouth and Portland Borough Council and Wessex Water decided to investigate the structure of the beach, and possible coastal management schemes that could be built to protect Chiswell and the beach road. In the 1980s it was agreed that a scheme to protect against a one-in-five year storm would be practicable; it would reduce flood depth and duration in more severe storms. Hard engineering techniques were employed in the scheme, including a gabion running [tpl]convert|550|m|yd|-1[/tpl][tpl]cite web | year = 2013 | url = http://test.environment-agency.gov.uk/static/documents/Leisure/Chiswell_Gabions_LL_Factsheet_aug12.pdf | title = Chiswell Gabions Flood Alleviation Scheme | publisher = Environment Agency | accessdate = 2014-03-20[/tpl] to the north of Chiswell, an extended sea wall in Chesil Cove, and a culvert running from inside the beach, underneath the beach road and into Portland Harbour, to divert flood water away from low lying areas.
At the start of the First World War, HMS Hood was sunk in the passage between the southern breakwaters to protect the harbour from torpedo and submarine attack.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.battleships-cruisers.co.uk/hms_hood.htm | title = Turret Battleship, HMS Hood | publisher = Cranston Fine Arts | accessdate = 2007-07-26[/tpl] Portland Harbour was formed (1848–1905) by the construction of breakwaters, but before that the natural anchorage had hosted ships of the Royal Navy for more than 500 years. It was a centre for Admiralty research into asdic submarine detection and underwater weapons from 1917 to 1998; the shore base HMS Serepta was renamed HMS Osprey in 1927.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.helis.com/database/?menu=2&tpais=UK&tbase=33&menudiv=1 | title = Portland Base/Heliport History | publisher = helis.com | accessdate = 2007-07-28[/tpl] During the Second World War Portland was the target of heavy bombing, although most warships had moved north as Portland was within enemy striking range across the Channel. Portland was a major embarkation point for Allied forces on D-Day in 1944. Early helicopters were stationed at Portland in 1946–1948, and in 1959 a shallow tidal flat, The Mere, was infilled, and sports fields taken to form a heliport. The station was formally commissioned as HMS Osprey, which then became the largest and busiest military helicopter station in Europe.  The base was gradually improved with additional landing areas and one of England's shortest runways, at [tpl]convert|229|m|ft|0[/tpl].
There are still two prisons on Portland, HMP The Verne, which until 1949 was a huge Victorian military fortress, and a Young Offenders' Institution (HMYOI) on the Grove clifftop. This was the original prison built for convicts who quarried stone for the Portland Breakwaters from 1848. For a few years until 2005 Britain's only prison ship, HMP The Weare, was berthed in the harbour.
The naval base closed after the end of the Cold War in 1995, and the Royal Naval Air Station closed in 1999, although the runway remained in use for Her Majesty's Coastguard Search and Rescue flights as MRCC Portland. MRCC Portland's area of responsibility extends midway across the English Channel, and from Start Point in Devon to the Dorset/Hampshire border, covering an area of around [tpl]convert|10400|km2|sqmi|-2[/tpl].[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.beercoastguard.org/coastguard_rescue_helicoper.htm | title = Coastguard Rescue Helicopter | publisher = Beer Coastguard | accessdate = 2007-07-28|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930140301/http://www.beercoastguard.org/coastguard_rescue_helicoper.htm |archivedate = September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] The 12 Search and Rescue teams in the Portland area dealt with almost 1000 incidents in 2005.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.mcga.gov.uk/c4mca/mcga-dops-regional/eastern-region/mcga-dops_rr_east_regional-eastern-region-solent.htm | title = Eastern Region — Area South | publisher = Maritime and Coastguard Agency | accessdate = 2007-07-28[/tpl]

==Governance==

Portland is an ancient Royal Manor, and until the 19th century remained a separate liberty within Dorset for administration purposes. It was an urban district from 1894 to 1974, until the borough of Weymouth and Portland formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. This merged the borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis with Portland urban district. For local elections the borough is divided into 15 wards, and three of them cover Portland.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=620 | title = Ward Map | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-12-16|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071224210742/http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=620 |archivedate = December 24, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Elections take place in a four-year cycle; one third of the councillors in all but three wards retire or seek re-election in years one, two and three, and county council elections are held in year four.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=618 | title = Electoral Cycles Thirds | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2008-01-04|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080408031609/http://weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=618 |archivedate = April 8, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

==Geography==

The Isle of Portland lies in the English Channel, [tpl]convert|3|km|mi|0[/tpl] south of Wyke Regis, and [tpl]convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] west-southwest of London, at [tpl]coord|50|33|0|N|2|26|24|W| region:GB_type:city[/tpl] (50.55, −2.44). Portland is situated approximately halfway along the UNESCO Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site; the site includes [tpl]convert|153|km|mi|0[/tpl] of the Dorset and east Devon coast that is important for its geology and landforms.[tpl]cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.jurassiccoast.com/279/visiting-the-coast-31/gateway-towns-146/portland-447.html | title = Portland | publisher = Jurassic Coast | accessdate = 2007-12-29[/tpl] The South West Coast Path runs around the coast; it is the United Kingdom's longest national trail at [tpl]convert|1014|km|mi|0[/tpl]. Portland is unusual as it is connected to the mainland at Abbotsbury by Chesil Beach, a tombolo which runs [tpl]convert|29|km|mi|0[/tpl] north-west to West Bay.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/chesil.htm | title = The Chesil Beach — General Introduction | publisher = Southampton University | accessdate = 2007-08-13[/tpl] Portland is sometimes defined incorrectly as a tombolo—in fact Portland is a tied island, and Chesil Beach is the tombolo (a spit joined to land at both ends).[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.vnc.qld.edu.au/enviro/flinders/land-defns.htm | title = Coastal Landform Definitions | publisher = Villanova College | accessdate = 2007-07-29[/tpl]
There are eight settlements on Portland, the largest being Fortuneswell in Underhill and Easton on Tophill. Castletown and Chiswell are the other villages in Underhill, and Weston, Southwell, Wakeham and the Grove are on the Tophill plateau. Many old buildings are built out of Portland Stone; Several parts have been designated Conservation Areas to preserve the unique character the older settlements which date back hundreds of years. The architecture; the natural and man-made environment and the proximity to the sea give Portland overall character which is quite distinct.
The Isle of Portland has been designated by Natural England as National Character Area 137. It is adjoined by the Weymouth Lowlands to the north.Isle of Portland/Weymouth Lowlands at www.naturalengland.org.uk. Accessed on 4 Apr 2013.

===Geology===

Geologically, Portland is separated into two areas; the steeply sloping land at its north end called Underhill, and the larger, gently sloping land to the south, called Tophill. Portland stone lies under Tophill; the strata decline at a shallow angle of around 1.5 degrees, from a height of [tpl]convert|151|m|ft|0[/tpl] near the Verne in the north, to just above sea level at Portland Bill.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/portnew.htm#cross | title = General Geology | publisher = Southampton University | accessdate = 2007-07-26[/tpl] The geology of Underhill is different to Tophill; Underhill lies on a steep escarpment composed of Portland Sand, lying above a thicker layer of Kimmeridge Clay, which extends to Chesil Beach and Portland Harbour. This Kimmeridge Clay has resulted in a series of landslides, forming West Weares and East Weares.
[tpl]convert|2.4|km|1[/tpl] underneath south Dorset lies a layer of Triassic rock salt, and Portland is one of four locations in the United Kingdom where the salt is thick enough to create stable cavities.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/local/display.var.1881457.0.island_may_be_key_gas_supplier.php | title = Island may be key gas supplier | publisher = Dorset Echo | accessdate = 2007-12-05[/tpl][tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.portland-gas.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=48&Itemid=105 | title = Portland gas storage project | publisher = Portland Gas | accessdate = 2007-12-05[/tpl] Portland Gas has applied to excavate 14 caverns to store [tpl]convert|1000000000|m3|cuft[/tpl] of natural gas, which is one percent of the UK's total annual demand.

The surface facilities will be complete to store the first gas in 2011, and the entire cavern space should be available for storage in winter 2013. As part of the £350 million scheme, the Grade II listed former Old Engine Shed is being converted into a £1.5 million educational centre with a café and an exhibition space about the geology of Portland.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/local/display.var.1881211.0.island_may_get_a_1_5m_visitor_centre.php | title = Island may get a £1.5m visitor centre | publisher = Dorset Echo | accessdate = 2007-12-05[/tpl]

===Portland Bill===

Portland Bill is the southern tip of the island of Portland. The Bill has three lighthouse towers: The Higher Lighthouse is now a dwelling and holiday apartments; the Lower Lighthouse is now a bird observatory and field centre which opened in 1961. The white and red lighthouse on Bill Point replaced the Higher and Lower Lighthouses in 1906. It is a prominent and much photographed feature; an important landmark for ships passing the headland and its tidal race. The current lighthouse was refurbished in 1996 and became remotely controlled. It now contains a visitors' centre giving information and guided tours of the lighthouse.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/interactive/gallery/portland_bill.html | title = Portland Bill Lighthouse | publisher = Trinity House | accessdate = 2007-07-26[/tpl] As of June 2009, the lighthouse uses a 1 kW metal-halide US-made lamp with an operational life of about 4000 hours, or 14 months. Two earlier lighthouses stand further inland: one is an important observatory used by ornithologists, providing records of bird migration and accommodation for visitors.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=546 | title = Portland wildlife | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-27|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070513165029/http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=546 |archivedate = May 13, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
Portland Ledge (the Shambles) is an underwater extension of Portland Stone into the English Channel at a place where the depth of Channel is 20 to 40 metres (about 10 to 20 fathoms). Tidal flow is disrupted by the feature; at 10 metres (about 5 fathoms) deep and [tpl]convert|2.4|km|nmi|1[/tpl] long, it causes a tidal race to the south of Portland Bill, the so-called Portland Race.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/portnew.htm#offshore | title = Offshore Geology | publisher = Southampton University | accessdate = 2007-07-26[/tpl] The current only stops for brief periods during the 12½ hour tidal cycle and can reach [tpl]convert|4|m/s|kn|0[/tpl] at the spring tide of [tpl]convert|2|m|0[/tpl].

===Ecology===

Due to its isolated coastal location, the Isle of Portland has an extensive range of flora and fauna; the coastline and disused quarries are designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Sea and migratory birds occupy the cliffs in different seasons, sometimes these include rare species which draw ornithologists from around the country. Rare visitors to the surrounding seas include dolphins, seals and basking sharks. Chesil Beach is one of only two sites in Britain where the Scaly Cricket can be found; unlike any other cricket it is wingless and does not sing or hop.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=542 | title = Chesil Beach | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-27|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070513190720/http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=542 |archivedate = May 13, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Ten British Primitive goats were introduced to the East Weares part of the island to control scrub in 2007.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.portlandcp.org.uk/island/WildlifeNewsletter.pdf |title=Wildlife on Portland|date=Spring 2008|publisher=Heights Hotel and Swarovski Optik|accessdate=18 March 2012|format=PDF[/tpl]
The comparatively warm and sunny climate allows species of plants to thrive which do not on the mainland. The limestone soil has low nutrient levels; hence smaller species of wild flowers and grasses are able to grow in the absence of larger species. Portland Sea Lavender can be found on the higher sea cliffs—unique to Portland it is one of the United Kingdom's rarest plants.[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=543 | title = Coastal Flora & Fauna | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-27|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070513164925/http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=543 |archivedate = May 13, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] The wild flowers and plants make an excellent habitat for butterflies; over half of the British Isles' 57 butterfly species can be seen on Portland, including varieties that migrate from mainland Europe.

===Climate===

The mild seas which almost surround the tied island produce a temperate climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb) with a small variation in daily and annual temperatures.

The mild seas that surround Portland act to keep night-time temperatures above freezing, making winter frost rare: on average 9.6 days per year — this is far below the United Kingdom's average annual total of 55.6 days of frost. Days with snow lying are equally rare: on average zero to six days per year;[tpl]cite web | year = 2001 | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/dl/17.gif | title = Met Office UK snow lying days | publisher = Met Office | accessdate = 2006-10-18[/tpl] almost all winters have one day or less with snow lying.

The A354 road is the only land access to the peninsula, connecting to Weymouth and to the wider road network at the A35 trunk road in Dorchester. It runs from Easton, splitting into a northbound section through Chiswell and a southbound section through Fortuneswell, then along Chesil Beach and across a bridge to the mainland in Wyke Regis. Formerly a branch line railway, connecting to the South West Main Line near Weymouth railway station, also crossed to the island. The corridor is now a cycle path connecting Fortuneswell with Weymouth and a wider network of traffic-free cycle paths.

===Rabbits===

Rabbits have long been associated with bad luck on Portland; use of the name is still taboo—the creatures are often referred to as "Underground Mutton", "Long-Eared Furry Things" or just "bunnies".[tpl]cite news | year = 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/4318710.stm | title = Wallace and Gromit spook island | publisher = BBC | accessdate = 2007-07-26 | date=2005-10-07[/tpl] The origin of this superstition is obscure (there is no record of it before the 1920s) but it is believed to derive from quarry workers; they would see rabbits emerging from their burrows immediately before a rock fall and blame them for increasing the risk of dangerous, sometimes deadly, landslides. If a rabbit was seen in a quarry, the workers would pack up and go home for the day, until the safety of the area had been assured. Local fishermen too would refuse to go to sea if the word was mentioned.
Even today older Portland residents are 'offended' (sometimes for the benefit of tourists) at the mention of rabbits;[tpl]cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=784 | title = Rabbits, the Portland taboo word | publisher = Weymouth and Portland Borough Council | accessdate = 2007-07-26|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071024070726/http://www.weymouth.gov.uk/main.asp?svid=784 |archivedate = October 24, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] this superstition came to national attention in October 2005 when a special batch of advertisement posters were made for the Wallace and Gromit film, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. In respect of local beliefs the adverts omitted the word 'rabbit' and replaced the film's title with the phrase "Something bunny is going on".

===Literature===

Thomas Hardy called Portland the Isle of Slingers in his novels; the isle was the main setting of The Well-Beloved (1897), and was featured in The Trumpet-Major (1880).[tpl]cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.lymeregis.com/hardy_country/ | title = Thomas Hardy County and the Hardy Trail | publisher = Lyme Regis Tourist Information | accessdate = 2007-07-26[/tpl] The cottage that now houses Portland Museum was the inspiration for the heroine's house in The Well-Beloved. Portlanders were expert stone-throwers in the defence of their land, and Hardy's Isle of Slingers is heavily based on Portland; the Street of Wells representing Fortuneswell and The Beal Portland Bill. Hardy named Portland the Gibraltar of the North, with reference to its similarities with Gibraltar; its physical geography, isolation, comparatively mild climate, and Underhill's winding streets.[tpl]cite web | authorlink = Thomas Hardy | year = 2007 | url = http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Well-Beloved1.html | title = The Well-Beloved by Thomas Hardy | publisher = Full Books | accessdate = 2007-07-26[/tpl]
In The Warlord Chronicles (1995–97), Bernard Cornwell makes Portland the Isle of the Dead, a place of internal exile, where the causeway was guarded to keep the 'dead' (people suffering insanity) from crossing the Fleet and returning to the mainland. No historical evidence exists to support this idea.[tpl]cite web | year = 1999 | url = http://www.britishdowsers.org/EEG_site/archive/articles/aua2001_issue24/isleofdead_JHarvey_m.htm | title = The Isle of the Dead | publisher = British Society of Dowsers | accessdate = 2007-07-30[/tpl]
The Portland Chronicles series of four children's books, set on and around Portland and Weymouth and written by local author Carol Hunt, draw on local history to explore a seventeenth century world of smuggling, witchcraft, piracy and local intrigue.[tpl]cite web|author=Roving Press Ltd |url=http://www.rovingpress.co.uk/PortlandSeaDragon.html |title=Portland Sea Dragon |publisher=Roving Press |date=2013-07-02 |accessdate=2013-07-08[/tpl]
Hilaire Belloc's book The Cruise of the "Nona" is about sailing near Portland, and the reflections it occasions. He describes Portland Race as "the master terror of our world", and says "... if you were to make a list of all the things which Portland Race has swallowed up, it would rival Orcus".

===Religion===

Portland has a history linked to the Christian Church which goes back many years.  Currently the Christian denominations represented on the Island are Church of England, Methodist, Salvation Army and a number of free independent churches.  The Roman Catholic community travels to nearby Weymouth to celebrate Mass.  There are no large centres of other world religions on the Island, although a number of these are represented through the two prisons on the Island both of which have multi-faith teams.
