Ray Linn (born October 20, 1920 in Chicago, Illinois - died November 1996 in Columbus, Ohio) was an American jazz trumpeter.
Linn's first major engagements came in the late 1930s, playing with Tommy Dorsey (1938-41) and Woody Herman (1941-42). He would return to play with Herman again several times, in 1945, 1947, and 1955-59. In the 1940s he spent time with Jimmy Dorsey (1942-45), Benny Goodman (1943, 1947), Artie Shaw (1944-46), and Boyd Raeburn (1946). He moved to Los Angeles in 1945, where he worked extensively as a studio musician, in addition to playing with Bob Crosby (1950-51) and his extended final tenure with Herman. He spent much of the 1960s playing music for television, including The Lawrence Welk Show.
Linn recorded eight tunes as a leader in 1946, and full-length albums in 1978 and 1980, the latter of which are Dixieland jazz efforts.
