[[Meteņi]]

CATEGORIES: Public holidays in Latvia

In ancient Latvia, Meteņi was a festival celebrated on February 23.  The primary attraction was a feast which included all the parts of a pig, bread, barley and beer.  The people also went sledding.  The degree to which one celebrated Meteņi was believed to be proportional to the success of one's crops.  Thus, farmers and their families danced vigorously to ensure a good harvest.  The festival was sacred to Metenis, who was said to arrive on a sleigh on this holiday.
