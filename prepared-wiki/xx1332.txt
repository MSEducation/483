Cheddar Gorge, on the northern edge of the village, is the largest gorge in the United Kingdom and includes several show caves including Gough's Cave.  The gorge has been a centre of human settlement since Neolithic times, including a Saxon palace.  It has a temperate climate and provides a unique geological and biological environment that has been recognised by the designation of several Sites of Special Scientific Interest.[tpl]cite web|title=Cheddar Gorge and Caves|url=http://www.bristol-link.co.uk/entertainment/cheddar-gorge.htm|publisher=Bristol-link | accessdate=31 January 2011[/tpl] It is also the site of several limestone quarries. The village gave its name to Cheddar cheese and has been a centre for strawberry growing, with the crop being transported on the Cheddar Valley line, which closed in the late 1960s but is now a cycle path. It is now a major tourist destination with several cultural and community facilities, including the Cheddar Show Caves Museum.[tpl]cite web|title=Cheddar Man—Museum of Prehistory|url=http://www.cheddarcaves.co.uk/section.php?xSec=20 | accessdate=31 January 2011|publisher=Cheddar Caves[/tpl]
The village supports a variety of community groups including religious, sporting and cultural organisations. Several of these are based on the site of The Kings of Wessex Academy, which is the largest educational establishment.

==History==

There is evidence of occupation from the Neolithic period in Cheddar.  Britain's oldest complete human skeleton, Cheddar Man, estimated to be 9,000 years old, was found in Cheddar Gorge in 1903.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/naturescalendar/summer/honeypots/cheddar/cheddar_gorge.shtml | title= Tourist hotspots—Cheddar Gorge | work = BBC |accessdate =12 August 2007[/tpl] Older remains from the Upper Late Palaeolithic era (12,000–13,000 years ago) have been found.[tpl]cite web| url= http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=10398 | title = Gough's Cave, Cheddar Gorge, Cheddar | work=Somerset Historic Environment Record | publisher = Somerset County Council |date=January 1983 | accessdate =7 February 2011[/tpl] There is some evidence of a Bronze Age field system at the Batts Combe quarry site.  There is also evidence of Bronze Age barrows at the mound in the Longwood valley, which if man-made it is likely to be a field system. The remains of a Roman villa have been excavated in the grounds of the current vicarage.
The village of Cheddar had been important during the Roman and Saxon eras. There was a royal palace at Cheddar during the Saxon period, which was used on three occasions in the 10th century to host the Witenagemot.[tpl]cite web | url= http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-769-1/ahds/dissemination/pdf/vol06-07/6_053_066.pdf | format= PDF | last= Rahtz | first= Phillip | publisher= Archaeology Data Service | title= The Saxon and Medieval Palaces at Cheddar, Somerset-an Interim Report of Excavations in I 960-62 | accessdate=31 March 2008[/tpl] The ruins of the palace were excavated in the 1960s.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/hes/downloads/EUS_CheddarText.pdf|title=Cheddar Archaeological Assessment|last=Richardson|first=Miranda|year=2003|work=Somerset Extensive Urban Survey|publisher=Somerset County Council| format= PDF|accessdate=30 March 2010[/tpl] They are located on the grounds of The Kings of Wessex Academy, together with a 14th century chapel dedicated to St. Columbanus.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=268795 | work= Images of England | publisher=English Heritage | title= Former chapel dedicated to St Columbanus | accessdate=31 March 2008[/tpl] Roman remains have also been uncovered at the site.[tpl]Cite news| title=School dig uncovers Roman grave | publisher= BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/4630806.stm | date=20 January 2006 | accessdate=31 March 2008[/tpl] Cheddar was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Ceder, meaning "Shear Water", from the Old English scear and Celtic dwr.[tpl]Cite book|last=Robinson |first=Stephen |authorlink= |title=Somerset Place Names |year=1992 |publisher=The Dovecote Press Ltd | page=43 |location=Wimborne, Dorset |isbn=1-874336-03-2[/tpl] As early as 1130 AD, the Cheddar Gorge was recognised as one of the "Four wonders of England".

==Geography==

The area is underlain by Black Rock slate, Burrington Oolite and Clifton Down Limestone of the Carboniferous Limestone Series, which contain ooliths and fossil debris on top of Old Red Sandstone, and by Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Keuper. Evidence for Variscan orogeny is seen in the sheared rock and cleaved shales. In many places weathering of these strata has resulted in the formation of immature calcareous soils.[tpl]cite web | title=The Cheddar Complex | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003940.pdf | accessdate=17 July 2006|format=PDF[/tpl]

===Gorge and caves===

Cheddar Gorge, which is located on the edge of the village, is the largest gorge in the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/may05/Travels0505.html | title= Cheddar Gorge: Not entirely cheesy |date=May 2005 | work= Geotimes, a publication of the American Geological Institute | accessdate=12 August 2007[/tpl]
The gorge is the site of the Cheddar Caves, where Cheddar Man was found in 1903. Older remains from the Upper Late Palaeolithic era (12,000–13,000 years ago) have been found. The caves, produced by the activity of an underground river, contain stalactites and stalagmites. Gough's Cave, which was discovered in 1903,[tpl]cite web |url=http://piclib.nhm.ac.uk/results.asp?image=033406&itemw=4&itemf=0001&itemstep=1&itemx=1 |title=Gough's Cave excavation site |publisher=Natural History Museum|accessdate=7 February 2011 [/tpl] leads around [tpl]convert|400|m|yd|0|abbr=on[/tpl] into the rock-face, and contains a variety of large rock chambers and formations.

===Sites of Special Scientific Interest===

There are several large and unique Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) around the village.
Cheddar Reservoir is a near-circular artificial reservoir operated by Bristol Water. Dating from the 1930s, it has a capacity of 135 million gallons (614,000 cubic metres).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bristolwater.co.uk/leisure/cheddar-info.asp|title=Cheddar Reservoir Introduction|publisher=Bristol Water|accessdate=30 March 2010[/tpl] The reservoir is supplied with water taken from the Cheddar Yeo, which rises in Gough's Cave in Cheddar Gorge and is a tributary of the River Axe. The inlet grate for the [tpl]convert|54|in|m|1|adj=on[/tpl] water pipe that is used to transport the water can be seen next to the sensory garden in Cheddar Gorge.[tpl]cite web|title=Axbridge Raw Water Treatment Works|url=http://www.ceequal.co.uk/awards_035.htm|work=Axbridge Raw Water|publisher=CEEQUAL|accessdate=5 March 2011[/tpl] It has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to its wintering waterfowl populations.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/Special/sssi/sssi_details.cfm?sssi_id=1003948 |title=English Nature SSSI information for Cheddar Reservoir |publisher=English Nature |accessdate=7 February 2011[/tpl]
Cheddar Wood and the smaller Macall's Wood form a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest from what remains of the wood of the Bishops of Bath and Wells in the 13th century and of King Edmund the Magnificent's wood in the 10th. During the 19th century, its lower fringes were grubbed out to make strawberry fields. Most of these have been allowed to revert to woodland. The wood was coppiced until 1917.[tpl]Cite book|title=Aspects of the medieval landscape of Somerset |last=Aston |first=Michael |authorlink=Mick Aston |year= 1988|publisher=Somerset County Council |location= |isbn=0-86183-129-2 |page=30 [/tpl] This site compromises a wide range of habitats which include ancient and secondary semi-natural broadleaved woodland, unimproved neutral grassland, and a complex mosaic of calcareous grassland and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. Cheddar Wood is one of only a few English stations for Starved Wood-sedge (Carex depauperata). Purple Gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum), a nationally rare plant, also grows in the wood. Butterflies include Silver-washed Fritillary (Argynnis paphia), Dark Green Fritillary (Argynnis aglaja), Pearl-bordered Fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), Holby Blue (Celastrina argiolus) and Brown Argus (Aricia agestis). The slug (Arion fasciatus), which has a restricted distribution in the south of England, and the Soldier beetle (Cantharis fusca) also occur.[tpl]cite web| title=Cheddar Wood | publisher=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003970.pdf | format= PDF| accessdate=17 July 2006[/tpl]
By far the largest of the SSSIs is called Cheddar Complex and covers [tpl]convert|441.3|ha|acre|1[/tpl] of the gorge, caves and the surrounding area. It is important because of both biological and geological features. It includes four SSSIs, formerly known as Cheddar Gorge SSSI, August Hole/Longwood Swallet SSSI, GB Cavern Charterhouse SSSI and Charterhouse on-Mendip SSSI.[tpl]cite web| title=The Cheddar Complex | publisher=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003940.pdf | format= PDF| accessdate=17 July 2006[/tpl] It is partly owned by the National Trust who acquired it in 1910[tpl]cite web|title=Nature and the National Trust|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-chl/w-countryside_environment/w-nature/w-nature-strategy.htm|publisher=National Trust|accessdate=4 March 2011[/tpl] and partly managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust.[tpl]cite web|title=Cheddar Complex|url=http://www.somersetwildlife.org/cheddar_complex.html|publisher=Somerset Wildlife Trust|accessdate=4 March 2011[/tpl]

===Quarries===

Close to the village and gorge are Batts Combe quarry and Callow Rock quarry, two of the active Quarries of the Mendip Hills where limestone is still extracted. Operating since the early 20th century, Batts Combe is owned and operated by Hanson Aggregates. The output in 2005 was around 4,000 tonnes of limestone per day, one third of which was supplied to an on-site lime kiln, which closed in 2009;[tpl]cite news | newspaper= Cheddar Valley Gazette | date= 26 March 2009 | url= http://www.thisissomerset.co.uk/cheddarvalley/news/Jobs-kiln-closed/article-843237-detail/article.html | title= Jobs may go as kiln is closed | accessdate=29 March 2009[/tpl] the remainder was sold as coated or dusted aggregates.

===Climate===

Along with the rest of South West England, Cheddar has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country.[tpl]cite web | title=South West England: climate | work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ | accessdate=14 March 2010[/tpl] The annual mean temperature is approximately [tpl]convert|10|°C|°F|1[/tpl]. Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea, which moderates temperature. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately [tpl]convert|21|°C|°F|1[/tpl]. In winter mean minimum temperatures of [tpl]convert|1|°C|°F|1[/tpl] or [tpl]convert|2|°C|°F|1[/tpl] are common. In the summer the Azores high-pressure system affects the south-west of England. Convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine; annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which are most active during those seasons. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around [tpl]convert|700|mm|abbr=on[/tpl]. About 8–15 days of snowfall per year is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

The market cross in Bath Street dates from the 15th century, with the shelter having been rebuilt in 1834. It has a central octagonal pier, a socket raised on four steps, a hexagonal shelter with six arched four-centred openings, shallow two-stage buttresses at each angle, and an embattled parapet. The shaft is crowned by an abacus with figures in niches, probably from the late 19th century, although the cross is now missing. It was rebuilt by Thomas, Marquis of Bath. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument (Somerset County No 21) and Grade II* listed building.[tpl]cite web| title=Market Cross | work=Images of England | publisher=English Heritage | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=268772 | accessdate=9 May 2006[/tpl]

It was on the Cheddar Valley line, a railway line that was opened in 1869 and closed in 1963. It became known as The Strawberry Line because of the large volume of locally-grown strawberries that it carried. It ran from Yatton railway station through [tpl]stnlnk|Cheddar[/tpl] to Wells (Tucker Street) railway station and joined the East Somerset Railway to make a through route via Shepton Mallet (High Street) railway station to Witham. Sections of the now-disused railway have been opened as the Strawberry Line Trail, which currently runs from Yatton to Cheddar. The Cheddar Valley line survived until the "Beeching Axe". Towards the end of its life there were so few passengers that diesel railcars were sometimes used. The Cheddar branch closed to passengers on 9 September 1963 and to goods in 1964. The line closed in the 1960s, when it became part of the Cheddar Valley Railway Nature Reserve, and part of the National Cycle Network route 26. The cycle route also intersects with the West Mendip Way and various other footpaths.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.movingsomersetforward.co.uk/files/uploads/maps/CheddarWEB.pdf|title=Cycling Map 10 Cheddar and Axbridge|publisher=Moving Somerset Forward | format= PDF|accessdate=30 March 2010[/tpl]
