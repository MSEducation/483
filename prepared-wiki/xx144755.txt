==Pananatili music video==

In December 1991, Hangad released a music video for "Pananatili", featuring a story about a woman writing a letter to her husband, who is working in another province. Some scenes were shot at the Manila Central Post Office building. Hangad members played part of the cast; members Lissa Fontanilla and Teejay Ortiz played the husband-and-wife pair. It was shown on major television stations and still enjoys regular broadcasts on RPN-9 and IBC-13.
