Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) is a state agency of Texas.
TDLR refers to itself as "the umbrella licensing agency of the state", dealing primarily with most, but not all, "non-professional" occupations (i.e., those not requiring four-year or advanced college degrees) such as cosmetologists and electricians.  (Plumbers are licensed through a separate board.  "Professional" occupations (i.e., those requiring a four-year or graduate degree) are licensed through separate agencies, such as the Texas Medical Board which handles the licensing and professional discipline of doctors.)
TDLR has its headquarters in the Ernest O. Thompson State Office Building in Downtown Austin."Contact information for the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation."
