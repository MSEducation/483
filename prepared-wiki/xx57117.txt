Armand Hammer (May 21, 1898Armand Hammer, The Untold Story by Steve Weinberg, p. 16 – December 10, 1990) was an American business manager and owner, most closely associated with Occidental Petroleum, a company he ran for decades, though he was known as well for his art collection, his philanthropy, and for his close ties to the Soviet Union.
Hammer's business interests around the world and his "citizen diplomacy" helped him cultivate a wide network of friends and acquaintances.
He appeared frequently on television, commenting on international relations or agitating for research into a cure for cancer. As of 2008, he has been the subject of five biographies — in 1975 (Considine, authorized biography), 1985 (Bryson, coffee table book), Weinberg 1989, Blumay 1992, and Epstein 1996 — and two autobiographies (1932 and a best seller in 1987). His art collectionThe Armand Hammer Collection: Four Centuries of Masterpieces, published by the Armand Hammer Foundation in multiple editions (eventually becoming five centuries of masterpieces), sometimes in conjunction with museums where the collection was displayed.Honore Daumier 1808–1879: The Armand Hammer Daumier Collection Incorporating a Collection from George Longstreet, 1981 and his philanthropic projectsDreams & Promises: The Story of the Armand Hammer United World College : A Critical Analysis, Theodore Lockwood, 1997 were the subject of numerous publications as well.

==Early life==

Hammer was born in New York City, to Ukrainian-born Jewish immigrants Julius and Rose (Lipshitz) Hammer.Names of parents[tpl]Cite book|last=Epstein|first=Edward Jay|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Dossier: the secret history of Armand Hammer|publisher=Orion Business|year=1998|location=|pages=34|month=|url=|isbn=0752813862[/tpl] His father came to the United States from Odessa in the Russian Empire (today Ukraine) in 1875, and settled in The Bronx, where he ran a general medical practice and five drugstores.
Hammer claimed that his father had named him after a character, Armand Duval, in La Dame aux Camélias, a novel by Alexandre Dumas, fils. According to other sources, Hammer was named after the "arm and hammer" graphic symbol of the Socialist Labor Party of America (SLP), in which his father had a leadership role.Dossier: The Secret History of Armand Hammer, Edward Jay Epstein, 1996, p. 35 (After the Russian Revolution, a part of the SLP under Julius' leadership split off to become a founding element of the Communist Party USA.) Later in his life, Hammer confirmed that this was the origin of his given name.
Hammer attended Morris High School, Columbia College (B.A., 1919) where he was a member of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity, and then attended medical school at Columbia (M.D., 1921). When his father was sentenced to prison as he entered medical school, he and his brothers took Allied Drug, the family business, to new heights, reselling equipment they had bought at depressed prices at the end of World War I. According to Hammer, his first business success was in 1919, manufacturing and selling a ginger extract which legally contained high levels of alcohol. This was extremely popular during prohibition, and the company had $1 million in sales that year.

==Years in the Soviet Union==

In 1921, while waiting for his internship to begin at Bellevue Hospital, Hammer went to the Soviet Union for a trip that lasted until late 1930.Armand Hammer, The Untold Story, Steve Weinberg, p. 77 Although his career in medicine was cut short, he relished being referred to as "Dr. Hammer".  Hammer's intentions in the 1921 trip have been debated since. He has claimed that he originally intended to recoup $150,000 in debts for drugs shipped during the Allied intervention, but was soon moved by a capitalistic and philanthropic interest in selling wheat to the then-starving Russians.Armand Hammer, The Untold Story, Steve Weinberg, p.43 In his passport application, Hammer stated that he intended to visit only western Europe.Dossier: The Secret History of Armand Hammer, Edward Jay Epstein, 1996, p. 45 J. Edgar Hoover in the Justice Department knew this was false, but Hammer was allowed to travel anyway.Armand Hammer, The Untold Story, Steve Weinberg, p. 36 A skeptical U.S. government watched him through this trip, and for the rest of his life.

==Career==

After graduating from medical school, Hammer extended earlier entrepreneurial ventures with a successful business importing many goods from and exporting pharmaceuticals to the newly formed Soviet Union, together with his younger brother Victor. According to Hammer, on his initial trip, he took $60,000 in medical supplies to aid in a typhus epidemic, and made a deal with Lenin for furs and caviars in exchange for a shipment of surplus American wheat. He moved to the USSR in the 1920s to oversee these operations, especially his large business manufacturing and exporting pens and pencils.
According to Alexander Barmine, who was assigned by the Central Committee to run the Mezhdunarodnaya Kniga company to compete with Hammer, the stationery concession was actually granted to Dr. Julius Hammer.[tpl]cite book | last = Barmine | first = Alexander | title = One Who Survived | publisher = G.P. Putnam's Sons | year = 1945 | location = New York | pages = 331[/tpl] According to Barmine the party spent five million gold rubles on stationery supplies made in factories controlled by Julius Hammer and other concessionaires making them rich.[tpl]cite book | last = Barmine | first = Alexander | title = One Who Survived | publisher = G.P. Putnam's Sons | year = 1945 | location = New York | pages = 157[/tpl] The Soviets were eventually able to duplicate certain items such as typewriter parts and pens and end those concessions but were never able to match the quality of Hammer's pencils so that concession became permanent according to Barmine.[tpl]cite book | last = Barmine | first = Alexander | title = One Who Survived | publisher = G.P.

In his 1983 book Red Carpet, author Joseph Finder discusses Hammer's "extensive involvement with Russia."New York Times, "What's New on the Corporate Bookshelf," July 31, 1983 http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E0DF1139F932A05754C0A965948260
After returning to the U.S., Hammer entered into a diverse array of business, art, cultural, and humanitarian endeavors, including investing in various U.S. oil production efforts. These oil investments were later parlayed into control of Occidental Petroleum. Throughout his life he continued personal and business dealings with the Soviet Union, despite the Cold War. In later years he lobbied and traveled extensively at great personal expense, working for peace between the United States and the Communist countries of the world, including ferrying physicians and supplies into the Soviet Union to help Chernobyl survivors.

Politically, Hammer was a staunch supporter of the Republican party. He boosted Richard Nixon's presidential campaign with $54,000 in campaign contributions. He pled guilty on charges that one of these donations had been made illegally and received probation and a $3000 fine,[tpl]cite book|last=Nizer|first=Lois|title=Reflections without mirrors[/tpl] but was later pardoned by Republican U.S. President George H. W. Bush.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/15/us/armand-hammer-pardoned-by-bush.html | work=The New York Times | first=David | last=Rampe | title=ARMAND HAMMER PARDONED BY BUSH | date=August 15, 1989[/tpl]
He was a collector of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings. His personal donation forms the core of the permanent collection of the UCLA Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, California. Together with his brother Victor, he was the owner of the famed "Hammer Galleries" in New York City.[tpl]cite book|last=Hammer|first=Victor J.|title=Elizabeth Charleston|publisher=S & R Hayden|year=1976|location=New York|pages=8[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hammer.ucla.edu/collections/2/|title=The Armand Hammer Collection|publisher=UCLA|accessdate=2008-09-27[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,770808,00.html|title=Hammer Icons|publisher=Time Magazine|date=1937-08-16|accessdate=2008-09-27| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080917124817/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,770808,00.html| archivedate= 17 September 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Hammer was a philanthropist, supporting causes related to education, medicine, and the arts. Among his legacies is the Armand Hammer United World College of the American West (now generally called the UWC-USA, part of the United World Colleges). By the time of his death, Hammer had won the Soviet Union's Order of Friendship of Peoples, the U.S. National Medal of Arts (1987), France's Legion of Honor, Italy's Grand Order of Merit, Sweden's Royal Order of the Polar Star, Austria's Knight Commander's Cross, Pakistan's Hilal-i-Quaid-Azam Peace Award, Israel's Leadership Award, Venezuela's Order of Andrés Bello, Mexico's National Recognition Award, Bulgaria's Jubilee Medal, and Belgium's Order of the Crown.Dossier – The Secret History of Armand Hammer, Edward Jay Epstein, 1996, p. 8 Hammer hungered for a Nobel Peace Prize, and was repeatedly nominated for one, including by Menachem Begin,"The Unfinished Business of Armand Hammer; After A Lifetime in the Public Eye, He Still Worries About His Place in History", Donald Woutat, Los Angeles Times Magazine, June 7, 1987, p. 8 but never won.

===Hammer's association with the Gore family===

Occidental's coal interests were represented for many years by attorney and former U.S. Senator Albert Arnold Gore, Sr., among others. Gore, who had a longtime close friendship with Hammer, became the head of the subsidiary Island Creek Coal Company, upon his election loss in the Senate. Much of Occidental's coal and phosphate production was in Tennessee, the state Gore represented in the Senate, and Gore owned shares in the company. Former Vice President Albert Arnold Gore, Jr. received much criticism from environmentalists, when the shares passed to the estate after the death of Albert Gore Sr., and Albert Gore Jr. was a son and the executor of the estate. Albert Gore Jr. did not exercise control over the shares, which were eventually sold when the estate closed.
Hammer was very fond of Albert Gore Jr., and in 1984 under Hammer's guidance Gore Jr. sought Tennessee's senate office previously held by Howard Baker. Hammer supposedly promised Gore Sr. that he could make his son the president of the United States. It was under Hammer's encouragement and support that Gore Jr. sought the Democratic Party presidential nomination in 1988.Edward Jay Epstein, Dossier: The Secret History of Armand Hammer. NY: Orion Business, 1998.[ref]“Like his father before him, Al Gore
Jr.’s political career was lavishly sponsored by Hammer from the moment
it began until Hammer died, only two years before Gore Clinton race for the White House in
1992.” Neil Lyndon, Hammer.[/ref]

==Death==

Hammer died of bone marrow cancer in December 1990, aged 92 in Los Angeles, and was buried in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, across the street from his Occidental building on Wilshire Boulevard.

==Personal life==

Hammer was the middle child of three boys. He had close relationships, including business relationships, with his brothers, Harry and Victor Hammer, throughout their lives. He married three times, first in 1927, to a Russian actress, Olga Von Root, the daughter of a czarist general.[tpl]Cite book|last=Considine|first=Bob|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The remarkable life of Dr. Armand Hammer|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1975|location=|pages=75|month=|url=|isbn=0060108363[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=Reaches Into Her Gypsy Songbag For Tunes To Give To Posterity .|pages=|publisher=Meriden Daily Journal|date=1934-03-06|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cbFIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=swENAAAAIBAJ&pg=922,1138675&dq=reaches-into-her-gypsy-songbag-for-tunes-to-give-to-posterity&hl=en|accessdate=2011-05-18[/tpl] In 1943, he was married to Angela Zevely.

==Arm & Hammer==

In the 1980s Hammer owned a considerable amount of stock in Church and Dwight, the company that manufactures Arm & Hammer products; he also served on its board of directors. But the Arm & Hammer company's brand name did not originate with Armand Hammer. It was in use some 31 years before Hammer was born.Arm & Hammer controversy
