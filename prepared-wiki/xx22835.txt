Section 78B of the Act requires Australian courts to ensure that the parties give notice to the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth and each State before proceeding with any case involving a "matter arising under the Constitution." The Commonwealth and State governments may then intervene in the case under section 78A of the Act.
