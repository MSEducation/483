Ayyavazhi is centered on the life and preachings of Ayya Vaikundar; its ideas and philosophy are based on the holy texts Akilattirattu Ammanai and Arul Nool. Accordingly, Vaikundar was the Purna avatar of Narayana. Ayyavazhi shares many ideas with Hinduism in its mythology and practice, but differs considerably in its concepts of good and evil and dharma.G.

==Etymology and history==

Ayya in Tamil means 'Father'Pon.T. Dharmarasan, Akilathirattu, p. 146 and vazhi, 'the pathway' ; The simple derivative in the sense is  'The Pathway of (or) towards Father' . Apart, due to the diverse synonymous versions for the phrase in Tamil, it also leads to various other theories.R. Shanmugam, Narayana Kulatthil Narayanar Avataram, p. 188Akilathirattu ammanai Arappadanool, First Stage, p. 27, published by Vaikundar Seva Sangam
Ayyavazhi began to be noticed initially by the large number of people gathering to worship Vaikundar (known historically as "Mudisoodum Perumal") (1809 CE –  1851 CE)Vaikundar is a historical as well as mythical figure. The historical Vaikundar (often referred to as 'Vaikunta Swami') refers to a person who lived between 1809 CE –  1851 CE The Akilam myth says that Vaikundar was the God incarnate who incarnates in the body of ' Sampooranathevan ' alias  'Muthukutty'  in 1833 CE and lived to 1851 CE So Akilam, Sampooranathevan lived between 1809 CE and 1833 CE and Vaikundar then incarnated in the body of Mudisoodum Perumal (Sampooranathevan), living from 1833 CE to 1851 CE. at Poovandanthoppe.[ref]
