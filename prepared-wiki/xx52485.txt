[[Room acoustics]]

CATEGORIES: Acoustics

Room acoustics describes how sound behaves in an enclosed space.
The way that sound behaves in a room can be broken up into roughly four different frequency zones:

==Natural modes==

The sound wave has reflections at the walls, floor and ceiling of the room. The incident wave then has interference with the reflected one. This action creates standing waves that generate nodes and high pressure zones.“Acoustics”, Leo Beranek, chapter 10,  McGraw Hill Books, 1954
In 1981, in order to solve this problem, Oscar Bonello, professor at the University of Buenos Aires, formulated a modal density concept solution which used concepts from psychoacoustics."A NEW CRITERION FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF NORMAL ROOM MODES" - Journal of the Audio Engineering Society (USA) Vol. 29, Nro. 9 - September/1981. Oscar Bonello Called "Bonello Criteria", the method analyzes the first 48 room modes and plots the number of modes in each one-third of an octave. The curve increases monotonically (each one-third of an octave must have more modes than the preceding one).Handbook for Sound Engineers Glen Ballou, Howards Sams Editors, page 56. Other systems to determine correct room ratios have more recently been developed Cox, TJ, D'Antonio, P and Avis, MR 2004, "Room sizing and optimization at low frequencies." , Journal of the Audio Engineering Society, 52 (6) , pp. 640-651.

==Reverberation of the room==

After determining the best dimensions of the room, using the modal density criteria, the next step is to find the correct reverberation time.  The reverberation time depends on the use of the room. Times about 1.5 to 2 seconds are needed for opera theaters and concert halls. For broadcasting and recording studios and conference rooms, values under one second are frequently used. The recommended reverberation time is always a function of the volume of the room. Several authors give their recommendations “Acoustics”, Leo Beranek, chapter 13,  McGraw Hill Books, 1954 A good approximation for Broadcasting  Studios and Conference Rooms  is:  TR1kHz = log (V+62) – 0,38   TR in seconds and V=volume of the room in m3  “Clases de Acústica”, Oscar Bonello, Edited CEI, Facultad de Ingeniería UBA The ideal RT60 must have the same value at all frequencies from 30 to 12,000 Hz.  Or, at least, it is acceptable to have a linear rising from 100% at 500 Hz to 150% down to 62 Hz
To get the desired RT60, several acoustics materials can be used as described in several books.[tpl]cite book|last=Rettinger|first=Michael|title=Acoustic Design and Noise Control|year=1977|publisher=Chemical Publishing|location=New York[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Knudsen|first=Vern Oliver|title=Acoustical designing in Architecture|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=New York|authorlink=Vern Oliver Knudsen|coauthors=Cyril M.

These panels use a combination of  three  Helmholtz resonators and a wooden resonant panel. This system gives a large acoustic absorption at low frequencies (under 500 Hz) and reduces at high frequencies to compensate for the typical absorption by people, lateral surfaces, ceilings, etc.
