Charles Henry Harrod (1799–1885) was a businessman involved in retail trade who founded the highly successful Harrods store in London.

==Career==

At a young age, Harrod worked as a miller in Clacton but in 1834 he moved to London where he began selling groceries in Stepney.
In the 1840s he rented a small shop on Brompton Road, Knightsbridge, known as "Harrods". The shop sold groceries and only had a turnover of £20 per week. During the 1850s Knightsbridge grew into one of the most fashionable parts of London.
In 1860 Charles sold the business to his son, Charles Digby Harrod. The trade at Harrods continued to grow and by 1868 the shop had sixteen staff and the turnover had risen to £1,000 per week. Harrod concentrated on encouraging wealthy people to his store and provided a personalised service for important customers. He also managed to increase trade by introducing his own brand groceries patriotically packaged in the colours of the Union Flag.
