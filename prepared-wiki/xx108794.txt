The Sosso Empire was a twelfth-century Kaniaga kingdom of West Africa.  

==Medieval Sosso==

The modern Sosso people trace their history to a 12th- and 13th-century Kaniaga kingdom known as the "Sosso."  With the fall of the Ghana Empire, the Sosso expanded into a number of its former holdings, including its capital of Koumbi Saleh.  Under King Soumaoro Kant√©, the Sosso briefly conquered the Mandinka kingdoms of what is now Mali.  These gains were lost at the Battle of Kirina (c. 1235) when Mandinka prince Sundiata Keita led a coalition of smaller states to soundly defeat the Sosso, thus beginning the Mali Empire.  Sundiata marched on to the city of Sosso itself and destroyed it, marking the kingdom's end.
