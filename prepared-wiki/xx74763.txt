Government and binding is a theory of syntax and a phrase structure grammar (as opposed to a dependency grammar) in the tradition of transformational grammar developed principally by Noam Chomsky in the 1980s.[tpl]cite book|title=Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures|year=1981/1993|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|author=Chomsky, Noam[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=Some Concepts and Consequences of the Theory of Government and Binding|author=Chomsky, Noam|publisher=Linguistic Inquiry Monograph 6.

The name refers to two central subtheories of the theory: government, which is an abstract syntactic relation, and binding, which deals with the referents of  pronouns, anaphors, and referential expressions. GB was the first theory to be based on the principles and parameters model of language, which also underlies the later developments of the Minimalist Program.

==Government==

The main application of the government relation concerns the assignment of case. Government is defined as follows:
A governs B if and only if
Governors are heads of the lexical categories (V, N, A, P) and tensed I (T). A m-commands B if A does not dominate B and B does not dominate A and the first maximal projection of A dominates B. The maximal projection of a head X is XP. This means that for example in a structure like the following, A m-commands B, but B does not m-command A:
In addition, barrier is defined as follows:see "Minimality" in Haegeman 1994:163f. A barrier is any node Z such that
The government relation makes case assignment unambiguous. The tree diagram below illustrates how DPs are governed and assigned case by their governing heads:
Another important application of the government relation constrains the occurrence and identity of traces as the Empty Category Principle requires them to be properly governed.

==Binding==

Binding can be defined as follows:
Consider the sentence "Johni saw hisi mother." which is diagrammed below using simple phrase structure rules.
The NP "John" c-commands "his" because the first parent of the NP, S, contains "his".  "John" and "his" are also coreferential (they refer to the same person), therefore "John" binds "his".
On the other hand, in the ungrammatical sentence "*The mother of Johni likes himselfi", "John" does not c-command "himself", so they have no binding relationship despite the fact that they corefer. 
The importance of binding is shown in the grammaticality of the following sentences:
Binding is used, along with particular binding principles, to explain the ungrammaticality of those statements. The applicable rules are called Binding Principle A, Binding Principle B, and Binding Principle C. 
Since "himself" is not c-commanded by "John" in sentence 3, Principle A is violated. 
In sentence 1, "him" is bound by "John", violating Principle B. 
In sentence 4, the first instance of "John" binds the second, violating Principle C.
Note that Principles A and B refer to "governing categories"--domains which limit the scope of binding. The definition of a governing category laid out in Lectures on Government and Binding is complex, but in most cases the governing category is essentially the minimal clause or complex NP.
