Shivalik Enclave is situated between Manimajra (now called the manimajra town) and Panchkula. Shivalik Enclave is a part of Chandigarh and one of its boundaries touches the Haryana border (panchkula).
At the time of its conception it was called Notified Area Committee Manimajra, but the residents changed the name to "Shivalik Enclave". In a short span of 3 decades this outskirt town of chandigarh has transformed into a very posh locality and has got the distinction to be one of the best shopping places for shoes, jewellery and hardware in and around Chandigarh.
