In the booklet for Rivers Cuomo's demo compilation album Alone, Cuomo describes how the song "This Is the Way" was originally going to be used for the Red Album over "Dreamin'," then called "Daydreamer." Eventually, Cuomo was able to persuade other band members to choose the "epic, 6-minute, symphonic type of art song" Dreamin' instead.Booklet and Linear Notes of Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo
