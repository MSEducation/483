Homestar Runner is a Flash-animated Internet cartoon series. It mixes surreal humor with references to retro pop culture, video games, classic television, and popular music.
The cartoons were originally centered on the title character, Homestar Runner. However, a series entitled Strong Bad Email or sbemail, in which another main character, Strong Bad, answers emails from viewers, became the most popular and prominent feature of the site. While Homestar and Strong Bad are the main characters, the site has grown to encompass dozens of other characters over the years.
The site is one of the most-visited sites with collections of Flash cartoons on the Internet and is notable for its refusal to sell advertising space (the creators pay for everything through merchandise sales, which includes a line of T-shirts).[tpl]Cite web|author=Chapman, Matt |coauthors=Chapman, Mike | year=2005| title=FAQ | format=SWF | work=homestarrunner.com|url=http://www.homestarrunner.com/faq.html | accessdate=2006-12-18[/tpl] The owners of the website had turned down offers to make a television series.[tpl]Cite news|author=John Scott Lewinsk | title=Homestar Runner Rejects TV to Stay True to Web | work=wired.com | url=http://www.wired.com/entertainment/theweb/news/2007/06/homestarrunner | accessdate=2008-08-26 | date=June 18, 2007[/tpl]
