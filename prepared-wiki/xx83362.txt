The MT-LB (многоцелевой тягач легкий бронированный, Mnogotselevoy Tyagach Lekhko Bronirovannyi / multi-purpose light-armoured towing vehicle) is a Soviet multi-purpose fully amphibious auxiliary armoured tracked vehicle which was first introduced in the late 1960s. Initially the vehicle was known as the M 1970 in the west.

==Development==

In the 1970s the Soviet Central Auto and Tractor Directorate began a development program to replace the AT-P series of artillery tractors (which were based on the ASU-57 airborne self-propelled gun) with a new generation of vehicles. The MT-L was developed to meet this requirement based on the PT-76 amphibious light tank chassis. The MT-LB is the armoured variant of the MT-L. Entering production in the early 1970s, it was cheap to build, being based on many existing components like the engine which was originally developed as a truck engine. It is built at the Kharkov tractor planthttp://tractor-xtz.com/tractor/htz-3n-snegobolotohod/ HTZ-3H-road vehicles and under license in Poland by Huta Stalowa Wolahttp://hsw.pl/czytaj/765 Light Armoured Multipurpose Tracked Tractor MTLB and Bulgaria.

==Description==

The crew, a driver and a commander/gunner sit in a compartment at the front of the vehicle, with the engine behind them. A compartment at the rear enables up to 11 infantry to be carried or a cargo of up to 2,000 kg. A load of 6,500 kg can be towed. The vehicle is fully amphibious, being propelled by its tracks in the water.
A small turret at the front of the vehicle fits a 7.62 mm PKT machine gun with 360 degree manual traverse and an elevation of -5 to +30 degrees. The vehicle is lightly armoured against small arms and shell splinters with a thickness of 3 to 10 mm of steel. The infantry compartment has two hatches over the top, which open forwards. There are 4 firing ports - one in either side of the hull, the other two in the rear twin doors of the infantry compartment.
The driver is provided with a TVN-2 infra-red periscope, which in combination with the OU-3GK infra-red/white light search light provides a range of about 40 m. All vehicles include an NBC system.
