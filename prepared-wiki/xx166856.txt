==History==

===Early period===

Soon after World War II, the club almost archived promotion to the Yugoslav Second League after finishing top of the regional Serbian League (a 3rd tier back then). The most important footballers responsible for this were Hirman, Kirćanski and Herceg. They didn't managed to win the qualificational matches, but in the next season, they ended up selected to participate in the Third national League, after a league system reorganisation. The following year, in 1951, the club managed to archive the quarter-finals of the Yugoslav Cup. Those matches against Dinamo Zagreb were played by Cikoš, Mosorinski, Ninkov, Vinčić, Prodanović, Davidović, Sokolovački, Kirćanski, Radojčić, Ajnberger and Petrov.
With the direction of Radivoje "Koče" Kolarov the main focus was given with the development of the youth squads. Many squad members were selected to play in the regional Vojvodina selection. The "Goalden boys" of that period were Grubački, Rasić, Đuričin, Sokrić, Radlovački, Šporin, Mesaroš, Vlatković, Medan, Šubin and Mirkov. Milan Galić and Radoslav Bečejac came later. As champions of Vojvodina regional League they played the access to the Yugoslav Second League but that failed to manage the promotion oce again.
In 1954 the club plays in the 3rd League. The team is formed by Martinović, Desnica, Đuričin, Vratnjan, Fratucan, Omeragić, Begović, Anić, Popov, Aćamović, Galić, Veselinov, Tamaši and Kerekeš. That generation was considered to have many chances to archive the promotion to the First League. The main obstacle came from FK Sarajevo that despite being defeated by 2-1 the club needed a goal difference in that final match to be bigger that two. The club stayed in the lower leagues and the next promotion was made to the Yugoslav Second League and the players in that archived it were Filep, Kerekeš, Čepski, Tamaši, Dimković, Rus, Kron, Zlatc, Milošev, Bečejac and Šutović.History from former official website.
