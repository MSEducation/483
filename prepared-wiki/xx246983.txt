General elections were held in the Cook Islands in September 1974 to elect 22 MPs to the Cook Islands Parliament.  The elections were won by the Cook Islands Party, which won 14 seats and 63.6% of the vote.  The  Democratic Party won 8 seats and 36.4% of the vote.
During the election the Democratic Party introduced "flying voters", chartering an Air Nauru Boeing 727 to fly voters from New Zealand to Rarotonga to vote.[tpl]cite book |last=Davis |first=Tom |title=Island Boy: An Autobiography |publisher=Institute of Pacific Studies, University of the South Pacific |year=1992 |page=443[/tpl]  Voters paid their own fares, and the flights were open to all regardless of party affiliation.  The tactic was copied by the government at the next election, though with public money.
