After graduating, Hatsumi began to search for a teacher to further his study of martial arts and when he was 26 he met Toshitsugu Takamatsu, known as "the Tiger of Mongolia". Hatsumi was accepted as Takamatsu's student and spent fifteen years on Honshu Island learning various ninjutsu styles from Takamatsu and other members of the Takamatsu family, also he continued to learn judo, Shito Ryu karate, aikido, and kobudo.

==Teachings==

Masaaki Hatsumi focuses the training of the Bujinkan on the "feeling" of technique or what he terms the feeling of real situations. Hatsumi has a non-standoffish teaching approach, leading Black Belt magazine to call him "wild, funny, unpredictable, and a cross between Charlie Chaplin and Obi-Wan Kenobi."[tpl]cite news |first= William |last= Groak |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Black Belt Times: Ninja Leader Hatsumi Returns to U.S.|url= |quote= |work=Black Belt Magazine |date=August 1986 |page= 16[/tpl]
Hatsumi focuses on teaching taijutsu to his students, as the other ninja arts have no need to be practiced in modern times, besides for "historical study".[tpl]cite book |title=Ninja |last=Ollhoff |first=Jim |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=ABDO |location= |page= |pages=28–29 |accessdate=July 9, 2012 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Mov9uE6Z9lwC&pg=PA29&dq=Masaaki+Hatsumi&hl=en&sa=X&ei=elH7T4XuNeqU6wGx6rnWBg&ved=0CGUQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q=Masaaki%20Hatsumi&f=false[/tpl]

Hatsumi claims that ninjutsu was developed by Japanese mountain clans, using "esoteric skills and philosophies" brought to Japan by Tang Dynasty exiles.[tpl]cite news | last = Phelan | first = Stephen | url = http://www.cnngo.com/tokyo/play/lethal-weapon-hanging-worlds-last-living-ninja-047080 | title = Lethal weapon: Hanging with the world's last living ninja | newspaper = CNN | date = 12 October 2011[/tpl]

According to Donn Draeger: "The late Fujita Seiko was the last of the living ninja, having served in assignments for the Imperial Government during the Taisho and Showa eras. No ninja exist today. Modern authorities such as T. Hatsumi are responsible for most research being done on ninjutsu."[tpl]cite book |first = Donn F. | last = Draeger | first2 = Robert W. | last2 = Smith | title = Comprehensive Asian Fighting Arts | pages = 130–131 | year = 1969 | publisher = Kodansha International Ltd.[/tpl]
