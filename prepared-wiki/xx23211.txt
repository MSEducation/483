A carrier pigeon or messenger pigeon is a homing pigeon (specifically a domesticated rock pigeon, Columba livia) that is used to carry messages. Using pigeons to carry messages is generally called "pigeon post". Most homing or racing type varieties are used to carry messages. There is no specific breed actually called "carrier pigeon". Carrier pigeons that are the basic Racing Homer were used to carry messages in World War I and World War II. Thirty-two pigeons were presented with the Dickin Medal.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pdsa.org.uk/page309_3.html |title=PDSA Dickin Medal: 'the animals' VC', Pigeons — Roll of Honour |accessdate=28 December 2008 |work= |publisher=PDSA |date=[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==History==

The sport of flying homing pigeons was well-established as early as 3000 years ago.[tpl]cite journal|last=Teale|first=Edwin|title=Mile-a-Minute Pigeons|journal=Popular Science Monthly|date=June 1936|volume=128|issue=6|pages=25ff[/tpl] They were used to proclaim the winner of the Olympics.[tpl]cite book| last =Blechman | first =Andrew | title =Pigeons-The fascinating saga of the world's most revered and reviled bird. | publisher =University of Queensland Press | year =2007 | location =St Lucia, Queensland | url =http://www.uqp.uq.edu.au/book_details.php?isbn=9780702236419| isbn =978-0-7022-3641-9 [/tpl]
Messenger pigeons were used as early as 1150 in BaghdadFirst Birds' Inn: About the Sport of Racing Pigeons and also later by Genghis Khan. By 1167 a regular service between Baghdad and Syria had been established by Sultan Nour-Eddin.[tpl]cite journal|last=Allatt|first=Captain H.T.W.|title=The Use of Pigeons as Messengers in War and the Military Pigeon Systems of Europe|journal=Royal United Service Institution|year=1886|volume=30|pages=107–148 111|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Q8tMAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=24 November 2012|publisher=W. Mitchell & Co.|location=Whitehall, London|doi=10.1080/03071848609416366|issue=133[/tpl] In Damietta, by the mouth of the Nile, the Spanish traveller Pedro Tafur saw carrier pigeons for the first time, in 1436, though he imagined that the birds made round trips, out and back."I saw there for the first time carrier pigeons, which take letters in their tail-feathers. They carry them from the place where they are bred to other places, and when the letters are detached they are set free and return to their homes. By this means the inhabitants have speedy news of all who come and go by sea or land." (Pedro Tafur, Andanças e viajes). The Republic of Genoa equipped their system of watch towers in the Mediterranean Sea with pigeon posts. Tipu Sultan used carrier pigeons. They returned to the Jamia Masjid mosque in Srirangapatna, which was his headquarters. The pigeon holes may be seen in the mosque's minarets to this day.
In 1818, a great pigeon race called the Belgian Concourse took place at Brussels. In 1860, Paul Reuter, who later founded Reuters press agency, used a fleet of over 45 pigeons to deliver news and stock prices between Brussels and Aachen, the terminals of early telegraph lines. The outcome of the Battle of Waterloo was also first delivered by a pigeon to England. During the Franco-Prussian War pigeons were used to carry mail between besieged Paris and the French unoccupied territory. 
Historically, pigeons carried messages only one way, to their home. They had to be transported manually before another flight. However, by placing their food at one location and their home at another location, pigeons have been trained to fly back and forth up to twice a day reliably, covering round-trip flights up to 160 km (100 mi).[tpl]cite book |last=National Research Council |title= Micro Livestock-Little Known Small Animals With a Promising Economic Future|year= 1991|publisher= Natl Academy Pr|location= Sumter, S.C.|isbn=0-309-04437-5 [/tpl]http://diglib.auburn.edu/gsdl/cgi-bin/library?e=d-000-00---0demo--00-0-0--0prompt-10---4------0-1l--1-en-50---20-about---00031-001-1-0utfZz-8-00&cl=CL2.1&d=HASHba5213b5f3493e1ca5e721.5.6&gc=1 Their reliability has lent itself to occasional use on mail routes, such as the Great Barrier Pigeongram Service established between Auckland, New Zealand and Great Barrier Island in November 1897."Carrier pigeons still serve; Even in modern war they do messenger duty", The New York Times. April 12, 1936. p. SM26.
With training, pigeons can carry up to 75 g (2.5 oz) on their backs. The German apothecary Julius Neubronner used carrier pigeons to deliver urgent medication.[tpl]Cite journal|ref=CITEREFLes Nouveautés Photographiques1910|title=Le pigeon voyageur photographe|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k54904907.image.r=Neubronner.f70.vignettesnaviguer.langEN|year=1910|journal=Les Nouveautés Photographiques|pages=63–71|language=French[/tpl] In 1977 a similar carrier pigeon service was set up for the transport of laboratory specimens between two English hospitals. Every morning a basket with pigeons was taken from Plymouth General Hospital to Devonport Hospital. The birds then delivered unbreakable vials back to Plymouth as needed.Pigeons flying for life, The Milwaukee Sentinel – July 23, 1977 The 30 carrier pigeons became unnecessary in 1983 because of the closure of one of the hospitals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1106&context=icwdmprobe |title=The Probe: Newsletter of the National Animal Damage Control Association, Issue 33 – June 1983 |date= |accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl] In the 1980s a similar system existed between two French hospitals located in Granville and Avranche.[tpl]url|http://web.archive.org/web/20120311215220/http://www.abc.terre.defense.gouv.fr/sites/abc.terre.defense.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/carabinier_15.pdf[/tpl]
Homing pigeons were still employed in the 21st century by certain remote police departments in Odisha state in eastern India to provide emergency communication services following natural disasters. In March 2002, it was announced that India's Police Pigeon Service messenger system in Odisha was to be retired, due to the expanded use of the Internet.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1892085.stm | work=BBC News | title=Indian pigeons lose out to e-mail | date=2002-03-26 | accessdate=2010-03-27[/tpl] The Taliban banned the keeping and/or use of homing pigeons in Afghanistan.[ref]

==Wartime use==

Before the advent of radio, carrier pigeons were frequently used on the battlefield as a means for a mobile force to communicate with a stationary headquarters. In the 6th century BC, Cyrus, king of Persia, used carrier pigeons to communicate with various parts of his empire. During the 19th-century Franco-Prussian War, besieged Parisians used carrier pigeons to transmit messages outside the city; in response, the besieging German Army employed hawks to hunt the pigeons.
During the First and Second World Wars, carrier pigeons were used to transport messages back to their home coop behind the lines.  When they landed, wires in the coop would sound a bell or buzzer and a soldier of the Signal Corps would know a message had arrived.  He would go to the coop, remove the message from the canister, and send it to its destination by telegraph, field phone, or personal messenger.
A carrier pigeon's job was dangerous. Nearby enemy soldiers often tried to shoot down pigeons, knowing that released birds were carrying important messages. Some of these pigeons became quite famous among the infantrymen they worked for.  One pigeon, named "The Mocker", flew 52 missions before he was wounded.  Another, named "Cher Ami", was injured in the last week of World War I. Though she lost her foot and one eye, her message got through, saving a large group of surrounded American infantrymen.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.homeofheroes.com/wings/part1/3b_cherami.html|title= Cher Ami – The Carrier Pigeon who saved 200 men|journal=HomeOfHeroes.com[/tpl]
