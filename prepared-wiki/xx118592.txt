CATEGORIES: Surnames

Endrizzi is an Italian family surname.
The Endrizzi surname occurs mostly in Northern Italy, in the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol alpine region. Today, the many branches of the Endrizzi family can be found in Bolzano, Trento, Sarnonico, Cavedago, Cles, Dercolo, Spormaggiore and Fai della Paganella, these last mostly in the Val di Non region (Dolomiti di Brenta), where they live since the middle 16th century. In fact, it is rather famous in the whole world, due to the quality of the Fratelli Endrizzi fine wines, founded 1885.
It is a very old family, although bearing a rare surname in Italian, which seems to be a local spelling or modification from Endrici (a variation of de Enrici, Enrico being an old Italian patronymic of German origin, Heinrich) or Endrighi, which took place ca. 1525. Endrighi is the plural form of Endrigo (the surname of a famous Italian singer, Sergio Endrigo). Other spelling variants are Endrick, Endrissi and Endricci.
The root "Endr" is probably German in origin and come from Austria or Hungary (where the related surname Endröczi appears) in the beginning of the 19th century. The Endrizzi family migrated to the New World in small numbers, mostly to Austria, Brazil and the USA.
