Wheat beer is a beer that is brewed with a large proportion of wheat in addition to malted barley. Wheat beers are usually top-fermented (as required by law in Germany).Eric Warner, German Wheat Beer. Boulder, CO: Brewers Publications, 1992. ISBN 978-0-937381-34-2 The main varieties are Weissbier (includes Hefeweizen), Witbier, and the sour varieties, such as lambic, Berliner Weisse and gose.

==Varieties==

Two common varieties of wheat beer are witbier (Dutch – "white beer") based on the Belgian tradition of using flavourings such as coriander and orange peel which was revived by Pierre Celis at the Hoegaarden Brewery,[tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PhfWmUsaOB4C&pg=PA49&dq=Pierre+Celis#v=onepage&q=Pierre%20Celis&f=false |title=Belgium and Luxembourg – Google Books |publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2009|isbn=978-1-74104-237-5|author1=Logan|first1=Leanne|last2=Cole|first2=Geert|date=2007-06-01 [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000215.html |title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter – Belgium's Great Beers |publisher=www.beerhunter.com |accessdate=17 October 2009 [/tpl] and the Celis Brewery in Austin, Texas[tpl]cite book |first1=Michael |last1=Jackson |title=Pocket Guide to Beer |type=Hardcover |page=208 |publisher=Running Press |edition=7 |date=10 August 2000 |isbn=0-7624-0885-5[/tpl] ISBN 978-0-7624-0885-6.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.austin360.com/aas/dining/beer01/celis01.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020311075809/http://www.austin360.com/aas/dining/beer01/celis01.html |archivedate=2002-03-11 |last1=Lisheron |first1=Mark |date=21 February 2001 |title=Last call for a Celis: Whether you blame the beer big boys, Texas tastes or marketing mistakes, a great little Austin brewery is gone |publisher=Austin American Statesman |accessdate=26 April 2012[/tpl] at Wayback machine[tpl]cite web |url=http://belgianbeerspecialist.blogspot.com/2011/04/pierre-celis-conversation-in-hoegaarden.html |date=20 April 2011 |first1=David |last1=Cook |title=Pierre Celis: A Conversation in Hoegaarden |work=Belgian Beer and Travel|accessdate=30 August 2011[/tpl] and weissbier (German – "white beer") based on the German tradition of mixing at least 50% wheat to barley malt to make a light coloured top-fermenting beer. Both the Belgian witbier and the German Weissbier were termed "white beers" because "wheat" has the same etymological root as "white". Belgian white beers are often made with raw unmalted wheat, as opposed to the malted wheat used in other varieties.
German wheat beers are called "Weizen" (wheat) in the western (Baden-Württemberg) and northern regions, and "Weissbier" or "Weisse" (white beer or white) in Bavaria. [tpl]anchor|Hefeweizen[/tpl][tpl]anchor|Kristallweizen[/tpl]Hefeweizen (the prefix "Hefe" is German for yeast) is the name for unfiltered wheat beers, while Kristallweizen ("Kristall" being German for crystal) is the same beer filtered.
Breweries in other countries, particularly the U.S. and Canada, will brew wheat beers based on these two main traditions, but usually with greater variation.[tpl]Cite book|title=How to Brew: Ingredients, Methods, Recipes, and Equipment for Brewing Beer at Home|last=Palmer|first=John|publisher=Defenestrative Pub Co|year=2001|isbn=0-9710579-0-7[/tpl][tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=American Wheat Beers: Heritage and History|url=http://www.anchorbrewing.com/blog/american-wheat-beers-heritage-and-history/|work=Brewing Insights Blog|publisher=Anchor Brewing Company|accessdate=26 February 2014[/tpl] 
Sour beers such as Berliner Weisse, gose, and lambic are made with a significant proportion of wheat.
In Britain, wheat beer is not considered traditional, but several brewers produce cask-conditioned varieties, such as  Oakleaf Eichenblatt Bitte, Hoskins White Dolphin, Fyfe Weiss Squad and Oakham White Dwarf. British wheat beer tends to be a hybrid of the continental style with an English bitter, rather than an exact emulation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.realbeer.com/library/authors/tierney-jones-a/wheatbeer.php |title=Adrian Tierney-Jones |publisher=Realbeer.com |accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000717.html |title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter |publisher=Beerhunter.com |accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl]
Wheat beers are commonly marketed as spring or summer seasonal products.

===Weizenbier [tpl]anchor|Weizenbier[/tpl]===

Weizenbier or Hefeweizen, in the southern parts of Bavaria usually called [tpl]anchor|Weissbier[/tpl]Weissbier ("white beer"), is a Bavarian beer in which a significant proportion of malted barley is replaced with malted wheat. By German law, weissbiers brewed in Germany must be top-fermented. Specialized strains of yeast are used which produce overtones of banana and clove as by-products of fermentation. Weissbier is so called because it was, at the time of its inception, paler in colour than Munich brown beer. It is well known throughout Germany, though better known as weizen ("wheat") outside Bavaria. The terms Hefeweizen ("yeast wheat") or Hefeweissbier refer to wheat beer in its traditional, unfiltered form. The term Kristallweizen (crystal wheat), or kristall weiss (crystal white beer), refers to a wheat beer that is filtered to remove the yeast from suspension. Additionally, the filtration process removes wheat proteins present in the beer which contribute to its cloudy appearance.
The Hefeweizen style is particularly noted for its low hop bitterness (about 15 IBUs) and relatively high carbonation (approaching four volumes), considered important to balance the beer's relatively malty sweetness. Another balancing flavour note unique to Hefeweizen beer is its phenolic character; its signature phenol is 4-vinyl guaiacol,[tpl]Cite journal|last=Donaghy|first=John A.|coauthors=Paul F. Kelly, Alan McKay|title=Conversion of ferulic acid to 4-vinyl guaiacol by yeasts isolated from unpasteurised apple juice|journal=Society of Chemical Industry|date=15 October 1998|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/61003783/ABSTRACT|accessdate=28 July 2010|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0010(19990301)79:33.0.CO;2-H[/tpl] a metabolite of ferulic acid, the result of fermentation by top-fermenting yeast appropriate for the style. Hefeweizen's phenolic character has been described as "clove" and "medicinal" ("Band-aid") but also smoky. Other more typical but less assertive flavour notes produced by Weissbier yeast include "banana" (amyl acetate), "bubble gum", and sometimes "vanilla" (vanillin).
Weissbier is available in a number of other forms including Dunkelweizen (dark wheat) and Weizenstarkbier (strong wheat beer), commonly referred to as Weizenbock. The dark wheat varieties are made with darker, more highly-kilned malts (both wheat and barley). The Weizenbocks typically have a much higher alcohol content than their lighter cousins.
The three major brands in Germany are Erdinger, Paulaner and Franziskaner. Other renowned brands are Weihenstephan, Schneider, Maisel and Andechser. Regional brands in Bavaria are Hopf, Unertl, Ayinger, Schweiger and Plank. The style is currently consumed throughout Germany, but is especially popular in Bavaria.

===Witbier===

Witbier, white beer, bière blanche, or simply witte is a barley/wheat, top-fermented beer brewed mainly in Belgium and the Netherlands. It gets its name due to suspended yeast and wheat proteins which cause the beer to look hazy, or white, when cold. It is a descendant from those medieval beers which were not brewed with hops, but instead flavoured and preserved with a blend of spices and other plants referred to as "gruit". Gruit is still used today, although nowadays the gruit consists mainly of coriander, orange, bitter orange, and hops. The taste is therefore only slightly hoppy. The beers have a somewhat sour taste due to the presence of lactic acid. In the past, the Belgian wheat beers were much more sour than is the case now.[tpl]cite web|url=http://morebeer.com/brewingtechniques/library/styles/2_4style.html |title=BT - Witbier: Belgian White |publisher=Morebeer.com |accessdate=2013-08-14[/tpl] The suspended yeast in the beer causes some continuing fermentation in the bottle.
Witbier differs from other varieties of wheat beer in the use of gruit. French regulation (part of the territory was French in the 14th century) excluded the use of hops in gruit. Witbier can be made with raw wheat, in addition to wheat malt.Belgian Witbier[tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L8RwjqUKLygC&pg=PT101&dq=Witbier+raw+wheat#v=onepage&q=Witbier%20raw%20wheat&f=false |title=Handbook of Brewing: Processes ... – Google Books |publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2009|isbn=978-3-527-31674-8|author1=Eßlinger|first1=Hans Michael|date=2009-06-30 [/tpl]
In recent times, some Belgian brewers have been making fruit flavoured wheat beers.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl]

===Sour varieties===

A minor variety of wheat beer is represented by Berliner Weisse (Berlin White), which is low in alcohol (2.5% to 3% ABV) and quite tart. Although it can be imbibed by itself, enthusiasts often add sweetened syrups of lemon, raspberry or woodruff herb into the beer.
Leipziger Gose is similar to Berliner Weisse but slightly stronger at around 4% ABV. Its ingredients include coriander and salt, which are unusual for German beers. Both Gose and Berliner Weisse acquire their sourness through the use of lactic acid bacteria in the fermentation in addition to yeast.
The Belgian lambic is also made with wheat and barley, but differs from witbier in its yeast. Lambic is a brew of spontaneous fermentation.

==Names and types==

According to the place in which the beer is brewed and small variations on the recipe, several different names are used for wheat beer:

==Serving==

Bavarian-style wheat beer is usually served in 500 ml, vase-shaped glasses. In Belgium, witbier is usually served in a 25cl glass; each brewery (Hoegaarden, Dentergems, etc.) has its own shape of glass. Berliner Weisse is often served in a schooner.
Kristallweizen (especially in Austria) and American styles of wheat beer are sometimes served with a slice of lemon or orange in the glass; this is generally frowned upon in Bavaria.
In northern Bavaria, it is common to add a grain of rice to kristallweizen, which causes a gentle bubbling effect and results in a longer lasting foam.Weizenbier or wheat beer[tpl]dead link|date=August 2013[/tpl]
A common item on pub menus in Bavaria is cola-weizen, which is a mix of cola and weizenbier.
Another mixture popular during the summer is a radler variant with a 50–50 mix of Weissbier with lemonade called "Russ", which is the German term for Russian.
In different parts of Germany bananenweizen (wheat beer with banana nectar mixed in) is very popular.
How to pour a wheat beer is also important to serving. First, clean your glasses (which is not only for wheat beer, but all kinds of beer glasses need to be washed with clean water and dried up right away. It will improve beer's flavor and taste.[tpl]cite book|last=Ojugo|first=Clement|title=Practical food & beverage cost control|year=2010|publisher=Delmar, Cengage Learning|location=Clifton Park, NY|isbn=9781428335448|page=172|edition=2nd ed.[/tpl] ) Second, hold the glass on an angle, and pour the wheat beer slowly. Third, with about 10% or 15% of beer left in the bottle, swirl it smoothly to mix the yeast and beer together. Finally, pour the remaining beer in your glass. This process will help to improve the flavor, scent and appearance of your wheat beer.

==Sensory profile==

Weissbiers feature fermentation by-products such as esters (which lend fruity flavors and aromas), especially isoamyl acetate, reminiscent of bananas, and the phenolic compound guaiacol, a metabolite of ferulic acid, which smells and tastes like cloves. Other phenolics sometimes found in Weissbiers evoke medicinal or smoky sensations. The bittering level of most Weissbiers is close to 15 International Bitterness Units, a very low level. Hop flavor and aroma are typically low.
The ester and phenolic aspects are produced by the special type of yeast, rather than the high fraction of wheat in the grain bill. 
The carbonation level can range from 5.5 grams per liter (approximately 2.7 volumes; slightly higher than that of most other German beers) to 7 grams per liter, or more. This produces a generous stand of foam, especially in light of the high protein content of wheat malt.
