CATEGORIES: St. Louis Cardinals seasons, 1982 Major League Baseball season, National League East champion seasons, National League champion seasons, World Series champion seasons

The St. Louis Cardinals' 1982 season was the team's 101st season in St. Louis, Missouri and the 91st season in the National League. Making up for the previous year's near-miss, the Cardinals went 92-70 during the season and won their first-ever National League East Division title by three games over the Philadelphia Phillies. They defeated the National League West champion Atlanta Braves in three straight games to claim their first NL pennant since 1968.  From there, they went on to win the World Series in seven games over the American League champion Milwaukee Brewers.  It was the Cardinals' first World Championship since 1967, and their last until they opened the current Busch Stadium in 2006.
