Thomas III of Saluzzo ([tpl]lang-it|Tommaso III di Saluzzo[/tpl]) (1356â€“1416) was Marquess of Saluzzo from 1396 until his death.
He was born in Saluzzo in north-western Italy to Frederick II del Vasto and Beatrice of Geneva. His maternal grandfather was Hugh of Geneva, Lord of Gex, Anthon and Varey.
He tried to continue the philo-French politics of his father, mainly to face the menace of Duke Amadeus VIII of Savoy, who aimed to conquer the whole Piedmont. In fact, the treaty stating the nominal submission to France was signed by Thomas well before his father's death.
The vassallage to French was also a consequence of the education received by Thomas, who lived in Provence for much of his youth, and travelled there in 1375, 1389, 1401, 1403 and 1405. He was married to the French Marguerite of Roussy.
In 1394 he was captured by Savoyard troops while he was leading a ravage in Monasterolo. Imprisoned first in Savigliano and then in Turin, he was freed only two years later after a ransom of 20,000 golden florins had been paid.
In his late years Thomas assigned the succession to his young son Ludovico, under the regence of his brother Valerano and the marquesses Marguerite.

==Culture==

A man of great culture, Thomas was the author of one of the most important chivalry texts of the Middle Ages, Le Chevalier Errant, written probably during his imprisonment in Piedmont. The text, written in French, is an allegory of the chevalleresque ideals. It inspired the famous frescoes in the Castello della Manta.

==Marriage and children==

He married Marguerite of Pierrepont. She was a daughter of Hugo II, Count of Roncy and Braine. They had five children:
He also had at least three children with his mistress, Olmeta de Soglio:
The existence of illegitimate daughter Elena of Saluzzo is disputed.
