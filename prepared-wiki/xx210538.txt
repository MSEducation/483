The Battle of Morar was a Scottish clan battle fought in 1602, near Loch Morar, in the Scottish Highlands.’Conflicts of the Clans’ published in 1764 by the Foulis press, written from a manuscript wrote in the reign of James VI of Scotland. http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/conflict/  It was fought between the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry against the Clan Mackenzie who were supported by the Clan Ross."A History of the Clan Mackenzie by Alexander Mackenzie.
A feud took place between the Mackenzies, led by Kenneth Mackenzie, 1st Lord Mackenzie of Kintail and the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry. The Mackenzies wanted the MacDonell Laird of Glengarry to appear before the Justice court at Edinburgh for previous crimes against them. Meanwhile two MacDonells were killed. Glengarry MacDonell did not appear in court on the arranged date but went about his own hand to revenge the slaughter of his clansmen.  As he did not appear in court the Mackenzies wasted the MacDonell country of Morar. The two sides met and a battle took place with great slaughter on both sides. According to historian Alexander Mackenzie the Clan Mackenzie were supported by the Clan Ross at the battle of Morar. This was due to Kenneth Mackenzie, 1st Lord Mackenzie of Kintail being married to Ann Ross daughter of George Ross of Balnagowan, chief of Clan Ross. After this they came to an agreement to obtain peace where Glengarry MacDonald was glad to requite and renounce to the Lord MacKenzie of Kintail, and give him the inheritance of the lands of Strome.
