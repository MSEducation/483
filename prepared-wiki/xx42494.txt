Chur or Coire (pronounced [tpl]IPA-de|ˈkuːr|[/tpl] in Graubünden and outside of Switzerland but [tpl]IPA-de|ˈxuːr|[/tpl] in other cantons of Switzerland; [tpl]lang-gsw|Khûr[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-rm|Cuira[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-rm|ˈkwerɐ|[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA-rm|ˈkwoi̯rɐ|[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-it|Coira[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-it|ˈkɔi̯ɾa|[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-fr|Coire[/tpl] [tpl]IPA-fr|ˈkwaʁ|[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-la|CVRIA[/tpl], [tpl]lang|la|CVRIA RHAETORVM[/tpl] and [tpl]lang|la|CVRIA RAETORVM[/tpl]) is the capital of the Swiss canton of Graubünden and lies in the northern part of the canton. Chur is situated at the right shore of the Rhine River and is known as the oldest town of Switzerland.

==History==

Archaeological evidence of settlement at the site, in the Eastern Alps, goes back as far as the Pfyn culture[tpl]HDS|1581-3-1|Pre-Roman History[/tpl] (3900-3500 BC),Schibler, J. 2006. The economy and environment of the 4th and 3rd millennia BC in the northern Alpine foreland based on studies of animal bones. Environmental Archaeology 11(1): 49-65 making Chur one of the oldest settlements in Switzerland. Remains and objects from the Bronze and Iron Ages have been found also in the eastern sector of the current city's centre.
The Roman Empire conquered Raetia in 15 BC.  Under emperor Diocletian (late 3rd century AD), the existing settlement of Curia Raetorum was made the capital of the newly established province of Raetia prima.Raetia, Page at Switzerland's Historical Dictionary [tpl]it icon[/tpl]
In the 4th century Chur became the seat of the first Christian bishopric north of the Alps. Despite a legend assigning its foundation to an alleged Briton king, St. Lucius, the first known bishop is one AsinioReligious life in the Alps, Switzerland Historial Dictionary [tpl]it icon[/tpl] in 451 AD. 
After the invasion of the Ostrogoths, it was rechristened Theodoricopolis; in the 6th century it was conquered by the Franks.Franks, page at Switzerland Historical Ditionary The city suffered several invasions, by the Magyars in 925-926, when the cathedral was destroyed, and by the Saracens (940 and 954), but afterwards it flourished thanks to its location, where the roads from several major Alpine transit routes come together and continue down the Rhine river. The routes had been already used under the Romans but acquired greater importance under the Ottonian dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire. Emperor Otto I appointed his vassal Hartpert as bishop of Chur in 958, giving the bishopric numerous privileges. In 1170 the bishop became a prince-bishop and kept total control over the road between Chur and Chiavenna.
In the 13th century the town had some 1,300 inhabitants, and was surrounded by a line of walls. In 1367 the foundation of the Three Leagues in the area was a first step towards Chur's autonomy: a burgmeister (mayor) is first mentioned in 1413, and the bishop's residence was attacked by the inhabitants in 1418 and 1422, when a series of concessions were wrung out of him.  Chur was the chief town of the Gotteshausbund or Chadé (League of the House of God), and one of the places the Leagues' assemblies met regularly. As the power of the bishops, now increasingly under the influence of the nearby Habsburg County of Tyrol, decreased, in 1464 the citizens wrote a constitution which was adopted as the rule for the local guilds and political positions. In 1489 Chur obtained the right to have a tribunal of its own, but never had the title of Free Imperial City. Chur adhered to the Reformation in the 16th century, and the Catholic bishopric had to leave the city in 1524. In the same century the German language started to prevail over Romansh. Despite two fires in 1464 and 1574, the city developed economically until the Thirty Years' War, when it was destroyed and struck by plagues.
During the period of the Republic of the Three Leagues in Graubünden (ca. 1400-1797), Chur was the chief town of the Gotteshausbund or Chadé (League of the House of God), and one of the places the Leagues' assemblies met regularly. The guild constitution of the city of Chur lasted until 1839, while in 1874 the Burgergemeinde was replaced by an Einwohnergemeinde. When Graubünden became a canton in 1803, Chur was chosen as its capital.

==Geography==

Chur has an area, [tpl]As of|2006|lc=on[/tpl], of [tpl]convert|28|km2|sqmi|sp=us[/tpl].  Of this area, 18.8% is used for agricultural purposes, while 52% is forested.  Of the rest of the land, 25.1% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (4.1%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains).
Chur is situated at a height of [tpl]convert|1949|ft|m|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea-level, on the right bank of the Plessur torrent, just as it issues from the Schanfigg valley, and about a mile above its junction with the Rhine, almost entirely surrounded by the Alps, overshadowed by the Mittenberg (east) and Pizokel (south), hills that guard the entrance to the deep-cut Schanfigg valley.
The altitude in the city area varies from [tpl]convert|600|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl] above sea level to [tpl]convert|1800|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl] above sea level, the Churer Hausberg Brambrüesch (accessible from the Old Town)  situated at [tpl]convert|2174|m|ft|sp=us[/tpl] above sea level.
The water of Chur's spring is exported and sold as Passugger mineral water.

==Main sights==

The modern part of the city is to the west, while the old portion, with all the historical buildings, is to the east. Here is the cathedral church of St Luzius (who is the patron saint of Coire, and is supposed to be a 2nd-century British king Lucius, though in reality the name probably arose from a confusion between Lucius of Cyrene, miswritten curiensis, with the Roman general Lucius Munatius Plancus, who conquered Raetia).
Built between 1178 and 1282, on the site of an older church, it contains many curious medieval antiquities (especially in the sacristy), as well as a picture by Angelica Kauffman, and the tomb of the great Grisons political leader (d. 1637) Jenatsch. Opposite is the Bishop's Palace, and not far off, is the Episcopal Seminary (built on the ruins of a 6th-century monastic foundation). Not far from these ancient monuments is the new Raetian Museum, which contains an extensive collection of objects relating to Raetia (including the geological collections of the Benedictine monk of Disentis Abbey, Placidus a Spescha (1752–1833), who explored the high snowy regions around the sources of the Rhine). One of the hospitals was founded by the famous Capuchin philanthropist, Theodosius Florentini (1808–1865), who was for a long time the Romanist cure of Coire, and whose remains were in 1906 transferred from the cathedral here to Ingenbohl (near Schwyz), his chief foundation. The Romano-Gothic cathedral, where lie the remains of Jörg Jenatsch, was begun by Bishop Tello (758-73), and has a highly interesting crypt; it contains some remarkable paintings by Dürer and Holbein.
Chur is home to many buildings or other sites that are listed as Swiss heritage sites of national significance.  There are two archeological sites in Chur, the old city which is a medieval city and Welschdörfli a prehistoric settlement and Roman Vicus.

There are 15 other buildings that are also heritage sites; these include the Alte Kaserne at Zeughaus 3 (the Old Armory), the Confederation Paper Mill, the Main Post Office, the new Town Hall, headquarters of the Rhätischen Bahn and several old patrician houses.Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance 21.11.2008 version, [tpl]de icon[/tpl] accessed 27-Oct-2009

==Transportation==

Chur is [tpl]convert|120|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] by rail from Zürich, and is the meeting-point of the routes from Italy over many alpine passes (Lukmanier Pass, Splugen Pass, and San Bernardino Pass), as well as from the Engadine (Albula Pass, Julier Pass), so that it is the centre of an active trade (particularly in wine from the Valtelline), though it also has a few local factories.
The city's main railway station is where the Swiss Federal Railways system link with that of the Rhaetian Railway (RhB). While the SBB lines serve most of Switzerland, most of Graubünden's internal rail traffic is served by RhB lines. One of the RhB lines (to Arosa) uses on-street running through streets in the centre of Chur and Sand in order to reach the station - see Chur stadtbahn.
There are three other railway stations in Chur:
There is also a postbus station situated above the railway station.
Chur is linked by a motorway—the A13.
