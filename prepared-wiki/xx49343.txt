Drowning is death through respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid. Near drowning is the survival of a drowning event involving unconsciousness or water inhalation and can lead to serious secondary complications or death, possibly up to 72 hours after the event.Lunetta, P. & Modell, J.H.

Drowning itself is quick and silent, although it may be preceded by distress which is more visible.[tpl]cite web|last=Vittone|first=Aviation Survival Technician First Class Mario|title="It Doesn't Look Like They're Drowning": How To Recognize the Instinctive Drowning Response|url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg534/On%20Scene/OSFall06.pdf|publisher=On Scene (journal of US Coastguard search and rescue)|accessdate=2010-12-29|coauthors=Pia, Francesco Ph.D.|page=14|date=Fall 2006[/tpl] A person drowning is unable to shout or call for help, or seek attention, as they cannot obtain enough air.

Drowning is the 3rd leading cause of unintentional injury or death worldwide, accounting for 7% of all injury related deaths (est. 388,000 deaths by drowning in 2004, excluding those due to natural disasters), with 96% of these deaths occurring in low-income and middle-income countries.[tpl]cite web|title=Fact sheet N°347, November 2010: "Drowning"|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs347/en/index.html|publisher=World Health organization|accessdate=2010-12-30[/tpl] In many countries, drowning is one of the leading causes of death for children under 12 years old.  For example, in the United States of America, it is the second leading cause of death (after motor vehicle crashes) in children 12 and younger.Centers for Disease Control,Resources for TV Writers and Producers The rate of drowning in populations around the world varies widely according to their access to water, the climate and the national swimming culture.

The WHO further recommended "Drowning outcomes should be classified as: death, morbidity, and no morbidity. There was also consensus that the terms wet, dry, active, passive, silent, and secondary drowning should no longer be used."

==Classification==

Experts differentiate between distress and drowning. They also divide drowning into passive and active:

==Signs and symptoms==

Drowning is most often quick and unspectacular. Its media depictions as a loud, violent struggle have much more in common with distressed non-swimmers, who may well drown but have not yet begun. In particular, an asphyxiating person is seldom able to call for help.Mario Vittoine, Francesco Pia: "It Doesn’t Look Like They’re Drowning: How To Recognize the Instinctive Drowning Response", On Scene, Fall 2006, p. 14. The instinctive drowning response covers many signs or behaviors associated with drowning or near-drowning:
Pia notes that drowning begins at the point a person is unable to keep their mouth above water; inhalation of water takes place at a later stage.[tpl]cite book|last=Fletemeyer|first=John|title=Drowning: new perspectives on intervention and prevention, Volume 1998|year=1999|pages=234|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Xcnwm8zE24QC&dq=drowning+new+perspectives+on+intervention+and+prevention|coauthors=Pia (Chapter author)|chapter=Chapter 14 ("Reflections on Lifeguard surveillance programs")|isbn=978-1-57444-223-6[/tpl] Most people demonstrating the instinctive drowning response do not show prior evidence of distress.

==Cause==

Approximately 90% of drownings take place in freshwater (rivers, lakes and swimming pools) and 10% in seawater. Drownings in other fluids is rare, and often relates to industrial accidents.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl]
People have drowned in as little as 30 mm of water lying face down, in at least one case in a wheel rut.[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2011[/tpl]  Children have drowned in baths, buckets and toilets; inebriates or those under the influence of drugs have died in puddles.
Drowning can also happen in ways that are less well known:

==Pathophysiology==

A continued lack of oxygen in the brain, hypoxia, will quickly render a victim unconscious usually around a blood partial pressure of oxygen of 25–30 mmHg. An unconscious victim rescued with an airway still sealed from laryngospasm stands a good chance of a full recovery. Artificial respiration is also much more effective without water in the lungs. At this point the victim stands a good chance of recovery if attended to within minutes. Latent hypoxia is a special condition leading to unconsciousness where the partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs under pressure at the bottom of a deep free-dive is adequate to support consciousness but drops below the blackout threshold as the water pressure decreases on the ascent, usually close to the surface as the pressure approaches normal atmospheric pressure.  A blackout on ascent like this is called a deep water blackout.
The brain cannot survive long without oxygen and the continued lack of oxygen in the blood combined with the cardiac arrest will lead to the deterioration of brain cells causing first brain damage and eventually brain death from which recovery is generally considered impossible.
A lack of oxygen or chemical changes in the lungs may cause the heart to stop beating; this cardiac arrest stops the flow of blood and thus stops the transport of oxygen to the brain. Cardiac arrest used to be the traditional point of death but at this point there is still a chance of recovery. The brain will die after approximately six minutes without oxygen but special conditions may prolong this.
As well as the direct effect of oxygen deprivation, there are also dangerous effects on blood chemistry if water is taken into the lungs. The mechanism for this is different for fresh and seawater.
Autopsies on human drowning victims show no indications of these effects and there appears to be little difference between drownings in salt water and fresh water. After death, rigor mortis will set in and remains for about two days, depending on many factors including water temperature.

===Reflex reactions to immersion===

Submerging the face in water cooler than about [tpl]convert|21|°C|°F[/tpl] triggers the mammalian diving reflex, found in mammals, and especially in marine mammals such as whales and seals. This reflex protects the body by putting it into energy saving mode to maximize the time it can stay under water. The strength of this reflex is greater in colder water and has three principal effects:
The reflex action is automatic and allows both a conscious and an unconscious person to survive longer without oxygen under water than in a comparable situation on dry land. The exact mechanism for this effect has been debated and may be a result of brain cooling similar to the protective effects seen in patients treated with deep hypothermia.[tpl]cite journal |author=Lundgren, Claus EG; Ferrigno, Massimo (eds). |title=Physiology of Breath-hold Diving. 31st Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society Workshop |volume=UHMS Publication Number 72(WS-BH)4-15-87. |publisher=Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society |year=1985 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7992 |accessdate=2009-04-24[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Mackensen GB, McDonagh DL, Warner DS |title=Perioperative hypothermia: use and therapeutic implications |journal=J. Neurotrauma |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=342–58 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19231924 |doi=10.1089/neu.2008.0596[/tpl]
In very cold or freezing water reflex reactions can be lethal instead, killing up to 70% of people within 15–30 minutes, as they give rise first to cold shock, a combination of uncontrolled gasping and massively increased blood pressure with possible cardiac arrest, followed by the rapid loss of control of bodily functions needed for swimming and gripping. (see cold water immersion below)

===Oxygen deprivation===

A conscious victim will hold his or her breath (see Apnea) and will try to access air, often resulting in panic, including rapid body movement.  This uses up more oxygen in the blood stream and reduces the time to unconsciousness.  The victim can voluntarily hold his or her breath for some time, but the breathing reflex will increase until the victim will try to breathe, even when submerged.[tpl]cite book|last=Gorman|first=Mark|editor=Jose Biller|title=Interface of Neurology and Internal Medicine|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SRIvmTVcYBwC&pg=PA702|accessdate=9 May 2013|year=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-7906-7|pages=702–706[/tpl][tpl]rp|702[/tpl]
The breathing reflex in the human body is weakly related to the amount of oxygen in the blood but strongly related to the amount of carbon dioxide (see Hypercapnia). During apnea, the oxygen in the body is used by the cells, and excreted as carbon dioxide.  Thus, the level of oxygen in the blood decreases, and the level of carbon dioxide increases. Increasing carbon dioxide levels lead to a stronger and stronger breathing reflex, up to the breath-hold breakpoint, at which the victim can no longer voluntarily hold his or her breath. This typically occurs at an arterial  partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 55 mm Hg, but may differ significantly from individual to individual and can be increased through training.
The breath-hold break point can be suppressed or delayed either intentionally or unintentionally.  Hyperventilation before any dive, deep or shallow, flushes out carbon dioxide in the blood resulting in a dive commencing with an abnormally low carbon dioxide level; a potentially dangerous condition known as hypocapnia.  The level of carbon dioxide in the blood after hyperventilation may then be insufficient to trigger the breathing reflex later in the dive and a blackout may occur without warning and before the diver feels any urgent need to breathe.  This can occur at any depth and is common in distance breath-hold divers in swimming pools.  Hyperventilation is often used by both deep and distance free-divers to flush out carbon dioxide from the lungs to suppress the breathing reflex for longer. It is important not to mistake this for an attempt to increase the body's oxygen store.  The body at rest is fully oxygenated by normal breathing and cannot take on any more.  Breath holding in water should always be supervised by a second person, as by hyperventilating, one increases the risk of shallow water blackout because insufficient carbon dioxide levels in the blood fail to trigger the breathing reflex.

===Water inhalation===

If water enters the airways of a conscious victim, the victim will try to cough up the water or swallow it, thus inhaling more water involuntarily.  Upon water entering the airways, both conscious and unconscious victims experience laryngospasm, that is the larynx or the vocal cords in the throat constrict and seal the air tube.  This prevents water from entering the lungs. Because of this laryngospasm, water enters the stomach in the initial phase of drowning and very little water enters the lungs. Unfortunately, this can interfere with air entering the lungs, too. In most victims, the laryngospasm relaxes some time after unconsciousness and water can enter the lungs causing a "wet drowning".  However, about 7–10% of victims maintain this seal until cardiac arrest. This was called "dry drowning", as no water enters the lungs.  In forensic pathology, water in the lungs indicates that the victim was still alive at the point of submersion. Absence of water in the lungs may be either a dry drowning or indicates a death before submersion.[tpl]cite book|author1=Dominick DiMaio|author2=Vincent J.M.

===Cold water immersion===

Cold water has a number of effects on drowning and survival. Hypothermia (loss of core body temperature) is the best known, but the body can endure lowered temperatures for a considerable time, and also protects itself by moving blood circulation to protect the core.
Heat transfers very well through water, and body heat is therefore lost extremely quickly in water compared to air,[tpl]cite journal |author=Sterba, JA |title=Field Management of Accidental Hypothermia during Diving |journal=US Naval Experimental Diving Unit Technical Report |volume=NEDU-1-90 |year=1990 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4248 |accessdate=2008-06-11 [/tpl] even in merely 'cool' swimming waters around 70F (~20C).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.usps.org/national/ensign/uspscompass/compassarchive/compassv1n1/hypothermia.htm|accessdate=2008-02-19|title=Hypothermia safety|publisher=United States Power Squadrons|date=January 23, 2007[/tpl] A water temperature of [tpl]convert|10|C|F[/tpl] can lead to death in as little as one hour, and water temperatures hovering at freezing can lead to death in as little as 15 minutes. This is because cold water can have other lethal effects on the body, so hypothermia is not usually a reason for drowning or the clinical cause of death for those who drown in cold water.
The actual cause of death in cold or very cold water are usually lethal bodily reactions to increased heat loss and to freezing water, rather than any loss of core body temperature. Of those who die after plunging into freezing seas, around 20% die within 2 minutes from cold shock (uncontrolled rapid breathing and gasping causing water inhalation, massive increase in blood pressure and cardiac strain leading to cardiac arrest, and panic), another 50% die within 15 – 30 minutes from cold incapacitation (loss of use and control of limbs and hands for swimming or gripping, as the body 'protectively' shuts down the peripheral muscles of the limbs to protect its core), and exhaustion and unconsciousness cause drowning, claiming the rest within a similar time. A notable example of this occurred during the sinking of the Titanic, in which most people who entered the [tpl]convert|-2|C|F[/tpl] water died within 15–30 minutes.Sinking of the RMS Titanic#CITEREFButler1998
Hypothermia (and also cardiac arrest) present a risk for survivors of immersion, as for survivors of exposure; in particular the risk increases if the survivor, feeling well again, tries to get up and move, not realizing their core body temperature is still very low and will take a long time to recover.

==Management==

Rescue involves bringing the person's mouth and nose above the water surface. A drowning person may cling to the rescuer and try to pull himself out of the water, submerging the rescuer in the process. Thus it is advised that the rescuer approach with a buoyant object, or from behind, twisting the person's arm on the back to restrict movement. If the rescuer does get pushed under water, they should dive downwards to escape the person.
After a successful approach, negatively buoyant objects such as a weight belt are removed. The priority is then to transport the person to the water's edge in preparation for removal from the water. The person is turned on their back with a secure grip used to tow from behind. If the person is cooperative they may be towed in a similar fashion held at the armpits. If the person is unconscious they may be pulled in a similar fashion held at the chin and cheeks, ensuring that the mouth and nose are well above the water.
Special care has to be taken for people with suspected spinal injuries, and a back board (spinal board) may be needed for the rescue. In water, CPR is ineffective, and the goal should be to bring the person to a stable ground quickly and then to start CPR. Once on ground chest compressions are performed by the "A-B-C" scheme (Airway opening-Breaths-Compressions).http://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@ecc/documents/downloadable/ucm_317350.pdf  100% oxygen is neither recommended nor discouraged.[tpl]cite journal| authorlink = ILCOR| date =  November 29, 2005 |   title = 2005 ILCOR resuscitation guidelines| journal = Circulation| volume = 112| issue = 22 supplement| doi = 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.166480| url = http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/reprint/112/22_suppl/III-115.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = 2008-02-17| quote = There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of oxygen by the first aid provider.| doi_brokendate = 2008-06-28[/tpl] Treatment for hypothermia may also be necessary.
The Heimlich maneuver is not recommended;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000046.htm the technique may have relevance in situations where airways are obstructed by solids but not fluids. Performing the maneuver on drowning people not only delays ventilation but may induce vomiting, which if aspirated will place the patient in a far worse situation. Moreover, the use of the Heimlich maneuver in any choking situation involving solids or fluids has become controversial and is generally no longer taught.  For more information on this debate refer to the article Henry Heimlich.
Because of the mammalian diving reflex (see above), person submerged in cold water and apparently drowned may revive after a relatively long period. In one case, a child submerged in cold ([tpl]convert|37|°F|°C[/tpl]) water for 66 minutes was resuscitated without neurological damage.[tpl]cite book|last=McKenna|first=Kim D.|title=Mosby's paramedic textbook|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PJyhIH8N8qgC&pg=PA1264|accessdate=9 May 2013|year=2011|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-0-323-07275-5|pages=1262–1266[/tpl] Rescuers retrieving a child from water significantly below body temperature should attempt resuscitation even after protracted immersion.

===Surveillance===

Many pools and designated bathing areas either have lifeguards, a pool safety camera system for local or remote monitoring, or computer-aided drowning detection.  However, bystanders play an important role in drowning detection and either intervention or the notification of authorities by phone or alarm.

===RID factors===

The acronym RID was originated by Frank Pia to summarize important reasons why lifeguards may be unaware of a drowning. The term stands for "failure to recognize the struggle, the intrusion of non-lifeguard duties upon lifeguards' primary task-preventive lifeguarding, and the distraction from surveillance duties".[tpl]cite web | url=http://pia-enterprises.com/rid.rtf | title=The RID factor as a cause of drowning | accessdate=October 1, 2012 | author=Pia, Frank[/tpl] – published June 1984, Parks & Recreation  In his paper on the RID factors, Pia makes a number of observations on the role, and the required behavior and training, of lifeguards, as well as the importance of administrators directing lifeguards to this role and avoiding double tasking them (due to the very brief time of 20 – 60 seconds required for drowning to occur). He ended by summarizing the role of lifeguards as guardians of life, and that they should be directed exclusively to this duty and none other, while on surveillance, due to the high value placed on human life.
