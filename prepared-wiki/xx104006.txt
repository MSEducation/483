==Fictional character biography==

===First Crazy Quilt===

Crazy-Quilt is a noted painter who leads a double-life as a master criminal. He gives the plans for his crimes to various henchmen through clues left in his paintings. His criminal empire crashes to a halt when one of his henchmen double-crosses him. Blinded by a gunshot wound, he volunteers for an experimental procedure that restores his vision, but is unfortunately left unable to see anything but bright colors. "Boy Commandos" #15, (1946) In his second published appearance, this is combined with a special helmet that emits bright colored lights, enabling him to see under most circumstances. "Boy Commandos" #18, (1946)
The procedure works to a point, but has a tragic side effect: he can see, but the colors are blindingly vivid and disorienting. It drives him mad, and upon his release he takes on the guise of Crazy-Quilt. He is stopped first by the Boy Commandos, but has since had encounters with Batman, Batgirl and two Robins: Dick Grayson and Jason Todd.
In 1963 issue of Blackhawk, criminal Paul Dekker impersonates Quilt, but the title heroes expose the impostor.Blackhawk #180 (December, 1963) As a result of this appearance, some resources report the original Crazy-Quilt's true identity as Dekker. This includes at least one comic, the Kevin Smith-penned Batman: The Widening Gyre #4. However, the earlier Batman Encyclopedia, another official source endorsed by DC Comics, states that Dekker is a separate character from Quilt. The Essential Batman Encyclopedia, p. 98
Crazy-Quilt's sight is restored briefly for a time after he kidnaps a surgeon to assist him. Batman and Grayson intervene. In self-defense, Robin reflects the madman's light beams back into his newly restored eyes. Unintentionally, Quilt is permanently blinded. Obsessing over his young adversary, he becomes one of the few bat-villains to hate Robin more than his mentor. This extends to Grayson's successors in the role. Later, thinking to enact his revenge upon Grayson, he mistakenly takes out his aggression on Jason Todd, who was new to the role at the time. Todd is nearly beaten to death. Again, it is Robin who is pivotal to stopping Crazy Quilt's plans.
Crazy-Quilt appears in the Belle Reve riot in Justice League #34, lugging around the eviscerated body of the prison warden. The prisoners, along with much of humanity, were being affected by the entity Mageddon. It had affected fellow prisoner, telepath Hector Hammond, who then altered the minds of the inmates. "Justice League" #34 (1999)
He also has a role in one of the many reincarnations of the Secret Society of Super Villains. In the JLA-80 Page Giant #1 (1998), dozens of villains gather in response to the JLA's new moonbase and extended team efforts. During the meeting, Quilt has his outfit insulted by the Monocle. The meeting turns out to be a JLA trap and all the villains are captured.

===Female Crazy Quilt===

Apparently the Society, led by Alexander Luthor, Jr., has in its roster a new version of Crazy Quilt, a female one with the characteristic costume and vision-helmet of the previous villain. She has appeared in the 'Villains United' series. She works with many other supervillains to take down the 'Secret Six'. "Villains United" #3 In Outsiders #50, she is captured by the Suicide Squad.
In the Secret Six series, she is one of the villains who accepts the offer of a bounty on the heads of the Secret Six from mysterious crime boss, Junior. She is possibly shot by the Six, and stabbed in the stomach by Scandal. 
She later appears in James Robinson's Justice League: Cry For Justice mini as one of the many villains who attacks the team.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==

Crazy-Quilt has a helmet that allows him to hypnotize his victims using flashing lights of various colors. It can also project lethal laser beams, blinding lights, and functions as artificial eyes since his own eyes no longer function; the lenses feed their input signal straight into his brain.
