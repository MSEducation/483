[[Chloroalkyl ether]]

CATEGORIES: Ethers, Organochlorides

Chloroalkyl ethers are a class of organic compounds with the general structure R-O-(CH2)n-Cl, characterized as an ether connected to a chloromethyl group via an alkane chain.
Chloromethyl methyl ether (CMME) is an ether with the formula [tpl]methyl[/tpl][tpl]oxygen[/tpl][tpl]carbon[/tpl][tpl]hydrogen|2[/tpl][tpl]chlorine[/tpl]. It is used as an alkylating agent and industrial solvent to manufacture dodecylbenzyl chloride, water repellents, ion-exchange resins, polymers, and as a chloromethylation reagent. It is a known human carcinogen.Bis(chloromethyl) Ether and Technical-Grade Chloromethyl Methyl Ether CAS Nos. 542-88-1 and 107-30-2, Report on carcinogens, Eleventh edition In organic synthesis the compound is used for the introduction of the methoxymethyl (MOM) protecting group.
Closely related compounds of industrial importance are bis(chloromethyl) ether (BCME) (closely related to chemical weapon sulfur mustard)Bis(Chloromethyl) ether Safety Data Sheet, Division of Occupational Health and Safety, US National Institutes of Health and benzyl chloromethyl ether (BOMCl).

==MOM ethers==

Methyl chloromethyl ether (often abbreviated MOMCl) is used as a protecting group for alcohols. The product formed is a MOM ether. A base such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine is a requirement.
The MOM group can be removed by application of dilute acid.
An example is the protection of a phenol group:Enantioselective total synthesis of (2)-heliannuol A Hidetoshi Kishuku, Mitsuru Shindo and Kozo Shishido Chem. Commun., 2003, 350â€“351 Article link
With a benzyl group the protective group becomes a BOM-ether. See also the closely related methylthiomethyl ethers.
A t-butyl group can also be used.  The chloride is prepared from Methyl tert-butyl ether using a photochemical chlorination.Protection chemistry Professor Tore Benneche, University of Oslo
With a methoxyethoxyl group the protective group becomes a MEM-ether.  This ether is much more stable than the MOM ether to hydrolysis.
