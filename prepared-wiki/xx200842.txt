[[Hardwick Village]]

CATEGORIES: Bassetlaw

Hardwick Village is a village located in Bassetlaw, Nottinghamshire, within Clumber Park, in Sherwood Forest.  It consists of former labourers cottages, and a couple of farms, including Hardwick Grange. 

==History==

Conceived by the Cavendishes, Dukes of Newcastle, in the later part of the Nineteenth century, to serve the Park, and estate of Clumber. Designed in a pleasing, Neo-Elizabethan style, on a picturesque, asymmetrical plan, designed to give the impression, of a traditional village, which had grown ad hoc, and to no particular plan. Since the acquisition of Clumber Park, by the National Trust, the village has been a Covenant, of the National Trust, and the village properties, under tenancy, rather than, provided as homes for employees, as under the Dukes of Newcastle.  Today you are more likely to find commuters living in the cottages, than estate/farm labourers, though the principal farm, Hardwick Grange, continues to farm the land.
