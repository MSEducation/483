The long and varied geological history of the crinoids demonstrates how well the echinoderms have adapted to filter-feeding. The fossils of other stalked filter-feeding echinoderms, such as blastoids, are also found in the rocks of the Palaeozoic era. These extinct groups can exceed the crinoids in both numbers and variety in certain strata. However, none of these others survived the crisis at the end of the Permian period.

===Fossils of interest===

Some fossil crinoids, such as Pentacrinites, seem to have lived attached to floating driftwood and complete colonies are often found. Sometimes this driftwood would become waterlogged and sink to the bottom, taking the attached crinoids with it. The stem of Pentacrinites can be several metres long. Modern relatives of Pentacrinites live in gentle currents attached to rocks by the end of their stem. The largest fossil crinoid on record had a stem [tpl]Convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in length.[ref]

In 2006, geologists isolated complex organic molecules from 350-million-year-old fossils of crinoids—the oldest such molecules yet found. Christina O'Malley, a doctoral student in earth sciences at The Ohio State University, found orange and yellow organic molecules inside the fossilized remains of several species of crinoids dating back to the Mississippian period.[tpl]cite journal |doi=10.1130/G33792.1 |laysummary=http://phys.org/news/2013-02-ancient-fossilized-sea-creatures-yield.html |laysource=Phys.org |laydate=Feb 19, 2013|title=Isolation and characterization of the earliest taxon-specific organic molecules (Mississippian, Crinoidea) |journal=Geology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=347 |year=2013 |last1=O'Malley |first1=C.
