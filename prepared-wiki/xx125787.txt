Diniz's father, Valentim Diniz, founded the company Pão de Açúcar, which grew into a major retailer, Companhia Brasileira de Distribuiçao. In 2002, Diniz sold a large stake to the French company Casino Group for an estimated $860 million and stepped down as CEO, but remained as chairman. In 2009, in one of the most expensive transactions of the Brazilian business history, Grupo Pão de Açúcar bought Casas Bahia from Samuel Klein, giving Abilio control of Pão de Açúcar, Casas Bahia, Ponto Frio and Extra Hipermercados.http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/economia,pao-de-acucar-compra-a-casas-bahia-por-meio-da-globex,476631,0.htm&ei=S_u7T_30JuXC6gHrq8mBDQ&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CFIQ7gEwAA&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/economia,pao-de-acucar-compra-a-casas-bahia-por-meio-da-globex,476631,0.htm%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D1024%26bih%3D627%26prmd%3Dimvnshttp://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=http://epocanegocios.globo.com/Revista/Common/0,,EMI108574-16355,00-GRUPO%2BPAO%2BDE%2BACUCAR%2BCOMPRA%2BCASAS%2BBAHIA.html&ei=CPy7T5mbI4qZ6QHJr-yDCw&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CE8Q7gEwAA&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://epocanegocios.globo.com/Revista/Common/0,,EMI108574-16355,00-GRUPO%252BPAO%252BDE%252BACUCAR%252BCOMPRA%252BCASAS%252BBAHIA.html%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D1024%26bih%3D627%26prmd%3Dimvns In 2012, Casino Group took control of Grupo Pão de Açúcar, and Diniz no longer had operational functions within the group but remained as chairman.New era dawns at Pão de Açúcar, Casino takes helm, Reuters, June 22 2012

==Kidnapping==

In December 1989, Diniz was the victim of a sensational political kidnapping, followed by a police rescue.  He was confined for six days in a small space under a house, with a duct leading to the kitchen fan as his only source of oxygen.
The kidnapping took place in the morning of the Brazilian presidential elections in Brazil in 1989.
The candidates were Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, founding member of the Brazilian Worker's Party (PT – Partido dos Trabalhadores), and Fernando Collor de Mello, the right wing party candidate running for a newly formed National Republican Party (PRN).
The kidnappers called themselves members of a left-wing group. Collor was backed by the richest man in Alagoas, senator João Lyra, who reportedly gave about $16 million to help elect Collor.
The kidnapping is recognized as an act of sabotage [tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.cartamaior.com.br/templates/materiaMostrar.cfm?materia_id=17142 |title= Carta Maior: Um alerta, por Marilena Chauí  |language = português |author=Marilena Chauí|date=October 29, 2010 |accessdate=October 31, 2010[/tpl] of the elections, having been executed on election day and associating the act with the political left wing. As all political parties were under a communication media embargo (television, radio or newspapers) in the days prior to election day, Lula's party had no opportunity to clarify or rebuke the accusations that their party (PT) was involved in the terrorist act.
As soon as the news of the kidnapping was aired, polls indicated a steady fall in votes for Lula. Fernando Collor de Mello won the elections and would later resign as his trial for corruption was about to begin, in a failed attempt to prevent his impeachment by the Brazilian Senate.
Among the kidnappers were Canadians David Spencer and Christine Lamont, who were students at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia.
Lamont and Spencer denied any participation in the kidnapping but their participation was proved when a secret weapons cache in Managua exploded (among the material exposed by the explosion were documents that linked both Lamont and Spencer to the Diniz kidnapping). Faced with these revelations, Lamont admitted that they had been involved in the kidnapping.[tpl]cite book | last = Isabel Vincent| authorlink = Isabel Vincent| title = No Evil: The Strange Case of Christine Lamont and David Spencer|edition= May 1997|page= 212 | publisher = Reed International Books| isbn= 0-433-39619-9[/tpl]
Lamont and Spencer were sentenced to 28 years in prison for their involvement, but were kept in private cells, away from the mass of the prison population. The Canadian press and public started a major movement to secure their release, straining relations between Brazil and Canada.  However, two Canadian investigative journalists, Isabel Vincent of the Globe and Mail and Caroline Mallan of the Toronto Star, wrote books concluding that Lamont and Spencer were likely guilty, and they were being treated well by Brazilian authorities.  Lamont confessed to involvement in the kidnapping, which was meant to raise money for Sandinista guerrillas, and the two were released and deported to Canada in 1996.
