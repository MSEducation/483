[[Hart Ranges]]

CATEGORIES: Mountain ranges of British Columbia, Ranges of the Canadian Rockies, Northern Interior of British Columbia

The Hart Ranges are one of the main geographic subdivisions of the Canadian Rockies and are the main part of the area that is meant by the Northern Rockies, although the much larger Muskwa Ranges to the north are more deserving of that term — but also much more inaccessible and much less visited — and the Northern Rockies are generally also considered to extend at least as far south as Mount Robson, which is in the Continental Ranges .  The Hart Ranges were named in honour of British Columbia Premier John Hart, as is the highway which traverses the Pine Pass in the northern part of the range, connecting the north-central Interior of the province to its Peace River District to the northeast.
The boundaries of the Hart Ranges are the Rocky Mountain Trench and the McGregor Plateau on the west/southwest, the Peace Reach of Williston Lake on the north, and a certain line of demarcation with the Rocky Mountain Foothills to the east/northeast.  The southern boundary is at Jarvis Creek.[tpl]cite book|last=Holland|first=Stuart S.|title=Bulletin 48: Landforms of British Columbia--A Physiographic Outline|year=1976|publisher=K. M.
