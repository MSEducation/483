[[Crotoniidae]]

CATEGORIES: Acari

Crotoniidae are a family of mites of the Desmonomata group that may be the first animal lineage to have abandoned sexual reproduction and then reevolved it. This is a spectacular case of atavism, and later convergent evolution.Norton, R. (2007), Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, April 24, cited in Science News, vol. 171, p. 302
