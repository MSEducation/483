The library was founded by Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, in 1572.Christa Graefe: Staatsklugheit und Frömmigkeit. Herzog Julius zu Braunschweig-Lüneburg, ein norddeutscher Landesherr des 16. Jahrhunderts. Weinheim 1989, ISBN 3-527-17822-8, S. 90f. In the 17th century it was the largest library north of the Alps. The library was named for Duke Augustus (1579-1666). He built the collection, which was kept at Wolfenbüttel. Armies passed by, back and forth, over the centuries, but the collection was well protected. It was so highly regarded that generals placed the library under special protection, and the library is one of the oldest in the world to have never suffered loss to its collection.Murray, Stuart A. P. “The Library: An Illustrated History.” New York, NY: Skyhorse Publishing, 2012, p. 284.
