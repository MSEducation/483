Big Warrior or Tustanagee Thlucco (Tvstanagi Rakkē in Mvskokē «Big Warrior»  The name Tustanagee Thlucco is actually a war title, "great warrior," given to the man who led all the warriors of a town. No other Creek name is recorded for Big Warrior. 
Big Warrior was from the town of Tukabatchee. For most of his career he collaborated with the United States government and became wealthy. He was accused of enriching himself by mishandling annuities paid to the Creeks by the United States. 
In 1811 Big Warrior welcomed Tecumseh to Tukabatchee to deliver his message of pan-tribal unity and hostility to the United States. Nevertheless, Big Warrior remained firmly on the U.S. side during the Creek War of 1813-14. The Treaty of Fort Jackson forced harsh settlement terms on the entire Creek Nation. In the following decade Big Warrior became an opponent of further land cessions. 
Big Warrior, representing the Upper Towns of the Creek Nation, shared the leadership of the Creek National Council with Little Prince, principal chief of the Lower Towns.
