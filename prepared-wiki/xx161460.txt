Edwin H. "Ed" Whitehead (February 26, 1925 - May 20, 2007) was a lawyer in Cheyenne, Wyoming, a former Democratic member of the Wyoming House of Representatives, and an early supporter of John F. Kennedy for the American presidency in a state which three times supported Richard M. Nixon.

==Biography==

Whitehead was one of five children born to Douglas and Edith Whitehead in Burns, a small community in Laramie County near Cheyenne, the Wyoming state capital. On October 7, 1950, he married the former Janet C. Davis (born ca. 1930). He served in both the United States Navy and United States Army during both World War II and the Korean War.
Whitehead was a partner in the firm Whitehead, Gage & Davidson, but in his later career he was a sole practitioner. He was a past chairman of the Laramie County Democratic Central Committee, a former president of Young Democrats of Wyoming, and a member of the American and Laramie County bar associations. In 1960, he was a delegate at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, which assembled the Kennedy-Johnson ticket. He served three terms in the Wyoming House from 1967-1972.
Whitehead died in Cheyenne. He had a son, Michael Whitehead of Kimberton, Pennsylvania; two daughters, Karen Dilks of Sedona, Arizona, and Laura Ditges of Broomfield, Colorado; a brother, Walter Whitehead of Pendleton, Oregon; and two sisters, Carrie Shenefelt of Ogden, Utah, and Irma Dewey of Cottonwood, Arizona, and four grandchildren.
Whitehead was cremated at Cheyenne Memorial Gardens under the direction of Wiederspahn-Radomsky Chapel of the Chimes.
Three other former Cheyenne lawmakers, all Republicans, died within a month of Whitehead's death:  Joseph D. Selby on April 20, Larry D. Shippy on June 8, and Robert Schliske on June 21, 2007, respectively.
