[[Keep It to Yourself (Reuben song)]]

CATEGORIES: 2005 singles, Reuben songs

"Keep it to Yourself" is the ninth single by Surrey-based rock band Reuben, and the third single taken from their second album, Very Fast Very Dangerous. It was released in September 2005, one week ahead of the album. The single was available on three formats: CD, 7" vinyl and a limited edition yellow vinyl version, each released with different b-sides. Like previous single 'A Kick In The Mouth', it received good reviews in the press but little airplay on Radio and TV. Although the single sold more copies than its predecessor in its first week, it climbed to only #62 in the UK charts. However, on 3 September 2006 it climbed to #35 in BBC Radio 1's Top 40 Rock Singles chart.
