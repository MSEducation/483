The city of Cambridge is a university town and the administrative centre of the county of Cambridgeshire, England. It lies in East Anglia, on the River Cam, about [tpl]convert|50|mi|0|0[/tpl] north of London. According to the United Kingdom Census 2011, its population was 123,867 (including 24,488 students).[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/ |title=2011 Census by Local Authority – Key Statistics: Key figures for 2011 census, Key Statistics: Qualifications and Students |year=2012 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl] This makes Cambridge the second largest city in Cambridgeshire after Peterborough, and the 54th largest in the United Kingdom.[tpl]cite web |url= http://thegeographist.wordpress.com/2013/11/23/largest-cities-uk-population/|title=1000 Largest Cities in the UK |year=2013 |publisher=The Geographist |accessdate=15 February 2014[/tpl] There is archaeological evidence of settlement in the area during the Bronze Age and Roman times; under Viking rule Cambridge became an important trading centre. The first town charters were granted in the 12th century, although city status was not conferred until 1951.
Cambridge is most widely known as the home of the University of Cambridge, founded in 1209 and consistently ranked one of the top five universities in the world.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8793862/What-it-takes-to-make-it-to-Oxbridge.html |title=What it takes to make it to Oxbridge |first=Richard |last=Cairns |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location =London |date=1 October 2011 |accessdate=26 February 2012[/tpl] The university includes the renowned Cavendish Laboratory, King's College Chapel, and the Cambridge University Library. The Cambridge skyline is dominated by the last two buildings, along with the chimney of Addenbrooke's Hospital in the far south of the city and St John's College Chapel tower.
Today, Cambridge is at the heart of the high-technology centre known as Silicon Fen – a play on Silicon Valley and the fens surrounding the city. Its economic strengths lie in industries such as software and bioscience, many start-up companies having been spun out of the university. Over 40% of the workforce have a higher education qualification, more than twice the national average. Cambridge is also home to the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, one of the largest biomedical research clusters in the world.url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-25197143 |title=Papworth heart and lung specialist hospital to move |date=3 December 2013
The green space of Parker's Piece hosted the first ever game of association football, and the Strawberry Fair music and arts festival is held on Midsummer Common. Cambridge is adjacent to the M11 and A14 roads, and is around 49 minutes from London King's Cross by non-stop train, with other rail links to Norwich, Birmingham and elsewhere.

==History==

===Prehistory and Roman===

Settlements have existed around the Cambridge area since before the Roman Empire. The earliest clear evidence of occupation is the remains of a 3,500-year-old farmstead discovered at the site of Fitzwilliam College.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cambridgeshire/7194650.stm |title=Bronze Age site is found in city |work=BBC News |date=17 January 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2009[/tpl] There is further archaeological evidence of occupation through the Iron Age, with evidence of settlement on Castle Hill in the 1st century BC, perhaps relating to wider cultural changes occurring in southeastern Britain at this time linked to the arrival of the Belgae.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.visitcambridge.org/VisitCambridge/Factsheets.aspx |title=A brief history of Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge City Council |year=2010 |accessdate=27 June 2010[/tpl] Evidence of widespread Roman settlement has been discovered in Cambridge including numerous farmsteads[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/aug/28/archaeology-cambridge-university-girton-roman |title=The Roman foundations of Cambridge |first=John |last=Henley |newspaper=The Guardian |date=28 August 2009|quote='What's interesting about Cambridge is that with these tracts of land bequeathed to the university, you have a lot of preserved green space coming in close to the city centre,' says Chris Evans, head of the Cambridge unit. 'It hasn't been developed in the intervening centuries.

===Post-Roman and Medieval===

After the Romans had left, Saxons took over the land on and around Castle Hill and renamed it Grantabrycge – 'Bridge over the river Granta'. Over time the name evolved to become Cambridge, while the river Granta became known as the river Cam to match the name of the city.[tpl]Cite journal|url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PUsAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA403 |work= Notes and Queries: A Medium of Inter-Communication for Literary Men, General Readers, etc. |first=F. |last=Chance |date=13 November 1869 |volume=4 |location=London |title=Cambridge. |pages=401–404 |accessdate=25 February 2012 |publisher=Bell & Daldy |oclc=644126889[/tpl] Their grave goods have been found in the area. During Anglo-Saxon times Cambridge benefited from good trade links across the hard-to-travel fenlands. By the 7th century the town was less significant, described by Bede as a "little ruined city" containing the burial site of Etheldreda.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66604 |title=The city of Cambridge: Medieval history |editor=Roach, J.P.C. |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1959 |work=A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 3: The City and University of Cambridge |accessdate=18 July 2011 [/tpl] Cambridge is mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as "Grantebrycge", a period when settlements existed on both sides of the river and Cambridge was on the border of East Anglian and Middle Anglian kingdoms.
The arrival of the Vikings in Cambridge was recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in 875. Viking rule, the Danelaw, had been imposed by 878[tpl]Cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7T0uIfkPn28C&lpg=PR11&ots=yYYbrrk8Ac&dq=danelaw%20cambridge%20878&lr&pg=PA7|title=A history of the University of Cambridge |volume=1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1988|pages=9–10 10|first=Christopher |last=Nugent Lawrence Brooke |author2= Riehl Leader, Damien |isbn=0-521-32882-9[/tpl] The Vikings' vigorous trading habits caused Cambridge to grow rapidly. During this period the centre of the town shifted from Castle Hill on the left bank of the river to the area now known as the Quayside on the right bank. After the Viking period, the Saxons enjoyed a return to power, building churches such as St Bene't's Church, wharves, merchant houses and a mint, which produced coins with the town's name abbreviated to "Grant".
In 1068, two years after his conquest of England, William of Normandy built a castle on Castle Hill. Like the rest of the newly conquered kingdom, Cambridge fell under the control of the King and his deputies. The distinctive Round Church dates from this period.
The first town charter was granted by Henry I to Cambridge between 1120 and 1131. It gave Cambridge monopoly of waterborne traffic and hithe tolls as well as recognising the Borough court.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66606 |title=The city of Cambridge: Constitutional history |editor=Roach, J.P.C. |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year =1959 |work= A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 3: The City and University of Cambridge |accessdate=26 February 2012[/tpl] In 1209, Cambridge University was founded by students escaping from hostile townspeople in Oxford.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.cam.ac.uk/univ/history/records.html |title=University and Colleges: A Brief History |publisher=University of Cambridge |date=7 February 2008 |accessdate=13 January 2010[/tpl] The oldest college that still exists, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/welcome-peterhouse/about-college |title=About the College  |publisher=Peterhouse College |accessdate=13 January 2010[/tpl]
In 1349 Cambridge was affected by the Black Death.

With over a third of English clergy dying in the Black Death, four new colleges were established at the University over the following years to train new clergymen, namely Gonville Hall, Trinity Hall, Corpus Christi and Clare.[tpl]cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=J5XeBQwrjLwC&pg=PA70 |title=The Black Death and the Transformation of the West (European History Series) |first=David |last=Herlihy  |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-674-07613-6 |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=70 |accessdate=25 February 2012[/tpl]
In 1382 a revised town charter effects a "diminution of the liberties that the community had enjoyed", due to Cambridge's participation in the Peasants' Revolt. The charter transfers supervision of baking & brewing, weights & measures, and forestalling & regrating, from the town to the University.
One of the most well-known buildings in Cambridge, King's College Chapel, was begun in 1446 by King Henry VI.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/chapel/history.html | title=History of the Chapel | publisher=King's College, Cambridge | accessdate=19 July 2011[/tpl] The project was completed in 1515 during the reign of King Henry VIII.

===Early Modern===

Following numerous deaths in the town due to plague, sanitation and fresh water was brought to Cambridge through the construction of Hobson's Conduit in the early 1600s. The water system brought water from Nine Wells, at the foot of the Gog Magog Hills, into the centre of the town.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cambridgeshire/natural_history/walk_through_time/07.shtml | title=Cambridgeshire > Natural History > Cam Valley Walk > Stage 7 | publisher=BBC Cambridgeshire | accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl]
Cambridge played a significant role in the early part of the English Civil War as it was the headquarters of the Eastern Counties Association, an organisation administering a regional East Anglian army, which became the mainstay of the Parliamentarian military effort prior to the formation of the New Model Army.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66605 |title=The city of Cambridge – Modern history | A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 3: The City and University of Cambridge (1959) |pages=15–29 |year=1959 |accessdate=26 February 2012[/tpl] In 1643 control of the town was given by Parliament to Oliver Cromwell, who had been educated at the University's Sidney Sussex College. The town's castle was fortified, with troops garrisoned there and some bridges destroyed to aid the defence. Although Royalist forces came within [tpl]convert|2|mi|0|abbr=out[/tpl] of the town in 1644, the defences were never used and the garrison was stood down the following year.
In the 19th century, in common with many other English towns, Cambridge expanded rapidly. This was due in part to increased life expectancy and also improved agricultural production leading to increased trade in town markets.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66609 |title=The city of Cambridge: Economic history |author=J.

The railway came to Cambridge in 1845 after initially being resisted, with the opening of the Great Eastern London to Norwich line. The station was placed outside the town centre following pressure from the University, who restricted travel by undergraduates.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66603&strquery=cambridge |title=The city of Cambridge |author=J.

CIH, 2006. The train link to London stimulated heavier industries, such as the production of brick, cement and malt.

===20th century===

From the 1930s to the 1980s, the size of the city was increased by several large council estates.[tpl]cite book |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=15307 |title=Chesterton: Introduction |pages=5–13 |author=Wright, A.P.M.; Lewis, C.P.

During the Second World War, Cambridge was an important centre for defence of the east coast. The town became a military centre, with an R.A.F. training centre and the regional headquarters for Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Hertfordshire, and Bedfordshire established during the conflict. The town itself escaped relatively lightly from German bombing raids, which were mainly targeted at the railway. 29 people were killed and no historic buildings were damaged. In 1944, a secret meeting of military leaders held in Trinity College laid the foundation for the allied invasion of Europe. During the war Cambridge served as an evacuation centre for over 7,000 people from London, as well as for parts of the University of London.
Cambridge was granted its city charter in 1951 in recognition of its history, administrative importance and economic success. Cambridge does not have a cathedral, traditionally a prerequisite for city status, instead falling within the Church of England Diocese of Ely. In 1962 Cambridge's first shopping arcade, Bradwell's Court, opened on Drummer Street, though this was demolished in 2006.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.christslane.co.uk/about/timeline.htm |title=Christ's Lane |publisher=Land Securities |date=n.d.|accessdate=13 January 2010[/tpl] Other shopping arcades followed at Lion Yard, which housed a relocated Central Library for the city, and the Grafton Centre which replaced Victorian housing stock which had fallen into disrepair in the Kite area of the city. This latter project was controversial at the time.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1467625/Derek-Taunt.html |title=Derek Taunt – Obituary |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=23 July 2004|accessdate=26 February 2012 |location=London[/tpl]
The city gained its second University in 1992 when Anglia Polytechnic became Anglia Polytechnic University. Renamed Anglia Ruskin University in 2005, the institution has its origins in the Cambridge School of Art opened in 1858 by John Ruskin. The Open University also has a presence in the city, with an office operating on Hills Road. Cambridge City Council plans to renew the area around the Corn Exchange concert hall, and plans for a permanent ice-skating rink are being considered after the success of a temporary one that has been on Parker's Piece every year for the past few years.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Home/Ice-rink-plan-for-city.htm |title= Ice rink plan for city |date=18 March 2010 |newspaper=Cambridge News |last=Havergal |first=Chris |accessdate=21 March 2012[/tpl]

==Governance==

===Local government===

Cambridge is a non-metropolitan district served by Cambridge City Council. Cambridge Local Authority District covers most of the City's urban area but some extends outside this into South Cambridgeshire District. Cambridge is one of five districts within the county of Cambridgeshire, and is bordered on all sides by the mainly rural South Cambridgeshire district. The city council's headquarters are in the Guildhall, a large building in the market square. Cambridge was granted a Royal Charter by King John in 1207, which permitted the appointment of a Mayor,[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.cambridge.gov.uk/ccm/content/council-and-democracy/mayor/charter-coat-of-arms.en |title=The 1207 Charter and the city's coat of arms |publisher= Cambridge City Council |accessdate=27 February 2012[/tpl] although the first recorded Mayor, Harvey FitzEustace, served in 1213.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.cambridge.gov.uk/ccm/content/council-and-democracy/how-the-council-works/the-mayor/mayors-of-cambridge.en |title= The mayors of Cambridge |publisher= Cambridge City Council |accessdate=4 March 2011[/tpl] City councillors now elect a mayor annually.
For electoral purposes the city is divided into 14 wards: Abbey, Arbury, Castle, Cherry Hinton, Coleridge, East Chesterton, King's Hedges, Market, Newnham, Petersfield, Queen Edith's, Romsey, Trumpington, and West Chesterton. The political composition of the city council is currently: 21 Liberal Democrat councillors, 19 Labour, one Conservative and one independent councillor.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Home/Lib-Dems-lose-overall-control-of-Cambridge-04052012.htm | title=Lib Dems lose overall control of Cambridge | work=Cambridge News | date=4 May 2012 | accessdate=4 May 2012[/tpl]
Each of the 14 wards also elect councillors to Cambridgeshire County Council. Responsible for services including school education, social care and highways, since 2013 the has had No Overall Control.

===Westminster===

The parliamentary constituency of Cambridge covers most of the city. Julian Huppert (Liberal Democrats) was elected Member of Parliament (MP) at the 2010 general election, succeeding David Howarth. One area of the city, Queen Edith's ward,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.election-maps.co.uk/ |title=Ordnance Survey |publisher=Election maps |accessdate=17 July 2010[/tpl] lies in the South Cambridgeshire constituency, whose MP is Andrew Lansley (Conservative), elected in 1997. The city had previously elected a Labour MP from 1992 to 2005 and prior to this, usually elected a Conservative after the Second World War. However, the Conservatives have seen their share of the vote fall over the past 20 years.
The University of Cambridge used to have a seat in the House of Commons, Sir Isaac Newton being one of the most notable holders. The Cambridge University constituency was abolished under 1948 legislation, and ceased at the dissolution of Parliament for the 1950 general election, along with the other university constituencies.

==Geography==

Cambridge is situated about [tpl]convert|50|mi|0|0[/tpl] north-by-east of London. The city is located in an area of level and relatively low-lying terrain just south of the Fens, which varies between [tpl]convert|6|and|24|m|ft[/tpl] above sea level.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/90641/Cambridge |title=Cambridge (England, United Kingdom) |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=13 January 2010[/tpl] The town was thus historically surrounded by low lying wetlands that have been drained as the town has expanded.[tpl]Citation|title=Cambridge SUDS Design & Adoption Guide – The Landscape Vision for SUDS|work=Cambridge City Council |url=http://www.cambridge.gov.uk/public/docs/SUDS-2-Landscape.pdf[/tpl]
The underlying geology of Cambridge consists of gault clay and Chalk Marl, known locally as Cambridge Greensand,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/geodiversity/englands/counties/area_ID4.aspx |title=England's Geology – Cambridgeshire|work=Natural England|accessdate=27 February 2012[/tpl] party overlayed by terrace gravel. A layer of phosphatic nodules (coprolites) under the marl were mined in the 19th century for fertiliser. It became a major industry in the county, and its profits yielded buildings such as the Corn Exchange, Fulbourn Hospital and St. John's Chapel until the Quarries Act 1894 and competition from America ended production.
The River Cam flows through the city north from the village of Grantchester. It is bordered by water meadows within the city such as Sheep's Green as well as residential development. The name 'Cambridge' is derived from the river.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Cambridge |title= Cambridge |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=13 January 2010[/tpl] Like most cities, modern-day Cambridge has many suburbs and areas of high-density housing. The city centre of Cambridge is mostly commercial, historic buildings, and large green areas such as Jesus Green, Parker's Piece and Midsummer Common. Many of the roads in the centre are pedestrianised. Population growth has seen new housing developments in the 21st century, with estates such as the CB1[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/transport/projects/cambridge/cambridgegateway/CB1+development.htm |title=CB1 development |publisher=Cambridgshire County Council |accessdate=13 January 2010[/tpl] and Accordia schemes near the station,[tpl]cite press release |url= http://www.cambridge.gov.uk/ccm/content/news-releases/2008/accordia-wins-prize.en |title=Accordia wins top architectural prize |publisher=Cambridge City Council |date=15 October 2008 |accessdate=13 January 2010[/tpl] and developments such as Clayfarm[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.clayfarm.co.uk/vision |title=Vision |publisher=Clay Farm |accessdate=13 January 2010[/tpl] and Trumpington Meadows[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.trumpingtonmeadows.com/Home |title=Home |publisher=Trumpington Meadows Land Company |accessdate=13 January 2010[/tpl] planned for the south of the city.

===Climate===

Cambridge currently has two official weather observing stations, the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB), about [tpl]convert|2|mi|0|abbr=out[/tpl] north of the city centre, and the Cambridge University Botanic Garden, about 1 mile south of the city centre. The city, like most of the UK, has a maritime climate highly influenced by the Gulf Stream.

Due to its low lying, inland, and easterly position within the British Isles, summer temperatures tend to be somewhat higher than areas further west, and often rival or even exceed those recorded in the London area.

==Economy==

The town's river link to the surrounding agricultural land, and good road connections to London in the south meant Cambridge has historically served as an important regional trading post. King Henry I granted Cambridge a monopoly on river trade, enabling this area of the economy to flourish.[tpl]cite web|title=The Story of Cambridge|first=Stephanie|last=Boyd|work=Cambridge University Press |ISBN=978-0-521-62897-6|year=2005[/tpl] The town market provided for trade in a wide variety of goods and annual trading fairs such as Stourbridge Fair and Midsummer Fair were visited by merchants from across the country. The river was described in an account of 1748 as being "often so full of boats that the navigation thereof is stopped for some time".[tpl]cite journal |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CvoqAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA64 |journal=The London magazine, or, Gentleman's monthly intelligencer |page=64 |title=A description of Cambridge |date=January 1748 |volume=17 |author=Kimber, Isaac |author=Kimber, Edward |location =London |publisher=R.

==Culture==

===Sport===

====Football====

Cambridge played a unique role in the invention of modern football: the game's first set of rules were drawn up by members of the University in 1848. The Cambridge Rules were first played on Parker's Piece and had a "defining influence on the 1863 Football Association rules." which again were first played on Parker's Piece.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/cambridgeshire/content/articles/2006/06/09/cambridge_football_rules_parkers_piece_feature.shtml |title=Cambridge...the birthplace of football?! |publisher=BBC[/tpl]
The city is home to Cambridge United F.C., who played in the Football League at the Abbey Stadium from 1970 to 2005, when they were relegated to Conference Premier, the division in which they currently compete. When relegation became inevitable the club was placed in administration with substantial debts, but it emerged from administration in time for the 2005–06 season. The club's biggest success came in the early 1990s, with two successive promotions, two successive FA Cup quarter-final appearances, a run to the Football League Cup quarter-finals, and reaching the brink of promotion to the new Premier League.
Histon, just north of Cambridge, is home to Conference North side Histon F.C. and Cambridge City F.C. of the Southern Football League Premier Division. Cambridge Regional College F.C. are currently members of the Eastern Counties League Premier Division and play at the Abbey Stadium.

====Cricket====

As well as being the home of the Cambridge Rules in football, Parker's Piece was used for first-class cricket matches from 1817 to 1864.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/375_f.html |title=List of first-class matches on Parker's Piece |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |accessdate=17 July 2010[/tpl] The University of Cambridge's Cricket ground, Fenner's, is located in the city and is one of the home grounds for minor counties team Cambridgeshire CCC.

====Rugby====

The city is represented in both codes of Rugby football. Rugby Union club Cambridge R.U.F.C. play in National Division One at their home ground, Grantchester Road, in the southwest corner of the city. Cambridge Eagles Rugby League team competed in the National Conference League East Section, but played their home games outside the city in Sawston. The club folded in 2006, and Cambridge is now represented by Cambridge Lions.

====Watersports====

The River Cam running through the city centre is used for boating. The University and its colleges are well known for rowing and the Cambridgeshire Rowing Association, formed in 1868, organises competitive rowing on the river outside of the University.[ref]
[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cra-online.net/info/history/early.htm|title=Early CRA History|publisher=Cambridgeshire Rowing Association|accessdate=14 January 2009[/tpl][/ref] Rowing clubs based in the city include City of Cambridge RC, Cambridge '99 RC, Cantabrigian RC and Rob Roy BC.
