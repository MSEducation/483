Aircraft railway station is located on the Werribee line in Victoria, Australia. It serves the western Melbourne suburb of Laverton opening on 7 March 1925 as Aviation Siding, being renamed Aircraft Siding on 10 May 1927 and Aircraft on 19 March 1963.Aircraft VicsigAircraft Station Rail Geelong The station was built to serve the former Royal Australian Air Force Laverton base. The Western standard gauge line passes behind Platform 1.
The present station was built in 1964 and in association with the duplication of the line to Werribee converted to an island platform in 1968.
Doubt was cast on the future of Aircraft station with the announcement that Wiliams Landing station would be built just a kilometre along the line.Aircraft station flies on Hobsons Bay Leader 7 Sepyember 2010
In June 2010 a spokesman for then public transport minister Martin Pakula said only that Aircraft would remain open until 2012, the opening date of Williams Landing station.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.wyndhamweekly.com.au/news/local/news/general/doubts-persist-on-aircraft-station/1872781.aspx|title=Doubts persist on Aircraft station|date=30 June 2010|work=Wyndham Weekly|publisher=www.wyndhamweekly.com.au|accessdate=2010-10-23[/tpl] At the same time the construction of 100 new car parking spaces was cancelled, and railway sources confirmed that the government's plans were to close Aircraft station. However in September 2010 the public transport minister ended speculation by pledging that the station would not be closed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/stopping-all-stations-as-minister-backs-down-20100908-151c2.html|title=Stopping all stations as minister backs down|date=Clay Lucas|date=9 September 2010|publisher=www.theage.com.au|accessdate=2010-10-23| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101013101117/http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/stopping-all-stations-as-minister-backs-down-20100908-151c2.html| archivedate= 13 October 2010[/tpl]
