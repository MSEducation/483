==Canadian operations==

Around 1900, Seagrave opened a Canadian plant and sold a full range of apparatus off and on from there until 1936. Entering into an alliance with well-known Canadian fire engine builder R. S. Bickle Co "Canadianized" versions of standard Seagrave rigs were assembled at Bickle's Woodstock, Ontario plant, and sold under the Bickle-Seagrave banner. After several ownership changes, and closure in 1956, Bickle's successor King-Seagrave Ltd. continued to assemble Seagrave fire apparatus in large numbers until 1973, when FWD Corp opted not to renew its agreement. King continued to produce fire apparatus on commercial chassises until its closure in 1985. 
Today, Seagrave has its Canadian manufacturing operation in Carleton Place, Ontario.
