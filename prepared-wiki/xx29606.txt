While there is evidence for settlement of the area now occupied by the town that dates back to the Iron Age, Arbroath's history as a town begins in the High Middle Ages with the founding of Arbroath Abbey in 1178. Arbroath grew considerably during the Industrial Revolution owing to the expansion of firstly the flax and secondly the jute industries and the engineering sector. A new harbour was built in 1839 and by the 20th century, Arbroath had become one of the larger fishing ports in Scotland.
The town is notable as the home of the Declaration of Arbroath, as well as the Arbroath Smokie.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/2004-08-oldarbroath.htm |title=A glimpse of old Arbroath |accessdate=6 January 2007 |publisher=Angus Council [/tpl] and its football team Arbroath FC holding the world record for highest number of goals in professional football match 36-0 against Aberdeen Bon Accord in the Scottish Cup in 1885.

==History==

===Toponymy===

The earliest recorded name for the town was 'Aberbrothock', a reference to the Brothock Burn which runs through the town, the prefix 'Aber' coming either from the Gaelic 'Obair', or the earlier term 'Aber' which could be either Goidelic or Brythonic for 'river mouth'.[ref]

[/ref] The name 'Aberbrothock' can be found in numerous spelling variations. In the earliest manuscripts available, it is seen as 'Abirbrothoke' (in the letter to Edward I confirming the Treaty of Salisbury, which agreed that the Queen regnant, Margaret, Maid of Norway would marry Edward IVarious authors (1290) Letters: confirmation of the treaty of Salisbury, www.rps.ac.uk; Retrieved 12 December 2008) and 'Aberbrothok' (in the subsequent letter giving consent for the marriageVarious authors (1290) Letter: from the guardians, bishops, earls, abbots and barons of Scotland to Edward I of England, giving consent for the marriage of Queen Margaret to Edward, the king's son, www.rps.ac.uk; Retrieved 12 December 2008).

===Early history===

The area around Arbroath has been occupied since at least the Neolithic period. Material taken from postholes from an enclosure at Douglasmuir, near Friockheim, about five miles north of Arbroath have been radiocarbon dated to around 3500 BC The function of the enclosure is unknown, but may have been for agriculture or for ceremonial purposes.[ref]

Bronze age archaeology is to be found in abundance in the surrounding area. Examples include the short-cist burials found near West Newbigging, about a mile to the North of the town. These burials included pottery urns, a pair of silver discs and a gold armlet.Jervise, A.

The area appears to have been of some importance in the early Christian period, as evidenced by the Pictish stone carvings found during the restoration of St Vigeans church, and now housed in the small museum there. The stones had been used in the building of the old church and, unfortunately, many been badly damaged. One of the stones, the 9th century Drosten Stone, has the distinction of being one of the few Pictish artefacts to have an inscription in Latin text: 'DROSTEN: IREUORET ETTFOR CUS', which has been interpreted in various ways, but it is thought that the second line refers to the Pictish King Uurad, who reigned between 839 and 842 AD.Clancy, T.O.

===Medieval history===

The first modern development in Arbroath was the Abbey, founded by King William the Lion in 1178 for monks of the Tironensian order from Kelso Abbey. It received consecration in 1197 with a dedication to Saint Thomas Becket. It was the King's only personal foundation, and he was buried within its precincts in 1214. The Abbey was not finally completed until 1233.
Arbroath was the location of the Battle of Arbroath in 1446. A series of disagreements between the Chief Justiciary of Arbroath, Alexander Lindsay, third Earl of Crawford, and Bishop James Kennedy of St Andrews resulted in Lindsay sacking the bishop's lands and burning his properties. Lindsay was excommunicated for his troubles and it was felt that this was incompatible with his role as Chief Justiciary. The monks of Arbroath Abbey selected Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity as his replacement and the insult led to pitched battle in the town, leaving 500 dead, including Lindsay and Ogilvy. Large parts of the town were destroyed in the aftermath by the Lindsay family.Jervise, A. (1853) The history and traditions of the land of the Lindsays in Angus and Mearnes, with notices of Alyth and Meigle, Sutherland & Knox, Edinburgh
The Abbey relatively quickly fell into disuse and eventual disrepair after its dissolution at the Reformation, the lead from the roof rumoured to have been used in the 16th century civil wars and the stonework plundered for housebuilding throughout the town. The ruins were a popular site for travellers during the 17th and 18th centuries, and finally in 1815 the remains were taken into the care of the State for preservation. The remains are now administered by Historic Scotland.
On 6 April 1320 the Scottish Parliament met at Arbroath Abbey and addressed to the Pope the Declaration of Arbroath, drafted by the Abbot of the time, Bernard. This document detailed the services which their "lord and sovereign" Robert the Bruce had rendered to Scotland, and affirmed in eloquent terms the independence of the Scots.

===Modern history===

During the Jacobite rising known as the Forty-Five, Arbroath was a Jacobite town. A large portion of its able bodied men joined the Jacobite army.C. Duffy, The 45 (2003), pp 83, 86. It was one of the principal ports where men and supplies could be landed from France. It and other Jacobite ports along the north-east coast collectively formed ‘an asset of almost incalculable value’ to the Jacobite cause.C. Duffy, The 45, p. 366.
During the industrial revolution, Arbroath's economy expanded and the population of the town expanded, with new housing having to be constructed to house the influx of workers. Arbroath became moderately well known for jute and sailcloth production, with 34 mills employing 1400 looms and producing over one million yards of osnaburg cloth and 450,000 yards of sailcloth in 1875. Arbroath is believed to be the source of the sails used on the Cutty Sark.[tpl]cite web|url=http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-800279-arbroath_arbroath-i |title=travel.yahoo.com |accessdate=30 January 2007 |work=Rough Guides |publisher=Yahoo Travel [/tpl] In 1867, the mills in Arbroath employed 4620 people. Arbroath was also prominent in the manufacture of shoes and lawnmowers; local firm Alexander Shanks supplied mowers to the Old Course at St Andrews and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst331.html  |title=Alexander Shanks |accessdate=6 January 2007 |publisher=The Gazetteer for Scotland [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=43417 |title=Andrew's, St – Arbroath |accessdate=13 January 2007 |year=1846 |work=A Topographical Dictionary of Scotland | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070204151308/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=43417| archivedate= 4 February 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Arbroath today is mostly known for its connection with the Scottish fishing industry. After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who would be interested in migrating to Arbroath in order to take advantage of the new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby Auchmithie and further afield, including Shetland. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 whitefish and pelagic vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as fishermen, hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |title=Second boost as Arbroath harbour back on the map |accessdate=30 January 2007 |date=4 March 2004 |work=The Courier and Advertiser |publisher=D.C Thompson [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from Aberdeen and ports further north. The fish processing sector remains one of the largest employers in the town however, but fish for processing now comes from Aberdeen, Peterhead and occasionally from Iceland, Norway and Ireland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/statistics/economic/fishing/index.asp |title=Fishing Industry Statistics |accessdate=6 January 2007 |publisher=Aberdeenshire Council | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070107184807/http://www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk/statistics/economic/fishing/index.asp| archivedate= 7 January 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.scotsman.com/seafishingindustry/Quotas-set-to-put-bite.2688901.jp |title=Quotas set to put bite on fish & chips |accessdate=7 February 2009 |last=Urquhart |first=Frank |date=23 December 2005 |work=The Scotsman  [/tpl]

==Governance==

Arbroath was made a royal burgh in 1178 by King William the Lion at the same time as the Abbey was established. The burgh of regality permitted the monks to hold a weekly market, dispense basic justice and to establish a harbour. In 1559, the town's burgh of regality was reconfirmed in 1559 by King James VI of Scotland. A provost and a town council were appointed and it was at this point Aberbrothock became a fully fledged royal burgh.
Arbroath was controlled by Arbroath Town Council from the time of King James VI through to 1975, when Arbroath (and the county of Angus) were amalgamated with the counties of Perthshire and Dundee City into Tayside, under the control of Tayside Regional Council. Angus, together with Dundee City and Perth & Kinross were re-established following reorganisation under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1994/Ukpga_19940039_en_13.htm |title=Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 |accessdate=7 January 2007 |year=1994 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061212165933/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/Ukpga_19940039_en_13.htm| archivedate= 12 December 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

===History===

Arbroath's prospects originally revolved around the harbour. The original harbour was constructed and maintained by the abbot within the terms of an agreement between the burgesses and John Gedy, the abbot in 1394 AD. This gave way to a more commodious port in 1725, which in turn was enlarged and improved in 1839, when the sea wall, quay walls and breakwater were added to the old inner harbour, at a cost of £58,000. Arbroath became a major port for the coastal shipping trade and in 1846, there were 89 Arbroath registered vessels, totalling 9100 gross tons. In the same year, 599 vessels docked at Arbroath, 56 from foreign ports (mainly Baltic ports) with the remaining 543 employed on the coastal trade. Bark, flax, hemp, hides, oak, and fir timber, and guano for manure, groceries from London, and numerous articles of Baltic produce were imported via Arbroath, with manufactured goods (mainly sailcloth) exported via Arbroath.
Driven by the needs of the fishing and commercial sailing industry, in 1795 Arbroath-based sail maker Francis Webster Ltd had perfected the art of adding Linseed oil to flax sails, creating an oiled flax.[tpl]cite book|title=The sailmaker's apprentice: a guide for the self-reliant sailor|author=Emiliano Marino[/tpl] This developed in the late-19th century into waxed cotton, which drove Arbroath as a manufacturing centre, until the early 1970s manufacturing began to decline. A major employer, Keith & Blackman, closed in 1985 and Giddings and Lewis-Fraser wound down its operations at about the same time, with the entire plant eventually demolished to make way for a Safeway (now Morrisons) supermarket.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/05/11/newsstory5904078t0.asp |title=Disappointment for Arbroath Shoppers |accessdate=13 January 2007 |last=Jarrett |first=Andrew |date=11 May 2004 |work=Dundee Courier & Advertiser |publisher=DC Thompson [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arbroathtimeline.moonfruit.com/ |title=Arbroath Timeline |accessdate=13 January 2007 [/tpl] Alps Electric Co. was a large employer in Arbroath from 1990 to 2001, employing 180 staff.

===Military===

Arbroath is home to 45 Commando of the Royal Marines, who have been based at RM Condor since 1971. The barracks were originally built in 1940 and commissioned as RNAS Arbroath/HMS Condor, a Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) until 1971. The Royal Marines moved to Arbroath in 1971 and remain a major contributor to the local economy, in addition to the Marines stationed at Arbroath, around 600 residents are employed by the Ministry of Defence. The Royal Marines from 45 Commando were recently engaged on operations in Afghanistan and have deployed in support of operations in Iraq and the Falklands War.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6250215.stm |title=UK forces battle Taliban fighters |accessdate=11 January 2007 |date=11 January 2007 |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC [/tpl] In 2004, there was speculation that RM Condor would be transferred to the Army as a replacement for Fort George and that the barracks would become a permanent base for a battalion of The Royal Regiment of Scotland. These plans never went beyond the planning stage and in 2005 it was confirmed the Royal Marines would remain based at the site.[tpl]cite web|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=857922004 |title=Fort George at risk from defence cuts |accessdate=10 January 2007 |last=Chamberlain |first=Gethin |author2=John Ross |date=24 July 2004 |work=The Scotsman  [/tpl]

==Transport==

Arbroath is served by the A92 road which connects the city to Dundee and Fife to the south west, and Stonehaven in the north east. The A92 joins the A90 north of Stonehaven and leads to Aberdeen further north. The A92 is dual carriageway from the southern outskirts of Arbroath to the northern outskirts of Dundee, the A92 proceeds through Dundee before crossing the Tay estuary into Fife via the Tay Road Bridge. The A90 can also be reached at Dundee heading both north (to Aberdeen) and south (to Perth and Edinburgh).

===Arbroath smokies===

Arbroath smokies, for which Arbroath is well-known nationally and internationally, are made solely in Arbroath following the award of Protected Geographical Indication in 2004, which limits Arbroath smokie production to within 4 km of Arbroath. Smokies are made from haddock using traditional methods dating back to the late 19th century where the fish are first salted overnight to preserve them, before being left tied in pairs to dry. Next, the dried fish are hung in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire and covered with a lid. After around an hour of smoking, the fish are golden brown and ready to eat.[ref]

[/ref] The preparation of smokies remains a cottage industry in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively at the harbour area, though one larger processor, RR Spink, supplies Arbroath smokies to several UK supermarket chains, and to HM Queen Elizabeth II for which the company holds a Royal Warrant.[ref]
