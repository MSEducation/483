==Historical background==

The site now occupied by the park was originally used for a water filtration plant by the Tulsa Water Department in the early 20th century. Its purpose was to remove silt from Arkansas River water, which was then piped to users in Tulsa. The filtration plant was unable to meet the design requirements and was abandoned in 1918. Tulsa then selected the Spavinaw Water Project to provide water for the city. In 1923, the Arkansas River flooded the original treatment plant. The original 1910 brick building has been converted to the WaterWorks Art Center.Fernandez, Marnie. Tulsa People.  "Fluid facility."
