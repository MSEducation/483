Boston Architectural College, also known as The BAC, is New England's largest private college of spatial design. It offers first-professional bachelor's and master's degrees in architecture, interior design, landscape architecture, and non-professional design studies . The college offers continuing education credits and certificates and also hosts the BAC Summer Academy for high school students, as well as a variety of other ways for the general public to explore spatial design. It exhibits student work in its McCormick Gallery and frequently hosts conferences and symposia on spatial design.
The BAC is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA, formerly FIDER) and the Landscape Architectural Accreditation Board. The BAC is a member of the ProArts Consortium.

==History==

===Boston Architectural Club (1889–1944)===

Boston Architectural Club was established on December 11, 1889. The certificate of incorporation explains that the club was formed "for the purpose of associating those interested in the profession of architecture with a view to mutual encouragement and help in studies, and acquiring and maintaining suitable premises, property, etc., necessary to a social club... and...for public lectures, exhibitions, classes, and entertainment." Members of the Club provided evening instruction for drafters employed in their offices. From this interchange, an informal atelier developed in the tradition of France's École des Beaux-Arts. The Club held annual public exhibitions and published illustrated catalogs.
The BAC began its formal educational program under the joint leadership of H. Langford Warren and Clarence Blackall. The school was organized to offer an evening education in drawing, design, history, and structures. Like its informal predecessor, the BAC soon developed into an atelier affiliated with the Society of the École des Beaux-Arts in New York. The BAC's design curriculum, teaching methods, and philosophy closely resembled those of the École des Beaux-Arts.
In 1911, the Club acquired a building at 16 Somerset Street on Beacon Hill. The BAC building contained a two-story Great Hall – designed by Ralph Adams Cram – as well as other spaces used for lectures, meetings and exhibitions, a library, and several studios. The newer facilities attracted more students, and the course of instruction became increasingly defined and formal.
In the 1930s most American schools of architecture broke away from the Beaux-Arts tradition and began to establish their own curricula and teaching methods. Without the support of a university structure, The Club struggled with the pains of growth and adjustment. The BAC appointed Arcangelo Cascieri to serve as dean. Cascieri brought the BAC through its philosophical transition without sacrificing the atelier teaching method. The BAC began to draw its faculty from nearby architectural schools and the extended local community of related professionals.

===Boston Architectural Center (1944–2006)===

The Club reorganized in 1944 as the Boston Architectural Center, which the mission "to provide instruction in architecture and related fields for draftsmen and others interested in the practice of architecture or the allied arts, especially those whose employment might interfere with such education in day schools and universities."
By 1965, the BAC had developed a continuing education program to serve the broader community. By the mid-1960s, the Somerset Street building no longer sufficed to serve the needs of the growing school, and the BAC purchased a brick building at 320 Newbury Street. A national design competition was held in 1964, and the winning entry, by Ashley, Myer & Associates, houses the BAC to this day.

===Boston Architectural College (2006–present)===

On July 1, 2006, The Boston Architectural Center formally adopted the new name Boston Architectural College in an effort to more readily identify as a college of higher education awarding accredited professional degrees in design.
In 2007, The BAC acquired 951/955 Boylston Street – the former home of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston – for $7.22 million.[tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] The [tpl]convert|25423|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] complex currently houses studios on the second and third floors and a lecture hall on the ground level. The first floor contains flexible gallery and lecture space.
"'The BAC's renovation of the former Division 16 Police Station at 951 Boylston Street into studios, workshops, and community gathering spaces marks the first time in nearly half a century that we have opened a new building for teaching professional design," said President Ted Landsmark. "This iconic 19th Century building is linked to our 20th Century Newbury Street facility by a recently completed Green Alley sustainability project. Our practitioner-educators now have appropriate spaces within which to teach across the disciplines of architecture, interior design, landscape architecture, and design studies. This new Back Bay space enables us to bring together design professionals who think innovatively about how design can address pressing urban, environmental, health and wellness, and sustainability problems, and supports our engagement with diverse individuals and groups that use design to improve human living, work, and recreational conditions. We thank the many people who have brought this long-sought dream to fruition, and we are pleased to welcome new colleagues and friends to the BAC's Boylston Street campus facility.'
The former Back Bay Police Station Division16 was built in 1887 and subsequently served as home to Boston's Institute of Contemporary Art. The building now includes student meeting spaces, studios, a lecture hall and a gallery. It also features, for the first time, a universally accessible entrance through the front doors of the building." http://the-bac.edu/experience-the-bac/news-and-events/news/bac-opens-951-boylston-street 

==Schools and programs==

Boston Architectural College consists of four divisions: the Schools of Spatial Design, the Landscape Institute (LI), the Sustainable Design Institute (SDI), and the Continuing Education (CE) Program.

===Schools of Spatial Design===

School of Architecture
School of Interior Design
School of Landscape Architecture
School of Design Studies
*Design Studies students concentrate in one of the fields listed.

===The Landscape Institute===

The Landscape Institute – not to be confused with the School of Landscape Architecture – offers courses and certificates in landscape design (CLD), landscape design history (CLH), landscape preservation (CLP), and planting design (CPD) and is the longest running certificate program of its kind.
The Landscape Design Program was established through the Radcliffe Seminars in 1970. It was the result of positive feedback from a 1968 lecture at Radcliffe, "The Intellectual History of Garden Art." The institute moved to Harvard University's Arnold Arboretum in 2002 and would later become a part of the BAC in 2009. Though now an institute of the BAC, the Landscape Institute curriculum still involves partnerships with the Arnold Arboretum in addition to partnerships with The Olmsted Center for Landscape Preservation, Historic New England, and the Wakefield Trust. In celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Landscape Institute, the BAC will host a landscape symposium on November 5, 2010. The current director of the Institute is Heather D. Heimarck, ASLA.[tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]

===Sustainable Design Institute===

The Sustainable Design Institute (SDI) offers a completely online program of graduate-level courses, developed with Building Green, conferring certificates in sustainable design, sustainable community planning and design, sustainable building design and construction, and sustainable residential design. Many courses are accepted for AIA Sustainable Design/Health, Safety, Welfare Learning Continuing Education Units, many have been approved as part of the US Green Building Council's Education Providers Program, and offer continuing education credits for LEED AP's, and most are accepted by the Royal Institute of British Architects for Continuing Professional Development.[tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]

===Continuing education program===

The BAC offers certificates in Architectural Rendering, Design Computing, Decorative Arts, Historic Preservation, Kitchen & Bath Design, Planting Design, and Sustainable Design (on-site; online through the Sustainable Design Institute at the BAC). The BAC is a registered AIA provider for Continuing Education.

===Academic-Only First Year Program (AOP)===

The Academic-Only First Year Program is an optional first-year foundation studies program offered across the four schools of the BAC.

===McCormick Gallery===

The BAC operates a gallery on the main level of its 320 Newbury Street building. McCormick Gallery features student work as well as themed spatial design exhibits. The gallery is open to the public, and is prominently located on the corner of Newbury Street and Hereford.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.the-bac.edu/experience-the-bac/mccormick-gallery |title=McCormick Gallery - Boston Architectural College |publisher=The-bac.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03[/tpl]

===Facilities===

Facilities at The BAC are referred to by their addresses. In recent years with the purchase of properties at 100 Massachusetts Avenue and 951/955 Boylston Street, the college has been rapidly expanding into new spaces. The college is planning major work on the 320/322 Newbury & 951/955 Boylston properties towards the goal of making both properties and the surrounding cityscape more sustainable. The current plan calls for improvements on the public alley between 320/322 Newbury and 951/955 Boylston.
With the exception of access-regulated thesis studios in 100 Massachusetts Avenue, there are no 24-hour access spaces at The BAC. Administrators have also explored, at various times, the idea of investing in student residences.

====320 / 322 Newbury Street====

320 Newbury Street is a Brutalist building designed by the firm of Ashley, Myer & Associates in 1966 and renovated in 2000 by Silverman Trykowski Associates.[tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl] The design intended for the building "... not to depend on a sense of weight to achieve importance" but rather, through the energy of form, to evoke a sense of aliveness and contending." The design uses cantilevered, suspended masonry masses and accentuated vertical "slits" in the exterior by which some of the building's core functions can be seen from the outside. Open studio floors allow students to look in on one another's classes and studios, and its ground floor, open to Newbury Street invites the general public into the McCormick gallery.
The program for the new building had specified capacity for 200 students with 30 to [tpl]convert|50|sqft|m2[/tpl] of space allocated to each student. Several floors were designed to be rented until the school required them. Growth of the student body, however, proceeded more rapidly than anticipated, and the number of students gradually increased to as many as 650 in 1974. The "extra floors" were never rented, and the expanding student body and staff needed to support them quickly placed demands on all existing space.
In the late 1980s, to accommodate its growth, the BAC purchased the adjoining building at 322 Newbury Street, a former carriage house.
The west elevation of the building is articulated with a mural by the artist Richard Haas, which was completed in 1975. The trompe l'oeil mural of a Classical-style building and dome provides a contrast to the Brutalist style of the building.
