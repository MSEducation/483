==History==

The plans for what would become MSUM were laid down in 1885, when the Minnesota State Legislature passed a bill declaring the need for a new state normal school in the Red River Valley, with an eye on Moorhead.  The State Senator who proposed the bill, State Senator Solomon Comstock, donated [tpl]Convert|6|acre|ha[/tpl] and appropriated the funds that would go to form the campus which opened in 1888.  In 1921, the State authorized  the school to offer the four-year Bachelor of Science degree in Education and the school became Moorhead State Teachers College.
With the entrance of World War II, the college entered into a contract with the Army Air Corps to train aviation students.  After World War II, enrollment swelled to more than 700 students and the school diversified and broadened into both a liberal arts and professional curriculum. The school began offering a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1946 and graduate programs by 1953. As a result of the broadened offerings, by 1957 the name was changed to Moorhead State College.  In 1969, the school joined a cooperative cross-registration exchange with neighboring Concordia College and North Dakota State University, creating the Tri-College University. The school continued to increase its number of programs and by 1975, the State Legislature that year permitted the institution to change its name to Moorhead State University. In 1995, Moorhead State
became part of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities  (MnSCU) system. On July 1, 2000, the school officially became Minnesota State University Moorhead.
Minnesota State University Moorhead was rated the 18th top liberal arts college in the midwest by TIME magazine in 2008.
