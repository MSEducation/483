The Berlin Thunder were a professional American football team in NFL Europe.

==History==

The Thunder came into existence as an expansion team, after the London/England Monarchs franchise shut down operations, prior to the 1999 season.
The Thunder won the World Bowl 3 times: 2001, 2002 and 2004 (a year that they went 9-1). 
They also made it to the World Bowl in 2005, but were narrowly defeated by the Amsterdam Admirals. The final score was 27-21. 
Two Berlin quarterbacks, Rohan Davey (2004) and Dave Ragone (2005), were named NFL Europe Offensive Most Valuable Players. Linebacker Rich Scanlon (2005) was named NFL Europe Defensive MVP. In 2006, the Thunder had three players earn All-NFL Europe honors: guard Chad Beasley and safety Anthony Floyd earned all-league honors at their respective positions and German defensive end Christian Mohr was honored as the national player on the defensive all-league team.
On April Fools Day 2006, the Thunder recorded their very first tie in franchise history.  Trailing the Hamburg Sea Devils 17-0 at halftime, the Thunder erased their deficit to tie it up, going into overtime.  Unfortunately, neither team could come up with a point in the extra period. This was only the second tie in the history of NFL Europe. The previous tie came in the 1992 season between the Rhein Fire and the London Monarchs. The final score for that game was also 17-17.
