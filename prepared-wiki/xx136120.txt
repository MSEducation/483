Andrew Weston "Andy" Clarke (born 22 July 1967) is an English former footballer. A striker, he scored 74 goals in 410 league games in a 14-year career in the Football League.
After helping Barnet to the Conference title in 1990–91, he was signed to Wimbledon, a Football League side, at the relatively late age of 23. He played for the "Dons" in the Premier League, before being loaned out to Port Vale in 1998 and Northampton Town in 1999. He joined Peterborough United in June 1999, and scored the only goal of the Third Division play-off final in 2000. He retired in May 2005.

==Playing career==

Clarke originally started playing Sunday League football in the Greek Community League, before he was signed to Barnet. He made a huge impression at Underhill, and represented the England Non-League XI before signing for Ray Harford's Wimbledon in February 1991 for £250,000 – a record fee for a non-league player. At the end of the season, Barry Fry led the "Bees" to promotion to the Football League as champions of the Football Conference. Meanwhile Clarke was immediately thrown into the first team at Plough Lane, playing 12 league games and scoring three goals as the "Dons" finished seventh in the First Division.
New boss Joe Kinnear then led the club to a 13th place finish in 1991–92. The club then became founder members of the Premier League, posting a 12th place finish in 1992–93; Clarke scored five goals in 33 appearances. Despite being forced to play their home games at Crystal Palace's Selhurst Park, they rose to sixth in 1993–94, finishing higher than all London clubs except Arsenal. Wimbledon then finished ninth in 1994–95. He scored four goals in 1995–96, helping the "Wombles" into 14th place. Clarke hit the net just once in 1996–97 as the "Crazy Gang" hit eighth in the league, and reached the semi-finals of both domestic cup competitions. He played 20 games in 1997–98, again scoring just one goal, as Wimbledon dropped to 15th. In total he played 212 league and cup games for the club, scoring 23 goals.
Clarke started the 1998–99 campaign on loan at First Division side Port Vale, but made just six goalless appearances for John Rudge's "Valiants". He spent four weeks on loan at Second Division side Northampton Town in January 1999, but made just four goalless appearances for the struggling Sixfields side. He was given a free transfer in June 1999, and joined Third Division club Peterborough United. He rediscovered his scoring form at London Road under Barry Fry, his former manager at Barnet, bagging 18 goals in 43 appearances in 1999–2000. The "Posh" finished fifth, and Clarke scored at Underhill in a 5–1 win over Barnet in the play-off semi-finals. He went on to score in the play-off Final at Wembley, the only goal of the game, to take Peterborough into the Second Division; he said that "It's the best moment of my life."[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/765808.stm|title=Posh pull it off at Wembley|date=28 June 2000|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 May 2009[/tpl]
