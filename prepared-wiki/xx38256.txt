==History==

The history of Gordon-Conwell goes back to the late 1800s.[tpl]cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.gordonconwell.edu/about/Our-History.cfm|accessdate=2012-11-05[/tpl] In its current form, Gordon-Conwell arose from the refounding of two separate schools in 1969. This refounding was the product of a merger between Gordon Divinity School, formerly of Gordon College (1889) in Wenham, Massachusetts, and the Conwell School of Theology (1888), formerly of Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Both schools were founded in the Baptist theological heritage. Both Adoniram Judson Gordon and Russell Conwell were Baptist ministers; Gordon's divinity school was first established as Gordon Bible Institute in 1889,[tpl]cite book|last=Songe|first=Alice|title=American Universities and Colleges|year=1978|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=79[/tpl] while Conwell's theological school was originally chartered as Temple College in 1888.
In 1969, both Gordon Divinity School and Conwell School of Theology experienced a downturn. The reorganization of both schools into Gordon-Conwell was the result of the financial backing of J. Howard Pew and the unifying influence of evangelist Billy Graham. Boston pastor and theologian Harold Ockenga was selected as its first president.[tpl]cite web|title=Ockenga Institute|url=http://www.gordonconwell.edu/resources/|accessdate=2012-11-05[/tpl]
Ockenga had wanted a strong evangelical voice in New England to contend with more theologically liberal schools like Harvard and Boston University. He also envisioned Gordon-Conwell as an east-coast equivalent to Fuller Theological Seminary on the west coast. Other former presidents include Robert Cooley (1981–1997), Walter Kaiser, Jr. (1997–2006), and James Emery White (2006–2007), and Haddon Robinson (2007–2008). Currently the President is Dennis Hollinger (2009- ) and the Chair of the Board of Trustees for Gordon-Conwell is John A. Huffman, Jr., an accomplished pastor and author.[tpl]cite web|title=Board of Trustees|url=http://www.gordonconwell.edu/about/Board-of-Trustees.cfm|accessdate=2012-11-05[/tpl]

==Organization==

Gordon Divinity School and Conwell Theological Seminary were both from the Baptist heritage. When Gordon-Conwell was refounded in 1969, however, the seminary was purposefully founded with no specific Christian denominational affiliation. Today, Gordon-Conwell has students from over 80 different denominations, as well as students from over 40 countries around the world. Theologically, the Statement of Faith[tpl]cite web|title=Statement of Faith|url=http://www.gordonconwell.edu/about/Statement-of-Faith.cfm|accessdate=2012-11-05[/tpl] and the Mission and Purpose[tpl]cite web|title=Mission and Purpose|url=http://www.gordonconwell.edu.edu/about/Mission-and-Purpose.cfm[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2012[/tpl] of the seminary are based on Protestant and evangelical doctrines, such as biblical inerrancy and penal substitution.
Gordon-Conwell is part of the Boston Theological Institute (BTI), a consortium of nine theological schools in the Greater Boston area and the Carolina Theological Consortium, a consortium of four theological schools in North and South Carolina.
Gordon-Conwell is overseen by the main administration at the Hamilton campus. Each of the other three campuses is overseen by a campus dean, who reports directly to the Vice President for Academic Affairs and main campus administration.
