[[Trading jacket]]

CATEGORIES: Workwear, Financial markets

A trading jacket is a garment worn by an individual who executes trades by open outcry in and around the trading pits of various financial exchanges. Trading jackets are frequently brightly coloured and distinctive to assist in the identification of specific traders and / or the exchange members for whom they work.
This colourful characteristic of the financial markets is dying out as open outcry exchanges adopt electronic trading platforms.
