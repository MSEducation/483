The coat of arms of Stellaland was the official heraldic symbol of the short-lived Stellaland state in South Africa from 1883 to 1885.  It was later revived as the municipal arms of Stellaland's capital, Vryburg.

==History==

The coat of arms appears to have been designed and adopted shortly after Stellaland was proclaimed a republic in August 1883.  It was depicted on the postage stamps from February 1884.Jurgens, A.A.

The Vryburg municipality adopted the arms in 1931, and were added to the mayor's chain of office in 1956. The arms were formally granted to the municipality by the administrator of the Cape Province in 1966,Cape of Good Hope Official Gazette No 3363 (2 September 1966) and registered at the Bureau of Heraldry in 1970. The arms are now used by the Naledi Municipality, North West, into which Vryburg has been incorporated.

==Blazon==

The blazon of the arms is :
 
 
The korhaan represents the chief Massouw, the star the comet after which Stellaland was named, the scales justice, and the impaled fish the defeated chief Mankaroane.
Some postage stamps show the arms supported by two lions.   There is also a painting showing the arms flanked by flags.
The Stellaland postage stamps are monochrome, with the tinctures of the arms indicated by cross-hatching.  According to the cross-hatching, quarter 1 should be gold, quarter 2 blue, and quarters 3 and 4 red, as shown in the illustration (right).  The postage stamps are incorrect in this respect.[tpl]cn|date=December 2013[/tpl]
