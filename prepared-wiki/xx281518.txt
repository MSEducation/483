[[Maximally informative dimensions]]

CATEGORIES: Neurology

Maximally informative dimensions is a dimensionality reduction technique used in the statistical analyses of neural responses. Specifically, it is a way of projecting a stimulus onto a low-dimensional subspace so that as much information as possible about the stimulus is preserved in the neural response. It is motivated by the fact that natural stimuli are typically confined by their statistics to a lower-dimensional space than that spanned by white noise.D.J. Field. "Relations between the statistics of natural images and the response properties of cortical cells." J. Opt. Soc. am. A 4:2479-2394, 1987. Within this subspace, however, stimulus-response functions may be either linear or nonlinear. The idea was originally developed by Tatyana Sharpee, Nicole Rust, and William Bialek in 2003.Sharpee, Tatyana, Nicole C. Rust, and William Bialek.

==Importance==

Maximally informative dimensions does not make any assumptions about the Gaussianity of the stimulus set, which is important, because naturalistic stimuli tend to have non-Gaussian statistics. In this way the technique is more robust than other dimensionality reduction techniques such as spike-triggered covariance analyses.
