[[Global World Series]]

CATEGORIES: World Series, World championships, Nippon Professional Baseball

The Global World Series is a proposed baseball championship series between the champions of Major League Baseball's World Series champion, and Nippon Professional Baseball's Japan Series champion.
On January 7, 2010, it was announced that MLB Commissioner, Bud Selig, and NPB Commissioner, Ryozo Kato, had a meeting on January 5 in Milwaukee, and Selig suggested a Global World Series, which he wants to implement before his retirement in 2012, as his "legacy".  Kato had similar views, and likes the idea.
Further negotiating of the Global World Series is to take place this Summer, when Selig visits Japan.
