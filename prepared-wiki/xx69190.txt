Stephen Tyrone Colbert ([tpl]IPAc-en|k|oʊ|l|ˈ|b|ɛər[/tpl], né: [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|l|b|ər|t[/tpl]; born May 13, 1964) is an American political satirist, writer, comedian, television host, and actor. He is the host of Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a satirical news show in which Colbert portrays a caricatured version of conservative political pundits. On April 10, 2014, Colbert was chosen to succeed David Letterman as the host of the Late Show on CBS after Letterman retires in 2015.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2014/04/10/stephen-colbert-taking-over-david-lettermans-late-night-spot/ | title=Stephen Colbert Leaving Character Behind To Take Over David Letterman's Late-Night Spot | work=Forbes | date=April 10, 2014| accessdate= April 10, 2014[/tpl]
Colbert originally studied to be an actor, but became interested in improvisational theatre when he met famed Second City director Del Close while attending Northwestern University. He first performed professionally as an understudy for Steve Carell at Second City Chicago; among his troupe mates were comedians Paul Dinello and Amy Sedaris, with whom he developed the sketch comedy series Exit 57.
Colbert also wrote and performed on the short-lived Dana Carvey Show before collaborating with Sedaris and Dinello again on the cult television series Strangers with Candy. He gained considerable attention for his role on the latter as closeted gay history teacher Chuck Noblet. His work as a correspondent on Comedy Central's news-parody series The Daily Show first introduced him to a wide audience.
In 2005, he left The Daily Show to host a spin-off series, The Colbert Report. Following The Daily Show[tpl]'[/tpl]s news-parody concept, The Colbert Report is a parody of personality-driven political opinion shows such as The O'Reilly Factor. Since its debut, the series has established itself as one of Comedy Central's highest-rated series, earning Colbert three Emmy Award nominations and an invitation to perform as featured entertainer at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in 2006. Colbert was named one of Time[tpl]'[/tpl]s 100 most influential people in 2006 and 2012.[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1975813_1975838_1976306,00.html|title = Stephen Colbert - The 2006 TIME 100 - TIME|author=Brian Williams|publisher = Time|date = May 8, 2006|accessdate = July 25, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2111975_2111976_2111953,00.html|title= Stephen Colbert - 2012 TIME 100: The Most Influential People in the World - TIME|author=Garry Trudeau|publisher = Time|date = April 16, 2012|accessdate = July 25, 2012[/tpl] His book I Am America (And So Can You!) was number one on The New York Times Best Seller list.

==Early life==

Colbert was born in Washington, D.C.,[tpl]cite news|title = A Funny Man of Good Report|publisher = Northwestern Magazine|first = Marley|last = Seaman|date = Winter 2005|url = http://www.northwestern.edu/magazine/winter2005/alumninews/close-ups/colbert.html|accessdate = July 11, 2007[/tpl] and grew up in Charleston, South Carolina, on James Island, the youngest of 11 children in a Catholic family.[tpl]cite web|url = http://colbertsheroes.org/articles/CharlestonPost-Apr29-06.shtml|title = Great Charlestonian? ...

His father, James William Colbert, Jr., was a  doctor and medical school dean at Yale University, Saint Louis University, and finally at the Medical University of South Carolina where he served as vice president for academic affairs. Stephen's mother, Lorna Colbert (née Tuck), was a homemaker.[tpl]cite web|title=Family & Education|publisher=Medical University of South Carolina Library|year=2009|url=http://www.library.musc.edu/exhibits/colbert/EarlyYears.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100317083210/http://www.library.musc.edu/exhibits/colbert/EarlyYears.php|archivedate=March 17, 2010[/tpl] In interviews, Colbert describes his parents as devout people who also strongly valued intellectualism and taught their children that it was possible to question the church and still be Catholic.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.timeout.com/newyork/DetailsAr.do?file=hotseat/506/506.hotseat.html|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060820014908/http://www.timeout.com/newyork/DetailsAr.do?file=hotseat/506/506.hotseat.html|archivedate = August 20, 2006|title = Joyce Words|first = David|last = Cote|publisher = Time Out New York|date = June 9, 2005|accessdate = July 30, 2008[/tpl] Via the Internet Archive. The emphasis his family placed on intelligence and his observation of negative stereotypes of Southerners led Colbert to train himself to suppress his Southern accent while he was still quite young. As a child, he observed that Southerners were often depicted as being less intelligent than other characters on scripted television; to avoid that stereotype, he taught himself to imitate the speech of American news anchors.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4464017|title = A Fake Newsman's Fake Newsman: Stephen Colbert|first = Terry|last = Gross|authorlink= Terry Gross|work= Fresh Air|publisher = National Public Radio|date = January 24, 2005|accessdate = July 11, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/27/60minutes/main1553506.shtml|title = The Colbert Report: Morley Safer Profiles Comedy Central's 'Fake' Newsman|first = Morley|last = Safer|authorlink= Morley Safer|publisher = 60 Minutes|date = August 13, 2006|accessdate =August 15, 2006[/tpl]
Colbert sometimes comedically claims his surname is French, but his mother's ancestry was Irish, and his father's ancestry was mostly Irish, with some German and English.[tpl]cite news|last=Gagnon|first=Geoffrey |title=Top of Mind: Extended Q & A with Henry Louis Gates Jr.|pages=|publisher=Boston|year=2010|url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/skipgates/page2|accessdate=February 4, 2010[/tpl]http://ethnicelebs.com/stephen-colbert Many of his ancestors emigrated from Ireland to North America in the 19th century before and during the Great Famine."Faces of America: Stephen Colbert", PBS, Faces of America series, with Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., 2010."Pedigree of Stephen Colbert", Ancestor Tree. Retrieved August 29, 2010. Originally, his surname was pronounced [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|l|b|ər|t[/tpl] in English; Stephen Colbert's father, James, wanted to pronounce the name [tpl]IPAc-en|k|oʊ|l|ˈ|b|ɛər[/tpl], but maintained the [tpl]IPA|/ˈkoʊlbərt/[/tpl] pronunciation out of respect for his own father. He offered his children the option to pronounce the name whichever way they preferred. Stephen started using [tpl]IPA|/koʊlˈbɛər/[/tpl] later in life when he transferred to Northwestern University, taking advantage of the opportunity to reinvent himself in a new place where no one knew him. Stephen's brother, Ed, an intellectual property attorney, retained [tpl]IPA|/ˈkoʊlbərt/[/tpl]; this was shown in a February 12, 2009, appearance on The Colbert Report, when his youngest brother asked him, "[tpl]IPA|/ˈkoʊlbərt/[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA|/koʊlˈbɛər/[/tpl]?" Ed responded "[tpl]IPA|/ˈkoʊlbərt/[/tpl]", to which Stephen jokingly replied, "See you in Hell".[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/218732/february-12-2009/obama-poster-debate---david-ross-and-ed-colbert|title = Obama Poster Debate – David Ross and Ed Colbert|publisher = The Colbert Report|date = February 12, 2009|accessdate = February 15, 2009[/tpl]
On September 11, 1974, when Colbert was 10 years old, his father and two of his brothers, Peter and Paul, were killed in the crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 212 while it was attempting to land in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were en route to enroll the two boys at Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut.[tpl]cite news|title = Obituaries|publisher = Washington Post|date = September 14, 1974[/tpl] Lorna Colbert relocated the family downtown to the more urban environment of East Bay Street in Charleston. Colbert found the transition difficult and did not easily make new friends in his new neighborhood. Colbert later described himself during this time as detached, lacking a sense of importance regarding the things with which other children concerned themselves.[tpl]cite web|url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/433/433111p1.html|title = An Interview with Stephen Colbert|first = Ken|last = P.|publisher = IGN|date =August 11, 2003|accessdate = July 22, 2006[/tpl] He developed a love of science fiction and fantasy novels, especially the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, of which he remains an avid fan. During his adolescence, he also developed an intense interest in fantasy role-playing games, especially Dungeons & Dragons,[tpl]cite web|url = http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/dungeons-dragons-online/537989p1.html|title = Stephen Colbert on D&D|first = Allen|last = Rausch|publisher = GameSpy|date = August 17, 2004|accessdate = July 22, 2006[/tpl] a pastime which he later characterized as an early experience in acting and improvisation.
Colbert attended Charleston's Episcopal Porter-Gaud School, where he participated in several school plays and contributed to the school newspaper but was not highly motivated academically. During his adolescence, he briefly fronted a Rolling Stones cover band[tpl]cite news|last=Daly|first=Steven|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3673509/Stephen-Colbert-the-second-most-powerful-idiot-in-America.html|title= Stephen Colbert: the second most powerful idiot in America – Page 3|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=May 18, 2008|accessdate=May 18, 2008 | location=London[/tpl] called A Shot in the Dark.[tpl]cite web|title=Stephen Colbert's Most Meaningful Musical Moments|url=http://www.npr.org/2012/10/24/163547250/stephen-colberts-most-meaningful-musical-moments|work=Fresh Air|publisher=NPR|accessdate=2012-10-25[/tpl]  When he was younger, he had hoped to study marine biology, but surgery intended to repair a severely perforated eardrum caused him inner ear damage. The damage was severe enough that he was unable to pursue a career that would involve scuba diving.

There he continued to participate in plays while studying mainly philosophy. He found the curriculum rigorous, but was more focused than he had been in high school and was able to apply himself to his studies. Despite the lack of a significant theater community at Hampden-Sydney, Colbert's interest in acting escalated during this time. After two years, he transferred to Northwestern University as a theater major to study performance, emboldened by the realization that he loved performing, even when no one was coming to shows.

==Early career in comedy==

While at Northwestern, Colbert studied with the intent of becoming a dramatic actor; mostly he performed in experimental plays and was uninterested in comedy. He began performing improvisation while in college, both in the campus improv team No Fun Mud Piranhas[tpl]cite news|url = http://www.northwestern.edu/magazine/winter2010/feature/the-real-stephen-colbert.html|title = The Real Stephen Colbert|publisher = Northwestern Magazine|accessdate = 2011-05-01[/tpl] and at the Annoyance Theatre in Chicago as a part of Del Close's ImprovOlympic at a time when the project was focused on competitive, long-form improvisation, rather than improvisational comedy. "I wasn't gonna do Second City", Colbert later recalled, "because those Annoyance people looked down on Second City because they thought it wasn't pure improv—there was a slightly snobby, mystical quality to the Annoyance people". After Colbert graduated in 1986, however, he was in need of a job.  A friend who was employed at Second City's box office offered him work answering phones and selling souvenirs. Colbert accepted and discovered that Second City employees were entitled to take classes at their training center for free. Despite his earlier aversion to the comedy group, he signed up for improvisation classes and enjoyed the experience greatly.
Shortly thereafter, he was hired to perform with Second City's touring company, initially as an understudy for Steve Carell. It was there he met Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello, with whom he often collaborated later in his career. By their retelling, the three comedians did not get along at first—Dinello thought Colbert was uptight, pretentious and cold, while Colbert thought of Dinello as "an illiterate thug"[tpl]cite news|title = Wigging Out|first = Darel|last = Jevens|publisher = Chicago Sun-Times|date = April 27, 2003[/tpl]—but the trio became close friends while touring together, discovering that they shared a similar comic sensibility.
When Sedaris and Dinello were offered the opportunity to create a television series for HBO Downtown Productions, Colbert left The Second City and relocated to New York to work with them on the sketch comedy show Exit 57. The series debuted on Comedy Central in 1995 and aired through 1996. Although it lasted for only 12 episodes, the show received favorable reviews[tpl]cite news|title = Critic's Corner|first = Matt|last = Roush|publisher = USA TODAY|date = August 18, 1995[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title = The new skitcoms: Sketches of pain|first = David|last = Lipsky|publisher = Rolling Stone|date = January 21, 1995[/tpl] and was nominated for five CableACE Awards in 1995, in categories including best writing, performance, and comedy series.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/news_team/correspondents/stephen_colbert.jhtml|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051026174626/http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/news_team/correspondents/stephen_colbert.jhtml|archivedate = October 26, 2005|title = Biography of Stephen Colbert at The Daily Show official website|publisher = Comedy Central|accessdate = July 22, 2006[/tpl]
Following the cancellation of Exit 57, Colbert worked for six months as a cast member and writer on The Dana Carvey Show, alongside former Second City castmate Steve Carell, as well as Robert Smigel, Charlie Kaufman, Louis C.K., and Dino Stamatopoulos, among others. The series, described by one reviewer as "kamikaze satire" in "borderline-questionable taste", had sponsors pull out after its first episode aired and was cancelled after seven episodes.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.salon.com/09/reviews/carvey1.html|title = Dana Carvey bites the hand that feeds him|first = Joyce|last = Millman|publisher = Salon.com|date = February 15, 1996|accessdate = November 25, 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061125183623/http://www.salon.com/09/reviews/carvey1.html |archivedate = November 25, 2006[/tpl] Colbert then worked briefly as a freelance writer for Saturday Night Live with Robert Smigel. Smigel brought his animated sketch, The Ambiguously Gay Duo, to SNL from The Dana Carvey Show; Colbert provided the voice of Ace on both series, opposite Steve Carell as Gary. Needing money, he also worked as a script consultant for VH1 and MTV, before taking a job filming humorous correspondent segments for Good Morning America. Only two of the segments he proposed were ever produced and only one aired, but the job led his agent to refer him to The Daily Show's then-producer, Madeline Smithberg, who hired Colbert on a trial basis in 1997.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a238.asp|title = So What Do You Do, Stephen Colbert?|first = Jacqueline|last = Schneider|publisher = Mediabistro.com|date = May 6, 2003|accessdate = July 22, 2006[/tpl]

==Television career==

===Strangers with Candy===

During the same period, Colbert worked again with Sedaris and Dinello to develop a new comedy series for Comedy Central, Strangers with Candy. Comedy Central picked up the series in 1998 after Colbert had already begun working on The Daily Show. As a result he accepted a reduced role, filming only around 20 Daily Show segments a year while he worked on the new series.
Strangers with Candy was conceived of as a parody of after school specials, following the life of Jerri Blank, a 46-year-old dropout who returns to finish high school after 32 years of life on the street. Most noted by critics for its use of offensive humor, it concluded each episode by delivering to the audience a skewed, politically incorrect moral lesson.[tpl]cite web|title = Review—Strangers With Candy|first = Ken|last = Fox|publisher = TV Guide|url = http://movies.tvguide.com/strangers-candy/review/281396|accessdate = July 11, 2007[/tpl] Colbert served as a main writer alongside Sedaris and Dinello, and portrayed Jerri's strict but uninformed history teacher, Chuck Noblet, seen throughout the series dispensing inaccurate information to his classes. Colbert has likened this to the character he played on The Daily Show and later The Colbert Report, claiming that he has a very specific niche in portraying "poorly informed, high-status idiot" characters. Another running joke throughout the series was that Noblet, a closeted homosexual, was having a "secret" affair with fellow teacher Geoffrey Jellineck despite the fact that their relationship was apparent to everyone around them. This obliviousness also appears in Colbert's Daily Show and Colbert Report character.
Thirty episodes of Strangers with Candy were made, which aired on Comedy Central in 1999 and 2000. Though its ratings were not remarkable during its initial run, it has been characterized as a cult show with a small but dedicated audience.[tpl]cite news|title = 50 Best TV Shows on DVD|first = Mandi|last = Bierly|publisher = Entertainment Weekly|date = November 26, 2004[/tpl] Colbert reprised his role for a film adaptation, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2005 and had a limited release in 2006. The film received mixed reviews. Colbert also co-wrote the screenplay with Sedaris and Dinello.[tpl]cite web|title = Strangers With Candy (2006): Reviews|publisher = Metacritic|url = http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/strangerswithcandy?q=strangers%20with%20candy|accessdate = July 11, 2007[/tpl]

===The Daily Show===

Stephen Colbert joined the cast of Comedy Central's parody-news series The Daily Show in 1997, when the show was in its second season. Originally one of four correspondents who filmed segments from remote locations in the style of network news field reporters, Colbert was referred to as "the new guy" on-air for his first two years on the show, during which time Craig Kilborn served as host. When Kilborn left the show prior to the 1999 season, Jon Stewart took over hosting duties, also serving as a writer and co-executive producer. From this point, the series gradually began to take on a more political tone and increase in popularity, particularly in the latter part of the 2000 U.S. presidential election season. The roles of the show's correspondents were expanded to include more in-studio segments, as well as international reports which were almost always done in the studio with the aid of a greenscreen.
Unlike Stewart, who essentially hosts The Daily Show as himself,[tpl]cite news|title = The American Bald Ego|first = James|last = Poniewozik|publisher = Time|date = November 6, 2005|accessdate = October 30, 2006|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126747,00.html[/tpl] Colbert developed a correspondent character for his pieces on the series. Colbert has described his correspondent character as "a fool who has spent a lot of his life playing not the fool — one who is able to cover it at least well enough to deal with the subjects that he deals with". Colbert was frequently pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects, or against Stewart in scripted exchanges, with the resultant dialogue demonstrating the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he is discussing. Colbert also made generous use of humorous fallacies of logic in explaining his point of view on any topic. Other Daily Show correspondents have adopted a similar style; former correspondent Rob Corddry recalls that when he and Ed Helms first joined the show's cast in 2002, they "just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two". Correspondent Aasif Mandvi has stated "I just decided I was going to do my best Stephen Colbert impression".
Colbert has appeared in several recurring segments for The Daily Show, including "Even Stevphen" with Steve Carell,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/340910/july-07-2010/steve-carell|title=Steve Carell — The Colbert Report — July 7, 2010 - Video Clip [tpl]![/tpl] Comedy Central|author=Colbert Nation|publisher=Comedy Central|date=July 7, 2010|accessdate=November 25, 2010[/tpl] in which both characters were expected to debate a selected topic but instead would unleash their anger at one another. Colbert commonly hosted "This Week in God", a report on topics in the news pertaining to religion, presented with the help of the "God Machine". Colbert filed reports from the floor of the Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention as a part of The Daily Show's award-winning coverage of the 2000 and 2004 U.S. Presidential elections; many from the latter were included as part of their The Daily Show: Indecision 2004 DVD release. In several episodes of The Daily Show, Colbert filled in as anchor in the absence of Jon Stewart, including the full week of March 3, 2002, when Stewart was scheduled to host Saturday Night Live. After Colbert left the show, Rob Corddry took over "This Week in God" segments, although a recorded sample of Colbert's voice is still used as the sound effect for the God Machine. Later episodes of The Daily Show have reused older Colbert segments under the label "Klassic Kolbert". Colbert won three Emmys as a writer of The Daily Show in 2004, 2005, and 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://comedians.about.com/od/comediansal/p/stephencolbert.htm|title=Stephen Colbert Biography — Biography of Comedian Stephen Colbert|author=Patrick Bromley|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=November 25, 2010[/tpl]

===The Colbert Report===

Since October 17, 2005, Colbert has hosted his own television show, The Colbert Report, a Daily Show spin-off which parodies the conventions of television news broadcasting, particularly cable-personality political talk shows like The O'Reilly Factor and Glenn Beck.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/03/27/060327fa_fact|title = Bill O'Reilly's baroque period.|first = Nicholas|last = Lemann|publisher = The New Yorker|date = March 27, 2006|accessdate = July 8, 2006[/tpl] Colbert hosts the show in-character as a blustery right-wing pundit, generally considered to be an extension of his character on The Daily Show. Conceived by co-creators Stewart, Colbert, and Ben Karlin in part as an opportunity to explore "the character-driven news", the series focuses less on the day-to-day news style of the Daily Show, instead frequently concentrating on the foibles of the host-character himself.
The concept for The Report was first seen in a series of Daily Show segments which advertised the then-fictional series as a joke. It was later developed by Stewart's Busboy Productions and pitched to Comedy Central, which greenlighted the program; Comedy Central had already been searching for a way to extend the successful Daily Show franchise beyond a half hour.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.medialifemagazine.com/the-wit-and-sense-of-colbert-report/ |title = The wit and sense of 'Colbert Report'|publisher = Media Life|first = Toni|last = Fitzgerald|date = October 20, 2005|accessdate = July 11, 2007[/tpl] The series opened to strong ratings, averaging 1.2 million viewers nightly during its first week on the air. Comedy Central signed a long-term contract for The Colbert Report within its first month on the air, when it immediately established itself among the network's highest-rated shows.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b51015_Comedy_Central_Keeps_Colbert.html|first = Charlie|last = Amter|title = Comedy Central Keeps Colbert|publisher = E!

Much of Colbert's personal life is reflected in his character on The Colbert Report. With the extended exposure of the character on the show, he often references his interest in and knowledge of Catholicism, science fiction, and The Lord of the Rings, as well as using real facts to create his character's history. His alternate persona was also raised in South Carolina, is the youngest of 11 siblings and is married.[tpl]cite web|last=Gordon|first=Avery|title=Stephen's bio from Colbertnation.com|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/cn/stephens-bio.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080325224351/http://www.colbertnation.com/cn/stephens-bio.php|archivedate=March 25, 2008|publisher = Comedy Central|accessdate =June 15, 2007[/tpl] The actual Colbert's career history in acting and comedy, however, is often downplayed.
In July 2012, Colbert added two years to his contract with Comedy Central, extending the run of the Colbert Report until at least the end of 2014.[tpl]cite news |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/stewart-and-colbert-extend-comedy-central-contracts/?smid=tw-nytimes |title=Stewart and Colbert Extend Comedy Central Contracts - NYTimes.com | work=The New York Times | first=Bill |last=Carter |date=July 25, 2012[/tpl]

After the 2012 New Hampshire primary, a poll for the subsequent South Carolina primary taken by Public Policy Polling (of 1,112 likely GOP voters, Jan 5–7, 2012) was reported to place Stephen Colbert at 5%, one point ahead of Jon Huntsman polling at 4%, in spite of the fact that Colbert was not on the ballot. This poll showed Colbert to be closely behind Rick Perry's 7% and Ron Paul's 8% (with Romney at 27%, Gingrich 23% and Santorum at 18%). On the January 11 episode of the Colbert Report, Colbert asked his audience if he should run for President in South Carolina, to which he received strong applause. He then stated that he would be making a "Major Announcement" during the next day's show. On January 12, Colbert started his show by discussing his role in the Presidential campaign, then addressed the law preventing him from being a Presidential candidate while running his Super PAC. With the help of his lawyer Trevor Potter, he then signed over control of his Super PAC to Jon Stewart, with the organization title then being referred to as "The Definitely Not Coordinating With Stephen Colbert Super PAC".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.colbertsuperpac.com/ |title= Under New Management! |publisher= Colbert Super PAC | accessdate=2012-05-02[/tpl] Immediately after this legal block was out of the way, Colbert announced, "I am forming an exploratory committee to lay the groundwork for my possible candidacy for the President of the United States of South Carolina. I'm doin' it!" He reiterated in the interview portion of that show that "I'm still in the exploratory phase" of his Presidential campaign.
On the January 16, 2012, episode, Colbert encouraged his viewers to vote for Herman Cain in the South Carolina primary. As Cain was still on the ballot, despite having recently dropped out of the race, Colbert announced that he would consider any votes cast for Cain to be in direct support of his own possible candidacy.

===Other work===

Stephen Colbert is co-author of the satirical text-and-picture novel Wigfield: The Can Do Town That Just May Not, which was published in 2003 by Hyperion Books. The novel was a collaboration between Colbert, Amy Sedaris, and Paul Dinello, and tells the story of a small town threatened by the impending destruction of a massive dam. The narrative is presented as a series of fictional interviews with the town's residents, accompanied by photos. The three authors toured performing an adaptation of Wigfield on stage the same year the book was released.[tpl]cite news|title = 'Daily Show' meets Second City in 'Wigfield' tour|first = Nina|last = Metz|publisher = Chicago Tribune|date = April 27, 2003[/tpl]

Colbert is a producer of The 1 Second Film, the world's largest nonprofit collaborative art film.
