Igloolik (Syllabics: ᐃᒡᓗᓕᒃ [tpl]Pronunciation-needed[/tpl], sometimes spelled Iglulik), is an Inuit hamlet, in Foxe Basin, Qikiqtaaluk Region in Nunavut, northern Canada. Because it is located on Igloolik Island, close to the Melville Peninsula, it is often mistakenly thought to be on the peninsula. The name "Igloolik" means "there is a house here". It derives from iglu, meaning house or building, and refers to the sod houses that were originally in the area, not to snow igloos.Igloolik, Nunavut in Inuktitut.Igloolik at the Qikiqtani Inuit Association The residents are called Iglulingmiut (the suffix miut means "people of"). The mayor of Igloolik is Joe Inooya.

==History==

Information about the area’s earliest inhabitants comes mainly from numerous archeological sites on the island; some dating back more than 4,000 years. First contact with Europeans came when British Navy ships HMS Fury and HMS Hecla, under the command of Captain William Edward Parry, wintered in Igloolik in 1822.
The island was visited in 1867 and 1868 by the American explorer Charles Francis Hall in his search for survivors of the lost Franklin Expedition. In 1913, Alfred Tremblay, a French-Canadian prospector with Captain Joseph Bernier’s expedition to Pond Inlet, extended his mineral exploration overland to Igloolik, and in 1921 a member of Knud Rasmussen's Fifth Thule Expedition visited the island.
The first permanent presence by southerners in Igloolik came with the establishment of a Roman Catholic Mission in the 1930s. By the end of the decade, the Hudson's Bay Company had also set up a post on the island.
Non-indigenous establishments, such as RCMP stations, day schools, and clinics, were here before they came to be in surrounding communities. The Igloolik Research Centre focuses on documenting Inuit traditional knowledge and technology, as well as climatology and seismic data research.[tpl]cite web |url=http://siempre.arcus.org/4DACTION/wi_alias_fsDrawPage/1/44 |title=Igloolik, NU |accessdate=2007-10-17 |publisher=Alias:Arctic Logistics Information and Support |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070806083016/http://siempre.arcus.org/4DACTION/wi_alias_fsDrawPage/1/44  |archivedate = 2007-08-06[/tpl]

==Culture==

Anthropologically, Iglulik Inuit are usually considered to be the Iglulingmiut, the Aivilingmiut,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aaanativearts.com/article906.html |title=Clothing, footwear and territory of the Caribou Inuit |publisher=aaanativearts.com |accessdate=2007-12-26[/tpl] and the Tununirmiut, the Inuit Inupiaq-speakers on northern Baffin Island, on Southampton Island, and in the Melville Peninsula.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.everyculture.com/North-America/Iglulik-Inuit.html |title= Iglulik Inuit|accessdate=2007-10-17 |publisher=everyculture.com[/tpl]
An ancient legend from the Igloolik area was adapted by Zacharias Kunuk into the award-winning Canadian film Atanarjuat in 2001. In 2004, Isuma produced the film The Journals of Knud Rasmussen which was released in September 2006 after premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival.
Igloolik is also the home-base of the only Inuit circus, Artcirq. This collective is active in video-making, music production and live circus show performances. Early in 2008, when temperatures in Igloolik were at [tpl]convert|-50|C|abbr=on[/tpl], eight members of Artcirq went to Essakane north of Timbuktu, Mali, where temperatures were [tpl]convert|40|C|abbr=on[/tpl], to perform at the Festival au Désert.Hottest ticket in Malian capital involves the InuitArtcirq In February 2010, six members of Artcirq represented Nunavut in performances at the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, British Columbia.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2009/1222/Bringing-circus-and-new-hope-to-a-remote-Arctic-village |title= People Making a Difference|accessdate=2009-12-27 |publisher=csmonitor.com[/tpl]
In late 2007, the Igloolik HTO (Hunter and Trappers Organization) banned all forms of tourism (sport hunting, filming, photography, watching) related to the northern Foxe Basin walrus population for a period of two years. This ban was in response to an observed decrease in walrus. The Igloolik Inuit continue to harvest walrus while the tourism ban is in place.

==Demographics==

As of the 2011 census, the population was 1,454, a decrease 5.5% from the previous census.  In the 2006 census, the population was 1,538, an increase of 19.6% from the 2001 census.2006 census

==Environmental concerns==

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation interviewed people from the region in April 2008, about their concerns over plans to ship iron ore from the nearby Steensby Inlet on Baffin Island from the Baffinland Iron Mine.
Jaypetee Palluq, an Igloolik resident who had been asked to serve on a Baffinland advisory committee, was concerned that the mine's operation would interfere with the traditional hunts for sea mammals, like
Walrus.
He called on Baffinland to "find an alternate shipping route to the mine, regardless of the cost."
Paul Quassa, Former Mayor of Igloolik, also expressed concern, over the effect of freighters on the ice used by the Walrus. He said the region was known for its highly prized aged, fermented walrus meat, a valuable export from the region.
