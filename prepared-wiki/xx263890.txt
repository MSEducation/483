==Functions==

BackType has two functions. The first is letting people create individual profiles on themselves that link together profiles on different social networking web sites. It also lets people "claim" comments via a URL. Any comment in BackType's database with that URL in the comment is linked to the profile. The second function that BackType provides is a search engine function. It allows searches to be formed in the database of social media information by keyword or person.
