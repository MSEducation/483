==History==

The origin of the Hudson's Bay Company's department store format can be traced to 1881, when the company opened its first department store in Winnipeg, Manitoba, under its proper name "Hudson's Bay Company". From 1881 up until 1960, all "Hudson's Bay Company" stores were located in Western Canada and the Canadian Arctic.
In 1960, the HBC acquired Morgan's, a Montreal department chain with stores in Ontario and the island of Montreal. That same year, all the Morgan's stores in Ontario were converted to the "Hudson's Bay Company" brand. Four years later in 1964, its stores outside of Quebec were re-branded as "The Bay" (which had long been used as a shortened nickname for the stores); adopting a logo incorporating a stylized "B" that appeared in the header of HBC's royal charter from 1670. Its stores in Quebec maintained the Morgan's name until 1972, when they were re-branded as "La Baie".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/business/2013/03/06/the_hudsons_bay_company_unveils_new_logo_for_canadas_oldest_department_store.html|title=The Hudson’s Bay Company unveils new logo for Canada’s oldest department store|last=Infantry|first=Ashante|publisher=Toronto Star|date=6 March 2013|accessdate=2013-03-07[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=HBC Heritage|url=http://www.hbcheritage.ca/hbcheritage/history/timeline/hbc/home|publisher=Hudson's Bay Company|accessdate=4 March 2013[/tpl] That same year, Hudson's Bay purchased Ottawa's Freimans department store and moved from the former Morgan's building on Sparks Street to the Freiman building on Rideau Street, closer to competing Ogilvy's and Caplan's.
The Bay further expanded its presence between 1989 and 1991 in Eastern Canada by absorbing the Simpsons department store chain, and 1993 in Western Canada by taking over many former Woodward's outlets.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hbc.com/hbcheritage/history/acquisitions/retail/simpsons.asp |title=Hbc Heritage | Heritage Home |publisher=Hbc.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20[/tpl] The Toronto Queen Street flagship store was previously a Simpsons department store.
