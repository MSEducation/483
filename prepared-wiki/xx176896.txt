==Biography==

Rasmus was born in 1976, is of partly Swedish descent but grew up in the Copenhagen suburb of Hørsholm - in the same community as Jesper Kyd (composer of the Hitman soundtracks), with whom he later on had a working relation during the development of Hitman Blood Money.
Rasmus started out as a 3D animator, doing effects for films and commercials, before turning to the game industry in 2000.
Hitman Blood Money was simultaneously released on PC, Xbox, PS2 and Xbox 360 and was the first "next generation" game released by IO Interactive.
When the weapon sounds were recorded for Hitman Blood Money, the team arranged to use the weapons collection at "Tøjhusmuseet" which is a large Danish collection of old and contemporary military equipment. All cocking and re-loading sounds were recorded from their original counterparts.
Hitman Blood Money was nominated for 3 Bafta Video Game Awards for "Game Sponsored by PC World", "Artistic Achievement" and "Best Characters".
Rasmus Højengaard has also been credited for work on several other games, including Hitman: Codename 47, Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, Freedom Fighters and Hitman: Contracts.
The Hitman (2007 film) that was released in 2007 is based on the main character of the Hitman games, Agent 47. The Franz Schubert music piece used in the movie's introduction is directly derived from the game that also uses it (although in another version) for the game's introduction movie.
During late 2006 and first half of 2007, Rasmus Højengaard worked as Head of Design for C4-world A/S http://www.c4-world.com. Here he led the design of the controversial investment platform MyC4  that was developed to create a creative and inspiring platform on which people can invest, debate and network within the fields of business and entrepreneurship in emerging countries. The platform uses gaming principles to create stickyness and has a very contemporary take on "charity" http://www.linkedin.com/in/rasmushoejengaard.
