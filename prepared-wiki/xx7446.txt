The Mariana Trench or Marianas TrenchVariant according to the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is the deepest part of the world's oceans. It is located in the western Pacific Ocean, to the east of the Mariana Islands. The trench is about [tpl]convert|2550|km|mi[/tpl] long but has an average width of only [tpl]convert|69|km|mi[/tpl]. It reaches a maximum-known depth of 10.911 km (10,911 ± 40 m) or 6.831 mi (36,069 ± 131 ft) at the Challenger Deep, a small slot-shaped valley in its floor, at its southern end, although some unrepeated measurements place the deepest portion at [tpl]convert|11.03|km|mi[/tpl].[tpl]cite encyclopedia | title = Mariana Trench | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | id = [/tpl]
At the bottom of the trench the water column above exerts a pressure of [tpl]convert|1086|bar|psi[/tpl], over 1000 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level. At this pressure the density of water is increased by 4.96%, making 95 litres of water under the pressure of the Challenger Deep contain the same mass as 100 litres at the surface. The temperature at the bottom is 1 to 4 °C.infoplease.com – The Temperature in the Mariana Trench, read 2012-05-13
The trench is not the part of the seafloor closest to the center of the Earth. This is because the Earth is not a perfect sphere: its radius is about [tpl]convert|25|km|mi[/tpl] less at the poles than at the equator.David R. Williams (17 November 2010).Earth Fact Sheet. National Space Science Data Center. Retrieved 23 March 2012.  As a result, parts of the Arctic Ocean seabed are at least [tpl]convert|13|km|mi[/tpl] closer to the Earth's center than the Challenger Deep seafloor.

==Names==

The Mariana Trench is named for the nearby Mariana Islands (in turn named Las Marianas in honor of Spanish Queen Mariana of Austria, widow of Philip IV of Spain). The islands are part of the island arc that is formed on an over-riding plate, called the Mariana Plate (also named for the islands), on the western side of the trench.

==Geology==

The Mariana Trench is part of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction system that forms the boundary between two tectonic plates. In this system, the western edge of one plate, the Pacific Plate, is subducted (i.e., thrust) beneath the smaller Mariana Plate that lies to the west. Crustal material at the western edge of the Pacific Plate is some of the oldest oceanic crust on earth (up to 170 million years old), and is therefore cooler and more dense; hence its great height difference relative to the higher-riding (and younger) Mariana Plate. The deepest area at the plate boundary is the Mariana Trench proper.
The movement of the Pacific and Mariana plates is also indirectly responsible for the formation of the Mariana Islands. These volcanic islands are caused by flux melting of the upper mantle due to release of water that is trapped in minerals of the subducted portion of the Pacific Plate.

==Measurements==

The trench was first sounded during the Challenger expedition in 1875, which recorded a depth of 4,475 fathoms (8.184 km).[tpl]cite web|url=http://deepseachallenge.com/the-expedition/mariana-trench/ |title=About the Mariana Trench – DEEPSEA CHALLENGE Expedition |publisher=Deepseachallenge.com |date=2012-03-26 |accessdate=2013-07-08[/tpl] In 1877 a map was published called Tiefenkarte des Grossen Ozeans by Petermann, which showed a Challenger Tief at the location of that sounding. In 1899 USS Nero, a converted collier, recorded a depth of 5269 fathoms (9,636 m, 31,614 ft).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hydro-international.com/issues/articles/id1049-Thirty_Years_of_Discovering_the_Mariana_Trench.html|title=Thirty Years of Discovering the Mariana Trench|last=Theberge|first=A.|date=24 March 2009|work=Hydro International|accessdate=31 July 2010[/tpl]
Challenger II surveyed the trench using echo sounding, a much more precise and vastly easier way to measure depth than the sounding equipment and drag lines used in the original expedition. During this survey, the deepest part of the trench was recorded when the Challenger II measured a depth of 5,960 fathoms (10,900 m, 35,760 ft) at [tpl]Coord|11|19|N|142|15|E[/tpl], known as the Challenger Deep.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.marianatrench.com/mariana_trench-exploration_001.htm|title=The Mariana Trench – Exploration|publisher=marianatrench.com[/tpl]
In 1957, the Soviet vessel Vityaz reported a depth of 11,034 m (36,201 ft), dubbed the Mariana Hollow.
In 1962, the surface ship M.V. Spencer F. Baird recorded a maximum depth of 10,915 m (35,840 ft), using precision depth gauges.
In 1984, the Japanese survey vessel Takuyō (拓洋), collected data from the Mariana Trench using a narrow, multi-beam echo sounder; it reported a maximum depth of 10,924 m, also reported as 10,920 ± 10 metres.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/ablos/ABLOS08Folder/Session4-Paper4-Tani.pdf|title=Continental shelf survey of Japan|last=Tani|first=S.|accessdate=24 December 2010[/tpl]

During surveys carried out between 1997 and 2001, a spot was found along the Mariana Trench that had depth similar to that of the Challenger Deep, possibly even deeper.  It was discovered while scientists from the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology were completing a survey around Guam; they used a sonar mapping system towed behind the research ship to conduct the survey.  This new spot was named the HMRG (Hawaii Mapping Research Group) Deep, after the group of scientists who discovered it.[tpl]cite news |title=Sea floor survey reveals deep hole |first=David |last=Whitehouse |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3071749.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=16 July 2003 |accessdate=17 December 2011[/tpl]
On 1 June 2009 sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep by the Simrad EM120 sonar multibeam bathymetry system for deep water (300–11,000 m) mapping aboard the RV Kilo Moana (mothership of the Nereus vehicle), has indicated a spot with a depth of [tpl]convert|10971|m|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. The sonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection, with an accuracy of better than 0.2% of water depth across the entire swath (implying the depth figure is accurate to less than ± 22 metres).[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/UMC/Reports/Archives/KMreportJuneJuly2009.html|title=Daily Reports for R/V KILO MOANA June and July 2009|publisher=University of Hawaii Marine Center[/tpl][tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/UMC/KM/scienceequipment.htm|title=Inventory of Scientific Equipment aboard the R/V KILO MOANA|publisher=University of Hawaii Marine Center[/tpl]
In 2011, it was announced at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting that a US Navy hydrographic ship equipped with a multibeam echosounder conducted a survey which mapped the entire trench to 100 m resolution.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/8940571/Scientists-map-Mariana-Trench-deepest-known-section-of-ocean-in-the-world.html |title=Scientists map Mariana Trench, deepest known section of ocean in the world |accessdate=23 March 2012 |date=7 December 2011 |newspaper=The Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group [/tpl] The mapping revealed the existence of four rocky outcrops thought to be former seamounts.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-02/07/bridges-mariana-trench |title=Four 'bridges' span the Mariana Trench |author=Duncan Geere |accessdate=23 March 2012 |date=7 February 2012 |work=Wired |publisher=Condé Nast Digital [/tpl]
The Mariana Trench is a site chosen by researchers at Washington University and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 2012 for a seismic survey to investigate the subsurface water cycle. Using seismometers and hydrophones the scientists are able to map structures as deep as [tpl]convert|60|miles|km|abbr=on[/tpl] beneath the surface.[tpl]Cite news |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/03/120322142201.htm |title=Seismic Survey at the Mariana Trench Will Follow Water Dragged Down Into the Earth's Mantle |accessdate=23 March 2012 |date=22 March 2012 |work=ScienceDaily  [/tpl]

===Descents===

Four descents have been achieved. The first was the manned descent by Swiss-designed, Italian-built, United States Navy-owned bathyscaphe Trieste which reached the bottom at 1:06 pm on 23 January 1960, with U.S. Navy Lieutenant Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard on board.  Iron shot was used for ballast, with gasoline for buoyancy. The onboard systems indicated a depth of 11,521 m (37,799 ft), but this was later revised to 10,916 m (35,814 ft).National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) webpage. Section "1960 – Man at the Deepest Depth"  The depth was estimated from a conversion of pressure measured and calculations based on the water density from sea surface to seabed.[tpl]cite web |url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/guam/mariana_trench.php |title=Mariana Trench |date=21 October 2009 |work=Earthquake Hazards Program |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=23 March 2012 [/tpl]
This was followed by the unmanned ROVs Kaikō in 1996 and Nereus in 2009. The first three expeditions directly measured very similar depths of 10,902 to 10,916 m.
The fourth was made by Canadian film director James Cameron in 2012. On 26 March, he reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the submersible vessel Deepsea Challenger.[tpl]cite web|author=AP Staff |title=James Cameron has reached deepest spot on Earth|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46850002/ns/technology_and_science-science|date=25 March 2012 |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=25 March 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=Broad |first=William J. |title=Filmmaker in Submarine Voyages to Bottom of Sea |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/science/james-camerons-submarine-trip-to-challenger-deep.html |date=25 March 2012 |work=New York Times |accessdate=25 March 2012 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Than |first=Ker |title=James Cameron Completes Record-Breaking Mariana Trench Dive |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120325-james-cameron-mariana-trench-challenger-deepest-returns-science-sub/ |date=25 March 2012 |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=25 March 2012 [/tpl]

===Planned descents===

As of February 2012, at least three other teams are planning piloted submarines to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench. These include:
Triton Submarines, a Florida based company that designs and manufactures private submarines, for which a crew of three will take 120 minutes to reach the seabed;[tpl]cite web|url=http://tritonsubs.com |title=Triton Submarines |publisher=Tritonsubs.com |accessdate=1 March 2012[/tpl]
Virgin Oceanic, sponsored by Richard Branson's Virgin Group, designed by Graham Hawkes, and piloted by Chris Welsh, for which the solo pilot will take 140 minutes to reach the seabed;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.virginoceanic.com |title=Virgin Oceanic |publisher=Virgin Oceanic |accessdate=1 March 2012[/tpl] and
DOER Marine, a marine technology company, based near San Francisco and set up in 1992, for which a crew of two or three will take 90 minutes to reach the seabed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.doermarine.com |title=DOER Marine |publisher=DOER Marine |date=20 December 2010 |accessdate=1 March 2012[/tpl]

==Life==

The expedition conducted in 1960 observed (with great surprise because of the high pressure) at the bottom large living creatures such as a sole or flounder about 30 cm (1 ft) long, and a shrimp.[tpl]cite web|url=http://geology.com/records/bathyscaphe-trieste.shtml |title=Bathyscaphe Trieste | Mariana Trench | Challenger Deep |publisher=Geology.com |accessdate=1 March 2012[/tpl] According to Piccard, "The bottom appeared light and clear, a waste of firm diatomaceous ooze". Many marine biologists are now sceptical of the supposed sighting of the flatfish, and it is suggested that the creature may instead have been a sea cucumber."James Cameron dives deep for Avatar", Guardian, 18 January 2011"James Cameron heads into the abyss", Nature, 19 March 2012
During the second expedition, the unmanned vehicle Kaikō collected mud samples from the seabed.[tpl]cite book |title=Seven Natural Wonders of the Arctic, Antarctica, and the Oceans |last=Woods |first=Michael |coauthors=Mary B. Woods |year=2009 |publisher=Twenty-First Century Books |isbn=0-8225-9075-1 |page=13 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=nPzhpjGrGo0C |accessdate=23 March 2012[/tpl]  Tiny organisms were found to be living in those samples.
In July 2011 a research expedition deployed untethered landers, called dropcams, equipped with digital video and lights to explore this region of the deep sea.
Amongst many other living organisms, some gigantic single-celled amoebas with a size of more than 4 inches (10 centimeters), belonging to the class of xenophyophores were observed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/16678-giant-amoebas-discovered-deepest-ocean-trench.html|title=Giant amoebas discovered in the deepest ocean trench|accessdate=26 March 2012[/tpl] Xenophyophores are noteworthy for their size, their extreme abundance on the seafloor and their role as hosts for a variety of organisms.

==Possible nuclear waste disposal site==

Like other oceanic trenches, the Mariana Trench has been proposed as a site for nuclear waste disposal, in the hope that tectonic plate subduction occurring at the site might eventually push the nuclear waste deep into the Earth's mantle. However, ocean dumping of nuclear waste is prohibited by international law.[tpl]cite book |author=Hafemeister, David W. |title=Physics of societal issues: calculations on national security, environment, and energy |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2007 |page= 187|isbn=0-387-95560-7 |oclc= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LT4MSqv9QUIC&pg=PA187#v=onepage&q&f=false[/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Kingsley, Marvin G.; Rogers, Kenneth H. |title=Calculated risks: highly radioactive waste and homeland security |publisher=Ashgate |location=Aldershot, Hants, England |year=2007 |pages= 75–76|isbn=0-7546-7133-X |oclc= |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=bOP4-BpYXrEC&pg=PA75[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.law.berkeley.edu/centers/ilr/ona/pages/dumping2.htm |title= Dumping and Loss overview |work=Oceans in the Nuclear Age |accessdate=18 September 2010 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110605190619/http://www.law.berkeley.edu/centers/ilr/ona/pages/dumping2.htm |archivedate=5 June 2011[/tpl] Furthermore, plate subduction zones are associated with very large megathrust earthquakes, the effects of which are unpredictable and possibly adverse to the safety of long-term disposal.
