"The concept of mass distribution does not work in Algeria," added Carrefour. Before that, Carrefour had still only 1 store opened as of 2009 of 18 hypermarkets planned by 2012. The private group Arcofina explained that there was delay because of difficulties in finding available land to open hypermarkets.

In Germany, the biggest hypermarket brands are Real (METRO AG), Kaufland (which belongs to Lidl) and Marktkauf (which is a brand of AVA, which in turn belongs to EDEKA). However, for various reasons, such as the strong competition by more focused discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, as well as legal restrictions on store size, pricing policy, and opening times, the hypermarket concept is not as widespread in Germany as in other countries.
