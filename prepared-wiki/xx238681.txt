The Quail Ridge Wireless Mesh Network project is an effort to provide a wireless communications infrastructure to the wildlife reserve. The network will benefit on-site ecological research and provide a wireless mesh network testbed for development and analysis.
This is a joint project with the University of California Natural Reserve System and the Networks Lab at the Department of Computer Science, UC Davis.
The goal is to create a large scale wireless mesh network backbone deployed within the reserve. Various sensor networks would gather temperature, visual, and acoustic data at certain locations. This information would then be passed back to the field station for storage or for further relay over Ethernet. The backbone nodes will also serve as access points enabling wireless access at their locations.
The Quail Ridge Reserve will also act as a test bed for research in wireless mesh networks. Some of our research goals include:
    * Layer 2 Routing: We would like to forward traffic at the MAC layer in order to avoid excess
      processing time and addressing required by current routing protocols. We are interested in finding
      ways to intelligently select paths for packets at the MAC layer.
    * Monitoring and Maintenance Tools: With access to the Quail Ridge Test Bed, we would like to
      design and develop wireless mesh network monitoring and maintenance tools that would be useful to
      future mesh network administrators and researchers.
