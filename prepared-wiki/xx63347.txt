Brendan Smyth (8 June 1927 – 22 August 1997) was a Roman Catholic priest who became notorious as a child molester, using his position in the Roman Catholic Church to obtain access to his victims. During a period of over 40 years, Smyth sexually abused and indecently assaulted over 100[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8567868.stm|title=Profile of Father Brendan Smyth|work=BBC News|date=15 March 2010|accessdate=15 March 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/cardinal-will-only-step-down-if-told-to-do-so-by-pope-2099642.html|title=Cardinal will only step down if told to do so by Pope|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News & Media|date=15 March 2010|accessdate=15 March 2010[/tpl] children in parishes in Belfast, Dublin and the United States. His actions were frequently hidden from police and the public by Roman Catholic officials. Controversy surrounding his case brought about the downfall of the government of Republic of Ireland in December 1994.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0315/1224266294163.html|title=Coalition in power 2 years when Smyth row erupted|newspaper=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=15 March 2010|accessdate=15 March 2010[/tpl]

==Early life and ordination==

Born John Gerard Smyth,"Evil spirit of a ruined church", The Irish Times (Weekend Review), p5. 20 March 2010. in Belfast, Northern Ireland, Smyth, upon joining the Norbertine Roman Catholic religious order in 1945, changed his name to Brendan. The Norbertines, also known as the "Premonstratensians," were aware of Smyth's crimes as early as the late 1940s, yet they did not report him to either the Garda Síochána or the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Smyth was moved from parish to parish and between dioceses and countries whenever allegations were made. In some cases, the order did not inform the diocesan bishop that Smyth had a history of sexual abuse and should be kept away from children. He abused children in parishes in Rhode Island and North Dakota in the US and was suspected of similar actions while on pastoral work in Wales and Italy. Norbertine Father Bruno Mulvihill made several attempts to alert church authorities about the abuse committed by Smyth.[tpl]cite news|first=Grainne|last=Cunningham|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/priest-who-blew-whistle-on-smyth-estranged-from-order-2101285.html|title=Priest who blew whistle on Smyth estranged from order|newspaper=Irish Independent|date=17 March 2010|accessdate=17 March 2010[/tpl]

==1994 arrest==

Smyth's first conviction followed the reporting to police of his abuse of four siblings in Belfast's Falls Road. After his arrest in 1991, he fled to the Republic of Ireland, where he spent the next three years on the run, staying mostly at Kilnacrott Abbey. This led to the collapse of the Fianna Fáil–Labour Party coalition government when the poor handling of an extradition request from the RUC by the Irish Attorney General's office led to a further delay of Smyth's trial. An award-winning UTV Counterpoint programme on the scandal by journalist Chris Moore, followed by a book, accused the head of the Norbertines and the Archbishop of Armagh of mishandling the case, and the Norbertines of negligence and a failure to tell others of Smyth's crimes, enabling Smyth to sexually abuse large numbers of children for 40 years.

==Death==

Smyth died at 70 in prison of a heart attack in 1997 after collapsing in the exercise yard,[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-08-24/news/1997236023_1_smyth-ireland-irish-republic|title=Few voice sympathy at death of molester: Pedophile priest's case undermined reverence for Catholic Church|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|date=24 August 1997|accessdate=14 June 2011[/tpl] one month into a twelve year prison sentence. The Norbertines held his funeral before dawn and covered his grave with concrete to deter vandalism. Smyth was buried in Kilnacrott Abbey, which was later put up for sale with [tpl]convert|44|acres[/tpl] of land, including the grave.[tpl]cite news|first=Jerome|last=Reilly|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/abbey-for-sale-with-pervert-priests-grave-included-1339709.html|title=Abbey for sale, with pervert priest's grave included|newspaper=Sunday Independent|publisher=Independent News & Media|date=6 April 2008|accessdate=6 April 2008[/tpl]
On 27 October 2005, one of Smyth's victims succeeded in having the title "Reverend" removed from the gravestone.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2010/0320/1224266695572.html|title=Evil spirit of a ruined hurch|newspaper=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=20 March 2010|accessdate=19 June 2010[/tpl]kshaw (27 October 2005).

==Later investigations==

Reviewers of the case differ as to whether there was a deliberate plot to conceal Smyth's behaviour, incompetence by his superiors at Kilnacrott Abbey, or some combination of factors. Cahal Daly, both as Bishop of Down and Connor, a diocese where some of the abuse took place, and later as Cardinal Archbishop of Armagh, is recorded as having been privately furious at the Norbertine "incompetence".[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
In 2010, Daly's successor as Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, Cardinal Seán Brady, faced "huge pressure to resign" after he admitted that in 1975 he witnessed two teenage boys sign oaths of silence after testifying in a Church inquiry against Smyth.  Survivors groups saw this as evidence of collusion, but Brady said he "did not have the authority" to turn Smyth in.[tpl]cite news|url=|first1=Simon|last1=Caldwell|first2=Nick|last2=Pisa|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1257904/Irelands-Catholic-leader-Sean-Brady-paedophile-priest-cover-up.html|title=Leader of Roman Catholic Church in Ireland urged to quit over abuse victims' silence vow|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=15 March 2010|accessdate=15 March 2010[/tpl] On 17 March 2010, the Deputy First Minister for Northern Ireland, Martin McGuinness, called for Brady to resign.[tpl]cite news|first1=John|last1=Cooney|first2=Ciaran|last2=Byrne|first3=Breda|last3=Heffernan|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/shamed-plea-buys-brady-more-time-to-stay-as-leader-2102852.html|title='Shamed' plea buys Brady more time to stay as leader|newspaper=Irish Independent|publisher=Independent News & Media|date=18 March 2010|accessdate=18 March 2010[/tpl]

==Dramatisation==

A two-part dramatisation of the Smyth case, Brendan Smyth: Betrayal of Trust, was broadcast by the BBC on 13 March 2011 with Ian Beattie in the title role and Richard Dormer as Chris Moore. It was directed by Michael McDowell.
