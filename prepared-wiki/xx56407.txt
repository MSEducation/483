The group then suggested Road Apples, local slang for frozen horse-droppings, and the record label, unaware of its meaning, liked it. The album has been certified 8x platinum  in Canada.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cria.ca/goldplat.php|title=Canadian Recording Industry Association|format=Requires running a searches for Artist|year=2010|accessdate=2010-05-03[/tpl]
