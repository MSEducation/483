Almondell and Calderwood Country Park is a [tpl]convert|220|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] Country Park in Mid Calder and East Calder in West Lothian, Scotland. The park is split into two main areas, Almondell Park which comprises the Almondell estate which originally belonged to the Erskine family of Broxburn and the Calderwood estate which once belonged to the Barons of Torphichen. 
The Almondell Estate follows the line of the River Almond, with well made paths and roads criss crossing the river over a variety of bridges. It is a popular location with walkers and families.
The Calder Wood Estate is less developed with most paths being unpaved and often very muddy after wet weather. It is popular with walkers and mountain bikers. The two estates are separated by Mid Calder town centre but are linked together by a path following the line of the Murieston Water.
The Park is served with ample space for visitorsâ€™ cars, served by four main car-parks. These are situated near Broxburn, Livingston, Mid Calder and East Calder. The North car-park is closest to the Visitor Centre (EH52 5PE). Visitor Centre is housed in the former stable block of the Almondell Estate, with a coffee shop, aquarium, and classroom and function room facilities. There are many woodland and riverside walks, BBQ sites, toilet facilities and children's play areas. The Ranger Service arranges talks and school visits.
