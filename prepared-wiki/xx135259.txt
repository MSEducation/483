[[The Diary of Horace Wimp]]

"The Diary of Horace Wimp" is the fourth track on the Electric Light Orchestra album Discovery, written by Jeff Lynne.
Released in 1979 as a single, the song is Beatlesque in nature and became a Top Ten hit in the UK and Ireland. The lyrics describe a week in the life of a repressed man who nevertheless overcomes his shy nature with the help of "a voice from above." The day Saturday is omitted â€“ this is because, as explained by Jeff Lynne: "'The football match is played on a Saturday".
Jeff Lynne references Citizen Kane when he says "Horace Wimp" while actually seeing a close-up shot of his lips at the end in its music videoELO - The Diary of Horace Wimp as well just like Orson Welles did with "Rosebud".CITIZEN KANE - Rosebud

===Down Home Town===

"Down Home Town" first appeared on the band's fifth album Face the Music. It also featured as the flip side to the US single "Last Train to London".
"Down Home Town" contains an intro with a backmasking message, the backing chorus of the previous track, "Waterfall": "Face the mighty waterfall, face the mighty waterfall." This song includes an orchestral intro (after the "Waterfall" refrain) and a similar ending.
"Another backward message was used in the beginning of "Down Home Town" by singing twice: 'There is the mighty waterfall.' Those reverse recorded words were only used because of the sound effect, but some fanatical christians sic in the USA were sure they heard, as several hysterics put it 'satanic messages' hidden on the record".[tpl]cite book |last=Guttenbacher |first=Patrik |first2=Marc |last2=Haines |first3=Alexander |last3=von Petersdorff | title=Unexpected Messages |date=1996[/tpl]
