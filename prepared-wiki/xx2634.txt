Dale Chihuly (born September 20, 1941), is an American glass sculptor and entrepreneur.  His works are considered unique to the field of blown glass, "moving it into the realm of large-scale sculpture," (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston).  The technical difficulties of working with glass forms are considerable,  yet Chihuly uses it as the primary medium for installations and environmental artwork.Chihuly:  Through the looking glass.

==Life and career==

Chihuly was born in Tacoma, Washington, where he graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School. He enrolled at the College of the Puget Sound in 1959. A year later, he transferred to the University of Washington in Seattle, where in 1965 he received a bachelor of arts degree in interior design. While at the University of Washington, he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Kappa Epsilon chapter).Dale Chihuly - Chronology, from Chihuly's personal website
In the year 1967, he received a Master of Science in sculpture from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he studied under Harvey Littleton. In 1968, he studied glass in Venice on a Fulbright Fellowship and received a Master of Fine Arts at the Rhode Island School of Design. In 1971, with the support of John Hauberg and Anne Gould Hauberg, Chihuly cofounded the Pilchuck Glass School near Stanwood, Washington. Chihuly also founded the HillTop Artists program in Tacoma, Washington at  Jason Lee Middle School and Wilson High School. In 1976, while Chihuly was in England, he was involved in a head-on car accident during which he flew through the windshield.Glass Houses: Dale Chihuly Files a Lawsuit That Raises Big Questions... About Dale Chihuly, The Stranger, February 2006 His face was severely cut by glass and he was blinded in his left eye. After recovering, he continued to blow glass until he dislocated his right shoulder in a 1979 bodysurfing accident. No longer able to hold the glass blowing pipe, he hired others to do the work. Chihuly explained the change in a 2006 interview, saying "Once I stepped back, I liked the view" and pointed out that it allowed him to see the work from more perspectives and enabled him to anticipate problems faster. Chihuly describes his role as "more choreographer than dancer, more supervisor than participant, more director than actor." San Diego Union-Tribune reporter Erin Glass wrote that she "wonders at the vision of not just the artist Chihuly, but the wildly successful entrepreneur Chihuly, whose estimated sales by 2004 was reported by The Seattle Times as $29 million."‘Chihuly’ a site-specific explosion of art at Salk, by Erin Glass, San Diego Union-Tribune, 22 April 2010 Chihuly and his team of artists were the subjects of the documentary Chihuly Over Venice. They were also featured in the documentary Chihuly in the Hotshop, syndicated to public television stations by American Public Television starting on November 1, 2008.Chihuly Over Venice, from Chihuly's Portland Press website

==About his work==

Regina Hackett, as the Seattle Post-Intelligencer art critic, provided a chronology of his work during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s:
For his exhibition in Jerusalem in 2000, in addition to the glass pieces, he had enormous blocks of transparent ice brought in from an Alaskan artesian well and formed a wall, echoing the stones of the nearby Citadel. Lights with color gels were set up behind them for illumination. Chihuly said the melting wall represented the "dissolution of barriers" between people.[tpl]cite web| title=Cooling a hotbed of unrest in Mideast? | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/721087/Cooling-a-hotbed-of-unrest-in-Mideast.html| work=Deseret News| author=Cohen, Jay | date=October 4, 1999| accessdate=2010-03-01[/tpl]

==Galleries==

Chihuly's largest permanent exhibit can be found at the Oklahoma City Museum of Art. Chihuly maintains two retail stores in partnership with MGM Resorts International. One is located at the Bellagio on the Las Vegas Strip,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bellagio.com/shopping/via-fiore.aspx |title=List of stores |publisher=Bellagio.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-20[/tpl] from the Bellagio hotel/casino website the other at the MGM Grand Casino in Macau.Press release by MGM Macau mentioning Chihuly shop (search for "Chihuly retail")[tpl]dead link|date=December 2012[/tpl] A number of other galleries also carry his pieces. He also has a gallery in Las Vegas in the Crystals in the Las Vegas City Center in Gallery Row. In 1983 Chihuly returned to his native Pacific Northwest where he continued to develop his own work at the Pilchuck Glass School, which he had helped to found in 1971. Throughout the 1970s, influenced by the great glassblowing tradition of Murano, Chihuly experimented with the team approach to glassblowing. Working with a team of master glassblowers and assistants has enabled him to produce architectural glass art of a scale and quantity unimaginable working alone or with only one assistant. In 2010 the Space Needle Corporation submitted a proposal for an exhibition of Chihuly's work at a site in the Seattle Center, in competition with proposals for other uses from several other groups.[tpl]citation |url= http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2011299316_glasshouse09m.html |title= Chihuly glass museum proposed at Seattle Center where Fun Forest stood |first= Emily |last= Heffter |date = 10 June 2010 | newspaper= Seattle Times [/tpl][tpl]citation |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2012083798_chihuly11m.html |title=In a second attempt to sell the city and the public on a Dale Chihuly glass exhibit at Seattle Center |first= Emily |last= Heffter |date = 10 June 2010 | newspaper= Seattle Times [/tpl] The project, which sees the new Chihuly exhibition hall occupy the site of the former Fun Forest amusement park in the Seattle Center park and entertainment complex, received the final green light from the Seattle City Council on April 25, 2011.[tpl]cite web|last=Davis|first=Ben|title=Divisive Dale Chihuly Glass-Art 'Museum' Approved for Former Seattle Amusement Park|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/37553/divisive-dale-chihuly-glass-art-museum-approved-for-former-seattle-amusement-park|publisher=ArtInfo|accessdate=30 November 2012|date=28 April 2011[/tpl] It opened May 21, 2012.[tpl]cite web|title=Chihuly Garden and Glass Opens with Dedication Ceremony on Monday, May 21|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chihuly-garden-and-glass-opens-with-dedication-ceremony-on-monday-may-21-152260115.html|publisher=PRNewswire|accessdate=30 November 2012|date=21 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Riefe|first=Jordan|title=Dale Chihuly's 'Glass House' Shines in Seattle|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/21/uk-dalechihuly-pix-idUSLNE84K00C20120521|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=30 November 2012|date=21 May 2012[/tpl]

==2006 lawsuit==

In 2006, Chihuly filed a lawsuit against his former longtime employee, glassblower Bryan Rubino, and businessman Robert Kaindl, under accusations of copyright and trademark infringement. Kaindl's pieces used titles Chihuly used for his own works, such as Seaforms and Ikebana, and resembled the construction of Chihuly's pieces. Arguments made by legal experts stated influence on art style is not copyright infringement.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/11/Floridian/Glass_warfare.shtml |title=Glass warfare |work=St. Petersburg Times |date=2006-06-11 |accessdate=2012-12-20[/tpl][tpl]cite news |last=O'Hagan |first=Maureen |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2002686721_chihuly16m.html |title=Glass artist Chihuly's lawsuit tests limits of copyrighting art |work=The Seattle Times |date=December 16, 2005; updated December 20, 2005 |accessdate=2012-12-20[/tpl] Chihuly settled the lawsuit independently with Rubino initially,[tpl]cite news |title=Artists Chihuly, Rubino settle claims; suit against entrepreneur unresolved | url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2003199340_chihuly15m.html |work=The Seattle Times| author=Sheila Farr and Susan Kelleher |date=August 15, 2006 |accessdate=2010-02-25[/tpl] and later Kaindl as well.[tpl]cite work |last=Kelleher |first=Susan |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003484492_chihuly19m.html |title=Chihuly, rival glass artist settle dispute |work=The Seattle Times |date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=2012-12-20[/tpl]
