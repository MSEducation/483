The Real Irish Republican Army or Real IRA, also referred to as the New IRA, is an Irish republican paramilitary organisation which aims to bring about a united Ireland. It formed in 1997 following a split in the Provisional IRA, which had declared a ceasefire that year. Like the Provisional IRA before it, the RIRA sees itself as the only rightful successor to the original Irish Republican Army and styles itself as simply "the Irish Republican Army" in English or Óglaigh na hÉireann in Irish. It is an illegal organisation in Ireland and designated as a terrorist organisation in the United Kingdom and the United States.
Since its formation, the RIRA has waged a campaign in Northern Ireland against the British Army and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), formerly the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). The RIRA is the biggest and most active of the "dissident republican" paramilitaries operating against the British security forces. It has targeted the security forces in gun attacks and bombings, as well as with grenades, mortars and rockets. The organisation has also been responsible for a number of bombings in Northern Ireland and England with the goal of causing economic harm and/or disruption. The most notable of these was the 15 August 1998 Omagh bombing, which killed 29 people. After the bombing, the RIRA went on ceasefire, but began operations again in 2000. In March 2009, it claimed responsibility for an attack on Massereene Barracks that killed two British soldiers, the first to be killed in Northern Ireland since 1997.
The Real IRA has also been involved in vigilantism, mainly against alleged drug dealers and organized crime gangs. In Dublin particularly, it has been accused of extorting and engaging in feuds with these gangs.
In July 2012, it was reported that Republican Action Against Drugs (RAAD) and other small republican militant groups were merging with the Real IRA. As before, the group continues to refer to itself as "the Irish Republican Army".

==Origins==

In July 1997, the Provisional IRA called a ceasefire. On 10 October 1997, a Provisional IRA General Army Convention was held in Falcarragh, County Donegal. At the convention, Provisional IRA Quartermaster General Michael McKevitt, also a member of the 12-person Provisional IRA Executive, denounced the leadership and called for an end to the group's ceasefire and to the participation in the Northern Ireland peace process. He was backed by his partner and fellow Executive member Bernadette Sands-McKevitt. The pair were outmanoeuvred by the leadership, and a key ally, Kevin McKenna, was voted off the IRA Army Council leaving the two dissidents isolated.[tpl]cite book | last = Harnden | first = Toby | authorlink = Toby Harnden | title = Bandit Country | publisher = Hodder & Stoughton | year = 1999 | pages = 429–431 | month = | isbn = 0-340-71736-X[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last = English | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard English | title = Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA | publisher = Pan Books | year = 2003 | page = 296 | doi =  | isbn = 0-330-49388-4[/tpl] The convention backed the pro-ceasefire line, and on 26 October McKevitt and Sands-McKevitt resigned from the Executive along with several other members.[tpl]cite book | author = John Mooney & Michael O'Toole | title = Black Operations: The Secret War Against the Real IRA | publisher = Maverick House | year = 2004 | page = 33 | month = | isbn = 0-9542945-9-9[/tpl]
In November 1997, McKevitt and other dissidents held a meeting in a farmhouse in Oldcastle, County Meath, and a new organisation, styling itself Óglaigh na hÉireann, was formed.Mooney & O'Toole, pp. 38–39. The organisation attracted disaffected Provisional IRA members from Derry and the republican stronghold of South Armagh, as well as other areas including Dublin and Belfast cities and Counties Limerick, Tipperary, Louth, Tyrone, Monaghan, and Kerry.Mooney & O'Toole, p. 47.
The name "Real IRA" entered common usage when members had a roadblock in Jonesborough, County Armagh and told motorists "We're from the IRA. The real IRA".

==Objectives==

The RIRA's ultimate objective is a united Ireland by forcing the end of British sovereignty over Northern Ireland through the use of physical force. The organisation rejects the Mitchell Principles and the Good Friday Agreement, comparing the latter to the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty which resulted in the partition of Ireland.[tpl]cite web | title = 'Real' Irish Republican Army (rIRA) Statement | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/ira/rira280103.htm | publisher = CAIN | date = 28 January 2003 | accessdate = 9 May 2007[/tpl] The organisation aims to uphold an uncompromising form of Irish republicanism and opposes any political settlement that falls short of Irish unity and independence.English, pp. 316–317.
Sands-McKevitt, sister of hunger striker Bobby Sands and a founder of the RIRA's political wing, the 32 County Sovereignty Movement, said in an interview that "Bobby did not die for cross-border bodies with executive powers. He did not die for nationalists to be equal British citizens within the Northern Ireland state". The RIRA adopts similar tactics to those used by the Provisional IRA in the 1990s, primarily using bombs in town centres to damage the economic infrastructure of Northern Ireland. The organisation also attempts to kill members of the security forces using land mines, home-made mortars and car bombs, and targets England using incendiary and car bombs to "spread terror and disruption".[tpl]cite web | title = The Real IRA: after Omagh, what now? | author = Sean Boyne | url = http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/jir/jir980824_1_n.shtml | publisher = Jane's Information Group | date = 24 August 1998 | accessdate = 16 July 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071025035213/http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/jir/jir980824_1_n.shtml  |archivedate = 25 October 2007[/tpl]

==Campaign==

===Early campaign===

The organisation's first action was an attempted bombing in Banbridge, County Down on 7 January 1998. The plot involved a [tpl]convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] car bomb, but it was thwarted after being defused by security forces.Mooney & O'Toole, pp. 68–71.[tpl]cite web | title = Police detonate car bomb in Ulster | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/45270.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 7 January 1998 | accessdate = 8 May 2007[/tpl] The organisation continued its campaign in late February, with bombings in Moira, County Down and Portadown, County Armagh.Mooney & O'Toole, p. 87.[tpl]cite web | title = Eleven injured by Northern Ireland bomb | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/58729.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 21 February 1998 | accessdate = 8 May 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Car bomb explodes in Portadown | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/59314.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 23 February 1998 | accessdate = 8 May 2007[/tpl] On 9 May the organisation formally announced its existence in a coded telephone call to Belfast media claiming responsibility for a mortar attack on a police station in Belleek, County Fermanagh.[tpl]cite web | title = 'True' IRA claims responsibility for blast | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/northern_ireland/latest_news/90405.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 10 May 1998 | accessdate = 8 May 2007[/tpl]
The organisation also carried out attacks in Newtownhamilton and Newry,[tpl]cite web | title = Abstracts on Organisations – 'R' | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/rorgan.htm | publisher = CAIN | date = | accessdate = 5 May 2007[/tpl] and a second attack in Banbridge on 1 August injured 35 people and caused £3.5 million of damage when a [tpl]convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on[/tpl] car bomb exploded.[tpl]cite web | title =  World News Briefs; Car Bomb Wounds 35 in Ulster Town | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E3D71E38F931A3575BC0A96E958260 | publisher = New York Times | date = 2 August 1998 | accessdate = 17 June 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Bomb warning in Banbridge | url = http://www.rte.ie/news/1999/0213/banbridge.html | publisher = RTÉ | date = 13 February 1999 | accessdate = 17 June 2007[/tpl] Despite these attacks the RIRA lacked a significant base and was heavily infiltrated by informers. This led to a series of high profile arrests and seizures by the Garda Síochána in the first half of 1998, including the death of member Rónán Mac Lochlainn who was shot dead trying to escape from police following an attempted robbery of a security van in County Wicklow.Mooney & O'Toole, pp. 70–71, 101–102, 124–129.[tpl]cite web | title = Shot robber 'was republican paramilitary' | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/northern_ireland/latest_news/87549.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 4 May 1998 | accessdate = 8 May 2007[/tpl]

===Omagh bombing===

On 15 August 1998 the RIRA left a car containing 500 lb of home-made explosives in the centre of Omagh, County Tyrone. The bombers could not find a parking space near the intended target of the courthouse, and the car was left 400 metres away.Mooney & O'Toole, pp. 211–212.[tpl]cite web | title = The Omagh Bomb – Main Events | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/omagh/events.htm | publisher = CAIN | date = | accessdate = 28 June 2007[/tpl] As a result three inaccurate telephone warnings were issued, and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) believed the bomb was actually located outside the courthouse. They attempted to establish a security cordon to keep civilians clear of the area, which inadvertently pushed people closer to the actual location of the bomb. Shortly after, the bomb exploded killing 29 people and injuring 220 others, in what became the single deadliest strike of the Troubles.
The bombing caused a major outcry throughout the world, and the Irish and British governments introduced new legislation in an attempt to destroy the organisation.Mooney & O'Toole, p. 232.[tpl]cite web | title = MPs recalled to match Dublin anti-terror law | author = Michael White | url = http://politics.guardian.co.uk/commons/story/0,,795891,00.html | publisher = The Guardian | date = 25 August 1998 | accessdate = 6 May 2007[/tpl] The RIRA also came under pressure from the Provisional IRA, when Provisional IRA members visited the homes of 60 people connected with the RIRA and ordered them to disband and stop interfering with Provisional IRA arms dumps.[tpl]cite web | title = Give up violence or else, Provos tell the 'Real IRA' | author = Sean O'Neill | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1998/09/04/nuls104.html | publisher = The Daily Telegraph | date = 4 May 1998 | accessdate = 8 May 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050316082603/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1998/09/04/nuls104.html |archivedate = 16 March 2005[/tpl] With the organisation under intense pressure, which included McKevitt and Sands-McKevitt being forced from their home after the media named McKevitt in connection with the bombing, the RIRA called a ceasefire on 8 September.[tpl]cite web | title = Candlelight vigil for bomb victims | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/northern_ireland/latest_news/154720.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 20 August 1998 | accessdate = 5 May 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = 1998: Real IRA announce ceasefire | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/8/newsid_2503000/2503633.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 8 September 1998 | accessdate = 5 May 2007[/tpl]

===Ceasefire===

Following the declaration of the ceasefire the RIRA began to regroup, and by the end of October had elected a new leadership and were planning their future direction.Mooney & O'Toole, pp. 257–260. In late December Irish government representative Martin Mansergh held a meeting with McKevitt in Dundalk, in an attempt to convince McKevitt to disband the RIRA. McKevitt refused, stating that members would be left defenceless to attacks by the Provisional IRA. In 1999 the RIRA began preparations for a renewed campaign, and in May three members travelled across Europe to Split in Croatia to purchase arms which were subsequently smuggled back to Ireland.[tpl]cite book | last = Boyne | first = Sean | authorlink = | title = Gunrunners | publisher = O'Brien Press | year = 2006 | pages = 381–382 | doi =  | isbn = 978-1-84717-014-9[/tpl] On 20 October ten people were arrested when Gardaí raided a RIRA training camp near Stamullen, County Meath.[tpl]cite web | title = Garda chief pledges to halt the Real IRA | author = Tom Brady | url = http://www.independent.ie/national-news/garda-chief-pledges-to-halt-the-real-ira-394558.html | publisher = Independent.ie | date = 22 October 1998 | accessdate = 15 June 2007[/tpl]
Officers found a firing range inside a disused wine cellar being used as an underground bunker, and seized weapons including an assault rifle, a submachine gun, a semi-automatic pistol and an RPG-18 rocket launcher.Mooney & O'Toole, pp. 314–315. An earlier version of the rocket launcher, the RPG-7, had been in the possession of the Provisional IRA from as early as 1972, but this was the first time the RPG-18 had been found in the possession of a paramilitary organisation in Ireland.[tpl]cite web | title = Real IRA arms purchasing in Croatia indicates a change of tactics | url = http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/jtsm/jtsm000823_1_n.shtml | publisher = Jane's Information Group | date = 23 August 2000 | accessdate = 28 June 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060624035820/http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/jtsm/jtsm000823_1_n.shtml |archivedate = 24 June 2006[/tpl] Among those convicted were Alan Ryan, who was on bail for possession of a loaded revolver at his home in Dublin.

===Return to activity===

On 20 January 2000 the RIRA issued a call-to-arms in a statement to the Irish News. The statement condemned the Northern Ireland Executive, and stated: "Once again, Óglaigh na hÉireann declares the right of the Irish people to the ownership of Ireland. We call on all volunteers loyal to the Irish Republic to unite to uphold the Republic and establish a permanent national parliament representative of all the people."Mooney & O'Toole, p. 326.[tpl]cite web | title = Real IRA call for unity among all Republicans | url = http://www.rte.ie/news/2000/0120/north.html | publisher = RTÉ | date = 20 January 2000 | accessdate = 15 June 2007[/tpl] The RIRA launched its new campaign on 25 February with an attempted bombing of Shackleton Army Barracks in Ballykelly. The bombers were disturbed as they were assembling the device, which would have caused mass murder if detonated, according to soldiers.[tpl]cite web | title = Police quiz man about bombing | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/656770.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 28 February 2000 | accessdate = 15 June 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Real IRA behind bid to blow up barracks | author = Tom Brady | url = http://www.independent.ie/national-news/real-ira-behind-bid-to-blow-up-barracks-383691.html | publisher = Independent.ie | date = 29 February 2000 | accessdate = 15 June 2007[/tpl]
On 29 February a rocket launcher similar to one seized in the 1999 raid was found near an army base in Dungannon, County Tyrone,[tpl]cite web | title = Rocket launcher linked to dissidents | author = Tom Brady | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/661265.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 29 February 2000 | accessdate = 15 June 2007[/tpl] and on 15 March three men were arrested following the discovery of 500 lb of home-made explosives when the RUC searched two cars in Hillsborough, County Down.[tpl]cite web | title = Explosives find linked to Real IRA | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/679353.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 16 March 2000 | accessdate = 15 June 2007[/tpl] On 6 April a bomb attack took place at Ebrington Army Barracks in Derry. RIRA members lowered a device consisting of 5 lb of home made explosives over the perimeter fence using ropes, and the bomb subsequently exploded damaging the fence and an unmanned guardhouse.[tpl]cite web | title = Bombing blamed on dissidents | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/703814.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 6 April 2000 | accessdate = 15 June 2007[/tpl]Mooney & O'Toole, p. 335.

====Bombings in England====

After the Omagh bombing, the RIRA leadership were unwilling to launch a full-scale campaign in Northern Ireland due to the possibility of civilians being killed.Mooney & O'Toole, p. 338. Instead they decided to launch a series of attacks in England, in particular London, which they hoped would attract disenchanted Provisional IRA members to join the RIRA. On 1 June 2000 a bomb damaged Hammersmith Bridge; a symbolic target for Irish republican paramilitary groups.[tpl]cite web | title = Police hunt bridge bombers | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/774216.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 2 June 2000 | accessdate = 6 May 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Real IRA armed with super mortar | author = Henry McDonald | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,,328022,00.html | publisher = The Guardian | date = 4 June 2000 | accessdate = 15 June 2007[/tpl] The bridge had previously been targeted by the Irish Republican Army on 29 March 1939 as part of its Sabotage Campaign, and by the Provisional IRA on 24 April 1996.[tpl]cite web | title = Bridge survives as IRA's 30lb bombs fail to explode | author = Colin Randall | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1996/04/26/nbomb26.html | publisher = The Daily Telegraph | date = 26 April 1996 | accessdate = 15 June 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20040826074517/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1996/04/26/nbomb26.html |archivedate = 26 August 2004[/tpl]
One month later on 19 July, security forces carried out a controlled explosion on a bomb left at Ealing Broadway station and public transport was disrupted when the Metropolitan Police closed Victoria and Paddington train stations and halted services on the London Underground.[tpl]cite web | title = Bomb scares hit capital | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/840694.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 19 July 2000 | accessdate = 5 May 2007[/tpl] On 21 September a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at the MI6 headquarters using an RPG-22 rocket launcher,[tpl]cite web | title = Security tight in London in wake of MI6 attack | url = http://rte.ie/news/2000/0921/dissidents.html | publisher = RTÉ | date = 21 September 2000 | accessdate = 3 May 2007[/tpl]Boyne, p. 384. which generated headlines around the world.Mooney & O'Toole, pp. 349–350.

====Renewed campaign in Northern Ireland====

The successful attack on Hammersmith Bridge encouraged the RIRA leadership to launch further attacks in Northern Ireland.Mooney & O'Toole, p. 340. On 19 June 2000 a bomb was found in the grounds of Hillsborough Castle, home of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Mandelson.[tpl]cite web | title = Mandelson feels 'safe' despite device | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/798309.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 20 June 2000 | accessdate = 28 June 2007[/tpl] On 30 June a bomb exploded on the Dublin to Belfast railway line near the village of Meigh in County Armagh.

===Arrests===

Despite the RIRA's renewed activity, the organisation became increasingly weaker due to the arrest of key members and continued infiltration by informers. McKevitt was arrested on 29 March 2001 and charged with membership of an illegal organisation and directing terrorism, and remanded into custody.Mooney & O'Toole, pp. 378–381.

In a lengthy interview with An Phoblacht newspaper in 2003, the leadership of the Provisional IRA said that the RIRA had "no coherent strategy".http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/ira/rira280103.htm
The Real IRA were suspected of complicity in the murder in December 2006 of drug-dealer Martin 'Marlo' Hyland.

===2012 onward (New IRA)===

On 26 July 2012, it was reported that Republican Action Against Drugs (RAAD) and other small republican militant groups were merging with the Real IRA. As before, the group would continue to refer to itself as "the Irish Republican Army". It issued the following statement:
 The leadership of the Irish Republican Army remains committed to the full realisation of the ideals and principles enshrined in the Proclamation of 1916.
 In recent years the establishment of a free and independent Ireland has suffered setbacks due to the failure among the leadership of Irish nationalism and fractures within republicanism. The root cause of conflict in our country is the subversion of the nation's inalienable right to self-determination and this has yet to be addressed. Instead the Irish people have been sold a phoney peace, rubber-stamped by a token legislature in Stormont.
Non-conformist republicans are being subjected to harassment, arrest and violence by the forces of the British crown; others have been interned on the direction of an English overlord. It is Britain, not the IRA, which has chosen provocation and conflict.
The IRA's mandate for armed struggle derives from Britain's denial of the fundamental right of the Irish people to national self-determination and sovereignty -- so long as Britain persists in its denial of national and democratic rights in Ireland the IRA will have to continue to assert those rights.
The necessity of armed struggle in pursuit of Irish freedom can be avoided through the removal of the British military presence in our country, the dismantling of their armed militias and the declaration of an internationally observed timescale that details the dismantling of British political interference in our country.http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/26/ira-northern-ireland-dissident-republican-groups
After the merger, the media began to refer to the group as the "New IRA".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.herald.ie/news/rise-of-the-new-ira-and-what-it-means-for-the-rest-of-us-28906870.html |title=Rise of the New IRA and What it Means for the Rest of Us |publisher=Herald |date=17 November 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/05/new-ira-blamed-killing-dublin-crime-boss |title='New IRA' group blamed for killing of Dublin crime boss |publisher=The Guardian |date=5 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/terror-suspects-part-of-new-ira-group-court-told-16248962.html |title=Terror suspects part of New IRA group, court told |publisher=Belfast Telegraph |date=11 December 2012[/tpl] As well as RAAD, the alliance includes an east Tyrone group thought to be responsible for killing PSNI officer Ronan Kerr in 2011, and a Belfast group who badly wounded PSNI officer Peadar Heffron in 2010. The Continuity IRA, and the group often referred to as ONH, remain independent. The PSNI reckoned that the new group has a membership of "between 250 and 300 military activists, backed up by associates". In November 2012 it claimed responsibility for shooting dead a Prison Officer near Craigavon,http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/violence/deaths2012draft.htm"David Black murder: New 'IRA' group claims it murdered prison officer".

==Structure and status==

The RIRA has a command structure similar to the Provisional IRA, with a seven-member Army Council consisting of a chief of staff, quartermaster general, director of training, director of operations, director of finance, director of publicity, and adjutant general.Mooney & O'Toole, pp. 40–45. The rank-and-file members operate in active service units of covert cells to prevent the organisation from being compromised by informers. As of June 2005, the organisation is believed to have a maximum of about 150 members, according to a statement by the Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell.[tpl]cite web | title = Parliamentary Debates (Official Report – Unrevised) Dáil Éireann Thursday, 23 June 2005 – Page 1 | url = http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20050623.xml&Page=1&Ex=1487#N1487 | publisher = Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas | date = 23 June 2005 | accessdate = 3 May 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]

==Weaponry==

The RIRA initially took small amounts of materiel from Provisional IRA arms dumps under the control of McKevitt and other former Provisional IRA members, including the plastic explosive Semtex, Uzi submachine guns, AK-47 and AK-74 assault rifles, handguns, shotguns, detonators, and timing devices.Boyne, pp. 382–383.Mooney & O'Toole, p. 321. The defection of senior Provisional IRA members also gave the RIRA the ability to manufacture home-made explosives and improvised mortars, including the Mark 15 mortar capable of firing a 200 lb shell.Mooney & O'Toole, p. 183.
In 1999 the organisation supplemented its equipment by importing arms from Croatia, including military explosive TM500, CZ Model 25 submachine guns, modified AK-47 assault rifles with a folding stock, and RPG-18 and RPG-22 rocket launchers.Boyne, pp. 382 & 440, But a July 2000 attempt to smuggle a second consignment of arms was foiled by Croatian police, who seized seven RPG-18s, AK-47 assault rifles, detonators, ammunition, and twenty packs of TM500.
In 2001 RIRA members travelled to Slovakia to procure arms, and were caught in a sting operation by the British security agency MI5. The men attempted to purchase five tonnes of plastic explosives, 2,000 detonators, 500 handguns, 200 rocket-propelled-grenades, and also wire-guided missiles and sniper rifles. Three men from County Louth were arrested and extradited to the UK and subsequently imprisoned for 30 years each after pleading guilty to conspiring to cause explosions and other charges.[tpl]cite web | title = 30 years in jail for Real IRA trio | author = Richard Norton-Taylor | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,2763,711589,00.html | publisher = The Guardian | date = 8 May 2002 | accessdate = 28 June 2007[/tpl]
In June 2006, the PSNI made a number of arrests following an MI5 sting operation targeting a dissident republican gun smuggling plot. The RIRA had attempted to procure arms from France including Semtex and C-4 plastic explosives, SA-7 surface-to-air missiles, AK-47s, rocket launchers, heavy machine guns, sniper rifles, pistols with silencers, anti-tank weapons and detonators.Boyne, p. 390.[tpl]cite web | title = Man in court on 'Real IRA' charge | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/5112572.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 24 June 2006 | accessdate = 28 June 2007[/tpl] On 30 June 2010, two of those arrested were found guilty following a trial by judge in Belfast. On 1 October 2010 one man was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for attempting to import weapons and explosives, while the other was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment for making a Portuguese property available for the purpose of terrorism.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10464897 | title= Two guilty of Real IRA gun plot  | date=30 June 2010 |publisher=BBC News[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-11453874 | title= Pair jailed for Real IRA gun plot  | date=1 October 2010 |publisher=BBC News[/tpl]
