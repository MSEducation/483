Ballardini started his coaching career serving as youth team coach for Bologna, and successively Cesena and AC Milan. He then worked as Parma under-19 youth team coach from 2002 to 2004.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sambenedettoggi.it/2004/09/15/6940/mister-ballardini-%E2%80%9Cbisogna-costruire-bene-ed-avere-il-buon-senso-di-capire-che-viviamo-una-situazione-un-po%E2%80%99-particolare%E2%80%9D/|publisher=SambenedettOggi.it|title=Mister Ballardini: "Bisogna costruire bene ed avere il buon senso di capire che viviamo una situazione un po’ particolare"|language=Italian|accessdate=2 January 2008|date=15 September 2004[/tpl] He was then appointed by Sambenedettese as new head coach for the 2004–2005 season, ended with an impressive fourth place and the consequent participation in the promotion playoffs, then lost to Napoli in the semi-final.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lasamb.it/0405/playoffout.htm|publisher=LaSamb.it|language=Italian|title=Stagione 2004–2005  Serie C1 girone B – Playoff – Playout|accessdate=2 January 2008[/tpl] He was subsequently chosen by Massimo Cellino as new Cagliari boss for their 2005–06 Serie A campaign, being however sacked only a few weeks later, on 11 November, and replaced by Nedo Sonetti.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/index.php?action=read&id=16435|publisher=TuttoMercatoWeb|language=Italian|title=Cagliari: la panchina affidata a Sonetti|accessdate=2 January 2008|date=11 November 2005[/tpl]
Ballardini started the 2006–07 season at the helm of Serie B side Pescara, where he however lasted only until October, following a very unimpressive beginning in the league.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/index.php?action=read&id=40926|language=Italian|title=UFFICIALE: il Pescara esonera Ballardini|accessdate=2 January 2008|date=9 October 2006[/tpl] He was surprisingly announced as new boss of last-placed Serie A team Cagliari on 27 December 2007, succeeding Sonetti, who ironically replaced him during his first period at the helm of the Sardinian side.[tpl]cite news |title=Cagliari appoint new Coach|url=http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/dec27g.html |publisher= Football Italia |date= 27 December 2007 |accessdate=27 December 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071230101548/http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/dec27g.html  |archivedate = 30 December 2007[/tpl] Under his tenure as head coach, Cagliari dramatically improved their results, winning 32 points in 21 weeks,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.football.it/schedaallenatore.php?id_allenatore=9974 |publisher=Football.it |language=Italian |accessdate=28 May 2008 |title=DAVIDE BALLARDINI[/tpl] thus rising up the table and managing to escape relegation in advance of a week. However, Ballardini failed to find an agreement with Cagliari chairman Massimo Cellino for a contract extension, and they ultimately decided to part company on 28 May.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cagliaricalcio.net/news/notizia.asp?idNotizia=5592&type=0&id_menu=1 |language=Italian |publisher=Cagliari Calcio |accessdate=27 May 2008 |date=27 May 2008 |title=Ballardini va via[/tpl]
On 4 September 2008 Palermo announced to have dismissed head coach Stefano Colantuono, appointing Ballardini as new rosanero boss in a one-year contract.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Squadre/Palermo/Primo_Piano/2008/09/04/colantuonovia.shtml |title=Palermo, via Colantuono Ballardini nuovo allenatore |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=4 September 2008 |publisher=Gazzetta.it |language=Italian[/tpl] In his debut match with Palermo, Ballardini led the Sicilians to a very impressive 3–1 home win to AS Roma, and then went on to impose the first seasonal loss to Juventus, winning 2–1 in Turin, this being the first time Palermo won at Juventus' home in 47 years. His ability to recover Palermo, leading them to the top league positions, was quickly praised once again by the media. On 7 October, just two days after the rosanero triumph in Turin, Palermo announced to have agreed a two-year contract extension with Ballardini.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.ilpalermocalcio.it/it/0809/news_scheda.jsp?id=10527 |publisher=US Città di Palermo |language=Italian |title=Ballardini prolunga contratto |date=7 October 2008 |accessdate=7 October 2008[/tpl]
After weeks of rumours regarding a possible departure of Ballardini from Palermo at the end of the season, on 30 May the rosanero head coach announced he had agreed for a 10-day period to give a definite answer to the club regarding his intentions. Later that day, Palermo chairman Maurizio Zamparini announced Ballardini had asked to be relieved from his position due to his unwillingness to keep on serving as Palermo head coach.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2008/12/sport/calcio/serie-a/palermo/ballardini-via/ballardini-via.html |title=Zamparini-Ballardini, divorzio di fatto Il presidente: "E' lui che vuole andar via" |date=30 May 2009 |accessdate=5 June 2009 |publisher=La Repubblica |language=Italian[/tpl] A few days later, on 5 June, Palermo unveiled Walter Zenga as new head coach, thus ending speculation regarding Ballardini's future with the rosanero. Despite being dismissed as head coach following these events, Ballardini was however still under a contract for two more years with the Sicilian club.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Palermo/05-06-2009/zenga-uomo-nuovo-50492606646.shtml |title=Zenga, l'uomo nuovo per un EuroPalermo |language=Italian |accessdate=5 June 2009 |date=5 June 2009 |publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport[/tpl]
Finally, after long rumours connecting Ballardini's name as the next coach of Lazio following Delio Rossi's departure, he was appointed as the new manager of the Roman club on 15 June 2009. He signed a two year contract with an option for a third worth 750,000 euro per year.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.corrieredellosport.it/Notizie/Calcio/71739/Lazio%2C+tutto+pronto+per+la+firma+di+Ballardini |title=Lazio, Ballardini nuovo allenatore |language=italian |date=15 July 2009  |accessdate=15 July 2009 |publisher=Corriere Dello Sport[/tpl]
On his first competitive match as Lazio boss, Ballardini led the club to triumph in the 2009 Supercoppa Italiana, as his side won 2–1 to outgoing Italian champions Inter in a single-legged game played at Beijing National Stadium, Beijing, China. However, Ballardini did not repeat this triumph in Serie A level, and also failed to qualify to the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League knockout round. Later in January and February a number of disappointing results left Lazio in 18th place, in danger of being relegated, leading club chairman Claudio Lotito to dismiss Ballardini and appoint Edy Reja as new head coach.[tpl]cite news |title=Calcio, Lazio: esonerato Ballardini, squadra a Reja |url=http://it.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idITMIE61909D20100210 |publisher=Reuters Italia |date=10 February 2010 |accessdate=10 February 2010 |language=Italian [/tpl]
On 8 November 2010 Ballardini returned into management, accepting an offer as head coach of Serie A club Genoa.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Genoa/08-11-2010/preziosi-esonera-gasperini-711744783778.shtml |publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport |language=Italian |accessdate=8 November 2010 |date=8 November 2010 |title=Preziosi esonera Gasperini Al Genoa arriva Ballardini[/tpl] He signed a two-year contract with the club, but club president Enrico Preziosi terminated the contract with him for no particular reason on 5 June 2011.
On 9 November 2011, Ballardini returned to manage Cagliari for the third time in his career. He was dismissed for just cause on March 11, 2012.
On 21 January 2013, Ballardini returned to Genoa to try and save them from relegation. He has managed to do so with still one game to go. Nevertheless chairman Preziosi may decide yet again to let him go at the end of the season. Ballardini is loved by many Genoa supporters for his manners and his energy on the pitch. Many want him to lead Genoa next season too.
On 8 January 2014, Serie A club Bologna announced that Ballardini agreed a 6-month deal to coach their first team.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.legaseriea.it/it/sala-stampa/archivio-dettaglio/-/news/BOLOGNA__DAVIDE_BALLARDINI_HEAD_COACH_OF_THE_FIRST_TEAM/1017124 |title=Bologna, Davide Ballardini Head Coach of The First Team|publisher=Lega Serie A|accessdate=8 January 2014 |date=8 January 2014[/tpl]
