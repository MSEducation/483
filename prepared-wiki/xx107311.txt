==History==

Eli Hollinshead purchased a [tpl]convert|200|acre|km2|sing=on[/tpl] parcel on December 18, 1850.  On January 6, 1854 it was sold to John Peterman, who later divided it into 4 parcels, the largest being [tpl]convert|120|acre|km2[/tpl].  Peterman sold the largest parcel, on which The Kingbridge Centre was built, to William McNair on March 6th, 1861 for $6,000.
In 1929 the farm was sold to the Toronto Company of the Girl Guides of Canada. After a series of repairs to the existing buildings, the camp was relocated to Hawkestone, Ontario.
The main facilities were originally built in 1989 by Murray Koffler, the founder of Shoppers Drug Mart and co-founder of Four Seasons Hotels. The site was first named King Ranch Health Spa and Fitness Resort, and was designed as a luxury spa facility. It opened in 1989 and operated until 1992, when it fell into receivership and was repossessed by its financier, The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC).  Without viable economic prospects, CIBC adapted the facility to become its "Leadership Centre".
In 1996, the secretive Bilderberg Group held its annual meeting here.
In 2001, the site was sold to John Abele, co-founder of Boston Scientific, who transformed it into its current use as a meeting and presentation venue.
