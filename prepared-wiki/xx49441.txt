At the 1904 Summer Olympics, a  football event was contested. Only three club teams competed. Medals were awarded at the time, at least to the Canadian team.  The 1904 contest is considered to be an official contest by the IOC but not by FIFA.
The 1904 Games were spread over several months, linked to the St Louis World's Fair, and football was the last sport to be contested, in November. The tournament was played as a straight round robin, although the game between Christian Brothers College and St. Rose Parish was replayed twice due to two 0-0 draws.

According to a report in the Toronto Mail and Empire newspaper of November 18, 1904, medals were awarded to the players in St. Louis.
The report states that "Immediately after the game, the Galt aggregation, numbering about 50 persons, retired to the office of James E. Sullivan, chief of the Department of Physical Culture, where they received their prize.  After a short talk by Mr. James A. Conlon, of the Physical Culture Department, Mayor Mundy, of the City of Galt, presented each player on the winning team with a beautiful gold medal."
The medal awarded to Fred Steep of Galt, held by The Soccer Hall of Fame and Museum in Vaughan, Ontario, clearly shows that the medals were made in St. Louis, Missouri.
