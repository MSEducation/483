===Marvel Comics===

When Thunderwing abducts the Micromaster Battle Patrol to learn the secrets of making Micromasters for the Decepticons Emirate Xaaron sends Road Handler commanding the Race Car Patrol, the Rescue Patrol and the Off Road Patrol to destroy the Decepticon's lab. Unable to destroy his fellow Autobots Road Handler instead saves the Battle Patrol, but not before the Decepticon successfully create the Air Strike Patrol. (Transformers Marvel U.K. #232-233, "A Small War!")
The Air Strike Team made their first appearance in issue #56 of the U.S. comic. Working for Megatron (thought to be dead at this point) they made contact with Scorponok's group of Decepticons, placing themselves under his command. They then attacked an airbase, demanding a refueling plane and the fuel to go with it."Transformers" #56 (September 1989)
When Optimus Prime's Autobots showed up in response in issue #57, Scorponok intervened to protect his "troops". Their work complete, the Air Strike Patrol then left - leaving both Autobots and Decepticons exposed to Megatron's instrument of vengeance - the resurrected and reprogrammed Pretender Starscream.
They did not appear again in the U.S. storyline, but did get a one-off appearance in the U.K. version of the comic. In a possible future, told in flashback by Rodimus Prime, Scorponok lost a leadership contest with Megatron and Shockwave. Fleeing, Megatron sent the Air Strike Patrol to pursue him, but they wound up in battle with Hot Rod, who Scorponok had surrendered to, forcing the Autobot and his comrades to protect him. While the Air Strike Patrol attacked the Autobots, Scorponok escaped (Marvel U.K. #223).
