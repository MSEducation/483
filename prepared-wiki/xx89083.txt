Each House of the Parliament of India has a Leader of the Opposition. While the position also existed in the former Central Legislative Assembly of British India, and holders of it there included Motilal Nehru, it got statutory recognition through the Salary and Allowances of Leaders of Opposition in Parliament Act, 1977 which defines the term â€˜Leader of the Opposition' as that member of the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha who, for the time being, is the Leader of that House of the Party in Opposition to the Government having the greatest numerical strength and recognized, as such, by the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha or the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.[tpl]cite web|title=Salary and Allowances of Leaders of Opposition in Parliament Act, 1977|url=http://mpa.nic.in/actopp.htm|publisher=Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs, Government of India|accessdate=1 October 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100116211914/http://mpa.nic.in/actopp.htm|archivedate=16 January 2010[/tpl]http://legislativebodiesinindia.nic.in/PARLIAMENT%20OF%20INDIA.htm

==Leaders of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha==

==List of Leaders of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha==

In Rajya Sabha until 1969, there was no Leader of the Opposition in real sense of the term. Till then, the practice was to call the Leader of the party in Opposition having the largest number of the members as the Leader of the Opposition, without according him any formal recognition, status or privilege. The office of Leader of the Opposition was given official recognition through the Salary and Allowances of Leaders of the Opposition in Parliament Act, 1977. This Act defines the Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha, as a member of the Council of States who is, for the time being, the Leader in that House of the party in opposition to the Government constituting the greatest numerical strength and recognized as such by the Chairman of the Council of States. Thus, the Leader of the Opposition should satisfy three conditions, namely, (i) he should be a member of the House (ii) the Leader in Rajya Sabha of the party in opposition to the Government having the greatest numerical strength and (iii) be recognized as such by the Chairman, Rajya Sabha.
