Lincoln University began life in 1878 as a School of Agriculture.

From 1961 to 1990, it was known as Lincoln College, a constituent college of the University of Canterbury, until achieving autonomy in 1990 as Lincoln University.[tpl]cite web|url = http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/About-Lincoln-University/Lincoln-University-profile/|title = Lincoln University profile|accessdate = 2007-07-04|publisher = Lincoln University[/tpl] It is the oldest agricultural teaching institution in the Southern Hemisphere.
