Finchley Road railway station was built by the Midland Railway in 1868 on its extension to St. Pancras. Situated at the north end of the Belsize Tunnels, it served the newly developed area of St John's Wood.
For a short period from 1878 and 1880, the MR operated the Super Outer Circle service through the station from St. Pancras to Earl's Court Underground station via tracks through Cricklewood, then using the Dudding Hill Line to South Acton and Hammersmith.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/circle.html#history |title=Circle Line, History |work=Clive's Underground Line Guides |accessdate=2008-02-13 [/tpl]
The station was rebuilt in 1884 and closed in 1927.Radford, B., (1983) Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby London: Bloomsbury Books Very little of the station buildings other than rubble remain, though the island platform's contours still determine the track layout. As of February 2009, the station area is being offered for sale with a view to redevelopment.
The present day Finchley Road & Frognal railway station is on the old LNWR line from Willesden to Camden Town which crosses the Midland line a little way north.
