The Finnish government recognized Egypt on April 8, 1922 and diplomatic relations were established. However, no diplomatic mission was established at this point. In January 1942, as the Finnish government was taking part in the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the Egyptian government broke diplomatic relations with Helsinki.
Diplomatic relations were reestablished on February 15, 1947 at a Legation level, but no diplomatic mission was actually established. It was only in 1954 that the Finnish Ambassador to Italy was appointed non-resident Minister Plenipotentiary to Egypt. It was only on July 1, 1959 that relations were elevated to Embassy level, and the Finnish Embassy was opened in September.
