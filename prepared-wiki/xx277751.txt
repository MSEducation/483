The Albany, New York mayoral election of 2013 took place on November 5, 2013. The general election was preceded by the primaries on September 10, 2013.

==Background==

Albany will see its first open seat election since 1993. This is the result of incumbent Mayor Gerald Jennings's decision not to run for a sixth term, which he announced on May 14, 2013.[tpl]cite web|last=Layton|first=Jessica|title=Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings will not seek re-election|url=http://wnyt.com/article/stories/s3033360.shtml|work=WNYT|accessdate=8 August 2013[/tpl] He will leave office after 20 years as the second-longest serving mayor in the history of Albany, following only Erastus Corning 2nd. Following the election, Albany will have just its fourth elected mayor since 1941. As there has not been a Republican to win a city-wide race since 1931, it is likely that the winner of the Democratic primary will go on to win the general election.

Ellis gained ballot access, but Anderson was thrown off the ballot due to insufficient signatures.
