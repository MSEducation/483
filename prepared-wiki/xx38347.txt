==Death==

In the early morning hours of 31 August 1997, Diana and Fayed died in a car crash in the Pont de l'Alma underpass in Paris. They had stopped in Paris en route to London, after having spent nine days together on holiday in the French and Italian Riviera aboard his family yacht, the Jonikal. Neither Fayed nor Diana was wearing a seatbelt.
