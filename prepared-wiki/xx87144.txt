Sanz quipped, “I’ve been trying to come up with a joke about how I’ve lost weight and I was going to say, 'I stopped putting nuts in my sundaes.'"

==Saturday Night Live==

Sanz joined the cast of Saturday Night Live in September 1998. At the beginning of Saturday Night Live's 31st season, he was the temporary replacement for Tina Fey as Amy Poehler's Weekend Update co-anchor while Fey was on maternity leave until she resumed her duties on October 22, 2005. On September 20, 2006, Saturday Night Live announced that Sanz would not be returning due to massive budget cuts that called for Lorne Michaels to either cut back on show production or get rid of long-standing or poor-performing cast members.
Sanz was the fourth cast member in SNL history to be born outside of North America after Tony Rosato, Pamela Stephenson and Morwenna Banks.
Sanz returned to SNL as a guest on February 3, 2007, appearing as Elton John, and again on November 3, as presidential candidate Bill Richardson and yet again on the December 17, 2011 Christmas show as himself in a musical number ("I Wish It Was Christmas Today").
