[[Isobutane]]

CATEGORIES: Alkanes, Refrigerants, Propellants

Isobutane (''i''-butane), also known as methylpropane, is a chemical compound with molecular formula [tpl]Chem|C|4|H|10[/tpl] and is an isomer of butane. It is the simplest alkane with a tertiary carbon. Concerns with depletion of the ozone layer by freon gases have led to increased use of isobutane as a gas for refrigeration systems, especially in domestic refrigerators and freezers, and as a propellant in aerosol sprays. When used as a refrigerant or a propellant, isobutane is also known as R-600a. Some portable camp stoves use a mixture of isobutane with propane, usually 80:20.MSR Isopro Isobutane is used as a feedstock in the petrochemical industry, for example in the synthesis of isooctane.Patent Watch, July 31, 2006.

==Nomenclature==

Isobutane is the trivial name retained by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in its 1993 Recommendations for the Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry.[tpl]cite book | author=Panico, R.; & Powell, W. H. (Eds.) | title=A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds 1993 | location=Oxford | publisher=Blackwell Science | year=1994 | isbn=0-632-03488-2[/tpl] http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_679.htm  Since the longest continuous chain in isobutane contains only three carbon atoms, the full systematic name is 2-methylpropane but the locant (2-) is typically omitted as redundant; C2 is the only position on a propane chain where a methyl substituent can be located without altering the main chain.

==Uses==

Isobutane is used as a refrigerant.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ozone/pdf/hcfc_technical_meeting_summary.pdf |title=European Commission on retrofit refrigerants for stationary applications |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-10-29[/tpl]  The use in refrigerators started in 1993 when Greenpeace presented the Greenfreeze project with the German company Foron.[tpl]cite web|author=Page - March 15, 2010 |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/campaigns/global-warming-and-energy/green-solutions/greenfreeze/ |title=GreenFreeze |publisher=Greenpeace |date=2010-03-15 |accessdate=2013-01-02[/tpl] In this regard, blends of pure, dry "isobutane" (R-600a) (that is, isobutane mixtures) have negligible ozone depletion potential and very low Global Warming Potential (having a value of 3.3 times the GWP of carbon dioxide) and can serve as a functional replacement for R-12, R-22, R-134a, and other chlorofluorocarbon or hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants in conventional stationary refrigeration and air conditioning systems.
In the Chevron Phillips slurry process for making high-density polyethylene, isobutane is used as a diluent. As the slurried polyethylene is removed, isobutane is "flashed" off, and condensed, and recycled back into the loop reactor for this purpose.[tpl]Ullmann | title = Polyethylene | author = Kenneth S. Whiteley | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a21_487.pub2[/tpl]
Isobutane is also used as a propellant for aerosol cans and foam products.

==Refrigerant use==

As a refrigerant, isobutane has an explosion risk in addition to the hazards associated with non-flammable CFC refrigerants. Reports surfaced in late 2009 suggesting the use of isobutane as a refrigerant in domestic refrigerators was potentially dangerous. Several refrigerator explosions reported in the United Kingdom are suspected to have been caused as a result of isobutane leaking into the refrigerator cabinet and being ignited by sparks in the electrical system.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/howaboutthat/6120297/Exploding-fridges-ozone-friendly-gas-theory-for-mystery-blasts.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Exploding fridges: ozone friendly gas theory for mystery blasts | first=John | last=Bingham | date=September 1, 2009 | accessdate=May 5, 2010[/tpl] Although unclear how serious this could be, at the time this report came out it was estimated 300 million refrigerators worldwide use isobutane as a refrigerant.
Substitution of this refrigerant for motor vehicle air conditioning systems not originally designed for Isobutane is widely prohibited or discouraged, on the grounds that using flammable hydrocarbons in systems originally designed to carry non-flammable refrigerant presents a significant risk of fire or explosion.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/snap/refrigerants/hc12alng.html |title=U.S. EPA hydrocarbon-refrigerants FAQ |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-10-29[/tpl]Compendium of hydrocarbon-refrigerant policy statements, October 2006[tpl]dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.autoacforum.com/MACS/HCwarning.pdf |title=MACS bulletin: hydrocarbon refrigerant usage in vehicles |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-10-29[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.sae.org/news/releases/05hydrocarbon_warning.htm |title=Society of Automotive Engineers hydrocarbon refrigerant bulletin |publisher=Sae.org |date=2005-04-27 |accessdate=2010-10-29[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.labour.gov.sk.ca/Default.aspx?DN=2fb5ac24-d90e-4408-bf40-559793bd8e96 |title=Saskatchewan Labour bulletin on hydrocarbon refrigerants in vehicles |publisher=Labour.gov.sk.ca |date=2010-06-29 |accessdate=2010-10-29[/tpl]VASA on refrigerant legality & advisability[tpl]dead link|date=October 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.energy.qld.gov.au/zone_files/petroleum_pdf/safety_alert025.pdf |title=Queensland (Australia) government warning on hydrocarbon refrigerants |publisher=Energy.qld.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2010-10-29[/tpl]
Vendors and advocates of hydrocarbon refrigerants argue against such bans on the grounds that there have been very few such incidents relative to the number of vehicle air conditioning systems filled with hydrocarbons.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/HansArt.nsf/V3Key/LA19971016015 |title=New South Wales (Australia) Parliamentary record, 16 October 1997 |publisher=Parliament.nsw.gov.au |date=1997-10-16 |accessdate=2010-10-29[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20000629051 |title=New South Wales (Australia) Parliamentary record, 29 June 2000 |publisher=Parliament.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2010-10-29[/tpl]
