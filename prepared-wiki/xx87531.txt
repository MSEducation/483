Glenhuntly station is located next to a "tram square", one of only four crossings in Melbourne at which tram and train tracks intersect along with their electrified overhead wires. A small signal box is situated at the Flinders Street end of the tram square which controls the tramway crossing. 
In the 1980s as part of works to add a third track on the Frankston line, the western platform was converted to an island platform and a new building opened on 1 July 1987. In the morning peak hour, Frankston bound services utilise Platform 3 with Flinders Street bound trains utilising Platforms 1 and 2. At other times Frankston bound trains call at Platform 2.
