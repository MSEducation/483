Adidas Predator is a range of football boots developed by German sportswear manufacturers Adidas based on a prototype concept from the Australian former footballer Craig Johnston.http://sneakerreport.com/features/the-complete-history-of-the-adidas-predator/http://www.thehardtackle.com/2013/craig-johnston-inventor-who-became-footballer/ The common feature of the Predator range is the presence of rubber patches or strips on the top of the shoe, designed to increase friction between the boot and the ball. In late 2010, Adidas designed the new "Power-spine" technology, which they claim improves shot power by reducing the amount the foot bends back as it kicks the ball.
In 2014 Hungarian inventor László Oroszi won a court case against Adidas in relation to the predator precision range.http://www.lawdit.co.uk/reading-room/adidas-liable-for-patent-infringement-in-hungary[tpl]cite web|title=Az Adidas lenyúlta Oroszi László találmányát|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20140211-pert-nyert-egy-magyar-feltalalo-az-adidas-szal-szemben.html|publisher=Origo|accessdate=02-11-2014[/tpl] forcing Adidas to pay royalties on that range of the boot.

==History of the Predator models==

There have been 12 different predator models, with a cheaper version without all the predator technology going by a different name. For example the Predator Pulse's budget variant was called the Pulsado, now on its twelfth version, Predator LZ (lethal zones):
The eponymous Predator elements have developed over time. The principle behind the project, however, involves attaching rubber strips to the forefoot that Adidas says increases the speed of the ball. The initial focus in Predator commercials was on shooting strength, but this gradually move more to the effect on ball spin and precision. The first Predators were also available without Predator elements under a different name. While the Predators were made of black kangaroo-leather with white stripes and red elements, the equivalent boots without Predator technology were black with white stripes and blue accents. The Precision equivalent, however, was black and white only, while the Supernova (Predator Mania without the Predator elements) was black with either silver or gold heel caps and stripes. David Beckham wore these boots for the whole of his career, as did Zinédine Zidane.

===Original Predator===

The original Adidas Predator was made of leather. It featured rubber ridges. It only came in a few color, black with white stripes and red accents. This color scheme is now known as the main one for all predators.

===Rapier===

The Predator Rapiers (named this as most footballers could kick with them on)also were the first Adidas soccer boots available in different colors. Until then, Adidas soccer boots were made of black leather. The Rapier, however, was also (as a limited series) available in white and red, as were the next two models. Beginning with the Mania, Adidas started to produce its Predator boots in countless color variants. Moreover, one color was called David Beckham's style.

===Touch===

The Predator Touch was different in many ways. It featured the Traxion (trx) studs, which were rectangular and anatomically placed. Before, studs had always been round. For professional players who preferred the old studs, Adidas produced special Predators with a different outsole.

===Accelerator===

The Predator Accelerator version was released in 1998 to coincide with the FIFA world cup held in France. This boot featured a re-engineered TRX (traxion) outsole, asymmetrical lacing, fore-footed rubber vamps sewn into the leather, and a "feet you wear" insole. It has been regarded as one of the best boots Adidas have produced to date. The boot was modelled by some of the greatest players such as Del Piero, Zidane and David Beckham.
The Adidas Predator Accelerator came out in four different colourways:
Two generations of this boot were produced: The '98 version can be distinguished by two red patches on the heel, whereas the '99 version does not have these red patches on the heel.
Furthermore, the same model was released in the colours of black/blue but without the "Predator" elements. This was a slightly cheaper alternative to the Predator Accelerator.  This version was simply called the Adidas Accelerator.

===Precision===

The Predator Precision introduced replaceable Traxion studs that were fitted by the tightening of a minute screw. These studs were available in various lengths that made the boot adjustable to ground conditions as is possible with the classic screw-in soft-ground studs. There were, however, some reliability problems, as the studs would come loose quite often, thus needing more constant maintenance than the classic screw-ins. In 2001 came a completely revised model which had a similar stripe configuration and colourway but the predator technology was revised and bore more of a resemblance to Predator Accelerators

===Mania===

Adidas released the Predator Mania to coincide with the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan. They designed it with Far Eastern style in mind, so it had sharp angular styling and came in various colour schemes in addition to the traditional black–red design. These included the "champagne," which was a champagne-white colour, a "champagne gold," which was a gold pearl-like white, however, just stud back ground and heel cup was gold. These were worn by David Beckham, Alessandro Del Piero, and Raúl. These were available in the XTRX Blades for soft ground use, which came with a stud key and could be loosened or tightened at the owners comfort and also the red firm ground blades for hard surfaces. These were not detachable and came fixated to the boot. A limited edition version was also released in 'Japan Blue' and was worn by Alex of the Japan during the tournament. During the 2002/03 season, they also released an all red version with the adidas stripes in silver.
Problems with reliability of the XTRX Blades meant a revised version was released in late 2003, which incorporated minor changes to the layout and design of the studs. In addition to this, with the revision, Adidas also released the boots with traditional screw in studs which were previously only available to professional players who had the boots custom designed by Adidas. Two new colours were released "lunar" came out during March 2003 and "gun metal." which was released in time for the 2003/04 football season, The final revision of this boot came with the release of the HG (Hard Ground) sole, which was the same as the FG, except that the studs were black instead of red and were joined up and more robust with the boots intended to be used on third generation and synthetic surfaces. Blue Mania were only released in small numbers, primarily in the North American market, Japan, and Korea and are rare in Europe.
With the success of the Mania in 2002, Adidas launched a budget version of the boot called the Manado. This featured all the key characteristics of the Mania boot but with small cosmetic differences. A cheaper young cow leather was used in comparison to the Mania's kangaroo skin leather. There was also a difference in the size and length of the tongues on each boot, compared to the Mania and the achillies protector on the heel was not plastic. Differences in the studs and colouring of the under sole are also evident, although the differences can be hard to notice at a glance, the Manados are often mistaken for Manias even though the recommended retail price of the Manados was £60, opposed to the £120 of the Manias.
With the difference in leather and other features, the Predator Mania FG is intended as the peak of the Predator range. With the line discontinued in late 2003, the boot has long been out of stock. Second-hand prices, however, for the boots still dwarf the original £120 recommended retail price.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]

===Pulse===

The Predator Pulse was introduced in late 2003, before the UEFA Euro 2004 tournament. The first colour released was black and red (original). This Predator is the first boot include what Adidas calls the Power Pulse System, and only Predator Pulse can't change to the original insole.
Adidas introduced PowerPulse in the Predator Pulse in late 2003, and continued with the Predator Absolute in November 2005. Adidas claims the PowerPulse sockliner shifts the boot’s centre of gravity closer to the point of impact, which they say offers more powerful shots on goal. Most of absolute's PowerPulse is 40g, however only Red version is 60g.

===Absolute===

The "Predator Absolute" introduced in mid-2006 (Before Germany World Cup). The first colour schemes were black/red, white/gold, and blue/white. This Predator is the first with changeable PowerPulse sockliners, which allows the exchange of the sockliner between the normal 40g and a lighter weight one, with no intentional weight added. Adidas made gold/white Absolute for "Zinedine Zidane" to celebrate his last international conference.

===PowerSwerve===

With the Predator PowerSwerve in late 2007, Adidas introduced a foam material they call Smartfoam. They claim it gives the Predator element more rebound power, swerve, and improved control through longer ball contact.
Football legend Zinédine Zidane helped to develop the new Predator PowerSwerve boot. After ending his active career, he worked together with the Adidas innovation team (a.i.t) in the further evolution of the new boot.
Scientific tests have shown[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] that, in comparison to its predecessor, the Predator PowerSwerve can achieve up to eight percent more swerve and increase the power behind every shot by around three percent. The Dynamic PowerPulse technology in the sole of the boot and the special hi-tech foam in the forefoot upper material make these improvements possible.[tpl]cite web|title=Adidas Predator Powerswerve|url=http://www.soccerbible.com/news/football-boots/archive/2008/07/22/football-boots-adidas-predator-powerswerve-22-07-08.aspx|publisher=soccerbible.com|accessdate=21 October 2011[/tpl] The PowerPulse element filled with tungsten powder, which shifts weight toward the point of impact, enables players to put more power behind every shot.[tpl]cite web|title=Adidas Predator PowerSwerve 2008|url=http://www.soccerbible.com/news/football-boots/archive/2009/10/23/power-football-boots-adidas-predator-powerswerve-range-14-07-09.aspx|publisher=soccerbible.com|accessdate=21 October 2011[/tpl]
Powerswerve Special is a rugby version of the series. It has a wider last in the boot and rugby hybrid studs.

===Predator X===

The Adidas "Predator X" shoes introduced in late 2009 have the Powerspine technology, the Predator element and a host of advancements from Adidas, all intended for better performance. Adidas developed a new upper material they call Taurus leather. The Adidas Predator X football boots are the first Predator to remove the tongue, which Adidas says improves performance. They claim it reduces the material between the ball and boot to give better ball feel, and that the new boot collar gives a more secure fit.
Predator RX is a rugby version of the special, with a wider last and rugby specific predator vamp.
Footballers such as David Beckham, Xavi, Robin van Persie, Michael Ballack, Raúl González, Steven Gerrard, Mohamed Arif, Dirk Kuyt, Kolo Touré, Edwin Van Der Sar, Petr Čech, Brad Friedel, Anderson, Eiður Guðjohnsen, have worn Adidas Predators. Zinedine Zidane tested and reviewed the newest version of the Predator range(Predator X).
adidas released the Predator X in the traditional black/white/red colourway, with a contrasting white/brown/yellow colourway[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.soccercleats101.com/2009/10/26/adidas-predator-x-released-our-review/ |title=Adidas Predator X White Review |accessdate=2011-05-14 |date=2009-10-26 |publisher=SoccerCleats101 [/tpl] to accompany it. Later, Adidas released other colourways including the usual David Beckham designed white/red colourway, with a dragon design on the rubber Predator element; also released were the blue/white/red. For the World Cup, Adidas released a black/sun colourway to follow on a colourway they used for all three of their boot styles (F50 adiZero and adiPure), later came the white/sky/cyan and back/white/cyan colourways, followed by another David Beckham designed Collegiate Red/White colourway.
For the winter of the 2010/11 season, Adidas released the Predator X in two new colourways, electricity/black/poppy and black/Running-White/electricity, David Beckham will also be getting another personalised colourway in white/blue. Steven Gerrard has been given the option of a Miadidas Predator which he personalised as black/gold/red.

===AdiPower Predator===

Released in May 2011, the Adidas adiPower Predator saw a shift in focus for the Predator range with the release of the new adiPower. The Powerspine technology has been retained, providing greater shooting power by minimizing energy loss. The Predator element on the instep of the boot has been split into two performance zones. The power zone incorporates 3D fins for power, while the silicon rubber Predator element provides swerve and ball control. The adiPower Predator now features the Sprint Frame outsole, originally created for the F50, making it 25% lighter than the Predator X. Real Madrid's Brazilian attacking midfielder Ricardo Kaka and Manchester United's Portuguese winger Luis Nani wore the adiPower Predator and both have had good success wearing the boots.
The adiPower - like other Adidas football boots released in 2011, faced an increase in price, with RRP set as £155 in the UK[tpl]cite web|title=Adidas Predator adiPower|url=http://www.footy-boots.com/adipower/|publisher=Footy-Boots.com|accessdate=13 May 2011[/tpl] and $200 in the United States. They weigh in at 7.8 ounces.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.soccercleats101.com/2011/05/14/adidas-adipower-predator-first-look/ |title=Adidas adiPower Predator - First Look! |accessdate=2011-05-14 |date=2011-05-14 |publisher=SoccerCleats101 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110605194625/http://www.soccercleats101.com/2011/05/14/adidas-adipower-predator-first-look/| archivedate= 5 June 2011 | deadurl= no[/tpl]

====Adipower Predator SL====

The adidas Adipower Predator SL was released on June 24, 2011 as is the lightest Predator yet in a Black/Blue colorway at a retail price of $250 USD. This incarnation of the Predator used the revolutionary SprintSkin upper used in the popular F50 Adizero line and weighed just 211 grams.

===Predator Lethal Zones===

Released in May 2012 release but was already tested by professionals in blackout versions,[tpl]cite web|title=Nani in new adidas Predator D5 boots|url=http://www.footballboots.co.uk/3926-nani-in-new-adidas-predator-d5-boots.html|publisher=FootballBoots.co.uk|accessdate=2 December 2011[/tpl] the next Predators will be called the LZ due to the five lethal zones on the boots.[tpl]cite web|title=New 2012 Predator LZ|url=http://www.footballboots.co.uk/4235-new-2012-predator-lz.html|publisher=FootballBoots.co.uk|accessdate=2 December 2011[/tpl] Previously referred to as the D5 due to the same five zones being called deadly, adidas changed the name in the build up to their release. In a change for the Predators they will have a synthetic leather upper and these will be the first Predator boots with miCoach capability.[tpl]cite web|title=Adidas Predator LZ Review|url=http://www.soccercleats101.com/2012/05/14/adidas-predator-lz-review/|publisher=SoccerCleats101.com|accessdate=14 May 2012[/tpl] The Predator LZ features that same SprintFrame and stud configuration that is found in several other ranges such as the adipure and F50 adiZero. The first zone is called "first touch". It is on the front of the boot. It supposedly gives the wearer a good first touch. The second zone is called "dribble". It is on the side of the boot and supposedly gives a better touch. The third is called "drive". This is the classic predator zone in the striking part of the foot, used for long passes down the field and more powerful shots. The fourth is called "pass". It is made up of extra foam with a bit of tacky material in the passing zone. The last one is called "sweet spot". It is on the side of the big toe and is helpful for giving spin and chipping.
In November 2012, Adidas unveiled a new lightweight version of the Predator LZ, aptly named the Predator LZ SL.[tpl]cite web|title=Adidas Predator LZ SL Review|url=http://www.soccercleats101.com/2013/03/11/adidas-predator-lz-sl-review/|publisher=SoccerCleats101.com|accessdate=14 May 2012[/tpl] The boot still features Lethal Zones, miCoach technology, and the same soleplate. It is in the upper material where they are differentiated. Rather than using the Hybrid S-L seen in the regular LZ, Adidas employ a thinner SprintSkin on the back end of the LZ SL. This boot weighed in at 7.3oz.
In May 2013, adidas officially released the updated version of the Predator LZ named the Predator LZ II and is was debuted by several players in Europe including Napoli's Pepe Reina,Chelsea's Fernando Torres, Oscar, Petr Cech, Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey, Mesut Ozil and Per Mertesacker, Real Madrid's Angel Di Maria and Xabi Alonso and Manchester United's Juan Mata.http://www.footballboots.co.uk/11829-ray-green-adidas-predator-lz-ii-debuted.html First released in a Ray Green colourway the next-generation Predator boasts new raised rubber lethal zones which add increased friction between your foot and the ball for ultimate control, touch, passing and shooting. Other features include the HybridTouch upper which is designed for optimal performance in all weather conditions and Traxion 2.0 stud configuration and SprintFrame soleplate.http://www.footballboots.co.uk/11772-ray-green-adidas-predator-lz-ii-football-boots.html
