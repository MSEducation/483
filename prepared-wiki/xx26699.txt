</ref> considers NLP to be ostensibly based on [[social constructivism]]—and indeed several NLP proponents claim that it is so<ref name="Wake 2008"/><ref name="Mathison and Tosey 2008"/>—and proceeds to evaluate [[Modeling (NLP)|NLP modeling]] in those terms. According to Craft, constructivist theories of learning conceive of an expert instructor and a novice in [[Cognitive apprenticeship|apprenticeship]] that gradually grows in "confidence, understanding and competence" via a process of dialogue that results in a [[Constructivism (learning theory)#Dynamic interaction between task, instructor and learner|negotiated]] shared experience and meaning. The notion of knowledge being created discursively is central to social constructivism yet absent in NLP modeling. Craft argues that NLP modeling contains no appreciation of the expert instructor (i.e. the person who is skilled in the activity of ''teaching itself'') nor of the [[Constructivism (learning theory)|peculiarities]] of constructivist teaching and learning. For these reasons Craft is not convinced by the claims of NLP proponents; Craft doubts that "merely copying, without [[Constructivism (learning theory)#Dynamic interaction between task, instructor and learner|negotiation]], can really lead to expert performance". Craft contends that the theory of [[situated cognition]] contradicts the assumptions of NLP modeling in that NLP modeling is in effect concerned with mimicry of expertise that is divorced from its actual ("real life") [[Constructivism (learning theory)#The importance of context|context of performance]]. Observation of "'surface features' of another person's behaviour...[and even] deeper aspects of another person's performance, which may include beliefs, physiology, strategies, [[Methods of neuro-linguistic programming#Representational systems|sub-modalities]], etc" is insufficient to [[Enculturation|enculturate]] a novice into a specific domain of knowledge, argues Craft. Craft contends that NLP is dogmatic in its promotion of modeling as the most effective method of skill acquisition when there may be such things as [[learning styles]]. Lastly—and in common with Rowan (2008) but for different reasons<ref name="Rowan 2008"/> (see [[Neuro-linguistic programming#Empirical validity|Empirical validity]])—Craft argues that NLP is inconsistent with social constructivism. According to social constructivism ''reality'' is [[Constructivist epistemology#Social constructivism in sociology|socially constructed]]. One of the main NLP maxims—''presuppositions'' in NLP jargon—is [[Map–territory relation|Korzybski's]] pronouncement that "The map is not the territory". To paraphrase Craft, according to social constructivism there is no "territory" as such, no reality "out there", so the map-territory distinction is meaningless within a [[Social constructivism|social constructivist]] [[epistemology]].
Devilly argues that the so-called power therapies—such as NLP—gain popularity because they are promoted, like other pseudoscience, using a set of social influence tactics. These include making extraordinary claims (e.g., a one-session cure for any trauma-related memory), creating  a rationalization trap by obtaining incremental commitments from students learning the power therapy (e.g., first lesson is free and subsequent courses increase in price), manufacturing source credibility and sincerity by creating a guru-like leader that is most qualified in the power therapy, creating a self-regulated body composed of those that have completed a course in the power therapy, and defining an enemy to facilitate in-group/out-group thinking and behavior and to serve as a scapegoat.
NLP has been criticized alongside theories and practices characterized as questionable, pseudoscience and/or discredited practices in therapy. Sources within therapy and psychology include books such as Crazy Therapies (1997), Science and Pseudo-science in Clinical Psychology (2002), and Tall Tales about the Mind and Brain (2007). Articles critical of NLP also appear in the Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience (2000) and The Skeptic's Dictionary (2003). NLP has also been used as a key example of pseudoscience to facilitate the understanding of the importance of rational and critical thinking in a number of academic subjects.
According to Witkowski (2010), NLP also appears on "the list of discredited therapies" published in the Journal of Professional Psychology: Research and Practice. With reference to work by Carroll (2003), Della Sala (1999), Lilienfeld et al. (2003) and Singer and Lalich (1996) on "pseudoscientific, unvalidated, or "quack" psychotherapies" within clinical psychology, Norcross et al. (2006) included NLP for treatment of mental/behavior disorders in a survey of the opinions of psychologists who rated NLP between possibly discredited and probably discredited, a rating similar to dolphin assisted therapy, equine therapy, psychosynthesis, scared straight programmes, and emotional freedom technique (EFT). Norcross et al. (2010) listed "neurolinguistic programming for drug and alcohol dependence" seventh out of their list of the ten most discredited drugs and alcohol interventions, and it is listed as "certainly discredited" for addiction treatment in Evidence-based practices in addiction treatment: review and recommendations for public policy.

==NLP as quasi-religion==

Langford categorizes NLP as a form of folk magic; that is to say, a practice with symbolic efficacy—as opposed to physical efficacy—that is able to effect change through nonspecific effects (e.g., placebo). To Langford, NLP is akin to a syncretic folk religion "that attempts to wed the magic of folk practice to the science of professional medicine".[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Langford | first1 = Jean M. | title = Medical Mimesis: Healing Signs of a Cosmopolitan "Quack" | journal = American Ethnologist | publisher = Wiley | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 24–46 |date=February 1999 | jstor=647497 | doi=10.1525/ae.1999.26.1.24[/tpl]  Bandler and Grinder were (and continue to be[tpl]cite book| last1 = Grinder| first1 = John| last2 = DeLozier| first2 = Judith| title = Turtles All The Way Down: Prerequisites To Personal Genius| edition = 1st| year = 1987| publisher = Grinder & Associates| location = California| isbn = 1555520227|url = http://books.google.com.au/books/about/Turtles_all_the_way_down.html?id=LQ8RAQAAIAAJ[/tpl][tpl]cite book | last=Grinder | first=John | last2=Bostic St. Clair| title=Whispering In The Wind | year=2001 | publisher=J & C Enterprises | isbn=0971722307 | chapter = Chapter 3: The New Code | page = 174 | quote=Triple Description also owes much to Castaneda's definition of a warrior as a person who collects multiple descriptions of the world (without any movement to resolve the question of which of these descriptions represents reality).[/tpl]) influenced by the shamanism described in the books of Carlos Castaneda. Several ideas and techniques have been borrowed from Castaneda and incorporated into NLP including so-called double induction and the notion of "stopping the world"[tpl]cite book| last1 = Grimley| first1 = Bruce| title = Theory and Practice of NLP Coaching: A Psychological Approach| edition = 1st| year = 2013| publisher = Sage Publications Ltd| location = London| isbn = 9781446201725| page = 31| url = http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ncPP-6AGIJkC&pg=PA31[/tpl] which is central to NLP modeling. Tye (1994) characterizes NLP as a type of "psycho shamanism". Fanthorpe and Fanthorpe (2008)[tpl]cite book| last1 = Fanthorpe| first1 = Lionel| last2 =  Fanthorpe| first2 =  Patricia| title = Mysteries and Secrets of Voodoo, Santeria, and Obeah| edition = 1st| year = 2008| publisher = New Page Books| location = New Jersey| isbn = 9781550027846| page = 112| url = http://books.google.com.au/books?id=c2xkzYS1z_AC&pg=PA112[/tpl] see a similarity between the mimetic procedure and intent of NLP modeling and aspects of ritual in some syncretic religions. Hunt (2003) draws a comparison between the concern with lineage from an NLP guru—which is evident amongst some NLP proponents—and the concern with guru lineage in some Eastern religions.
In Aupers and Houtman (2010) Bovbjerg identifies NLP as a New Age "psycho-religion" and uses NLP as a case-study to demonstrate the thesis that the New Age psycho-religions such as NLP are predicated on an instrinsically religious idea, namely concern with a transcendent "other". In the world's monotheistic faiths, argues Bovbjerg, the purpose of religious practice is communion and fellowship with a  transcendent 'other', i.e. a God.   With the New Age psycho-religions, argues Bovbjerg, this orientation towards a transcendent 'other' persists but the other has become "the other in our selves", the so-called unconscious: "the individual's inner life becomes the intangible focus of psycho-religious practices and the subconscious becomes a constituent part of modern individuals' understanding of the Self."  Bovbjerg adds, "courses in personal development would make no sense without an unconscious that contains hidden resources and hidden knowledge of the self."  Thus psycho-religious practice revolves around ideas of the conscious and unconscious self and communicating with and accessing the hidden resources of the unconscious self—the transcendent other. According to Bovbjerg the notion that we have an unconscious self underlies many NLP techniques either explicitly or implicitly. Bovbjerg argues, "through particular practices, the practitioner qua psycho-religious practitioner expects to achieve self-perfection in a never-ending transformation of the self."
Bovbjerg's secular critique of NLP is echoed in the conservative Christian perspective of the New Age as represented by Jeremiah (1995)[tpl]cite book| last1 = Jeremiah| first1 = David| title = Invasion of Other Gods: The Seduction of New Age Spirituality| edition = 1st| year = 1995| publisher = W Publishing Group| location = | isbn = 0849939879| chapter = Chapter 9 Corporate Takeovers|url = http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ak6a3Ye53OYC[/tpl] who argues that, "the ′transformation′ recommended by the founders and leaders of these business seminars as NLP has spiritual implications that a non-Christian or new believer may not recognise. The belief that human beings can change themselves by calling upon the power (or god) within or their own infinite human potential is a contradiction of the Christian view. The Bible says man is a sinner and is saved by God's grace alone."
The quasi-religiosity of New Age belief and practice—even to the extent of "self-improvement" technique—was affirmed in a series of US court cases brought by employees against their employers whom mandated corporate New Age training. The plaintiffs claimed that these trainings conflicted with their religious beliefs.[tpl]cite news | last = Buchanan | first = Julie M. | title = New Age-type training can trigger lawsuits | newspaper = The Milwaukee Sentinel | location = Milwaukee | page = 16 | date = 13 September 1993 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=g5hQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ABMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5266%2C3748228 | accessdate = 7 August 2013[/tpl]  On this subject, Young—in Heuberger and Nash (1994)[tpl]cite book| editor1-last =  Heuberger| editor1-first = Frank W| editor2-last =  Nash| editor2-first = Laura L.| title = A Fatal Embrace?: Assessing Holistic Trends in Human Resources Programs| edition = 1st| year = 1994| publisher = Transaction Publishers| location = New Jersey| isbn = 1560001232| pages = 22–4| url = http://books.google.com.au/books?id=mi3KBzx5r1gC&pg=PA22[/tpl]—specifies, "such New Age methods include meditation, yoga, biofeedback, centering, guided visualizations, affirmations, Akido-based exercise sic, self-hypnosis, fire walking, and Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP)".

==Intellectual property disputes==

By the end of 1980, the collaboration between Bandler and Grinder ended.  On 25 September 1981, Bandler instituted a civil action against Grinder and his company, seeking injunctive relief and damages for Grinder's commercial activity in relation to NLP. On 29 October 1981, judgement was made in favor of Bandler.[tpl]cite court|litigants = Not Ltd v. Unlimited Ltd et al (Super. Ct. Santa Cruz County, 1981, No. 78482) |vol =|reporter =|opinion = |pinpoint = |court = Super. Ct.

In July 1996 and January 1997, Bandler instituted a further two civil actions against Grinder and his company, numerous other prominent figures in NLP and 200 further initially unnamed persons. Bandler alleged that Grinder had violated the terms of the settlement agreement reached in the initial case and had suffered commercial damage as a result of the allegedly illegal commercial activities of the defendants. Bandler sought from each defendant damages no less than US$10,000,000.00.[tpl]cite web | title = Summary of the Legal Proceedings January 1997-June 23, 2003| url = http://www.steverrobbins.com/nlpschedule/random/lawsuit-text.html | accessdate = 12 June 2013[/tpl]  In February 2000, the Court found against Bandler, stating that "Bandler has misrepresented to the public, through his licensing agreement and promotional materials, that he is the exclusive owner of all intellectual property rights associated with NLP, and maintains the exclusive authority to determine membership in and certification in the Society of NLP."[tpl]cite court |litigants = Richard W Bandler et al v.

On this matter Stollznow (2010) comments, "ironically, Bandler and Grinder feuded in the 1980s over trademark and theory disputes. Tellingly, none of their myriad of NLP models, pillars, and principles helped these founders to resolve their personal and professional conflicts."
In December 1997, Tony Clarkson instituted civil proceedings against Bandler to have Bandler's UK trademark of NLP revoked. The Court found in favor of Clarkson; Bandler's trademark was subsequently revoked.[tpl]cite web | title = Case details for trade mark UK00002067188 | url = http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/1/UK00002067188 | date = 13 June 2013 | accessdate = 110 July 1996 [/tpl]
By the end of 2000, Bandler and Grinder entered a release where they agreed, amongst other things, that "they are the co-creators and co-founders of the technology of Neuro-linguistic Programming" and "mutually agree to refrain from disparaging each other's efforts, in any fashion, concerning their respective involvement in the field of NeuroLinguistic Programming."

As a consequence of these disputes and settlements, the names NLP and Neuro-linguistic Programming are not owned by any party and there is no restriction on any party offering NLP certification.[tpl]cite web | last =Hall | first = L.Michael | title = The lawsuit that almost killed NLP | url = http://www.neurosemantics.com/nlp/the-history-of-nlp/the-lawsuit-that-almost-killed-nlp | date = September 20, 2010| accessdate = 12 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = | first =  | title = NLP Archives - Frequently Asked Questions about NLP | url = http://users.telenet.be/merlevede/nlpfaq35.htm | accessdate = 12 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | last = | first =  | title = NLP Archives - Frequently Asked Questions about NLP | url = http://users.telenet.be/merlevede/lawsuit.htm | accessdate = 12 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Trademark Status and Document Retrieval | url = http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75351747&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch | date = 13 June 2013 | accessdate = 14 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Trademark Status and Document Retrieval | url = http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=73253122&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch | date = 13 June 2013 | accessdate = 14 June 2013[/tpl]

==Associations, certification, and practitioner standards==

The names NLP and Neuro-linguistic Programming are not owned by any person or organisation, they are not trademarked intellectual property[tpl]cite web | title = NLP FAQ | url = http://users.telenet.be/merlevede/nlpfaq35.htm | date = 27 July 2001 | accessdate = 14 June 2013[/tpl] and there is no central regulating authority for NLP instruction and certification.  There is no restriction on who can describe themselves as an NLP Master Practitioner or NLP Master Trainer and there are a multitude of certifying associations; this has led Devilly (2005) to describe such training and certifying associations as granfalloons, i.e. proud and meaningless associations of human beings.
There is great variation in the depth and breadth of training and standards of practitioners, and some disagreement between those in the field about which patterns are, or are not, actual NLP.Irish National Center for Guidance in Education's "Guidance Counsellor's Handbook NLP is  an open field of training with no "official" best practice. With different authors, individual trainers and practitioners having developed their own methods, concepts and labels, often branding them as NLP, the training standards and quality differ greatly.  In 2009, a British television presenter was able to register his pet cat as a member of the British Board of Neuro Linguistic Programming (BBNLP), which subsequently claimed that it existed only to provide benefits to its members and not to certify credentials.[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8303126.stm | title=Cat registered as hypnotherapist | publisher=BBC | date=October 12, 2009 | accessdate=November 6, 2009[/tpl]
