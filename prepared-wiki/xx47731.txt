[[Kronecker delta]]

CATEGORIES: Mathematical notation, Elementary special functions

In mathematics, the Kronecker delta or Kronecker's delta, named after Leopold Kronecker, is a function of two variables, usually integers.  The function is 1 if the variables are equal, and 0 otherwise:
In  linear algebra, the identity matrix can be written as
and the inner product of vectors can be written as 
The Kronecker delta is used in many areas of mathematics, physics and engineering, primarily as an expedient to convey in a single equation what might otherwise take several lines of text.

==Properties==

The following equations are satisfied: 
Therefore, δij can be considered as an identity matrix.

==Alternative notation==

Using the Iverson bracket:
Sometimes the Kronecker delta is called the substitution tensor.Trowbridge, 1998. Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology. V15, 1 p291

==Digital signal processing==

The function is referred to as an impulse, or unit impulse.  And when it stimulates a signal processing element, the output is called the impulse response of the element.

==Properties of the delta function==

and if the integers are viewed as a measure space, endowed with the counting measure, then this property coincides with the defining property of the Dirac delta function
The Kronecker delta forms the multiplicative identity element of an incidence algebra.[tpl]citation | first1=Eugene | last1=Spiegel | first2=Christopher J. | last2=O'Donnell | title=Incidence algebras | publisher=Marcel Dekker | isbn=0-8247-0036-8 | year=1997 | series=Pure and Applied Mathematics | volume=206 [/tpl].

==Relationship to the Dirac delta function==

Under certain conditions, the Kronecker delta can arise from sampling a Dirac delta function.  For example, if a Dirac delta impulse occurs exactly at a sampling point and is ideally lowpass-filtered (with cutoff at the critical frequency) per the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem, the resulting discrete-time signal will be a Kronecker delta function.

==Generalizations of the Kronecker delta==

If it is considered as a type (1,1) tensor, the Kronecker tensor, it can be written
This (1,1) tensor represents:
[tpl]anchor|generalized Kronecker delta[/tpl]The generalized Kronecker delta of order 2p is a type (p,p) tensor that is a completely antisymmetric in its p upper indices, and also in its p lower indices.

Using the Laplace expansion (Laplace's formula) of determinant, it may be defined recursively:A recursive definition requires a first case, which may be taken as δ = 1 for p = 0, or alternatively δ[tpl]su|p=μ|b=ν[/tpl] = δ[tpl]su|p=μ|b=ν[/tpl] for p = 1 (generalized delta in terms of standard delta).

===Properties of generalized Kronecker delta===

The generalized Kronecker delta may be used for anti-symmetrization:
From the above equations and the properties of anti-symmetric tensor, we can derive the properties of the generalized Kronecker delta:  
which are the generalized version of formulae written in the section Properties.
The last formula is equivalent to the  Cauchy–Binet formula.
Reducing the order via summation of the indices may be expressed by the identity[ref]

Using both the summation rule for the case [tpl]nowrap|1=p = n[/tpl] and the relation with the Levi-Civita symbol,
the summation rule of the Levi-Civita symbol is derived:

==Integral representations==

For any integer n, using a standard residue calculation we can write an integral representation for the Kronecker delta as the integral below, where the contour of the integral goes counterclockwise around zero. This representation is also equivalent to a definite integral by a rotation in the complex plane.

==The Kronecker comb==

The Kronecker comb function with period N is defined (using DSP notation) as:
where N and n are integers. The Kronecker comb thus consists of an infinite series of unit impulses N units apart, and includes the unit impulse at zero. It may be considered to be the discrete analog of the Dirac comb.
