"Lonely" (also known as "Mr. Lonely") is a single by Senegalese-American R&B and hip hop singer Akon; it appears on his debut album, Trouble. The single was released in 2005 and was his first worldwide hit. It reached number one in several countries, including in the United Kingdom and Germany (where it stayed there for eight weeks), and Australia. It was also highly popular in France where it reached number two, and in the United States when it peaked at #4. An edited version is on Radio Disney's playlist and on Radio Disney Jams, Vol. 8.

==Background==

When Akon was signed by Universal imprint SRC Records it was "Lonely" that had immediately caught the attention of SRC A&R Jerome Foster and convinced him of Akon's talents.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JeromeFoster.html |title=Interview With Knobody |publisher=HitQuarters|date=Sep 27, 2005 |accessdate=Jul 1, 2010[/tpl] On hearing the demo track he had said, "This kid is official - this is a huge record." Despite offering the album's best option in terms of commercial breakthrough, SRC Records chose "Locked Up" over "Lonely" as the first single because SRC wanted to break Akon in the streets first and work towards a cross-over. According to Foster in an interview with HitQuarters, ""Locked Up" is a street record. I thought that was the place for us to start to get a fan-base knowing that we had a record like "Lonely", which was more commercial, to follow it."

==Writing and inspiration==

The song uses sped-up samples from Bobby Vinton's song "Mr. Lonely", providing a vocal sound similar to Alvin and the Chipmunks, made famous by producers such as RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan, Newcleus and Kanye West. The song is written by Gene Allen, Bobby Vinton, and Akon himself. Another version with a faster pace exists that is about 3 minutes and 45 seconds long. The lyrics are sung mainly by Akon as well as Bobby Vinton doing parts of the choruses.

==Music video==

A music video was produced to promote the single. The video was directed by Gil Green.
Actress Katerina Graham starred in the video as Akon's love partner. Also a lucky competition winner, Daniel Ellwood, starred in the video.
