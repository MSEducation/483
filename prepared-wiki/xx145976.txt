Jon Christopher Davis (born June 27, 1968) is an American musician and singer-songwriter best known for the songs,  "Relay For Life" (American Cancer Society), "The Boy I Left Behind," "Lone Star Attitude," "Baby Looks Good on You" and "The Bottom Line." His musical influences include The Eagles, Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, Bryan Adams, Merle Haggard and Johnny Cash.

==Early career (1996–2001)==

After cutting his musical teeth in the early 1990s playing the Dallas club scene, Jon Christopher Davis moved to Nashville in 1996 under the guidance of legendary Texas singer-songwriter, Rodney Crowell. In 1998, he signed with Warner/Chappell Music as a staff songwriter where he wrote songs for such artists as Dolly Parton, Hal Ketchum, Billy Ray Cyrus and Sherrie Austin. In 1999, Jon Christopher signed a developmental artist deal with Warner Bros. Records. Although the project was shelved by the label for not being Country enough, his self produced recordings caught the attention of hit producer, Dann Huff.  Huff quickly signed Davis to his new subsidiary label under Sony Records; but after two years, Sony pulled the plug on the project due to internal politics between Huff and Sony.

==2002–2007==

In 2002, Jon Christopher signed a new development deal with MCA Records where Radney Foster took the role of producing the album.  That same year, he also signed a new publishing deal with BMG Publishing where he wrote two of his biggest songs, Lone Star Attitude and Baby Looks Good on You - both songs have since transitioned into trademarked brands.
After listening to the Foster-produced tracks, MCA executives considered them 'too Texas' for Nashville.  So, under the advisement of Mr. Foster, Jon Christopher returned to his Texas roots and signed with indie label, Palo Duro Records.  After his debut CD received a nationwide release in 2006, USA TODAY selected The Bottom Line song from the album as one of the most intriguing tracks from the present, the past and the near future.  The album also got the attention of popular music critic Robert K. Oermann: "I’m a huge fan of this man’s album. Its second single sizzles with zesty rhythm, yelping vocals, sidewinder guitar and a ridiculously catchy melody. The major-label “stars” on Music Row have nothing on this guy. Play this!"

==2008–Present==

In September 2008, Jon Christopher launched the boutique label & production company, JustCoolMusic with a business partner. Its first release was a patriotic song called The Boy I Left Behind - a duet written and recorded by Jon Christopher and fellow Texas singer-songwriter, Deryl Dodd that eventually became the official theme song for The American Fallen Soldiers Project.
In 2009, he became the Texas-voice for TXU Energy and released the 2 disk CD, Demos from the Vault (1999–2009).
In 2010, Jon Christopher wrote and recorded "Relay For Life," which soon after won the national Relay For Life Music Contest held by the American Cancer Society. He also co-wrote and produced a children's album for the intellectual property, TX (the Lone Star Hero). The character is still in development.
In 2011, he wrote & produced theme songs for the National PTA, Texas Tourism Department, G4S, IBEW and the advocacy and legal defense organization, Liberty Institute. "Don't Tear Me Down," written for Liberty Institute, received national attention when the Washington Post reported on the controversial legal battle and music video.[tpl]cite news|title=Washington Post|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/for-gods-sake/post/memorial-day-becomes-religious-battleground/2012/05/27/gJQAKKzRvU_blog.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Brad|last=Hirschfield[/tpl]  
In 2012, Jon Christopher co-wrote and produced "Power of a Girl" for the Girl Scouts 100 year anniversary.

His music was heard on ABC, CBS, FOX, the Style Network, CW Network, Pentagon Network and the Oxygen Channel.
