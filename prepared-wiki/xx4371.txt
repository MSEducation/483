The Holocene extinction, sometimes called the Sixth Extinction, is a name proposed to describe the extinction event of species that has occurred during the present Holocene epoch (since around 10,000 BC). The large number of extinctions span numerous families of plants and animals including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and arthropods. Although 875 extinctions occurring between 1500 and 2009 have been documented by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources,[tpl]cite web |title=Extinction continues apace |url=http://www.iucn.org/?4143/Extinction-crisis-continues-apace |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature |date=3 November 2009 |accessdate=18 October 2012[/tpl] the vast majority are undocumented. According to the species-area theory and based on upper-bound estimating, the present rate of extinction may be up to 140,000 species per year.S.L. Pimm, G.J. Russell, J.L. Gittleman and T.M. Brooks, The Future of Biodiversity, Science 269: 347–350 (1995)
The Holocene extinction includes the disappearance of large mammals known as megafauna, starting between 9,000 and 13,000 years ago, the end of the last Ice Age. This may have been due to the extinction of the mammoth that had maintained grasslands that became birch forests without the mammoths.Doughty, C. E., A. Wolf, and C. B. Field (2010), Biophysical feedbacks between the Pleistocene megafauna extinction and climate: The first human‐induced global warming?,Geophys. Res. Lett., 37, L15703, [tpl]DOI|10.1029/2010GL043985[/tpl] The new forest and the resulting forest fires may have induced climate change. Such disappearances might be the result of the proliferation of modern humans which led to climate change. These extinctions, occurring near the Pleistocene–Holocene boundary, are sometimes referred to as the Quaternary extinction event. The Holocene extinction continues into the 21st century.
There is no general agreement on whether to consider this as merely part of the Quaternary extinction event, or just a result of human caused changes.[tpl]cite doi|10.1023/A:1022912030020[/tpl]  Only during these most recent parts of the extinction have plants also suffered large losses. Overall, the Holocene extinction can be characterized by humanity's presence.

==Prehistoric extinctions==

===North and South America===

There was a debate as to the extent to which the disappearance of megafauna at the end of the last glacial period can be attributed to human activities, directly, by hunting, or indirectly, by decimation of prey populations. Discoveries at Monte Verde in South America, and at Meadowcroft Rock Shelter in Pennsylvania have generated a controversyThe Early Settlement of North America. The Clovis Era. Gary Haynes 2002 ISBN 9780521524636. 18–19. regarding the "Clovis Culture. There likely have been human settlements prior to the Clovis Culture and the history for the humans in the Americas may extend back many thousands of years before the Clovis Culture. There is often no strong correlation between human arrival and megafauna extinction, an example being from Wrangel Island in Siberia where the extinction of midget Mammoths (approximately 1000 BC)Martin, P.S. 1995. Mammoth Extinction: Two Continents and Wrangel Island. Radiocarbon, Vol. 37(1) 7–10 did not coincide with the arrival of humans.
The ongoing extinction seems more outstanding in light of separating recent extinctions (approximately since the industrial revolution) from the Pleistocene extinction near the end of the last glacial period. The latter is exemplified by the extinction of large herbivores such as the woolly mammoth and the carnivores that preyed on them. We know that humans of this era actively hunted the mammoth and the mastodonPitulko, V. V., P. A. Nikolsky, E. Y. Girya, A. E. Basilyan, V. E. Tumskoy, S. A. Koulakov, S. N. Astakhov, E. Y. Pavlova, and M. A. Anisimov (2004), The Yana RHS site: Humans in the Arctic before the Last Glacial Maximum, Science, 303(5654), 52–56, [tpl]DOI|10.1126/science.1085219[/tpl] but it is not known if this hunting was the cause of the subsequent massive ecological changes, widespread extinctions and climate changes. The ecosystems encountered by the first Americans had not been exposed to human interaction and were far less resilient to man made changes than the ecosystems encountered by industrial era humans, those environments seasoned as they were, having been exposed to over 10,000 years of human interaction. Therefore the actions of the Clovis people and likewise, despite seeming insignificant by today's standards could indeed have had a profound effect on the ecosystems and wild life which was entirely unused to human influence. 

===New Zealand===

Circa 1500, several species became extinct after Polynesian settlers arrived, including:

===Pacific, including Hawaii===

Recent research, based on archaeological and paleontological digs on 70 different islands, has shown that numerous species went extinct as people moved across the Pacific, starting 30,000 years ago in the Bismarck Archipelago and Solomon Islands.[tpl]harvnb|Steadman|Martin|2003[/tpl] It is currently estimated that among the bird species of the Pacific some 2000 species have gone extinct since the arrival of humans.[tpl]harvnb|Steadman|1995[/tpl] Among the extinctions were:
Ten species or subspecies of birds have disappeared from the Hawaiian islands since the 1980s. These include the Kaua'i O'o, Nukupu'u, 'Akialoa, Kama'o, Po'ouli, and others.

===Madagascar===

Starting with the arrival of humans around 2,000 years ago, nearly all of the island's megafauna became extinct, including:

===Indian Ocean Islands===

Starting c. 1500, a number of species became extinct upon human settlement of the islands, including:

==Ongoing Holocene extinction==

One scientist estimates the current extinction rate may be 10,000 times the background extinction rate. Nevertheless most scientists predict a much lower extinction rate than this outlying estimate.J.H.Lawton and R.M.May, Extinction Rates, Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK Stuart Pimm stated "the current rate of species extinction is about 100 times the natural rate" for plants,Has Plant Life Reached Its Limits? September 20, 2012 and the number of extinctions that we have actually documented suggests we're on par with the background rate (1–10 species lost per year).[tpl]cite book|last=Baillie|first=The IUCN species survival commission ; Jonathan E.

Megafaunal extinctions continue into the 21st century. Modern extinctions are more directly attributable to human influences. Extinction rates are minimized in the popular imagination by the survival of captive populations of animals that are extinct in the wild (Père David's Deer, etc.), by marginal survivals of highly publicized megafauna that are ecologically extinct (the Giant Panda, Sumatran Rhinoceros, North American Black-Footed Ferret, etc.) and by extinctions among arthropods. Some examples of modern extinctions of "charismatic" mammal fauna include:
Many birds have become extinct as a result of human activity, especially birds endemic to islands, including many flightless birds (see a more complete list under extinct birds). Notable extinct birds include:
The decline of amphibian populations has also been identified as an indicator of environmental degradation.

==Human influence on extinction==

Extinction of animals, plants, and other organisms caused by human actions may go as far back as the late Pleistocene, over 12,000 years ago. There is evidence that abrupt climate change has especially played an enormous role in the extinction of larger mammals.[tpl]cite journal|last=Zalasiewicz|first=Jan|coauthors=Williams, Mark; Smith, Alan; Barry, Tiffany L.; Coe, Angela L.; Bown, Paul R.; Brenchley, Patrick; Cantrill, David; Gale, Andrew; Gibbard, Philip; Gregory, F.

At present, the rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than the "base" or historically typical rate of extinction (in terms of the natural evolution of the planet)[tpl]cite journal|author=Lawton, J. H. and May, R. M.|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1995[/tpl] and also the current rate of extinction is, therefore, 10 to 100 times higher than any of the previous mass extinctions in the history of Earth.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] On the other hand, this extinction concerns a large number of plants, different from previous extinctions.
The abundance of species extinctions considered anthropogenic, or due to human activity, have sometimes (especially when referring to hypothesized future events) been collectively called the "Anthropocene extinction".[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.5194/bgd-5-2401-2008|last=Wooldridge|first=S.

Most biologists believe that we are at the beginning of an anthropogenic mass extinction that is accelerating at a large rate.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl] In The Future of Life (2002), E.O. Wilson of Harvard calculated that, if the current rate of human disruption of the biosphere continues, one-half of Earth's higher lifeforms will be extinct by 2100. A 1998 poll conducted by the American Museum of Natural History found that seventy percent of biologists believe that we are in the midst of an anthropogenic extinction.American Museum of Natural History Press Release Numerous scientific studies—such as a 2004 report published in Nature,Study sees mass extinctions via warming. MSNBC. URL accessed July 26, 2006. and papers authored by the 10,000 scientists who contribute to the IUCN's annual Red List of threatened species—have since reinforced this conviction.
The evidence of all previous extinctions is geological in nature, and shorter geological time scale is of the order of several hundred thousand to several million years. Even extinctions caused by instantaneous events such as the impact of the asteroid in Chicxulub, which is currently the best example, extend the equivalent of many human lives, due to complex ecological interactions that are triggered by the event.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2013[/tpl]
Recent extinctions described are well-documented, but the nomenclature used varies. The term Anthropocene is a term that is used by few scientists, and some commentators may refer to the current and projected future extinctions as part of a longer Holocene extinction.[tpl]cite book|last=Elewa|first=Ashraf M. T|editor-first=Ashraf M. T |editor-last=Elewa |title=Mass Extinction|pages=191–194|chapter=14. Current mass extinction|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-75916-4_14[/tpl] The Holocene–Anthropocene boundary is contested, with some commentators asserting significant human influence on climate for much of what is normally regarded as the Holocene Epoch.[tpl]cite journal | doi = 10.1038/news031208-7 | first1= Betsy |last1= Mason | title = Man has been changing climate for 8,000 years | journal = Nature | date = 10 December 2003 [/tpl] Other commentators place the Holocene–Anthropocene boundary at the industrial revolution while also saying that "Formal adoption of this term in the near future will largely depend on its utility, particularly to earth scientists working on late Holocene successions. "
Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain the extinction of megafauna in the late Pleistocene. Of these, only two have much scientific credibility. Although Ross McPhee proposed that a hyper-disease may have been the cause of the extinction,MacPhee and Marx published their hyperdisease hypothesis in 1997. "The 40,000-year plague: Humans, hyperdisease, and first-contact extinctions." In S. M. Goodman and B. D. Patterson (eds), Natural Change and Human Impact in Madagascar, pp. 169–217, Smithsonian Institution Press: Washington DC. the study by Lyons et al., demonstrated conclusively that a hyperdisease was unlikely to have caused the extinction.[tpl]cite journal|last=Lyons|first=S.

The climate change theory has suggested that a change in climate near the end of the late Pleistocene stressed the megafauna to the point of extinction.Graham, R. W. and Mead, J. I. 1987.
