[[California's Gold]]

CATEGORIES: 1990s American television series

California's Gold is a public television travel program that explores the natural, cultural, and historical features of the state of California. The show ran for 18 seasons from 1994 to 2012 and was produced and hosted by Huell Howser for its entire run. The minimal production allowed locations and people to remain the focal point of the program. The show ceased production after Howser's death in 2013.
The show's theme song varies between several renditions of "California, Here I Come", but was most often played on the series by local musicians Eddie Enderle and Richard Chon.
