When the Snowy Mountains Scheme commenced in 1949, the road began to increase in importance. Roadworks to increase the standard of the road were undertaken, and were often paid for by the [[Snowy Hydro|Snowy Mountains
Hydro-Electric Authority]]. In 1955, it was decided that what was still then known as the Monaro Highway would be renamed as the Snowy Mountains Highway. This was done as only a relatively small portion of the road was actually within the Monaro region. The section of road between [tpl]NSWcity|Cooma[/tpl] and [tpl]NSWcity|Nimmitabel[/tpl] was also reclassified as part of State Highway 19, which at that time ran from Canberra, to the Victorian border west of [tpl]NSWcity|Delegate[/tpl]. The various roads classified as State Highway 19, were then named as the Monaro Highway in 1958. In contrast with the Snowy Mountains Highway, the entire length of that highway is within the Monaro region.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.shop.nsw.gov.au/shopnsw/documents/agency22/RTA012.pdf | title=Monaro Highway | publisher=NSW Department of Main Roads | work=Main Roads | date=December 1959 | accessdate=25 July 2013 | pages=49[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article103124551 |title=Monaro Highway New Name For Cooma Road. | work=The Canberra Times |date=21 October 1958 |accessdate=25 July 2013 |page=3[/tpl]
Over the years further changes to the alignment have occurred. The eastern section of the highway no longer runs west to Nimittabel, instead meeting the Monaro Highway to the south; the old section has been renamed as Old Bega Road. It also no longer runs east to the coast at Tathra, and now terminates where it meets the Princes Highway; the section from Bega to Tathra has been renamed as Tathra Road.[tpl]cite map | url=http://maps.six.nsw.gov.au/ | title=SIX Maps | publisher=NSW Government - Land and Property Information | accessdate=29 June 2013 | cartography=NSW Department of Finance and Services, Sinclair Knight Merz, and Astrium GEO-Information Services[/tpl] The western section has also seen some major changes with the highway being realigned to avoid Lake Eucumbene near [tpl]NSWcity|Adaminaby[/tpl] due to the construction of Eucumbene Dam in the 1950s.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article91593826 |title=Adaminaby Road Closures. | work=The Canberra Times |date=19 July 1957 |accessdate=27 July 2013 |page=2[/tpl] Similarly realignment was required to avoid the Jounama Pondage and Blowering Reservoir near [tpl]NSWcity|Talbingo[/tpl] due to the construction of Jounama and Blowering Dams in the 1960s.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article106953154 |title=Road conditions for Christmas tourists. |work=The Canberra Times |date=20 December 1966 |accessdate=27 July 2013 |page=28[/tpl]

===Route markers===

Route markers were first introduced in Australia in late 1954. Over the following decades they were progressively rolled out to the various highways around the nation, under a nationwide route numbering scheme.[tpl]cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article23415470 |title=It will be 'Highway 31'. |work=The Argus |location=Melbourne, Victoria |date=13 August 1954 |accessdate=28 July 2013 |page=5[/tpl] Previous to the NSW conversion to alphanumeric routes in 2013, the highway was signed as National Route 18 shield along its entire length. In addition to this, the section of the Monaro Highway between Cooma and Steeple Flat was also signed the National Route 18 shield in addition to the National Route 23 route marker used along the remainder of its length within NSW; this kind of arrangement is known as a duplex or concurrency. This allowed one route to cover the highway from end to end.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/RouteNumbering/National%20Routes/18/nr18.htm | title=National Route 18 | publisher=Ozroads | work=Photos of the Snowy Mountains Highway | accessdate=27 July 2013[/tpl] The Snowy Mountains Highway was allocated the alphanumeric route B72 as part of New South Wales' 2013 conversion. The route duplex along the Monaro Highway remains intact with B72 used in addition to B23 between Cooma and Steeple Flat.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadprojects/projects/alpha_numeric/documents/southern_illawarra_woll.pdf | title=Alpha numeric route number maps - Southern NSW | publisher=NSW Government - Roads and Maritime Services | date=April 2013 | accessdate=27 July 2013[/tpl]
