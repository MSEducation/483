These include The Art of Mentoring, The Super Teams Book and Strengths Coaching In 90 Minutes (the latter co-authored with Sue Moore).

==Biography==

Pegg was born in Leeds, England, in 1944. He grew up in Derbyshire, left school at 15 and worked in a factory for six years. First given the chance to work with people by Community Service Volunteers in 1965, Mike has spent the past 45 years studying what works and helping people to build on their strengths and achieve their picture of success. In 2010 he set up The Strengths Foundation.
Pegg’s early work was captured in the 1972 BBC documentary Escape To Fulfilment (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hC3MeNKiTI), which highlighted his role in running Lancaster House in Richmond. This described the pioneering therapeutic community he ran for young people. They were encouraged: 
a) To take responsibility; 
b) To build on their strengths; 
c) To manage the consequences of their weaknesses. 
They then encouraged each other to stay healthy and achieve success.
In 1974 Pegg set-up his own company dedicated to helping people to build on their strengths and achieve ongoing success. Invited to work in Scandinavia, he spent over a decade there educating leaders in schools, business and sports. Returning to the UK in 1986, he has since focused on working with pioneering individuals, teams and organisations.
His approach has always been to study, simplify and share what works. This has led to providing practical tools that people have used to build super teams and superb organisations[tpl]Cn|date=April 2013[/tpl]. These have been adopted by organisations to build excellence cultures, rather than excuse cultures[tpl]Cn|date=April 2013[/tpl]. They have delivered a clear story, strategy and road to success[tpl]Cn|date=April 2013[/tpl].
Pegg’s style is encouraging and generous, but it is also extremely clear[tpl]Cn|date=April 2013[/tpl]. He only works with people, teams and organisations that aim to be positive, professional and peak performers[tpl]Cn|date=April 2013[/tpl]. Many organisations report that this approach works[tpl]Cn|date=April 2013[/tpl]. People take away practical tools they can use to deliver peak performance.
A strong advocate of sharing knowledge, Mike set up The Strengths Foundation in 2010. The Foundation’s site is packed with positive models and practical tools that people can download and use in their own way.

==Bibliography==

Pegg published several books in Scandinavia in the 1970s and 80s. These are no longer in print. The following books have been published in the UK, with other editions being published in various countries.
