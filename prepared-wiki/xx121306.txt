[[Accadia]]

CATEGORIES: Cities and towns in Apulia

Accadia is a town and comune in the province of Foggia in the Apulia region of southeast Italy. Until the mid-20th century it was just within the eastern frontier of the region of Campania in the province of Avellino.
It is not far from Foggia on the rich agricultural plains of the Tavoliere delle Puglie in the east, nor from Naples to the west and occupies a hilltop at 600 metres of elevation.
Population increases in summer when many of its migrant labour force return home to take up temporary residence and visit family.

==History==

The town originated as a settlement of the Dardani, between the 2nd and 1st millennium BC. Later it was part of the Roman Empire. According to the tradition, the name derives from a temple to the Roman mythological figure Acca Larentia which existed here.
In the past it had a much larger population than it does today. A Neapolitan army sacked it during the Bourbon period. They also took the gates of the town as booty, and these are still to be seen in the civic museum in Naples to this day. These events are recorded on a  frieze on the clock tower on the main square in the centre of the town. There is also one remaining Roman arch at a former entrance to the town.
In addition there is extensive redevelopment of the formerly inhabited old quarter of town, which was abandoned after an earthquake in the 1930s. This was when a large portion of the towns population emigrated and established a colony in Buffalo, New York, in the United States.

==Twin towns==

Accadia has also a friendship agreement with Spello, also in Italy.
