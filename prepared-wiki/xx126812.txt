WLLX (97.5 FM) is a Class C-2 FM radio station serving the southern Tennessee area. The station was one of the first in the nation to own and operate a live, color weather radar system and distribute the images to its listeners via a subcarrier on the primary FM signal.
The station has had a successful history of serving the community in times of breaking news and severe weather conditions. WLLX-FM was granted a construction permit by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2005 to upgrade its power from 25 kW to 50 kW. The project was completed and the station signed on the air in mid-January 2006 serving a population total near 3.5 million in the area south of Nashville, Tennessee to just north of Birmingham, Alabama.
The station is based in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee.
On August 5, 2008 WLLX-FM split its simulcast with WWLX-AM. The AM station re-launched with a new branding, Classic Hits WLX, and a Classic Rock music format. Classic Hits WLX broadcasts on three FM translators, FM 105.3, FM 103.7, and FM 100.9, in addition to the primary AM station.
Both stations are owned and operated by Prospect Communications.

WLLX-FM's programming is also carried on a broadcast translator station to extend or improve the coverage area of the station.
