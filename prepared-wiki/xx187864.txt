ABB Grain was Australia's largest agribusiness. Founded in 1939, the company was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange until its takeover by Viterra in 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.abb.com.au/AboutABB/WhoWeAre.aspx|title=Who We Are|publisher=ABB Grain|accessdate=28 April 2008[/tpl] Until recently, the company focused solely on grain accumulation and marketing. It expanded its focus to other activities, such as grain receival and storage, malting and fertilisers. ABB buys grain from all growing regions in Australia and trades in all grain commodities.

==History==

ABB traces its origins to the former Australian Barley Board, and due to the company's expanded operations into different areas, it demutualised to become ABB Grain on 1 July 1999.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/grain/circular/1999/99-08/dtricks.htm|title=Foreign Countries' Policies and Programs|date=13 November 2003|publisher=Foreign Agricultural Service|accessdate=28 April 2008[/tpl] In 2004, ABB merged with the South Australian storage and handling company AusBulk and the holding company United Grower Holdings. This brought the control of the two major grain handlers, along with several of AusBulk's divisions.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/06/07/1086460232001.html|title=ABB Grain, AusBulk board named|date=7 June 2004|publisher=The Age|accessdate=30 April 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.bulkmaterialsinternational.com/htm/n20040501.390217.htm|title=AusBulk/ ABB to merge|date=May–June 2004|publisher=Bulk Materials International|accessdate=20 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090609024400/http://www.bulkmaterialsinternational.com/htm/n20040501.390217.htm| archivedate= 9 June 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
Since its merger with AusBulk, ABB's supply chain has involved operations in storage and handling and logistics. This includes a significant network of silos and export shipping terminals in South Australia and the eastern states of Australia, incorporating joint ownership of Australian Bulk Alliance, or ABA, with Japanese trading company Sumitomo.
ABB's malting division, Joe White Maltings, is Australia's largest producer of malt with the capacity to produce 500,000 tonnes per annum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.joewhitemaltings.com.au/the_company.html|title=The Company|publisher=Joe White Maltings|accessdate=20 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090609084957/http://www.joewhitemaltings.com.au/the_company.html| archivedate= 9 June 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The eight malting plants located across Australia include the largest malthouse in the southern hemisphere, situated in Perth, Western Australia.
The company also provides rural services including fertiliser and agrichemical supply and wool and livestock activities. The latter have been supported by the acquisitions of Adelaide Wool Company, Wardle Co and Stawool in 2007.
The company also has significant operations in New Zealand focused on the trading and distribution of grains and proteins. In 2007, ABB established a joint venture in Ukraine with French malting company Soufflet to accumulate grain, manage supply chain activities and market grain.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rural/sa/content/2006/s2011097.htm|title=ABB Grain expands to Ukraine|last=Daw|first=Michelle |date=21 August 2007|publisher=ABC Rural|accessdate=20 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090612103555/http://www.abc.net.au/rural/sa/content/2006/s2011097.htm| archivedate= 12 June 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl]
On 19 May 2009 it was announced that ABB would be acquired by Viterra, the largest grain handler in Canada in September 2009, if voted ahead by the shareholders. The Head Office would be relocated to Regina, with the worldwide malting headquarters remaining in Adelaide. The two companies together are responsible for 37 percent of the world's exports of wheat, canola and barley.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.leaderpost.com/Business/Viterra+acquires+Australian+company/1609137/story.html|title=Viterra announces $1.4B deal to acquire Australian company|last=Johnstone|first=Bruce|date=19 May 2009|publisher=Regina Leader-Post|accessdate=20 May 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090609130348/http://www.leaderpost.com/Business/Viterra+acquires+Australian+company/1609137/story.html| archivedate= 9 June 2009 | deadurl= no[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.lloydslistdcn.com.au/archive/2009/may/20/viterra-to-take-over-abb-grain-for-1.6bn|title=Viterra to take over ABB Grain for $1.6bn|last=Toevai|first=Sineva|date=20 May 2009|publisher=Lloyd's List DCN|accessdate=20 May 2009[/tpl][tpl]PDFlink|ABB Grain and Viterra Announce Agreement to Combine Operations|54.1 KiB[/tpl] ABB Grain, 19 May 2009.
