==Martin County sludge spill==

On October 11, 2000, the Martin County sludge spill polluted hundreds of miles of the Ohio River, the Big Sandy River and its tributaries.  The accident was caused when what's known as a coal sludge impoundment owned by Massey Energy in Kentucky broke into an abandoned underground mine below.  Toxic pollutants including heavy metals such as mercury, lead, arsenic, copper and chromium were found in the sludge that spilled into these waterways.Spartanburg Herald-Journal, Retrieved 2011-1-29. 
The spill was 30 times larger than the Exxon Valdez oil spill ([tpl]convert|12|e6USgal|m3[/tpl]) and one of the worst environmental disasters ever in the southeastern United States, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
The river also plays a major role in the Hatfield-McCoy feud.
