==Tradition==

In the 1960s, when Lee's mascot was the Rebel, the school was famous for its working cannon and oversized Confederate flag.  A group of seniors tended the cannon at games, firing it when the Rebel football team scored a touchdown.  The football team entered Rose Stadium by running under the flag, reputed to be the second largest Confederate flag in the world (second only to one owned by the University of Mississippi).  By 1972, the flag was retired and its whereabouts are unknown. The cannon, retired in 1986, is now the property of Brook Hill High School in Bullard, Texas.
