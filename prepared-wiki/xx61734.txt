==Musical approach==

===Vocal characteristics===

As a singer, Yorke is recognisable by his distinctive tenor voice, vibrato, frequent use of falsetto and ability to reach, and sustain notes over a wide vocal range. In 1994, the band watched Jeff Buckley in concert; Yorke later said the concert had a direct effect on his vocal delivery on "Fake Plastic Trees".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.greenplastic.com/lyrics/fakeplastictrees.php|title=greenplastic|accessdate=2008-07-17[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] However, Yorke has said, "It annoys me how pretty my voice is... how polite it can sound when perhaps what I'm singing is deeply acidic."[tpl]cite news|publisher=New York Times|title=With Radiohead, and Alone, the Sweet Malaise of Thom Yorke|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/02/arts/music/02pare.html|accessdate=2008-09-27|first=Jon|last=Pareles|date=2 July 2006[/tpl] He has often adopted other styles of singing, such as an aggressive shouting style in the middle section of "Paranoid Android" and a semi-spoken style for 2003's "Myxomatosis" and "A Wolf at the Door".

===Musicianship===

Aside from vocal duties and writing lyrics, Yorke's musical contributions to Radiohead include guitar, both acoustic and electric (usually rhythm, with band member Jonny Greenwood handling lead), piano, including Rhodes piano, and synthesizers. He also plays bass guitar on occasion (the bass lines for "The National Anthem" and "Pyramid Song" were recorded by him) and live with Radiohead he plays bass on the b-side "The Amazing Sounds of Orgy".  At solo shows and with his band "Atoms for Peace", he would play bass for "Harrowdown Hill" from his album The Eraser.  He is also capable of playing drums; during the 2006 and 2008 tours he performed percussion on stage in tandem with drummer Phil Selway on the track "Bangers + Mash".
Yorke, unlike the other members of Radiohead, has never learned how to read music.[tpl]Citation| title = Happy now?| date = June 2001| url = http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2001&cutting=121| accessdate = 2009-02-21[/tpl] He said, "If someone lays the notes on a page in front of me, it's meaningless... because to me you can't express the rhythms properly like that. It's a very ineffective way of doing it, so I've never really bothered picking it up."
Since Kid A, Radiohead, and in particular Yorke, have incorporated many elements of electronic music into their work. As a result, Yorke has taken an increased role in programming beats and samples and has been credited with playing "laptop" on recent albums. On a radio show in 2003 to publicise the release of Hail to the Thief, Yorke remarked that he would rather make a record just with a computer than with only an acoustic guitar.Jo Whiley's Radio 1 show, 2003. His solo effort The Eraser featured piano, bass and guitar, but was built primarily around electronics.
In interviews Yorke has cited a variety of personal musical heroes and influences, including jazz composer and bassist Charles Mingus, Neil Young, Miracle Legion, singer Scott Walker, electronic acts Aphex Twin and Autechre, and Krautrock band Can. Talking Heads, Queen, Joy Division, Magazine, Elvis Costello, The Smiths and Sonic Youth were early influences on Radiohead and Yorke. In 2004, at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Yorke mentioned to the crowd, "When I was in college, the Pixies and R.E.M. changed my life",[tpl]cite web|publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|url=http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/pop/171708_coachella04.html|title=Pixies dust Coachella music fest with magic|accessdate=2008-07-17[/tpl] and he has often mentioned both bands as influential examples. He is also an admirer of Icelandic singer Björk; he called her song "Unravel" his favourite song ever, claiming "I'm trying to get Radiohead to do a cover because I think it's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard." In November 2007, the band covered the song as part of a live webcast.Radiohead Testcast: Entanglement (pt 2 – Bjork's Unravel). YouTube (2007-11-08). Retrieved 2011-02-28.

==Activism==

Yorke has been outspoken on various contemporary political and social issues. Radiohead had read No Logo by Naomi Klein during the Kid A sessions ("No Logo" was also briefly considered as the album title) and all the members were reportedly heavily influenced by it, though Yorke said it "didn't teach him anything he didn't already know".[tpl]cite web|publisher=Q magazine|year=2000|url=http://www.followmearound.com/presscuttings.php?year=2000&cutting=89|title=Q Magazine – October 2000 – By Danny Eccleston|accessdate=2008-07-17[/tpl] Yorke's activism in support of fair trade practices, with an anti-WTO and anti-globalisation stance, garnered significant attention in the early 2000s.[tpl]cite news | first=Thom | last=Yorke | coauthors= | title=Losing the faith | date=8 September 2003 | publisher=TheGuardian.com | url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/wto/article/0,2763,1035805,00.html | work =The Guardian | pages = | accessdate = 2007-04-15 | language = | location=London[/tpl] Yorke had previously referenced maquiladoras in the title of a Radiohead B-side in 1995, and decried the International Monetary Fund in 1997's "Electioneering".

Yorke is also notable as a political activist on behalf of human rights, environmentalist and anti-war causes including Jubilee 2000, Amnesty International and CND, the Green Party of England and Wales, and Friends of the Earth's Big Ask campaign."Thom Yorke and 'The Big Ask'", Friends of the Earth.

He has said the music industry's use of air transport is dangerous and unsustainable, and that he would consider not touring if new carbon emissions standards do not force the situation to improve.[tpl]cite news|accessdate=2008-07-17|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1924075,00.html|title=Rock tours damaging environment, says Radiohead singer|publisher=The Guardian|first=David|last=Adam|date=17 October 2006|location=London[/tpl] Radiohead commissioned a study by the group Best Foot Forward which the band claims helped them choose venues and transport methods that will greatly reduce the carbon expended on their 2008 tour.
