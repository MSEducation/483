He was frequently the tag team partner of Jerry Lawler.

==Professional wrestling career==

White entered the professional wrestling business after meeting and training with Johnny Thunder. Thunder later introduced him to Chicago promoter Fred Kohler's booker. White's first match was in 1959 against Johnny Kace. Because he was only 17 at the time, his father had to sign a parental consent form to allow him to wrestle. Afterward, White also began wrestling for Nick Gulas in Nashville on the weekends, while he continued to attend high school during the week.
After graduating high school, White became a full-time wrestler, teaming with Ron Wright under manager Ron Bass. He wrestled across the southern United States, even competed as The Medic under a mask. In 1970, he began wrestling in Alabama, teaming with Roy Klein as The Green Shadows. After the team lost their masks, they became known as Woodrow and Roy Bass, with Sam Bass as their manager. As a singles wrestler in 1972, he also used the ring name The Green Shadow, with Dr. Ken Ramey as his manager.
White also frequently teamed with Jerry Lawler. In the Gulf Coast Championship Wrestling promotion, the team won the NWA Tennessee Tag Team Championship no later than November 1972, but lost it to Tommy Gilbert and Bearcat Brown on December 8 of that year.[tpl]cite book | author=Royal Duncan and Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | year=2006|edition=4th | isbn=0-9698161-5-4 [/tpl] In 1973, the team won the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship.[tpl]cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/lawler.html|title=Jerry Lawler|publisher=SLAM!

He also was commissioner for Southern Championship Wrestling, a southeastern Kentucky promotion, in his last couple of years before his death.

==Personal life==

White played American football in High School. But he could not tell his football coach that he was a wrestler because he would have had to quit the team.
After retiring from professional wrestling, White became an avid camper and fisher. In 1987, he was employed as the transportation for alcohol and drug patients to rehabilitation centers. He also worked as the general manager of Alono, Inc., which was an organization that treated people for drug and alcohol abuse.
White had a wife, Barbara, and two sons, Jeff and Tommy. White died at the age of 67 on January 7, 2010 of cancer.
