[[Tangwai movement]]

CATEGORIES: Taiwanese localization movement, Mandarin words and phrases

The Tangwai movement ([tpl]zh|黨外[/tpl]; pinyin: dăngwài; literally, "outside the party") was a political movement in the Republic of China (Taiwan) in the mid-1970s and early 1980s. Although the Kuomintang had allowed contested elections for a small number of seats in Legislative Yuan, opposition parties were still forbidden. As a result, many opponents of the Kuomintang, officially classified as independents, ran and were elected as members outside the party. Because the majority of seats in the Legislative Yuan were held by delegates elected in 1947, pending the promised retaking of mainland China, the Tangwai movement had no possibility of seizing power, but they were able to use the legislature as a forum for debating the ruling Kuomintang. However, Tangwai members including Shih Ming-teh and Lin Yi-hsiung were often harassed or imprisoned by the government, especially in the wake of the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident.
The members of the Tangwai movement formed the Democratic Progressive Party in 1986. Although still illegal, the KMT did not take action against the DPP and the party was legalized in 1991. Many current politicians in Taiwan, most notably former President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu, were active in the Tangwai movement.
