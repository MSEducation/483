==History==

After a failed first album, Desiertos (1989), they released Doble Opuesto (1990), which appears as the official first album of the band. Singles like "Desiertos," "Tejedores de Ilusión," and "Prisioneros de la Piel" made them stars in Chile, Argentina and Mexico[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl], especially after the release of La Ley, their second recording (1992). After Bobe's death in 1994, La Ley continued with a new guitarist, Pedro Frugone, and released two more albums; in 1995, the band released Invisible, the album was their international breakout record and provided to the band their best-selling studio album to date, it included the number ones "Dia Cero" (in which, the rhythm and the video was inspired by the Duran Duran's smash hit Come Undone) and "El Duelo".
Before the release of Vértigo, Rodrigo Aboitiz left the band, in the middle of the tour, bassist Luciano Rojas, left the band as well and together with the Aboitiz formed a new group named "Saiko."
Their music became more rock and less experimental, and the musicians dropped their dark image. Not all of their fans were on board with the new style, but the last La Ley albums, Uno (2000) and Libertad (2003), consolidated the band as one of the most important in Latin America, earning it a Latin Grammy award for each of the two albums.
La Ley also performed on MTV Unplugged in 2001, and released an album of the performance, which went on to win a Grammy award. In 2004, they released a greatest hits compilation (featuring three new songs: Mírate, Bienvenido al Anochecer, and Histeria) titled Historias e Histeria.
In 2005 Rodrigo Aboitiz and Luciano Rojas performed with the band at the Viña del Mar International Song Festival (Spanish: Festival Internacional de la Canción de Viña del Mar) and after a tour around Latin America, the band said goodbye in Buenos Aires on September 29, to work in their personal projects, leaving open the possibility for a return in the future.
