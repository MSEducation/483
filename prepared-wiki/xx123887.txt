Ruth Amelia Ocumárez Apataño (born 1983 in Santo Domingo) is a Dominican beauty pageant titleholder, actress and model. 
Born and raised in Santo Domingo, Ocumárez became a celebrity in her nation by becoming the first woman of predominantly African heritage to represent the Dominican Republic at Miss Universe.  Due to her dark complexion and personality, she was given the nickname "La Diosa de Ébano" (The Ebony Goddess) by the Dominican public and press.El Anecdotario
At the Miss Universe 2002 pageant, held in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Ocumárez was predicted by many to be place as a semifinalist.  She did not place, causing many internet users and bloggers to coin the term the Ruth Ocumárez Award to signify a pageant contestant who seems guaranteed to be a finalist, but does not make the list at the end.El Anecdotario
After her reign was over, Ocumárez entered the world of modeling and appeared in many Dominican, European, and Puerto Rican periodicals. She also branched out into acting, starring in the Dominican film Perico Ripiao. Besides her work in film, Ocumárez also has experience as a television hostess on Puerto Rican television.  
It was reported in 2007 that Ocumárez had become engaged to flamboyant entertainment personality Sixto Nolasco. Nolasco, who was interviewed by journalist Carmen Jovet declared that he was   "tired of being gay," and that he intends to start a family with his new wife. As of January 2008, there has been no date for the proposed nuptials.Quiero Morir al lado de una Mujer from Primera Hora dated July 21, 2007
