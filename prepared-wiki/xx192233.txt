Hildoceras is a genus of ammonite form the upper Lower Jurassic in the family Hildoceratidae. The shells are characterized by a narrow discoidal evolute shape, keeled venter,  concave ribs along the outer flanks, and a shallow spiral goove running along smooth inner flanks.  Whorls slightly overlap, cross sections are compressed.  The ventral keel is bordered on either side by a shallow groove.thumb|left|Recreation of Hildoceras
The genus was named by Alpheus Hyatt after Saint Hilda in 1876, and fossils have been found in Europe and Japan.
