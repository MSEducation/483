"Hiawatha (A Summer Idyl)" is a popular song written by Neil Moret (Charles N. Daniels) in 1901. James O'Dea added lyrics in 1903 and the music was re-subtitled "(His Song to Minnehaha)".
"Hiawatha" was extremely popular when released, and sold half a million copies.Jasen, Tin Pan Alley, p. 102: "In 1901, Daniels published his Indian song, 'Hiawatha,' which became a success after Daniels prevailed upon Sousa to perform and record it (Victor 2443). The following year, when Jerome Remick purchased Whitney Warner of Detroit, he paid Daniels $10,000 for his firm so that Remick could have 'Hiawatha.' It was the highest sum yet paid for a song."Sanjek, American Popular Music and Its Business, p. 414. "500,000". It has been recorded numerous times and started a decade long fad for "Indian" songs.Jasen, Tin Pan Alley, p. 102: "The following year, James O'Dea added words to 'Hiawatha,' and sales zoomed again when it became a song. Thus started the trend of Indian songs, which were extremely popular during the first decade of the twentieth century."
"Hiawatha" was named for Hiawatha, Kansas, not for Longfellow's poem.Parlor Songs 1800-1920. "The song was originally written around 1900 by Moret as an instrumental work as a tribute to a town in Kansas (Hiawatha, Kansas) where his sweetheart lived."
