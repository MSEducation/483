[[HyperCam]]

CATEGORIES: Screencasting software

HyperCam is a screencasting program made and created by Hyperionics (hyperionics.com). It captures the action from a Microsoft Windows screen and saves it to an AVI (Audio Video Interleaved) or WMV (Windows Media Video) or ASF (Advanced Systems Format) movie file. HyperCam will also record all sound output, and sound from the system microphone can also be recorded.
HyperCam is primarily intended for creating software presentations, tutorials, demonstrations, walkthroughs, and other various tasks the user wants to demonstrate. The latest versions also capture overlay video and can re-record movies and video clips (e.g. recording videos playing in Windows Media Player, RealVideo, QuickTime, etc.). Beginning with version 3.0, HyperCam also includes a built-in editor for trimming and merging captured AVI, WMV, ASF files.
The unregistered versions of HyperCam 2 and HyperCam 3 apply a digital watermark to the upper-left corner of each recorded file and will ask the user to register on every startup. Base registration, which costs $39.95, will eliminate this watermark.
Hyperionics has now made HyperCam 2 a permanent free download, saying that it now has a free license for "worldwide use".
