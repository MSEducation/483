==Reception==

Philip Sherburne from Pitchfork Media compared the album to Thom Yorke's The Eraser and wrote, "At least you can hear Trentemøller working out the equation fantastical affect and floor-friendly functionalism at every step; obviously as influenced by film music and prog excess as he is the throbbing throng, he's married Balearic eclecticism to Scandinavian melancholy in a way that's often impressive and occasionally breathtaking. At the very least, it's consistently beautiful-- or at least pretty-- even when it fails to be properly engrossing". Resident Advisor—an online magazine with a focus on electronic music—named The Last Resort as the 5th best album of 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?782|title=RA Poll: Top 5 albums of 2006|publisher=Resident Advisor|date=2006-12-18|accessdate=2009-10-04[/tpl] They also named it the 28th best album of the decade.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1144|title=Top 100 albums of the '00s|date=25 January 2010|publisher=Resident Advisor|accessdate=19 March 2010[/tpl] The Danish newspaper Politiken gave the album 5 stars (out of 6), and named it the second best Danish album of 2006, dubbing him "the hero of techno".[tpl]cite web|last=Jensen|first=Erik|title=Politikens anmeldere kårer årets bedste album|url=http://ibyen.dk/musik/article215306.ece|date=19 December 2006|publisher=Politiken|accessdate=5 June 2010|language=Danish[/tpl]
