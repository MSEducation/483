Villagers are an Irish indie folk band from Dublin, formed in 2008. The band consists of Conor O'Brien, Tommy McLaughlin, Danny Snow, James Byrne and Cormac Curran.
The band came to prominence in 2010 with the release of their debut album, Becoming a Jackal. Released to critical acclaim, the album was subsequently nominated for both the Mercury Prize and the Choice Music Prize. The band's second studio album, {Awayland} was released in 2013, and, like its predecessor, was also nominated for the Mercury Prize.
Villagers have performed at several music festivals and toured with Grizzly Bear, Tracy Chapman, Bell X1, Tindersticks and Elbow.

==History==

Conor O'Brien formed Villagers after the break-up of his previous band The Immediate. The very next day, O'Brien wrote the first song after waking up with a hangover. O'Brien's time as a guitarist in Cathy Davey's band was also critical to the development of his style as he had never before performed alongside anyone outside of The Immediate. Villagers gave their first live performance as a support act with The Chapters at a show in Whelan's in November 2008.[tpl]cite web|author=Niall Byrne|url=http://www.state.ie/2009/02/features/interview-villagers/|title=Interview: Villagers|date=6 February 2009|accessdate=7 January 2010|work=State[/tpl] At that point the band had previously only rehearsed together on two occasions. They had only seven songs, written by O'Brien and passed on to the rest of the band to learn.
Villagers performed on the seventh series of RTÉ Two's Other Voices television programme in 2009.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/othervoices/villagers.html|title=Other Voices|accessdate=7 January 2010|work=Other Voices[/tpl] The band's debut EP, titled Hollow Kind, was released in February 2009. It contained four tracks, all of which were written and performed by O'Brien. The EP brought comparisons with Bright Eyes and Sparklehorse. Villagers then went on tour.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/news/5104454.html|title=Conor O'Brien brings Villagers on tour|date=16 December 2008|accessdate=7 January 2010|work=Hot Press[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/news/5132452.html|title=Villagers extend Irish tour|date=5 January 2009|accessdate=7 January 2010|work=Hot Press[/tpl] They were a support act for Neil Young and toured across Europe with Tracy Chapman.

Having only just won, he’s still not sure what significance it will have for his musical career. “Like I was saying before about knowing when a song is good, this is a really good time for me in terms of songwriting. I’ve already got six songs written for the next album and am really excited about it.” He mentions attending a recent show by an excellent new band called Villagers. “It was so good it just opened up so much for me. I know I’ve got to push myself now. Winning the Choice prize is great – but there’s a lot more to do.”[/tpl]
