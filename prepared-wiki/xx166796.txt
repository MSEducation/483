Interstate 24 (I-24) runs from Paducah to Oak Grove in the U.S. state of Kentucky.

==Route description==

I-24 crosses into Kentucky on a bridge over the Ohio River, passing to the west of the city of Paducah and intersecting US 60, US 45, and US 62. The freeway then passes near the communities of Woodlawn-Oakdale and Reidland, and interchanges with US 68. East of there, I-24 runs concurrently with I-69, intersecting US 62 and crossing the Tennessee River and the Cumberland River. The roadway travels along the north shore of the Cumberland River as I-69 splits off to the east just north of Mineral Mound State Park. I-24 continues east, away from the river, through farmland for several miles, passing well south of Hopkinsville. Near the Tennessee border, I-24 passes north of Fort Campbell before crossing into Tennessee.[tpl]google maps|url=https://maps.google.com/?ll=36.85545,-88.074646&spn=1.20432,2.452698&t=h&z=9|title=Interstate 24 in Kentucky|accessdate=December 22, 2013[/tpl]
