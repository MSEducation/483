==Club career==

===Liverpool===

Traoré started his career at home club Laval before moving on to Liverpool.
He spent the 2003–04 season, Houllier's last at the club, in the reserve team, of which he was captain, and almost left Liverpool for their Merseyside neighbours Everton on the 2004 transfer deadline day but remained at Liverpool. He scored his first and what turned out to be only Liverpool goal during this season, in the UEFA Cup against FC Steaua Bucureşti.
Traoré's career appeared to have been revitalised by Rafael Benítez. While the defender had appeared poor positionally, and seemed reluctant to attack, particularly during the 2004–05 season, he showed more willingness to support the left winger, as well as improving his positional play.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2010[/tpl]
Traoré scored an own-goal in the third round of the 2004–05 FA Cup against then Championship side Burnley, as he attempted a turn and drag-back within his own six-yard box. It turned out to be the only goal of the game and handed Burnley a 1–0 victory over their Premiership opponents.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2005/jan/19/match.burnley |title=Traoré blunder sinks Liverpool |last=Fifield |first=Dominic |newspaper=The Guardian |date=19 January 2005 |accessdate=28 September 2010 |location=London[/tpl]
Traoré remained a regular at Liverpool, and eventually made the starting line-up as Liverpool qualified for the Champions League Final that season, against AC Milan.

In the 2005–06 season, Traoré found his first team appearances limited, with John Arne Riise and Stephen Warnock also starting regularly at left back. It was to be his last season with Liverpool, and, although he had played some part in Liverpool's pre-season in 2006, he was sold to Charlton Athletic for £2 million on 8 August 2006.Charlton snap up Faye and Traore BBC News

===Charlton===

Traoré was sent off on his Addicks debut on 19 August, after receiving two yellow cards, the latter of which was for preventing a free kick being taken. This was the fifth time in eight seasons a Charlton player had been sent off on the first game of the season. On 16 December he conceded a penalty against Liverpool, his former club, for a tackle on Jermaine Pennant. He was soon deemed surplus to requirements at Charlton. After only half a season at the Valley, Traoré was allowed to leave the club by new manager Alan Pardew, joining Portsmouth.[tpl]cite news|title=Traore seals Pompey switch|url=http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=440922&CPID=8&clid=47&lid=2&title=Traore+seals+Pompey+switch | work=Sky Sports[/tpl]
