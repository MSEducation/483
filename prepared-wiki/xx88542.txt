Hydrogen peroxide - urea is a solid composed of equal amounts of hydrogen peroxide and urea.  This compound is a white crystalline solid, which dissolves in water to give free hydrogen peroxide. Often called carbamide peroxide in the dental applications, it is used as a source of hydrogen peroxide for bleaching, disinfection, and oxidation.

==Structure, properties, production==

Akin to water of crystallization, hydrogen peroxide cocrystallizes with urea with the stoichiometry of 1:1.  The compound is simply produced (on a scale of several hundred tonnes a year) by the dissolution of urea in excess concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution, followed by crystallization.[tpl]Ullmann | title = Peroxo Compounds, Inorganic | author =  Harald Jakob, Stefan Leininger, Thomas Lehmann, Sylvia Jacobi, Sven Gutewort | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a19_177.pub2[/tpl] The laboratory synthesis is analogous.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Yu | first1 = Lei | last2 = Meng | first2 = Bo | last3 = Huang | first3 = Xian | title = Urea-Hydrogen Peroxide Complex: A Selective Oxidant in the Synthesis of 2-Phenylselenyl-1,3-butadienes | journal = Synthetic Communications | volume = 38 | pages = 3142 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1080/00397910802109224 | issue = 18[/tpl] Upon dissolving in various solvents, this 1:1 complex dissociates back to urea and hydrogen peroxide.  So just like hydrogen peroxide, the adduct is an oxidizer. the solubility of commercial samples varies from 0.05 g/mLSigma-Aldrich specification sheet to more than 0.6 g/mL.Chemicalland data sheet The solid state structure of this adduct at the right has been determined by neutron diffraction.[tpl]Cite journal | author1 = C.J.

==Applications==

===Disinfectant and bleaching agent===

Hydrogen peroxide - urea is mainly used as a disinfecting and bleaching agent in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. As a drug, this compound is used in some preparations for the whitening of teeth.Toothwhitening from the UMD of New Jersey website It is also used to relieve minor inflammation of gums, oral mucosal surfaces and lips including canker sores and dental irritation,Center for Integrative Medicine: Carbamide Peroxide from the University of Maryland Medical Center website and to emulsify and disperse ear wax.
In tooth bleaching, the hydrogen peroxide produced acts to oxidise interprismatic extrinsic staining within tooth enamel. There are several methods of applying the peroxide gel to the tooth ranging from night-guard application at home to in-surgery application. The bleaching obtained is proportional to the length of time the peroxide is applied to the tooth, and the concentration used. Concentrations used for tooth whitening purposes range between 10% and 44%. Higher concentrations carry a higher risk of side effects such as chemical burns. 10% is widely regarded as safe.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]

===Reagent in organic synthesis===

In the laboratory, it is used as a more easily handled replacement for hydrogen peroxide.[tpl]cite journal | last1 = Varma | first1 = Rajender S. | last2 = Naicker | first2 = Kannan P. | title = The Urea−Hydrogen Peroxide Complex:  Solid-State Oxidative Protocols for Hydroxylated Aldehydes and Ketones (Dakin Reaction), Nitriles, Sulfides, and Nitrogen Heterocycles | journal = Organic Letters | volume = 1 | pages = 189 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1021/ol990522n | issue = 2[/tpl]Harry Heaney, Francesca Cardona, Andrea Goti, "Hydrogen Peroxide–Urea" Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis 2008.

==Safety==

As an oxidizer, this compound is a skin, eye and respiratory irritant. At higher concentrations, it is corrosive and may cause burns if not used properly. If too much gel is used and left in contact with skin or gums, there is a risk of white chemical burns called blanching.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
