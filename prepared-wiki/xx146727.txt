An attorney for the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] approved of the Judge's decision in the matter, stating: "They certainly do not have the right to seize everything and to fish around. There seems to be this thought that things that are contained on a computer aren't subject to the same protections. I think the law is catching up."<ref name="brooke" />  [[Helena Kobrin|Helena K. Kobrin]] a Church of Scientology attorney with the firm [[Moxon & Kobrin]], defended the seizures of the computers, saying after the judge's decision: "The decision yesterday was a very sad day for intellectual property owners and a very sad day for the Internet."<ref name="brooke" />
In a series of cases, Scientology (through subsidiary Bridge Publications) sued FACTNet for claimed copyright violations. In 1998, federal judge John Kane denied Scientology's request for summary judgment because FACTNet challenged Scientology's ownership of the copyrights of the documents.[tpl]cite web |url = http://news.com.com/2100-1023-217696.html |title = Scientology loses copyright round |accessdate = 2007-08-03 |last = Borland |first = John|date = 1998-11-09|work = CNET|publisher = |archiveurl=http://archive.is/fMdt|archivedate=2012-07-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url = http://archive.salon.com/21st/log/1998/11/10log.html |title = Scientologists lose a round in copyright fight |accessdate = 2007-08-06 |date = 1998-11-10|work = Salon|publisher = [/tpl] A settlement was later reached in 1999, whose terms were that if FACTNet is ever found guilty of violations of church copyrights, they are permanently enjoined to pay the church $1 million.[tpl]cite web |url = http://news.com.com/Scientologists+settle+legal+battle/2100-1023_3-223683.html?tag=item |title = Scientologists settle legal battle |accessdate = 2007-08-03 |last = Macavinta |first = Courtney|date = 1999-03-30|work = CNET|publisher =|archiveurl=http://archive.is/sFVi|archivedate=2012-07-13[/tpl]
FACTNet has maintained a relatively low news profile since 1999, occasionally cited for speaking out against topics they consider important.  The 2000 film Battlefield Earth starring John Travolta stirred up controversy because it was based on a book by L. R. Hubbard, the founder of the Church of Scientology, and Travolta was a well-known Scientologist.[tpl]cite news  | last =Staff |   title =The Battle for "Earth"  | work =Daily News of Los Angeles  |    date = 2000-05-12 [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4023865,00.html |title = Cult classic |accessdate = 2007-08-04 |last = Campbell |first = Duncan |date = 2000-05-31|work = Guardian Unlimited|publisher = [/tpl]  The Guardian reported on FACTnet's claims that the film was a proselytism piece for Scientology, noting: "FACTnet suggested that subliminal messages had been cunningly inserted by Scientologists to win over new converts to join the church."  The makers of the film asserted that it had nothing to do with the Church of Scientology, but The New York Times reported on FACTnet's assertions that: "..the film was secretly financed by Scientology, and that Scientology plans recruiting efforts to coincide with the movie's release."[tpl]cite news  | last =Lyman |   title =Film Dogged by Links To Scientology Founder | work =The New York Times |   publisher =The New York Times Company | date =2000-05-11 | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E3DC1F38F932A25756C0A9669C8B63  | accessdate = 2007-12-03 [/tpl]  Sociology professor James Richardson did not agree with FACTnet's claims, stating: "I seriously doubt that someone is going to go out and join Scientology just because they see this movie."  In 2002, after Lawrence Wollersheim won an USD$8.7 million judgement against the Church of Scientology, FACTnet posted a statement from him on the site, quoting: "The cult that vowed it would never pay me one thin dime has now paid over 86 million thin dimes."[tpl]cite news  | last =Leiby | first =Richard |  title =Ex-Scientologist Collects $8.7 Million In 22-Year-Old Case | work =The Washington Post | pages =Page A03 |  publisher =The Washington Post Company | date =2002-05-10 | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A63143-2002May9?language=printer | accessdate = 2007-11-01 [/tpl]  FACTNet spoke out in support of an episode of the TV show South Park, awarding their staff the "FACTNet Person(s) of the Year for 2005" for the satirical episode on Scientology, "Trapped in the Closet".[tpl]cite news  | last = Staff |   title = FACTNet.org Names South Park TV Show Staff FACTNet Person(s) of the Year for 2005 for their Recent Scientology Tom Cruise John Travolta Episode | work = Fight Against Coercive Tactics Network |   publisher = F.A.C.T.Net, Inc. | date = November 2005 newsletter, November 20, 2005 | url = http://www.factnet.org/letters/FACTNewsNovember2005SouthPark.html  | accessdate = 2007-11-01 [/tpl]  In 2006, FACTnet director Wollersheim was consulted for the 48 Hours story on the death of Scientologist Elli Perkins, "Scientology - A Question of Faith."[tpl]cite news  | last =Staff |   title =Scientology - A Question of Faith: Did A Mother's Faith Contribute To Her Murder? | work =48 Hours |   publisher =CBS News | date =2006-10-28 | url =http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/25/48hours/main2124568_page3.shtml | accessdate = 2007-11-01[/tpl]  Wollersheim was quoted in the piece, stating: "Scientology. They are the worst example of mind control in a religious setting that has ever existed". The program also noted that the Church of Scientology characterizes him as a "liar and a fraud," and asserts that most of its members live happy and fulfilled lives.

Legal cases involving the organization and the Religious Technology Center are cited in analysis of fair use law.  The book Internet and Online Law noted that "reproduction in computer format of plaintiff's entire copyrighted texts for defendants' private use and study falls well within the fair use exception."[ref]
