The Bofors 12 cm M. 14 was a howitzer used by the Netherlands in World War II as the Lichte Houwitze 12 cm L 14. Captured guns were given a German designation after the Battle of the Netherlands as the 12 cm leFH 373(h) although it is not certain that they were actually used by German forces.
It was purchased from Sweden before World War I by the Netherlands. Forty-eight were still in service when the Germans attacked on 10 May 1940. Norway also purchased four, and called them the 12 cm felthaubits M/15.
