==YAWP==

The Young Artists and Writers Project (or YAWP, formerly the Young American Writers Project) created by Stony Brook Southampton's MFA in Creative Writing and Literature Program, is dedicated to mentoring middle and high school students in the development of creative expression and critical thinking through writing. The YAWP curriculum sends professional writers and writing teachers into Long Island schools with a variety of innovative, inter-disciplinary writing workshops, including Playwriting, Screenwriting, Poetry, Personal Essay, Fiction, and Visual Arts. YAWP Programs are offered throughout the school year, and can be custom designed to fit the needs of an individual school. They can be offered in "push-in" format, as enrichment to Creative Writing, English, Theatre or other academic classes, as extra-curricular programs or in retreat format.  YAWP programs can be particularly effective for at-risk students, or for those who find writing and communications skills challenging in the traditional academic environment.http://www.stonybrook.edu/southampton/mfa/yawp/index.html

==SoMAS==

The SUNY School of Marine and Atmospheric Science also operates on the Southampton campus. The primary focus of the SoMAS faculty and students is on fundamental research designed to increase understanding of the processes that characterize the coastal ocean and the atmosphere. But the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences is also committed to the applying research to solve problems that result from society's uses and misuses of the environment. This location allows students and faculty to explore and study a variety of habitats ranging from the open ocean to the largest metropolitan area in the United States, and to tap into resources at the nearby National Weather Service, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the Laboratory of Cold Spring Habor. http://www.somas.stonybrook.edu/about/index.html

==History==

===Southampton College, Long Island University===

Southampton College was founded in 1963 by Long Island University. It had a separate stop on the Long Island Rail Road until 1998 when the station was dismantled because it was lightly used.
From 1993, Robert F.X. Sillerman served as the Chancellor, replacing Angier Biddle Duke, ambassador to Spain under Lyndon Johnson. Sillerman took the job on two conditions: that the college scrap ill-defined liberal-arts programs and focus on marine science and creative writing. And that he lead publicity - he named Kermit the Frog as the 1996 commencement speaker: 31 newspapers picked up the story, a free marketing bonanza that raised the college's profile and drew hundreds of new admissions.
The refocusing on the marine science curriculum garnered the campus several accolades, including being named in 1998 as the Cousteau Society's sole North American Affiliate.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.southampton.liunet.edu/news/pressrel/pr98/cousteau.htm | title=Cousteau Society To Name Southampton College its North American Affiliate in Ceremonies This Sunday in La Rochelle, France  | publisher= Southampton College | date=5 June 1998 | first= | last= | accessdate = [/tpl] In the course of the campus's tenure under Long Island University, it produced 34 Fulbright scholars, most of which hailed from the Marine Science program. 
After many years of fiscal mismanagement, the University announced a multi-million dollar capital campaign, launched a new interdisciplinary CORE curriculum and the construction of a new library (almost completed) to re-vamp the campus. After one year of a 10-year plan however, Long Island University officials ceased all plans and Long Island University decided to effectively close the campus. This forced most students to either move to University's Nassau County location, C.W. Post Campus or transfer elsewhere.
Although protests and advocacy including a rally by the non-profit Save The College at Southampton and the student-led organization The Orphans of L.I.U. (Long Island University) made numerous headlines with their actions, Undergraduate Programs ceased and all but a few campus buildings were shuttered by the end of Summer 2005.
When Long Island University announced its plans to close the campus, in 2005 the Shinnecock Indian Nation filed a suit seeking return of [tpl]convert|3500|acre|km2[/tpl] including both the campus and the golf club. There were local concerns that either the land would be taken over by the Shinnecocks for a casino, or that the land would be used for a housing development in the Hamptons.
The undergraduate Marine Biology department was moved to the control of State University of New York at Stony Brook  in summer 2005, and from the fall 2005 SUNY began offering an undergraduate marine sciences program, with teaching and research facilities at the campus leased from LIU.

On March 24, 2006 the State University of New York (SUNY) announced a final agreement for the purchase of the [tpl]convert|81|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] Southampton College property from Long Island University (LIU). SUNY paid US $35 million for the [tpl]convert|84|acre|m2|sing=on[/tpl] campus and its waterfront facility for its famed Marine Biology department, as well as the NPR affiliated WLIU FM 88.3 radio station.[tpl]cite news | url=http://commcgi.cc.stonybrook.edu/artman/publish/article_1215.shtml | title=Stony Brook University Completes Purchase of Former Southampton College Property| publisher= Stony Brook University | date=4 October 2006 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2007-07-01[/tpl]  In the agreement to take over WLIU is to continue its LIU affiliation and move from its broadcasting studios in Chancellors Hall by April 2010 to another location on Hill Street in Southampton.  The station has an agreement to have its broadcast tower on the campus through 2024.LIU Triumphant - Dan's Papers - August 17, 2007
Under the new ownership of Stony Brook University starting with a class of 200 in August 2007, the campus featured an innovative curriculum devoted to issues of sustainability and the environment. Southampton’s interdisciplinary academic programs focused on issues of ecological sustainability, with undergraduate majors in Environmental Studies, Marine Sciences, Marine Vertebrate Biology, Ecosystems and Human Impact, Environmental Design, Policy and Planning and Sustainability Studies. A minor in Business Management with a focus on environmental sustainability was also offered through Stony Brook University's College of Business, and a five-year Fast Track BA/BS-MBA program is also offered in partnership with the College of Business.  
As one of the nation's first, and New York's only, college solely dedicated to sustainability and a fully "green" campus, students also learned sustainability concepts in their daily lives on campus.  The college's unique, cutting-edge programs attracted students from all over the nation and enrollment for Fall 2010 saw a 54% increase, with a total of 800 students registered.  The college was on track to soon reach its full capacity of over 2,000 students and was thriving. In April 2010, the new president of Stony Brook University abruptly announced his decision to shut down the branch, due to major budget cuts received from the New York state and the need for better targeting of funds. The academica programs and students were relocated to the main campus.
In April 2010, Stony Brook's new president, Samuel Stanley, announced the undergraduate component of SB-Southampton was being eliminated altogether. The decision was made without consultation with anyone affiliated with the Southampton college. The undergraduate population staged letter campaigns to raise community awareness and protest of the decision. President Stanley came to the Southampton campus shortly after the decision was announced, purportedly to stage a Q&A with the student body in the Avram Theatre on-campus. The Q&A consisted mainly of Stanley acting as if there was nothing he could do about it and nothing the students could do to stop it.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
Six undergraduate students and a non-profit community group filed a lawsuit in NY State Supreme Court to block the closure of the college.  The lawsuit was filed against Stony Brook and Stanley, claiming the decision to close the campus was procedurally illegal. On August 30, 2010, the judge decided in the students' favor.  The Court ruled that the university violated regulations and improperly closed the campus. The students won the lawsuit, but unable to contest financially with further litigation,[tpl]vague|date=May 2013[/tpl] agreed to a small settlement: they were permitted to complete their studies on-campus but not live there, and Stanley visited each student's home to personally apologize.
