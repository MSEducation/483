Insulin is a peptide hormone, produced by beta cells in the liver, and is central to regulating carbohydrate and fat metabolism in the body. It causes cells in the skeletal muscles, and fat tissue to absorb glucose from the blood.
Insulin is a very old protein that may have originated more than one billion years ago. The molecular origins of insulin go at least as far back as the simplest unicellular eukaryotes.Le Roith, D.; Shiloach, J.; Heffron, R.; Rubinovitz, C.; Tanenbaum, R. and Roth, J. (1985), Insulin-related material in microbes: similarities and differences from mammalian insulins. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol., 63, 839-849. Apart from animals, insulin-like proteins are also known to exist in Fungi and Protista kingdoms.Alzira Martins Ferreira de Souza, Jorge A. López (2004). Insulin or insulin-like studies on unicellular organisms: a review. Braz. arch. biol. technol. vol.47 no.6 Curitiba Nov. 2004. http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1516-89132004000600017  http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1516-89132004000600017
Insulin stops the use of fat as an energy source by inhibiting the release of glucagon. Except in the presence of the metabolic disorder diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome, insulin is provided within the body in a constant proportion to remove excess glucose from the blood, which otherwise would be toxic. When blood glucose levels fall below a certain level, the body begins to use stored sugar as an energy source through glycogenolysis, which breaks down the glycogen stored in the liver and muscles into glucose, which can then be utilized as an energy source. As a central metabolic control mechanism, its status is also used as a control signal to other body systems (such as amino acid uptake by body cells). In addition, it has several other anabolic effects throughout the body.
When control of insulin levels fails, diabetes mellitus can result. As a consequence, insulin is used medically to treat some forms of diabetes mellitus. Patients with type 1 diabetes depend on external insulin (most commonly injected subcutaneously) for their survival because the hormone is no longer produced internally.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000729 | title = Insulin Injection  | author = American Society of Health-System Pharmacists  | date = 2009-02-01 | work = PubMed Health | publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine | accessdate = 2012-10-12 [/tpl]  Patients with type 2 diabetes are often insulin resistant and, because of such resistance, may suffer from a "relative" insulin deficiency. Some patients with type 2 diabetes may eventually require insulin if other medications fail to control blood glucose levels adequately. Over 40% of those with Type 2 diabetes require insulin as part of their diabetes management plan.
The human insulin protein is composed of 51 amino acids, and has a molecular weight of 5808 Da. It is a dimer of an A-chain and a B-chain, which are linked together by disulfide bonds.
Insulin's name is derived from the Latin insula for "island". Insulin's structure varies slightly between species of animals. Insulin from animal sources differs somewhat in "strength" (in carbohydrate metabolism control effects) from that in humans because of those variations. Porcine insulin is especially close to the human version.

==Gene==

The preproinsulin precursor of insulin is encoded by the INS gene.[tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: INS insulin| url =http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=3630| accessdate = [/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author = Bell GI, Pictet RL, Rutter WJ, Cordell B, Tischer E, Goodman HM | title = Sequence of the human insulin gene | journal = Nature | volume = 284 | issue = 5751 | pages = 26–32 |date=March 1980 | pmid = 6243748 | doi = 10.1038/284026a0 | url =[/tpl]

===Alleles===

A variety of mutant alleles with changes in the coding region have been identified. A read-through gene, INS-IGF2, overlaps with this gene at the 5' region and with the IGF2 gene at the 3' region.

===Regulation===

Several regulatory sequences in the promoter region of the human insulin gene bind to transcription factors.  In general, the A-boxes bind to Pdx1 factors, E-boxes bind to NeuroD, C-boxes bind to MafA, and cAMP response elements to CREB. There are also silencers that inhibit transcription.

==Protein structure==

Within vertebrates, the amino acid sequence of insulin is strongly conserved. Bovine insulin differs from human in only three amino acid residues, and porcine insulin in one. Even insulin from some species of fish is similar enough to human to be clinically effective in humans. Insulin in some invertebrates is quite similar in sequence to human insulin, and has similar physiological effects. The strong homology seen in the insulin sequence of diverse species suggests that it has been conserved across much of animal evolutionary history. The C-peptide of proinsulin (discussed later), however, differs much more among species; it is also a hormone, but a secondary one.
The primary structure of bovine insulin was first determined by Frederick Sanger in 1951.[tpl]cite journal | author = Sanger F, Tuppy H | title = The amino-acid sequence in the phenylalanyl chain of insulin.

Insulin is produced and stored in the body as a hexamer (a unit of six insulin molecules), while the active form is the monomer. The hexamer is an inactive form with long-term stability, which serves as a way to keep the highly reactive insulin protected, yet readily available. The hexamer-monomer conversion is one of the central aspects of insulin formulations for injection. The hexamer is far more stable than the monomer, which is desirable for practical reasons; however, the monomer is a much faster-reacting drug because diffusion rate is inversely related to particle size. A fast-reacting drug means insulin injections do not have to precede mealtimes by hours, which in turn gives diabetics more flexibility in their daily schedules.[tpl]cite journal | author = Dunn MF | title = Zinc-ligand interactions modulate assembly and stability of the insulin hexamer -- a review | journal = Biometals | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 295–303 |date=August 2005 | pmid = 16158220 | doi = 10.1007/s10534-005-3685-y | url =  [/tpl] Insulin can aggregate and form fibrillar interdigitated beta-sheets.

==Synthesis, physiological effects, and degradation==

===Synthesis===

Insulin is produced in the pancreas and released when any of several stimuli are detected. These stimuli include ingested protein and glucose in the blood produced from digested food.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] Carbohydrates can be polymers of simple sugars or the simple sugars themselves. If the carbohydrates include glucose, then that glucose will be absorbed into the bloodstream and blood glucose level will begin to rise. In target cells, insulin initiates a signal transduction, which has the effect of increasing glucose uptake and storage. Finally, insulin is degraded, terminating the response.
In mammals, insulin is synthesized in the pancreas within the β-cells of the islets of Langerhans. One million to three million islets of Langerhans (pancreatic islets) form the endocrine part of the pancreas, which is primarily an exocrine gland. The endocrine portion accounts for only 2% of the total mass of the pancreas. Within the islets of Langerhans, beta cells constitute 65–80% of all the cells.
Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains, the A- and B- chains, linked together by disulfide bonds. It is however first synthesized as a single polypeptide called preproinsulin in pancreatic β-cells. Preproinsulin contains a 24-residue signal peptide which directs the nascent polypeptide chain to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER).  The signal peptide is cleaved as the polypeptide is translocated into lumen of the RER, forming proinsulin.[tpl]cite book |url= http://books.google.com/?id=ohgjG0qAvfgC&pg=PA66#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= Joslin's Diabetes Mellitus |author= C. Ronald Kahn et al. |edition=14th |pages= |publisher= Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |year=2005 |isbn=978-8493531836 [/tpl] In the RER the proinsulin folds into the correct conformation and 3 disulfide bonds are formed.  About 5–10 min after its assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum, proinsulin is transported to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) where immature granules are formed. Transport to the TGN may take about 30 min.
Proinsulin undergoes maturation into active insulin through the action of cellular endopeptidases known as prohormone convertases (PC1 and PC2), as well as the exoprotease carboxypeptidase E.[tpl]cite journal | author = Steiner DF, Oyer PE | title = The biosynthesis of insulin and a probable precursor of insulin by a human islet cell adenoma | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 473–480 |date=February 1967 | pmid = 16591494 | pmc = 335530 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.57.2.473| url = [/tpl]  The endopeptidases cleave at 2 positions, releasing a fragment called the C-peptide, and leaving 2 peptide chains, the B- and A- chains, linked by 2 disulfide bonds.  The cleavage sites are each located after a pair of basic residues (lysine-64 and arginine-65, and arginine-31 and -32). After cleavage of the C-peptide, these 2 pairs of basic residues are removed by the carboxypeptidase.[tpl]cite book |author=Thomas E Creighton |title=Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties |edition=2nd |pages=81–83 |year=1993 |publisher=W H Freeman and Company |isbn=0-7167-2317-4 [/tpl]  The C-peptide is the central portion of proinsulin, and the primary sequence of proinsulin goes in the order "B-C-A"  (the B and A chains were identified on the basis of mass and the C-peptide was discovered later).
The resulting mature insulin is packaged inside mature granules waiting for metabolic signals (such as leucine, arginine, glucose and mannose) and vagal nerve stimulation to be exocytosed from the cell into the circulation.[tpl]cite journal | author = Najjar S | title = Insulin Action: Molecular Basis of Diabetes | journal = Encyclopedia of Life Sciences | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | year=2001 | doi = 10.1038/npg.els.0001402 | isbn = 0470016175 [/tpl]
The endogenous production of insulin is regulated in several steps along the synthesis pathway:
Insulin and its related proteins have been shown to be produced inside the brain, and reduced levels of these proteins are linked to Alzheimer's disease.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-03/l-rdl030205.php | title = Researchers discover link between insulin and Alzheimer's | author = Gustin N | date = 2005-03-07 | work = EurekAlert! | publisher = American Association for the Advancement of Science | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2009-01-01[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = de la Monte SM, Wands JR | title = Review of insulin and insulin-like growth factor expression, signaling, and malfunction in the central nervous system: relevance to Alzheimer's disease | journal = J.

===Release===

Beta cells in the islets of Langerhans release insulin in two phases. The first phase release is rapidly triggered in response to increased blood glucose levels. The second phase is a sustained, slow release of newly formed vesicles triggered independently of sugar. The description of first phase release is as follows:
This is the primary mechanism for release of insulin. Other substances known to stimulate insulin release include the amino acids arginine and leucine, parasympathetic release of acetylcholine (via phospholipase C), sulfonylurea, cholecystokinin (CCK, via phospholipase C),[tpl]cite journal | author = Cawston EE, Miller LJ | title = Therapeutic potential for novel drugs targeting the type 1 cholecystokinin receptor | journal = Br. J. Pharmacol. | volume = 159 | issue = 5 | pages = 1009–21 |date=March 2010 | pmid = 19922535 | pmc = 2839260 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00489.x [/tpl] and the gastrointestinally derived incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP).
Release of insulin is strongly inhibited by the stress hormone norepinephrine (noradrenaline), which leads to increased blood glucose levels during stress.  It appears that release of catecholamines by the sympathetic nervous system has conflicting influences on insulin release by beta cells, because insulin release is inhibited by α2-adrenergic receptors[tpl]cite journal | author = Nakaki T, Nakadate T, Kato R | title = Alpha 2-adrenoceptors modulating insulin release from isolated pancreatic islets | journal = Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. | volume = 313 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–3 |date=August 1980 | pmid = 6252481 | doi = 10.1007/BF00498572 [/tpl] and stimulated by β2-adrenergic receptors.[tpl]cite journal | author = Layden BT, Durai V, Lowe WL Jr | title = G-Protein-Coupled Receptors, Pancreatic Islets, and Diabetes | journal = Nature Education | volume = 3 | issue = 9 | pages = 13 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/g-protein-coupled-receptors-pancreatic-islets-and-14257267  [/tpl] The net effect of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves and epinephrine from adrenal glands on insulin release is inhibition due to dominance of the α-adrenergic receptors.[tpl]cite book  | author = Sircar S | title = Medical Physiology | publisher = Thieme Publishing Group | location = Stuttgart | year = 2007 | pages = 537–538 | isbn = 3-13-144061-9  [/tpl]
When the glucose level comes down to the usual physiologic value, insulin release from the β-cells slows or stops. If blood glucose levels drop lower than this, especially to dangerously low levels, release of hyperglycemic hormones (most prominently glucagon from islet of Langerhans alpha cells) forces release of glucose into the blood from cellular stores, primarily liver cell stores of glycogen. By increasing blood glucose, the hyperglycemic hormones prevent or correct life-threatening hypoglycemia.
Evidence of impaired first-phase insulin release can be seen in the glucose tolerance test, demonstrated by a substantially elevated blood glucose level at 30 minutes, a marked drop by 60 minutes, and a steady climb back to baseline levels over the following hourly time points.

===Oscillations===

Even during the digestion, in general, one or two hours following a meal, insulin release from the pancreas is not continuous, but oscillates with a period of 3–6 minutes, changing from generating a blood insulin concentration more than about 800 pmol/l to less than 100 pmol/l.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hellman B, Gylfe E, Grapengiesser E, Dansk H, Salehi A |title=oscillations--clinically important rhythm. Antidiabetics should increase the pulsative component of the insulin release |language=Swedish |journal=Lakartidningen |volume=104 |issue=32–33 |pages=2236–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17822201 |doi=[/tpl] This is thought to avoid downregulation of insulin receptors in target cells, and to assist the liver in extracting insulin from the blood. This oscillation is important to consider when administering insulin-stimulating medication, since it is the oscillating blood concentration of insulin release, which should, ideally, be achieved, not a constant high concentration. This may be achieved by delivering insulin rhythmically to the portal vein or by islet cell transplantation to the liver. It is hoped that future insulin pumps will address this characteristic. (See also Pulsatile Insulin.)

===Blood content===

The blood content of insulin can be measured in international units, such as µIU/mL or in molar concentration, such as pmol/L, where 1 µIU/mL equals 6.945 pmol/L.A Dictionary of Units of Measurement By Russ Rowlett, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. June 13, 2001 A typical blood level between meals is 8–11 μIU/mL (57–79 pmol/L).[tpl]cite journal | author = Iwase H, Kobayashi M, Nakajima M, Takatori T | title = The ratio of insulin to C-peptide can be used to make a forensic diagnosis of exogenous insulin overdosage | journal = Forensic Sci. Int. | volume = 115 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 123–7 |date=January 2001 | pmid = 11056282 | doi = 10.1016/S0379-0738(00)00298-X [/tpl]

===Signal transduction===

Special transporter proteins in cell membranes allow glucose from the blood to enter a cell. These transporters are, indirectly, under blood insulin's control in certain body cell types (e.g., muscle cells). Low levels of circulating insulin, or its absence, will prevent glucose from entering those cells (e.g., in type 1 diabetes). More commonly, however, there is a decrease in the sensitivity of cells to insulin (e.g., the reduced insulin sensitivity characteristic of type 2 diabetes), resulting in decreased glucose absorption. In either case, there is 'cell starvation' and weight loss, sometimes extreme. In a few cases, there is a defect in the release of insulin from the pancreas. Either way, the effect is the same: elevated blood glucose levels.
Activation of insulin receptors leads to internal cellular mechanisms that directly affect glucose uptake by regulating the number and operation of protein molecules in the cell membrane that transport glucose into the cell. The genes that specify the proteins that make up the insulin receptor in cell membranes have been identified, and the structures of the interior, transmembrane section, and the extra-membrane section of receptor have been solved.
Two types of tissues are most strongly influenced by insulin, as far as the stimulation of glucose uptake is concerned: muscle cells (myocytes) and fat cells (adipocytes). The former are important because of their central role in movement, breathing, circulation, etc., and the latter because they accumulate excess food energy against future needs. Together, they account for about two-thirds of all cells in a typical human body.
Insulin binds to the extracellular portion of the alpha subunits of the insulin receptor.  This, in turn, causes a conformational change in the insulin receptor that activates the kinase domain residing on the intracellular portion of the beta subunits.  The activated kinase domain autophosphorylates tyrosine residues on the C-terminus of the receptor as well as tyrosine residues in the IRS-1 protein.
After the signal has been produced, termination of signaling is then needed.  As mentioned below in the section on degradation, endocytosis and degradation of the receptor bound to insulin is a main mechanism to end signaling.  In addition, signaling can be terminated by dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residues by tyrosine phosphatases.  Serine/Threonine kinases are also known to reduce the activity of insulin.  Finally, with insulin action being associated with the number of receptors on the plasma membrane, a decrease in the amount of receptors also leads to termination of insulin signaling.
The structure of the insulin–insulin receptor complex has been determined using the techniques of X-ray crystallography.[tpl]cite journal | author = Menting JG, Whittaker J, Margetts MB, Whittaker LJ, Kong GK-W, Smith BJ, Watson CJ, Žáková L, Kletvíková E, JJ, Chan SJ, Steiner DF, Dodson GG, Brzozowski AM, Weiss MA, Ward CW, Lawrence MC | title = How insulin engages its primary binding site on the insulin receptor | journal = Nature | year = 2013 | volume = 493 | issue = 7431 | pages = 241–245 | doi = 10.1038/nature11781  | pmid = 23302862 | pmc = 3793637| laysummary = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-01-10/australian-researchers-crack-insulin-mechanism/4458974 | laysource = Australian Broadcasting Commission  [/tpl]

===Physiological effects===

The actions of insulin on the global human metabolism level include:
The actions of insulin (indirect and direct) on cells include:
Insulin also influences other body functions, such as vascular compliance and cognition. Once insulin enters the human brain, it enhances learning and memory and benefits verbal memory in particular.[tpl]cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2004.04.003 |author = Benedict C, Hallschmid M, Hatke A, Schultes B, Fehm HL, Born J, Kern W. | title = Intranasal insulin improves memory in humans | journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume = 29 | issue = 10 | pages = 1326–34 |date=November 2004 | pmid = 15288712 [/tpl] Enhancing brain insulin signaling by means of intranasal insulin administration also enhances the acute thermoregulatory and glucoregulatory response to food intake, suggesting that central nervous insulin contributes to the control of whole-body energy homeostasis in humans.[tpl]cite journal |doi = 10.2337/db10-0329 |author = Benedict C, Brede S, Schiöth HB, Lehnert H, Schultes B, Born J, Hallschmid M. | title = Intranasal insulin enhances postprandial thermogenesis and lowers postprandial serum insulin levels in healthy men | journal = Diabetes | year = 2010 | pmid = 20876713 |volume = 60 |pages = 114–118 |issue = 1 |pmc = 3012162 |postscript =[tpl]nbsp[/tpl]ahead of print [/tpl] Insulin also has stimulatory effects on gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, thus favoring fertility.[tpl]cite journal | author = Comninos AN, Jayasena CN, Dhillo WS | title = The relationship between gut and adipose hormones, and reproduction | journal = Hum.

===Degradation===

Once an insulin molecule has docked onto the receptor and effected its action, it may be released back into the extracellular environment, or it may be degraded by the cell. The two primary sites for insulin clearance are the liver and the kidney. The liver clears most insulin during first-pass transit, whereas the kidney clears most of the insulin in systemic circulation. Degradation normally involves endocytosis of the insulin-receptor complex, followed by the action of insulin-degrading enzyme. An insulin molecule produced endogenously by the pancreatic beta cells is estimated to be degraded within about one hour after its initial release into circulation (insulin half-life ~ 4–6 minutes).[tpl]cite journal | author = Duckworth WC, Bennett RG, Hamel FG | title = Insulin degradation: progress and potential | journal = Endocr.

==Hypoglycemia==

Although other cells can use other fuels (most prominently fatty acids), neurons depend on glucose as a source of energy in the nonstarving human. They do not require insulin to absorb glucose, unlike muscle and adipose tissue, and they have very small internal stores of glycogen. Glycogen stored in liver cells (unlike glycogen stored in muscle cells) can be converted to glucose, and released into the blood, when glucose from digestion is low or absent, and the glycerol backbone in triglycerides can also be used to produce blood glucose.
Sufficient lack of glucose and scarcity of these sources of glucose can dramatically make itself manifest in the impaired functioning of the central nervous system: dizziness, speech problems, and even loss of consciousness. Low blood glucose level is known as hypoglycemia or, in cases producing unconsciousness, "hypoglycemic coma" (sometimes termed "insulin shock" from the most common causative agent). Endogenous causes of insulin excess (such as an insulinoma) are very rare, and the overwhelming majority of insulin excess-induced hypoglycemia cases are iatrogenic and usually accidental. A few cases of murder, attempted murder, or suicide using insulin overdoses have been reported, but most insulin shocks appear to be due to errors in dosage of insulin (e.g., 20 units instead of 2) or other unanticipated factors (did not eat as much as anticipated, or exercised more than expected, or unpredicted kinetics of the subcutaneously injected insulin itself).
Possible causes of hypoglycemia include:

==Diseases and syndromes==

There are several conditions in which insulin disturbance is pathologic:

==Medication uses==

Biosynthetic human insulin (insulin human rDNA, INN)for clinical use is manufactured by recombinant DNA technology.Drug Information Portal NLM – Insulin human USAN http://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/ Biosynthetic human insulin has increased purity when compared with extractive animal insulins, enhanced purity reducing antibody formation. Researchers have succeeded in introducing the gene for human insulin into plants as another method of producing insulin ("biopharming") in safflower.From SemBiosys, A New Kind Of Insulin INSIDE WALL STREET By Gene G. Marcial(AUGUST 13, 2007)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.i-sis.org.uk/gmSaffloweHumanPro-Insulin.php |title=GM Safflower with Human Pro-Insulin |publisher=I-sis.org.uk |accessdate=2012-07-27[/tpl] This technique is anticipated to reduce production costs.
Several analogs of human insulin are available for clinical therapy. These insulin analogs are closely related to the human insulin structure, they were developed for specific aspects of glycemic control in terms of fast action (prandial insulins) and long action (basal insulins).Insulin analog The first biosynthetic insulin analog was developed for clinical use at mealtime (prandial insulin), Humalog (insulin lispro),it is more rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection than regular insulin, with an effect 15 minutes after injection. Other rapid-acting analogues are NovoRapid and Apidra, with similar profiles. All are rapidly absorbed due to sequence that will reduce formation of dimers and hexamers (monomeric insulins are more rapidly absorbed). Fast acting insulins do not require the injection-to-meal interval previously recommended for human insulin and animal insulins. The other type is long acting insulin; the first of these was Lantus (insulin glargine). These have a steady effect for an extended period from 18 to 24 hours. Likewise, another protracted insulin analogue (Levemir) is based on a fatty acid acylation approach. A myristyric acid molecule is attached to this analogue, which in turn associates the insulin molecule to the abundant serum albumin, which in turn extends the effect and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. Both protracted analogues need to be taken only once daily, and are used for type 1 diabetics as the basal insulin. A combination of a rapid acting and a protracted insulin is also available, making it more likely for patients to achieve an insulin profile that mimics that of the body´s own insulin release.
Insulin is usually taken as subcutaneous injections by single-use syringes with needles, via an insulin pump, or by repeated-use insulin pens with disposable needles.
Unlike many medicines, insulin currently cannot be taken orally because, like nearly all other proteins introduced into the gastrointestinal tract, it is reduced to fragments (even single amino acid components), whereupon all activity is lost. There has been some research into ways to protect insulin from the digestive tract, so that it can be administered orally or sublingually. While experimental, several companies now have various formulations in human clinical trials, and one, the India-based Biocon, has formed an agreement with BMS to produce an oral-insulin alternative.NDTV Profit – November 16, 2012 – Biocon in pact with Bristol-Myers for oral insulin.

==History==

===Discovery===

In 1869, while studying the structure of the pancreas under a microscope, Paul Langerhans, a medical student in Berlin, identified some previously unnoticed tissue clumps scattered throughout the bulk of the pancreas. The function of the "little heaps of cells", later known as the islets of Langerhans, initially remained unknown, but Edouard Laguesse later suggested they might produce secretions that play a regulatory role in digestion. Paul Langerhans' son, Archibald, also helped to understand this regulatory role. The term "insulin" originates from insula, the Latin word for islet/island.
In 1889, the Polish-German physician Oscar Minkowski, in collaboration with Joseph von Mering, removed the pancreas from a healthy dog to test its assumed role in digestion. Several days after the removal of the dog's pancreas, Minkowski's animal-keeper noticed a swarm of flies feeding on the dog's urine. On testing the urine, they found sugar, establishing for the first time a relationship between the pancreas and diabetes. In 1901 Eugene Lindsay Opie took another major step forward when he clearly established the link between the islets of Langerhans and diabetes: "Diabetes mellitus . . . is caused by destruction of the islets of Langerhans and occurs only when these bodies are in part or wholly destroyed". Before Opie's work, medical science had clearly established the link between the pancreas and diabetes, but not the specific role of the islets.
Over the next two decades researchers made several attempts to isolate - as a potential treatment - whatever the islets produced. In 1906 George Ludwig Zuelzer achieved partial success in treating dogs with pancreatic extract, but he was unable to continue his work. Between 1911 and 1912, E.L. Scott at the University of Chicago used aqueous pancreatic extracts, and noted "a slight diminution of glycosuria", but was unable to convince his director of his work's value; it was shut down. Israel Kleiner demonstrated similar effects at Rockefeller University in 1915, but World War I interrupted his work and he did not return to it.[tpl]cite journal | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/92/4/507.pdf | author = The American Institute of Nutrition |title=Proceedings of the Thirty-first Annual Meeting of the American Institute of Nutrition | journal = Journal of Nutrition | volume = 92 | year = 1967 | page = 509 | format = PDF [/tpl]
In 1916 Nicolae Paulescu, a Romanian professor of physiology at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Bucharest, developed an aqueous pancreatic extract which, when injected into a diabetic dog, had a normalizing effect on  blood-sugar levels. He had to interrupt his experiments because of World War I, and in 1921 he wrote four papers about his work carried out in Bucharest and his tests on a diabetic dog. Later that year, he published "Research on the Role of the Pancreas in Food Assimilation".[ref][tpl]Cite journal | author = Paulesco NC | journal = Archives Internationales de Physiologie | title= Recherche sur le rôle du pancréas dans l'assimilation nutritive|volume= 17|issue=|pages= 85–103| date=August 31, 1921 [/tpl]

===Extraction and purification===

In October 1920, Canadian Frederick Banting concluded that it was the very digestive secretions that Minkowski had originally studied that were breaking down the islet secretion(s), thereby making it impossible to extract successfully. He jotted a note to himself: "Ligate pancreatic ducts of the dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate leaving islets. Try to isolate internal secretion of these and relieve glycosurea."
The idea was the pancreas's internal secretion, which, it was supposed, regulates sugar in the bloodstream, might hold the key to the treatment of diabetes. A surgeon by training, Banting knew certain arteries could be tied off that would lead to atrophy of most of the pancreas, while leaving the islets of Langerhans intact. He theorized a relatively pure extract could be made from the islets once most of the rest of the pancreas was gone.
In the spring of 1921, Banting traveled to Toronto to explain his idea to J.J.R. Macleod, who was Professor of Physiology at the University of Toronto, and asked Macleod if he could use his lab space to test the idea. Macleod was initially skeptical, but eventually agreed to let Banting use his lab space while he was on holiday for the summer. He also supplied Banting with ten dogs on which to experiment, and two medical students, Charles Best and Clark Noble, to use as lab assistants, before leaving for Scotland. Since Banting required only one lab assistant, Best and Noble flipped a coin to see which would assist Banting for the first half of the summer. Best won the coin toss, and took the first shift as Banting's assistant. Loss of the coin toss may have proved unfortunate for Noble, given that Banting decided to keep Best for the entire summer, and eventually shared half his Nobel Prize money and a large part of the credit for the discovery of insulin with the winner of the toss. Had Noble won the toss, his career might have taken a different path.[tpl]cite journal | author = Wright JR | title = Almost famous: E. Clark Noble, the common thread in the discovery of insulin and vinblastine | journal = CMAJ | volume = 167 | issue = 12 | pages = 1391–6 |date=December 2002 | pmid = 12473641 | pmc = 137361 | doi = | url = [/tpl] Banting's method was to tie a ligature around the pancreatic duct; when examined several weeks later, the pancreatic digestive cells had died and been absorbed by the immune system, leaving thousands of islets. They then isolated an extract from these islets, producing what they called "isletin" (what we now know as insulin), and tested this extract on the dogs starting July 27.[tpl]cite book | author = Krishnamurthy K | title = Pioneers in scientific discoveries | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=dAXYzzDL_9oC&pg=PA266 | accessdate = 26 July 2011 | year = 2002 | publisher = Mittal Publications | isbn = 978-81-7099-844-0 | page=266 [/tpl] Banting and Best were then able to keep a pancreatectomized dog named Marjorie alive for the rest of the summer by injecting her with the crude extract they had prepared. Removal of the pancreas in test animals in essence mimics diabetes, leading to elevated blood glucose levels. Marjorie was able to remain alive because the extracts, containing isletin, were able to lower her blood glucose levels.
Banting and Best presented their results to Macleod on his return to Toronto in the fall of 1921, but Macleod pointed out flaws with the experimental design, and suggested the experiments be repeated with more dogs and better equipment. He then supplied Banting and Best with a better laboratory, and began paying Banting a salary from his research grants. Several weeks later, the second round of experiments was also a success; and Macleod helped publish their results privately in Toronto that November. However, they needed six weeks to extract the isletin, which forced considerable delays. Banting suggested they try to use fetal calf pancreas, which had not yet developed digestive glands; he was relieved to find this method worked well. With the supply problem solved, the next major effort was to purify the extract. In December 1921, Macleod invited the biochemist James Collip to help with this task, and, within a month, the team felt ready for a clinical test.
On January 11, 1922, Leonard Thompson, a 14-year-old diabetic who lay dying at the Toronto General Hospital, was given the first injection of insulin.[tpl]cite journal | author = Bliss M | title = Rewriting medical history: Charles Best and the Banting and Best myth | journal = J Hist Med Allied Sci | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–74 |date=July 1993 | pmid = 8409364 | doi = 10.1093/jhmas/48.3.253 | url = http://jhmas.oxfordjournals.org/content/48/3/253.full.pdf [/tpl] However, the extract was so impure, Thompson suffered a severe allergic reaction, and further injections were canceled. Over the next 12 days, Collip worked day and night to improve the ox-pancreas extract, and a second dose was injected on January 23. This was completely successful, not only in having no obvious side-effects but also in completely eliminating the glycosuria sign of diabetes. The first American patient was Elizabeth Hughes Gossett, the daughter of the governor of New York.[tpl]cite news |author = Zuger A | title = Rediscovering the First Miracle Drug | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/health/05insulin.html?_r=1&hp=&pagewanted=all | quote = Elizabeth Hughes was a cheerful, pretty little girl, five feet tall, with straight brown hair and a consuming interest in birds.

By then she had survived three years, far longer than expected.

Children dying from diabetic ketoacidosis were kept in large wards, often with 50 or more patients in a ward, mostly comatose. Grieving family members were often in attendance, awaiting the (until then, inevitable) death.
In one of medicine's more dramatic moments, Banting, Best, and Collip went from bed to bed, injecting an entire ward with the new purified extract. Before they had reached the last dying child, the first few were awakening from their coma, to the joyous exclamations of their families.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/diabetes/discoveryofinsulin.php | title = Discovery of Insulin | format = | work = Medical News Today | publisher = MediLexicon International Ltd [/tpl]
Banting and Best never worked well with Collip, regarding him as something of an interloper, and Collip left the project soon after.
Over the spring of 1922, Best managed to improve his techniques to the point where large quantities of insulin could be extracted on demand, but the preparation remained impure. The drug firm Eli Lilly and Company had offered assistance not long after the first publications in 1921, and they took Lilly up on the offer in April. In November, Lilly made a major breakthrough and was able to produce large quantities of highly refined insulin. Insulin was offered for sale shortly thereafter.

===Synthesis===

Purified animal-sourced insulin was the only type of insulin available to diabetics until genetic advances occurred later with medical research. The amino acid structure of insulin was characterized in the early 1950s by Frederick Sanger, and the first synthetic insulin was produced simultaneously in the labs of Panayotis Katsoyannis at the University of Pittsburgh and Helmut Zahn at RWTH Aachen University in the early 1960s.[tpl]cite journal | url=http://books.google.com/?id=lkEEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA47&vq=insulin&pg=PA47#v=onepage&q=insulin | title=First Man-made Protein in History | author = Goro F | pages = 47–9 | journal = Life | publisher = Time, Inc. | volume = 56 | issue = 19 | location = New York, NY | date = 1964-05-08 | accessdate = 2009-11-02 | pmid = 14992380 | doi = 10.1080/15216540310001659029[/tpl][tpl]cite book | author = Wollmer A, Dieken ML, Federwisch M, De Meyts P | title = Insulin & related proteins structure to function and pharmacology | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | location = Boston | year = 2002 | pages = | isbn = 1-4020-0655-1 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=Ula72_FSwy8C&lpg=PP11&dq=Panayotis%20Katsoyannis&pg=PP11#v=onepage&q=Panayotis%20Katsoyannis [/tpl]
The first genetically engineered, synthetic "human" insulin was produced using E. coli in 1978 by Arthur Riggs and Keiichi Itakura at the Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope in collaboration with Herbert Boyer at Genentech.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.gene.com/gene/news/press-releases/display.do?method=detail&id=4160 | title = First Successful Laboratory Production of Human Insulin Announced | author =  | date = 1978-09-06 | work = News Release | publisher = Genentech | accessdate = 2009-11-03 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | url = http://www.littletree.com.au/dna.htm | title = Recombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin | author = Tof I  | year = 1994 | work = | publisher = Little Tree Publishing | accessdate = 2009-11-03 [/tpl] Genentech, founded by Swanson, Boyer and Eli Lilly and Company, went on in 1982 to sell the first commercially available biosynthetic human insulin under the brand name Humulin. The vast majority of insulin currently used worldwide is now biosynthetic recombinant "human" insulin or its analogues.[tpl]cite journal | author = Aggarwal SR | title = What's fueling the biotech engine-2011 to 2012 | journal = Nat Biotechnol | volume = 30 | issue = 12 | pages = 1191–7 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23222785 | pmc = | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2437[/tpl]
Recombinant insulin is produced either in yeast (usually saccharomyces cerevisiae) or E. coli.[tpl]cite journal |url=http://w3.ualg.pt/~jvarela/biotecnol/pdf/humaninsulin.pdf |title=Yeast secretory expression of insulin precursors |author=Kjeldsen T |journal= Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology |year=2000 |volume=54|issue=3|pages=277–86 |pmid=11030562 |doi=10.1007/s002530000402 [/tpl] In yeast, insulin may be engineered as a single-chain protein with a KexII endoprotease (a yeast homolog of PCI/PCII) site that separates the insulin A chain from a c-terminally truncated insulin B chain.  A chemically synthesized c-terminal tail is then grafted onto insulin by reverse proteolysis using the inexpensive protease trypsin; typically the lysine on the c-terminal tail is protected with a chemical protecting group to prevent proteolysis.  The ease of modular synthesis and the relative safety of modifications in that region accounts for common insulin analogs with c-terminal modifications (e.g. lispro, aspart, glulisine).  The Genentech synthesis and completely chemical synthesis such as that by Bruce Merrifield are not preferred because the efficiency of recombining the two insulin chains is low, primarily due to competition with the precipitation of insulin B chain.

===Nobel Prizes===

The Nobel Prize committee in 1923 credited the practical extraction of insulin to a team at the University of Toronto and awarded the Nobel Prize to two men: Frederick Banting and J.J.R. Macleod.[tpl]cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1923/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1923 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation [/tpl] They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1923 for the discovery of insulin. Banting, insulted that Best was not mentioned, shared his prize with him, and Macleod immediately shared his with James Collip. The patent for insulin was sold to the University of Toronto for one half-dollar.
The primary structure of insulin was determined by British molecular biologist Frederick Sanger.[tpl]cite journal | author = Stretton AO | title = The first sequence. Fred Sanger and insulin | journal = Genetics | volume = 162 | issue = 2 | pages = 527–32 |date=October 2002 | pmid = 12399368 | pmc = 1462286 | doi = [/tpl] It was the first protein to have its sequence be determined. He was awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work.
In 1969, after decades of work, Dorothy Hodgkin determined the spatial conformation of the molecule, the so-called tertiary structure, by means of X-ray diffraction studies. She had been awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 for the development of crystallography.
Rosalyn Sussman Yalow received the 1977 Nobel Prize in Medicine for the development of the radioimmunoassay for insulin.
George Minot, co-recipient of the 1934 Nobel Prize for the development of the first effective treatment for pernicious anemia, had diabetes mellitus.  Dr. William Castle observed that the 1921 discovery of insulin, arriving in time to keep Minot alive, was therefore also responsible for the discovery of a cure for pernicious anemia.[ref]

===Nobel Prize controversy===

The work published by Banting, Best, Collip and Macleod represented the preparation of purified insulin extract suitable for use on human patients.[tpl]cite journal | author = Banting FG, Best CH, Collip JB, Campbell WR, Fletcher AA | title = Pancreatic Extracts in the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus | journal = Can Med Assoc J | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 141–6 |date=March 1922 | pmid = 20314060 | pmc = 1524425 | doi =  [/tpl] Although Paulescu discovered the principles of the treatment his saline extract could not be used on humans, and he was not mentioned in the 1923 Nobel Prize. Professor Ian Murray was particularly active in working to correct "the historical wrong" against Nicolae Paulescu. Murray was a professor of physiology at the Anderson College of Medicine in Glasgow, Scotland, the head of the department of Metabolic Diseases at a leading Glasgow hospital, vice-president of the British Association of Diabetes, and a founding member of the International Diabetes Federation. Murray wrote:
 Insufficient recognition has been given to Paulesco, the distinguished Roumanian scientist, who at the time when the Toronto team were commencing their research had already succeeded in extracting the antidiabetic hormone of the pancreas and proving its efficacy in reducing the hyperglycaemia in diabetic dogs.[tpl]cite journal | author = Drury MI | title = The golden jubile of insulin | journal = J Ir Med Assoc | volume = 65 | issue = 14 | pages = 355–63 |date=July 1972 | pmid = 4560502 | doi = | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=csBLAQAAIAAJ [/tpl]
 
In a recent private communication Professor Tiselius, head of the Nobel Institute, has expressed his personal opinion that Paulescu was equally worthy of the award in 1923.[tpl]cite journal | author = Murray I | title = Paulescu and the isolation of insulin | journal = J Hist Med Allied Sci | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 150–7 |date=April 1971 | pmid = 4930788 | doi = 10.1093/jhmas/XXVI.2.150 [/tpl]
