==History==

Barnet Gate Mill was built in 1826. A claim that it was built during the Napoleonic Wars (c.1800) has not been substantiated. Although steam had been added in 1895,[tpl]cite book | first = Cyril| last = Moore| year = 1999| title = Hertfordshire Windmills & Windmillers| pages = p42â€“44| publisher = Windsup Publishing| location = Sawbridgeworth| id = ISBN 0-9533861-0-4[/tpl] it was working by wind until 1918, latterly on two sails.

==Description==

Barnet Gate Mill is a four storey tower  mill with an ogee cap which has a gallery. It has two Patent sails and two Common sails carried on a cast iron windshaft. The cap is winded by a fantail.

==Machinery==

The mill may have started life with two Common sails and two Spring sails carried on a wooden windshaft as the wooden clasp arm Brake Wheel has had to be fitted with packing pieces to enable it to fit the current windshaft, which being of iron is a smaller diameter that a wooden one would be. The Wallower is of cast iron, carried on a wooden upright shaft. This carries the Great Spur Wheel, which is of iron with wooden cogs and drove the two pairs of millstones underdrift. A third pair was added when steam power was installed. Only one pair of millstones remains today.
