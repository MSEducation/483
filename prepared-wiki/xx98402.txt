==History==

===Early years===

The company was founded by Walter L. Jacobs in 1918, who started a car rental operation in Chicago with a dozen Model T Ford cars. In 1923, Jacobs sold it to John D. Hertz who made it a subsidiary of his Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company and renamed it "Hertz Drive-Ur-Self System".
He sold a controlling interest in the Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company (and hence also 'Hertz Drive-Ur-Self') to General Motors in 1925 who then purchased the remaining shares in 1943.
Hertz arranged for The Omnibus Corporation, which he also owned, to purchase the car rental business back from GM in 1953. He sold all The Omnibus Corporation's public transport interests the same year, changed its name to 'The Hertz Corporation' and floated it on the New York Stock Exchange the following year.

===The Hertz Corporation===

In 1954, the new corporation bought New York truck leasing company, Metropolitan Distributors.
In 1967, The Hertz Corporation became a wholly owned subsidiary of RCA but was operated as a separate entity. In 1985, Hertz joined UAL Corporation. On December 30, 1987, Hertz was sold to 'Park Ridge Corporation', which was then owned by Ford Motor Company and members of Hertz senior management. In 1988, Volvo North America Corporation invested in Park Ridge Corporation.[tpl]cite web|url=https://www.hertz.com/rentacar/abouthertz/index.jsp?targetPage=CorporateProfile.jsp&c=aboutHertzHistoryView |title=Hertz History |publisher=Hertz Corporation |accessdate=2012-01-27[/tpl]
On June 13, 2005, Ford issued a notice that Hertz would be let loose in an initial public offering. On September 8, 2005 it was announced it was to be sold to private equity companies Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, The Carlyle Group and Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity for $15 billion in cash and debt acquisition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/09/business/09hertz.html|title=Private Investors to Buy Hertz for $15 Billion|work=New York Times|author=Andrew Ross Sorkin|date=September 9, 2005|accessdate=December 19, 2013[/tpl] The sale was completed on December 22, 2005. This private equity group took Hertz public on November 16, 2006.
On January 11, 2010, Hertz announced the acquisition of used cars dealer British Car Auctions (BCA) for an undisclosed sum.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/automotive/2010/01/car-dealer-bca-hertz-rental |title=Hertz acquires used car dealer BCA |date=2010-01-11 |accessdate=2010-02-18[/tpl]
In November 2011, Hertz introduced ExpressRent kiosks at a number of locations. This was the first large scale car rental kiosk deployment in the U.S. using a live agent assistant via video chat.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cio.com/article/718442/Hertz_Improves_Customer_Experience_With_Friendlier_Kiosks |title=Hertz Improves Customer Experience With Friendlier Kiosks |author=Stacy Collett |work=CIO |accessdate=2014-03-24[/tpl]
On January 3, 2014 it was reported that Hertz shares had jumped in value by 2.6% after the reported purchase of 30-40 million shares by billionaire Carl Icahn in what was believed to be a hostile takeover attempt. In response to Icahn’s reported share purchase the Hertz Board reportedly stated that it would issue one preferred share for each current share in what is referred to as a “poison pill” response.

===Key Executives===

===Hertz Global Holdings Inc===

In April 2010, Hertz and Dollar-Thrifty Automotive Group announced an agreement under which Hertz was to acquire Dollar-Thrifty for a purchase price of [tpl]currency|41.00[/tpl] per share, subject to shareholder approval, in a mix of cash and Hertz common stock.  Dollar-Thrifty investors in Tulsa, Oklahoma rejected this [tpl]currency|1.44 billion[/tpl] bid from Hertz on September 30, 2010.  Dollar-Thrifty subsequently announced on October 12, 2011 that it had taken itself off the market because it did not receive any proposals that would pass antitrust review.  On August 28, 2012, Hertz announced for the second time its intention to acquire Dollar-Thrifty, subject to FTC approval, in this case for [tpl]currency|2.3 billion[/tpl].  This merger would yield combined annual sales of [tpl]currency|10.2 billion[/tpl]. The deal was concluded in November 2012 and resulted in a combined 10,400 locations in approximately 150 countries.

===Headquarters Relocation===

On May 7, 2013, Hertz executives, alongside Florida Governor Rick Scott, announced the company would be relocating its worldwide headquarters from Park Ridge, New Jersey to Estero, Florida. It is believed the northeast corner of the intersection of Williams Road and US-41 will be the location of the new headquarters. This would put it less than a half a mile north of Coconut Point Mall. Hertz announced though that certain operations will still occur in its old headquarters in Park Ridge.
The new headquarters is now under construction and the new buildings will be fully completed in early 2015.

==Fleet==

The Hertz fleet consists of a wide majority of vehicle manufacturers, with the majority being GM products. Luxury cars are provided by Mercedes, Infiniti, and Cadillac. Previously, due to Hertz's affiliation with Ford, the rental fleet of most locations consisted of Ford and its brands, such as Mazda, Volvo, Mercury and Lincoln, along with various others (mostly Korean and Japanese).

===Specialty Cars===

In 1966, Hertz engaged racing and automotive designer Carroll Shelby to develop an exclusive version of his modified Ford Mustang. One thousand GT350H Mustangs were built and ultimately sold once their rental use had ended; however, many of them were missing the matching engine. Some renters would rent the car for a weekend and swap out the engine with a base model 289ci V8. Engine inspections upon return of the "racer" were not common place, so nobody found out until the car was due for service. By that time, there was no way to track down the engine thief. The so-called "rent-a-racer" program in the late-1960s was available in selected locations and the fleet also included Corvettes, Jaguar XK-Es, and AMC AMXs.[tpl]cite web|title=1968 AMC AMX - Hertz Rent A Racer|url=http://www.1968hertzamx.com/ |first=Bruce|last=Nolan|accessdate=2011-09-30[/tpl]
In 2006, the 40th anniversary of the original GT350H, Hertz introduced the Shelby Mustang GT-H as part of the Fun Collection at select locations. This was followed in 2007 with a convertible version of the GT-H.  2008 saw 500 Chevrolet Corvettes, badged as "ZHZ", available from selected US airports; the following year 350 convertible ZHZs joined the fleet.  Both were finished in Hertz' corporate yellow with a central black stripe.

===Green collection and electric cars===

Hertz launched its "Green Collection" in September 2006 with environmentally friendly vehicles including the Toyota Prius, Ford Fusion, Buick LaCrosse, Toyota Camry, and Hyundai Sonata.[tpl]cite book|title=The Green Marketing Manifesto |first=John |last=Grant | publisher=Wiley |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-470-68731-4| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XFPQ-GB0MwQC&pg=PT174&dq=Hertz+Green+collection |accessdate=2012-01-27 [/tpl] All feature Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) highway fuel efficiency ratings of [tpl]convert|28|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on[/tpl] or better on the highway.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7qiGSc4Zb28C&pg=PA19&dq=Hertz+Green+collection |page=19 |title=Rethink, Reinvent, Reposition: 12 Strategies to Renew Your Business and Boost Your Bottom Line |first=Leo |last= Hopf |first2=William|last2=Welter |publisher=Adams Media |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-60550-024-9 |accessdate=2012-01-27 [/tpl] In early 2007, Hertz launched its global hybrid rental program in conjunction with a $1 million donation to the National Park Foundation.[tpl]cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lgll2iHgMMEC&pg=PA26&dq=Hertz+Green+collection+park+service |page=26 |first=Robin |last=Nazzaro |title=National Park Service: Donations and Related Partnerships Benefit, but Management Refinements Could Better Target Risks and Enhance Accountability |publisher=United States Government Accountability Office, document 09-386 |year=2009 |accessdate=2012-01-27 [/tpl]

===Simply Wheelz and Advantage===

In 2007, Hertz launched subbrand "Simply Wheelz" to address economy-minded and leisure-market customers in Orlando, Florida. The subbrand was colocated within and utilized the fleet and other assets of the parent brand, and channeled reservations and customer-service through a streamlined web front-end (resembling those of low-cost-carrier airlines) to its existing systems. Hertz outbid Enterprise Rent-a-Car acquiring the assets of bankrupt Advantage Rent a Car System in early 2009. The Simply Wheelz subbrand and website were then rebranded as Advantage Rent-a-Car.
On August 26, 2012, Hertz announced that it agreed to sell the US Advantage business to Franchise Services of North America and Macquarie Capital, as a divestiture to receive regulatory approval of Hertz's acquisition of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, announced at the same time, and to convert foreign Advantage locations to the Thrifty brand.http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=205461&p=irol-newsArticle_Print&ID=1728567&highlight= On December 12, 2012, Advantage Rent A Car was acquired by MacQuarie Capital.

==Advertising==

===Let Hertz put you in the driver’s seat===

In 1959, the advertising firm of Norman, Craig & Kummel (NCK) was selected as the new advertising agency for Hertz. NCK developed the slogan “Hertz puts you in the driver’s seat,” which was first used commercially in September 1959. NCK quickly changed the wording to “Let Hertz put you in the driver’s seat” by October 1959. Hertz used the line in the early 1960s in print, signs and television. The series is listed as number 65 in the top 100 advertising campaigns of the 20th century by Advertising Age magazine.[tpl]cite web|title=Ad Age Advertising Century: Top 100 Campaigns|url=http://adage.com/article/special-report-the-advertising-century/ad-age-advertising-century-top-100-advertising-campaigns/140150/|work=AdvertisingAge|publisher=Crain Communications|accessdate=29 December 2012[/tpl]

===John F. Kennedy assassination===

A large billboard advertising Hertz was on the roof of the Texas School Book Depository in Dealey Plaza during the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. The billboard was removed in 1978.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://issuu.com/taartdir/docs/ta08_11.12_web |first=Jonathan |last=Moore |title=Open Window to History: A look back at the improbable conservation of the Texas School Book Depository |journal=Texas Architect |publisher=Texas Society of Architects |date=Nov–Dec 2008 |pages=22–25 |accessdate=2011-01-27[/tpl]

===O.J. Simpson===

O.J. Simpson appeared prominently in ads for the company. The company set the trend of hiring black athletes as sponsors of various brands.[tpl]cite book |title=African Americans and Popular Culture: Theater, film, and television |first=Todd |last=Boyd |year=2008 |pages=86–87 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Evxm9Wd6P6EC&pg=RA1-PA86&dq=Hertz+OJ+simpson |accessdate=2011-01-27[/tpl] In 1975, O.J. Simpson became a staple in American households with his Hertz commercials. One spot from the mid-1970s, showed Simpson, former football star as he was, running through an airport terminal (wearing a three-piece business suit and carrying a briefcase) and leaping over rows of departure lounge seats trying to get to his Hertz rental car. A woman yelled, "Go O.J. Go!" The tagline of the ad, as spoken by O.J., was "Hertz, the superstar in rent-a-car". In later years and through the 1980s, he appeared with golf legend Arnold Palmer; the pair was joined by the early 1990s by actress Jamie Lee Curtis. The relationship between Hertz and Simpson ended in late 1992 when reports of domestic abuse surfaced.

==Low-floor passenger bus==

A significant Hertz-led technology was the development in North America of the low-floor passenger coach. Until the early 21st century, most large Hertz lots were linked to airports they served by small fleets of firm-operated transit buses. Many Hertz locations used the Rapid Transit Series, whose high floor and stairs made loading of baggage difficult and rendered access to wheelchair and ECV-using customers difficult or impossible. A large potential contract from Hertz led Gillig Brothers of Hayward, California, to invest in a radical redesign of the city bus that offered a floor only a foot off of the ground (lower when pneumatically "kneeled") from the front of the bus, between the front wheels, up to the rear axle. The low floor and additional space freed by the redesign, initially titled the "H2000LF" by Hertz, greatly reduced loading and unloading time, increased convenience, and were for a time exclusive to Hertz. The bus was subsequently marketed as the Gillig Low Floor and is widely deployed by U.S. public transportation agencies.

==Heavy equipment rental==

Hertz also maintains a heavy equipment rental division known as the Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation, aka HERC. It is headquartered in Park Ridge, New Jersey, United States."Corporate Governance Overview." The Hertz Corporation. Retrieved on June 14, 2009.
