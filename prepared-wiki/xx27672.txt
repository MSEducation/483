[[Eunuch]]

CATEGORIES: Eunuchs

A eunuch ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|n|ə|k[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-el|εὐνοῦχος[/tpl]) is a man who (by the common definition of the term) may have been castrated, typically early enough in his life for this change to have major hormonal consequences. In some ancient texts, "eunuch" may refer to a man who is not castrated but who is impotent, celibate, or otherwise not inclined to marry and procreate. 
Castration was typically carried out on the soon-to-be eunuch without his consent in order that he might perform a specific social function; this was common in many societies. The earliest records for intentional castration to produce eunuchs are from the Sumerian city of Lagash in the 21st century BC.Maekawa, Kazuya (1980). Animal and human castration in Sumer, Part II: Human castration in the Ur III period. Zinbun of the Research Institute for Humanistic Studies, Kyoto University, pp. 1–56.Maekawa, Kazuya (1980). Female Weavers and Their Children in Lagash – Presargonic and Ur III. Acta Sumerologica 2:81–125. Over the millennia since, they have performed a wide variety of functions in many different cultures: courtiers or equivalent domestics, treble singers, religious specialists, soldiers, royal guards government officials and guardians of women or harem servants.
Eunuchs would probably be servants or slaves who, because of their function, had been castrated, usually in order to make them reliable servants of a royal court where physical access to the ruler could wield great influence.[tpl]cite web|author=Christine Hsu |url=http://www.medicaldaily.com/articles/12295/20120924/eunuch-study-reveals-castration-add-20-years.htm |title=Eunuch Study Reveals That Castration May Add 20 Years to a Man's Life |publisher=Medicaldaily.com |date=2012-09-24 |accessdate=2014-04-24[/tpl] Seemingly lowly domestic functions—such as making the ruler's bed, bathing him, cutting his hair, carrying him in his litter, or even relaying messages—could in theory give a eunuch "the ruler's ear" and impart de facto power on the formally humble but trusted servant. Similar instances are reflected in the humble origins and etymology of many high offices (e.g., chancellor originally denoted a servant guarding the entrance to an official's study). Eunuchs supposedly did not generally have loyalties to the military, the aristocracy, nor to a family of their own (having neither offspring nor in-laws, at the very least), and were thus seen as more trustworthy and less interested in establishing a private 'dynasty'. Because their condition usually lowered their social status, they could also be easily replaced or killed without repercussion. In cultures that had both harems and eunuchs, eunuchs were sometimes used as harem servants (compare the female odalisque) or seraglio guards.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]
In Latin, the words eunuchus, spado, and castratus were used to denote eunuchs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wordes.exe?eunuch |title=Words |publisher=Archives.nd.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24[/tpl]

==Etymology==

Eunuch comes from the Greek word eunoukhos, first attested in a poetic fragment of Hipponax.[tpl]cite book|last=Miller|first=Margaret|title=Athens and Persia in the Fifth Century BC: A Study in Cultural Receptivity|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0 521 49598 9|page=213[/tpl] In the Middle Ages, Eustathius of Thessalonica (Commentaries on Homer 1256.30, 1643.16) derived the word from eunis + ocheuein, "deprived of mating",[tpl]cite journal|last=Maass|first=Ernst|title=Eunouchos und Verwandtes|journal=Rheinisches Museum|year=1925|volume=74|page=437[/tpl] while Theophylact of Ohrid in a dialogue In Defence of Eunuchs claimed the word came from eunoos, "well-minded, friendly".[tpl]cite book|last=Gautier|first=Paul, ed. and tr.|title=Théophylacte d'Achrida: Discours, Traités, Poésies|year=1980|publisher=Association de Recherches Byzantines|location=Thessaloniki|pages=308–309[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Ringrose|first=Kathryn M.|title=The Perfect Servant: Eunuchs and the Social Construction of Gender in Byzantium|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-72015-2|pages=16, 39[/tpl]  The 11th century Byzantine monk Nikon of the Black Mountain agreed with the latter derivation in his Taktikon.[tpl]cite book|last=Benesevic|first=V.N.|title=Taktikon Nikona Cernogorca|year=1917|location=St. Petersburg|page=99[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last=Gautier|first=Paul, ed. and tr.|title=Théophylacte d'Achrida: Discours, Traités, Poésies|year=1980|publisher=Association de Recherches Byzantines|location=Thessaloniki|pages=308 note 34[/tpl] On the other hand, Byzantine emperor Leo VI the Wise, in his New Constitution 98 banning the marriage of eunuchs, noted eunuchs' reputation as trustworthy guardians of marriage beds and deemed the word eunuch to be related to a Greek word for bed, eune.[tpl]cite book|last=Noailles|first=P., and A. Dain|title=Les Nouvelles de Leon VI le Sage|year=1944|location=Paris|page=325[/tpl] Modern etymologists have followed Leo VI's lead in deriving it from eune, "bed," + -ekhein, "to have, hold", interpreting the original meaning to be "guardian of the bedroom of another person".[tpl]cite book|last=Chantraine|first=Pierre|title=Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue grecque - Histoire des mots, Vol. 2, E-K|year=1970|publisher=Éditions Klincksieck|location=Paris|pages=385–386[/tpl]  However, the rules of Greek vowel contractions (see crasis) seem to favor the view of either Eustathius or Theophylact and Nikon, since the ou in eunoukhos requires an o-sound between the contracted words, such as the o-sound at the start of ocheuein or on the end of the stem of euno-.

==Eunuchs by region and epoch==

===Ancient Middle East===

Eunuchs were familiar figures in the Assyrian Empire (ca. 850 until 622 BCE) and in the court of the Egyptian Pharaohs (down to the Lagid dynasty known as Ptolemies, ending with Cleopatra),(30 BCE). Political eunuchism became a fully established institution among the Achamenide Persians.[ref]Orlando Patterson, Slavery and Social Death, 511 pp., Harvard University Press, 1982
ISBN 0-674-81083-X, 9780674810839 (see p.315)[/ref] Eunuchs held powerful positions in the Achaemenide court. The eunuch Bagoas (not to be confused with Alexander's Bagoas) was the Vizier of Artaxerxes III and IV, and was the primary power behind the throne during their reigns, until he was killed by Darius III.Diod. xvi. 50; cf. Didymus, Comm. in Demosth. Phil. vi. 5

===Ancient Greece, Rome and Byzantium===

The practice was also well established in other Mediterranean areas among the Greeks and Romans, although a role as court functionaries does not arise until Byzantine times. The Galli or Priests of Cybele were eunuchs.
In the late period of the Roman Empire, after the adoption of the oriental royal court model by the Emperors Diocletian and Constantine, Emperors were surrounded by eunuchs for such functions as bathing, hair cutting, dressing, and bureaucratic functions, in effect acting as a shield between the Emperor and his administrators from physical contact, thus enjoying great influence in the Imperial Court (see Eusebius and Eutropius). Eunuchs were believed loyal and indispensable.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2009[/tpl]
The Roman poet Martial rails against a woman who has sex with partially castrated eunuchs (those whose testicles were removed or rendered inactive only) in the bitter epigram (VI, 67): "Do you ask, Panychus, why your Caelia only consorts with eunuchs? Caelia wants the flowers of marriage – not the fruits." Penzer, N. M. (1965) The Harem, Spring Books, London, p. 147. It is up for debate whether this passage is representative of any sort of widely practiced behavior, however.
At the Byzantine imperial court, there were a great number of eunuchs employed in domestic and administrative functions, actually organized as a separate hierarchy, following a parallel career of their own. Archieunuchs—each in charge of a group of eunuchs—were among the principal officers in Constantinople, under the emperors.[tpl]1728[/tpl] http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&entity=HistSciTech000900240173&isize=L Under Justinian in the 6th century, the eunuch Narses functioned as a successful general in a number of campaigns. By the last centuries of the Empire the number of roles reserved for eunuchs had reduced, and their use may have been all but over.
Following the Byzantine tradition, eunuchs had important tasks at the court of the Norman kingdom of Sicily during the middle 12th century. One of them, Philip of Mahdia, has been admiratus admiratorum, and another one, Peter the caid, was prime minister.

===China===

In China, castration included removal of the penis as well as the testicles. Both organs were cut off with a knife at the same time.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XuX-MGTZnJoC&pg=PA248&dq=many+imperial+servants+in+china+castrated+having+not+only+testicles+but+penis+as+well#v=onepage&q=many%20imperial%20servants%20in%20china%20castrated%20having%20not%20only%20testicles%20but%20penis%20as%20well&f=false|title=Encyclopedia of birth control|author=Vern L.

From ancient times until the Sui Dynasty, castration was both a traditional punishment (one of the Five Punishments) and a means of gaining employment in the Imperial service. Certain eunuchs gained immense power that occasionally superseded that of even the Grand Secretaries. Zheng He, who lived during the Ming Dynasty, is an example of such a eunuch. Self-castration was a common practice, although it was not always performed completely, which led to its being made illegal.
It is said that the justification for the employment of eunuchs as high-ranking civil servants was that, since they were incapable of having children, they would not be tempted to seize power and start a dynasty. In many cases, eunuchs were considered more reliable than the scholar officials. A similar system existed in Vietnam.For an extended discussion see Mitamura Taisuke,Chinese Eunuchs: The Structure of Intimate Politics tr. Charles A. Pomeroy, Tokyo 1970, a short, condensed version of Mitamura's original book =三田村泰助, 宦官, Chuko Shinsho, Tokyo 1963
The tension between eunuchs in the service of the emperor and virtuous Confucian officials is a familiar theme in Chinese history. In his History of Government, Samuel Finer points out that reality was not always that clear-cut. There were instances of very capable eunuchs who were valuable advisers to their emperor, and the resistance of the "virtuous" officials often stemmed from jealousy on their part. Ray Huang argues that in reality, eunuchs represented the personal will of the Emperor, while the officials represented the alternate political will of the bureaucracy. The clash between them would thus have been a clash of ideologies or political agenda.[tpl]cite book|last=Huang|first=Ray|title=1587, A Year of No Significance: The Ming Dynasty in Decline|year=1981|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-02518-1[/tpl]
The number of eunuchs in Imperial employ fell to 470 by 1912, when the practice of using them ceased.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]
The last Imperial eunuch, Sun Yaoting, died in December 1996.

At the end of the Ming Dynasty, there were about 70,000 eunuchs (宦官 huànguān, or 太監 tàijiàn) employed by the emperor, with some serving inside the Imperial palace.

====Conquest Dynasties====

Many of the non-Han Chinese peoples who founded states in China after invading originally did not have eunuchs as part of their culture, but adopted it from the Han Chinese.

=====Khitan Liao dynasty=====

The Khitan adopted the practice of using eunuchs from the Chinese and the eunuchs were non-Khitan prisoners of war. The Khitan were a nomadic Mongolic people and originally did not have eunuchs as part of their culture.祝建龙 (Zhu Jianlong), 二〇〇九年四月 (April 2009), 12.(Page 18 on online document viewer, Page 12 on actual document) When the Khitan founded the Liao Dynasty they developed a harem system with concubines and wives and adopted eunuchs as part of it. The eunuchs were not Khitan and they came from two sources, all of their eunuchs were captured ethnic Chinese from the Central Plains. The Khitan captured Chinese people who were already eunuchs at the Jin court when they invaded of the Later Jin. Another source was during their war with the Chinese Song dynasty, the Khitan would raid China, capture Han Chinese boys as prisoners of war and emasculate them to become eunuchs. The emasculation of captured Chinese boys guaranteed a continuous supply of eunuchs to serve in the Liao Dynasty harem. The Empress Dowager Chengtian played a large role in the raids to capture and emasculate the boys.祝建龙 (Zhu Jianlong), 二〇〇九年四月 (April 2009), 13.(Page 19 on online document viewer, Page 13 on actual document)
The Khitan Empress Dowager Xiao Chuo (Chengtian) of the Khitan Liao state took power at age 30 in 982 as a regent for her son.

=====Manchu Qing dynasty=====

The sons and grandsons of the rebel Yaqub Beg in China were all castrated. Surviving members of Yaqub Beg's family included his 4 sons, 4 grandchildren (2 grandsons and 2 granddaughters), and 4 wives. They either died in prison in Lanzhou, Gansu, or were killed by the Chinese. His sons Yima Kuli, K'ati Kuli, Maiti Kuli, and grandson Aisan Ahung were the only survivors in 1879. They were all underage children, and put on trial, sentenced to an agonizing death if they were complicit in their father's rebellious "sedition", or if they were innocent of their fathers' crimes, were to be sentenced to castration and serve as eunuch slaves to Chinese troops, when they reached 11 years old, and were handed over to the Imperial Household to be executed or castrated.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Yjg1AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA83&dq=whether+they+have+attained+full+age+or+not,+be+delivered+imperial+household+made+eunuchs+slaves+to+soldiery+turkestan#v=onepage&q=whether%20they%20have%20attained%20full%20age%20or%20not%2C%20be%20delivered%20imperial%20household%20made%20eunuchs%20slaves%20to%20soldiery%20turkestan&f=false|title=Translations of the Peking Gazette|author=|year=1880|publisher=|location=|page=83|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=12 May 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DqYoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA145&dq=whether+they+have+attained+full+age+or+not,+be+delivered+imperial+household+made+eunuchs+slaves+to+soldiery+turkestan#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The American annual cyclopedia and register of important events of the year ..., Volume 4|author=|year=1888|publisher=D.

===Korea===

The eunuchs of Korea, called Naesi (내시, 內侍), were officials to the king and other royalty in traditional Korean society. The first recorded appearance of a Korean eunuch was in Goryeosa ("History of Goryeo"), a compilation about the Goryeo period. In 1392, with the founding of the Joseon Dynasty, the Naesi system was revised, and the department was renamed the "Department of Naesi" (내시부, 內侍府).[tpl]ko[/tpl] 내시 - 네이버 백과사전
The Naesi system included two ranks, those of Sangseon (상선, 尙膳, "Chief of Naesi"), who held the official title of senior second rank, and Naegwan (내관, 內官, "Common official naesi"), both of which held rank as officers. 140 naesi in total served the palace in Joseon Dynasty period. They also took the exam on Confucianism every month. The naesi system was repealed in 1894 following Gabo reform.
According to legend, castration consisted of daubing a boy's genitals with human feces and having a dog bite them off.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=U-fc5X0cUjwC&pg=PA280&dq=Korean+eunuchs,+however,+had+it+worst+of+all.+In+ancient+times+they+were+castrated+by+having+their+genitals+smeared+with+human+feces+and+then+being+exposed+to+packs+of+hungry+dogs#v=onepage&q=Korean%20eunuchs%2C%20however%2C%20had%20it%20worst%20of%20all.%20In%20ancient%20times%20they%20were%20castrated%20by%20having%20their%20genitals%20smeared%20with%20human%20feces%20and%20then%20being%20exposed%20to%20packs%20of%20hungry%20dogs&f=false|title=Manthropology: The Science of Why the Modern Male Is Not the Man He Used to Be|author=Peter McAllister|year=2010|publisher=Macmillan|location=|isbn=0-312-55543-1|page=280|pages=|accessdate=11 January 2011[/tpl] During the Yuan Dynasty, eunuchs became a desirable commodity for tributes, and dog bites were replaced by more sophisticated surgical techniques.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=S3Y2PTI_vYYC&pg=PA137&dq=korean+castrated+dog+bite#v=onepage&q=korean%20castrated%20dog%20bite&f=false|title=Children in slavery through the ages|author=Gwyn Campbell, Suzanne Miers, Joseph Calder Miller|year=2009|publisher=Ohio University Press|location=|isbn=0-8214-1877-7|page=137|pages=|accessdate=11 January 2011[/tpl]

===Vietnam===

The Vietnamese adopted the eunuch system and castration techniques from China. Records show that the Vietnamese performed castration in a painful procedure by removing the entire genitalia with both penis and testicles being cut off with a sharp knife or metal blade. The procedure was agonizing since the entire penis was cut off.[tpl]cite news |title=Chuyện 'tịnh thân' hãi hùng của thái giám Việt xưa |author= |url=http://vietbao.vn/Suc-khoe/Chuyen-tinh-than-hai-hung-cua-thai-giam-Viet-xua/2131549871/70/ |newspaper=Viet Bao |date=October 5, 2012 |deadurl=no |accessdate=31 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Chuyện 'tịnh thân' hãi hùng của thái giám Việt xưa|others= Theo Đất Việt |url=http://ngoisao.net/tin-tuc/thoi-cuoc/24h/chuyen-tinh-than-hai-hung-cua-thai-giam-viet-xua-2621880.html |newspaper=Ngôi sao |date=10 April 2012 |deadurl=no |accessdate=31 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Thê lương chuyện 'của quý' của thái giám Việt xưa |others=Báo Đất Việt |url=http://www.baomoi.com/The-luong-chuyen-cua-quy-cua-thai-giam-Viet-xua/139/9058145.epi |newspaper=Báo Mới |date=8 May 2012 |deadurl=no |accessdate=31 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Thê lương chuyện ‘của quý’ của thái giám Việt xưa|others=Theo Đất Việt |url= http://2sao.vn/p0c1048n20120808152150734/the-luong-chuyen-'cua-quy'-cua-thai-giam-viet-xua.vnn|newspaper=2sao|date=8 August 2012 |deadurl=no |accessdate=31 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Thê lương chuyện 'của quý' của thái giám Việt xưa|others= ĐVO|url=http://www.treonline.com/the-luong-chuyen-cua-quy-cua-quai-giam-viet-xua.htm |newspaper=Treonline |date= |accessdate=27 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Hành trình đau khổ của những hoạn quan thời xưa|others= Theo Báo Đất Việt|url= http://giadinh.net.vn/the-gioi/hanh-trinh-dau-kho-cua-nhung-hoan-quan-thoi-xua-20110824020430125.htm|newspaper= Báo Gia đình & Xã hội|date=24 August 2011 |accessdate=27 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title= Bí mật về thái giám trong cung triều Nguyễn|others= Theo Công An Nhân Dân|url= http://news.zing.vn/xa-hoi/bi-mat-ve-thai-giam-trong-cung-trieu-nguyen/a336065.html|newspaper=Zing News |date=18 July 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2013[/tpl] The young man's thighs and abdomen would be tied and others would pin him down on a table.

====Lê Dynasty====

In the Lê Dynasty the Vietnamese Emperor Lê Thánh Tông was aggressive in his relations with foreign countries including China. A large amount of trade between Guangdong and Vietnam happened during his reign. Early accounts recorded that the Vietnamese captured Chinese whose ships had blown off course and detained them. Young Chinese men were selected by the Vietnamese for castration to become eunuch slaves to the Vietnamese. It has been speculated by modern historians that the Chinese who were captured and castrated by the Vietnamese were involved in trade between China and Vietnam instead of actually being blown off course by the wind and they were punished as part of a crackdown on foreign trade by Vietnam.[tpl]cite web|title=明代广东海上丝绸之路的高度发展|url=http://eco.guoxue.com/article.php/15591/8|publisher=國學網－－中國經濟史論壇 (China Economic History Forum)|date=2008-03-16|author=黄啟臣|accessdate=26 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=明代广东海上丝绸之路的高度发展|url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/cbspub/secDetail.jsp?bookid=3222&secid=3254|publisher=中國評論學術出版社 (China Review Academic Publishers Unlimited)|accessdate=26 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]zh icon[/tpl] http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/cbspub/secDetail.jsp?bookid=3222&secid=3257[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.zhgpl.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCreate.jsp?coluid=56&kindid=1201&docid=100107474&mdate=0911123624 |title=中國評論新聞 |language=[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] |publisher=Zhgpl.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web |title=鄭和下西洋與廣東商人的海外移民|url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/0/7/4/100107474.html |publisher=中國評論新聞網 (chinareviewnews.com) |date=2006-03-08 |page=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100225145521/http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/0/7/4/100107474.html? |archivedate=2010-02-25 |accessdate=31 January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/0/7/4/100107474.html?coluid=56&kindid=1201&docid=100107474&mdate=0911123624 |title=中國評論新聞 |publisher=Chinareviewnews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24[/tpl][tpl]zh icon[/tpl] http://www.chinareviewnews.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCNML.jsp?coluid=55&kindid=1160&docid=100107474[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] http://www.chinareviewnews.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCNML.jsp?coluid=56&kindid=1201&docid=100151090[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/doc/1001/5/1/0/100151090.html?coluid=56&kindid=1201&docid=100151090&mdate=0911123624 |title=中國評論新聞 |publisher=Chinareviewnews.com |date=2006-06-01 |accessdate=2014-04-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chinareviewnews.com/crn-webapp/doc/docDetailCreate.jsp?coluid=56&kindid=1201&docid=100107474&mdate=0911123624 |title=中國評論新聞 |language=[tpl]zh icon[/tpl] |publisher=Chinareviewnews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=郑和下西洋与广东商人的海外移民人文历史|url=http://life.dayoo.com/edu/200910/20/75163_11076680.htm|publisher=广州日报大洋网 (life.dayoo.com)|date=2009-10-20  |accessdate=26 July 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=貿易、移殖與文化交流:15-17 世紀廣東人與越南|url=http://www.lib.cuhk.edu.hk/conference/occ/liqingxin.pdf|publisher=廣東省社會科學院歷史研究所 南開大學中國社會歷史研究中心|accessdate=5 January 2013|author=李慶新|page=12|quote=此外,沿海平民在海上航行或捕撈漁獵,遇風漂流至越南者時有發生。如成化十三年, 廣東珠池奉御陳彜奏:南海縣民遭風飄至安南被編入軍隊及被閹禁者超過 100 人。5成化中, 海南文昌人吳瑞與同鄉劉求等 13 人到欽州做生意,遇風飄至安南,當局將他們"俱發屯田, 以瑞獨少,宮之"。6... 6《明孝宗實錄》卷一百五十三,弘治十二年八月辛卯。[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=貿易、移殖與文化交流:15-17 世紀廣東人與越南|url=http://wenku.baidu.com/view/fc9a0cdd50e2524de5187e89.html|publisher=廣東省社會科學院歷史研究所 南開大學中國社會歷史研究中心|accessdate=5 January 2013|author=李慶新|page=12[/tpl]

A 1472 entry in the Ming Shilu reported that when some Chinese from Nanhai county escaped back to China after their ship had been blown off course into Vietnam, where they had been forced to serve as soldiers in Vietnam's military. The escapees also reported that they found out up to 100 Chinese men remained captive in Vietnam after they were caught and castrated by the Vietnamese after their ships were blown off course into Vietnam.

A 1499 entry in the Ming Shilu recorded that thirteen Chinese men from Wenchang including a young man named Wu Rui were captured by the Vietnamese after their ship was blown off course while traveling from Hainan to Guangdong's Qin subprefecture (Qinzhou), after which they ended up near the coast of Vietnam, during the Chenghua Emperor's rule (1447 - 1487) . Twelve of them were enslaved to work as agricultural laborers, while the youngest, Wu Rui (吳瑞) was selected for castration since he was the only young man and he became a eunuch attendant at the Vietnamese imperial palace in Thang Long. After years of service, he was promoted at the death of the Vietnamese ruler in 1497 to a military position in northern Vietnam. A soldier told him of an escape route back to China and Wu Rui escaped to Longzhou. The local chief planned to sell him back to the Vietnamese, but Wu was rescued by the Pingxiang magistrate and then was sent to Beijing to work as a eunuch in the palace.Lary (2007), p. 91 [tpl]Google books|pFzhWyoYG_wC|The Chinese State at the Borders|page=91[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1=Lary |first1=Diana |title=The Chinese State at the Borders|year=2007|publisher=UBC Press |isbn=0774813334 |url=http://www.history.ubc.ca/faculty/lshin/research/pdf/07_shin_ubcp.pdf |author2=Leo K.

Commoners were banned from undergoing castration in Vietnam, only adult men of high social rank could be castrated, most eunuchs were born as such with a congenital abnormality. The Vietnamese government mandated that boys born with defective genitalia were to be reported to officials, in exchange for the town being freed from mandatory labor requirements. The boy would have the option of serving as a eunuch official or serving the palace women when he became ten years old.Andaya (2006), p. 177 [tpl]Google books|tClCMl7hswQC|The Flaming Womb: Repositioning Women in Early Modern Southeast Asia|page=177[/tpl] This law was put in place in 1838 during the Nguyễn Dynasty.Woodside (1971), p. 66 [tpl]Google books|0LgSI9UQNpwC|Vietnam and the Chinese Model: A Comparative Study of Nguyen and Ch'ing Civil Government in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century|page=66[/tpl] The only males allowed inside the Forbidden City at Huế were the Emperor and his eunuchs.Fodor's (2012), p. 31 [tpl]Google books|j6EtDnQnnvAC|Fodor's See It Vietnam, 3rd Edition|page=31[/tpl]

===Ottoman Empire===

In the Ottoman Empire, eunuchs were typically slaves imported from outside their domains. A fair proportion of male slaves were imported as eunuchs.Lewis. Race and Slavery in the Middle East, Oxford Univ Press 1994.
The Ottoman court harem—within the Topkapı Palace (1465–1853) and later the Dolmabahçe Palace (1853–1909) in Istanbul—was under the administration of the eunuchs. These were of two categories: Black Eunuchs and White Eunuchs. Black Eunuchs were Africans who served the concubines and officials in the Harem together with chamber maidens of low rank. The White Eunuchs were Europeans from the Balkans. They served the recruits at the Palace School and were from 1582 prohibited from entering the Harem. An important figure in the Ottoman court was the Chief Black Eunuch (Kızlar Ağası or Dar al-Saada Ağası). In control of the Harem and a perfect net of spies in the Black Eunuchs, the Chief Eunuch was involved in almost every palace intrigue and could thereby gain power over either the sultan or one of his viziers, ministers or other court officials.Lad, Jateen. "Panoptic Bodies. Black Eunuchs in the Topkapi Palace", Scroope: Cambridge Architecture Journal, No.15, 2003, pp.16–20. One of the most powerful Chief Eunuchs was Beshir Agha who played a crucial role in establishing the Ottoman version of Hanafi Islam throughout the Empire by founding libraries and schools.[tpl]cite book|last=Hathaway|first=Jane|title=Beshir Agha : chief eunuch of the Ottoman imperial harem|year=2005|publisher=Oneworld|location=Oxford|isbn=1-85168-390-9|pages=xii, xiv[/tpl]
The eunuchs in the Ottoman Empire were created mainly at one Coptic monastery, at Abou Gerbe monastery on Mount Ghebel Eter. The Coptic priests sliced the penis and testicles off Nubian or Abyssinian slave boys around the age of eight.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=mz1YAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA522&dq=coptic+castrate+abyssinian#v=onepage&q=coptic%20castrate%20abyssinian&f=false|title=The American Journal of Urology and Sexology, Volume 15|author=Henry G.

The Coptic priests perform the 'complete' operation, that is, they cut away the whole scrotum, testes and penis." The boys were captured from Abyssinia and other areas in Sudan like Darfur and Kordofan, then brought into Sudan and Egypt. During the operation, the Coptic clergyman chained the boys to tables and after slicing off their sexual organs, stuck a piece of bamboo into the genital area, then submerged them in neck-high sand to burn. The recovery rate was ten percent. The resulting eunuchs fetched large profits in contrast to eunuchs from other areas.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ZhcTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA467&dq=coptic+castrate+abyssinian#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Northwestern lancet, Volume 17|author=|year=1897|publisher=s.n.|location=|isbn=|page=467|pages=|accessdate=11 January 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=D0OdC7GDJ6oC&pg=PA100&dq=coptic+castrate+abyssinian#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The African diaspora in the Mediterranean lands of Islam|author=John O.

===Indian subcontinent===

====Eunuchs in Indian Muslim sultanates (Before Mughals)====

Eunuchs were frequently employed in Imperial palaces by Muslim rulers as servants for female royalty, as guards of the royal harem, and as sexual mates for the nobles. Some of these attained high-status positions in society. An early example of such a high-ranking eunuch was Malik Kafur---a Hindu boy captured and enslaved (along with tens of thousands of other Hindus who were typically captured during such raids) during the raids of the Delhi Sultanate into Gujarat. He was made into a Eunuch, and on account of his good looks became a sexual favorite with Ala-ud-din Khilji. Zia-ud-din Barani describes in much detail the relations between him and Khilji. Kafur rose to become Malik Naib (head of the army) and led Khilji's expeditions into the South of India.
Eunuchs in Imperial palaces were organized in a hierarchy, often with a senior or chief eunuch (Urdu: Khwaja Saras) directing junior eunuchs below him. Eunuchs were highly valued for their strength, ability to provide protection for ladies' palaces and trustworthiness, allowing eunuchs to live amongst women with fewer worries. This enabled eunuchs to serve as messengers, watchmen, attendants and guards for palaces. Often, eunuchs also doubled as part of the King's court of advisers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00urduhindilinks/txt_akbar_birbal.html|title=Akbar-Birbal Anecdotes|accessdate=2 November 2008[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bharatvani.org/books/mssmi/ch9.htm|title=Ghilmans and Eunuchs|accessdate=2 November 2008[/tpl]

====The hijra of South Asia====

The Ancient Indian Kama Sutra refers to people of a "third sex" (triteeyaprakrti), who can be dressed either in men's or in women's clothes and perform fellatio on men. The term has been translated as "eunuchs" (as in Sir Richard Burton's translation of the book), but these persons have also been considered to be the equivalent of the modern hijra of India.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2009[/tpl]
Hijra, a Hindi and Urdu term traditionally translated into English as "eunuch", actually refers to what modern Westerners would call male-to-female transgender people and effeminate homosexuals (although some of them reportedly identify as belonging to a third sex). Some of them undergo ritual castration, but the majority do not. They usually dress in saris (traditional Indian garb worn by women) or shalwar kameez (traditional garb worn by women in South Asia) and wear heavy make-up. They typically live in the margins of society and face discrimination.Ravaging the Vulnerable: Abuses Against Persons at High Risk of HIV Infection in Bangladesh, Human Rights Watch, August 2003. Report online. See also: Peoples Union of Civil Liberties (Karnataka) Report on Human Rights Violations Against the Transgender Community, released in September 2003. Reported in Being a Eunuch, By Siddarth Narrain, for Frontline, 14 October 2003. However, they are integral to several Hindu ceremonies which is primary form of their livelihood. They are a part of dance programs (sometimes adult) in marriage ceremonies. They also perform certain ceremonies for the couple in Hindu tradition. Other means to earn their living are: by coming uninvited at weddings, births, new shop openings and other major family events and singing until they are paid or given gifts to go away.[ref]Eunuchs 'cut off man's penis'. By Baldev Chauhan, BBC correspondent in Himachal Pradesh. BBC News. Thursday, 24 July 2003.
[/ref]
The ceremony is supposed to bring good luck and fertility, while the curse of an unappeased hijra is feared by many. Other sources of income for the hijra are begging and prostitution. The begging is accompanied by singing and dancing and the hijras usually get the money easily. Some Indian provincial officials have used the assistance of hijras to collect taxes in the same fashion; they knock on the doors of shopkeepers, while dancing and singing, and embarrass them into paying.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSDEL3025420061110 |title=Dancing eunuchs taxing red-faced shopkeepers.

==Religious castration==

Castration as part of religious practice, and eunuchs occupying religious roles have been established prior to classical antiquity. Archaeological finds at Çatalhöyük in Anatolia indicate worship of a 'Magna Mater' figure, a forerunner of the goddess Cybele found in later Anatolia and other parts of the near East. Later Roman followers of Cybele, were called Galli, who practiced ritual self-castration, known as sanguinaria.[tpl]Cite journal| last= Roller | first= Lynn | title= In search of god the mother |publisher= University of California Press | year= 1999 | isbn= 978-0-520-21024-0 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=e9r2semlxPwC&q=castration| ref= harv[/tpl]

For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can." (NRSV)
Tertullian, a 2nd-century Church Father, described Jesus himself and Paul of Tarsus as spadones, which is translated as "eunuchs" in some contexts.[tpl]Cite journal| last= Moxnes | first= By Halvor | title= Putting Jesus in his place | publisher= Westminster John Knox Press | year= 2004 | page=85 | isbn= 978-0-664-22310-6 | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=zV0jVQK0K14C&q=spadones| ref= harv[/tpl] Quoting from the cited book: "... Tertullian takes 'spado' to mean virgin ...". The meaning of spado in late antiquity can be interpreted as a metaphor for celibacy, however Tertullian's specifically refers to St. Paul as being castrated.
Eunuch priests have served various goddesses from India for many centuries. Similar phenomena are exemplified by some modern Indian communities of the Hijra, which are associated with a deity and with certain rituals and festivals – notably the devotees of Yellammadevi, or jogappas, who are not castrated[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/people/yellamma/yellamma.htm |title=Yellamma cult of India |publisher=Kamat.com |accessdate=6 November 2010[/tpl] and the Ali of southern India, of whom at least some are.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/indologie/kolam/kolam1/alieng.html |title=The Mystery of the Threshold: "Ali" of Southern India |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2006-11-25 |accessdate=6 November 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061125041736/http://www.uni-koeln.de/phil-fak/indologie/kolam/kolam1/alieng.html |archivedate=2006-11-25[/tpl]

==Eunuchs in the Bible==

Eunuchs are mentioned many times in the Bible such as in the Book of Isaiah (56:4) using the word סריס (saris). Although the Ancient Hebrews did not practice castration, eunuchs were common in other cultures featured in the Bible, such as Ancient Egypt, Babylonia, the Persian Empire and Ancient Rome. In the Book of Esther, servants of the harem of Ahasuerus such as Hegai and Shashgaz as well as other servants such as Hatach, Harbonah, Bigthan, and Teresh are referred to as sarisim. Being exposed to the consorts of the king, they would have likely been castrated.
There is some confusion regarding eunuchs in Old Testament passages, since the Hebrew word for eunuch, saris (סריס), could also refer to other servants and officials who had not been castrated but served in similar capacities.The Old Testament Hebrew Lexicon at Heartlight.EUNUCH Biblical at Gender Tree. The Egyptian royal servant Potiphar is described as a saris in Genesis 39:1, although he was married and hence unlikely to have been a eunuch. The cupbearer who became governor of Judah, Nehemiah, may have been a eunuch.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl]
One of the earliest converts to Christianity was an Ethiopian eunuch who was a high court official of Candace the Queen of Ethiopia. Acts 8:27-39 The reference to "eunuchs" in Matthew 19:12 has yielded various interpretations.

==Non-castrated eunuchs==

Hippocrates describes a particular ethnic group afflicted with high rates of erectile dysfunction as "the most eunuchoid of all nations" (Airs Waters Places 22). According to Aristotle in Generation of Animals (1.2, 4.1), male or female gender is defined by the function played in procreation and consists of two elements: the faculty to procreate and the anatomical parts needed to put that faculty in practice. Any man who either lacked the faculty of procreation from birth, even with a full set of genitals (Gen.An. 2.7), or was eventually deprived of the anatomical parts necessary for procreation met the definition of a eunuch. Hence, the term "eunuch" was applied not only to castrated men, but also to a wide range of men who were unable to procreate. The broad sense of the term "eunuch" is reflected in the compendium of ancient Roman laws collected by Justinian I in the 6th century known as the Digest or Pandects. Those texts distinguish between the general category of eunuchs (spadones, denoting "one who has no generative power, an impotent person, whether by nature or by castration", D 50.16.128) and the more specific subset of castrati (castrated males, physically incapable of procreation). Eunuchs (spadones) sold in the slave markets were deemed by the jurist Ulpian to be "not defective or diseased, but healthy", because they were anatomically able to procreate just like monorchids (D 21.1.6.2). On the other hand, as Julius Paulus pointed out, "if someone is a eunuch in such a way that he is missing a necessary part of his body" (D 21.1.7), then he would be deemed diseased. In these Roman legal texts, spadones are eligible to marry women (D 23.3.39.1), institute posthumous heirs (D 28.2.6), and adopt children (Institutions of Justinian 1.11.9), unless they are castrati.

==Castrato singers==

Eunuchs castrated before puberty were also valued and trained in several cultures for their exceptional voices, which retained a childlike and other-worldly flexibility and treble pitch. Such eunuchs were known as castrati. Unfortunately the choice had to be made at an age when the boy would not yet be able to consciously choose whether to sacrifice his reproductive capabilities, and there was no guarantee that the voice would remain of musical excellence after the operation.
As women were sometimes forbidden to sing in Church, their place was taken by castrati. The practice, known as castratism, remained popular until the 18th century and was known into the 19th century. The last famous Italian castrato, Giovanni Velluti, died in 1861. The sole existing recording of a castrato singer documents the voice of Alessandro Moreschi, the last eunuch in the Sistine Chapel choir, who died in 1922.

==Eunuchs in the contemporary world==

The hijra of India (see above) may number as many as 2,000,000,Reddy, Gayatri, With Respect to Sex: Negotiating Hijra Identity in South India, 310 pp., University of Chicago Press, 2005 ISBN 0-226-70755-5 (see p. 8) and are usually described as eunuchs, although they may be more of a male-to-female transsexual individual, but have surgical castration instead of reassignment surgery, and seldom have access to hormones. The loss of testosterone and lack of estrogen means their bodies take on the characteristics of post-pubertal eunuchs.
The most commonly castrated men are advanced prostate cancer patients. In the United States alone there are more than 200,000 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed each year. It is estimated that over 80,000 of these men will be surgically or chemically castrated within six months of diagnosis.Shaninian, Vahakn B., et al. (2006), Determinants of Androgen Deprivation Therapy Use for Prostate Cancer: Role of the Urologist. Journal of the National Cancer Institute, vol. 98, pp. 839–45 With the average life expectancy after castration, there are approximately a half million chemically or surgically castrated prostate cancer patients at any time in the U.S. alone.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] While most of these men would deny the term "eunuch," they meet all physiological characteristics of post-pubertal eunuchs. Some do, however, embrace the term for the historic and psychological grounding that it gives them.http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/27/health/27case.htmlWassersug, Richard J. (2003). Castration anxiety. OUT, September 2003, pp. 66–72.
Convicted sex offenders who have been castrated are rare, although there is debate as to whether the drastic reduction of testosterone and the consequent diminishing of libido might have an effect on recidivism.Wille, Reinhard & Klaus M. Beier (1989), Castration in Germany. Annals of Sex Research, vol. 2, pp. 103–33
A study on eunuchs has found that they live 13.5 years longer than non-eunuch men as a result of a lack of testosterone, which suppresses the immune system, and its resultant negative effects on health.[tpl]cite web|author=Stay informed today and every day |url=http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21569362-rich-world-men-are-closing-longevity-gap-women-catching-up |title=Lifespan and the sexes: Catching up |publisher=The Economist |date=2013-01-12 |accessdate=2014-04-24[/tpl]
