E. pectinatus is widely used as a garden plant, especially in urban areas, because of its hardiness and its almost perpetual flowering regime. It grows best in full sun and well-drained deep soils. It must be grown in a sheltered location, away from frost-prone areas. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.[tpl]cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - Euryops pectinatus|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=2928|accessdate=19 June 2013[/tpl]
