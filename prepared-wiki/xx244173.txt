CATEGORIES: 2009 singles, Songs written by Julian Casablancas

"11th Dimension" is a song by Julian Casablancas and is the lead single from his debut album Phrazes for the Young. It was first performed live on the talk show The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien on October 27, 2009. Pitchfork Media awarded the track as "Best New Track" and rated "11th Dimension" the 66th best song of 2009, calling it "the strongest Julian's sounded since Room on Fire. It's a blast of retro-futuristic synths, steam-rolling guitar licks, and slicing, dicing hi-hat, and the busy pulse of the production cuts through the detachment and manages to convey a sense of fun, as if he's finally enjoying the creative experience".Aaron Leitko(1 October 2009).Julian Casablancas: "11th Dimension" Pitchfork Media.
