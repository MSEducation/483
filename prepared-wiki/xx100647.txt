Elizabeth Hubbard (born December 22, 1933, New York City, New York) is an American film, soap opera, stage and television actress, best known for her roles as Dr. Althea Davis on The Doctors (1964-1969, 1970-1978, 1981-1982) and Lucinda Walsh on As the World Turns (1984-2010).
She attended Radcliffe College, and graduated summa cum laude. She pursued her theatrical education at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, where she was the first American to receive the school's silver medal. She was married to furrier David Bennett from 1970 to 1972; they had one child, a son, Jeremy Bennett (born 1971).

==Soap operas==

She is known for her work in daytime soap operas. She began that career in 1962, starring as Anne Fletcher on Guiding Light. The following year, she joined the cast of The Edge of Night as Carol Kramer.
In 1964, she originated the role of Dr. Althea Davis on NBC's year-old soap The Doctors. Hubbard played the role until 1969, when she took time off. She returned after a year and continued the role until 1978. She returned again in 1981 and remained with the show until its cancellation in 1982. In 1974, Hubbard was awarded the first Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series.
After that serial was cancelled, Hubbard was on One Life to Live for the recurring role of Estelle Chadwick for almost a year. In 1984, however, she debut in her best-known role, that of businesswoman Lucinda Walsh on As the World Turns. She was nominated nine times for a Daytime Emmy for her portrayal of Lucinda. Hubbard left the program in 1999 due to a disagreement over the direction of her character; she was persuaded to return months later by the show's new executive producer. Hubbard was featured in a prominent storyline in 2005 when her character was diagnosed with cancer. She was in the show's 50th anniversary episode in April 2006, and stayed with the show until its final episode in September 2010.
In July 2009 she started a recurring role on the Dutch soap Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden, and played the role of Sair Poindexter, an American sexologist and mother of the Irene Huygens (Anita Donk) character. Hubbard, who traveled frequently to the Dutch province of Friesland where her boyfriend resides, was cast after meeting the writers on one of her visits. (As The World Turns also airs in the Netherlands and Hubbard was already well-known there as a result.)

==Other work==

Hubbard won an additional Daytime Emmy for her portrayal of Edith Wilson in First Ladies' Diaries. She was featured in Broadway plays and musicals, and had roles in movies, including I Never Sang for My Father, Ordinary People, and The Ceremony of Innocence and a featured role in the film Center Stage.
