==History==

McIntosh Reserve is named for William McIntosh, Jr., a prominent Creek Indian leader and plantation owner.  The plantation was known as Lochau Talofau, which in English means "Acorn Bluff."  McIntosh lived in a modest home, a two-story log house with a central, open "dog run" passage on both floors.  The house doubled as an inn for travelers.  A reconstructed house is open to park visitors today.BBC - McIntosh Reserve. Accessed April 28, 2008.
In 1825, McIntosh signed the second Treaty of Indian Springs.  The treaty essentially sold all Creek lands to the government; however, McIntosh was allowed to keep his plantation in exchange for signing the treaty.  Many Creek Indians were infuriated by the treaty and murdered McIntosh.  Carroll County acquired Lochau Talofau in 1978; the plantation now lies within McIntosh Reserve boundaries.
William McIntosh's single-plot, military grave may be found just across the road from the reconstructed house.
McIntosh Reserve Park was closed for several months in 2009 and 2010, following the September 2009 flooding on the Chattahoochee River. The park is scheduled to reopen for Memorial Day weekend, 2010.
