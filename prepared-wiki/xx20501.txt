[[X-wing]]

CATEGORIES: Star Wars starfighters

X-wings are fictional starfighters from the original Star Wars trilogy and the expanded universe. They are depicted as the primary interceptor and dogfighter of the Rebel Alliance and the New Republic. The craft has been merchandised as a variety of toys and models and licensed for use in games, novels and comics.

==Origin and design==

Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) Joe Johnston sketched and Colin Cantwell built models that eventually became the final X-wing fighter in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/xwing/?id=bts |title=X-wing starfighter (Behind the Scenes) |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Database |accessdate=2007-10-16[/tpl] The X-wings were designed to appear more "traditional" than the Empire's TIE fighters.[tpl]cite book |first=Lorne |last=Peterson |title=Sculpting A Galaxy: Inside the Star Wars Model Shop |date=2006-11-14 |publisher=Insight Editions |isbn=1-933784-03-2[/tpl] ILM built miniatures in various scales, with wing markings indicating which prop represented which pilot. When ILM fell behind on generating X-wing footage, Star Wars producer George Lucas and his editors temporarily used World War II dogfight footage for initial editing cuts.[tpl]cite video |people=Burns, Kevin and Edith Becker |date=2004 |title=Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy |medium=Documentary[/tpl] Each X-wing model was built around a hollow core made from surgical tubing, which allowed lighting, cooling, and electrical connectors for the wing motors to be installed and maintained. The cockpit windows were made from faceted glass so that accurate reflections could be filmed. Although the movie's initial script and novelization describe the X-wings as belonging to "Blue squadron", limitations in bluescreen photography led to the markings on the filming models, as well as the fictional squadron affiliation being changed to red.
In addition to miniatures, the production crew made a single, full-size X-wing for scenes in the Rebels' Yavin IV base hangar; combined with cardboard cutouts and careful editing, the Rebels appear to have dozens of fighters. The production crew also made a full-size X-wing cockpit that was used for all actors; the astromech droid visible behind each actor was changed for each starfighter.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/redleader/?id=bts |title=Red Leader (Behind the Scenes) |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Database |accessdate=2007-10-16[/tpl] Background noise pitch and tone also varied between X-wings to further differentiate the characters piloting them.Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope - Audio Commentary (2004). 1:49.05 - 1:05.00
The "lake" in which Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) crashes his X-wing in Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back was only [tpl]convert|3.5|ft|m[/tpl] deep, requiring the creation of a rig resembling the starfighter sitting in the lake at an angle.Kershner, Irvin. Star Wars Episode IV: The Empire Strikes Back - Audio Commentary (2004). 1:06.39-1:07.40 The rig was built in hinged sections so it could be manipulated by frogmen to sink or rise, a key feature for the scene when Luke fails to levitate his ship from the water.
In 1993, ILM visual effects specialist John Knoll created a proof of concept test of dogfighting X-wings and TIE fighters to demonstrate the feasibility of using commercially-available desktop computer software for simple animation work.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/production/beacon145.html |title=The Evolution of Space Battles |accessdate=2007-10-16 |date=2005-09-15 |work=Homing Beacon |publisher=Lucasfilm |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071112044001/http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/production/beacon145.html  |archivedate = 2007-11-12[/tpl] This resulted in numerous parts of space battle scenes being "re-shot" as digital animations for original trilogy's Special Edition releases. The ARC-170 starfighter seen in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith is deliberately reminiscent of the X-wing's design.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/arc170fighter/?id=bts |work=Star Wars Databank |publisher=Lucasfilm |title=ARC-170 starfighter (Behind the Scenes) |accessdate=2007-10-14[/tpl]

==Depiction==

The Expanded Universe states that Incom Corporation designers defected to the Rebel Alliance and handed over the X-wing's design.[tpl]cite book |title=Star Wars Roleplaying Game |edition=Second Edition, Expanded & Revised |publisher=West End Games |year=1996 |isbn=0-87431-435-6[/tpl] One design of the Z-95 Headhunter is based on an initial Johnston X-wing sketch;[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/starship/z95headhunter/?id=bts |title=Z-95 Headhunter (Behind the Scenes) |accessdate=2007-10-16 |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Databank[/tpl] the Z-95 has since been described as an X-wing precursor.
According to roleplaying and other material, X-wings depicted in the movies and Expanded Universe material that takes place around the same era are equipped with four laser cannons and a pair of proton torpedo launchers. The fighter has two flight modes: one in which the wings are flat and another when they are expanded into "attack position", affording the wingtip lasers a larger fire area. "S-foil" servomotors control the transition between the two, hence the expression "to lock s-foils in attack position".[tpl]cite book |title=Rebel Alliance Sourcebook |publisher=West End Games |date=April 1994  |isbn=0-87431-209-4[/tpl] Lacking an on-board navigation computer, they rely on an astromech droid to calculate hyperspace jumps. The presence of a hyperdrive and deflector shields differentiate the X-wing from the Empire's TIE fighters, emphasizing the importance the Rebels place on pilots surviving their missions. Novels and roleplaying material state that the X-wing continues to be refined and upgraded in the years beyond Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi; the "XJ"-series X-wings depicted in the war against the Yuuzhan Vong have a third proton torpedo launcher, stronger lasers, and improved engines.[tpl]cite book |title=The New Jedi Order Sourcebook |first=J.D. |last=Walker |coauthors=Steve Miller |isbn=0-7869-2777-1 |publisher=Wizards of the Coast |date=2002-02-01[/tpl]

==Merchandise and licensing==

Kenner Toys produced an X-wing toy as a complement to its action figure line in 1977, complete with pilot figure; this model was made from formed plastic and had a battery-operated light and buzzer in the forward fuselage. The "s-foils" were activated by depressing the molded astromech droid. Kenner also produced a die-cast 1:72 miniature X-Wing in 1978 and a smaller scaled version with "battle damage crash feature" for the short lived Micro Collection line in 1982.
The X-wing appeared in four Micro Machines three-packs, including the first Star Wars pack released, a bronzed version, and a pack of three "battle damaged" X-wings with different colored markings.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/12967 |title=#1: X-wing, Millennium Falcon, Star Destroyer (1993) |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Cargo Bay |accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/11792 |title=#III: Darth Vader's TIE Fighter, Y-wing, X-wing (1995) |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Cargo Bay |accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/11801 |title=#XIII: Battle-damaged X-wings (red, blue, and green) (1997) |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Cargo Bay |accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/11805 |title=Bronze 3-pack: AT-AT, Snowspeeder, X-wing |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Cargo Bay |accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl] The Micro Machines X-wing has also been released in two single-packs, as a promotional souvenir with German video releases, in a nine-pack of Original Trilogy vehicles, and once in clear plastic.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/11980 |title=Single carded vehicle: X-wing Starfighter (1995) |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Cargo Bay |accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/13031 |title=Single carded vehicle: X-wing Starfighter (bronze) |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Cargo Bay |accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/12963 |title=Trilogy Gift Set |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Cargo Bay |accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/11811 |title=X-Ray Fleet #II: X-wing, AT-AT |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Cargo Bay |accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl] The X-wing appears eight times in the Micro Machines Action Fleet toy line: Luke's starfighter on its own,[tpl]cite web |url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/11925 |title=Luke's X-wing Starfighter |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Cargo Bay |accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl] with "targeter" stand,[tpl]cite web |url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/12765 |title=Flight Controllers - X-wing Fighter |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Cargo Bay |accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl] with Dagobah swamp damage,[tpl]cite web |url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/11924 |title=Luke's X-wing from Dagobah Swamp |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Cargo Bay |accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl] and in a double pack with a TIE Fighter,[tpl]cite web |url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/11982 |title=Classic Duels: X-wing Fighter vs. TIE Fighter |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Cargo Bay |accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl] Wedge's starfighter on its own,[tpl]cite web |url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/11937 |title=X-wing (2 stripes)|publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Cargo Bay |accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl] and as a component of the Yavin Rebel Base playset,[tpl]cite web |url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/11950 |title=Yavin Rebel Base playset (Action Fleet Set) |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Cargo Bay |accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl] a toy based on the prototype packaged with Biggs Darklighter's starfighter,[tpl]cite web |url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/11946 |title=Series Alpha: X-wing Starfighter |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Cargo Bay |accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl] and Jek Porkins' starfighter.[tpl]cite web |url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/11811 |title=X-wing (6 stripes) |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Cargo Bay |accessdate=2007-09-01[/tpl] Lego also released several X-wing models, including a 76-piece miniature X-wing/TIE advanced kit,[tpl]cite web |title=Mini X-wing Fighter and TIE Advanced |url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/9197 |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Cargo Bay |accessdate=2007-10-16[/tpl] a 263-piece X-wing (1999/2002), a 563-piece X-wing kit with Yoda's Hut (2004), a 437-piece X-Wing (2006),[tpl]cite web |url=http://cargobay.starwars.com/webapps/cargobay/item-detail/1828 |title=X-Wing Fighter |publisher=Lucasfilm |work=Star Wars Cargo Bay |accessdate=2007-10-16[/tpl] and a 560-piece X-wing (2012).

X-wings also appear in numerous Star Wars games and Expanded Universe stories. The player pilots an X-wing in the Atari Star Wars game. It is also a playable ship in numerous LucasArts games, and is the eponymous vessel in the first of several space combat simulator games. Both the Rebel Assault and Rebel Assault II rail shooters include X-wing levels, and X-wing squadrons are controllable units in the Rebellion and Empire at War strategy games. Decipher and Wizards of the Coast published X-wing and X-wing-related cards for the Star Wars Customizable Card Game and Star Wars Trading Card Game, respectively.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.decipher.com/starwars/cardlists/swallcards.pdf |title=Star Wars Customizable Card Game Complete Card List |accessdate=2007-08-23 |publisher=Decipher, Inc. |date=2001-08-23 |format=PDF[/tpl] Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston wrote the X-wing novel series that focuses on the X-wing pilots of Rogue Squadron and Wraith Squadron, the former expanding the story of pilots like Wedge Antilles who appear in the films. Dark Horse Comics has also published an X-Wing Rogue Squadron series.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.darkhorse.com/profile/profile.php?sku=13-749 |title= Star Wars: Omnibus--X-Wing Rogue Squadron Vol. 1 TPB |accessdate=2007-10-16 |publisher=Dark Horse Comics[/tpl]
