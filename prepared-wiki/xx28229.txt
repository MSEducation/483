[[Sepharvaim]]

CATEGORIES: Hebrew Bible places

Sepharvaim - taken by a king of Assyria, probably Sargon II, (claimed in the Old Testament in 2 Kings 17:24; 18:34; 19:13;
Isa. 37:13).
It was a double city, and received the common name Sepharvaim, i.e., "the two Sipparas," or "the two booktowns."
The Sippara on the east bank of the Euphrates is now called Abu-Habba;
that on the other bank was Accad, the old capital of Sargon I, where he established a great library.
The recent discovery of cuneiform inscriptions at Tel el-Amarna in Egypt, consisting of official despatches to Pharaoh Amenophis IV. and his predecessor from their agents in Palestine, leads some Egyptologists to conclude that in the century before the Exodus an active literary intercourse was carried on between these nations, and that the medium of the correspondence was the Babylonian language and script. 
(See Kirjath-Sepher.) However, it has not been conclusively proven which Egyptian Pharaoh the Amarna Letters reference or that the Judean Exodus necessarily occurred after these letters.
Sepharvaim was the centre of the worship of the god Adramelech. They also worshipped the god Anamelech. After the deportation of the Israelite tribes, at least some of the residents of this city were brought to Samaria to repopulate it with other Gentile settlers.
