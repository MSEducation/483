==Stores==

Bristol Mall has the usual mix of restaurants, mall services, fast food, and other typical mall stores, as well as a movie theater. There are also eight food establishments including Chick-Fil-A.  Piccadilly Cafeterias, an original Bristol Mall tenant since the mall's opening in the 1970s closed on May 23, 2011 when its lease expired. With Bristol being the home of country music, long before Knoxville or Nashville, for many years there has been a museum at the mall, showcasing the legacy this left to the area.[tpl]cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=High Notes for the Future | date= | publisher=tricities.com | url =http://www.tricities.com/tri/news/local/article/-TRI_2008_03_02_0039/7056/ | work =tricities.com | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-05 | language = [/tpl]
Late 2008 and early 2009 was a hard time for the mall. It lost Subway, KB Toys, B. Dalton, Friedman's Jewelers, Foot Locker, Pretzel Twister, Villa Pizza, and the Wellmont Healthcare location. Also Village Theaters sold the 5 screen movie theater to Visionary Theaters who later closed the theater. Both groups are Chicago based. 
Belk will relocate to Bristol, Tennessee to "The Pinnacle" a new shopping center, it expected to open in 2015, and the store in the mall will close. JCPenney will also be closing, that makes Sears the only anchor left in the mall.
