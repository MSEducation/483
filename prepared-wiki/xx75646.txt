[[Alu element]]

CATEGORIES: Repetitive DNA sequences

An Alu element is a short stretch of DNA originally characterized by the action of the Alu (Arthrobacter luteus) restriction endonuclease.[tpl]cite journal|author= Schmid CW, Deininger PL| title=Sequence organization of the human genome| journal=Cell | year=1975 | volume=6|pages=345–358| doi=10.1016/0092-8674(75)90184-1| pmid=1052772 [/tpl]  Alu elements of different kinds occur in large numbers in primate genomes. In fact, Alu elements are the most abundant transposable elements in the human genome. They are derived from the small cytoplasmic 7SL RNA, a component of the signal recognition particle. The event, when a copy of the 7SL RNA became a precursor of the Alu elements, took place in the genome of an ancestor of Supraprimates.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kriegs JO, Churakov G, Jurka J, Brosius J, Schmitz J |title=Evolutionary history of 7SL RNA-derived SINEs in Supraprimates |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=158–61 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17307271 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2007.02.002 | url=http://zmbe2.uni-muenster.de/expath/articles/31_Kriegs_TiG.pdf[/tpl]
Alu insertions have been implicated in several inherited human diseases and in various forms of cancer.
The study of Alu elements has also been important in elucidating
human population genetics and the evolution of primates, including the evolution of humans.

==The Alu family==

The Alu family is a family of repetitive elements in the human genome. Modern Alu elements are about 300 base pairs long and are therefore classified as short interspersed elements (SINEs) among the class of repetitive DNA elements. The typical structure is 5'Part A- A5TACA6 -Part B - PolyA Tail - 3', where Part A and Part B are similar nucleotide sequences, but of opposite direction.  Expressed another way, it is believed modern Alu elements emerged from a head to tail fusion of two distinct FAMs (fossil antique monomers) over 100 mkya, hence its dimeric structure of two similar, but distinct monomers (left and right arms, and in opposite directions) joined by an A-rich linker.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hasler J, Strub K,  |title=Alu elements as regulators of gene expression |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=34 |issue=19 |pages=5491–5497 |year=2006 |pmc=1636486 |pmid=17020921 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkl706[/tpl] The length of the polyA tail varies between Alu families.
There are over one million Alu elements interspersed throughout the human genome, and it is estimated that about 10.7% of the human genome consists of Alu sequences. However, less than 0.5% are polymorphic (i.e. they occur in more than one form or morph).[tpl]cite journal |author=Roy-Engel AM, Carroll ML, Vogel E, et al. |title=Alu insertion polymorphisms for the study of human genomic diversity |journal=Genetics |volume=159 |issue=1 |pages=279–90 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11560904 |pmc=1461783 [/tpl] In 1988, Jerzy Jurka and Temple Smith discovered that Alu elements were split in two major subfamilies known as AluJ and AluS, and other Alu subfamilies were also independently discovered by several groups.[tpl]cite journal |author=Jurka J and Smith T' |title=A fundamental division in the Alu family of repeated sequences |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=85 |issue=July |pages=279–90 |date=July 1988 [/tpl] Later on, a sub-subfamily of AluS which included active Alu elements was given the separate name AluY. The discovery of Alu subfamilies led to the hypothesis of master/source genes, and provided the definitive link between transposable elements (active elements) and interspersed repetitive DNA (mutated copies of active elements).[tpl]cite journal |author=Shen MR, Batzer MA,Deininger PL |title=Evolution of the master Alu gene(s) |journal= J. Mol. Evol. |volume=33 |issue= 4 |pages=311–320 |date=October 1991 [/tpl]

The functional retinoic acid response element hexamer sites [tpl]cite journal|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA|volume=92|pages=8229–8233|date=August 1995|title=The consensus sequence of a major Alu subfamily contains a functional retinoic acid response element|author=Vansant G and Reynolds WF|pmid=7667273|doi=10.1073/pnas.92.18.8229|issue=18|pmc=41130[/tpl] are in upper case and overlap the internal transcriptional promoter. The recognition sequence of the Alu endonuclease is 5' AG/CT 3'; that is, the enzyme cuts the DNA segment between the guanine and cytosine residues (in bold above).

==Alu elements==

Alu elements are retrotransposons and look like DNA copies made from RNA polymerase III-encoded RNAs. Alu elements do not encode for protein products and depend on LINE retrotransposons for their replication.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kramerov DA, Vassetzky NS |title=Short retroposons in eukaryotic genomes |url=http://kit.eimb.relarn.ru/PDF/Kramerov_05_IRC.pdf |journal=Int. Rev. Cytol. |volume=247 |issue= |pages=165–221 |year=2005 |pmid=16344113 |doi=10.1016/S0074-7696(05)47004-7 [/tpl]
Alu elements in primates form a fossil record that is relatively easy to decipher because Alu elements insertion events have a characteristic signature that is both easy to read and faithfully recorded in the genome from generation to generation.  The study of Alu elements thus reveals details of ancestry because individuals will only share a particular Alu element insertion if they have a common ancestor.
Most human Alu element insertions can be found in the corresponding positions in the genomes of other primates, but about 7,000 Alu insertions are unique to humans.[tpl]cite journal |title=Initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7055 |pages=69–87 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16136131 |doi=10.1038/nature04072 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7055/full/nature04072.html |author=And Analysis Consortium, The Chimpanzee Sequencing[/tpl]

==Impact of Alu in humans==

Alu elements are a common source of mutation in humans, but such mutations are often confined to non-coding regions where they have little discernible impact on the bearer.[tpl]cite journal|author=International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium| title=Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome| journal=Nature| year=2001 | volume=409|pages=860–921| doi=10.1038/35057062| url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6822/abs/409860a0.html| pmid=11237011| issue=6822[/tpl]  (That is, a given mutation may not cause any difference to exist might cause only a small difference to exist in the phenotype of the individual whose DNA contains that mutation—relative to what that phenotype would have been without that mutation, but with "other things being equal" is, with all other parts of the genotype being the same.)  However, the variation generated can be used in studies of the movement and ancestry of human populations[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl], and the mutagenic effect of Alu[tpl]cite journal|author=Shen S, Lin L, Cai JJ, Jiang P, Kenkel EJ, Stroik MR, Sato S, Davidson BL, Xing Y| title=Widespread establishment and regulatory impact of Alu exons in human genes| journal=PNAS| year=2011 | volume=108|pages=2837–42| doi=10.1073/pnas.1012834108| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/7/2837| issue=7[/tpl] and retrotransposons in general[tpl]cite journal|author=Cordaux R, Batzer MA| title=The impact of retrotransposons on human genome evolution| journal=Nature Reviews Genetics| year=2009 | volume=10|pages=691–703| doi=10.1038/nrg2640| url=http://rcordaux.voila.net/pdfs/42.pdf| pmid=19763152| pmc=2884099[/tpl] has played a major role in the recent evolution of the human genome. There are also a number of cases where Alu insertions or deletions are associated with specific effects in humans:

===Associations with human disease===

Alu insertions are sometimes disruptive and can result in inherited disorders. However, most Alu variation acts as markers that segregate with the disease so the presence of a particular Alu allele does not mean that the carrier will definitely get the disease.  The first report of Alu-mediated recombination causing a prevalent inherited predisposition to cancer was a 1995 report about hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nyström-Lahti M, Kristo P, Nicolaides NC, et al. |title=Founding mutations and Alu-mediated recombination in hereditary colon cancer |journal=Nat. Med. |volume=1 |issue=11 |pages=1203–6 |date=November 1995 |pmid=7584997 |doi=10.1038/nm1195-1203 [/tpl]
The following human diseases have been linked with Alu insertions:[tpl]cite journal |author=Batzer MA, Deininger PL |title=Alu repeats and human genomic diversity |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=370–9 |date=May 2002 |pmid=11988762 |doi=10.1038/nrg798 |url=http://batzerlab.lsu.edu/Publications/Batzer%20and%20Deininger%202002%20Nature%20Reviews%20Genetics.pdf[/tpl]
And the following diseases have been associated with single-nucleotide DNA variations in Alu elements impacting transcription levels:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs2333227|title=SNPedia: SNP in the promoter region of the myeloperoxidase MPO gene[/tpl]
