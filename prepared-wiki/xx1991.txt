Christology (from Greek Χριστός Khristós and [tpl]lang|grc|-λογία[/tpl], -logia) is the field of study within Christian theology which is primarily concerned with the nature and person of Jesus Christ as recorded in the canonical Gospels and the epistles of the New Testament.Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus by Gerald O'Collins 2009 ISBN 0-19-955787-X pages 1-3 Primary considerations include the relationship of Jesus' nature and person with the nature and person of God the Father. As such, Christology is concerned with the details of Jesus' ministry, his acts and teachings, to arrive at a clearer understanding of who he is in his person, and his role in salvation.Catholic encyclopedia: Christology A major component of the Christology of the Apostolic Age was that of Paul the Apostle. His central themes were the notion of the pre-existence of Christ and the worship of Christ as Kyrios (Greek: Lord).''Christ in Christian Tradition: From the Apostolic Age to Chalcedon' by Aloys Grillmeier, John Bowden 1975 ISBN 0-664-22301-X pages 15-19 http://books.google.com/books?id=LH-cBwmmY2cC&pg=PA15&dq=Pauline+Christology&hl=en&ei=udXdTJ7NAYvHswa0lKCLDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=Pauline%20Christology&f=false
The pre-existence of Christ is considered a central theme of Christology. Proponents of Christ's deity argue the Old Testament has many cases of Christophany: "The pre-existence of Christ is further substantiated by the many recorded Christophanies in the Bible."Theology for Today by Elmer L. Towns 2008 ISBN 0-15-516138-5 page 173 Christophany is often considered a more accurate term than the term Theophany due to the belief that all the visible manifestations of God (or Yahweh) are in fact the preincarnate Christ. Many argue that the appearances of "the Angel of the Lord" in the Old Testament were the preincarnate Christ. "Many understand the angel of the Lord as a true theophany. From the time of Justin on, the figure has been regarded as the preincarnate Logos.""Angel of the Lord" by T. E. McComiskey in The Evangelical Dictionary of Theology 2001 ISBN 0-8010-2075-1 page 62
Following the Apostolic Age, there was fierce and often politicized debate in the early church on many interrelated issues. Christology was a major focus of these debates, and was addressed at every one of the first seven ecumenical councils. The second through fourth of these councils are generally entitled "Christological councils," with the latter three mainly elucidating what was taught in them and condemning incorrect interpretations.[tpl]Citation|last=Davis, SJ|first=Leo Donald|title=The First Seven Ecumenical Councils (325-787): Their History and Theology (Theology and Life Series 21)|year=1990|publisher=Michael Glazier/Liturgical Press|location=Collegeville, MN|isbn=978-0-8146-5616-7|pages=342[/tpl] The Council of Chalcedon in 451 issued a formulation of the being of Christ — that of two natures, one human and one divine, "united with neither confusion nor division." This is called the doctrine of the hypostatic union, which is still held today amongst most Protestant, Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox Christians, referred to as Chalcedonian Christianity. Due to politically charged differences in the 4th century, schisms developed, and the first denominations (from the Latin, "to take a new name") formed.
In the 13th century, Saint Thomas Aquinas provided the first systematic Christology that consistently resolved a number of the existing issues.[tpl]Citation|last=Gilson|first=Etienne|title=The Christian Philosophy of Saint Thomas Aquinas|year=1994|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|location=Notre Dame, IN|isbn=978-0-268-00801-7|pages=502[/tpl] In his Christology from above, Aquinas also championed the principle of perfection of Christ's human attributes.Christology: Biblical And Historical by Mini S.

==Terms and concepts==

Over the centuries, a number of terms and concepts have been developed within the framework of Christology to address the seemingly simple questions: "who was Jesus and what did he do?" A good deal of theological debate has ensued and significant schisms within Christian denominations took place in the process of providing answers to these questions. After the Middle Ages, systematic approaches to Christology were developed.
The term "Christology from above" refers to approaches that begin with the divinity and pre-existence of Christ as the Logos (the Word), as expressed in the prologue to the Gospel of John ([tpl]bibleref|John|1:1-14|ESV[/tpl]). These approaches interpret the works of Christ in terms of his divinity. Christology from above was emphasized in the ancient Church, beginning with Ignatius of Antioch in the second century.Jesus God and Man by Wolfhart Pannenberg 1968 ISBN 0-664-24468-8 page 33 The term "Christology from below", on the other hand, refers to approaches that begin with the human aspects and the ministry of Jesus (including the miracles, parables, etc.) and move towards his divinity and the mystery of incarnation.Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus by Gerald O'Collins 2009 ISBN 0-19-955787-X pages 16-17
The concept of "Cosmic Christology", first elaborated by Saint Paul, focuses on how the arrival of Jesus as the Son of God forever changed the nature of the cosmos.The Witness of Jesus, Paul and John: An Exploration in Biblical Theology by Larry R. Helyer 2008 ISBN 0-8308-2888-5 page 282 The terms "functional", "ontological" and "soteriological" have been used to refer to the perspectives that analyze the "works", the "being" and the "salvific" standpoints of Christology.Christology from within and ahead by Mark L. Y. Chan 2001 ISBN 90-04-11844-6 pages 59-62 http://books.google.com/books?id=9NQJ74t0aE4C&pg=PA59&dq=ontological+christology&hl=en&ei=n6rfTOTAJM2Kswbao6X8Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=ontological%20christology&f=false Some essential sub-topics within the field of Christology include the incarnation, the resurrection, and salvation.
The term "monastic Christology" has been used to describe spiritual approaches developed by Anselm of Canterbury, Peter Abelard and Bernard of Clairvaux. The Franciscan piety of the 12th and 13th centuries led to "popular Christology". Systematic approaches by theologians, such as Thomas Aquinas, are called "scholastic Christology".Christology: Biblical And Historical by Mini S. Johnson, 2005 ISBN 81-8324-007-0 pages 74-76 http://books.google.com/books?id=Aa3yRbs0tisC&pg=PA74&dq=christology+franciscan&hl=en&ei=px3jTNHFJc3BswaKu7XnCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=christology%20franciscan&f=false

==Beginnings==

Early Christians found themselves confronted with a set of new concepts and ideas relating to the life, death and resurrection of Jesus, as well the notions of salvation and redemption, and had to use a new set of terms, images and ideas to deal with them.Christianity: an introduction by Alister E. McGrath pages 2006 ISBN 1-4051-0901-7 137-141 The existing terms and structures available to them were often insufficient to express these religious concepts, and taken together, these new forms of discourse led to the beginnings of Christology as an attempt to understand, explain and discuss their understanding of the nature of Christ.
Furthermore, as early Christians (following the Great Commission) had to explain their concepts to a new audience which
had at times been influenced by Greek philosophy, they had to present arguments that at times
resonated with, and at times confronted, the beliefs of that audience. A key example is the Apostle Paul's Areopagus sermon that appears in [tpl]bibleverse||Acts|17:16-34|NIV|[/tpl]. Here, the apostle attempted to convey the underlying concepts about Christ to a Greek audience, and the sermon illustrates some key elements of future Christological discourses that were first brought forward by Paul.Creation and redemption: a study in Pauline theology by John G. Gibbs 1971 Brill Publishers pages 151-153Mercer Commentary on the New Testament by Watson E. Mills 2003 ISBN 0-86554-864-1 pages 1109-1110
The Kyrios title for Jesus is central to the development of New Testament Christology, for the early Christians placed it at the center of their understanding, and from that center attempted to understand the other issues related to the Christian mysteries.Christology: Biblical And Historical by Mini S. Johnson, 2005 ISBN 81-8324-007-0 pages 229-235 http://books.google.com/books?id=Aa3yRbs0tisC&pg=PA231&dq=Kyrios+christology&hl=en&ei=hTbeTIlPzfiyBoT30fUL&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Kyrios%20christology&f=false The question of the deity of Christ in the New Testament is inherently related to the Kyrios title of Jesus used in the early Christian writings and its implications for the absolute lordship of Jesus. In early Christian belief, the concept of Kyrios included the pre-existence of Christ, for they believed if Christ is one with God, he must have been united with God from the very beginning.The Christology of the New Testament by Oscar Cullmann 1959 ISBN 0-664-24351-7 pages 234-237 http://books.google.com/books?id=79Zovlpi8uQC&pg=PA234&dq=Kyrios&hl=en&ei=WtjdTIyAHcfzsgb_qbCTDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Kyrios&f=false
In everyday Aramaic, Mari was a very respectful form of polite address, which means more than just "Teacher" and was somewhat similar to Rabbi. In Greek, this has at times been translated as Kyrios. While the term Mari expressed the relationship between Jesus and his disciples during his life, the Greek Kyrios came to represent his lordship over the world.The Christology of the New Testament by Oscar Cullmann 1959 ISBN 0-664-24351-7 page 202 http://books.google.com/books?id=79Zovlpi8uQC&pg=PA202&dq=mari+aramaic+jesus&hl=en&ei=DUDeTMDXGoT2sgbW5tmEDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=mari%20aramaic%20jesus&f=false

===Apostolic Christology===

No writings were left by Jesus, and the study of the various Christologies of the Apostolic Age is based on early Christian documents. The Gospels provide episodes from the life of Jesus and some of his works, but the authors of the New Testament show little interest in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life,Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi by Karl Rahner 2004 ISBN 0-86012-006-6 page 731 and as in John 21:25, the Gospels do not claim to be an exhaustive list of his works.
Christologies that can be gleaned from the three Synoptic Gospels generally emphasize the humanity of Jesus, his sayings, his parables, and his miracles. The Gospel of John provides a different perspective that focuses on his divinity. The first 14 verses of the Gospel of John are devoted to the divinity of Jesus as the Logos, usually translated as "Word", along with his pre-existence, and they emphasize the cosmic significance of Christ, e.g. [tpl]bibleverse||John|1:3|ESV[/tpl]: "All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made." In the context of these verses, the Word made flesh is identical with the Word who was in the beginning with God, being exegetically equated with Jesus.
A foremost contribution to the Christology of the Apostolic Age is that of Paul. The central Christology of Paul conveys the notion of Christ's pre-existence and the identification of Christ as Kyrios. The Pauline epistles use Kyrios to identify Jesus almost 230 times, and express the theme that the true mark of a Christian is the confession of Jesus as the true Lord.Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus by Gerald O'Collins 2009 ISBN 0-19-955787-X page 142 Paul viewed the superiority of the Christian revelation over all other divine manifestations as a consequence of the fact that Christ is the Son of God.
The Pauline epistles also advanced the "cosmic Christology" later developed in the fourth gospel, elaborating the cosmic implications of Jesus' existence as the Son of God, as in [tpl]bibleref|2 Corinthians|5:17|ESV[/tpl]: "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come." Also, in [tpl]bibleref|Colossians|1:15|ESV[/tpl]: "He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation."

===Post-Apostolic controversies===

Following the Apostolic Age, from the second century onwards, a number of controversies developed about how the human and divine are related within the person of Jesus.[tpl]Citation| last = Editors | first =  Erwin Fahlbusch| year = 1999| title = The encyclopedia of Christianity| pages = 463| url = http://books.google.com/?id=z47zgZ75dqgC&pg=PA463&dq=Logos+as+God+in+the+early+church| isbn = 0-8028-2413-7| publisher = Brill| location = Leiden, Netherland[/tpl][tpl]Citation| last = Rausch | first =  Thomas P.| year = 2003| title = Who is Jesus? : an introduction to Christology| pages = 149| url = http://books.google.com/?id=8OJCa6euw5gC&pg=PA148&dq=Justin+Martyr+christology| isbn = 0-8146-5078-3| publisher = Liturgical Press| location = Collegeville, Minn.[/tpl] As of the second century, a number of different and opposing approaches developed among various groups.  For example, Arianism did not endorse divinity, Ebionism argued Jesus was an ordinary mortal, while Gnosticism held docetic views which argued Christ was a spiritual being who only appeared to have a physical body.[tpl]Citation  | last1 = Ehrman | first1 = Bart D. | title = The Orthodox corruption of scripture: the effect of early Christological controversies on the text of the New Testament | url = http://books.google.com/?id=NHIBM3p83UcC&pg=PA181 | year = 1993 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York  | isbn = 978-0-19-510279-6 | pages =  [/tpl][tpl]Citation| last = McGrath | first =  Alister E.| year = 2007| title = Christian theology : an introduction| pages = 282| url = http://books.google.com/?id=tHlY94UWi3UC&pg=PA282&dq=Justin+Martyr+christology| isbn = 1-4051-5360-1| publisher = Blackwell| location = Malden, Mass. [/tpl] The resulting tensions led to schisms within the church in the second and third centuries, and ecumenical councils were convened in the fourth and fifth centuries to deal with the issues. Eventually, by the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451, the Hypostatic union was decreed—the proposition that Christ has one human nature physis and one divine nature physis, united with neither confusion nor division—making this part of the creed of orthodox Christianity. Although some of the debates seems, for a modern student, to be over a theological iota, they took place in controversial political circumstances, reflecting the relations of temporal powers and divine authority, it certaintly resulted in schisms, among others what separated the Church of the East from the Church of the Roman Empire.Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd series, Vol XIV p207, translated edition by H.R.

In 325, the First Council of Nicaea defined the persons of the Godhead and their relationship with one another - decisions which were reratified at the First Council of Constantinople in 381. The language used was that the one God exists in three persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit); in particular, it was affirmed that the Son was homoousios (of same substance) as the Father. The Nicene Creed declared the full divinity and full humanity of Jesus.Jonathan Kirsch, God Against the Gods: The History of the War Between Monotheism and Polytheism (2004)Charles Freeman, The Closing of the Western Mind: The Rise of Faith and the Fall of Reason (2002)Edward Gibbons, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776-88), 21
In 431, the First Council of Ephesus was initially called to address the views of Nestorius on Mariology, but the problems soon extended to Christology, and schisms followed. The 431 council was called because in defense of his loyal priest Anastasius, Nestorius had denied the Theotokos title for Mary and later contradicted Proclus during a sermon in Constantinople. Pope Celestine I (who was already upset with Nestorius due to other matters) wrote about this to Cyril of Alexandria, who orchestrated the council. During the council, Nestorius defended his position by arguing there must be two persons of Christ, one human, the other divine, and Mary had given birth only to a human, hence could not be called the Theotokos, i.e. "the one who gives birth to God". The debate about the single or dual nature of Christ ensued in Ephesus.The creed: the apostolic faith in contemporary theology by Berard L.

The Council of Ephesus debated hypostasis (coexisting natures) versus monophysitism (only one nature) versus miaphysitism (two natures united as one) versus Nestorianism (disunion of two natures). From the Christological viewpoint, the council adopted hypostasis, i.e. coexisting natures, but its language was less definitive than the 451 Council of Chalcedon. The Oriental Orthodox rejected this and subsequent councils and to date consider themselves to be miaphysite.Systematic Theology by Lewis Sperry Chafer 1993 ISBN 0-8254-2340-6 pages 382-384 http://books.google.com/books?id=ZFCoSSKTffcC&pg=PA382&dq=Hypostatic+union&hl=en&ei=AVPgTMvlGImU4Abtqvj6Bw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=Hypostatic%20union&f=falseThe Blackwell Companion to Eastern Christianity by Ken Parry 2009 ISBN 1-4443-3361-5 page 88 http://books.google.com/books?id=fWp9JA3aBvcC&pg=PA88&dq=Miaphysitism&hl=en&ei=sVDgTKqDKpDOswbundTyCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Miaphysitism&f=false By contrast, Roman Catholics to date (and most Protestants) believe in the hypostatic union and the Trinity.

==Christological issues==

===Person of Christ===

The Person of Christ refers to the study of the human and divine natures of Jesus Christ as they coexist within one person.Introducing Christian Doctrine by Millard J. Erickson, L. Arnold Hustad 2001 ISBN page 234 There are no direct discussions in the New Testament regarding the dual nature of the Person of Christ as both divine and human. Hence, since the early days of Christianity, theologians have debated various approaches to the understanding of these natures, at times resulting in schisms.
Historically in the Alexandrian school of thought (fashioned on the Gospel of John), Jesus Christ is the eternal Logos who already possesses unity with the Father before the act of Incarnation.Karl Barth's christology by Charles T. Waldrop 1985 ISBN 90-279-3109-7 pages 19-23 In contrast, the Antiochian school views Christ as a single, unified human person apart from his relationship to the divine.
John Calvin maintained there was no human element in the Person of Christ which could be separated from the Person of The Word.Calvin's Christology by Stephen Edmondson 2004 ISBN 0-521-54154-9 page 217 Calvin also emphasized the importance of the "Work of Christ" in any attempt at understanding the Person of Christ and cautioned against ignoring the Works of Jesus during his ministry.Calvin's First Catechism by I. John Hesselink 1997 ISBN 0-664-22725-2 page 217
The study of the Person of Christ continued into the 20th century, with modern theologians such as Karl Rahner and Hans von Balthasar. Rahner pointed out the coincidence between the Person of Christ and the Word of God, referring to Mark 8:38 and Luke 9:26 which state whoever is ashamed of the words of Jesus is ashamed of the Lord himself.Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi by Karl Rahner 2004 ISBN 0-86012-006-6 page 1822 Balthasar argued the union of the human and divine natures of Christ was achieved not by the "absorption" of human attributes, but by their "assumption". Thus, in his view, the divine nature of Christ was not affected by the human attributes and remained forever divine.The eschatology of Hans Urs von Balthasar by Nicholas J. Healy 2005 ISBN 0-19-927836-9 pages 22-23

===Nativity and the Holy Name===

The Nativity of Jesus impacted the Christological issues about his Person from the earliest days of Christianity. Luke's Christology centers on the dialectics of the dual natures of the earthly and heavenly manifestations of existence of the Christ, while Matthew's Christology focuses on the mission of Jesus and his role as the savior.Theology of the New Testament by Georg Strecker 2000 ISBN 0-664-22336-2 pages 401-403Matthew by Grant R.

Matthew 1:23 provides a key to the "Emmanuel Christology" of Matthew. Beginning with 1:23, Matthew shows a clear interest in identifying Jesus as "God with us" and in later developing the Emmanuel characterization of Jesus at key points throughout the rest of his Gospel.Matthew's Emmanuel by David D. Kupp 1997 ISBN 0-521-57007-7 pages 220-224 The name Emmanuel does not appear elsewhere in the New Testament, but Matthew builds on it in Matthew 28:20 ("I am with you always, even unto the end of the world") to indicate Jesus will be with the faithful to the end of the age.Who do you say that I am?: essays on Christology by Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R.

===Crucifixion and Resurrection===

The accounts of the crucifixion and subsequent resurrection of Jesus provides a rich background for Christological analysis, from the canonical Gospels to the Pauline Epistles.Who do you say that I am? Essays on Christology by Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R. Bauer 1999 ISBN 0-664-25752-6 page 106
A central element in the Christology presented in the Acts of the Apostles is the affirmation of the belief that the death of Jesus by crucifixion happened "with the foreknowledge of God, according to a definite plan".New Testament christology by Frank J. Matera 1999 ISBN 0-664-25694-5 page 67 In this view, as in Acts 2:23, the cross is not viewed as a scandal, for the crucifixion of Jesus "at the hands of the lawless" is viewed as the fulfilment of the plan of God.The speeches in Acts: their content, context, and concerns by Marion L. Soards 1994 ISBN 0-664-25221-4 page 34
Paul's Christology has a specific focus on the death and resurrection of Jesus. For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus is directly related to his resurrection and the term "the cross of Christ" used in Galatians 6:12 may be viewed as his abbreviation of the message of the gospels.Christology by Hans Schwarz 1998 ISBN 0-8028-4463-4 pages 132-134 For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus was not an isolated event in history, but a cosmic event with significant eschatological consequences, as in Cor 2:8. In the Pauline view, Jesus, obedient to the point of death (Phil 2:8), died "at the right time" (Rom 4:25) based on the plan of God. For Paul, the "power of the cross" is not separable from the resurrection of Jesus.

===Threefold office===

The threefold office (Latin munus triplex) of Jesus Christ is a Christian doctrine based upon the teachings of the Old Testament. It was described by Eusebius and more fully developed by John Calvin. It states that Jesus Christ performed three functions (or "offices") in his earthly ministry - those of prophet (Deuteronomy 18:14-22), priest (Psalm 110:1-4), and king (Psalm 2).  In the Old Testament, the appointment of someone to any of these three positions could be indicated by anointing him or her by pouring oil over the head.  Thus, the term messiah, meaning "anointed one", is associated with the concept of the threefold office. While the office of king is that most frequently associated with the Messiah, the role of Jesus as priest is also prominent in the New Testament, being most fully explained in chapters 7 to 10 of the Book of Hebrews.

===Mariology===

Some Christians, notably Roman Catholics, view Mariology as a key component of Christology."Mariology Is Christology", in Vittorio Messori, The Mary Hypothesis, Rome: 2005. http://www.zenit.org/article-14658?l=english In this view, not only is Mariology a logical and necessary consequence of Christology, but without it, Christology is incomplete, since the figure of Mary contributes to a fuller understanding of who Christ is and what he did.Paul Haffner, 2004 The mystery of Mary Gracewing Press ISBN 0-85244-650-0 page 17 Certain Christian traditions of Protestant heritage tend not to hold this view.
Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) expressed this sentiment about Roman Catholic Mariology when in two separate occasions he stated, "The appearance of a truly Marian awareness serves as the touchstone indicating whether or not the Christological substance is fully present"Communio, 1996, Volume 23, page 175 and "It is necessary to go back to Mary, if we want to return to the truth about Jesus Christ."Raymond Burke, 2008 Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons, seminarians, and Consecrated Persons ISBN 1-57918-355-7 page xxi
