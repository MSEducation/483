</ref> Visitors to India were very likely to notice these vocal and active birds and [[Frank Finn]] notes an incident during the Colonial period in India: 
[tpl]quote|Some years back, a new Viceroy was being shown the wonders of his temporary kingdom, and among these the Taj at Agra held, of course, an important place. Arrived before the glorious monument of Eastern love and pride, the artless Aide-de-Camp was mute; the gilded staff were still as Kipling says, in anxious expectation of the comment of His Excellency. But this, alas when it came was merely the remark: "What are those funny little birds ? The shock must have been the greater for the fact that the mean fowls thus honoured were it seems, of that singularly disreputable species which is commonly known in India as the "Seven Sisters" or "Seven Brothers," or by the Hindustani equivalent of sat-bhai."[tpl]cite book|author=Finn, Frank|year=1904|title= The Birds of Calcutta|publisher=Thacker, Spink and Co.|url=http://www.archive.org/details/birdsofcalcutta00finnrich[/tpl][/tpl]
