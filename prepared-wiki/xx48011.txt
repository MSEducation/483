Nova Scotia's rivers all flow into the Atlantic Ocean through four unique watersheds: the Gulf of Maine, the Northumberland Strait, the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and into the Atlantic Ocean itself.

==Gulf of Maine==

The Gulf of Maine system includes the Bay of Fundy, which includes the Cumberland and Minas Basins. In Nova Scotia, the system occupies the shores from Fort Lawrence to Cape St. Mary (44Â°05'N).[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S23_1953.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=February 7, 2010[/tpl]
