[[List of trees of Canada]]

CATEGORIES: Natural history of Canada, Lists of trees, Trees of Canada, Trees of North America, Flora of Canada, Lists of biota of Canada

This list includes many of the common large shrubs of Canada, as well as the trees. Many of the trees on this list are introduced as ornamentals or for food and are not common in Canada. Also due to the vast area of Canada, a tree that is common in one area, may be completely absent or unable to grow in another area. In particular many warm-temperate trees can only be grown on the mild Pacific coast (where gardens may contain many additional species not listed here).
See also Provincial tree emblems of Canada for the official trees of the Provinces and Territories of Canada.
