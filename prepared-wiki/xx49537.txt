==Exploration==

Due to its altitude and ruggedness, the Karakoram is much less inhabited than parts of the Himalayas further east.  European explorers first visited early in the 19th century, followed by British surveyors starting in 1856.
The Muztagh Pass was crossed in 1887 by the expedition of Colonel Francis YounghusbandFrench, Patrick. (1994). Younghusband: The Last Great Imperial Adventurer, pp. 53, 56-60. HarperCollinsPublishers, London. Reprint (1995): Flamingo. London. ISBN 0-00-637601-0. and the valleys above the Hunza River were explored by General Sir George K. Cockerill in 1892.  Explorations in the 1910s and 1920s established most of the geography of the region.
The name Karakoram was used in the early 20th century, for example by Kenneth Mason, for the range now known as the Baltoro Muztagh.  The term is now used to refer to the entire range from the Batura Muztagh above Hunza in the west to the Saser Muztagh in the bend of the Shyok River in the east.

==Geology and glaciers==

The Karakoram is in one of the world's most geologically  active areas, at the boundary between two colliding continents.
A significant part, 28-50% of the Karakoram Range is glaciated, compared to the Himalaya (8-12%) and Alps (2.2%).[tpl]cite book|last=Gansser|year=1975|title=Geology of the Himalayas|publisher=Interscience Publishers|location=London[/tpl] Mountain glaciers may serve as an indicator of climate change, advancing and receding with long-term changes in temperature and precipitation.Mughal, Muhammad Aurang Zeb. 2013.

===The Karakoram during the Ice Age===

In the last ice age, a connected series of glaciers stretched from western Tibet to Nanga Parbat, and from the Tarim basin to the Gilgit District.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kuhle|first=M.|year=1988|title=The Pleistocene Glaciation of Tibet and the Onset of Ice Ages- An Autocycle Hypothesis.Tibet and High Asia.

While the current valley glaciers in the Karakorum reach a maximum length of [tpl]convert|76|km|mi[/tpl], several of the ice-age valley glacier branches and main valley glaciers, had lengths up to [tpl]convert|700|km|mi[/tpl]. During the Ice age, the glacier snowline was about [tpl]Convert|1300|m|ft[/tpl] lower than today.

==Highest peaks==

The notable peaks of the Karakoram are:
The majority of the highest peaks are in the Gilgit–Baltistan region of Pakistan. Baltistan has more than 100 mountain peaks exceeding [tpl]convert|6100|m|ft[/tpl] height from sea level.

===K-names===

==Subranges==

The naming and division of the various subranges of the Karakoram is not universally agreed upon. However, the following is a list of the most important subranges, following Jerzy Wala.Jerzy Wala, Orographical Sketch Map of the Karakoram, Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, Zurich, 1990. The ranges are listed roughly west to east.

==Passes==

From west to east
The Khunjerab Pass is the only motorable pass across the range.  The Shimshal Pass (which does not cross an international border) is the only other pass still in regular use.

==Cultural references==

The Karakoram mountain range has been referred to in a number of novels and movies. Rudyard Kipling refers to the Karakorum mountain range in his novel Kim, which was first published in 1900. Marcel Ichac made a film titled Karakoram, chronicling a French expedition to the range in 1936. The film won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival of 1937. Greg Mortenson details the Karakoram, and specifically K2 and the Balti, extensively in his book Three Cups of Tea, about his quest to build schools for girls in the region. In the Gatchaman TV series, the Karakoram range houses Galactor's headquarters.
