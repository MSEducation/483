Dean Esposito (born July 20, 1963 in Encino, Los Angeles, USA), better known as Dino, is an American deejay, singer-songwriter, and record producer.

==Early life==

Dino was born to Frank and Francis Esposito in the Encino district of Los Angeles, California. The family later moved to Hawaii and Connecticut before settling in Las Vegas, Nevada, where his father became a restaurant owner. It was here that Dino pursued his musical interests. He earned his Bachelor's Degree in Communications/Broadcasting and Music at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Shortly after, he accepted a job as a program director/radio DJ at his college radio station, with his own morning show called "Urban Sunrise."  Soon, he moved on to become a Top-40 DJ at Nevada radio station Power 97. Subsequently, he was offered a job at KCEP, Las Vegas's largest black music station, where he eventually became program director. During this time he also moonlighted as a local club DJ.

==Music career==

Dino then became a singer, first as part of the group Esquire, and later as a solo artist. He signed with 4th & B'way/Island/PolyGram Records, and in 1988 released his debut single "Summergirls". He then released his debut album 24/7, from which were released the singles "24/7," "I Like It," "Sunshine," and "Never 2 Much of U."  "In the City" was also released, but only as a 12-inch single for club play.
During this initial up-swing of his career, Dino performed at theme parks, sharing the bill with such artists as Sweet Sensation and Linear. Dino developed an even wider fanbase when he became the opening act for New Kids on the Block in the summer of 1989.
1990 saw the release of his sophomore LP, titled "Swingin,'" from which were released the singles  "Romeo" and "Gentle."  During this time, he formed his own production company and record label, ONID Productions (his name spelled backward).
He released his third album, titled "The Way I Am," in 1993 for East West Records, on which he scored his last Top-40 hit, "Ooh Child."  A final single was also released, the non-charting ballad "Endlessly."
After his singing career faded, he began producing and writing songs with such artists as Tonya Mitchell, Paul Taylor, Jordan Knight, Walter Beasley, Sheena Easton, and Joanna Pacitti, the latter of whose collaborative song "Watch Me Shine" was included on the Legally Blonde motion picture soundtrack.

==Personal life==

Dino currently lives in Las Vegas and is married to Caroline Jackson, one of the original members of the Latin freestyle singing group The Cover Girls.
