===The Hardin Expedition===

Two parties of settlers (totaling 26) struck out of Knoxville, Tennessee in late spring of 1816 bound for the general area which would eventually become Savannah, Tennessee. The first party came by boat down the Tennessee River, landing in May at "the easteward curve of the Tennessee" at Cerro Gordo.  The second, and larger, party had travelled overland and suffered from many delays.  Upon the arrival of the second group, the parties finally rejoined at Johnson Creek, near present day Savannah, Tennessee. It was now July, and the pioneers set about the laying down of the first permanent settlement by non-Native Americans in the area.
This second party was led by Joseph Hardin, Jr., son of Col. Joseph Hardin, who had, before his death, accumulated several land grants to the area as rewards for his Revolutionary War service. Joseph, Jr. was accompanied on the trip by his brother, James Hardin (known as the founder of the settlement of Hardinville;  a failed endeavor that would be created in 1817 on nearby Hardin’s Creek). Both men executed land grants[tpl]cite book | last = North Carolina State | first = | title = Land Warrants of North Carolina State, North Carolina Grants and North Carolina Military Grants, 1788-1903 | series = | work = Tennessee State History Library; Nashville, TN | date =  May 10, 1784[/tpl]; entry No. 2128; [tpl]convert|1000|acre|km2[/tpl] in the area.  They had fought alongside their father in the war and had been likewise rewarded with their own land patents, and had inherited some of their father's remaining unclaimed grants. About this same time, other settlers from the initial expedition established a community further down river at Saltillo.
Other relatives of Col. Joseph’s were to eventually settle in the area, including sons: Gibson, Ben II and Robert II, and daughter, Margaret (wife of Ninian Steele), all having arrived there by 1818.
The county was named posthumously for Joseph Hardin, Sr.[tpl]cite web | title = My Tennessee Genealogy | url =  http://www.genealogyinc.com/tennessee/hardin-county/ | accessdate = April 2011[/tpl] in November 1819, at the first meeting of the county assembly which took place at the home of his son, James Hardin.  Today, the courthouse in the county seat of Savannah is dedicated to him.
