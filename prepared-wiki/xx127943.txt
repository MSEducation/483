[[Dick's Picks Volume 8]]

CATEGORIES: Dick's Picks albums, 1997 live albums, English-language live albums

Dick's Picks Volume 8 is the eighth live album in the Dick's Picks series of releases by the Grateful Dead. It was recorded on May 2, 1970 at Harpur College in Binghamton, New York. It was released in mid-1997.
The album contains the entire concert, except for one song — "Cold Rain and Snow", which followed "Good Lovin'" and preceded "It's a Man's Man's Man's World".  The first two verses of St. Stephen are also missing.  The first set of the concert was acoustic, and was recorded in stereo.  The second and third sets were electric, and were recorded in monaural.
In a 1993 poll of Grateful Dead tape traders, the 5/2/70 show was ranked #6 on the list of all-time favorite Dead concert tapes.Scott, John W; Dolgushkin, Mike; Nixon, Stu. DeadBase VIII: The Complete Guide to Grateful Dead Song Lists, 1994, DeadBase, ISBN 1-877657-15-8, p. 356

==Caveat emptor==

Each volume of Dick's Picks has its own "caveat emptor" label, advising the listener of the sound quality of the recording.  The label for volume 8 reads:
"These compact discs were mastered directly from the original half track 7½ ips analog tapes recorded at this show.  The acoustic set was recorded in stereo.  The electric sets are monaural.  While the reason for this remains a mystery, spurious electrical activity is suspected."
