</ref> After the density of infalling material has dropped below about 10<sup>−8</sup> g cm<sup>−3</sup>, that material is sufficiently transparent to allow energy radiated by the protostar to escape. The combination of convection within the protostar and radiation from its exterior allow the star to contract further.<ref name=larson/> This continues until the gas is hot enough for the internal [[pressure]] to support the protostar against further gravitational collapse—a state called [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. When this accretion phase is nearly complete, the resulting object is known as a [[protostar]].<ref name=prialnik />
Accretion of material onto the protostar continues partially from the newly formed circumstellar disc. When the density and temperature are high enough, deuterium fusion begins, and the outward pressure of the resultant radiation slows (but does not stop) the collapse. Material comprising the cloud continues to "rain" onto the protostar. In this stage bipolar jets are produced called Herbig-Haro objects. This is probably the means by which excess angular momentum of the infalling material is expelled, allowing the star to continue to form.
When the surrounding gas and dust envelope disperses and accretion process stops, the star is considered a pre–main sequence star (PMS star). The energy source of these objects is gravitational contraction, as opposed to hydrogen burning in main sequence stars. The PMS star follows a Hayashi track on the Hertzsprung–Russell (H–R) diagram.[tpl]cite journal | author = C. Hayashi | title=Stellar evolution in early phases of gravitational contraction | journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan | year=1961 | volume=13 | pages=450–452 | bibcode=1961PASJ...13..450H [/tpl] The contraction will proceed until the Hayashi limit is reached, and thereafter contraction will continue on a Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale with the temperature remaining stable. Stars with less than 0.5 solar masses thereafter join the main sequence. For more massive PMS stars, at the end of the Hayashi track they will slowly collapse in near hydrostatic equilibrium, following the Henyey track.
Finally, hydrogen begins to fuse in the core of the star, and the rest of the enveloping material is cleared away. This ends the protostellar phase and begins the star's main sequence phase on the H–R diagram.
The stages of the process are well defined in stars with masses around one solar mass or less. In high mass stars, the length of the star formation process is comparable to the other timescales of their evolution, much shorter, and the process is not so well defined. The later evolution of stars are studied in stellar evolution.

==Observations==

Key elements of star formation are only available by observing in wavelengths other than the optical. The protostellar stage of stellar existence is almost invariably hidden away deep inside dense clouds of gas and dust left over from the GMC. Often, these star-forming cocoons known as Bok globules, can be seen in silhouette against bright emission from surrounding gas.[tpl]cite journal | bibcode=1947ApJ...105..255B | author=B. J. Bok & E.

Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have thus been especially important for unveiling numerous Galactic protostars and their parent star clusters.[tpl]cite web|url=http://wise.ssl.berkeley.edu/ |title=Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Mission |publisher=NASA[/tpl]Majaess, D.

The structure of the molecular cloud and the effects of the protostar can be observed in near-IR extinction maps (where the number of stars are counted per unit area and compared to a nearby zero extinction area of sky), continuum dust emission and rotational transitions of CO and other molecules; these last two are observed in the millimeter and submillimeter range. The radiation from the protostar and early star has to be observed in infrared astronomy wavelengths, as the extinction caused by the rest of the cloud in which the star is forming is usually too big to allow us to observe it in the visual part of the spectrum. This presents considerable difficulties as the Earth's atmosphere is almost entirely opaque from 20μm to 850μm, with narrow windows at 200μm and 450μm. Even outside this range, atmospheric subtraction techniques must be used.
The formation of individual stars can only be directly observed in our Galaxy, but in distant galaxies star formation has been detected through its unique spectral signature.
On February 21, 2014, NASA announced a greatly upgraded database for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe. According to scientists, more than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.[tpl]cite web |last=Hoover |first=Rachel |title=Need to Track Organic Nano-Particles Across the Universe?

==Low mass and high mass star formation==

Stars of different masses are thought to form by slightly different mechanisms.  The theory of low-mass star formation, which is well-supported by a plethora of observations, suggests that low-mass stars form by the gravitational collapse of rotating density enhancements within molecular clouds.  As described above, the collapse of a rotating cloud of gas and dust leads to the formation of an accretion disk through which matter is channeled onto a central protostar.  For stars with masses higher than about 8 solar masses, however, the mechanism of star formation is not well understood.
Massive stars emit copious quantities of radiation which pushes against infalling material.  In the past, it was thought that this radiation pressure might be substantial enough to halt accretion onto the massive protostar and prevent the formation of stars with masses more than a few tens of solar masses.[tpl]cite journal | author = M. G. Wolfire, J. P. Cassinelli | title = Conditions for the formation of massive stars | journal = Astrophysical Journal | year = 1987 | volume = 319 | issue = 1 | pages = 850–867 | bibcode = 1987ApJ...319..850W  | doi = 10.1086/165503| last2 = Cassinelli [/tpl] Recent theoretical work has shown that the production of a jet and outflow clears a cavity through which much of the radiation from a massive protostar can escape without hindering accretion through the disk and onto the protostar.[tpl]cite journal | author = C. F. McKee, J. C. Tan | title = Massive star formation in 100,000 years from turbulent and pressurized molecular clouds | journal = Nature | year = 2002 | volume = 416 | issue = 6876 | pages = 59–61 | bibcode = 2002Natur.416...59M  | doi = 10.1038/416059a | pmid = 11882889|arxiv = astro-ph/0203071 | last2 = Tan [/tpl][tpl]cite journal | author = R. Banerjee, R. E. Pudritz | title = Massive star formation via high accretion rates and early disk-driven outflows | journal = Astrophysical Journal | year = 2007 | volume = 660 | issue = 1 | pages = 479–488 | bibcode = 2007ApJ...660..479B  | doi = 10.1086/512010|arxiv = astro-ph/0612674 | last2 = Pudritz [/tpl] Present thinking is that massive stars may therefore be able to form by a mechanism similar to that by which low mass stars form.
There is mounting evidence that at least some massive protostars are indeed surrounded by accretion disks.  Several other theories of massive star formation remain to be tested observationally.  Of these, perhaps the most prominent is the theory of competitive accretion, which suggests that massive protostars are "seeded" by low-mass protostars which compete with other protostars to draw in matter from the entire parent molecular cloud, instead of simply from a small local region.[tpl]cite journal | author = I.

Another theory of massive star formation suggests that massive stars may form by the coalescence of two or more stars of lower mass.[tpl]cite journal | author = I. A. Bonnell, M. R. Bate, H.
