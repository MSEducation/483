Shaquille Rashaun O'Neal ([tpl]IPAc-en|ʃ|ə|ˈ|k|iː|l[/tpl] [tpl]respell|shə|KEEL|'[/tpl]; born March 6, 1972), nicknamed Shaq ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|æ|k[/tpl] [tpl]respell|SHAK|'[/tpl]), is an American retired basketball player, former rapper and current analyst on the television program Inside the NBA. Standing [tpl]height|ft=7|in=1[/tpl] tallRoth, Mark. 3 March 2006, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, "Male Hollywood stars don't stand as tall as we imagine". Accessed 8 September 2012. and weighing [tpl]convert|325|lb|kg[/tpl], he was one of the heaviest players ever to play in the NBA. Throughout his 19-year career, O'Neal used his size and strength to overpower opponents for points and rebounds.
Following his career at Louisiana State University, O'Neal was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA Draft. He quickly became one of the top centers in the league, winning Rookie of the Year in 1992–93 and later leading his team to the 1995 NBA Finals. After four years with the Magic, O'Neal signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers. They won three consecutive championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Amid tension between O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004, and his fourth NBA championship followed in 2006. Midway through the 2007–2008 season he was traded to the Phoenix Suns. After a season-and-a-half with the Suns, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2009–10 season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/la-spw-shaq26-2009jun26-test,0,271183.story |title=Shaquille O'Neal traded to Cleveland Cavaliers for 3 players, cash|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 23, 2010|first=Bresnahan|last=Is|deadurl=yes[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] O'Neal played for the Boston Celtics in the 2010–11 season before retiring.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/celtics/2010-08-04-shaquille-oneal_N.htm|title=Void filled: 15-time All-Star Shaquille O'Neal to Celtics|date=August 5, 2010|first=Jeff|last= Zillgitt|work=USA Today|accessdate=March 15, 2011[/tpl]
O'Neal's individual accolades include the 1999–2000 MVP award, the 1992–93 NBA Rookie of the Year award, 15 All-Star game selections, three All-Star Game MVP awards, three Finals MVP awards, two scoring titles, 14 All-NBA team selections, and three NBA All-Defensive Team selections. He is one of only three players to win NBA MVP, All-Star game MVP and Finals MVP awards in the same year (2000); the other players are Willis Reed in 1970 and Michael Jordan in 1996 and 1998. He ranks 6th all-time in points scored, 5th in field goals, 13th in rebounds, and 7th in blocks.  Largely due to his ability to dunk the basketball, O'Neal also ranks 3rd all-time in field goal percentage (58.2%).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/onealsh01.html|title=Shaquille O'Neal NBA & ABA Statistics|publisher=Basketball-Reference.com|accessdate=August 1, 2011[/tpl]
In addition to his basketball career, O'Neal has released four rap albums, with his first, Shaq Diesel, going platinum. He has appeared in numerous films and has starred in his own reality shows, Shaq's Big Challenge and Shaq Vs.

==Early life==

O'Neal was born in Newark, New Jersey. He remains estranged from his biological father, Joseph Toney of Newark. Toney, who was once an All-State guard in high school who was offered a basketball scholarship to play at Seton Hall, struggled with drug addiction and was, by 1973, imprisoned for drug possession, while O'Neal was an infant. Upon his release, Toney did not resume a place in O'Neal's life and instead, agreed to relinquish his parental visitation rights to O'Neal's stepfather, Phillip A. Harrison, a career Army Reserve sergeant, and his mother, Lucille (née O'Neal).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/16/Shaquille-O-Neal.html|title=Shaquille O'Neal Biography (1972–)|work=filmreference.com[/tpl] O'Neal and Toney have never spoken, and O'Neal has expressed no interest in establishing a relationship.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/11/sports/sp-plaschke11|title='Biological Didn't Bother'|first=Bill|last=Plaschke|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 12, 2002|accessdate=January 21, 2011[/tpl] On his 1994 rap album, Shaq Fu: The Return, O'Neal voiced his feelings of disdain for Toney in the song "Biological Didn't Bother", dismissing him with the line "Phil is my father."
O'Neal credits the Boys and Girls Club of America in his hometown of Newark, New Jersey, with giving him a safe place to play and keeping him off the streets. "It gave me something to do," he said. "I'd just go there to shoot. I didn't even play on a team."[tpl]cite web |last=Ryan|first=Michael|title=Where They Gave Me A Chance |work=Parade |url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2000/edition_02-13-2000/Boys_And_Girls_Clubs |date=February 13, 2000|accessdate=March 21, 2006[/tpl] He led his Robert G.

==College career==

After graduating from high school, O'Neal studied business at Louisiana State University. He had first met Dale Brown, LSU's men's basketball coach, years earlier in Europe. O'Neal's stepfather was stationed on a U.S. Army base at Wildflecken, West Germany. While playing for Brown at LSU, O'Neal was a two-time All-American, two-time SEC player of the year, and received the Adolph Rupp Trophy as NCAA men's basketball player of the year in 1991; he was also named college player of the year by AP and UPI. O'Neal left LSU early to pursue his NBA career, but continued his education even after becoming a professional player.[tpl]cite web |title=O'Neal to get degree from LSU |publisher=The Daily Texan |url=http://media.www.dailytexanonline.com/media/storage/paper410/news/2000/12/12/Sports/Oneal.To.Get.Degree.From.Lsu-701598.shtml |date=December 12, 2000 |accessdate=March 7, 2007[/tpl] He was later inducted into the LSU Hall of Fame.barrystickets.com (2007).

==NBA career==

===Orlando Magic (1992–1996)===

The Orlando Magic drafted O'Neal with the 1st overall pick in the 1992 NBA Draft. During that summer, prior to moving to Orlando, he spent a significant amount of time in Los Angeles under the tutelage of Hall of Famer Magic Johnson.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] During his rookie season, O'Neal averaged 23.4 points on 56.2% shooting, 13.9 rebounds, and 3.5 blocks per game for the season. He was named the 1993 NBA Rookie of the Year and became the first rookie to be voted an All-Star starter since Michael Jordan in 1985.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/magic/history/magic_history.html |title=MAGIC: Magic History |accessdate=March 10, 2008 |work=NBA.com/magic [/tpl] The Magic finished 41–41, winning 20 more games than the previous season; however, the team ultimately missed the playoffs by virtue of a tie-breaker with the Indiana Pacers. On more than one occasion during the year, Sports Illustrated writer Jack McCallum overheard O'Neal saying, "We've got to get coach Matty Guokas out of here and bring in assistant Brian Hill."[tpl]cite news|last=McCallum|first=Jack|authorlink=Jack McCallum|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1009558/index.htm|title=The Young And The Feckless|quote=On more than one occasion during O'Neal's rookie season of 1992–93, I heard him say of his then coach, "We've got to get Matty Guokas out of here and bring in Brian."|date=March 3, 1997|magazine=Sports Illustrated|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5u6mKNoM8|archivedate=November 9, 2010|accessdate=November 9, 2010[/tpl]
In 1993-1994, O'Neal's second season, Hill was the coach and Guokas was reassigned to the front office.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/01/sports/hill-is-named-coach-of-magic.html|title=Hill Is Named Coach of Magic|quote=Matt Guokas, who coached the Orlando Magic to the National Basketball Association's most improved record last season, was replaced today by an assistant, Brian Hill, and was reassigned to the front office as Orlando's vice president of basketball development.|date=July 1, 1993|magazine=The New York Times|accessdate=November 6, 2010[/tpl] O'Neal improved his scoring average to 29.4 points (second in the league to David Robinson) while leading the NBA in field goal percentage at 60%. On November 20, 1993, against the New Jersey Nets, O'Neal registered the first triple-double of his career, recording 24 points to go along with career highs of 28 rebounds and 15 blocks.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.basketball-reference.com/fc/pgl.cgi?player=onealsh01&year=1994|title=Shaquille O'Neal 1993–94 Game Log|publisher=Basketball-Reference.com|accessdate=August 5, 2010[/tpl] He was voted into the All-Star game and also made the All-NBA 3rd Team. Teamed with newly drafted Anfernee "Penny" Hardaway, the Magic finished with a record of 50–32 and made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. In his first playoff series, O'Neal averaged 20.7 points and 13.3 rebounds in a losing effort as the Magic lost every game to the Indiana Pacers.
In 1994-1995, his third season, O'Neal's 29.3 point average led the NBA in scoring. He finished second in MVP voting to David Robinson and was voted into his third straight All-Star Game along with Hardaway. They formed one of the league's top duos and helped Orlando to a 57–25 record and the Atlantic Division crown. The Magic won their first ever playoff series against the Boston Celtics in the 1995 NBA Playoffs. They then defeated the Chicago Bulls in the conference semi-finals. After beating Reggie Miller's Indiana Pacers, the Magic reached the NBA Finals, facing the defending NBA champion Houston Rockets. O'Neal played well in his first Finals appearance, averaging 28 points on 59.5% shooting, 12.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists. Despite this, the Rockets, led by future Hall-of-Famers Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler, swept the series in four games.
O'Neal was injured for a great deal of the 1995–96 season, missing 28 games. He averaged 26.6 points and 11 rebounds per game, made the All-NBA 3rd Team, and played in his 4th All-Star Game. Despite O'Neal's injuries, the Magic finished with a regular season record of 60–22, second in the Eastern conference to the Chicago Bulls, who finished with an NBA record 72 wins. Orlando easily defeated the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks in the first two rounds of the 1996 NBA Playoffs; however, they were no match for Jordan's Bulls, who swept them in the Eastern Conference Finals.

===Los Angeles Lakers (1996–2004)===

O'Neal became a free agent after the 95–96 NBA season. In the summer of 1996, O'Neal was named to the United States Olympic basketball team, and was later part of the gold medal-winning team at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. While the Olympic basketball team was training in Orlando, the Orlando Sentinel published a poll that asked whether the Magic should fire Hill if that were one of O'Neal's conditions for returning.[tpl]cite news|last=MacMullan|first=Jackie|authorlink=Jackie MacMullan|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1008323/index.htm|title=Poof!

O'Neal's Olympic teammates rode him hard over the poll. He was also upset that the Orlando media implied O'Neal was not a good role model for having a child with his longtime girlfriend with no immediate plans to marry. O'Neal compared his lack of privacy in Orlando to "feeling like a big fish in a dried-up pond."[tpl]cite book|last=O'Neal|first=Shaquille|title=Shaq Talks Back| publisher=St. Martin's Paperbacks|year=2002|isbn=978-0-312-98259-1|page=151|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cIXaWfTsc5YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Shaq+Talks+Back&hl=en&src=bmrr&ei=-2TWTIWaNIjCsAODzYiNCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=November 14, 2010|quote=When I was in Orlando, I really felt like a big fish in a small, dried-up pond.

On the team's first full day at the Olympics in Atlanta, it was announced that O'Neal would join the Los Angeles Lakers on a seven-year, $121 million contract.[tpl]cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19960718&slug=2339914 |title=NBA – Lakers Sign O'Neal Raise Ticket Prices |date=July 18, 1996 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The Seattle Times [/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1370&dat=19960720&id=8WUVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0goEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3531,3152523 |title=Shaq signs multi-million contract with LA Lakers |publisher=Manila Standard |date=July 20, 1996 |accessdate=December 29, 2010[/tpl] He insisted he did not choose Los Angeles for the money. "I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money," O'Neal said after the signing. "I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok," he added, referring to a couple of his product endorsements. The Lakers won 56 games during the 1996–97 season. O'Neal averaged 26.2 points and 12.5 rebounds in his first season with Los Angeles; however, he again missed over 30 games due to injury. The Lakers made the playoffs, but were eliminated in the second round by the Utah Jazz in five games.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/playoffs/19961997.html |title=1997 Playoff Results |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=December 29, 2010[/tpl] On December 17, 1996, O'Neal shoved Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls; Rodman's teammates Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan restrained Rodman and prevented further conflict. The Los Angeles Daily News reported that O'Neal was willing to be suspended for fighting Rodman, and O'Neal said: "It's one thing to talk tough and one thing to be tough."[tpl]cite news|last=Stein|first=Marc|title=O'Neal wanted to pack more offensive punch|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/O%27NEAL+WANTED+TO+PACK+MORE+OFFENSIVE+PUNCH.-a084036430|accessdate=April 26, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News|date=December 19, 1996[/tpl]
The following season, O'Neal averaged 28.3 points and 11.4 rebounds (1997-1998). He led the league with a 58.4 field goal percentage, the first of five consecutive seasons in which he did so. The Lakers finished the season 61–21, first in the Pacific Division, and were the second seed in the western conference during the 1998 NBA Playoffs. After defeating the Portland Trail Blazers and Seattle SuperSonics in the first two rounds, the Lakers again fell to the Jazz, this time in a 4–0 sweep.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]
With the tandem of O'Neal and teenage superstar Kobe Bryant, expectations for the Lakers increased. However, personnel changes were a source of instability during the 1998–99 season. Long-time Laker point guard Nick Van Exel was traded to the Denver Nuggets; his former backcourt partner Eddie Jones was packaged with back-up center Elden Campbell for Glen Rice to satisfy a demand by O'Neal for a shooter. Coach Del Harris was fired, and former Lakers forward Kurt Rambis finished the season as head coach. The Lakers finished with a 31–19 record during the lockout-shortened season. Although they made the playoffs, they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs, led by Tim Duncan and David Robinson in the second round of the Western Conference playoffs. The Spurs would go on to win their first NBA title in 1999.

====Championship seasons====

In 1999, prior to the 1999-2000 season, the Lakers hired Phil Jackson as head coach, and the team's fortunes soon changed. Jackson immediately challenged O'Neal, telling him "the NBA's MVP trophy should be named after him when he retired."[tpl]cite news |last=Kreigel |first=Mark |title=Jackson shares thoughts on final season |date=May 18, 2011 |work=FoxSports.com |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nba/story/Phil-Jackson-shares-candid-thoughts-on-final-season-as-Los-Angeles-Lakers-coach-051811 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/646s9iJBJ |archivedate=December 21, 2011[/tpl] Using Jackson's triangle offense, O'Neal and Bryant enjoyed tremendous success, leading the Lakers to three consecutive titles (2000, 2001, and 2002). O'Neal was named MVP of the NBA Finals all three times and had the highest scoring average for a center in NBA Finals history.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl] In the November 10, 1999, game against the Houston Rockets, O'Neal and Charles Barkley were ejected. After O'Neal blocked a layup by Barkley, O'Neal shoved Barkley, who then threw the ball at O'Neal.[tpl]cite news|title=Shaq, Barkley scuffle, are ejected|url=http://assets.espn.go.com/nba/news/1999/1110/163531.html|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=January 8, 2012|date=November 11, 1999[/tpl]
O'Neal was also voted the 1999–2000 regular season Most Valuable Player, one vote short of becoming the first unanimous MVP in NBA history. Fred Hickman, then of CNN, instead chose Allen Iverson, then of the Philadelphia 76ers who would go on to win MVP the next season. O'Neal also won the scoring title while finishing second in rebounds and third in blocked shots. Jackson's influence resulted in a newfound commitment by O'Neal to defense, resulting in his first All-Defensive Team selection (second-team) in 2000.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]
In the 2001 NBA Finals against the 76ers, O'Neal fouled out in Game 3 backing over Dikembe Mutombo, the 2000–2001 Defensive Player of the Year. "I didn't think the best defensive player in the game would be flopping like that. It's a shame that the referees buy into that," O'Neal said. "I wish he'd stand up and play me like a man instead of flopping and crying every time I back him down.
In the summer of 2001, holding a basketball camp on the campus of Louisiana State University, O'Neal was challenged to a friendly wrestling match by future LSU and NBA player Glen "Big Baby" Davis, then 15 years of age and attending high school. O'Neal, weighing [tpl]convert|350|lb|kg st|abbr=on[/tpl], was impressed by the youngster, who lifted and body-slammed him to the ground.[tpl]cite news|author=Patrick Parker|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/dailydime?page=dime-080327&lpos=spotlight&lid=tab4pos1 |title=Daily Dime 6: Shaq vs. Big Baby |publisher=ESPN  |date=March 27, 2008[/tpl] A month before the [tpl]NBA Year|2001|app=season's[/tpl] training camp, O'Neal had corrective surgery for a claw toe deformity in the smallest toe of his left foot. He opted against a more involved surgery to return quicker.O'Neal, MacMullan 2011, p. 153. He was ready for the start of the 2001-02 regular season, but the toe frequently bothered him. In January 2002 he was involved in a spectacular on-court brawl in a game against the Chicago Bulls. He punched center Brad Miller after an intentional foul to prevent a basket, resulting in a melee with Miller, forward Charles Oakley, and several other players.[tpl]cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/news/2002/01/13/shaq_punches_ap/ |title=Shaq to be sacked |date=January 13, 2002 |work=Sports Illustrated[/tpl] O'Neal was suspended for three games without pay and fined $15,000.[tpl]cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E3D61238F935A25752C0A9649C8B63 |title=Sports of The Times; N.B.A. Needs To Hit Shaq Much Harder |author=Ira Berkow |date=January 16, 2002 | work=The New York Times[/tpl] For the season, O'Neal averaged 27.2 points and 10.7 rebounds, excellent statistics but below his career average; he was less of a defensive force during the season.
Matched up against the Sacramento Kings in the 2002 Western Conference finals, O'Neal said, "There is only one way to beat us. It starts with c and ends with t." O'Neal meant "cheat" in reference to the alleged flopping of Kings' center Vlade Divac. O'Neal referred to Divac as "she", and said he would never exaggerate contact to draw a foul. "I'm a guy with no talent who has gotten this way with hard work." After the 2001-2002 season, O'Neal told friends that he did not want another season of limping and being in virtually constant pain from his big right toe. His trademark mobility and explosion had been often absent. The corrective options ranged from reconstructive surgery on the toe to rehabilitation exercises with more shoe inserts and anti-inflammation medication. O'Neal was already wary of the long-term damage his frequent consumption of these medications might have. He did not want to rush a decision with his career potentially at risk.

The Lakers started the season with a record of 11–19.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2003_games.html | title = 2002–03 Los Angeles Lakers Schedule and Results | accessdate =October 13, 2010 | work=basketball-reference.com[/tpl]  After the Lakers fell to the fifth seed and failed to reach the Finals in 2003, the team made a concerted off-season effort to improve its roster. They sought the free-agent services of forward Karl Malone and aging guard Gary Payton, but due to salary cap restrictions, could not offer either one nearly as much money as they could have made with some other teams. O'Neal assisted in the recruitment efforts and personally persuaded both men to join the squad. Ultimately, both signed, each forgoing larger salaries in favor of a chance to win an NBA championship, which neither had accomplished in his career (and which neither would achieve with the Lakers). At the beginning of the 2003–04 season, O'Neal wanted a contract extension with a pay raise on his remaining three years for $30 million. The Lakers had hoped O'Neal would take less money due to his age, physical conditioning, and games missed due to injuries. During a preseason game, O'Neal had yelled at Lakers owner Jerry Buss, "Pay me."Lazenby 2006, p. 421. There had been increasing tension between O'Neal and Bryant, the feud climaxing on the eve of training camp prior to the 2003-2004 season when Kobe, in an interview with ESPN journalist Jim Gray, criticized Shaq for being out of shape, a poor leader, and putting his salary demands over the best interest of the Lakers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1648431|title=Kobe critical of Shaq's leadership|publisher=ESPN|date=October 28, 2003|accessdate=December 9, 2011[/tpl]
The Lakers made the playoffs in 2004, and lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals. Lakers assistant coach Tex Winter said, "Shaq defeated himself against Detroit. He played way too passively. He had one big game ... He's always interested in being a scorer, but he hasn't had nearly enough concentration on defense and rebounding."Lazenby 2006, p. 428. After the series, O'Neal was angered by comments made by Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak regarding O'Neal's future with the club, as well as by the departure of Lakers coach Phil Jackson at the request of Buss. O'Neal made comments indicating that he felt the team's decisions were centered on a desire to appease Bryant to the exclusion of all other concerns, and O'Neal promptly demanded a trade. Kupchak wanted the Dallas Mavericks's Dirk Nowitzki in return but Cuban refused to let his 7-footer go. However, Miami showed interest and eventually the two clubs agreed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/5397513/|publisher=NBC|title=Shaq happy, Lakers in shock after trade|date=July 15, 2004|accessdate=December 9, 2011[/tpl] Winter said, "O'Neal left because he couldn't get what he wanted—a huge pay raise. There was no way ownership could give him what he wanted. Shaq's demands held the franchise hostage, and the way he went about it didn't please the owner too much."Lazenby 2006, p. 434.

===Miami Heat (2004–2008)===

On July 14, 2004, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Caron Butler, Lamar Odom, Brian Grant and a future first-round draft choice. O'Neal reverted from (his Lakers jersey) number 34 to number 32, which he had worn while playing for the Magic. Upon signing with the Heat, O'Neal promised the fans that he would bring a championship to Miami. He claimed one of the main reasons for wanting to be traded to Miami was because of their up-and-coming star, Dwyane Wade. With O'Neal on board, the new-look Heat surpassed expectations, claiming the best record in the Eastern Conference in 2004-05. He averaged 22.9 ppg and 10.4 rpg, made his 12th consecutive All-Star Team, and made the All-NBA 1st Team. Despite being hobbled by a deep thigh bruise, O'Neal led the Heat to the Eastern Conference Finals and a Game 7 against the defending champion Detroit Pistons, losing by a narrow margin. Afterwards, O'Neal and others criticized Heat head coach Stan Van Gundy for not calling enough plays for O'Neal. O'Neal also narrowly lost the 2004–05 MVP Award to Phoenix Suns guard Steve Nash in one of the closest votes in NBA history.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2005.html | publisher=Basketball Reference | title = 2004–05 NBA Awards Voting | accessdate =June 1, 2011 [/tpl]
In August 2005, O'Neal signed a 5-year-extension with the Heat for $100 million. Supporters applauded O'Neal's willingness to take what amounted to a pay cut and the Heat's decision to secure O'Neal's services for the long term. They contended that O'Neal was worth more than $20 million per year, particularly given that lesser players earned almost the same amount.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]
In the second game of the 2005–06 season, O'Neal injured his right ankle and subsequently missed the following 18 games. Upon O'Neal's return, Van Gundy resigned, citing family reasons, and Pat Riley assumed head coach responsibilities. Many critics stated that Heat coach Riley correctly managed O'Neal during the rest of the season, limiting his minutes to a career low. Riley felt doing so would allow O'Neal to be healthier and fresher come playoff time. Although O'Neal averaged career lows (or near-lows) in points, rebounds, and blocks, he said in an interview "Stats don't matter. I care about winning, not stats. If I score 0 points and we win I'm happy. If I score 50, 60 points, break the records, and we lose, I'm pissed off. 'Cause I knew I did something wrong. I'll have a hell of a season if I win the championship and average 20 points a game." During the 2005–06 season, the Heat recorded only a .500 record without O'Neal in the line-up.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]
On April 11, 2006, O'Neal recorded his second career triple-double against the Toronto Raptors with 15 points, 11 rebounds and a career high 10 assists. O'Neal finished the 2005-2006 season as the league leader in field goal percentage.

====Fourth championship====

In the 2006 NBA Playoffs, the Miami Heat won their first NBA Championship. Led by both O'Neal and eventual Finals MVP Dwyane Wade, the 2nd seeded Heat defeated the defending Eastern Conference Champion and top-seeded Detroit Pistons in a rematch of the prior year's Conference Finals. They then defeated the Dallas Mavericks in the 2006 NBA Finals.
O'Neal put up considerably lower numbers in the 2005-2006 playoffs compared to those he recorded during the regular season, but he twice delivered dominant games in order to close out a playoff series: a 30 point, 20 rebound effort in Game 6 against the Chicago Bulls in the first round, and a 28 point, 16 rebound, 5 block effort in Game 6 against the Pistons. It was O'Neal's fourth title in seven seasons, and fulfilled his promise of delivering an NBA championship to Miami.

====Surgery and Wade's injury====

In the [tpl]NBA Year|2006|app=season[/tpl], O'Neal missed 35 games after an injury to his left knee in November required surgery. After one of those missed games, a Christmas Day match-up against the Lakers, he ripped Jackson, who O'Neal had once called a second father, referring to his former coach as Benedict Arnold. Jackson had previously said, "The only person I've ever coached that hasn't been a worker ... is probably Shaq." The Heat struggled during O'Neal's absence, but with his return won seven of their next eight games. Bad luck still haunted the squad, however, as Wade dislocated his left shoulder, leaving O'Neal as the focus of the team. Critics doubted that O'Neal, now in his mid-thirties, could carry the team into the playoffs. The Heat went on a winning streak that kept them in the race for a playoff spot, which they finally secured against the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 5.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2010[/tpl]
In a rematch of the year before, the Heat faced the Bulls in the first round of the 2006-2007 NBA playoffs. The Heat struggled against the Bulls and although O'Neal put up reasonable numbers, he was not able to dominate the series. The Bulls swept the Heat, the first time in 50 years a defending NBA champion was swept in the opening round.O'Neal, MacMullan 2011 p. 206. It was the first time in 13 years that O'Neal did not advance into the second round. In the 2006–07 season O'Neal reached 25,000 career points, becoming the 14th player in NBA history to accomplish that milestone. However, it was the first season in O'Neal's career that his scoring average dropped below 20 points per game.

====2007–2008 season====

O'Neal experienced a rough start for the 2007–08 season, averaging career lows in points, rebounds and blocks. His role in the offense diminished, as he attempted only 10 field goals per game, versus his career average of 17. In addition, O'Neal was plagued by fouls, and during one stretch fouled out of five consecutive games. O'Neal's streak of 14 straight All-Star appearances ended that season. O'Neal again missed games due to injuries, and the Heat had a 15–game losing streak.[tpl]cite book |last1=O'Neal |first1=Shaquille |last2=MacMullan |first2=Jackie |title=Shaq Uncut: My Story |pages=210–11 |year=2011 |publisher=Grand Central Publishing |isbn=978-1-4555-0441-1|ref=oneal2011[/tpl] According to O'Neal, Riley thought he was faking the injury.O'Neal, MacMullan 2011, p. 212. During a practice in February 2008, O'Neal got into an altercation with Riley over the coach ordering a tardy Jason Williams to leave practice. The two argued face-to-face, with O'Neal poking Riley in the chest and Riley slapping his finger away. Riley soon after decided to trade O'Neal.O'Neal, MacMullan 2011, pp. 215–16. O'Neal said his relationship with Wade was not "all that good" by the time he left Miami, but he did not express disappointment at Wade for failing to stand up for him.O'Neal, MacMullan 2011, p. 216.
O'Neal played 33 games for the Miami Heat in the 2007-2008 season prior to being traded to the Phoenix Suns.  O'Neal started all 33 games and averaged 14.2 points per game.  Following the trade to Phoenix, O'Neal averaged 12.9 ppg while starting all 28 games with the Suns.

===Phoenix Suns (2008–2009)===

The Phoenix Suns acquired O'Neal in February 2008 from the league-worst Miami Heat, who had a record at the time of the trade of 9-37, in exchange for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks. O'Neal made his Suns debut on February 20, 2008 against his former Lakers team, scoring 15 points and grabbing 9 rebounds in the process. The Lakers won, 130–124. O'Neal was upbeat in a post-game press conference, stating: "I will take the blame for this loss because I wasn't in tune with the guys ... But give me four or five days to really get in tune and I'll get it."[tpl]cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/dailydime?page=dime-080221 |title=Daily Dime: Shaq gets the spotlight, while Kobe gets the game |work=ESPN .com|date=February 21, 2008[/tpl]
In 28 regular-season games, O'Neal averaged 12.9 points and 10.6 rebounds,Shaquille O'Neal career stats and splits NBA.com good enough to make the playoffs. One of the reasons for the trade was to limit Tim Duncan in the event of a postseason matchup between the Suns and the San Antonio Spurs, especially after the Suns' six-game elimination by the Spurs in the 2007 NBA Playoffs.[tpl]cite news| url=http://dimemag.com/2008/02/06/why-shaq-heres-why/ |title=Why Shaq? Here's Why |author=Austin Burton| work=dimemag.com[/tpl] O'Neal and the Phoenix Suns did face the Spurs in the first round of the playoffs, but they were once again eliminated, in five games. O'Neal averaged 15.2 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game.
O'Neal preferred his new situation with the Suns over the Heat. "I love playing for this coach and I love playing with these guys," O'Neal said. "We have professionals who know what to do. No one is asking me to play with former Heat teammates Chris Quinn or Ricky Davis. I'm actually on a team again." Riley felt O'Neal was wrong for maligning his former teammates. O'Neal responded with an expletive toward Riley, who he often referred to as the "great Pat Riley" while playing for the Heat. O'Neal credited the Suns training staff with prolonging his career.O'Neal, MacMullan p. 221. They connected his arthritic toe, which would not bend, to the alteration of his jump that consequently was straining his leg. The trainers had him concentrate on building his core strength, flexibility, and balance.O'Neal, MacMullan p. 213.
The 2008–09 season improved for O'Neal, who averaged 18 pts, 9 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks through the first half (41 games) of the season, leading the Suns to a 23–18 record and 2nd place in their division.[tpl]cite web |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/players/847 |title=Player profile – Shaquille O'Neal |work=yahoo.com[/tpl] He returned to the All-Star Game in 2009 and emerged as co-MVP along with ex-teammate Kobe Bryant.
On February 27, 2009, O'Neal scored 45 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, his 49th career 40-point game, beating the Toronto Raptors 133–113.
In a matchup against Orlando on March 3, 2009, O'Neal was outscored by Magic center Dwight Howard, 21–19. "I'm really too old to be trying to outscore 18-year-olds," O'Neal said, referring to the then 23-year-old Howard. "It's not really my role anymore." O'Neal was double-teamed most of the night. "I like to play people one-on-one. My whole career I had to play people one-on-one. Never once had to double or ask for a double. But it's cool," said O'Neal. During the game, O'Neal flopped against Howard. Magic coach Stan Van Gundy, who had coached O'Neal with the Heat, was "very disappointed cause O'Neal knows what it's like. Let's stand up and play like men, and I think our guy did that tonight."  O'Neal responded, "Flopping is playing like that your whole career. I was trying to take the charge, trying to get a call. It probably was a flop, but flopping is the wrong use of words. Flopping would describe his coaching."  Mark Madsen, a Lakers teammate of O'Neal's for three years, found it amusing since "everyone in the league tries to flop on Shaq and Shaq never flops back." In a 2006 interview in TIME, O'Neal said if he were NBA commissioner, he would "Make a guy have to beat a guy—not flop and get calls and be nice to the referees and kiss ass."
On March 6, O'Neal talked about the upcoming game against the Rockets and Yao Ming. “It’s not going to be man-on-man, so don’t even try that,” says O’Neal with an incredulous laugh. “They’re going to double and triple me like everybody else ... I rarely get to play Yao one-on-one ... But when I play him (on defense), it’s just going to be me down there. So don’t try to make it a Yao versus Shaq thing, when it’s Shaq versus four other guys."
The 2009 NBA Playoffs was also the first time since O'Neal's rookie season in 1992–93 that he did not participate in the playoffs. He was named as a member of the All-NBA Third Team. The Suns notified O'Neal he might be traded to cut costs.O'Neal, MacMullan 2011, p. 213.

===Cleveland Cavaliers (2009–2010)===

On June 25, 2009, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Sasha Pavlovic, Ben Wallace, $500,000 and a 2010 second round draft pick.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/news/shaq_trade_090625.html |title=Cavaliers Acquire 15-Time NBA All-Star and Four-Time NBA Champion Shaquille ONeal |date=June 25, 2009 |work=NBA.com |accessdate=June 25, 2009[/tpl] Upon arriving in Cleveland, O'Neal said, "My motto is very simple: Win a Ring for the King," referring to LeBron James.The Shaq Show: O'Neal Wants a Ring for the King James was the leader of the team, and O'Neal deferred to him.O'Neal, MacMullan 2011, pp. 234–37.
On Friday, February 25, 2010 O'Neal suffered a severe right thumb injury while attempting to go up for a shot against Glen Davis of the Boston Celtics."Cleveland Cavaliers' Shaquille O'Neal leaves game with 'significant thumb injury". Associated Press. February 25, 2010. Retrieved March 1, 2010.  He had surgery on the thumb on March 1 and returned to play on April 17 in the first round playoff game against the Chicago Bulls.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20100417/CHICLE/gameinfo.html |title=The Game Happens Here |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=August 5, 2010[/tpl]
O'Neal averaged career lows in almost every major statistical category, taking on a much less significant role than in previous years. His presence in the post was not as significant as in years past. After the retirement of Lindsey Hunter on March 5, O'Neal became the NBA’s oldest active player. He returned to the starting line-up in time for the 2010 NBA Playoffs. The Cavaliers swiftly defeated the Chicago Bulls in the first round, yet Cleveland became the first team in NBA history to miss the NBA Finals after laying claim to the NBA's top playoff seed for two consecutive seasons. On May 13, the Cavaliers were eliminated from the playoffs, losing to the Boston Celtics 4–2 in the Eastern Conference semifinals.

===Boston Celtics (2010–2011)===

Upon hearing Bryant comment that he had more rings than O'Neal, Wyc Grousbeck, principal owner of the Celtics, saw an opportunity to acquire O'Neal. Celtics coach Doc Rivers agreed to the signing on the condition that O'Neal would not receive preferential treatment nor could he cause any locker room problems like in Los Angeles or Miami.O'Neal, MacMullan 2011, pp. 243–44. On August 4, 2010, the Celtics announced that they had signed O'Neal.[tpl]cite news|author=Boston Celtics|url=http://www.nba.com/celtics/news/press_release/press080410-celtics-sign-shaq.html|title=Celtics Sign Shaquille O'Neal |publisher=NBA.com/Celtics|date=August 4, 2010[/tpl] The contract was for two years at the veteran minimum salary for a total contract value of $2.8 million. O'Neal wanted the larger mid-level exception contract, but the Celtics chose instead to give it to Jermaine O'Neal.O'Neal, MacMullan 2011, p. 241. The Atlanta Hawks and the Dallas Mavericks also expressed interest but had stalled on O'Neal's salary demands. He was introduced by the Celtics on August 10, 2010, and chose the number 36.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2010/08/11/a_large_addition_to_celtics_sizeable_history/ |title=A large addition to Celtics' sizeable history – The Boston Globe |publisher=www.boston.com |accessdate=August 10, 2010 | first=Dan | last=Shaughnessy | date=August 11, 2010[/tpl]
O'Neal said he didn't "compete with little guys who run around dominating the ball, throwing up 30 shots a night—like D–Wade, Kobe." O'Neal added that he was only competing against Duncan: "If Tim Duncan gets five rings, then that gives some writer the chance to say 'Duncan is the best,' and I can't have that." Publicly, he insisted he did not care whether he started or substituted for the Celtics, but expected to be part of the second unit. Privately, he wanted to start, but kept it to himself.O'Neal, MacMullan 2011, p. 244.

==International career==

While at LSU, O'Neal was considered for the Dream Team to fill the college spot, but it eventually went to future teammate Christian Laettner.ESPN http://espn.go.com/nba/player/bio/_/id/614/shaquille-oneal His international career began in the 1994 FIBA World Championship in which he was named MVP of the Tournament. While he led Dream Team II to the gold medal with an 8–0 record, O'Neal averaged 18 points and 8.5 rebounds and recorded two double-doubles. In four games, he scored more than 20 points. Before 2010, he was the last active American player to have a gold from the FIBA World Championships.
He was one of two players (the other being Reggie Miller) from the 1994 roster to be also named to the Dream Team III. Due to more star-power, he rotated with Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson and started 3 games. He averaged 9.3 points and 5.3 points with 8 total blocks. Again, a perfect 8–0 record landed him another gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. O'Neal was upset that coach Lenny Wilkens played Robinson more minutes in the final game; Wilkins previously explained to O'Neal that it would probably be Robinson's last Olympics.O'Neal, MacMullan 2011, p. 112.
After his 1996 experience, he declined to play in international competition. He was angered by being overlooked for the FIBA Americas Championship 1999 squad, saying it was a "lack of respect".Jackie MacMullan The NBA, Sports Illustrated, March 29, 1999.

His physical frame gave him a power advantage over most opponents.
O'Neal's "drop step", (called the "Black Tornado" by O'Neal) in which he posted up a defender, turned around and, using his elbows for leverage, powered past him for a very high-percentage slam dunk, proved an effective offensive weapon. In addition, O'Neal frequently used a right-handed jump hook shot to score near the basket. The ability to dunk contributed to his career field goal accuracy of .582, second only to Artis Gilmore as the highest field goal percentage of all time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/FGP_career.html |title=Career Leaders and Records for Field Goal Pct |publisher=Basketball-reference.com |accessdate=December 29, 2010[/tpl] He led the NBA in field goal percentage 10 times, breaking Wilt Chamberlain's record of nine.
Opposing teams often used up many fouls on O'Neal, reducing the playing time of their own big men. O'Neal's imposing physical presence inside the paint caused dramatic changes in many teams' offensive and defensive strategies.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=280429024|title=Phoenix Suns vs. San Antonio Spurs - Recap - April 29, 2008|publisher=ESPN|date=April 29, 2008|accessdate=December 9, 2011[/tpl]

On his own half of the hardwood, O'Neal was a capable defender, named three times to the All-NBA Second Defensive Team.
