Samael ([tpl]lang-he|סמאל[/tpl]) (Severity of God) (also Sammael or Samil) is an important archangel in Talmudic and post-Talmudic lore, a figure who is accuser, seducer and destroyer, and has been regarded as both good and evil. It is said that he was the guardian angel of Esau and a patron of the Roman empire.
He is considered in Talmudic texts to be a member of the heavenly host (with often grim and destructive duties). One of Samael's greatest roles in Jewish lore is that of the angel of death. He remains one of the Lord's servants even though he appears to want men to do evil. As a good angel, Samael resides in the seventh heaven, although he is declared to be the chief angel of the fifth heaven. The reason for this being the presence of the throne of glory in the fifth heaven.Ascension of Isaiah

==In Judaism==

In Jewish lore, Samael is said to be the angel of death, the chief ruler of the Fifth Heaven and one of the seven regents of the world served by two million angels; he resides in the Heaven. Yalkut[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] I, 110 of the Talmud speaks of Samael as Esau's guardian angel. Samael is also sometimes identified as being the angelic antagonist who wrestled with Jacob, and also the angel who held back the arm of Abraham as he was about to sacrifice his son.
According to The Ascension of MosesLouis Ginzberg, The Ascension of Moses, Chapter IV "Aggadah: The Legend of the Jews" Samael is also mentioned as being in 7th Heaven:
In The Holy Kabbalah (Arthur Edward Waite, 255), Samael is described as the "severity of God", and is listed as fifth of the archangel of the world of Briah.
Samael is sometimes confused in some books with Camael, an archangel of God, whose name is similar to words meaning "like God" (but Camael with a waw missing).
It is also said that the Baal Shem once summoned Samael, to make him do his bidding.Tales of the Hasidim, by Martin Buber. Book 1, page 77.

==In Demonology==

According to some myths , Samael was mated with Eisheth Zenunim, Na'amah, Lilith and Agrat Bat Mahlat—all except Lilith being 'angels' of  sacred prostitution.(Erika D. Johnson) rosetta.bham.ac.uk citing The Oxford Classical Dictionary definition 2012-12-13
It should be noted, however, that this link is a dubious one and likely arises from a case of mistaken identity equating Samael with the demon Azazel whom is himself in Zoharistic lore a combination of the angels Azael and Aza.(Rav Michael Laitman, PhD)

==In Gnosticism==

In the Apocryphon of John, found in the Nag Hammadi library, Samael is the third name of the demiurge, whose other names are Yaldabaoth and Saklas. In this context, Samael means "the blind god",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_17378.html |title=Jewish Virtual Library |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05[/tpl] the theme of blindness running throughout gnostic works[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2010[/tpl].

==In anthroposophy==

To anthroposophists, Samael is known as one of the seven archangels:
Saint Gregory gives the seven archangels as Anael, Gabriel, Michael, Oriphiel, Raphael, Samael and Zachariel. They are all imagined to have a special assignment to act as a global zeitgeist ("time-spirit"), each for periods of about 3600 years. Since 1879, anthroposophists posit, Michael has been the leading time spirit. Four important archangels are also supposed to display periodic spiritual activity over the seasons: Raphael during the spring, Uriel during the summer, Michael during the autumn, and Gabriel during the winter. In anthroposophy, archangels may be good or evil; in particular, some of their rank are collaborators of Ahriman, whose purpose (anthroposophists believe) is to alienate humanity from the spiritual world and promote materialism and heartless technical control.
