CATEGORIES: People from County Galway, 1601 deaths, House of Burke, Year of birth unknown

Ulick Burke, 3rd Earl of Clanricarde, Irish peer, died 1601.    He was the son of Richard Burke, 2nd Earl of Clanricarde and Margaret O'Brien. He married Honora Burke, daughter of John Burke, on 25 November 1564 at Athenry, County Galway, Ireland.
He had long been a rebel against the  English Crown, and since the 1560s had instigated the Mac an Iarla wars in Connaught and Thomond, devastating much of the area, against his father, who was a staunch supporter of Elizabeth I. On his father's  death in 1582 it was uncertain who would inherit the title, Ulick or his brother, John. Ulick gained the succession by murdering John and acknowledging the supremacy of the Crown. He remained a loyal subject till his death.
