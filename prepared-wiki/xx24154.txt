Ulcerative colitis (Colitis ulcerosa, UC) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ulcerative colitis is a form of colitis, a disease of the colon (the largest portion of the large intestine), that includes characteristic ulcers, or open sores. The main symptom of active disease is usually constant diarrhea mixed with blood, of gradual onset. IBD is often confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).
Ulcerative colitis shares much in common with Crohn's disease, another form of IBD, but Crohn's disease can affect the whole gastrointestinal tract while ulcerative colitis only attacks the large intestine, and while ulcerative colitis can be cured by performing a total colectomy (i.e., removing the entire large intestine), surgery for Crohn's disease involves removing the damaged parts of the intestine and reconnecting the healthy parts, which does not cure Crohn's, as it can recur after surgery, mostly at the site of the intestinal anastomosis (connection) or in other areas. Ulcerative colitis is an intermittent disease, with periods of exacerbated symptoms, and periods that are relatively symptom-free. Although the symptoms of ulcerative colitis can sometimes diminish on their own, the disease usually requires treatment to go into remission. Ulcerative colitis has an incidence of 1 to 20 cases per 100,000 individuals per year, and a prevalence of 8 to 246 per 100,000 individuals.Danese, S. & Fiocci, C. (2011). Ulcerative colitis. The New England Journal of Medicine, 365:1713-1725.
The disease is more prevalent in northern countries of the world, as well as in northern areas of individual countries or other regions. Rates tend to be higher in more affluent countries, which may indicate the increased prevalence is due to increased rates of diagnosis. It may also indicate that an industrial or Western diet and lifestyle increases the prevalence of this disease, including symptoms which may or may not be related to ulcerative colitis. Although UC has no known cause, there is a presumed genetic component to susceptibility. The disease may be triggered in a susceptible person by environmental factors. Although dietary modification may reduce the discomfort of a person with the disease, ulcerative colitis is not thought to be caused by dietary factors.
Ulcerative colitis is treated as an autoimmune disease. Treatment is with anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppression, and biological therapy targeting specific components of the immune response. Colectomy (partial or total removal of the large bowel through surgery) is occasionally necessary if the disease is severe, doesn't respond to treatment, or if significant complications develop. A total proctocolectomy (removal of the entirety of the large bowel) can be "curative" (extraintestinal symptoms will remain), but it may be associated with complications.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kim|first=IK|coauthors=Park, KJ; Kang, GH; Im, JP; Kim, SG; Jung, HC; Song, IS; Kim, JS|title=Risk factors for complications after total colectomy in ulcerative colitis|journal=The Turkish journal of gastroenterology : the official journal of Turkish Society of Gastroenterology|date=October 2012|volume=23|issue=5|pages=Isayfa–Ssafya|pmid=23161324[/tpl] 

==Signs and symptoms==

===Gastrointestinal===

The clinical presentation[tpl]cite journal |author=Hanauer SB |last2=Hanauer |first2=Stephen B. |title=Inflammatory bowel disease |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=334 |issue=13 |pages=841–8 |year=1996 |pmid=8596552 |doi= 10.1056/NEJM199603283341307 [/tpl] of ulcerative colitis depends on the extent of the disease process. Patients usually present with diarrhea mixed with blood and mucus, of gradual onset that persists for an extended period (weeks). They may also have weight loss and blood on rectal examination. The inflammation caused by the disease along with chronic loss of blood from the GI tract leads to increased rates of anaemia. The disease may be accompanied with different degrees of abdominal pain, from mild discomfort to painful bowel movements or painful abdominal cramping with bowel movements.
Ulcerative colitis is associated with a general inflammatory process that affects many parts of the body. Sometimes these associated extra-intestinal symptoms are the initial signs of the disease, such as painful arthritic knees in a teenager and may be seen in adults also. The presence of the disease may not be confirmed immediately, however, until the onset of intestinal manifestations.

====Extent of involvement====

Ulcerative colitis is normally continuous from the rectum up the colon. The disease is classified by the extent of involvement, depending on how far up the colon the disease extends:

====Severity of disease====

===Extraintestinal features===

As ulcerative colitis is believed to have a systemic (i.e., autoimmune) origin, patients may present with comorbidities leading to symptoms and complications outside the colon. The frequency of such extraintestinal manifestations has been reported as anywhere between 6 and 47 percent.[tpl]cite journal|last=Langan|first=RC|coauthors=Gotsch, PB, Krafczyk, MA, Skillinge, DD|title=Ulcerative colitis: diagnosis and treatment |journal=American family physician|date=November 2007 |volume=76|issue=9|pages=1323–30 |pmid=18019875 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/1101/p1323.pdf [/tpl] These include the following:

==Causes==

There are no direct known causes for ulcerative colitis, but there are many possible factors such as genetics and stress.

===Genetic factors===

A genetic component to the etiology of ulcerative colitis can be hypothesized based on the following:[tpl]cite journal |author=Orholm M, Binder V, Sørensen TI, Rasmussen LP, Kyvik KO |title=Concordance of inflammatory bowel disease among Danish twins. Results of a nationwide study |journal=Scand. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=1075–81 |year=2000 |pmid=11099061 |doi= 10.1080/003655200451207[/tpl]
There are 12 regions of the genome that may be linked to ulcerative colitis, including, in the order of their discovery, chromosomes 16, 12, 6, 14, 5, 19, 1, and 3,[tpl]cite journal | author=Baumgart DC, Carding SR| title=Inflammatory bowel disease: cause and immunobiology| journal=The Lancet | volume=369 | issue=9573 | year=2007 | pages=1627–1640 | pmid=17499605 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60750-8[/tpl] but none of these loci have been consistently shown to be at fault, suggesting that the disorder arises from the combination of multiple genes. For example, chromosome band 1p36 is one such region thought to be linked to inflammatory bowel disease.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cho JH |title=Linkage and linkage disequilibrium in chromosome band 1p36 in American Chaldeans with inflammatory bowel disease |journal=Hum. Mol. Genet. |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages=1425–32 |year=2000 |pmid=10814724 |doi= 10.1093/hmg/9.9.1425|url=http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/9/1425.full.pdf |author-separator=, |author2=Nicolae DL |author3=Ramos R |display-authors=3 |last4=Fields |first4=CT |last5=Rabenau |first5=K |last6=Corradino |first6=S |last7=Brant |first7=SR |last8=Espinosa |first8=R |last9=Lebeau |first9=M [/tpl]
Some of the putative regions encode transporter proteins such as OCTN1 and OCTN2. Other potential regions involve cell scaffolding proteins such as the MAGUK family. There may even be human leukocyte antigen associations at work. In fact, this linkage on chromosome 6 may be the most convincing and consistent of the genetic candidates.
Multiple autoimmune disorders have been recorded with the neurovisceral and cutaneous genetic porphyrias including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, diabetes, systemic and discoid lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, scleroderma, Sjogren's disease and scleritis. Physicians should be on high alert for porphyrias in families with autoimmune disorders and care must be taken with potential porphyrinogenic drugs, including sulfasalazine.

===Environmental  factors===

Many hypotheses have been raised for environmental contributants to the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. They include the following:

===Autoimmune disease===

Ulcerative colitis is an autoimmune disease characterized by T-cells infiltrating the colon.[tpl]cite web|last=Ko, et al|first=In Kap|title=Targeting Improves MSC Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease|publisher=NCBI, National Institutes of Health|pmc=2911249[/tpl] In contrast to Crohn's disease, which can affect areas of the gastrointestinal tract outside of the colon, ulcerative colitis usually involves the rectum and is confined to the colon, with occasional involvement of the ileum. This so-called "backwash ileitis" can occur in 10–20% of patients with pancolitis and is believed to be of little clinical significance.Fauci et al. Harrison's Internal Medicine, 17th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill Medical, 2008. ISBN 978-0-07-159991-7 Ulcerative colitis can also be associated with comorbidities that produce symptoms in many areas of the body outside the digestive system. Surgical removal of the large intestine often cures the disease.

===Alternative theories===

Levels of sulfate-reducing bacteria tend to be higher in persons with ulcerative colitis. This could mean that there are higher levels of hydrogen sulfide in the intestine. An alternative theory suggests that the symptoms of the disease may be caused by toxic effects of the hydrogen sulfide on the cells lining the intestine.[tpl]cite journal |author=Roediger WE, Moore J, Babidge W |title=Colonic sulfide in pathogenesis and treatment of ulcerative colitis |journal=Dig. Dis. Sci. |volume=42 |issue=8 |pages=1571–9 |year=1997 |pmid=9286219 |doi= 10.1023/A:1018851723920|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/q212420164588062/fulltext.pdf [/tpl]

===Comparison to Crohn's disease===

Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the main types of inflammatory bowel disease, and may mimic each other to great extent, but differ somewhat in etiology and pathophysiology:

==Pathophysiology==

An increased amount of colonic sulfate-reducing bacteria has been observed in some patients with ulcerative colitis, resulting in higher concentrations of the toxic gas hydrogen sulfide. Human colonic mucosa is maintained by the colonic epithelial barrier and immune cells in the lamina propria. N-butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, gets oxidized through the beta oxidation pathway into carbon dioxide and ketone bodies. It has been shown that N-butyrate helps supply nutrients to this epithelial barrier. Studies have proposed that hydrogen sulfide plays a role in impairing this beta oxidation pathway by interrupting the short chain acetyl CoA dehydrogenase, an enzyme within the pathway. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the protective benefit of smoking in ulcerative colitis is due to the hydrogen cyanide from cigarette smoke reacting with hydrogen sulfide to produce the nontoxic isothiocyanate, thereby inhibiting sulfides from interrupting the pathway.[tpl]cite journal |author= Levine J. Ellis CJ. Frume JK, Springfield J. Levitt, MD |title=Fecal Hydrogen Sulfide Production in Ulcerative Colitis |journal=Am J Gastroenterology  |volume=98 |issue=8 |pages=83–87 |year=1998 |url=http://www.nature.com/ajg/journal/v93/n1/full/ajg199821a.html#bib21[/tpl] An unrelated study suggested that the sulphur contained in red meats and alcohol may lead to an increased risk of relapse for patients in remission.

==Diagnosis==

The initial diagnostic workup for ulcerative colitis includes the following:[tpl]cite journal |author=Kornbluth A, Sachar DB |title=Ulcerative colitis practice guidelines in adults (update): American College of Gastroenterology, Practice Parameters Committee |journal=Am. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=99 |issue=7 |pages=1371–85 |year=2004 |pmid=15233681 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2004.40036.x [/tpl][tpl]eMedicine|med|2336|Ulcerative colitis[/tpl]
Although ulcerative colitis is a disease of unknown causation, inquiry should be made as to unusual factors believed to trigger the disease. Factors may include: recent cessation of tobacco smoking; recent administration of large doses of iron or vitamin B6; hydrogen peroxide in enemas or other procedures.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl]

===Endoscopic===

The best test for diagnosis of ulcerative colitis remains endoscopy. Full colonoscopy to the cecum and entry into the terminal ileum is attempted only if diagnosis of UC is unclear. Otherwise, a flexible sigmoidoscopy is sufficient to support the diagnosis. The physician may elect to limit the extent of the exam if severe colitis is encountered to minimize the risk of perforation of the colon. Endoscopic findings in ulcerative colitis include the following:
Ulcerative colitis is usually continuous from the rectum, with the rectum almost universally being involved. There is rarely perianal disease, but cases have been reported. The degree of involvement endoscopically ranges from proctitis or inflammation of the rectum, to left sided colitis, to pancolitis, which is inflammation involving the ascending colon.

===Histologic===

Biopsies of the mucosa are taken to definitively diagnose UC and differentiate it from Crohn's disease, which is managed differently clinically. Microbiological samples are typically taken at the time of endoscopy. The pathology in ulcerative colitis typically involves distortion of crypt architecture, inflammation of crypts (cryptitis), frank crypt abscesses, and hemorrhage or inflammatory cells in the lamina propria. In cases where the clinical picture is unclear, the histomorphologic analysis often plays a pivotal role in determining the diagnosis and thus the management. By contrast, a biopsy analysis may be indeterminate, and thus the clinical progression of the disease must inform its treatment.

===Differential diagnosis===

The following conditions may present in a similar manner as ulcerative colitis, and should be excluded:
The most common disease that mimics the symptoms of ulcerative colitis is Crohn's disease, as both are inflammatory bowel diseases that can affect the colon with similar symptoms. It is important to differentiate these diseases, since the course of the diseases and treatments may be different. In some cases, however, it may not be possible to tell the difference, in which case the disease is classified as indeterminate colitis.

==Management==

Standard treatment for ulcerative colitis depends on extent of involvement and disease severity. The goal is to induce remission initially with medications, followed by the administration of maintenance medications to prevent a relapse of the disease. The concept of induction of remission and maintenance of remission is very important. The medications used to induce and maintain a remission somewhat overlap, but the treatments are different. Physicians first direct treatment to inducing a remission which involves relief of symptoms and mucosal healing of the lining of the colon and then longer term treatment to maintain the remission and prevent complications.

===Medication===

Ulcerative colitis can be treated with a number of medications including 5-ASA drugs such as Sulfasalazine and Mesalazine. Corticosteroids such as prednisone can also be used due to their immunosuppressing and short term healing properties, but due to the risks outweighing the benefits, they are not used long term in treatment. Immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine, and biological agents such as infliximab and adalimumab are given lastly, only if patients cannot achieve remission with 5-ASA and Corticosteroids, due to their possible risk factors, including, but not limited to increased risk of cancers in teenagers and adults, TB and new or worsening heart failure (these side effects are rare).  A formulation of budesonide was approved by the FDA for treatment of active ulcerative colitis in January 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.empr.com/uceris-approved-for-active-ulcerative-colitis/article/276075/ |title=Uceris Approved for Active Ulcerative Colitis |publisher=empr.com |date=2013-01-16 |accessdate=2013-01-16[/tpl]

====Aminosalicylates====

Sulfasalazine has been a major agent in the therapy of mild to moderate UC for over 50 years. In 1977, Mastan S. Kalsi et al. determined that 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA and mesalazine) was the therapeutically active in sulfasalazine.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl] Since then many 5-ASA compounds have been developed with the aim of maintaining efficacy but reducing the common side effects associated with the sulfapyridine moiety in sulfasalazine.[tpl]cite web | author=S. Kane |year=2006 | title=Asacol - A Review Focusing on Ulcerative Colitis|url=http://www.touchbriefings.com/pdf/1980/Kane_edit.pdf [/tpl]

====Biologics====

Biologic treatments such as TNF inhibitors Infliximab (trade name Remicade), adalimumab (trade name Humira) and Golimumab (trade name Simponi) are commonly used to treat patients with Ulcerative Colitis who are no longer responding to corticosteroids. Usually these medications are only used after other options have been exhausted (i.e. patient has received high dose corticosteroids, immunomodulators such as Azathioprine and Mesalazine) but in certain cases, patients may skip these steps and start biologic treatments under doctor orders.
Unlike Aminosalicylates, Biologics can cause harsh side effects such as mild heart failure or worsening of heart failure, skin cancer (excluding melanoma), weakening of the immune system leading to possible fatal infections and Tuberculosis. For this reason patients on these treatments are closely monitored and must be given tests for Hepatitis and Tuberculosis at least once a year. Blood tests must also be taken every 4–8 weeks.

====Nicotine====

Unlike Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis has a lesser prevalence in smokers than non-smokers. Patients who choose to use smoking as a treatment should keep a record regarding smoking cessation and the onset or relapse of ulcerative colitis to verify associations.[tpl]cite journal |author=Calkins BM |title=A meta-analysis of the role of smoking in inflammatory bowel disease|journal=Dig. Dis. Sci. |volume=34 |issue=12 |pages=1841–54 |year=1989 |pmid=2598752 |doi= 10.1007/BF01536701[/tpl][tpl]cite journal |author=Lakatos PL, Szamosi T, Lakatos L |title=Smoking in inflammatory bowel diseases: good, bad or ugly? |journal=World J Gastroenterol. |volume=13 |issue=46 |pages=6134–9 |year=2007 |pmid=18069751 |doi= 10.3748/wjg.13.6134[/tpl]
Studies using a transdermal nicotine patch have shown clinical and histological improvement.[tpl]cite journal |author=Guslandi M |title=Nicotine treatment for ulcerative colitis |journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=481–4 |date=October 1999 |pmid=10583016 |pmc=2014383 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2125.1999.00039.x/pdf |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2125.1999.00039.x[/tpl]
In one double-blind, placebo controlled, study conducted in the United Kingdom 48.6% of patients who used the nicotine patch, in conjunction with their standard treatment, showed complete resolution of symptoms. Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center clinical trial conducted in the United States showed that 39% of participants showed significant improvement vs. 9% of placebo.[tpl]cite journal |author=Sandborn WJ |title=Transdermal nicotine for mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=126 |issue=5 |pages=364–71 |date=March 1997 |pmid=9054280 |author-separator=, |author2=Tremaine WJ |author3=Offord KP |display-authors=3 |last4=Lawson |first4=GM |last5=Petersen |first5=BT |last6=Batts |first6=KP |last7=Croghan |first7=IT |last8=Dale |first8=LC |last9=Schroeder |first9=DR [/tpl] Use of a transdermal nicotine patch without the addition of other standard treatments such as mesalazine has relapse occurrence rates similar to standard treatment without the use of nicotine.

====Iron supplementation====

The gradual loss of blood from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as chronic inflammation, often leads to anemia, and professional guidelines suggest routinely monitoring for this with blood tests repeated 3 monthly in active disease and annually in quiescent disease.Gut 2011;60:1309-1316. [tpl]DOI|10.1136/gut.2010.228874[/tpl] Adequate disease control usually improves anemia of chronic disease, but iron deficiency anaemia should be treated with iron supplements. The form in which treatment is administered depends both on the severity of the anaemia as well as the guidelines that are followed. Some advise parenteral iron to be used first line as patients respond quicker, is associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects and is not associated with compliance issuesInflamm Bowel Dis 2007;13:1545–1553 Others require oral iron to be used as first line, as patients eventually respond and many will tolerate the side effects.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mowat C, Cole A, Windsor A, et al. |title=Guidelines for the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults |journal=Gut |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=571–607 |date=May 2011 |pmid=21464096 |doi=10.1136/gut.2010.224154[/tpl] All do advise than in severe anaemia (a Hemoglobin less than 10) parenteral iron is administered.

====Treatments in development====

Inflammation of the colon is a characteristic symptom of ulcerative colitis and a new series of drugs in development look to disrupt the inflammation process by selectively targeting an ion channel. A crucial step involved in the inflammation signaling cascade involves an intermediate conductance calcium activated potassium channel (IK channel) known as KCa3.1;Ghanshani, S., Wulff, H., Miller, M. J., Rohm, H., Neben, A., Gutman, G. A., ... & Chandy, K. G. (2000). Up-regulation of the IKCa1 potassium channel during T-cell activation Molecular mechanism and functional consequences" Journal of Biological Chemistry 275(47), 37137-37149.[tpl]primary source-inline|date=May 2013[/tpl] a protein coded for in the human gene KCNN4.Wei AD, Gutman GA, Aldrich R, et al. (2006). "International Union of Pharmacology. LII. Nomenclature and molecular relationships of calcium-activated potassium channels." Pharmacol. Rev 57 (4)  463–72. Ongoing research seeks to prevent T-cell activation and inflammation by inhibiting the KCa3.1 channel, selectively.Strøbæk, D., Brown, D. T., Jenkins, D. P., Chen, Y. J., Coleman, N., Ando, Y., ... & Christophersen, P. (2013). NS6180, a new KCa3. 1 channel inhibitor prevents T‐cell activation and inflammation in a rat model of inflammatory bowel disease" British Journal of Pharmacology 168(2), 432-444.[tpl]primary source-inline|date=May 2013[/tpl] Since there is an upregulation of IK channel activity during T cell activation,[tpl]primary source-inline|date=May 2013[/tpl] inhibition of the KCa3.1 is able to disrupt the production of Th1 cytokines IL-2 and TNF-∝. Production of these cytokines decreases because inhibition of KCa3.1 reduces the efflux of K+ which in turn diminishes the influx of Ca2+. By lowering elevated intracellular Ca2+ in patients with ulcerative colitis these novel drug candidates can inhibit the signaling cascade involved in the inflammation process[tpl]primary source-inline|date=May 2013[/tpl] and help relieve many of the symptoms associated with ulcerative colitis.
Preclinical study results in 2012 indicated that these selective inhibitors decreased colon inflammation in mice and rats cloned with the human KCa3.1 protein as effectively as the standard inflammatory bowel disease treatment of sulfasalazine. However, these novel selective IK channel blockers are significantly more potent and theoretically would be able to taken at a much more manageable dosage.[tpl]primary source-inline|date=May 2013[/tpl]
Benzothiazinone, NS6180, is a novel class KCa3.1 channel inhibitor in development.Through a number of in vitro experiments, NS6180 was qualified for KCa3.1 channel inhibition. In vivo experiment  of DNBS (2,4 - dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid) induced rat colitis, a frequently used animal model for inflammatory bowel disease, showed comparable efficacy and greater potency than sulfasalazine.[tpl]primary source-inline|date=May 2013[/tpl]

===Surgery===

Unlike Crohn's disease, the gastrointestinal aspect ulcerative colitis can generally be cured by surgical removal of the large intestine, also known as a colectomy. This procedure is necessary in the event of: exsanguinating hemorrhage, frank perforation or documented or strongly suspected carcinoma. Surgery is also indicated for patients with severe colitis or toxic megacolon. Patients with symptoms that are disabling and do not respond to drugs may wish to consider whether surgery would improve the quality of life.
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a disease that affects many parts of the body outside the intestinal tract. In rare cases the extra-intestinal manifestations of the disease may require removal of the colon.
Another surgical option for ulcerative colitis that is affecting most of the large bowel is called the ileo-anal pouch procedure. This procedure is a two- to three-step procedure in which the large bowel is removed, except for the rectal stump and anus, and a temporary ileostomy is made. The next part of the surgery can be done in one or two steps and is usually done at six to twelve month intervals from each prior surgery.
In the next step of the surgery an internal pouch is made of the patients' own small bowel and this pouch is then hooked back up internally to the rectal stump so that patient can once again have a reasonably functioning bowel system, all internal. The temporary ileostomy can be reversed at this time so that the patient is now internalized for bowel functions, or in another step to the procedure, the pouch and rectal stump anastamosis can be left inside the patient to heal for some time, while the patient still uses the ileostomy for bowel function. Then on a subsequent surgery the ileostomy is reversed and the patient has internalized bowel function again.

===Bacterial recolonization===

===Alternative medicine===

About 21% of inflammatory bowel disease patients use alternative treatments.[tpl]cite journal |author=Bensoussan M |title=Complementary and alternative medicine use by patients with inflammatory bowel disease: results from a postal survey | journal = Gastroentérologie Clinique et Biologique |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=14–23 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16514377 |doi= 10.1016/S0399-8320(06)73072-X|url=http://www.em-consulte.com/showarticlefile/100306/index.pdf |author-separator=, |author2=Jovenin N |author3=Garcia B |display-authors=3 |last4=Vandromme |first4=L |last5=Jolly |first5=D |last6=Bouche |first6=O |last7=Thiefin |first7=G |last8=Cadiot |first8=G [/tpl] A variety of dietary treatments show promise, but they require further research before they can be recommended.[tpl]cite journal |author=Shah S |title=Dietary factors in the modulation of inflammatory bowel disease activity |journal=MedGenMed |volume=9 |issue=1 |page=60 |year=2007 |pmid=17435660 |pmc=1925010 |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/553039[/tpl]
In vitro research, animal evidence, and limited human study suggest that melatonin may be beneficial.[tpl]cite journal |author=Terry PD, Villinger F, Bubenik GA, Sitaraman SV |title=Melatonin and ulcerative colitis: evidence, biological mechanisms, and future research |journal=Inflamm.

Dietary fiber, meaning indigestible plant matter, has been recommended for decades in the maintenance of bowel function. Of peculiar note is fiber from brassica, which seems to contain soluble constituents capable of reversing ulcers along the entire human digestive tract before it is cooked. Oatmeal is also commonly prescribed.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2012[/tpl]

==Prognosis==

===Progression or remission===

Patients with ulcerative colitis usually have an intermittent course, with periods of disease inactivity alternating with "flares" of disease. Patients with proctitis or left-sided colitis usually have a more benign course: only 15% progress proximally with their disease, and up to 20% can have sustained remission in the absence of any therapy. Patients with more extensive disease are less likely to sustain remission, but the rate of remission is independent of the severity of disease.

===Ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer===

There is a significantly increased risk of colorectal cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis after ten years if involvement is beyond the splenic flexure. Those with only proctitis or rectosigmoiditis usually have no increased risk. It is recommended that patients have screening colonoscopies with random biopsies to look for dysplasia after eight years of disease activity, at one to two year intervals.[tpl]cite journal |author=Leighton JA |title=ASGE guideline: endoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease |journal=Gastrointest.

[/tpl]

===Primary sclerosing cholangitis===

Ulcerative colitis has a significant association with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a progressive inflammatory disorder of small and large bile ducts. As many as 5% of patients with ulcerative colitis may progress to develop primary sclerosing cholangitis.[tpl]cite journal |author=Olsson R |title=Prevalence of primary sclerosing cholangitis in patients with ulcerative colitis |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=100 |issue=5 Pt 1 |pages=1319–23 |year=1991|pmid=2013375 |author-separator=, |author2=Danielsson A |author3=Järnerot G |display-authors=3 |last4=Lindström |first4=E |last5=Lööf |first5=L |last6=Rolny |first6=P |last7=Rydén |first7=BO |last8=Tysk |first8=C |last9=Wallerstedt |first9=S [/tpl]

===Mortality===

Research has not revealed any difference in overall risk of dying in patients with Ulcerative colitis from that of the background population. The cause-of-death distribution may be different from that of the background population.[tpl]cite journal|last=Jess|first=T|coauthors=Gamborg, M; Munkholm, P; Sørensen, TI|title=Overall and cause-specific mortality in ulcerative colitis: meta-analysis of population-based inception cohort studies|journal=The American journal of gastroenterology|date=March 2007|year=2007|volume=102|issue=3|pages=609–17|pmid=17156150|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17156150|accessdate=22 December 2012|doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2006.01000.x[/tpl] It is thought that the disease primarily affects quality of life, and not lifespan.

===Other long-term features===

Changes that can be seen in chronic ulcerative colitis include granularity, loss of the vascular pattern of the mucosa, loss of haustra, effacement of the ileocecal valve, mucosal bridging, strictures[tpl]Disambiguation needed|date=February 2013[/tpl] and pseudopolyps.Page 481 in: Colonic diseases.

==Epidemiology==

The incidence of ulcerative colitis in North America is 10–12 cases per 100,000 per year, with a peak incidence of ulcerative colitis occurring between the ages of 15 and 25. Prevalence is 1 per 1000. There is thought to be a bimodal distribution in age of onset, with a second peak in incidence occurring in the 6th decade of life. The disease affects females more than males.
The geographic distribution of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease is similar worldwide,[tpl]cite journal|author=Podolsky DK |title=Inflammatory bowel disease |journal=N. Engl. J.

Higher incidences are seen in northern locations compared to southern locations in Europe[tpl]cite journal |author=Shivananda S |title=Incidence of inflammatory bowel disease across Europe: is there a difference between north and south?

As with Crohn's disease, the prevalence of ulcerative colitis is greater among Ashkenazi Jews and decreases progressively in other persons of Jewish descent, non-Jewish Caucasians, Africans, Hispanics, and Asians.

==Research==

Helminthic therapy using the whipworm Trichuris suis has been shown in a randomized control trial from Iowa to show benefit in patients with ulcerative colitis.[tpl]cite journal|last=Summers|first=RW|coauthors=Elliott, DE; Urban JF, Jr; Thompson, RA; Weinstock, JV|title=Trichuris suis therapy for active ulcerative colitis: a randomized controlled trial|journal=Gastroenterology|date=April 2005|year=2005|volume=128|issue=4|pages=825–32|pmid=15825065|url=http://tropicalhealthsolutions.com/documents/worms/Summers-2005.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2012|doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2005.01.005[/tpl] The therapy tests the hygiene hypothesis which argues that the absence of helminths in the colons of patients in the developed world may lead to inflammation. Both helminthic therapy and fecal bacteriotherapy induce a characteristic Th2 white cell response in the diseased areas, which was unexpected given that ulcerative colitis was thought to involve Th2 overproduction.[tpl]cite journal|author=Summers RW, Elliott DE, Urban JF, Thompson RA, Weinstock JV |title=Trichuris suis therapy for active ulcerative colitis: a randomized controlled trial |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=128 |issue=4 |pages=825–32 |year=2005 |pmid=15825065 |doi= 10.1053/j.gastro.2005.01.005 [/tpl]
Alicaforsen is a first generation antisense oligodeoxynucleotide designed to bind specifically to the human ICAM-1 messenger RNA  through Watson-Crick base pair interactions in order to subdue expression of ICAM-1.[tpl]cite journal|author=Bennett CF, Condon TC, Grimm S, Chan H, Chiang MY |title=Inhibition of endothelial cell-leukocyte adhesion molecule expression with antisense oligonucleotides |journal=J Immunol |volume=152 |issue=1 |pages=3530–40 |year=1994 [/tpl] ICAM-1 propagates an inflammatory response promoting the extravasation and activation of leukocytes (white blood cells) into inflamed tissue. Increased expression of ICAM-1 has been observed within the inflamed intestinal mucosa of ulcerative colitis sufferers, where ICAM-1 over production correlated with disease activity.[tpl]cite journal|author=Jones SC, Banks RE, Haider A et al | title= Adhesion molecules in inflammatory bowel disease |journal=Gut |volume=36 |pages=724–30 |year=1995|doi=10.1136/gut.36.5.724|pmid=7541009|issue=5|pmc=1382677 [/tpl] This suggests that ICAM-1 is a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.[tpl]cite journal|author=Van Deventer SJH, Wedel MK, Baker BF, Xia S, Chuang E, Miner Jr PB | title= A Phase II dose ranging, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of alicaforsen enema in subjects with acute exacerbation of mild to moderate left-sided ulcerative colitis |journal= Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics |volume=23|pages=1415–25|year=2006|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.02910.x|issue=10 |pmid=16669956[/tpl]
