Metallic or native iron is rarely found on the surface of the Earth because it tends to oxidize, but its oxides are pervasive and represent the primary ores. While it makes up about 5% of the Earth's crust, both the Earth's inner and outer core are believed to consist largely of an iron-nickel alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust.[tpl]cite web|title = Iron: geological information|url = http://www.webelements.com/iron/geology.html|accessdate = 2010-05-23|publisher = WebElements[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.77.12.6973|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/77/12/6973| title = Chemical composition of Earth, Venus, and Mercury|author =John W.

====Stocks in use in society====

According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report, the global per capita stock of iron in use in society is 2200 kg. Much of this is in more-developed countries (7000–14000 kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (2000 kg per capita).

==Chemistry and compounds==

Iron forms compounds mainly in the +2 and +3 oxidation states. Traditionally, iron(II) compounds are called ferrous, and iron(III) compounds ferric. Iron also occurs in higher oxidation states, an example being the purple potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) which contains iron in its +6 oxidation state. Iron(IV) is a common intermediate in many biochemical oxidation reactions.[tpl]Cite journal| doi = 10.1021/ar700027f|title = High-Valent Iron(IV)–Oxo Complexes of Heme and Non-Heme Ligands in Oxygenation Reactions|year = 2007|last1 = Nam|first1 = Wonwoo|journal = Accounts of Chemical Research|volume = 40|pages = 522–531|pmid = 17469792|issue = 7[/tpl][tpl]Cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|year = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 1125–1146|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first1 = Arnold F.|last1 = Holleman|last2 = Wiberg|first2 = Egon|last3 = Wiberg|first3 = Nils;|chapter = Iron| language = German[/tpl] Numerous organometallic compounds contain formal oxidation states of +1, 0, −1, or even −2.

There are also many mixed valence compounds that contain both iron(II) and iron(III) centers, such as magnetite and Prussian blue (Fe4(FeCN6)3). The latter is used as the traditional "blue" in blueprints.[tpl]Cite book| chapter = An introduction in monochrome|pages = 11–19|first = Mike|last = Ware|publisher = NMSI Trading Ltd|title = Cyanotype: the history, science and art of photographic printing in Prussian blue|isbn = 978-1-900747-07-3|year = 1999| url = http://books.google.com/?id=C-7I69gFIbMC&pg=PA11[/tpl]
The iron compounds produced on the largest scale in industry are iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O) and iron(III) chloride (FeCl3). The former is one of the most readily available sources of iron(II), but is less stable to aerial oxidation than Mohr's salt ((NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O). Iron(II) compounds tend to be oxidized to iron(III) compounds in the air.
Unlike many other metals, iron does not form amalgams with mercury. As a result, mercury is traded in standardized 76 pound flasks (34 kg) made of iron.[tpl]Cite book|title = Hand-book of chemistry|volume = 6| first = Leopold|last1 = Gmelin|authorlink = Leopold Gmelin|pages = 128–129| chapter = Mercury and Iron|url = http://books.google.com/?id=nosMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA128|publisher = Cavendish Society|year = 1852[/tpl]

===Binary compounds===

Iron reacts with oxygen in the air to form various oxide and hydroxide compounds; the most common are iron(II,III) oxide (Fe3O4), and iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3). Iron(II) oxide also exists, though it is unstable at room temperature. These oxides are the principal ores for the production of iron (see bloomery and blast furnace). They are also used in the production of ferrites, useful magnetic storage media in computers, and pigments. The best known sulfide is iron pyrite (FeS2), also known as fool's gold owing to its golden luster.
The binary ferrous and ferric halides are well known, with the exception of ferric iodide. The ferrous halides typically arise from treating iron metal with the corresponding binary halogen acid to give the corresponding hydrated salts.
Iron reacts with fluorine, chlorine, and bromine to give the corresponding ferric halides, ferric chloride being the most common:

===Coordination and organometallic compounds===

Several cyanide complexes are known. The most famous example is Prussian blue, (Fe4(FeCN6)3). Potassium ferricyanide and potassium ferrocyanide are also known; the formation of Prussian blue upon reaction with iron(II) and iron(III) respectively forms the basis of a "wet" chemical test. Prussian blue is also used as an antidote for thallium and radioactive caesium poisoning.[tpl]cite web| url =http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/EmergencyPreparedness/BioterrorismandDrugPreparedness/ucm130337.htm| title = Questions and Answers on Prussian Blue| accessdate = 2009-06-06[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal| doi =10.1345/aph.1E024|pages = 1509–1514|pmid =15252192|title =Soluble or Insoluble Prussian Blue for Radiocesium and Thallium Poisoning?|first2 =ED|year =2004|last2 =Callen|last1 =Thompson|issue =9|first1 =D. F|journal =Annals of Pharmacotherapy|volume =38[/tpl] Prussian blue can be used in laundry bluing to correct the yellowish tint left by ferrous salts in water.
Several carbonyl compounds of iron are known. The premier iron(0) compound is iron pentacarbonyl, Fe(CO)5, which is used to produce carbonyl iron powder, a highly reactive form of metallic iron. Thermolysis of iron pentacarbonyl gives the trinuclear cluster, triiron dodecacarbonyl. Collman's reagent, disodium tetracarbonylferrate, is a useful reagent for organic chemistry; it contains iron in the −2 oxidation state. Cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl dimer contains iron in the rare +1 oxidation state.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw1st|pages=1282–86[/tpl].
Ferrocene is an extremely stable complex. The first sandwich compound, it contains an iron(II) center with two cyclopentadienyl ligands bonded through all ten carbon atoms. This arrangement was a shocking novelty when it was first discovered,[tpl]cite journal|title=Ferrocene: Ironclad History of Rashomon Tale?|pages =123–124|pmid=10649350|url=http://www.roaldhoffmann.com/sites/all/files/ferrocene.pdf|year=2000|last1=Laszlo|first1=P|last2=Hoffmann|first2=R|volume=39|issue=1|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-3773(20000103)39:13.0.CO;2-Z|journal=Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)[/tpl] but the discovery of ferrocene has led to a new branch of organometallic chemistry. Ferrocene itself can be used as the backbone of a ligand, e.g. dppf. Ferrocene can itself be oxidized to the ferrocenium cation (Fc+); the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple is often used as a reference in electrochemistry.[tpl]Cite journal|doi = 10.1002/chin.200443242|title = Ferrocene: 50 Years of Transition Metal Organometallic Chemistry—From Organic and Inorganic to Supramolecular Chemistry|year = 2004|last1 = Federman Neto|first1 = Alberto|last2 = Pelegrino|first2 = Alessandra Caramori|last3 = Darin|first3 = Vitor Andre|journal = ChemInform|volume = 35|issue = 43[/tpl]

==History==

===Wrought iron===

Iron objects of great age are much rarer than objects made of gold or silver due to the ease of corrosion of iron.[tpl]sfn|Weeks|1968|p=29[/tpl] Beads made from meteoric iron in 3500 BC or earlier were found in Gerzah, Egypt by G. A. Wainwright.[tpl]sfn|Weeks|1968|p=31[/tpl] The beads contain 7.5% nickel, which is a signature of meteoric origin since iron found in the Earth's crust has very little to no nickel content. Meteoric iron was highly regarded due to its origin in the heavens and was often used to forge weapons and tools or whole specimens placed in churches.[tpl]sfn|Weeks|1968|p=31[/tpl] Items that were likely made of iron by Egyptians date from 2500 to 3000 BC.[tpl]sfn|Weeks|1968|p=29[/tpl] Iron had a distinct advantage over bronze in warfare implements. It was much harder and more durable than bronze, although susceptible to rust. However, this is contested. Hittitologist Trevor Bryce argues that before advanced iron-working techniques were developed in India, meteoritic iron weapons used by early Mesopotamian armies had a tendency to shatter in combat, due to their high carbon content.[tpl]cite book|author=Bryce, Trevor|title=Hittite Warrior|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0_oi1CLayh8C&pg=PA22|year=2007|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84603-081-9|pages=22–23[/tpl]
The first iron production started in the Middle Bronze Age but it took several centuries before iron displaced bronze. Samples of smelted iron from Asmar, Mesopotamia and Tall Chagar Bazaar in northern Syria were made sometime between 2700 and 3000 BC.[tpl]sfn|Weeks|1968|p=32[/tpl] The Hittites appear to be the first to understand the production of iron from its ores and regard it highly in their society. They began to smelt iron between 1500 and 1200 BC and the practice spread to the rest of the Near East after their empire fell in 1180 BC.[tpl]sfn|Weeks|1968|p=32[/tpl] The subsequent period is called the Iron Age. Iron smelting, and thus the Iron Age, reached Europe two hundred years later and arrived in Zimbabwe, Africa by the 8th century.[tpl]sfn|Weeks|1968|p=32[/tpl] In China, iron only appears circa 700–500 BC.Sawyer, Ralph D. and Mei-chün Sawyer.

During the Industrial Revolution in Britain, Henry Cort began refining iron from pig iron to wrought iron (or bar iron) using innovative production systems. In 1783 he patented the puddling process for refining iron ore. It was later improved by others including Joseph Hall.

===Cast iron===

Cast iron was first produced in China during 5th century BC,[tpl]Cite journal|author=Wagner, Donald B. |title=Chinese blast furnaces from the 10th to the 14th century|journal=Historical Metallurgy|volume=37|issue=1|year=2003|pages=25–37[/tpl] originally published in [tpl]Cite journal|first =Donald B.|last =Wagner|title=Chinese blast furnaces from the 10th to the 14th century|journal=West Asian Science, Technology, and Medicine|volume=18 |year=2001|pages=41–74[/tpl] but was hardly in Europe until the medieval period.Giannichedda, Enrico (2007): "Metal production in Late Antiquity", in Technology in Transition AD 300–650 Lavan, L.; Zanini, E. and Sarantis, A.(eds.), Brill, Leiden; ISBN 90-04-16549-5, p. 200.[tpl]Cite book| title = Chemistry, Precision and Design|publisher = A Beka Book, Inc.|first1 = Verne|last1 =Biddle|first2= Gregory|last2 =Parker[/tpl] The earliest cast iron artifacts were discovered by archaeologists in what is now modern Luhe County, Jiangsu in China. Cast iron was used in ancient China for warfare, agriculture, and architecture.[tpl]cite book|author=Donald B. Wagner|title=Iron and Steel in Ancient China|year=1993|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-09632-5|pages=335–340[/tpl] During the medieval period, means were found in Europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron (in this context known as pig iron) using finery forges. For all these processes, charcoal was required as fuel.
Medieval blast furnaces were about [tpl]convert|10|ft|m[/tpl] tall and made of fireproof brick; forced air was usually provided by hand-operated bellows. Modern blast furnaces have grown much bigger.
In 1709, Abraham Darby I established a coke-fired blast furnace to produce cast iron. The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron was one of the factors leading to the Industrial Revolution. Toward the end of the 18th century, cast iron began to replace wrought iron for certain purposes, because it was cheaper. Carbon content in iron wasn't implicated as the reason for the differences in properties of wrought iron, cast iron and steel until the 18th century.[tpl]sfn|Weeks|1968|p=32[/tpl]
Since iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful, it also became a major structural material following the building of the innovative first iron bridge in 1778.

===Steel===

Steel (with smaller carbon content than pig iron but more than wrought iron) was first produced in antiquity by using a bloomery. Blacksmiths in Luristan in western Iran were making good steel by 1000 BC.[tpl]sfn|Weeks|1968|p=32[/tpl] Then improved versions, Wootz steel by India and Damascus steel by China were developed around 300 BC and 500 AD respectively. These methods were specialized, and so steel did not become a major commodity until the 1850s.Spoerl, Joseph S. A Brief History of Iron and Steel Production. Saint Anselm College
New methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century AD. In the Industrial Revolution, new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s, Henry Bessemer invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This made steel much more economical, thereby leading to wrought iron no longer being produced.[tpl]cite book | url = http://books.google.de/books?id=fUmTX8yKU4gC&pg=PA190 | pages = 190–191 | title = Encyclopedia of the Elements: Technical Data - History - Processing - Applications | isbn = 9783527612345 | author1 = Enghag | first1 = Per | date = 2008-01-08[/tpl]

===Foundations of modern chemistry===

Antoine Lavoisier used the reaction of water steam with metallic iron inside an incandescent iron tube to produce hydrogen in his experiments leading to the demonstration of the mass conservation. Anaerobic oxidation of iron at high temperature can be schematically represented by the following reactions:

==Industrial production==

The production of iron or steel is a process containing two main stages, unless the desired product is cast iron. The first stage is to produce pig iron in a blast furnace. Alternatively, it may be directly reduced. The second is to make wrought iron or steel from pig iron by a further process.
For a few limited purposes like electromagnet cores, pure iron is produced by electrolysis of a ferrous sulfate solution

===Blast furnace===

Ninety percent of all mining of metallic ores is for the extraction of iron.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] Industrially, iron production involves iron ores, principally hematite (nominally Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4) in a carbothermic reaction (reduction with carbon) in a blast furnace at temperatures of about 2000 °C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of coke, and a flux such as limestone (which is used to remove silicon dioxide impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a massive blast of heated air, about 4 tons per ton of iron, is forced into the furnace at the bottom.
In the furnace, the coke reacts with oxygen in the air blast to produce carbon monoxide:
The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the chemical equation below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming carbon dioxide in the process:
Some iron in the high-temperature lower region of the furnace reacts directly with the coke:
The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally silicon dioxide sand and other silicates. Common fluxes include limestone (principally calcium carbonate) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to calcium oxide (also known as quicklime):
Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a liquid slag.
The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron, once cooled, is called pig iron, while the slag can be used as a material in road construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for agriculture

===Direct iron reduction===

Since coke is becoming more regulated due to environmental concerns, alternative methods of processing iron have been developed. "Direct iron reduction" reduces iron ore to a powder called "sponge" iron or "direct" iron that is suitable for steelmaking. There are two main reactions that go on in the direct reduction process:
Natural gas is partially oxidized (with heat and a catalyst):
These gases are then treated with iron ore in a furnace, producing solid sponge iron:
Silica is removed by adding a limestone flux, later.

===Further processes===

Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4–5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron, also known as cast iron, is used to cast articles in foundries such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.
Alternatively pig iron may be made into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including finery forges, puddling furnaces, Bessemer converters, open hearth furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and electric arc furnaces. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.
The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content: the higher the percentage of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the malleability. The properties of the steel can also be changed by several methods.
Annealing involves the heating of a piece of steel to 700–800 °C for several hours and then gradual cooling. It makes the steel softer and more workable.
Steel may be hardened by cold working. The metal is bent or hammered into its final shape at a relatively cool temperature. Cold forging is the stamping of a piece of steel into shape by a heavy press. Wrenches are commonly made by cold forging. Cold rolling, which involves making a thinner but harder sheet, and cold drawing, which makes a thinner but stronger wire, are two other methods of cold working. To harden the steel, it is heated to red-hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. If it is too hardened, it is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.
Heat treatment is another way to harden steel. The steel is heated red-hot, then cooled quickly. The iron carbide molecules are decomposed by the heat, but do not have time to reform. Since the free carbon atoms are stuck, it makes the steel much harder and stronger than before.
Sometimes both toughness and hardness are desired. A process called case hardening may be used. Steel is heated to about 900 °C then plunged into oil or water. Carbon from the oil can diffuse into the steel, making the surface very hard. The surface cools quickly, but the inside cools slowly, making an extremely hard surface and a durable, resistant inner layer.
Iron may be passivated by dipping it into a concentrated nitric acid solution. This forms a protective layer of oxide on the metal, protecting it from further corrosion.[tpl]cite book|url=http://www.euro-inox.org/pdf/map/Passivating_Pickling_EN.pdf |title=Picking and passivating stainless steel, Materials and Application Series, Volume 4 |publisher=Euro Inox |year=2007 |edition=2nd |isbn=978-2-87997-224-4[/tpl]

==Applications==

===Metallurgical===

Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2010[/tpl] Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools, automobiles, the hulls of large ships, and structural components for buildings. Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly combined with alloying elements to make steel.
Commercially available iron is classified based on purity and the abundance of additives. Pig iron has 3.5–4.5% carbon[tpl]Cite book|last1 = Camp|first1 = James McIntyre|last2 = Francis |first2 = Charles Blaine|title = The Making, Shaping and Treating of Steel|publisher = Carnegie Steel Company |year=1920|location = Pittsburgh|pages = 173–174|url = http://books.google.com/?id=P9MxAAAAMAAJ|isbn = 1-147-64423-3[/tpl] and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur, silicon and phosphorus. Pig iron is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step in the production of cast iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese. It has a melting point in the range of 1420–1470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.
"White" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of cementite, or iron-carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken iron-carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation.
In gray iron the carbon exists as separate, fine flakes of graphite, and also renders the material brittle due to the sharp edged flakes of graphite that produce stress concentration sites within the material. A newer variant of gray iron, referred to as ductile iron is specially treated with trace amounts of magnesium to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, reducing the stress concentrations and vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.
Wrought iron contains less than 0.25% carbon but large amounts of slag that give it a fibrous characteristic. It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterized by the presence of fine fibers of slag entrapped within the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by mild steel for traditional "wrought iron" products and blacksmithing.
Mild steel corrodes more readily than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. Carbon steel contains 2.0% carbon or less,[tpl]cite web|title = Classification of Carbon and Low-Alloy Steels|url = http://www.keytometals.com/page.aspx?ID=CheckArticle&site=kts&NM=62|accessdate = 2008-01-05[/tpl] with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.
Apart from traditional applications, iron is also used for protection from ionizing radiation. Although it is lighter than another traditional protection material, lead, it is much stronger mechanically. The attenuation of radiation as a function of energy is shown in the graph.
The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from rust if not protected in some way. Painting, galvanization, passivation, plastic coating and bluing are all used to protect iron from rust by excluding water and oxygen or by cathodic protection.

===Iron compounds===

Although its metallurgical role is dominant in terms of amounts, iron compounds are pervasive in industry as well being used in many niche uses. Iron catalysts are traditionally used in the Haber-Bosch Process for the production of ammonia and the Fischer-Tropsch process for conversion of carbon monoxide to hydrocarbons for fuels and lubricants.[tpl]Cite book| title = Surface science: foundations of catalysis and nanoscience|first = Kurt W.|last = Kolasinski|isbn = 978-0-471-49244-3| publisher =John Wiley and Sons|year = 2002|url = http://books.google.com/?id=OA7L1l6oHAYC&pg=PR15|chapter = Where are Heterogenous Reactions Important|pages = 15–16[/tpl] Powdered iron in an acidic solvent was used in the Bechamp reduction the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline.[tpl]Cite book| url = http://books.google.com/?id=BiywGdlot9kC&pg=PA167|chapter = Nitrobenzene and Nitrotoluene |isbn = 978-0-8247-2481-8|publisher = CRC Press|year = 1989|first = John J.|last = McKetta|title = Encyclopedia of Chemical Processing and Design: Volume 31 – Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gasoline to Offshore Process Piping: High Performance Alloys|pages = 166–167[/tpl]

The other halides tend to be limited to laboratory uses.
Iron(II) sulfate is used as a precursor to other iron compounds. It is also used to reduce chromate in cement. It is used to fortify foods and treat iron deficiency anemia. These are its main uses. Iron(III) sulfate is used in settling minute sewage particles in tank water. Iron(II) chloride is used as a reducing flocculating agent, in the formation of iron complexes and magnetic iron oxides, and as a reducing agent in organic synthesis.

==Biological role==

Iron is abundant in biology.[ref]

The color of blood is due to the hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein. As illustrated by hemoglobin, iron is often bound to cofactors, e.g. in hemes. The iron-sulfur clusters are pervasive and include nitrogenase, the enzymes responsible for biological nitrogen fixation. Influential theories of evolution have invoked a role for iron sulfides in the iron-sulfur world theory.
Iron is a necessary trace element found in nearly all living organisms.  Iron-containing enzymes and proteins, often containing heme prosthetic groups, participate in many biological oxidations and in transport. Examples of proteins found in higher organisms include hemoglobin, cytochrome (see high-valent iron), and catalase.[tpl]Cite book| first1 =S. J.|last1 = Lippard|first2 = J.

===Bioinorganic compounds===

The most commonly known and studied "bioinorganic" compounds of iron (i.e., iron compounds used in biology) are the heme proteins: examples are hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochrome P450. These compounds can transport gases, build enzymes, and be used in transferring electrons. Metalloproteins are a group of proteins with metal ion cofactors. Some examples of iron metalloproteins are ferritin and rubredoxin. Many enzymes vital to life contain iron, such as catalase, lipoxygenases, and IRE-BP.

===Health and diet===

Iron is pervasive, but particularly rich sources of dietary iron include red meat, lentils, beans, poultry, fish, leaf vegetables, watercress, tofu, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, blackstrap molasses, fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in molasses, teff and farina. Iron in meat (heme iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables.Food Standards Agency – Eat well, be well – Iron deficiency.

===Uptake and storage===

Iron acquisition poses a problem for aerobic organisms, because ferric iron is poorly soluble near neutral pH. Thus, bacteria have evolved high-affinity sequestering agents called siderophores.[tpl]Cite journal| url = http://www.jbc.org/content/270/45/26723.short|pmid = 7592901|doi = 10.1074/jbc.270.45.26723|year = 1995|last1 = Neilands|first1 = JB|title = Siderophores: structure and function of microbial iron transport compounds|volume = 270|issue = 45|pages = 26723–6|journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal| doi =10.1146/annurev.bi.50.070181.003435|title =Microbial Iron Compounds|year =1981|last1 =Neilands|first1 =J B|journal =Annual Review of Biochemistry|volume =50|pages =715–31|pmid =6455965[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal| doi = 10.1023/A:1020218608266|year = 2002|last1 = Boukhalfa|first1 = Hakim|last2 = Crumbliss|first2 = Alvin L.|journal = BioMetals|volume = 15|pages = 325–39|pmid = 12405526|title = Chemical aspects of siderophore mediated iron transport|issue = 4[/tpl]
After uptake, in cells, iron storage is carefully regulated; "free" iron ions do not exist as such. A major component of this regulation is the protein transferrin, which binds iron ions absorbed from the duodenum and carries it in the blood to cells.[tpl]Cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0000079|title=How Mammals Acquire and Distribute Iron Needed for Oxygen-Based Metabolism|year=2003|last=Rouault|first = Tracey A.|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=1|pages=e9 |pmid=14551907 |issue=1 |pmc=212690[/tpl] In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the heme complex. Heme is an essential component of cytochrome proteins, which mediate redox reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as hemoglobin, myoglobin, and leghemoglobin.
Inorganic iron contributes to redox reactions in the iron-sulfur clusters of many enzymes, such as nitrogenase (involved in the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen) and hydrogenase. Non-heme iron proteins include the enzymes methane monooxygenase (oxidizes methane to methanol), ribonucleotide reductase (reduces ribose to deoxyribose; DNA biosynthesis), hemerythrins (oxygen transport and fixation in marine invertebrates) and purple acid phosphatase (hydrolysis of phosphate esters).
Iron distribution is heavily regulated in mammals, partly because iron ions have a high potential for biological toxicity.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Tumor necrosis factor-α-induced iron sequestration and oxidative stress in human endothelial cells |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=17328512 |last11=Nakanishi|first11=T|last10=Suzuki|first10=K|first9=H |last9=Eguchi |first8=M |last8=Izumi |first7=Y |last7=Hasuike |first6=K |last6=Miyagawa |first5=R |last5=Moriguchi |first4=K |last4=Ito |first3=Y |last3=Otaki|journal=Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology |first2=T |year=2005 |volume=25 |last2=Ookawara|issue=12 |pmid=16224057 |pages=2495–2501 |doi=10.1161/01.ATV.0000190610.63878.20 |last1=Nanami |first1=M.[/tpl]

===Regulation of uptake===

Iron uptake is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake.[tpl]cite book|author1=Ramzi S. Cotran|author2=Vinay Kumar|author3=Tucker Collins|coauthors=Stanley Leonard Robbins|title=Robbins pathologic basis of disease|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kdhrAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=27 June 2012|year=1999|publisher=Saunders|isbn=978-0-7216-7335-6[/tpl]
Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in iron overload disorders, such as hemochromatosis. Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from iron deficiency and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians.[tpl]Cite journal|title=Hereditary hemochromatosis|journal=Rev Med Interne|year=2000 |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=961–71 |doi=10.1016/S0248-8663(00)00252-6 |pmid=11109593|last1=Durupt|first1=S|last2=Durieu|first2=I|last3=Nové-Josserand|first3=R|last4=Bencharif|first4=L|last5=Rousset|first5=H|last6=Vital Durand|first6=D[/tpl]
