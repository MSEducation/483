==Description==

The codex contains the complete text of the four Gospels, on 420 purple parchment leaves (24 by 19 cm). The text is written in one column per page, 17 lines per page, in gold. It is written in early minuscule, but some parts of the codex in semi-uncial, and titles in uncial letters. The codex contains simple miniatures, mainly geometrical figures, without any direct Christian symbols. There are also ornaments on the metal cover.[tpl]r|Gregory[/tpl]
The text is divided according to the [tpl]lang|grc|κεφαλαια[/tpl] (chapters), whose numerals are given at the margin. There is also a division according to the smaller Ammonian Sections, with references to the Eusebian Canons.
It contains tables of the [tpl]lang|grc|κεφαλαια[/tpl] (tables of contents) before each Gospel.
The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type. Kurt Aland did not place it in any Category.[ref]
