CATEGORIES: 1897 elections in Canada, Elections in Quebec

The Quebec general election of 1897 was held on May 11, 1897 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The Quebec Liberal Party, led by Félix-Gabriel Marchand, defeated the incumbent Quebec Conservative Party, led by Edmund James Flynn.
This marked the start of over 39 consecutive years in power for the Liberals. The Conservative Party never held power again in Quebec, and ceased to exist in 1936 when it merged with the Action libérale nationale to form the Union Nationale.
Marchand died in office in 1900, and was succeeded by Simon-Napoléon Parent as Liberal leader and premier.
