CATEGORIES: Districts of Suwon

Jangan-gu, established on July 1, 1988, is the northern district of the city of Suwon in Gyeonggi-do, South Korea. It's approximately 15 km. from central Seoul.

==Geography==

Jangan-gu lies in the north of Suwon. It is bordered by Uiwang to the north-west, Yongin to the north and east, Yeongtong-gu to the south-east, Paldal-gu to the south and Gwonseon-gu to the south west.
Jangan-gu's northern border, with Yongin, is the mountain of Gwanggyosan.  At 582 metres above sea level,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.koreasanha.net/san/gwanggyo.htm|title=한국의 산하 - 광교산 (Hangugui Sanha - Gwanggyosan)|work=Korean mountaineering association website|accessdate=2007-08-07[/tpl] this is Suwon's highest point.
Most of the streams passing through Suwon originate in Jangan-gu, on Gwanggyosan or other nearby peaks. Since Suwon is bounded to the east by other hills, the streams, chiefly the Suwoncheon, flow southwards through the city, eventually emptying into the Yellow Sea at Asan Bay. The entirety of Suwon is drained in this manner.
