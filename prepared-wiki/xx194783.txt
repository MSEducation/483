Nova Southeastern University College of Pharmacy, led by Dean Lisa Deziel, Pharm.D., Ph.D, offers an entry level Doctor of Pharmacy program in three sites, an international program in Davie and a Post-Baccalaureate program for pharmacy graduates.  The College also hosts a number of post-graduate residency programs.
The College of Pharmacy admitted its first class in 1987 to become the only College of Pharmacy in South Florida. Because of the profession's demand for greater clinical specialization, the College has since discontinued its baccalaureate degree program.  The college is fully accredited by the Accreditation Council of Pharmacy Education.[tpl]cite web|title=Detailed PharmD Accreditation History: Nova Southeastern University|url=https://www.acpe-accredit.org/shared_info/accredHistory.asp?degreeid=35&entity=21|publisher=Accreditation Council of Pharmacy Education|accessdate=16 September 2012[/tpl]
