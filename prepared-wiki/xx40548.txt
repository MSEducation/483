A randomized controlled trial (or randomized control trial;[tpl]Cite journal | author = Chalmers TC, Smith H Jr, Blackburn B, Silverman B, Schroeder B, Reitman D, Ambroz A | title = A method for assessing the quality of a randomized control trial | journal = Controlled Clinical Trials | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–49 | year = 1981 | doi = 10.1016/0197-2456(81)90056-8 | pmid = 7261638 [/tpl] RCT) is a specific type of scientific experiment, and the gold standard for a clinical trial. RCTs are often used to test the efficacy or effectiveness of various types of medical intervention within a patient population. RCTs may also provide an opportunity to gather useful information about adverse effects, such as drug reactions. 
The key distinguishing feature of the usual RCT is that study subjects, after assessment of eligibility and recruitment, but before the intervention to be studied begins, are randomly allocated to receive one or other of the alternative treatments under study. Random allocation in real trials is complex, but conceptually, the process is like tossing a coin. After randomization, the two (or more) groups of subjects are followed in exactly the same way, and the only differences between the care they receive, for example, in terms of procedures, tests, outpatient visits, and follow-up calls, should be those intrinsic to the treatments being compared.  The most important advantage of proper randomization is that it minimizes allocation bias, balancing both known and unknown prognostic factors, in the assignment of treatments.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Moher D, Hopewell S, Schulz KF, Montori V, Gøtzsche PC, Devereaux PJ, Elbourne D, Egger M, Altman DG | title = CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials | journal = Br Med J | volume = 340 | pages = c869 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c869 | pmid = 20332511 | pmc = 2844943 [/tpl]
The terms "RCT" and randomized trial are sometimes used synonymously, but the methodologically sound practice is to reserve the "RCT" name only for trials that contain control groups, in which  groups receiving the experimental treatment are compared with control groups receiving no treatment (a placebo-controlled study) or a previously tested treatment (a positive-control study). The term "randomized trials" omits mention of controls and can describe studies that compare multiple treatment groups with each other (in the absence of a control group).[tpl]Cite journal | author = Ranjith G | title = Interferon-α-induced depression: when a randomized trial is not a randomized controlled trial | journal = Psychother Psychosom | volume = 74 | issue = 6 | page = 387 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1159/000087787 | pmid = 16244516 [/tpl] Similarly, although the "RCT" name is sometimes expanded as "randomized clinical trial" or "randomized comparative trial", the methodologically sound practice, to avoid ambiguity in the scientific literature, is to retain "control" in the definition of "RCT" and thus reserve that name only for trials that contain controls. Not all randomized clinical trials are randomized controlled trials (and some of them could never be, in cases where controls would be impractical or unethical to institute). The term randomized controlled clinical trials is a methodologically sound alternate expansion for "RCT" in RCTs that concern clinical research;[tpl]Cite journal | author = Peto R, Pike MC, Armitage P, Breslow NE, Cox DR, Howard SV, Mantel N, McPherson K, Peto J, Smith PG | title = Design and analysis of randomized clinical trials requiring prolonged observation of each patient.

==History==

Randomized experiments first appeared in psychology, where they were introduced by Charles Sanders Peirce,[tpl]cite journal| author=Charles Sanders Peirce and Joseph Jastrow|year=1885|title=On Small Differences in Sensation| journal=Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=3|pages=73–83|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Peirce/small-diffs.htm[/tpl] http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Peirce/small-diffs.htm and in education.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1086/354775|first=Ian|last=Hacking|authorlink=Ian Hacking | title=Telepathy: Origins of Randomization in Experimental Design|journal=Isis|issue=A Special Issue on Artifact and Experiment|volume=79|issue=3|date=September 1988 |pages=427–451|jstor=234674|mr=1013489[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1086/444032|author=Stephen M.

According to [tpl]harvtxt|Conniffe|1991|p=87[/tpl],
 
 Ronald A. Fisher was "interested in application and in the popularization
of statistical methods and his early book Statistical Methods for Research Workers, published in 1925, went through many editions and
motivated and influenced the practical use of statistics in many fields of
study. His Design of Experiments (1935) 
 [promoted] statistical technique and application. In that book he
emphasized examples and how to design experiments systematically from
a statistical point of view. The mathematical justification of the methods
described was not stressed and, indeed, proofs were often barely sketched
or omitted altogether ..., a fact which led H. B. Mann to fill the gaps with a rigorous mathematical treatment in his well known treatise, [tpl]harvtxt|Mann|1949[/tpl]."

 The first published RCT appeared in the 1948 paper entitled "Streptomycin treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis", which described a Medical Research Council investigation.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Streptomycin in Tuberculosis Trials Committee | title = Streptomycin treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.

By the late 20th century, RCTs were recognized as the standard method for "rational therapeutics" in medicine.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Meldrum ML | title = A brief history of the randomized controlled trial. From oranges and lemons to the gold standard | journal = Hematol Oncol Clin North Am | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 745–60, vii | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1016/S0889-8588(05)70309-9  | pmid = 10949771 [/tpl]  As of 2004, more than 150,000 RCTs were in the Cochrane Library.  To improve the reporting of RCTs in the medical literature, an international group of scientists and editors published Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statements in 1996, 2001 and 2010, and these have become widely accepted. Randomization is the process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control groups using an element of chance to determine the assignments in order to reduce the bias.

==Ethics==

Although the principle of clinical equipoise ("genuine uncertainty within the expert medical community... about the preferred treatment") common to clinical trials[tpl]Cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM198707163170304 | author = Freedman B | title = Equipoise and the ethics of clinical research | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 317 | issue = 3 | pages = 141–5 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3600702 [/tpl] has been applied to RCTs, the ethics of RCTs have special considerations.  For one, it has been argued that equipoise itself is insufficient to justify RCTs.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Gifford F | title = Community-equipoise and the ethics of randomized clinical trials | journal = Bioethics | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–48 | year = 1995 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8519.1995.tb00306.x | pmid = 11653056 [/tpl]  For another, "collective equipoise" can conflict with a lack of personal equipoise (e.g., a personal belief that an intervention is effective).[tpl]Cite journal | author = Edwards SJL, Lilford RJ, Hewison J | title = The ethics of randomised controlled trials from the perspectives of patients, the public, and healthcare professionals | journal = Br Med J | volume = 317 | issue = 7167 | pages = 1209–12 | year = 1998 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/317/7167/1209 | pmid = 9794861 | pmc = 1114158 | doi=10.1136/bmj.317.7167.1209[/tpl]  Finally, Zelen's design, which has been used for some RCTs, randomizes subjects before they provide informed consent, which may be ethical for RCTs of screening and selected therapies, but is likely unethical "for most therapeutic trials."[tpl]Cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM197905313002203 | author = Zelen M | title = A new design for randomized clinical trials | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 300 | issue = 22 | pages = 1242–5 | year = 1979 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/300/22/1242 | pmid = 431682 [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal | author = Torgerson DJ, Roland M | title = What is Zelen's design? | journal = Br Med J | volume = 316 | issue = 7131 | page = 606 | year = 1998 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/316/7131/606 | pmid = 9518917 | pmc = 1112637 | doi=10.1136/bmj.316.7131.606[/tpl]

===Trial registration===

In 2004, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) announced that all trials starting enrolment after July 1, 2005 must be registered prior to consideration for publication in one of the 12 member journals of the Committee.[tpl]cite journal |author=De Angelis C, Drazen JM, Frizelle FA, et al |title=Clinical trial registration: a statement from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=351 |issue=12 |pages=1250–1 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15356289 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe048225 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=short&pmid=15356289&promo=ONFLNS19 |issn=[/tpl] However, trial registration may still occur late or not at all.[tpl]cite journal| author=Law MR, Kawasumi Y, Morgan SG| title=Despite law, fewer than one in eight completed studies of drugs and biologics are reported on time on ClinicalTrials.gov. | journal=Health Aff (Millwood) | year= 2011 | volume= 30 | issue= 12 | pages= 2338–45 | pmid=22147862 | doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0172 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=22147862  [/tpl][tpl]cite journal| author=Mathieu S, Boutron I, Moher D, Altman DG, Ravaud P| title=Comparison of registered and published primary outcomes in randomized controlled trials. | journal=JAMA | year= 2009 | volume= 302 | issue= 9 | pages= 977–84 | pmid=19724045 | doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1242 | pmc= | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=19724045  [/tpl]

==Classifications of RCTs==

===By study design===

One way to classify RCTs is by study design.  From most to least common in the healthcare literature, the major categories of RCT study designs are:[tpl]Cite journal | author = Hopewell S, Dutton S, Yu LM, Chan AW, Altman DG | title = The quality of reports of randomised trials in 2000 and 2006: comparative study of articles indexed in PubMed | journal = BMJ | volume = 340 | pages = c723 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/340/mar23_1/c723 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c723  | pmid = 20332510 | pmc = 2844941 [/tpl]
[tpl]cite book  | last = Vonesh | first = Edward F. | coauthors = Chinchilli, Vernon G. | chapter=Crossover Experiments| pages=111–202|title = Linear and Nonlinear Models for the Analysis of Repeated Measurements | publisher = London: Chapman and Hall | year = 1997 [/tpl][/ref]
An analysis of the 616 RCTs indexed in PubMed during December 2006 found that 78% were parallel-group trials, 16% were crossover, 2% were split-body, 2% were cluster, and 2% were factorial.

===By outcome of interest (efficacy vs. effectiveness)===

RCTs can be classified as "explanatory" or "pragmatic."[tpl]Cite journal | author = Zwarenstein M, Treweek S, Gagnier JJ, Altman DG, Tunis S, Haynes B, Oxman AD, Moher D; CONSORT group; Pragmatic Trials in Healthcare (Practihc) group | title = Improving the reporting of pragmatic trials: an extension of the CONSORT statement | journal = BMJ | volume = 337 | pages = a2390 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.a2390 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/nov11_2/a2390 | pmid = 19001484 [/tpl] Explanatory RCTs test efficacy in a research setting with highly selected participants and under highly controlled conditions. In contrast, pragmatic RCTs test effectiveness in everyday practice with relatively unselected participants and under flexible conditions; in this way, pragmatic RCTs can "inform decisions about practice."

===By hypothesis (superiority vs. noninferiority vs. equivalence)===

Another classification of RCTs categorizes them as "superiority trials," "noninferiority trials," and "equivalence trials," which differ in methodology and reporting.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Piaggio G, Elbourne DR, Altman DG, Pocock SJ, Evans SJ; CONSORT Group | title = Reporting of noninferiority and equivalence randomized trials: an extension of the CONSORT statement | journal = JAMA | volume = 295 | issue = 10 | pages = 1152–60 |  year = 2006 | doi = 10.1001/jama.295.10.1152 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/295/10/1152 | pmid = 16522836 [/tpl] Most RCTs are superiority trials, in which one intervention is hypothesized to be superior to another in a statistically significant way. Some RCTs are noninferiority trials "to determine whether a new treatment is no worse than a reference treatment." Other RCTs are equivalence trials in which the hypothesis is that two interventions are indistinguishable from each other.

==Randomization==

The advantages of proper randomization in RCTs include:[tpl]Cite journal | author = Schulz KF, Grimes DA | title = Generation of allocation sequences in randomised trials: chance, not choice | journal = Lancet | volume = 359 | issue = 9305 | pages = 515–9 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07683-3 | url = http://www.who.int/entity/rhl/LANCET_515-519.pdf | pmid = 11853818 [/tpl]
There are two processes involved in randomizing patients to different interventions. First is choosing a randomization procedure to generate an unpredictable sequence of allocations; this may be a simple random assignment of patients to any of the groups at equal probabilities, may be "restricted," or may be "adaptive." A second and more practical issue is allocation concealment, which refers to the stringent precautions taken to ensure that the group assignment of patients are not revealed prior to definitively allocating them to their respective groups. Non-random "systematic" methods of group assignment, such as alternating subjects between one group and the other, can cause "limitless contamination possibilities" and can cause a breach of allocation concealment.

===Randomization procedures===

The treatment allocation is the desired proportion of patients in each treatment arm.  
An ideal randomization procedure would achieve the following goals:[tpl]Cite journal | author = Lachin JM | title = Statistical properties of randomization in clinical trials | journal = Controlled Clinical Trials | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 289–311 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3060315 |  doi = 10.1016/0197-2456(88)90045-1 [/tpl]
However, no single randomization procedure meets those goals in every circumstance, so researchers must select a procedure for a given study based on its advantages and disadvantages.

====Simple randomization====

This is a commonly used and intuitive procedure, similar to "repeated fair coin-tossing." Also known as "complete" or "unrestricted" randomization, it is robust against both selection and accidental biases. However, its main drawback is the possibility of imbalanced group sizes in small RCTs.  It is therefore recommended only for RCTs with over 200 subjects.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Lachin JM, Matts JP, Wei LJ | title = Randomization in clinical trials: conclusions and recommendations | journal = Controlled Clinical Trials | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 365–74 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3203526 |  doi = 10.1016/0197-2456(88)90049-9 [/tpl]

====Restricted randomization====

To balance group sizes in smaller RCTs, some form of "restricted" randomization is recommended.  The major types of restricted randomization used in RCTs are:

====Adaptive====

At least two types of "adaptive" randomization procedures have been used in RCTs, but much less frequently than simple or restricted randomization:

===Allocation concealment===

"Allocation concealment" (defined as "the procedure for protecting the randomization process so that the treatment to be allocated is not known before the patient is entered into the study") is important in RCTs.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Forder PM, Gebski VJ, Keech AC | title = Allocation concealment and blinding: when ignorance is bliss | journal = Med J Aust | volume = 182 | issue = 2 | pages = 87–9 | year = 2005 | url = http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/182_02_170105/for10877_fm.html | pmid = 15651970 [/tpl] In practice, in taking care of individual patients, clinical investigators in RCTs often find it difficult to maintain impartiality. Stories abound of investigators holding up sealed envelopes to lights or ransacking offices to determine group assignments in order to dictate the assignment of their next patient.[tpl]Cite journal | title = Allocation concealment in randomised trials: defending against deciphering | journal = Lancet | volume = 359 | issue = 9306 | pages = 614–8 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)07750-4 | url = http://www.who.int/entity/rhl/LANCET_614-618.pdf | pmid = 11867132 | author = Schulz KF, Grimes DA [/tpl] Such practices introduce selection bias and confounders (both of which should be minimized by randomization), thereby possibly distorting the results of the study. Adequate allocation concealment should defeat patients and investigators from discovering treatment allocation once a study is underway and after the study has concluded.  Treatment related side-effects or adverse events may be specific enough to reveal allocation to investigators or patients thereby introducing bias or influencing any subjective parameters collected by investigators or requested from subjects.
Some standard methods of ensuring allocation concealment include sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (SNOSE); sequentially numbered containers; pharmacy controlled randomization; and central randomization. It is recommended that allocation concealment methods be included in an RCT's protocol, and that the allocation concealment methods should be reported in detail in a publication of an RCT's results; however, 2005 study determined that most RCTs have unclear allocation concealment in their protocols, in their publications, or both.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Pildal J, Chan AW, Hróbjartsson A, Forfang E, Altman DG, Gøtzsche PC | title = Comparison of descriptions of allocation concealment in trial protocols and the published reports: cohort study | journal = BMJ | volume = 330 | issue = 7499 | page = 1049 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38414.422650.8F | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7499/1049 | pmid = 15817527 | pmc = 557221 [/tpl] On the other hand, a 2008 study of 146 meta-analyses concluded that the results of RCTs with inadequate or unclear allocation concealment tended to be biased toward beneficial effects only if the RCTs' outcomes were subjective as opposed to objective.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Wood L, Egger M, Gluud LL, Schulz KF, Jüni P, Altman DG, Gluud C, Martin RM, Wood AJ, Sterne JA | title = Empirical evidence of bias in treatment effect estimates in controlled trials with different interventions and outcomes: meta-epidemiological study | journal = BMJ | volume = 336 | issue = 7644 | pages = 601–5 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.39465.451748.AD | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/336/7644/601 | pmid = 18316340 | pmc = 2267990 [/tpl]

==Blinding==

An RCT may be blinded, (also called "masked") by "procedures that prevent study participants, caregivers, or outcome assessors from knowing which intervention was received." Unlike allocation concealment, blinding is sometimes inappropriate or impossible to perform in an RCT; for example, if an RCT involves a treatment in which active participation of the patient is necessary (e.g., physical therapy), participants cannot be blinded to the intervention.
Traditionally, blinded RCTs have been classified as "single-blind," "double-blind," or "triple-blind"; however, in 2001 and 2006 two studies showed that these terms have different meanings for different people.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Devereaux PJ, Manns BJ, Ghali WA, Quan H, Lacchetti C, Montori VM, Bhandari M, Guyatt GH | title = Physician interpretations and textbook definitions of blinding terminology in randomized controlled trials | journal = J Am Med Assoc | volume = 285 | issue = 15 | pages = 2000–3 | year = 2001 | doi =  10.1001/jama.285.15.2000| url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/285/15/2000 | pmid = 11308438 [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal | author = Haahr MT, Hróbjartsson A | title = Who is blinded in randomized clinical trials?

RCTs without blinding are referred to as "unblinded",[tpl]Cite journal | author = Marson AG, Al-Kharusi AM, Alwaidh M, Appleton R, Baker GA, Chadwick DW, et al | title = The SANAD study of effectiveness of valproate, lamotrigine, or topiramate for generalised and unclassifiable epilepsy: an unblinded randomised controlled trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 369 | issue = 9566 | pages = 1016–26 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60461-9 | pmid = 17382828 | pmc = 2039891 [/tpl] "open",[tpl]Cite journal | author = Chan R, Hemeryck L, O'Regan M, Clancy L, Feely J | title = Oral versus intravenous antibiotics for community acquired lower respiratory tract infection in a general hospital: open, randomised controlled trial | journal = BMJ | volume = 310 | issue = 6991 | pages = 1360–2 | year = 1995 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/310/6991/1360 | pmid = 7787537 | pmc = 2549744 | doi=10.1136/bmj.310.6991.1360[/tpl] or (if the intervention is a medication) "open-label".[tpl]Cite journal | author = Fukase K, Kato M, Kikuchi S, Inoue K, Uemura N, Okamoto S, Terao S, Amagai K, Hayashi S, Asaka M; Japan Gast Study Group | title = Effect of eradication of Helicobacter pylori on incidence of metachronous gastric carcinoma after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer: an open-label, randomised controlled trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 372 | issue = 9636 | pages = 392–7 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61159-9 | pmid = 18675689 [/tpl] In 2008 a study concluded that the results of unblinded RCTs tended to be biased toward beneficial effects only if the RCTs' outcomes were subjective as opposed to objective; for example, in an RCT of treatments for multiple sclerosis, unblinded neurologists (but not the blinded neurologists) felt that the treatments were beneficial.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Noseworthy JH, Ebers GC, Vandervoort MK, Farquhar RE, Yetisir E, Roberts R | title = The impact of blinding on the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled multiple sclerosis clinical trial | journal = Neurology | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–20 | year = 1994 | url = http://www.neurology.org/cgi/content/abstract/44/1/16 | pmid = 8290055 | doi=10.1212/wnl.44.1.16[/tpl] In pragmatic RCTs, although the participants and providers are often unblinded, it is "still desirable and often possible to blind the assessor or obtain an objective source of data for evaluation of outcomes."

==Analysis of data from RCTs==

The types of statistical methods used in RCTs depend on the characteristics of the data and include:
Regardless of the statistical methods used, important considerations in the analysis of RCT data include:

==Reporting of RCT results==

The CONSORT 2010 Statement is "an evidence-based, minimum set of recommendations for reporting RCTs."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.consort-statement.org |title=Welcome to the CONSORT statement Website |author=CONSORT Group |accessdate=2010-03-29[/tpl] The CONSORT 2010 checklist contains 25 items (many with sub-items) focusing on "individually randomised, two group, parallel trials" which are the most common type of RCT. For other RCT study designs, "CONSORT extensions" have been published.

==Advantages==

RCTs are considered by most to be the most reliable form of scientific evidence in the hierarchy of evidence that influences healthcare policy and practice because RCTs reduce spurious causality and bias. Results of RCTs may be combined in systematic reviews which are increasingly being used in the conduct of evidence-based practice. Some examples of scientific organizations' considering RCTs or systematic reviews of RCTs to be the highest-quality evidence available are:
Notable RCTs with unexpected results that contributed to changes in clinical practice include:

==Disadvantages==

Many papers discuss the disadvantages of RCTs.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Black N | title = Why we need observational studies to evaluate the effectiveness of health care | journal = BMJ | volume = 312 | issue = 7040 | pages = 1215–8 | year = 1996 | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/bmj%3B312/7040/1215 | pmid = 8634569 | pmc = 2350940 | doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7040.1215[/tpl][tpl]Cite journal | author = Sanson-Fisher RW, Bonevski B, Green LW, D'Este C | title = Limitations of the randomized controlled trial in evaluating population-based health interventions | journal = Am J Prev Med | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 155–61 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2007.04.007 | url = http://www.ajpm-online.net/article/S0749-3797%2807%2900225-5/abstract | pmid = 17673104 [/tpl]  Among the most frequently cited drawbacks are:

===Limitations of external validity===

The extent to which RCTs' results are applicable outside the RCTs varies; that is, RCTs' external validity may be limited.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Rothwell PM | title = External validity of randomised controlled trials: "to whom do the results of this trial apply?" | journal = Lancet | volume = 365 | issue = 9453 | pages = 82–93 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17670-8 | url = http://apps.who.int/rhl/Lancet_365-9453.pdf | pmid = 15639683 [/tpl] Factors that can affect RCTs' external validity include:

===Costs===

RCTs can be expensive; one study found 28 Phase III RCTs funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke prior to 2000 with a total cost of US$335 million,[tpl]Cite journal | author = Johnston SC, Rootenberg JD, Katrak S, Smith WS, Elkins JS | title = Effect of a US National Institutes of Health programme of clinical trials on public health and costs | journal = Lancet | volume = 367 | issue = 9519 | pages = 1319–27 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68578-4 | url = http://www.chrp.org/pdf/HSR20070511.pdf | pmid = 16631910 [/tpl] for a mean cost of US$12 million per RCT.  Nevertheless, the return on investment of RCTs may be high, in that the same study projected that the 28 RCTs produced a "net benefit to society at 10-years" of 46 times the cost of the trials program, based on evaluating a quality-adjusted life year as equal to the prevailing mean per capita gross domestic product.

===Time===

The conduct of a RCT takes several years until being published, thus data is restricted from the medical community for long years and may be of less relevance at time of publication.[tpl]cite journal |author=Yitschaky O, Yitschaky M, Zadik Y |title=Case report on trial: Do you, Doctor, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? |journal=J Med Case Reports |volume=5 |issue=1 |page=179 |date=May 2011 |pmid=21569508 |url=http://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/pdf/1752-1947-5-179.pdf| format=PDF |doi=10.1186/1752-1947-5-179 |pmc=3113995[/tpl]

===Relative importance of RCTs and observational studies===

Two studies published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2000 found that observational studies and RCTs overall produced similar results.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Benson K, Hartz AJ | title = A comparison of observational studies and randomized, controlled trials | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 342 | issue = 25 | pages = 1878–86 | year = 2000 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/342/25/1878 | pmid = 10861324 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200006223422506 [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal | author = Concato J, Shah N, Horwitz RI | title = Randomized, controlled trials, observational studies, and the hierarchy of research designs | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 342 | issue = 25 | pages = 1887–92 | year = 2000 | url = http://nejm.highwire.org/cgi/content/full/342/25/1887 | pmid = 10861325 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200006223422507 | pmc = 1557642 [/tpl] The authors of the 2000 findings cast doubt on the ideas that "observational studies should not be used for defining evidence-based medical care" and that RCTs' results are "evidence of the highest grade." However, a 2001 study published in Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that "discrepancies beyond chance do occur and differences in estimated magnitude of treatment effect are very common" between observational studies and RCTs.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Ioannidis JP, Haidich AB, Pappa M, Pantazis N, Kokori SI, Tektonidou MG, Contopoulos-Ioannidis DG, Lau J | title = Comparison of evidence of treatment effects in randomized and nonrandomized studies | journal = J Am Med Assoc | volume = 286 | issue = 7 | pages = 821–30 | year = 2001 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/286/7/821 | pmid = 11497536 | doi = 10.1001/jama.286.7.821 [/tpl]
Two other lines of reasoning question RCTs' contribution to scientific knowledge beyond other types of studies:

===Difficulty in studying rare events===

Interventions to prevent events that occur only infrequently (e.g., sudden infant death syndrome) and uncommon adverse outcomes (e.g., a rare side effect of a drug) would require RCTs with extremely large sample sizes and may therefore best be assessed by observational studies.

===Difficulty in studying outcomes in distant future===

It is costly to maintain RCTs for the years or decades that would be ideal for evaluating some interventions.

===Pro-industry findings in industry-funded RCTs===

Some RCTs are fully or partly funded by the health care industry (e.g., the pharmaceutical industry) as opposed to government, nonprofit, or other sources. A systematic review published in 2003 found four 1986-2002 articles comparing industry-sponsored and nonindustry-sponsored RCTs, and in all the articles there was a correlation of industry sponsorship and positive study outcome.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Bekelman JE, Li Y, Gross CP | title = Scope and impact of financial conflicts of interest in biomedical research: a systematic review | journal = J Am Med Assoc | volume = 289 | issue = 4 | pages = 454–65 | year = 2003 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/289/4/454 | pmid = 12533125 | doi = 10.1001/jama.289.4.454 [/tpl] A 2004 study of 1999-2001 RCTs published in leading medical and surgical journals determined that industry-funded RCTs "are more likely to be associated with statistically significant pro-industry findings."[tpl]Cite journal | author = Bhandari M, Busse JW, Jackowski D, Montori VM, Schünemann H, Sprague S, Mears D, Schemitsch EH, Heels-Ansdell D, Devereaux PJ | title = Association between industry funding and statistically significant pro-industry findings in medical and surgical randomized trials | journal = Can Med Assoc J | volume = 170 | issue = 4 | pages = 477–80 | year = 2004 | url = http://ecmaj.com/cgi/content/full/170/4/477 | pmid = 14970094 | pmc = 332713 [/tpl] One possible reason for the pro-industry results in industry-funded published RCTs is publication bias.

===Therapeutic misconception===

Although subjects almost always provide informed consent for their participation in an RCT, studies since 1982 have documented that many RCT subjects believe that they are certain to receive treatment that is best for them personally; that is, they do not understand the difference between research and treatment.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Appelbaum PS, Roth LH, Lidz C | title = The therapeutic misconception: informed consent in psychiatric research | journal = Int J Law Psychiatry | volume = 5 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 319–29 | year = 1982 | doi = 10.1016/0160-2527(82)90026-7 | pmid = 6135666 [/tpl][tpl]Cite journal | author = Henderson GE, Churchill LR, Davis AM, Easter MM, Grady C, Joffe S, Kass N, King NM, Lidz CW, Miller FG, Nelson DK, Peppercorn J, Rothschild BB, Sankar P, Wilfond BS, Zimmer CR | title = Clinical trials and medical care: defining the therapeutic misconception | journal = PLoS Med | volume = 4 | issue = 11 | pages = e324 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0040324 | pmid = 18044980 | pmc = 2082641 [/tpl] Further research is necessary to determine the prevalence of and ways to address this "therapeutic misconception".

===Narrowing of the studied question===

Randomized clinical trials usually only inspect one variable or very few variables, rarely reflecting the full picture of a complicated medical situation; whereas the case report, for example, can detail many different aspects of the patient’s medical situation (e.g. patient history, physical examination, diagnosis, psychosocial aspects, follow up).

===Statistical error===

RCTs are subject to both type I ("false positive") and type II ("false negative") statistical errors.  Regarding Type I errors, a typical RCT will use 0.05 (i.e., 1 in 20) as the probability that the RCT will falsely find two equally effective treatments significantly different.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Wittes J | title = Sample size calculations for randomized controlled trials | journal = Epidemiol Rev | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–53 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1093/epirev/24.1.39 | pmid = 12119854 [/tpl] Regarding Type II errors, despite the publication of a 1978 paper noting that the sample sizes of many "negative" RCTs were too small to make definitive conclusions about the negative results,[tpl]Cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM197809282991304 | author = Freiman JA, Chalmers TC, Smith H Jr, Kuebler RR | title = The importance of beta, the type II error and sample size in the design and interpretation of the randomized control trial. Survey of 71 "negative" trials | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 299 | issue = 13 | pages = 690–4 | year = 1978 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/299/13/690 | pmid = 355881 [/tpl] by 2005-2006 a sizeable proportion of RCTs still had inaccurate or incompletely reported sample size calculations.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Charles P, Giraudeau B, Dechartres A, Baron G, Ravaud P | title = Reporting of sample size calculation in randomised controlled trials: review | journal = Br Med J | volume = 338 | issue = | pages = b1732 | date = 2009-05-12 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.b1732 | pmid = 19435763 | pmc = 2680945 [/tpl]

===Cultural effects===

The RCT method creates cultural effects that have not been well understood.[tpl]Cite journal | author = Jain SL | title = The mortality effect: counting the dead in the cancer trial | journal = Public Culture | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 89–117 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1215/08992363-2009-017 [/tpl] For example, patients with terminal illness may attempt to join trials as a last-ditch attempt at treatment, even when treatments are unlikely to be successful.

===Conflict of interest dangers===

A 2011 study done to disclose possible conflicts of interests in underlying research studies used for medical meta-analyses  reviewed 29 meta-analyses and found that conflicts of interests in the studies underlying the meta-analyses were rarely disclosed.  The 29 meta-analyses included 11 from general medicine journals; 15 from specialty medicine journals, and 3 from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The 29 meta-analyses reviewed an aggregate of 509 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of these, 318 RCTs reported funding sources with 219 (69%) industry funded. 132 of the 509 RCTs reported author conflict of interest disclosures, with 91 studies (69%) disclosing industry financial ties with one or more authors. The information was, however, seldom reflected in the meta-analyses. Only two (7%) reported RCT funding sources and none reported RCT author-industry ties. The authors concluded “without acknowledgment of COI due to industry funding or author industry financial ties from RCTs included in meta-analyses, readers’ understanding and appraisal of the evidence from the meta-analysis may be compromised.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cochrane.org/news/blog/how-well-do-meta-analyses-disclose-conflicts-interests-underlying-research-studies |title=How Well Do Meta-Analyses Disclose Conflicts of Interests in Underlying Research Studies | The Cochrane Collaboration |publisher=Cochrane.org |accessdate=2011-08-19[/tpl]

==Randomized controlled trials in the social sciences==

The use of RCTs in social sciences is a highly contested issue.  Some writers from a medical or health background have argued that existing research in a range of social science disciplines lacks rigour, and should be improved by greater use of randomized control trials[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl].  The issue has been particularly controversial in transport studies, with some writers arguing that public spending on programmes such as school travel plans could not be justified unless their efficacy is demonstrated by randomized controlled trials.[tpl]cite journal |author=Rowland, D., DiGuiseppi, C., Gross, M., Afolabi, E. and Roberts, I. |year=2003 |title=Randomised controlled trial of site specific advice on school travel patterns. |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=8–11 |doi=10.1136/adc.88.1.8[/tpl]  Graham-Rowe and colleagues[tpl]cite journal |author=Graham-Rowe, E., Skippon, S., Gardner, B. and Abraham, C. |year=2011 |title=Can we reduce car use and, if so, how? A review of available evidence. |journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice|volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=401–418[/tpl]  reviewed 77 evaluations of transport interventions found in the literature, categorising them into 5 "quality levels".  They concluded that most of the studies were of low quality and advocated the use of randomized controlled trials wherever possible in future transport research.
MeliaMelia(2011) Randomised Control Trials Offer a Solution to ’low Quality’ Transport Research? Bristol: University of the West of England] took issue with these conclusions, arguing that claims about the advantages of RCTs, in establishing causality and avoiding bias, have been exaggerated.  He proposed the following '8 criteria for the use of RCTs in contexts where interventions must change human behaviour to be effective''':
The intervention:
And the causal mechanisms:

===International development===

RCTs are currently being used by a number of international development experts to measure the impact of development interventions worldwide.  Development economists at research organizations including Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Labhttp://www.povertyactionlab.org/methodology[tpl]cite journal |author= Banerjee AV, Cole S, Duflo E, Linden L |year=2007 |title= Remedying education: evidence from two randomized experiments in India |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume= 122 |issue= 3 |pages= 1235–1264 |doi= 10.1162/qjec.122.3.1235 [/tpl] and Innovations for Poverty Action[tpl]cite journal |author=Karlan D, Zinman J |year=2010 |title=Expanding  credit  access:  using randomized supply decisions to estimate the impacts |journal=Review of Financial Studies |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=433–464 |doi=10.1093/rfs/hhp092 [/tpl] have used RCTs to measure the effectiveness of poverty, health, and education programs in the developing world. While RCTs can be useful in policy evaluation, it is necessary to exercise care in interpreting the results in social science settings. For example, interventions can inadvertently induce socioeconomic and behavioral changes that can confound the relationships (Bhargava, 2008).
For some development economists, the main benefit to using RCTs compared to other research methods is that randomization guards against selection bias, a problem present in many current studies of development policy. In one notable example of a cluster RCT in the field of development economics, Olken (2007) randomized 608 villages in Indonesia in which roads were about to be built into six groups (no audit vs. audit, and no invitations to accountability meetings vs. invitations to accountability meetings vs. invitations to accountability meetings along with anonymous comment forms).[tpl]cite journal |author=Olken BA |year=2007 |title=Monitoring corruption: evidence from a field experiment in Indonesia |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=115 |issue= 2 |pages=200–249 |doi=10.1086/517935 [/tpl] After estimating "missing expenditures" (a measure of corruption), Olken concluded that government audits were more effective than "increasing grassroots participation in monitoring" in reducing corruption.
However, similar conclusions can also be reached by suitable modeling of the data from longitudinal studies. Overall, it is important in social sciences to account for the intended as well as the unintended consequences of interventions for policy evaluations.

===Criminology===

A 2005 review found 83 randomized experiments in criminology published in 1982-2004, compared with only 35 published in 1957-1981.[tpl]cite journal |author= Farrington DP, Welsh BC |year= 2005 |title= Randomized experiments in criminology: What have we learned in the last two decades? |journal=Journal of Experimental Criminology |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages= 9–38 |doi= 10.1007/s11292-004-6460-0 [/tpl] The authors classified the studies they found into five categories: "policing", "prevention", "corrections", "court", and "community".  Focusing only on offending behavior programs, Hollin (2008) argued that RCTs may be difficult to implement (e.g., if an RCT required "passing sentences that would randomly assign offenders to programmes") and therefore that experiments with quasi-experimental design are still necessary.[tpl]cite journal |author=Hollin CR |year= 2008 |title= Evaluating offending behaviour programmes: does only randomization glister? |journal=Criminology and Criminal Justice |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages= 89–106 |doi= 10.1177/1748895807085871 [/tpl]

===Education===

RCTs have been used in evaluating a number of educational interventions.  For example, a 2009 study randomized 260 elementary school teachers' classrooms to receive or not receive a program of behavioral screening, classroom intervention, and parent training, and then measured the behavioral and academic performance of their students.[tpl]cite journal |author=Walker HM, Seeley JR, Small J, Severson HH, Graham BA, Feil EG, Serna L, Golly AM, Forness SR |year= 2009 |title=A randomized controlled trial of the First Step to Success early intervention.
