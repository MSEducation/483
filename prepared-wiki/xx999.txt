</ref> Ruth & Reginald Wright Kauffman also wrote a book, though this one non-fiction, after visiting the Church in Utah. Their book was titled ''[[The Latter Day Saints: A Study of the Mormons in the Light of Economic Conditions]]'', which discussed the Church from a Marxist perspective. [[Plotino Rhodakanaty]] was also drawn to Mormonism and became the first Elder of the Church in Mexico after being baptized when a group of missionaries which included [[Moses Thatcher]] came to Mexico. Moses Thatcher kept in touch with Plotino Rhodakanaty for years following and was himself perhaps the most prominent member of the Church to have openly identified himself as a socialist supporter.
Albert Brisbane and Victor Prosper Considerant also visited the Church in Utah during its early years, prompting Considerant to note that "thanks to a certain dose of socialist solidarity, the Mormons have in a few years attained a state of unbelievable prosperity".[ref]
