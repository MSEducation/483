[[Shalmaneser IV]]

CATEGORIES: 773 BC deaths, Assyrian kings, Year of birth unknown

Shalmaneser IV was king of Assyria (783 - 773 BC). He succeeded his father Adad-nirari III, and was succeeded by his brother Ashur-dan III. Very little information about his reign has survived.
According to the eponym canon, he led several campaigns against Urartu. His rulership was severely limited by the growing influence of high dignitaries, particularly that of Shamshi-ilu, who was then commander-in-chief of the army.
