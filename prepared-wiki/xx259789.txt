Abdellatif Zeroual (born 1951, Berrechid, Morocco, died on 14 November 1974, at "Derb Moulay Ch√©rif"  in Casablanca) was a philosophy teacher and  member of the national committee of the  "Ila Al Amame" movement.

Abdellatif was the son of Haj Abdelkader Zeroual, a militant who fought the French before Morocco became independent.
In 1970, when the Moroccan authorities launched a crackdown on the Ila al-Aman movement, he went into hiding with Abraham Serfaty and was protected by Christine Daure-Serfaty. In 1973 he was sentenced to death in absentia by a Casabalanca court. On 5 November 1974 he disappeared after being snatched by a group of plain-clothed men while on his way to a meeting.

A week later a body was registered at a hospital in Rabat, which human rights organisations claim to be his, although the Moroccan authorities have never confirmed this.
