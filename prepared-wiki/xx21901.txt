[tpl]transl|sem|ʾĒl[/tpl] (written aleph-lamed, e.g. [tpl]lang-uga|𐎛𐎍[/tpl], [tpl]lang-phn|𐤋𐤀[/tpl], [tpl]lang-syc|ܐܠ[/tpl], [tpl]lang-he|אל[/tpl], [tpl]lang-ar|إل[/tpl] or [tpl]lang|ar|إله[/tpl], cognate to [tpl]lang-akk|ilu[/tpl]) is a Northwest Semitic word meaning "deity".
In the Canaanite religion, or Levantine religion as a whole, El or Il was a god also known as the Father of humanity and all creatures, and the husband of the goddess Asherah as recorded in the clay tablets of Ugarit (modern [tpl]transl|apc|Ra′s Shamrā[/tpl]—[tpl]lang-ar|رأس شمرا[/tpl], Syria).[tpl]sfn|Matthews|2004|p=79[/tpl]
The bull was symbolic to El and his son Baʻal Hadad, and they both wore bull horns on their headdress.[tpl]sfn|van der Toorn|1999|p=181[/tpl] He may have been a desert god at some point, as the myths say that he had two wives and built a sanctuary with them and his new children in the desert. El had fathered many gods, but most important were Hadad, Yam, and Mot.

==Linguistic forms and meanings==

Cognate forms are found throughout the Semitic languages. They include Ugaritic [tpl]lang|uga-Latn|ʾil[/tpl], pl. [tpl]lang|uga-Latn|ʾlm[/tpl];
Phoenician [tpl]lang|phn-Latn|ʾl[/tpl] pl. [tpl]lang|phn-Latn|ʾlm[/tpl];
Hebrew [tpl]lang|he-Latn|ʾēl[/tpl], pl. [tpl]lang|he-Latn|ʾēlîm[/tpl];
Aramaic [tpl]lang|arc-Latn|ʾl[/tpl];
Akkadian [tpl]lang|akk-Latn|ilu[/tpl], pl. [tpl]lang|akk-Latn|ilānu[/tpl].
In northwest Semitic use, El was both a generic word for any god and the special name or title of a particular god who was distinguished from other gods as being "the god".[tpl]sfn|Smith|2001|p=135[/tpl]
El is listed at the head of many pantheons. El is the Father God among the Canaanites.
However, because the word sometimes refers to a god other than the great god Ēl, it is frequently ambiguous as to whether Ēl followed by another name means the great god Ēl with a particular epithet applied or refers to another god entirely. For example, in the Ugaritic texts, ʾil mlk is understood to mean "Ēl the King" but ʾil hd as "the god Hadad".
The Semitic root ʾlh (Arabic [tpl]Transl|ar|DIN|ʾilāh[/tpl], Aramaic ʾAlāh, ʾElāh, Hebrew ʾelōah) may be ʾl with a parasitic h, and ʾl may be an abbreviated form of ʾlh.  In Ugaritic the plural form meaning "Gods" is [tpl]lang|uga-Latn|ʾilhm[/tpl], equivalent to Hebrew [tpl]lang|he-Latn|ʾelōhîm[/tpl] "Gods". But in Hebrew this word is also regularly used for semantically singular "god" or "God".
The stem ʾl is found prominently in the earliest strata of east Semitic, northwest Semitic, and south Semitic groups. Personal names including the stem ʾl are found with similar patterns in both Amorite and South Arabic which indicates that probably already in Proto-Semitic ʾl was both a generic term for "god" and the common name or title of a single particular god.
