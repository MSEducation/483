Paul David Hewson (born 10 May 1960), known by his stage name Bono ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɒ|n|oʊ[/tpl]), is an Irish singer-songwriter, musician, venture capitalist, businessman, and philanthropist.Bono-fire. He is best recognized as the frontman of the Dublin-based rock band U2. Bono was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland, and attended Mount Temple Comprehensive School where he met his future wife, Alison Stewart, and the future members of U2. Bono writes almost all U2 lyrics, frequently using religious, social, and political themes. During U2's early years, Bono's lyrics contributed to their rebellious and spiritual tone. As the band matured, his lyrics became inspired more by personal experiences shared with the other members.
Outside the band, he has collaborated and recorded with numerous artists, is managing director and a managing partner of Elevation Partners,Billboard.biz. and has refurbished and owns The Clarence Hotel in Dublin with The Edge. Bono is also widely known for his activism concerning Africa, for which he co-founded DATA, EDUN, the ONE Campaign and Product Red. He has organised and played in several benefit concerts and has met with influential politicians. Bono has been praised and criticised for his activism and involvement with U2.Mellgren, D.

He went to the local primary Glasnevin National School.Matthews (2008), p. 8. Bono was 14 when his mother died on 10 September 1974 after suffering a cerebral aneurysm at her father's funeral. Many U2 songs, including "I Will Follow", "Mofo", "Out of Control", "Lemon" and "Tomorrow" focus on the loss of his mother.[tpl]cite news|title=Growing Up With U2|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|first=Neil|last=McCormick|date=1 January 1997[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=U2: Small Victories in a Rock and Roll Struggle of Sound and Emotion Report|first=Fred|last=Schruers|date=May 1983|magazine=Musician Magazine[/tpl] Other songs focus on the theme of childhood vs. maturity, such as "Into the Heart", "Twilight" and "Stories for Boys".[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
Bono attended Mount Temple Comprehensive School, a multi denominational school in Clontarf. During his childhood and adolescence, Bono and his friends were part of a surrealist street gang called "Lypton Village". Bono met one of his closest friends, Guggi, in Lypton Village.[tpl]Cite book|title=U2 by U2|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-077674-9|author=Edge, Adam Clayton, Larry Mullen Jr.[/tpl] The gang had a ritual of nickname-giving. Bono had several names: first, he was "Steinhegvanhuysenolegbangbangbang", then just "Huyseman", followed by "Houseman", "Bon Murray", "Bono Vox of O'Connell Street", and finally just "Bono".[tpl]cite book|last=Assayas|first=Michka|title=Bono on Bono: Conversations with Michka Assayas|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|isbn=0-340-83276-2|location=London|year=2005[/tpl]
"Bono Vox" is an alteration of Bonavox, a Latin phrase which translates to "good voice". It is said he was nicknamed "Bono Vox" by his friend Gavin Friday. He initially disliked the name; however, when he learned it translated to "good voice", he accepted it. Hewson has been known as "Bono" since the late 1970s. Although he uses Bono as his stage name, close family and friends also refer to him as Bono, including fellow band members.
After he left school, his father Bob Hewson, gave him a time limit telling him he could live at home for one year but if he wasn't able to pay his own way, he would have to get a job or leave the house.

Bono is almost never seen in public without sunglasses. During a Rolling Stone interview he stated:
