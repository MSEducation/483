CATEGORIES: Yorkshire, Counties of England established in antiquity

Yorkshire [tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɔ:|k|ʃ|ə[/tpl] is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom.G. Gibbons, Yorkshire: Britain's Largest County (London: Geographica Ltd., 1969). Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been increasingly undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.yorkshireridings.org/news/the-yorkshire-ridings.html|title=Yorkshire Ridings Society|accessdate=3 June 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5234444.stm| publisher=BBC|title=What's so special about Yorkshire?| date=1 August 2006| first=Liam| last=Allen| accessdate=15 July 2008[/tpl] The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military,[tpl]cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_yorkshire/5050496.stm| publisher=BBC|title=New Yorkshire Regiment is formed|accessdate=8 October 2008 | date=6 June 2006[/tpl] and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as  North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire.
Within the borders of the historic county of Yorkshire are areas which are widely considered to be among the greenest in England, due to the vast stretches of unspoiled countryside in the Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors and to the open aspect of some of the major cities.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/oct/20/communities?gusrc=rss&feed=networkfront |publisher=Guardian Unlimited|title=And the winner of the award for the greenest city in Britain is ...

==Toponymy==

The county of Yorkshire was so named as it is the Shire (administrative area or county) of the City of York [tpl]IPAc-en|local|audio=en-uk-York.ogg|ˈ|j|ɔː|k[/tpl] or York's Shire. "York" comes from the Viking name for the city, Jórvík. "Shire" is from Old English, scir meaning care or official charge.[tpl]cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=Shire|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=shire|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=27 April 2014[/tpl] The "shire" suffix is locally  pronounced [tpl]IPA|/-ʃə/[/tpl] "shuh", or occasionally [tpl]IPA|/-ʃiə/[/tpl], a homophone of "sheer" suggesting an alternative connection to boundary.[tpl]cite book|last=Mills|first=A.D.|title=Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-852758-9[/tpl]

==History==

===Celtic tribes===

Early inhabitants of Yorkshire were Celts, who formed two separate tribes, the Brigantes and the Parisi. The Brigantes controlled territory which later became all of the North Riding of Yorkshire and the West Riding of Yorkshire. The tribe controlled most of Northern England and more territory than any other Celtic tribe in England.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.roman-britain.org/tribes/tribes.htm|publisher=Roman-Britain.org|title=The Celtic Tribes of Britain|accessdate=25 October 2007[/tpl]  That they had the Yorkshire area as their heartland is evident in that Isurium Brigantum (now known as Aldborough) was the capital town of their civitas under Roman rule. Six of the nine Brigantian poleis described by Claudius Ptolemaeus in the Geographia fall within the historic county.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.roman-britain.org/tribes/brigantes.htm|publisher=Roman-Britain.org|title=The Brigantes|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl]Ptolemy, Geographia 2.1, 2.2 The Parisi, who controlled the area that would become the East Riding of Yorkshire, might have been related to the Parisii of Lutetia Parisiorum, Gaul (known today as Paris, France).[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.roman-britain.org/tribes/parisi.htm|publisher=Roman-Britain.org |title=The Parisii|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl] Their capital was at Petuaria, close to the Humber estuary. Although the Roman conquest of Britain began in 43 AD, the Brigantes remained in control of their kingdom as a client state of Rome for an extended period, reigned over by the Brigantian monarchs Cartimandua and her husband Venutius. Initially, this situation suited both the Romans and the Brigantes, who were known as the most militant tribe in Britain.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.romans-in-britain.org.uk/his_brigantian_uprising.htm|publisher=Romans-In-Britain.org.uk|title=Romans In Britain|accessdate=25 October 2007[/tpl]

===Roman Yorkshire===

Queen Cartimandua left her husband Venutius for his armour bearer, Vellocatus, setting off a chain of events which changed control of the Yorkshire area. Cartimandua, due to her good relationship with the Romans, was able to keep control of the kingdom; however her former husband staged rebellions against her and her Roman allies.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.arch.wyjs.org.uk/AdvSrv/indexRoman.asp?pg=Romanweb/Cartimandua.htm| publisher=West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service| title=Cartimandua| year=2007| accessdate=3 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071009031721/http://www.arch.wyjs.org.uk/AdvSrv/indexRoman.asp?pg=Romanweb/Cartimandua.htm |archivedate = 9 October 2007[/tpl] At the second attempt, Venutius seized the kingdom, but the Romans, under general Petillius Cerialis, conquered the Brigantes in 71 AD.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.shadowdrake.com/brigit5.html| publisher=House Shadow Drake| title=The Brigantes| accessdate=25 October 2007[/tpl]
Under Roman rule, the high profile of the area continued. The fortified city of Eboracum (now known as York) was named as capital of Britannia Inferior and joint-capital of all Roman Britain.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/Classics/roman_provinces/britain/image21.htm| publisher=VanderBilt.edu| title=Lower (Britannia Inferior) and Upper Britain (Britannia Superior)| accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl] During the two years before the death of Emperor Septimius Severus, the Roman Empire was run from Eboracum by him.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.yorkromanfestival.com/history.htm| publisher=York Roman Festival| title=Roman York - a brief introduction to York's Roman History| accessdate=25 October 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071008234045/http://www.yorkromanfestival.com/history.htm  |archivedate = 8 October 2007[/tpl]
Another Emperor, Constantius Chlorus, died in Yorkshire during a visit in 306 AD. This saw his son Constantine the Great proclaimed Emperor in the city, who would become renowned due to his contributions to Christianity.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.britainexpress.com/cities/york/roman.htm| publisher=Britain Express| title=Roman York| accessdate=25 October 2007[/tpl] In the early 5th century, the Roman rule ceased with the withdrawal of the last active Roman troops. By this stage, the Empire was in heavy decline.

===Second Celtic period and Angles===

After the Romans left, small Celtic kingdoms arose in Yorkshire; the Kingdom of Ebrauc around York and more notably the Kingdom of Elmet in West Yorkshire.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsBritain/BritainEbrauc.htm|publisher=HistoryFiles.co.uk|title=Ebrauc|accessdate=25 October 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/FeaturesBritain/BritishElmet.htm|publisher=HistoryFiles.co.uk|title=Elmet|accessdate=25 October 2007 [/tpl] Elmet remained independent from the Northumbrian Angles until some time in the early 7th century, when King Edwin of Northumbria expelled its last king, Certic, and annexed the region. At its greatest extent, Northumbria stretched from the Irish Sea to the North Sea and from Edinburgh down to Hallamshire in South Yorkshire.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/anglosaxons/invasion/invind3.shtml|publisher=BBC|title=The Anglo-Saxons|accessdate=25 October 2007[/tpl]

===Kingdom of Jórvík===

An army of Danish Vikings, the Great Heathen Army[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jorvik-viking-centre.co.uk/vikings4.htm|publisher=Jorvik-Viking-Centre.co.uk|title=What Happened to Them?|accessdate=25 October 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012204846/http://www.jorvik-viking-centre.co.uk/vikings4.htm |archivedate = 12 October 2007[/tpl] as its enemies often referred to it, invaded Northumbrian territory in 866 AD.  The Danes conquered and assumed what is now York and renamed it Jórvík, making it the capital city of a new Danish kingdom under the same name. The area which this kingdom covered included most of Southern Northumbria, roughly equivalent to the borders of Yorkshire extending further West.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.viking.no/e/england/york/kingdom_of_york_m.html|publisher=Viking.no|title=The Viking Kingdom of York|date=15 April 2000|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl]
The Danes went on to conquer an even larger area of England which afterwards became known as the Danelaw; but whereas most of the Danelaw was still English land, albeit in submission to Viking overlords, it was in the Kingdom of Jórvík that the only truly Viking territory on mainland Britain was ever established. The Kingdom prospered, taking advantage of the vast trading network of the Viking nations, and established commercial ties with the British Isles, North-West Europe, the Mediterranean and the Middle East.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britannia.com/history/york/yorkhist4.html|publisher=Britannia.com|title=Narrative History of York: Viking Times|accessdate=25 October 2007[/tpl]
Founded by the Dane Halfdan Ragnarsson in 875,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.northeastengland.talktalk.net/VikingNorthumbria.htm|publisher=NorthEastEngland.net|title= Part Two - Jorvik and the Viking Age (866 AD – 1066 AD)|accessdate=25 October 2007[/tpl] ruled for the great part by Danish kings, and populated by the families and subsequent descendants of Danish Vikings, the leadership of the kingdom nonetheless passed into Norwegian hands during its twilight years. Eric Bloodaxe, an ex-king of Norway who was the last independent Viking king of Jórvík, is a particularly noted figure in history,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/FeaturesBritain/BritishElmet.htm|publisher=HistoryFiles.co.uk|title=Eric Bloodaxe|accessdate=25 October 2007[/tpl] and his bloodthirsty approach towards leadership may have been at least partly responsible for convincing the Danish inhabitants of the region to accept English sovereignty so readily in the years that followed.
After around 100 years of its volatile existence, the Kingdom of Jorvik finally came to an end. The Kingdom of Wessex was now in its ascendant and established its dominance over the North in general, placing Yorkshire again within Northumbria, which retained a certain amount of autonomy as an almost-independent earldom rather than a separate kingdom. The Wessex Kings of England were reputed to have respected the Norse customs in Yorkshire and left law-making in the hands of the local aristocracy.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britannia.com/history/york/yorkhist5.html|publisher=Britannia.com|title=Narrative History of York: Late Saxon Times|accessdate=25 October 2007[/tpl]

===Norman conquest===

In the weeks immediately leading up to the Battle of Hastings in 1066 AD, Harold II of England was distracted by events in Yorkshire.  His brother Tostig and Harold Hardrada, King of Norway, attempted a takeover in the north, having won the Battle of Fulford. The King of England marched North where the two armies met at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Tostig and Hardrada were both killed and their army was defeated decisively. However, Harold Godwinson was forced immediately to march his army back down to the South where William the Conqueror was landing. The King was defeated at Hastings, which led to the Norman conquest of England.
The people of the North rebelled against the Normans in September 1069 AD, enlisting Sweyn II of Denmark. They tried to take back York, but the Normans burnt it before they could.[tpl]cite web |url=http://allabout1066.net/north_east_1069.htm| publisher=The Norman Conquest School Site| title=Resistance in the North East - 1069| accessdate=3 October 2008[/tpl] What followed was the Harrying of the North ordered by William. From York to Durham, crops, domestic animals, and farming tools were scorched. Many villages between the towns were burnt and local Northerners were indiscriminately murdered.[tpl]cite web |url=http://allabout1066.net/harrying.htm| publisher=The Norman Conquest School Site| title=Harrying of the North| accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl] During the winter that followed, families starved to death and thousands of peasants died of cold and hunger. Orderic Vitalis put the estimation at "more than 100,000" people from the North died from hunger.[tpl]cite web |url=http://allabout1066.net/orderics_reaction.htm|publisher=The Norman Conquest School Site|title=Orderic's reaction|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl]
In the centuries following, many abbeys and priories were built in Yorkshire. Norman landowners were keen to increase their revenues and established new towns such as Barnsley, Doncaster, Hull, Leeds,  Scarborough, Sheffield, and others. Of towns founded before the conquest, only Bridlington, Pocklington, and York continued at a prominent level.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/yorkshire.html| publisher=LocalHistories.org| title=Yorkshire| accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl] The population of Yorkshire boomed until hit by the Great Famine in the years between 1315 and 1322.
In the early 12th century, people of Yorkshire had to contend with the Battle of the Standard at Northallerton with the Scots. Representing the Kingdom of England led by Archbishop Thurstan of York, soldiers from Yorkshire defeated the more numerous Scots.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britainexpress.com/History/battles/standard.htm| publisher=Britain Express| title=The Battle of the Standard| accessdate=25 October 2007[/tpl]
The Black Death reached Yorkshire by 1349, killing around a third of the population.

===Wars of the Roses===

When King Richard II was overthrown in 1399, antagonism between the House of York and the House of Lancaster, both branches of the royal House of Plantagenet, began to emerge. Eventually the two houses fought for the throne of England in a series of civil wars, commonly known as the Wars of the Roses. Some of the battles took place in Yorkshire, such as those at Wakefield and Towton, the latter of which is known as the bloodiest battle ever fought on English soil.[tpl]cite book| last = Gravett | first = Christopher | title =Towton 1461: England's Bloodiest Battle| publisher = Osprey Publishing | url =http://books.google.com/?id=-UlMBQYccEMC&dq=towton+bloodiest&printsec=frontcover | isbn = 978-0-415-09378-1| year = 1999[/tpl]
Richard III was the last Yorkist king.
Henry Tudor, sympathiser to the House of Lancaster, defeated and killed Richard at the Battle of Bosworth Field. He then became King Henry VII and married Elizabeth of York daughter of Yorkist Edward IV, ending the wars.[tpl]cite web |url=http://metamedia.stanford.edu/projects/MichaelShanks/1877|publisher=Stanford.edu|title=Yorkists|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl] The two roses of white and red, emblems of the Houses of York and Lancaster respectively, were combined to form the Tudor Rose of England.[tpl]ref label|wars|a|a[/tpl][tpl]cite book| last =Hey | first = David  | title =History of Yorkshire: County of the Broad Acres|publisher=Carnegie Publishing| url =http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1859361226 | isbn = 1-85936-122-6| year =2005[/tpl] This rivalry between the royal houses of York and Lancaster has passed into popular culture as a rivalry between the counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire, particularly in sport (for example the Roses Match played in County Cricket), although the House of Lancaster was based in York and the House of York in London. In football, matches between Manchester United and Leeds United are usually described as "War of the Roses" games; the teams' home kits being the colour of the respective rose.

===Saints, Civil War and textile industry===

The wool textile industry which had previously been a cottage industry centred on the old market towns moved to the West Riding where budding entrepreneurs were building mills that took advantage of water power gained by harnessing the rivers and streams flowing from the Pennines. The developing textile industry in general helped Wakefield and Halifax grow.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/making_history/makhist10_prog13a.shtml|publisher=BBC|title=William Hirst - Leeds woollen industry pioneer|accessdate=25 November 2007[/tpl]
The English Reformation began under Henry VIII and the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536 led to a popular uprising known as Pilgrimage of Grace, started in Yorkshire as a protest. Some Catholics contingent in Yorkshire continued to practice their religion and those caught were executed during the reign of Elizabeth I. One such person was a York woman named Margaret Clitherow who was later canonised.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04059b.htm|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=St. Margaret Clitherow|accessdate=25 November 2007[/tpl]
During the English Civil War, which started in 1642 between king and parliament, Yorkshire had divided loyalties; Hull famously shut the gates of the city on the king when he came to enter the city a few months before fighting began, while the North Riding of Yorkshire in particular was strongly royalist.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/humber/content/articles/2005/07/20/coast05walks_stage8.shtml|publisher=BBC|title=Seeds of the English Civil War|accessdate=25 November 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Historic Cleveland - Timeline| url =http://www.historic-cleveland.co.uk/timeline/timelineIndex.php| publisher =Historic-Cleveland.co.uk |accessdate=25 November 2007[/tpl] York was the base for Royalists, and from there they captured Leeds and Wakefield only to have them recaptured a few months later. The royalists won the Battle of Adwalton Moor meaning they controlled Yorkshire (with the exception of Hull). From their base in Hull the Parliamentarians ("Roundheads") fought back, re-taking Yorkshire town by town, until they won the Battle of Marston Moor and with it control of all of the North of England.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/military/1644-york-march-marston-moor.htm|publisher=British-Civil-Wars.co.uk|title= The York March and Marston Moor|accessdate=25 November 2007[/tpl]
In the 16th and 17th centuries Leeds and other wool industry centred towns continued to grow, along with Huddersfield, Hull and Sheffield, while coal mining first came into prominence in the West Riding of Yorkshire.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.num.org.uk/?p=history&c=num|publisher=NUM.org.uk|title=History of the NUM: 1 - Towards A National Union|accessdate=25 November 2007[/tpl] Canals and turnpike roads were introduced in the late 18th century. In the following century the spa towns of Harrogate and Scarborough also flourished, due to people believing mineral water had curative properties.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.great-britain.co.uk/regions/yorkshire/harrogat.htm|publisher=Great-British.co.uk|title=Harrogate, Yorkshire Spa town|accessdate=25 November 2007[/tpl]

===Yorkshire today===

The 19th century saw Yorkshire's continued growth, with the population growing and the Industrial Revolution continuing with prominent industries in coal, textile and steel (especially in Sheffield and Rotherham). However, despite the booming industry, living conditions declined in the industrial towns due to overcrowding, this saw bouts of cholera in both 1832 and 1848.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thoresby.org.uk/history.htm|publisher=Thoresby.org.uk|title=The Historical Society for Leeds and District|accessdate=25 November 2007[/tpl] Fortunately for the county, advances were made by the end of the century with the introduction of modern sewers and water supplies. Several Yorkshire railway networks were introduced as railways spread across the country to reach remote areas.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nrm.org.uk/|publisher=NRM.org.uk|title=National Railway Museum, York|accessdate=25 November 2007[/tpl] County councils were created for the three ridings in 1889, but their area of control did not include the large towns, which became county boroughs, and included an increasing large part of the population.Hampton, W., Local Government and Urban Politics, (1991)

Some of the changes were unpopular, and controversially Yorkshire and its ridings lost status in 1974[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.politics.co.uk/issue-briefs/domestic-policy/local-government/local-government-structure/local-government-structure-$366613.htm|publisher=Politics.co.uk |title= Local Government Structure|accessdate=25 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070211094339/http://www.politics.co.uk/issue-briefs/domestic-policy/local-government/local-government-structure/local-government-structure-$366613.htm |archivedate = 11 February 2007[/tpl] as part of the Local Government Act 1972.Arnold-Baker, C., Local Government Act 1972, (1973) The East Riding was resurrected with reduced boundaries in 1996 with the abolition of Humberside. With slightly different borders, the government office entity which currently contains most of the area of Yorkshire is the Yorkshire and the Humber region of England. This region includes a northern slice of Lincolnshire, but omits Saddleworth (now in Greater Manchester); the Forest of Bowland (Lancashire); Sedbergh and Dent (Cumbria); Upper Teesdale (County Durham) as well as Middlesbrough, and Redcar and Cleveland.HMSO, Aspects of Britain: Local Government, (1996)

==Geography==

===Physical and geological===

Historically, the northern boundary of Yorkshire was the River Tees, the eastern boundary was the North Sea coast and the southern boundary was the Humber Estuary and River Don and River Sheaf. The western boundary meandered along the western slopes of the Pennine Hills to again meet the River Tees.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/|publisher=Genuki.org|title=Yorkshire Geology|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl] It is bordered by several other historic counties in the form of County Durham, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Cheshire, Lancashire and Westmorland.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jlcarr.info/maps/index.html|publisher=JLCarr.info|title=The historic counties of England|accessdate=24 October 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050208092227/http://www.jlcarr.info/maps/index.html |archivedate = 8 February 2005[/tpl] In Yorkshire there is a very close relationship between the major topographical areas and the geological period in which they were formed. The Pennine chain of hills in the west is of Carboniferous origin. The central vale is Permo-Triassic. The North York Moors in the north-east of the county are Jurassic in age while the Yorkshire Wolds to the south east are Cretaceous chalk uplands.
Yorkshire is drained by several rivers. In western and central Yorkshire the many rivers empty their waters into the River Ouse which reaches the North Sea via the Humber Estuary.[tpl]cite book | year  = 1992 | title = Yorkshire Rivers: A Canoeists Guide  | publisher= Menasha Ridge Press | isbn = 978-1-871890-16-7 | author  = British Canoe Union, Yorkshire and Humberside Region, Access and Recreation Committees ; prepared by Mike Twiggs and David Taylor.[/tpl]  The most northerly of the rivers in the Ouse system is the River Swale, which drains Swaledale before passing through Richmond and meandering across the Vale of Mowbray. Next, draining Wensleydale, is the River Ure, which joins the Swale east of Boroughbridge. The River Nidd rises on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales National Park and flows along Nidderdale before reaching the Vale of York.
The Ouse is the name given to the river after its confluence with the Ure at Ouse Gill Beck. The River Wharfe, which drains Wharfedale, joins the Ouse upstream of Cawood.  The Rivers Aire and Calder are more southerly contributors to the River Ouse and the most southerly Yorkshire tributary is the River Don, which flows northwards to join the main river at Goole. In the far north of the county the River Tees flows eastwards through Teesdale and empties its waters into the North Sea downstream of Middlesbrough. The smaller River Esk flows from west to east at the northern foot of the North York Moors to reach the sea at Whitby.  The River Derwent rises on the North York Moors, flows south then westwards through the Vale of Pickering then turns south again to drain the eastern part of the Vale of York. It empties into the River Ouse at Barmby on the Marsh.  To the east of the Yorkshire Wolds the River Hull flows southwards to join the Humber Estuary at Kingston upon Hull. The western Pennines are served by the River Ribble which drains westwards into the Irish Sea close to Lytham St Annes.

The countryside of Yorkshire has acquired the common nickname of "God's Own County".

Historically, Yorkshire was divided into three ridings and the Ainsty of York. The term 'riding' is of Viking origin and derives from Threthingr meaning a third part. The three ridings in Yorkshire were named the East Riding, West Riding and North Riding.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/index.html |title=GENUKI: Yorkshire Genealogy |first=Colin |last=Hinson |work=genuki.org.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl] The East and North Ridings of Yorkshire were separated by the River Derwent and the West and North Ridings were separated by the Ouse and the Ure/Nidd watershed. In 1974 the three ridings of Yorkshire were abolished and York which had been independent of the three ridings, was incorporated into the new county called North Yorkshire. It later became part of York Unitary Authority.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.lgbce.org.uk/records-and-resources/database-of-local-government-orders/yorkshire-and-the-humber |title=LGBCE - Yorkshire and the Humber |first= |last= |work=lgbce.org.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=29 June 2011[/tpl]

===Cities and towns===

==Economy==

Yorkshire largely has a mixed economy. The City of Leeds is Yorkshire's largest city (see the list of English districts by population) and is the main centre of trade and commerce.  Leeds is one of the UK's largest financial centres.  Leeds' traditional industries have been mixed between the service-based industries as well as textile manufacturing and coal mining to the south and east of the city.
Sheffield traditionally has had heavy industrial manufacturing such as coal mining and the steel industry. Since the decline of such industries Sheffield has attracted tertiary and administrative businesses including a growing retail trade, particularly with the development of Meadowhall.  However, while Sheffield's heavy industry has declined, the region has reinvented itself as a world renowned centre for specialist engineering. A cluster of hi-tech facilities including The Welding Institute and the Boeing partnered Advanced Materials Research Centre[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.amrc.co.uk/faq/index.php#1|publisher=amrc.co.uk|title=Advanced Materials Research Centre|accessdate=10 November 2009[/tpl] have all helped to raise the region's profile and to bring significant investment into Yorkshire.
Bradford, Halifax, Keighley and Huddersfield are traditional centres of wool milling.  These have since declined, and in areas such as Bradford, Dewsbury and Keighley have suffered a decline in their local economy.
North Yorkshire has an established tourist industry with two national parks (Yorkshire Dales National Park, North York Moors National Park), Harrogate, York and Scarborough and such an industry is growing in Leeds.  Kingston upon Hull is Yorkshire's largest port and has a large manufacturing base, its fishing industry has however declined somewhat in recent years.  The North still has an agricultural backdrop, although this is much more diversified than once was the case, with tourism to help support local businesses. Harrogate and Knaresborough both have small but strong legal and financial sectors. Harrogate is a major European conference and exhibition destination with both the Great Yorkshire Showground and Harrogate International Centre in the town.
Coal mining was prolific in the south of the county during the 19th century and for most of the 20th century, particularly around Barnsley and Wakefield. As late as the 1970s, the number of miners working in the area was still in six figures.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/bradford/sense_of_place/miners/miners_state_of_the_industry.shtml |title=BBC - Bradford and West Yorkshire - A Sense of Place - Coal mining in West Yorkshire: The end of an era |accessdate=16 November 2011[/tpl] However, the bulk of the industry was placed under threat on 6 March 1984 when the Conservative governed National Coal Board announced the closure of 20 pits nationwide (some of them in South Yorkshire) in a move which would result in the loss of some 20,000 jobs, a significant percentage of these being in the region as well. Three days later, miners in South Yorkshire went on strike and within a short time most of the rest of the country's miners had followed suit. Orgreave coking plant near Rotherham was picketed by striking miners on 29 May that year, with the subsequent clashes between miners and police resulting in 69 injuries and 81 arrests.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/29/newsid_2494000/2494793.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY | 29 | 1984: Miners and police clash at Orgreave  |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |location=London |accessdate=16 November 2011 |date=29 May 1984[/tpl] On 15 June, a striking miner was killed in a clash at Kellingley Colliery near Pontefract. Several other coal pits in the area were also scene of violent clashes before the strike finally ended on 3 March 1985 after virtually a whole year.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/bradford/sense_of_place/miners/miners_strike.shtml |title=BBC - Bradford and West Yorkshire - A Sense of Place - Coal mining in West Yorkshire: The end of an era  |accessdate=16 November 2011[/tpl] By March 2004, a mere three coalpits remained open in the area.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3514549.stm |title=BBC NEWS | UK | Watching the pits disappear  |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |location=London |accessdate=16 November 2011 |date=5 March 2004[/tpl] Three years later, the only remaining coal pit in the region was Maltby Colliery near Rotherham.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/6400421.stm |title=BBC NEWS | England | South Yorkshire | Jobs safeguarded as coal pit sold  |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |location=London |accessdate=16 November 2011 |date=27 February 2007[/tpl]
Many large British companies are based in Yorkshire or were founded there. These include; Morrisons (Bradford), Asda (Leeds), Jet2.com (Leeds), Ronseal (Sheffield), Optare (Leeds), Wharfedale (Leeds), Plaxton (Scarborough), Little Chef (Sheffield), Halifax Bank (Halifax), Yorkshire Bank (Leeds), Yorkshire Building Society (Bradford), GHD (Leeds), Marks and Spencer (Leeds), Burtons (Leeds), Jaeger Ilkley, Magnet Kitchens (Keighley), McCains (Scarborough), First Direct (Leeds), Ebuyer (Howden), Tetley's Brewery (Leeds), Timothy Taylor Brewery (Keighley), Bradford and Bingley (Bingley) and Skipton Building Society (Skipton).

==Transport==

The most prominent road in Yorkshire, historically called the Great North Road, is known as the A1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iht.org/motorway/a1nrccintro.htm|publisher=The Motorway Archive|title=Region: North East - Trunk Road A1 in the North Riding of Yorkshire|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl] This trunk road passes through the centre of the county and is the prime route from London to Edinburgh.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/a1m/ |title=Motorway Database |accessdate=24 April 2008 |last= Marshall |first=Chris |first2=Clive |last2=Jones|last3= Chris "c2R"|first4= John |last4=Mohan |first5=George |last5=Carty |year=2008 |publisher=CBRD [/tpl] Another important road is the more easterly A19 road which starts in Doncaster and ends just north of Newcastle-upon-Tyne at Seaton Burn. The M62 motorway crosses the county from east to west from Hull towards Greater Manchester and Merseyside.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/2786.aspx|publisher=Highways.gov.uk|title=M62 Liverpool to Hull|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl] The M1 carries traffic from London and the south of England to Yorkshire. In 1999 about [tpl]convert|8|mi|km[/tpl] was added to make it swing east of Leeds and connect to the A1.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/motorway/m1/ |title=Motorway Database |accessdate=24 April 2008 |last=Marshall |first=Chris |year=2008 |publisher=CBRD [/tpl] The East Coast Main Line rail link between Scotland and London runs roughly parallel with the A1 through Yorkshire and the Trans Pennine rail link runs east to west from Hull to Liverpool via Leeds.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.yorkshire-forward.com/www/view.asp?content_id=1437&parent_id=1183|publisher=Yorkshire Forward|title=East Coast Mainline Upgrade Could Create 2000 New Jobs|accessdate=24 October 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061111004250/http://www.yorkshire-forward.com/www/view.asp?content_id=1437&parent_id=1183 |archivedate = 11 November 2006[/tpl]
Before the advent of rail transport, the seaports of Hull and Whitby played an important role in transporting goods. Historically canals were used, including the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, which is the longest canal in England. Mainland Europe (the Netherlands and Belgium) can be reached from Hull via regular ferry services from P&O Ferries.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.boozecruise.com/ferry_port/hull.asp|publisher=BoozeCruise.com|title=Hull Ferry Port Information|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl] Yorkshire also has air transport services from Leeds Bradford International Airport. This airport has experienced significant and rapid growth in both terminal size and passenger facilities since 1996, when improvements began, until the present day.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/uk/uk_leeds.html|publisher=Airports-Worldwide.com|title=Leeds Bradford International Airport|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl] South Yorkshire is served by the Robin Hood Airport Doncaster Sheffield, based in Finningley.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.robinhoodairport.com/page_history_of_the_airport_5.html|publisher=RobinHoodAirport.com|title=History of the Airport|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl]  Sheffield City Airport opened in 1997 after years of Sheffield having no airport, due to a council decision in the 1960s not to develop one because of the city's good rail links with London and the development of airports in other nearby areas.  The newly opened airport never managed to compete with larger airports such as Leeds Bradford International Airport and East Midlands Airport and attracted only a few scheduled flights, while the runway was too short to support low cost carriers.  The opening of Doncaster Sheffield Airport, effectively made the airport redundant and it officially closed in April 2008.

==Culture==

The culture of the  people of Yorkshire  is an accumulated product of a number of different civilisations who have directly controlled its history, including; the Celts (Brigantes and Parisii), Romans, Angles, Norse Vikings and Normans amongst others.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/summary/117892308/SUMMARY?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|publisher=InterScience.wiley.com |title=Northern Britons by Christopher A. Snyder|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl] The western  part of the historic North Riding had an additional infusion of Breton culture due to the Honour of Richmond being occupied by Alain Le Roux, grandson of Geoffrey I, Duke of Brittany.[tpl]cite web |url=http://everything2.com/e2node/Earl%2520of%2520Richmond|publisher=Everything.com|title=Earl of Richmond|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl] The people of Yorkshire are immensely proud of their county and local culture and it is sometimes suggested they identify more strongly with their county than they do with their country.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&obj_id=11797&speeches=1|publisher=Conservatives.com|title=He's a shrewd, straight-talking Yorkshireman - not English, mind you, Yorkshire|accessdate=24 October 2007[/tpl] Yorkshire people have their own Yorkshire dialects and accents and are, or rather were, known as Tykes. Though distinct accents remain, dialects are no longer in everyday use. Some have argued the dialect was a fully fledged language in its own right.[ref]
