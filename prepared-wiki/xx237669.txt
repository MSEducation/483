==History==

The game was called the Dallas Football Classic until TicketCity, an online reseller of sports and entertainment tickets, agreed to be the title game's first title sponsor.http://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/11/08/dallas-bowl-game-gets-new-title-sponsor/
The Northwestern Wildcats of the Big Ten Conference faced the Texas Tech Red Raiders of the Big 12 Conference in the inaugural game.

==Stadium==

The Cotton Bowl stadium opened in 1932.  Originally known as the Fair Park Bowl, it is located in Fair Park, site of the State Fair of Texas.  Due to the immense crowds that  SMU running back Doak Walker drew to the stadium during his college career in the late 1940s, the stadium became known as "The House That Doak Built."  The Cotton Bowl Classic called the stadium home from the bowl's inception in 1937 until the 2010 game. The National Football League's Dallas Cowboys called the Cotton Bowl home for 11 years, from the team's formation in 1960 until 1971, when the Cowboys moved to the Texas Stadium.

==Tie-ins==

The Heart of Dallas Bowl has tie-ins with the Big Ten Conference, the Big 12 Conference, and Conference USA. 
For its first four playings, the Big 12 and C-USA alternated bids with the Big 12 receiving the bid in odd-numbered years and C-USA in even numbered years while the Big Ten was contracted to send a team to all four games. The 2011 game featured Texas Tech of the Big 12, the 2012 game featured Houston of C-USA, the 2013 game featured Oklahoma State of the Big 12, and the 2014 game featured North Texas of C-USA. The Big Ten sent Northwestern, Penn State, and Purdue for the first three years. The conference could not fulfill its obligation to the bowl in 2014 as it did not have enough bowl eligible teams, so the selection committee chose an at-large team, UNLV from the Mountain West Conference, to take their place.
Beginning with the 2015 playing, the arrangement will be modified so that a C-USA team plays in all four bowls and the Big Ten and Big 12 alternate.
