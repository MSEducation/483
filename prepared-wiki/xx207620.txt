Adalberto "Bitto" Albertini (1924â€“1999) was an Italian film director. He began his film career as a cameraman, and in 1969 he directed War Devils. In 1974 Albertini directed Black Emanuelle starring the then unknown Laura Gemser. Her subsequent successful career meant that she was absent from Black Emanuelle No 2, and Albertini instead had to cast actress Sharon Leslie in the title role. The film without Gemser was unsuccessful, and Albertini was ruined.
In 1977 he released Yellow Emanuelle as a come back. The film, starring Chai Lee, was very successful. However the film never reached the popularity of Joe D'Amato's series. Albertini was by then an almost forgotten director, his last two films were "Mondo's" set in Asia, depicting socking rituals and savage violence. Bitto is perhaps best remembered for giving the world Laura Gemser.
He died in Rome in 1999 at age 74.
