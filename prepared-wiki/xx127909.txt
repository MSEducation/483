==Timeline==

===December===

During December 1977, a cold wave started around the eastern United States. This cold wave heavily hit Ohio and Michigan, and its average winter temperature was the second lowest in its history, rivaled only by an even colder wave that hit the previous winter.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistory.org/etcetera/exhibits/swio/pages/content/1977_coldWave.htm|title=Winter 1977: Statewide Cold Wave |publisher=Ohio Historical Society|accessdate=2008-09-25[/tpl]

===January===

Like most cold waves of the 1970s, temperatures in January dropped to extreme lows. Windchills across the plains fell to -70's°F. Severe cold pounded from the Plains states, to the Eastern states. Schools and business were closed when pipelines froze over, and severe driving conditions took place. Blowing snow and severe windchills caused very dangerous conditions to be outside for more than 15 minutes. Some people staying outside with exposed skin, got severe frostbite or hypothermia. Some states were declared a state of emergency with the severe cold. Windchill advisories took place for many consecutive days. Some states in the Midwest and the Northeast saw a blizzard too.

===February===

In February, 5 states saw their coldest February since record-keeping began; February 1978 was even the coldest month for a few states. Severe cold still covered areas from the Northeast and Midwest. Schools began to close because of the extreme cold. Homeless people had a hard time finding shelter, causing some deaths. Snow and blowing wind created dangerous wind chills. Due to blowing snow, ice, and severe cold, semi trucks had their deliveries delayed. Some locations saw a record-long period of below zero °F (-18 °C) weather.

===March===

The severe cold wave ended in March, when average or even above average temperatures occurred. Sioux Falls saw their second coldest winter on record during the previous months. Snow melting and flooding caused damage to some locations. The year 1978 was very cold annually for the USA.
