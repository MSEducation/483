==Life==

As a teenager, Bei Dao was a member of the Red Guards, the enthusiastic followers of Mao Zedong who enforced the dictates of the Cultural Revolution, often through violent means. He had misgivings about the Revolution and was "re-educated" as a construction worker, from 1969 to 1980.http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/beidao.htm Bei Dao and Mang Ke founded the magazine JintianJintian (Today), the central publication of the Misty Poets, which was published from 1978 until 1980, when it was banned. The work of the Misty Poets and Bei Dao in particular were an inspiration to pro-democracy movements in China. Most notable was his poem "Huida" (回答, "The Answer") which was written during the 1976 Tiananmen demonstrations in which he participated. The poem was taken up as a defiant anthem of the pro-democracy movement and appeared on posters during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. During the 1989 protests and subsequent shootings, Bei Dao was at a literary conference in Berlin and was not allowed to return to China until 2006. (Three other leading Misty Poets — Gu Cheng, Duo Duo, and Yang Lian — were also exiled.) His then wife, Shao Fei, and their daughter were not allowed to leave China to join him for another six years.
Since 1987, Bei Dao has lived and taught in England, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, France, and the United States.  His work has been translated into twenty-five languages, including five poetry volumes in EnglishUnlock (2000), Landscape Over Zero (1996), Forms of Distance (1994), Old Snow (1992), The August Sleepwalker (1990) along with the story collection Waves (1990) and the essay collections Blue House (2000) and Midnight's Gate (2005). Bei Dao continued his work in exile. His work has been included in anthologies such as The Red Azalea: Chinese Poetry Since the Cultural Revolution (1990)[tpl]cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1rkPu4q1uXYC&pg=PA75&dq=Bei+Dao&cd=8#v=onepage&q=Bei%20Dao&f=false| chapter=Bei Dao| title=The Red Azalea: Chinese Poetry Since the Cultural Revolution| editors=Edward Morin, Fang Dai| others=Edward Morin, Fang Dai, Dennis Ding| publisher=University of Hawaii Press| year= 1990| isbn=978-0-8248-1320-8 [/tpl] and Out of the Howling Storm: The New Chinese poetry.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qSzCeKE-zYEC&pg=PR14&dq=Bei+Dao&lr=&cd=12#v=onepage&q&f |title=Out of the Howling Storm: The New Chinese Poetry: Poems by Bei Dao|editor=Tony Barnstone| publisher=Wesleyan University Press| year= 1993| isbn= 978-0-8195-1210-9 [/tpl]
