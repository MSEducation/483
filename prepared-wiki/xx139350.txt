==Biography==

Frank is the only child of American painter, Eleanore Lockspeiser (1909–1986) and English musicologist and art critic, Edward Lockspeiser (1905–1973). During World War II, Mary was sent to live in Brooklyn, New York with her maternal grandpartents, Gregory and Eugenie Weinstein.  She studied modern dance with Martha Graham from 1945 to 1947 and was admitted to the High School for Music and Art in New York.  In 1949 she transferred to the Professional Children's School where she majored in dance.  She met Swiss photographer, Robert Frank, whom she married in 1950.  About this time she studied wood carving at Alfred van Loen's studio.  She also studied drawing with Max Beckmann at the Brooklyn Museum Art School in New York and briefly with Hans Hofmann in 1951 and 1954 at Hofmann's Eighth Street School. By this time she had two children: Pablo (named after Picasso) born February 7, 1951, and Andrea, born April 21, 1954.  After her husband, Robert Frank, gained a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1955 she travelled with him and the children the following two years across the United States.
In 1969 Frank began her relationship with the Zabriskie Gallery in New York. Inspired by the sculpture and pottery of Margaret Ponce Israel, she began working in clay.  She divorced Robert Frank in the same year.  In 1973 she purchased a summer home in Lake Hill, New York and built her first kiln.
On December 28, 1974 her 21-year old daughter, Andrea, was killed in a plane crash in the Guatemalan jungle.  About a year later her son Pablo developed Hodgkin's lymphoma and died on November 11, 1994 in Pennsylvania.  Frank currently lives and works in Lake Hill and New York City.  Since 1995, she is married to Leo Treltler, a pianist and music scholar.[ref]

In 1990 she was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994.
Currently she has works included in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Museum of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution, the Library of Congress, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Art at Yale University and the Jewish Museum.
