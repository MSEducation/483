Chief Sagwitch, his name meant "Orator",  (1822â€“ March 20, 1887) was born in 1822 on the lower Bear River (in today's Box Elder County, Utah). He was a nineteenth-century chieftain of a band of Northwestern Shoshone that converted to Mormonism.  His group were the ones killed in the Bear River Massacre.  Sagwitch himself was injured in the massacre but survived.
In 1873, Sagwitch was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) by George Washington Hill.  The rest of Sagwitch's band, totalling about 100 people, were also baptized into the LDS Church.  Sagwitch was also ordained an elder in the church.  
In 1875, Sagwitch and his wife were sealed in the Endowment House. Wilford Woodruff performed the ordinance.  
In 1880, Sagwitch and his band settled Washakie, Utah. They operated a farm here. They also contributed large amounts of labor towards the building of the Logan Utah Temple.
Sagwitch's son, Frank W. Warner, who was born Pisappih "Red Oquirrh" Timbimboo, but largely raised by the Amos Warner family after his mother was killed during the Bear River Massacre, was one of the earliest Native Americans to serve as a missionary for the LDS Church.  Sagwitch's grandson Moroni Timbimboo was the first Native American to serve as a bishop in the church.
A biography of Sagwitch by Scott R. Christensen entitled Sagwitch: Shoshone Chieftain, Mormon Elder, 1822-1887 was published by Utah State University Press in 1999.
