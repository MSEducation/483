[[Gaal (biblical figure)]]

CATEGORIES: Hebrew Bible people, Book of Judges

Gaal (Hebrew:גַּעַל) is a minor 12th century BCE biblical character, introduced in the 9th chapter of Judges in the Bible as the son of Ebed. His story is told in Judges 9:26-41.“Judges 9:26-41” Gaal had occupied Shechem and boasted to Zebul, the ruler of Shechem, that he could defeat Abimelech. Zebul warned Abimelech of Gaal's plans and offered a plan to defeat Gaal. Abimelech defeated Gaal and drove him back to the gates of Shechem. Zebul subsequently drove Gaal and his remaining kinsmen from Shechem altogether. He is not mentioned thereafter in the Bible. 
Daniel I. Block suggests that he may have been one of the "Lords of Shechem", but had previously gone into exile, being unwilling to support Abimelech.Daniel I. Block, Judges, Ruth: An Exegetical and Theological Exposition of Holy Scripture, p. 325.
