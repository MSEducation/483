Pirton is a small village and civil parish three miles north-west of Hitchin in Hertfordshire, England. The church, rebuilt in 1877, but with the remains of its 12th-century tower, is built within the bailey of a former castle. Pirton Grange, which was remodelled in the 18th century, is in the north of the parish, and is a particularly interesting, moated Elizabethan house with a timber framed gatehouse. Hammonds Farm and Rectory Farm, with its tithe barn, are also Elizabethan.
It first appeared in official records in the Domesday Book in 1086AD. But then it was known as Peritone (meaning 'Homestead of Pears')''A Foot on Three Daisies - Pirton's Story - Pirton Local History Group, 1987 ISBN 0-9512103-0-0
