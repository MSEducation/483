==Early life==

Mychal Judge was born Robert Emmett Judge on May 11, 1933 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of immigrants from County Leitrim, Ireland, and the firstborn of a pair of fraternal twins. His twin sister Dympna was born two days later. Judge was baptized in St. Paul's Church in Brooklyn on June 4. They and their older sister Erin, grew up during the Great Depression.Ford, Michael (September 1, 2002). Judge%2C Robert Emmett&f=false Father Mychal Judge: An Authentic American Hero. Paulist Press. p. 44. Google Books. Retrieved March 28, 2014. 
From the ages of three to six, he watched his father suffer and die of mastoiditis, a slow and painful illness of the skull and inner ear. To earn income following his father's death, Judge shined shoes at New York Penn Station from where he would visit St. Francis of Assisi Church, located across the street. Seeing the Franciscan friars there, he later said, "I realized that I didn't care for material things... I knew then that I wanted to be a friar."Daly, Michael, The Book of Mychal: The Surprising Life and Heroic Death of Father Mychal Judge. St. Martin's Press (2008). pp. 7–19.

==Career==

After spending his freshman year at the St. Francis Preparatory School in Brooklyn, where he studied under the Franciscan Brothers of Brooklyn, in 1948, at the age of 15, Judge began the formation process to enter the Order of Friars Minor. He transferred to St. Joseph's Seraphic Seminary in Callicoon, New York, the minor seminary of the Holy Name Province of the Order. After graduation, he enrolled at St. Bonaventure University in Olean, New York. In 1954 he was admitted to the novitiate of the Province in Paterson, New Jersey. After completing that year of formation, he received the religious habit and professed his first vows as a member of the Order.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hnp.org/who/deceased_members_bio.cfm?e_id=794|publisher=Franciscan Friars of Holy Name Province|title=Deceased Friars: Mychal F. Judge, O.F.M.[/tpl] At that time, he was given the religious name of Fallon Michael. (He later dropped 'Fallon' and changed 'Michael' to the Gaelic form, Mychal).Daly, Michael, Ibid (2008). pp. 30, 31, 46, 81. He resumed his college studies at St. Bonaventure University, where he earned his Bachelor's degree in 1957.[tpl]cite web|work=St. Bonaventure University|title=St. Bonaventure honors victims of 9/11 at prayer service, Mass|url=http://www.sbu.edu/About_News.aspx?id=36014&terms=mychal%20judge|date=September 9, 2011|accessdate=September 11, 2013[/tpl] He was allowed to profess his solemn vows as a full member of the Order in 1958. Following this, he did his theological studies at Holy Name College Seminary in Washington, D.C.. Upon completing these studies in 1961, he was ordained a priest.Daly, Michael, Ibid (2008). pp. 23–33. 
After his ordination, Judge was assigned to the Shrine of St. Anthony in Boston, Massachusetts. Following there, he served in various parishes served by the Franciscan friars: St. Joseph Parish in East Rutherford, New Jersey, Sacred Heart Parish in Rochelle Park, New Jersey, Holy Cross Parish in the Bronx and St. Joseph Parish in West Milford, New Jersey. For three years he served as assistant to the President of Siena College, operated by the friars in Loudonville, New York. In 1986 he was assigned to St. Francis of Assisi Church in Manhattan, where he had first come to know the friars. He lived and worked there until his death.Daly, Michael, Ibid (2008). pp. 37–77.
Around 1971, Judge became an alcoholic, although he never showed obvious signs. In 1978, with the support of Alcoholics Anonymous, he became sober and continued to share his personal story of alcoholism to help others facing addiction.Daly, Michael, Ibid (2008). p. 62.
In 1992, Judge was appointed a chaplain to the New York City Fire Department. As chaplain, he offered encouragement and prayers at fires, rescues, and hospitals, and counseled firemen and their families, often working 16-hour days. "His whole ministry was about love. Mychal loved the fire department and they loved him."Saint of 9/11 (film) homepage spoken by Mychal McNichols in the film, Saint of 9/11 (2006) He was a member of AFSCME Local 299 (District Council 37)."We Remember" McEntee, Gerald.  firedoglake.com. September 9, 2011
In New York, Judge was also well known for ministering to the homeless, the hungry, recovering alcoholics, people with AIDS, the sick, injured, and grieving, immigrants, gays and lesbians and those alienated by the Church and society.Ford, Michael, Father Mychal Judge: An Authentic American Hero. Paulist Press (2002). pp. 107–139.
For example, Judge once gave the winter coat off his back to a homeless woman in the street, later saying, "She needed it more than me." When he anointed a man who was dying of AIDS, the man asked him, "Do you think God hates me?" Judge just picked him up, kissed him, and silently rocked him in his arms.Saint of 9/11 film, Ibid (2006)
Even before his death, many considered Judge to be a living saint for his extraordinary works of charity and his deep spirituality. While praying, he would sometimes "become so lost in God, as if lost in a trance, that he'd be shocked to find several hours had passed."Daly, Michael, Ibid (2008). p. 320. Judge's former spiritual director, the former Jesuit, John J. McNeill, observed that, "He achieved an extraordinary degree of union with the divine. We knew we were dealing with someone directly in line with God."Ford, Michael, Ibid (2002). pp. 114–115.

==September 11th attacks==

On September 11, 2001, upon learning that the World Trade Center had been hit by the first of two jetliners, Judge rushed to the site. He was met by Rudolph Giuliani, the Mayor of New York City, who asked him to pray for the city and its victims. Judge administered the Last Rites to some bodies lying on the streets, then entered the lobby of the World Trade Center North Tower, where an emergency command post had been organized. There he continued offering aid and prayers for the rescuers, the injured and the dead. 
When the South Tower collapsed at 9:59 am, debris went flying through the North Tower lobby, killing many inside, including Judge. At the moment he was struck in the head and killed, Judge was repeatedly praying aloud, "Jesus, please end this right now! God, please end this!", according to Judge's biographer and New York Daily News columnist Michael Daly.(dead link). Daily News (New York). February 11, 2002. "Judge stood alone at a plate glass window overlooking the carnage and devastation. A Fire Department photographer heard him praying aloud, Jesus, please end this right now! God, please end this!Daly, Michael, Ibid (2008) p. 336.
Shortly after his death, an NYPD lieutenant found Judge's body. He and two firemen, an FDNY Emergency Medical Technician detailed to the Office of Emergency Management (OEM), and one civilian bystander then carried Judge's body out of the North Tower. This event was captured in the documentary film 9/11, shot by Jules and Gedeon Naudet. Shannon Stapleton, a photographer from Reuters, photographed Judge's body being carried out of the rubble by the five men.Stapleton, Shannon (September 11, 2001). "911". Shannon Stapleton Photojournalist. Retrieved November 29, 2013. It became one of the most famous images related to 9/11. The Philadelphia Weekly reported that the photograph is "considered an American Pietà."Prigge, Matt (May 3, 2006). "Upward Christian Soldier". Philadelphia Weekly. Judge's body was laid before the altar of St. Peter’s Catholic church before being taken to the medical examiner.[tpl]fact|date=November 2013[/tpl]
Mychal Judge was designated as "Victim 0001" and thereby recognized as the first official victim of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Other victims died before him including air crew, passengers, and occupants of the towers, but Judge was the first certified fatality because his was the first body to be recovered and taken to the medical examiner.Daly, Michael, Ibid (2008) p. 347.
Judge's body was formally identified by NYPD Detective Steven McDonald, a long-time friend. The New York Medical Examiner found that Judge died of "blunt force trauma to the head".Daly, Michael, Ibid (2008) p. 347.

==Mourning and honors==

3,000 people attended Judge's funeral Mass on September 15, 2001, at St. Francis of Assisi Church, which was presided over by Cardinal Edward Egan, the Archbishop of New York at that time.  Former President Bill Clinton, who attended the funeral, said that Judge's death was "a special loss. We should lift his life up as an example of what has to prevail ... We have to be more like Father Mike than the people who killed him."Glenn Holsten (director). Saint of 9/11.  Equality Forum. 2006.

==Gay orientation and affiliations==

Following his death a few of his friends and associates revealed that Judge was gay – as a matter of orientation rather than practice, as he was a celibate priest.[tpl]dead link|date=April 2009[/tpl][tpl]citation |title=Our Heroes |periodical=The Advocate |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1589/is_2001_Oct_23/ai_79236008/pg_2 |date=October 23, 2001 |first=Mubarak |last=Dahir |accessdate=2007-10-24 |format= – Scholar search [/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.tampabaycoalition.com/files/1003FatherMikeBW.htm | title=Tributes keep flowing for NYC Fire Dept. chaplain Mychal Judge, one of those who died in the World Trade Center attacks | publisher=Bay Windows | date=2001-09-27 | last=Cassels | first=Peter | accessdate=2004-04-16[/tpl] According to fire commissioner Thomas Von Essen: "I actually knew about his homosexuality when I was in the Uniformed Firefighters Association. I kept the secret, but then he told me when I became commissioner five years ago. He and I often laughed about it, because we knew how difficult it would have been for the other firemen to accept it as easily as I had. I just thought he was a phenomenal, warm, sincere man, and the fact that he was gay just had nothing to do with anything."[tpl]cite journal|journal=New York Magazine|title=The Firemen's Friar |url=http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/news/sept11/features/5372/index2.html |date=November 12, 2001|last=Senior |first=Jennifer|accessdate=2006-09-14[/tpl]
The revelations about Judge's sexual orientation were not without controversy, however. Dennis Lynch, a lawyer, wrote an article about Judge that appeared on the website catholic.org. Lynch claimed that the priest was not gay and that any attempt to define him as gay was due to "homosexual activists" who wanted to "attack the Catholic Church" and turn the priest into "a homosexual icon".Lynch, Dennis (June 26, 2002). "A September 11th Hijacking". Catholic Online. 
Others refuted Lynch’s claims with evidence that Judge did, in fact, identify himself as gay, both to others and in his personal journals.Daly, Michael, Ibid (2008). pp. 86, 301–302.  
Judge was a long-term member of Dignity, a Catholic LGBT activist organization that advocates for change in the Catholic Church's teaching on homosexuality.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/nyregion/25judge.html | title=Admirers of Fallen 9/11 Hero Disdain the Vatican's Likely Plan to Bar Gays as Priests|newspaper=The New York Times| date=2005-09-25 | last=Newman | first=Andy | accessdate=2008-04-17[/tpl]"What is Dignity?" DignityUSA.[tpl]deadlink|date=November 2013[/tpl] On October 1, 1986, the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued an encyclical, On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons,[tpl]deadlink|date=November 2013[/tpl]"Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons". DignityUSA. [tpl]deadlink|date=November 2013[/tpl] which declared homosexuality to be a "strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil". In response, many bishops, including John Cardinal O'Connor, banned Dignity from diocesan churches under their control. Judge then welcomed Dignity's AIDS ministry to the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi, which is under the control of the Franciscan friars, thereby partially circumventing the cardinal's ban of Dignity.Ford, Michael, Ibid (2002). pp. 119–120.
Judge disagreed with official Roman Catholic teaching regarding homosexuality,Ford, Michael, Ibid (2002). p. 182. though by all accounts he remained celibate. Judge often asked, "Is there so much love in the world that we can afford to discriminate against any kind of love?"Ford, Michael, Ibid (2002). p. 124.
