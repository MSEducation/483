Antique was a Swedish-Greek singing duo consisting of Elena Paparizou (Έλενα Παπαρίζου in Greek) and Nikos Panagiotidis (Νίκος Παναγιωτίδης in Greek) originating from Sweden which combined Greek popular music and lyrics with a Nordic dance pop beat. Both Paparizou and Panagiotidis were born and raised in Sweden by Greek parents. They were the first ever to be nominated for a Swedish Grammis in the category modern dance with a Greek song. In 2001, Antique were selected to represent Greece at the Eurovision Song Contest in Copenhagen with the song "Die for You", sung in a blend of English and Greek, ending with a third place – only behind Estonia and hosts Denmark.

==Career==

In 1999, some DJ friends of Elena Paparizou's brother asked her to make a demo of the Notis Sfakianakis hit "Opa Opa".[tpl]cite news | title= Έλενα Παπαρίζου: Baby Tiger | work= Nitro Magazine | author= Kazoni, Sonia  | page= 248 |date=May 2008[/tpl] [tpl]Gr icon[/tpl]  Paparizou told them that the lyrics are for a man, so she asked to sing it with her childhood friend Nikos Panagiotidis,[tpl]cite web | title = ΒΙΟΓΡΑΦΙΚΟ Ελενα Παπαρίζου | url = http://www.mad.tv/artists/?id=628&m=bio[/tpl] MAD TV.

Paparizou admitted that Greek music had been something of an acquired taste for her, and that the name "Antique" was probably a reflection of her childhood impression of it being something rather distant and old-fashioned; something that she only really associated with her summer holidays in Greece.[tpl]cite web | title = Έλενα Παπαρίζου | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caDFJDe2img[/tpl][tpl]el icon[/tpl] Elena Paparizou's Biography on Alpha TV's "Kafes Me Tin Eleni Menegaki".

Their later singles "Dinata Dinata","Follow Me", and "Moro Mou" also charted well.
Despite being relatively unknown in Greece, the duo entered the national final to be Greece's representatives in the Eurovision Song Contest 2001 in Copenhagen, Denmark with the song "(I Would) Die for You", written by Nikos Terzis with lyrics by Antonis Pappas, placing joint first, but being named the winners by default as they had won the public vote. The song placed third in the actual contest with 147 points; although equaled by the 2004 entry, it was the best placing Greece had ever received until Paparizou won the contest as a solo artist in 2005.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] The song went on to become their biggest hit in Greece, reaching Platinum status, while it peaked at number three in Sweden, and charted elsewhere.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl] Antique's success in the contest led to them earning recognition in Greece and working there for the rest of their career. In continuation, they recorded four studio albums that achieved mild success, performed a small European tour, and collaborated with artists such as Katy Garbi and Slavi Trifonov. In 2002, they recorded the song "V-Power" in both English and Greek versions. The songs were included on the 14-track promotional album released for Royal Dutch Shell by V2 Records to promote the premium unleaded gasoline product known as V-Power. Antique disbanded in late 2003 on good terms with both members pursuing solo careers. There are currently no intentions of reuniting the group, although they have both expressed to want to reunite in the future.[tpl]cite web | title = Sizzling Elena Paparizou plans hot new album| url = http://www.lgr.co.uk/news/entertainment/12438/sizzling-elena-paparizou-plans-hot-new-album/[/tpl] London Greek Radio.
