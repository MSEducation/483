A. Milne estate two sample stories of his sequel, and it took more than eight years for them to approve the project. Although he made some changes in the popular children's series by adding a new figure: Lottie, the Otter. David Benedictus said that he would be on the alert if Disney showed any sign of including an otter in the new Winnie the Pooh films.
Upon the book's publication he admitted to nerves over its reception, saying, "What's the worst thing that can happen, that I'll be torn apart by wild journalists? Happened before and I survived. At worst everyone will hate me and I'll just crawl under a bush and hide – I can live with that. Some people do hate the whole idea of a sequel, but it's not as if I'm doing any damage to the original, that will still be there. My hope is that people will finish reading a cracking story and just want more of them, and that's where I come in." Michael Brown, chairman of the Pooh Properties Trust, said Benedictus had a "wonderful feel" for the world of Pooh.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/05/books/05pooh.html?hpw |title=The Same Pooh Bear, but an Otter Has Arrived |last=Lee |first=Felicia |date=4 October 2009 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=21 October 2009[/tpl]
