The MX-5, released as the MX-5 Miata [tpl]IPAc-en|m|i|ˈ|ɑː|t|ə[/tpl] in North America and the Roadster in Japan, is a lightweight two-seater roadster with a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout.  Manufactured by Mazda in Hiroshima, Japan, the model debuted in 1989 at the Chicago Auto Show. The MX-5 was conceived as a small roadster – with light weight and minimal mechanical complexity limited only by legal and safety requirements; technologically modern, but philosophically descending from small British and Italian roadsters of the 1960s such as the Triumph Spitfire, MG MGB, Fiat 124 Sport Spider, Alfa Romeo Spider, and Lotus Elan.
The second generation MX-5 (NB) was launched in 1998 and the current (NC) model has been in production since 2005. It continues to be the best-selling two-seat convertible sports car in historyMazda MX-5 on Mazda Gabriel and by February 2011 over 900,000 MX-5s had been built and sold around the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/263167/mazda_mx5_production_passes_900000.html?CMP=NLC-Newsletters&uid=1d9a228ddfbbf1a3300875dcac276eac |title=Auto Express 4 February 2011 |publisher=Autoexpress.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-06-02[/tpl]
Since the launch of the third generation, Mazda consolidated worldwide marketing using the MX-5 name with the exception of North America where it is marketed as the MX-5 Miata.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mazdausa.com|title=Mazda USA[/tpl]  The name Miata derives from Old High German for reward.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.miata.net/misc/reward.html |title=Reward |publisher=Miata.net |date= |accessdate=2009-05-09[/tpl]

==Generations and overview==

The MX5's first generation, the NA, sold over 400,000 units from 1989 to 1997 – with a [tpl]convert|1.6|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] straight-4 engine to 1993, a [tpl]convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] engine thereafter (with a DE-tuned 1.6 as a budget option in some markets) – recognizable by its pop-up headlights. The second generation (NB) was introduced in 1999 with a slight increase in engine power; it can be recognized by the fixed headlights and the glass rear window, although first generation owners may opt for the glass window design when replacing the original top. The third generation (NC) was introduced in 2006 with a [tpl]convert|2.0|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] engine.
Launched at a time when production of small roadsters had almost come to an end, the Alfa Romeo Spider was the only comparable volume model in production at the time of the MX-5's launch. Just a decade earlier, a host of similar models — notably the MG B, Triumph TR7, Triumph Spitfire, and Fiat Spider — had been available.
The body is a conventional, but light, unibody or monocoque construction, with (detachable) front and rear subframes. The MX-5 also incorporates a longitudinal truss, marketed as the Powerplant Frame (PPF), providing a rigid connection between the engine and differential, minimizing flex and contributing to responsive handling. Some MX-5s feature limited slip differentials and anti-lock braking system. Traction control is an option available on NC models. The earlier cars weighed just over a ton, with engine power output usually [tpl]convert|116|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl]. The later cars were heavier, with higher power engines.
With an approximate 50:50 front/rear weight balance, the car has nearly neutral handling. Inducing oversteer is easy and very controllable, thus making the MX-5 a popular choice for amateur and stock racing, including, in the US, the Sports Car Club of America's Solo2 autocross and Spec Miata race series, and in the UK, the Ma5da racing championship.
The MX-5 has won awards including Wheels Magazine 's Car of the Year for 1989 and 2005; Sports Car International's "best sports car of the 1990s" and "ten best sports cars of all time"; 2005–2006 Car of the Year Japan; and 2005 Australian Car of the Year. The Miata has also made Car and Driver magazine's annual Ten Best list 14 times. In their December 2009 issue, Grassroots Motorsports magazine named the Miata as the most important sports car built during the previous 25 years.
In 2009, English automotive critic Jeremy Clarkson wrote: [tpl]quote|The fact is that if you want a sports car, the MX-5 is perfect. Nothing on the road will give you better value. Nothing will give you so much fun. The only reason I’m giving it five stars is because I can’t give it 14.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/driving/jeremy_clarkson/article6796416.ece |title=Mazda MX-5 2.0i Sport Tech |publisher=The Sunday Times |date= August 16, 2009|accessdate=2010-09-01 | location=London | first=Jeremy | last=Clarkson[/tpl][/tpl]
The MX-5 has 100,000 examples registered in the UK as of June 2011.[tpl]cite web|author=Olly Smith |url=http://howmanyleft.co.uk/combined/mazda_mx5 |title=Combined stats (51 models) MAZDA MX5 - How Many Left? |publisher=Howmanyleft.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-23[/tpl]

==Design genesis==

In 1976, Bob Hall, a journalist at Motor Trend magazine who was an expert in Japanese cars and fluent in the language, met Kenichi Yamamoto and Gai Arai, head of Research and Development at Mazda. Yamamoto and Gai Arai asked Hall what kind of car Mazda should make in the future:
[tpl]quote|I babbled ... how the ... simple, bugs-in-the-teeth, wind-in-the-hair, classically-British sports car doesn't exist any more. I told Mr. Yamamoto that somebody should build one ... inexpensive roadster.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/convertibles/0503_ikigai_man |title=Details on the history of Bob Hall's influence on the design, development and manufacture of the MX-5[/tpl][/tpl]
In 1981, Hall moved to a product planning position with Mazda USA and again met Yamamoto, now chairman of Mazda Motors, who remembered their conversation about a roadster and in 1982 gave Hall the go-ahead to research the idea further. At this time Hall hired designer Mark Jordan to join the newly formed Mazda design studio in Southern California. There, Hall and Jordan collaborated on the parameters of the initial image, proportion and visualization of the "light-weight sports" concept. In 1983, the idea turned concept was approved under the "Offline 55" program, an internal Mazda initiative that sought to change the way new models were developed. Thus, under head of project Masakatsu, the concept development was turned into a competition between the Mazda design teams in Tokyo and California.
The Californian team proposed a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, codenamed Duo 101, in line with the British roadster ancestry, but their Japanese counterparts favored the more common front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout or the rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout.
The first round of judging the competing designs was held in April 1984, with designs presented on paper only. The mid-engined car appeared to offer favorable qualities, although it was known at the time that such a layout would struggle to meet the noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) requirements of the project. It was only at the second round of the competition in August 1984, when full-scale clay models were presented, that the Duo 101 won the competition and was selected as the basis for what would become the MX-5.
The Duo 101, so named as either a soft top or hard top could be used, incorporated many key stylistic cues inspired by the Lotus Elan, a 1960s roadster, including the door handles and grill opening. International Automotive Design (IAD) in Worthing, England was commissioned to develop a running prototype, codenamed V705. It was built with a fiberglass body, a [tpl]convert|1.4|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] engine from a Mazda Familia and components from a variety of early Mazda models. The V705 was completed in August 1985 and taken to the US where it rolled on the roads around Santa Barbara, California and got positive reactions.
The project received final approval on 18 January 1986. The model's codename was changed to P729 as it moved into the production phase, under head of program Toshihiko Hirai. The task of constructing five engineering mules (more developed prototypes) was again allocated to IAD, which also conducted the first front and rear crash tests on the P729. While Tom Matano,[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/road-tests/on-wheels-mazda-mx5-mkiii-474675.html |title=Independent 23 April 2006 |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2006-04-23 |accessdate=2011-06-02[/tpl] After Mark Jordan, Wu Huang Chin, Norman Garrett, and Koichi Hayashi worked on the final design, the project was moved to Japan for engineering and production details.
By 1989, with a definitive model name now chosen, the MX-5 (as in "Mazda Experiment", project number 5) was ready to be introduced to the world as a true lightweight sports car, weighing just [tpl]convert|940|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].
Although Mazda's concept was for the MX-5 to be an inexpensive sports car, at introduction the design met strong demand, with many dealers placing customers on pre-order lists and several dealers across North America increasing the vehicle markup.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

===Jinba ittai===

Mazda used a design credo across the three generations of the MX5's development: the phrase [tpl]Nihongo3|[tpl]IPA-ja|dʑimba itːai|[/tpl]|人馬一体|Jinba ittai[/tpl],[tpl]cite web|title=MAZDA MX-5 MIATA: THE WORLD’S MOST POPULAR TWO-SEAT CONVERTIBLE SPORTS CAR |publisher=Motorportal.com |url=http://motorportal.com/Mazda%20News/Mazda%20MX-5%20Miata.htm[/tpl] which translates loosely into English as "rider (jin) horse (ba) as one body (ittai)".
With the first generation of the MX-5, the phrase was developed into five specific core design requirements:

==First generation (NA)==

The MX-5 was unveiled at the Chicago Auto Show on February 10, 1989, with a price tag of US$14,000 (US$25,400 in 2011 adjusted for inflation[tpl]cite web|url=http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl |title=Official US inflation calculator[/tpl]).[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2010[/tpl] The MX-5, with production code NA, was made available for delivery to buyers worldwide in the following dates: May 1989 (as a 1990 model) in the US and Canada; September 1, 1989 in Japan; and 1990 in Europe. An optional hardtop was made available at the same time, in sheet moulding compound (SMC). Demand initially outstripped production, fueled by enthusiastic press reviews.
In Japan, the car was not badged as a Mazda, as the company was experimenting with the creation of different marques for deluxe models, similar to Nissan's Infiniti and Toyota's Lexus (both brands of which launched at the same time as the Miata). Instead, the Mazda MX-5 was sold as the Eunos Roadster in that market.
The body shell of the NA was all-steel with a light-weight aluminium hood. Overall dimensions were [tpl]convert|3970|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, [tpl]convert|1675|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in width, and [tpl]convert|1235|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] in height. Without options, the NA weighed only [tpl]convert|2150|lb|kg|abbr=on[/tpl]. Drag coefficient was indicated as 0.38. Suspension was an independent double wishbone on all four wheels, with an anti-roll bar at the front and rear. Four wheel-disc brakes, ventilated at the front, were behind alloy wheels with 185/60HR14 radial tires. The base model came with stamped steel wheels from the then-current 323/Protege.
The original MX-5 came with a [tpl]convert|1.6|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl]  dual overhead cam inline four-cylinder engine, producing [tpl]convert|86|kW|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl] at 6,800 rpm, and [tpl]convert|136|Nm|lbf.ft|abbr=on[/tpl] of torque at 5,500 rpm. The engine employs an electronic fuel injection system using a vane-type air flow meter and an electronic ignition system with a crankshaft angle sensor instead of a distributor.[tpl]Cite book|first=Norman III |last=Garrett |year=1998 |title=Mazda Miata performance handbook |publisher=MBI |isbn=0-7603-0437-8[/tpl] This engine, codename B6ZE(RS), was specifically designed for the MX-5 and featured a lightened crankshaft, flywheel, and aluminum sump with cooling fins.
Standard transmission was 5-speed manual. In Japan and the US, an optional automatic transmission was also offered but proved to be unpopular. The Japanese and American markets also received an optional viscous limited slip rear differential, although it was only available for cars with a manual transmission. To achieve the low introductory price, the base model was stripped. It had steel wheels, manual steering, roll-up windows, and no stereo or air-conditioning. Power steering, air-conditioning, and stereo were added as standard equipment in later years.
The NA could reach [tpl]convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] in 8.1 seconds and had a top speed of [tpl]convert|126|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] although Japanese market Eunos models were limited to [tpl]convert|112|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl]. This first generation of Miata (often referred to as the NA) included a special Limited Edition of 250 examples in 1991, produced in British Racing Green with the first use of tan interior, to celebrate the highly successful launch of the MX-5 in the UK. These have a numbered brass plaque on the dash above the glovebox and on the front of the Owners Book,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mx5-mazda.co.uk/ltdedition.htm |title=Mazda MX-5 Limited Edition|publisher=www.mx5-mazda.co.uk |date= |accessdate=15 November 2013[/tpl] and are fitted with alloy wheels from MSW (Mazda Sports Workshop) which are often mistaken for BBS's, but are entirely unique to this model.
1500 LE (Limited Edition) cars were produced in 1993. This model featured red leather interior, upgraded stereo, Nardi shift knob, leather-wrapped steering wheel, cruise, limited slip differential, power windows, power mirrors, power steering, air conditioning, BBS wheels, Bilstein shocks, front and rear spoilers, ABS brakes, stainless sill plates, and Harley style peanut tank door speaker trim. All 1993 LE cars came in black.
For the 1994 model year, the first-generation MX-5 was freshened with the introduction of the more powerful [tpl]convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] BP-ZE engine, dual airbags and a limited slip differential in some markets.  The chassis was substantially braced to meet new side-impact standards, most visibly by adding a "track bar" between the seatbelt towers inside the car, but also to the front and rear subframes. Also, 1994 and 1995 were the only years in which Mazda offered a light metallic blue paint (Laguna Blue Mica), making these cars rare collectors cars to some. 1994 also saw the introduction of the "R" package, a sport-themed package with Bilstein shocks and subtle underbody spoilers, in addition to the removal of unnecessary items such as power steering. No body style changes were made, however.
The new [tpl]convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] engine produced [tpl]convert|98|kW|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl], which was then increased to [tpl]convert|99|kW|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl] for the 1996 model year. The base weight increased to [tpl]convert|990|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]. Performance was improved slightly, the additional power being partly offset by the extra weight. In some markets such as Europe, the [tpl]convert|1.6|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] engine continued to be available as a lower-cost option, but was detuned to [tpl]convert|66|kW|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl]. This lower-powered model did not receive all the additional chassis bracing of the new [tpl]convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl]. Japanese and US cars were fitted with an optional Torsen LSD, which was far more durable than the previous viscous differential.
There were a number of trim levels and special editions available, determined by local Mazda marketing departments. In the US, the base model was offered for US$13,995 at launch and was very basic, with manual windows, steel wheels, and without A/C or power steering. The "A Package" offered power steering, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, aluminum alloy wheels and cassette stereo. The "B Package" added power windows, along with cruise control and headrest speakers, while the "C Package" included a tan interior and top and leather seats. The "R Package" was for racing, and the annual special editions were formalized as "M Editions". These included all of the luxury options from the "C Package" as well as special paint and, sometimes, special wheels. In the UK, to celebrate Mazda's 24 hours of Le Mans win, Mazda brought out a special edition of the MX-5, with the winner's color scheme (see Mazda 787B) and came equipped with BBR (Brodie Brittain Racing) turbo conversion; the car is one of the most sought after special edition cars of the MX-5s.
The first generation MX-5 was phased out with the 1997 model year (with the exception of 400 limited edition Berkeley models sold only in the UK in 1999 to mark the end of the NA), with the final 1500 NAs produced for the US market being the "STO" ("Special Touring Option") versions.

===M2 special editions===

A small range of Miata units were assembled by the M2 Incorporated. Founded in November 1991, M2, also known as "Mazda Too", was Mazda's new off-line planning / niche-house / Research & Development company back in the early '90s. The M2 Corp. employees had noble intentions — creating niche-mobiles derived from Mazda's volume products. Although M2's basic mission involved focusing on the "soft" aspects of vehicle design in an attempt to create more specifically targeted niche variants, the changes to the off-line cars would go well beyond mere cosmetics.
Heading the M2 operation was Mr. Masakatsu Kato, original father of the Miata (Eunos Roadster) in Japan, as well as creator of several Mazda concept vehicles. Kato-san was assisted by Hirotaka Tachibana, development engineer responsible for the superb dynamics of the FC (second-generation RX-7) and the NA Roadster (Miata MX-5). M2 Corp. was based out of Tokyo, Japan. M2-Corp was a 100% owned subsidiary of Mazda, and it was closed by Mazda in 1995. Mazda kept a similar program going with the Mazdaspeed vehicles, and then in the late '90s Mazdaspeed was absorbed into Mazda as a subsidiary company in Mazda Auto Tokyo. There were many types of M2 branded vehicles between 1991 and 1995, beginning with the 1001 up to the 1031 Cafe Racer (Dec-91).
M2-1001 Cafe Roadster (Dec-91) Limited 1/300
M2 Corp. released the M2-1001 Roadster in December 1991. It was a special "Limited Production" Roadster variant that was a short production run of only 300 units, in a special Blue/Black Mica Paint, with a sticker price of $26,000. Prospective buyers were required to show up in person at M2's Tokyo headquarters to register for a lottery to place an order for this extremely limited Roadster.
This upscale Eunos Roadster was M2's first turn-key, race-ready offering. Here is a list of some of the goodies that made it so popular: functional front airdam with integrated fog lamps, vintage aero mirrors, 4-point roll bar, vintage gauge cluster, fixed back bucket seats, polished 3-spoke steering wheel, stiffer suspension package with M2 specific rates, polished aluminum strut brace, upgraded exhaust by HKS, intake system, 1.6L motor with new aggressive pistons, upgraded camshaft, lightweight flywheel, LSD cooling intake, manual steering, manual windows (A/C was optional), racing pedals, centerless console with matching shortened radio bezel, aluminum gas filler cap, a more aggressive wheel & tire package (15" x 6" Panasport rims), and a rear spoiler (which became standard for the R package). The performance changes made to the Roadster would bump the power to [tpl]convert|132|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] @ 7,000 rpm, and [tpl]convert|109|lbf.ft|Nm|abbr=on[/tpl] of torque @ 5,500 rpm. Once released, it proved so popular that people were paying up to $35,000 for one.
M2-1002 Vintage Roadster (Nov-92) Limited 1/300
M2-CORP released its second Roadster in late 1992, with a sightly different front bumper but all the same items as the previous 1001 Roadster. This one did not do as well as the 1001.
M2-1028 Street Competition Roadster (Feb-94) Limited 1/300
M2-CORP released its third Roadster in early 1994, based on the original "Jinba Ittai" concept made by Toshihiko Hirai. This was billed as a track-ready Roadster. (The US saw a cheaper version known as the R-Package.) Offered in Chaste White or Brilliant Black only, this Roadster used the new 1.8L powerplant with upgraded pistons, camshafts, and other similar goodies as the previous 1001 and 1002. This Roadster had an output of close to [tpl]convert|150|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl], and included 14" Eunos Factory Rims with a unique gunmetal paint with polished lip. The only real changes were a new set of lightweight side mirrors, MOMO Steering Wheel, Centerless console, racing seats, racing tow hook,  a set of lower lip spoilers (R-Package), and a newly designed "Duck-Tail" trunk lid with integrated spoiler. The M2-1028 trunk lid was made from aluminum and weighed only [tpl]convert|7.7|lb|kg|abbr=on[/tpl], a very light weight from the original lid of [tpl]convert|15.5|lb|kg|abbr=on[/tpl]. It also came with a 6-point roll cage, but no soft-top, instead featuring a tarp that stretched over the cage. With optional FRP Hardtop with plexiglass rear window for more weight savings coming in at only [tpl]convert|19|lb|kg|abbr=on[/tpl].

===BBR MX-5 Turbo===

Brodie Britain Racing (BBR) of Brackley, United Kingdom, have had a long history of involvement with the first generation (NA) cars in the UK, having supplied parts and equipment for a dealer supplied BBR Turbo version of the car between 1990 and 1991. This raised power output to [tpl]convert|150|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl], and produced [tpl]convert|154|ftlb|Nm|abbr=on[/tpl] of torque. The kit comprised 68 parts and was covered by a full dealer warranty. They were supplied and fitted to around 750 UK spec cars, including for the 1991 'Le Mans' special edition, with a further 150 kits being supplied overseas.
Two decades later in 2011, BBR now offer a turn-key refurbishment package for old NA MX-5's, again including a turbo charger kit. This now increases power output to [tpl]convert|220|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl], and produces [tpl]convert|175|ftlb|Nm|abbr=on[/tpl] of torque. The estimated top speed is now [tpl]convert|140|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], with 0-60 approached in 5.5 seconds. The turbo charger used is the Garrett GT25 ball race unit, and the package also includes an air-to-air intercooler, and a digital piggy-back ECU to control timing, fueling, and boost pressures. Subject to a satisfactory donor car, the refurbishment and turbo upgrade package includes rust treatment, a paint respray, new seats, wheels, and other trim. As of January 2011 the cost for a 'refreshed' BBR MX-5 Turbo is £7,500.EVO magazine, Issue 153, February 2011, pages 88-91

===Technical specifications (UK)===

==Second generation (NB)==

The redesigned MX-5 was previewed at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 1997. In February 1998, Mazda released the second-generation MX-5, production code NB, for the 1999 model year. The NB featured a more powerful engine and external styling cues borrowed from the third generation Mazda RX-7 model, designed in 1995 by Tom Matano. Prices in the United States, the main market for the MX-5, started at US$19,770 (US$26,700 in 2011 adjusted for inflation).
Although many parts of the interior and body were different, the most notable changes were the headlamps: the first generation's retractable headlamps no longer passed pedestrian safety tests and were replaced by fixed ones. The new car grew slightly in width compared to the earlier model; its dimensions were: length [tpl]convert|3945|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], width [tpl]convert|1678|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl], height [tpl]convert|1228|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl] and wheelbase [tpl]convert|2265|mm|in|abbr=on[/tpl]. Without options, the NB weighed 1000 kg (2300 lb). The new generation was slightly more aerodynamic than the original, with a Cd figure of 0.36.
The NB continued to employ four-wheel independent suspension, with enlarged anti-roll bars at the front and rear, but the wheels, tires and brakes were significantly upgraded: anti-lock braking system was offered as an option; alloy wheels were now [tpl]convert|14|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] or [tpl]convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] in diameter and [tpl]convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] in width, depending on the trim package; sports models were equipped with the larger wheels and 195/50VR15 tires.
The BP-4W engine remained at [tpl]convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] but received several minor updates. The engine compression ratio was raised from 9.0:1 to 9.5:1 by adding slightly domed pistons; the intake cam was changed to a solid lifter design with a stronger cam; the intake runners in the head were straightened and the intake manifold was mounted higher up. Mazda's Variable Intake Control System was introduced, which effectively gave a long narrow intake manifold at low rpm for better swirl, changing to a short, free-flowing manifold at high rpm for maximum breathing. Power output of the new engine was quoted at [tpl]convert|104.4|kW|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl] with [tpl]convert|116|lbf.ft|Nm|abbr=on[/tpl] of torque.
The [tpl]convert|1.6|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] B6 engine remained available in Europe and Japan. The base-model [tpl]convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] NB could reach [tpl]convert|62|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] in 7.8 s and had a top speed of [tpl]convert|130|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl].

===MX-5 10th Anniversary Model (1999)===

In 1999, Mazda celebrated the 10th anniversary of the MX-5 with the 10th Anniversary Model, a limited edition featuring some until-then exclusive features, namely a six-speed transmission and Bilstein shock absorbers; performance figures were slightly different, with slower acceleration but higher top speed than the standard 5-speed model. The model's nickname among owners and enthusiasts was 10AM or 10AE (as in "10th Anniversary Edition"). The car had a unique sapphire blue mica (called innocent blue in Japan) paint colour with two-toned black leather and blue alcantara seats. The addition of the sixth gear resulted in different performance results, with 0–[tpl]convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl] in 7.5 seconds, a tenth of a second slower than the standard 5-speed model, due to the heavier weight. However, in spite of the 10AM's greater weight, its top rated speed was higher, at [tpl]convert|214|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl] instead of [tpl]convert|210|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl]. Combined consumption was 8.0 instead of 8.5 l/100 km (29 instead of 28 mpg).
Each car was sequentially numbered on a badge on the driver-side front quarter panel. A "Certificate of Authenticity" with the same number came with each car, signed by Mazda President James E. Miller and dated 10 February 1999. On certain markets, a gift set was also included, consisting of a 1/24 scale diecast model, two Seiko-branded wristwatches (his and hers) with matching blue faceplate and Miata logo, and metal keychain in the form of the Miata logo, all encased in a luxury blue velvet box. Despite the publicity that Mazda gave to this model, it took more than a year to sell all units, drawing criticism that too many units had been produced (another factor was the high price with an MSRP of $26,875, about $6500 more than a base model).[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] For comparison, there were 3,500 units of the NC's 3rd Generation Limited launch model in 2005, and regular limited editions produced each year do not usually exceed 1,500 units per region. The polished wheels are notorious for corroding once the thin lacquer coating is damaged.  Mazda replaced thousands of sets under warranty.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2011[/tpl] There were minor differences in specification according to the market, such as no  sports appearance package (front/side/back skirts, rear wing) or air conditioning for Europe.
7,500 units of the 10th Anniversary were produced,You and Your MX5/Miata, Liz Turner 2002, Haynes Publishing, ISBN 1-85960-847-7 with  3,700 distributed to Europe (of which: 600 - UK, 20 - Portugal), 3,150 to North America (of which 3,000 to US and 150 to Canada), 500 to Japan and 150 to Australia. Car number 7,500 was sold in the UK.

===Facelift (2001)===

For the 2001 model year, a facelift to the second-generation MX-5 was released. There were some minor exterior changes, with a press-release of July 18, 2000, announcing the changes as "resulting in an even sportier and more forceful look".  Fog lamps, previously an option, were made standard. Some cockpit elements were changed, with the instrument panel gauges receiving a white face and red numbers. The seats were also upgraded, incorporating more support in the side bolsters and taller headrests. Added for top models (designated 'Sport' in the U.K) were [tpl]convert|16|in|mm|adj=on[/tpl] wheels with 205/45VR16 low-profile tires, larger brakes at the front and rear, additional chassis stiffening braces, a limited slip differential, a 6-speed manual gearbox, Bilstein suspension and leather seats. The upgraded tires and suspension allowed the new model to pull 0.91 g in lateral grip in tests by Car and Driver magazine. The body was strengthened, gaining 16% in bending rigidity and 22% in torsional rigidity. With the minimum of options, the 2001 model weighed [tpl]convert|1065|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl].
The [tpl]convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] BP-Z3 engine was slightly modified and now featured variable valve timing on the intake camshaft. The intake and exhaust system also received a minor upgrade. These modifications resulted in a power output of [tpl]convert|113|kW|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl] (Japan, UK and Australia) or [tpl]convert|107|kW|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl] (US only). In the United States, Mazda erroneously quoted the power figure for the Japanese and Australian model in early catalogues. Car and Driver magazine and numerous owners confirmed the missing power, and Mazda offered to buy back the 2001 cars due to those misleading power claims. Owners who did not take up the buy back offer were offered an apology and free servicing for the warranty period.
2002 saw the launch of the MX5 SP. The MX-5 SP was developed and sold in Australia and its turbocharged engine produced [tpl]convert|157|kW|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl] at 6800 rpm. Only 100 of these cars were built. The SP was very expensive in comparison to a standard MX5 at the time but offered blistering performance.  It has fast become a cult classic and sought after model in Australia.
In 2003 Mazda launched a campaign to target a younger group of drivers with the introduction of the Shinsen Version (SV) Miata. The Shinsen (Japanese for "Fresh and New") provided an intermediate step between the base model and the pricier LS. Equipped with most standard features on the LS, such as cruise control and aluminum brush trim. This limited production model also shared an inverted color scheme of the same year Special Edition with a titanium silver exterior and dark blue top and interior.
Also in 2003, a division of Mazda in Japan released the Roadster Coupé, with a fixed hardtop roof. The body structure was reworked to incorporate the roof and gave a substantial increase in chassis rigidity with a weight increase of [tpl]convert|10|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl]. Production was limited to 179 units for Japan only. This was to become one of the rarest forms of the MX-5.[tpl]cite web|title=Mazda Roadster Coupe (NB8C series)|url=http://www.j-spec.com.au/wiki/Mazda/Roadster_Coupe/NB8C/id-532|accessdate=2012-10-16[/tpl]

===Mazdaspeed MX-5 (2004–2005)===

The 2004 model year saw the introduction of the official turbocharged Mazdaspeed MX-5, Roadster Turbo in Japan. It featured an IHI RHF5 VJ35 turbocharger equipped variant of the BP-4W engine that produced [tpl]Convert|180|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at 6000 rpm with a front-mounted air-to-air intercooler. The MAZDASPEED could reach [tpl]convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] in 6.2 seconds but had a top speed of only [tpl]convert|203|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on[/tpl] due to its low 6,500 rev limiter.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] With its upgraded suspension and wider tires, the Mazdaspeed model could pull over 0.98 g in lateral grip. Other features included upgraded 6-speed transmission and clutch assemblies, upgraded drivetrain components, Racing Hart [tpl]convert|17|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] alloy wheels, special interior trim. Perhaps the most obscure detail change of the MazdaSpeed overhaul of the MX-5 was the fitment of a custom, lightweight oil dipstick. The 2004 Mazdaspeed MX-5 was only available in Velocity Red Mica and Titanium Gray Metallic for the US-market and Velocity Red Mica for the Canadian-market while the 2005 model was available additionally in Lava Orange Mica and Black Mica in the US-market, with Canada receiving only Titanium Grey Mica. Of the 5,428 Mazdaspeed MX-5s produced during model years 2004 and 2005, 4,000 were produced in 2004; the 2005 production run was shortened to only 1428, due to a fire at the production facility. This model was also marketed in Australia as an MX-5 SE without any Mazdaspeed branding (exhaust tip excluded), featured 3.63 diff gears and was available in Sunlight Silver as well as Velocity Red Mica, Titanium Gray Metallic and Black Mica for 2005. It was also slightly detuned with only [tpl]Convert|121|kW|bhp|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Boost pressure was [tpl]convert|7.25|psi|bar|1|abbr=on[/tpl] for Australian model vs [tpl]convert|8.5|psi|bar|1|abbr=on[/tpl] of the North American and Japanese models which is the main contributor to the power difference. The MX-5 SE has been used for both gravel and tarmac rallying in Australia,  showing the versatility of these cars in racing.

===Technical specifications (UK)===

===Safety===

The EuroNCAP Safety Ratings for MX-5s manufactured in 2002 were given 4 out of 5 stars for adult protection but only 1 out of 4 stars for pedestrian protection.
EuroNCAP stated "This is a poor performance despite the MX-5 benefiting from not having to have the leading edge of its bonnet tested because of its low profile."

==Third generation (NC)==

Production of the third-generation MX-5, code NC, began May 17, 2005, for delivery in August, for the 2006 model year. This was partially due to the declining sales of the MX-5 during its second generation run.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl] At its introduction in 2005, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award.
The exterior styling (done by Yasushi Nakamuta until 2003) resembles the original design, but unlike the update from NA to NB, which was mostly a nose/tail/interior change, the NC shares no components with the NB, except for the side-panel turning-lights on non-US models. The lead stylist of this model generation was Moray Callum.[tpl]citation needed|date=July 2013[/tpl]
With the third generation, the suspension changed from a 4-wheel double wishbone setup to a front wishbone/rear multilink setup. Technologies like traction control and stability control were added to increase driveability. According to Car and Driver, the NC has a skidpad number of 0.90g.
For the US, the engine is the new 16-valve, [tpl]convert|2.0|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] MZR I4, producing [tpl]convert|170|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|140|lbf.ft|Nm|abbr=on[/tpl] coupled to either a 5-speed or a 6-speed manual transmission or [tpl]convert|158|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] with the optional 6-speed automatic transmission. A limited slip differential is available with the 6-speed option. In Australia the [tpl]convert|2.0|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] MZR is offered, rated at [tpl]convert|118|kW|bhp|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|188|Nm|lbf.ft|abbr=on[/tpl] and the 6-speed transmission and LSD are standard. In Europe, two engines are offered: the [tpl]convert|2.0|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] MZR rated at [tpl]convert|158|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|188|Nm|lbf.ft|abbr=on[/tpl], coupled to the 6-speed manual transmission; and a new [tpl]convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] MZR, rated at [tpl]convert|126|bhp|kW|abbr=on[/tpl] and [tpl]convert|167|Nm|lbf.ft|abbr=on[/tpl], coupled to the 5-speed manual transmission.
A six-speed automatic transmission, with steering wheel mounted paddle shifters, is optional. A test by Car and Driver magazine revealed a 0-[tpl]convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] time of 6.5 s for the [tpl]convert|2.0|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl] U.S.-spec NC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/roadtests/9968/mazda-mx-5-page3.html |title=Mazda MX-5's Performance Statistics as Measured by Car and Driver |accessdate=2007-02-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070926222220/http://www.caranddriver.com/roadtests/9968/mazda-mx-5-page3.html  |archivedate = 2007-09-26[/tpl] Manufacturer figures for the European-spec model are: 0-[tpl]convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl] in 9.4 s ([tpl]convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl]) and 7.9 s ([tpl]convert|2.0|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl]). In Japan, this generation no longer complies with Japanese government regulations concerning vehicle exterior dimensions, and buyers in Japan are now liable for additional costs for ownership.
The NC was launched with a special edition called "3rd Generation Limited" which featured added chrome accents and special wheels. 3500 were built worldwide (300 in the UK, 750 in the US, 150 in Canada), delivered in advance of standard models.
In July 2006, Mazda debuted a coupé convertible version of the NC with a three-piece folding hardtop, named "MX-5 Roadster Coupe" in Europe, "Roadster Power Retractable Hard Top" in Japan, and "MX-5 Miata Power Retractable Hard Top" in Canada and the US. The hardtop adds [tpl]convert|36|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] to the weight of a comparably equipped soft top, without diminishing trunk space when retracted. Constructed of polycarbonate,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061009/FREE/61003001/1004|title=2007 Mazda MX-5 Miata Power Retractable Hardtop |accessdate=6 March 2011 |publisher=Autoweek |first=Mark |last=Vaughn|date=10 September 2006[/tpl] the top requires 12 seconds to raise or lower, and the first models were delivered to customers in late August 2006. Performance times are slightly affected with the weight increase, to 9.6 s ([tpl]convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl]) and 8.2 s ([tpl]convert|2.0|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl]) from 0-[tpl]convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl], but top speed is increased from 196 km/h (121.8 mph) to 200 km/h (124.3 mph) ([tpl]convert|1.8|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl]) and from [tpl]convert|210|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|215|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl] ([tpl]convert|2.0|L|cuin|abbr=on[/tpl]), for the European-spec model.
For 2008, Mazda released a Special Edition MX-5 in Icy Blue exterior, with exclusive Dark Saddle Brown folding top, with matching leather with blue stitching steering wheel, seats, and hand brake. The Special Edition also featured a silver-accented shift knob, dark-silver finished instrument panel with chrome accents, special [tpl]convert|17|in|mm|abbr=on[/tpl] alloy wheels, stainless steel MX-5 scuff plate, and chrome front headlight bezel, as well as grille and fog lamp surrounds. The 2008 Special Edition was limited to 105 PRHT-equipped units in Canada and 750 soft-top units in the US.

Major changes concern the restyled front which now incorporates elements from Mazda’s newer models like the larger grille and new head and fog lights. Further restyled elements are the side skirts, rear bumper and the tail lights. The soft-top Touring and Grand Touring models feature a mesh grille bordered by a chrome frame.  The hardtop Roadster Coupe now features a mesh grille bordered by a chrome frame and chrome elements inside the headlamps and outer door handles.
The instrument panel gained darker features and redesigned graphics for the gauges. To create more leg space in the cabin, a protrusion from the door pockets was eliminated.
The 2.0-litre engine was rated [tpl]convert|167|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at 7,200 rpm and [tpl]convert|140|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at 5,000 rpm for 5-speed manual, [tpl]convert|158|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at 6,700 rpm and [tpl]convert|140|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] at 5,000 rpm for automatic.
