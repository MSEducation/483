[[War rape]]

CATEGORIES: War rape, War casualties, War crimes

War rapes are rapes committed by combatants during armed conflict or war, or during military occupation often as spoils of war; but sometimes, particularly in ethnic conflict, the phenomenon has broader sociological motives. It is distinguished from sexual assaults and rape committed amongst troops in military service."30% of Women in USA Military Raped Whilst Serving by Fellow Soldiers"[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Benedict |first=Helen |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103844570 |title="The Nation: The Plight of Women Soldiers" |publisher=Npr.org |date=2009-05-06 |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Benedict |first=Helen |url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3848/ |title="Why Soldiers Rape – Culture of misogyny, illegal occupation, fuel sexual violence in military" |publisher=Inthesetimes.com |date=2008-08-13 |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl] It also covers the situation where girls and women are forced into prostitution or sexual slavery by an occupying power.
During war and armed conflict, rape is frequently used as a means of psychological warfare in order to humiliate the enemy. War rape is often systematic and thorough. War rape may occur in a variety of situations, including institutionalised sexual slavery, war rapes associated with specific battles or massacres, and individual or isolated acts of sexual violence. War rape may also include gang rape and rape with objects.
Rape is also now recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group; however, rape remains widespread in conflict zones. There are other international legal instruments to prosecute perpetrators but this has occurred as late as the 1990s.[tpl]cn|date=April 2014[/tpl] However, these legal instruments have so far only been used for international conflicts, thus putting the burden of proof in citing the international nature of conflict in order for prosecution to proceed.

Susan Brownmiller was the first historian to attempt an overview of rape in war with documentation and theory. Brownmiller's thesis is that "War provides men with the perfect psychological backdrop to give vent to their contempt for women. The maleness of the military—the brute power of weaponry exclusive to their hands, the spiritual bonding of men at arms, the manly discipline of orders given and orders obeyed, the simple logic of the hierarchical command—confirms for men what they long suspect—that women are peripheral to the world that counts." She writes that rape accompanies territorial advance by the winning side in land conflicts as one of the spoils of war, and that "Men who rape are ordinary Joes, made unordinary by entry into the most exclusive male-only club in the world."

Kelly Dawn Askin observes that increasingly, the victims of war are civilians. An estimated forty-five million plus civilians died during World War II. Male and female civilians may be subject to torture, but many studies show that war rape is more frequently perpetrated on women than men.[tpl]cite book |last= Askin |first=Kelly Dawn |title= War Crimes Against Women: Prosecution in International War Crimes Tribunals |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ThfzGvSvQ2UC |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=90-411-0486-0 |pages= 12–13 |year=1997[/tpl][tpl]cite web |last1=Thomas |first1=Dorothy Q.|last2=Reagan |first2=E.

A 2010 Journal of the American Medical Association survey found that 22% of men and 30% of women in Eastern Congo had reported sexual violence connected to warfare. Perpetrators of sexual violence against women and children "commonly include not only enemy civilians and troops but also allied and national civilians and even comrades in arms."
The victims of war rape are usually "civilians", a category first recognized in the 19th century.[tpl]cite book |last= Askin |first=Kelly Dawn |title= War Crimes Against Women: Prosecution in International War Crimes Tribunals |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ThfzGvSvQ2UC |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=90-411-0486-0 |pages= 26–27 |year=1997[/tpl] Although war rape of women is documented throughout history, laws protecting civilians in armed conflict have tended not to recognise sexual assault on women. Even when laws of war have recognised and forbidden sexual assault, few prosecutions have been brought. According to Kelly Dawn Askin, the laws of war perpetuated the attitude that sexual assaults against women are less significant crimes, not worthy of prosecution.[tpl]cite book |last= Askin |first=Kelly Dawn |title= War Crimes Against Women: Prosecution in International War Crimes Tribunals |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ThfzGvSvQ2UC |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=90-411-0486-0 |page=13 |year=1997[/tpl] War rape has until recently been a hidden element of war, which according to Human Rights Watch is linked to the largely gender-specific character of war rape – abuse committed by men against women. This gender-specific character has contributed to war rape being "narrowly portrayed as sexual or personal in nature, a portrayal that depoliticizes sexual abuse in conflict and results in its being ignored as a war crime."
"To the victor go the spoils" has been a war cry for centuries, and women classed as part of the spoils of war.[tpl]cite book |last= Askin |first=Kelly Dawn |title= War Crimes Against Women: Prosecution in International War Crimes Tribunals |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ThfzGvSvQ2UC |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=90-411-0486-0 |pages=10–21 |year=1997[/tpl] Furthermore, war rape has been downplayed as an unfortunate but inevitable side effect of sending men to war. Also, war rape has in the past been regarded as tangible reward to soldiers (which were only paid irregularly), and as a soldier's proof of masculinity and success.[tpl]cite book |last= Askin |first=Kelly Dawn |title= War Crimes Against Women: Prosecution in International War Crimes Tribunals |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ThfzGvSvQ2UC |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=90-411-0486-0 |page=27 |year=1997[/tpl] In reference to war rape in ancient times, Harold Washington argues that warfare itself is imaged as rape, and that the cities attacked are its victims. He argues that war rape occurs in the context of stereotypes about women and men, which are part of the basic belief that violent power belongs to men, and that women are its victims.[tpl]cite book |last= Levinson |first=Bernard M |title= Gender and Law in the Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East |url=http://books.google.com/?id=2rZnXQwPX8gC&dq=rape+in+warfare+ancient |page= 20 |year=2004 |isbn= 978-0-567-08098-1[/tpl]
The rape of men by other men is also common in war. A 2009 study by Lara Stemple[tpl]cite journal|last=Stemple|first=Lara|title=Male Rape and Human Rights|journal=Hastings Law Journal|date=February 2009|volume=60|issue=3|page=605|url=http://uchastings.edu/hlj/archive/vol60/Stemple_60-HLJ-605.pdf|accessdate=17 July 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] found that it had been documented in conflicts worldwide; for example, 76% of male political prisoners in 1980s El Salvador and 80% of concentration camp inmates in Sarajevo reported being raped or sexually tortured. Stemple concludes that the "lack of attention to sexual abuse of men during conflict is particularly troubling given the widespread reach of the problem".[tpl]cite news|last=Storr|first=Will|title=The rape of men|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/17/the-rape-of-men|accessdate=17 July 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 July 2011|location=London[/tpl]Stemple, p. 612. Mervyn Christian of Johns Hopkins School of Nursing has found that male rape is commonly underreported."Rape as a 'weapon of war' against men." IRIN, 13 October 2011.

===Rape of men===

According to a survey published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2010, 30% of women and 22% of men from the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported that they had been subject to conflict-related sexual violence.[tpl]Cite journal |journal=The Guardian |location=London |year=2011 |title=The rape of men. The darkest secret of war |url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/17/the-rape-of-men [/tpl] Similarly, a 2009 study by Lara Stemple noted that sexual torture and rape were experienced by 76% of male political prisoners in El Salvador during the Salvadoran Civil War, as well as by 80% of male concentration camp inmates in Sarajevo during the Bosnian War.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Stemple |first=Lara |year=2009 |title=Male Rape and Human Rights |journal=Hastings Law Journal |issue=60 |volume=3 |page=605 [/tpl] Despite the popular perception that rape during conflict is primarily targeted against women, these figures show that sexual violence committed against men is not a marginal occurrence. The lack of awareness for the magnitude of the rape of men during conflict relates to chronic underreporting. Although the physical and psychological repercussions from rape are similar for women and men, male victims tend to demonstrate an even greater reluctance to report their suffering to their families or the authorities.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/93960/health-rape-as-a-weapon-of-war-against-men |title=IRIN Africa | HEALTH: Rape as a “weapon of war” against men | DRC | South Sudan | Children | Gender Issues | Health & Nutrition | Human Rights |publisher=Irinnews.org |date=2011-10-13 |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl] Correspondingly, acknowledgement of the rape of men by non-governmental organizations or political bodies, as well as media coverage on the matter, remains insufficient.
The chronic underreporting relates to a particularly harsh stigmatization of male rape victims. This phenomenon is captured well in the following excerpt from The Guardian: “Both perpetrator and victim enter a conspiracy of silence and why male survivors often find, once their story is discovered, that they lose the support and comfort of those around them. In the patriarchal societies found in many developing countries, gender roles are strictly defined. … Often, … wives who discover their husbands have been raped decide to leave them. "They ask me: 'So now how am I going to live with him? As what? Is this still a husband? Is it a wife?' They ask, 'If he can be raped, who is protecting me?'”.
Gender roles within social hierarchies are concerned with the question of agency in the conduct of physical violence. Men are expected to exert violence, while women are victimized by it. In conflict situations, rape against men dissolve this relationship and put men in the ‘receiving’ role of the victim. Similarly, the ‘penetrating’ role of men as opposed to the ‘receiving’ role of women in (conventional) sexual intercourse illustrates this constructed power relationship. Hence, male rape victims experience the worst possible ‘humiliation’ with regards to the ingrained social roles they are traditionally expected to fulfill. Moreover, their stigmatization takes on particularly severe dimensions within conservative social environments in which homosexual intercourse – regardless of consent – is punished harshly. For example, Ugandan male rape victims explain their choice to not speak out with the fear of being branded homosexuals.[tpl]cite web|author=Grace Natabaalo |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/04/2013411111517944475.html |title=Male rape survivors fight stigma in Uganda - Features |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl] As homosexuality is widely condemned in Uganda, male victims of sexual violence often struggle to get proper support because they are accused of being gay. In certain cases, gender roles concerning violence and sexual conduct are so deeply ingrained that the mere existence of male rape is not being believed in.

==Law==

Within the 20th century, legal mechanisms have been drawn up to deal with prosecution of perpetrators of war rape. Similarly, individual states have laws pertaining to war rape's victims and perpetrators.
Prosecution of rapists in war crime tribunals is a recent development. Generally, humanitarian law concerns the maltreatment of civilians and "any devastation not justified by military necessity".Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, Stéphane Courtois, The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression, Harvard University Press, 1999, hardcover, 858 pages, ISBN 0-674-07608-7, page 5. War rape has rarely been prosecuted as a war crime. After World War II, the Nuremberg Tribunals failed to charge Nazi war criminals with rape, although witnesses testified on war rape. The War Crimes Tribunal in Tokyo did convict Japanese officers "of failing to prevent rape" in the Nanking massacre, which is known as the "Rape of Nanking".[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/specials/bosnia/context/0628warcrimes-tribunal.html| last = Simons | first = Marlise | title = For first time, Court Defines Rape as War Crime| work =The New York Times |date=June 1996[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E3DD133AF936A35757C0A96E958260| last = Rosenberg | first = Tine | title = Editorial Observer; New punishment for an ancient war crime| work =The New York Times |date=April 1998[/tpl] Justice Richard Goldstone, chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, said that "Rape has never been the concern of the international community." The United Nations Declaration on the Protection of Women and Children in Emergency and Armed Conflict, which went into effect in 1974, does not mention rape specifically.
The United States has a ban on abortion attached to its humanitarian aid for war victims, with no exceptions for rape, incest, and/or to save the life of the mother.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.awid.org/Library/UN-Security-Council-Takes-a-Historic-Stand-Supporting-Abortion-Access-for-Women-Raped-in-War |title=UN Security Council Takes a Historic Stand Supporting Abortion Access for Women Raped in War / Library / Homepage |publisher=AWID |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02[/tpl]

===Customs of war===

Some scholars argue that the lack of explicit recognition of war rape in international law or applicable humanitarian law may not be used as a defense by the perpetrator of war rape. Laws and customs of war prohibit offenses such as "inhuman treatment" or "indecent assaults", adding to this domestic military codes and domestic civil codes (national law) may make sexual assault a crime.[tpl]cite book |last= Askin |first=Kelly Dawn |title= War Crimes Against Women: Prosecution in International War Crimes Tribunals |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ThfzGvSvQ2UC |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=90-411-0486-0 |page= 17 |year=1997[/tpl]

===Humanitarian law prior to World War II===

One of the first references to the "laws of war", or "traditions of war" was by Cicero, who urged soldiers to observe the rules of war, since obeying the regulations separated the "men" from the "brutes". Conquering the riches and property of an enemy was regarded as legitimate reason for war in itself. Women were included with "property", since they were considered under the lawful ownership of a man, whether a father, husband, slave master, or guardian. In this context, the rape of a woman was considered a property crime committed against the man who owned the woman.
The ancient Greeks considered war rape of women "socially acceptable behaviour well within the rules of warfare", and warriors considered the conquered women "legitimate booty, useful as wives, concubines, slave labor or battle-camp trophy".
In the Middle Ages, and until the 19th century, this attitude and practice prevailed, and the legal protection of women in war time related directly to the legal protection women were granted in peace times. In medieval Europe, women were considered as an inferior gender by law.[tpl]cite book |last= Askin |first=Kelly Dawn |title= War Crimes Against Women: Prosecution in International War Crimes Tribunals |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ThfzGvSvQ2UC |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=90-411-0486-0 |pages= 23–24 |year=1997[/tpl] Catholic Church sought to prevent rape during feudal warfare through the institution of Peace and Truce of God which discouraged soldiers from attacking women and civilians in general and through the propagation of a Christianized version of chivalry ideal of a knight who protected innocents and did not engage in lawlessness.
According to Fadl, Medieval Islamic military jurisprudence laid down severe penalties for those who committed rape.[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2012[/tpl] The punishment for such crimes were severe, including death, regardless of the political convictions and religion of the perpetrator.Abou El Fadl, Khaled (2001). Commentary: Terrorism Is at Odds With Islamic Tradition. LA Times. Retrieved 11 July 2011
In 1159, John of Salisbury wrote Policraticus in an attempt to regulate the conduct of armies engaged in "justifiable" wars. Salisbury believed that acts of theft and "rapine" (property crimes) should receive the most severe punishment, but also believed that obeying a superior's commands whether legal or illegal, moral or immoral, was the ultimate duty of the soldier.[tpl]cite book |last= Askin |first=Kelly Dawn |title= War Crimes Against Women: Prosecution in International War Crimes Tribunals |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ThfzGvSvQ2UC |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=90-411-0486-0 |pages= 24–25 |year=1997[/tpl]
In the 15th and 16th century, despite considerations and systemisation of the laws of war, women remained objects available to the conquering male in any way whatsoever. The influential writer Francisco de Vitoria stood for a gradual emergence of the notion that glory or conquest were not necessarily acceptable reasons to start a war. The jurist Alberico Gentili insisted that all women, including female combatants, should be spared from sexual assault in wartime. However, in practice war rape was common.
It is suggested that one reason for the prevalence of war rape was that at the time, military circles supported the notion that all persons, including unarmed women and children, were still the enemy, with the belligerent having conquering rights over them. In the late Middle Ages, the laws of war even considered war rape as an indication of a man's success in the battlefield and "opportunities to rape and loot were among the few advantages open to... soldiers, who were paid with great irregularity by their leaders....triumph over women by rape became a way to measure victory, part of a soldier's proof of masculinity and success, a tangible reward for services rendered....an actual reward of war".
During this period in history, war rape took place not necessarily as a conscious effort of war to terrorize the enemy, but rather as earned compensation for winning a war. There is little evidence to suggest that superiors regularly ordered subordinates to commit acts of rape.[tpl]cite book |last= Askin |first=Kelly Dawn |title= War Crimes Against Women: Prosecution in International War Crimes Tribunals |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ThfzGvSvQ2UC |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=90-411-0486-0 |page= 28 |year=1997[/tpl] Throughout this period of history war became more regulated, specific, and regimented. The first formal prosecution for violations of war crimes did not take place until the late Middle Ages.
Hugo Grotius, considered the father of the law of nations and the first to conduct a comprehensive work on systematizing the international laws of war, concluded that rape "should not go unpunished in war any more than in peace". Emmerich van Vattel emerged as an influential figure when he pleaded for the immunity of civilians against the ravages of war, considering men and women civilians as non-combatants.[tpl]cite book |last= Askin |first=Kelly Dawn |title= War Crimes Against Women: Prosecution in International War Crimes Tribunals |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ThfzGvSvQ2UC |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=90-411-0486-0 |pages= 30–32 |year=1997[/tpl]
In the late 18th century and 19th century, treaties and war codes started to include vague provisions for the protection of women: The Treaty of Amity and Commerce (1785) specified that in case of war "women and children....shall not be molested in their persons". Article 20 of the Order No. 20 (1847), a supplement to the US Rules and Articles of war, listed the following as severely punishable "Assassination, murder, malicious stabbing or maiming, rape". The Declaration of Brussels (1874) stated that the "honours and rights of the family....should be respected".[tpl]cite book |last= Askin |first=Kelly Dawn |title= War Crimes Against Women: Prosecution in International War Crimes Tribunals |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ThfzGvSvQ2UC |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=90-411-0486-0 |page=34 |year=1997[/tpl]
In the 19th century, the treatment of soldiers, prisoners, the wounded, and civilians improved and core elements of the laws of war were put in place.[tpl]By whom|date=December 2009[/tpl] However, while the customs of war mandated more humane treatment of soldiers and civilians, new weapons and advanced technology increased destruction and altered the methods of war.[tpl]cite book |last= Askin |first=Kelly Dawn |title= War Crimes Against Women: Prosecution in International War Crimes Tribunals |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ThfzGvSvQ2UC |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=90-411-0486-0 |page=33 |year=1997[/tpl] The Lieber Code (1863) was the first codification of the international customary laws of land war and an important step towards humanitarian law. The Lieber Code emphasises protection of civilians and states that "all rape...(is) prohibited under the penalty of death", which was the first prohibition of rape in customary humanitarian law.[tpl]cite book |last= Askin |first=Kelly Dawn |title= War Crimes Against Women: Prosecution in International War Crimes Tribunals |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ThfzGvSvQ2UC |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=90-411-0486-0 |pages=35–36 |year=1997 [/tpl] After World War I, the Commission of Responsibilities, set up in 1919 to examine the atrocities committed by the German Empire and the other Central Powers during World War I, found substantial evidence of sexual violence and subsequently included rape and forced prostitution among the violations of the laws and customs of war.

===The Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals===

After World War II, the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals became the first international criminal tribunals of real significance. The victorious powers established them in 1945 and 1946 respectively to prosecute the major war criminals of the European Axis countries (in fact only Germans) and of Japan for "crimes against peace," war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The possibility of prosecuting sexual violence as a war crime was present because of the recognition of war rape as serious violation of the laws of war in the Lieber Code and the Hague Convention assertion that "family honour and rights...must be respected".
Also, there was evidence that previous war crimes trials had prosecuted for sex crimes, hence war rape could have been prosecuted under customary law and/or under the IMT (International Military Tribunals) Charter's Article 6(b): "abduction of the civilian population....into slavery and for other purposes" and "abduction unjustified by military necessity". Similarly, it would have been possible to prosecute war rape as crime against humanity under Article 6(c) of the Nuremberg Charter: "other inhumane acts" and "enslavement". However, notwithstanding evidence of sexual violence in Europe during World War II a lack of will led to rape and sexual violence not being prosecuted at the Nuremberg Tribunals.[tpl]cite book |last= de Brouwer |first=Anne-Marie |title= Supranational Criminal Prosecution of Sexual Violence |url=http://books.google.com/?id=JhY8ROsA39kC&dq=war+rape+in+ancient+times |publisher=Intersentia |isbn=90-5095-533-9 |pages=5–7 |year=2005 [/tpl]
The War Crimes Tribunal in Tokyo prosecuted cases of sexual violence and war rape as war crimes under the wording "inhumane treatment", "ill-treatment," and "failure to respect family honour and rights." According to the Prosecution in excess of 20,000 women and girls were raped during the first weeks of the Japanese occupation of the Chinese city of Nanking. The War Crimes Tribunal in Tokyo included accounts of sexual violence crimes in the trial testimonies as well as public records.[tpl]cite book |last= de Brouwer |first=Anne-Marie |title= Supranational Criminal Prosecution of Sexual Violence |url=http://books.google.com/?id=JhY8ROsA39kC&dq=war+rape+in+ancient+times |publisher=Intersentia |isbn=90-5095-533-9 |page=8 |year=2005 [/tpl] On a national level, a commander of the 14th Area Army, General Yamashita, was convicted for, inter alia, "rape under his command." Some 35 Dutch comfort women brought a successful case before the Batavia Military Tribunal in 1948.

===Geneva Conventions===

Since 1949 Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention explicitly prohibits wartime rape and enforced prostitution. These prohibitions were reinforced by the 1977 Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions.

===Genocide===

In 1998 the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda established by the United Nations made landmark decisions defining rape as a crime of genocide under international law. The trial of Jean-Paul Akayesu, the mayor of Taba Commune in Rwanda, established precedents that rape is an element of the crime of genocide. The Trial Chamber held that "sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the Tutsi ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only, manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide."http://69.94.11.53/ENGLISH/annualreports/a54/9925571e.htm
Judge Navanethem Pillay, now the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement after the verdict: "From time immemorial, rape has been regarded as spoils of war. Now it will be considered a war crime. We want to send out a strong message that rape is no longer a trophy of war."Navanethem Pillay is quoted by Professor Paul Walters in his presentation of her honorary doctorate of law, Rhodes University, April 2005 http://www.ru.ac.za/academic/graduation/addresses_and_citations/2005/Judge_Pillay_citation.doc[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] An estimated 500,000 women were raped during the 1994 Rwandan Genocide.http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/Worldswomen/WW2010%20Report_by%20chapter%28pdf%29/violence%20against%20women.pdf
Professor Paul Walters in his April 2005 statement of support of her honorary doctorate of law at Rhodes University wrote:
 
 Under her presidency of the Rwanda Tribunal, that body rendered a judgment against the mayor of Taba Commune which found him guilty of genocide for the use of rape in "the destruction of the spirit, of the will to live, and of life itself."

The Akayesu judgement includes the first interpretation and application by an international court of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The Trial Chamber held that rape (which it defined as "a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive") and sexual assault constitute acts of genocide insofar as they were committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group, as such.  It found that sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the Tutsi ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only, manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide.
In September 1999 the United Nations published a "Report of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994". The report states that on 2 September 1998, Trial Chamber I of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judges Laïty Kama, Presiding, Lennart Aspegren and Navanethem Pillay, found Jean Paul Akayesu guilty of 9 of the 15 counts proffered against him, including genocide, direct and public incitement to commit genocide and crimes against humanity, murder, torture, rape, and other inhumane acts. The Tribunal found Jean Paul Akayesu not guilty of the six remaining counts, including the count of complicity in genocide and the counts relating to violations of article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions and of Additional Protocol II thereto. On 2 October 1998, Jean Paul Akayesu was sentenced to life imprisonment for each of the nine counts, the sentences to run concurrently. Both Jean Paul Akayesu and the Prosecutor have appealed against the judgement rendered by the Trial Chamber.

===Crimes against humanity and war crimes===

The Rome Statute Explanatory Memorandum, which defines the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, recognises rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, "or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity" as crime against humanity if the action is part of a widespread or systematic practice.As quoted by Guy Horton in Dying Alive – A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation. See section "12.52 Crimes against humanity", Page 201.

Rape first became recognised as crime against humanity when the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia issued arrest warrants based on the Geneva Conventions and Violations of the Laws or Customs of War. Specifically, it was recognised that Muslim women in Foča (southeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina) were subjected to systematic and widespread gang rape, torture and sexual enslavement by Bosnian Serb soldiers, policemen, and members of paramilitary groups after the takeover of the city in April 1992.Rape as a Crime Against Humanity[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] The indictment was of major legal significance and was the first time that sexual assaults were investigated for the purpose of prosecution under the rubric of torture and enslavement as a crime against humanity. The indictment was confirmed by a 2001 verdict by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia that rape and sexual enslavement are crimes against humanity. This ruling challenged the widespread acceptance of rape and sexual enslavement of women as intrinsic part of war.Bosnia-Herzegovina : Foca verdict – rape and sexual enslavement are crimes against humanity. 22 February 2001. Amnesty International. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia found three Bosnian Serb men guilty of rape of Bosniac (Bosnian Muslim) women and girls (some as young as 12 and 15 years of age), in Foča, eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. Furthermore two of the men were found guilty of the crime against humanity of sexual enslavement for holding women and girls captive in a number of de facto detention centres. Many of the women subsequently disappeared.
In 2008 the U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 1820, which noted that "rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sc9364.doc.htm |title=SECURITY COUNCIL DEMANDS IMMEDIATE AND COMPLETE HALT TO ACTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AGAINST CIVILIANS IN CONFLICT ZONES, UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTING RESOLUTION 1820 (2008) |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=9 November 2012[/tpl]

===U.N. resolutions on war rape===

In 2008 the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 1820, which noted that "rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide".
In 2013 the U.N. Security Council adopted its broadest resolution yet on rape in war, demanding the complete and immediate end of all acts of sexual violence by all parties to armed conflict. The resolution noted that sexual violence can constitute a crime against humanity and a contributing act to genocide, called for improved monitoring of sexual violence in conflict, and urged the U.N. and donors to assist survivors.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/24/angelina-jolie-unhcr-envoy_n_3491103.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Angelina Jolie Urges World To End Rape In War | date=24 June 2013[/tpl]
Also in 2013, the U.N. Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 2122, which supported abortion rights for girls and women raped in wars, "noting the need for access to the full range of sexual and reproductive health services, including regarding pregnancies resulting from rape, without discrimination." United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon had recommended to the U.N. Security Council earlier in 2013 (in September) that girls and women raped in war should have access to "services for safe termination of pregnancies resulting from rape, without discrimination and in accordance with international human rights and humanitarian law." In March 2013 Ban Ki-moon had also recommended to the Council that women raped in war have access to abortion services.

==Definition of rape==

Some commentators[tpl]Which|date=December 2009[/tpl] use the terms "rape" and "sexual assault" interchangeably. There is no universally accepted definition of "war rape".
The Explanatory Note of the Rome Statute, which binds the International Criminal Court, defines the "rape" as follows:
and
The concept of "invasion" is intended to be broad enough to be gender-neutral and the definition is understood to include situations where the victim may be incapable of giving genuine consent if affected by natural, induced or age-related incapacity.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.viol-tactique-de-guerre.org/documents/IMG/pdf/advocacy_paper.pdf |format=PDF |last=Minzoni – Deroche |first=Angela |title=Rape as a tactic of war – Advocacy Paper |publisher=Caritas France |date=November 2005 [/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=November 2013[/tpl]

==Effects==

Effect is a change or consequence, something brought out as a result of an action.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/effects |title=effects - definition of effects by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02[/tpl] This section aims to discuss the various results of war rape on the emotional, phycological and physical conditions of a person subjected to rape and war rape in particular.

===Physical effects===

A recent study lists the physical injury to the victims of war rape as traumatic injuries, sexually transmitted diseases, maternal mortality, un-wanted pregnancies, un-safe abortions, and persisten gynecological problems are of major concern.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.conflictandhealth.com/content/7/1/16 |title=Full text | Sexual and gender-based violence in areas of armed conflict: a systematic review of mental health and psychosocial support interventions |publisher=Conflict and Health |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl] Because war rapes take place in zones of conflict, access to emergency contraception, antibiotics, and/or abortion are limited. Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is not uncommon. In certain war gang rape instances, the objective of infecting  women interned in rape camps was the systematic effect of HIV soldiers specifically selected to spread HIV Aids to the gang-raped.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.womenundersiegeproject.org/conflicts/profile/rwanda |title=Rwanda |publisher=Women Under Siege Project |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02[/tpl]
War rape may include physical rape of the male organ. Gang rape and rape with human objects or physical objects, such as fists, sticks, rods, and gun barrels are also methods used in war rape. Women victims may suffer from incontinence and vaginal fistula as a result of these particularly violent instances of rape. Vaginal fistula is a medical condition of viginal abnormality where there is hole in the vagina in close proximity to the colon (anus or rectum) or bladder.vaginal-fistula.  In some cases, it is birth defect, in others it is a result of female genital cuttinghttp://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/ (FGM) and rape. In extreme instances of violent rape in war, the walls of the vagina are torn or punctured, resulting in severe pain and debilitating incontinence (urinary complications) and bowl containment. Violent rape is also a cause of obstetric fistula which is a hole in the female organ and birth canal.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/obstetric_fistula/en/ |title=WHO | 10 facts on obstetric fistula |publisher=Who.int |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2013-12-02[/tpl]
Physical effects may also include bone breakage such back-breaking and cranial cracks, causing future disability, visual and hearing impairment, and mental incapacitation.

===Psychological effects===

Victims and survivors of war rape are at very high risk of  psycho-social problems.[tpl]cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/protect/PROTECTION/3f696bcc4.pdf |title=Sexual and Gender-Based Violence against Refugees, Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons. Guidelines for Prevention and Response, UNHCR (SGVB Guidelines) |publisher=UNHCR |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl]
The short-term psychological injuries to the victims include feelings of fear, helplessness, sadness, disorientation, isolation, vulnerability, and desperation. If left untreated, the psychological effects of sexual assault and rape can be devastating, sometimes even deadly. Causes of death as the result of sexual violence include suicide and murder. Murder of sexual assault and rape victims may be perpetrated by the rapist or as part of an honor killing by family members of the victim.
Long-term psychological injuries may include depression, anxiety disorders (including post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSS)), multiple somatic symptoms, flashbacks, on-going trauma, chronic insomnia, self-hate, nightmares, paranoia, difficulty re-establishing intimate relationships, shame, disgust, anger, and persistent fears.[tpl]cite web|url=http://apha.confex.com/apha/133am/techprogram/paper_108859.htm |title=War, rape and genocide: From ancient times to the Sudan |publisher=Apha.confex.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl] She or he could have trouble sleeping, experience changes in their appetite, or develop full-blown emotional problems, including posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, substance abuse, or dependence. Individuals who have experienced sexual assault are at risk for other day-to-day problems, including arguing with family members and having problems at work. Lack of medical psychological support resources also puts victims of war rape at further disadvantage.http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ijps/article/viewFile/5755/6360  Refugee women are also at a disadvantage of receiving adequate assistance to deal with the psychological consequences of war rape - not only do they lack legal representation, the also may lack protection from the perpetrators of the violent act. Furthermore, there is an increase in dislike of refugees and asylum seekers which is another obstacle in the psychological healing process of victims seeking assistance outside of their countries that may still be under civil strife.ibid. Psychological support and counseling sessions given by individuals not part of the ethnic, linguistic, and/or community may insight difficulties in communication between patient and care giver. As a result, adequate emotional and psychological support to the victims is not fully developed, affecting the long-term healing potential for the patient.

===Psychosocial and societal effects===

In addition to the physical and psychological damages resulting from rape, sexual violence in the context of war often disrupt the linkages between the rape victims and their communities. Thus, the phenomenon of war rape can structurally affect entire societies, which is closely linked to the logic underlying the strategic use of rape as an instrument in armed conflicts. Raping ‘enemy’ women does also constitute an act of abuse and humiliation against the men of the community the victims were representative of.Inger Skjelsbaek: "Victim Survivor: Narrated Social Identities of Women Who Experienced Rape During the War in Bosnia-Herzegovina", Feminism & Psychology, 16/4, pp. 373–403, 387.
Besides the psychosocial effects on women as the most frequent victims of wartime rape, children born out of rape are faced with distinct social stigmata. The existence of taboos around the issue of war rape can also be an obstacle to post-conflict reconciliation.
Psychosocial consequences[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ijps/article/view/5755 |title=The Nature and Psychosocial Consequences of War Rape for Individuals and Communities | Hagen | International Journal of Psychological Studies |publisher=Ccsenet.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl] of war rape describe how the linkages between victims and the society are altered as a result of sexual abuses during war. Both during and even more in the aftermath of conflict, when abuses become known, victims of war rape risk to find themselves in situations of social isolation, often abandoned by their husbands and rejected by their communitiesJeanne Ward, Mendy Marsh: "Sexual Violence Against Women and Girls in War and Its Aftermath: Realities, Responses, and Required Resources", paper prepared for the Symposium on Sexual Violenc in Conflict and Beyond, 21–23 June 2006, Brussels, p. 9. The ordeal is thus not over with the survival of the act of abuse but has a long-term effect that can only to a limited extent be dealt with by the victim itself. The process of re-victimization captures how victims of sexual violence continue to “receive additional hurt after the direct cause of victimization has disappeared”David Bloomfield, Teresa Barnes, Luc Huyse: "Reconcilisation After Violent Conflict. A Handbook", International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, 2003, p. 61. with stigmatization and exclusion being among the main sources of re-victimization.
This is particularly relevant in patriarchal societies, where female sexuality is linked to male honour, virginity is a core value, and where a culture considers ethnicity transmitted through male genes.Cassandra Clifford: "Rape as a Weapon of War and it's Long-term Effects on Victims and Society", paper presented at the 7th Global Conference on Violence and the Contexts of Hostility, 5–7 May 2008, Budapest, p. 7.Bülent Diken, Carsten Bagge Lautsen: "Becoming Abject: Rape as a Weapon of War", Body and Society 11/1, 111-128, p. 115.  Given the ethnic dimension of sexuality, rape can become a means of ethnic cleansing or genocide, as has been claimed in relation to systematic instances or rape in Rwanda and Bosnia.Sherrie L. Russel-Brown: "Rape as an Act of Genocide", Berkeley Journal of International Law, 21/2, 2003, pp. 350-374.  In this context, “rape as a weapon of war is not an individual issue, but a societal one.”p. 4. In a number of countries, the targeted infection of women with the HI-Virus in this context adds another dimension, with women having to face not only the gendered consequences of war rape but also the general stigma pertaining to people suffering from HIV/AIDS.[tpl]cite web|url=http://unu.edu/publications/articles/rape-and-hiv-as-weapons-of-war.html |title=Rape and HIV as Weapons of War - United Nations University |publisher=Unu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl]
War rape can have an equally strong and long-term effect on the children that are born as a result of rape. On the one hand, these children may not be immediately identified and might find out about their origins only at a late point in their life. In turn, if the children themselves but even more their environment knows about the 'war babies',Charli Carpenter: "War's Impact on Children Born of Rape and Sexual Exploitation: Physical, Economic and Psychosocial Dimensions", University of Pittsburg they risk being regarded as 'other' by the communities they are born into. Recurring patterns in countries including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Uganda, Sierra Leone and Rwanda show how children born of war rape and to mothers who don't want them have to face struggles with regard to issues related to identity - both in an administrative as well as in a personal way - and are sometimes restricted in the enjoyment of their rights to education, non-discrimination and even physical security.Joana Daniel-Wrabetz: "Children Born of War Rape in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Convention on the Rights of the Child", in Charli Carpenter (Ed.): Born of War: Protecting Children of Sexual Violence Survivors in Conflict Zones, Lynne Rienner, 2007, 21-39.  Unwanted children born of rape are potentially more vulnerable in a psychological as well as in a physical way and cases of abandoned children are reported from various contemporary conflict and post-conflict societies.[tpl]Cite journal |first1=Kate |last1=Holt |first2=Sarah |last2=Hughes |title=Bosnia's rape babies: abandoned by their families, forgotten by the state |journal=The Independent |date=13 December 2005 |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/bosnias-rape-babies-abandoned-by-their-families-forgotten-by-the-state-519257.html [/tpl]Eunice Apio: "Uganda's Forgotten Children of War", in Charli Carpenter (Ed.): Born of War: Protecting Children of Sexual Violence Survivors in Conflict Zones, Lynne Rienner, 2007, 94-109[tpl]Cite journal |first=James |last=McKinley |title=Legacy of Rwanda Violence: The Thousands Born of Rape |journal=The New York Times |date=23 September 1996 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/23/world/legacy-of-rwanda-violence-the-thousands-born-of-rape.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm [/tpl]
The societal consequences of war rape can equally have a negative impact on post-conflict reconciliation and the judicial follow-up on war-time crimes, including rape. Given the stigmatisation of victims and their isolation or fear thereof, they might prefer to remain silent with regard to the violations they have suffered from. Indeed, underreporting of cases of rape during armed conflict is a practical challenge post-conflict communities have to face that is pointed to by a number of actors, including the United Nations Secretary-General,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2013/149 |title=United Nations Official Document |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl]  the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/newsevents/pages/rapeweaponwar.aspx |title=Rape: Weapon of war |publisher=Ohchr.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl] as well as international NGOs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/1996/Rwanda.htm |title=Rwanda |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl]
As Human Rights Watch reported with regard to war rape during the Rwandan Genocide, victims "expressed dismay at the fact that they were being urged to forget what happened to them in the name of peace and reconciliation".  The fear of consequences and threat of exclusion felt by the victims makes it difficult to establish clear figures of war rape incidents and to hold perpetrators accountable for the crimes they have committed, as has been claimed with regards to war rape in Darfur: "Underreporting of cases may be attributed to the stigma associated with rape, shame and fear of reprisal, denial that rape occurs, intimidation by many Government officials and the inability to access some conflict-affected areas".p. 16. This points to another difficulty victims of war rape have to deal with at the societal level. The perpetrators of rape are often officials or otherwise affiliated with the state's institutions, which might makes reporting of assaults appear useless.[tpl]cite web |title=Physicians for Human Rights: Nowhere to Turn: Failure to Protect, Support and Assure Justice to Darfuri Women |year=2009 |page=4 |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/nowhere-to-turn.pdf |format=PDF[/tpl]

===Psychiatric care===

Disrupted healthcare sectors is a term the World Health Organization describes for medical facilities that are destroyed or partially destroyed in war torn areas.Analysing Disrupted Health Sectors: A Modular Manual. Department of Recovery and Transition Programmes Health Action in Crises. World Health Organization Draft. June 2009. Health care facilities are essential for the establishment of support systems for rape victims. Phycological support units are also hampered by the lack of material resources available to the medical community on-ground. Medical practitioners and health-care workers face daunting challenges in conflict and post-conflict area. As the WHO explains, "healthcare delivery fragments and deteriorates, memory and knowledge are eroded, and power disperses."ibid. p.7 War torn societies in immediate post-conflict zones have broken medical infrastructure such as: destroyed or partially destroyed hospitals (or clinics); non-functioning hospitals; poor, scarce or inadequate medical supplies, lack of running water, and scarce or lack of electricity. Dismantling weapons from armed rebels and other groups are prioritized in immediate post-conflict situations which in effect de-prioritizes the immediate physical and psychiatric care that war rape victims are in urgent need of. "If we do not have the capacity to prevent war, we have a collective responsibility to better understand and treat its psychiatric, medical, and social consequences."Hollifield, M. (2005). Taking measure of war trauma. The Lancet, 365(9467), 1283-1284. Access to phycological health services further causes inequity for survivors of war rape who are at the margins of society living in chronic poverty or located in rural regions.Joachim, I. (2004b). Sexualised violence in war and its consequences.  In Medica Mondiale (Ed.), Violence  against women in war: Handbook for professionals working with traumatised women (pp. 63-110).

International Journal of Gynaecology & Obstetrics, 48(3), pp. 311-315. Healthcare and psychiatric care is a key component to the healing processes of war rape.

==Symbolism==

Spivak characterizes "group rape perpetrated by the conquerors" as "a metonymic celebration of territorial acquisition".[tpl]cite book |last=Spivak |first=Gayatri Chakravorty |authorlink=Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak |title=A Critique of Postcolonial Reason: Towards a History of the Vanishing Present |year=1999 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=0-674-17764-9 |page=300 |quote=The group rape perpetrated by the conquerors is a metonymic celebration of territorial acquisition[/tpl]

==Military strategy==

Amnesty International has challenged the view that sees rape and sexual abuse as a by-product of war. According to Amnesty International, rape is now used deliberately as a military strategy.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/4078677.stm| last = Smith-Spark | first = Laura | title = How did rape become a weapon of war?|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=28 July 2008 | date=8 December 2004[/tpl] War rape is reportedly used for the purpose of conquering territory by expelling the population therefrom, decimating remaining civilians by destroying their links of affiliations, by the spread of AIDS, and by eliminating cultural and religious traditions. War rape may be described as "weapon of war" or a "means of combat" in the media.

The Vikings (Scandinavians who raided and colonized wide areas of Europe from the late 8th century to the early 11th century),Roesdahl, pp. 9–22. have acquired a reputation for "rape and pillage".

====Second Manchu invasion of Korea====

In the Second Manchu invasion of Korea when Qing forces invaded the Korean Kingdom of Joseon, many Korean women were subjected to rape at the hand of the Qing forces, and as a result were unwelcomed by their families even if they were released by the Qing after being ransomed.Yi 2008, p. 114.

====Indian Rebellion====

With the beginnings of the mass media in the 19th century, war rape was occasionally used as propaganda by European colonialists in order to justify the colonization of places they had conquered. The most notable example was perhaps during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, known as "India's First War of Independence" to the Indians and as the "Sepoy Mutiny" to the British, where Indian sepoys rebelled against the British East India Company's rule in India. While incidents of rape committed by Indian rebels against English women and girls were generally uncommon during the rebellion, this was exaggerated to great effect by the British media in order to justify continued British colonialism in the Indian subcontinent.[tpl]Cite book|title=Vanishing Women: Magic, Film, and Feminism|first=Karen Redrobe|last=Beckman|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-8223-3074-1|pages=31–3[/tpl]
At the time, British newspapers had printed various apparently eyewitness accounts of English women and girls being raped by Indian rebels, but with little physical evidence to support these accounts. It was later found[tpl]Citation needed||date=January 2014[/tpl] that most of these accounts were false stories created to paint native Indian people as savages who had to be civilized by British colonialists, a mission sometimes known as The White Man's Burden. One such account published by The Times, regarding an incident where 48 English girls as young as 10–14 had been raped by the Indian rebels in Delhi, was criticized as a false propaganda story by Karl Marx, who pointed out that the story was written by a clergyman in Bangalore, far from the events of the rebellion.[tpl]Cite book|title=Vanishing Women: Magic, Film, and Feminism|first=Karen Redrobe|last=Beckman|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-8223-3074-1|pages=33–4[/tpl]

===World War I===

Rapes were allegedly committed during the Imperial German advance through Belgium in the first months of the war.Susan Brownmiller, Against Our Will (1975) pp.40–48 After the war Harold D. Lasswell dismissed them as propaganda in his 1927 Freudian-oriented study, "Propaganda Technique in the World War".Brownmiller, "Against Our Will (1975) p. 44

===World War II===

The sometimes widespread and systematic occurrence of war rape by soldiers and civilians of women has been documented. During World War II and in its immediate aftermath, war rape occurred in a range of situations, ranging from institutionalized sexual slavery to war rapes associated with specific battles. The Judge Advocate General's office reports that there were 971 convictions for rape in the U.S. military from January 1942 to June 1947, which includes a portion of the occupation.

====Europe====

The Italian statistics record eight rapes and nineteen attempted rape by British soldiers  in Italy between September 1943 and December 1945. Various sources, including the Special Investigation Branch as well as evidences from Belgian reporters, said that rape and sexual harassment by British troops occurred frequently following the invasion of Sicily in 1943.Emsley, Clive (2013) Soldier, Sailor, Beggarman, Thief: Crime and the British Armed Services since 1914. Oxford University Press, USA, p. 128-129; ISBN 0199653712
Although far from the scale of those committed by the Red Army, rapes on local women and girls were a common feature among British and Canadian troops during the last months of WWII in Germany. Even elderly women were targeted. Though a high-profile issue for the Royal Military Police, some officers treated the behaviour of their men with leniency. Many rapes were committed under the effects of alcohol or post-traumatic stress, but there were cases of premeditated attacks, like the assault on three German women in the town of Neustadt am Rübemberge, on 16 April 1945, or the attempted gang-rape of two local girls at gunpoint in the village of Oyle, near Nienburg, which ended in the death of one of the women when, whether intentionally or not, one of the soldiers discharged his gun, hitting her in the neck.Longden, Sean (2004) To the victor the spoils: D-Day to VE Day, the reality behind the heroism. Arris Books, p. 195. ISBN 1844370380
There were also reports of "sexual assault and offences" committed by British soldiers against children in Belgium and the Netherlands, when a number of men were convicted of these crimes while fraternizing with Dutch and Belgian families during the winter of 1944-45. On a single day in mid-April 1945, three women in Neustadt were raped by British soldiers. A senior British Army chaplain following the troops reported that there was a 'good deal of rape going on'. He then added that "those who suffer rape have probably deserved it.' In the summer of 1945, two drunken British soldiers stormed into a farmhouse in Klagenfurt with a drawn revolver when there were just two women present. The older of the two women was forced to go upstairs while the other, an 18-year-old girl, was raped by one of the soldiers.
Rapes were committed by Wehrmacht forces on Jewish women and girls during the Invasion of Poland  in September 1939;"55 Dni Wehrmachtu w Polsce" Szymon Datner Warsaw 1967 page 67 "Zanotowano szereg faktów gwałcenia kobiet i dziewcząt żydowskich" (Numerous facts of cases of rapes made upon Jewish women and girls were reported) they were also committed against Polish women and girls during mass executions carried out primarily by the Selbstschutz units, which were accompanied by Wehrmacht soldiers and on territory under the administration of the German military; the rapes were carried out before shooting female captives.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kki.net.pl/~museum/rozdz3,2.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071029144245/http://www.kki.net.pl/~museum/rozdz3,2.htm |archivedate=2007-10-29 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=29 October 2007 |accessdate=9 November 2012[/tpl] Only one case of rape was prosecuted by a German court during the military campaign in Poland, and even then the German judge sentenced the guilty for Rassenschande (a shame against their race as defined by the racial policy of Nazi Germany), not rape.Numer: 17/18/2007 Wprost "Seksualne Niewolnice III Rzeszy" Jewish women were particularly vulnerable to rape during the Holocaust.[tpl]cite web|url=http://vallentinemitchell.metapress.com/content/122369 |title=Holocaust Studies: A Journal of Culture and History - Vallentine Mitchell |publisher=Vallentinemitchell.metapress.com |date=2011-10-10 |accessdate=2014-04-30[/tpl]
Rapes were also committed by German forces on Eastern Front, where they were largely unpunished (as opposed to rapes committed in Western Europe); the overall number of rapes is difficult to establish due to lack prosecution of the crime by German courts.Jews, Germans, and Allies: Close Encounters in Occupied Germany Atina Grossmann page 290Zur Debatte um die Ausstellung. Vernichtungskrieg. Verbrechen der Wehrmacht 1941-1944. Kieler Landeshaus 1999. Wehrmacht also established a system of military brothels, in which young women and girls from occupied territories were forced into prostitution in harsh conditions. In Soviet Union women were kidnapped by German forces for prostitution as well; one report by International Military Tribunal writes "in the city of Smolensk the German Command opened a brothel for officers in one of the hotels into which hundreds of women and girls were driven; they were mercilessly dragged down the street by their arms and hair".War crimes against women: prosecution in international war crimes tribunals Kelly Dawn Askin page 72

Many of these victims were raped repeatedly. Antony Beevor estimates that up to half the victims were victims of gang rapes. Naimark states that not only did each victim have to carry the trauma with her for the rest of her days, it inflicted a massive collective trauma on the East German nation. Naimark concludes "The social psychology of women and men in the Soviet zone of occupation was marked by the crime of rape from the first days of occupation, through the founding of the GDR in the fall of 1949, until, one could argue, the present."Norman M. Naimark. The Russians in Germany: A History of the Soviet Zone of Occupation, 1945–1949. Harvard University Press, 1995. pp. 132, 133. ISBN 0-674-78405-7. German women who became pregnant after being raped by Soviet soldiers in World War II were invariably denied abortion to further humiliate them as to carry an unwanted child.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2008[/tpl] According to the book Berlin: The Downfall, 1945 by Antony Beevor, some 90% of raped Berlin women in 1945 had venereal diseases as results of these consequential rapes and 3.7% of all children born in Germany from 1945 to 1946 had Soviet fathers. The history behind this particular rape of the German women by the Soviet troops was considered a taboo topic until 1992. (See also Red Army atrocities.)
In Romania, the writer Mihail Sebastian described that in 1944, Soviet soldiers raped local women.
After the German armed forces had surrendered, the half of Germany under Soviet Union occupation was split roughly in half and one part was allocated for Polish administration (see Former eastern territories of Germany). In order to ensure that the German territory under communist Polish administration would become permanently de facto Polish territory, the Polish communists ordered that the German population be expelled "by whatever means necessary".Norman M. Naimark. The Russians in Germany: A History of the Soviet Zone of Occupation, 1945–1949. Harvard University Press, 1995. ISBN 0-674-78405-7 pp. 74–75. The communist Polish administrators of the occupied territories as a consequence did little to protect the German population from Polish and Soviet rapists. "Even the Soviets expressed shock at the Poles’ behavior. Polish soldiers, stated one report, 'relate to German women as to free booty'."

Evidence of the magnitude of rape in Bosnia and Herzegovina prompted the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to deal openly with these abuses.

It has been estimated that during the Bosnian War between 20,000 and 50,000 women were raped. The majority of the rape victims were Muslim women raped by Serbian soldiers. Although men also became victim of sexual violence, war rape was disproportionately directed against women who were (gang) raped in the streets, in their homes and/or in front of family members. Sexual violence occurred in a multiple ways, including rape with objects, such as broken glass bottles, guns and truncheons. War rape occurred as a matter of official orders as part of ethnic cleansing, to displace the targeted ethnic group out of the region.[tpl]cite book |last= de Brouwer |first=Anne-Marie |title= Supranational Criminal Prosecution of Sexual Violence |url=http://books.google.com/?id=JhY8ROsA39kC&dq=war+rape+in+ancient+times |publisher=Intersentia |isbn=90-5095-533-9 |page=10 |year=2005 [/tpl]
During the Bosnian War the existence of deliberately created "rape camps" was reported. The reported aim of these camps was to impregnate the Muslim and Croatian women held captive. It has been reported that often women were kept in confinement until the late stage of their pregnancy. This occurred in the context of a patrilineal society, in which children inherit their father's ethnicity, hence the "rape camps" aimed at the birth of a new generation of Serb children. According to the Women's Group Tresnjevka more than 35,000 women and children were held in such Serb-run "rape camps".[tpl]cite book |last= de Brouwer |first=Anne-Marie |title= Supranational Criminal Prosecution of Sexual Violence |url=http://books.google.com/?id=JhY8ROsA39kC&dq=war+rape+in+ancient+times |publisher=Intersentia |isbn=90-5095-533-9 |pages=9–10 |year=2005 [/tpl]new Internationalist issue 244, June 1993.

During the Kosovo War thousands of Kosovo Albanian women and girls became victims of sexual violence. War rape was used as a weapon of war and an instrument of systematic ethnic cleansing; rape was used to terrorize the civilian population, extort money from families, and force people to flee their homes. According to a 2000 Human Rights Watch report war rape in the Kosovo War can generally be subdivided into three categories: rapes in women's homes, rapes during fighting, and rapes in detention. The majority of the perpetrators were Serbian paramilitaries, but they also included Serbian special police or Yugoslav army soldiers. Most rapes were gang rapes involving at least two perpetrators. Rapes occurred frequently in the presence, and with the acquiescence, of military officers. Soldiers, police, and paramilitaries often raped their victims in the full view of numerous witnesses.

===Rwanda genocide===

During the Rwanda genocide, from April until June 1994, hundreds of thousands of women and girls were raped and/or became the victims of other forms of sexual violence. Although no explicit written orders to rape and sexual violence have been found, evidence suggests that military leaders encouraged or ordered their men to rape Tutsi, as well as condoned the acts taking place, without making efforts to stop them.[tpl]cite book |last= de Brouwer |first=Anne-Marie |title= Supranational Criminal Prosecution of Sexual Violence |url=http://books.google.com/?id=JhY8ROsA39kC&dq=war+rape+in+ancient+times |publisher=Intersentia |isbn=90-5095-533-9 |page=13 |year=2005 [/tpl] Compared to other conflicts the sexual violence in Rwanda stands out in terms of the organised nature of the propaganda that contributed significantly to fuelling sexual violence against Tutsi women, the very public nature of the rapes and the level of brutality towards the women. Anne-Marie de Brouwer concludes that considering the massive scale and public nature of war rape during the Rwanda genocide, "it is difficult to imagine anybody in Rwanda who was not aware of the sexual violence taking place."[tpl]cite book |last= de Brouwer |first=Anne-Marie |title= Supranational Criminal Prosecution of Sexual Violence |url=http://books.google.com/?id=JhY8ROsA39kC&dq=war+rape+in+ancient+times |publisher=Intersentia |isbn=90-5095-533-9 |page=14 |year=2005[/tpl] In 1998, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda made the landmark decisions that the war rape during the Rwanda genocide was an element of the crime of genocide. The Trial Chamber held that "sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the Tutsi ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only, manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide."
In his 1996 report the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Rwanda, Rene Degni-Segui stated that "rape was the rule and its absence the exception." The report also stated that "rape was systematic and was used as a "weapon" by the perpetrators of the massacres. This can be estimated from the number and nature of the victims as well as from the forms of rape." A 2000 report prepared by the Organisation of African Unity’s International Panel of Eminent Personalities concluded that "we can be certain that almost all females who survived the genocide were direct victims of rape or other sexual violence, or were profoundly affected by it".
The Special Rapporteur on Rwanda estimated in his 1996 report that between 2,000 and 5,000 pregnancies resulted from war rape, and that between 250,000 and 500,000 Rwandese women and girls had been raped. Rwanda is a patriarchal society and children therefore take the ethnicity of the father, underlining that war rape occurred in the context of genocide.
Within the context of the Rwanda genocide victims of sexual violence were predominantly attacked on the basis of their gender and ethnicity. The victims were mostly Tutsi women and girls, of all ages, while men were only seldom the victims of war rape. Women were part of the anti-Tutsi propaganda prior the 1994 genocide. The December 1990 issue of the newspaper Kangura published the "Ten Commandments", four of which portrayed Tutsi women as tools of the Tutsi community, as sexual weapons that would be used by the Tutsi to weaken and ultimately destroy the Hutu men. Gender based propaganda also include cartoons printed in newspapers that portrayed Tutsi women as sex objects. Examples of gender based hate propaganda used to incite war rape include statements by perpetrators such as "You Tutsi women think that you are too good for us" and "Let us see what a Tutsi woman tastes like". Victims of war rape during the Rwanda genocide also included Hutu women considered moderates, such as Hutu women married to Tutsi men and Hutu women politically affiliated with the Tutsi. War rape also occurred regardless of ethnicity or political affiliation, with young or beautiful women being targeted based on their gender only. Sexual violence against men occurred significantly less frequently, but frequently included mutilation of the genitals, which were often displayed in public. The perpetrators of war rape during the Rwanda genocide were mainly members of the Hutu militia, the "Interahamwe". Rapes were also committed by military soldiers of the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR), including the Presidential Guard, and civilians.
Sexual violence against women and girls during the Rwanda genocide included: rape, gang rape, sexual slavery (either collectively or individually through "forced marriages"), rape with objects such as sticks and weapons often leading to the victim’s death, sexual mutilation of, in particular, breasts, vaginas or buttocks, often during or following rape. Pregnant women were not spared from sexual violence and on many occasion victims were killed following rape. Many women were raped by men who knew they were HIV positive and it has been suggested that there were deliberate attempts to transmit the virus to Tutsi women and their families. War rape occurred all over the country and was frequently perpetrated in plain view of others, at sites such as schools, churches, roadblocks, government buildings or in the bush. Some women were kept as personal slaves for years after the genocide, forced to move to neighbouring countries after the genocide along with their captors.
The long-term effects of war rape in Rwanda for the victims include social isolation (social stigma attached to rape meant some husbands left their wives that had become victim of war rape, or that the victim became unmarriageable), unwanted pregnancies and babies (some women resorted to self-induced abortions), sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis, gonorrhoea and HIV/Aids (access to anti-retroviral drugs remains limited).

===Sri Lanka civil war===

During the Sri Lankan Civil War, multiple Human Rights Organizations have reported cases of rape, violence and disappearance of women in the 1990s, claiming to be committed by security forces. Amnesty International, for instance, believes that these actions might have been just a fraction of a widespread violence, claiming that many women have avoided giving testimony about the forces' treatment.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA37/008/1996/en/c81b26f3-eb01-11dd-aad1-ed57e7e5470b/asa370081996en.html |title=DOCUMENT – SRI LANKA: WAVERING COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS] |year=1996 |accessdate=11 July 2011[/tpl] Government officials, including the president, have denied the claims and agreed to co-operate with the investigations and prosecute whomever they find guilty.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hrw.org/legacy/worldreport/Asia-10.htm |title=Human Rights Watch World Report 1998 |accessdate=11 July 2011 [/tpl] The UN Special Rapporteur, on the other hand, have reported that individual investigations and proceedings relating to these cases have started at the local magistrates courts.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/2848af408d01ec0ac1256609004e770b/b0c23b08bd41fc0f802567240054637f?OpenDocument#Sri |title=United Nation's Report of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women,its causes and consequences, Ms. Radhika Coomaraswamy |year=2000 |accessdate=13 July 2011 [/tpl]
Some of the notable cases of murdered raped victims and the massacres associated with the rape incidents are – Krishanti Kumaraswamy, Arumaithurai Tharmaletchumi, Ida Carmelitta, Ilayathambi Tharsini, Murugesapillai Koneswary, Premini Thanuskodi, Sarathambal, Thambipillai Thanalakshmi, Kumarapuram massacre and Vankalai massacre.

==Recent occurrences==

According to Amnesty International, recent documented cases of war rape include incidents in  Afghanistan, Chechnya, Colombia, Iraq, Sudan, and Nepal.
Commenting on the rape of women and children in recent African conflict zones, UNICEF said in 2008 that rape was no longer just perpetrated by combatants but also by civilians. According to UNICEF rape is common in countries affected by wars and natural disasters, drawing a link between the occurrence of sexual violence and significant uprooting of a society and the crumbling of social norms. UNICEF states that in Kenya reported cases of sexual violence doubled within days of recent post-election conflict erupting. According to UNICEF rape was prevalent in conflict zones in Sudan, Chad, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.[tpl]cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7242421.stm| title = Africa war zones’ ‘rape epidemic’|publisher=BBC News | date=13 February 2008 | accessdate=6 January 2010[/tpl]
