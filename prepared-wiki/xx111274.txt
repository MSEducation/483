[[Kondratyuk (crater)]]

CATEGORIES: Impact craters on the Moon

Kondratyuk is a worn crater on the Moon's far side. It is located to the west-northwest of the large walled plain Fermi, and to the northeast of the crater Hilbert. To the north-northwest is Meitner, and to the northeast lies Langemak.
This is an eroded crater formation with a rim that has been partly damaged by subsequent impacts. The small, sharp-rimmed satellite crater Kondratyuk A lies on the interior floor, along the northeast inner wall. In the southwest part of the floor is Kondratyuk Q.

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Kondratyuk.
