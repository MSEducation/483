Bobby Neal Bright, Sr. (born July 21, 1952), is an American politician who served as U.S. Representative for [tpl]ushr|Alabama|2[/tpl] from 2009 to 2011. He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district includes just over half of the state capital, Montgomery, as well as most of the Wiregrass Region in the southeastern part of the state. Bright is the first Mayor of Montgomery to be elected to Congress. In November 2010, he was defeated for a second term in the U.S. House by the Republican Martha Roby, a Montgomery City Council member.

==Early life, education, and early career==

Bright was born in Midland City, Alabama and grew up on one of the cotton farms that were typical of the Wiregrass Region.Bobby Bright profile at CQ Politics After spending his youth working on the farm and graduating from high school, he took a job in metalworking to save up money for college. He later graduated from Auburn University with a B.A. in political science in 1975 and took a job as an auditor before earning an M.S. in criminal justice from Troy State University in 1977 and beginning a career as a corrections officer. While working in the prison system, he was deeply affected by the many young people he saw entering the penitentiaries and decided to transition into law practice as a result.[tpl]Dead link|date=July 2010[/tpl] Bright received his Juris Doctor from the Thomas Goode Jones School of Law at Faulkner University in 1982. He practiced law for fifteen years before entering into politics.

==Mayor of Montgomery==

Bright was first elected in 1999, defeating longtime incumbent Republican Emory Folmar. He was re-elected in a landslide against challenger Scott Simmons in 2003.
During Bright's tenure he revitalized Montgomery's downtown and riverfront including the Renaissance Montgomery complex and Montgomery Riverwalk Stadium. He helped bring new jobs to the area, and saved existing jobs. He was also named the state's "Tourism Advocate of the Year" by the Governor for his work in building that industry. On the financial side, he balanced the City's budget every year and created a $30 million rainy day fund, secured millions in federal grants for important projects, maintained the city's "AA" credit rating (best in state) by holding spending and debt in check, and saved money by implementing an international prescription drug buying program.Alabama's 2nd District DCCC[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.montgomerychamber.com/riverfront/ | title=Montgomery Area Chamber of Commerce's Riverfront Development page[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cabj.biz/081805/qanda.htm | title=Central Alabama Business Journal interview with Bobby Bright in August, 2005[/tpl]

===Elections===

Bright had never previously claimed affiliation with any party, but in 2008 he announced that he was running as a Democrat for the open seat in the 2nd District.  The district's eight-term incumbent, Republican Terry Everett, was not running for reelection.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.al.com/newsflash/regional/index.ssf?/base/news-34/1203695957217140.xml&storylist=alabamanews | title=Montgomery Mayor Bobby Bright to run for Congress[/tpl]
Like many Alabama Democrats, he opposes abortion and gun control. However, he favors "a strong, honorable plan" to end the Iraq War.Nolin, Jill Profile of Bobby Bright Montgomery Advertiser, May 27, 2008.[tpl]Citation broken|date=August 2010[/tpl]
Bright was considered the strongest Democrat to run in a district that had been in Republican hands since 1965. With the strong support of the state and national Democratic establishment, Bright easily won the Democratic nomination against two minor challengers. He faced Republican State Representative Jay Love in the November election. Both Bright and Love are deacons at First Baptist Church in Montgomery.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.ethicsdaily.com/article_detail.cfm?AID=10993 | title=Fellow Church Members, Deacons, Vie for Alabama Congressional Seat[/tpl]  Bright received the endorsement of bitter Republican primary loser State Senator Harri Anne Smith, whom Love had defeated by six points in the primary.Ex-GOP candidate backs Bright October 12, 2008.

In the November election, Bright received 143,997 votes to Love's 142,231 votes—a margin of 1,766 votes, or just over 0.6 percentage points.  While the two candidates each won eight of the district's 16 counties, Bright won the district's share of Montgomery County by 30 points.  Love had the option of requesting a recount since the margin of victory was less than a point, but opted not to do so and conceded the seat to Bright.Orndorff, Mary. Alabama State Rep.

Bright's victory, and that of Parker Griffith in the 5th District, gave Alabama two white Democratic congressmen for the first time since Tom Bevill and Glen Browder left the House in 1997.  He also represents the fourth most Republican district in the nation to be represented by a Democrat; it has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+16, and gave John McCain 63 percent of the vote in 2008.
The 2nd traditionally gives its congressmen very long tenures in Washington; Bright is only the seventh person to represent it in over a century, and the fifth since 1921. Bright's 2008 campaign was endorsed by Democrats for Life of America."Act Blue" page of Democrats for Life
Bright was unopposed in the 2010 Democratic primary.  Mainstream Republican Montgomery city council member Martha Roby decisively beat Tea Party favorite and former Marine Rick Barber.http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38236782/ns/politics/  Bright ran campaign ads aimed at distancing himself from the establishment Democratic Party.  In these ads, he described himself as “independent and conservative,” and emphasized his support for small business.  Under fire from Roby for his support of Pelosi for Speaker of the House, Bright stated publicly that he would not vote for Pelosi for Speaker again.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matthew-givens/post_1080_b_767078.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Matthew | last=Givens | title=Alabama 2nd Congressional District Recap | date=October 18, 2010[/tpl]

In November 2009, Bright, along with Representative Walt Minnick of Idaho, introduced House Resolution 4072.  This resolution reorganized public job training funds, directing them towards flexible skills and credentials recognized by industries.  Also called the American Manufacturing Efficiency and Retraining Investment Collaboration Act (AMERICA Works), the bill was targeted at new workers just entering the workforce and servicemen and women returning to civilian life.http://bright.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=476&Itemid=94
Because of his dedication to small business, Bright requested a waiver to serve on the House Small Business Committee shortly after his arrival in Washington.  This committee worked to find solutions to the challenges faced by small businesses.  Some of these include the cost of health care, the impact of food safety recalls, federal government regulations, and small business taxes.  The first bill sponsored by Bright was intended for the benefit of small businesses.  It created a bonus deprecation for the kind of large purchases made by small businesses.  His legislation would eventually be included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which became law on February 17, 2009.http://bright.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=165&Itemid=84
After the defection of fellow Alabama Democrat Parker Griffith to the Republican Party in December 2009, political analyst and statistician Nate Silver suggested that Bright could follow, naming "60/40" odds that he would eventually join the Republican caucus as well.[tpl]cite web|last=Silver |first=Nate |url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/12/2009s-most-valuable-democrat-is.html |title=Politics Done Right: 2009's Most Valuable Democrat Is |publisher=FiveThirtyEight |date=Dec 23, 2009 |accessdate=Jul 11, 2010[/tpl] The day after Griffith's party switch, Bright told media that he had no intention of switching parties and would remain a Democrat.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1209/30942_Page2.html |title=McCain, GOP secretly courting another Dem to switch |publisher=Politico.Com |date= |accessdate=Jul 11, 2010[/tpl]
