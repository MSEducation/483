The Ford F550 is a class 5 Ford conventional truck. 
Its configuration is unique in its weight class in that the model shares fenders, hood and grille as well as the cab with a pickup model. 2005 and later models have a wide track front axle, with Gray plastic fender and bumper extensions (shared with the F450) that made the trucks much easier to maneuver in tight spots. GVW's up to 19,500# are offered, also a 35,000# GCWR towing package is offered. New for 2011 is a 6.7 liter Ford built Powerstroke diesel engine. The 6.8 liter V10 gas engine is a carryover for 2011.
