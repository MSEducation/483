==Criticism==

In September 2010, Bean received criticism in the British press after he explained the Bank of England's policy of reducing household saving levels, saying "what we’re trying to do by our ­policy is ­encourage more spending; ideally we’d like to see that in the form of more business spending, but part of the mechanism that might encourage that is having more ­household spending".http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1316084/UK-economic-crisis-Id-hide-cash-splurge.html
