</ref> This important period-luminosity relation allowed the distance to any other cepheid variable to be estimated in terms of the distance to the SMC. Hence, once the distance to the SMC was known with greater accuracy, Cepheid variables could be used as a [[standard candle]] for measuring the distances to other galaxies.<ref>
</ref>
Using this period-luminosity relation, in 1913 the distance to the SMC was first estimated by Ejnar Hertzsprung. First he measured thirteen nearby cepheid variables to find the absolute magnitude of a variable with a period of one day. By comparing this to the periodicity of the variables as measured by Leavitt, he was able to estimate a distance of 10,000 parsecs (30,000 light years) between the Sun and the SMC.[ref]
</ref> This later proved to be a gross underestimate of the true distance, but it did demonstrate the potential usefulness of this technique.<ref>

Announced in 2006, measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope suggest the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds may be moving too fast to be orbiting the Milky Way.Magellanic Clouds May Be Just Passing Through January 9, 2007

==Features==

There is a bridge of gas connecting the Small Magellanic Cloud with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which is evidence of tidal interaction between the galaxies.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mathewson DS, Ford VL |journal=IAUS |year=1984 |volume=108 |pages=125 [/tpl] The Magellanic Clouds have a common envelope of neutral hydrogen indicating they have been gravitationally bound for a long time.

==X-ray sources==

The Small Magellanic Cloud contains a large and active population of X-ray binaries. Recent star formation has led to a large population of massive stars and high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) which are the relics of the short-lived upper end of the initial mass function. The young stellar population and the majority of the known X-ray binaries are concentrated in the SMC’s Bar.
HMXB pulsars are rotating neutron stars (NSs) in binary systems with Be-type (spectral type 09-B2, luminosity classes V–III) or supergiant stellar companions. Most HMXBs are of the Be type which account for 70% in the Milky Way an 98% in the SMC (Coe et al. 2005). The Be-star equatorial disk provides a reservoir of matter that can be accreted onto the NS during periastron passage (most known systems have large orbital eccentricity) or during large-scale disk ejection episodes. This scenario leads to strings of X-ray outbursts with typical
luminosities	LX=10^36-10^37	erg	s−1, spaced at the orbital period, plus infrequent giant outbursts of greater duration and luminosity (see Negueruela 1998 for a review).
Monitoring surveys of the SMC performed with NASA's Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) (Laycock et al. 2005, hereafter L05; Galache et al. 2008) see X-ray pulsars in outburst at >1036 erg s−1 and have counted 50 by the end of 2008. The ROSAT and ASCA missions detected many faint X-ray point sources (e.g., Haberl & Sasaki 2000), but the typical positional uncertainties frequently made positive identification difficult. Recent studies using XMM-Newton (Haberl et al. 2008; Haberl & Pietsch 2004) and Chandra (Antoniou et al. 2009; Edge et al. 2004, and Laycock et al. 2010) have now cataloged several hundred X-ray sources in the direction of the SMC, the of which perhaps half are considered likely HMXBs, and the remainder a mix of foreground stars, and background AGN.

==Mini Magellanic Cloud (MMC)==

It has been proposed by astrophysicists D. S. Mathewson, V. L. Ford and N. Visvanathan that the SMC may in fact be split in two, with a smaller section of this galaxy behind the main part of the SMC (as seen from our perspective), and separated by about 30,000 ly. They suggest the reason for this is due to a past interaction with the LMC splitting the SMC, and that the two sections are still moving apart. They have dubbed this smaller remnant the Mini Magellanic Cloud.[tpl]cite journal|last1=Mathewson|first1=D. S.|last2=Ford|first2=V.
