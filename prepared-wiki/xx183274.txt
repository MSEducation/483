CATEGORIES: United States presidential primaries, 1984, Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries

The 1984 Republican presidential primaries were the selection process by which voters of the Republican Party chose its nominee for President of the United States in the 1984 U.S. presidential election. Incumbent President Ronald Reagan was again selected as the nominee through a series of primary elections and caucuses culminating in the 1984 Republican National Convention held from August 20 to August 23, 1984 in Dallas, Texas.
The primaries were uneventful as Reagan was virtually assured of the nomination by virtue of his popularity within the party. Thus, he faced only token opposition in the primary race.

Vice President George H. W. Bush was overwhelmingly renominated. This was the last time in the 20th century that the Vice Presidential candidate of either major party was nominated by roll call vote.
