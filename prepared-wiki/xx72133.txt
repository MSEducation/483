Campbeltown Airport ([tpl]lang-gd|Port-adhair Cheann Loch Chille Chiarain[/tpl]) [tpl]Airport codes|CAL|EGEC[/tpl] is located at Machrihanish, [tpl]convert|3|NM|abbr=on|lk=in[/tpl] west of Campbeltown, near the tip of the Kintyre peninsula in Argyll and Bute on the west coast of Scotland. It is still owned by the Ministry of Defence, under a 'care and maintenance' programme, but a part of the airport is now run as a commercial enterprise by the Highlands and Islands Airports Limited, a company under the control of the Scottish Government.
The airport was formerly known as RAF Machrihanish (after the village of Machrihanish) and hosted squadrons of the Royal Air Force and other NATO air forces as well as the United States Marine Corps. It is now called MoD Machrihanish. The airport is at a strategic point near the Irish Sea, and was used to guard the entrance to the Firth of Clyde where US nuclear submarines were based at Holy Loch and where Royal Navy Trident missile submarines are still based at HMNB Clyde (Faslane Naval Base).
Permanent full-time military operations ceased in 1997.
