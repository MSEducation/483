[[Golden cat]]

CATEGORIES: Felines

A golden cat is a medium-sized wild cat belonging to either the genus Catopuma or Profelis. 
Golden cats inhabit rainforests and hunt on the ground. Their fur is normally reddish brown or golden brown, although there are several color variants. According to recent studies the African species is not closely related to the two Asian species; the similarity appears to be a result of convergent evolution.
