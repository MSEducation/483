Something Ilk is the debut album of Irish songstress Cathy Davey. It was released in 2004. The release date for Ireland was 20 August 2004, whilst the release date for the United Kingdom was 23 August 2004.
The album received a largely positive reaction in the Irish media. Davey later expressed her unhappiness with the album and the pressures which the record company had placed upon her.

==Background and recording==

After four performances in Dublin, Davey went to the countryside and commenced writing the songs which would later feature on her debut album. Davey and her band recorded Something Ilk at a studio in Wales. The studio was named Rockfield Studio. Much of the recording was done during a heat wave which occurred in the summer of 2003. They remained at the studio in Wales for a period of approximately seven weeks. The recording process included sitting down in circles to make sounds and swinging doors open and shut again to create sounds. Something Ilk was produced by Ben Hillier who had previously worked with Blur and Elbow. Something Ilk was then released in 2004.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/archive/2748887.html|title=Cathy Davey announces live dates|date=2004-08-20|accessdate=2009-11-15|publisher=Hot Press|quote=Cathy Davey introduces the world to her rather fab Something Ilk album when she descends on Cypress Avenue, Cork (September 16); Dolan's, Limerick (17); Roisin Dubh, Galway (18); and Temple Bar Music Centre, Dublin (19).

==Reception==

Public service broadcaster Raidió Teilifís Éireann's reviewer Harry Guerin said Something Ilk was "high on presence and very low on filler" and gave it three out of five stars.[tpl]cite web|author=Harry Guerin|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2004/0819/daveyc.html|title=Cathy Davey – Something Ilk|date=2004-08-19|accessdate=2009-11-13|publisher=RTÉ[/tpl]
Hot Press remarked, "Not only is her voice elfin, immediate and distinct the songs are also hugely compelling. They are digestible without being lightweight, austere in places without seeming detached".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/music/reviews/albums/2745026.html|title=Something Ilk|date=2004-08-03|accessdate=2009-11-13|publisher=Hot Press|quote=Listening to her debut, it’s easy to see why the gamine Davey caused such frenzied consternation in A&R circles upon her signing to EMI. Not only is her voice elfin, immediate and distinct the songs are also hugely compelling. They are digestible without being lightweight, austere in places without seeming detached. ‘Clean & Neat’ beats with its own distinctive pulse, while ‘Hammerhead’ and ‘Go Make It’ are particularly soft and touching. Like a slightly less cutesy Nina Hynes, or a less visceral PJ Harvey, Davey’s music is unashamedly sexy, almost precocious in places, but still retains a stamp of class.[/tpl]
The Irish Independent[tpl]'[/tpl]s Paul Byrne described Something Ilk as "one of the best Irish albums of 2004".[tpl]cite web|author=Paul Byrne|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/cathys-no-wallflower-748310.html|title=Cathy's no wallflower|date=2007-06-25|accessdate=2009-11-13|publisher=Irish Independent[/tpl]

==Davey's reaction==

Cathy Davey later expressed her unhappiness with Something Ilk, saying dismissively, "I think the record company Regal Recordings thought I was an indie rock chick when they signed me and that album is very much other people's idea of what I should sound like. ... I didn't have the confidence to say no to some of the things Hillier suggested".[tpl]cite web|author=John Meagher|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/qampa-cathy-davey-1116155.html|title=Q&A: Cathy Davey|date=2007-11-05|accessdate=2009-11-13|publisher=Irish Independent[/tpl] Davey claimed not to "know my arse from my elbow when I signed for them" and "despised" performing those songs in a live arena. Despite this, the Irish Independent described her as "very talented—far more so than Gemma Hayes" but regretted that she had "failed to find an audience for her fine debut Something Ilk".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/so-much-music-so-little-talent-246600.html?start=1|title=So much music, so little talent|date=2005-08-25|accessdate=2009-11-13|publisher=Irish Independent[/tpl]
