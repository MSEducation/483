Muckle Green Holm is an uninhabited island in the North Isles of the Orkney archipelago in Scotland. It is roughly [tpl]convert|28|ha|sqmi[/tpl] in extent and rises to [tpl]convert|28|m[/tpl] above sea level, the summit having a trig point. The literal meaning of the name is somewhat contradictory. 'Holm' is from the Old Norse holmr, meaning a small and rounded islet.Waugh, Doreen J.,  Orkney Place-names in Omand, Donald (ed.) (2003) The Orkney Book. Edinburgh, Birlinn. Page 119 'Muckle' is Scots for 'big' or 'large' so it's a big small island. To the south lies Little Green Holm, and between the two is the Sound of Green Holms. Eastward is a strait called Fall of Warness between Muckle Green Holm and the much larger island of Eday. In these waters the European Marine Energy Centre have installed tidal power testing equipment.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.emec.org.uk/| title=EMEC| accessdate=2007-02-03[/tpl]
Muckle Green Holm has a Great Cormorant colony and a population of European Otters.
