Sellafield has been a matter of some consternation in Ireland, with the Irish Government and some members of the population concerned at the risk that such a facility may pose to the country. The Irish government has made formal complaints about the facility, and in 2006 came to a friendly agreement with the British Government about the matter, as part of which the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the Garda Síochána (Irish Police Force) are now allowed access to the site.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/may/30/energy.nuclearindustry | title=Irish Sellafield appeal ruled illegal | publisher=The Guardian | date=30 May 2006 | accessdate=27 October 2013[/tpl]

===Manx objections===

The Government of the Isle of Man has also registered protests due to the risk posed by radioactive contamination, due to the proximity of the Isle of Man. The Manx government has called for the site to be shut down.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/celtic-league-join-call-to-close-down-sellafield-1-1743816|title=Celtic League join call to close down Sellafield |date=23 November 2009|newspaper=Isle of Man Today[/tpl] The Irish and Manx governments have collaborated on this issue, and brought it to the attention of the British-Irish Council.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.agencebretagnepresse.com/fetch.php?id=14814|title=MANNON/ISLE OF MAN: SELLAFIELD – OPPOSITION RESTATED BY MANX GOVERNMENT|newspaper=agencebretagnepresse.com|date=18 April 2009[/tpl]

===Norwegian objections===

Similar objections to those held by the Irish government have been voiced by the Norwegian government since 1997. Monitoring undertaken by the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority has shown that the prevailing sea currents transport radioactive materials leaked into the sea at Sellafield along the entire coast of Norway and water samples have shown up to ten-fold increases in such materials as technetium-99.[tpl]cite journal|last=Brown|first=Paul|date=20 December 1997|title=Norway fury at UK nuclear waste flood|journal=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Newspapers|location=UK|pages=11[/tpl] The Norwegian government is also seeking closure of the facility.

===MOX fuel quality data falsification===

The MOX Demonstration Facility was a small-scale plant to produce commercial quality MOX fuel for light water reactors. The plant was commissioned between 1992 and 1994, and until 1999 produced fuel for use in Switzerland, Germany and Japan.
In 1999 it was discovered that the plant's staff had been falsifying some quality assurance data since 1996.[tpl]cite news|title=Japan launches inquiry into BNFL|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|coauthors=Paul Brown|date=15.09.99|publisher=Guardian Newspapers|pages=9[/tpl] A Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) investigation concluded four of the five work-shifts were involved in the falsification, though only one worker admitted to falsifying data, and that "the level of control and supervision ... had been virtually non-existent.". The NII stated that the safety performance of the fuel was not affected as there was also a primary automated check on the fuel. Nevertheless "in a plant with the proper safety culture, the events described in this report could not have happened" and there were systematic failures in management.[tpl]cite journal | author=Nuclear Installations Inspectorate | title=An Investigation into the Falsification of Pellet Diameter Data in the MOX Demonstration Facility at the BNFL Sellafield Site and the Effect of this on the Safety of MOX Fuel in Use | date=18 February 2000 | url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/mox/mox1.htm | accessdate=18 November 2006[/tpl]

===Plutonium records discrepancy===

On 17 February 2005, the UK Atomic Energy Authority reported that 29.6 kg (65.3 lb) of plutonium was unaccounted for in auditing records at the Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing plant. The operating company, the British Nuclear Group, described this as a discrepancy in paper records and not as indicating any physical loss of material. They pointed out that the error amounted to about 0.5%, whereas International Atomic Energy Agency regulations permit a discrepancy up to 1% as the amount of plutonium recovered from the reprocessing process never precisely matches the pre-process estimates. The inventories in question were accepted as satisfactory by Euratom, the relevant regulatory agency.[tpl]cite news | title=Missing plutonium 'just on paper' | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4272691.stm | publisher=BBC News | date=17 February 2005 | accessdate=22 August 2006 [/tpl]

===Finances===

In 2003 it was announced that the Thorp reprocessing plant would be closed in 2010. Originally predicted to make profits for BNFL of £500m, by 2003 it had made losses of over £1bn.Sellafield reprocessing plant to close by 2010 The Times, 26 August 2003 Subsequently Thorp was closed for almost two years from 2005, after a leak had been undetected for 9 months. Production eventually restarted at the plant in early 2008; but almost immediately had to be put on hold again, for an underwater lift that takes the fuel for reprocessing to be repaired.Geoffrey Lean, 'Shambolic' Sellafield in crisis again after damning safety report, The Independent, 3 February 2008.
In November 2008 Sellafield was taken over by a new consortium (US company URS Corp., French firm Areva and the UK company Amec) for decommissioning, as part of a 5-year £6.5bn contract. In October 2008 it was revealed that the British government had agreed to issue Sellafield an unlimited indemnity against future accidents; according to The Guardian, "the indemnity even covers accidents and leaks that are the consortium's fault." The indemnity had been rushed through prior to the summer parliamentary recess without notifying parliament.The Guardian, 27 October 2008, MP's anger as state bears cost of any Sellafield disaster
In 2009 Sellafield decommissioning accounted for 40% of the budget of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority – over £1.1bn.More government funding for the NDA Nuclear Engineering International, 3 April 2009
In 2013 a critical Public Accounts Committee report stated that the private consortium managing Sellafield has failed to reduce costs and delays. Since 2005 the annual costs of operating Sellafield had increased from £900 million to about £1.6 billion. The estimated lifetime cost of dealing with the Sellafield site had increased to £67.5 billion.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-21298117 |title=Sellafield clean-up cost reaches 67.5bn, says report |publisher=BBC |date=4 February 2013 |accessdate=19 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/feb/04/sellafield-management-criticised-commons-committee |title=Sellafield management sharply criticised by Commons committee |author=Terry Macalister |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 February 2013 |accessdate=19 February 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite report |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmpubacc/746/746.pdf |title=Nuclear Decommissioning Authority: Managing risk at Sellafield |work=Committee of Public Accounts |publisher=House of Commons |date=23 January 2013 |accessdate=19 February 2013[/tpl] Bosses were forced to apologise after projected clean-up costs passed the £70 billion mark in late 2013.[tpl]Cite news |last= Macalister |first= Terry |date= 4 December 2013 |title= Sellafield bosses forced to say sorry over £70bn-plus cleanup costs |url= http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/04/sellafield-boss-sorry-over-cleanup-costs |publisher= theguardian.com |accessdate= 5 December 2013 [/tpl]

==Decommissioning==

Sellafield's biggest decommissioning challenges relate to the leftovers of the early nuclear research and nuclear weapons programmes. Sellafield houses "the most hazardous industrial building in western Europe" (building B30) and the second-most (building B38), which hold a variety of leftovers from the first Magnox plants in ageing ponds. Some of the problems with B38 date back to the 1972 miners' strike: the reactors were pushed so hard that waste processing could not keep up, and "cladding and fuel were simply thrown into B38's cooling ponds and left to disintegrate." Some of the problems date back to the original nuclear weapons programme at Sellafield, when Piles 1 and 2 were constructed at breakneck speed, and safe disposal was not a priority. Building B41 still houses the aluminium cladding for the uranium fuel rods of Piles 1 and 2, and is modelled on a grain silo, with waste tipped in at the top and argon gas added to prevent fires.The Observer, 19 April 2009, Sellafield: the most hazardous place in Europe

==Sellafield in popular culture==

===Music===

In 2010 Post-Punk group Spear of Destiny wrote the song "Windscale" on their album Omega Point which referenced the fire in 1957.
In 1992, rock bands U2, Public Enemy, Big Audio Dynamite II, and Kraftwerk held a "Stop Sellafield" concert for Greenpeace to protest against the nuclear factory. Stop Sellafield: The Concert was later released that year on VHS in the UK, and all proceeds went directly to Greenpeace.
On their 2005 live album Kraftwerk preface a live performance of Radioactivity with a vocoder voice announcing: Sellafield 2 will produce 7.5 tons of plutonium every year.  1.5 kilogram of plutonium make a nuclear bomb. Sellafield 2 will release the same amount of radioactivity into the environment as Chernobyl every 4.5 years. One of these radioactive substances, Krypton 85, will cause death and skin cancer.[tpl]cite web|title=Radioactivity video|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xc52xx_kraftwerk-radioactivity-high-qualit_music#.UZzl58r4JGo|work=Minimum-Maximum|publisher=Daily Motion|accessdate=22 May 2013[/tpl]

Fallout, a 2006 doom laden drama Irish battle fallout from nuclear TV show shown on the Irish national TV station RTÉ, the drama was based on the premise [ref]
 The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) has said that the scenario as depicted in tonight’s RTÉ drama, Fallout, could not happen. The RPII, who viewed the drama...has analysed the scenario as depicted and has concluded that it is not possible for such an accident to occur in Sellafield.[/ref] that parts of Ireland would need to be evacuated following a serious accident at Sellafield,http://www.edie.net/news/1/Irish-battle-fallout-from-nuclear-TV-show/11367/ Dr Ann McGarry, chief executive of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, said: "The scenario envisaged in the programme is not realistic and grossly exaggerates the amount of radioactivity that could reach Ireland. The RPII cannot envisage any realistic scenario that would cause the radiation levels in Ireland to reach the concentrations as what was depicted in the drama" following the accident there are evacuation riots, societal collapse and widespread health impacts.
Sellafield was the subject of Marilynne Robinson's 1989 book, Mother Country, a critique of British nuclear policy.
Sellafield is the central theme of Les Barker's comic poem 'Jason and the Arguments,' and is also mentioned in other Barker works.
Norman Nicholson's poem Windscale is a commentary on the poison that Nicholson believed nuclear power had introduced to an area of natural beauty.
