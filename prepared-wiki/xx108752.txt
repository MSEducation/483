He studied medicine at the University of Tübingen, and in 1847 he won the medical faculty's prize competition for his dissertation on the blood of invertebrates.Edward Griffor and Craig Smorynski (trans.): Logic's Lost Genius: The Life of Gerhard Gentzen (History of Mathematics, vol. 33).

It was subsequently noted that only one of the suckers contained an oral cavity,[tpl]cite book | last = Jordan | first = Peter | title = Schistosomiasis | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1985 | isbn = 0-521-30312-5 | page = 1[/tpl] and in 1856 Heinrich Meckel von Hemsbach proposed that the organism be renamed Bilharzia haematobium. In 1858 Weinland proposed the name Schistosoma (Greek: 'split body') after the male worms' morphology, and the name Schistosoma haematobium was officially adopted by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature.  In 1853 Bilharz became chief of medicine, and in 1856 he was appointed Professor of Anatomy.
