The station was rebuilt during the late 1980s in conjunction with the construction of the adjacent train depot, with the north face of the current island platform brought into use in July 1987 along with temporary station buildings. The new platform was built on a new alignment with 200 metres of new track needed to link to the existing line. The old platform and station building was demolished in 1987.[tpl]cite journal|date=October 1987|title=Works|journal=Newsrail|publisher=Australian Railway Historical Society|pages=page 314[/tpl] The new Solid State Interlocking was commissioned in 1989,Epping Signal Box Vicsig and was the first fully computerised system in Melbourne.
