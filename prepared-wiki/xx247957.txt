Revised editions, retitled The Book of Deadly Animals appeared in 2011 (UK) and 2012 (US). Critic Mark Dery described his work thus: "Fascinated by the alien ways of the nonhuman world, Grice combines the sardonic deadpan of noir fiction with the best naturalists' unsentimental scrutiny of animal behavior and a rural midwesterner's applied knowledge of the predator-prey relationship. A Jean-Henri Fabre for literati who drive pickups with rifle racks."http://www.boingboing.net/2006/12/20/mark_derys_reading_l.html
Grice has also published poetry, fiction, essays, and articles.
