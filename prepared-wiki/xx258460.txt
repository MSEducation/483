Eleginops maclovinus, the Patagonian blenny, Falkland's mullet or rock cod, is a species of notothenioid fishhttp://www.fishbase.org/summary/Eleginops-maclovinus.html found in coastal and estuarine habitats around southernmost South America, ranging as far north as Valparaíso on the Pacific side, and Uruguay on the Atlantic side.Licandeo, Barrientos and González (2006). Age, Growth Rates, Sex Change and Feeding Habits of Notothenioid Fish Eleginops Maclovinus from the Central-southern Chilean Coast. Environmental Biology of Fishes 77(1): 51-61 It is also found around the Falkland Islands, where it has been featured on a stamp.WoRMS (2009). Falkland Island Stamps. It is the only member of its genus, which is the only member of the family Eleginopidae.Mazzei, Ghigliotti, Coutanceau, Detrich, Prirodina, Ozouf-Costaz and Pisano (2008). Chromosomal characteristics of the temperate notothenioid fish Eleginops maclovinus (Cuvier). Polar Biology 31(5): 629-634 Its English names refer to the vaguely blenny-, mullet-, or cod-like appearance, but it is not related to true blennies, mullets, or cods. Locally, it is often called róbalo,Pavés, Pequeño, Bertrán and Vargas (2005). Limnetic feeding in Eleginops maclovinus (Valenciennes, 1830) in the Valdivia River, Chile. Interciencia 30(3): 120-125. a name also used for the common snook.
It is commonly fished in parts of its range.Quiñones and Montes (2001). Relationship between freshwater input to the coastal zone and the historical landings of the benthic/demersal fish Eleginops maclovinus in central-south Chile. Fisheries Oceanography 10(4): 311–328 It is an omnivore, tending towards carnivore. In some parts of its range, it is especially fond of Paracorophium, but it is opportunistic, and its exact diet depends on the availability in the habitat where the individual fish lives.
It reaches about [tpl]convert|105|cm|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] in length, and can live for 10 years. It is a protandric hermaphrodite, and males predominate in lengths below [tpl]convert|52|cm|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], while female predominate above.Brickle, Laptikhovsky and Arkhipkin (2005). Reproductive strategy of a primitive temperate notothenioid Eleginops maclovinus. Journal of Fish Biology 66(4): 1044-1059 It has a diploid number of 48, and a fundamental number of 54.
