The Icelandic singer Björk made her first public appearance in 1976 on Radio One, an Icelandic radio station, singing "I Love to Love". She secured a deal with a record company through which she released her first solo album, Björk, in 1977 when she was twelve years old.
She went on to form several bands, including Tappi Tíkarrass, KUKL, and The Sugarcubes, the last being the most successful. After The Sugarcubes disbanded in 1992, Björk resumed her solo career and in 1993 she released an album called Debut. Since that album, she has been signed to One Little Indian Records in the United Kingdom and Polydor Records and Universal Records in Europe and other territories. In North America she was signed with Elektra Records and Atlantic Records until 2007, and is now under another Warner Music Group division, Nonesuch Records, distributed by Warner Bros. Records.
