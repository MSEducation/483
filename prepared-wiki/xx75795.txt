[[Flame-bladed sword]]

CATEGORIES: Renaissance-era swords

A flame-bladed sword or wave-bladed sword has a characteristically undulating style of blade. The wave in the blade is often considered to contribute a flame-like quality to the appearance of a sword. While largely decorative, some attributes of the waved blade were useful in combat. The two most flame-bladed swords are rapiers or zweihänders, although there have been other sword types with flame-blades.thumb|180px|left|A single-handed sword of the flamberge type.

==Flambard, flammard, and Flammenschwert==

The two-handed flame-bladed sword is called flambard, flammard or by the German Flammenschwert (literally "flame sword"). These swords are very similar to two-handed sword or Zweihänder, the only difference being the blade. Like other zweihänder they were used during the 16th century by the Landsknechts, well-trained and experienced swordsmen, who were called Doppelsöldner (double soldier) because they received double pay.

==Flamberge==

The term flamberge, meaning "flame blade", is an undulating blade that is found on both long blades and rapiers. Parrying with such a sword may transmit unpleasant vibrations into the attacker's blade. These vibrations caused the blades to slow contact with each other because each wave provided additional friction. The unusual cross section of the blade would inflict wider wounds with a thrust while still keeping the blade light. The term flamberge was misapplied to refer to two-handed swords and was used later to refer to cup hilt rapiers with a straight blade.[tpl]cite web|last=ARMA|title=Sword Forms|url=http://thearma.org/terms4.htm|work=Definitions & Study Terminology[/tpl]
