Benmont Tench played piano from an early age and his first recital was at age six. After discovering the music of The Beatles, he ended his classical piano lessons and focused on rock and roll. He met Tom Petty for the first time at a Gainesville music store when he was 11. Petty and Tench played together as members of the Sundowners in 1964.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20060920/LOCAL/209200328 |title=Memories of Petty: How singer found way in area |publisher=Gainesville.com |date=2006-09-20 |accessdate=2014-02-17[/tpl] The Tenches' garage was a frequent practice site for the band on evenings when Benmont's father was out for the evening. Benmont's mother enjoyed having the boys there, but she would check with the neighbors to make certain the music would not disturb them.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20071012/ENTERTAINMENT0201/71012026 |title=Garage band memories |publisher=Gainesville.com |date=2007-10-12 |accessdate=2014-02-17[/tpl]

While on a college break, Tench went to a concert by Mudcrutch, Petty's band, with an opening act from nearby Jacksonville, Lynyrd Skynyrd.
Afterwards, he sat in with the band on several different sessions, then went back to school. Soon after, Petty called Tench and asked him to quit school and join Mudcrutch full-time, which after long deliberation, Benmont agreed to; but before he would leave school, Petty had to convince Circuit Court Judge Benjamin Tench that his son had a promising music career.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wildbluegator.com/benmont/bio.htm |title=Bio |publisher=Wildbluegator.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17[/tpl]
