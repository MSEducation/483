CATEGORIES: Rugby sevens

Geneva Barbarians Rugby is a non-profit rugby association based in Geneva, Switzerland.
Geneva Barbarians Rugby was established in April 2000 by Gianni Di Martino and Christian Von Arx with the aim of creating an elite men’s seven a-side rugby team and supporting the development of rugby sevens in Geneva to the highest international standard.
The team is a ‘Barbarian’ side, which means that it is open to everyone and anyone joining the association and being a part of the squad and training at a high-level, while enjoying the game of rugby.
Players are a mix between local players and invitational players all seeking the highest level of development and expression of excellence in this dynamic form of the game. Geneva barbarians have a broad experience of participating in various international tournaments such as the Amsterdam 7s and Roma 7s which are classified by the IRB in the top 12. Participating in these tournaments means that the Geneva Barbarians often face national and development teams.
Geneva Barbarians Rugby has aspirations to become a leading international Seven-a-Side Team.
