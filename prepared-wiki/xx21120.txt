==Early years==

Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home on 24 April 1973.[tpl]cite web|title=Sachin born at Nirmal Nursing Home|url=http://www.indiatvnews.com/photos/rare-pics-of-sachin-tendulkar-1760.1744.html#/2|accessdate=18 December 2013[/tpl] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist and his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.[tpl]cite book |last1=Thani |first1=L. |last2=Mishra |first2=R. |title=Sensational Sachin |publisher=Diamond Pocket Books |year=1999 |page=113 |quote=His mother Rajni Tendulkar worked in L.I.C.|isbn=81-288-2573-9[/tpl] Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were Ramesh's children from his first marriage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mahalo.com/sachin-tendulkar/ |title=Sachin Tendulkar |publisher=Mahalo.com |accessdate=18 December 2012[/tpl] He spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society, Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.in.msn.com/cricket/sachincorner/article.aspx?cp-documentid=5132762&page=3 |title=38 special facts about Sachin Tendulkar – 3 |publisher=MSN |date=16 March 2012 |accessdate=18 December 2012[/tpl] He also showed an interest in tennis, idolising John McEnroe.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sports.in.msn.com/cricket/sachincorner/article.aspx?cp-documentid=5132762&page=2 |title=38 special facts about Sachin Tendulkar – 2 |publisher=MSN |date=16 March 2012 |accessdate=18 December 2012[/tpl] To help curb his mischievous and bullying tendencies, Ajit introduced him to cricket in 1984. He introduced the young Sachin to Ramakant Achrekar, a famous cricket coach and a club cricketer of repute, at Shivaji Park, Dadar. In the first meeting, the young Sachin did not play his best. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Sachin, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's academy.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] Ajit is ten years elder and is credited by Sachin for playing a pivotal role in his life.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl]
Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English) High School, a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East). He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings.[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-02/mumbai/29374217_1_shivaji-park-ramakant-achrekar-sunil-gavaskar |title=Shivaji Park prays for famous son |date=1 April 2011|newspaper=The Times of India |agency=Times News Network |first=Linah |last=Baliga[/tpl] Tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets. If he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin. If Tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions.[tpl]Cite news|title=Sachin Tendulkar: The last word in cricket|author=Somak Sen|work=Merinews|date=17 October 2008|url=http://www.merinews.com/catFull.jsp?articleID=145044|accessdate=3 June 2009[/tpl] He moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near Shivaji Park, during this period, due to his hectic schedule.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/sachin/gulu1.htm |title=HTCricket.com: A special HTCricket section celebrating Sachin Tendulkar's 100th Test |work=Hindustan Times |accessdate=18 December 2012|author=Gulu Ezekiel|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121025205343/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/sachin/gulu1.htm|archivedate=25 October 2012|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
Meanwhile at school, he developed a reputation as a child prodigy.

==Early domestic career==

On 14 November 1987, Tendulkar was selected to represent Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy, India's premier domestic First-class cricket tournament, for the 1987–88 season. However, he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder. He narrowly missed out on playing alongside his idol Gavaskar, who had retired from all forms of cricket after the 1987 Cricket World Cup. A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged just 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Mumbai against Gujarat at home and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket. He was handpicked to play for the team by the then Mumbai captain Dilip Vengsarkar after watching him easily negotiating India's best fast bowler at the time, Kapil Dev, in the Wankhede Stadium nets, where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. He followed this by scoring a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments.[ref]

Wisden described his innings as "a disciplined display of immense maturity" and also wrote:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152030.html|title=Wisden – England v India 1990|publisher=Wisden Almanack|accessdate=17 August 2009|last=Otway|first=Graham[/tpl] 
 He looked the embodiment of India's famous opener, Gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads. While he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden Test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from the back foot. Though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short deliveries from the English pacemen. 
Tendulkar further enhanced his reputation as a future great during the 1991–92 tour of Australia held before the 1992 Cricket World Cup, that included an unbeaten 148 in the third Test at Sydney and 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final Test at Perth against a pace attack comprising Merv Hughes, Bruce Reid and Craig McDermott. Hughes commented to Allan Border at the time that "This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB."

===Rise through the ranks===

Tendulkar's performance through the years 1994–1999 coincided with his physical peak, in his early twenties. On the day of the Hindu festival Holi, Tendulkar was told to open the batting at Auckland against New Zealand in 1994.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/1993-94/IND_IN_NZ/IND_NZ_ODI2_27MAR1994.html |title=Ind v NZ 27 March 1994 match report |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=1 June 2008[/tpl] He went on to make 82 runs off 49 balls. He scored his first ODI century on 9 September 1994 against Australia in Sri Lanka at Colombo.[tpl]cite web|title=Sachin's First ODI Century|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/sachin/features/201096-sachin-tendulkars-odi-timeline-23-unforgettable-years|accessdate=18 December 2013[/tpl] It took him 79 ODIs to score his first century.
Tendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 World Cup, scoring two centuries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=722;type=tournament|title=Cricket Records – Wills World Cup, 1995/96|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=2 February 2010[/tpl] He was the only Indian batsman to perform in the semi-final against Sri Lanka.

After the World Cup, in the same year against Pakistan at Sharjah, Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin was going through a lean patch. Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu both made centuries to set a then record partnership for the second wicket. After getting out, Tendulkar found Azharuddin in two minds about whether he should bat.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] Tendulkar convinced Azharuddin to bat and Azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off just one over.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151296.html|title=Wisden - INDIA v PAKISTAN|accessdate=27 March 2014[/tpl] India went on to win that match.

This was the beginning of a period at the top of the batting world, culminating in the Australian tour of India in early 1998, with Tendulkar scoring three consecutive centuries. The focus was on the clash between Sachin Tendulkar, the world's most dominating batsman and Shane Warne, and the world's leading spinner, both at the peak of their careers, clashing in a full-fledged Test series after 7 long years.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] In the lead-up to the series, Tendulkar famously simulated scenarios in the nets with Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, the former India leg spinner, donning the role of Warne.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] In their tour opener, Australia faced the then Ranji Champions Mumbai at the Brabourne Stadium in a three-day first class match.[tpl]cite web| url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1997-98/AUS_IN_IND/AUS_BOM_24-26FEB1998.html|title=Australia in India, 1997-98-Mumbai v Australians-Brabourne Stadium, Mumbai-24,25,26 February 1998 (3-day match)|work=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=17 November 2013[/tpl] Tendulkar made an unbeaten 204 as Shane Warne conceded 111 runs in 16 overs and Australia lost the match within three days.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.cricketcountry.com/cricket-articles/When-Sachin-Tendulkar-showed-Shane-Warne-who-is-the-boss/23456 | title=When Sachin Tendulkar showed Shane Warne who is the boss | publisher=CricketCountry.com | date=25 February 2013 | accessdate=17 November 2013 | author=Nishad Pai Vaidya[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/99611.html | title=Tendulkar's duel with Warne symbolised India's superiority |work=ESPNcricinfo | date=24 February 2001 | accessdate=17 November 2013 | last=Ramchand|first=Partab[/tpl] These were characterised by a premeditated plan to target Australian spinners Shane Warne and Gavin Robertson, to whom he regularly charged down the pitch to drive over the infield.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] This technique worked as India beat Australia in the ensuing Test series as well.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] He also had a role with the ball in the five-match ODI series in India following the Tests, including a five wicket haul in an ODI in Kochi. Set 310 runs to win, Australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when Tendulkar turned the match for India, taking the wickets of Michael Bevan, Steve Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Tom Moody and Damien Martyn for just 32 runs in 10 overs.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1997-98/OD_TOURNEYS/PTC/IND_AUS_PTC_ODI1_01APR1998.html |title=Cricinfo Match Report, IND-AUS 1 April 1998 |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=1 June 2008[/tpl] The Test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in April 1998 in a Triangular cricket tournament in Sharjah – the first in a must-win game to take India to the finals and then again in the finals, both against Australia tormenting Shane Warne once again.

In the first match, Tendulkar was run out for nine after colliding with Pakistan bowler Shoaib Akhtar. Around 100,000 people came to support team India during the initial four days of the tournament.

In the historic Test against Pakistan at Chepauk in 1999, the first of a two-Test series, Sachin scored 136 in the fourth innings with India chasing 271 for victory.

===Captaincy===

Tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the Indian cricket team were not very successful. When Tendulkar took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations. However, by 1997 the team was performing poorly. Azharuddin was credited with saying "Nahin jeetega! Chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!",[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/2000/feb/05arm.htm |title=A tale of two captains |publisher=Rediff |accessdate=1 June 2008[/tpl] which translates into: "He won't win!

Tendulkar remained an integral part of the Indian team's strategic processes. He was often seen in discussion with the captain, at times actively involved in building strategies.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] Former captain Rahul Dravid publicly acknowledged that Tendulkar had been suggesting moves such as the promotion of Irfan Pathan up the batting order which, although only temporary, had an immediate effect on the team's fortunes.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] In 2007, Tendulkar was appointed vice-captain to captain Rahul Dravid.[tpl]failed verification|date=March 2014[/tpl] During the Indian team's 2007 tour of England, Dravid's desire to resign from the captaincy became known. The BCCI President Sharad Pawar personally offered the captaincy to Tendulkar. However, Tendulkar asked Pawar not to appoint him captain, instead recommending Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take over the reins. Pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting Tendulkar for first forwarding the name of Dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Tendulkar-suggested-Dhoni-s-name-Pawar/Article1-283717.aspx|title=Tendulkar suggested Dhoni's name: Pawar|newspaper=Hindustan Times |location=India|date=21 March 2008|accessdate=18 July 2010|agency=PTI|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130912043435/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/Chunk-HT-UI-Cricket-TopStories/Tendulkar-suggested-Dhoni-s-name-Pawar/Article1-283717.aspx|archivedate=12 September 2013|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

===Injuries and decline amid surpassing Bradman's haul===

Sachin Tendulkar continued performing well in Test cricket in 2001 and 2002, with some pivotal performances with both bat and ball. Tendulkar took three wickets on the final day of the famous Kolkata Test against Australia in 2001. Tendulkar took the key wickets of Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist, who were centurions in the previous Test.[tpl]cite web|title=2nd Test: India v Australia at Kolkata, Mar 11-15, 2001 | Cricket Scorecard | ESPN Cricinfo|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/63920.html|publisher=ESPNCricinfo|accessdate=18 December 2013[/tpl] In the five-match ODI series that followed, he took his 100th wicket in ODIs, claiming the wicket of then Australian captain Steve Waugh in the final match at the Fatorda Stadium in Goa.[tpl]cite news|title=Of Tendulkar and his Goa milestone|first=Niraj|last=Prabhu|newspaper=The Goan|page=28|date=16 November 2013|accessdate=27 March 2013|url=http://epaper.thegoan.net/185353/The-Goan-on-Saturday/November-16-2013#page/27/2[/tpl]
In the 2002 series in the West Indies, Tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in the first Test.

After getting out bowled on 3 similar instances against the New Zealand recently and hitting a slump in form, Tendulkar returned to the Ranji Trophy to get back some form ahead of the England Series at home, in a match for Mumbai against Railways on 2 November 2012.
All eyes were on Tendulkar, who was playing his first Ranji Trophy match since 2009.

In 2010 edition of Indian Premier League, Mumbai Indians reached the final of the tournament. Tendulkar made 618 runs in 14 innings during the tournament, breaking Shaun Marsh's record of most runs in an IPL season. He was declared player of the tournament for his performance during the season. He also won Best Batsman and Best Captain awards at 2010 IPL Awards ceremony.[tpl]cite web|title=Sachin breaks Shaun Marsh's IPL record for Most Runs scored in a single season and he also Received the Best Batsman and Best Captain Award|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/cricketnext/timeline-sachin-tendulkars-twenty20-journey/426812-78.html|publisher=IBN|accessdate=22 December 2013[/tpl]
Sachin Tendulkar captained Mumbai Indians in 4 league matches of second edition of the league. He scored 68 in the first match and 48 against Guyana. But Mumbai Indians failed to qualify for semifinals after losing the initial two matches. Tendulkar scored 135 runs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iplcricketlive.org/ipl/champions-league-t20-cricket/champions-league-teams/clt20-mumbai-indians/ |title=CLT20 Mumbai Indians | IPL Cricket Live, Season 5 IPL Cricket 2012, CLT20, IPL 2012 Schedule, IPL Fixtures, IPL Online, IPL Live, Champions League T20 Live Cricket |publisher=Iplcricketlive.org |accessdate=17 March 2012[/tpl]

==Style of play==

Tendulkar is cross-dominant: he bats, bowls and throws with his right hand, but writes with his left hand.[tpl]cite news|last=Sekhar|first=Senjam Raj|title=Fundamentals|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/tabloid/sunday-chronicle/leisure/fundamentals-772|accessdate=25 April 2012|newspaper=Deccan Chronicle|date=12 June 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Nostalgic Sachin recalls writing letters to wife Anjali|publication-date=27 February 2014|newspaper=O Heraldo|page=16|agency=PTI|quote=Tendulkar is a righthanded batsman but uses his left for writing.|url=http://www.epaperoheraldo.in/Details.aspx?id=14238&boxid=1511156&uid=&dat=02/27/2014|accessdate=29 March 2014[/tpl] He also practices left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis. Cricinfo columnist Sambit Bal has described him as the "most wholesome batsman of his time".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/35320.html|last=Bal|first=Sambit|title=Sachin Tendulkar—Cricinfo Profile|work=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=14 December 2007[/tpl] His batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes. He appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in India, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in South Africa and Australia. He is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square. He is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through. The straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot.[tpl]cite news | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-09-18/top-stories/30171553_1_sachin-tendulkar-straight-drive-india-england-test-series | title=Straight drive is my favourite shot, says Tendulkar | accessdate=23 September 2011 |work=The Times of India  | date=18 September 2011[/tpl] In 2008, Sunil Gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the AFP, remarked that "it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does".[tpl]Cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g1GRbImnh5S88rDMiES1YDRgx9yw |title=AFP: Tendulkar a special talent, says Gavaskar |publisher=Google |date=18 October 2008 |accessdate=27 November 2008[/tpl]
Sir Donald Bradman, considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered Tendulkar to have a batting style similar to his. In his biography, it is stated that "Bradman was most taken by Tendulkar's technique, compactness and shot production, and had asked his wife to have a look at Tendulkar, having felt that Tendulkar played like him. Bradman's wife, Jessie, agreed that they did appear similar."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/96323.html|title=Bradman never missed a Tendulkar innings in last five years|work=ESPNcricinfo|date=16 August 2001|accessdate=14 December 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=I dream of genius ... |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,766851,00.html|accessdate=26 April 2012|newspaper=Observer Sport Monthly|date=4 August 2002[/tpl]
Former Australian cricket team coach John Buchanan voiced his opinion that Tendulkar had become susceptible to the short ball early in his innings because of a lack of footwork.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Nov292007/sports2007112938408.asp|title=Buchanan spots Sachin's weakness!|work=Deccan Herald  |location=India|accessdate=14 December 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071202033513/http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Nov292007/sports2007112938408.asp  |archivedate = 2 December 2007[/tpl] Buchanan also believes Tendulkar has a weakness while playing left-arm pace. He was affected by a series of injuries since 2004. Since then Tendulkar's batting has tended to be less attacking. Explaining this change in his batting style, he has acknowledged that he is batting differently because, firstly, no batsman can bat the same way for the entire length of a long career and, secondly, he is a senior member of the team now and thus has more responsibility. During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball. Ian Chappell, former Australian player, remarked in 2007 that "Tendulkar now, is nothing like the player he was when he was a young bloke".
Tendulkar has incorporated several modern and unorthodox strokes into his repertoire, including the paddle sweep, the scoop over short fine leg and the slash to third man over the slips' heads, over the last seven or eight years. He is often praised for his ability to adapt to the needs of his body and yet keep scoring consistently.[tpl]cite web|title=Sachin incorporates several Unorthodox shots|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachinretirement/my-heart-feels-it-s-time-sachin-tendulkar-on-his-retirement/article1-1133449.aspx|work=Hindustan Times|accessdate=22 December 2013[/tpl] 
While Tendulkar is not a regular bowler, he can bowl medium pace, leg spin, and off spin. He often bowls when two batsmen of the opposite team have been batting together for a long period, as he can often be a useful partnership breaker.[tpl]cite web|title=Sachin can bowl Medium Pace , Off Spin and Leg Spin|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/he-could-do-anything-with-the-ball/1049474/|work=The Indian Express|accessdate=22 December 2013[/tpl] With his bowling, he has helped secure an Indian victory on more than one occasion.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2004-05/PAK_IN_IND/SCORECARDS/PAK_IND_ODI1_02APR2005.html| title=1st ODI: India v Pakistan at Kochi, 2 April 2005| publisher=ESPNcricinfo| accessdate=1 June 2008[/tpl] He has taken 201 international wickets – 46 in Tests, 154 in ODIs where he is India's tenth highest wicket taker, and one wicket in Twenty20 Internationals.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=11;team=6;template=results;type=bowling |title=Cricinfo Statsguru –All-Test- One-Day Internationals-Twenty20Internationals – Bowling records |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=21 July 2012[/tpl]

===Mike Denness incident===

In India's 2001 tour of South Africa in the second test match between India and South Africa at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth match referee Mike Denness fined four Indian players for excessive appealing as well as the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly for not controlling his team.[tpl]cite web| url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/england/content/story/108120.html |title=ICC Match Referee confirms disciplinary action for Indian cricketers |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=1 June 2008[/tpl] Tendulkar was given a suspended ban of one game by Mike Denness in light of alleged ball tampering.

===Ferrari import tax===

In commemorating Tendulkar's feat of equalling Don Bradman's 29 centuries in Test Cricket, automotive giant Ferrari invited Tendulkar to its paddock in Silverstone on the eve of the British Grand Prix on 23 July 2002, to receive a Ferrari 360 Modena from the F1 world champion Michael Schumacher.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2002/jul/23slide.htm |title=When Sachin met Schumacher|publisher=Rediff|accessdate=1 June 2008[/tpl] On 4 September 2002 India's then finance minister Jaswant Singh wrote to Tendulkar telling him that the government will waive customs duty imposed on the car as a measure to applaud his feat.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/125234.html |title=Indian government amended law for Sachin's Ferrari|publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=1 June 2008[/tpl] However the rules at the time stated that the customs duty can be waived only when receiving an automobile as a prize and not as a gift. It is claimed that the proposals to change the law (Customs Act) was put forth in Financial Bill in February 2003 and amended was passed as a law in May 2003. Subsequently the Ferrari was allowed to be brought to India without payment of the customs duty ([tpl]INRConvert|11.3|m[/tpl] or 120% on the car value of [tpl]INRConvert|.75|c[/tpl]).[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.rediff.com/cricket/2003/aug/09sach.htm |title= Tendulkar gets his Ferrari at last |publisher=Rediff|accessdate=1 June 2008[/tpl] When the move to waive customs duty became public in July 2003, political and social activists protested the waiver[tpl]cite web| url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/124860.html |title=Duty waiver for Tendulkar draws flak |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=1 June 2008[/tpl] and filed a PIL in the Delhi High Court.
