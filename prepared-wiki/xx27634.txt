[[Fox hunting]]

CATEGORIES: British society, Hunting with hounds, Fox hunting, Blood sports

Fox hunting is an activity involving the tracking, chase, and sometimes killing of a fox, traditionally a red fox, by trained foxhounds or other scent hounds, and a group of unarmed followers led by a master of foxhounds, who follow the hounds on foot or on horseback.[tpl]cite web|date=2000-06-09|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|authors=Lord Burns, Dr Victoria Edwards, Professor Sir Jon Marsh, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior; Professor Michael Winter|title=The Final Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Hunting with Dogs in England and Wales|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/mainsections/huntingreport.htm|accessdate=2008-02-10|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090410213249/http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/mainsections/huntingreport.htm|archivedate=2009-04-10[/tpl]
Fox hunting originated in the 16th century in the form which was practised until 2005 in Great Britain, but it also takes place all over the world, including in Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, and the United States.[tpl]cite book|last=Griffin|first=Emma|title=Blood Sport|year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press[/tpl][tpl]cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Fox hunting worldwide|date=1999-09-16|accessdate=2007-10-05|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/428122.stm[/tpl] In Australia, the term also refers to the hunting of foxes with firearms, similar to spotlighting or deer hunting. In much of the world hunting in general is understood to relate to any game animals or weapons (e.g., deer hunting with bow and arrow); in Britain and Ireland, "hunting" without qualification implies fox hunting (or other forms of hunting with hounds-beagling, stag hunting, mink hunting, drag hunting, or hunting the clean boot) as described here.
The sport is controversial, particularly in the UK, where its traditional form was banned in Scotland in 2002, and in England and Wales in November 2004 (law enforced from February 2005),[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4020453.stm|title=Hunt ban forced through Commons|publisher=BBC News|date=2004-11-19|accessdate=2008-02-22[/tpl] although certain modified forms of hunting foxes with hounds are still within the law, and shooting foxes as vermin also remains lawful.
Proponents of fox hunting view it as an important part of rural culture and useful for reasons of conservation and pest control,[tpl]cite web|year=2000|title=Social impact of fox hunting on rural communities|publisher=Masters of Fox Hounds Association|url=http://www.mfha.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=62&Itemid=58|accessdate=2007-10-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Creation and conservation of habitat by foxhunting|publisher=Masters of Fox Hounds Association|accessdate=2007-10-13|url=http://www.mfha.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=64&Itemid=56[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The need for wildlife management|publisher=Masters of Fox Hounds Association|url=http://www.mfha.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=65&Itemid=54|accessdate=2007-10-07[/tpl]  while opponents argue that it is cruel and unnecessary.[tpl]cite web|title=The morality of hunting with dogs|url=http://www.league.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_271.pdf|publisher=Campaign to Protect Hunted Animals|accessdate=2007-10-13|format=PDF[/tpl]

==History==

The use of scenthounds to track prey dates back to Assyrian, Babylonian, and ancient Egyptian times, and was known as venery.[tpl]cite news|publisher=The Guardian|date=2005-02-18 |title=Ten things you didn't know about hunting with hounds|last=Aslam|first=Dilpazier|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/feb/18/hunting.immigrationpolicy2|accessdate=2007-11-03 | location=London[/tpl]

===Europe===

Many Greek- and Roman- influenced countries have long traditions of hunting with hounds. Hunting with Agassaei hounds was popular in Celtic Britain, even before the Romans arrived, introducing the Castorian and Fulpine hound breeds which they used to hunt.[tpl]cite news|publisher=The Guardian|date=2005-02-18 |title=Ten things you didn't know about hunting with hounds | last = Aslam | first =D| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/feb/18/hunting.immigrationpolicy2|accessdate=2007-11-03 | location=London[/tpl] Norman hunting traditions were brought to Britain when William the Conqueror arrived, along with the Gascon and Talbot hounds.
Foxes were referred to as beasts of the chase by medieval times, along with the red deer (hart & hind), martens, and roes,[tpl]cite web|publisher=St John's College, Oxford|title=Forest and Chases in England and Wales c. 1000 to c.1850|url=http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/forests/glossary.htm|accessdate=2008-02-16[/tpl] but the earliest known attempt to hunt a fox with hounds was in Norfolk, England, in 1534, where farmers began chasing foxes down with their dogs for the purpose of pest control . The first use of packs specifically trained to hunt foxes was in the late 1600s, with the oldest fox hunt being, probably, the Bilsdale in Yorkshire.Jane Ridley, Fox Hunting: a history (HarperCollins, October 1990) By the end of the seventeenth century, deer hunting was in decline. The Inclosure Acts brought fences to separate formerly open land into many smaller fields, deer forests were being cut down, and arable land was increasing.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qVQiOYkBvV8C&pg=PA130&lpg=PA130&dq=%22Inclosure+Acts+%22+deer+hunting|publisher=Manchester University Press|title=Sport and the Making of Britain|author=Birley, D.|year=1993|accessdate=2008-02-14|pages=130–132|isbn=978-0-7190-3759-7[/tpl] With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, people began to move out of the country and into towns and cities to find work. Roads, railway lines, and canals all split hunting countries, but at the same time they made hunting accessible to more people. Shotguns were improved during the nineteenth century and the shooting of gamebirds became more popular. Fox hunting developed further in the eighteenth century when Hugo Meynell developed breeds of hound and horse to address the new geography of rural England.
In Germany, hunting with hounds (which tended to be deer or boar hunting) was first banned on the initiative of Hermann Göring on July 3, 1934. [tpl]cite news|publisher=The Telegraph|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1407954/Thanks-to-Hitler-hunting-with-hounds-is-still-verboten.html|title=Thanks to Hitler, hunting with hounds is still verboten|accessdate=2010-05-19|date=2002-09-22 | location=London | first1=David | last1=Harrison | first2=Tony | last2=Paterson[/tpl] In 1939, the ban was extended to cover Austria after Germany's annexation of the country. Bernd Ergert, the director of Germany's hunting museum in Munich, said of the ban, "The aristocrats were understandably furious, but they could do nothing about the ban given the totalitarian nature of the regime."

===United States===

According to the Masters of Foxhounds Association of America, Englishman Robert Brooke was the first man to import hunting hounds to America, bringing his pack of foxhounds to Maryland in 1650 along with his horses. Also around this time, numbers of European red foxes were introduced into the Eastern seaboard of North America for hunting.[tpl]cite web|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-541X(195801)22%3A1%3C45%3ATPSOEM%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z|author=Presnall, C.C.|title=The Present Status of Exotic Mammals in the United States |year=1958|accessdate=2008-02-21|publisher=The Journal of Wildlife Management, 22(1)|pages=45–50[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=%3A4%3C513%3ATSSOTN%3E2.0.CO%3B2-V|author=Churcher, C.S.|year=1959|title=The Specific Status of the New World Red Fox|publisher=Journal of Mammalogy, 40(4)|pages=513–520|accessdate=2008-02-21[/tpl] The first organised hunt for the benefit of a group (rather than a single patron) was started by Thomas, sixth Lord Fairfax in 1747.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mfha.com/abfo.htm#his|year=2008|title=History of American Foxhunting|publisher=Masters of Foxhounds of North America|accessdate=2008-02-10|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080603045754/http%3A//www.mfha.com/abfo.htm#his |archivedate = June 3, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] In the United States, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson both kept packs of fox hounds before and after the American Revolutionary War.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Explore DC|title=Profile - George Washington|year=2001|url=http://www.exploredc.org/index.php?id=69|accessdate=2007-11-14[/tpl][tpl]cite web|publisher=Freedom Fields Farm|title=A short history of foxhunting in Virginia|accessdate=2007-11-14|url=http://www.freedomfields.net/foxhunting_info.html[/tpl]

===Australia===

In Australia, the European red fox was introduced solely for the purpose of fox hunting in 1855.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Australian Conservation Foundation|title=Australia's Noah's Ark springs a leak|last=Eastham|first=Jaime|url=http://www.acfonline.org.au/news.asp?news_id=345&c=10032|accessdate=2008-02-10[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] Native animal populations have been very badly affected, with the extinction of at least 10 species attributed to the spread of foxes. Fox hunting with hounds is mainly practiced in the east of Australia.  In the state of Victoria there are thirteen hunts, with more than 1000 members between them.[tpl]cite news|publisher=Fairfax Digital|title=It's the thrill not the kill, they say|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Its-the-thrill-not-the-kill-they-say/2005/03/19/1111086058304.html?from=moreStories|date=2005-03-20|accessdate=2007-11-02 | location=Melbourne[/tpl] Fox hunting with hounds results in around 650 foxes being killed annually in Victoria, compared with over 90,000 shot over a similar period in response to a State government bounty.[tpl]cite news|publisher=Fairfax Digital|title=Bounty fails to win ground war against foxes|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/05/04/1051987602914.html|date=2003-05-05|accessdate=2007-11-02 | location=Melbourne[/tpl]

==Current status==

===United Kingdom===

The controversy around hunting led to the passing of the Hunting Act 2004 in November of that year, after a free vote in the House of Commons, which made "hunting wild mammals with a dog" (in the traditional style) unlawful in England and Wales from February 18, 2005.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2004/ukpga_20040037_en_1.htm|title=Hunting Act 2004|publisher=HMSO|accessdate=2008-02-12[/tpl] However, exemptions stated in Schedule 1 of the 2004 Act permit some previously unusual forms of hunting wild mammals with dogs to continue, such as "hunting... for the purpose of enabling a bird of prey to hunt the wild mammal".Stephen Moss, The banned rode on: Eighteen months ago hunting was banned. Or was it? from The Guardian'' dated 7 November 2006, at guardian.co.uk, accessed 29 April 2013
An amendment to the 2004 Act which would have allowed licensed traditional hunting under stricter conditions, advocated by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and some members of the government's independent inquiry on fox hunting (including its chairman Lord Burns[tpl]cite news|title=Historic deal offers reprieve for hunting|last=Ahmed|first=Kamal|coauthors=Barnett, Antony|date=2001-03-25|accessdate=2008-02-22|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2001/mar/25/hunting.immigrationpolicy|publisher=The Observer | location=London[/tpl]), was voted down.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2000/jan/24/hunting.ruralaffairs|author=Hencke, D.|title=Row over hunting inquiry 'bias'|date=2000-01-04|accessdate=2008-02-25|publisher=Guardian | location=London[/tpl] The passing of the Hunting Act was also notable in that it was implemented through the use of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 after the House of Lords refused to pass the legislation, despite the Commons passing it by a majority of 356 to 166.[tpl]cite news|publisher=CNN|title=Protesters storm UK parliament|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/09/15/fox.protest/|accessdate=2008-10-27|date=2004-09-16|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041118064259/http%3A//edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/09/15/fox.protest/ |archivedate = November 18, 2004|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Scotland, which has its own Parliament, restricted fox hunting in 2002, more than two years before the ban in England and Wales.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2002/asp_20020006_en_1|title=Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act|year=2002|publisher=HMSO|accessdate=2008-02-12[/tpl] Traditional fox hunting remains lawful in Northern Ireland.[tpl]cite news|title=Hain lambasted over website backing hunting|publisher=Belfast Telegraph|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/article2360161.ece|last=Hookham|first=Mark|date=2007-03-15|accessdate=2008-02-22|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070404204148/http%3A//www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/article2360161.ece |archivedate = April 4, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl][tpl]cite news|title=Northern Ireland bans hare coursing, and fox hunting could be next|date=2010-06-24|accessdate=2011-03-29|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland-bans-hare-coursing-and-fox-hunting-could-be-next-14852888.html[/tpl]
After the ban on fox hunting, hunts follow artificially laid trails, or use exemptions laid out in the Act, although the League Against Cruel Sports has alleged that breaches of law may be taking place by some hunts. Supporters of fox hunting claim that the number of foxes killed has increased since the Hunting Act came into force, both by the hunts (through lawful methods) and landowners, and that hunts have reported an increase in membership [tpl]cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4724028.stm|title='More foxes dead' since hunt ban|date=2006-02-17|accessdate=2007-10-13[/tpl] and that around 320,000 people (their highest recorded number) turned up to meets on Boxing Day 2006.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6209365.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Hunts hail Boxing Day turn-out|date=2006-12-26|accessdate=2007-10-13[/tpl]  The Master of Foxhounds association lists 179 active hunts as of February 2013. The Federation of Welsh Packs lists 56 member hunts, while the Central Committee of Fell Packs lists 6 member hunts (which hunt on foot in the Lake District and the surrounding region).

===United States===

In America, fox hunting is also called "fox chasing", as it is the practice of many hunts not to actually kill the fox (the red fox is not regarded as a significant pest). Some hunts may go without catching a fox for several seasons, despite chasing two or more foxes in a single day's hunting. Foxes are not pursued once they have "gone to ground" (hide in a hole). American fox hunters undertake stewardship of the land, and endeavour to maintain fox populations and habitats as much as possible. In many areas of the eastern United States, the coyote, a natural predator of the red and grey fox, is becoming more prevalent and threatens fox populations in a hunt's given territory. In some areas, coyote are considered fair game when hunting with foxhounds, even if they are not the intended species being hunted.
In 2013, the Masters of Foxhounds Association of North America listed 163 registered packs in the U.S. and Canada.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mfha.com/memb.htm|publisher=Masters of Foxhounds Association of North America|title=Geographical listing of hunts|year=2013|accessdate=2013-04-05[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] This number does not include the non-registered (also known as "farmer" or "outlaw") packs.[tpl]cite book|last=Smart|first=Bruce|title=A community of the horse|chapter=9|url=http://www.acommunityofthehorse.com/images/pdfs/ChapIX.pdf|year=2004|accessdate=2008-04-09|format=PDF[/tpl] Baily's Hunting Directory Lists 163 foxhound or draghound packs in the USA and 11 in Canada[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bailyshuntingdirectory.com/directory/|title=Directory of Hunts|publisher=Baily's Hunting Directory|accessdate=2013-04-05[/tpl] In some arid parts of the Western United States, where foxes in general are more difficult to locate, coyotes[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.arapahoehunt.com/history.asp|title=Arapahoe Hunt Club History|publisher=Arapahoe Hunt Club |accessdate=2008-02-12|year=2007[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] are hunted and, in some cases, bobcats.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.chronofhorse.com/index.php?cat=123009040576283|title=Recognized Hunts|publisher=Chronicle of the Horse|accessdate=2008-02-12[/tpl]

===Other countries===

The other main countries in which organised fox hunting with hounds is practiced are Ireland, Australia, France, Canada and Italy. There is one pack of foxhounds in Portugal, and one in India. Although there are 32 packs for the hunting of foxes in France, hunting tends to take place mainly on a small scale and on foot, with mounted hunts tending to hunt red or roe deer, or wild boar.[tpl]cite web|date=2000-06-09|publisher=Venerie|title=Venerie-the Organisation representing hunting with hounds in France |url=http://www.venerie.org/[/tpl]

====Coyote, gray fox, and other quarry====

Other species than the red fox may be the quarry for hounds in some areas.  The choice of quarry depends on the region and numbers available.
The coyote (Canis latrans) is a significant quarry for many Hunts in North America, particularly in the west and southwest, where there are large open spaces. The coyote is an indigenous predator that did not range east of the Mississippi River until the latter half of the 20th century.[tpl]cite journal|title=Status and management of coyote depredations in the Eastern United States|journal=US Department of Agriculture|last=Houben|first=JM|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&context=icwdmsheepgoat|year=2004|accessdate=2007-10-13[/tpl] The coyote is faster than a fox, running at [tpl]convert|65|km/h|mph||abbr=on[/tpl] and also wider ranging, with a territory of up to [tpl]convert|283|km2|sqmi[/tpl],[tpl]cite web|publisher=University of Michigan - Animal Diversity Web|title=Canis latrans (coyote)|last=Tokar|first=Eric|accessdate=2007-10-13|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Canis_latrans.html[/tpl] so a much larger hunt territory is required to chase it. However, coyotes tend to be less challenging intellectually, as they offer a straight line hunt instead of the convoluted fox line.  Coyotes can be challenging opponents for the dogs in physical confrontations, despite the size advantage of a large dog.  Coyotes have larger canine teeth and are generally more practised in hostile encounters.[tpl]cite book|author= Coppinger, Ray|title=Dogs: a Startling New Understanding of Canine Origin, Behavior and Evolution| year=2001|page=352|isbn=|publisher= Scribner|location= New York[/tpl]
The gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), a distant relative of the European red fox, is also hunted in North America. It is an adept climber of trees, making it harder to hunt with hounds.[tpl]cite web|publisher=University of Michigan - Animal Diversity Web|last=Jansa|first=Sharon|title=Urocyon cirereoargentus (gray fox)|accessdate=2007-10-13|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Urocyon_cinereoargenteus.html[/tpl] The scent of the gray fox is not as strong as that of the red, therefore more time is needed for the hounds to take the scent. Unlike the red fox which, during the chase, will run far ahead from the pack, the gray fox will speed toward heavy brush, thus making it more difficult to pursue. Also unlike the red fox, which occurs more prominently in the northern United States, the more southern gray fox is rarely hunted on horseback, due to its densely covered habitat preferences.
Hunts in the southern United States sometimes pursue the bobcat (Lynx rufus).  In countries such as India, and in other areas formerly under British influence, such as Iraq, the golden jackal (Canis aureus) is often the quarry.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Horse and Hound|title=Hurworth hound bound for India|url=http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/competitionnews/392/49235.html|date=2004-05-24|accessdate=2007-10-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Unusual features of RAF Habbaniya (Iraq)|url=http://www.habbaniya.org/Features.html|publisher=RAF Habbaniya Association|accessdate=2007-10-13[/tpl] During the British Raj, British sportsmen in India would hunt jackals on horseback with hounds as a substitute for the fox hunting of their native England. Unlike foxes, golden jackals were documented to be ferociously protective of their pack mates, and could seriously injure hounds.An Encyclopaedia of Rural Sports: Or a Complete Account, Historical, Practical, and Descriptive, of Hunting, Shooting, Fishing, Racing, and Other Field Sports and Athletic Amusements of the Present Day, Delabere Pritchett Blaine by Delabere Pritchett Blaine, published by Longman, Orme, Brown, Green and Longmans, 1840A monograph of the canidae by St. George Mivart, F.R.S, published by Alere Flammam. 1890 Jackals were not hunted often in this manner, as they were slower than foxes and could scarcely outrun greyhounds after 200 yards.The Sports Library Riding, Driving and Kindred Sports by T.

===Animals of the hunt===

====Hounds and other dogs====

Fox hunting is usually undertaken with a pack of scent hounds, and, in most cases, these are specially bred foxhounds.[tpl]cite web|publisher=American Kennel Club|title=English Foxhound History|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/english_foxhound/history.cfm|accessdate=2007-10-15[/tpl]
These dogs are trained to pursue the fox based on its scent. The two main types of foxhound are the English Foxhound[tpl]cite web|publisher=American Kennel Club|title=English Foxhound Breed Standard|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/english_foxhound/|accessdate=2007-10-15[/tpl] and the American Foxhound.[tpl]cite web|publisher=American Kennel Club|title=American Foxhound Breed Standard|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/american_foxhound/|accessdate=2007-10-15[/tpl] It is possible to use a sight hound such as a Greyhound or lurcher to pursue foxes,[tpl]cite web|publisher=American Kennel Club|title=Greyhound History|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/greyhound/history.cfm|accessdate=2007-10-15[/tpl] though this practice is not common in organised hunting,  and these dogs are more often used for coursing animals such as hares.[tpl]cite web|title=End of the road for illegal hare coursing|publisher=BBC Inside Out|date=2005-01-24|accessdate=2007-10-15|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/east/series7/hare_coursing.shtml[/tpl] There is also one pack of beagles in Virginia that hunt fox. They are unique in that they are the only hunting beagle pack in the U.S. to be followed on horseback. English Foxhounds are also used for hunting mink.
Hunts may also use terriers to flush or kill foxes that are hiding underground, as they are small enough to pursue the fox through narrow earth passages.
This is not practiced in the United States, as once the fox has gone to ground and is accounted for by the hounds, it is left alone.

====Horses====

The horses, called "field hunters" or hunters, ridden by members of the field, are a prominent feature of many hunts, although others are conducted on foot (and those hunts with a field of mounted riders will also have foot followers). Horses on hunts can range from specially bred and trained field hunters to casual hunt attendees riding a wide variety of horse and pony types.  Draft and Thoroughbred crosses are commonly used as hunters, although purebred Thoroughbreds and horses of many different breeds are also used.  Some hunts with unique territories favour certain traits in field hunters, for example, when hunting coyote in the western U.S., a faster horse with more stamina is required to keep up, as coyotes are faster than foxes and inhabit larger territories. Hunters must be well-mannered, have the athletic ability to clear large obstacles such as wide ditches, tall fences, and rock walls, and have the stamina to keep up with the hounds.

Dependent on terrain, and to accommodate different levels of ability, hunts generally have alternative routes that do not involve jumping.  The field may be divided into two groups, with one group, the First Field, that takes a more direct but demanding route that involves jumps over obstacles[tpl]cite web|title=Information and Guidelines for Foxhunters in the Field|publisher=Independence Foxhounds|year=2007|url=http://www.independencefoxhounds.com/protocol.html|accessdate=2008-01-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080308004907/http://www.independencefoxhounds.com/protocol.html |archivedate = 2008-03-08[/tpl] while another group, the Second Field (also called Hilltoppers or Gaters), takes longer but less challenging routes that utilise gates or other types of access on the flat.[tpl]cite web|title=Hunting Hounds and Polo Ponies|year=1998|publisher=JoCo History|url=http://www.jocohistory.net/culture/11no3hunting.asp|accessdate=2008-01-18[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl]

====Birds of prey====

In the United Kingdom, since the introduction of the hunting ban, a number of hunts have employed falconers to bring birds of prey to the hunt, due to the exemption in the Hunting Act for falconry.[tpl]cite news|publisher=The Guardian|title=The banned rode on|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/nov/07/hunting.ethicalliving|last=Moss|first=Stephen|accessdate=2007-10-05|date=2006-11-07 | location=London[/tpl] Many experts, such as the Hawk Board, deny that any bird of prey can reasonably be used in the British countryside to kill a fox which has been flushed by (and is being chased by) a pack of hounds.[tpl]Cite journal|author=McLeod, I.|year=2005|title=Birds of prey and the Hunting Act 2004|work=Justice of the Peace, 169|pages=774–775[/tpl]

==Procedure==

The hunt is often the setting for many social rituals, but the hunting itself begins when hounds are "cast" or put into rough or brushy areas called "coverts", where foxes often lay up during daylight hours. If the pack manages to pick up the scent of a fox, they will track it for as long as they are able. Scenting can be affected by temperature, humidity, and other factors. The hounds pursue the trail of the fox and the riders follow, by the most direct route possible. Since this may involve very athletic skill on the part of horse and rider alike, fox hunting is the origin of traditional equestrian sports including steeplechase[tpl]cite web|title=Steeplechase|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica Online|year=2008|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9069520/steeplechase|accessdate=2008-02-10[/tpl] and point to point racing.[tpl]cite web|title=A History of Point to Point|publisher=Irish Point to Point|year=2003|url=http://www.p2p.ie/content.php?key=History|accessdate=2011-11-06[/tpl]  The hunt continues until either the fox evades the hounds, goes to ground (that is takes refuge in an underground burrow or den) or is overtaken and usually killed by the hounds. In the case of Scottish hill packs or the gun packs of Wales and upland areas of England, the fox is flushed to guns. Foxhound packs in the Cumbrian fells and other upland areas are followed by supporters on foot rather than on horseback. In the UK, where the fox goes to ground, terriers may be entered into the earth to locate the fox so that it can be dug down to and killed, and this is carried out as a form of pest control.
Social rituals are important to hunts, although many have fallen into disuse. One of the most notable was the act of blooding. This is a very old ceremony in which the master or huntsman would smear the blood of the fox or coyote onto the cheeks or forehead of a newly initiated hunt follower, often a young child.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Icons - A portrait of Britain|title=Customs of Hunting|url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/fox-hunting-and-the-ban/features/customs-of-hunting-finished|year=2006|accessdate=2007-11-13[/tpl] Another practice of some hunts was to cut off the tail ('brush'), the feet ('pads') and the head ('mask') as trophies, with the carcass then thrown to the hounds.  Both of these practices were widely abandoned during the nineteenth century, although isolated cases may still have occurred to the modern day.

===Autumn or cub hunting===

In the autumn of each year (August–October in the UK and Ireland), hunts take the young hounds out cub hunting or autumn hunting in order to cull weaker young foxes (which are full size by autumn season as they are born in spring,Raymond Carr, English Fox Hunting: A History (London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1976) albeit not yet sexually mature until they are 10 months old and still living in their family group) and teach the young foxhounds to restrict their hunting to foxes.[tpl]cite web|title=A veterinary opinion on hunting with hounds, Submission to the Burns Inquiry|url=http://www.vet-wildlifemanagement.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=30&Itemid=32|author=Thomas, L.H. & Allen, W.R.|year=2000|accessdate=2007-11-20|publisher=Veterinary Association for Wildlife Management[/tpl]  The activity sometimes (and in some areas) takes place in the UK and Ireland as the practice of "holding up", which consists of hunt supporters surrounding a covert, with riders and foot followers to drive back foxes attempting to escape, and then "drawing" the covert with the puppies and some more experienced hounds, allowing them to find and catch foxes within the surrounded wood. A young hound is considered to be "entered" into the pack once he or she has successfully joined in a hunt in this fashion. Only rarely, in about 1 in 50 cases, foxhounds do not show suitable aptitude, and must be removed from the pack. They may be drafted to other packs, including minkhound packs.[tpl]cite web|title=Future of hound breeds under threat from hunting bill|year=2003|last=Fanshawe|url=http://www.mfha.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=9|publisher=Masters of Fox Hounds Association|accessdate=2008-02-11[/tpl]
In the U.S., some cubs are chased and allowed to escape to teach them better skills of evasion so that they may be tracked (preferably without being killed) again another day.[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2008[/tpl] Many foxes learn to evade the hounds by running up or down streams, running along the tops of fences, and other tactics to throw the hounds off the scent.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Masters of Foxhounds Association of North America|url=http://www.mfha.com/abfo.htm#att|title=American Foxhunting - Attire|accessdate=2008-10-18|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080603045754/http%3A//www.mfha.com/abfo.htm#att |archivedate = June 3, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

===Main hunting season===

Once the season proper starts (usually from early November in the northern hemisphere, or May in the southern hemisphere), the idea is to drive the fox from the covert and pursue the scent that it leaves for long distances over open countryside. The northern hemisphere season continues through to March or April.

===Drag, trail and bloodhound hunting===

Drag hunting, an equestrian sport which involves dragging an object over the ground to lay a scent for the hounds to follow,[tpl]cite web|title=What is drag hunting?|year=2008|publisher=North East Cheshire Drag Hunt|url=http://www.necdh.co.uk/WhatIsDragHunting.htm|accessdate=2008-02-11[/tpl] can also be popular, either instead of, or in addition to, live quarry hunting. Drag hunts are often considered to be faster, with followers not having to wait while the hounds pick up a scent, and often covering an area far larger than a traditional hunt,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/evidence/mdba.htm|title=The Masters of Draghounds and Bloodhounds Association, Submission to Burns Inquiry|year=2000|accessdate=2008-02-21|publisher=Defra|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080811140700/http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/evidence/mdba.htm|archivedate=2008-08-11[/tpl] which may even necessitate a change of horses half way through.[tpl]cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Hunting humans, not foxes|date=1999-09-20|accessdate=2008-02-17|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/417435.stm[/tpl] A non-equestrian variation, hound trailing, is practised in the Lake District.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.houndtrailing.org.uk/|title=Hound Trailing|publisher=Hound Trailing Association|accessdate=2008-03-11[/tpl] Since the UK hunting ban, hunts are using a mixture of an odoriferous substance with an oil in order to improve the persistence of the scent trail, and then to lay the scent about 20 minutes in advance of the hunt.[tpl]Cite book|author=Bloomfield, R.|title=All about drag hunting|publisher=Horse & Hound|date=2005-01-07[/tpl] Bloodhounds are also used to hunt a human runner in the sport of Hunting the Clean Boot.[tpl]cite web|title=Drag Hunting|publisher=New Forest Drag Hunt|url=http://www.nfdh.org.uk/draghunting.html|accessdate=2008-02-11[/tpl]

==People==

===Hunt staff and officials===

As a social ritual, participants in a fox hunt fill specific roles, the most prominent of which is the master, often more than one and then called masters or joint masters. These individuals typically take much of the financial responsibility for the overall management of the sporting activities of the hunt and the care and breeding of the hunt's fox hounds, as well as control and direction of its paid staff.
In addition to members of the hunt staff, a committee may run the Hunt Supporters Club to organise fundraising and social events and in America many hunts are incorporated and have parallel lines of leadership.
Britain, Ireland and America each have a Masters of Foxhounds Association (MFHA) which consists of current and past masters of foxhounds. This is the governing body for all foxhound packs and deals with disputes about boundaries between hunts, as well as regulating the activity.

===Attire===

Mounted hunt followers typically wear traditional hunting attire. A prominent feature of hunts operating during the formal hunt season (usually November to March in the northern hemisphere) is hunt members wearing 'colours'. This attire usually consists of the traditional red coats worn by huntsmen, masters, former masters, whippers-in (regardless of sex), other hunt staff members and male members who have been invited to wear colours as a mark of honour. Since the Hunting Act in England and Wales, only Masters and Hunt Servants tend to wear red coats or the hunt livery whilst out hunting. Gentleman subscribers tend to wear black coats, with or without hunt buttons. Ladies generally wear coloured collars on their black or navy coats. These help them stand out from the rest of the field.
The traditional red coats are often misleadingly called "pinks". Various theories about the derivation of this term have been given, ranging from the colour of a weathered scarlet coat to the name of a purportedly famous tailor.[tpl]cite web|last=Reeds|first=Jim|url=http://www.horse-country.com/jriders/pink.html|publisher=horse-country.com|title=The Legend of Tailor Pink|date=2003-12-07|accessdate=2007-10-13[/tpl][tpl]cite web|publisher=Icons - A portrait of Britain|title=Hunting Fashion|url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/fox-hunting-and-the-ban/features/hunting-fashion|date=July 2006|accessdate=2007-11-14[/tpl]
Some hunts, including most harrier and beagle packs, wear green rather than red jackets. The colour of breeches vary from hunt to hunt and are generally of one colour, though two or three colours throughout the year may be permitted.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Beech Grove Hunt|url=http://www.beechgrovehunt.com/etiquette.shtml|title=Dress Code|accessdate=2007-11-14|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071104000503/http%3A//www.beechgrovehunt.com/etiquette.shtml |archivedate = November 4, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl]  Boots are generally English dress boots (no laces). For the men they are black with brown leather tops (called tan tops), and for the ladies, black with a patent black leather top of similar proportion to the men. Additionally, the number of buttons is significant. The Master wears a scarlet coat with four brass buttons while the huntsman and other professional staff wear five. Amateur whippers-in also wear four buttons.
Another differentiation in dress between the amateur and professional staff is found in the ribbons at the back of the hunt cap. The professional staff wear their hat ribbons down, while amateur staff and members of the field wear their ribbons up.[tpl]cite web|title=Dress Code|publisher=RMA Sandhurst Draghunt|year=2008|url=http://www.sandhurstdraghunt.co.uk/dress.html|accessdate=2007-12-22|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080314000035/http%3A//www.sandhurstdraghunt.co.uk/dress.html |archivedate = March 14, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
Those members not entitled to wear colours, dress in a black hunt coat and unadorned black buttons for both men and ladies, generally with pale breeches. Boots are all English dress boots and have no other distinctive look. Some hunts also further restrict the wear of formal attire to weekends and holidays and wear ratcatcher (tweed jacket and tan breeches), at all other times.
Other members of the mounted field follow strict rules of clothing etiquette. For example, those under eighteen will wear ratcatcher all season. Those over eighteen will wear ratcatcher during Autumn hunting from late August until the Opening Meet, normally around November 1. From the Opening Meet they will switch to formal hunting attire where entitled members will wear scarlet and the rest black or navy. The highest honour is to be awarded the hunt button by the Hunt Master. This means one can then wear scarlet if male, or the hunt collar if female (colour varies from hunt to hunt) and buttons with the hunt crest on them. All members of the mounted field should carry a hunting whip (it should not be called a crop). These have a horn handle at the top and a long leather lash (2-3 yards) ending in a piece of coloured cord. Generally all hunting whips are brown, except those of Hunt Servants, whose whips are white.

==Controversy==

The nature of fox hunting, including the killing of the quarry animal and its strong associations with tradition and social class and its practice for sport have made it a source of great controversy within the United Kingdom. In December 1999, the then Home Secretary, Jack Straw MP, announced the establishment of a Government inquiry (the Burns Inquiry) into hunting with dogs, to be chaired by the retired senior civil servant Lord Burns. The inquiry was to examine the practical aspects of different types of hunting with dogs and its impact, how any ban might be implemented and the consequences of any such ban.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/mainsections/committeedetails/aboutus.htm|title=Background to the Inquiry|author=Committee of Inquiry into Hunting with Dogs|year=1999|accessdate=2008-02-12|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090407134938/http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/mainsections/committeedetails/aboutus.htm|archivedate=2009-04-07[/tpl]
Amongst its findings, the Burns Inquiry committee analysed opposition to hunting in the UK and reported that:
Anti-hunting activists who choose to take action in opposing fox hunting can do so through lawful means, such as campaigning for fox hunting legislation and monitoring hunts for cruelty. Some use unlawful means.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.league.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1704|publisher=League Against Cruel Sports|title=Hunt Crimewatch|accessdate=2008-02-12[/tpl] Main anti-hunting campaign organisations include the RSPCA and the League Against Cruel Sports.  In 2001, the RSPCA took high court action to prevent pro-hunt activists joining in large numbers to change the society's policy in opposing hunting.[tpl]cite news|publisher=The Telegraph|date=2001-06-19|title=RSPCA wins right to block hunt lobby|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1319660/RSPCA-wins-right-to-block-hunt-lobby.html|accessdate=2008-10-27 | location=London[/tpl]
Outside of campaigning, some activists choose to engage in direct intervention such as the sabotage of the hunt.[tpl]cite web|url=http://hsa.enviroweb.org/tactics/tactbook/tactics.html|publisher=Hunt Saboteurs Association|title=HSA hunt tactics book|accessdate=2008-02-12[/tpl] Hunt sabotage is unlawful in a majority of the United States, and some tactics used in it (such as trespass and criminal damage) are offences there and in other countries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.huntsab.org/hunter_harassment_laws.htm|title=Hunter Harassment Laws|publisher=American Hunt Saboteurs Association|accessdate=2008-02-12[/tpl]
Fox hunting with hounds has been happening in Europe since at least the 16th century, and strong traditions have built up around the activity, as have related businesses, rural activities, and hierarchies. For this reason, there are large numbers of people who support fox hunting and this can be for a variety of reasons.

===Pest control===

Foxes are considered vermin by the law of England and Wales and also in some other countries, and some farmers fear the loss of their smaller livestock,[tpl]cite web|author=Countryside Alliance|title=Submission to the Burns Inquiry|year=2000|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/evidence/alliance.htm|publisher=Defra|accessdate=2007-11-14[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] while others consider them an ally in controlling rabbits, voles, and other rodents, which eat crops.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/evidence2/drryder.htm|author= Ryder, R.|year=2000|publisher=Defra|title=Submission to the Burns Inquiry|accessdate=2008-02-11[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] A key reason for dislike of the fox by pastoral farmers is their tendency to commit acts of surplus killing toward animals such as chickens, yet having killed many they eat only one.[tpl]cite journal|last=Kruuk|first=H|title=Surplus killing by carnivores|year=1972|journal=Journal of Zoology, London|volume=166|pages=435–50[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Baldwin|first=Marc|title=Red Fox Vulpes vulpes:Food & Feeding|publisher=Wildlife Online|date=2007-04-29|accessdate=2008-02-22|url=http://www.wildlifeonline.me.uk/red_fox.html#feeding[/tpl]  Some anti-hunt campaigners maintain that provided it is not disturbed, the fox will remove all of the chickens it kills and conceal them in a safer place.[tpl]cite web|publisher=National Fox Welfare Society|title=Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) General description|url=http://www.nfws.org.uk/fox_info.html|accessdate=2008-04-13[/tpl]
Opponents of fox hunting claim that the activity is not necessary for fox control, arguing that the fox is not a pest species and that hunting does not and cannot make a real difference to fox populations.[tpl]cite web|publisher=International Fund for Animal Welfare|url=http://www.ifaw.org/ifaw/general/default.aspx?oid=158534|title=New research explodes myth that hunting with gun-packs controlled foxes in Wales|year=2006|accessdate=2008-02-11|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080620022132/http%3A//www.ifaw.org/ifaw/general/default.aspx%3Foid%3D158534 |archivedate = June 20, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] They compare the number of foxes killed in the hunt to the many more killed on the roads. They also argue that wildlife management goals of the hunt can be met more effectively by other methods such as lamping (dazzling a fox with a bright light, then shooting by a competent shooter using an appropriate weapon and load).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/evidence2/deadline20002.htm#research|author=Deadline 2000|year=2000|title=Submission to Burns Inquiry|accessdate=2008-02-12|publisher=Defra[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl]
The hunts claim to provide and maintain a good habitat for foxes and other game, and, in the U.S., have been leaders in fostering conservation legislation and putting land into conservation easements. Anti-hunting campaigners cite the widespread existence of artificial earths and the historic practice by hunts of introducing foxes, as indicating that hunts do not believe foxes to be pests.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/evidence/league.htm|author=League Against Cruel Sports|title=Submission to Burns Inquiry|year=2000|accessdate=2008-02-11|publisher=Defra[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl]
It is also argued that hunting with dogs has the advantage of weeding out old, sick, and weak animals because the strongest and healthiest foxes are those most likely to escape. Therefore, unlike other methods of controlling the fox population, it is argued that hunting with dogs resembles natural selection.  The counter-argument is given that hunting cannot kill old foxes because foxes have a natural death rate of 65% per annum.
In Australia, where foxes have played a major role in the decline in the number of species of wild animals, the Government's Department of the Environment and Heritage concluded that "hunting does not seem to have had a significant or lasting impact on fox numbers." Instead, control of foxes relies heavily on shooting, poisoning and fencing.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/european-red-fox.html|year=2004|title=European Red Fox Fact Sheet|publisher=Environment Department, Australian Government|accessdate=2010-04-19|format=PDF[/tpl]

===Economics===

As well as the economic defence of fox hunting that it is necessary to control the population of foxes, lest they cause economic cost to the farmers, it is also argued that fox hunting is a significant economic activity in its own right, providing recreation and jobs for those involved in the hunt and supporting it.  The Burns Inquiry identified that between 6,000 and 8,000 full-time jobs depend on hunting in the UK, of which about 700 result from direct hunt employment and 1,500 to 3,000 result from direct employment on hunting-related activities.
Since the ban in the UK, there has been no evidence of significant job losses, and hunts have continued to operate along limited lines, either trail hunting, or claiming to use exemptions in the legislation.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/opinion/Simon-Hart-Hounding-out-a.3619917.jp|author=Simon Hart|title=Hounding out a law that's failed in every way|date=2007-12-26|accessdate=2008-02-11|publisher=Yorkshire Post[/tpl]

===Animal welfare and animal rights===

Many animal welfare groups, campaigners and activists believe that fox hunting is unfair and cruel to animals. They argue that the chase itself causes fear and distress and that fox is not always killed instantly as is claimed. Animal rights campaigners also object to fox hunting, on the grounds that animals should enjoy some basic rights (such as the right to freedom from exploitation and the right to life).[tpl]cite web|publisher=Uncaged|title=The universal declaration of animal rights|year=2006|url=http://www.uncaged.co.uk/declarat.htm|accessdate=2007-11-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|publisher=People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)|title=General FAQs|url=http://www.peta.org/about/faq.asp|accessdate=2007-11-03[/tpl]
In the United States and Canada, pursuing the quarry for the sheer purpose of killing is strictly forbidden by the Masters of Foxhounds Association. According to article 2 of the organisation's code:
There are times when a fox or coyote that is injured or sick is caught by the pursuing hounds, but hunts say that the occurrence of an actual kill of this is exceptionally rare.
Supporters of hunting maintain that when a fox is hunted, it is either killed relatively quickly (instantly or in a matter of seconds) or escapes uninjured. Similarly, they say that the animal rarely endures hours of torment and pursuit by hounds, and research by Oxford University shows that the fox is normally killed after only an average of 17 minutes of chase.[tpl]cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Is fox hunting cruel?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/418681.stm|date=1999-09-16|accessdate=2007-11-03[/tpl] They further argue that, while hunting with hounds may cause suffering, controlling fox numbers by other means is even more cruel. Depending on the skill of the shooter, the type of firearm used, the availability of good shooting positions and luck, shooting foxes can cause either an instant kill, or lengthy periods of agony for wounded animals which can die of the trauma within hours, or of secondary infection over a period of days or weeks. Research from wildlife hospitals, however, indicates that it is not uncommon for foxes with minor shot wounds to survive. [tpl]cite web|author=Baker, P., Harris, S. & White, P.|publisher=International Fund for Animal Welfare|title=After the hunt, the future of foxes in Britain|url=http://www.ifaw.org/ifaw/dimages/custom/After%20the%20Hunt%20(Web%20final%20Feb).pdf|accessdate=2007-11-25|format=PDF|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071127073352/http%3A//www.ifaw.org/ifaw/dimages/custom/After%2520the%2520Hunt%2520%28Web%2520final%2520Feb%29.pdf |archivedate = November 27, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] Hunt supporters further say that it is a matter of humanity to kill foxes rather than allow them to suffer malnourishment and mange.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/evidence/hunts/fourburrow.htm|author=Four Burrows Hunt|title=Submission to Burns Inquiry|year=2000|accessdate=2008-02-12|publisher=Defra[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl]
Other methods include the use of snares, trapping and poisoning, all of which also cause considerable distress to the animals concerned, and may affect other species.   This was considered in the Burns Inquiry (paras 6.60–11), whose tentative conclusion was that lamping using rifles fitted with telescopic sights, if carried out properly and in appropriate circumstances, had fewer adverse welfare implications than hunting. The committee believed that lamping was not possible without vehicular access, and hence said that the welfare of foxes in upland areas could be affected adversely by a ban on hunting with hounds, unless dogs could be used to flush foxes from cover (as is permitted in the Hunting Act 2004).
Some opponents of hunting criticise the fact that the animal suffering in fox hunting takes place for sport, citing either that this makes such suffering unnecessary and therefore cruel, or else that killing or causing suffering for sport is immoral.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.league.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_336.pdf|year=2006|author=Linzey, A.|publisher=Christian Socialist Movement|title=Fox Hunting|accessdate=2008-02-11|format=PDF[/tpl] The Court of Appeal, in considering the British Hunting Act determined that the legislative aim of the Hunting Act was "a composite one of preventing or reducing unnecessary suffering to wild mammals, overlaid by a moral viewpoint that causing suffering to animals for sport is unethical."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2006/817.html|title=R.

Anti-hunting campaigners also criticised UK hunts of which the Burns Inquiry estimated that foxhound packs put down around 3,000 hounds, and the hare hunts killed around 900 hounds per year, in each case after the hounds' working life had come to an end.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/evidence2/hounds.htm|author=Fanshawe, B.|title=Details of number of hounds involved in hunting, Campaign for Hunting submission to Burns Inquiry|date=2000-05-17|publisher=Defra|accessdate=2008-02-18[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/evidence2/amhbmbhanccalc.htm|publisher=Defra|year=2000|accessdate=2008-04-10|title=The Hare Hunting Associations, submission to Burns Inquiry|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080824020711/http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/evidence2/amhbmbhanccalc.htm|archivedate=2008-08-24[/tpl]

===Civil liberties===

It is argued by some hunt supporters that no law should curtail the right of a person to do as they wish, so long as it does not harm others. Philosopher Roger Scruton has said, "To criminalise this activity would be to introduce legislation as illiberal as the laws which once deprived Jews and Catholics of political rights, or the laws which outlawed homosexuality".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/evidence/scruton.htm|title=Fox Hunting: The Modern Case.

===Trespass===

In its submission to the Burns Inquiry, the League Against Cruel Sports presented evidence of over 1,000 cases of trespass by hunts. These included trespass on railway lines and into private gardens. Trespass can occur as the hounds cannot recognise human-created boundaries they are not allowed to cross, and may therefore follow their quarry wherever it goes unless successfully called off.  However, in the United Kingdom, trespass is a largely civil matter when performed accidentally.
Nonetheless, in the UK, the criminal offence of 'aggravated trespass' was introduced in 1994 specifically to address the problems caused to fox hunts and other field sports by hunt saboteurs.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Free Beagles|url=http://freebeagles.org/articles/Legal_Booklet_4/lb4-21.html|title=Legal advice for activists[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl]  Hunt saboteurs trespass on private land to monitor or disrupt the hunt, as this is where the hunting activity takes place. For this reason, the hunt saboteur tactics manual presents detailed information on legal issues affecting this activity, especially the Criminal Justice Act.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Hunt Saboteurs Association|title=Legal advice on Public Order and trespass|url=http://hsa.enviroweb.org/tactics/tactbook/legal.html|accessdate=2007-11-03[/tpl] Some hunt monitors also choose to trespass whilst they observe the hunts in progress.[tpl]cite journal|author = Stokes, Elizabeth |title = Hunting and Hunt Saboteurs: A Censure Study|year=1996|url=http://www.uel.ac.uk/lss/staff/elizabethstokes/elizabethstokes/|accessdate=2011-12-20[/tpl]
The construction of the law means that hunt saboteurs' behaviour may result in charges of criminal aggravated trespass,[tpl]cite web|publisher=Crown Prosecution Service|title=Trespass and Nuisance on Land: Legal Guidance| url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/trespass_and_nuisance_on_land/#Aggravated_Trespass_Charging[/tpl] rather than the less severe offence of civil trespass.[tpl]cite web|author=Countryside Alliance and the Council of Hunting Associations|title=Hunting without Harassment|year=2006|url=http://heythrophunt.com/picts/huntinghandbook.pdf|accessdate=2011-12-20|publisher=Countryside Alliance|format=PDF[/tpl]  Since the introduction of legislation to restrict hunting with hounds, there has been a level of confusion over the legal status of hunt monitors or saboteurs when trespassing, as if they disrupt the hunt whilst it is not committing an illegal act (as all the hunts claim to be hunting within the law) then they commit an offence, however if the hunt was conducting an illegal act then the criminal offence of trespass may not have been committed.

===Available alternatives===

Anti hunting campaigners long urged hunts to retain their tradition and equestrian sport by drag hunting, following an artificial scent.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.henrysalt.co.uk/bs_drag_hunts.htm|author=Salt, H.|title=Drag Hunting Verses Stag Hunting|year=1915|work=Killing for Sport|accessdate=2008-02-11|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080305211816/http%3A//www.henrysalt.co.uk/bs_drag_hunts.htm |archivedate = March 5, 2008|deadurl=yes[/tpl] However, drag hunting is disliked by some advocates of quarry hunting because the trail is pre-determined, thereby eliminating the uncertainty present in the live quarry hunt and because they tend to be faster. Supporters contend that while drag hunts can be fast, this need not be the case if the scent line is broken up so that the hounds have to search an area to pick up the line.
Hunt supporters previously claimed that, in the event of a ban, hunts would not be able to convert and that many hounds would have to be put down.

===Social life and class issues in the UK===

In the UK, supporters of fox hunting regard it as a distinctive part of British culture generally, the basis of traditional crafts and a key part of social life in rural areas, an activity and spectacle enjoyed not only by the riders but also by others such as the unmounted pack which may follow along on foot, bicycle or 4x4. They see the social aspects of hunting as reflecting the demographics of the area; the Home Counties packs, for example, are very different from those in North Wales and Cumbria, where the hunts are very much the activity of farmers and the working class. The Banwen Miners Hunt has been used as an example, founded in a small Welsh mining village, although its membership now is by no means limited to miners, with a cosmopolitan make up.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.banwenminershunt.co.uk/page2.htm|title=Banwen Miners Hunt History|publisher=The Banwen Miners Hunt|accessdate=2011-12-20[/tpl]
Oscar Wilde, in his 1893 play A Woman of No Importance, once famously referred to "the English country gentleman galloping after a fox" as "the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable."[tpl]cite web|publisher=Bibliomania|title=Oscar Wilde|url=http://www.bibliomania.com/0/2/57/frameset.html|accessdate=2007-11-16[/tpl]  Even before the time of Wilde, much of the criticism of fox hunting has been couched in terms of social class. They argue that while more "working class" blood sports such as cock fighting and badger baiting were long ago outlawed,[tpl]cite web|publisher=Icons- a portrait of England|title=Banned Blood Sports|url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/fox-hunting-and-the-ban/features/banned-blood-sports|year=2006|accessdate=2007-11-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Jackson|first=Steve|publisher=Badger Pages|title=Badger Baiting|url=http://www.badgers.org.uk/badgerpages/eurasian-badger-11.html|year=2006|accessdate=2007-11-05[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] fox hunting persists, although this argument can be countered with the fact that hare coursing, a more "working class" sport was outlawed simultaneously to fox hunting with hounds in the UK.  Philosopher Roger Scruton believes that the analogy with cock fighting and badger baiting is unfair because these sports were more cruel and did not involve any element of pest control.

==In popular culture==

Fox hunting has inspired artists in several fields to create works which involve the sport.  The most famous usage is in the Daniel P. Mannix 1967 novel titled The Fox and the Hound which follows a story of a fox called Tod and a hound called Copper. This story was subsequently used by Walt Disney Pictures to create the animated feature length film The Fox and the Hound in 1981,[tpl]cite web|publisher=Internet Movie Database|title=The Fox and the Hound (1981)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082406/|accessdate=2007-11-16[/tpl] although the film differs from the novel in that Tod and Copper befriend each other and survive as friends.[tpl]cite journal|title=Disney's The Fox and the Hound: The Coming of the Next Generation|journal=Animation World Magazine|volume=3|issue=8|date=November 1998|accessdate=2008-02-17|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.8/3.8pages/3.8sitofox.html[/tpl] Other children's books which involve fox characters becoming involved with a hunt or being hunted include The Animals of Farthing Wood,[tpl]cite book|last=Dann|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Dann|title=The Animals of Farthing Wood|publisher=Hutchinson|date=November 1979|isbn=[/tpl] and Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr Fox. Poet Laureate John Masefield wrote "Reynard the Fox", a poem about a fox hunt in rural England in which the title character escapes.  In a Conan Doyle story, the French officer Brigadier Gerard joins an English fox hunt, but commits the unpardonable sin of slaying the fox with his sabre.  Author Rita Mae Brown has authored a series of fox-hunting mysteries starring "Sister" Jane Arnold, starting with Outfoxed in 2000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ritamaebrown.com/content/books_ja.asp|title=The 'Sister' Jane Foxhunting mysteries|publisher=RitaMaeBrown.com|accessdate=2009-01-28[/tpl] In real life, Brown is the master of the Oak Ridge Fox Hunt Club.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oakridgefoxhuntclub.com |title=Oak Ridge Fox Hunt Club |accessdate=2009-01-28 [/tpl]
There have also been several musical artists who have used fox hunting, with both Ray Noble and George Formby recording "Tan Tan Tivvy Tally Ho!", a comic song about fox hunting, in 1932 and 1938 respectively.[tpl]cite web|title=George Formby Discography|url=http://www.prideofmanchester.com/music/GeorgeFormby-discography3.htm|publisher=George Formby: Pride of Manchester|accessdate=2008-02-11[/tpl]  More recently Dizzee Rascal used the concept of a fox-hunt for his video of "Sirens", showing a stylised urban hunt.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Pitchfork|title=Video:Dizzee Rascal: Sirens|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/42113-dizzee-rascal-sirens-|accessdate=2007-11-16|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071217102453/http%3A//www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/42113-dizzee-rascal-sirens- |archivedate = December 17, 2007|deadurl=yes[/tpl] The foxhunt is a prominent feature of the 1963 movie The List of Adrian Messenger.
