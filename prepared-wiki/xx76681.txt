[[Music of Moldova]]

CATEGORIES: Moldovan music, Balkan music

Moldovan music is closely related to that of its neighbour and cultural kin, Romania.  Moldovan folk is known for swift, complex rhythms (a characteristic shared with many Eastern European traditions), musical improvisation, syncopation and much melodic ornamentation.[tpl]cite web|title=Folk Music of Moldova - Sound Clip - MSN Encarta|url=http://encarta.msn.com/media_681500051/Folk_Music_of_Moldova.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kx7hfFdc|archivedate=2009-11-01|deadurl=yes[/tpl]  Pop, hip hop, rock and other modern genres have their own fans in Moldova as well.  Modern pop stars include O-Zone, a Romanian and Moldovan band whose "Dragostea din tei" was a major 2004 European hit, guitarist and songwriter Vladimir Pogrebniuc, Natalia Barbu, who is well known in Germany, Romania and Ukraine, and Nelly Ciobanu.  The band Flacai became well known in the 1970s across Moldova, turning their hometown of Cahul into an important center of music.http://cahulfest.iatp.md/faces.html

During the Soviet era, Moldovan folk culture flourished, and was strongly promoted by the government.  However, many elements were altered to obscure the shared history of Romania and Moldova, because the Soviet Union wanted to discourage secession.[tpl]cite web|title=Moldova - MSN Encarta|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566942/Moldova.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kx6V9c1q|archivedate=2009-11-01|deadurl=yes[/tpl]
