XO-3b is an exoplanet with about 11.79 times the mass of Jupiter, and an orbit around its parent star in about 3.2 days.Oddball Planet Puzzles Astronomers, Space.com The radius of this object is 1.217 times that of Jupiter. Astronomers announced their discovery on May 30, 2007, at the American Astronomical Society in Honolulu, Hawaii. Its discovery is attributed to the combined effort of amateur and professional astronomers working together on the XO Project using a telescope located on the Haleakala summit in Hawaii.Space oddity: Astronomers discover giant planet, The Times of India
Dubbed an "oddball" planet, the planet stands out from over 350 other extrasolar planets as the most massive planet found in close proximity to a star, yet the orbit is significantly elliptical instead of circular, as would be expected. It is also considered a transiting planet, passing in front of its parent star during each orbit. It is the third such planet to be found by the XO Project which was specifically created to locate them.XO-3 b: Supersized planet or oasis in the 'brown dwarf desert'?, EurekAlert!

==Orbital inclination==

Measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect allow a determination of the angle between the planet's orbital plane and the equator of the parent star. Initial reports suggested this angle was very large, at 70 ± 15 degrees,[tpl]cite journal | title=Misaligned spin-orbit in the XO-3 planetary system? | author=Hébrard, G. et al. | journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume=488 | issue=2 | year=2008 | pages=763–770 | bibcode=2008A&A...488..763H | doi=10.1051/0004-6361:200810056|arxiv = 0806.0719 [/tpl](web preprint) which is significantly larger than that of the other transiting planets for which this measurement has been made.[tpl]cite journal | title= Measuring accurate transit parameters | author=Joshua N.

This value is however still larger than the misalignment between the Sun's equator and the orbital plane of Jupiter, which is only 6°.
The misalignment may indicate that in the past an encounter with another planet altered its orbit, kicking it out of the plane of the planetary system.[tpl]cite news|url=http://space.newscientist.com/article/mg19926744.400-planets-strange-orbit-points-to-planetary-billiards.html|title=Planet's strange orbit points to planetary billiards|author=Powell, Devin|date=2008-09-22|work=New Scientist|accessdate=2008-09-23[/tpl] Another planetary system that may have also undergone such planet-planet interactions is Upsilon Andromedae.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/cdsbib?2005Natur.434..873F|author=Ford, E. et al.|title=Planet-planet scattering in the upsilon Andromedae system|journal=Nature|volume=434|pages=873–876|year=2005|doi=10.1038/nature03427|pmid=15829958|issue=7035|arxiv = astro-ph/0502441 |bibcode = 2005Natur.434..873F [/tpl]

==Debate==

There is currently a debate over the classification of this object as either a planet or a brown dwarf. One of the leading astronomers in this discussion is Christopher Johns-Krull, who indicated that the debate is still quite lively. This is not particularly unusual or strange, as it would not be the first of many brown dwarfs orbiting mother stars.
The light curve that better match the steepness of ingress and egress implies a planetary radius of 1.32 ± 0.15 RJ and a mass of 11.71 ± 0.46 MJ.
