The 1922 Kansas State Agricultural College Wildcats football team represented Kansas State Agricultural College in the college football season of 1922.  1922 saw the Wildcats finish with a record of 5 wins, 1 loss and 2 ties, and a 3-1-2 record in Missouri Valley Conference play.
The team's head football coach was future Hall-of-Famer Charlie Bachman.  The Wildcats played their home games in brand new Memorial Stadium, which opened that year.  Before the season started, Coach Bachman arranged for a live wildcat to be kept on the sidelines of the new stadium as team mascot.  The wildcat was named "Touchdown," and the live mascot started a tradition that lasted over fifty years, until it was ended in the 1970s with the death of "Touchdown VIII."
At the conclusion of the season, guard Ray Hahn was named a first team All-American by Grantland Rice, becoming the first football player in school history to be so honored.
