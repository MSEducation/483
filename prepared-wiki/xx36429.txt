[[Infix]]

CATEGORIES: Infixes

An infix is an affix inserted inside a word stem (an existing word). It contrasts with adfix, a rare term for an affix attached to the end of a stem, such as a prefix or suffix.
When marking text for interlinear glossing, most affixes are separated with a hyphen, but infixes are separated with [tpl]angle bracket|angle brackets[/tpl].

==English==

English has almost no true infixes (as opposed to tmesis, see below), and those it does have are marginal. A few are heard in colloquial speech, and a few more are found in technical terminology.

===Colloquialisms===

None of the following are recognized in standard English.
For the use of 'expletive infixes' such as fucking and bloody, which are words rather than affixes, see tmesis below.

==Other languages==

===Indo-European languages===

The present tense of some Proto-Indo-European verbs adds a nasal infix (m, n) to the basic root; the stems of the other tenses have the root without the infix.

====Spanish====

In Nicaragua and neighboring countries, the Spanish diminutive affix becomes an infix [tpl]infix|it[/tpl] in names: Óscar [tpl]IPA|ˈoskar[/tpl] → Osquítar [tpl]IPA|osˈkitar[/tpl] (cf. standard Oscarito); Edgar → Edguítar; Victor → Victítor.

===Arabic===

Arabic uses a common infix, [tpl]infix|t[/tpl] ت for Form VIII verbs, usually a reflexive of Form I. It is placed after the first consonant of the root; an epenthetic i- prefix is also added since words cannot begin with a consonant cluster. An example is اجتهد ijtahada "he worked hard", from جهد jahada "he strove". (The words "ijtihad" and "jihad" are nouns derived from these two verbs.)

===Austronesian and Austroasiatic languages===

Infixes are common in Austronesian and Austroasiatic languages. For example,  in Tagalog, a grammatical form similar to the active voice is formed by adding the infix [tpl]infix|um[/tpl] near the beginning of a verb. Tagalog has borrowed the English word graduate as a verb; to say "I graduated" a speaker uses the derived form gr'um'aduate.
Khmer, an Austroasiatic language, has seven different infixes.  They include the nominalizing infix [tpl]infix|b[/tpl], which derives l'beun'' 'speed' from ''leun'' 'fast' and ''lb'ong ' trial' from long 'to test, to haunt'.
In Indonesian (bahasa Indonesia) there are at least 5 kinds of infixes (sisipan). They are [tpl]infix|el[/tpl], [tpl]infix|em[/tpl], [tpl]infix|er[/tpl], [tpl]infix|ah[/tpl], and [tpl]infix|in[/tpl].
Examples:

===Seri===

In Seri some verbs form the plural stem with infixation of [tpl]infix|tóo[/tpl] after the first vowel of the root; compare the singular stem ic 'plant (verb)' with the plural stem itóoc. Examples: itíc 'did s/he plant it?' and iti'tóo'c 'did they sow it?'.

==Similar processes==

Tmesis, the use of a lexical word rather than an affix, is sometimes considered a type of infixation. These are the so-called 'expletive infixes', as in fan-fucking-tastic and abso-bloody-lutely. Since these are not affixes, they are commonly disqualified from being considered infixes.
Sequences of adfixes (prefixes or suffixes) do not result in infixes: An infix must be internal to a word stem. Thus the word originally, formed by adding the suffix -ly to original, does not turn the suffix -al into an infix. There is simply a sequence of two suffixes, origin-al-ly. In order for -al- to be considered an infix, it would have to have been inserted in the non-existent word *originly. The "infixes" in the tradition of Bantu linguistics are often sequences of prefixes of this type, though there may be debate over specific cases. 
The Semitic languages have a form of ablaut (changing the vowels within words, as in English sing, sang, sung, song) that is sometimes called infixation, as the vowels are placed between the consonants of the root. However, this interdigitation of a discontinuous root with a discontinuous affix is more often called transfixation. 
See also interfix, which joins a compound word, as in speed-o-meter.

==Glossing==

When glossing, it is conventional to set off infixes with [tpl]angle bracket|angle brackets[/tpl], rather than the hyphens used to set off prefixes and suffixes: 
Compare:
which is a suffix -ly added to the word original, which is itself a suffix -al added to the root origin.
