Atharvan ([tpl]Lang|sa|अथर्वन्,[/tpl] [tpl]IAST|atharvan-[/tpl]; an n-stem with nominative singular  [tpl]Lang|sa|अथर्वा[/tpl] [tpl]IAST|atharvā[/tpl]) was a legendary Vedic sage (rishi) of Hinduism who along with Angiras is supposed to have authored ("heard") the Atharvaveda. He is also said to have first instituted the fire-sacrifice or yagna. Sometimes he is also reckoned among the seven seers or Saptarishi. His clan is known as the Atharvanas. Atharvan married Chitti, daughter of Kardama rishi, and had a great sage Dadhichi as a son.
He was referred to as a member of the Bhrigu clan.
According to mundaka upnisad and other texts, he was eldest son & (Manas putra) born from mind  of the brahma.
Vedic atharvan is cognate with Avestan āθrauuan / aθaurun, "priest", but the etymology of the term is not yet conclusively established. "Attempts have been made to connect the term with Avestan atar- "fire" (not attested in Vedic); but these have been prompted by what is probably a mistaken assumption of the importance of fire in the ancient Indo-Iranian religion." (Boyce, 1982:16)
