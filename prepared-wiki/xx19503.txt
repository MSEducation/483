[[Phoenix (constellation)]]

CATEGORIES: Phoenix (constellation), Constellations, Southern constellations, Phoenixes in popular culture

Phoenix is a minor constellation in the southern sky. Named after the mythical phoenix, it was first depicted on a celestial atlas by Johann Bayer in his 1603 Uranometria. The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille  charted the brighter stars and gave their Bayer designations in 1756. The constellation stretches from roughly −39° to −57° declination, and from 23.5h to 2.5h of right ascension. The constellations Phoenix, Grus, Pavo and Tucana, are known as the Southern Birds.
The brightest star, Alpha Phoenicis, is named Ankaa, an Arabic word meaning 'the Phoenix'. It is an orange giant of apparent magnitude 2.4. Next is Beta Phoenicis, actually a binary system composed of two yellow giants with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.3. Nu Phoenicis has a dust disk, while the constellation boasts ten star systems with known planets and the recently discovered galaxy clusters El Gordo and the Phoenix Cluster—located 7.2 and 5.7 billion light years away respectively, two of the largest objects in the visible universe. Phoenix is the radiant of two annual meteor showers: the Phoenicids in December, and the July Phoenicids.

==History==

Phoenix was the largest of the twelve constellations established by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. It first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius. The first depiction of this constellation in a celestial atlas was in Johann Bayer's Uranometria of 1603.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer%20southern.htm | title=Bayer's Southern Star Chart |author=Ridpath, Ian|publisher=self-published | accessdate= August 15, 2013[/tpl] De Houtman included it in his southern star catalog the same year under the Dutch name Den voghel Fenicx, "The Bird Phoenix",[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/startales1c.htm#houtman | title=Frederick de Houtman's catalogue |author=Ridpath, Ian|publisher=self-published | accessdate= August 15, 2013[/tpl] symbolising the phoenix of classical mythology.[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/phoenix.htm | title=Phoenix – the Phoenix |author=Ridpath, Ian |publisher=self-published | accessdate= August 18, 2013[/tpl] One name of the brightest star Alpha Phoenicis—Ankaa—is derived from the Arabic العنقاء al-‘anqā’ "the phoenix", and was coined sometime after 1800 in relation to the constellation.[tpl]cite book| author= Kunitsch, Paul; Smart, Tim |year= 2006 |title=A Dictionary of Modern Star names: A Short Guide to 254 Star Names and Their Derivations |publisher=Sky Publishing Corp. |location= Cambridge, Massachusetts |page=49 |isbn=978-1-931559-44-7[/tpl]
Celestial historian Richard Allen noted that unlike the other constellations introduced by Plancius and La Caille, Phoenix has actual precedent in ancient astronomy, as the Arabs saw this formation as representing young ostriches, Al Ri'āl, or as a griffin or eagle. In addition, the same group of stars was sometimes imagined by the Arabs as a boat, Al Zaurak, on the nearby river Eridanus. He observed, "the introduction of a Phoenix into modern astronomy was, in a measure, by adoption rather than by invention."
The Chinese incorporated Phoenix's brightest star, Ankaa (Alpha Phoenicis), and stars from the adjacent constellation Sculptor to depict Bakui, a net for catching birds. Phoenix and the neighbouring constellation of Grus together were seen by Julius Schiller as portraying Aaron the High Priest. These two constellations, along with nearby Pavo and Tucana, are called the Southern Birds.[tpl]cite book|last=Moore, Patrick|title=Exploring the Night Sky with Binoculars|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|year=2000|pages=48|isbn=0521793904|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Jvbtl2Vyxm4C&pg=PA48&dq=phoenix+pavo+grus+tucana#v=onepage&q=phoenix%20pavo%20grus%20tucana&f=false[/tpl]

==Characteristics==

Phoenix is a small constellation bordered by Fornax and Sculptor to the north, Grus to the west, Tucana to the south, touching on the corner of Hydrus to the south, and Eridanus to the east and southeast. The bright star Achernar is nearby.[tpl]cite book|last=Klepešta|first=Josef|coauthors=Rükl, Antonín |title=Constellations |publisher=Hamlyn|year=1974|origyear=1969|pages=214–15|isbn=0-600-00893-2[/tpl] The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is 'Phe'.[tpl]cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris |author-link=Henry Norris Russell | title=The new international symbols for the constellations | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=30 | page=469 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922 [/tpl] The official constellation boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 10 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between [tpl]RA|23|26.5[/tpl] and [tpl]RA|02|25.0[/tpl], while the declination coordinates are between −39.31° and −57.84°.[tpl]Cite journal | title=Phoenix, constellation boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#phe | accessdate=23 August 2012 [/tpl] This means it remains below the horizon to anyone living north of the 40th parallel in the Northern Hemisphere, and remains low in the sky for anyone living north of the equator. It is most visible from locations such as Australia and South Africa during late Southern Hemisphere spring. Most of the constellation lies within, and can be located by, forming a triangle of the bright stars Achernar, Fomalhaut and Beta Ceti—Ankaa lies roughly in the centre of this.[tpl]cite book|last=Heifetz, Milton; Tirion, Wil |title=A Walk Through the Southern Sky: A Guide to Stars and Constellations and Their Legends|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|year=2007|pages=30–31|isbn=1139461389|url=http://books.google.com/?id=L3PIyHY5hSAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=phoenix+constellation#v=onepage&q=phoenix%20constellation&f=false[/tpl]

A curved line of stars comprising Alpha, Kappa, Mu, Beta, Nu and Gamma Phoenicis was seen as a boat by the ancient Arabs.[ref]
