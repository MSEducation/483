Jacqueline Starer was born in Paris in 1940. After studying French and Classics at the Sorbonne, she met the English Poet Keith Barnes (1934–1969) in Paris in 1963.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.m-e-l.fr/jacqueline-starer,ec,579|title=Jacqueline Starer|publisher=Maison des écrivains et de la littérature|language=French|accessdate=25 September 2011[/tpl] Together they left for the United States where she taught in several Universities and Colleges (University of California, Berkeley, Bard College, N.Y.) and where she discovered American Poetry. After Keith Barnes’s death in Paris, she returned to the United States where she wrote her thesis on the writers of the Beat Generation (directed by Roger Asselineau at the Sorbonne). In 1976, she is back in Paris, and becomes involved in International Cooperation in Cultural Affairs. She translated the whole poetic work of Keith Barnes into French as well, with Michèle Duclos, as a choice of poems of the Japanese poet Shizue Ogawa. She was Representative for Le Journal des Poètes (Brussels) in France (2006–2012). She is the author of five books: on writers of the Beat Generation, on Keith Barnes, and on the life of French people in the Paris area at the end of the 20th century.
