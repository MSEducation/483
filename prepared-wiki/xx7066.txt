[[Lactose]]

CATEGORIES: Disaccharides, Excipients, Sweeteners

Lactose is a disaccharide sugar derived from galactose and glucose that is found in milk. Lactose makes up around 2–8% of milk (by weight),[tpl]cite web|last=Carper|first=Steve|title=The Really BIG List of Lactose Percentages|url=http://www.stevecarper.com/li/list_of_lactose_percentages.htm|work=Lactose Intolerance Clearinghouse|accessdate=30 January 2014[/tpl] although the amount varies among species and individuals, and milk with a reduced amount of lactose also exists. It is extracted from sweet or sour whey. The name comes from [tpl]lang|la|lac[/tpl] or [tpl]lang|la|lactis[/tpl], the Latin word for milk, plus the -ose ending used to name sugars. It has a formula of C12H22O11.

==History==

The Italian physician Fabrizio Bartoletti (1576-1630) may have discovered lactose circa 1628.[ref]Note:

==Structure and reactions==

Lactose is a disaccharide derived from the condensation of galactose and glucose, which form a β-1→4 glycosidic linkage.  Its systematic name is β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucose. The glucose can be in either the α-pyranose form or the β-pyranose form, whereas the galactose can only have the β-pyranose form: hence α-lactose and β-lactose refer to anomeric form of the glucopyranose ring alone..
Lactose is hydrolysed to glucose and galactose, isomerised in alkaline solution to lactulose, and catalytically hydrogenated to the corresponding polyhydric alcohol, lactitol.[tpl]citation |year=1982 |author=Linko, P |chapter=Lactose and Lactitol |pages=109–132|title=Natural Sweeteners |editor=Birch, G.G. & Parker, K.J |place=London & New Jersey |publisher=Applied Science Publishers |isbn=0-85334-997-5[/tpl]
Lactose monohydrate crystals have a characteristic tomahawk shape that can be observed with a light microscope.

==Isolation==

Several million tons are produced annually as a by-product of the dairy industry. Whey is made of up 6.5% solids of which 4.8% is lactose that may be purified by crystallisation.[tpl]Citation|last=Ranken|first=M. D.|first2=R. C. |last2=Kill|title=Food industries manual|publisher=Springer|year=1997|page=125|isbn=0-7514-0404-7[/tpl] Whey or milk plasma is the liquid remaining after milk is curdled and strained, for example in the production of cheese. Lactose makes up about 2-8% of milk by weight[tpl]cn|date=January 2014[/tpl]. 
Industrially, lactose is produced from whey permeate – that is whey filtrated for all major proteins. The protein fraction is used in infant nutrition and sport nutrition while the permeate can be evaporated to 60-65 % solids and crystallized while cooling .Wong SY, Hartel RW.: Crystallization in lactose refining-a review. J Food Sci 2014, 79(3):R257-72.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24517206
Lactose can also be precipitated from whey using ethanol. Since it is insoluble in ethanol, lactose precipitates, in about 65% yield

==Metabolism==

Infant mammals nurse on their mothers to drink milk, which is rich in lactose. The intestinal villi secrete the enzyme called lactase (β-D-galactosidase) to digest it. This enzyme cleaves the lactose molecule into its two subunits, the simple sugars glucose and galactose, which can be absorbed. Since lactose occurs mostly in milk, in most mammals, the production of lactase gradually decreases with maturity due to a lack of constant consumption.
Many people with ancestry in Europe, West Asia, South Asia, and parts of East Africa maintain lactase production into adulthood.  In many of these areas, milk from mammals such as cattle, goats, and sheep is used as a large source of food. Hence, it was in these regions that genes for lifelong lactase production first evolved. The genes of adult lactose tolerance have evolved independently in various ethnic groups.[tpl]citation | first = Nicholas | last = Wade | title= Study Detects Recent Instance of Human Evolution | date = 2006-12-10 | newspaper= New York Times | url= http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/science/10cnd-evolve.html?[/tpl]. By descent, more than 70% of western Europeans can drink milk as adults, compared with less than 30% of people from areas of Africa, eastern and south-eastern Asia and Oceania.[tpl]Citation |last= Ridley |first= Matt |title= Genome |publisher= HarperCollins |year= 1999 |page= 193 |isbn= 978-0-06-089408-5[/tpl]. In people who are lactose intolerant, lactose is not broken down and provides food for gas-producing gut flora, which can lead to diarrhea, bloating, flatulence, and other gastrointestinal symptoms.

==Applications==

Food industry applications have markedly increased since the 1960s. For example, its bland flavor has lent to its use as a carrier and stabiliser of aromas and pharmaceutical products. Lactose is not added directly to many foods, because its solubility is less than other sugars commonly used in food. Infant formula is a notable exception, where the addition of lactose is necessary to match the composition of human milk. 
Lactose is not fermented by yeast during brewing, which may be used to advantage. For example, lactose may be used to sweeten stout beer; the resulting beer is usually called a milk stout or a cream stout.
Another major use of lactose is in the pharmaceutical industry. Lactose is added to pills as a filler because of its physical properties, i.e., compressibility, and low price. For similar reasons it can be used to dilute heroin.
