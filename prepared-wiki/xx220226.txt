The Dublin Bay 21 footer yacht is a one-design wooden sailing boat designed for sailing in Dublin Bay. 
The seven yachts were designed by Alfred Mylne and built between 1903 and 1906 under a commission from the old Dublin Bay Sailing Club to encourage inexpensive one-design racing and are purported to be the oldest class of racing yacht in the world.Kilkenny City Online

The class is now defunct and the fleet lay in various states of disrepair in Jack Tyrrell's yard in Arklow, Co. Wicklow. The fleet were taken out of the water in 1986 after Hurricane Charley ruined active Dublin Bay 21 fleet racing in August of that year. Two 21s sank in the storm, suffering the same fate as their sister ship Estelle four years earlier.Class of 21 deserves some loving care
It is said that these boats present one of the loveliest sights to be seen on any sailing waters in the world.
