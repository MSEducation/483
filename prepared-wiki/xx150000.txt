By some magical situation, Rajni discovers himself to be a son of a dead millionaireâ€”through Visu. Visu is the guardian of Rajni's father's trust. If Rajni wants his inheritance, he has to follow certain rules. He can get an inheritance of [tpl]Indian Rupees[/tpl]3000 crore if he can spend [tpl]Indian Rupees[/tpl]300 crore in a month. The three conditions are: no contributions to charities, not to own any assets at the end of the month, and, above all, no one else must know. If Rajni fails to spend the money according to the rules, all the money will go to his father's trust which is managed by V.K.Ramasamy, "Nizhalgal" Ravi, Kitty and Raghuvaran. These four form a team of "villains". They want to spoil Rajni's efforts and get all the money for the trust and then to loot the money.

==Production==

After the success of Muthu in 1995, Rajinikanth took a year out dabbling in politics and taking a sabbatical before announcing that his next film would be Arunachalam written by Crazy Mohan. It was announced that the film would be produced to help eight of his struggling film industry colleagues and it was incorrectly earlier reported that the film would be produced under his newly floated Rajini Arts banner. It was indicated that some of the people who the film would go on to cause benefits for included Kalakendra Govindharajan who introduced Rajinikanth in his production Apoorva Raagangal (1975), Kalaignyanam who featured Rajinikanth in the lead role for the first time with his production Bairavi (1978) and brothers Ramji and Babji who produced some of the actor's early hits, Kaali (1980) and Garjanai (1980). Furthermore collections would also be shared between the family of Sathya Studio Padmanabhan, actress Pandari Bai, actor V. K. Ramasamy and producer Madurai Nagaraja.[tpl]cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/soc.culture.tamil/browse_thread/thread/27af1fb9091d0adc/aff47817cde6b536?lnk=gst&q=#aff47817cde6b536 |title=Tamil Movie News-Pudhu Edition 2 - soc.culture.tamil | Google Groups |publisher=Groups.google.com |date=1996-10-22 |accessdate=2012-07-02[/tpl] Initial reports had also titled the film as Kuberan and Meshtri, but Arunachalam was eventually retained. The plot of the film was inspired by George Barr McCutcheon's novel Brewster's Millions.
Initially the lead heroine of the film was expected to be either Manisha Koirala, who had appeared in successive blockbusters in Bombay and Indian, or Meena who had featured in Rajinikanth's previous film, Muthu.

The initial cast list released to the media also had Jayaram in the cast of the film as well as Vignesh, who was later replaced by Raja.[tpl]cite web |url=http://groups.google.com/group/soc.culture.tamil/browse_thread/thread/2971605fe3027b02/eca6457f1e03db88%3Fq%3D%2522%2BKuberan%2522%23eca6457f1e03db88&ei=iGwTS6eaOpW8Qpmqic0O&sa=t&ct=res&cd=36&source=groups&usg=AFQjCNGJGQkGcN5wVAZMfMwKQ5FMgvk0Ww |title=Tamil Movie News-Pudhu Edition 2 - soc.culture.tamil | Google Groups |publisher=Groups.google.com |date=1997-01-17 |accessdate=2012-07-02[/tpl] Manorama was also surprisingly added to the cast after causing controversy the previous year by lashing out at Rajinikanth's political motives.[tpl]cite web|author=June 25, 2011 By Anupama Subramanian DC chennai |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/showbiz/kollywood/rajinikanth-kaliyug-vaali-509 |title=Rajinikanth is Kaliyug Vaali |publisher=Deccan Chronicle |date=2011-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-02[/tpl]
Rajinikanth lost his sentimental Rudraksh bead during the shooting of the film and was shocked and upset to note that his Rudraksh was missing. He ordered a search at the shooting spot at midnight and with the help of the giant lights used for shooting, he later found the divine bead after a while.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/36177.html |title=Rajini and the Rudraksh - Tamil Movie News |publisher=IndiaGlitz |date=2008-01-28 |accessdate=2012-07-02[/tpl]

==Release==

Indolink.com gave the film a mixed review citing that "the saving grace of the film is Rajini himself. He has the exceptional ability to convincingly portray the same utopian role of anger and love, innocence and impetuousness...and whats more...he does it with remarkable freshness time and again".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indolink.com/Film/arunachl.html |title=INDOlink Film Review: Arunachalam |publisher=Indolink.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-02[/tpl]
