==History==

The Gories were formed in 1986 by metro-Detroit natives Mick Collins, Dan Kroha, and Peggy O'Neill. The Gories took their name from a band that appeared on the 1960s television show Gidget. The band members, which at that time dressed in mod clothing, were friends for over a year before they decided to start the band. http://turnit-down.blogspot.com/2013/04/mick-collins-interview-gories-dirtbombs.html. At the time they formed the Gories, only Collins had had any musical experience, and they had to teach themselves how to play.

The release had been predated by a cassette-only collection of demos and live recordings, with extremely limited retail distribution in the metro Detroit area.

They soon signed to the German label Crypt Records and released "Outta Here." After only three albums, the band suffered an infamous break-up in 1992. Mick Collins went on to form various bands including Blacktop and The Dirtbombs, while Dan Kroha joined Rocket 455 and later formed the Demolition Doll Rods and The Readies. Peggy O'Neill went on to join '68 Comeback and Darkest Hours. [tpl]Allmusic|class=artist|id=p200426/biography|pure_url=yes[/tpl]
