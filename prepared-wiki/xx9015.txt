Newfoundland and Labrador ([tpl]IPAc-en|'|n|juː|f|ʊ|n|d|l|æ|n|d|_|æ|n|d|_|'|l|æ|b|r|ə|d|ɔr[/tpl], locally [tpl]IPA-endia|nuːfəndˈlænd|[/tpl];  [tpl]lang-fr|Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador[/tpl]) is the easternmost province of Canada. Situated in the country's Atlantic region, it incorporates the island of Newfoundland and mainland Labrador to the northwest, with a combined area of [tpl]convert|405212|km2|-2[/tpl]. In 2013, the province's population was estimated at 526,702.[tpl]cite web |title=Estimates of population, Canada, provinces and territories|url=http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a26?lang=eng&retrLang=eng&id=0510005&paSer=&pattern=&stByVal=1&p1=1&p2=31&tabMode=dataTable&csid=|publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=September 28, 2013[/tpl] Approximately 92 percent of the province's population lives on the Island of Newfoundland (including its associated smaller islands), of which more than half live on the Avalon Peninsula. The province is Canada's most linguistically homogenous, with 97.6% of residents reporting English (Newfoundland English) as their mother tongue in the 2006 census.Population by mother tongue and age groups, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories - 20% sample data. 2.statcan.ca (2009-03-24). Retrieved on 2013-07-12.  Historically, Newfoundland was also home to unique varieties of French and Irish, as well as the now-extinct Beothuk language. In Labrador, local dialects of Innu-aimun and Inuktitut are also spoken.
Newfoundland and Labrador's capital and largest city, St. John's, is Canada's 20th-largest census metropolitan area, and is home to almost 40 percent of the province's population. St. John's is the seat of government, home to the House of Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador and the highest court in the jurisdiction, the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal.
A former colony and dominion of the United Kingdom, Newfoundland and Labrador became the tenth province to enter the Canadian Confederation on March 31, 1949, as Newfoundland. On December 6, 2001, an amendment was made to the Constitution of Canada to change the province's official name to Newfoundland and Labrador.[tpl]cite news|title=Newfoundland's name change now official|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2001/12/06/nfld_name011206.html|accessdate=March 10, 2012|newspaper=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|date=December 6, 2001[/tpl] In day-to-day conversation, however, Canadians generally still refer to the province itself as Newfoundland and to the region on the Canadian mainland as Labrador.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The name Newfoundland is derived from English as "New Found Land" (a translation from the Portuguese Terra Nova, still reflected in the province's French-language name, "Terre-Neuve"). The origin of Labrador is credited to João Fernandes Lavrador, the Portuguese navigator who explored the region.Hamilton, William B. (1978): The Macmillan book of Canadian place names, Macmillan of Canada, Toronto, p. 105.

==Geography==

Newfoundland and Labrador is the most easterly province in Canada, and is located on the north-eastern corner of North America.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nlimmigration.ca/about-newfoundland-and-labrador/geography-and-climate.aspx|title=Geography and Climate|publisher=Government of Newfoundland and Labrador|accessdate=January 10, 2011[/tpl] The Strait of Belle Isle separates the province into two geographical divisions, Labrador, which is a large land mass connected to mainland Canada, and Newfoundland, which is an island in the Atlantic Ocean.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/environment/landscape.html|title=Landscape (of Newfoundland and Labrador)|last=Bell|first=Trevor|coauthors=Liverman, David |publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland|accessdate=June 16, 2008[/tpl] The province also includes over 7,000 tiny islands.[tpl]cite web|url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/facts/islands.html|title= Atlas of Canada: Sea islands|publisher=Natural Resources Canada (Government of Canada)|accessdate=June 16, 2008[/tpl]
Newfoundland is roughly triangular, with each side being approximately [tpl]convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on|spell=Commonwealth[/tpl], and has an area of [tpl]convert|108860|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl].

Labrador is an irregular shape: the western part of its border with Quebec is the drainage divide of the Labrador Peninsula. Lands drained by rivers that flow into the Atlantic Ocean are part of Labrador, the rest belong to Quebec. Labrador's extreme northern tip, at 60°22′N, shares a short border with Nunavut. Labrador's area (including associated small islands) is [tpl]convert|294330|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl]. Together, Newfoundland and Labrador make up 4.06% of Canada's area.[tpl]cite web |url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/facts/surfareas.html|title= Atlas of Canada: Land and Freshwater Areas |publisher=Natural Resources Canada (Government of Canada)|accessdate=June 16, 2008[/tpl]
Labrador is the easternmost part of the Canadian Shield, a vast area of ancient metamorphic rock comprising much of northeastern North America. Colliding tectonic plates have shaped much of the geology of Newfoundland. Gros Morne National Park has a reputation as an outstanding example of tectonics at work,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/docs/pm-wh/rspm-whsr/rapports-reports/r3_e.asp|title=Report on the State of Conservation of Gros Morne National Park|publisher=Parks Canada|accessdate=June 16, 2008[/tpl] and as such has been designated a World Heritage Site. The Long Range Mountains on Newfoundland's west coast are the northeasternmost extension of the Appalachian Mountains.
The north-south extent of the province (46°36′N to 60°22′N), prevalent westerly winds, cold ocean currents and local factors such as mountains and coastline combine to create the various climates of the province.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/environment/climate.html|title=Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage Web Site: Climate |publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland|accessdate=June 16, 2008[/tpl] Northern Labrador is classified as a polar tundra climate, southern Labrador has a subarctic climate while most of Newfoundland would be humid continental climate, Dfb: Cool summer subtype.

===Climate===

Newfoundland and Labrador is home to a variety of climates and weather. One of the main reasons for this diversity is the geography of the province. The island portion of the province spans 5 degrees of latitude, which is comparable to that of the Great Lakes.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theweathernetwork.com/index.php?product=wxhome&placecode=canf0253&pagecontent=nf|title=Weather and Your Home: The Climate of Newfoundland|publisher=The Weather Network|accessdate=January 10, 2011[/tpl]
The province has been divided into six climate types, but in broader terms Newfoundland has a cool summer subtype of a humid continental climate, which is greatly influenced by the sea since no part of the island is more than 100 km (62 mi) from the ocean. Northern Labrador is classified as a polar tundra climate, southern Labrador has a subarctic climate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/environment/seasonal.html|title=Climate Characteristics |publisher=Memorial University of Newfoundland|accessdate=June 17, 2008[/tpl]
Monthly average temperatures, rainfall and snowfall for four communities are shown in the attached graphs. St. John's represents the east coast, Gander the interior of the island, Corner Brook the west coast of the island and Wabush the interior of Labrador. The detailed information and information for 73 communities in the province is available from a government website.[tpl]cite web|url=http://climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/index_e.html|title=Canadian Climate Normals or Averages 1971–2000|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=July 30, 2007[/tpl] The data used in making the graphs is the average taken over thirty years. Error bars on the temperature graph indicate the range of daytime highs and night time lows. Snowfall is the total amount that fell during the month, not the amount accumulated on the ground. This distinction is particularly important for St. John's where a heavy snowfall can be followed by rain so that no snow remains on the ground.
Surface water temperatures on the Atlantic side reach a summer average of [tpl]convert|12|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl] inshore and [tpl]convert|9|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl] offshore to winter lows of [tpl]convert|-1|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl] inshore and [tpl]convert|2|°C|°F|abbr=on[/tpl] offshore. Sea temperatures on the west coast are warmer than Atlantic side by 1 to 3 °C (1 to 5 °F). The sea keeps winter temperatures slightly higher and summer temperatures a little lower on the coast than at places inland. The maritime climate produces more variable weather, ample precipitation in a variety of forms, greater humidity, lower visibility, more clouds, less sunshine, and higher winds than a continental climate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://atlantic-web1.ns.ec.gc.ca/climatecentre/default.asp?lang=En&n=83846147-1|title=The Climate of Newfoundland|publisher=Environment Canada|accessdate=June 17, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080519102701/http://atlantic-web1.ns.ec.gc.ca/climatecentre/default.asp?lang=En&n=83846147-1 |archivedate = May 19, 2008[/tpl]

==History==

===Pre-colonization===

Human habitation in Newfoundland and Labrador can be traced back about 9000 years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.therooms.ca/museum/mnotes12.asp|title=Museum Notes – The Maritime Archaic Tradition|last= Tuck|first=James A. |publisher="The Rooms" Provincial museum |accessdate=June 17, 2008[/tpl]  The Maritime Archaic peoples were groups of Archaic cultures of sea-mammal hunters in the subarctic. They prospered from approximately 7,000 BC to 1,500 BC along the Atlantic Coast of North America. Their settlements included longhouses and boat-topped temporary or seasonal houses. They engaged in long-distance trade, using as currency white chert, a rock quarried from northern Labrador to Maine. The Southern branch of these people was established on the north peninsula of Newfoundland by 5,000 years ago. Maritime Archaic period is best known from a mortuary site in Newfoundland at Port au Choix.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=E_2ZHVg5-3QC&pg=PA139&dq=mortuary+site+in+Newfoundland+at+Port+au+Choix#v=onepage&q&f=true|page=139|title=The Origins of Human Society|first=Peter I|last=Bogucki |publisher=Blackwell |year=1999|isbn=1-55786-349-0|accessdate=May 2, 2011[/tpl]
The Maritime Archaic peoples were gradually displaced by people of the Dorset Culture (Late Paleo-Eskimo) who also occupied Port au Choix. The number of their sites discovered on Newfoundland indicate they may have been the most numerous group of Aboriginal people to live there. They thrived from about 2000 BC to 1200 years ago. Many of their sites were located on exposed headlands and outer islands. They were more oriented to the sea than earlier peoples, and had developed sleds and boats similar to kayaks. They could burn seal blubber in soapstone lamps.Ralph T. Pastore, "Aboriginal Peoples: Palaeo-Eskimo Peoples", Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage: Newfoundland and Labrador Studies Site 2205, 1998, Memorial University of Newfoundland
 "Many of these sites, such as Port au Choix, recently excavated by Memorial archaeologist, Priscilla Renouf, are quite large and show evidence of a long-term commitment to place. Renouf has excavated huge amounts of harp seal bones at Port au Choix, indicating that this place was a prime location for the hunting of these animals." 
The Dorset Culture (800 BC – 1500) were highly adapted to living in a very cold climate, and much of their food came from hunting sea mammals through holes in the ice.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=PHsyINzEEgEC&lpg=PA88&dq=Dorset%20culture&pg=PA88#v=onepage&q&f=true|pages=88–89|title=Canada's Changing North|first=William C|last=Wonders|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-7735-2590-4[/tpl] The massive decline in sea-ice which the Medieval Warm Period produced would have had a devastating impact upon their way of life.
The appearance of the Beothuk culture is believed the most recent cultural manifestation of peoples who first migrated from Labrador to Newfoundland around 1 AD.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=ckOav3Szu7oC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=true|page=13|title=A History and Ethnography of the Beothuk|first=Ingeborg |last=Marshall |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=1998|isbn=0-7735-1774-X[/tpl] The Inuit, found mostly in Labrador, are the descendants of what anthropologists call the Thule culture, who emerged from western Alaska around 1000 AD and spread eastwards across the High Arctic, reaching Labrador around 1300–1500.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=ZxWJVc4ST0AC&lpg=PA535&dq=Inuit%20migration%20to%20labrador&pg=PA535#v=onepage&q&f=true|page=535|title=A Native American encyclopedia: history, culture, and peoples|first=Barry |last=Pritzker|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000|isbn=0-19-513877-5[/tpl]  Researchers believe that the Dorset culture lacked the dogs, larger weapons and other technologies that gave the expanding Inuit society an advantage.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=P69EpMJ-C_8C&lpg=PA101&dq=Dorset%20culture%20lacked%20dogs&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q&f=true|page=101|title=Inujjuamiut foraging strategies : evolutionary ecology of an arctic hunting economy|last==Smith|first=Eric Alden|publisher= A. de Gruyter|year=1991|isbn=0-202-01181-X[/tpl] With the passage of time, groups started to focus on resources available to them locally.
The inhabitants eventually organized themselves into small bands of a few families, grouped into larger tribes and chieftainships. The Innu are the inhabitants of an area they refer to as Nitassinan, which comprises most of what is now referred to as northeastern Quebec and Labrador. Their subsistence activities were historically centred on hunting and trapping caribou, deer and small game. Coastal clans also practised agriculture, fished, and managed maple sugarbush. The Innu engaged in tribal warfare along the coast of Labrador with the Inuit groups that had significant populations.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=GkAuYRVjlE8C&lpg=PA102&dq=Innu%20and%20Inuit%20warfare&pg=PA102#v=onepage&q&f=true|page=102|title=Aboriginal peoples of Canada: a short introduction|first=Paul R|last=Magocsi|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2002|isbn=0-8020-3630-9[/tpl]
The Míkmaq of southern Newfoundland spent most of their time on the shores harvesting seafood; during the winter they would move inland to the woods to hunt.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=-PRUMG5Ukx4C&lpg=PP1&dq=Mi'kmaq&pg=PA4#v=onepage&q&f=true|page=4|title=Mi'kmaq landscapes: from animism to sacred ecology|first=Anne-Christine |last=Hornborg|publisher=Burlington, VT : Ashgate|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7546-6371-3[/tpl] Over time, the Mi'kmaq and Innu divided their lands into traditional "districts". Each district was independently governed and had a district chief and a council. The council members were band chiefs, elders, and other worthy community leaders.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=UAvyE0pN5akC&lpg=PP1&dq=Place%20names%20of%20Atlantic%20Canada&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=true|page=3|title=Place names of Atlantic Canada|last=William |first=Baillie Hamilton|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1996|isbn=0-8020-0471-7[/tpl] In addition to the district councils, the Mi'kmaq tribes also had (have) a Grand Council or Santé Mawiómi, which according to oral tradition was formed before 1600.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=0MEQyYggQE8C&lpg=PA53&dq=Mi'kmaq%20%20Grand%20Council%20formation&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q&f=true|page=53|title=Mi'kmaq Treaties on Trial: History, Land and Donald Marshall Junior |first=William |last=Wicken|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2002|isbn=0-8020-0718-X[/tpl]

===European contact===

The oldest confirmed accounts of European contact date from a thousand years ago as described in the Viking (Norse) Icelandic Sagas.  Around the year 1001, the sagas refer to Leif Ericson landing in three places to the west, the first two being Helluland (possibly Baffin Island) and Markland (possibly Labrador).[tpl]cite web|url=http://sagadb.org/eiriks_saga_rauda.en|title=The Saga of Erik the Red|year=1880|author= J.

There are several other unconfirmed accounts of European discovery and exploration. One tale by men from the Channel Islands being blown off course in the late 15th century into a strange land full of fish, and another from Portuguese maps that depict the Terra do Bacalhau, or land of codfish, west of the Azores. The earliest, though, is the Voyage of Saint Brendan, the fantastical account of an Irish monk who made a sea voyage in the early 6th century. While the story itself became a part of myth and legend, some historians believe it is based on fact.
In 1496 John Cabot obtained a charter from English King Henry VII to "sail to all parts, countries and seas of the East, the West and of the North, under our banner and ensign and to set up our banner on any new-found-land" and on June 24, 1497 landed in Cape Bonavista. Historians disagree on whether Cabot landed in Nova Scotia in 1497 or in Newfoundland, or possibly Maine, if he landed at all, but Bonavista is recognised by the governments of Canada and the United Kingdom as being Cabot's "official" landing place. In 1499 and 1500, Portuguese mariners João Fernandes Lavrador and Pêro de Barcelos explored and mapped the coast, the former's name appearing as "Labrador" on topographical maps of the period.[ref]
