Thalidomide ([tpl]IPAc-en|θ|ə|ˈ|l|ɪ|d|ə|m|aɪ|d[/tpl]; from phthalimido-glutarimide.[tpl]OED|Thalidomide[/tpl] Currently marketed under the brand names Inmunoprin, Talidex, Talizer, Thalomid) is an immunomodulatory drug and the prototype of the thalidomide class of drugs. It was first marketed in 1957 in West Germany under the trade-name Contergan. The German drug company Chemie Grünenthal (now Grünenthal) developed and sold the drug. Primarily prescribed as a sedative or hypnotic, thalidomide also claimed to cure “anxiety, insomnia, gastritis, and tension". Afterwards it was used against nausea and to alleviate morning sickness in pregnant women. Thalidomide became an over the counter drug in Germany on October 1, 1957. Shortly after the drug was sold, in Germany, between 5,000 and 7,000 infants were born with malformation of the limbs (phocomelia). Only 40% of these children survived.Reversal of Fortune: How a Vilified Drug Became a Life-saving Agent in the "War" Against Cancer - Onco'Zine - The International Cancer Network (November 30, 2013) Throughout the world, about 10,000 cases were reported of infants with phocomelia due to thalidomide; only 50% of the 10,000 survived. Those subjected to thalidomide while in the womb experienced limb deficiencies in a way that the long limbs either were not developed or presented themselves as stumps. Other effects included deformed eyes and hearts, deformed alimentary and urinary tracts, blindness and deafness. The negative effects of thalidomide led to the development of more structured drug regulations and control over drug use and development.
Today, thalidomide is being marketed by Celgene mainly as a treatment of certain cancers (multiple myeloma) and of a complication of leprosy.

===Leprosy treatment===

In 1964, biologist Jacob Sheskin administered thalidomide to a patient critically ill with leprosy. The patient exhibited erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), a painful skin condition, one of the complications of leprosy. This was attempted despite the ban on thalidomide's use, but results were favourable: the patient slept for hours and was able to get out of bed without aid upon awakening. A clinical trial studying the use of thalidomide in leprosy soon followed.[tpl]cite journal|author=Silverman WA |title=The schizophrenic career of a 'monster drug' |journal=Pediatrics |volume=110 |issue=2 Pt 1|pages=404–6|date=August 2002 |pmid=12165600 |doi=10.1542/peds.110.2.404[/tpl]
Thalidomide has been used by Brazilian physicians as the drug of choice for the treatment of severe ENL since 1965, and by 1996, at least 33 cases of thalidomide embryopathy were recorded in people born in Brazil after 1965.[tpl]cite journal |author=Castilla EE, Ashton-Prolla P, Barreda-Mejia E, et al. |title=Thalidomide, a current teratogen in South America|journal=Teratology|volume=54|issue=6|pages=273–7 |date=December 1996 |pmid=9098920 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-9926(199612)54:63.0.CO;2-#|doi_brokendate=May 6, 2013[/tpl] Since 1994, the production, dispensing, and prescription of thalidomide have been strictly controlled, requiring women to use two forms of birth control and submit to regular pregnancy tests.

In 1998 the FDA approved the drug's use in the treatment of ENL.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/17/us/thalidomide-approved-to-treat-leprosy-with-other-uses-seen.html|title=Thalidomide Approved to Treat Leprosy, With Other Uses Seen|newspaper=New York Times|author=Sheryl Gay Stolberg|accessdate=8 January 2012|date=17 July 1998[/tpl] Because of thalidomide's potential for causing birth defects, the drug may be distributed only under tightly controlled conditions. The FDA required that Celgene Corporation, which planned to market thalidomide under the brand name Thalomid, establish a system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety (STEPS) oversight program. The conditions required under the program include limiting prescription and dispensing rights only to authorized prescribers and pharmacies, keeping a registry of all patients prescribed thalidomide, providing extensive patient education about the risks associated with the drug, and providing periodic pregnancy tests for women who take the drug.
More recently, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has stated:
 
 "The WHO does not recommend the use of thalidomide in leprosy as experience has shown that it is virtually impossible to develop and implement a fool-proof surveillance mechanism to combat misuse of the drug. The drug clofazimine is now a component of the multidrug therapy (MDT), introduced by WHO in 1981 as the standard treatment for leprosy and now supplied free of charge to all patients worldwide."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.who.int/lep/research/thalidomide/en/index.html |title=Use of thalidomide in leprosy|last=Anon|work=WHO:leprosy elimination |publisher=WHO |accessdate=22 April 2010[/tpl]

===Cancer treatment===

In 1994 Harvard Professor Robert D'Amato at Boston Children's Hospital discovered that thalidomide was a potent inhibitor of new blood vessel growth (angiogenesis), which is required for tumor growth.[tpl]cite pmid|7513432[/tpl] He then showed in a rabbit cancer model that thalidomide suppressed tumor growth in animals.[tpl]cite pmid|10408702[/tpl] He also found that a subset of anti-inflammatory drugs, such as sulindac and dexamethasone, had moderate anti-angiogenic activity. When these anti-inflammatory anti-angiogenic drugs were combined with thalidomide they increased both thalidomide's anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity. Based on these discoveries, numerous cancer clinical trials for thalidomide were initiated with and without dexamethasone.[tpl]cite web|author=David Altman |url=http://vectorblog.org/2013/04/from-thalidomide-to-pomalyst-better-living-through-chemistry/|title=From thalidomide to Pomalyst: Better living through chemistry — Vector |publisher=Vectorblog.org |date=2013-04-02|accessdate=2013-05-22[/tpl]
Thalidomide was initially tested in humans as a single agent for the treatment of multiple myeloma due to its anti-angiogenic activity.[tpl]cite journal |author=Singhal S, Mehta J, Desikan R, et al. |title=Antitumor activity of thalidomide in refractory multiple myeloma |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=341|issue=21|pages=1565–71|date=November 1999|pmid=10564685 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199911183412102[/tpl] The early foundation for this work was laid out in a 1993 keynote lecture at the American Society of Hematology by Dr. Folkman when he hypothesized that all blood borne malignancies are angiogenesis dependent based upon his discovery that the levels of the angiogenic growth factor FGF were elevated in the urine of patients with leukaemia.[tpl]cite journal |author=Nguyen M, Watanabe H, Budson AE, Richie JP, Hayes DF, Folkman J|title=Elevated levels of an angiogenic peptide, basic fibroblast growth factor, in the urine of patients with a wide spectrum of cancers|journal=J. Natl. Cancer Inst. |volume=86 |issue=5|pages=356–61 |date=March 1994|pmid=7508518|url=http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=7508518[/tpl] Further studies in his lab showed efficacy with the angiogenesis inhibitor TNP-470 in mouse models of leukaemia. Additionally, in 1994 Vacca had shown a fivefold increase in angiogenesis in the bone marrow of multiple myeloma patients.[tpl]cite journal |author=Vacca A, Ribatti D, Roncali L, et al.|title=Bone marrow angiogenesis and progression in multiple myeloma|journal=Br. J. Haematol. |volume=87|issue=3 |pages=503–8 |date=July 1994|pmid=7527645[/tpl] When the family of a patient with late stage multiple myeloma requested any possible help from Dr. Folkman in 1997, he attempted to obtain TNP-470 as a therapy. However TNP-470 could not be obtained outside of the ongoing clinical trial and thus Dr. D'Amato suggested that thalidomide be used instead for this patient. A small study was then initiated with thalidomide for this patient and several others by Dr. Bart Barlogie with dramatic effects. Since then, many studies have shown that thalidomide, in combination with dexamethasone, has increased the survival of multiple myeloma patients.
In the 2000s, the combination of thalidomide and dexamethasone, often in combination with melphalan, became one of the most common regimens for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.[tpl]cite journal |author=Gieseler F |title=Pathophysiological considerations to thrombophilia in the treatment of multiple myeloma with thalidomide and derivates |journal=Thromb.

In 2006 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/druginfo/fda-thalidomide|publisher=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=8 January 2012|title=FDA Approval for Thalidomide[/tpl] The FDA approval came seven years after the first reports of efficacy in the medical literature[tpl]cite journal | author = Desikan R, Munsi N, Zeldis J, et al.| title = Activity of thalidomide (THAL) in multiple myeloma (MM) confirmed in 180 patients with advanced disease | journal = Blood | volume = 94 | issue = Suppl. 1 | pages = 603a–603a | publisher = | year = 1999 | url = | doi = | id =|accessdate = [/tpl][tpl]vs|can't find this. is there a mistake in the bibliographic info?|date=June 2013[/tpl] and Celgene took advantage of "off-label" marketing opportunities to promote the drug in advance of its FDA approval for the myeloma indication. Over $300 million worth of Thalomid, as the drug is commercially known, was sold in 2004, while approved only for leprosy.

===Carcinogenicity===

Animal studies have failed to demonstrate any carcinogenicity even when rats and mice were exposed to up to 11 times the therapeutic dose of thalidomide. Despite this there has been some concerns that it may cause secondary malignancies in patients with multiple myeloma. The FDA has issued a statement that it is investigating these concerns.[tpl]cite news|title=FDA Announces Investigation Into Revlimid, Thalidomide, And Secondary Cancers|date=8 April 2011|accessdate=17 January 2014|url=http://www.myelomabeacon.com/news/2011/04/08/fda-announces-investigation-into-revlimid-lenalidomide-thalidomide-thalomid-and-secondary-cancers/|author=The Myeloma Beacon Staff|work=The Myeloma Beacon[/tpl] Some clinical trials have supported this claim and the major secondary malignancy that thalidomide is associated with is acute myeloid leukaemia.[tpl]cite journal|title=Second malignancies in total therapy 2 and 3 for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: influence of thalidomide and lenalidomide during maintenance|journal=Blood|volume=120|issue=8|pages=1597–1600|doi=10.1182/blood-2012-04-421883|pmid=22674807|pmc=3429303|date=August 2012|author=Usmani, SZ; Sexton, R; Hoering, A; Heuck, CJ; Nair, B; Waheed, S; Al Sayed, Y; Chauhan, N; Ahmad, N; Atrash, S; Petty, N; van Rhee, F; Crowley, J; Barlogie, B|url=http://bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org/content/120/8/1597.full.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] The MHRA of the UK and Health Canada of Canada have also issued warnings to healthcare professionals regarding the risk of secondary malignancies due to thalidomide exposure.[tpl]cite web|title=Thalidomide: risk of second primary malignancies|date=May 2013|accessdate=17 January 2014|url=http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Safetyinformation/DrugSafetyUpdate/CON282739|work=Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2013/05/22/thalidomide-cancer.html |title=Thalidomide drug label to warn of cancer risk|author=|date=May 22, 2013 |work=CBC News [/tpl]

===Contraindications===

Contraindications include:

===Interactions===

There are no expected pharmacokinetic interactions between thalidomide and other medicines due to its neutral effects on p-glycoprotein and P450 cytochromes. It may interact with sedatives due to its sedative action. It may also interact with bradycardic agents due to its bradycardia-inducing effects. The risk of peripheral neuropathy may be increased by concomitant treatment with other agents known to cause peripheral neuropathy. The risk of venous thromboembolisms with thalidomide seems to be increased when patients are treated with oral contraceptives or other cytotoxic agents (including doxorubicin and melphalan) concurrently. Thalidomide may interfere with the contraceptive effects of various contraceptives and hence it is advised that women of reproductive age use at least two different means of contraception to ensure that no child will be conceived while they are receiving thalidomide.

===Overdose===

Eighteen cases of overdoses have been reported to date with doses of up to 14.4 g without any reported fatalities. No specific antidote for overdoses exist and treatment is purely supportive.

==Mechanism of action==

The precise mechanism of action for thalidomide is unknown but possible mechanisms include anti-angiogenic and oxidative stress-inducing effects.[tpl]cite journal|title=Thalidomide: The Tragedy of Birth Defects and the Effective Treatment of Disease|journal=Toxicological Sciences|date=July 2011|volume=122|issue=1|pages=1–6|doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfr088|pmid=21507989|author=Kim, JH; Scialli, AR|url=http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/122/1/1.full.pdf|format=PDF[/tpl] It also inhibits TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 production,[tpl]cite journal|title=Thalidomide in cancer|journal=Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy|date=February 2002|volume=56|issue=1|pages=4–12|doi=10.1016/S0753-3322(01)00146-9|pmid=11905508|author=Singhal, S; Mehta, J[/tpl] modulates the production of IFN-γ and enhances the production of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-5 by immune cells. It increases lymphocyte count, costimulates T cells and modulates natural killer cell cytotoxicity. It also inhibits NF-κB and COX-2 activity.
In 1990 a group of researchers in Brazil noted that TNF alpha levels went up in leprosy reactional states and observed that TNF levels decreased in some patients on treatment with thalidomide, hence potentially explaining the efficacy of thalidomide in treating ENL.[tpl]cite journal|author=Sarno EN, Grau GE, Vieira LM, Nery JA|title=Serum levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta during leprosy reactional states |journal=Clin. Exp. Immunol.|volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=103–8 |date=April 1991|pmid=2015700|pmc=1535359[/tpl]
The mechanism of thalidomide's teratogenic action has led to over 2000 research papers and the proposal of 15 or 16 plausible mechanisms.[tpl]cite journal |author=Stephens TD, Bunde CJ, Fillmore BJ |title=Mechanism of action in thalidomide teratogenesis |journal=Biochem. Pharmacol. |volume=59 |issue=12|pages=1489–99|date=June 2000|pmid=10799645|doi=10.1016/S0006-2952(99)00388-3[/tpl] Angiogenesis is critical during limb development of the foetus. Thalidomide can directly inhibit angiogenesis induced by bFGF or VEGF in vivo.[tpl]cite pmid|7513432[/tpl] Teratogenic analogs inhibit angiogenesis whereas nonteratogenic analogs do not inhibit angiogenesis. In 2009, research by other groups confirmed "conclusively that loss of newly formed blood vessels is the primary cause of thalidomide teratogenesis, and developing limbs are particularly susceptible because of their relatively immature, highly angiogenic vessel network".[tpl]cite journal|author=Therapontos C, Erskine L, Gardner ER, Figg WD, Vargesson N |title=Thalidomide induces limb defects by preventing angiogenic outgrowth during early limb formation |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=106|issue=21|pages=8573–8|date=May 2009|pmid=19433787 |pmc=2688998 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0901505106 |bibcode=2009PNAS..106.8573T|jstor=40482723[/tpl] Thus the accepted theory is that inhibition of angiogenesis is the mechanism of teratogenicity as originally proposed by D'Amato in 1994.

Thalidomide was developed by German pharmaceutical company Chemie Grünenthal (now Grünenthal GmbH).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.contergan.grunenthal.info/grt-ctg/GRT-CTG/Die_Fakten/Chronologie/152700079.jsp|title=Thalidomide chronology on Grünenthal Web site |publisher=Contergan.grunenthal.info |accessdate=2013-05-22[/tpl]Thalidomide's Secret Past: The Link with Nazi Germany -Onco'Zine - The International Oncology Network (November 30, 2013) After obtaining a twenty-year patent in April 1954, Chemie Grünenthal started clinical trials and as early as November 1956 marketed thalidomide for the treatment of respiratory infections under the trade name Grippex, a combination drug that contained thalidomide, quinine, vitamin C, phenactin and acetylsalicylic-acid.
Researchers at Chemie Grünenthal also found that thalidomide was a particularly effective antiemetic that had an inhibitory effect on morning sickness.[tpl]cite journal |author=Franks ME, Macpherson GR, Figg WD|title=Thalidomide|journal=Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9423 |pages=1802–11 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15172781 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16308-3[/tpl] Hence, on October 1, 1957, the company launched thalidomide and began aggressively marketing it under the trade name Contergan®.[tpl]cite journal | author = Moghe VV,  Kulkarni U, Parmar UI | year = 2008 | title = Thalidomide|journal = Bombay Hospital Journal | publisher = Bombay Hospital | location = Bombay | volume = 50 | issue = 3 | page = 446 |url =http://www.bhj.org/journal/2008_5003_july/download/page-472-476.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=25 October 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl] It was proclaimed a "wonder drug" for insomnia, coughs, colds and headaches.
During this time period the use of medications during pregnancy was not strictly controlled, and drugs were not thoroughly tested for potential harm to the foetus. Thousands of pregnant women took the drug to relieve their symptoms. At the time of the drug's development, scientists did not believe any drug taken by a pregnant woman could pass across the placental barrier and harm the developing foetus, even though the effect of alcohol on foetal development had been documented by case studies on alcoholic mothers since at least 1957.See Rouquette (1957) cited by [tpl]cite journal |author=Landesman-Dwyer S |title=Maternal drinking and pregnancy outcome |journal=Appl Res Ment Retard |volume=3|issue=3|pages=241–63|year=1982|pmid=7149705 |doi=10.1016/0270-3092(82)90018-2[/tpl]  There soon appeared reports of findings of abnormalities in children being born, traced back to the use of the drug thalidomide. In late 1959, it was noticed that peripheral neuritis developed in patients who took the drug over a period of time, and it was only after this point that thalidomide ceased to be provided over-the-counter.[tpl]cite journal|author=Kelsey FO|title=Events after thalidomide |journal=J.

Hence, while initially considered safe, the drug was responsible for teratogenic deformities in children born after their mothers used it during pregnancies, prior to the third trimester. In November 1961, thalidomide was taken off the market due to massive pressure from the press and public.Bundesverband Contergangeschädigter e.V (German Website; Last accessed on December 3, 2013) Experts estimate that the drug thalidomide led to the death of approximately 2,000 children and serious birth defects in more than 10,000 children, about 5,000 of them in the Federal Republic of Germany (then most commonly known as West Germany). The regulatory authorities in the German Democratic Republic, as the former communist East Germany was called, did not approve thalidomide. One reason for the initially unobserved side effects of the drug and the subsequent approval in Germany was that at that time drugs did not have to be tested for (teratogenic effects). They had only been tested on rodents, as was usual at the time.VFA: teratogenic effects 6. July 2011.page of Grünethal GmbH 3. July 2011
Thalidomide became one of the most successful prescription drugs in the history of medicine. In the UK, the British pharmaceutical company The Distillers Company (Biochemicals) Ltd, a subsidiary of Distillers Co. Ltd. (now part of Diageo plc), marketed thalidomide under the brand name Distavel® as a remedy for morning sickness throughout the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Their advertisement claimed that "Distavel can be given with complete safety to pregnant women and nursing mothers without adverse effect on mother or child...Outstandingly safe Distavel has been prescribed for nearly three years in this country."  Around the world, more and more pharmaceutical companies started to produce and market the drug under license from Chemie Grünenthal. By the mid 1950s, 14 pharmaceutical companies were marketing thalidomide in 46 countries under 37 (some reports suggest 51) different trade names.
In the U.S. representatives from Chemie Grünenthal approached Smith, Kline & French (SKF), now GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) with a request to market and distribute the drug in North America. A newly discovered memorandum (found hidden in 2010 the archives of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)) shows that, as part of their in-licensing approach, Smith, Kline and French conducted animal tests and ran a clinical trial of the drug in the United States involving 875 people, including pregnant women, in 1956–57. In 1956 researchers at SKF involved in clinical trials, noted that even when used in very high doses thalidomide could not induce sleep in mice. And when administered at doses 50 to 650 times larger than that claimed by Chemie Grunenthal to be "sleep inducing" the researchers could still not achieve the hypnotic effect in animals that it had on man. After completion of the trial, and based on reasons kept hidden for decades, SKF declined to commercialize the drug. Later, Chemie Grünenthal, in 1958, reached an agreement with William S Merrell Company in Cincinnati, Ohio (later Richardson-Merrell, now part of Sanofi) to market and distribute thalidomide throughout the United States.
The U.S FDA refused to approve thalidomide for marketing and distribution. However, the drug was distributed in large quantities for testing purposes, after the American distributor and manufacturer Richardson-Merrell had applied for its approval in September, 1960. The official in charge of the FDA, Frances Oldham Kelsey, did not rely on information from the company which did not include any test results. Richardson-Merrell was called on to perform tests and report the results. The company refused and demanded approval six times, and was refused each time. Nevertheless, a total of 17 children with thalidomide-induced malformations were born.Report on the website of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
In Canada, the history of the drug thalidomide dates back to April 1, 1961. There were many different forms sold, with the most common variant being Talimol.[tpl]cite journal |author=Webb JF |title=Canadian Thalidomide Experience |journal=Can Med Assoc J |volume=89 |issue= |pages=987–92 |date=November 1963 |pmid=14076167 |pmc=1921912[/tpl] Two months after Talimol went on sale, pharmaceutical companies sent physicians letters warning about the risk of birth defects. It was not until March 2, 1962 that both drugs were banned from the Canadian market by the FDD, and soon afterward physicians were warned to destroy their supplies.

===Birth defects crisis===

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, more than 10,000 children in 46 countries were born with deformities such as phocomelia as a consequence of thalidomide use.[tpl]cite news | author = Bren L | title =Frances Oldham Kelsey: FDA Medical Reviewer Leaves Her Mark on History | url =http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps1609/www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html | work =FDA Consumer|publisher =U.S. Food and Drug Administration | date =2001-02-28 | accessdate =2009-12-23 [/tpl] It is not known exactly how many worldwide victims of the drug there have been, although estimates range from 10,000 to 20,000. Despite the side effects, thalidomide was sold in pharmacies in Canada until 1962; Canada was the last country to end sales of the drug.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=21267|title=Turning Points of History–Prescription for Disaster|publisher=History Television|accessdate=24 February 2010[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl]
In the United Kingdom, the drug was licensed in 1958 and withdrawn in 1961. Of the approximately 2,000 babies born with defects, around half died within a few months and 466 survived to at least 2010.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8458855.stm|title=Apology for thalidomide survivors|date=14 January 2010|work=BBCNews:Health|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2010-01-14[/tpl]
The Australian obstetrician William McBride and the German paediatrician Widukind Lenz suspected a link between birth defects and the drug, a theory Lenz proved in 1961.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1002.html|title=Widukind Lenz|last=Anon|work=who name it?|publisher= Ole Daniel Enersen|accessdate=2009-05-01[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2031459.stm|title=Thalidomide:40 years on|last=Anon|work=BBC news|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-05-01 | date=2002-06-07[/tpl] McBride was later awarded a number of honors, including a medal and prize money by L'Institut de la Vie in Paris.[tpl]cite web|url=http://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/Defect/page5i.htm |title=Report of Thalidomide at University of New South Wales |publisher=Embryology.med.unsw.edu.au |accessdate=2012-12-30[/tpl]
The head of the East German central pharmacy control commission, Friedrich Jung, suspected an antivitaminic effect of thalidomide as derivative of glutamic acid.[tpl]cite web |url=https://www.neues-deutschland.de/artikel/120351.html |title=DDR-Bürger schliefen ohne Contergan |trans_title=East German citizens slept without thalidomide |language=German |work=Neues Deutschland |date=4 November 2007 |accessdate=Jun 6, 2013[/tpl] It took some time before the increase in dysmelia at the end of the 1950s was connected with thalidomide. In 1958 Karl Beck, a former pediatric doctor in Bayreuth wrote an article in a local newspaper claiming a relationship between nuclear weapons testing and cases of dysmelia in children. Based on this, FDPwhip Erich Mende requested an official statement from the federal government. For statistical reasons, the main data series used to research dysmelia cases started by chance at the same time as the approval date for thalidomide.[tpl]cite journal |archiveurl=http://www.contergan-ag50.de/Seiten/presse/20111125-27_artikel/2007_Die_Contergan-Katastrophe_Die_truegerische_Sicherheit_der_harten_Daten-Deutsches_Aerzteblatt.pdf |archivedate=December 6, 2011|deadurl=no|url=http://www.aerzteblatt.de/archiv/57224/ |accessdate=June 6, 2013 |first=Klaus-Dieter |last=Thomann |title=Die Contergan-Katastrophe: Die trügerische Sicherheit der "harten" Daten |trans_title=The thalidomide disaster: The false security of 'hard' data|language=German|journal=Deutsches Ärzteblatt |year=2007 |volume=104 |issue=41 |pages=A-2778 / B-2454 / C-2382[/tpl] After the Nazi regime with its Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring used mandatory statistical monitoring to commit various crimes, western Germany had been very reluctant to monitor congenital disorders in a similarly strict way.Die Contergankatastrophe: Eine Bilanz Nach 40 Jahren, Ludwig Zichner, Michael A. Rauschmann, Klaus-Dieter Thomann, Gabler Wissenschaftsverlage, 2005 – 190 Seiten The parliamentary report rejected any relation with radioactivity and the abnormal increase of dysmelia. Also the DFG research project installed after the Mende request was not helpful. The project was led by pathologist Franz Büchner who ran the project to propagate his teratological theory. Büchner saw lack of healthy nutrition and behavior of the mothers as being more important than genetic reasons.Furthermore, it took a while to install a Surgeon General in Germany; the Federal Ministry of Health (Germany) was not founded until 1962, some months after thalidomide was banned from the market. In Germany approximately 2,500 thalidomide babies were born.
Several countries either restricted the drug's use or never approved it. Ingeborg Eichler, a member of the Austrian pharmaceutical admission conference enforced thalidomide (tradename Softenon) being sold under the rules of prescription medication and as a result relatively few affected children were born in Austria and Switzerland.[tpl]cite web |url=http://orf.at/070930-17124/index.html|title=10.000 Fälle von Missbildungen |trans_title=10,000 cases of malformations |language=German |publisher=ORF|accessdate=June 6, 2013[/tpl] In the United States, pharmacologist Frances Oldham Kelsey M.D. withstood pressure from the Richardson-Merrell company and refused Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market thalidomide, saying further studies were needed. This reduced the impact of thalidomide in United States patients. Although thalidomide was never approved for sale in the United States at the time, millions of tablets had been distributed to physicians during a clinical testing program. It was impossible to know how many pregnant women had been given the drug to help alleviate morning sickness or as a sedative.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.birthdefects.org/research/bendectin_1.php|title=How a Commonly Used Drug Caused Birth Defects|last=Mekdeci|first=Betty[/tpl]

===Aftermath of scandal===

For correctly denying the application despite the pressure from Richardson-Merrell, Kelsey eventually received the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service at a 1962 ceremony with President John F. Kennedy. In September 2010, the FDA honored Kelsey with the first Kelsey award. The award, given annually to an FDA staff member, came 50 years after Kelsey, then a new medical officer at the agency, first reviewed the application from the William S. Merrell Company of Cincinnati.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/health/14kelsey.html?_r=1&8dpc|title=The Public's Quiet Savior From Harmful Medicines|date=13 September 2010|work=The New York Times[/tpl]
In 1968, a large criminal trial began in Germany, charging several Grünenthal officials with negligent homicide and injury. 
After Grünenthal settled with the victims in April 1970, the trial ended in December 1970 with no finding of guilt. As part of the settlement, Grünenthal paid 100 million DM into a special foundation; the German government added 320 million DM. The foundation paid victims a one-time sum of 2,500-25,000 DM (depending on severity of disability) and a monthly stipend of 100-450 DM. The monthly stipends have since been raised substantially and are now paid entirely by the government (as the foundation had run out of money). Grünenthal paid another 50 million Euros into the foundation in 2008.
The numerous reports of malformations in babies brought about the awareness of the side effects of the drug on pregnant women. The birth defects caused by the drug thalidomide can range from moderate malformation to more severe forms. Possible birth defects include phocomelia, dysmelia, amelia, bone hypoplasticity, and other congenital defects affecting the ear, heart, or internal organs. Franks et al. looked at how the drug affected newborn babies, the severity of their deformities, and reviewed the drug in its early years. Webb in 1963 also reviewed the history of the drug and the different forms of birth defects it had caused. “The most common form of birth defects from thalidomide is shortened limbs, with the arms being more frequently affected. This syndrome is the presence of deformities of the long bones of the limbs resulting in shortening and other abnormalities.”
In 1968, after a long campaign by The Sunday Times, a compensation settlement for the UK victims was reached with Distillers Company (now part of Diageo), which had distributed the drug in the UK.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3589173.stm|title=They just didn't know what it would do|last=Ryan|first=Caroline|date=1 April 2004|work=BBC News:Health|publisher=BBC news|accessdate=2009-05-01[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article3602694.ece|title=Thalidomide: the battle for compensation goes on|last=Flintoff|first=John-Paul|date=March 23, 2008|work=The Sunday Times|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd.|accessdate=2009-05-01|location=London[/tpl] This compensation, which is distributed by the Thalidomide Trust in the UK, was substantially increased by Diageo in 2005.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4658919.stm |title=Compensation offer on Thalidomide|publisher=BBC News|date=7 July 2005  |accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl] The UK Government gave survivors a grant of £20 million, to be distributed through the Thalidomide Trust, in December 2009.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8428838.stm|title=Thalidomide survivors to get £20m |publisher=BBC News |date=23 December 2009  |accessdate=26 July 2011[/tpl]
Melbourne woman Lynette Rowe, who was born without limbs, is leading an Australian class action lawsuit against the drug's manufacturer, Grünenthal, which fought to have the case heard in Germany. The Victorian Supreme Court dismissed Grünenthal's application in 2012, and the case was heard in Australia. More than a hundred Australian thalidomide survivors are involved in the class action, according to Rowe's lawyer.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-12-19/australian-thalidomide-victims-win-hearing-bid/3738116|title=Australian thalidomide victims win right for hearing|date=19 December 2011|newspaper=ABC News[/tpl] On 17 July 2012, Lynette Rowe was awarded an out-of-court settlement, believed to be in the millions of dollars and paving the way for class action victims to receive further compensation.
On 31 August 2012, Grünenthal chief executive Harald F. Stock, PhD, who served as the Chief Executive Officer of Grünenthal GmbH from January 2009 to May 28, 2013 and was also a Member of Executive Board until May 28, 2013, apologized for the first time for producing the drug and remaining silent about the birth defects.Speech on the occasion of the inauguration of Thalidomide-Memorial; Grünenthal GmbH Website (Last accessed on December 3, 2013) At a ceremony, Stock unveiled a statue of a disabled child to symbolize those harmed by thalidomide and apologized for not trying to reach out to victims for over 50 years. At the time of the apology, there were 5,000 to 6,000 sufferers still alive. Victim advocates called the apology "insulting" and "too little, too late", and criticized the company for not compensating victims. They also criticized the company for their claim that no one could have known the harm the drug caused, arguing that there were plenty of red flags at the time.[tpl]cite news |title=Thalidomide apology insulting, campaigners say|date=September 1, 2012 |work=BBC News |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19448046[/tpl]
The drug thalidomide's birth defects in children affected many people's lives, and from these events came the formation of the group called The Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada, a group of 120 Canadian survivors.[tpl]cite journal|last=Warren|first=Randolph|title=Living in a World With Thalidomide: A Dose of Reality |journal=FDA Consumer |date=May–April 2001|volume=35|issue=2|page=40 |pmid=11444250|url=http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps1609/www.fda.gov/fdac/departs/2001/201_word.html[/tpl] Their goal was to prevent future usage of drugs that could be of potential harm to mothers and babies. The members from the thalidomide victims association were involved in the STEPS program, which aimed to prevent teratogenicity.
The effects of thalidomide increased fears regarding the safety of pharmaceutical drugs. The Society of Toxicology of Canada was formed after the events of thalidomide were made public, focusing on toxicology as a discipline separate from pharmacology.[tpl]cite journal |author=Racz WJ, Ecobichon DJ, Baril M |title=On-line sources of toxicological information in Canada|journal=Toxicology |volume=190 |issue=1-2 |pages=3–14 |date=August 2003 |pmid=12909394 |doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(03)00192-6[/tpl] The need for the testing and approval of the toxins in certain pharmaceutical drugs became more important after the disaster. The Society of Toxicology of Canada is responsible for the Conservation Environment Protection Act, focusing on researching the impact to human health of chemical substances. Thalidomide brought on changes in the way drugs are tested, what type of drugs are used during pregnancy, and increased the awareness of potential side effects of drugs.

====Notable people affected====

====Change in drug regulations====

The disaster prompted many countries to introduce tougher rules for the testing and licensing of drugs, such as the Kefauver Harris Amendment[tpl]cite web|title=50 Years: The Kefauver-Harris Amendments|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/NewsEvents/ucm320924.htm|publisher=Food and Drug Administration (United States)|accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl]  (U.S.) and Directive 65/65/EEC1 (E.U.).[tpl]cite web|title=Thalidomide|url=http://www.crncc.nihr.ac.uk/workforce_development/learning_and_development/gcp/gcp_resource/research_standards/history/thalidomide|publisher=National Health Service (England)|accessdate=6 June 2013[/tpl] In the United States, the new regulations strengthened the FDA, among other ways, by requiring applicants to prove efficacy and to disclose all side-effects encountered in testing. The FDA subsequently initiated the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation to reclassify drugs already on the market. Industry critics including David Healy have argued that such measures have not been sufficient.Pharmageddon

==Thalidomide analogs==

The exploration of the antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory activities of thalidomide has led to the study and creation of thalidomide analogs.Synthesis and enantiomeric separation of 2-phthalimidino-glutaric acid analogues: potent inhibitors of tumor metastasis.

Interest turned to Pomalidomide, a derivative of thalidomide marketed by Celgene. It is a very active anti-angiogenic and also acts as an immunomodulator.
