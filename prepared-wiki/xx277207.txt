Snapshot is an indie platform game developer by Retro Affect released on 30 August 2012 for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS.

==Gameplay==

The player controls a character with fairly standard 2-D controls: left, right and jump.  The player also controls a camera viewfinder, the Snapshot of the title, with the mouse.  When a snapshot is taken of an in-game object, it disappears from the gameworld and is stored on the camera, the stored images can then be pasted into new parts of the gameworld to overcome an obstacle.
In addition to completing the individual levels, there are also awards given for collecting all stars in a level, beating time challenges and taking snapshots of specific items in a level and retaining them until the level is exited.

==Development==

Snapshot was the second project by a Tempe, Arizona-based developer Kyle Pulver who developed the game together with Retro Affect.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/18/12-top-indie-developers-talk-games?page=8 |title=12 Top Indie Developers Talk Games |first=Colin |last=Campbell |date=18 December 2012 |work=IGN |publisher=j2 Global |accessdate=8 August 2013[/tpl]
