===Roads and highways===

Urban road infrastructure is overburdened on workdays and in certain areas; the city street plan is not at all rectilinear, and may be confusing even to experienced drivers. However, there are no toll roads; entrances, exits, main streets and important zones are all well-signposted.
Las Palmas, being the centre of the Las Palmas metropolitan area, is the hub for the island's motorway network. The city is linked with three highways: the GC-1 to the south, the GC-2 to the west and GC-3 to the center of the island.
The GC-1 links the capital with Puerto Rico in the south. It is the fastest route from the top of the island to the bottom and vice versa with a speed limit of [tpl]convert|120|km/h|mph|abbr=on[/tpl]. It is approximately [tpl]convert|75|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] in length and runs along the eastern and the southern coasts, and is also the second longest superhighway in the Canary Islands. The road provides easy access from the airport to the major cities and resorts, which include Maspalomas and Playa del Inglés. The increase in tourism over the years has necessitated the route's upgrading and widening to cope with traffic growth. The GC-1 begins south of the downtown area of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, the highway runs within the beach of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and [tpl]convert|2|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] south intersects with the GC-2 and later runs with a few clover leaf interchanges and later forms a junction with GC-5 and south, the GC-31.
The GC-2 North Highway connects Las Palmas with the small northern port and village of Agaete. The eastern portion – about [tpl]convert|20|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in length – is a superhighway with interchange numbers, the rest of the highway is a two-laned; the western part is also only two-laned and has exit numbers. The highway begins by the beach area of the island, and runs through the downtown area, linking with the GC31 at a roundabout interchange. The freeway runs within the beaches and the coastline of the Atlantic Ocean for the half part but at around the 20th km, it becomes a highway after the unidirectional parclo interchanges and runs within the coastline, it later has several interchanges and several towns as it passes to the northwest and finally, it ends in Agaete.

===Airport===

Las Palmas is served by Gran Canaria Airport, often called Las Palmas Airport [tpl]airport codes|LPA|GCLP[/tpl]. In 2008, it handled 10,212,106 passengers,.AENA passenger and aircraft movements for 2008[tpl]dead link|date=March 2011[/tpl] This airport handled [tpl]convert|33695248|kg|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of cargo, and is the fourth busiest in Spain.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl] It is also the only airport on the islands with two runways, thus can accommodate up to 53 landings and take-offs per hour. The lengthy runways made the airport an alternative landing site for the NASA Space Shuttle.[tpl]cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/facility/sts-els.htm |title=Space Shuttle Emergency Landing Sites |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=27 April 2005 |accessdate=11 March 2011[/tpl] Also this airport is a base for Binter Canarias and Navegacion y Servicios Aéreos Canarios, airlines which operate regional inter-island flights within the Canary Islands. The Airport is located in the eastern part of the island, about [tpl]convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on[/tpl] from the Las Palmas city center.
An airbase of the Spanish Air Force is located to the east of the runways. Beyond several hangars opposite the passenger terminal, the Gando Air Base (Base Aérea de Gando) contains ten shelters situated on the southern end of the eastern runway.

===Seaport===

Puerto de Las Palmas (Las Palmas Port), also known as 'Puerto de la Luz', is a main port for fishing, commercial, passenger and sports in the northwest of the city. It has been the traditional base for scale and supplying ships on their way through the Middle Atlantic for five centuries. The Port of Las Palmas is not only the first port of the Canary Islands, it is one of the main ports of Spain and the first of the geographical area of West Africa. As the leading port in the mid-Atlantic, it serves as the crossroads between Europe, Africa and America. In 2007, the port received some 11,262 ships; it welcomed a total of 907,782 cruise passengers, a 16.26% increase on 2006. In terms of annual TEU, the port of Las Palmas ranks as the 5th in Spain, and is among the first 15 ports of Europe.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl]
The Port of Las Palmas is the first Mid-Atlantic fishing base, with an annual traffic of more than 4,500 stopovers and with some 400,000 tons of frozen fish processed.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl] Despite experiencing some decline in recent years,[tpl]when|date=March 2011[/tpl] it retains its dominance in the fishing industry over other ports in the Canary Islands. The port provides [tpl]convert|175000|m3|0|abbr=on[/tpl] of cold storage facilities.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2011[/tpl] At the foot of pier, special refrigerated containers and preparation rooms for frozen products owned by Trastainer can carry out the entire chain of post-processing and storage of fish, from refrigeration and distribution, to manufacture and supply of industrial ice. The port's EU-approved border inspection post is responsible for inspecting all types of imports and exports between the European Economic Union and its trading partners.

===Public transportation===

Las Palmas boasts a high quality bus system, provided by Guaguas Municipales.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.guaguas.com/ |title=Inicio |publisher=Guaguas.com |date= |accessdate=11 March 2011[/tpl] Municipal Bus Lines offers 40 urban transport routes, covering both the bottom and the top of the city. The main lines are the 1 (Teatro - Puerto), 2 (Alameda de Colón - Puerto), 17 (Teatro - El Rincón), 25 (Campus Universitario - El Rincón), 12 (Puerto - Hoya de la Plata) and 30 (Alameda de Colón - Santa Catalina, via Rehoyas). In addition, two circular lines (A: Santa Catalina - Santa Catalina, via Alcaraveneras) and B (Santa Catalina - Santa Catalina, via Ciudad Alta).
The most important bus lines have frequencies of between 3 and 15 minutes during the day and between 10 and 40 minutes at night; most lines have service throughout the night. The bright yellow buses are known simply as 'guaguas'. The unique tarif, paid directly to the driver, is 1.30 euro. A 10-ride ticket is available for €7.50 at official shops in the city. The Tarjeta Insular (Island Card) which offered a 20% discount on both municipal buses and Global buses was discontinued on 1 January 2011.
Global, inter-hire company, has 119 lines, many to or from the capital. This company was formed in 2000, resulting from the merger of the previous Salcai and interurban lines Utinsa.
There is also the Guagua Turística, which covers the most interesting sites of the city with a guide in several languages.

====Under construction====

El Tren de Gran Canaria (TG) is a rail project initially proposed as an alternative way to get from Las Palmas to Maspalomas[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canarias7.es/articulo.cfm?Id=92414 |title=El tren de Gran Canaria pasará de la capital al sur de Gran Canaria |publisher=Canarias7.es |date= |accessdate=11 March 2011[/tpl] but was later raised to Agaete extension.
Another project is the Tramway Palmas (Gran Canaria), which would cover the same journey as the bus line 1, with an average frequency of 5 minutes and a journey time of 35 minutes.
