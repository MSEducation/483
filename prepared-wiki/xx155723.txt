Agriprocessors was the corporate identity of a slaughterhouse and meat-packaging factory based in Postville, Iowa, best known as a facility for the glatt kosher processing of cattle, as well as chicken, turkey, duck,  and lamb. Agriprocessors' meat and poultry products were marketed under the brand Iowa Best Beef.  Its kosher products were marketed under various labels, including Aaron’s Best, Shor Habor, Supreme Kosher and Rubashkins.
The firm was founded and owned by Aaron Rubashkin, who purchased the meat-packing facility in 1987, and managed by two of his sons, Sholom Rubashkin and Heshy Rubashkin. Eventually it became the largest kosher meat-packing plant in the United States.
Agriprocessors faced accusations of mistreatment of cattle, pollution, and a series of alleged violations of labor law. In May 2008, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) staged a raid of the plant, and arrested nearly 400 illegal immigrant workers. Agriprocessors plants stopped operating in October 2008, and the firm filed for bankruptcy on November 5 of the same year. Sholom Rubashkin as the highest ranking day-to-day corporate officer was charged with federal financial fraud and sentenced to 27 years in prison in June 2010. 
The Agriprocessors plant was bought at auction in July 2009 by SHF Industries and has resumed production under the new name Agri Star.

==History==

In the 1980s Aaron Rubashkin, a Lubavitcher Hasidic butcher from Brooklyn, decided to take advantage of economic structural changes to bring mass-production to the kosher meat production business. In 1987 he bought an abandoned slaughterhouse outside Postville, a town undergoing a major employment crisis in northeastern Iowa and opened a processing plant creating some 350 jobs. Two of his sons were put in charge, Sholom Rubashkin, the second youngest as CEO,According to must sources. However, his being formally appointed as CEO is disputed and Heshy Rubashkin, the youngest, as vice president of marketing and sales. In 1992, Agriprocessors added poultry to its offerings. At its peak the plant employed over 800 people, killing more than 500 head of cattle each day in kosher production. The sales, according to numbers given to Cattle Buyers Weekly, rose from $80 million in 1997 to $180 million in 2002 and may have reached $250 million or more.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.forward.com/articles/14716/|title=How the Rubashkins Changed the Way Jews Eat in America. The Rise and Fall of Agriprocessors Is the Story of an Immigrant Family Gone Awry| publisher=The Jewish Daily Forward|author=Nathaniel Popper|date=December 11, 2008|accessdate=June 18, 2010[/tpl]
Rubashkin brought modern industrial methods to what has historically been a small, almost boutique craft, developing retail-ready glatt kosher products being sold both in supermarkets and in small, local grocery stores and meat markets around the United States. Agriprocessors was the largest (glatt) kosher meat producer in the United States and the only one authorized by Israel's Orthodox rabbinate to export beef to Israel.
In the 20 years it operated in Postville, Agriprocessors had a major impact on the town, creating new jobs, attracting immigrants from many different countries, and bringing an influx of Orthodox Jews to a part of the United States where Jews had been practically unknown.
The Rubashkin family opened another processing plant for bison, cattle and lamb called Local Pride Plant in conjunction with the Oglala Lakota native-American tribe of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in Gordon, Nebraska in 2006 employing some 100 locals. The presence of the plant near an Indian reservation provided considerable tax breaks for Rubashkin. Governor Dave Heineman presented a $505,000 gratuity check to Rubashkin on behalf of the city of Gordon, as part of an incentive package that brought the factory to the town.[tpl]cite news |publisher=Lincoln Journal Star| url=http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2006/06/30/local/doc44a4a1f44a328219659142.txt |title=Tribe, Jewish family open kosher packing plant|date=June 30, 2006|author=Joe Duggan|accessdate=June 16, 2910[/tpl]
Agriprocessors had two distribution sites, one in Brooklyn, New York, and one in Miami, Florida, both managed by members of the Rubashkin family. It also operated slaughter facilities in South America.

==Controversies==

The Agriprocessors plants have often been controversial because of frequent citations for illegal practices such as animal abuse, food safety violations,Noncompliance Records Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) violations of environmental laws, child labor laws, and the recruitment of illegal immigrants and inducing them to work in often dangerous conditions at illegal wages.
The controversies have also split the Jewish communities,[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/features/group_ends_agriprocessors_boycott|title=Group Ends Agriprocessors Boycott|publisher=The Jewish Week|author=Debra Nussbaum Cohen |date=July 9, 2008 |accessdate=June 16, 2010[/tpl] raised questions of Jewish ethics, and brought about a new consciousness for a Jewish way of eating beyond fulfilling the technical requirements of kashrut.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/magazine/12kosher-t.html?ref=agriprocessors_inc|title=Kosher Wars |publisher=The New York Times Magazine|author=Samantha M.

===Animal abuse===

In late 2004, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) released a video filmed undercover at Agriprocessors, showing gory details of cattle having their tracheas and esophagi being ripped out of their necks and surviving for minutes after shechita (ritual slaughter).PETA Video showing animal abuse (Caution: graphic) Noted animal welfare expert and meat scientist Dr. Temple Grandin called Agriprocessors procedures an "atrocious abomination" and worse than anything she had ever seen in over 30 kosher abattoirs.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/01/national/01kosher.html?pagewanted=print&position=|title=Videos Cited in Calling Kosher Slaughterhouse Inhumane|publisher=New York Times|author=Donald G. McNeil Jr.|date=December 1, 2004|accessdate=June 16, 2010[/tpl]
Jewish authorities were split, with former Chief Rabbi of Ireland, David Rosen,Statement of Rabbi David Rosen, Former Chief Rabbi of Ireland and Shechita UK, along with many non-Orthodox rabbis from the Conservative movement, criticizing Agriprocessors, while Orthodox kashrut organizations continued to stand by the kashrut of the meat. Under pressure from the Agriculture Department, the Orthodox Union kosher certification authority and Israel's chief rabbinate, the plant changed its practices.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/10/national/10kosher.html?_r=3&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin&oref=slogin |title=Inquiry Finds Lax Federal Inspections at Kosher Meat Plant|publisher=New York Times|author=Donald G. McNeil Jr.|date=March 10, 2006| accessdate=June 16, 2010[/tpl]
In 2005 an internal report from the USDA not only held that Agriprocessors engaged in acts of inhumane slaughter, but that USDA inspectors were sleeping on the job, playing computer games, and had accepted bribes of free meat to ignore violations at the plant.
On June 27, 2006, at the suggestion of Rabbi Menachem Genack of the Orthodox Union, Dr. Grandin toured the facility.  According to the Orthodox Union, Dr. Grandin was satisfied with what she saw.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.forward.com/articles/394/|title=Animal-rights Expert Endorses Kosher Plant|publisher=The Jewish Daily Forward|author=Nathaniel Popper|date=July 7, 2006|accessdate=June 16, 2010[/tpl] In 2008, though, Grandin reported that Agriprocessors had again become "sloppy" in their slaughter operation and was "in the bottom 10%" of slaughterhouses.
Another PETA undercover video, reportedly taken on August 13, 2008, showed violations of the Humane Methods of Livestock Slaughter Act, including the use of saw-like, multiple, hacking cuts in the necks of still-conscious animals. Dr. Grandin said the second cuts would “definitely cause the animal pain.”[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/05/us/05immig.html|title=Kosher Plant Is Accused of Inhumane Slaughter|publisher=The New York Times|author=Julia Preston|date=September 5, 2008|accessdate=June 16, 2010[/tpl] The episode led Grandin to state that slaughterhouse visits were useless for determining proper animal treatment. Grandin suggested that Agriprocessors install internet video cams on the killing floor for constant, independent, oversight.

===Pollution===

In 2004, city authorities started an investigation against Agriprocessors due to complaints from local residents that the firm routinely deposited untreated effluent into local rivers in breach of regulations. On August 31, 2006, Agriprocessors signed a consent decree where they essentially admitted discharging untreated slaughtering wastewater into the Postville sewer system, in violation of Federal and Iowa State law and paid a $600,000 fine for violating waste-water regulations.AgriProcessors Inc. Wastewater Settlement LawyersandSettlements.com Untreated wastewater from abattoirs is a heavy burden on wastewater treatment plants because of its high biochemical oxygen demand and high concentration of FOG (Fats, oils, and grease) which can form insoluble plaques in sewage pipes.

===Labor relations===

In September 2005, workers at Agriprocessors’ distribution site in Brooklyn voted to join the United Food and Commercial Workers union. The company did not recognize the vote, arguing that it was invalid because management had discovered that many of the workers who participated were in the US illegally, making their votes invalid despite protection granted undocumented workers in the National Labor Relations Act. A National Labor Relations Board judge decided against the company and ordered it to recognize the vote. Workers alleged that Agriprocessors paid low wages, failed to pay overtime and immediately terminated employment of workers who complained about conditions or wages.
On August 20, 2008, Jewish employees at Agriprocessors were reported to have staged a 30-minute walkout over delayed payment of wages and other compensation issues.
In October 2008, the Iowa Labor Commission fined Agriprocessors $9.99 million for various violations of state labor law, including illegally deducting money from employees for safety equipment and failing to pay employees.

===Anti-competitive practices===

A December 2008 story in the Village Voice featured allegations of sharp business practices by the Rubashkins: intimidating rivals (with threats of physical violence), manipulation of the kosher certification system, collusion with suppliers to withhold supplies from competitors, etc.

===Federal immigration raid===

On 12 May 2008, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) staged a raid that was described as “largest criminal worksite enforcement operation in U.S. history”. Federal authorities arrested 389 immigrant workers during the raid, 305 of them on criminal charges, 297 were sentenced on federal felony charges for fraud-related offenses.[tpl]cite news |publisher=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) |url=http://www.ice.gov/news/releases/0805/080515waterloo.htm|title=297 convicted and sentenced following ICE worksite operation in Iowa.

According to the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of Iowa, those arrested “include 290 Guatemalans, 93 Mexicans, 2 Israelis and 4 Ukrainians”.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/17/AR2008051702474.html | publisher=The Washington Post | title=Immigration Raid Jars a Small Town | first= | author=Spencer S.

Sources quoted in the affidavit and application for search warrant alleged the existence of a methamphetamine laboratory at the slaughterhouse, and that employees carried weapons to work.[tpl]cite news |publisher=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/13/us/13immig.html?em&ex=1210910400&en=9fdf0d884661bdeb&ei=5070|title=Hundreds Are Arrested in US Sweep of Meat Plant|date=May 13, 2008|author=Susan Saulny|accessdate=April 23, 2010[/tpl] However, later press reports do not indicate that a methamphetamine laboratory was found during the search.
In late July, members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus met with workers and community leaders, after a United States House of Representatives' subcommittee had heard testimony about the raid and its impact on the families and the town,[tpl]cite news |title=Congress puts spotlight on abuses at Iowa plant| url=http://www.workdayminnesota.org/index.php?news_6_3734|publisher= Workday Minnesota| author=|date=July 28, 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2010[/tpl] and a rally with some 1,500 participants, organized by the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, Jewish Community Action and St. Bridget's Roman Catholic Church was held in Postville in support of the detained Agriprocessors workers and their families.[tpl]cite news |title=Postville takes center stage in immigration debate| url=http://www.workdayminnesota.org/index.php?news_6_3734|publisher= Workday Minnesota| author=Deborah Rosenstein|date=July 28, 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2010[/tpl]
The Rubashkin family was reported to have denied any criminal activity; Aaron Rubashkin said that “he had no idea that his workers were illegal and that they had produced what appeared to be legitimate work documents”. Nevertheless he announced shortly after the raid that he intends to replace his son as the company's CEO. Sholom Rubashkin remained in charge though. He was finally replaced as CEO in September 2008 by Bernard Feldman, a New York attorney who had worked as counsel for the family, after child labor charges against Aaron and Sholom Rubashkin had been announced, and the Orthodox Union had threatened to withdraw their kosher certification.[tpl]cite news |title=Averting Kosher Crisis, Meat Giant Hires Long-time Attorney to be New CEO| url=http://www.forward.com/articles/14273/|publisher=Jewish Daily Forward|author=Anthony Weiss|date=September 25, 2008|accessdate=June 24, 2010[/tpl]
The ICE raid left the company lacking employees, and it hired Labor Ready to supply "about 150 workers", but these workers stopped working because of alleged safety issues. The Jacobson Staffing company took the job of staffing the plant shortly thereafter. In June 2008, Agriprocessors began hiring workers from homeless shelters in Texas to replace employees detained in the federal immigration raid.

===Public relations===

In May 2008, following the federal immigration raid, PostvilleVoices.com, a site that claimed to be "a blog by people who live and work in Postville" and defended the firm's hiring practices, saying that "the people that run Agriprocessors are good, decent, honest people". After Postville residents suspected that this was a case of “astroturfing”, Getzel Rubashkin, son of Sholom Rubashkin, admitted he and two friends created the site.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-10-05/news/17136433_1_blog-plant-grassroots|title=Astroturfing invents fake grassroots support|first=Nigel|last=Duara|publisher=Associated Press|date=October 5, 2008[/tpl]
In June 2008, Agriprocessors retained Jim Martin, a former U.S. Attorney, as the company's outside CCO, hired 5W Public Relations to repair its public image, and Lubicom, a kosher consulting and PR firm headed by Menachem Lubinsky, to present its case to the New York Jewish community. Lubinsky was quoted as saying he “expected 5W to deal with negative publicity and blogs”.[tpl]cite news |title=Kosher Meat Giant Kicks Off P.R.

Shmarya Rosenberg, author of the Failed Messiah blog, uncovered that two posts under the name of Rabbi Morris Allen of Hechsher Tzedek, a critic of Agriprocessors, were part of a sockpuppeting scheme. Similar comments impersonating Rabbi Allen were found on the websites of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) and Vos Iz Neias. Ronn Torossian, CEO of 5W, admitted that a “senior staff member failed to be transparent in dealing with client matters.”[tpl]cite news |publisher=The Jewish Daily Forward|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/13759/|title=Meat Company’s P.R.

===Comments by Iowa Governor===

In August 2008, Iowa Governor Chet Culver commented on Agriprocessors:
He also directed Iowa state agencies to prohibit Agriprocessors from listing their jobs on state job lists, and ordered his Attorney General to prosecute all violations backed by sufficient evidence.

==Bankruptcy==

On November 5, 2008 Agriprocessor filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Factors cited included a loss of most of the workforce due to the May 2008 immigration raid, declining demand for the firm's products, and increased costs in the aftermath of the raid.
The Associated Press reported that “Agriprocessors in its bankruptcy filing said the company owed $50 million to $100 million to creditors. The move appears to be an effort to pre-empt foreclosure by a St. Louis bank, which sued Agriprocessors for defaulting on a $35 million loan”.
In December, the bankruptcy court approved a $2.5 million loan for Agriprocessors to allow it to resume poultry processing through at least January 9, 2009 (about 750,000 chickens).[tpl]cite news|title=Agriprocessors Wins Funding Despite Debt and Controversy|date=December 3, 2008|url=http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/Americas/2008/December/Agriprocessors-Wins-Funding-Despite-Debt-and-Controversy.html|accessdate=December 3, 2008|author=Isabel Cowles |accessdate=June 24, 2010[/tpl] The company was run by Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee Joseph E.
