Beaver Dam High School is a secondary school located in Beaver Dam, Arizona. The school serves grades nine through twelve.  It is part of the Littlefield Unified School District.

==History==

Virtually a landmark in LUSD, Beaver Dam High School was first brought to the table at a Governing Board Meeting in 2001. 
The school first opened its doors for the 2004-2005 school year. The Governing Board members at the time were Tammy Giebink, Cheryl Graham and Shannon Hartley. The Superintendent was Dr. Jose L. Trujillo. 
The first year the school housed only grades nine through eleven; the seniors attended high school at Virgin Valley High School in Mesquite, Nevada. The following school year, 2005â€“2006, the school was housing all four grades, 9-12.

==Achievement==

The school's first ever graduation ceremony was held on May 31, 2006 in the gymnasium. It was a blast from the past reunion, of sorts, with Littlefield alumni and past and present teachers, staff and former board members in attendance that night.
