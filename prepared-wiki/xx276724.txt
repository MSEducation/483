On November 17, Occupy Los Angeles joined with a permitted organized labor march through downtown Los Angeles. The parade was generally orderly, though a circle of about twenty protesters surrounded three tents in the middle of a street in deliberate disobedient behavior and were arrested. Later in the day, an unpermitted march went to a plaza at the base of the Bank of America tower, when police brought the march to a halt. More protesters were arrested for trespassing, 73 total for the day.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Police-clashes-mar-Occupy-Wall-Street-protests-2275644.php | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first1=Amy | last1=Westfeldt | first2=Colleen | last2=Long | title=Police clashes mar Occupy Wall Street protests | date=November 20, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/18/us-usa-protests-losangeles-idUSTRE7AG2DF20111118 | work=Reuters | title=Anti-Wall Street protesters arrested at L.A. bank | date=November 18, 2011[/tpl]

Some of these visitors were interviewed by InsightOut News, a grassroots journalism website that emerged from Occupy LA. These interviews were sometimes critical, raising the issue of whether wealthy celebrities could really be aligned with the working class.[tpl]cite news|last=Firecloud|first=Johnny|title=Insight Out News Covers Occupy LA|url=http://mediaroots.org/insight-out-news-covers-occupy-la.php|accessdate=27 March 2012|newspaper=Media Roots|date=18 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Paez|first=Margot|title=Tom Morello Interview|url=http://www.insightoutnews.org/2011/10/12/tom-morello-interview/|accessdate=29 March 2012|newspaper=InsightOut News|date=12 October 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Paez|first=Margot|title=Day 37: Bill Maher Interview|url=http://www.insightoutnews.org/2011/11/07/video-report-occupy-la-day-37-bill-maher/|accessdate=29 March 2012|newspaper=InsightOut News|date=7 November 2011[/tpl]

A total of 292 people were arrested.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57333495/200-arrested-as-cops-raid-occupy-la-camp/ | location=US | work=CBS News | title=200 arrested as cops raid Occupy LA camp[/tpl][tpl]cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/11/30/occupy-los-angeles-protesters-brace-for-eviction-as-police-deploy/ | location=US | work=Fox News | title=Few Protesters Remain After Police Make Over 200 Arrests at 'Occupy L.A.' | date=November 30, 2011[/tpl]

====Report of Patrick Meighan====

Patrick Meighan, writer for the Fox animated sitcom Family Guy, was one of the 292 arrests made on November 29. He posted an account[tpl]citation|url=http://myoccupylaarrest.blogspot.com/2011/12/my-occupy-la-arrest-by-patrick-meighan.html | location=Los Angeles | work=Patrick Meighan | title=My Occupy LA Arrest[/tpl] of his arrest. He also participated in an eight-part YouTube interview chronicling, in more detail, his experience the night of the raid.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA93310CC11CA4F21 | location=Los Angeles | work=Patrick Meighan | title=Patrick Meighan Occupy LA Raid Interview[/tpl]
Patrick Meighan's account alleges police destruction of personal property, use of excessive force, and use of force to produce reactions that then were cited as resistance for justification of further use of force. Police destroyed tents providing shelter or medical service, which news outlets reported as garbage left behind by protesters. The officer who arrested Meighan had forced him into a painful wrist lock; when Meighan recoiled, he was thrown to the ground on his face, and then had his face ground into the pavement until he bled. In Meighan's report, he also alleges that police set high bail and then refused to accept payment of the bail or allow access to legal counsel. In his interview, he mentions a unique Los Angeles law that allegedly allows jailers to refuse bail, or refuse to process bail, at their own discretion.

==May Day==

On May 1, 2012, Occupy Los Angeles resurfaced publicly joining general May Day protests all around Los Angeles.
