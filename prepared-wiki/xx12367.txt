</ref>  The Society of Alumni was founded during the "Amherst crisis" in 1821, when Williams College President [[Zephaniah Swift Moore]] left Williams.  Graduates of Williams formed the Society to ensure that Williams would not have to close, and raised enough money to ensure the future survival of the school.

==Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford==

Williams has a close relationship with Exeter College, one of the oldest constituent colleges of Oxford University. In the early 1980s, Williams purchased a group of houses, today known as the Ephraim Williams House, on Banbury Road and Lathbury Road, in North Oxford.[tpl]cite web |title=Williams at Exeter Programme in Oxford |url=http://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/college/williams |publisher=Exeter College, Oxford |accessdate=September 11, 2009[/tpl]
The Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford (WEPO) was founded in 1985. Every year (except 2010-2011, when 24 students attended), 26 undergraduate students from Williams spend their junior year at Exeter as full members of the college.http://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/college/williams
