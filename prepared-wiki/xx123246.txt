==Background==

Written by singer/guitarist Paul Stanley and professional songwriter Desmond Child, "Reason to Live" is a power ballad, heavy on keyboards and production. The B-side is the Gene Simmons-helmed album track "Thief in the Night".
A video was made to help promote the single. It featured clips of the band playing the song live on a large, well-lit stage, interspersed with shots of a young blonde woman. Portrayed by Playboy playmate Eloise Broady, the model is visibly distressed over relationship troubles with Stanley. She vents her frustrations by throwing a wine bottle at a picture of the two of them, and sets Stanley's car on fire after dousing it with gasoline. The video received airplay on MTV, and was directed by Marty Callner and produced by Callner, Doug Major and Bill Brigode.KISS Video Information
