CATEGORIES: Harness racing in Australia, Inter Dominion winners, Standardbred racehorses

Mr Feelgood is a high-class Standardbred racehorse. He is the only pacer in recent years to win major races in both North America and Australia.
Foaled in the United States, his achievements in North America included the 2006 Little Brown Jug and the 2008 Graduate FFA.
He was sold to Australian owners Kevin and Kay Seymour & Peter and Zilla O'Shea in 2008, and placed in the stable of New Zealand trainer Tim Butt. 
In 2009 Mr Feelgood won the A G Hunter Cup and Inter Dominion Pacing Championship, which led to him being crowned Australian Harness Horse of the Year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.harnesslink.com/www/Article.cgi?ID=75621 |title=Mr Feelgood Australian Horse of the Year|date=24 September 2009 |accessdate=2 February 2011|publisher=HarnessLink[/tpl] After a lacklustre return by his lofty standards he moved to the stable of Luke McCarthy in Queensland following the 2010 Inter Dominion series.
He gained more Group One wins in 2010 through the Queensland Pacing Championship in track record time and the 2010 Victoria Cup when sitting in the death seat throughout.
In October 2011 he surpassed $3Million dollars in prize money when he went back to back in the 2011 edition of the Queensland Pacing Championship.
In May 2012, Mr Feelgood retired after a disappointing inter dominion campaign.
