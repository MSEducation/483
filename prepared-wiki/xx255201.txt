[[Peugeot SR1]]

CATEGORIES: Peugeot vehicles

The Peugeot SR1 is a convertible, hybrid concept car by Peugeot. It was unveiled to the general public at the Geneva Motor Show, in March 2010.

==Features==

The SR1 concept  incorporates HYbrid4 technology, which will be launched in the Peugeot 3008 in 2011. In the SR1, at the front, a 1.6 litre THP petrol engine with a power of [tpl]Convert|160|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl], is combined with a rear electric motor developing [tpl]Convert|70|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. In electric only mode, the car becomes a ZEV (Zero Emission Vehicle), while its combined cycle fuel consumption is only [tpl]convert|4.9|L/100 km[/tpl] and 119 g/km of CO2.
When the two power trains operate simultaneously, the SR1 develops a potential maximum power of [tpl]Convert|230|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on[/tpl] and also benefits from 4-wheel drive.
Because the SR1 concept was presented together with the new Peugeot brand identity - and its well-known lion - designers all over the world have seemingly been very eager to capture the new design directions chosen by the French giant, in an attempt to understand where the brand would position itself in terms of design, in the near future.
