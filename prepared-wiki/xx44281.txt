Suicide is an American electronic protopunk musical duo, intermittently active since 1970 and composed of vocalist Alan Vega and Martin Rev on synthesizers and drum machines. They are an early synthesizer/vocal musical duo.
Never widely popular amongst the general public, Suicide are highly influential: critic Wilson Neate argues that Suicide "would prove as influential as The Clash.  The synthpop, techno, and industrial dance sounds of the '80s and '90s, and now the new New Wave of electroclash, all gesture back to that foundational album."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/483 |title=Dusted Reviews: Suicide - American Supreme |publisher=Dustedmagazine.com |date=2002-11-24 |accessdate=2010-05-02[/tpl]
In a November 1970 flyer the band was the first ever to use the phrase "punk music" to advertise a concert.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-01-29/news/suicide-watch/1 |accessdate=2010-01-01 |last=Reynolds |first=Simon |date=January 29, 2002| title=The second gig took place at the Soho gallery OK Harris, where Vega also held his first show. "On the gig flyers, we announced it as a Punk Music Mass. We didn't invent the word—I probably got it from an article on the Stooges by Lester Bangs—but I think we were the first band to describe our music as punk."  |publisher=Village Voice[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.fromthearchives.org/av_mr/chronology.html |title=Suicide - Chronology |accessdate=2010-04-30 |publisher=From The Archives[/tpl]

==History==

Suicide took their name from the title of a Ghost Rider comic book titled Satan Suicide, a favorite of Alan Vega.Reynolds, 2006. p. 143 Rev's simple keyboard riffs, (initially played on a battered Farfisa organ combined with effects units, before changing to a synthesizer), were accompanied by primitive drum machines, providing a pulsing, minimalistic, electronic backdrop for Vega's murmuring and nervy vocals. They were the first band to use the term punk to describe themselves, which they had adopted from an article by Lester Bangs. Some of their earliest posters use the terms "punk music" and "punk music mass".
Suicide emerged alongside the early glam punk scene in New York, with a reputation for their confrontational live shows. Many of their early shows were at the Mercer Arts Center, alongside bands like the New York Dolls and Eric Emerson and the Magic Tramps. David Johansen once played harmonica with Suicide in an early show there. Vega and Rev both dressed like arty street thugs, and Vega was notorious for brandishing a length of motorcycle drive chain onstage. Vega once stated "We started getting booed as soon as we came onstage. Just from the way we looked they started giving us hell already."

After the collapse of the Mercer Arts Center in 1973, Suicide played at Max's Kansas City and CBGB, often sharing the bill with emerging punk bands. Their first album was reissued with bonus material, including "23 Minutes Over Brussels", a recording of a Suicide concert that deteriorated into a riot.
Their first album, Suicide (1977), is regarded a classic. One critic writes: "'Che", "Ghost Rider"—these eerie, sturdy, proto-punk anthems rank among the most visionary, melodic experiments the rock realm has yet produced." Of note is the ten-minute "Frankie Teardrop", which tells the story of a poverty-stricken young factory worker, pushed to the edge. Critic Emerson Dameron writes that the song is "one of the most terrifying, riveting, absurd things I’ve ever heard."[tpl]cite web |url=http://dustedmagazine.com/features/543 |title=Ghost Songs - Our Favorite Halloween Tunes |accessdate=2010-01-01 |last=Dameron |first=Emerson |work=Dusted Magazine[/tpl] Nick Hornby in his book 31 Songs described "Frankie Teardrop" as something you would listen to "Only once".[tpl]cite book|title=31 Songs|author=Nick Hornby|publisher=McSweeney's[/tpl]
Suicide's albums of the late 1970s and early 1980s are regarded as some of the most influential recordings of their time and helped shape the direction of indie rock, industrial music and dance music. Among others, Steve Albini (Shellac, Rapeman, Big Black), Panthére, Gang Gang Dance, The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Sisters of Mercy, She Wants Revenge, Henry Rollins, Joy Division/New Order, Soft Cell, Nick Cave, D.A.F., Erasure, The KLF,[tpl]cite book|title=Suicide: No Compromise|year=2004|publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd|isbn=9780946719716|page=188|author=David Nobahkt[/tpl] Ministry, Nine Inch Nails,[tpl]cite book|title=Suicide: No Compromise|year=2004|publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd|isbn=9780946719716|page=166|author=David Nobahkt|quote=By the end of the eighties, Suicide's influence could be heard in the output of the industrial dance/ rock/noise bands that emerged during that era.

Suicide's influence on their sound is indisputable. Martin L Gore of Depeche Mode told The Times newspaper, "The synthesizer before Suicide was always a clean-cut instrument, whereas they brought in a punk element." He went on to say, "That was a very important step in the history of electronic music, they were way before The Prodigy and the whole industrial scene." Alan Wilder, Depeche Mode's music director and keyboard player from '82 to '95, had taken notice of Suicide's sampled and manipulated guitar sounds whilst recording the 1990 album Violator. Wilder later commented on his Shunt Website. "When we recorded the track "Blue Dress" it was based around using washy sounding, drone guitars (a la Suicide) which formed the backbone of the track."[/tpl] Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys, Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, R.E.M., Devo, Ultravox, Massive Attack,[tpl]cite web|title=A Big, Booming Show With Space for Reflection: ‘Massive Attack V Adam Curtis,’ a Film and a Concert|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/arts/music/massive-attack-v-adam-curtis-a-film-and-a-concert.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=25 April 2014|author=Ben Ratliff|date=September 29, 2013|quote=During all of this, Massive Attack — along with the guest singers Horace Andy and Liz Fraser — acts as a kind of house-band mood setter.

Furthermore, Springsteen also used a solo keyboard version of "Dream Baby Dream" to close the concerts on his 2005 Devils & Dust Tour, and released a studio version of his cover on his 2014 album High Hopes.
In 1986, Alan Vega collaborated with Andrew Eldritch of The Sisters of Mercy on the 'Gift' album, released under the name of 'The Sisterhood'. Vega and Rev have both released solo albums, and Suicide released their first album in over a decade with 2002's American Supreme. Sales, however, were slow and critical reception was mixed.
In 2005, SAF Publishing put out Suicide No Compromise, a "docu-biography" by David Nobahkt, which featured extensive interviews with Vega and Rev as well as many of their contemporaries and famous fans.
In 2008, Blast First Petite released a monthly, limited edition series of 10" Vinyl EP's and downloads by major artists, honoring Alan Vega's 60th birthday. Among those paying tribute were Bruce Springsteen, Primal Scream, Peaches, Grinderman, Spiritualized, The Horrors, +Pansonic, Julian Cope, Lydia Lunch, Vincent Gallo, LIARS, & The Klaxons. The label also released "Suicide: 1977–1978", a 6 CD box-set, the same year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://mvremix.com/rock_blogs/2008/06/24/alan-vega-turns-70-years-old-suicide-box-set-and-single-series-set-for-release-major-artists-pay-tribute-to-suicidevega-in-year-long-monthly-series-of-limited-edition-of-10-vinyl-eps-and-dow/|title=Alan Vega Turns 70- Years Old/Box Set |author=Paul Smith |year=2008 |publisher=MV Remix Rock |accessdate=1 May 2010[/tpl]
