==Personal==

Shaffer was married three times and had two children. His third wife was the Australian actress Diane Cilento, whom he met in 1973 when she appeared in The Wicker Man. He moved to Queensland when he married Cilento, and became legally domiciled in Australia although he maintained a flat in Chelsea and spent most of his time there. This became an issue after his death, when his mistress Marie-Josette ("Jo") Capece Minutolo made a claim on his estate in the British High Court, arguing he had intended to divorce Cilento and marry her, and that he had given her an engagement ring.  The British judge found that as Shaffer was not legally domiciled in the United Kingdom at the time of his death, Minutolo had no claim on his estate. [tpl]cn|date=November 2013[/tpl]
