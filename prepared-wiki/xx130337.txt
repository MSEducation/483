Old Hill Tennis Club is an amateur tennis club in Cradley Heath, Birmingham, England.
It neighbours Old Hill Cricket Club, and the two clubs, while both being run entirely separately by individual committees, share a close relationship with each other, and are in a trust. The official name of the club is Old Hill Cricket and Tennis Club (Tennis Section).
Founded in 1932, the club has entered a men's and a women's team into the Birmingham League, with mixed success.
As the club is on the boundary of Hereford & Worcester, and Staffordshire, the club enters a men's and ladies' team into both leagues every year.
In 2013, the men's team competed in Division 7 East in the Hereford & Worcester league[tpl]cite web|title=Herefordshire & Worcestershire Slazenger Mens Summer League 2013|url=http://lta.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/draw.aspx?id=B5442921-9969-44FB-B49E-244D5FEF08F2&draw=9|publisher=LTA|accessdate=22 July 2013[/tpl] and Division 4 South in the Staffordshire league.[tpl]cite web|title=Old Hill Tables|url=http://www.staffstennisleague.co.uk/html/tablesdetail.asp?clubid=22&nm=Old%20Hill|publisher=The Staffordshire Inter-Club Tennis League|accessdate=22 July 2013[/tpl] The ladies team competed in Division 3 in the Hereford & Worcester league[tpl]cite web|title=Herefordshire & Worcestershire Ladies Summer League 2013|url=http://lta.tournamentsoftware.com/sport/clubstandings.aspx?id=F06935B9-64CC-4ED0-8925-E480241F6E77&cid=23|publisher=LTA|accessdate=22 July 2013[/tpl] and Division 4 South in the Staffordshire league.
