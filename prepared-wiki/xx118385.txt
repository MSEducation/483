Alex has taught at the Academy of Art and at the San Francisco State Multimedia Studies Programs. He writes for 3D Magazine, 3D World and Post.[tpl]disambiguation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl] Alex was a regular guest on the US cable channel TechTV, and has appeared as a guest on G4techTV Canada's television show The Lab with Leo Laporte.
Alex participates in Macbreak Weekly, a weekly talk show/podcast on the TWiT network. A running joke in the show is that Alex tends to recommend to listeners products with exorbitant price tags, on average US $700, the price of Adobe Photoshop. The panel has therefore created a unit of currency, the “Alex”.[tpl]cite web|title=TWiT TV Hosts|url=http://twit.tv/people/alex-lindsay|accessdate=16 May 2012[/tpl] Other guests on the show will refer to the cost of their picks in relation to an "Alex" or fractions thereof. If the pick is a free tool or download it will cost "zero Alexes”. If it cost $1400, it is "2 Alexes".[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Lindsay is an occasional co-host on This Week in Photography (TWiP) along with Frederick V. Johnson, which revolves around photography news, interviews, and tips.
Through 2011 Lindsay also hosted and produced This Week in Media, a weekly podcast produced by Pixel Corps. Lindsay also produced MacBreak, a video podcast shot in 1080p.
