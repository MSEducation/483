==Football career==

After starting professionally with local Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense, Fernando joined Associação Atlética Francana in 2000, moving after one season to another modest side, Vila Nova Futebol Clube. In 2002 he signed for Coritiba Foot Ball Club, spending four seasons at the club. 
Subsequently, Fernando moved abroad and joined Portugal's U.D. Leiria, as compatriot Helton left the team to join Portuguese first division powerhouse F.C. Porto. He made his league debut on 11 September 2005 in a 0–0 home draw against C.S. Marítimo, and retained first-choice status from that moment onwards.
In the 2006–07 season, Fernando only missed two league games as Leiria finished seventh and qualified for the UEFA Intertoto Cup, eventually being one of the competition's winners and appearing in the UEFA Cup, being ousted by Bayer 04 Leverkusen in the first round (4–5 on aggregate). The following campaign, the club dropped down to the second level.
After appearing in 14 matches to help União return to the top flight in 2009, 31-year-old Fernando returned to his country and signed for Club de Regatas Vasco da Gama, playing in the second division for the first time in 110 years of history. As first-choice he helped the Rio de Janeiro side finish as champions and promote back, with the best defensive record in the league.
On 10 December 2012 Prass left Vasco and joined Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras, freshly relegated to division two.Palmeiras anuncia a contratação do goleiro Fernando Prass, ex-Vasco (Palmeiras announces signing of goalkeeper Fernando Prass, formerly with Vasco); Gazeta Esportiva, 11 December 2012 [tpl]pt icon[/tpl]
