From Apology to Utopia; The Structure of International Legal Argument (first published 1989) presents a critical view of international law as an argumentative practice that attempts to remove the political from international relations. It asserts that international law is vulnerable to criticisms of being either an irrelevant moralist utopia or an apology to Realpolitik.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] 
The Gentle Civilizer of Nations: The Rise and Fall of International Law 1870-1960 (2001) has two agendas[tpl]clarify|date=October 2010[/tpl], first of which is to develop an intellectual history of international law, and to offer a critique of that history. The second is to offer a sociology of the profession of international law, using biographical studies of Hersch Lauterpacht, Carl Schmitt and Hans Morgenthau.
