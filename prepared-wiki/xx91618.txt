"Tear down this wall!" was the challenge issued by United States President Ronald Reagan to Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev to destroy the Berlin Wall, in a speech at the Brandenburg Gate near the Berlin Wall on June 12, 1987, commemorating the 750th anniversary of Berlin.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-06-12-reagan-speech_N.htm |title=Reagan's 'tear down this wall' speech turns 20 - USATODAY.com |accessdate=2008-02-19 |work=USA Today | date=June 12, 2007[/tpl]  Reagan challenged Gorbachev, who was then the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to tear it down as an emblem of Gorbachev's desire to increase freedom in the Eastern Bloc through glasnost ("transparency") and perestroika ("restructuring").

==Background==

Built in 1961, the Berlin Wall became known as a symbol of communist oppression.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/views/y/1999/11/burns.wall.nov8|title=What the Berlin Wall still stands for|date=November 8, 1999 |accessdate=2008-02-18|work=CNN Interactive[/tpl]  In the 1963 "Ich bin ein Berliner" speech, U.S. President John F. Kennedy stated the support of the United States for democratic West Germany shortly after the Soviet-supported Communist state of East Germany erected the Berlin Wall as a barrier to prevent movement from East to West.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ap.grolier.com/article?assetid=atb023b11&templatename=/article/article.html|title=John Fitzgerald Kennedy|year=2006|accessdate=2008-02-16|publisher=Scholastic Library Publishing, Inc.[/tpl]
President Reagan's 1987 visit was his second within five years.  It came at a time of heightened East-West tensions, caused in particular by the debate over the stationing of short range American missiles in Europe and the United States' record peacetime defense buildup.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wam.umd.edu/~jklumpp/comm461/cold.html|title=The Cold War|accessdate=2008-02-08|publisher=Workstations at Maryland[/tpl] Reagan was scheduled to attend the 1987 G-7 summit meeting in Venice, Italy, and later made a brief stop in Berlin.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/opinion/10mann.html?pagewanted=print|title=Tear Down That Myth|date=June 10, 2007|accessdate=2008-02-09|work=The New York Times|author=Mann, James[/tpl]
The Brandenburg Gate site was chosen to highlight the President's conviction that Western democracy offered the best hope to open the Berlin Wall.[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DC1F30F930A25755C0A961948260|title=Raze Berlin Wall, Reagan Urges Soviet|author=Boyd, Gerald M|date=June 13, 1987|accessdate=2008-02-09|work=The New York Times[/tpl] His speech focused on a series of political initiatives to achieve this end. The famous "tear down this wall" phrase was intended as the logical conclusion of the President's proposals.  As the speech was being drafted, inclusion of the words became a source of considerable controversy within the Reagan administration. Several senior staffers and aides advised against the phrase, saying anything that might cause further East-West tensions or potential embarrassment to Gorbachev, with whom President Reagan had built a good relationship, should be omitted. American officials in West Germany and presidential speechwriters, including Peter Robinson, thought otherwise. Robinson traveled to West Germany to inspect potential speech venues, and gained an overall sense that the majority of West Berliners opposed the wall. Despite getting little support for suggesting Reagan demand the wall's removal, Robinson kept the phrase in the speech text. On May 18, 1987, President Reagan met with his speechwriters and responded to the speech by saying, "I thought it was a good, solid draft." White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker objected, saying it sounded "extreme" and "unpresidential," and Deputy US National Security Advisor Colin Powell agreed. Nevertheless, Reagan liked the passage, saying, "I think we'll leave it in."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070610/18speeches.htm|last=Walsh|first=Kenneth T|date=June 2007|title=Seizing the Moment|work=U.S. News & World Report|pages=39–41|accessdate=2007-06-27[/tpl]
Chief speechwriter Anthony R. Dolan gives another account of the line's origins, however, attributing it directly to Reagan.  In an article published in the Wall Street Journal in November 2009, Dolan gives a detailed account of how in an Oval Office meeting that was prior to Robinson's draft Reagan came up with the line on his own.  He records vivid impressions of his own reaction and Robinson's at the time.[tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704795604574522163362062796.html|last=Dolan|first=Anthony|date=November 2009|title=Four Little Words|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2012-06-10[/tpl] This led to a friendly exchange of letters between Robinson and Dolan over their differing accounts, which the Wall Street Journal published.[tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704402404574527764020693266.html|last=Robinson|first=Peter|date=November 2009|title=Looking Again at Reagan and 'Tear Down This Wall'|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2012-06-10[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704431804574538002351222272.html|last=Dolan|first=Anthony|date=November 2009|title=Speechwriters' Shouts of Joy in Reagan's Oval Office|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2012-06-10[/tpl]

==The speech==

Arriving in Berlin on June 12, 1987, President and Mrs. Reagan were taken to the Reichstag, where they viewed the wall from a balcony.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.germany.info/relaunch/politics/new/pol_Reagan_Berlin_Anniv_2007.htm|title=Ronald Reagan's Famous "Tear Down This Wall" Speech Turns 20|accessdate=February 9, 2008|publisher=German Embassy, Washington, DC[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl] Reagan then made his speech at the Brandenburg Gate at 2:00 pm, in front of two panes of bulletproof glass protecting him from potential snipers in East Berlin. About 45,000 people were in attendance; among the spectators were West German president Richard von Weizsäcker, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and West Berlin mayor Eberhard Diepgen. That afternoon, Reagan said,
Later on in his speech, President Reagan said, "As I looked out a moment ago from the Reichstag, that embodiment of German unity, I noticed words crudely spray-painted upon the wall, perhaps by a young Berliner, 'This wall will fall. Beliefs become reality.' Yes, across Europe, this wall will fall. For it cannot withstand faith; it cannot withstand truth. The wall cannot withstand freedom."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1987/061287d.htm|title=Remarks on East-West Relations at the Brandenburg Gate in West Berlin|accessdate=May 29, 2011|publisher=Ronald Reagan Presidential Library [/tpl]
Another highlight of the speech was Reagan's call to end the arms race with his reference to the Soviets' SS-20 nuclear weapons, and the possibility "not merely of limiting the growth of arms, but of eliminating, for the first time, an entire class of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth."

==Response and legacy==

Although it has been called "The four most famous words of Ronald Reagan's Presidency", the speech received "relatively little coverage from the media", Time magazine reported 20 years later.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1631828,00.html |title=20 Years After "Tear Down This Wall" - TIME |accessdate=2008-02-19 |work=Time | date=June 11, 2007 | first=Romesh | last=Ratnesar[/tpl] Communists were critical of the speech, and the Soviet press agency Tass accused Reagan of giving an "openly provocative, war-mongering speech."
Twenty-nine months later, on November 9, 1989, after increasing public unrest, East Germany finally opened the Berlin Wall. By the end of the year, official operations to dismantle the wall began. With the collapse of the Communist governments of Eastern Europe and, eventually, the Soviet Union itself, the tearing down of the wall epitomized the collapse for history. In September 1990, Reagan, no longer President, returned to Berlin, where he personally took a few symbolic hammer swings at a remnant of the Berlin Wall.[tpl]cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DA163CF935A2575AC0A966958260&|title=Reagan Hailed for Taking the Evil Out of the Empire |work=The New York Times|date=September 16, 1990 |accessdate=2008-02-10 |author=Douglas, Carlyle C[/tpl]
Former West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he would never forget standing near Reagan when he challenged Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. "He was a stroke of luck for the world, especially for Europe."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2004-06-07-reagan-world_x.htm|title=Reagan remembered worldwide for his role in ending Cold War division|work=USA Today |date=June 7, 2004 |author=Jason Keyser[/tpl] However, even though the speech is considered one of Reagan’s most memorable and influential speeches, there is much dispute about how much influence and impact his words have had on the German people. Because the media did not focus on the speech during the time due to the unknown impact the tearing down of the wall would bring, most Americans did not know about the speech’s important phrase.[tpl]cite news|last=Ratnesar|first=Romesh|title=20 Years After "Tear Down This Wall"|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1631828,00.html|publisher=TIME|accessdate=3 October 2013|date=June 11, 2007[/tpl] In an interview with Reagan himself, he recalls the East German police not allowing people to get near the wall, which prevented the citizens from experiencing the speech at all. In addition, despite his famous lines that challenges Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall, there is little evidence that Reagan’s speech has had any impact on even the decision behind tearing down the wall let alone the people he addresses. But even though there is considerable disagreement over how much influence Reagan's words had on the destruction of the wall, the speech is remembered as an important moment in Cold War history.
Peter Robinson, the White House wordsmith who drafted the address, said its most famous line was inspired by a conversation with Ingeborg Elz of West Berlin who had remarked in a conversation with him, "If this man Gorbachev is serious with his talk of Glasnost and perestroika he can prove it by getting rid of this wall."[tpl]cite web|publisher = Wall Street Journal|first = Peter|last = Robinson|authorlink = Peter Robinson (speechwriter)|date = June 9–10, 2012 |url=http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2007/summer/berlin.html|first = Peter|last = Robinson|authorlink = Peter Robinson (speechwriter)|publisher = National Archives|date = Summer 2007|volume = 39|title = "Tear Down This Wall": How Top Advisers Opposed Reagan's Challenge to Gorbachev—But Lost[/tpl] At the end of the day, though we remember the words “tear down this wall” as the speech’s most influential element, the message and goal of the speech is what formulated Reagan’s greatest legacy as a true influencer and communicator. Instead of intimidating Gorbachev like most other leaders would have done to tear down the Berlin Wall, Reagan peacefully tests Gorbachev’s intentions and compliments him on his goals for Perestroika and Glasnost during his speech. With his peaceful delivery of the speech, Reagan earns Gorbachev's trust and hopefully gains his inspiration to decide on the Berlin Wall’s fate.
