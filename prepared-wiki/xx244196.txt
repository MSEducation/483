[[H1FOO]]

Histone H1oo is a protein that in humans is encoded by the H1FOO gene.[tpl]cite journal | author = Marzluff WF, Gongidi P, Woods KR, Jin J, Maltais LJ | title = The human and mouse replication-dependent histone genes | journal = Genomics | volume = 80 | issue = 5 | pages = 487–98 |date=November 2002 | pmid = 12408966 | doi = 10.1016/S0888-7543(02)96850-3| url =  [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Entrez Gene: H1 histone family| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=132243| accessdate = [/tpl]

==Function==

Histones are basic nuclear proteins that are responsible for the nucleosome structure of the chromosomal fiber in eukaryotes. Nucleosomes consist of approximately 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer composed of pairs of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The chromatin fiber is further compacted through the interaction of a linker histone, H1, with the DNA between the nucleosomes to form higher order chromatin structures. The protein encoded is a member of the histone H1 family. This gene contains introns, unlike most histone genes. The protein encoded is a member of the histone H1 family. The related mouse gene is expressed only in oocytes. 
It incorporates into sperm chromatin after fertilisation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Mizusawa Y, Kuji N, Tanaka Y, et al. |title=Expression of human oocyte-specific linker histone protein and its incorporation into sperm chromatin during fertilization |journal=Fertil Steril |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=1134–1141 |date=March 2010 |pmid=19147139 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.11.028 |url=[/tpl]
