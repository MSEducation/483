Working in partnership with Alexander McGillivray, Panton, Leslie, & Company were able to expand their operations from East Florida and the Bahamas to the Mississippi River. Panton had promised McGillivray a one-fifth share of the company's profits once it obtained Spanish approval."Continuity in Commerce: Development of the Panton, Leslie and Company Trade Monopoly in West Florida" Thomas D.

===Exploitation of Native Americans and use of African slaves===

After its archenemy, the adventurer and self-styled "Director General of the Muskogee Nation", William Augustus Bowles, had been sent to Morro prison at Havana in 1783, Panton, Leslie & Company emerged as a multinational power broker acting in league with the plantation masters of the lower South. For almost twenty years deerskins acquired from the Creeks and Seminoles had been shipped in the company's vessels to its massive warehouse in Nassau, where they were stored with other trade goods purchased from markets in the southeast for redistribution to the mainland markets. Some bulk goods were sold to Bahamian merchants for retailing locally and in the outer islands; this Bahamian trade was managed by John Forbes.[tpl]cite book|author=Keith Tinker|title=The Bahamas in American History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0dBPAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT53|date=30 November 2011|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=978-1-4653-1084-2|page=53[/tpl] The company also was part owner of the salt works on Providence Island, the product of which was sent to Pensacola where it was vended to the Indians for high profits.[tpl]cite book|author=Justin Winsor|title=The Westward Movement: The Colonies and the Republic West of the Alleghanies, 1763-1798.

The company controlled the East Florida trade with a dozen posts, including five on both banks of the St. Johns River. In West Florida, the Pensacola store alone took in 250,000 hides in a peak year. Panton's salt works dried fish and tanned hides; Leslie's lumbermen on the St. Johns cut timber for sale in the West Indies where wood was scarce, and his drovers herded cattle to be slaughtered for salt beef.  At such trading stores as Almacén Nuestra Señora de la Concepción on the river's west bank, slaves tended  the company's corn and vegetable crops fields, herded cattle, and tanned deerskins from the Indian towns. Other slaves processed the hides for export at the warehouse in St. Augustine.[tpl]cite book|author=Jane Landers|title=Black Society in Spanish Florida|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6KByoQgXZEcC&pg=PA171|date=1 January 1999|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-06753-2|page=171[/tpl]
The travel writer John Pope, who visited the region in 1790 on his tour of the southern and western territories of the United States, inquired into the accounting of profits generated by the Indian trade, and concluded that William Panton generally sold his goods at 500 percent of prime cost. From its earliest days the trade had yielded high returns: the apparently enormous profits were a matter of concern to some government officials and the leaders of the Creeks. Yet this business did involve risk and substantial legitimate expenses.[tpl]cite book|author=Kathryn E.

As in Louisiana, the Spanish government took advantage of the system already in place and adapted this to its own purposes. Panton, Leslie & Company, under very liberal terms from the Spanish point of view, held their monopoly as long as the Spanish controlled Florida; their influence with the Indians was essential to Spanish policy in its relations with the various tribes, and an important means of maintaining Spanish interests in the region before the surrender of the whole country to the United States.[tpl]cite book|title=Proceedings of the Mississippi Valley Historical Association|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NIMTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA100|year=1915|publisher=Torch Press|pages=100–[/tpl]
Over the years, the Chickasaws, the Choctaws, and the Creeks had incurred enormous debts to Panton, Leslie & Company; they eventually ceded millions of acres of land to the United States, using the proceeds to pay off those debts. This resulted in the United States acquiring millions of acres of land within the current boundaries of Alabama and Mississippi.[tpl]cite web|title=Panton, Leslie & Company|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-3049|publisher=Encyclopedia of Alabama|accessdate=23 December 2013|author=Herbert J.

Among the most active firms and merchants participating in the slave trade of East and West Florida were Panton, Leslie & Company, Arredondo and Son, Zephaniah Kingsley, and John Fraser. Individually and jointly they imported at least ten groups of captive Africans, totaling 1,260 people, to Florida between 1802 and 1811.[tpl]cite book|author=James A.
