==Reception==

Scott Yanow of Allmusic states, "Tenor saxophonist Stan Getz and trumpeter Chet Baker never particularly liked each other and, even though they had musically compatible styles, they only worked together briefly in three periods. Their mutual hostility can be felt in subtle ways on this session... even with some good moments, does not live up to its potential".Yanow, S. Allmusic Review accessed August 13, 2013
