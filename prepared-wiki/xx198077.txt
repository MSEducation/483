The Co-operative Retail Trading Group (or CRTG) is the central buying group for co-operative retail societies in the United Kingdom. It was established in 1993, and says that it supplies 100% of food bought for sale by co-operatives in the UK, after being joined by the last two independent societies in 2002.

Until 1998, it faced competition within the retail co-operative movement from another grocery buying group, the Consortium of Independent Co-operatives (CIC) which was led by Co-operative Retail Services.  Several of the larger regional co-operatives of the time were members of CIC: Portsea, Scotmid, United, and Yorkshire.  In 1998, the CIC supplied £1 billion of goods annually, and the CRTG £2.5 billion.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/collapse-of-buying-group-adds-to-pressure-for-coop-merger-1198691.html|title=Collapse of buying group adds to pressure for Co-op merger|author=Nigel Cope|work=The Independent|date=17 Sep 1998|accessdate=4 Dec 2009[/tpl]
