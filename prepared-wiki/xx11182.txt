Sun Microsystems, Inc. was a company that sold :computers, computer components, :computer software, and :information technology services and that created the Java programming language, and the Network File System (NFS). Sun significantly evolved several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC Processors, Thin Client Computing, and virtualized computing. Sun was founded on February 24, 1982.[tpl]cite news |title = Churchill Club Presents: Scott McNealy in Conversation With Ed Zander |publisher = Market Wire |work= news release |url = http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/17/idUS228366+17-Feb-2011+MW20110217 |date= February 17, 2011 |accessdate= June 14, 2011[/tpl] At its height, Sun headquarters were in Santa Clara, California (part of Silicon Valley), on the former west campus of the Agnews Developmental Center.
On January 27, 2010, Sun was acquired by Oracle Corporation for US $7.4Â billion, based on an agreement signed on April 20, 2009.[tpl]cite web |author=Stephen Shankland |publisher=CNET News | title= Oracle buys Sun, becomes hardware company |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20000019-264.html |date= January 27, 2010 | accessdate=June 14, 2011 [/tpl] The following month, Sun Microsystems, Inc. was merged with Oracle USA, Inc. to become Oracle America, Inc.[tpl]cite news |title=Oracle has been renamed "Oracle America, Inc." |url=http://pcatt.net/NewsEvents/tabid/76/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/28/Oracle-has-been-renamed-Oracle-America-Inc.aspx |publisher=Oracle Corporation |date= February 15, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2011[/tpl]
Sun products included computer servers and workstations built on its own RISC-based SPARC processor architecture as well as on x86 based AMD's Opteron and Intel's Xeon processors; storage systems; and a suite of software products including the Solaris operating system, developer tools, Web infrastructure software, and identity management applications. Other technologies include the Java platform, MySQL, and NFS.
Sun was a proponent of open systems in general and Unix in particular, and a major contributor to open source software. Sun's main manufacturing facilities were located in Hillsboro, Oregon and Linlithgow, Scotland.

==History==

The initial design for what became Sun's first Unix workstation, the Sun-1, was conceived by Andy Bechtolsheim when he was a graduate student at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. Bechtolsheim originally designed the SUN workstation for the Stanford University Network communications project as a personal CAD workstation. It was designed around the Motorola 68000 processor with an advanced memory management unit (MMU) to support the Unix operating system with virtual memory support.[tpl] cite web | url = ftp://reports.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/csl/tr/82/229/CSL-TR-82-229.pdf | title = The SUN Workstation Architecture | author=Andreas Bechtolsheim, Forest Baskett, Vaughan Pratt | work=Stanford University Computer systems Laboratory Technical Report No. 229 | date = March 1982 | accessdate =July 28, 2009[/tpl] He built the first ones from spare parts obtained from Stanford's Department of Computer Science and Silicon Valley supply houses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/wellspring/sun_spotlight.html |title=Wellspring of Innovation: Sun Microsystems Spotlight |publisher=Stanford.edu |accessdate=July 28, 2009[/tpl]
On February 24, 1982, Vinod Khosla, Andy Bechtolsheim, and Scott McNealy, all Stanford graduate students, founded Sun Microsystems. Bill Joy of Berkeley, a primary developer of the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), joined soon after and is counted as one of the original founders.[tpl]cite web |title= Vinod Khosla and Sun Microsystems |author=Amar Bhide |work=Case study |publisher=Harvard Business School |date= September 28, 1989 |url= http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b02/en/common/item_detail.jhtml?id=390049 |accessdate=June 11, 2011 [/tpl]
The Sun name is derived from the initials of the Stanford University Network.[tpl]cite book |title= Silicon Valley |last= Vance |first= Ashlee |year= 2007 |publisher= Globe Pequot Press |location= Goulford, CT, USA |isbn= 978-0-7627-4239-4 |page= 117 [/tpl][tpl]cite web | title = Mr. Scott McNealy | publisher=Sun Microsystems, Inc. | date = April 24, 2005 | url = http://www.sun.com/products-n-solutions/edu/gelc/bios/scottmcnealy.html | accessdate =September 17, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://blogs.sun.com/dador/entry/sunw_stanford_university_network_workstation |title=Jim McGuinness's Weblog |accessdate=February 22, 2009 |date=August 27, 2007 |author=Jim McGuinness[/tpl]  Sun was profitable from its first quarter in July 1982.
Sun's initial public offering was in 1986 under the stock symbol SUNW, for Sun Workstations (later Sun Worldwide). The symbol was changed in 2007 to JAVA; Sun stated that the brand awareness associated with its Java platform better represented the company's current strategy.[tpl]cite web|author=By Alexei Oreskovic |url=http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/newsanalysis/techhardware/10376053.html?cm_ven=YAHOO&cm_cat=FREE&cm_ite=NA |title=Sun to Switch Symbol to JAVA |publisher=Thestreet.com |date=August 23, 2007 |accessdate=July 28, 2009[/tpl]
Sun's logo, which features four interleaved copies of the word sun, was designed by professor Vaughan Pratt, also of Stanford. The initial version of the logo was orange and had the sides oriented horizontally and vertically, but it was subsequently redesigned so as to appear to stand on one corner and the color changed to purple.

===The "Bubble" and its aftermath===

In the dot-com bubble, Sun began making much more money, and its shares rose dramatically. It also began spending much more, hiring workers and building itself out. Some of this was because of genuine demand, but much was from web start-up companies anticipating business that would never happen. In 2000, the bubble burst.[tpl]cite web|url=http://quotes.nasdaq.com/quote.dll?page=charting&mode=basics&intraday=off&timeframe=10y&charttype=ohlc&splits=off&earnings=off&movingaverage=None&lowerstudy=volume&comparison=off&index=&drilldown=off&symbol=SUNW&selected=SUNW |title=NASDAQ |publisher=Quotes.nasdaq.com |accessdate=July 28, 2009[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=April 2010[/tpl]
Sales in Sun's important hardware division went into free-fall as customers closed shop and auctioned off high-end servers.
Several quarters of steep losses led to executive departures, rounds of layoffs,[tpl]cite web|title=Sun to lay off 1,000 |url=http://news.com.com/Sun+to+lay+off+1,000/2100-1022_3-5078493.html|accessdate=July 13, 2007|date=September 18, 2003 |publisher=CNet News.com|first=Stephen|last=Shankland|archiveurl=http://archive.is/4X2U|archivedate=July 11, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|accessdate=July 13, 2007|date= June 24, 2005 |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/24/sun_layoffs_2006/|title=Sun layoffs hit hundreds in US|first=Ashlee|last=Vance|publisher=The Register[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1009_22-6058894.html|date= April 7, 2006 |accessdate=July 13, 2007|title=Sun layoffs hit high-end server group|publisher=ZDNet|first=Stephen|last=Shankland| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070210194319/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1009_22-6058894.html| archivedate = February 10, 2007[/tpl] and other cost cutting. In December 2001, the stock fell to the 1998, pre-bubble level of about $100. But it kept falling, faster than many other tech companies. A year later it had dipped below $10 (a tenth of what it was even in 1990) but bounced back to $20. In mid-2004, Sun closed their Newark, California, factory and consolidated all manufacturing to Hillsboro, Oregon.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2004/01/12/daily49.html | date= January 16, 2004 |accessdate=July 14, 2007|title= Sun to add jobs in Hillsboro | publisher=Portland Business Journal[/tpl]

===Post-crash focus===

In 2004, Sun canceled two major processor projects which emphasized high instruction level parallelism and operating frequency. Instead, the company chose to concentrate on processors optimized for multi-threading and multiprocessing, such as the UltraSPARC T1 processor (codenamed "Niagara"). The company also announced a collaboration with Fujitsu to use the Japanese company's processor chips in mid-range and high-end Sun servers. These servers were announced on April 17, 2007 as the M-Series, part of the SPARC Enterprise series.
In February 2005, Sun announced the Sun Grid, a grid computing deployment on which it offered utility computing services priced at US$1 per CPU/hour for processing and per GB/month for storage. This offering built upon an existing 3,000-CPU server farm used for internal R&D for over 10 years, which Sun marketed as being able to achieve 97% utilization. In August 2005, the first commercial use of this grid was announced for financial risk simulations which was later launched as its first software as a service product.[tpl] cite web | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/08-24-2005/0004093251&EDATE= | date= August 24, 2005 | title = CDO2 Unlocks The Power of Sun Grid for Faster Financial Risk Simulation [/tpl]
In January 2005, Sun reported a net profit of $19Â million for fiscal 2005 second quarter, for the first time in three years. This was followed by net loss of $9Â million on GAAP basis for the third quarter 2005, as reported on April 14, 2005. In January 2007, Sun reported a net GAAP profit of $126Â million on revenue of $3.337Â billion for its fiscal second quarter. Shortly following that news, it was announced that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) would invest $700Â million in the company.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/01-23-2007/0004511496 | date= January 23, 2007 | title = Sun Microsystems Welcomes Endorsement and Investment From KKR [/tpl]
Sun had engineering groups in Bangalore, Beijing, Dublin, Grenoble, Hamburg, Prague, St. Petersburg, Tel Aviv, Tokyo, and Trondheim.[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/9/37846828.pdf |format=PDF| title = Offshoring Software Development presentation by Sun to the aECD[/tpl]
In 2007â2008, Sun posted revenue of $13.8Â billion and had $2Â billion in cash. First-quarter 2008 losses were $1.68Â billion; revenue fell 7% to $12.99Â billion. Sun's stock lost 80% of its value November 2007 to November 2008, reducing the company's market value to $3Â billion. With falling sales to large corporate clients, Sun announced plans to lay off 5,000 to 6,000 workers, or 15â18% of its work force. It expected to save $700Â million to $800Â million a year as a result of the moves, while also taking up to $600Â million in charges.Ashlee Vance,  "Crisis Hits Tech Sector With Layoffs as Sales Slump", New York Times, Nov. 14, 2008
