The source of the Ludza is Lake Lielais Ludzas near the town of Ludza, Latvia. The river flows east, turns north and a part of it forms the international border between Latvia and Russia. Further north, it turns northeast and departs to the Russian side, forming the border between Krasnogorosdky and Pytalovsky Districts of Pskov Oblast. In Russia, the Ludza is known as the Lzha. Even further north, the Lzha turns north and joins the Utroya close to the village of Khudyaki.
