==Early life and youth==

She was born Paula Michelle Furr, April 20, 1966, in Tupelo, Mississippi, to Myra Joanelle and Donald Paul Furr III. Her parents owned a thriving toy and craft store, and Paula and her brother Mark had a privileged life. However, Donald and Myra Furr's marriage began to fail when Paula was five years old. Paula's mother left Tupelo and took her to Memphis. Paula's father followed with an ultimatum for Myra to give Paula to him or he would commit suicide, and Myra refused. Later that night Donald Furr killed himself by running his car into a tree. Paula's mother experienced a drastic change in socioeconomic status because of her husband's death, throwing Paula, her brother and mother into poverty.

In 1984 while living in Maryland, she was introduced to the gospel and became a Christian. On her television show in July 2005, White recounted the vision she received from God shortly after conversion: "When I was just eighteen years old, the Lord gave me a vision that every time I opened my mouth and declared the Word of the Lord, there was a manifestation of his spirit where people were either healed, delivered, or saved. When I shut my mouth, they fell off into utter darkness and God spoke to me and said I called you to preach the gospel."
Paula White later on became a part of the National Church of God in Fort Washington under T.L. Lowery of Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee), and a small church in Gaithersburg-Damascus, Maryland area.

===Without Walls International Church===

Without Walls International Church, originally named South Tampa Christian Center, was founded in Tampa, Florida, by the then-couple Paula and Randy White in 1991.
The church struggled financially at first, and it could not afford to pay Randy and Paula White a salary for the first two years. As a result, Randy and Paula lived on government assistance and the kindness of others.  Soon the church began to grow quickly through the various outreach programs. From 1991 to 1998, the church changed locations three times until they secured the property located at 2511 North Grady Avenue in Tampa, and changed the name of the church to Without Walls International Church.
While the church was holding services in an outdoor tent in 1999, they reported 5,000 attendees a week and 10,000 ministered to outside of the church with 230 outreach ministries.[tpl]Cite web|author=John W.

Without Walls International Church then purchased the property next to them at 3860 West Columbus Drive expanding their Tampa campus. The property acquired was a Canada Dry warehouse which they remodeled and is now today the main sanctuary for the church.
In 2002, Without Walls International Church began to expand to its second location in Lakeland, Florida. At this time, the church reported 14,000 members and 200 ministries including job training, evangelism among public housing projects and a teen club.  Without Walls International Church also began to hold Saturday night services at Carpenter's Home Church in Lakeland renting the property.[tpl]Cite web|author=Cary McMullen|title=Without Walls Pastor Discusses Arrangement With Carenter's Church|publisher=The Ledger |date=2002-07-27 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jzYxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9f0DAAAAIBAJ&dq=paula-white&pg=3720%2C4243357|accessdate=2011-04-15[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|author=Cary McMullen|title=Local Church To Share Chapel|publisher=The Ledger |date=2002-07-17 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=B78wAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-v0DAAAAIBAJ&dq=paula-white&pg=5352%2C4667090|accessdate=2011-04-15[/tpl] Carpenter's Home Church would later on be purchased by Without Walls International Church in 2005 for $8 million renaming the church to Without Walls Central Church.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20101210/NEWS/101219966 |title=Former Without Walls pastor starts foundation in daughter's name |date=2010-12-10 |accessdate=2011-04-15 |author=Cary McMullen |publisher=The Ledger[/tpl]

===Senate inquiry===

On November 6, 2007, United States senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa announced an investigation of  White's ministry by the United States Senate Committee on Finance along with five other ministries.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/06/cbsnews_investigates/main3462147.shtml | title=Televangelists Living Like Kings? | publisher=CBS News |date= 2007-11-06  | accessdate =2007-09-17 |author=Armen Keteyian[/tpl] Grassley asked the ministries to divulge financial information.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16860611| title=Senator Probes Megachurches' Finances |author=Kathy Lohr |publisher=National Public Radio |date=2007-12-04 |accessdate =2007-12-10[/tpl] When CBS News reported the story, White's ministry denied any wrongdoing,[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/06/cbsnews_investigates/main3462147.shtml | title=Televangelists Living Like Kings? | publisher=CBS News |date=2007-11-06 | accessdate =2007-09-17[/tpl] and on March 31, 2008, the Senate Finance Committee received a joint financial report from Without Walls International Church and Paula White Ministries.[tpl]Cite web| title=Without Walls sends financial data to Senate |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/article439782.ece |publisher=The Tampa Tribune |accessdate= 2008-04-22 |author=Bill Coats |date=2008-04-01[/tpl] Without Walls International Church was one of four ministries that refused to provide the full information Senator Grassley requested.http://finance.senate.gov/newsroom/ranking/release/?id=5fa343ed-87eb-49b0-82b9-28a9502910f7
On January 6, 2011, Senator Grassley concluded the three-year investigation with no penalties and no definitive findings of wrongdoing.[tpl]Cite web| title=Televangelists escape penalty in Senate inquiry |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40960871/ns/politics-capitol_hill/ |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate= 2011-04-08 |author=Rachel Zoll |date=2011-01-07[/tpl] The Alliance Defense Fund protested the investigation and the National Religious Broadcasters said the questions Senator Grassley asked were too broad.  The Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability plans to create a national commission in response to the Grassley report to lead a review on accountability and policy. White interpreted the conclusion of the investigation to mean that Without Walls International Church was cleared.

===New Destiny Christian Center===

On December 31, 2011, the board of New Destiny Christian Church in Apopka, Florida, announced they had appointed Paula White to succeed Zachery Tims as the new senior pastor. New Destiny Christian Center had been searching for his replacement since Tims' death in August 2011.[tpl]Cite web|author=Josh Cascio|title=Church taps Paula White as new leader|publisher=WTVT |date=2011-12-30 |url=http://www.myfoxtampabay.com/dpp/news/local/hillsborough/paula-white-new-destiny-122911|accessdate=2012-01-11[/tpl] Tims’ ex-wife Riva filed a lawsuit against the Board of Directors, but quickly dropped it, citing a hold harmless clause in her 2009 marital settlement agreement.[tpl]Cite web|author=Mona Austin|title=Riva Tims Can’t Sue; Paula White Now Pastor of New Destiny|publisher=EuroWeb |date=2012-01-03 |url=http://www.eurweb.com/2012/01/riva-tims-paula-white-new-destiny/|accessdate=2012-01-11[/tpl] 
Upon hearing of the controversy, Paula White addressed New Destiny Christian Center during a service she was leading.  “I’m not asking you to like me. I’m not asking you to love me or respect me, because I’ll do the work to earn that. I always ask people to give me one year of your life and I promise you will be changed.”
On January 1, 2012, Paula White officially became the Senior Pastor for New Destiny Christian Center in Apopka, Florida. 

==Personal life==

===Marriage===

White's first marriage was as a teenager to the father of her son, Dean Knight. In 1984, while living in Maryland with her newborn baby, she was introduced to the gospel and became a Christian. Her marriage ended soon after. 
According to the book, Holy Mavericks, a vital turning point came in White's life in 1989 when she met Randy White, a third-generation preacher in the Church of God denomination. Randy was recovering from the divorce of his first marriage and was in the early stages of reviving his career as a preacher and evangelist. They met while he was visiting the church where White volunteered as a janitor. They became friends and dated for several months, working together in ministry projects. Less than a year after meeting, Randy proposed during a tour to Israel and she accepted. Shortly thereafter they moved from Maryland to Tampa, Florida.
In an article published in The Tampa Tribune in 2007, when Paula's husband (Randy White) was asked whether he was contemplating a divorce he replied, "No one can predict the future."[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.tbo.com/news/metro/MGB9CH2XW1F.html |title=Of Faith, Fame & Fortune |date=2007-05-20 |accessdate=2007-09-11 |author=Michelle Bearden and Baird Helgeson |publisher=The Tampa Tribune |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070909194110/http://www.tbo.com/news/metro/MGB9CH2XW1F.html  |archivedate = 2007-09-09[/tpl]
On August 23, 2007, Randy White announced to the Without Walls International Church congregation that he and Paula were divorcing. Randy stated from the pulpit of Without Walls International Church: "We have a very difficult announcement to make tonight before Tim Storey preaches. And that is that we are going through a divorce. It is the most difficult decision that I have had to make in my entire life and I come to you tonight to first let you know that I take full responsibility for a failed marriage." According to The Christian Post, White says the divorce was amicable and they remain friends.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/paula-white-breaks-silence-on-probes-divorce-benny-hinn-49671/ |title=Paula White Breaks Silence on Probes, Divorce, Benny Hinn |date=2011-04-01 |accessdate=2011-04-08 |author=Lillian Kwon |publisher=The Christian Post[/tpl]
