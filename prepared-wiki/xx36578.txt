In the mathematical field of real analysis, the monotone convergence theorem is any of a number of related theorems proving the convergence of monotonic sequences (sequences that are increasing or decreasing) that are also bounded. Informally, the theorems state that if a sequence is increasing and bounded above by a supremum, then the sequence will converge to the supremum; in the same way, if a sequence is decreasing and is bounded below by an infimum, it will converge to the infimum.

==Convergence of a monotone sequence of real numbers==

===Lemma 1===

If a sequence of real numbers is increasing and bounded above, then its supremum is the limit.

===Proof===

===Lemma 2===

If a sequence of real numbers is decreasing and bounded below, then its infimum is the limit.

===Proof===

The proof is similar to the proof for the case when the sequence is increasing and bounded above.

===Theorem===

===Proof===

The proof follows directly from the lemmas.

==Convergence of a monotone series==

===Theorem===

If for all natural numbers j and k, aj,k is a non-negative real number and aj,k ≤ aj+1,k, then (see for instance [tpl]cite book|author=J Yeh|title=Real analysis. Theory of measure and integration|year=2006[/tpl] page 168)
The theorem states that if you have an infinite matrix of non-negative real numbers such that
then the limit of the sums of the rows is equal to the sum of the series whose term k is given by the limit of column k (which is also its supremum). The series has a convergent sum if and only if the (weakly increasing) sequence of row sums is bounded and therefore convergent. 
As an example, consider the infinite series of rows
where n approaches infinity (the limit of this series is e). Here the matrix entry in row n and column k is

==Lebesgue's monotone convergence theorem==

This theorem generalizes the previous one, and is probably the most important monotone convergence theorem. It is also known as Beppo Levi's theorem.

===Theorem===

Then f is Σ–measurable and
provided that f is Σ–measurable (see for instance [tpl]cite book|author=Erik Schechter|title=Analysis and Its Foundations|year=1997[/tpl] section 21.38).

===Proof===

We will first show that f is Σ–measurable  (see for instance  section 21.3). To do this, it is sufficient to show that the inverse image of an interval 0, t under f is an element of the sigma algebra Σ on X, because (closed) intervals generate the Borel sigma algebra on the reals. Let I = 0, t be such a subinterval of 0, ∞. Let
Thus, 
By the definition of the Lebesgue integral,
Hence, since the supremum of a subset cannot be larger than that of the whole set, we have that: 
and the limit on the right exists, since the sequence is monotonic.
We now prove the inequality in the other direction (which also follows from Fatou's lemma), that is we seek to show that
It follows from the definition of integral, that there is a non-decreasing sequence (gk) of non-negative simple functions such that gk ≤ f and such that
because if this is true for each k, then the limit of the left-hand side will also be less than or equal to the right-hand side.
We will show that if gk is a simple function and
for every x, then 
To prove this result, fix ε > 0 and define the sequence of measurable sets 
Thus, we have that
Using the monotonicity property of measures, we can continue the above equalities as follows:
Taking k → ∞, and using the fact that this is true for any positive ε, the result follows.
