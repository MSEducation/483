[[Image:Price-Earnings Ratios as a Predictor of Twenty-Year Returns (Shiller Data).png|400px|right|thumb|Price-Earnings ratios as a predictor of twenty-year returns based upon the plot by Robert Shiller (Figure 10.1,[tpl]cite book |last=Shiller |first=Robert |title=Irrational Exuberance (2d ed.)|year=2005 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn= 0-691-12335-7 [/tpl]  source). The horizontal axis shows the real price-earnings ratio of the S&P Composite Stock Price Index as computed in Irrational Exuberance (inflation adjusted price divided by the prior ten-year mean of inflation-adjusted earnings). The vertical axis shows the geometric average real annual return on investing in the S&P Composite Stock Price Index, reinvesting dividends, and selling twenty years later. Data from different twenty-year
periods is color-coded as shown in the key. See also ten-year returns. Shiller states that this plot "confirms that long-term investors—investors who commit their money to an investment for ten full years—did do well when prices were low relative to earnings at the beginning of the ten years. Long-term investors would be well advised, individually, to lower their exposure to the stock market when it is high, as it has been recently, and get into the market when it is low." Burton Malkiel, a well-known proponent of the general validity of EMH, stated that this correlation may be consistent with an efficient market due to differences in interest rates.Burton G. Malkiel (2006). A Random Walk Down Wall Street. ISBN 0-393-32535-0. p.254.]]
Investors and researchers have disputed the efficient-market hypothesis both empirically and theoretically. Behavioral economists attribute the imperfections in financial markets to a combination of cognitive biases such as overconfidence, overreaction, representative bias, information bias, and various other predictable human errors in reasoning and information processing. These have been researched by psychologists such as Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, Richard Thaler, and Paul Slovic. These errors in reasoning lead most investors to avoid value stocks and buy growth stocks at expensive prices, which allow those who reason correctly to profit from bargains in neglected value stocks and the overreacted selling of growth stocks.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2013[/tpl]
Empirical evidence has been mixed, but has generally not supported strong forms of the efficient-market hypothesis[ref]Empirical papers questioning EMH:
One can identify "losers" as stocks that have had poor returns over some number of past years. "Winners" would be those stocks that had high returns over a similar period. The main result of one such study is that losers have much higher average returns than winners over the following period of the same number of years.[tpl]cite journal | author = DeBondt, Werner F.M. & Thaler, Richard H. | title = Does the Stock Market Overreact | journal = Journal of Finance | volume = 40 | pages = 793–805 | year = 1985 | doi = 10.2307/2327804 [/tpl] A later study showed that beta (β) cannot account for this difference in average returns.[tpl]cite journal | author = Chopra, Navin; Lakonishok, Josef; & Ritter, Jay R. | title = Measuring Abnormal Performance: Do Stocks Overreact | journal = Journal of Financial Economics | volume = 31 | pages = 235–268 | year = 1985 | doi = 10.1016/0304-405X(92)90005-I | issue = 2[/tpl] This tendency of returns to reverse over long horizons (i.e., losers become winners) is yet another contradiction of EMH. Losers would have to
have much higher betas than
winners in order to justify the return difference. The study showed that the beta difference required to save the EMH is just not there.
Speculative economic bubbles are an obvious anomaly, in that the market often appears to be driven by buyers operating on escalating market sentiment/  irrational exuberance, who take little notice of underlying value. These bubbles are typically followed by an overreaction of frantic selling, allowing shrewd investors to buy stocks at bargain prices. Rational investors have difficulty profiting by shorting irrational bubbles because, as John Maynard Keynes commented, "Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2013[/tpl] Sudden market crashes as happened on Black Monday in 1987 are mysterious from the perspective of efficient markets, but allowed as a rare statistical event under the Weak-form of EMH.
Burton Malkiel, has warned that certain emerging markets such as China are not empirically efficient; that the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets, unlike markets in United States, exhibit considerable serial correlation (price trends), non-random walk, and evidence of manipulation.Burton Malkiel.

Behavioral psychology approaches to stock market trading are among some of the more promising[tpl]Citation needed|date=April 2013[/tpl] alternatives to EMH (and some[tpl]which|date=April 2013[/tpl] investment strategies seek to exploit exactly such inefficiencies). But Nobel Laureate co-founder of the programme Daniel Kahneman —announced his skepticism of investors beating the market: "They're investors just not going to do it the market. It's just not going to happen."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ifa.com/Book/Book_pdf/02_Nobel_Laureates.pdf |title=Step 2: Nobel Laureates |accessdate=12 August 2005 |last=Hebner |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Hebner |date=12 August 2005 |work=Index Funds: The 12-Step Program for Active Investors |publisher=Index Funds Advisors, Inc.[/tpl] Indeed defenders of EMH maintain that Behavioral Finance strengthens the case for EMH in that BF highlights biases in individuals and committees and not competitive markets. For example, one prominent finding in Behaviorial Finance is that individuals employ hyperbolic discounting. It is demonstrably true that bonds, mortgages, annuities and other similar financial instruments subject to competitive market forces do not. Any manifestation of hyperbolic discounting in the pricing of these obligations would invite arbitrage thereby quickly eliminating any vestige of individual biases. Similarly, diversification, derivative securities and other hedging strategies assuage if not eliminate potential mispricings from the severe risk-intolerance (loss aversion) of individuals underscored by behavioral finance. On the other hand, economists, behaviorial psychologists and mutual fund managers are drawn from the human population and are therefore subject to the biases that behavioralists showcase. By contrast, the price signals in markets are far less subject to individual biases highlighted by the Behavioral Finance programme. Richard Thaler has started a fund based on his research on cognitive biases. In a 2008 report he identified complexity and herd behavior as central to the global financial crisis of 2008.[ref]Thaler RH. (2008). 3Q2008.

Further empirical work has highlighted the impact transaction costs have on the concept of market efficiency, with much evidence suggesting that any anomalies pertaining to market inefficiencies are the result of a cost benefit analysis made by those willing to incur the cost of acquiring the valuable information in order to trade on it. Additionally the concept of liquidity is a critical component to capturing "inefficiencies" in tests for abnormal returns. Any test of this proposition faces the joint hypothesis problem, where it is impossible to ever test for market efficiency, since to do so requires the use of a measuring stick against which abnormal returns are compared —one cannot know if the market is efficient if one does not know if a model correctly stipulates the required rate of return. Consequently, a situation arises where either the asset pricing model is incorrect or the market is inefficient, but one has no way of knowing which is the case.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]
A key work on random walk was done in the late 1980s by Profs. Andrew Lo and Craig MacKinlay; they effectively argue that a random walk does not exist, nor ever has.[tpl]cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/6558.html|title=A Non-Random Walk Down Wall Street|work=Princeton University Press [/tpl] Their paper took almost two years to be accepted by academia and in 1999 they published "A Non-random Walk Down Wall St." which collects their research papers on the topic up to that time.
Economists Matthew Bishop and Michael Green claim that full acceptance of the hypothesis goes against the thinking of Adam Smith and John Maynard Keynes, who both believed irrational behavior had a real impact on the markets.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/business/21shelf.html|title=The Case for Financial Reinvention|work=The New York Times |accessdate=29 March 2010 |date=19 March 2010 | first=Harry | last=Hurt III[/tpl]
Warren Buffett has also argued against EMH, most notably in his 1984 presentation The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville, saying the preponderance of value investors among the world's best money managers rebuts the claim of EMH proponents that luck is the reason some investors appear more successful than others.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/paul-the-octopus-proves-buffett-was-right-20100714-10air.html?autostart=1|title=Paul the octopus proves Buffett was right|work=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=4 August 2010 |date=14 July 2010 | first=Greg | last=Hoffman[/tpl] As Malkiel Malkiel, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, 1996 has shown, over the 30 years (to 1996) more than two-thirds of professional portfolio managers have been outperformed by the S&P 500 Index (and, more to the point, there is little correlation between those who outperform in one year and those who outperform in the next.)
Economist John Quiggin has claimed that "Bitcoin is perhaps the finest example of a pure bubble", and that it provides a conclusive refutation of EMH.[tpl]cite news|url=http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/the-bitcoin-bubble-bad-hypothesis-8353|title=The Bitcoin Bubble and a Bad Hypothesis|last=Quiggin|first=John|work=The National Interest|date=16 April 2013 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/IQVny |archivedate=2013-04-29 |deadurl=no[/tpl] While other assets used as currency (such as gold, tobacco and U.S. dollars) have value independent of people's willingness to accept them as payment, Quiggin argues that "in the case of Bitcoin there is no source of value whatsoever" and that:
 
 Since Bitcoins do not generate any actual earnings, they must appreciate in value to ensure that people are willing to hold them. But an endless appreciation, with no flow of earnings or liquidation value, is precisely the kind of bubble the EMH says can’t happen.

In 2013, Kim Man Lui pointed out that there is difference of performance between experienced and novice traders in a controlled experiment. If the market really walks randomly, there should be no difference between these two kinds of traders. However, traders who are more knowledgeable on technical analysis significantly outperform those who are less knowledgeable.K.M. Lui and T.T.L Chong, "Do Technical Analysts Outperform Novice Traders: Experimental Evidence" Economics Bulletin. 33(4), 3080-3087, 2013.

==Late 2000s financial crisis==

The financial crisis of 2007–2012 has led to renewed scrutiny and criticism of the hypothesis.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/features/taking-stock/sun-finally-sets-on-notion-that-markets-are-rational/article1206213/|title=Sun finally sets on notion that markets are rational|work=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=7 July 2009 |date=7 July 2009[/tpl] Market strategist Jeremy Grantham has stated flatly that the EMH is responsible for the current financial crisis, claiming that belief in the hypothesis caused financial leaders to have a "chronic underestimation of the dangers of asset bubbles breaking". Noted financial journalist Roger Lowenstein blasted the theory, declaring "The upside of the current Great Recession is that it could drive a stake through the heart of the academic nostrum known as the efficient-market hypothesis." Former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker chimed in, saying it's "clear that among the causes of the recent financial crisis was an unjustified faith in rational expectations and market efficiencies."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/nov/24/financial-reform-unfinished-business/ |title= Financial Reform: Unfinished Business|author=Paul Volcker |date=October 27, 2011 |work= |publisher= New York Review of Books|accessdate=22 November 2011[/tpl] "By 2007–2009, you had to be a fanatic to believe in the literal truth of the EMH", noted one financial analyst.[tpl]Cite journal |last= Siegel |first= Laurence B. |year= 2010 |title= Black Swan or Black Turkey?

At the International Organization of Securities Commissions annual conference, held in June 2009, the hypothesis took center stage. Martin Wolf, the chief economics commentator for the Financial Times, dismissed the hypothesis as being a useless way to examine how markets function in reality. Paul McCulley, managing director of PIMCO, was less extreme in his criticism, saying that the hypothesis had not failed, but was "seriously flawed" in its neglect of human nature.[tpl]cite news |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1244371066953&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|title=Has 'guiding model' for global markets gone haywire?|work=Jerusalem Post |accessdate=17 June 2009 |date=11 June 2009[/tpl]
The financial crisis has led Richard Posner, a prominent judge, University of Chicago law professor, and innovator in the field of Law and Economics, to back away from the hypothesis and express some degree of belief in Keynesian economics. Posner accused some of his Chicago School colleagues of being "asleep at the switch", saying that "the movement to deregulate the financial industry went too far by exaggerating the resilience—the self healing powers—of laissez-faire capitalism."[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/01/11/100111fa_fact_cassidy|title=After the Blowup|work=The New Yorker |accessdate=12 January 2010 |date=11 January 2010[/tpl] Others, such as Eugene Fama, said that the hypothesis held up well during the crisis and that the markets were a casualty of the recession, not the cause of it. Despite this, Fama has conceded that "poorly informed investors could theoretically lead the market astray" and that stock prices could become "somewhat irrational" as a result.Jon E. Hilsenrath, Stock Characters: As Two Economists Debate Markets, The Tide Shifts. Wall Street Journal 2004
Critics have suggested that financial institutions and corporations have been able to reduce the efficiency of financial markets by creating private information and reducing the accuracy of conventional disclosures, and by developing new and complex products which are challenging for most market participants to evaluate and correctly price.Michael Simkovic, "Secret Liens and the Financial Crisis of 2008", American Bankruptcy Law Journal 2009Michael Simkovic, "Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization"
