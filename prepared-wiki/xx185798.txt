U.S. Route 52 (US 52) is a North–South U.S. Highway that runs [tpl]convert|161|mi[/tpl] from Charleston to the North Carolina state line near Cheraw. It serves as a strategic highway through the central South Carolina.  Though an even numbered U.S. Route, it is signed north-south in South Carolina (standard convention being to label even numbered U.S. Routes with east-west designations).  In some other states along its route, it is signed east-west.  The South Carolina segment is signed such that U.S. 52 north corresponds to the general westward direction of the highway, and visa-versa.

==Route description==

US 52 begins at the intersection of Meeting and Line Streets, in Charleston.  Going northwest along Meeting Street, it connects with I-26/US 17, followed by Morrison Drive (US 52 Spur hidden); US 52 signage begin to appear north of Morrison Drive.  In North Charleston, it shares a concurrency with US 78 for [tpl]convert|11|mi|km[/tpl], splitting near Goose Creek.  In Moncks Corner it connects with US 17 Alt briefly as it enters and traverses through Francis Marion National Forest.  Continuing north, it goes through St. Stephen, Kingstree and Lake City, before joining another short concurrency with US 301 from Effingham to Florence.  Through downtown Florence, it goes northwest and bypasses Darlington and joining another concurrency with US 401.  At Society Hill, it merges briefly with US 15 before continuing north again solo to Cheraw, where it overlaps briefly with US 1 and SC 9.  US 52 crosses the North Carolina state line, after traveling [tpl]convert|159.7|mi|km[/tpl] through South Carolina, continuing on towards Wadesboro.
US 52 is a major highway between Charleston and Florence, all of which is four-lane or more with some sections signed [tpl]convert|60|mph|adj=on[/tpl].  North of Darlington, it becomes mostly a two-lane rural highway through the remainder of its route.  Though the majority of its routing and signage is north-south, some sections will also be signed east-west at various parts of the state.

==History==

US 52 was established in 1935 as a renumbering of US 601 from the North Carolina state line to Florence and US 17 from Florence to Charleston.  In 1939, US 52 was rerouted into a concurrency with US 78 in North Charleston, leaving a section of Meeting Street.  Also in same year, Cheraw to the North Carolina state line was the last section to be paved; while the first section of US 52 was widen to four-lane from Charleston to Durant Avenue, in North Charleston.
In 1940, US 52 was rerouted onto new alignment west of Lake City.  In 1948, US 52 was taken off King Street and placed on Meeting Street to Lee Street, in Charleston.  Around 1952-1969, US 52 was split during that period in Florence, with northbound along Irby Street and southboudn along Coit Avenue; before and after it was solely on Irby Street.  Also around 1952, US 52 was bypassed west of Kingstree on new primary routing; the old route through town remained part of SC 261 while Academy Street, Kelly Street and Third Avenue were downgraded to secondary roads (all three SC-45-8).
In 1971, US 52 was moved onto new alignment south of Moncks Corner, leaving behind Old Highway 52 (S-8-791).  By 1973, US 52 was placed on new primary routing bypassing west around Darlington, leaving behind US 52 Bus.[tpl]cite map |publisher= South Carolina Department of Transportation |url= http://digital.tcl.sc.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/scrm/id/731/rec/2 |format= PDF |title= General Highway Map, Darlington County, South Carolina |cartography= SCDOT |year= 1971 |accessdate= November 10, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite map |publisher= South Carolina Department of Transportation |url= http://digital.tcl.sc.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/scrm/id/767/rec/3 |format= PDF |title= General Highway Map, Darlington County, South Carolina |cartography= SCDOT |year= 1973 |accessdate= November 10, 2013[/tpl]
