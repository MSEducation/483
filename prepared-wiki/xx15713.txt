The emergence of skin pigmentation dates to after this, perhaps some 1.5 million years ago (about the time of the emergence of Homo heidelbergensis), when the earth endured a megadrought that drove early humans into arid, open landscapes. This would have resulted in early human skin enduring excess UV-B radiation and xeric stress.  This favoured the emergence of skin pigmentation in order to increase the epidermal permeability barrier[tpl]cite journal |last1=Elias |first1=Peter M |last2=Menon  |first2=Gapinathan |last3=Wetzel |first3=Bruce J |last4=Williams |first4=John (Jack) W| journal=American Journal of Human Biology| pmid=20209486 |year=2010 |volume=22 | issue=4| pages=526–537| title=Barrier Requirements as the Evolutionary "Driver" of Epidermal Pigmentation in Humans| doi=10.1002/ajhb.21043 | pmc=3071612[/tpl] and protect from folate depletion due to the increased exposure to sunlight.
With the evolution of hairless skin, abundant sweat glands, and skin rich in melanin, early humans could walk, run, and forage for food for long periods of time under the hot sun without overheating brain damage, giving them an evolutionary advantage over other species. By 1.2 million years ago, around the time of Homo ergaster, archaic humans (including the ancestors of Homo sapiens) had exactly the same receptor protein as modern sub-Saharan Africans.
This was the genotype inherited by anatomically modern humans, but retained only by part of the extant populations, thus forming an aspect of human genetic variation. About 100,000–70,000 years ago some anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens) began to migrate away from the tropics to the north where they were exposed to less intense sunlight, possibly in part due to the need for greater use of clothing to protect against the colder climate. Under these conditions there was less photodestruction of folate and so the evolutionary pressure stopping lighter-skinned gene variants from surviving was reduced. In addition, lighter skin is able to generate more vitamin D (cholecalciferol) than darker skin so it would have represented a health benefit in reduced sunlight if there were limited sources of vitamin D. Hence the leading hypothesis for the evolution of human skin color proposes that:
