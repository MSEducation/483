[[Agoraphobia]]

CATEGORIES: Phobias, Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders

Agoraphobia (from Greek ἀγορά, "open space" and -φοβία, -phobia) is an anxiety disorder characterized by anxiety in situations where the sufferer perceives certain environments as dangerous or uncomfortable, often due to the environment's vast openness or crowdedness. These situations include wide-open spaces, as well as uncontrollable social situations such as the possibility of being met in shopping malls, airports, and on bridges.  Agoraphobia is defined within the DSM-IV TR as a subset of panic disorder, involving the fear of incurring a panic attack in those environments.Behavenet.  DSM-IV & DSM-IV TR: Agorophobia.  http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/agoraphobia.htm In the DSM-5, however, agoraphobia is classified as being separate to panic disorder.[ref]http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Practice/DSM/DSM-5/Changes-from-DSM-IV-TR--to-DSM-5.pdf
(PDF). American Psychiatric Association. May 17, 2013. Retrieved May 23, 2013.[/ref] The sufferer may go to great lengths to avoid those situations, in severe cases becoming unable to leave their home or safe haven.
Although mostly thought to be a fear of public places, it is now believed that agoraphobia develops as a complication of panic attacks.[tpl]cite web|url=http://helpguide.org/mental/panic_disorder_anxiety_attack_symptom_treatment.htm |title=Panic Attacks and Panic Disorder: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment |publisher=Helpguide.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-08[/tpl] However, there is evidence that the implied one-way causal relationship between spontaneous panic attacks and agoraphobia in DSM-IV may be incorrect.Br J Psychiatry. 2006 May;188:432-8. Onset is usually between ages 20 and 40 years and more common in women.Practical guide to the care of the psychiatric patient / by Richard J. Goldberg 3rd ed Philadelphia : Mosby/Elsevier, c2007. p171 Approximately 3.2 million, or about 2.2%, of adults in the US between the ages of 18 and 54, suffer from agoraphobia.[ref]

Agoraphobia can account for approximately 60% of phobias.p212 Studies have shown two different age groups at first onset: early to mid twenties, and early thirties.[tpl]Cite book  | last1 = Gelder | first1 = Michael G. | last2 = Mayou | first2 = Richard. | last3 = Geddes | first3 = John | title = Psychiatr | year = 2005 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-19-852863-9 | pages =  [/tpl]
In response to a traumatic event, anxiety may interrupt the formation of memories and disrupt the learning processes, resulting in dissociation. Depersonalization (a feeling of disconnection from one’s self) and derealisation (a feeling of disconnection from one's surroundings) are other dissociative methods of withdrawing from anxiety.Nettina, M,S. 2006. Manual of Nursing Practice. 8th Ed. US:Lippincott Company.
Standardized tools such as Panic and Agoraphobia Scale can be used to measure agoraphobia and panic attacks severity and monitor treatment.Bandelow B, Broocks A, Pekrun G, et al.

==Signs and symptoms==

Agoraphobia is a condition where the sufferer becomes anxious in environments that are unfamiliar or where he or she perceives that they have little control. Triggers for this anxiety may include wide open spaces, crowds (social anxiety), or traveling (even short distances). Agoraphobia is often, but not always, compounded by a fear of social embarrassment, as the agoraphobic fears the onset of a panic attack and appearing distraught in public. This is also sometimes called 'social agoraphobia' which may be a type of social anxiety disorder also sometimes called "social phobia".
Not all agoraphobia is social in nature, however. Some agoraphobics have a fear of open spaces. Agoraphobia is also defined as "a fear, sometimes terrifying, by those who have experienced one or more panic attacks". In these cases, the sufferer is fearful of a particular place because they have experienced a panic attack at the same location in a previous time. Fearing the onset of another panic attack, the sufferer is fearful or even avoids the location. Some refuse to leave their home even in medical emergencies because the fear of being outside of their comfort area is too great.
The sufferer can sometimes go to great lengths to avoid the locations where they have experienced the onset of a panic attack. Agoraphobia, as described in this manner, is actually a symptom professionals check for when making a diagnosis of panic disorder. Other syndromes like obsessive compulsive disorder or post traumatic stress disorder can also cause agoraphobia. Essentially, any irrational fear that keeps one from going outside can cause the syndrome.Psych Central: Agoraphobia Symptoms
It is not uncommon for agoraphobics to also suffer from temporary separation anxiety disorder when certain other individuals of the household depart from the residence temporarily, such as a parent or spouse, or when the agoraphobic is left home alone.  Such temporary conditions can result in an increase in anxiety or a panic attack or feel the need to separate themselves from family or maybe friends.
Another common associative disorder of agoraphobia is necrophobia, the fear of death.  The anxiety level of agoraphobics often increases when dwelling upon the idea of eventually dying, which they may consciously or unconsciously associate with being the ultimate separation from their mortal emotional comfort and safety zones and loved ones, even for those who may otherwise spiritually believe in some form of divine afterlife existence.

===Panic attacks===

Agoraphobia patients can experience sudden panic attacks when traveling to places where they fear they are out of control, help would be difficult to obtain, or they could be embarrassed. During a panic attack, epinephrine is released in large amounts, triggering the body's natural fight-or-flight response. A panic attack typically has an abrupt onset, building to maximum intensity within 10 to 15 minutes, and rarely lasts longer than 30 minutes.[tpl]cite book | year=1999 | chapter=Chapter 4.2|author=David Satcher etal.| title=Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General|url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/chapter4/sec2.html[/tpl]  Symptoms of a panic attack include palpitations, a rapid heartbeat, sweating, trembling, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tightness in the throat and shortness of breath. Many patients report a fear of dying or of losing control of emotions and/or behavior.

==Causes==

Although the exact causes of agoraphobia are currently unknown, some clinicians who have treated or attempted to treat agoraphobia offer plausible hypotheses. The condition has been linked to the presence of other anxiety disorders, a stressful environment or substance abuse.[tpl]citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl]
Research has uncovered a linkage between agoraphobia and difficulties with spatial orientation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Yardley L, Britton J, Lear S, Bird J, Luxon LM |title=Relationship between balance system function and agoraphobic avoidance |journal=Behav Res Ther |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=435–9 |date=May 1995 |pmid=7755529 |doi= 10.1016/0005-7967(94)00060-W[/tpl][tpl]cite journal | authorlink = RG Jacob, JM Furman, JD Durrant and SM Turner | title = Panic, agoraphobia, and vestibular dysfunction | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 153 | issue =4 | pages = 503–512 | year =  1996 | pmid =8599398 | last1 =Jacob | first1 =RG | last2 =Furman | first2 =JM | last3 =Durrant | first3 =JD | last4 =Turner | first4 =SM  [/tpl] Individuals without agoraphobia are able to maintain balance by combining information from their vestibular system, their visual system and their proprioceptive sense.  A disproportionate number of agoraphobics have weak vestibular function and consequently rely more on visual or tactile signals.  They may become disoriented when visual cues are sparse (as in wide open spaces) or overwhelming (as in crowds).[tpl]cite journal |author=Jacob RG, Furman JM, Durrant JD, Turner SM |title=Surface dependence: a balance control strategy in panic disorder with agoraphobia |journal=Psychosom Med |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=323–30 |year=1997 |pmid=9178344 |doi= |url=[/tpl] Likewise, they may be confused by sloping or irregular surfaces. In a virtual reality study, agoraphobics showed impaired processing of changing audiovisual data in comparison with non-suffering subjects.[tpl]cite journal |author=Viaud-Delmon I, Warusfel O, Seguelas A, Rio E, Jouvent R |title=High sensitivity to multisensory conflicts in agoraphobia exhibited by virtual reality |journal=Eur.

===Substance induced===

Chronic use of tranquilizers and sleeping pills such as benzodiazepines has been linked to onset of agoraphobia.[tpl]cite book |editor=Palmer S, Dainow S, Milner P (eds.) |title=Counselling: The BACP Counselling Reader |volume=1 |year=1996 |publisher=Sage |isbn=978-0-8039-7477-7 |pages=211–4 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=wnIBEQKQi7IC |author=Hammersley D, Beeley L |chapter=The effects of medication on counselling [/tpl] In 10 patients who had developed agoraphobia during benzodiazepine dependence, symptoms abated within the first year of assisted withdrawal.[tpl]cite journal |author=Ashton H |title=Benzodiazepine withdrawal: outcome in 50 patients |journal=Br J Addict |volume=82 |issue=6 |pages=665–71 |date=June 1987 |pmid=2886145 |doi= 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1987.tb01529.x[/tpl] Similarly, alcohol use disorders are associated with panic with or without agoraphobia; this association may be due to the long-term effects of alcohol misuse causing a distortion in brain chemistry.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cosci F, Schruers KR, Abrams K, Griez EJ |title=Alcohol use disorders and panic disorder: a review of the evidence of a direct relationship |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=68 |issue=6 |pages=874–80 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17592911 |doi=10.4088/JCP.v68n0608[/tpl]
Tobacco smoking has also been associated with the development and emergence of agoraphobia, often with panic disorder; it is uncertain how tobacco smoking results in anxiety-panic with or without agoraphobia symptoms, but the direct effects of nicotine dependence or the effects of tobacco smoke on breathing have been suggested as possible causes. Self-medication or a combination of factors may also explain the association between tobacco smoking and agoraphobia and panic.[tpl]cite journal |author=Cosci F, Knuts IJ, Abrams K, Griez EJ, Schruers KR |title=Cigarette smoking and panic: a critical review of the literature |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=71 |issue=5 |pages=606–15 |date=May 2010 |pmid=19961810 |doi=10.4088/JCP.08r04523blu [/tpl]

===Attachment theory===

Some scholarsG. Liotti, (1996). Insecure attachment and agoraphobia, in: C. Murray-Parkes, J. Stevenson-Hinde, & P. Marris (Eds.). Attachment Across the Life Cycle.J. Bowlby, (1998). Attachment and Loss (Vol. 2: Separation). have explained agoraphobia as an attachment deficit, i.e., the temporary loss of the ability to tolerate spatial separations from a secure base.[tpl]cite journal | author = Jacobson K | year = 2004 | title = Agoraphobia and Hypochondria as Disorders of Dwelling | url = | journal = International Studies in Philosophy | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 31–44 | doi=10.5840/intstudphil2004362165[/tpl] Recent empirical research has also linked attachment and spatial theories of agoraphobia.J. Holmes, (2008). "Space and the secure base in agoraphobia: a qualitative survey", Area, 40, 3, 357 – 382.

===Spatial theory===

In the social sciences there is a perceived clinical biasJ. Davidson, (2003). Phobic Geographies in agoraphobia research. Branches of the social sciences, especially geography, have increasingly become interested in what may be thought of as a spatial phenomenon. One such approach links the development of agoraphobia with modernity.J. Holmes, (2006).

===Evolutionary psychology===

An evolutionary psychology view is that the more unusual primary agoraphobia without panic attacks may be due to a different mechanism from agoraphobia with panic attacks. Primary agoraphobia without panic attacks may be a specific phobia explained by it once having been evolutionarily advantageous to avoid exposed, large open spaces without cover or concealment. On the other hand, agoraphobia with panic attack may be an avoidance response secondary to the panic attacks due to fear of the situations in which the panic attacks occurred.[tpl]cite doi|10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.008[/tpl]Spiti Raffaello, Scarpato Maria Alessandra, Spiti Alessandra (2011). "Primary agoraphobia specific symptoms: from natural information to mental representations". Italian Journal of Psychopathology, 17 (3): 265–276.http://www.gipsicopatol.it/issues/2011/vol17-3/02%20Spiti.pdf

==Diagnosis==

Most people who present to mental health specialists develop agoraphobia after the onset of panic disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 1998). Agoraphobia is best understood as an adverse behavioral outcome of repeated panic attacks and subsequent anxiety and preoccupation with these attacks that leads to an avoidance of situations where a panic attack could occur.[tpl]cite book | year=1988| author=Barlow, D. H.| title=Anxiety and its disorders: The nature and treatment of anxiety and panic| publisher=Guilford Press[/tpl]
In rare cases where agoraphobics do not meet the criteria used to diagnose panic disorder, the formal diagnosis of agoraphobia without history of panic disorder is used (primary agoraphobia).

==Treatments==

===Cognitive behavioral treatments===

Exposure treatment can provide lasting relief to the majority of patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia.  Disappearance of residual and subclinical agoraphobic avoidance, and not simply of panic attacks, should be the aim of exposure therapy.[tpl]cite journal | last1=Fava | first1=G.A. | last2=Rafanelli | first2=C. | last3=Grandi | first3=S. | last4=Cinto | first4=S. | last5=Ruini | first5=C. | title=Long-term outcome of panic disorder with agoraphobia treated by exposure | journal=Psychological Medicine | volume=31 | pages=891–898 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | doi=10.1017/S0033291701003592 | year=2001 | pmid=11459386 | last6=Mangelli | first6=L | last7=Belluardo | first7=P | issue=5[/tpl]  Similarly, Systematic desensitization may also be used. Many patients can deal with exposure easier if they are in the company of a friend they can rely on. It is vital that patients remain in the situation until anxiety has abated because if they leave the situation the phobic response will not decrease and it may even rise.
Cognitive restructuring has also proved useful in treating agoraphobia. This treatment involves coaching a participant through a dianoetic discussion, with the intent of replacing irrational, counterproductive beliefs with more factual and beneficial ones.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl]
Relaxation techniques are often useful skills for the agoraphobic to develop, as they can be used to stop or prevent symptoms of anxiety and panic.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl]

===Medications===

Anti-depressant medications most commonly used to treat anxiety disorders are mainly in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Benzodiazepines, MAO inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants are also sometimes prescribed for treatment of agoraphobia.[tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2008[/tpl] Antidepressants are important because some have antipanic effects. Antidepressants should be used in conjunction with exposure as a form of self-help or with cognitive behaviour therapy. Some evidence shows that a combination of medication and cognitive behaviour therapy is the most effective treatment for agoraphobia.

===Alternative treatments===

Eye movement desensitization and reprogramming (EMDR) has been studied as a possible treatment for agoraphobia, with poor results.[ref]

</ref>
As such, EMDR is only recommended in cases where cognitive-behavioral approaches have proven ineffective or in cases where agoraphobia has developed following trauma.
Many people with anxiety disorders benefit from joining a self-help or support group (telephone conference call support groups or online support groups being of particular help for completely housebound individuals). Sharing problems and achievements with others as well as sharing various self-help tools are common activities in these groups. In particular stress management techniques and various kinds of meditation practices as well as visualization techniques can help people with anxiety disorders calm themselves and may enhance the effects of therapy. So can service to others which can distract from the self-absorption that tends to go with anxiety problems. There is also preliminary evidence that aerobic exercise may have a calming effect. Since caffeine, certain illicit drugs, and even some over-the-counter cold medications can aggravate the symptoms of anxiety disorders, they should be avoided.

==Epidemiology==

Agoraphobia occurs about twice as commonly among women as it does in men.[tpl]Cite journal | last1 = Magee | first1 = WJ. | last2 = Eaton | first2 = WW. | last3 = Wittchen | first3 = HU. | last4 = McGonagle | first4 = KA. | last5 = Kessler | first5 = RC. | title = Agoraphobia, simple phobia, and social phobia in the National Comorbidity Survey. | journal = Arch Gen Psychiatry | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–68|date=Feb 1996 | pmid = 8629891 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1996.01830020077009[/tpl] The gender difference may be attributable to several factors: social-cultural traditions that encourage, or permit, the greater expression of avoidant coping strategies by women (including dependent and helpless behaviors); women perhaps being more likely to seek help and therefore be diagnosed; men being more likely to abuse alcohol in reaction to anxiety and be diagnosed as an alcoholic.[tpl]cite web | last = Agoraphobia Research Center | title = Is agoraphobia more common in men or women? | url=http://www.agoraphobia.ws/whogets.htm |accessdate = 2007-11-15 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071202133421/http://www.agoraphobia.ws/whogets.htm|archivedate= 2 December 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Research has not yet produced a single clear explanation for the gender difference in agoraphobia.
