If you want to live in harmony with nature, you must follow the tropical naturism , now if you want to get sick first medicine should be used and nobody wants to get sick". | Dr. Pallathadka Keshava Bhat |[tpl]cite web|title=Keshava Bhat, el padre del Naturismo Tropical |url=http://www.despertarintegral.com/2011/12/keshava-bhat-el-padre-del-naturismo-tropical/|publisher=despertarintegral |accessdate=14 August 2013[/tpl] [/tpl]
