==Life==

The Bunker brothers were born on May 11, 1811, in Siam (now Thailand), in the province of Samutsongkram, to a fisherman and his wife (Nak; [tpl]lang-th|นาก[/tpl]).[tpl]cite web|url=http://goofy313g.free.fr/calisota_online/exist/twins.html |title=Chang and Eng, the Siamese Twins |publisher=Calisota Online |date= |accessdate=May 28, 2012[/tpl] Because of their Chinese heritage (as they were born from a Thai Chinese father and a Chinese-Malay mother),[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cojoweb.com/siamese%20twins.html |title=Eng and Chang Bunker |date= |accessdate=May 28, 2012[/tpl] they were known as the "Chinese Twins" in Siam. They were joined at the sternum by a small piece of cartilage. Their livers were fused but independently complete.
In 1829, British merchant Robert Hunter "discovered" them and paid their family to let them be exhibited as a curiosity during a world tour. Upon termination of their contract with Hunter, the brothers successfully went into business for themselves. In 1839, while visiting Wilkesboro, North Carolina, the twins were attracted to the area and settled on a [tpl]convert|110|acre|km2|adj=on[/tpl] farm in nearby Traphill, becoming naturalized United States citizens.
Determined to start living a normal life as much as possible, the brothers settled on a plantation, bought slaves,UNC Univ. Libraries, Southern Historical Collection no. 03761 and adopted the name "Bunker". On April 13, 1843, they married two sisters: Chang to Adelaide Yates and Eng to Sarah Anne Yates. 
Their Traphill home is where they shared a bed built for four. Chang and his wife had 10 children; Eng and his wife had 11. In time, the wives squabbled[tpl]Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Chang and Eng|year=1900[/tpl] This source confirms the wives' dispute, but disagrees on the number of children and says nothing about the household arrangements. and eventually two separate households were set up just west of Mount Airy, North Carolina in the community of White Plains – the twins would alternate spending three days at each home. During the American Civil War, Chang's son Christopher and Eng's son Stephen both fought for the Confederacy. Chang and Eng lost part of their property as a result of the war, and were very bitter in their denunciation of the government in consequence. 
After the war, they again resorted to public exhibitions, but were not very successful. They always maintained a high character for integrity and fair dealing, and were much esteemed by their neighbors. The twins died on the same day in January 1874. Chang, who had contracted pneumonia, died rather suddenly in his sleep. According to the Travel Channel's "Mysteries at the Museum", Chang suffered a stroke the night that he died. Eng awoke to find his brother dead, and called for his wife and children to attend to him. A doctor was summoned to perform an emergency separation, but he was too late. Eng died three hours later. 
Sarah Anne Bunker (Eng's widow) died on April 29, 1892, and Adelaide Bunker (Chang's widow) died on May 21, 1917.

==Legacy==

The fused liver of the Bunker brothers was preserved and is currently on display at the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Numerous artifacts of the twins, including some of their personal artifacts and their travel ledger, are displayed in the North Carolina Collection Gallery in Wilson Library at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; this includes the original watercolor portrait of Chang and Eng from 1836.
