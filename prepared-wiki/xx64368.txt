==Reception==

Allmusic gave the album 3.5 stars stating: "With their second album, Rio Grande Mud, ZZ Top uses the sound they sketched out on their debut as a blueprint, yet they tweak it in slight but important ways."
The album peaked at number 104 on the Billboard 200.

==Singles==

The only single released from the album was "Francine" (b/w "Down Brownie") which peaked at number 69 on the Billboard Hot 100. Another 45 version was released with "Francine" appearing on both sides (side one with English vocals and side two with Spanish vocals). Various official ZZ Top releases throughout the years, beginning in 1972, have used the alternative spelling "Francene", especially on the various 45 releases both within and outside the United States. A song about romance with an underage girl, the lyrics contain lines such as "My Francine just turned thirteen, she's my angelic teenage queen, and I love her, she's all that I want."
