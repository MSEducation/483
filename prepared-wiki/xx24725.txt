[[Basic Rate Interface]]

CATEGORIES: Integrated Services Digital Network

Basic Rate Interface (BRI, 2B+D, 2B1D) is an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) configuration intended primarily for use in subscriber lines similar to those that have long been used for voice-grade telephone service. The BRI configuration provides 2 bearer channels (B channels) at 64 kbit/s each and 1 data channel (D channel) at 16 kbit/s. The B channels are used for voice or user data, and the D channel is used for any combination of data, control/signalling, and X.25 packet networking. The 2 B channels can be aggregated by channel bonding providing a total data rate of 128 kbit/s. The BRI ISDN service is commonly installed for residential or small business service (ISDN PABX) in many countries.
In contrast to the BRI, the Primary Rate Interface (PRI) configuration provides more B channels and operates at a higher bit rate.

The BRI is split in two sections:
a) in-house cabling (S/T reference point or S-bus) from the ISDN terminal up to the NT and
b) transmission from the NT to the central office (U reference point).
