CATEGORIES: Canadian blues

Canadian blues is the blues and blues-related music (e.g., blues rock) performed by blues bands and performers in Canada. There are hundreds of local and regionally-based Canadian blues bands and performers, that perform mainly in their home city or town. A smaller number of bands or performers have achieved national or international prominence, and have appeared at major festivals in Canada, the US, and in Europe.Encyclopedia of Canadian rock, pop and folk music by Rick Jackson, (Kingston, ON: Quarry Press, 1994). (ISBN 15-50821-075)The Penguin Book of Canadian Folk Songs by Edith Fowke. Markham, ON: Penguin, 1986. (ISBN 0-14-070842-1) These bands and performers are part of a broader Canadian "blues scene" that also includes city or regional blues societies, blues radio shows, and blues festivals.

==Origins==

Due to Canada's proximity to the United States, many US blues artists have played in Canada. As well, many Canadian bands have been able to play in the US towns, particularly those near the border, such as Detroit and Chicago. These two elements have given Canadian blues musicians a substantial opportunity to be directly influenced by US artists. Canadian blues is based on the major US blues styles, such as Chicago Blues and Mississippi Blues.[tpl]fact|date=May 2013[/tpl] For example, the Canadian bluesman JW-Jones had his third album, My Kind Of Evil (2004), produced by the US artist Kim Wilson (singer for The Fabulous Thunderbirds), and subsequent albums included collaborations with US saxophonist David "Fathead" Newman and US blues artists such as Little Charlie Baty, Junior Watson, Richard Innes, and Larry Taylor. Canadian harp player and band leader David Rotundo has visited many of the key US blues regions, which greatly influenced his development.

==Nationally or internationally-prominent artists==

A small number of Canadian blues bands and artists have achieved national or international prominence by touring across Canada, the US, or Europe, and releasing recordings that have received critical or audience acclaim in Canada and abroad. The performers below are listed according to the decade during which they first achieved national or international prominence.  

===1950s-1970s===

In late 1950s, US-born rockabilly pioneer Ronnie Hawkins (born 1935) came to Canada, where he became a key player in the 1960s rock and blues scene in Toronto. 4 October 2002 was declared "Ronnie Hawkins Day" by the city of Toronto when Hawkins was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame, and he was inducted into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame at the Canadian Music Industry Awards in 2004. His pioneering contribution to rockabilly has also been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. His 1984 LP, 'Making It Again', earned him a Juno Award for Country Male Vocalist.
Richard Newell (1944–2003), who performed under the nickname "King Biscuit Boy", was a vocalist, arranger, songwriter, slide guitarist, and harmonica player. He released his first solo recording, "Official Music", in 1970, and it charted on the US Billboard album charts.  A native of Hamilton, Ontario, he had learned his craft playing in blues rock bands and backing up Ronnie Hawkins, who gave him his nickname.  In 1980, his release entitled "Mouth of Steel" appeared on the "Red Lightning" record label from England. In 1987, his recording "King Biscuit Boy AKA Richard Newell" was nominated for a Juno Award in the Best Roots and Traditional category.
In the 1970s, the Downchild Blues Band was formed in Toronto by Donnie Walsh. The band has released fourteen albums and performed in thousands of venues over three decades of continual cross-Canada touring. The Downchild Blues Band still performs regularly. Another important Canadian bluesman who became notable during the 1970s was Norman "Dutch" Mason (born February 19, 1938 in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, died December 23, 2006 in Truro, Nova Scotia). Mason was a Canadian singer, guitarist, and pianist who was nicknamed the "Prime Minister of the Blues" in the 1970s for his prominent role in the Canadian blues scene. His albums included Dutch Mason Trio at the Candlelight from 1971 (Paragon ALS-263) and Janitor of the Blues from 1977 (Solar SAR-2020). In 1991 he released I'm Back (Stony Plain SPCD-1169).  He was inducted into the Canadian Jazz and Blues Hall of Fame, and in 2005, he became a Member of the Order of Canada. That same year, son Garrett Mason won a Juno Award for Best Blues album.

===1980s-1990s===

In 1980, the Powder Blues, led by Tom Lavin, had double platinum sales for their debut album ‘Uncut’, which also had four top ten songs. The band won a Juno for ‘Best New Group’. The second album, Thirsty Ears, released on Capitol Records had platinum sales, and a top 5 single. In 1983, Powder Blues played at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland and North Sea Jazz Festival in the Netherlands. In 1986, the band won the W.C. Handy Award for blues in Memphis, Tennessee for ‘Best Foreign Blues Band’.  Studio albums and touring continued from the 1990s until the present day. 
In the early 1980s, David Wilcox became a well-known songwriter, singer, and guitar player in the blues and roots scene. His many years of performing have given him five gold albums and numerous awards. Wilcox played the college campus circuit in the early 1980s, then signed a recording contract with EMI Music Canada. Five of his albums with EMI achieved Gold status.

In the mid-1980s, singer and blues guitarist Jeff Healey caught the public's attention with his unconventional lap-top style of playing electric guitar. Healey, who lost his sight to a form of cancer called retinoblastoma, was praised by B.B. King for “his virtuoso technique” and by Stevie Ray Vaughan, who said that Healey would “revolutionize guitar playing.” The Jeff Healey Band was formed in 1985, and released a debut album that achieved platinum sales in the US, in part due to the hit single "Angel Eyes". The Jeff Healey Band won a Juno Award for Canadian Entertainer of the Year and two Grammy nominations, and performed a cameo role in the movie "Road House".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/roadhouse.htm |title=Road House Movie - The 80s Movies Rewind |publisher=Fast-rewind.com |date=1989-05-19 |accessdate=2012-10-19[/tpl] Healey was a jazz radio host for the CBC and CJRT-FM, a blues club owner, and performer (acoustic guitar and trumpet) in traditional jazz groups.

In the late 1980s, vocalist, guitarist, and songwriter Colin James (whose full name is Colin James Munn) (born in 1964) first attracted attention with his blues-rock songs.  He has released nine studio albums that blend the blues, rock, and swing genres.

The label has released over 300 albums of “roots” music styles, such as blues, classic R&B, folk, country, bluegrass, and rock and roll. Jerry Wexler, one of the founders of Atlantic Records, states that “Stony Plain, as an independent company, is an endangered species in a dangerous world – and a source of wonderful music.”[tpl]cite web|url=http://stonyplainrecords.com/Web/about_us.asp |title=Stony Plain Records: About Us |publisher=Stonyplainrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-19[/tpl]

Some of the large festivals include the Ottawa Bluesfest, the Fredericton Harvest Jazz & Blues Festival in New Brunswick,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.harvestjazzandblues.com |title=The Harvest Jazz & Blues Festival |publisher=Harvestjazzandblues.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-19[/tpl] the Dutch Mason Blues Festival in Nova Scotia,[tpl]cite web|author=The DMBF Team |url=http://www.dutchmason.com/festival/ |title=2012 Dutch Mason Blues Festival | Festival Home Page |publisher=Dutchmason.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-19[/tpl] The Hamilton Blues & Roots Festival in Ontario, and the Edmonton's Labatt Blues Festival.
Canadian blues bands also appear at a range of venues, including bars, taverns, lounges, and community centre concert series.

Some of the best-known blues venues in Toronto are Healey's (named for former owner Jeff Healey) and The Silver Dollar Room. Other well-known Canadian venues include "Café Campus" in Montreal, Blues at the Bow Live in Alberta, "Blues On Whyte" in Edmonton, "The Shamrock Hotel" in Calgary, "The Blues Can" in Calgary, and "The Yale" in Vancouver. A new club in Hamilton, Ontario, that is gaining favor due to its small size and true blues joint feel is Boon's House: Rockin' Blues Lounge.[tpl]cite web |url= http://www.boonshouse.com/ |title=Account Suspended |publisher=Boonshouse.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-19[/tpl]
