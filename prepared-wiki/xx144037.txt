==History==

The company was established in 1928 under the name "Luxury Hotels of Europe and Egypt".[tpl]cite web| url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=6762423| title=The Leading Hotels of the World, Ltd.| work=Bloomberg Businessweek| accessdate=2013-08-22[/tpl]  It initially had 38 member hotels, including Hotel Negresco in Nice, the Mena House in Cairo, and King David Hotel in Jerusalem.
The Leading Hotels of the World started as a reservation service for independent hotels and is now a full-service hotel consortium which supports sales and marketing, advertising and public relations, financial services, quality control, and hotel inspections for its member properties.[tpl]cite book| last1=Fyall| first1=Alan| last2=Garrod| first2=Brian| title=Tourism Marketing: A Collaborative Approach| year=2004|publisher=Channel View Publications| isbn=978-1-873150-89-4| accessdate=31 July 2011| url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lY1xFcp9mgIC&pg=PA270#v=onepage&q&f=false| page=270[/tpl] It is not a hotel chain itself; its member hotels are typically independents, though some are themselves individual properties that are part of chains.
[tpl]As of|2011[/tpl], Andrea Kracht, proprietor of Baur au Lac in Zurich, Switzerland, is the chairman of Hotel Representative, A.G., and Theodore (Ted) Teng is the president and chief executive officer.[tpl]cite book| last1=Corgel| first1=Jack B.| last2=Sturman| first2=Michael C.| last3=Verma| first3=Rohit| title=The Cornell School of Hotel Administration on Hospitality: Cutting Edge Thinking and Practice| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1MZBiRbQBF0C&pg=PA15| accessdate=4 June 2011| date=26 April 2011| publisher=John Wiley and Sons| isbn=978-0-470-55499-9| page=15[/tpl] It currently maintains a network of 24 offices around the world.
In March 2013, it launched a new website[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lhw.com/ |title=lhw.com |publisher=lhw.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-09[/tpl] that is part of a new digital strategy, and is an aggregation and distribution point for the companyâ€™s hotel inventory, as well as educational and other content.
