[[Amyand's hernia]]

CATEGORIES: Inguinal hernias

Amyand's hernia is a rare form of inguinal hernia (less than 1%) which occurs when the appendix is included in the hernial sac and becomes incarcerated. The condition is an eponymous disease named after an English surgeon, Claudius Amyand (1680-1740), who performed the first successful appendectomy in 1735.
Amyand's hernia is commonly misdiagnosed as an ordinary incarcerated hernia. Symptoms mimicking appendicitis may occur. Treatment consists of a combination of appendectomy and hernia repair.
