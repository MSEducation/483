Adam Robert Oates (born August 27, 1962) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and coach. He played 19 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Detroit Red Wings, St. Louis Blues, Boston Bruins, Washington Capitals, Philadelphia Flyers, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Edmonton Oilers. Known as an elite playmaker, his career total of 1,079 assists was the fifth highest total in NHL history at the time of his 2004 retirement. After retiring as a player, he served as an assistant coach for the Tampa Bay Lightning and New Jersey Devils prior to joining the Capitals as their head coach for two seasons between 2012 and 2014.
As a college player, Oates was a standout forward for the RPI Engineers. He set single-season school records for assists and points and was named an Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) all-star and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) All-American in both 1984 and 1985. He was named a tournament all-star in helping RPI win the 1985 national championship, and in 1990–91, the NHL included him in its Second All-Star Team; he played in five All-Star Games.  He holds the record for most points all-time of any NHL player who also played NCAA Hockey.  Oates was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 12, 2012 along with Joe Sakic, Pavel Bure, and Mats Sundin.

An offensive standout, Oates' total of 181 points in 19 games in 1981 was the 11th highest total in OLA junior history at the time.[tpl]cite news |last=Tutka |first=Paul |url=http://www.ilindoor.com/2011/06/17/junior-a-scoring-chase-the-best-ever-and-this-years-top-provincial-point-producers/ |title=Junior ‘A’ scoring chase: The best ever and this year’s top provincial point producers |publisher=Inside Lacrosse Indoor |date=2011-06-17 |accessdate=2012-07-21[/tpl] As the league's leading scorer, he won the Bobby Allan Award and in one game that season, set OLA Junior A single-game records of 19 assists and 29 points. Oates played one season of Senior A with the Brampton Excelsiors of Major Series Lacrosse but left the game in 1984 to focus on his hockey career.
Describing his younger self as being a "punk", Oates said he partied frequently. He dropped out of high school to focus on hockey and ended up working as a gas station attendant at 19.[tpl]cite news |last=Alexander |first=Rachel |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-662924.html |title=With Oates, Capitals are in good hands; Center helps direct team back to playoffs |work=Washington Post |date=1998-04-11 |accessdate=2012-07-27[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] Oates played two full seasons and parts of a third with the Junior A Markham Waxers of the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League (OPJAHL).  He scored 89 points in 43 games during 1980–81, and 159 points – including 105 assists – in 1981–82. He went unselected in the NHL Entry Draft, however, as scouts considered him too slow to play in the National Hockey League (NHL).[tpl]cite news |last=Singelais |first=Mark |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-157304663.html |title=Murley hopes for first in NHL draft |work=Albany Times Union |date=1999-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-27[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] He returned to high school to complete his diploma when he was recruited to play for Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).

==Playing career==

===College===

RPI's assistant coach Paul Allen noticed Oates during a 1982 OPJAHL game while scouting a different player and offered him a position on the school's team.[tpl]cite news |last=Marrapese |first=Nancy L. |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8729013.html |title=Oates earned degree of excellence at RPI |work=Boston Globe |date=1992-02-09 |accessdate=2012-07-21[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] Consequently, Oates played three seasons with the RPI Engineers, leading the team in assists each year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rpiathletics.com/hof.aspx?hof=168 |title=Hall of Fame – Adam Oates |publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute |accessdate=2012-07-25[/tpl]  After scoring 42 points in 22 games in his freshman season of 1982–83, he spent the summer working with a skating instructor to improve his foot speed. In 1983–84, he set school records in points with 83 and assists with 57.  He was named to the East Coast Athletic Conference (ECAC) second all-star team and became the first RPI hockey player to earn a berth on the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) All-American team since 1965.
In 1984–85, Oates broke his own school records by recording 60 assists and 91 points.

===Detroit and St. Louis===

NHL teams took interest in Oates following his junior season; at least five teams attempted to sign him. Choosing to forgo his final year of college eligibility, Oates signed a four-year, $1.1 million contract with the Detroit Red Wings that made him the highest paid rookie in the NHL in 1985–86.[tpl]cite news |last=Kane |first=Mike |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ChQhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=g3IFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3216,4123754 |title=Oates hopes to pay Detroit dividend on investment |work=Schenectady Gazette |date=1986-09-18 |accessdate=2012-07-25 |page=34[/tpl] He made his NHL debut on October 10, 1985, against the Minnesota North Stars, scoring his first goal that night on goaltender Don Beaupre and added an assist.[tpl]cite book |editor-last=McGowan |editor-first=Andy |title=2000–2001 Washington Capitals Media Guide |publisher=Washington Capitals Hockey Club |year=2000 |pages=36–39[/tpl] After this, Oates struggled offensively and was pointless in his following 16 games; the team subsequently demoted him to the Adirondack Red Wings of the American Hockey League (AHL).[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7CAyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=E6YFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5152,3195618 |title=Wings send down highly touted Oates |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1985-11-25 |accessdate=2012-07-25 |page=C7[/tpl] Oates split the remainder of the season between Detroit and Adirondack, finishing his first NHL season with 38 games played, 9 goals and 11 assists. In the AHL, he scored 18 goals and 28 assists in 34 games. Having finished the NHL season in Detroit, he was returned to Adirondack for the AHL playoffs which the team won to take the Calder Cup championship.
Oates established himself as a full-time NHLer in 1986–87, scoring 47 points in 76 games.  He improved to 54 points in 63 games the following year despite missing a month due to a groin injury,[tpl]cite news |last=Dougherty |first=Pete |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-158445792.html |title=Major demotion for two former RPI players |work=Albany Times Union |date=1988-01-06 |accessdate=2012-07-25[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] and finished third in team scoring with 78 points in 1988–89.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/DET/1989.html |title=1988–89 Detroit Red Wings |publisher=Sports Reference LLC |accessdate=2012-07-25[/tpl] However, Detroit made changes following a first round loss in the playoffs;[tpl]cite news |last=Khan |first=Ansar |url=http://www.mlive.com/redwings/index.ssf/2012/06/adam_oates_overcame_heartbreak.html |title=Adam Oates overcame 'heartbreaking' trade from Red Wings to become Hall-of-Famer |publisher=Mlive Media Group |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-25[/tpl] Oates, along with Paul MacLean, was traded to the St. Louis Blues on June 15, 1989, in exchange for veterans Bernie Federko and Tony McKegney.[tpl]cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-16/sports/sp-1962_1_bernie-federko-adam-oates-red-wings-get-federko |title=Red Wings Get Federko, McKegney for Oates, MacLean |work=Los Angeles Times |date=1989-06-16 |accessdate=2012-07-25[/tpl] The deal, which is now considered one of the worst in Red Wings' history, left Oates "heartbroken" to leave his first NHL club.
The Blues made Oates their first-line centre and played him alongside Brett Hull.  The pair, dubbed "Hull and Oates" as a play on the band Hall and Oates, put up prolific offensive numbers.[tpl]cite news |last=Rutherford |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.stltoday.com/sports/hockey/professional/28e8faca-0a66-5f52-99d8-e4d151a9ccb7.html |title=Oates finally joins Hull in Hall of Fame |work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |date=2012-06-27 |accessdate=2012-07-25[/tpl] In 1989–90, Oates topped the 100-point mark for the first time in his career with 102 points.

Oates signed a four-year, $3 million contract extension with the Blues prior to the 1991–92 NHL season, but after the team signed Brendan Shanahan, Garth Butcher and Ron Sutter to significant deals, felt he was underpaid.[tpl]cite news |last=Dellapina |first=John |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-22618460.html |title=Oates' threat sets off quaking in St. Louis |work=The Record (Bergen County, NJ) |date=1992-01-20 |accessdate=2012-07-25[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] After playing in his second career All-Star Game, he threatened to walk off the team following the all-star break if the Blues did not renegotiate his contract, prompting a negative reaction from St. Louis fans who booed him loudly. The conflict was resolved on February 7, 1992, when the team dealt him to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Craig Janney and Stéphane Quintal.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4094997.html |title=Blues deal Oates to Bruins |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=1992-02-08 |accessdate=2012-07-25[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl]

===Boston and Washington===

Oates' best individual season came in his first full year in Boston.  He led the league with 97 assists in 1992–93 and finished third in overall scoring with 142 points.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hockey-reference.com/players/o/oatesad01.html |title=Adam Oates statistics |publisher=Sports Reference LLC |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl] At the 1993 All-Star Game, Oates set a record by recording four assists in one period as part of a 16–6 victory for the Wales Conference. Oates played in his fourth consecutive All-Star Game in 1994 and again finished third in league scoring with 112 points in 1993–94. In a five-year period between 1989 and 1994, Oates was the second highest point producer in the NHL. His average of 114 points per season over that time was second to Wayne Gretzky's 124.[tpl]cite news |last=Marrapese |first=Nancy L. |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8296522.html |title=A one-man production Oates is still thriving despite winging it |work=Boston Globe |date=1994-09-17 |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl]
A finger injury suffered during the 1994 Stanley Cup Playoffs hampered Oates throughout 1994–95 and required surgery at the season's conclusion.[tpl]cite news |last=Marrapese |first=Nancy L. |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8329537.html |title=Oates undergoes surgery on finger |work=Boston Globe |date=1995-05-27 |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] Despite the injury, Oates finished fourth in the NHL with 41 assists in a season disrupted by a work stoppage. The Bruins signed him to a five-year, $10 million contract extension late in that season,[tpl]cite news |last=Marrapese |first=Nancy L. |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8323419.html |title=Oates takes 5-year, $10m deal |work=Boston Globe |date=1995-04-12 |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] but Oates once again became frustrated with his salary relative to the rest of the league by 1997.  With the Bruins struggling on the ice and out of playoff contention late in 1996–97 season, Oates publicly berated team management: "You go on a road trip and everyone says it's a big trip. For what? So we can win five games because we're lousy and we get in the eighth spot and lose four straight and get embarrassed and then get shelled all summer? It's upstairs, baby. That's their job, not ours. ... Are we rebuilding? What are we doing?

Less than two weeks after his tirade, on March 1, 1997, the Bruins dealt him to the Washington Capitals.  In the trade, Oates, Bill Ranford and Rick Tocchet went to Washington in exchange for Jim Carey, Anson Carter, Jason Allison and a draft pick. Oates initially refused to report to Washington, demanding that his contract be renegotiated, but chose to join the team after a four-day holdout.[tpl]cite news |last=Alexander |first=Rachel |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-707672.html |title=Oates ends holdout, joins Capitals; new player will wait until offseason before renegotiating contract |work=Washington Post |date=1997-05-05 |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] He continued to demand a new contract in the offseason, while his agent claimed that Oates would retire before playing for the Capitals again.[tpl]cite news |last=Kornheiser |first=Tony |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-740123.html |title=Oates's agent is on a power play |work=Washington Post |date=1997-07-31 |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] After several months of contentious negotiations, the two sides agreed to a three-year deal worth around $2.9 million per season with an option on a fourth year.[tpl]cite news |last=Cotsonika |first=Nicholas J. |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-736255.html |title=With contract done, Oates pursues dual citizenship |work=Washington Post |date=1997-07-23 |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl]
Oates became the 47th player in NHL history, and the 15th fastest, to score his 1,000th career point on October 7, 1997 against the New York Islanders.  He reached the milestone by scoring a hat trick and adding two assists for the sixth five-point game of his career. He finished the 1997–98 season as the team leader with 56 assists, and second to Peter Bondra in team scoring with 78 points.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/WSH/1998.html |title=1997–98 Washington Capitals |publisher=Sports Reference LLC |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl] The Capitals reached the 1998 Stanley Cup Finals, which they lost to the Detroit Red Wings, the only finals appearance in franchise history.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/story/2012/06/26/sp-nhl-hockey-adam-oates-coach-washington-capitals.html |title=Capitals name Adam Oates head coach |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl]

On January 14, 2002, Oates became the eighth player in NHL history to reach 1,000 career assists when he set up Dainus Zubrus' overtime winning goal in a 1–0 victory over the Boston Bruins.[tpl]cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vhhVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JJQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6031,3297203 |title=Oates grabs 1,000th assist |work=Boca Raton News |date=2002-01-15 |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl]

===Philadelphia, Anaheim and Edmonton===

With Washington out of playoff contention late in the 2001–02 season and with his contract expiring following the season, the Capitals dealt Oates to the Philadelphia Flyers on March 19, 2002, in exchange for goaltender Maxime Ouellet and the Flyers' first, second and third round selections in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. The Flyers hoped that bringing Oates in would solidify their playoff chances.[tpl]cite news |last=Moran |first=Edward |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-120480106.html |title=Flyers acquire Adam Oates |work=Philadelphia Daily News |date=2002-03-20 |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl] The move did not work, as the Flyers were defeated in the first round by the lower ranked Ottawa Senators, losing the series in five games.  The team scored only one goal in regulation time and were shut out three times by Ottawa's Patrick Lalime.[tpl]cite news |last=Maaddi |first=Rob |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-52639280.html |title=Senators bump Flyers from playoffs |agency=Associated Press |date=2002-04-27 |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl]
The Flyers chose not to offer Oates a new contract following the loss, making him an unrestricted free agent.

It was Oates' ninth career playoff overtime point, tying him with Joe Sakic and Doug Gilmour for the NHL all-time lead.[tpl]cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/2003/playoffs/news/2003/05/31/finals_notebook_ap/ |title=Oates' clutch faceoff win led to Salei's game-winner |publisher=Sports Illustrated Online |date=2003-05-31 |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl] The Ducks ultimately lost the series in seven games.[tpl]cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/hockey/2003/playoffs/news/2003/06/09/ducks_devils_ap/ |title=Hell's Angels |publisher=Sports Illustrated Online |date=2003-06-09 |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl]
The Mighty Ducks declined their option on the 41-year-old Oates' contract, again making him a free agent. He remained unsigned six weeks into the 2003–04 season, until he agreed to a one-year contract with the Edmonton Oilers on November 17, 2003.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-157669488.html |title=Oates signs deal with Edmonton |work=Albany Times Union |date=2003-11-18  |accessdate=2012-07-26[/tpl][tpl]subscription required|via=Highbeam[/tpl]  He appeared in 60 games in Edmonton, scoring 2 goals and 16 assists.

Oates was one of the NHL's great playmakers, a style that he credits his father as encouraging: "It was just kind of our family talks: 'If you can be unselfish, your teammates will always like you.' And it just kind of became my role, where I was obviously trying to please my dad, growing up and becoming a playmaker out of that."[tpl]cite news |last=Fitz-Gerald |first=Sean |url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2012/06/26/here-is-your-hockey-hall-of-fame-class-of-2012/ |title=Here is the 2012 Hockey Hall of Fame class |work=National Post |location=Canada |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-21[/tpl] Oates' father, a British immigrant, idolized Stanley Matthews, considered one of the greatest soccer players of all time and hoped that his son would adopt a pass-first mentality similar to Matthews.
He led the NHL in assists three times – 1992–93, 2000–01 and 2001–02 – and finished in the top ten on 12 occasions. He is also the only player in NHL history to centre three 50-goal scorers, helping Brett Hull, Cam Neely and Peter Bondra reach the mark.  His teammates praised his consistency, noting that Oates continued to score points at an elite level when he did not have star players as linemates.  Boston teammate Raymond Bourque suggested in 1994 that Oates was underrated: "I think a lot of people take what he does for granted. He does it in a quiet way. He's not a flashy guy. He's not looking for attention, he just goes out and does it. He's the best centerman I've been around. I never knew he was this good playing against him because I didn't see him this much."
