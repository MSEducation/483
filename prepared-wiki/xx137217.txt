The work was one of the few surviving books of divination produced in that period of Chinese history. It contains 64 x 64 = 4096 hexagrams (I Ching contains 64); each of the hexagram is commented by a short poem (3-8 lines; each line comprises, in most cases, 4 characters). Besides its historical value, the work has also been treasured for its literary merit.
