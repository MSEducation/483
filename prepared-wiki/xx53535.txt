William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings KG (c. 1431 – 13 June 1483) was an English nobleman. A follower of the House of York, he became a close friend and one of the most important courtiers of King Edward IV, whom he served as Lord Chamberlain. He was executed on charges of treason by Edward's brother and ultimate successor, Richard III.

==Biography==

William Hastings, born about 1431, was the eldest son of Sir Leonard Hastings (c.1396 – 20 October 1455),and his wife Alice Camoys, daughter of Thomas de Camoys, 1st Baron Camoys.[tpl]sfn|Richardson I|2011|pp=398–9[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Richardson II|2011|pp=369–71[/tpl]

Hastings succeeded his father in service to the House of York and through this service became close to his distant cousin the future Edward IV, whom he was to serve loyally all his life. He was High Sheriff of Warwickshire and High Sheriff of Leicestershire in 1455.
He fought alongside Edward at the Battle of Mortimer's Cross and was present at the proclamation of Edward as king in London on 4 March 1461 and then when the new king secured his crown at the Battle of Towton shortly thereafter. He was knighted on the field of battle. With the establishment of the Yorkist regime, Hastings became one of the key figures in the realm, most importantly as Master of the Mint and Lord Chamberlain, an office he held for the duration of the reign and which made him one of the most important means of access to the king. He was also created Baron Hastings, a title reinforced by grants of land and office, primarily in Leicestershire and Northamptonshire. In 1462 he was invested as a Knight of the Garter. In 1474, he was awarded royal licence tocrenellate at three of his landholdings in Leicestershire; at Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Kirby, and at Bagworth. He built extensively at Ashby, mostly making additions to the pre-existing manor house built by the de la Zouch family in the thirteenth century. His greatest achievement at Ashby was, of course, the Hastings Tower – an imposing and thoroughly impressive creation. At Kirby Muxloe he began an intricate and beautiful fortified house of red brick, one of the first of its kind in the county. With massive gratitude to English Heritage, both castles at Ashby and Kirby can still be seen, but regrettably nothing survives to indicate any construction at Bagworth.
His importance in these years is recorded in a number of sources and was recognised by the greatest peer in the realm, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, who gave Hastings his widowed sister, Katherine Neville, in marriage. Katherine's first husband, William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington, had been killed at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, leaving her with a six-month old daughter, Cecily, who succeeded to the Bonville titles and estates.[tpl]sfn|Horrox|2004[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Richardson II|2011|p=371[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Nicolas|1826|pp=368–75[/tpl]
Despite this matrimonial relationship with the Nevilles, when Warwick drove Edward IV into exile in 1470, Hastings went with Edward and accompanied the king back the following spring.  Hastings raised troops for Edward in the English Midlands and served as one of the captains of the Yorkist forces at both Barnet and Tewkesbury.
His service, loyalty and ability, along with the fall of his Neville in-laws, meant that Hastings was an even more important figure during the second half of Edward IV's reign.  He continued to serve as chamberlain and was also appointed to be lieutenant of Calais, which made him an important player in foreign affairs, and he was given authority over an increasingly large section of the English Midlands. At court, he was involved in two lengthy feuds with members of Queen Elizabeth Woodville's family, most notably with her son Thomas Grey, first Marquess of Dorset.
After the death of Edward IV on 9 April 1483, Hastings proved a key figure in checking the dowager queen's attempt to monopolise political power for her family by appointing family members to key positions and rushing the coronation of her young son, Edward V as king, thereby circumventing Richard, Duke of Gloucester, whom the late king had appointed Lord Protector. Hastings, while keeping the Woodville's action at check in London, informed Richard of the proceedings and asked him to hasten to London. Richard intercepted the young king, who also was on his way to London, with his Woodville relatives. Hastings then supported Richard's formal installation as Lord Protector and collaborated with him in the royal council.
Affairs changed dramatically on 13 June 1483 during a council meeting at the Tower of London: Richard, supported by the Duke of Buckingham, accused Hastings and other council members, of having conspired against his life with the Woodvilles, with Hastings's mistress Jane Shore (formerly also mistress to Edward IV and Dorset), acting as a go-between. While other alleged conspirators were imprisoned, Hastings was immediately beheaded in the courtyard.
The execution of the popular Hastings was controversial among contemporaries and has been interpreted differently by historians and other authors: while the traditional account, harking back to authors of the Tudor period including William Shakespeare, considered the conspiracy charge invented and merely a ploy to remove Hastings, who was too formidable an obstacle to Richard's royal ambitions,For instance, Alison Weir, The Princes in the Tower, London: Random House, 1992. others have been more open to the possibility of such a conspiracy and that Richard merely reacted to secure his position.For instance, Paul Murray Kendall, Richard III. Some authors conceded the possibility of a conspiracy, but think it the result of Richard's grasp for the throne.
Richard did not issue an attainder against Hastings and his family. Hence his wife and sons were allowed to inherit his lands and properties; Hastings himself was buried in the north aisle of St George's Chapel, Windsor,[tpl]sfn|Cokayne|1926|p=373[/tpl] next to Edward IV.
