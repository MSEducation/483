CATEGORIES: Religious terminology, Statements of faith

A creed, confession, symbol, or statement of faith is a statement of the shared beliefs of a religious community. Creeds are not intended to be comprehensive, but to be a summary of core beliefs. The term "creed" can also refer to a person's political or social beliefs, or is sometimes used to mean religious affiliation.
One of the most widely used creeds in Christianity is the Nicene Creed, first formulated in AD 325 at the First Council of Nicaea. It was based on Christian understanding of the Canonical Gospels, the letters of the New Testament and to a lesser extent the Old Testament. Affirmation of this creed, which describes the Trinity, is generally taken as a fundamental test of orthodoxy for most Christian denominations.Johnson, Phillip R. "The Nicene Creed." Accessed 17 May 2009 The Apostles' Creed is also broadly accepted. Some Christian denominations and other groups have rejected the authority of those creeds.

Whether Judaism is creedal has been a point of some controversy. Although some say Judaism is noncreedal in nature, others say it recognizes a single creed, the Shema Yisrael, which begins: "Hear, O Israel: the LORD our God, the LORD is one."[tpl]bibleverse||Deut|6:4|HE[/tpl]

==Etymology==

The word derives from the Latin credo, which means "I believe" (because the Latin translation of the Apostles' Creed and the Nicene Creed both begin with this word) so a creed may also be called a credo. A creed is sometimes referred to as a symbol signifying a "token" by which persons of like beliefs might recognize each other.Justo L. Gonzalez, The Story of Christianity, 2nd ed., Vol. 1, p. 77.

==Terminology==

The word creed is particularly used for a concise statement which is recited as part of a religious service.
Some longer statements of faith in the Protestant tradition are instead called confessions of faith.
Within Evangelicalism, the terms doctrinal statement or doctrinal basis tend to be preferred. Doctrinal statements may include positions on lectionary and translations of the Bible, particularly in fundamentalist churches of the King James Only movement.

==Christian creeds==

Several creeds have originated in Christianity.

==Christian confessions of faith==

Protestant denominations are usually associated with confessions of faith, which are similar to creeds but usually longer.

==Christians without creeds==

Some Christian denominations, and particularly those descending from the Radical Reformation, do not profess a creed. The Quakers, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, believe that they have no need for creedal formulations of faith. The Church of the Brethren also espouses no creed, referring to the New Testament, as their "rule of faith and practice."Martin, Harold S.: "Forward", "Basic Beliefs Within the Church of the Brethren". Jehovah's Witnesses contrast "memorizing or repeating creeds" with acting to "do what Jesus said"."Creeds—Any Place in True Worship?", Awake!, October 8, 1985, ©Watch Tower, page 23, "The opening words of a creed invariably are, “I believe” or, “We believe.” This expression is translated from the Latin word “credo,” from which comes the word “creed.” ...What do we learn from Jesus’ words? That it is valueless in God’s eyes for one merely to repeat what one claims to believe. ...Thus, rather than memorizing or repeating creeds, we must do what Jesus said" Unitarian Universalists, who practice probably the most liberal of all religions, do not share a creed.Maxwell, Bill. "Leading the Unitarian Universalist Association, a faith without a creed." St. Petersburg Times. Apr 11, 2008
Many evangelical Protestants similarly reject creeds as definitive statements of faith, even while agreeing with some creeds' substance. The Baptists have been non-creedal "in that they have not sought to establish binding authoritative confessions of faith on one another".Avis, Paul (2002) The Christian Church: An Introduction to the Major Traditions, SPCK, London, ISBN 0-281-05246-8[tpl]rp|111[/tpl] While many Baptists are not opposed to the ancient creeds, they regard them as "not so final that they cannot be revised and re-expressed. At best, creeds have a penultimacy about them and, of themselves, could never be the basis of Christian fellowship".[tpl]rp|112[/tpl] Moreover, Baptist "confessions of faith" have often had a clause such as this from the First London (Particular) Baptist Confession (Revised edition, 1646):
Similar reservations about the use of creeds can be found in the Restoration Movement and its descendants, the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the Churches of Christ, and the Christian churches and churches of Christ.
Some religious leaders in traditional creedal Churches have also come to question the utility of creeds. Bishop John Shelby Spong, retired Episcopal Bishop of Newark, has written that dogmas and creeds were merely "a stage in our development" and "part of our religious childhood." In his book, Sins of the Scripture, Spong claims that "Jesus seemed to understand that no one can finally fit the holy God into his or her creeds or doctrines. That is idolatry."p. 227

==Latter Day Saints==

Within the sects of the Latter Day Saint movement, the Articles of Faith are a list composed by Joseph Smith as part of an 1842 letter sent to "Long" John Wentworth, editor of the Chicago Democrat. It is canonized with the Pearl of Great Price, part of the standard works of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

==Jewish creed==

Whether Judaism is creedal in character has generated some controversy. Rabbi Milton Steinberg wrote that "By its nature Judaism is averse to formal creeds which of necessity limit and restrain thought" and asserted in his book Basic Judaism (1947) that "Judaism has never arrived at a creed." The 1976 Centenary Platform of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, an organization of Reform rabbis, agrees that "Judaism emphasizes action rather than creed as the primary expression of a religious life."
Others,[tpl]who|date=January 2013[/tpl] however, characterize the Shema Yisrael[tpl]Bibleref2c|Deut.|6:4[/tpl] as a creedal statement in strict monotheism embodied in a single prayer: "Hear O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One" ([tpl]lang-he|שמע ישראל אדני אלהינו אדני אחד[/tpl]; transliterated Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad). 
A notable statement of Jewish principles of faith was drawn up by Maimonides as his 13 Principles of Faith."Maimonides' Principles: The Fundamentals of Jewish Faith", in The Aryeh Kaplan Anthology, Volume I, Mesorah Publications, 1994

==Islamic creed==

The Islamic creed is the Shahadah, the proclamation لا اله الا الله محمد رسول الله (lā ʾilāha ʾillà-llāh, muḥammadun rasūlu-llāh) – “There is no god but Allah; Muhammad is Allah's messenger.” Taking this creed is one of the five pillars of Islam.
