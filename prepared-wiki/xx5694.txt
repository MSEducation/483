Kentucky has an expansive park system which includes one national park, two National Recreation areas, two National Historic Parks, two national forests, two National Wildlife Refuges, 45 state parks, [tpl]convert|37696|acre|km2|0[/tpl] of state forest, and 82 Wildlife Management Areas.
Kentucky has been part of two of the most successful wildlife reintroduction projects in United States history. In the winter of 1997, the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources began to re-stock elk in the state's eastern counties, which had been extinct from the area for over 150 years. As of 2009, the herd had reached the project goal of 10,000 animals, making it the largest herd east of the Mississippi River.[tpl]cite web |url=http://fw.ky.gov/elkinfo.asp?lid=1653&NavPath=C117C147C301C547 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926064155/http://fw.ky.gov/elkinfo.asp?lid=1653&NavPath=C117C147C301C547 |archivedate=September 26, 2006 |title=Elk Restoration Update and Hunting Information |publisher=Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources |accessdate=December 9, 2006[/tpl]
The state also stocked wild turkeys in the 1950s. Once extinct here, more wild turkeys thrive in Kentucky today than in any other eastern state.

==History==

What is now Kentucky was inhabited by varying cultures of Native Americans from at least 1000 BC to about AD 1650, particularly along the waterways and in areas of game. Bison roamed in the region. By the time that European and colonial explorers and settlers began entering Kentucky in greater number in the mid-18th century, there were no major Native American settlements in the region. The Iroquois had controlled much of the Ohio River valley for hunting from their bases in what is now New York.
The Shawnee from the northwest  and Cherokee from the south also sent parties into the area regularly for hunting. As more settlers entered the area, warfare broke out because the American Indians considered the settlers to be encroaching on their traditional hunting grounds.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.merceronline.com/Native/native01.htm |title=The Presence |publisher=Mercer County Online |accessdate=November 29, 2006 |work=History of Native Americans in Central Kentucky [/tpl] Today there are two state recognized tribes in Kentucky, the Southern Cherokee Nation of Kentucky and the Ridgetop Shawnee.Metts, Tara.The-Caring-Difference-Newsletter"National Indian Child Welfare Association (NICWA) and its implications in Kentucky", Summer 2010, Vol. 9, No. 2, p. 4, www.scibd.com.

Ten constitutional conventions were held in the Constitution Square Courthouse in Danville between 1784 and 1792. In 1790, Kentucky's delegates accepted Virginia's terms of separation, and a state constitution was drafted at the final convention in April 1792. On June 1, 1792, Kentucky became the fifteenth state to be admitted to the union.

===19th century===

Central Kentucky, the Bluegrass region, was the center of the greatest slaveholding, as planters cultivated tobacco and hemp, and also were noted for their quality livestock.  During the 19th century, Kentucky slaveholders began to sell surplus slaves to the Deep South, with Louisville becoming a major slave market and departure port for slaves being transported downriver.

===20th century===

The Black Patch Tobacco Wars, a vigilante action, occurred in the area in the early 20th century. As result of the tobacco industry monopoly, tobacco farmers in the area were forced to sell their tobacco at low prices. Many local farmers and activists united to refuse to sell tobacco to the tobacco industry.
A vigilante wing, the "Night Riders", terrorized farmers who sold their tobacco at the low prices demanded by the tobacco corporations. They burned several tobacco warehouses, notably in Hopkinsville and Princeton. In the later period of their operation, they were known to physically assault farmers who broke the boycott. The Governor declared martial law and deployed the Kentucky Militia to end the Black Patch Tobacco Wars.
On January 30, 1900, Governor William Goebel, flanked by two bodyguards, was mortally wounded by an assassin while walking to the State Capitol in downtown Frankfort. Goebel was contesting the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899, which William S. Taylor was initially believed to have won. For several months, J. C. W. Beckham, Goebel's running mate, and Taylor fought over who was the legal governor, until the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in May in favor of Beckham. After fleeing to Indiana, Taylor was indicted as a co-conspirator in Goebel's assassination. Goebel is the only governor of a U.S. state to have been assassinated while in office.[tpl]cite web | title=The Old State Capitol | publisher=Kentucky Historical Society | url=http://history.ky.gov/sub.php?pageid=23&sectionid=8 | accessdate=September 9, 2007 [/tpl]

==Law and government==

Kentucky is one of four U.S. states to officially use the term commonwealth. The term was used for Kentucky as it had also been used by Virginia, from which Kentucky was created. The term has no particular significance in its meaning and was chosen to emphasize the distinction from the status of royal colonies as a place governed for the general welfare of the populace.The Commonwealth of Kentucky, Kentucky Atlas & Gazeteer, University of Kentucky website.
The commonwealth term was used in citizen petitions submitted between 1786 and 1792 for the creation of the state.[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] It was also used in the title of a history of the state that was published in 1834 and was used in various places within that book in references to Virginia and Kentucky.Butler, Mann, A History of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Wilcox, Dickerman & Co., 1834. The other two states officially called "commonwealths" are Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.
Kentucky is one of only five states that elects its state officials in odd-numbered years (the others being Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, and Virginia). Kentucky holds elections for these offices every 4 years in the years preceding Presidential election years. Thus, Kentucky held gubernatorial elections in 2003, 2007, and 2011.

===Executive branch===

The executive branch is headed by the governor who serves as both head of state and head of government. The lieutenant governor may or may not have executive authority depending on whether the person is a member of the Governor's cabinet. Under the current Kentucky Constitution, the lieutenant governor assumes the duties of the governor only if the governor is incapacitated. (Prior to 1992, the lieutenant governor assumed power any time the governor was out of the state.) The governor and lieutenant governor usually run on a single ticket (also per a 1992 constitutional amendment), and are elected to four-year terms. Currently, the governor and lieutenant governor are Democrats Steve Beshear and Jerry Abramson.
Other elected constitutional offices include the Secretary of State, Attorney General, Auditor of Public Accounts, State Treasurer and Commissioner of Agriculture. Currently, Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes serves as the Secretary of State. The commonwealth's chief prosecutor, law enforcement officer, and law officer is the Attorney General, currently Democrat Jack Conway. The Auditor of Public Accounts is Democrat Crit Luallen. Democrat Todd Hollenbach is the current Treasurer. Republican James Comer is the current Commissioner of Agriculture.

===Legislative branch===

Kentucky's legislative branch consists of a bicameral body known as the Kentucky General Assembly.
The Senate is considered the upper house. It has 38 members, and is led by the President of the Senate, currently Republican Robert Stivers. Previous holder of the office, Republican David L. Williams, resigned from the Senate to accept a circuit court judgeship.
The House of Representatives has 100 members, and is led by the Speaker of the House, currently Democrat Greg Stumbo.

===Judicial branch===

The judicial branch of Kentucky is called the Kentucky Court of Justice and comprises courts of limited jurisdiction called District Courts; courts of general jurisdiction called Circuit Courts; specialty courts such as Drug Court, Family Court; an intermediate appellate court, the Kentucky Court of Appeals; and a court of last resort, the Kentucky Supreme Court.
The Kentucky Court of Justice is headed by the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth.
Unlike federal judges, who are usually appointed, justices serving on Kentucky state courts are chosen by the state's populace in non-partisan elections.

===Federal representation===

Kentucky's two U.S. Senators are Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, both Republicans. The state is divided into six Congressional Districts, represented by Republicans Ed Whitfield (1st), Brett Guthrie (2nd), Thomas Massie (4th), Hal Rogers (5th) and Andy Barr (6th) and Democrat John Yarmuth (3rd).
In the federal judiciary, Kentucky is served by two United States district courts: the Eastern District of Kentucky, with its primary seat in Lexington, and the Western District of Kentucky, with its primary seat in Louisville. Appeals are heard in the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, based in Cincinnati, Ohio.

===Law===

Kentucky's body of laws, known as the Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS), were enacted in 1942 to better organize and clarify the whole of Kentucky law.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statrev/revoff.htm |title=Reviser of Statutes Office — History and Functions |publisher=Kentucky Legislative Research Commission |accessdate=December 27, 2006[/tpl] The statutes are enforced by local police, sheriffs and deputy sheriffs, and constables and deputy constables. Unless they have completed a police academy elsewhere, these officers are required to complete training at the Kentucky Department of Criminal Justice Training Center on the campus of Eastern Kentucky University.[tpl]cite web |url=http://docjt.jus.state.ky.us/history.html |title=History of the DOCJT |publisher=Kentucky Department of Criminal Justice |accessdate=December 27, 2006[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2013[/tpl] Additionally, in 1948, the Kentucky General Assembly established the Kentucky State Police, making it the 38th state to create a force whose jurisdiction extends throughout the given state.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kentuckystatepolice.org/history.htm |title=History of the Kentucky State Police |publisher=Kentucky State Police |accessdate=December 27, 2006[/tpl]
Kentucky is one of the 32 states in the United States that sanctions the death penalty for certain heinous murders. Those convicted of capital crimes after March 31, 1998 are always executed by lethal injection; those convicted on or before this date may opt for the electric chair.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/methods-execution#state |title=Authorized Methods of Execution by State |publisher=Death Penalty Information Center |accessdate=December 28, 2006[/tpl] Only three people have been executed in Kentucky since the U.S. Supreme Court re-instituted the practice in 1976.

Kentucky has been on the front lines of the debate over displaying the Ten Commandments on public property. In the 2005 case of McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals that a display of the Ten Commandments in the Whitley City courthouse of McCreary County was unconstitutional.[tpl]cite web |url=http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1693.ZS.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616194116/http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1693.ZS.html |archivedate=June 16, 2009 |title=McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky |publisher=Cornell University Law School |accessdate=December 27, 2006[/tpl] Later that year, Judge Richard Fred Suhrheinrich, writing for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of ACLU of Kentucky v. Mercer County, wrote that a display including the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, the Ten Commandments, the Magna Carta, The Star-Spangled Banner, and the national motto could be erected in the Mercer County courthouse.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/05a0477p-06.pdf |format=PDF |title=Text of decision in ACLU of Kentucky v.

Kentucky has also been known to have unusually high political candidacy age laws, especially compared to surrounding states. The origin of this is unknown, but it has been suggested it has to do with the commonwealth tradition.

===Politics===

Where politics are concerned, Kentucky historically has been very hard-fought and leaned slightly toward the Democratic Party, although it was never included among the "Solid South". In 2006, 57.05% of the state's voters were officially registered as Democrats, 36.55% registered Republican, and 6.39% registered with some other political party.[tpl]cite web |url=http://kentucky.gov/Newsroom/sos/article61.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212043450/http://kentucky.gov/Newsroom/sos/article61.htm |archivedate=December 12, 2007 |title=2006 General Election Registration Figures Set |accessdate=November 30, 2006 |date=October 19, 2006 |publisher=Kentucky Secretary of State[/tpl] Despite this, the state often supports Republican candidates for federal offices.
From 1964 through 2004, Kentucky voted for the eventual winner of the election for President of the United States. In the 2008 election, however, the state lost its bellwether status when John McCain, who won Kentucky, lost the national popular and electoral vote to Barack Obama (McCain carried Kentucky 57 to 41%).
The Commonwealth supported the previous three Democratic candidates elected to the White House, all elected from Southern states: Lyndon B. Johnson (Texas) in 1964, Jimmy Carter (Georgia) in 1976, and Bill Clinton (Arkansas) in 1992 and 1996. In presidential elections, the state has become a Republican stronghold, supporting that party's presidential candidates by double-digit margins in 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012.

==Demographics==

The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Kentucky was 4,395,295 on July 1, 2013, a 1.3% increase since the 2010 United States Census.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/state/totals/2013/tables/NST-EST2013-01.csv|title=Table 1.

As of July 1, 2012, Kentucky had an estimated population of 4,380,415, which is an increase of 11,059, or 0.3%, from the prior year and an increase of 41,058, or 0.9%, since the year 2010. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 77,156 people (that is 287,222 births minus 210,066 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 59,604 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 27,435 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 32,169 people. As of 2004, Kentucky's population included about 95,000 foreign-born persons (2.3%). The population density of the state is 101.7 people per square mile.[tpl]cite book |title=The New York Times 2008 Almanac |editor=John W. Wright |year=2007 |page=178[/tpl]
Kentucky's total population has grown during every decade since records began. However, during most decades of the 20th century there was also net out-migration from Kentucky. Since 1900, rural Kentucky counties have experienced a net loss of over 1 million people from migration, while urban areas have experienced a slight net gain.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.kltprc.net/books/exploring/Chpt_3.htm| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090327130302/http://www.kltprc.net/books/exploring/Chpt_3.htm| archivedate = March 27, 2009 | title = Migration in Kentucky: Will the Circle Be Unbroken?| accessdate = April 30, 2007| last = Price| first = Michael| work = Exploring the Frontier of the Future: How Kentucky Will Live, Learn and Work| publisher = University of Louisville| pages = 5–10[/tpl]

===Race and ancestry===

The largest ancestries in the commonwealth are: English (30.6%), German (12.7%), Irish (10.5%), and African (7.8%).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/popInfo.php?locIndex=18 |title=Kentucky – Population overview |publisher=Epodunk.com |accessdate=December 7, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=18 |title=Kentucky, Kentucky State Information |publisher=ePodunk |accessdate=December 7, 2011[/tpl] In the state's most urban counties of Jefferson, Oldham, Fayette, Boone, Kenton, and Campbell, German is the largest reported ancestry.  Americans of Scots-Irish and English stock are present throughout the entire state.  Many claim Irish ancestry because of known "Scots-Irish" among their ancestors, who were descendants of immigrants from Scotland, via some years in Ireland. Southeastern Kentucky was populated by a large group of multi-racial settlers, sometimes called Melungeons, in the early 19th century.
Groups such as the Ridgetop Shawnee in the early 21st century organised as a non-profit to increase awareness of Native Americans in Kentucky. In the 2000 census, there were 20,000 people in the state who identified as Native American (0.49%).  In June 2011, Jerry “2 Feather” Thornton, a Cherokee, led a team in the Voyage of Native American Awareness 2011 canoe journey, to begin on the Green River in Rochester, Kentucky and  travel through to the Ohio River at Henderson.Vincent Schilling, "A Canoe Voyage to Increase Cultural Understanding", Indian Country Today, May 19, 2011, accessed January 16, 2012
African Americans, who made up 25% of Kentucky's population prior to the Civil War, primarily in the Bluegrass region, declined in number during the 20th century. Many migrated to the industrial North and Midwest in the Great Migration for jobs. Today, less than 8% of the state's total population is African American, and it is highly urbanized, concentrated near Louisville. 52% of the state's African-American population is in the Louisville Metro Area; 44.2% is in Jefferson County. The county had a population that is 20% African American. Other areas with high concentrations, beside Christian and Fulton counties and the Bluegrass region, are the cities of Paducah and Lexington. Some mining communities in far Southeastern Kentucky have populations that are between five and 10 percent African American.

===Religion===

As of 2010, the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA)[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/s/21/rcms2010_21_state_adh_2010.asp |title=The Association of Religion Data Archives | State Membership Report |publisher=www.thearda.com |accessdate=November 15, 2013[/tpl] reported the following groupings of Kentucky's 4,339,367 residents:
Kentucky is home to several seminaries. Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville is the principal seminary for the Southern Baptist Convention. Louisville is also the home of the Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, an institution of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). Lexington has two seminaries, Lexington Theological Seminary (affiliated with the Disciples of Christ), and the Baptist Seminary of Kentucky. Asbury Theological Seminary, a multi-denominational seminary in the Methodist tradition, is located in nearby Wilmore.
In addition to seminaries, there are several colleges affiliated with denominations:
Louisville is home to the headquarters of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and their printing press. Louisville also has Muslim,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_101_150/muslims_in_louisville.htm |title=Muslims in Louisville |publisher=Irfi.org |accessdate=December 7, 2011[/tpl] Jewish, and Hindu communities.

==Economy==

Early in its history Kentucky gained recognition for its excellent farming conditions. It was the site of the first commercial winery in the United States (started in present day Jessamine County in 1799) and due to the high calcium content of the soil in the Bluegrass region quickly became a major horse breeding (and later racing) area. Today Kentucky ranks 5th nationally in goat farming, 8th in beef cattle production, and 14th in corn production.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.econedlink.org/lessons/EM453/docs/em453_Corn_Production_Det_Answers.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605025350/http://www.econedlink.org/lessons/EM453/docs/em453_Corn_Production_Det_Answers.pdf |archivedate=June 5, 2007 |title=Corn Production Detective |publisher=National Council on Economic Education |format=PDF |accessdate=May 3, 2007[/tpl]
Today Kentucky's economy has expanded to importance in non agricultural terms as well, especially in auto manufacturing, energy fuel production, and medical facilities. As of 2010 24% of electricity produced in the USA depended on either enriched uranium rods coming from the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (the only domestic site of low grade uranium enrichment), or from the 107,336 tons of coal extracted from the state's two coal fields (which combined produce 4% percent of the electricity in the United States).[tpl]cite web|url=http://geology.utah.gov/emp/energydata/statistics/coal2.0/pdf/T2.7.pdf |title=Utah Geological Survey – U.S. Coal Production by State, 1994–2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=December 7, 2011[/tpl]

===Taxation===

There are 6 income tax brackets, ranging from 2% to 6% of personal income. The sales tax rate in Kentucky is 6%. Kentucky has a broadly based classified property tax system. All classes of property, unless exempted by the Constitution, are taxed by the state, although at widely varying rates.[tpl]cite web| url = http://revenue.ky.gov/business/proptax.htm| title = Property Tax| accessdate = May 1, 2007| publisher = Kentucky Department of Revenue| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070403180310/http://revenue.ky.gov/business/proptax.htm| archivedate = April 3, 2007[/tpl]
Many of these classes are exempted from taxation by local government. Of the classes that are subject to local taxation, three have special rates set by the General Assembly, one by the Kentucky Supreme Court and the remaining classes are subject to the full local rate, which includes the tax rate set by the local taxing bodies plus all voted levies. Real property is assessed on 100% of the fair market value and property taxes are due by December 31. Once the primary source of state and local government revenue, property taxes now account for only about 6% of the Kentucky's annual General Fund revenues.[ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bankrate.com/yho/itax/edit/state/profiles/state_tax_Ky.asp |title= State Taxes – Kentucky – Overview|accessdate=May 1, 2007 |publisher=bankrate.com [/tpl]
[/ref]
Until January 1, 2006, Kentucky imposed a tax on intangible personal property held by a taxpayer on January 1 of each year. The Kentucky intangible tax was repealed under House Bill 272. Intangible property consisted of any property or investment which represents evidence of value or the right to value. Some types of intangible property included: bonds, notes, retail repurchase agreements, accounts receivable, trusts, enforceable contracts sale of real estate (land contracts), money in hand, money in safe deposit boxes, annuities, interests in estates, loans to stockholders, and commercial paper.

===Government-promoted slogans===

In December 2002, the Kentucky governor Paul Patton unveiled the state slogan "It's that friendly",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8598104/ns/us_news-weird_news/t/kentucky-frowns-smiley-license-plates/#.UXW--KJwiIQ |title=Kentucky frowns on smiley license plates - US news - Weird news |publisher=NBC News |date=July 16, 2005 |accessdate=July 10, 2013[/tpl] in hope of drawing more people into the state based on the idea of southern hospitality. This campaign was neither a failure nor a success.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] Though it was meant to embrace southern values, many Kentuckians rejected the slogan as cheesy and ineffective. It was quickly seen that the slogan did not encourage tourism as much as initially hoped for. So government decided to create a different slogan to embrace Kentucky as a whole while also encouraging more people to visit the Bluegrass.[tpl]cite web |url=http://kentucky.gov/Pages/unbridledspirit.aspx |title=Unbridled Spirit→Information |accessdate=May 1, 2007 |publisher=State of Kentucky[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=September 2012[/tpl]
To boost Kentucky's image, give it a consistent reach, and help it "stand out from the crowd", former Governor Ernie Fletcher launched a comprehensive branding campaign at some later point in time[tpl]when|date=September 2012[/tpl] with the hope of making the state's $12–14 million advertising budget more effective.[tpl]citation needed|date=September 2012[/tpl] The resulting "Unbridled Spirit" brand was the result of a $500,000 contract with New West, a Kentucky-based public relations advertising and marketing firm to develop a viable brand and tag line.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/02/business/02addes.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | title='Unbridled Spirit' Wins Kentucky Slogan Vote | date=December 2, 2004[/tpl] The Fletcher administration aggressively marketed the brand in both the public and private sectors. Since that time, the "Welcome to Kentucky" signs at border areas have an "Unbridled Spirit" symbol on them.

==Transportation==

===Roads===

Kentucky is served by six major interstate highways (I-75, I-71, I-64, I-65, I-24, I-69), nine parkways, and three bypasses and spurs. The parkways were originally toll roads, but on November 22, 2006, Governor Ernie Fletcher ended the toll charges on the William H. Natcher Parkway and the Audubon Parkway, the last two parkways in Kentucky to charge tolls for access.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kctcs.net/todaysnews/index.cfm?tn_date=2006-09-28#6693 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008233115/http://www.kctcs.net/todaysnews/index.cfm?tn_date=2006-09-28#6693 |archivedate=October 8, 2006 |title=Fletcher:Tolls to end November 22 |accessdate=May 1, 2007 |last=Stinnett |first=Chuck[/tpl] The related toll booths have been demolished.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.courierpress.com/news/2006/nov/22/onlookers-cheer-booth-destruction-at-ceremony/| title = Onlookers Cheer Booth Destruction at Ceremony| accessdate = August 10, 2007| last = Stinnett| first = Chuck| date = November 22, 2006| publisher = Courier Press[/tpl]
Ending the tolls some seven months ahead of schedule was generally agreed to have been a positive economic development for transportation in Kentucky. In June 2007, a law went into effect raising the speed limit on rural portions of Kentucky Interstates from [tpl]convert|65|to|70|mph[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20070626/NEWS01/706260437|publisher=Courier-Journal|title=Many new laws go on books today|author=Steitzer, Stephanie|date=June 26, 2007[/tpl]
Road tunnels include the interstate Cumberland Gap Tunnel and the rural Nada Tunnel.
Greyhound provides bus service to most major cities in the state.

===Rails===

Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Ashland, South Portsmouth, Maysville and Fulton. The Cardinal (trains 50 and 51) is the line that offers Amtrak service to Ashland, South Shore, Maysville and South Portsmouth. The City of New Orleans (trains 58 and 59) serve Fulton. The Northern Kentucky area is served by the Cardinal at the Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal. The Museum Center is just across the Ohio River in Cincinnati.
As of 2004, there were approximately [tpl]convert|2640|mi[/tpl] of railways in Kentucky, with about 65% of those being operated by CSX Transportation. Coal was by far the most common cargo, accounting for 76% of cargo loaded and 61% of cargo delivered.[ref][tpl]cite web |url= https://www.aar.org/aboutus/Pages/default.aspx |format=PDF|title= Railroad Service in Kentucky|accessdate=May 1, 2007 |last= |first= |authorlink= |work= |publisher= Association of American Railroads|pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl] Also, Norfolk Southern's main north-south line runs through central and southern Kentucky, starting in Cincinnati.

===Air===

Kentucky's primary airports include Louisville International Airport (Standiford Field (SDF)) of Louisville, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG) of Covington and Northern Kentucky, and Blue Grass Airport (LEX) in Lexington. Louisville International Airport is home to UPS's Worldport, its international air-sorting hub.[ref][tpl]cite web |url= http://www.flylouisville.com/about-the-airport/ |title= Fast Facts|accessdate=September 11, 2007 |last= |first= |authorlink= |work= |publisher=Louisville International Airport |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl]

On August 27, 2006, Kentucky's Blue Grass Airport in Lexington was the site of a crash that killed 47 passengers and 2 crew members aboard a Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet designated Comair Flight 191, or Delta Air Lines Flight 5191, sometimes mistakenly identified by the press as Comair Flight 5191.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/news/special_packages/crash/15378422.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105013158/http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/news/special_packages/crash/15378422.htm |archivedate=November 5, 2006 |title=Crash Kills 49 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=November 5, 2006 |accessdate=December 7, 2011[/tpl] The lone survivor was the flight's first officer, James Polehinke, who doctors determined to be brain damaged and unable to recall the crash at all.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/03/national/main2059120.shtml |title=Comair Crash Survivor Leaves Hospital |accessdate=May 1, 2007 |publisher=CBS | date=October 3, 2006[/tpl]

===Water===

As the state is bounded by two of the largest rivers in North America, water transportation has historically played a major role in Kentucky's economy. Louisville was a major port for steamships in the nineteenth century.  Today, most barge traffic on Kentucky waterways consists of coal that is shipped from both the Eastern and Western Coalfields, about half of which is used locally to power many power plants located directly off the Ohio River, with the rest being exported to other countries, most notably Japan.
Many of the largest ports in the United States are located in or adjacent to Kentucky, including:
As a state, Kentucky ranks 10th overall in port tonnage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/pdf/inlandport03f.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825064009/http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/pdf/inlandport03f.pdf |archivedate=August 25, 2009 |title=Top 20 Inland U.S. Ports for 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=December 7, 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/portton01.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502153836/http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/portton01.htm |archivedate=May 2, 2010 |title=CY 2001 Tonnage for Selected U.S. Ports by Port Tons |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=May 2, 2010 |accessdate=December 7, 2011[/tpl]
The only natural obstacle along the entire length of the Ohio River is the Falls of the Ohio, located just west of Downtown Louisville.

==Subdivisions and settlements==

===Counties===

Kentucky is subdivided into 120 counties, the largest being Pike County at [tpl]convert|787.6|sqmi|km2[/tpl], and the most populous being Jefferson County (which coincides with the Louisville Metro governmental area) with 741,096 residents as of 2010.Kentucky Counties, University of Kentucky
County government, under the Kentucky Constitution of 1891, is vested in the County Judge/Executive, (formerly called the County Judge) who serves as the executive head of the county, and a legislature called a Fiscal Court. Despite the unusual name, the Fiscal Court no longer has judicial functions.

===Consolidated city-county governments===

Kentucky's two most populous counties, Jefferson and Fayette, have their governments consolidated with the governments of their largest cities. Louisville-Jefferson County Government (Louisville Metro) and Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government (Lexington Metro) are unique in that their city councils and county Fiscal Court structures have been merged into a single entity with a single chief executive, the Metro Mayor and Urban County Mayor, respectively. Although the counties still exist as subdivisions of the state, in reference the names Louisville and Lexington are used to refer to the entire area coextensive with the former cities and counties. Somewhat incongruously, when entering Lexington-Fayette the highway signs read "Fayette County" while most signs leading into Louisville-Jefferson simply read "Welcome to Louisville Metro."

===Cities and towns===

The Metro Louisville government area has a 2010 population of 741,096. Under United States Census Bureau methodology, the population of Louisville was 566,503. The latter figure is the population of the so-called "balance"—the parts of Jefferson County that were either unincorporated or within the City of Louisville before the formation of the merged government in 2003. In 2010, the Louisville Combined Statistical Area (CSA) has a population of 1,451,564; including 1,061,031 in Kentucky, which is nearly one-fourth of the state's population. Since 2000, over one-third of the state's population growth has occurred in the Louisville CSA. In addition, the top 28 wealthiest places in Kentucky are in Jefferson County and seven of the 15 wealthiest counties in the state are located in the Louisville CSA.[tpl]cite web|url=http://ksdc.louisville.edu/ |title=Kentucky State Data Center |publisher=Ksdc.louisville.edu |accessdate=August 4, 2009[/tpl]
The second largest city is Lexington with a 2010 census population of 295,803 and its CSA, which includes the Frankfort and Richmond statistical areas, having a population of 687,173. The Northern Kentucky area (the seven Kentucky counties in the Cincinnati MSA) had a population of 425,483 in 2010. The metropolitan areas of Louisville, Lexington, and Northern Kentucky have a combined population of 2,173,687 as of 2010, which is 50.1% of the state's total population.
The two other fast growing urban areas in Kentucky are the Bowling Green area and the "Tri Cities Region" of southeastern Kentucky, comprising Somerset, London and Corbin.
Although only one town in the "Tri Cities", namely Somerset, currently has more than 12,000 people, the area has been experiencing heightened population and job growth since the 1990s. Growth has been especially rapid in Laurel County, which outgrew areas such as Scott and Jessamine counties around Lexington or Shelby and Nelson Counties around Louisville. London significantly grew in population in the 2000s, from 5,692 in 2000 to 7,993 in 2010. London also landed a Wal-Mart distribution center in 1997, bringing thousands of jobs to the community.
In northeast Kentucky, the greater Ashland area is an important transportation, manufacturing, and medical center. Iron and petroleum production, as well as the transport of coal by rail and barge, have been historical pillars of the region's economy. Due to a decline in the area's industrial base, Ashland has seen a sizable reduction in its population since 1990. The population of the area has since stabilized, however, with the medical service industry taking a greater role in the local economy. The Ashland area, including the counties of Boyd and Greenup, are part of the Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). As of the 2000 census, the MSA had a population of 288,649. More than 21,000 of those people (as of 2010) reside within the city limits of Ashland.
The largest county in Kentucky by area is Pike, which contains Pikeville and suburb Coal Run Village . The county and surrounding area is the most populated region in the state that is not part of a Micropolitan Statistical Area or a Metropolitan Statistical Area containing nearly 200,000 people in five counties: Floyd County, Martin County, Letcher County, and neighboring Mingo County, West Virginia. Pike County contains slightly over 68,000 people.
Only three U.S. states have capitals with smaller populations than Kentucky's Frankfort (pop. 25,527), those being Augusta, Maine (pop. 18,560), Pierre, South Dakota (pop. 13,876), and Montpelier, Vermont (pop. 8,035).

==Education==

Kentucky maintains eight public four-year universities. There are two general tiers: major research institutions (the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville) and regional universities, which encompasses the remaining 6 schools. The regional schools have specific target counties that many of their programs are targeted towards (such as Forestry at Eastern Kentucky University or Cave Management at Western Kentucky University), however most of their curriculum varies little from any other public university.
UK and UofL have the highest academic rankings and admissions standards although the regional schools aren't without their national recognized departments – examples being Western Kentucky University's nationally ranked Journalism Department or Morehead State University offering one of the nation's only Space Science degrees. UK is the flagship and land grant of the system and has agriculture extension services in every county. The two research schools split duties related to the medical field, UK handles all medical outreach programs in the eastern half of the state while UofL does all medical outreach in the state's western half.
The state's sixteen public two-year colleges have been governed by the Kentucky Community and Technical College System since the passage of the Postsecondary Education Improvement Act of 1997, commonly referred to as House Bill 1.[ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.lrc.ky.gov/recarch/97ss/HB1/bill.doc |title=Postsecondary Education Improvement Act of 1997 |accessdate=May 1, 2007 |last= |first= |authorlink= |work= |publisher=State of Kentucky |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= [/tpl]
[/ref] Prior to the passage of House Bill 1, most of these colleges were under the control of the University of Kentucky.
Transylvania University, located in Lexington, is the oldest university west of the Allegheny Mountains, founded in 1780. Transylvania is a liberal arts university, consistently ranked in the top tier in the country.
Berea College, located at the extreme southern edge of the Bluegrass below the Cumberland Plateau, was the first coeducational college in the South to admit both black and white students, doing so from its very establishment in 1855.[ref][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.diversityweb.org/digest/vol10no1/mendel.cfm |title=Berea College:Learning, Labor, and Service |accessdate=May 1, 2007 |publisher=Diversity Web [/tpl]

==Culture==

Although Kentucky's culture is generally considered to be Southern, it is unique in that it is also influenced by the Midwest and Southern Appalachia in certain areas of the state. The state is known for bourbon and whiskey distilling, tobacco, horse racing, and college basketball. Kentucky is more similar to the Upland South in terms of ancestry which is predominantly American.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf |title=Ancestry 2000: Census 2000 Brief |author=Brittingham, Angela & de la Cruz, G.

Nevertheless, during the 19th century, Kentucky did receive a substantial number of German immigrants, who settled mostly in the Midwest, along the Ohio River primarily in Louisville, Covington and Newport.[tpl]cite web|url=http://kygermanscw.yolasite.com/the-story.php |title=Kentucky's German Americans in the Civil War |publisher=Kygermanscw.yolasite.com |accessdate=July 2, 2010[/tpl] Only Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia have higher German ancestry percentages than Kentucky among Census-defined Southern states, although Kentucky's percentage is closer to Arkansas and Virginia's than the previously named state's percentages.  Scottish Americans, English Americans and Scotch-Irish Americans have heavily influenced Kentucky culture, and are present in every part of the state.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/maps/map.asp?state=101&variable=494 |title=2000 Census: Percent Reporting Any German Ancestry |accessdate=July 20, 2007[/tpl]
Kentucky was a slave state, and blacks once comprised over one-quarter of its population. However, it lacked the cotton plantation system and never had the same high percentage of African Americans as most other slave states. With less than 8% of its current population being black, Kentucky is rarely included in modern-day definitions of the Black Belt, despite a relatively significant rural African American population in the Central and Western areas of the state.
Kentucky adopted the Jim Crow system of racial segregation in most public spheres after the Civil War, but the state never disenfranchised African American citizens to the level of the Deep South states, and it peacefully integrated its schools after the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education verdict, later adopting the first state civil rights act in the South in 1966.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761554924_12/Kentucky.html |title=Civil Rights and Women's Rights |accessdate=July 20, 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257023200764917|archivedate=October 31, 2009|deadurl=yes[/tpl]

===Music===

The breadth of music in Kentucky is indeed wide, stretching from the Purchase to the eastern mountains.
Renfro Valley, Kentucky is home to Renfro Valley Entertainment Center and the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame and is known as "Kentucky's Country Music Capital," a designation given it by the Kentucky State Legislature in the late 1980s. The Renfro Valley Barn Dance was where Renfro Valley's musical heritage began, in 1939, and influential country music luminaries like Red Foley, Homer & Jethro, Lily May Ledford & the Original Coon Creek Girls, Martha Carson, and many others have performed as regular members of the shows there over the years. The Renfro Valley Gatherin' is today America's second oldest continually broadcast radio program of any kind. It is broadcast on local radio station WRVK and a syndicated network of nearly 200 other stations across the United States and Canada every week.
Contemporary Christian music star Steven Curtis Chapman is a Paducah native, and Rock and Roll Hall of Famers The Everly Brothers are closely connected with Muhlenberg County, where older brother Don was born. Merle Travis, Country & Western artist known for both his signature "Travis picking" guitar playing style, as well as his hit song "Sixteen Tons", was also born in Muhlenberg County. Kentucky was also home to Mildred and Patty Hill, the Louisville sisters credited with composing the tune to the ditty Happy Birthday to You in 1893; Loretta Lynn (Johnson County), Brian Littrell and Kevin Richardson of the Backstreet Boys, and Billy Ray Cyrus (Flatwoods).
However, its depth lies in its signature sound—Bluegrass music. Bill Monroe, "The Father of Bluegrass", was born in the small Ohio County town of Rosine, while Ricky Skaggs, Keith Whitley, David "Stringbean" Akeman, Louis Marshall "Grandpa" Jones, Sonny and Bobby Osborne, and Sam Bush (who has been compared to Monroe) all hail from Kentucky. The International Bluegrass Music Museum is located in Owensboro,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bluegrass-museum.org/general/home.php |title=International Bluegrass Music Museum |accessdate=November 30, 2006[/tpl] while the annual Festival of the Bluegrass is held in Lexington.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.festivalofthebluegrass.com/ |title=Festival of the Bluegrass Home Page |accessdate=November 30, 2006[/tpl]
Kentucky is also home to famed jazz musician and pioneer, Lionel Hampton (although this has been disputed in recent years).[tpl]cite news |last = Voce |first = Steve |title = Obituary: Lionel Hampton |publisher=The Independent |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20020902/ai_n12639955/pg_5 |date = September 2, 2002 |accessdate = June 3, 2007[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=August 2009[/tpl] Blues legend W.C. Handy and R&B singer Wilson Pickett also spent considerable time in Kentucky. The R&B group Midnight Star and Hip-Hop group Nappy Roots were both formed in Kentucky, as were country acts The Kentucky Headhunters, Montgomery Gentry and Halfway to Hazard, The Judds, as well as Dove Award-winning Christian groups Audio Adrenaline (rock) and Bride (metal). Heavy Rock band Black Stone Cherry hails from rural Edmonton, Indie rock band My Morning Jacket with lead singer and guitarist Jim James also originated out of Louisville, on the local independent music Scene. Rock bands Cage the Elephant, Sleeper Agent, and Morning Teleportation are also from Bowling Green. The bluegrass groups Driftwood and Kentucky Rain, along with Nick Lachey of the pop band 98 Degrees are also from Kentucky.
In eastern Kentucky, old-time music carries on the tradition of ancient ballads and reels developed in historical Appalachia.

===Cuisine===

Kentucky's cuisine is generally similar to traditional southern cooking, although in some areas of the state it can blend elements of both the South and Midwest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://southernfood.about.com/od/southernregionalfood/Southern_Recipes_and_Regional_Specialties.htm |title=Southern Recipes – Southern Food and Recipes |publisher=Southernfood.about.com |date=June 17, 2009 |accessdate=August 4, 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.iicaculinary.com/iica-ye2-sem1.htm#ac303 |title=International Institute of Culinary Arts |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106091226/www.iicaculinary.com/iica-curr.htm#ac303 |archivedate=January 6, 2008[/tpl] One original Kentucky dish is called the Hot Brown, a dish normally layered in this order: toasted bread, turkey, bacon, tomatoes and topped with mornay sauce. It was developed at the Brown Hotel in Louisville.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.brownhotel.com/dining/hot-brown.html |title=Hot Brown Recipe |publisher=Brown Hotel |accessdate=December 18, 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070823065032/http://www.brownhotel.com/dining/hot-brown.html| archivedate = August 23, 2007[/tpl] The Pendennis Club in Louisville is the birthplace of the Old Fashioned cocktail. Also, western Kentucky is known for its own regional style of barbecue.
Louisville is well known for its many boutique, locally owned restaurants including Jack Fry's, Ramsi's Cafe on the World (both on Bardstown Road), The English Grill, Mayan Cafe, Bistro Le Relais and Proof on Main Street.
Harland Sanders originated Kentucky Fried Chicken at his service station in North Corbin, though the first franchised KFC was located in South Salt Lake, Utah.Jenifer K. Nii (2004). "Colonel's landmark KFC is mashed". Deseret Morning News. http://www.deseretnews.com/article/595057690/Colonels-landmark-KFC-is-mashed.html. Retrieved on October 28, 2007.

===Sports===

Kentucky is the home of several sports teams such as Minor League Baseball's Triple-A Louisville Bats and Class A Lexington Legends and the Class A Bowling Green Hot Rods. They are also home to the Frontier Leagues Florence Freedom and several teams in the MCFL. The Lexington Horsemen and Louisville Fire of the now-defunct af2 had been interested in making a move up to the "major league" Arena Football League, but nothing has come of those plans.
The northern part of the state lies across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, which is home to a National Football League team, the Bengals, and a Major League Baseball team, the Reds. It is not uncommon for fans to park in the city of Newport and use the Newport Southbank Pedestrian Bridge, locally known as the "Purple People Bridge," to walk to these games in Cincinnati. Also, Georgetown College in Georgetown was the location for the Bengals' summer training camp, until it was announced in 2012 that the Bengals would no longer use the facilities.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bengalscamp.com |title=About the camp |publisher=BengalsCamp.com |accessdate=December 18, 2006[/tpl]
As in many states, especially those without major league professional sport teams, college athletics are very important. This is especially true of the state's three Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) programs, including the Kentucky Wildcats, the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers, and the Louisville Cardinals. The Wildcats, Hilltoppers, and Cardinals are among the most tradition-rich college men's basketball teams in the United States, combining for 11 National championships and 24 NCAA Final Fours; all three are high on the lists of total all-time wins, wins per season, and average wins per season.
The Kentucky Wildcats are particularly notable, leading all Division I programs in all-time wins, win percentage, NCAA tournament appearances, and being second only to UCLA in NCAA championships. Louisville has also stepped onto the football scene in recent years, including winning the 2007 Orange Bowl as well as the 2013 Allstate Sugar Bowl. Western Kentucky, the 2002 national champion in Division I-AA football (now Football Championship Subdivision (FCS)), completed its transition to Division I FBS football in 2009.
Ohio Valley Wrestling in Louisville was the primary location for training and rehab for WWE professional wrestlers from 2000 until February 2008, when WWE ended its relationship with OVW and moved all of its contracted talent to Florida Championship Wrestling (now known as NXT Wrestling). In November 2011, OVW became the primary developmental territory for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).
The NASCAR Sprint Cup Series has a race at the Kentucky Speedway in Sparta, Kentucky, which is within an hour driving distance from Cincinnati, Louisville and Lexington. The race is called the Quaker State 400. The NASCAR Nationwide Series and the Camping World Truck Series also race there.
