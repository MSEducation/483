R'lyeh is a fictional lost city that first appeared in the H. P. Lovecraft short story "The Call of Cthulhu", first published in Weird Tales in 1928. According to Lovecraft's short story, R'lyeh is  a sunken city in the South Pacific and the prison of the entity called Cthulhu.
R'lyeh is characterized by bizarre architecture likened to non-Euclidean geometry. Norwegian sailor Gustaf Johansen, the narrator of one of the tales in the short story, describes the accidental discovery of the city: "a coast-line of mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of earth's supreme terrorâ€”the nightmare corpse-city of R'lyeh...loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours".H. P. Lovecraft, "The Call of Cthulhu" (1928) The short story also asserts the premise that while currently trapped in R'lyeh, Cthulhu will eventually return, with worshipers often repeating the phrase Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn: "In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming".

Both locations are close to the Pacific pole of inaccessibility ([tpl]Coord|48|52.6|S|123|23.6|W|type:waterbody_region:XP_scale:30000000|name=Oceanic Pole of Inaccessibility[/tpl]), a point in the ocean farthest from any land mass.
In Lumley's Primal Land short story "The House of Cthulhu", the island is referred to as "Arlyeh".[tpl]cite book|last=Lumley|first=B.|title=The House of Cthulhu: Tales of the Primal Land, Volume 1|year=2007|publisher=Tor|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7653-1074-3|edition=1st trade pbk. ed.|accessdate=22 April 2012|page=87|chapter=The House of Cthulhu[/tpl]
Charles Stross's novella A Colder War implicitly locates R'lyeh in the Baltic Sea, describing Cthulhu as being "scraped from a nest in the drowned wreckage of a city on the Baltic floor".Stross, C. A Colder War (1997)
The Tsuburaya Productions Tokusatsu series Ultraman Tiga places R'lyeh in the South Pacific, and the series' antagonist, Gatanozoa (Who is directly based on Ghatanothoa) was born there.
