==History==

HIMSS was organized in 1961 as the Hospital Management Systems Society (HMSS), an independent, unincorporated, nonprofit association of individuals. The society was co-founded by Edward J. Gerner and Harold E. Smalley. In late 1961, the constitution of the HIMSS was drafted and approved, and in 1962, the first national convention was held in Baltimore. In 1963, the second national HIMSS convention was held in Chicago, and the following year the HIMSS national headquarters were moved there. In 1967, the Bylaws, Rules and Regulations of HIMSS were written and approved. By 1982, HIMSS had 15 affiliated chapters (14 in the US and 1 in Australia). In 1986, the HIMSS was renamed to include "Information" in the title. By 1996, membership had grown to 7,500. http://www.himss.org/content/files/HIMSS_HISTORY.pdf As of April, 2014, HIMSS has more than 52,000 individual members.  http://ww.himss.org/content/files/HIMSS_HISTORY.pdf Its annual conference was attended by more than 38,000 in Orlando, Florida. http://www.himss.org/News/NewsDetail.aspx?ItemNumber=28807&navItemNumber=17425
