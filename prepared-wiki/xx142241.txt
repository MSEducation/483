Dwight Nevil (born August 25, 1944) is an American professional golfer who played on the PGA Tour in the 1970s and later played on the Champions Tour.
Nevil was born in Altus, Oklahoma. He played on the PGA Tour full-time from 1971â€“1977. He never won an official PGA Tour event; however, among his dozen top-10 finishes were a pair of consecutive runner-up finishes in September 1973 at the Quad Cities Open and the B.C. Open respectively.  He won the unofficial Magnolia State Classic in 1973 and 1974, and is the only player ever to win this event in two straight years. His best finish in a major was T-53 at the 1974 PGA Championship.[tpl]cite web|title=Golf Major Championships|url=http://golfmajorchampionships.com/players?player=1187|accessdate=2008-02-11[/tpl] Poor health (irregular heartbeat) and the failed treatments that tried to correct it ruined his putting stroke and forced him to retire from the Tour before the 1978 season.[ref]
