The Amazing Jeckel Brothers is the fifth studio album by American hip hop group Insane Clown Posse, released on May 25, 1999, by Island Records, in association with Psychopathic Records. Recording sessions for the album took place from 1998 to 1999. The album is the fifth Joker's Card in the group's Dark Carnival mythology. The album's lyrics focus on the 9 circles of hell, and the morality of man as he is torn between righteousness and evil, describing the Jeckel Brothers as spirits who juggle fire balls, representing the sins committed during the mortal life of the dead. For your fate of the light or darkness.
The Amazing Jeckel Brothers was the second studio album Insane Clown Posse released by Island, and features a more hip hop-based sound, as opposed to the rock-oriented sound of its predecessor, The Great Milenko (1997). The Amazing Jeckel Brothers features guest appearances by rappers Ol' Dirty Bastard and Snoop Dogg, and additional contributions by The Jerky Boys and Twiztid. It debuted at number four on the Billboard charts and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

==Background==

After a tumultuous contract with Jive Records sub-label Battery in 1995, Insane Clown Posse (ICP) attempted to find a new record label. Manager Alex Abbiss negotiated a contract with the Walt Disney Company-owned label Hollywood Records, which reportedly paid US$1 million to purchase the Insane Clown Posse contract from Battery/Jive Records.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430332/19970703/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clowns Point The Finger At Disney |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=July 3, 1997 |publisher=MTV[/tpl]
After recording and releasing The Great Milenko, Insane Clown Posse was notified that Hollywood Records had deleted the album within hours of its release, despite having sold 18,000 copies and reaching #63 on the Billboard 200.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,288784,00.html |title=Review of The Great Milenko |accessdate=2008-05-08 |last=Browne |first=David |date=July 25, 1997 |publisher=Entertainment Weekly[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430331/19970704/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clown Posse Angry At Disney's Decision |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=July 4, 1997 |publisher=MTV[/tpl] It was later revealed that Disney was being criticized by the Southern Baptist Church.

In due time, labels such as Interscope Records wanted to sign the group, but Island Records' Chris Blackwell came to the group's rescue and agreed to release The Great Milenko as it was originally intended.Bruce (2003), p. 330–335. Thanks to the controversy, and additional promotion by Island, over one million copies of The Great Milenko had been sold by 1998,Bruce (2003), p. 414–433. and Insane Clown Posse was ready for the fifth Joker's Card, The Amazing Jeckel Brothers.
