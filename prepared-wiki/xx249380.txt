==History==

The band was formed in the 1984 by NY,NJ natives Jim Walters (vocals, guitar), Alex Totino (guitar, vocals), Phil Leopold von Trapp (bass guitar, vocals, and Lyle Hysen (drums), and relocated to New York, where they released their eponymous debut album on Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace! label in 1986.Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, ISBN 1-84195-335-0, p. 876 They subsequently signed to SST Records and released Jupiter Eye in 1987, which has been described as "quasi-hardcore that touched on MC5-like garage psychedelia". A third album, Triskaidekaphobe (which featured Wayne Kramer of MC5 on guitar), and the Marshmellow Conspiracy EP (which was withdrawn when it was discovered that the track "Song for Michael Jackson to $ell" was in fact an uncredited version of The Beatles' "Magical Mystery Tour", and later reissued without the track) followed in 1998 before they left SST.Robbins, Ira "Das Damen", Trouser Press, retrieved 9 January 2010 The band's next release was the 1989 album Mousetrap, on the Twin/Tone label. Von Trapp left to be replaced by David Motamed, and the band then moved on to City Slang for the live album Entertaining Friends, recorded at CBGB, and their final release was the High Anxiety mini-set in July 1991, co-released by City Slang and Sub Pop. 
Motamed later joined Cell.

==Musical style==

Ira Robbins of Trouser Press described the band's debut as "six badly mixed long songs that are noisy but fun". They mixed alternative rock with metal, psychedelic rock, and acid rock.Huey, Steve "Das Damen Biography", Allmusic, Macrovision Corporation, retrieved 9 January 2010
