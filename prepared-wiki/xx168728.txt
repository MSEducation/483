"In the Garden" is a spiritually inspired song written by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison and included on his 1986 album No Guru, No Method, No Teacher.

==Recording and composition==

The album version of the song was recorded in 1985 at Studio D at the Sausalito & Record Plant in Sausalito, California.Heylin, Can You Feel the Silence?, p. 525
The lyrics of "In the Garden" contain a line which gives the album its name: "No Guru, no method, no teacher/
Just you and I and nature/And the Father in the garden." Some of the words also fall back to Astral Weeks territory with mentions of "childlike visions", "into a trance" from the song, "Madame George" and "in the garden wet with rain" from "Sweet Thing".  
According to Morrison, the song is based upon a form of transcendental meditation, which takes about ten minutes before a person arrives at a degree of tranquility.Hinton, Celtic Crossroads, p. 255
Biographer Johnny Rogan has highlighted the song as one of the defining tracks of Morrison's career, comparing it with works such as "Into the Mystic", "Listen to the Lion", and "You Don't Pull No Punches, But You Don't Push the River". He also believes that "Morrison himself recognises 'In the Garden' as perhaps the key recording in the Eighties career."Rogan, No Surrender, p. 359
