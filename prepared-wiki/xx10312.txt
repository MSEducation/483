</ref> Diamond lies at the other end of the range with a refractive index as high as 2.42. Most plastics have refractive indices in the range from 1.3 to 1.7, but some [[high-refractive-index polymer]]s can have values as high as 1.76.<ref>Naoki Sadayori and Yuji Hotta "Polycarbodiimide having high index of refraction and production method thereof" [http://www.google.com/patents?vid=va2WAAAAEBAJ US patent 2004/0158021 A1] (2004)</ref>
For infrared light refractive indices can be considerably higher. Germanium is transparent in this region and has a refractive index of about 4, making it an important material for infrared optics.

===Refractive index below 1===

A widespread misconception is that since, according to the theory of relativity, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum, the refractive index cannot be lower than 1. This is erroneous since the refractive index measures the phase velocity of light, which does not carry information. The phase velocity is the speed at which the crests of the wave move and can be faster than the speed of light in vacuum, and thereby give a refractive index below 1. This can occur close to resonance frequencies, for absorbing media, in plasmas, and for x-rays. In the x-ray regime the refractive indices are lower than but very close to 1 (exceptions close to some resonance frequencies).[ref]

As an example, water has a refractive index of [tpl]val|0.99999974[/tpl] = 1 − [tpl]val|2.6|e=-7[/tpl] for x-ray radiation at a photon energy of [tpl]val|30|ul=keV[/tpl] (0.04 nm wavelength).

===Negative refractive index===

Recent research has also demonstrated the existence of materials with a negative refractive index, which can occur if permittivity and permeability have simultaneous negative values. This can be achieved with periodically constructed metamaterials. The resulting negative refraction (i.e., a reversal of Snell's law) offers the possibility of the superlens and other exotic phenomena.

==Microscopic explanation==

At the microscale, an electromagnetic wave's phase velocity is slowed in a material because the electric field creates a disturbance in the charges of each atom (primarily the electrons) proportional to the electric susceptibility of the medium. (Similarly, the magnetic field creates a disturbance proportional to the magnetic susceptibility.) As the electromagnetic fields oscillate in the wave, the charges in the material will be "shaken" back and forth at the same frequency.[ref]
