[[India-class submarine]]

CATEGORIES: Russian and Soviet navy submarine classes, Deep-submergence rescue vehicles

The Project 940 Lenok class (a type of salmon) (known in the West by its NATO reporting name India class) was a military submarine design of the Soviet Union. 
The submarines of this class were designed to function as mother ships for two Poseidon Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicles (DSRVs).
While India class boats have been seen going to the aid of Russian Submarines involved in accidents, they have also been observed working in support of Russian Spetsnaz operations. The boats had decompression chambers and medical facilities on board. Two vessels of this class were built for the Soviet Navy. Both were scrapped in the 1990s.
