[[Market failure]]

CATEGORIES: Market failure, Economic problems

Market failure is a concept within economic theory describing when the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not efficient. That is, there exists another conceivable outcome where a market participant may be made better-off without making someone else worse-off.  (The outcome is not Pareto optimal.)  Market failures can be viewed as scenarios where individuals' pursuit of pure self-interest leads to results that are not efficient – that can be improved upon from the societal point-of-view.John O. Ledyard (2008). "market failure,"  The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Ed.  Abstract.Paul Krugman and Robin Wells (2006). Economics, New York, Worth Publishers. The first known use of the term by economists was in 1958,[ref]Francis M. Bator (1958). "The Anatomy of Market Failure," Quarterly Journal of Economics, 72(3) pp. 351–379 (press +).
