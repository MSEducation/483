Ayr ([tpl]IPAc-en|ɛər[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-gd|Inbhir Àir[/tpl], "Mouth of the River Ayr") is a former Royal Burgh in Ayrshire, Scotland. Ayr was the county town of the wider county of Ayrshire until 1975. Ayr is now the administrative centre of South Ayrshire council area, which is the unitary local authority.

==History==

On April 26, 1315, the first Parliament of Scotland was held in Ayr by Robert The Bruce at St.John's Tower by the sea. It was once known as 'Inverair/Inverayr' and this usage is still retained in the Scottish Gaelic form of the name Inbhir Air.
Later, during Cromwellian times, the town was used as a base and fortress for some of his men. Cromwell built a huge wall around certain areas of the town, most of which can still be seen today. St John's Tower, in that area, was originally part of a massive church, but the church was knocked down, and the tower was used to practise on, and is now protected by the "Friends Of Saint Johns Tower" (FROST) residents of the "Fort Area" nearby.

==Governance==

The Westminster constituency of Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock is currently held by the Labour Party's Sandra Osborne who has been the Member of Parliament since the 5 May 2005 general election.[tpl]cite web|title=Sandra Osborne|url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/sandra-osborne/25393|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=30 December 2012[/tpl]  From 1950 to 1997 the former Westminster constituency of Ayr was a Conservative seat.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] The Member of Parliament for most of this period was George Younger, who represented the constituency from 1964 to 1992.[tpl]Chronology citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
In the Scottish Parliament, Ayr still exists as a constituency and has been represented by Conservative MSP John Scott since 2000.[tpl]cite web|title=John Scott MSP|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/msps/currentmsps/John-Scott-MSP.aspx|publisher=The Scottish Parliament|accessdate=30 December 2012[/tpl] Regional MSPs that represent the South of Scotland (including Ayr) are Claudia Beamish (Labour), Chic Brodie (Scottish National Party), Jim Hume (Liberal Democrats), Joan McAlpine (Scottish National Party), Aileen McLeod (Scottish National Party), Graeme Pearson (Labour) and Paul Wheelhouse (Scottish National Party).[tpl]cite web|title=Ayr - MSPs: Scottish Parliament|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/msps/con-ayr.aspx|publisher=Scottish Parliament|accessdate=30 December 2012[/tpl]
The elected Councillors representing Ayr on South Ayrshire Council are as follows:
As a former Royal Burgh, Ayr had a Provost as chief magistrate of the burgh council and the earliest recorded provost is Nicholas de Fynvyk. The title of provost was retained by Kyle and Carrick District Council and South Ayrshire council for their civic heads.[tpl]cite web|title=Provosts of Ayr|url=http://www.south-ayrshire.gov.uk/councillors/provost/provosts-of-ayr.aspx|publisher=South Ayrshire Council|accessdate=10 January 2013[/tpl] The role of provost is now apolitical and carries a number of duties including chairing meetings of the council, acting as civic head representing South Ayrshire Council, promotion of South Ayrshire Council and networking with various organisations such as local businesses.[tpl]cite web|title=Provost|url=http://www.south-ayrshire.gov.uk/councillors/provost/|publisher=South Ayrshire Council|accessdate=10 January 2013[/tpl]
A chain and robes are worn by the provost while undertaking their ceremonial duties. The provost's chain was donated in June 1897 by James McLennan who was a Glasgow wine and spirit merchant who was born in Coylton and lived in Ayr. The official provost's robes have been provided by the council since 11 June 1923. In addition, South Ayrshire Council erects lamp posts with the Royal Burgh Coat of Arms emblazoned on the diffusers outside the official resident of the provost - this has been undertaken since 1854.
Each newly elected provost enters their name into a Bible at the‘Kirkin ‘O The Council’ service at Ayr Auld Kirk after each council election. The Bible in which the names are entered was acquired by the Kirk during the Provostship of Hugh Miller (1841-1855). The names of the provosts entered into the Bible are as follows:-
The current provost is Labour Councillor Helen Moonie.

==Geography==

Ayr is a coastal town which lies on the mouth of the River Ayr. The river then flows out into the larger Firth of Clyde estuary. From the coast the Isle of Arran can be seen, and on a very clear day, the northern tip of Northern Ireland. It is within the region of Strathclyde. Much of the land in and around this area is very flat and low lying, used for rearing dairy cattle. Towards the south of Ayr however the land is higher than most areas in the county of Ayrshire, with e.g. the Brown Carrick Hill situated due South of Doonfoot. Ayr lies approximately 35 miles southwest of Glasgow.

==Climate==

The nearest official Met Office weather station to Ayr is Auchincruive, about 3 miles to the north-east of Ayr town centre.

The area experiences very cool summers and somewhat mild winters. The air is cooler during the summer due to its proximity to the sea as water has a major cooling effect on summer temperatures. During the winter months the reverse happens and the sea air has a major warming effect on the climate. The area rarely ever sees extremes due to the effects of sea air. Rainfall is generally plentiful throughout the year due to Atlantic weather systems sweeping in from the west. Compared with the rest of Scotland, the area rarely  sees much mist and fog. This is because the land is relatively flat and low lying and with the wind blowing across the flatter land, this generally hinders fog from developing widely. This has made Glasgow Prestwick International Airport particularly well known as one of the less fog-prone airports in Scotland. Snowfall is rare in this part of Scotland because of the mild sea air.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/sites/auchincruive.html |title=averages 1971-2000 |publisher=Met Office |date=2008-11-19 |accessdate=2009-06-09[/tpl]

==Economy==

Ayr's industry has flourished over the years mainly because of the River Ayr. Ships that were built on the mouth of the River Ayr in the eighteenth century improved Ayr's economy. From 1883 to 1901, 143 ships and barges were built on the Ayr by Samuel B Knight and the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company. Repair work on the Ayr ceased in 1960 when Ailsa moved its operations to Troon.
The North side of Ayr Harbour still operates as a commercial port today, mainly exporting coal, and extensive railway sidings still lead down from the main railway line near Newton-on-Ayr station.
In addition, the River Ayr and River Doon were used for the fishing of whitefish and salmon. These were then exported from Ayr Harbour.
Manufacturing of textiles such as carpets and lining was important to Ayr's economy until the factories closed in the 1970s. This caused mass unemployment in Ayr. Many of the old factories are still standing and can be seen on McCalls Avenue and Walker Road in Lochside, North Ayr, though many are derelict and unsafe. There was a large factory engaged in the production of fertilisers and other agricultural products. This has since closed, but parts of the old complex are sublet by local businesses.
Ayr has always been a hub for shopping in South Scotland with the first department store, Hourstons, opening in 1896. In the 1970s, Ayr flourished further with the opening of further stores including Marks and Spencers and Ayr's first shopping centre, the Kyle Centre (1988). Heathfield Retail park, an out-of-town retail park, opened in 1993 with shops such as Halfords and Homebase. Ayr Central Shopping Centre opened in March 2006 with shops such as Debenhams and H&M and underparking for 500 cars.
During the 19th and 20th centuries Ayr became a popular holiday resort. This was due to its fine sandy beach and its popularity was increased by the building of the rail link to Glasgow in 1840.[tpl]cite web|last=Lambert|first=Tim|title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF AYR, AYRSHIRE, SCOTLAND|url=http://www.localhistories.org/ayr.html|work=http://www.localhistories.org|accessdate=11 October 2011[/tpl]
