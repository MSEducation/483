CATEGORIES: 1996 albums, Glenn Hughes albums

Addiction is a studio album by former Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Trapeze vocalist/ bassist Glenn Hughes. It was released in 1996 on Zero Corporation, SPV and Shrapnel records and was Hughes’ fifth solo studio album.

==History==

Unlike 1994’s Feel, which had a lighter sound with definite pop, soul and funk influences, Addiction was a definite hard rock record, at times bordering on heavy metal. It is generally considered Hughes’ heaviest solo album, both musically and topically. Hughes describes the period of his life when he made the album as a dark one; various issues he was going through are addressed in the songs. Many of them focus on the drug addictions that marred Hughes’ life throughout the 80s http://www.glennhughes.com/discography.html.
Guitarist and songwriter Marc Bonilla had a major contribution on the album, performing, co-producing and co-writing nine of the ten songs. This is also Hughes’ first album to feature long-time guitarist and co-songwriter Joakim ‘JJ’ Marsh. Marsh (from Sweden) has played guitar on every subsequent Hughes solo album to date and has toured with him on many occasions.
The US version of the album was issued with three bonus live tracks; these consisted of two Trapeze songs; Way Back To The Bone (from You Are the Music...We're Just the Band) and Touch My Life (from Medusa) as well as the Deep Purple song You Fool No One (from Burn).
The track Talk About It was subsequently released as a single in the form on the Talk About It EP, a CD which included three previously unreleased live tracks.
