[[Modeling chocolate]]

CATEGORIES: Chocolate

Modeling chocolate is a chocolate paste made by melting chocolate and combining it with corn syrup, glucose syrup, or golden syrup. Primarily used by upscale cakemakers and p√¢tisseries to add decoration to cakes and pastries, modeling chocolate is formed into a variety of shapes and structures that cannot be easily accomplished with other softer edible materials such as buttercream frosting, marzipan, or fondant.  Modeling chocolate can be made from white, dark, semi-sweet, or milk chocolate.
