===Composition===

Like most of Saturn's moons, Hyperion's low density indicates that it is composed largely of water ice with only a small amount of rock. It is thought that Hyperion may be similar to a loosely accreted pile of rubble in its physical composition. However, unlike most of Saturn's moons, Hyperion has a low albedo (0.2â€“0.3), indicating that it is covered by at least a thin layer of dark material.  This may be material from Phoebe (which is much darker) that got past Iapetus. Hyperion is redder than Phoebe and closely matches the color of the dark material on Iapetus.
Hyperion has a porosity of about 0.46.

===Surface features===

Voyager 2 passed through the Saturn system but photographed Hyperion only from a distance. It discerned individual craters and an enormous ridge but was not able to make out the texture of the moon's surface. Early images from the Cassini orbiter suggested an unusual appearance, but it was not until Cassini's first targeted flyby of Hyperion on 25 September 2005 that the moon's oddness was revealed in full.
Hyperion's surface is covered with deep, sharp-edged craters that give it the appearance of a giant sponge. Dark material fills the bottom of each crater. The reddish substance contains long chains of carbon and hydrogen and appears very similar to material found on other Saturnian satellites, most notably Iapetus.
The latest analyses of data obtained by NASA's Cassini spacecraft during its flybys of Hyperion in 2005 and 2006 show that about 40 percent of the moon is empty space.  It was suggested in July 2007 that this porosity allows craters to remain nearly unchanged over the eons. The new analyses also confirmed that Hyperion is composed mostly of water ice with very little rock. "We find that water ice is the main constituent of the surface, but it's dirty water ice," said Dale Cruikshank, a researcher at the NASA Ames Research Center.

==Rotation==

The Voyager 2 images and subsequent ground-based photometry indicate that Hyperion's rotation is chaotic, that is, its axis of rotation wobbles so much that its orientation in space is unpredictable. Hyperion is the only moon in the Solar System known to rotate chaotically. It is also the only regular planetary natural satellite in the Solar System known not to be tidally locked.
Hyperion is unique among the large moons in that it is very irregularly shaped, has a fairly eccentric orbit, and is near a much larger moon, Titan. These factors combine to restrict the set of conditions under which a stable rotation is possible. The 3:4 orbital resonance between Titan and Hyperion may also make a chaotic rotation more likely. The fact that its rotation is not locked probably accounts for the relative uniformity of Hyperion's surface, in contrast to many of Saturn's other moons which have contrasting trailing and leading hemispheres.

==Exploration==

Hyperion has been imaged several times from moderate distances by the Cassini orbiter. The first close targeted fly-by occurred at a distance of [tpl]convert|500|km[/tpl] on 26 September 2005.  Cassini made another close approach to Hyperion on 25 August 2011. Cassini's next flyby occurred on 16 September 2011, when it passed at [tpl]convert|58000|km[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|title=Saturn's Odd Pockmarked Moon Revealed in New Photos|url=http://www.space.com/12774-saturn-moon-hyperion-cassini-flyby-photos.html|publisher=Space.com|accessdate=31 August 2011[/tpl]
