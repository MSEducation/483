[[Gulf of Suez]]

CATEGORIES: Gulfs of the Indian Ocean, Suez Canal, Suez Governorate, Red Sea

 
The northern end of the Red Sea bifurcates into the Sinai Peninsula, creating the Gulf of Suez ([tpl]lang-ar|خليج السويس[/tpl]; transliterated: Khalīǧ as-Suwais) in the west and the Gulf of Aqaba to the east.  The gulf is formed within a relatively young but now inactive Gulf of Suez Rift rift basin, dating back about 28 million years.http://geoinfo.amu.edu.pl/wpk/geos/GEO_2/GEO_PLATE_T-37.HTML Detailed geological information on the Gulf It stretches some [tpl]convert|300|km|mi[/tpl] north by northwest, terminating at the Egyptian city of Suez and the entrance to the Suez Canal. Along the mid-line of the gulf is the boundary between Africa and Asia.ISS EarthKAM: Images: Collections: Composite: Gulf of Suez, Egypt and Saudi Arabia The entrance of the gulf lies atop the mature Gemsa oil and gas field.[tpl]cite web|url=http://geology.cr.usgs.gov/energy/WorldEnergy/OF99-50A/province.html |title=USGS Open File Report OF99-50-A Red Sea Basin Province (Province Geology)[/tpl]

==Geography==

The gulf occupies the northwestern arm of the Red Sea between Africa and the Sinai Peninsula. It is the third arm of the triple junction rift system, the second arm being the Gulf of Aqaba. 
The length of the gulf, from its mouth at the Strait of Jubal to its head at the city of Suez, is [tpl]convert|195|mi|km[/tpl], and it varies in width from [tpl]convert|12|to|20|mi|km[/tpl].

===Extent===

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the southern limit of the gulf as "A line running from Ras Muhammed (27°43'N) to the South point of Shadwan Island (34°02'E) and thence Westward on a parallel (27°27'N) to the coast of Africa".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S23_1953.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=7 February 2010[/tpl]

==Geology==

The gulf sedimentary basin stratigraphic section consists of prerift Paleozoic to Oligocene clastic rocks and carbonates, and synrift and postrift Miocene to Holocene clastics and evaporites.[tpl]rp|236[/tpl]
Three large oil fields are in the gulf: the El Morgan discovered in 1964, Belayim discovered in 1955, and the October Field discovered in 1977.Lelek, J.J., Shepherd, D.B., Stone, D.M., and Abdine, A.S., 1992, October Field, In Giant Oil and Gas Fields of the Decade, 1978-1988, AAPG Memoir 54, Halbouty, M.T., editor, Tulsa: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, ISBN0891813330[tpl]rp|238[/tpl]  The October Field produces from the Cretaceous Nubia Formation, the Upper Cretaceous Nezzazat Formation, the Miocene Nukhul Formation, and the Miocene Asl Member of the Upper Rudeis Formation.[tpl]rp|236[/tpl]
