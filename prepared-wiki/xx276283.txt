[[SS Sports Badge]]

CATEGORIES: Orders, decorations, and medals of Nazi Germany

The SS Sports Badge was a rare SS sports decoration of the German Schutzstaffel, created in 1941 as an award of the Germanic-SS.  The decoration was solely awarded to ethnic German SS members, and was not intended for presentation to regular German members of the Allgemeine-SS who were eligible for the regular sports awards of the SA Sports Badge and German Sports Badge.  
Even within the Germanic-SS, the decoration was very rare, in part that most of the Germanic-SS later became eligible for the Germanic Proficiency Runes which encompassed the same tests as those required for the award of the SS Sports Badge.
