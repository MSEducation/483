Yorick is an interpreted programming language designed for numerics, graph plotting and steering large scientific simulation codes. It is quite fast due to array syntax, and extensible via C or Fortran routines. It was created in 1996 by David H. Munro of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

==Features==

Yorick is good at manipulating elements in N-dimensional arrays conveniently with its powerful syntax.
Several elements can be accessed all at once:
Like "theading" in PDL (Perl Data Language) and "broadcasting" in Numpy (Numeric extension for Python), Yorick has a mechanism to do this:
".." is  a rubber-index to represent zero or more dimensions of the array.
"*" is a kind of rubber-index to reshape a slice(sub-array) of array to a vector.
Tensor multiplication is done as follows in Yorick:
P(,+,,)*Q(,,+)
