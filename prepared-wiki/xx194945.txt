Lil' Red is one of two mascots at the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln's athletics teams.  Lil' Red is the newest mascot, having been created for the 1993 season after a state wide contest run for that purpose. Associate athletic director Dr. Barbara Hibner was the driving force in the creation of Lil' Red.http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=462&SPID=41&DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=261  
He can be seen on the sidelines of a Nebraska football game at Memorial Stadium, at the Bob Devaney Sports Center during basketball games and at volleyball games. The mascot is currently produced by Signs and Shapes International, Inc. based in Omaha, Nebraska. The wearer of the costume wears a "PowerBelt," a belt with an air circulation system, which brings in over [tpl]convert|100|cuft|m3[/tpl] of fresh outside air per minute. This is enough fresh air to accommodate roughly 1,000 people. Due to the mascot's incredibly light weight, the larger-than-life mascot can run, dance, crowd surf and shake hands.  
Since its installment, Lil' Red has won two major awards. The first was the national championship at the NCAA National Mascot Competition in 1999.  The second one was an induction into the 2007 Mascot Hall of Fame, which selected its winners by an online vote.http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=462&SPID=41&DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=218533
