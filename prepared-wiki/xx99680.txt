Iolanda Balaș ([tpl]IPA-ro|joˈlanda ˈbalaʃ[/tpl], later Söter, [tpl]lang-hu|Balázs Jolán[/tpl], born 12 December 1936 in Timișoara) is a former Romanian athlete, Olympic champion and world record holder in high jump, who is considered one of the greatest high jumpers ever.

==Early life==

Balaș was born in Timișoara to ethnic Hungarian parents.[tpl]cite web|url=http://sportgeza.hu/sport/balazsjolan/|title='Sajnálom, hogy nem Magyarországnak nyertem olimpiákat'|publisher=sportgeza.hu|date=18 November 2005|accessdate=12 October 2011|language=Hungarian[/tpl] Her mother, Etel Bozó was a homemaker, while her father, Frigyes, was originally a locksmith, who served in the Hungarian army, before he was captured and brought to the Soviet Union and later to Hungary, where he settled in Budapest.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hocipo.hu/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=723|title=Mélységek és magasságok|trans_title=Depths and heights|publisher=Hócipő|date=6 June 2007|accessdate=12 October 2011|language=Hungarian[/tpl] Balaș tried to reunite the family and move to Hungary, but although she managed to obtain the Hungarian passport in 1947, she was not allowed to leave the country.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.3szek.ro/load/cikk/34822/az_egyetemes_magyar_sport_nagyjai:_balazs_jolan|title=Az egyetemes magyar sport nagyjai: Balázs Jolán|trans_title=The greats of the universal Hungarian sport: Balázs Jolán|publisher=3szek.ro|date=6 December 2010|accessdate=12 October 2011|language=Hungarian[/tpl] When asked in an interview in 2005, whether she was thinking about defection, she said that it came to her mind; however, that action could have resulted in serious retaliation against her relatives she would have left behind, and she did not want that.

==Career==

After finishing fifth in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, she won two Olympic gold medals at Rome in 1960 and Tokyo in 1964. Between 1957 and 1966, Balaș won 150 consecutive competitions,Mazdon, S.J.: "Iolanda Balas - 150 Wins In a Row", Track Stats, Vol 29 No 4, December 1991 not including qualifying competitions or exhibitions.  She improved the world record 14 times, from 1.75 m to 1.91 m, and equalled it once outdoors and once indoors. She was the first woman to jump over six feet. Her technique was a sophisticated version of the scissors technique. 
Her record of 1.91 m, set in 1961, lasted until the end of 1971 (beaten by Ilona Gusenbauer from Austria), when jumpers with a more efficient technique (the straddle technique, and later the Fosbury style) took over.
