Our Lady of Beauraing (also known as the Virgin of the Golden Heart) is the title of 33 Marian apparitions reported in Beauraing, Belgium, between November 1932 and January 1933 by five children whose ages ranged between 9 and 15. For several years after the apparitions, pilgrims flocked to the small town of Beauraing, province of Namur (Belgium), and many cures were claimed. 

==The Apparitions==

The young people who claimed to have seen the apparitions were Fernande (15), Gilberte (13), and Albert (11), children of Hector and Marie-Louise Perpete Voisin. Hector Voisin was a railway clerk. With them were Andree (14) and Gilberte (9) Degeimbre, daughters of Germaine Degeimbre, a farmer's widow.Gillett, H.M., "75 years younger than Lourdes", Catholic Herald, 22 November 1957
The children reported that the lady requested that a chapel be built at the site and stated that I am the Immaculate Virgin. She also desired for pilgrims to come to the site and asked the children (and everyone) to pray, pray, pray, and in one of the last visions revealed her Golden Heart."Reported Cure at Beauraing", Catholic Herald, 27 August 1948
In the final vision, the Lady reportedly asked one of the children called Fernande: "Do you love My Son?" and she replied "Yes". She then asked her "Do you love Me?" and she again answered "Yes". The Lady then stated: "Then sacrifice yourself for me." and bade them farewell before the child could reply.
The final approbation for the Marian apparition was granted in 1949 under the direction of the Holy Office by Andr√©-Marie Charue, Bishop of Namur, Belgium.Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices ISBN 0-87973-910-X pages 73-74Francois Leuret, 2006 Modern Miraculous Cures - A Documented Account Of Miracles And Medicine In The 20th Century ISBN 1-4067-9918-1 page 63Matthew Bunson, 2008, The Catholic Almanac, ISBN 978-1-59276-441-9 page 123
