[[Robbins algebra]]

CATEGORIES: Boolean algebra, Formal methods

For all elements a, b, and c:
For many years, it was conjectured, but unproven, that all Robbins algebras are Boolean algebras.  This was proved in 1996, so the term "Robbins algebra" is now simply a synonym for "Boolean algebra".

==History==

In 1933, Edward Huntington proposed a new set of axioms for Boolean algebras, consisting of (1) and (2) above, plus: 
From these axioms, Huntington derived the usual axioms of Boolean algebra.
Verifying the Robbins conjecture required proving Huntingtons equation, or some other axiomatization of a Boolean algebra, as theorems of a Robbins algebra. Huntington, Robbins, Alfred Tarski, and others worked on the problem, but failed to find a proof or counterexample.
William McCune proved the conjecture in 1996, using the automated theorem prover EQP. For a complete proof of the Robbins conjecture in one consistent notation and following McCune closely, see Mann (2003). Dahn (1998) simplified McCune's machine proof.
