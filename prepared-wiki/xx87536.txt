In the 1959 the original station was relocated and placed in a deep cutting, coinciding with the construction of road overpasses for both South Road  and the Nepean Highway. At that time provision was made for a third platform on the eastern side of the cutting.  The third platform was opened on 3 July 1987 when a third line from Caulfield was opened.City of Kingston Heritage Study Stage 1 pages = 39, 42 City of Kingston
