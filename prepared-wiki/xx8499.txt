The Netherlands Antilles was an autonomous entity within the Kingdom of the Netherlands and consisted of the following five islands: Bonaire, Cura√ßao, Saba, Sint Eustatius and the Dutch part of Saint Martin (Sint Maarten).
The Charter of the Kingdom of the Netherlands ([tpl]lang-nl|Statuut[/tpl]) defined the association between the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba. The overseas territories were autonomous, although there were a limited number of affairs which were handled by the Kingdom as a whole. These "Kingdom affairs" included foreign relations.
The government of the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved on 10 October 2010.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2375096.ece/Netherlands_Antilles_to_cease_to_exist_as_a_country |title=Netherlands Antilles to cease to exist as a country |publisher=Nrc.nl |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2010-10-10[/tpl]
