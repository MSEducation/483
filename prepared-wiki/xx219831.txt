The Dawn Media Group is the trading name of Pakistan Herald Publications (Pvt.) Ltd., a Pakistani media company. It started using this trading name in 2008 "to reflect the Group's transformation from a publisher of newspapers and magazines into a powerful multimedia group" (from a 2011 corporate brochure).
