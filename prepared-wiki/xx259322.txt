Assisi railway station ([tpl]lang-it|Stazione di Assisi[/tpl]) serves the town and comune of Assisi, in the Umbria region, central Italy.  Opened in 1866, it forms part of the Foligno–Terontola railway, which also links Florence with Rome. 
The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI).  However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni.  Train services are operated by or on behalf of Trenitalia.  Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company.
Regional train services calling at the station are operated by Ferrovia Centrale Umbra, which sub-contracts on behalf of Trenitalia.

==Location==

Assisi railway station is situated at Piazza Dante Alighieri, in the frazione of Santa Maria degli Angeli, about [tpl]convert|5|km[/tpl] southwest of the city centre.

==History==

The station was opened on 21 July 1866, upon the inauguration of the Foligno–Collestrada section of the Foligno–Terontola railway.[tpl]cite web| author=Alessandro Tuzza and others| url=http://www.trenidicarta.it/aperture.html| title=Prospetto cronologico dei tratti di ferrovia aperti all'esercizio dal 1839 al 31 dicembre 1926| trans_title=Chronological overview of the features of the railways opened between 1839 and 31 December 1926|work=Trenidicarta.it |publisher=Alessandro Tuzza| accessdate=31 December 2010[/tpl] [tpl]it icon[/tpl]

==Features==

The passenger building is on two levels, but only the ground floor is accessible to the traveller.  The first floor houses some Trenitalia offices. Next to the passenger building is another building, single storey but lengthy.  It, too, houses Trenitalia offices. On the other side of the passenger building (originally occupied by a goods yard) there are other small single storey buildings, which house the RFI technical departments.
The station yard consists of three tracks: track 1 is just a single track through line, and the other two tracks are used for overtaking. All tracks are served by platforms connected by an underpass.
Previously, there was a goods yard that has now been dismantled.  As at 2010, the yard area was vacant.
 

==Passenger and train movements==

The station has about 800,000 passenger movements each year.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.centostazioni.it/flussi.html |title=Flussi Annui nelle 103 Stazioni|trans_title=Annual flows at the 103 stations|author= |date= |work=Centostazioni website |publisher=Centostazioni |accessdate=4 December 2010[/tpl] [tpl]it icon[/tpl] 
Trains are mainly regional rail services, with occasional InterCity trains to Milan, and Eurostar trains to Perugia and Rome.   Regional services are operated by Ferrovia Centrale Umbra, which sub-contracts on behalf of Trenitalia.  InterCity and long distance services are operated by Trenitalia itself.
About 54 trains call at the station each day.  The main destinations of the regional trains are Rome, Florence, Foligno, Terontola-Cortona, Terni and Perugia.
