Supersonic Festival is a yearly music festival in Birmingham featuring a combination of music, art, film and other crafts.  It continues to join boundaries between music and art, by inviting people to engage with both through a programme of avant garde sound and performance as well as hands-on workshops taking place across Digbeth, Birmingham in a series of converted factory warehouses and art galleries.
Capsule, the organisation behind Supersonic Festival, are curators, promoters and fans of cutting edge music, revealing the indescribable connections between contemporary music and art, crafting extraordinary events for adventurous audiences.  Capsule’s passion for genre bending sound and performances is at the heart of all their events – there are not many places in Birmingham where you can listen to funeral doom, prog, folk, avant jazz and grindcore in one weekend.
The festival is now in its 8th year, starting out as a 1-day event in 2003 which featured Coil, LCD Sound System, The Bug, DJ Food and many more. Over the years the festival has garnered a worldwide reputation for being one of the more exciting events for experimental music.
