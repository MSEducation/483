The band whose Glam metal image and sound was somewhat similar to 80's-era Kiss were dropped from their record label in later 1986 after executives saw no potential hit singles on their self-titled debut album.
On April 5, 2007, Mark St. John died from an apparent cerebral hemorrhage at age 51.[tpl]cite news |first=Greg |last=Prato |title=Ex-Kiss guitarist Mark St. John dies |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=3020020 |publisher=ABC News |date=2007-04-08 |accessdate=2007-04-09 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl]
