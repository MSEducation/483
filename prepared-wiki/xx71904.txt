[[Bedtime for Democracy]]

Bedtime for Democracy is the fourth and final studio album released by Dead Kennedys. Songs on this album cover such common punk subjects as conformity, Reaganomics, the military, and even criticizing aspects of their own punk movement. The title of the album is a reference to the 1951 comedy film, Bedtime for Bonzo starring Ronald Reagan, and perhaps also reflects the weary band's bitterness in the aftermath of the financially and emotionally draining trial they were being subjected to at the time over the controversial art included with their previous album. In fact, by the time recording began, they had already played what would be their last live concert with Jello Biafra and announced their breakup immediately after the record's release. There is a typing error on the Manifesto CDs so that the time length for Gone with My Wind is printed ":43" when it should read "1:43". On the original vinyl version, Side A was tracks 1-11 and Side B was tracks 12-21. It also came with a mock periodical in the form of a thin newspaper made up of collage art, called "Fuck Facts."
The East Bay punk band Isocracy parodied the name in their 1988 EP, Bedtime for Isocracy. The cover art depicted the band together in a bed, accompanied by Jello Biafra.
