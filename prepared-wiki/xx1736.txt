As a country with a generally cool climate, Canada has enjoyed greater success at the Winter Olympics than at the Summer Olympics, although significant regional variations in climate allow for a wide variety of both team and individual sports.

==Cuisine==

Canadian cuisine varies widely depending on the regions of the nation. The former Canadian prime minister Joe Clark has been paraphrased to have noted: "Canada has a cuisine of cuisines. Not a stew pot, but a smorgasbord."[tpl]citation |first=George |last=Pandi |title=Let's eat Canadian, but is there really a national dish? |journal=The Gazette (Montreal) |date=April 5, 2008 |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/columnists/story.html?id=6ad83058-3f7b-4403-8aa8-dce47b16884e[/tpl] Also published as "Canadian cuisine a smorgasbord of regional flavours" There are considerable overlaps between Canadian food and the rest of the cuisine in North America, many unique dishes (or versions of certain dishes) are found and available only in the country.

The three earliest cuisines of Canada have First Nations, English, and French roots, with the traditional cuisine of English Canada closely related to British and American cuisine, while the traditional cuisine of French Canada has evolved from French cuisine and the winter provisions of fur traders.[tpl]cite book|author=Linda Civitello|title=Cuisine and Culture: A History of Food and People|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CwRE0HIIyWkC&pg=PA401|year= 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-40371-6|pages=401–402[/tpl] With subsequent waves of immigration in the 18th and 19th century from Central, Southern, and Eastern Europe, and then from Asia, Africa and Caribbean, the regional cuisines were subsequently augmented. The Jewish immigrants to Canada during the late 1800s also play a significant role to foods in Canada. The Montreal-style bagel and Montreal-style smoked meat are both food items developed by Jewish communities living in Montreal.

==Outside views==

In 1984, Baron Moran, the British High Commissioner to Canada, stated that, in his opinion, Canadians have limited talents and are "deeply unimpressive." Said Moran, "Anyone who is even moderately good at what they do — in literature, the theater, skiing or whatever — tends to become a national figure.  And anyone who stands out at all from the crowd tends to be praised to the skies and given the Order of Canada at once."  Baron Moran also wrote that "The presence of the "ethnics" is already beginning to cause minor problems in Toronto and Montreal, though happily, as yet, nothing at all compared to the looming social problems associated with the proliferation of blacks and hispanics in so many American cities."(Associated Press), "Letters reveal candid views of UK diplomats", WTOP, October 18, 2009.

A 2007 poll ranked Canada as the country with the most positive influence in the world. 28,000 people in 27 countries were asked to rate 12 countries as either having a positive or negative worldwide influence. Canada’s overall influence rating topped the list with 54 per cent of respondents rating it mostly positive and only 14 per cent mostly negative.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.canadavisa.com/canada-a-good-influence-on-the-world.html |title=Canada – A Good Influence on the World |publisher=Canadavisa.com |date=March 7, 2007 |accessdate=June 30, 2010[/tpl]
