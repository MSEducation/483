Ivan Henning Hjalmar Eklind (October 15, 1905 - July 23, 1981) was a football referee from Sweden famous for refereeing the controversial[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] 1934 FIFA World Cup Final between Italy and Czechoslovakia in Rome.

==Rene Mercet==

Regarding the 1934 tournament Jean Langenus, the famous Belgian referee recorded his concerns regarding the way the tournament was organised and run; a Swiss referee Rene Mercet (who was appointed to officiate at the opening game) was suspended later by the Swiss Football Association for his performance in the replayed quarter-final match involving Italy and Spain. 

==The Final==

In the final, Eklind penalised a two-footed lunge by Luis Monti on František Svoboda with the award of simply a free-kick. Eraldo Monzeglio fouled Antonin Puc inside the Italian penalty area,[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] no penalty was awarded.  Giuseppe Meazza punched Rudolf Krcil in the back.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2008[/tpl] However, in both matches that Eklind officiated in, Italy won beating Austria 1-0, and Czechoslovakia (after extra time in the final) 2-1.http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/p/pwc/ph/1934.html?i=3&d=1

==Later career==

Eklind officiated in 6 World Cup finals matches over a 16 year period (1934–1950) (one as Assistant Referee to Baert in June 1938, ironically, for the game in which Italy donned their fascist all-black strip when playing France), including the Brazil triumph against Poland in Strasbourg in which 11 goals were scored and a Group A match at the 1950 World Cup.  Baert was also to go on to enjoy an incredibly lengthy international career.
