Fingers is a 1978 drama film directed by James Toback.

==Synopsis==

Jimmy "Fingers" Angelelli (Harvey Keitel) is a brilliant young pianist who also works as a collector for his father Ben (Michael V. Gazzo), a powerful loan shark. Wherever Jimmy goes, he always carries a stereo with him, playing classic rock from the '50's and '60's. While trying to concentrate on an up-coming recital interview at Carnegie Hall, Jimmy loses focus when he falls for a woman named Carol (Tisa Farrow). He gets further side-tracked with collecting a large debt from a mafioso named Riccamonza (Tony Sirico), who eventually threatens Ben's life. This forces Jimmy to seek retribution.

==Cast==

==Production==

James Toback said he originally wanted Robert de Niro to play the lead but then decided to use de Niro's best friend, Harvey Keitel. "Harvey agreed to play Jimmy and quickly began to astonish me by taking the character into dimensions of darkness well beyond my original imagining," wrote Toback.James Toback, "A Hollywood Mis-Education", Vanity Fair, March 2014 accessed 10 February 2014

==Influence==

The film was remade in 2005 in France as The Beat That My Heart Skipped.
The film is also referenced in Get Shorty -- an in-joke, considering John Travolta's character is a loan shark. Keitel himself makes a cameo as well.

==Music==

Two notable pieces from the film are "Angel of the Morning" by Merrilee Rush and "Summertime, Summertime" by The Jamies. Director Toback,  initially wanted to use the song "Summertime" [tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2009[/tpl] because the movie had "a summertime feel to it," and they wanted to shoot it during the summer months. It wasn't to be however, yet he thought it appropriate enough to leave the song in there. The whole film, however, is framed by the music of Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata in E minor (BWV 914), which Keitel's character plays throughout the film, including during his audition at Carnegie Hall.
