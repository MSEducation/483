Member-by-member sponsorship of the 12 men's ACC sports for the 2013-14 academic year. The ACC will resume sponsoring fencing in 2014-15.
 Notre Dame sponsors football as an independent. Although Notre Dame has a commitment to play five games per year against ACC football teams, it does not participate in the ACC football standings and thus is not eligible for the ACC football championship. Notre Dame does, however, have access to the ACC's bowl lineup aside from the Orange Bowl, to which it has its own arrangement for access.
^ Miami participates in diving only. For the purposes of this chart, Miami men's diving is counted as sponsoring half of the sport of men's swimming & diving.

===Champions for current academic year===

==Baseball==

ACC member schools have collectively won the baseball national championship five times in their history and have appeared in the College World Series a combined total of 85 times. In 2013, the ACC was ranked as the top baseball conference by Ratings Percentage Index (RPI) and has consistently ranked among the top three conference by that measure over the past five years.[tpl]cite web|url=http://WarrenNolan.com/baseball/2013/conferencerpi|title=Conference RPI|publisher=WarrenNolan.com|accessdate=July 2, 2013[/tpl] In 2013, eight ACC teams, plus future ACC member Louisville, were selected to play in the 2013 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament, with North Carolina, NC State, and Louisville advancing to the College World Series.
ACC Baseball is divided into two divisions, the Atlantic Division and the Coastal Division, that parallel the divisions of ACC football except for the fact that Syracuse is the only ACC school that does not field a baseball team and Notre Dame is assigned to the Atlantic Division. Louisville will replace Maryland in the Atlantic Division beginning with the 2015 season.
Wake Forest won the ACC's only national championship in 1955. Miami won its four national championships (1982, 1985, 1999, 2001) prior to joining the ACC.
Syracuse does not currently field a baseball team but has one appearance in the NCAA baseball tournament prior to joining the conference. 
† The count of College World Series appearances includes those made by the school prior to joining the ACC:

==Basketball==

===History===

Historically, the ACC has been considered one of the most successful conferences in men's basketball. The early roots of ACC basketball began primarily thanks to two men: Everett Case and Frank McGuire.
Case had been a successful high school coach in Indiana who accepted the head coaching job at North Carolina State at a time that the school's athletic department had decided to focus on competing in football on a level with Duke, then a national power in college football. Case's North Carolina State teams dominated the early years of the ACC with a modern, fast-paced style of play. He became the fastest college basketball coach to reach many "games won" milestones.
Case eventually became known as The Father of ACC Basketball. Despite his success on the court, he may have been even a better promoter off-the-court. Case realized the need to sell his program and university. That is why he organized the funding and construction of Reynolds Coliseum  as the new home court for his team. At the time, Reynolds Coliseum was the largest on-campus arena in the South, and it was therefore used as the host site for many Southern Conference Tournaments, ACC Tournaments, and the Dixie Classic, an annual event involving the four ACC teams from North Carolina as well as four other prominent programs from across the nation. The Dixie Classic brought in large revenues for all schools involved and soon became one of the premier sporting events in the South.
Partly to counter Case's personality, as well as the dominant success of his program, North Carolina convinced St. John's head coach Frank McGuire to come to Chapel Hill in 1952.  McGuire knew that largely due to Case's influence, basketball was now the major high school athletic event of the region, unlike football in the South. He not only tapped the growing market of high school talent in North Carolina, but also brought several recruits from his home territory in New York City as well.  Case and McGuire literally invented a rivalry. Both men realized the benefits created through a rivalry between them. It brought more national attention to both of their programs and increased fan support on both sides. For this reason, they often exchanged verbal jabs at each other in public, while maintaining a secret working relationship in private.
After State was slapped with crippling NCAA sanctions before the 1956-57 season, McGuire's North Carolina team stepped into the breach and delivered the ACC its first national championship.  During the Tar Heels' championship run, entrepreneur from Greensboro named Castleman D. Chesley noticed the popularity that it generated. He hastily cobbled together a five-station television network to broadcast the Final Four.  That network began broadcasting regular season ACC games the following season—the ancestor of today's television package from Raycom Sports. From that point on, ACC basketball gained large popularity.
The ACC has been the home of many prominent basketball coaches besides Case and McGuire, including Terry Holland of Virginia, Vic Bubas and Mike Krzyzewski of Duke, Press Maravich, Norm Sloan and Jim Valvano of North Carolina State, Dean Smith and  Roy Williams of North Carolina, Bones McKinney of Wake Forest, Lefty Driesell and Gary Williams of Maryland Bobby Cremins of Georgia Tech and this coming season, Jim Boeheim of Syracuse.
Historically, the ACC has been dominated by the four teams from Tobacco Road in North Carolina—North Carolina, Duke, North Carolina State and Wake Forest.  Between them, they have won 50 tournament titles.  They have also won or shared 59 regular season titles, including all but four since 1981.

===Tournament as championship===

Possibly Case's most lasting contribution is the ACC Tournament, which was first played in 1954 and decides the winner of the ACC title. The ACC is unique in that it is the only Division I college basketball conference that does not officially recognize a regular season champion. This started when only one school per conference made the NCAA tournament. The ACC representative was determined by conference tournament rather than the regular season result. Therefore, the league eliminated the regular season title in 1961, choosing to recognize only the winner of the ACC tournament as conference champion. Fans and media do claim a regular-season title for the team that finishes first, and the NCAA recognizes a regular-season title winner in order to maintain its system of choosing NIT and NCAA tournament berths based on regular season placement.[tpl]cite web|title=March Madness Swells as NCAA Pumps Up NIT Tournament|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aMw7OarRcGLI&refer=us|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=2013-03-21|date=2006-03-14[/tpl] For the ACC, the unofficial crowning of a regular season champion is insignificant as a 1975 NCAA rule change allowed more than one team per conference to get a guaranteed bid to the NCAA Tournament. As a result, the team finishing atop the ACC regular-season standings is invited to the NCAA Tournament even if they do not win the ACC Tournament. Even so, any claim to a regular season "title" remains unofficial and carries no reward other than top seed in the ACC tournament.

===Present-day schedule===

For 53 years, the ACC employed a double round-robin schedule in the regular season, in which each team played the others twice a season.  With the expansion to 12 teams by the 2005–2006 season, the ACC schedule could no longer accommodate this format.  In the new scheduling format that was agreed to, each team was assigned two permanent partners and nine rotating partners over a three-year period.  Teams played their permanent partners in a home-and-away series each year.  The rotating partners were split into three groups: three teams played in a home-and-away series, three teams played at home, and three teams played on the road.  The rotating partner groups were rotated so that a team would play each permanent partner six times, and each rotating partner four times, over a three-year period.
Since 1999, the ACC in cooperation with the Big Ten Conference has held the ACC–Big Ten Challenge each season, which is a series of regular-season games pitting ACC and Big Ten teams against each other. Each team typically plays one Challenge game each season, except for a few teams from the larger conference that are left out due to unequal conference sizes. The first ACC–Big Ten Women's Challenge was played in 2007, and has the same format as the men's Challenge.
For the 2012–13 season, the 12-team in-conference schedule expanded to 18.  Originally for the 2013-14 season, the expanded 14-team, 18-game schedule was to consist of a home and away game with a "primary partner" while the remaining conference opponents would have rotated in groups of three: one year both home and away, one year at home only, and one year away only.[tpl]cite web|title=ACC Announces Future Regular-Season Scheduling Formats|url=http://www.theacc.com/genrel/020312aaa.html|publisher=Atlantic Coast Conference|accessdate=2012-02-07|date=2012-02-03[/tpl] However, when Notre Dame was also added for the 2013-14 season, the now 15-team, 18-game schedule was modified so each school played two "Partners" home and away annually, two home and away, five home, and the other five away.[tpl]cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/blog/_/name/katz_andy/id/8460836/acc-gets-right-new-scheduling-format-men-college-basketball |title=Expanding ACC sets primary partners |first=Andy |last=Katz |authorlink=Andy Katz |publisher=ESPN.com |date=October 4, 2012 |accessdate=September 20, 2013[/tpl] In 2013-14, after 1 year at 18 games, women's basketball went back to a 16 game schedule where each team only plays 2 teams twice, rotating opponents each year over seven years and has no permanent partners.
The table below lists each school's permanent men's basketball only scheduling partners after expansion in July 2013. Louisville will replace Maryland in the pairings once it joins the ACC.

===National championships and Final Fours===

Over the course of its existence, ACC schools have captured 12 NCAA men's basketball championships while members of the conference. North Carolina has won five, Duke has won four, NC State has won two, and Maryland has won one. Four more national titles were won by current or future ACC members while in other conferences—three by 2014 arrival Louisville and one by 2013 arrival Syracuse. Seven of the 12 pre-2013 members have advanced to the Final Four at least once while members of the ACC. Another pre-2013 member, Florida State, made the Final Four once before joining the ACC. All three schools that entered the ACC in 2013, as well as Louisville, advanced to the Final Four at least once before joining the conference. In addition North Carolina, Notre Dame, Pitt, and Syracuse were awarded Helms Athletic Foundation national championships for seasons predating the beginning of the NCAA basketball championship in 1939.
In women's basketball, ACC members have won two national championships while in the conference, North Carolina in 1994 and Maryland in 2006. Notre Dame, which joined in 2013, won the national title in 2001. In 2006, Duke, Maryland, and North Carolina all advanced to the Final Four, the first time a conference placed three teams in the women's Final Four. Both finalists were from the ACC, with Maryland defeating Duke for the title.
Italics denotes honors earned before the school joined the ACC. Women's national championship tournaments prior to 1982 were run by the AIAW.

==Field hockey==

The ACC has won 17 of the 31 NCAA Championships in field hockey.

==Football==

The ACC is considered to be one of the six collegiate football power conferences which all receive automatic placement of their football champion into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). Seven of its members claim football national championships in their history, with two having won the BCS since 1999. Five of its members are among the top 25 of college football's all-time winningest programs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/misc/div_ia_wins.php|title=Division I-A All-Time Wins|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|accessdate=July 2, 2013[/tpl]

===Divisions===

In 2005, the ACC began divisional play in football. Division leaders compete in a playoff game to determine the ACC championship. The inaugural Championship Game was played on December 3, 2005, in Jacksonville, Florida, at the stadium then known as Alltel Stadium, in which Florida State defeated Virginia Tech to capture its 12th championship since it joined the league in 1992. Beginning in 2014 Notre Dame will play several ACC teams each year, but will not be considered a football member and will not be eligible to play in the ACC Championship Game.[tpl]cite web|title=Notre Dame sets ACC schedule for 2014-16|author=Chip Patterson|publisher=CBSSports.com|date=December 20, 2013|accessdate=April 28, 2014|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/24381940/notre-dame-sets-acc-schedule-for-2014-16[/tpl]
The ACC was the only NCAA Division I conference whose divisions were not divided geographically (North/South, East/West)NCAA College Football Standings Accessed March 3, 2010 until the Big Ten announced its division names after the 2010 regular season.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.chicagobreakingsports.com/2010/12/big-ten-division-names-legends-and-leaders.html | title=Big Ten division names: Legends and Leaders | first=Teddy | last=Greenstein | newspaper=Chicago Breaking Sports  | publisher=Chicago Tribune | date=December 13, 2010 | accessdate=December 13, 2010[/tpl] The Big Ten will change to geographic divisions when Maryland and Rutgers join that conference in 2014, and the Mountain West Conference, which split into football divisions in 2013, uses "Mountain" and "West" for its division names, with all of the Mountain Division teams in the Mountain Time Zone and all of the West Division teams except football-only member Hawaii in the Pacific Time Zone, which means that the ACC will once again be the only Division I conference with non-geographic divisions.
The previous division structure led to each team playing the following games:
On February 3, 2012, the ACC announced a new regular-season scheduling format which added Syracuse to the Atlantic division and Pittsburgh to the Coastal division. These new teams will be cross-divisional rivals. This change will take effect once Pitt and Syracuse join the conference in July 2013. On October 3, 2012, it was announced that the extra in-division game will result in one fewer cross-division game.[tpl]cite news | url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8456886/acc-keep-8-game-league-football-schedule | title=ACC sticks with 8-game schedule | date=October 2, 2012 | publisher=espn | accessdate=October 2, 2012[/tpl]

===Rivalries===

====Conference====

====Non-Conference====

===Bowl games===

Within the Bowl Championship Series, the Orange Bowl serves as the home of the ACC champion against another BCS at-large selection unless the conference's champion is selected for the national championship game.
The other bowls pick ACC teams in the order set by agreements between the conference and the bowls. The ACC Championship Game runner-up is guaranteed to fall no lower than the Sun Bowl, the 4th pick, in the conference bowl hierarchy.[tpl]cite web|last=Dinich|first=Heather|title=New ACC bowl selection process in effect for 2010|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/acc/post/_/id/7643/new-acc-bowl-selection-process-in-effect-for-2010|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=February 3, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65BlHPXg0|archivedate=February 3, 2012|date=December 7, 2009|deadurl=no[/tpl] Previously the ACC Championship Game runner-up had been guaranteed the Music City Bowl with usually then the 5th pick.[tpl]cite web|title=2008 Bowl Selection Process for Atlantic Coast Conference Teams|url=http://www.theacc.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/112508aaa.html|publisher=Atlantic Coast Conference|accessdate=February 3, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65BlRnRKq|archivedate=February 3, 2012|deadurl=no[/tpl] The other rule change that will be in effect for the next four years is that the ACC has eliminated the clause in the contract that states if a bowl team has already selected the runner-up, it doesn't have to choose it again.
Moreover, a bowl game can bypass a team in the selection process only if the two teams in question are within one game of each other in the overall ACC standings. This rule was instituted in response to concerns over the 2005 bowl season, in which Atlantic Division co-champion Boston College fell to the ACC's then-last remaining bowl slot, the MPC Computers Bowl in Boise, Idaho.
In conjunction with Notre Dame's 2014 entry to the conference, The Irish "have access" to the ACC's non-Orange Bowl bowl games.
 Unless the ACC champion is ranked #1 or #2 in the BCS poll, in which case the ACC champion will play in the national championship game, and the Orange Bowl will select one of the other BCS teams.
 The Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl has a conditional arrangement with the ACC: if its primary partners are not bowl eligible, and if the ACC has nine bowl-eligible teams, then the bowl takes the ninth selection of ACC teams.

===National championships===

Although the NCAA does not determine an official national champion for Division I FBS football, several ACC members claim national championships awarded by various "major selectors" of national championships as recognized in the official NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records.[tpl]cite book | url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2011/FBS.pdf  | title=2011 NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records | pages=70–75 | publisher=The National Collegiate Athletic Association | date=August 2011 | location=Indianapolis, IN | accessdate=2011-10-17[/tpl] Since 1936 and 1950 respectively, these include what are now the most pervasive and influential selectors, the Associated Press poll and Coaches Poll. In addition, since 1998 the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) has used a mathematical formula to match the top two teams at the end of the season. The winner of the BCS is contractually awarded the Coaches' Poll national championship and its AFCA National Championship Trophy as well as the MacArthur Trophy from the National Football Foundation.

==Golf==

Of the current ACC members, 12 sponsor men's golf and 10 sponsor women's golf. Four team national championships in men's golf and five national titles in women's golf have been won by ACC members while in the conference, led by the Duke women's team that has won five national titles since 1999. In addition, two more team national titles, one in men's golf and one in women's golf, have been won by current ACC members before they joined the conference.

==Lacrosse==

Since 1971, when the first men's national champion was determined by the NCAA, the ACC has won 13 national championships, more than any other conference in college lacrosse.  Virginia has won five national championships, North Carolina has won four, and Maryland and Duke have won two each. In addition, prior to the establishment of the NCAA tournament, Maryland had won nine national championships while Virginia won two. Many have speculated that beginning in 2014 the ACC men's lacrosse conference, with the inclusions of Syracuse and Notre Dame, may be the best conference of any NCAA sport, [tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] despite the SEC's dominance in football. As of 2013, at least one current ACC member has played in the national championship game every year since 1987.
Women's lacrosse has only awarded a national championship since 1982, and the ACC has won more titles than any other conference. In all, the ACC has won 14 women's national championships: Maryland has won ten, Virginia has won three and North Carolina has won one.
Italics denotes championships before it was part of the ACC.  
* Syracuse vacated its 1990 championship due to NCAA violations.

==Soccer==

In men's soccer, the ACC has won 16 national championships, including 13 in the 26 seasons between 1984 and 2009. Six have been won by Virginia. The remaining nine have been won by Maryland (3 times), Clemson (twice), North Carolina (twice), Duke, Wake Forest, and Notre Dame.
In women's soccer, North Carolina has won 21 of the 28 NCAA titles since the NCAA crowned its first champion, as well as the only Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) soccer championship in 1981. The Tar Heels have also won 18 of the 22 ACC tournaments. They lost in the final to North Carolina State in 1988 and Virginia in 2004, both times by penalty kicks. The 2010 tournament was the first in which they failed to make the championship game, falling to eventual champion Wake Forest in the semi-finals. The 2012 ACC tournament saw North Carolina's first-ever quarterfinal loss, to eventual champion Virginia; however, the Tar Heels went on to win the national title that season. Notre Dame won three NCAA titles before it joined the ACC in 2013.

==Academics==

Among the major NCAA athletic conferences that sponsor NCAA Division I FBS football, including the BCS "power conferences", the ACC has been regarded as having the highest academically ranked collection of members based on U.S. News & World Report[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.outkickthecoverage.com/us-news-rankings-of-top-six-football-conferences.php|title=U.S. News Rankings of Top Six Football Conferences|first=Clay|last=Travis|publisher=Outkick The Coverage|date=September 20, 2012|accessdate=June 24, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.orangeandwhite.com/news/2012/sep/20/us-news-best-college-rankings-spotlight-academic-s/|title=U.S. News 'Best College' rankings spotlight academic strength of ACC|publisher=OrangeAndWhite.com|date=September 20, 2012|accessdate=June 24, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.dailypress.com/sports/teel-blog/dp-teel-time-academics-matter-to-acc-and-that-favors-public-ivy-texas-no-45-in-us-news-rankings-20110914,0,254316.story|title=Teel Time: Texas, 45th in U.S. News rankings, fits ACC's academic profile|first=David|last=Teel|newspaper=Daily Press|location=Hampton Roads, VA|date=September 14, 2011|accessdate=June 24, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/867510-college-football-power-rankings-the-best-bcs-conferences-based-on-academics/page/8|title=College Football Rankings: Best BCS Conferences Based on Academics|first=John|last=Bain|publisher=Bleacher Report|date=September 27, 2011|accessdate=June 24, 2013[/tpl] and by the NCAA's Academic Progress Rate.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/blog/eye-on-college-basketball/22476849/study-how-and-why-the-apr-is-improving-major-program-academics|title=Study: How and why the APR is improving major-program academics|first=Matt|last=Norlander|publisher=CBSSports.com|date=June 19, 2013|accessdate=June 24, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.accsports.com/blogs/jim-young/2013061215612/analyzing-the-accs-apr.php|title=Analyzing The ACC’s APR|first=Jim|last=Young|publisher=ACC Sports Journal|date=June 12, 2013|accessdate=June 24, 2013[/tpl]
The members of the ACC also participate in the Atlantic Coast Conference Inter-institutional Academic Collaborative (ACCIAC), a consortium that provides a vehicle for inter-institutional academic and administrative collaboration between member universities. Growing out of a conference-wide doctoral student-exchange program that was established in 1999, the ACCIAC has expanded its scope into other domestic and international collaborations.[tpl]cite news|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/NCAANewsArchive/2006/Briefly+in+the+News/briefly%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bnews%2B-%2B3-13-06%2Bncaa%2Bnews.html|title=ACC takes worldwide approach to academic programs|first=Leilana|last=McKindra|newspaper=The NCAA News|date=March 13, 2006|accessdate=June 24, 2013[/tpl]
The stated mission of the ACCIAC is to "enrich the educational missions, especially the undergraduate student experiences, of member universities." To that end, the collaborative helps organize various academic initiatives, including fellowship and scholarship programs, global research initiatives, leadership conferences, and extensive study abroad programs.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2008-07-14/sports/36903690_1_acc-recruits-north-carolina-state/2|title=ACC's Forward Progress Limited; Expanded Conference Rates Mixed Reviews at 5-Year Mark|first=Steve|last=Yanda|newspaper=The Washington Post|location=Washington, DC|date=July 14, 2008|accessdate=June 26, 2013[/tpl] Funding for its operations, 90% of which is spent on direct student support, is derived from a portion of the income generated by the ACC Football Championship Game and by supplemental allocations by individual universities and various grants.[tpl]cite web|url=http://acciac.org/about-the-acciac/|title=About the ACCIAC|first=David G. |last=Brown|year=2009|accessdate=April 24, 2013[/tpl]
