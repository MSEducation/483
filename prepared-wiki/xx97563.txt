CATEGORIES: Geography of the British Indian Ocean Territory

The British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) is an archipelago of 55 islands in the Indian Ocean South of India, it is situated approximately halfway between Africa and Indonesia. The islands form a semicircular group with an open sea towards the east. The largest, Diego Garcia, is located at the southern extreme end. It measures [tpl]convert|60|km2[/tpl] and accounts for almost three-quarters of the total land area of the territory.[tpl]sfn|Notholt|2008|p=5[/tpl] Diego Garcia is the only inhabited island and is home to the joint UK-US naval support facility.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/80241/British-Indian-Ocean-Territory|title=British Indian Ocean Territory|accessdate=23 June 2013|publisher=Encyclopedia Brittanica[/tpl] Other islands within the archipelago include Danger Island, Three Brothers, Nelsons Island, and Peros Banhos, as well as the island groups of the Egmont Islands, Eagle Islands, and Salomon Islands.

==Physical geography==

BIOT is an archipelago of 55 islands.[tpl]sfn|Central Intelligence Agency|2010|p=93[/tpl] They were annexed by the UK in 1965 under the Treaty of Paris from a much larger archipelago which in 1804 consisted of 2,300 independent islands.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/asia/biot.htm|title=British Indian Ocean Territory|accessdate=23 June 2013|publisher=WorldAtlas.com[/tpl] BIOT is situated in the Indian Ocean near the Equator. It is roughly half-way between Africa and Indonesia, about [tpl]convert|1000|miles[/tpl] southwest of India.[tpl]sfn|Central Intelligence Agency|2010|p=93[/tpl] It is situated approximately [tpl]convert|1600|km[/tpl] from South India and [tpl]convert|600|km[/tpl] to the south of the Maldives[tpl]sfn|Haggett|2001|p=2627[/tpl] With a coastline stretching [tpl]convert|698|km[/tpl], it is the southern extension of the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge.[tpl]sfn|Green|2006|p=408[/tpl] The Chagos Islands archipelago are northeast of Mauritius, while Agalega Islands are due north.[tpl]sfn|Paul|1987|p=146[/tpl] The islands are characterised as coral atolls whose formation occurred at the summits of volcanic mountains these being submerged. The terrain is flat and low, with most areas not exceeding [tpl]convert|2|m[/tpl] above sea level.[tpl]sfn|Central Intelligence Agency|2010|p=93[/tpl]
The climate is tropical marine; hot, humid, and moderated by trade winds. It is located outside the route of the cyclones.

===Marine reserve===

The lagoon that surrounds the atoll has an area of about [tpl]convert|120|km2|sqmi[/tpl]. The maximum water depth in the lagoon is about [tpl]convert|25|m|ft[/tpl]. The width of the coral reef varies from [tpl]convert|100|-|200|m|ft[/tpl] with a shallow depth of about [tpl]convert|1|m|ft[/tpl] on the seaward side. The area covered by the fringing seaward reef shelf is about [tpl]convert|35.2|km2|sqmi[/tpl]. The bed slope noted at the outer edge of the reef shelf is steep towards the deeper end; the depth drops to more than [tpl]convert|450|m|ft[/tpl] in some areas within [tpl]convert|1|km|mi[/tpl] distance from the shore.
In 2010, the whole territory, as well as [tpl]convert|545000|km2|sqmi|0[/tpl] of ocean around the islands, was declared a marine reserve.[tpl]Cite web|title=Blue Reef visitors win support for the Chago campaign|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/cornwall/hi/people_and_places/nature/newsid_8605000/8605317.stm|accessdate=23 May 2013[/tpl] It is known formally as the Chagos Marine Protected Area,[tpl]cite web|title=Chagos Island Marine Reserve|url=http://www.marine-conservation.org.uk/chagos.html|publisher=Marine Conservation Society (UK) SouthEast|accessdate=23 June 2013[/tpl] because it is a "pristine ocean ecosystem now representing 16% of the world's fully protected coral reef."[tpl]sfn|Acton|2012|p=524[/tpl] Fishing is banned within the reserve area.

===Landforms===

Of the 55 islands of the Chagos Archipelago, Diego Garcia is the largest. Aside from this, the main islands are the Egmont Islands, Danger Island, Eagle Islands, Three Brothers, Nelsons Island, Salomon Islands, and Peros Banhos at the northern end of the Chagos Archipelago.[tpl]sfn|Vine|2011|p=22[/tpl]
The coral atoll of Diego Garcia is approximately [tpl]convert|1970|nmi|km[/tpl] east of the coast of Africa (at Tanzania), [tpl]convert|967|nmi|km[/tpl] south-southwest of the southern tip of India (at Kanyakumari) and [tpl]convert|2550|nmi|km[/tpl] west-northwest of the west coast of Australia (at Cape Range National Park, Western Australia). Diego Garcia lies at the southernmost tip of the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge — a vast submarine range in the Indian Ocean.[tpl]NatGeo ecoregion|id=im0125|name=Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago tropical moist forests[/tpl] The total area encompassed by the atoll is [tpl]convert|169.6|km2|sqmi[/tpl]. At the entrance to the lagoon, there are three small islands, and these are East Island ([tpl]convert|7.49|ha[/tpl]), Middle Island ([tpl]convert|4.98|ha[/tpl]), and West Island ([tpl]convert|2|ha[/tpl]).Natural Resources Management Plan (2005), paragraph 2.5.1. In some areas, the atoll has both marshes and wetlands.Natural Resources Management Plan (2005), paragraph 3.3.2.1. The ecosystem consists of undisturbed tropical forests.[tpl]Cite web|title=Mauritius stakes claim for Chagos|date=30 March 2004|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3583927.stm|accessdate=23 June 2013[/tpl]
Egmont Atoll is also known as Six Isles and includes a seventh unnamed island. It was occupied for short periods during the mid 19th century[tpl]sfn|Evers|Kooy|2011|p=27[/tpl] The atoll, in the form of “U”, is a small strip of land with width varying from [tpl]convert|30|m|ft[/tpl] to a maximum of [tpl]convert|3|km|mi[/tpl] at its northern extremity.. The total land area of the atoll is [tpl]convert|2430|ha[/tpl]. A fringing reef circumscribes the atoll. There are two openings into the ocean. It almost encompasses a large lagoon. The lagoon itself is [tpl]convert|20|km|mi[/tpl] in length and is more than [tpl]convert|10|km|mi[/tpl] in width. Rounded pumic stones found on the eastern beach of the island by one of the explorers of the island have been inferred as debris from the Krakatoa volcanic eruption of 1883 [tpl]sfn|Paul|1987|p=14[/tpl] The atoll is [tpl]convert|23|league|km[/tpl] to the northwest of Diego Garcia, on the Chagos Bank. The islands are connected by reefs which are steep and there are no locations for anchorage on its shores.[tpl]sfn|Tuckey|1815|pp=64-65[/tpl] 
Danger Island, a small coral patch which has shrubs and coconut trees is [tpl]convert|5|league|km[/tpl] from Six Islands. From the Danger islands, two of the Eagle Islands are [tpl]convert|2|league|km[/tpl] away. The Four Brothers are an island group [tpl]convert|4|league|km[/tpl] from Danger Island.[tpl]sfn|Tuckey|1815|pp=64-65[/tpl] Danger Island is a [tpl]convert|2|km[/tpl] long and flat island with a maximum width of [tpl]convert|400|m|ft[/tpl]. It is covered with tall coconut trees. The closest land is Île Vache Marine, the southernmost of the Eagle Islands, which lies [tpl]convert|16|km[/tpl] to the north-northeast.British Admiralty nautical chart 11000030 – 3 Chagos Archipelago, Scale 1:360,000
Peros Benhos Islands, which are the largest group on the Chagos Bank, has a perimeter of [tpl]convert|12|league|km[/tpl]. It consists of several groups of islets and reefs; deep channels separate them.[tpl]sfn|Tuckey|1815|pp=64-65[/tpl]

==Human geography==

In the late 18th century, coconut palm plantations were established on the island to produce copra for which slave labourers were brought in from Africa.[tpl]sfn|Haggett|2001|p=2627[/tpl] A small population lived in the archipelago, descendents of Mauritian laborers working the copra industry.[tpl]sfn|Dupont|2001|p=1120[/tpl] After an agreement was signed in 1966 between Britain and the United States, the US built a military base and forcibly evacuated all indigenous people; 1,200 from Diego Garcia, Ile du Coin, and Île Boddam were relocated to Mauritius,[tpl]sfn|Olson|Shadle|1991|p=90[/tpl] while others went to the Seychelles. In 2000, the Chagos islanders won an appeal which restored their authority to live on the islands, and they received UK citizenship in the following year. A 2008 court decision blocked their return. Further complications arose after the 2010 establishment of the world's largest marine reserve as the islanders' commercial fishing capabilities, if they returned to the archipelago, would be curtailed, thus hampering their traditional livelihood.[tpl]sfn|Russell|2012|p=269[/tpl]
