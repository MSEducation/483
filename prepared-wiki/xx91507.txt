Gold: The Final Science Fiction Collection is a 1995 collection of Isaac Asimov's stories and essays. The stories, which comprise its first half, are short pieces which had remained uncollected at the time of Asimov's death. As such, they have been criticized by some as inept or below parâ€”what the writer himself termed "minor Asimov". Likewise, the non-fiction pieces in the book's second half are not generally considered among Asimov's most significant output. Nevertheless, Gold contains some notable works. "Cal" describes a robot that wishes to write, and the title story "Gold" expresses both Asimov's admiration of King Lear and his thoughts on cinema adaptations of his own stories. The story "Gold" won a Hugo Award.
