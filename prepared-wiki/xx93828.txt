==History==

The band was formed by Dave Pino, guitarist for the rock band Waltham and then-teenage singer/guitarist Noelle LeBlanc who later formed The Organ Beats. The band was originally known as "Noelle", and released an album called "This Summer" under that name, which was later re-recorded under the name From the Attic
Damone released their first album, From The Attic, on RCA in 2003. Original lead guitarist Dave Pino left the band some time in 2004, being replaced by Mike Woods from Boston. Pino is now a member of Powerman 5000.
While working on new material, the band was dropped from its label after requesting to be released. They were quickly picked up by Island Records.
Damone released their second LP, Out Here All Night, on iTunes in early 2006, with the CD version released on May 23, 2006. Damone released their third album, Roll The Dice, in 2008.
The band's song "Revolution" is the official anthem for the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer.[ref]
