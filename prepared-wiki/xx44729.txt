===Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess===

When Kim Philby learned of Venona in 1949, he obtained advance warning that his fellow Soviet spy Donald Maclean was in danger of being exposed. The FBI told Philby about an agent cryptonymed 'Homer', whose 1945 message to Moscow had been decoded. As it had been sent from New York and had its origins in the British Embassy in Washington, Philby, who would not have known Maclean's cryptonym, deduced the sender's identity. By early 1951, Philby knew U.S. intelligence would soon also conclude Maclean was the sender, and advised Moscow to recall Maclean.[tpl]clarify|date=October 2012[/tpl]  This led to Maclean and Guy Burgess' flight to Russia in May 1951.Yuri Modin, My Five Cambridge Friends, 1994, Ballantine, p. 190–199

===Soviet espionage in Australia===

In addition to British and American operatives, Australians collected Venona intercepts at a remote base in the Outback.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] The Soviets remained unaware of this base as late as 1950.Yuri Modin, My Five Cambridge Friends, 1994, Ballantine, p. 191
The founding of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation by Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley in 1949 was considered highly controversial within Chifley's own party.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] Until then, the left-leaning Australian Labor Party had been hostile to domestic intelligence agencies on civil-liberties grounds and a Labor government founding one seemed a surprising about-face.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] But the presentation of Venona material to Chifley, revealing evidence of Soviet agents operating in Australia, brought this about. As well as Australian diplomat suspects abroad, Venona had revealed Wally Clayton (cryptonym 'KLOD'), a leading official within the Communist Party of Australia (CPA), as the chief organiser of Soviet intelligence gathering in Australia.[ref]Andrew, Christopher. "The Defence of the Realm. The Authorised History of MI5", 2008. ISBN 978-0-14-102330-4, p.371

==Public disclosure==

For much of its history, knowledge of Venona was restricted even from the highest levels of government. Senior army officers, in consultation with the FBI and CIA, made the decision to restrict knowledge of Venona within the government (even the CIA was not made an active partner until 1952). Army Chief of Staff Omar Bradley, concerned about the White House's history of leaking sensitive information, decided to deny President Truman direct knowledge of the project. The president received the substance of the material only through FBI, Justice Department, and CIA reports on counterintelligence and intelligence matters. He was not told the material came from decoded Soviet ciphers. To some degree this secrecy was counter-productive; Truman was distrustful of FBI head J. Edgar Hoover and suspected the reports were exaggerated for political purposes.
Some of the earliest detailed public knowledge that Soviet code messages from World War II had been broken came with the release of Robert Lamphere's book, The FBI-KGB War, in 1986. Lamphere had been the FBI liaison to the code-breaking activity, had considerable knowledge of Venona and the counter-intelligence work that resulted from it. MI5 assistant director Peter Wright's 1987 memoir, Spycatcher, however, was the first detailed account of the Venona project, identifying it by name and making clear its long-term implications in post-war espionage.
Many inside the NSA had argued internally that the time had come to publicly release the details of the Venona project, but it was not until 1995 that the bipartisan Commission on Government Secrecy, with Senator Moynihan as chairman, released Venona project materials. Moynihan wrote:
 
 "The secrecy system has systematically denied American historians access to the records of American history. Of late we find ourselves relying on archives of the former Soviet Union in Moscow to resolve questions of what was going on in Washington at mid-century. ... the Venona intercepts contained overwhelming proof of the activities of Soviet spy networks in America, complete with names, dates, places, and deeds."

One of the considerations in releasing Venona translations was the privacy interests of the individuals mentioned, referenced, or identified in the translations. Some names were not released because to do so would constitute an invasion of privacy.
However, in at least one case, independent researchers identified one of the subjects whose name had been obscured by the NSA.
The dearth of reliable information available to the public—or even to the President and Congress—may have helped to polarize debates of the 1950s over the extent and danger of Soviet espionage in the United States. Anti-Communists suspected many spies remained at large, perhaps including some known to the government. Those who criticized the governmental and non-governmental efforts to root out and expose communists felt these efforts were an overreaction (in addition to other reservations about McCarthyism). Public access—or broader governmental access—to the Venona evidence would certainly have affected this debate, as it is affecting the retrospective debate among historians and others now. As the Moynihan Commission wrote in its final report:
 
 "A balanced history of this period is now beginning to appear; the Venona messages will surely supply a great cache of facts to bring the matter to some closure. But at the time, the American Government, much less the American public, was confronted with possibilities and charges, at once baffling and terrifying."

The National Cryptologic Museum features an exhibit on the Venona project in its "Cold War/Information Age" gallery.

==Texas textbook controversy==

Controversy arose in 2009 over the Texas State Board of Education's revision of their high school history class curricula to suggest Venona shows Senator Joseph McCarthy to have been justified in his zeal in exposing those whom he believed to be Soviet spies or communist sympathizers.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.socialstudies.org/historians_speak_out_against_proposed_texas_textbook_changes |title=Historians speak out against proposed Texas textbook changes | National Council for the Social Studies |publisher=Socialstudies.org |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2014-02-15[/tpl] Critics assert most people and organizations identified by McCarthy were not mentioned in the Venona content and that the sources for his accusations remain largely unknown.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tfninsider.org/2009/10/29/rehabilitating-joseph-mccarthy/ |title=Rehabilitating Joseph McCarthy? |publisher=TFN Insider |date=2009-10-29 |accessdate=2014-02-15[/tpl] However, M. Stanton Evans in Blacklisted by History: The Untold Story of Senator Joe McCarthy and His Fight against America's Enemies reveals that his primary source was the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.M.

==Critical views==

A number of writers and scholars have taken a critical view of the translations released by the NSA.  A few critics, including Robert and Michael Meeropol, the sons of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, and activist lawyer William Kunstler, cast doubt on the authenticity of the Venona material, suggesting that it might have been at least in part forged.[ref]For the Meeropols' belief that the NSA "cooked" the Venona materials see 

For what is apparently the Meeropols' original statement, see 

.  For Kunstler's statement see 

[/ref]
Other critics have questioned the accuracy of the translations and the identifications of covernames that the NSA translations give.  Writers Walter and Miriam Schneir, in a lengthy 1999 review of one of the first book-length studies of the messages, object to what they see as the book’s overconfidence in the translations’ accuracy, noting that the undecrypted gaps in the texts can make interpretation difficult, and emphasizing the problem of identifying the individuals mentioned under covernames.  To support their critique, they cite a declassified memorandum, written in 1956 by A. H. Belmont, who was assistant to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover at the time.[ref]
The memo is now available on line at 
[/ref]  In the memo, Belmont discusses the possibility of using the VENONA translations in court to prosecute Soviet agents, and comes out strongly opposed to their use.  His reasons include legal uncertainties about the admissibility of the translations as evidence, and the difficulties that prosecution would face in supporting the validity of the translations.  Belmont highlights the uncertainties in the translation process, noting that the cryptographers have indicated that “almost anything included in a translation of one of these deciphered messages may in the future be radically revised.” He also notes the complexities of identifying people with covernames, describing how the personal details mentioned for covername “Antenna” fit more than one person, and the investigative process required to finally connect “Antenna” to Julius Rosenberg.  The Schneirs conclude that "A reader faced with Venona's incomplete, disjointed messages can easily arrive at a badly skewed impression."
Many of the critiques of the Venona translations have been based on specific cases.  The Schneirs' critique of the Venona documents was based on their decades of work on the case of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg.  Another critique of the Venona translations came from the late Rutgers University law professor John Lowenthal, who as a law student worked as a volunteer for Alger Hiss's defense team, and later wrote extensively on the Hiss case.[ref]
For Lowenthal's work on the Hiss case see the Alger Hiss Story website, hosted at NYU.[/ref]  Lowenthal's critique focused on one message (Venona 1822 KGB Washington-Moscow 30 March 1945),[ref]
Available at the NSA's Venona website.
[/ref] in which the comments identified the covername 'Ales' as "probably Alger Hiss."  Lowenthal raised a number of objections to this identification, rejecting it as "a conclusion psychologically motivated and politically correct but factually wrong." Lowenthal's article led to an extended debates on the 'Ales' message,[ref]
The first response to Lowenthal was 

Following this there was an extended discussion on h-net diplo list and the h-net list for the history of American communism.  For a summary of a draft response from Lowenthal (he died in 2003) see 

Another response following this was 
  This gave rise to a conference paper: 
 (archived version) 
and finally a response from Mark again (he died in 2009): 
 
[/ref] and even prompted the NSA to declassify the original Russian text.[ref]
See 
 (archived version).
[/ref] Currently Venona 1822 is the only message for which the complete decrypted Russian text has been published.
Victor Navasky, editor and publisher of The Nation, has also written several editorials highly critical of John Earl Haynes' and Harvey Klehr's interpretation of recent work on the subject of Soviet espionage. Navasky claims the Venona material is being used to “distort … our understanding of the cold war” and that the files are potential “time bombs of misinformation.”
Commenting on the list of 349 Americans identified by Venona, published in an appendix to Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America, Navasky wrote, "The reader is left with the implication— unfair and unproven— that every name on the list was involved in espionage, and as a result, otherwise careful historians and mainstream journalists now routinely refer to Venona as proof that many hundreds of Americans were part of the red spy network." Navasky goes further in his defense of the listed people and has claimed a great deal of the so-called espionage that went on was nothing more than “exchanges of information among people of good will” and that “most of these exchanges were innocent and were within the law.”
According to historian Ellen Schrecker, "Because they offer insights into the world of the secret police on both sides of the Iron Curtain, it is tempting to treat the FBI and Venona materials less critically than documents from more accessible sources. But there are too many gaps in the record to use these materials with complete confidence."
Schrecker believes the documents established the guilt of many prominent figures, but is still critical of the views of scholars such as John Earl Haynes, arguing, "complexity, nuance, and a willingness to see the world in other than black and white seem alien to Haynes' view of history."
Despite the objections raised, however, the majority of historians remain convinced of the historical value of the Venona material. Intelligence historian Nigel West believes that "Venona remains an irrefutable resource, far more reliable than the mercurial recollections of KGB defectors and the dubious conclusions drawn by paranoid analysts mesmerized by Machiavellian plots."
