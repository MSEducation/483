"Twist and Shout" is a 1961 song written by Phil Medley and Bert Berns (credited as "Bert Russell"). The song was originally titled "Shake It Up, Baby" and recorded by the Top Notes. It first became a chart hit as a cover single by The Isley Brothers. It was subsequently covered by the Beatles and released on their first album Please Please Me. The song was also covered by the Mamas & the Papas in the style of a ballad in 1967 on their album Deliver, and on a film soundtrack by Cliff Richard. It was also covered by The Tremeloes. More recently, Chaka Demus and Pliers reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart with their version in January 1994. The Who performed it throughout their career, most notably on Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970 and 1982's Who's Last. It was heavily sampled by female rap trio Salt-N-Pepa in 1988. Bruce Springsteen has played it live more than 350 times since 1973, usually at the end of his concerts.

==The Top Notes' "Shake It Up, Baby"==

In 1961, a year after Phil Spector became a staff producer at Atlantic Records, he was asked to produce a single by an up-and-coming vocal group, the Top Notes (sometimes named "Topnotes"): "Shake It Up, Baby." This was before Spector perfected his "Wall of Sound" technique, and the recording lacked all of the energy the group exhibited in its live performances.[tpl]cite web|last=Cad|first=Saint|title=Top 10 Famous Songs With Unknown Originals|url=http://listverse.com/2012/07/31/top-10-famous-songs-with-unknown-originals/|publisher=Listverse.com|accessdate=June 21, 2013[/tpl] Songwriter Bert Russell felt Spector had ruined the song, and went out to show Spector how the song should be done.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/atlantic/atlanticstory.html |title=The Atlantic Story|publisher=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=2014-03-31[/tpl]

==The Isley Brothers' version==

When the Isley Brothers decided to record the song in 1962, Russell opted to produce, and thus demonstrate to Spector what he had intended to be the "sound" of the record. The resulting recording captured the verve of an Isley Brothers performance, and became the trio's first record to reach a Top 20 position in the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.
The Isley Brothers' version, with Ronald Isley on lead vocals, was the first major hit recording of the song, peaking at No. 17 on the U.S. pop top 40 charts, and No. 2 on the US R&B charts. The song quickly became a frequently covered R&B tune in the early 1960s. According to Ronald, the song was supposed to be the b-side to the Burt Bacharach standard, "Make It Easy On Yourself", which had been a hit for Jerry Butler. When the Isleys recorded "Twist and Shout", the brothers did not think the song would do well, as they had not had a hit in the three years since "Shout" established them. To their surprise, the song became their first Top 40 hit on both the pop and R&B charts, and for a time established the group's reputation for producing fast-paced songs during their earlier career.

==The Beatles' version==

Released on the Beatles' first UK album, Please Please Me, the recording of which on February 11, 1963 was their first album session and is notable for 11 songs recorded in a mere 10 hours. "Twist and Shout", with John Lennon on lead vocals, was the last song recorded; producer George Martin knew Lennon's voice would suffer from the performance, so he left it until last, with only 15 minutes of scheduled recording time remaining.
Lennon was suffering from a cold, and was drinking milk and sucking on cough drops to soothe his throat. His coughing is audible on the album, as is the cold's effect on his voice. Even so, he produced a memorable vocal performance: a raucous, dynamic rocker. He later said his voice was not the same for a long time afterward, and that "every time he swallowed, it felt like sandpaper".The Beatles. The Beatles Anthology. Chronicle Books, LLC, 2000.
A second take was attempted, but Lennon had nothing left and it was abandoned.Ian MacDonald, "Revolution in the Head" George Martin said, "I did try a second take ... but John's voice had gone."Mark Lewisohn, The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions
Released as a single in the US on March 2, 1964, with "There's a Place" as its B-side,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.norwegianwood.org/beatles/disko/usa/usdisco.htm |title=USA Discography |publisher=Norwegianwood.org |date= |accessdate=August 21, 2011[/tpl] by Chicago-based Vee-Jay Records on the Tollie label, it reached number 2 on April 4, 1964, during the week that the top five places on the chart were all Beatles singles. (In the Cashbox singles chart for the same week, "Twist and Shout" was No. 1.) In the United States, "Twist and Shout" was the only million-selling Beatles single that was a cover record, and the only Beatles cover single to reach the Top 10 on a national record chart.  The song failed to hit #1 because the Beatles had another song occupying the top spot, "Can't Buy Me Love".
In the UK, "Twist and Shout" was released by Parlophone on an EP with three other tracks, "Do You Want to Know a Secret", "A Taste of Honey", and "There's a Place", from the Please Please Me album. Both the EP and album reached No. 1 (see Twist and Shout (EP)). In Canada, it became the title track to the second album of Beatles material to be issued by Capitol Records of Canada, on February 3, 1964.
It is regarded as one of the finest examples of British rock and roll for its vocal performance.Ian Macdonald, Revolution in the Head, p.67 The song was used as a rousing closing number on Sunday Night at the London Palladium in October 1963 and at The Royal Variety Show in November 1963, the former signalling the start of "Beatlemania"; the latter was included on the Anthology 1 compilation album in 1995. In addition, the group performed it on one of their Ed Sullivan Show appearances in February 1964.
The Beatles continued to play the song live until the end of their August 1965 tour of North America. Additionally, they recorded "Twist and Shout" on nine occasions for BBC television and radio broadcasts, the earliest of which was for the Talent Spot radio show on November 27, 1962.

===1986 recharting===

The song enjoyed a resurgence of popularity in 1986 after Matthew Broderick lip-synced to the Beatles' version of it in the film Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Coincidentally, the Rodney Dangerfield film Back to School (released two days after Ferris) also featured the song, this one sung by Dangerfield himself and patterned after the Beatles' arrangement. The use in the two films help propel the single up the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at No. 23 late that summer, giving the group their second chart single of the 1980s (the other being "The Beatles Movie Medley" in 1982). The song's seven-week run in the U.S. Top 40 in 1986, combined with its original 16-week run in 1964, makes Twist And Shout the longest-running Top 40 hit for the Beatles, at 23 weeks.  Its overall chart longevity, combined with its original four-week run at #2, statistically makes it the Beatles' second most successful single in the U.S. next to "Hey Jude".

===2010 UK chart entry===

In November 2010, 47 years after its recording, the Beatles' version of "Twist and Shout" made a debut on the UK Singles Chart.
The highest charting Beatles track in the aftermath of their new availability on iTunes, it entered the charts at #48 in the first of a two-week run.

==John Entwistle version==

The song was again done by Entwistle only this time without the Who performing. He plays with Rick Wakeman on the show Gasnet.[tpl]cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9Sc5t2wVYY |title=John Entwistle - Twist & Shout (live Gastank 1983) |publisher=YouTube |date=December 20, 2009 |accessdate=August 18, 2013[/tpl]

==Mishap's version==

Irish rock band Mishap did a live cover version on several occasions before splitting up. It was an energetic more punk rock like cover of The Beatles version.

==Brian Poole and the Tremeloes' version==

In 1962 the Decca label signed Brian Poole and the Tremeloes, a British group from Dagenham, East London, in preference to the Beatles. Both groups auditioned on the same day, and it has become legend that the Beatles were rejected by the label. Ironically, Brian Poole and the Tremeloes had no chart success until the beat boom in British rock surfaced, following the success of the Beatles. This triggered the frenzied signing of most of the popular Liverpool rock groups of that period by the major record labels, and their distinctive "sound" became known as Merseybeat. Brian Poole and the Tremeloes imitated this style, and covered "Twist and Shout" four months after the Beatles had released their version, and achieved the number four position in the UK Singles Chart.
