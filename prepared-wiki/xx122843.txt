It paid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat, barley, olives, fruit, as well as on goats, beehives and a press that was used for processing either olives or grapes. It had 54 Muslim families.Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 153, cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 365
In the late nineteenth century, the village of Bayt Nabala was described as being of moderate size, situated at the edge of a plain.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 296, cited in Khalidi, 1992, p.365
The school was founded in 1921 and had about 230 students in 1946-47.Khalidi, 1992, p. 365

===1948 war and aftermath===

On December 14, 1947 a convoy of 7 vehicles from Petah Tikva sought to relieve the Jewish settlement of Ben Shemen, which had come under siege. The convoy carried 26 soldiers from Tel Aviv, 13 auxiliary police, two residents of Ben Shemen and 7 drivers. On the way they came under fire and several men were wounded. A passing British military vehicle picked up the injured men and all 8 vehicles continued. Near Beit Nabala, they came close to an Arab Legion camp and a firefight ensued. According to Jewish sources, the Legion fired first; according to British sources, it was the Jews. The British vehicle and a police vehicle became stuck and received heavy fire. All of the wounded and most of the police were killed. In total, 13 men died. This was one of the first confirmed involvements of the Arab Legion in the fighting in Palestine.Uri Milstein, History of Israel's War of Independence, Vol II (University Press of America, 1997), pp109-111. Some sources put the death toll at 14.Sam Brewer, 'Arab Legion Force In Palestine Kills 14 Jews in Convoy,' New York Times. December 15, 1947. p.1.'Many Dead In Palestine: Jewish Convoy Attacked, Fight With Arabs', The Times, Monday, December 15, 1947; pg. 4; Issue 50944; col C.
Benny Morris writes that the village residents abandoned it on Arab orders on 13 May 1948. However, according to Walid Khalidi, this cannot be confirmed.Khalidi, 1992, p. 366
The Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the village site in 1992: "The site is overgrown with grass, thorny bushes, and cypress and fig trees. It lies on the east side of the settlement of Beyt Nechemya, due east of the road from the Lod (Lydda) airport. On its fringes are the remains of quarries and crumbled houses. Sections of walls from the houses still stand. The surrounding land is cultivated by the Israeli settlements."

==Culture==

According to the Palestinian Heritage Foundation, Beit Nabala dresses (together with those of the village of Dayr Tarif), "were usually done on cotton, velvet or kermezot silk fabric. Taffeta inserts embroidered in Bethlehem style couching-stitch in gold and silk cord were attached to the yoke, chest panel, sleeves and skirt. In the 1930s black velvet material became popular, and dresses were embroidered in couching straight on the fabric with brown or orange couching embroidery which later became famous for this area."Lydda-Ramleh Region, Palestinian Heritage Foundation
