Saint Gildard, also known as Saint Gildardus and Saint Godard, was the Bishop of Rouen from 488 to 525. He is venerated as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church, and the missal of the Sarum Rite refers to him as a confessor.[tpl]cite book|title=The Sarum Missal: In English|year=1868|publisher=Church Press Company|pages=372|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EsomAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA372[/tpl]

==Life==

Earlier versions of the Roman Martyrology contend that he was the twin brother of Saint Medard—that they were born on the same day, were consecrated bishop on the same day, and died on the same day. However, in 511 Gildard attended the First Council of Orléans, convoked by Clovis I; only in 530 was Medard consecrated. He is commemorated in Rouen, with his supposed brother.[tpl]cite book|last1=Smith|first1=William|last2=Wace|first2=Henry|title=A Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects and Doctrines, Being a Continuation of "The Dictionary of the Bible": Eaba-Hermocrates|year=1880|publisher=J.

His body was buried at St. Mary's Church in Rouen, which later was named after him. According to Butler, his body was removed during Norman incursions and moved to the Abbey of St. Medard in Soissons, where it remains.

==Cult==

That Gildard is venerated in the first place is due to the association with Medard, according to Felice Lifshitz. No cult was promoted and his relics, kept in Notre Dame (St. Mary) in suburban Rouen, languished. They were removed to the Abbey of St. Medard in Soissons precisely because of the supposed sibling connection; when the monks of St. Medard discovered this link, they argued successfully with Charles the Bald that the brothers be reunited in death. Apparently the people of Rouen were not happy to see their saint go, and made the offer that the monks of St. Medard leave them the head of Gildard, for which they would give them the head of Saint Romanus of Rouen, one of their bishops, or the entire body of Remigius of Rouen, their third archbishop.[tpl]cite book|last=Lifshitz|first=Felice|title=The Norman conquest of Pious Neustria: historiographic discourse and saintly relics, 684–1090|year=1995|publisher=PIMS|isbn=978-0-88844-122-5|pages=117|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Yt97kcWnY48C&pg=PA117[/tpl] In Soissons, Gildard "was provided for the first time with literary traditions and here his cult was promoted."[tpl]cite book|last=Lifshitz|first=Felice|title=Haskins Society Journal Studies in Medieval History|year=1990|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-1-85285-059-3|pages=63–82 66|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5eHwtkGITqMC&pg=PA66|accessdate=30 December 2010|chapter=Eight Men In: Rouennais Traditions of Archiepiscopal Sanctity[/tpl]
