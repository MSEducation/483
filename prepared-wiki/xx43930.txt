==Top grossing films (U.S.)Box Office Digest, March 1946, p.18==

Box office numbers were reported at the time as a percentage compared to 'normal' business at each theater. For example, The Bells of St. Mary's was the year's biggest hit at  241% while Mildred Pierce performed admirably at 182%. This is why exact dollar grosses for the period are unreliable at best.
