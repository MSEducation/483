As modeled in the game, the American submarine has more sophisticated electronics and more weapons.  The Soviet boat has fewer weapons but higher sustained speeds.
688 Attack Sub is known as an early classic of the genre.
John W. Ratcliff followed it up by SSN-21 Seawolf later.
This was one of the earliest games that allowed two players to play against each other over a modem (or null modem cable).

==Reception==

Computer Gaming World in 1989 gave the DOS version a positive review, noting the game was designed to be a fun game, as opposed to a realistic simulator. A 1992 survey in the magazine of wargames with modern settings gave the game two stars out of five.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=95 | title=The Modern Games: 1950 - 2000 | work=Computer Gaming World | date=June 1992 | accessdate=24 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.
