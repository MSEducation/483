Prior to the [tpl]by|1899[/tpl] season, Frank Robison, the Spiders owner, bought the St. Louis Browns, thus owning two clubs at the same time. The Browns were renamed the "Perfectos", and restocked with Cleveland talent. Just weeks before the season opener, most of the better Spiders players were transferred to St. Louis, including three future Hall of Famers: Cy Young, Jesse Burkett and Bobby Wallace.

The roster maneuvers failed to create a powerhouse Perfectos team, as St. Louis finished fifth in both 1899 and [tpl]by|1900[/tpl]. The Spiders were left with essentially a minor league lineup, and began to lose games at a record pace. Drawing almost no fans at home, they ended up playing most of their season on the road, and became known as "The Wanderers."[tpl]cite book  | last = Hittner  | first = Arthur  | authorlink = | title = Honus Wagner: The Life of Baseball's Flying Dutchman  | publisher = McFarland & Company  | series =  | year = 2003  | doi =  | isbn = 0-7864-1811-7 [/tpl] The team ended the season in 12th place, 84 games out of first place, with an all-time worst record of 20 wins and 134 losses (.130 winning percentage).Bob Diskin, Special to ESPN.com, A pitcher worthy of a trophy  Following the 1899 season, the National League disbanded four teams, including the Cleveland franchise. The disastrous 1899 season would actually be a step toward a new future for Cleveland fans the next year.
The Cleveland Infants were in the Players' League. The League was well-attended, at least in some cities, but was underfunded and its owners lacked the confidence to continue beyond the one season. There were eight teams who were star-studded; the Boston franchise won the championship. The Cleveland Infants finished with 55 wins and 75 losses.

==Franchise history==

===1894–1935: Beginning to middle===

The Grand Rapids Rustlers were founded in Michigan in 1894 and were in the Western League.  In 1900 the team moved to Cleveland and was named the Cleveland Lake Shores. Around the same time Ban Johnson changed the name of his minor league (Western League) to the American League.  In 1900 the American League was still considered a minor league.  In 1901 team was renamed the Cleveland Bluebirds when the American League broke with the National Agreement and declared itself a competing Major League.  The Cleveland franchise was among its eight charter members.
The new team was owned by coal magnate Charles Somers and tailor Jack Kilfoyl. Somers, a wealthy industrialist and also co-owner of the Boston Americans, lent money to other team owners, including Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics, to keep them and the new league afloat. Players didn't think the name "Bluebirds" was suitable for a baseball team.[tpl]cite book |title=The Team-by-Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball |last=Purdy |first=Dennis |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=Workman |location=New York City |isbn=0-7611-3943-5 |pages= [/tpl] Writers frequently shortened it to Cleveland Blues due to the players' all-blue uniforms,[ref]
</ref>  but the players didn't like this unofficial name either.[tpl]citation needed|date=October 2012[/tpl]  The players themselves tried to change the name to '''Cleveland Bronchos''' (or '''Broncos''') in [tpl]by|1902[/tpl], but this unofficial name never really caught on.<ref name="TBT"/>
The Bluebirds suffered from financial problems in their first two seasons. This led Somers to seriously consider moving to either Pittsburgh or Cincinnati. Relief came in 1902 as a result of the conflict between the National and American Leagues.  In 1901, Napoleon "Nap" Lajoie, the Philadelphia Phillies' star second baseman, jumped to the A's after his contract was capped at $2,400 per year—one of the highest-profile players to jump to the upstart AL. The Phillies subsequently filed an injunction to force Lajoie's return, which was granted by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The injunction appeared to doom any hopes of an early settlement between the warring leagues.  However, a lawyer discovered that the injunction was only enforceable in the state of Pennsylvania. Mack, partly to thank Somers for his past financial support, agreed to trade Lajoie to the then-moribund Blues, who offered $25,000 salary over three years.[tpl]cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001  | location = | pages =12–13  | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC | doi = | id= | isbn = 1-58261-376-1[/tpl]  Due to the injunction, however, Lajoie had to sit out any games played against the A's in Philadelphia.[tpl]cite book | last =Seymour | first = Harold | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Baseball | publisher = Oxford University Press, US | year =1960 | location = | pages =214–215 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=zQO-WWL1v1AC | doi = | id = | isbn =0-19-500100-1[/tpl]  Lajoie arrived in Cleveland on June 4 and was an immediate hit, drawing 10,000 fans to League Park.  Soon afterward, he was named team captain, and in 1903 the team was renamed the Cleveland Naps after a newspaper conducted a write-in contest.
Lajoie was named manager in [tpl]MLBy|1905[/tpl], and the team's fortunes improved somewhat. They finished half a game short of the pennant in 1908.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL_1908.shtml |title=1908 American League Standings |accessdate=2008-06-19 |work=Baseball-reference.com |date= [/tpl]  However, the success did not last and Lajoie resigned during the 1909 season as manager but remained on as a player.[tpl]cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001 | location = | page =319 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-58261-376-1[/tpl]
After that, the team began to unravel, leading Kilfoyl to sell his share of the team to Somers. Cy Young, who returned to Cleveland in 1909, was ineffective for most of his three remaining years[tpl]cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001 | location = | page =413 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-58261-376-1[/tpl] and Addie Joss died from tubercular meningitis prior to the 1911 season.[tpl]cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Obituary, Pitcher Joss Dead: Ill Only Few Days |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9B03E6DD1031E233A25756C1A9629C946096D6CF&oref=slogin |work=New York Times |publisher= |date=April 15, 1911 |accessdate=2008-06-20 | format=PDF[/tpl]
Despite a strong lineup anchored by the potent Lajoie and Shoeless Joe Jackson, poor pitching kept the team below third place for most of the next decade. One reporter referred to the team as the Napkins, "because they fold up so easily". In 1912 the team's name was changed to "Cleveland Molly McGuires" after the coal miners who were trying to establish a union and were regarded as "heroes". The name lasted only three years. The team hit bottom in 1914 and 1915, finishing in the cellar both years.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL_1914.shtml |title=1914 American League Standings |accessdate=2008-06-27 |work=Baseball-reference.com |date= [/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL_1915.shtml |title=1915 American League Standings |accessdate=2008-06-27 |work=Baseball-reference.com |date= [/tpl]
1915 brought significant changes to the team. Lajoie, nearly 40 years old was no longer a top hitter in the league, batting only .258 in 1914. With Lajoie engaged in a feud with manager Joe Birmingham, the team sold Lajoie back to the A's.[tpl]cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001 | location = | page =321 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-58261-376-1[/tpl]
With Lajoie gone, the Molly McGuires now needed a new nickname. Somers asked the local newspapers to come up with a new name, and based on their input, the team was renamed the Cleveland Indians.[tpl]cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001 | location = | page =23 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-58261-376-1[/tpl]  Legend has it that the team honored Louis Sockalexis when it assumed its current name in 1915. Sockalexis, a Native American, had played in Cleveland 1897–99. Research indicates that this legend is mostly untrue, and that the new name was a play on the name of the Boston Braves, then known as the "Miracle Braves" after going from last place on July 4 to a sweep in the 1914 World Series. Proponents of the name acknowledged that the Cleveland Spiders of the National League had sometimes been informally called the "Indians" during Sockalexis' short career there, a fact which merely reinforced the new name.[ref]

At the same time, Somers' business ventures began to fail, leaving him deeply in debt. With the Indians playing poorly, attendance and revenue suffered.  Somers decided to trade Jackson midway through the 1915 season for two players and $31,500, one of the largest sums paid for a player at the time.[tpl]cite book| author=Ratajczak, Kenneth| chapter=| title=The Wrong Man Out| editor=| publisher=AuthorHouse |year=2008 | isbn= 1-4343-5678-7| pages=76–77| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=h9URNmfOwFIC&pg=PA27&dq=[/tpl]
By 1916, Somers was at the end of his tether, and sold the team to a syndicate headed by Chicago railroad contractor James C. "Jack" Dunn.  Manager Lee Fohl, who had taken over in early 1915, acquired two minor league pitchers, Stan Coveleski and Jim Bagby and traded for center fielder Tris Speaker, who was engaged in a salary dispute with the Red Sox.[tpl]cite book | last =Schneider | first = Russell | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia | publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | year = 2001 | location = | pages =23–24 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=9jkqN0qu-fcC | doi = | id =  | isbn = 1-58261-376-1[/tpl]  All three would ultimately become key players in bringing a championship to Cleveland.
Speaker took over the reins as player-manager in [tpl]MLBy|1919[/tpl], and would lead the team to a championship in 1920. On August 16, the Indians were playing the Yankees at the Polo Grounds in New York. Shortstop Ray Chapman, who often crowded the plate, was batting against Carl Mays, who had an unusual underhand delivery. It was also late in the afternoon and the infield would have been in shadow with the center field area (the batters' background) bathed in sunlight. As well, at the time, "part of every pitcher's job was to dirty up a new ball the moment it was thrown onto the field. By turns, they smeared it with dirt, licorice, tobacco juice; it was deliberately scuffed, sandpapered, scarred, cut, even spiked. The result was a misshapen, earth-colored ball that traveled through the air erratically, tended to soften in the later innings, and as it came over the plate, was very hard to see."[tpl]cite book|last=Ward|first=Geoffrey C. |coauthors=Burns, Ken|title=Baseball: An Illustrated History|publisher=Knopf |year=1996|page=153|isbn=0-679-76541-7[/tpl]
In any case, Chapman did not move reflexively when Mays' pitch came his way. The pitch hit Chapman in the head, fracturing his skull. Chapman died the next day, becoming the only player to sustain a fatal injury from a pitched ball.Report of Chapman's Death, New York Times, 8/18/1920  The Indians, who at the time were locked in a tight three-way pennant race with the Yankees and White Sox,[tpl]cite web |title=Standings - Monday, Aug 16, 1920 |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/games/standings.cgi?date=1920-08-16 | publisher=Baseball-Reference.com[/tpl] were not slowed down by the death of their teammate.

In September 1920, the Black Sox Scandal came to a boil. With just a few games left in the season, and Cleveland and Chicago neck-and-neck for first place at 94–54 and 95–56 respectively,[tpl]cite web |title=CLE 1920 Cleveland Indians Schedule |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y=1920&t=CLE |work=Baseball Almanac |accessdate=2009-02-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=1920 Chicago White Sox Schedule |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y=1920&t=CHA |publisher=Baseball Almanac |accessdate=2009-02-17[/tpl] the Chicago owner suspended eight players. The White Sox lost two of three in their final series, while Cleveland won four and lost 2 in their final two series. Cleveland finished two games ahead of Chicago and three games ahead of the Yankees to win its first pennant, led by Speaker's .388 hitting, Jim Bagby's 30 victories and solid performances from Steve O'Neill and Stan Coveleski. Cleveland went on to defeat the Brooklyn Robins 5–2 in the World Series for their first title, winning four games in a row after the Robins took a 2–1 Series lead. The Series included three memorable "firsts", all of them in Game 5 at Cleveland, and all by the home team. In the first inning, right fielder Elmer Smith hit the first Series grand slam. In the fourth inning, Jim Bagby hit the first Series home run by a pitcher. And in the top of the fifth inning, second baseman Bill Wambsganss executed the first (and only, so far) unassisted triple play in World Series history, in fact the only Series triple play of any kind.
The team would not reach the heights of 1920 again for 28 years. Speaker and Coveleski were aging and the Yankees were rising with a new weapon: Babe Ruth and the home run. They managed two second-place finishes but spent much of the decade in the cellar. In 1927 Dunn's widow, Mrs. George Pross (Dunn had died in 1922), sold the team to a syndicate headed by Alva Bradley.

===1936–1946: Bob Feller enters the show===

The Indians were a middling team by the 1930s, finishing third or fourth most years. [tpl]Baseball Year|1936[/tpl] brought Cleveland a new superstar in 17-year old pitcher Bob Feller, who came from Iowa with a dominating fastball. That season, Feller set a record with 17 strikeouts in a single game and went on to lead the league in strikeouts from 1938–1941.
On August 20, 1938, Indians catchers Hank Helf and Frank Pytlak set the "all-time altitude mark" by catching baseballs dropped from the 708-foot Terminal Tower.[tpl]cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119227/index.htm |date=March 11, 1985 |title=When Baseballs Fell from On High, Henry Helf Rose to the Occasion |author=Bruce Anderson |work=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=October 20, 2013[/tpl]
By [tpl]MLBy|1940[/tpl], Feller, along with Ken Keltner, Mel Harder and Lou Boudreau led the Indians to within one game of the pennant. However, the team was wracked with dissension, with some players (including Feller and Mel Harder) going so far as to request that Bradley fire manager Ossie Vitt.
