William Bradford Shockley Jr. (February 13, 1910 – August 12, 1989) was an American physicist and inventor. Along with John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain, Shockley co-invented the transistor, for which all three were awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Shockley's attempts to commercialize a new transistor design in the 1950s and 1960s led to California's "Silicon Valley" becoming a hotbed of electronics innovation. In his later life, Shockley was a professor at Stanford and became a staunch advocate of eugenics.[tpl]cite journal|author=Sparks, Morgan; Hogan, Lester; Linville, John|title=Obituary: William Shockley|journal=Physics Today|date=June 1991|volume=44|issue=6|pages=130–132|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v44/i6/p130_s2?bypassSSO=1|doi=10.1063/1.2810155[/tpl]

==Biography==

===Early years===

Shockley was born in London, England to American parents, and raised in his family's hometown of Palo Alto, California, from age three.http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=04050875 His father, William Hillman Shockley, was a mining engineer who speculated in mines for a living, and spoke eight languages. His mother, Mary (née Bradford), grew up in the American West, graduated from Stanford University, and became the first female US Deputy mining surveyor.Broken Genius, p 4
He received his Bachelor of Science degree from the California Institute of Technology in 1932. While still a student, Shockley married Iowan Jean Bailey in August 1933. In March 1934, the couple had a baby girl, Alison.
Shockley was awarded his PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1936. The title of his doctoral thesis was Electronic Bands in Sodium Chloride, and was suggested by his thesis advisor, John C. Slater.Broken Genius, p 38 After receiving his doctorate, Shockley joined a research group headed by Clinton Davisson at Bell Labs in New Jersey. The next few years were productive ones for Shockley. He published a number of fundamental papers on solid state physics in Physical Review. In 1938, he got his first patent, "Electron Discharge Device" on electron multipliers.Broken Genius, p 48
When World War II broke out, Shockley became involved in radar research at the Bell labs in Manhattan, New York. In May 1942, he took leave from Bell Labs to become a research director at Columbia University's Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Group.Broken Genius p. 65–67  This involved devising methods for countering the tactics of submarines with improved convoying techniques, optimizing depth charge patterns, and so on. This project required frequent trips to the Pentagon and Washington, where Shockley met many high ranking officers and government officials.  In 1944, he organized a training program for B-29 bomber pilots to use new radar bomb sights. In late 1944 he took a three month tour to bases around the world to assess the results. For this project, Secretary of War Robert Patterson awarded Shockley the Medal for Merit on October 17, 1946.Broken Genius, p 85
In July 1945, the War Department asked Shockley to prepare a report on the question of probable casualties from an invasion of the Japanese mainland. Shockley concluded:
[tpl]bquote|If the study shows that the behavior of nations in all historical cases comparable to Japan's has in fact been invariably consistent with the behavior of the troops in battle, then it means that the Japanese dead and ineffectives at the time of the defeat will exceed the corresponding number for the Germans. In other words, we shall probably have to kill at least 5 to 10 million Japanese. This might cost us between 1.7 and 4 million casualties including 400,000 to 800,000 killed.[tpl]cite journal |first=D.

===Transistor===

Shortly after the end of the war in 1945, Bell Labs formed a solid state physics group, led by Shockley and chemist Stanley Morgan, which included John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, physicist Gerald Pearson, chemist Robert Gibney, electronics expert Hilbert Moore, and several technicians.  Their assignment was to seek a solid-state alternative to fragile glass vacuum tube amplifiers.  Its first attempts were based on Shockley's ideas about using an external electrical field on a semiconductor to affect its conductivity. These experiments failed every time in all sorts of configurations and materials. The group was at a standstill until Bardeen suggested a theory that invoked surface states that prevented the field from penetrating the semiconductor. The group changed its focus to study these surface states and they met almost daily to discuss the work.  The rapport of the group was excellent, and ideas were freely exchanged.Brattain quoted in Crystal Fire p. 127
By the winter of 1946 they had enough results that Bardeen submitted a paper on the surface states to Physical Review. Brattain started experiments to study the surface states through observations made while shining a bright light on the semiconductor's surface. This led to several more papers (one of them co-authored with Shockley), which estimated the density of the surface states to be more than enough to account for their failed experiments. The pace of the work picked up significantly when they started to surround point contacts between the semiconductor and the conducting wires with electrolytes. Moore built a circuit that allowed them to vary the frequency of the input signal easily.  Finally they began to get some evidence of power amplification when Pearson, acting on a suggestion by Shockley, put a voltage on a droplet of glycol borate (a viscous chemical that did not evaporate, commonly used in electrolytic capacitors, and obtained by puncturing an example capacitor with a nail, using a hammer) placed across a P-N junction.Crystal Fire p.132
Bell Labs' attorneys soon discovered Shockley's field effect principle had been anticipated and devices based on it patented in 1930 by Julius Lilienfeld, who filed his MESFET-like patent in Canada on October 22, 1925.[tpl]patent|US|1745175|"Method and apparatus for controlling electric current" first filing in Canada on 22.10.1925[/tpl]Lilienfeld[tpl]Dead link|date=August 2011[/tpl][tpl]wayback|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20021102173031/http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/~eugeniik/history/lilienfeld.htm[/tpl] Although the patent appeared "breakable" (it could not work) the patent attorneys based one of its four patent applications only on the Bardeen-Brattain point contact design. Three others (submitted first) covered the electrolyte-based transistors with Bardeen, Gibney and Brattain as the inventors. Shockley's name was not on any of these patent applications. This angered Shockley, who thought his name should also be on the patents because the work was based on his field effect idea. He even made efforts to have the patent written only in his name, and told Bardeen and Brattain of his intentions.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/William_Shockley |title=William Shockley |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=18 July 2011[/tpl]
Shockley was incensed, and decided to demonstrate who was the real brains of the operation so he secretly continued his own work to build a different sort of transistor based on junctions instead of point contacts; he expected this kind of design would be more likely to be commercially viable. The point contact transistor, he believed, would prove to be fragile and difficult to manufacture.  Shockley was also dissatisfied with certain parts of the explanation for how the point contact transistor worked and conceived of the possibility of minority carrier injection. On February 13, 1948 another team member, John N. Shive, built a point contact transistor with bronze contacts on the front and back of thin wedge of germanium, proving that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along the surface as previously thought.[tpl]rp|153[/tpl][ref]

[/ref] Shockley's invention of the junction transistor.[tpl]rp|143[/tpl] A few months later he invented an entirely new, considerably more robust, type of transistor with a layer or 'sandwich' structure. This structure went on to be used for the vast majority of all transistors into the 1960s, and evolved into the bipolar junction transistor. Shockley later admitted that the workings of the team were "mixture of cooperation and competition." He also admitted that he kept some of his own work secret until his "hand was forced" by Shive's 1948 advance. Shockley worked out a rather complete description of what he called the "sandwich" transistor, and a first proof of principle was obtained on April 7, 1949.
Meanwhile, Shockley worked furiously on his magnum opus, Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors which was finally published as a 558 page treatise in 1950. In it, Shockley worked out the critical ideas of drift and diffusion and the differential equations that govern the flow of electrons in solid state crystals. Shockley's diode equation is also described. This seminal work became the "bible" for an entire generation of scientists working to develop and improve new variants of the transistor and other devices based on semiconductors.Broken Genius, p 121-122
This resulted in his invention of the junction transistor, which was announced at a press conference on July 4, 1951.[tpl]Cite web|url = http://www.computerhistory.org/semiconductor/timeline/1951-First.html|title = 1951 - First Grown-Junction Transistors Fabricated|publisher = Computer History Museum|year = 2007|accessdate = 3 July 2013[/tpl]
In 1951, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). He was forty-one years old; this was rather young for such an election. Two years later, he was chosen as the recipient of the prestigious Comstock PrizeComstock Prize for Physics by the NAS, and was the recipient of many other awards and honors.
The ensuing publicity generated by the "invention of the transistor" often thrust Shockley to the fore, much to the chagrin of Bardeen and Brattain. Bell Labs management, however, consistently presented all three inventors as a team. Though Shockley would correct the record where reporters gave him sole credit for the invention,http://www.pbs.org/transistor/album1/shockley/shockley3.html he eventually infuriated and alienated Bardeen and Brattain, and he essentially blocked the two from working on the junction transistor. Bardeen began pursuing a theory for superconductivity and left Bell Labs in 1951. Brattain refused to work with Shockley further and was assigned to another group. Neither Bardeen nor Brattain had much to do with the development of the transistor beyond the first year after its invention.Crystal Fire p. 278

===Shockley Semiconductor===

"His way" could generally be summed up as domineering and increasingly paranoid. In one well-known incident, he claimed that a secretary's cut thumb was the result of a malicious act and he demanded lie detector tests to find the culprit.Crystal Fire p. 247
After receiving the Nobel Prize in 1956, his ego may have gotten the better of his genius, as evidenced in his increasingly autocratic, erratic and hard-to-please management style.PBS program - American Experience (2012) 'Silicon Valley' In late 1957, eight of Shockley's researchers, who would come to be known as the "traitorous eight", resigned after Shockley decided not to continue research into silicon-based semiconductors.10 Days That Changed History, By ADAM GOODHEART, Published: July 2, 2006 - NYTimes.com
Over the course of 20 years, eight of Shockley's former employees started 65 new enterprises.A Legal Bridge Spanning 100 Years: From the Gold Mines of El Dorado to the "Golden" Startups of Silicon Valley by Gregory Gromov Shockley Semiconductor and these companies formed the nucleus of what became Silicon Valley, which revolutionized the world of electronics.

===Sidelights===

Shockley was popular as speaker, lecturer, and an amateur magician.  He once magically produced a bouquet of roses at the end of his address before the American Physical Society.   He was also famed in his early years for his elaborate practical jokes.Crystal Fire p. 45
He became an accomplished rock climber, going often to the Shawangunks in the Hudson River Valley, where he pioneered a route across an overhang, known to this day as "Shockley's Ceiling."
Shockley was first to propose a lognormal distribution to model the creation process for scientific research papers.The Artful Universe by John D. Barrow, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995, p. 239  He was an atheist.Crystal Fire p. 133

===Later years===

When Shockley was eased out of the directorship of Shockley Semiconductor, he joined Stanford University, where he was appointed the Alexander M. Poniatoff Professor of Engineering and Applied Science.Crystal Fire p.277

===Statements about populations and genetics===

Late in his life, Shockley became intensely interested in questions of race, intelligence, and eugenics. He thought this work was important to the genetic future of the human species, and came to describe it as the most important work of his career, even though expressing such politically unpopular views risked damaging his reputation.  When asked why he seemed to take positions associated with both the political right and left, Shockley explained that his goal was "the application of scientific ingenuity to the solution of human problems."Shockley on Eugenics and Race p. 48
Shockley argued that the higher rate of reproduction among the less intelligent was having a dysgenic effect, and that a drop in average intelligence would ultimately lead to a decline in civilization.Shockley on Eugenics and Race p. 197 Shockley advocated that the scientific community should seriously investigate questions of heredity, intelligence, and demographic trends, and suggest policy changes if he was proven right.Shockley on Eugenics and Race p. 213
Although Shockley was concerned about dysgenic effects among both blacks and whites, he perceived the situation among blacks as more problematic.  According to the 1970 US Census, unskilled and skilled whites had on average 3.7 and 2.3 children, respectively, whereas the corresponding numbers for blacks were 5.4 and 1.9.Shockley on Eugenics and Race p. 278
He donated sperm to the Repository for Germinal Choice, a sperm bank founded by Robert Klark Graham in hopes of spreading humanity's best genes. The bank, called by the media the "Nobel Prize sperm bank," claimed to have three Nobel Prize-winning donors, though Shockley was the only one to publicly acknowledge his donation to the sperm bank. However, Shockley's controversial views brought the Repository for Germinal Choice a degree of notoriety and may have discouraged other Nobel Prize winners from donating sperm.[tpl]cite news |author=Polly Morrice |title=The Genius Factory: Test-Tube Superbabies |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/books/review/03MORRICE.html?ei=5088&en=859598b50aab62e1&ex=1278043200&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=all# |work=The New York Times |date=2005-07-03 |accessdate=2008-02-12[/tpl]
In 1981 he filed a libel suit against the Atlanta Constitution after a reporter called him a "Hitlerite" and compared his racial views to those of the Nazis. Shockley won the suit but received only $1 in damages.[tpl]cite news |first=Ronald  |last=Kessler | title=Absent at the Creation; How one scientist made off with the biggest invention since the light bulb |url=http://www1.hollins.edu/faculty/richter/327/AbsentCreation.htm [/tpl]He was represented by Murray M. Silver, Esq., Attorney at Law, Atlanta, Georgia. See Time Magazine, September 24, 1984, Page 62.

In his later years Shockley took several precautions to improve his interactions with the media, to little avail. He taped his telephone conversations with reporters, and then sent the transcript to them by registered mail. At one point he toyed with the idea of making them take a simple quiz on his work before discussing the subject with them. His habit of saving all his papers, even laundry lists, provides abundant documentation for researchers on his life.[tpl]Cite book |title=Broken Genius: The Rise and Fall of William Shockley, Creator of the Electronic Age |last=Shurkin |first=Joel |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |isbn=978-1-4039-8815-7 |laysummary=http://www.popularscience.co.uk/reviews/rev291.htm |laydate=14 August 2010 |page=286 (quoting August 1980 issue of Playboy) |ref=harv [/tpl]
