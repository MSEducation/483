==Depiction==

Born Christopher Robin Pike, April 11, 2214. According to dialogue in The Cage, he is from the city of Mojave on Earth and once owned a horse named Tango.
Pike is the second captain of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701 and the first to be shown in Star Trek canon. The animated Star Trek series reveals that Captain Robert April predated Pike, and printed Star Trek fiction and reference books also identify April as Pike's predecessor.[tpl]cite book|title=Best Destiny|last=Carey|first=Diane|publisher=Pocket Books|year=1995|isbn=0-517-13905-7[/tpl][tpl]cite book|title=The Star Trek Encyclopedia|last=Okuda|first=Mike|coauthors=Denise, Okuda with Mirek, Debbie|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-53609-5|year=1999[/tpl] Pike took command of the USS Enterprise in the year 2252, at the age of 38, taking over command from Robert April, who commanded the Enterprise for 9 years.

===The Cage===

At the beginning of The Cage, set in the year 2254, Pike and his crew are recuperating from a mission to Rigel VII during which several members of the landing party were killed by the inhabitants.[tpl]cite episode|title=The Cage|episodelink=The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|series=Star Trek|serieslink=Star Trek: The Original Series[/tpl] The incident filled Pike with so much guilt that he is considering resigning his commission.
Meanwhile, the Enterprise is en route to Vega Colony to drop off wounded crew members when it receives a distress call from the survey vessel SS Columbia, lost 18 years previously. Pike orders the ship diverted to Talos IV to rescue survivors.
Pike soon learns that all but one of the survivors are illusions created by the Talosians in order to lure the Enterprise crew to Talos IV. The Talosians make every effort to provide sexual fantasies that they hope will appeal to Pike, using Vina, the only real Columbia survivor, as the object of desire. After Pike escapes from his prison cell with the aid of his first officer, Number One, and Yeoman J.M. Colt, the Talosians reveal, to Pike, Vina's real appearance as a disfigured older woman. The Talosians saved her life after the Columbia crashed, but they had no guide on how to repair a human body. Pike requests that the Talosians restore her illusion of beauty and the Enterprise leaves Talos IV.

===The Menagerie===

At some point prior to "The Menagerie",[tpl]cite episode|title=The Menagerie|episodelink=The Menagerie (Star Trek: The Original Series)|series=Star Trek|serieslink=Star Trek: The Original Series[/tpl] Pike is promoted to fleet captain. He is severely injured while rescuing several cadets from a baffle plate rupture on board a J-class training vessel, the delta ray radiation leaving him paralyzed, mute, badly scarred, and dependent on a brainwave-operated wheelchair. His only means of communicating is through a light on the chair: one flash meaning "yes" and two flashes indicating "no".
In The Menagerie, the Enterprise, now under the command of Captain James T. Kirk, travels to Starbase 11. Spock, who had served with Pike for "eleven years, four months and five days", makes clandestine arrangements to take Pike back to Talos IV, despite travel to Talos IV being the only criminal offense still punishable by death in Starfleet. Spock is court-martialed, with evidence during the procedure including footage from "The Cage". At the two-part episode's conclusion, Pike is reunited with Vina and given the illusion of perfect health.

===Later references===

Pike is mentioned in the episode "Mirror, Mirror:" An alternate-universe version of Captain Kirk reportedly assassinated Pike to become captain of the ISS Enterprise (the Mirror Universe version of the USS Enterprise).
A brief reference to Pike occurs in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode "Tears of the Prophets;"[tpl]cite episode|title=Tears of the Prophets|episodelink=Tears of the Prophets|series=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine[/tpl] Captain Benjamin Sisko receives the "Christopher Pike Medal of Valor" for his actions during the Dominion War.
In the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "The Most Toys", the name Pike can be seen briefly on the side of the shuttlecraft Lt. Commander Data was going to pilot at the beginning of the episode.

===Reboot===

Captain Pike appears in the 2009 reboot Star Trek, this time portrayed by Bruce Greenwood. In the film, Pike encourages a young, directionless James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) to follow in the footsteps of his hero father and enlist in Starfleet.RadioFree.com: Star Trek film clip Pike is the first Captain of the USS Enterprise, with Kirk on board as a stowaway. During the Battle of Vulcan, Pike is taken prisoner by Nero (Eric Bana) and tortured for information about Earth's defenses. He is later rescued by Kirk, whom Pike also manages to save from an attacking Reman (a close cousin of the Romulan race), despite his wounds. At the end of the film, Pike is promoted to the rank of admiral and is confined to a wheelchair. Unlike his counterpart in The Menagerie, however, Pike still retains the ability to speak and to use his upper body. He proudly yields command of the Enterprise to Kirk while he recovers from his injuries, stating that Kirk's father would be proud of his actions.
Greenwood reprised his role as Pike in the next film, Star Trek Into Darkness. In the film, Pike has partially recovered from the trauma Nero inflicted, and is no longer confined to a wheelchair, although he still requires the use of a cane.http://www.trektoday.com/content/2009/11/room-for-greenwood-in-star-trek-xii/ After Kirk violates the Prime Directive to rescue Spock (Zachary Quinto), Pike briefly retakes command of the Enterprise and warns Kirk that the Admiralty is threatening to put him back into the Academy. Pike confronts Kirk about his reckless behavior and how his own actions can get those nearest to him killed. Despite his anger at Kirk, however, Pike retains him as his First Officer, sparing him from having to return to the Academy. He later explains to Kirk that he still believes in him and that he also sees a "greatness" behind his recklessness. During a meeting with the Starfleet commanders, which Kirk attends with him, Pike is killed in a terrorist attack on Starfleet by John Harrison. Pike's death incites a desire for revenge in Kirk, who seeks to hunt Harrison down, which nearly brings the Federation into a full-scale war with the Klingons. At the end of the film, a memorial service is held for Pike and all of the other people who died as a result of Khan's actions.
