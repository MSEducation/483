==Biography==

Kevin J. Anderson (aka Kevin James Anderson) was born March 27, 1962 in Racine, Wisconsin. The War of the Worlds greatly influenced him. He wrote his first story at eight years old entitled Injection. At ten, he bought a typewriter and has written ever since.
In his freshman year in high school, he submitted his first short story to a magazine, but it took two more years before one of his manuscripts was accepted. When it was accepted, they paid him in copies of the magazine. In his senior year, he sold his first story for money for $12.50.[tpl]dead link|date=May 2013[/tpl] In 1988 his first novel, Resurrection, Inc. was published.
Anderson worked at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for twelve years. There, he met Rebecca Moesta (his wife) and Doug Beason, with whom he frequently writes.
After the publishing of his first novels, Lucasfilm offered him a chance at writing Star Wars novels.
Since 1993, 47 of Anderson's novels have been in bestseller lists. He has more than 20 million books in print worldwide.
