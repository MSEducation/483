Retrieved 2 May 2014. 15 January 1912 – 20 June 1974) was an Australian professional snooker and carom billiards player.

==Career==

The son of Violet Lindrum, the sister of Walter Lindrum and an Australian women's snooker champion in her own right,"Lady Snooker Champion for London" – Port Lincoln Times, 7 November 1946. Retrieved 2 May 2014.  Lindrum made his first snooker [tpl]Cuegloss|Century break|century[/tpl] at the age of 16, and his first four-figure break at billiards – a 1,431 – at 21 years old.  At the age of 19, he won the Australian Professional Billiards Championship and three years later, the Australian Professional Snooker title.  Lindrum retained both titles for over 33 years.  He returned to professional play in 1963,[tpl]clarify|date=May 2010|reason=After retiring when?[/tpl] at the request of the Australian Billiards and Snooker Association, to aid the flagging interest in the sport in Australia and won the Australian Open Title[tpl]clarify|date=May 2010|reason=Snooker or E.B.?[/tpl] that same year.  The Australian Professional Billiards and Snooker Association published a tribute to Lindrum for doing so.
Lindrum competed and was runner-up in the World Professional Snooker title against Joe Davis five times, finally winning the title in the 1951/1952 season against reigning World Professional Billiards Champion Clark McConachy, by a score of 94–49. Lindrum described the 143-[tpl]Cuegloss|Frame|frame[/tpl] final over two weeks against McConachy as the toughest battle of his career. However, due to a boycott of the tournament by most of the game's professionals in favour of the World Matchplay competition, Lindrum's triumph is often overlooked. This was the only time an Australian would win the title until Neil Robertson's 2010 victory, 58 years after Lindrum's.
