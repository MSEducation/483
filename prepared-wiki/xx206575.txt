"T./2nd Lt. Jack Victor Sorsoleil, Gen. List, and R.F.C.
For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. While on patrol with three other scouts he engaged a hostile formation of ten scouts, driving one of these down. While climbing to rejoin his patrol he was attacked by an enemy scout, upon which he opened fire at close range, bringing it down spinning, with the result that it crashed to earth. He has also driven down one enemy machine in flames, and sent another crashing to earth, where it was destroyed. His gallantry and skill have been most conspicuous."(Supplement to the London Gazette, 22 April 1918) http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/30643/supplements/4832 Retrieved on 9 June 2010.
