CATEGORIES: Allenes

Propadiene is the organic compound with the formula H2C=C=CH2.  It is the simplest allene, a compound with conjoined C=C double bonds. [tpl]GoldBookRef | title = allenes | file = A00238[/tpl] As a constituent of MAPP gas, it was used as a fuel for specialized welding.

==Production and equilibrium with methylacetylene==

Allene exists in equilibrium with methylacetylene, the mixture sometimes being called MAPD for methylacetylene-propadiene:
for which Keq = 0.22 (270 °C) at 0.1 K (5 °C).
MAPD is produced as a side product, often an undesirable one, of cracking propane to produce propene, an important feedstock in the chemical industry.  MAPD interferes with the catalytic polymerization of propene.Klaus Buckl, Andreas Meiswinkel "Propyne" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2008, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.
