[[Given name]]

CATEGORIES: Given names

A person's given name, or in Western contexts a first name, forename or Christian name, is a part of his or her personal name and identifies and differentiates the person between members of a group, especially in a family, all of whose members usually share the same family name (surname). A given name is purposefully given, usually by a child's parents at or near birth, in contrast to an inherited one such as a family name."A name given to a person at birth or at baptism, as distinguished from a surname" â€“ according to the American Heritage Dictionary A given name is sometimes legally changed through a name change.
Given names are often used in a familiar and friendly manner in informal situations. In more formal situations the surname is more commonly used, unless it is necessary to distinguish between people with the same surname. The idiom "on a first-name basis" (or "on first-name terms") alludes to the familiarity of addressing another by a given name.
The western style of having both a family name (surname) and a given name is far from universal. In many countries it is common for people to have only one name (a mononym).

==Relationship to other names==

In most European (and Europe-derived) cultures, the given name usually comes before the family name (though generally not in lists and catalogs), and is also known as a forename or first name; but the family name traditionally comes first in Hungary, parts of Africa and most of East Asia (e.g., China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam). In China and Korea, even part of the given name may be shared among all members of a given generation in a family and the family's extensions, to differentiate those generations from other generations.
Under the common Western naming convention, people generally have one or more forenames (either given or acquired). If more than one, there is usually a main forename (for everyday use) and one or more supplementary forenames; but sometimes two or more carry equal weight. Beyond preceding the surname there is no particular ordering rule for forenames. Often the main forename is at the beginning, resulting in a first name and one or more middle names, but other arrangements are quite common.
The term Christian name is often used as a general synonym for given name. Strictly speaking, the term applies to a name formally given to a child at an infant baptism or "christening".[tpl]Citation|last=Thurston|first=Herbert|title=Christian Names|year=1911|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|publication-place=New York|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10673c.htm|accessdate=May 30, 2012[/tpl]

==Legality==

A child's given name or names are usually given by the parents soon after birth. In most jurisdictions, the name at birth is a matter of public record, inscribed on the birth certificate or equivalent. In some jurisdictions, mainly civil-law jurisdictions such as France, Quebec, the Netherlands or Germany, a government appointed registrar of births may refuse to register a name that may cause him or her harm or which may be offensive. In France, the agency can refer the case to a local judge.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2007[/tpl] Even spell-checking of the name is done. In 1996, in protest of Swedish naming laws, two parents attempted to name their child Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116,http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6525475.stm claiming that it was "a pregnant, expressionistic development that we see as an artistic creation."
People born in one country who immigrate to another with different naming conventions may have their names legally changed.http://www.uscis.gov/files/pressrelease/NamingCnv091305.pdf If the name is not assigned at birth it may be assigned at a naming ceremony with families and friends attending.

==Origins and meanings==

Parents may choose a name because of its meaning.  This may be a personal or familial meaning, such as giving a child the name of an admired person, or it may be an example of nominative determinism, in which the parents give the child a name that they believe will be lucky or favorable for the child. Given names most often derive from the following categories:
