Walther Rathenau (September 29, 1867 – June 24, 1922) was a German industrialist, politician, writer, and statesman who served as Foreign Minister of Germany during the Weimar Republic.  He was assassinated on June 24, 1922, two months after the signing of the Treaty of Rapallo, 1922.

He studied physics, chemistry, and philosophy in Berlin and Strasbourg.

==Career==

===World War===

During the World War Rathenau held senior posts in the Raw Materials Department of the War Ministry, while becoming chairman of AEG upon his father's death in 1915. Rathenau played the key role in convincing the War Ministry to set up the War Raw Materials Department (Kriegsrohstoffabteilung - 'KRA'); he was in charge of it from August 1914 to March 1915 and established the basic policies and procedures.  His senior staff were on loan from industry. KRA focused on raw materials threatened by the British blockade, as well as supplies from occupied Belgium and France. It set prices and regulated the distribution to vital war industries. It began the development of ersatz raw materials. KRA suffered many inefficiencies caused by the complexity and selfishness KRA encountered from  commerce, industry, and the government.D. G.  Williamson, "Walther Rathenau and the K.R.A. August 1914-March 1915," Zeitschrift für Unternehmensgeschichte (1978)  Issue 11, pp 118-136.

===Postwar===

Rathenau was a moderate liberal in politics, and after World War I he was one of the founders of the German Democratic Party (DDP). He rejected the tide of socialist thought which swept Germany after the shock of defeat and revolution, opposing state ownership of industry and advocating greater worker participation in the management of companies. His ideas were influential in post-war governments.
In 1921, Rathenau was appointed Minister of Reconstruction, and in 1922 he became Foreign Minister. His insistence that Germany should fulfill its obligations under the Treaty of Versailles, while working for a revision of its terms, infuriated extreme German nationalists. He also angered such extremists by negotiating the Treaty of Rapallo, 1922 with the Soviet Union, although the treaty implicitly recognized secret German-Soviet collaboration, begun in 1921, which provided for the rearmament of Germany, including German aircraft manufacturing, inside the Soviet union.Angela E. Stent, Russia and Germany Reborn, 1998, Princeton. ch. 1, http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s6426.html The leaders of the (still obscure) Nazi Party and other extreme right-wing groups falsely claimed he was part of a "Jewish-Communist conspiracy", despite his being a liberal German nationalist who had bolstered the country's recent war effort.
The British politician Robert Boothby wrote of him: "He was something that only a German Jew could simultaneously be: a prophet, a philosopher, a mystic, a writer, a statesman, an industrial magnate of the highest and greatest order, and the pioneer of what has become known as 'industrial rationalization'."
In fact, despite his desire for economic and political co-operation between Germany and the Soviet Union, Rathenau remained skeptical of the methods of the Soviets. In his Kritik der dreifachen Revolution (Critique of the triple revolution) he noted that:

===Ideology===

A strong German nationalist,Tom Reiss, The Orientalist, 2005, Random House. p. 181f. "Though not a convert to Christianity, Rathenau represented a Jewish apostasy more typical of his time: the conversion to Wagnerian-Teutonism." Rathenau was a leading proponent of a policy of assimilation for German Jews; he argued that Jews should oppose both Zionism and socialism and fully integrate themselves into mainstream German society. This, he said, would lead to the eventual disappearance of antisemitism. As a powerful, affluent and highly visible German Jewish politician, Rathenau was hated by Germany's extreme right, despite himself being a German nationalist.  In spite of his stated beliefs, he was assassinated in 1922 by right wing elements within Germany.Robert A. Pois, "Walther Rathenau's Jewish Quandary," Leo Baeck Institute Year Book (1968), Vol. 13, pp 120-131.

==Assassination and aftermath==

On June 24, 1922, two months after the signing of the Treaty of Rapallo which renounced German territorial claims from World War I, Rathenau was assassinated. On this Saturday morning, Rathenau had himself chauffeured from his house in Grunewald to the Foreign Office in Wilhelmstrasse. During the trip his car was passed by a car with Ernst Werner Techow behind the wheel and Erwin Kern and Hermann Fischer on the backseats. Kern opened fire with a MP 18-submachine gun at close range, killing Rathenau almost instantly, while Fischer threw a hand grenade into the car before Techow quickly drove them away.[tpl]citation|author=Martin Sabrow|title=Der Rathenaumord.

All conspirators were members of the ultra-nationalist secret Organisation Consul (O.C.).[tpl]citation|author=Martin Sabrow|title=Der Rathenaumord.

The crime itself was soon cleared up. Willi Günther had bragged about his participation in public. After his arrest on June 26 he confessed to the crime without holding anything back. left|thumb|Memorial service for Rathenau, June 1923
When in October 1922 the crime was brought to court, Ernst Werner Techow was the only defendant charged with murder. Twelve more defendants were arraigned on various charges.  Ahead of his assassination Rathenau had indeed been the frequent target of vicious antisemitic attacks, and the assassins had also been members of the violently antisemitic Deutschvölkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund. Kern had, according to Ernst Werner Techow, argued that Rathenau had to be murdered, because he had intimate relations with Bolshevik Russia, so that he had even married off his sister with the Communist Karl Radek and that Rathenau himself had confessed to be one of the three hundred "Elders of Zion" as described in the notorious antisemitic forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.Ernst von Salomon has later claimed that Kern's argument was merely pretextual. Historian Norman Cohn believes that Techow's evidence stands. Cohn, Norman (1967). Warrant for Genocide: The Myth of the Jewish World Conspiracy and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, New York: Harper & Row, p. 145-6. But the defendants vigorously denied that they had killed Rathenau because he was Jewish.[tpl]citation|author=Martin Sabrow|title=Die verdrängte Verschwörung: der Rathenau-Mord und die deutsche Gegenrevolution|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KZkiAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 July 2012|year=1999|publisher=Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag|location=Frankfurt am Main|isbn=978-3-596-14302-3|page=184[/tpl]; [tpl]citation|author=Martin Sabrow|title=Die Macht der Mythen: Walther Rathenau im öffentlichen Gedächtnis: sechs Essays|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y-iMAAAACAAJ|accessdate=28 July 2012|year=1998|publisher=Das Arsenal|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-931109-11-0|pages=75–76|chapter=Die Macht der Erinnerungspolitik[/tpl]
For the time being the reactions upon Rathenau's assassination strengthened the Weimar Republic. The most notable reaction was the enactment of the Republikschutzgesetz (Law for the Defense of the Republic) taking effect on July 22, 1922. The Deutschlandlied was made the German national anthem. As long as the Weimar Republic existed, the date June 24 remained a day of public commemorations. In public memory Rathenau's death increasingly appeared to be a martyr-like sacrifice for democracy.[tpl]citation|author=Martin Sabrow|editor=Alexander Demandt|title=Das Attentat in der Geschichte|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vjDZAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=27 July 2012|year=1996|publisher=Böhlau|location=Cologne|isbn=978-3-412-16795-0|pages=336–337|chapter=Mord und Mythos. Das Komplott gegen Walther Rathenau 1922[/tpl]
Things changed with the Nazi seizure of power. The Nazis systematically wiped out public commemoration of Rathenau by destroying monuments to him, closing the Walther-Rathenau-Museum in his former mansion, and renaming streets and schools dedicated to him. Instead a memorial plate to Kern and Fischer was solemnly unveiled at Saaleck castle in July 1933 and in October 1933 a monument was erected on the assassins' grave.[tpl]citation|author=Martin Sabrow|title=Die Macht der Mythen: Walther Rathenau im öffentlichen Gedächtnis: sechs Essays|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y-iMAAAACAAJ|accessdate=28 July 2012|year=1998|publisher=Das Arsenal|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-931109-11-0|pages=90–91|chapter=Erstes Opfer des "Dritten Reichs"?[/tpl]
