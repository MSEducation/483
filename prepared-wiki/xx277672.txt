==Plot==

Nathan (Brian Quinn) and Laura (Ellen Feiss), a young American couple, travel to France on holiday to search for Baptiste (Rúaidhrí Conroy), an old friend of Nathan's who has inherited a castle in the Dordogne region of France; Nathan's motivations for the trip aren't clear, but Laura's presence is more than fortuitous.
Whilst walking through a forest on the way to the castle, they find a bizarre banquet with Baptiste and his French friends there, however he does not appear to recognise Nathan. He and the other guests at the table torment Nathan into leaving, preventing him from seeing Baptiste seduce Laura. Nathan and Laura's relationship is strained in the strange world Baptiste has created in the castle.

The film's directors had seen Ellen Feiss in a popular Apple commercial which had become an Internet phenomenon, and hoped her internet star power would boost the film's popularity. They contacted Feiss in June 2005 during her last year of high school, offering her a role in the movie, despite her having no formal acting experience. Feiss initially rejected the offer, as they had obtained her number illegitimately. She eventually agreed to do the unpaid role, although her flight and housing were paid for.Where are they now?
