==History==

thumb|right|The company is based at this building in Hove.A Mr Loadsman established the firm in 1919, operating out of a building in Blatchington Road in Hove.  He died soon afterwards, and the business was left to his employees Oliver Cox and William Barnard.  They renamed the company and moved to new offices at Old Shoreham Road.  The premises were later extended, giving a design studio at the front and an extra storey above.[tpl]Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=vol. 3, p. 117.[/tpl]  In 1968, the firm bought the former Livingstone Road Baths building from Hove Council and converted it into a new office.  The building's former use was commemorated by an elaborate stained glass window designed in-house and displayed near the entrance: it depicted three old-fashioned metal baths, a variety of people bathing or carrying supplies, and a coal-fired boiler with its copper pipework.[tpl]Harvnb|Middleton|2002|loc=vol. 3, p. 118.[/tpl]  The company continues to operate from the premises, which combine design and manufacturing facilities and a showroom which is open to the public.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.coxandbarnard.co.uk/find.asp|title=Find Cox & Barnard|year=2008|publisher=Cox & Barnard Ltd|accessdate=22 September 2011[/tpl]
Cox & Barnard received many commissions in the Brighton and Hove area, for both religious and secular buildings.  Many of the interwar semi-detached houses in the Nevill Road area of Hove have Art Nouveau-style leaded light panels and roundels in their doors and porches; and the Metropole, Brighton's largest hotel,[tpl]Harvnb|Collis|2010|p=200.[/tpl] had some stained glass installed during its postwar reconstruction.  The firm designed a glazed canopy at the entrance of the former Hove Town Hall (destroyed by fire in 1966), featuring the design of the Hove coat of arms; in 1946 they installed a window in the tower of the medieval parish church of Portslade, St Nicolas' Church; and in the late 20th century they designed stained glass windows for two synagogues in Hove and restored the windows in the 19th-century Middle Street Synagogue in Brighton.
Most of the firm's work has been done elsewhere in southeast England for Anglican and Roman Catholic churches—either in the company's own name or in the name of an individual designer working for them.  One commission also came from outside England.  In the early 1940s, Major Rev. Harold Appleyard, an army chaplain from The Royal Regiment of Canada, started collecting fragments of stained glass from church windows destroyed by World War II bombing.  He had already accumulated shards from more than 100 damaged churches in countries across Europe when in 1944, immediately after 40 soldiers from the regiment died at Louvigny, he found a piece of bright red glass from the French town's bombed church.  This inspired him to turn his collection of fragments into a window to commemorate them and other victims of the war.[tpl]cite journal|last=Avery|first=Roberta|date=November–December 1998|title=War and Pieces|journal=Canadian Geographic|publisher=Royal Canadian Geographical Society|location=Ottawa|url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/nd98/feature_warPieces.asp|accessdate=24 September 2011[/tpl]  He had already spent part of his tour of duty in England (his glass collection included shards from Coventry Cathedral, St James's Church in Dover and several of Christopher Wren's London churches), and after the war he returned to the country to find a stained glass manufacturer that could create a window from the hundreds of fragments—preferably using the old-fashioned technique of using sawdust as a drying agent.  He approached Cox & Barnard, and their designers were able to produce six mosaic-style windows; these were shipped to Canada and taken to Appleyard's parish church—Christ Church Anglican in Meaford, Ontario—where they were installed and dedicated in 1946 in a ceremony broadcast in Britain and Canada.

The firm's work in Staplehurst's parish church consists of six windows supplied in 1952 and designed by Owen Jennings.
