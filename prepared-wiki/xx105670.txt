==History==

The company was founded in 1926 in Switzerland as Südelektra, an infrastructure and electricity projects concern operating in Latin America. In 1990, Marc Rich + Co AG became its majority shareholder. In the 1990s it diversified into mining and disposed of its non-core businesses.
It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2002 at which time it acquired Glencore's coal assets in Australia and South Africa.
In 2003, it doubled in size with the A$2.9 billion takeover of Australian copper, zinc and lead miner MIM Holdings.[ref]

In 2004 Xstrata closed its recently purchased Windimurra Vanadium plant in Western Australia which had the effect of increasing Vanadium prices received for Xstrata's other Vanadium mines around the world.  Many hundreds of people were put out of work and now many Western Australians are not keen to see Xstrata involved in other mining activities in the state because of this action.[tpl]Cite web|author=Switzerland |url=http://www.xstrata.com/media/news/2004/05/10/0001CET/ |title=Media Centre > News > release |publisher=Xstrata |accessdate=19 April 2011[/tpl]
In August 2005, Xstrata purchased a 19.9% stake in Falconbridge Limited, a diversified Canadian mining company producing copper, nickel, aluminum, lead and zinc. Following a contested take-over battle with Inco Limited, Xstrata successfully acquired the remaining 80.1% of Falconbridge in August 2006.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4794173.stm |title=Xstrata wins Falconbridge battle |publisher=BBC News |date=15 August 2006 |accessdate=19 April 2011[/tpl]
In 2006, The Northern Territory and Australian Governments approved the expansion of the McArthur River zinc mine, near the popular fishing destination of Borrooloola. The expansion involves diversion of the river to a new 5.5 km channel, to allow construction of a massive open-cut pit in the existing river.
On behalf of the Traditional Owners of the region – the Yanyuwa, Mara, Garrawa and Gurdanji peoples – the Northern Land Council launched a legal challenge to the Northern Territory Government’s decision to approve the mining of and diversion of the McArthur River. On 1 May 2007, The Northern Territory Supreme Court ruled in favour of the Northern Land Council to stop the expansion. On 3 May 2007, the Northern Territory government rushed through retrospective legislation to overrule the court decision and allow the open-cut mine to proceed.
On 28 May 2012 violent repression of local residents by the police in the province of Espinar, Cuzco, Peru, caused the deaths of two civilians. The inhabitants protested against the pollution of the water sources caused by Xstrata's mining activities.[tpl]cite web|title = Clashes over Xstrata mine in Peru leave two dead | url = http://dawn.com/2012/05/29/clashes-over-xstrata-mine-in-peru-leave-two-dead/[/tpl] The government has decreed a State of Emergency and suspended civil liberties guaranteed in the Constitution.
On 2 May 2013 it was acquired by Glencore.

This included the setting up of a local action group in opposition to the mine named WAG (Wybong Action Group).[tpl]Cite web|url=http://wag.org.au/about/ |title=Wybong Action Group |publisher=Wag.org.au |accessdate=19 April 2011[/tpl]

In June 2012, following a previous announcement of a merger between Glencore and Xstrata, the two companies began to reconsider the proposed retention package for their merger, due to shareholder opposition to a huge payout for executives. In total, 73 key executives stood to receive over GBP 170 million under the initial retention package.
  
In July 2012, Xstrata PLC announced that the Court Meeting originally scheduled for July 12, 2012 to approve the details of the merger between Xstrata and Glencore had been adjourned to September 7, 2012.
 After the merger with Glencore, the Xstrata CFO Trevor Reid announced that he would not continue to work as employee but as consultant. After 11 years of involvement, this marks a massive shift in the company's strategy and the group is entering a post-Reid era.Xstrata/Glencore Have to Get On Without CFO Trevor Reid CFO Insight Magazine.
