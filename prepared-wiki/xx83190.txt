Bromocriptine (INN; trade names Parlodel, Cycloset, Brotin (Pakistan)), an ergoline derivative, is a dopamine agonist that is used in the treatment of pituitary tumors, Parkinson's disease (PD), hyperprolactinaemia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.

==Indications==

Amenorrhea, female infertility, galactorrhea, hypogonadism, and acromegaly may all be caused by pituitary problems, such as hyperprolactinaemia, and therefore, these problems may be treated with this drug. Bromocriptine has completely treated gestational macromastia eliminating the need for reduction surgery, in a recent case.[tpl]cite journal | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3062818/ | title=Gestational gigantomastia with complete resolution in a Nigerian woman | author=Ezem, Osuagwu, Opara | journal=BMJ |date=February 2011 | doi=10.1136/bcr.01.2010.2632[/tpl]Since the late 1980s it has been used, off-label, to reduce the symptoms of cocaine withdrawal.AJ Giannini, P Baumgartel, LR DiMarzio.

In 2009, bromocriptine mesylate was approved by the FDA for treatment of type 2 diabetes under the trade name Cycloset (VeroScience). It is currently unknown how this drug improves glycemic control, but it has been shown to reduce HbA1c by ~0.5 percentage points.[tpl]cite journal |author=Pijl H, Ohashi S, Matsuda M, et al. |title=Bromocriptine: a novel approach to the treatment of type 2 diabetes |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=23 |issue=8 |pages=1154–61 |date=August 2000 |pmid=10937514 |doi= 10.2337/diacare.23.8.1154|url=[/tpl]

==Pharmacology==

Bromocriptine is a potent agonist at dopamine D2 receptors[tpl]pmid|20138024[/tpl] and various serotonin receptors. It also inhibits the release of glutamate, by reversing the glutamate GLT1 transporter.
Bromocriptine agonizes the following monoamine receptors:National Institute ofMental Health. PDSD Ki Database (Internet) 2013 Jul 24. ChapelHill (NC): University of North Carolina. 1998-2013. Available from: http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/pdsp.php

==Side effects==

Most frequent side effects are nausea, orthostatic hypotension, headaches, and vomiting through stimulation of the brainstem vomiting centre.[tpl]cite pmid|3516579[/tpl] Bromocriptine can cause worsening of liver problems. Vasospasms with serious consequences such as myocardial infarction and stroke that have been reported in  connection with the puerperium, appear to be extremely rare events.[tpl]cite pmid|8691994[/tpl]  Peripheral vasospasm (of the fingers or toes) can cause Raynaud's Phenomenon. 
Bromocriptine use has been anecdotally associated with causing or worsening psychotic symptoms (its mechanism is in opposition of most antipsychotics, whose mechanisms generally block dopamine).[tpl]cite pmid|7701022 [/tpl]
Pulmonary fibrosis has been reported when bromocriptine was used in high doses for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.[tpl]cite pmid|2129961[/tpl]

==Chemistry==

Like all ergopeptides, bromocriptine is a cyclol; two peptide groups of its tripeptide moiety are crosslinked, forming the >N-C(OH)Bromocriptine, 2-bromoergocriptine, is a semisynthetic derivative of a natural ergot alkaloid, ergocriptin (a derivative of lysergic acid), which is synthesized
by bromination of ergocriptin using N-bromosuccinimide.
