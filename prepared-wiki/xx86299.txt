CATEGORIES: Lists of treaties, Treaties of the United States

This is a list of treaties to which the United States has been a party or which have had direct relevance to U.S. history.

==Pre-Revolutionary War treaties==

Although the United States as such is not a party to these, having not come into legal existence until 1776, these treaties have pre-existing force upon the United States entering into legal existence and are the basis of the framework setting up the United States legal framework regarding Treaties.

==U.S. international treaties==

These are treaties which the United States has made with other sovereign international states. This is mostly to distinguish them from the next category. Under the treaty clause of the United States Constitution, treaties come into effect upon final ratification by the President of the United States, provided that a two-thirds majority of the United States Senate concurs.[ref]However, not all international agreements are considered to be treaties requiring Senate concurrence. This is explained somewhat in a letter from U.S. Ambassador Thomas C. Hubbard to Philippine Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago in connection with the RP-US Vishe other countries, derives from the President's responsibilities for the conduct of foreign relations (Art. II, Sec. 1) and his constitutional powers as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. Senate advice and consent is not needed, inter alia, because the VFA and similar agreements neither change US domestic nor require congressional appropriation of funds. It is important to note that only about five percent of the international agreement entered into by the US Governments require Senate advice and consent.". The letter is quoted in full in Footnote 42 of
