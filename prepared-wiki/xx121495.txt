Aleksandar Vrteski (sometimes spelt Aleks) ([tpl]lang-mk|Александар Вртески[/tpl]) (born 28 September 1988 in Karratha, Western Australia) is a football goalkeeper who plays for Stirling Lions.

==Club career==

Having been involved with Perth Glory's former youth development scheme, Future Glory, in the past, Vrteski was invited by technical manager, Mich d'Avray, to train with the first team as part of the Pathway to Glory initiative midway through 2005. Vrteski was signed from the Australian Institute of Sport and was the youngest player in the A-League for the 2006-07 season.   
In October 2006, Aleks became the club's first choice goalkeeper for the 06/07 season for the first few rounds but was replaced by Jason Petkovic. Petkovic suffered a season (and possibly career) ending injury in Round Nine and Vrteski was a starter for a few more games until the club signed Tommi Tomich who replaced Vrteski in the starting line-up. Vrteski made a move overseas to play for Macedonian club FK Pobeda in 2007 and returned to Australia to sign for Perth Glory for the second time in his career in 2009 where he played as a backup to Tando Velaphi.Perth Glory regain promising goalkeeper Aleks VrteskiGlory add Vrteski to the ranks
