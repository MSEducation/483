In 2002 Credit Action transferred its financial advice helpline to CCCS as demand was greater than Credit Action could meet.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2008[/tpl] They have been known to make a stand for consumers where they believe that they are being exploited by unfair lending practices. A prime example of this is the campaign launched in May 2008 criticizing illegal credit advertisements on social networking sites.[tpl]cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7395344.stm | work=BBC News | title=Facebook users warned about ads | date=2008-05-12 | accessdate=2010-04-30[/tpl]
