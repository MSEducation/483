==Day of the Youth Movement==

The "Day of the Youth Movement" ([tpl]lang-nl|Dag van de jeugdbeweging[/tpl]) is an event of the youth movement organisations in Flanders, Belgium.
All youth movement organisations stimulate their members to wear their uniforms to work, school, on the train, or wherever you happen to go. That's the basic concept. In addition, breakfast is given to those who present themselves in their uniform, flags raised, some statues are dressed in uniforms,...
Originating in Flanders, the 10th edition (2009) also took place in Wallonia. During the years, the advertising for the event always paid attention to the different uniforms from the organisations.
