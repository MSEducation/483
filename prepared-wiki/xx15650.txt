Newcastle Brown Ale is a brown ale, originally produced in Newcastle Upon Tyne but now brewed by Heineken at the John Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire.
Launched in 1927 by Colonel Jim Porter after three years of development, the merger of Newcastle Breweries with Scottish Brewers afforded the beer national distribution and United Kingdom sales peaked in the early 1970s.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/curds/assets/documents/FinalInauguralLectureBooklet-Origination.pdf |title=Origination: How brands are capturing the power of place and why it matters |author=Andy Pike |date=10 November 2010 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=29 May 2012[/tpl] The brand underwent a resurgence in the late 1980s-early 1990s with a cult revival in student unions. By the late 1990s, the beer was the most widely distributed alcoholic product in the UK. By the 2000s, the majority of sales were in the United States, although it still sells 100 million bottles annually in the UK.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2680437/Newkie-Broon-leaves-Toon.html | location=London | work=The Sun | first=Steve | last=Hawkes | title=Newkie Broon leaves Toon | date=13 October 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.newcastlebrownale.co.uk/ |title=Newcastle Brown Ale |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=29 May 2012[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=May 2012[/tpl] In 2005, brewing moved from Newcastle upon Tyne to Dunston, Tyne and Wear and in 2010 to Tadcaster, North Yorkshire.
Newcastle Brown Ale is perceived in the UK as a working man's beer, with a long association with heavy industry, the traditional economic staple of the North East of England. Ironically, in export markets it is seen as a trendy, premium import and is predominantly drunk by the young. It was one of the first beers to be distributed in a clear glass bottle and it is most readily associated with this form of dispense in the UK, being very rarely seen on draught.

==History==

===Tyne Brewery, Newcastle===

Newcastle Brown Ale was originally created by Lieutenant Colonel James ('Jim') Herbert Porter (b. 1892, Burton upon Trent), a third generation brewer at Newcastle Breweries, in 1927. Porter had served in the North Staffordshire Regiment in the First World War earning his DSO with Bar before moving to Newcastle. Porter had refined the recipe for Newcastle Brown Ale alongside chemist Archie Jones over a period of three years.[tpl]cite news|last=Jenkins|first=Dan|title=CITY'S STAR HAS FALLEN|accessdate=12 September 2012|newspaper=The Northern Echo|date=28 May 2005[/tpl] When Porter actually completed the beer he believed it to be a failure, as he had actually been attempting to recreate Bass ale.http://s3.amazonaws.com/cuttings/cuttingpdfs/9793/113_FEATURE%202_NEWCASTLE%20BROWN.pdf The original beer had an original gravity of 1060º and was 6.25 ABV,Whitbread Gravity book held at the London Metropolitan Archives, document number LMA/4453/D/02/001 and it sold at a premium price of 9 shillings for a dozen pint bottles.
Newcastle Brown Ale went into production at Tyne Brewery in 1927, with Newcastle Breweries having occupied the site since 1890, with brewing on the site dating back to 1868.

Rival brewer Vaux of Sunderland quickly developed Double Maxim to compete.
After the merger of Scottish Brewers with Newcastle Breweries in 1960, Newcastle Brown Ale became a flagship brand of Scottish & Newcastle alongside McEwan's Export and Younger's Tartan Special.
By 1997 Scottish and Newcastle claimed that it was the most widely distributed alcoholic product in both pubs and off licences in the country.The Evening Standard (London)  12 February 1997 Wednesday  'NEWKY' ON TAP SECTION: D; Pg. 21

===Move to Federation Brewery, Gateshead===

Despite investing £16.5 million in a new bottling plant at the Tyne Brewery in 1999,[tpl]cite news|first=p17|title=Bobby opens Geordie bubbly|accessdate=12 September 2012|newspaper=THE JOURNAL (Newcastle, UK)|date=1 December 1999[/tpl] Scottish and Newcastle announced its closure on 22 April 2004, in order to consolidate the brewing of beer and ale in the Federation Brewery site in Dunston, Gateshead, which was to pass to them with their £7.2m purchase of the Federation Brewery. The purchase and consolidation at Dunston created the new brewing company, Newcastle Federation Breweries.
The last production run of Brown Ale in Newcastle came off the Tyne Brewery line in May 2005. Pre-production trial brews were conducted at Dunston to ensure there was no change in its taste after the move.
The Tyne Brewery site was bought by a consortium of Newcastle University, Newcastle City Council and the regional development agency One NorthEast, as part of the wider Newcastle Science City project. Demolition of the former brewery began on 8 March 2007. The triggering of the controlled demolition of the former Barrack Road bottling plant opposite St James' Park was ceremonially performed by Sir Bobby Robson on 23 June 2008.

===Move to John Smith's Brewery, Tadcaster===

Bottling of Newcastle Brown Ale moved to the John Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, in 2007.

On 13 October 2009, Scottish & Newcastle announced that it planned to close the Dunston brewery in 2010, moving production of Brown Ale to the John Smiths Brewery in Tadcaster. The company cited the general fall in the market for beer, over-capacity in its plants in general, and the fact that the Dunston site was currently operating at just 60% capacity — despite the fact that sales of Newcastle Brown Ale had never been higher — as reasons for the closure. The plan to close the brewery by the end of May 2010 was confirmed on 21 April 2010.

==Names and phrases==

In 2000, the beer was renamed "Newcastle Brown" with the "Ale" being removed from the front label. This change, only in the UK, was due to market research claiming that the term "ale" was outdated and costing the company sales in the youth drinking markets. The older name was reinstated with no fanfare in 2004, when it was realised that the change had made no difference to sales.
In the North East, Newcastle Brown Ale is often given the nickname "Dog", alluding to the British euphemism of seeing a man about a dog.[tpl]cite news |title=Last orders |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/last-orders-1466093 |newspaper=Evening Chronicle |date=25 January 2008 |accessdate=9 April 2013[/tpl] It is also known as Broon; 'brown', as pronounced in the Geordie dialect. Elsewhere in the UK it is known as 'Newkie Brown'.

==Serving==

Newcastle Brown Ale is traditionally sold in Britain in [tpl]convert|1|imppt|ml USoz|0|abbr=out[/tpl] and, more recently, [tpl]convert|550|ml|imppt|abbr=on[/tpl] bottles. Typically the ale is consumed from a [tpl]convert|12|impoz|ml USoz|abbr=on[/tpl] Wellington glass.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2012[/tpl] This allows the drinker to regularly top-up the beer and thereby maintain a frothy "head." In the United States, it is sold in [tpl]convert|12|USoz|ml|abbr=on[/tpl] servings. In April 2010, Heineken USA introduced the Wellington glass, branded as the "Geordie Schooner," for Newcastle Brown Ale consumers in America. The glass features a nucleated base.[tpl]cite news| url=http://blogs.forbes.com/booze/2010/05/17/meet-the-geordie-schooner/| work=Forbes | first=David M. | last=Ewalt[/tpl]

==Association with the North East==

Like many British breweries, Newcastle Brown is strongly associated with its local area, in this case north east England. While the name provides a lot of this, the sponsorship of Newcastle United, the depiction of the River Tyne in the blue star and mentioning in programmes such as Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads have helped ensure its association. Its local provenance gave the brand an association with "hardy, working class traditions and values".
Under the European Union Protected Geographical Status laws introduced in 1992, the name Newcastle Brown Ale was granted protected brand status in February 2000. In late 2007 this was removed when brewing of the beer moved wholly away from its place of origin to Tadcaster in Yorkshire. The company was obliged to make a formal application to cancel it.
The closure of S&N's Dunston brewery in May 2010 left Camerons Brewery in Hartlepool as the only remaining significant volume brewery based in the North East of England.

==Variations==

===Special editions===

When the Australian brewer Elders IXL launched a takeover bid for Scottish & Newcastle, locals of Newcastle began the "Keep Us on Top!" campaign. As a sign of solidarity, the Newcastle Brown label was inverted until the takeover was quashed.[tpl]Citation needed|date=September 2011[/tpl]
In 2005 the last 3,000 bottles produced in Newcastle were given commemorative labels "121 years of brewing history, last bottles produced at Tyne Brewery April 2005." and given to the brewery staff.
In 2006, a special production run of 2.5 million bottles celebrated the career of Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer, who had recently broken the club's scoring record and was about to retire from football. The brewery produced the special editions featuring Newcastle United's black and white stripes and Shearer's portrait, in exchange for a donation to Shearer's testimonial match, and they went on sale from 17 April that year.
In 2007 a special edition was released to celebrate local rock band Maxïmo Park. The label was designed by the band and the beer released to coincide with the band's concert at Newcastle Metro Radio Arena on 15 December. Also in 2007, a special 80th anniversary themed bottle was distributed..
