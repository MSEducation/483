Overall, despite a few studies that support handwriting analysis, such as Crumbaugh and Stockholm, the large majority of studies such as Ben-Shakar, Bar-Hillel, Blum, Ben-Abba, & Flug and many others indicate evidence against its predictive validity.
Graphology was also dismissed as a pseudo-science by James Randi in 1991.[tpl]youtube|NeYkOHQ683k|James Randi and a Graphologist[/tpl]
There is some evidence of a relationship between gender and handwriting style, though the correlation is weak.[ref]

These describe the observation that individuals will give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically for them, but are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people.
