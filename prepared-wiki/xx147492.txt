The Parc Natural dels Aiguamolls de l'Empordà is a natural park in Catalonia, Spain. It forms part of the Bay of Roses and, like the Ebro Delta, was a malarial swampland. The marshland lies between the Rivers Fluvià and Muga.  It is the second largest wetland in Catalonia at over 4800 hectares and was established in 1983.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.empordaturisme.com/en/Associats/Natural_Parks-188/PARC_NATURAL_DELS_AIGUAMOLLS_DE_LEMPORDA-30.htm|title=Aiguamolls de l'Empordà|publisher=Empordaturisme.com|accessdate=21 December 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite book|last1=Cisneros|first1=Blanca Elena Jiménez|last2=Jiménez|first2=Blanca|last3=Asano|first3=Takashi|title=Water Reuse: An International Survey of Current Practice, Issues and Needs|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zYcTnBmZeIcC&pg=PA508|accessdate=21 December 2012|date=30 May 2008|publisher=IWA Publishing|isbn=978-1-84339-089-3|page=508[/tpl]
During the 19th century much of the marsh was drained as canals were created and the land converted to agriculture. However virgin marsh and dunes remained and was given Natural Park status in the 1980s after a campaign to save the area from development.
The park is home to 327 different species. Great Spotted Cuckoo, Spoonbill, Nightingale, Collared Pratincole and Stone-curlew are among its many birds.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.catalanbirdtours.com/Spain%20birding/AE%20bird%20watching%20holiday.html|title=Aiguamolls de l'Empordà|publisher=Catalan Bird Tours|accessdate=21 December 2012[/tpl] The park offers seven hides and one tower for bird watchers. They are connected through a plain dirt track which allows wheelchairs.
