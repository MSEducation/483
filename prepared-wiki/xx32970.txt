There have been a total of [tpl]Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode count[/tpl] episodes during the show's run.  An episode titled "Boston" was scheduled to air during the fifth season, but was pulled to avoid further controversy surrounding the 2007 Boston bomb scare, and has never aired or been released to the public in any format.
Since its release, the series has developed a cult following, and its popularity has resulted in three different spin-offs: Spacecataz, Carl's Stone Cold Lock of the Century of the Week, and Soul Quest Overdrive. Maiellaro has stated that there are no plans to end the series at any time in the foreseeable future. The series also airs in syndication outside the United States and has been released on various DVD sets and other forms of home media, including on demand streaming of the first and second season on Netflix.

==Premise and setting==

The series revolves around the surreal adventures and antics of three anthropomorphic fast food items: Master Shake, a selfish pathological lying life-sized milkshake; Frylock, a smart protective giant floating box of french fries; and Meatwad, a giant shapeshifting simple minded ball of ground meat. They live together as roommates, next door to a human, Carl Brutananadilewski. The main protagonists often interact with various villains or other individuals in each episode; these interactions are often restricted to one episode, as minor characters rarely reappear in following episodes. Some episodes feature the main protagonists interacting with celebrities (such as adult film actress Tera Patrick) and occasionally with historical figures and professional athletes (such as Bart Oates or John Kruk). The Mooninites are two aliens from the Moon who frequently appear, serving as primary antagonists and wreaking havoc though a series of illegal or destructive actions.  The Mooninites appear more than most characters outside of the main cast. Other recurring characters have made several appearances, including Oglethorpe and Emory, MC Pee Pants, Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future, and Dr. Wongburger. The series is almost completely non-canon, with episodes that often end with the deaths or injuries of major characters or destruction to their property (both Carl's and the protagonists' homes have been damaged or destroyed in multiple episodes), often restored with no explanation or mention in the following episode.
In the show's first seven seasons, the protagonists' homes were located in a suburban neighborhood in South New Jersey. In 2011, during the eighth season, the location was changed to Seattle, Washington.[tpl]cite web|last=Franich|first=Darren|title='Aqua Teen Hunger Force' changes title to 'Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1'|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/04/26/aqua-teen-hunger-force-new-title/?replytocom=1565577|publisher=Pop Watch|date=April 26, 2011|accessdate=April 27, 2011[/tpl] The Seattle neighborhood appeared identical to the protagonists' neighborhood from the first seven seasons, except that each episode began with the caption "Seattle" on the bottom of the screen.
Episodes aired during the eight season of the series, from May 8, 2011, until July 24, 2011. All written and directed by Dave Willis and Matt Maiellaro and aired on Adult Swim. During the ninth season, the same neighborhood was located in the fictional location of Seattle, New Jersey.[tpl]Cite episode|title=Fightan Titan|series=Aqua Something You Know Whatever|airdate=[tpl]Start date|2012|8|5[/tpl]|season=9|number=7[/tpl] The tenth season was set in Chicago, Illinois.SDCC 2013: The Adult Swim Panel at Adult Swim Video

==History==

Aqua Teen Hunger Force is the longest running series on Adult Swim. The pilot episode "Rabbot" originally aired on Cartoon Network unannounced on December 30, 2000, at 5:00 AM, as part of a special preview of upcoming Adult Swim shows. Other shows in the preview block included Sealab 2021, The Brak Show, and Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law.[tpl]cite web|title=Welcome to Williams Street|url=http://www.psuvanguard.com/2.4061/welcome-to-williams-street-1.311737|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110715134221/http://www.psuvanguard.com/2.4061/welcome-to-williams-street-1.311737|archivedate=July 15, 2011|publisher=Daily Vanguard|date=February 8, 2007|accessdate=March 5, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://lustforlunch.com/dgp/oldnews.htm#stealth |title=The Daily Ghost Planet : The Past! |publisher=Lustforlunch.com |accessdate=January 22, 2011[/tpl] Aqua Teen Hunger Force later made its official debut on September 9, 2001 on Adult Swim, where the series has since aired exclusively, in the United States.
The series received negative national attention in 2007 because of a publicity stunt that became known as the Boston bomb scare. On January 31, 2007, as part of a national guerrilla marketing campaign for the series, Peter Berdovsky, 27, and Sean Stevens, 28, installed LED displays depicting the Mooninites in eleven different cities:  Boston, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle, Portland, Denver, Austin, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. In Boston, the authorities considered the LEDs suspicious, prompting the closure of major roads and waterways for investigation. Turner Broadcasting System later admitted placing the LEDs and apologized for the misunderstanding.  Berdovsky and Stevens faced charges for "placing a hoax device and disorderly conduct"; in spite of the uproar, the two mocked the media and critics in interviews.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6319211.stm|title=Probe into Boston ad stunt chaos|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=February 1, 2007|date=February 1, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070202094028/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6319211.stm| archivedate= February 2, 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Subsequently, all criminal charges were dropped in exchange for Berdovsky and Stevens apologizing during their court date and accepting a plea bargain which consisted of community service at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Center.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2007/05/defendants_in_c.html|title=Community service for defendants in Cartoon Network case|work=Boston.com: Boston Globe website|date=May 11, 2007|accessdate=February 4, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081227062547/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2007/05/defendants_in_c.html| archivedate= December 27, 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] Turner Broadcasting paid the Boston Police Department one million dollars to cover the investigation's cost and an additional million for good will.[tpl]cite news|author=Associated Press|title=Turner, 2nd firm to pay $2 million over scare| date=February 5, 2007|publisher=MSNBC|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16990202/|accessdate=December 19, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071227140251/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16990202/| archivedate= December 27, 2007 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=2863647|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070403040220/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=2863647|archivedate=April 3, 2007|title=Cartoon Network Head Resigns After Scare|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=February 22, 2007[/tpl] This action was designed to settle criminal and civil claims, while the general manager of Cartoon Network stepped down because of the incident.

==Production==

Every episode of Aqua Teen Hunger Force is written and directed by series creators Dave Willis and Matt Maiellaro, animated by Radical Axis, and produced by Williams Street. Much of the dialogue is supplemented with ad libs and improvisation by the voice talent.[tpl]cite web|publisher=Flak Magazine|title=Aqua Teen Hunger Force, The Interview, September 22, 2003|url=http://www.flakmag.com/features/aquateen.html|accessdate=2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060613042858/http://flakmag.com/features/aquateen.html| archivedate= June 13, 2006 | deadurl= no[/tpl] The show is fully scripted but ad libs are included in the final voice recordings and the shows are animated to include this improvisation. Many, if not all, of the crew and cast members formerly worked on ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast."
The three main characters—Master Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad—were originally created for an episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast called "Baffler Meal," where they were the corporate mascots for the fictional fast-food chain "Burger Trench." The original versions of the trio were prototypes which resembled the future characters, but both Master Shake and Frylock differed in appearance, personality, and voice from their ultimate design.[tpl]cite video|title=Audio commentary for "Baffler Meal"; Volume Two|medium=DVD[/tpl]  The original name "Teen Hunger Force" refers to the squad's mission to conquer hunger in teens.[tpl]cite video|title=Spoken dialogue in "Baffler Meal"; Volume Two|medium=DVD[/tpl]
"Baffler Meal" did not air for several years, and was not even animated or produced until after the series became popular. Instead, the Space Ghost episode was rewritten as "Kentucky Nightmare," while the trio, along with Carl Brutananadilewski, debuted in "Rabbot," the pilot episode of ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force." A full season consisting of sixteen episodes, including "Rabbot", was put into production shortly thereafter. The series is now one of Adult Swim's most popular shows, and is the only show from the original Adult Swim line-up to still be in production.[tpl]cite video|title=Audio commentary|medium=DVD[/tpl]
In early episodes, the trio were identified by Master Shake as the "Aqua Teen Hunger Force," which solved crimes for money. After a few episodes, this premise and the use of the name by the characters were dropped. The premise was a trick that had been added to appease Cartoon Network executives, who "didn't want to air a show about food just going around and doing random things." In the show itself, Frylock mentions that they stopped fighting crime because "that wasn't making us a whole lot of money."Spoken dialogue in Kidney Car
A full length episode satirizing the 2007 Boston bomb scare entitled "Boston" was produced and finished in its entirety. The episode was intended to be aired in 2008 as part of the fifth season, but Adult Swim was forced by Turner Legal to pull the episode to avoid further controversy surrounding the incident. As a result, "Boston" has never aired on television and has never been released to the public in any format. When asked, Dave Willis has stated three alternative versions do exist but indirectly stated that there is no chance of a release at any time in the foreseeable future.

In addition to the main cast, various comedians, athletes and other celebrities have made guest appearances throughout the series.

===Cold openings and theme music===

During the first two seasons, episodes cold-opened with a glimpse into the laboratory of Dr. Weird. He and his assistant Steve use the first several seconds of the show to create monsters, disasters, and various other things. In earlier episodes of the first season, the monsters or creations usually formed the basis for the plot, but as the crime-fighting element of the program disappeared, the Dr. Weird segment became a non sequitur opening gag.
In the third season the Dr. Weird openings were replaced with segments from the pilot episode of Spacecataz, an unaired spin-off created by Willis and Maiellaro. Six episodes were planned for production, but Adult Swim felt that there was little, if anything, that could be made into five more episodes, since all of the characters were destroyed at the end of the pilot, despite the parent series being predominantly non-canon.[tpl]cite video|title=Audio commentary for "Little Brittle": Volume Four| medium=DVD[/tpl] These segments featured the Mooninites and Plutonians trading insults, gestures, and practical jokes. The full Spacecataz pilot is available as a special feature on the Volume Four DVD box-set.Product Details for "Aqua Teen Hunger Force Volume 4" on Amazon.com The Mooninites appear to outsmart the Plutonians for much of the series including tagging the Plutonians' ship and reversing a prank that involved 50 million large pizzas.
Cold openings were eliminated completely starting with the fourth season premiere, "Dirtfoot". A one-off cold opening featuring Dr. Weird and Steve was used once again in the season eight premiere "Allen Part 1". Maiellaro stated that the cold opening would mark the final appearance of Dr. Weird.Mentioned by series co-creator Matt Maiellaro in a bumper, which aired on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim, right before the original debut of "Allen Part 1" on May 8, 2011.
Rapper Schoolly D performed the Aqua Teen Hunger Force theme song,  used for the first seven seasons. An extended remix version of the theme was used in the 2007 film adaption based on the series. After a multi year absence from the series, Schoolly D returned for the season seven episode "Rabbot Redux" where he performed a different theme song used exclusively for that episode. The special intro used in "Rabbot Redux" featured the exact animation used in the regular intro.New open the intro sequence used exclusively in "Rabbot Redux". Each season now features an entirely different theme song from a different artist with a different animated intro. The eighth season under the title was written and performed by Josh Homme and Alain Johannes. Schoolly D returned yet again for the season nine intro for Aqua Something You Know Whatever where he wrote and performed it along with Mariachi El Bronx. In April 2013 it was announced that the season ten theme song was composed by Flying Lotus, an artist whose work has frequently been featured in several bumps for Adult Swim.[tpl]cite web|last=Martins|first=Chris|title=Flying Lotus Writing New 'Aqua Teen Hunger Force' Theme Song Also: Mac Miller rhymes well over FlyLo's "S.D.S." beat|url=http://www.spin.com/articles/flying-lotus-aqua-teen-hunger-force-theme-song-mac-miller-sds/|publisher=SPIN|date=23 April 2013|accessdate=23 July 2013[/tpl] Every episode features an opening sequence, with the rare exceptions of the season two episode "The Last One", the season nine episode "The Granite Family", and the season ten episode "Spacecadunce".[tpl]Cite episode |title=The Last One |series=Aqua Teen Hunger Force |network=Adult Swim |date=December 31, 2003 |season=2 |number=24 |language=English[/tpl][tpl]Cite episode |title=The Granite Family|series=Aqua Something You Know Whatever |network=Adult Swim |date=July 22, 2012 |number=5 |language=English[/tpl]
In November 2006 Schoolly D and Cartoon Network were sued over the original opening theme music. A drummer by the name of Terence Yerves claimed he had also written the theme music alongside Schoolly D in 1999 while working at the Meat Locker Studio. Yerves was aware the song would be used for a television series but did not approve of it being used for Aqua Teen Hunger Force, however, did not file the copyright to the Library Of Congress until May 2006, after the series' fourth season had already started airing. In the lawsuit Yerves demanded he receive $150,000 for every time the series was aired after the lawsuit was filed, he also demanded that all existing copies of the series' DVDs be impounded and for Aqua Teen Hunger Force to cease broadcast.[tpl]cite web|last=Ryan|first=Kyle|title=Aqua Teen Hunger Force sued over theme song|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/aqua-teen-hunger-force-sued-over-theme-song,15851/|publisher=The AV Club|date=10 November 2006|accessdate=29 July 2013[/tpl]
