George 'Snowy' Lambert (born 24 July 1889) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Fitzroy in the early years of the VFL.
Although Lambert played with Fitzroy for nine seasons he struggled to hold his place in the side during the second half of his career. While he was at the club they won two premierships but Lambert missed out on playing in both. A half back flanker, Lambert did however win their Best and fairest award once, sharing it with Bill Walker in 1909.
