[[Dagze Lake]]

CATEGORIES: Lakes of Tibet

Dagzê Lake ([tpl]bo|t=སྟག་རྩེ་མཚོ|z=Dagzê Co[/tpl]) is one of many inland lakes in Tibet, with a present area of 260 km² (100 square miles). In glacial times, the region was considerably wetter, and lakes were correspondingly much larger. Changes in climate have resulted in greater aridity on the Tibetan Plateau. The numerous concentric rings that circle the lake are fossil shorelines, and attest to the historical presence of a larger, deeper lake.
