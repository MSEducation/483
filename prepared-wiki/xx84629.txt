==Mayor of Hartlepool==

Drummond stood for election to Mayor of the Borough of Hartlepool, a unitary authority in the north east of England, in the 2002 election. He was originally put up for election by the football club, as a publicity stunt for their mascot and the football club.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/in-praise-of-hangus-the-monkey-editorial | title=In praise of … H'Angus the Monkey | publisher=Guardian | date=November 19, 2012 | accessdate=November 20, 2012 | location=London[/tpl]  Drummond took part in no serious campaigning and his only promise was for the council to provide free bananas for school children. He was the only candidate absent from the various local forums and question and answers sessions held during the campaign.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] Unexpectedly Drummond was narrowly elected, beating the second place Labour Party candidate by 5,696 to 5,174.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2338527.stm|title=Voters snub parties in mayor polls|publisher=BBC|date=8 October 2002|accessdate=9 May 2012[/tpl] The result was greeted with widespread hilarity, attracting attention far beyond Hartlepool. Canada's National Post newspaper ran the headline "Monkey wins mayoralty, regains human form".National Post news services, "Monkey wins mayoralty, regains human form" (Toronto edition headline)/"Monkey mascot wins $121,800 job as mayor" (all but Toronto edition headline), National Post (Canada), 4 May 2002, archived online at FPinfomart.ca, $4.95 fee to view full article. Following his narrow win, a "furious" Peter Mandelson, who was MP for Hartlepool, forbade Drummond to wear the monkey suit again.http://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2011/take-five/take-five-peter-barron/
After his election, Drummond stood down as mascot. Drummond failed to fulfil his commitment to ensure the council provide free bananas due to a shortage of funds, although he worked with Hartlepool Primary Care Trust to ensure fresh fruit was available in all schools.Peter Hetherington, Gorilla tactics. The Guardian, 27 April 2005 Drummond is most commonly found at home matches where he has a regular spot in the Mill House Stand, although he does refuse to talk politics during the match.[tpl]Citation needed|date=May 2007[/tpl] Drummond also writes a regular column in home match programmes for Hartlepool FC.
On 5 May 2005, Drummond was re-elected as the mayor of Hartlepool with an increased majority of 10,205.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/england/4522687.stm|title=Winning 'monkey' mayor gains wife|publisher=BBC|date=6 May 2005|accessdate=9 May 2012[/tpl] On 4 June 2009, Drummond was re-elected for a third term.
A campaign group set up in 2006 hoped to petition for a referendum that would abolish the office of mayor and adopt the leader and cabinet system of local government leadership.Jill Sherman, Voters aim to throw out mayors they say are acting like dictators. The Times. London (UK): Sep 4, 2006. pg. 8 The referendum occurred on 15 November 2012, after the majority Labour group on Hartlepool council established a referendum which resulted in the council leader and cabinet system being favoured. The leader and cabinet system became the governance structure for the council in May 2013.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/nov/16/mayor-elections-hangus-monkey-hartlepool-habitat|title=Mayor H'Angus the Monkey finally loses his Hartlepool habitat|last=Mulholland|first=Hélène|work=The Guardian|publisher=16 November 2012|accessdate=17 November 2012|location=London|date=16 November 2012[/tpl]
