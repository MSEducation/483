==History==

The Empress Ballroom was built in 1896. It was designed by Manghall and Littlewood of Manchester, and decorated by J.M.Boekbinder. With a floor area of 12,500 square feet (1,160 sq. metres), the ballroom was one of the largest in the world. It has a barrel-vaulted ceiling, decoratively treated as a square-coffered vault with relief patterned panels in gold and white, with twelve glass chandeliers. The ballroom has a decorated balcony on three sides,
It was requisitioned by the Admiralty in 1918 for military use during World War I to assemble gas envelopes for the R.33 airship, before being handed back a year later. It was re-floored in late 1934 with 10,000 pieces of oak, mahogany, walnut and greenwood, laid over 1,320 four-inch springs.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wintergardensblackpool.co.uk/history_empress.htm|title=Winter Gardens History – Empress Ballroom|year=2008|publisher=Leisure Parcs Ltd|accessdate=6 December 2009|location=Blackpool[/tpl] It is one of the few remaining sprung dancefloors in Britain.
In the late 1970s, some of the floor space was adapted for other purposes to reduce the venue’s over-capacity. It was renamed The Stardust Garden and was intended to function as a nightclub.
The ballroom has been used as a conference venue for many years by the Labour Party, Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats. The ballroom has hosted the World Matchplay darts tournament, run by the Professional Darts Corporation, since 1994, which is shown live on Sky Sports It also hosts numerous dance competitions, such as the British Sequence Championships and the Blackpool Dance Festival, an annual ballroom dance competition, since its inception in 1920.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.blackpooldancefestival.com/history.htm|title=Blackpool Dance Festival History|publisher=Blackpool Dance Festival|accessdate=6 December 2009[/tpl]
