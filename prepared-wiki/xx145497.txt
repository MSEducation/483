The Hungarian National Gallery (also known as Magyar Nemzeti Galéria), was established in 1957 as the national art museum.  It is located in Buda Castle in Budapest, Hungary.  Its collections cover Hungarian art in all genres, including the works of many nineteenth- and twentieth-century Hungarian artists who worked in Paris and other locations in the West.  The primary museum for international art in Budapest is the Museum of Fine Arts.

The National Gallery houses Medieval, Renaissance, Gothic art, Baroque and Renaissance Hungarian art. The collection includes wood altars from the 15th century.[tpl]cite book|last=Hewitt|first=Rick Steves & Cameron|title=Rick Steves' Budapest|year=2009|publisher=Avalon Travel|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=9781598802177|edition=1st ed.[/tpl]

==Controversy==

In 2008, the director of the Museum of Fine Arts, László Baán, proposed the merging of his museum with the National Gallery, due to the similar exhibition and collection profile of the two. Both museums and the Ludwig Museum of Contemporary Art specialize in 20th-century and contemporary fine art, much of which was created by Hungarian artists living overseas.[tpl]cite news|last=Mélyi|first=József|title=Notes for a Budapest Museum Master Plan|url=http://www.artmargins.com/index.php/2-articles/606-notes-for-a-budapest-museum-master-plan-|accessdate=2 February 2012|newspaper=Art Margins Online|date=3 November 2010[/tpl] After his request to add an €18million underground extension to the Museum of Fine Arts — which would have united collections spread across the city — was denied in February 2011, Baán presented an alternative plan to the government to build two new buildings at the cost of €150m. He envisioned the new buildings — one housing contemporary European art and the other Hungarian photography — as a "special museum island" that would complement the Museum of Fine Arts and the Budapest Art Hall (Műcsarnok) by permanently joining the two collections by 2017.[tpl]cite journal|last=Unwin|first=Richard|title=Budapest director's double vision for national museum|journal=The Art Newspaper|date=3 August 2011|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Budapest-directors-double-vision-for-national-museum/24249|accessdate=2 February 2012[/tpl]
In September 2011, Secretary of State for Culture Géza Szőcs officially announced plans to build a new structure along Andrássy út close to City Park and near the existing Budapest Museum of Fine Arts and Budapest Art Hall (Műcsarnok).  This building would house the collections of the current Hungarian National Gallery.[tpl]cite news|last=MTI|title=Government commissioner appointed for planned "museum quarter" in Budapest|url=http://www.realdeal.hu/20111003/museum-of-fine-arts-director-appointed-as-museums-quarter-government-commissioner/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=Realdeal.hu|date=3 October 2011[/tpl] This expanded plan, which would utilize the entire boulevard, is also referred to as the Budapest Museum Quarter or Andrássy Quarter.[tpl]cite news|last=Földes|first=András|title=Houdini-cirkusz es fiákerek az Andrássyn|url=http://index.hu/belfold/budapest/2011/09/15/houdini_cirkusz_es_egyeb_megaberuhazasok_a_fovarosban/|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=index.hu|date=15 September 2011[/tpl] 
In early December 2011, Ferenc Csák — director of the National Gallery since 2010 and critical of the proposed merger of the gallery with the Museum of Fine Arts— called the merger process “very unprofessional, anti–democratic and short–sighted” and announced that he would resign at the end of 2011.[tpl]cite news|last=Unwin|first=Richard|title=Hungarian national gallery director resigns in protest|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Hungarian+national+gallery+director+resigns+in+protest/25182|accessdate=5 March 2012|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=7 December 2011[/tpl] As of March 5, 2012, a new director had not been named and the National Gallery was being led by Deputy General Director György Szűcs.[tpl]cite web|title=Contact|url=http://www.mng.hu/en/contact|work=Hungarian National Gallery|accessdate=5 March 2012[/tpl]
