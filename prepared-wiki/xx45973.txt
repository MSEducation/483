José Canseco Capas, Jr. (born July 2, 1964), is a Cuban-American former Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder, and designated hitter. Canseco has admitted using performance enhancing drugs during his playing career, and in 2005 wrote a tell-all book, Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big, in which he claimed that the vast majority of MLB players use steroids. After retiring from Major League Baseball, he also competed in boxing and mixed martial arts.
Canseco is the identical twin brother of former major league player Ozzie Canseco.

==Early years==

Canseco was born in Havana, Cuba, and left Cuba with his cousins and family when he and his identical twin brother were infants. They relocated to the United States, with José and Ozzie growing up in the Miami, Florida area, and attending Coral Park High School.

==Baseball career (1982–present)==

===Minor league baseball (1982–1985)===

The Oakland Athletics drafted Canseco in the 15th round of the 1982 Major League Baseball Draft. He played minor league baseball with the Madison Muskies, Idaho Falls A's, and the Modesto A's. Canseco started the 1985 season with the Class-AA Huntsville Stars and became known as "Parkway Jose",[tpl]cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Paul|title=Huntsville Goes Ga-ga Over Canseco's Return|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-07-03/sports/8902140852_1_stars-valuable-player-jose-canseco-tom-drees|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=July 3, 1989[/tpl] for his long home runs (25 in half a season), that went close to the Memorial Parkway behind Joe Davis Stadium.

===Major League Baseball (1985–2001)===

====Oakland Athletics (1985–92)====

In 1985, Canseco won the Baseball America Minor League Player of the Year Award, and was a late season call-up for the Oakland Athletics. He made his Major League debut on September 2 and struck out in his one at-bat against the Baltimore Orioles. His first hit was off Ron Guidry of the New York Yankees on September 7.September 7, 1985 Athletics vs. Yankees box score and his first home run was off Jeff Russell of the Texas Rangers on September 9.September 9, 1985 Athletics vs. Rangers box score He played in 29 games in the major leagues in 1985. He established himself in 1986, his first full season, being named the American League's Rookie of the Year (the first by an Athletic since Harry Byrd in 1952 with what were then the Philadelphia Athletics), with 33 home runs and 117 runs batted in. In 1987, Mark McGwire joined Canseco on the Athletics; McGwire hit 49 home runs that year and was also named the American League Rookie of the Year. Together, he and Canseco formed a fearsome offensive tandem, known as the "Bash Brothers".
In April of 1988, Canseco guaranteed he would hit at least 40 home runs and steal at least 40 bases in the upcoming season.[tpl]cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-08-19/sports/sp-501_1_jose-canseco|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Thomas|last=Boswell|title=Jose Canseco's 40-40 Vision Starting to Come Into Focus|date=August 19, 1988[/tpl] He went on to record 42 home runs and 40 steals becoming the first player in MLB history to hit the 40-40 mark in a single season (a fact unaware to him at that time). In recognition of his record the street in front of his former high school was named after him but was later rescinded in 2008 after he admitted to previously using drugs throughout his career.Legislative MatterName change for Jose Canseco Street? - UPI.com That same year, he helped the Athletics to the World Series but they lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games. Canseco was unanimously named the American League's Most Valuable Player in 1988, with a .307 batting average, 120 runs scored, 124 RBI, 42 home runs, and 40 stolen bases.
In 1989, Canseco missed all but 65 of the regular season games with a broken wrist, but he still managed to hit 17 home runs as the Athletics won their first World Series since 1974, beating the San Francisco Giants in four games. The 1989 Series was interrupted before Game 3 by a major earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Canseco came back to form in 1990, hitting 37 home runs despite being hampered in the latter part of the season by what would become a recurring back problem. The A's returned to the World Series once again, but were swept by the Cincinnati Reds in four games. Canseco continued to be productive, hitting 44 home runs in 1991.

====Texas Rangers (1992–94)====

On August 31, 1992, in the middle of a game and while he was in the on-deck circle, the A's traded Canseco to the Texas Rangers for Rubén Sierra, Jeff Russell, and Bobby Witt.
On May 26, 1993, during a game against the Cleveland Indians, Carlos Martínez hit a fly ball that Canseco lost sight of as he was crossing the warning track. The ball hit him in the head and bounced over the wall for a home run.The Ballplayers – Jose Canseco The capSeth.com A Head's-Up PlayBuy Jose Canseco's Cap Canseco was wearing on that play, which This Week in Baseball rated in 1998 as the greatest blooper of the show's first 21 years, is in the Seth Swirsky collection.

In his pitching appearance, Canseco allowed three earned runs on two hits and three walks, throwing 33 pitches, but only 12 for strikes.[tpl]cite web|title=May 29, 1993 Texas Rangers at Boston Red Sox|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BOS/BOS199305290.shtml|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=23 March 2012[/tpl] 
In the 1994 strike shortened season, Canseco again returned to his former status of power hitter with 31 home runs and 90 RBI in 111 games. Canseco also stole 15 bases and posted a .282 batting average. He was named comeback player of the year in 1994, and finished in eleventh place in the American League Most Valuable Player voting.

====Final MLB seasons (1995–2001)====

After playing with the Rangers from 1992 to 1994, Canseco moved on to play with the Boston Red Sox from 1995 to 1996. Following an unsuccessful return with the A's in 1997, Canseco did have a productive season again with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1998, when he hit 46 home runs and stole 29 bases, the most he had stolen since the 40 he stole in 1988. He won the AL Silver Slugger award, but his comeback was missed by most fans because of the home run race in the National League between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
Canseco went to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 1999, where he hit 34 home runs in 114 games and was named to the AL All-Star team, until he injured his back and was lost for the season. He was claimed off waivers by the New York Yankees in August 2000, which caught many, including Yankees manager Joe Torre off guard, as the Yankees had four other players who fulfilled a similar role to Canseco.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/08/sports/baseball-yanks-get-canseco-but-the-question-is-why.html?scp=2&sq=Jose+Canseco&st=nyt|work=The New York Times|first=Buster|last=Olney|title=BASEBALL; Yanks Get Canseco, but the Question Is Why?|date=August 8, 2000[/tpl] Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman made the claim to prevent the Blue Jays, who were in a close race with the Yankees, from acquiring Canseco. He made one appearance in the 2000 World Series against the New York Mets and earned his second World Series ring when they defeated the Mets in five games. Despite this achievement Canseco later called his Yankees tenure "the worst time of his life" due to receiving limited playing time.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/26/sports/baseball-notebook-canseco-calls-yankee-tenure-the-worst-time-of-my-life.html|work=The New York Times|first=Buster|last=Olney|title=BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK; Canseco Calls Yankee Tenure 'The Worst Time of My Life'|date=March 26, 2001[/tpl]
Canseco played with the Chicago White Sox in 2001, after being cut by the Anaheim Angels in spring training and spending half of the season with the Newark Bears of the independent Atlantic League. In 2002, Canseco was signed by the Montreal Expos but was released prior to the regular season. Canseco retired in May 2002. He made a brief comeback attempt in 2004, but was not offered a spot with the Los Angeles Dodgers after a spring fling.

====Awards====

His 462 career home runs rank him 32nd on the MLB all-time list. Canseco was at one time the all-time leader in home runs among Latino players; he was later surpassed by Manny Ramirez, Carlos Delgado, Rafael Palmeiro, Alex Rodriguez, and Sammy Sosa. Canseco has been distinguished four times with the Silver Slugger award: three times as an AL outfielder in 1988, 1990, and 1991, and once as a Designated Hitter in 1998.

==Steroids==

In 2005, Canseco admitted to using anabolic steroids with Jorge Delgado, Damaso Moreno and Manuel Collado in a tell-all book, Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big. Canseco also claimed that up to 85% of major league players took steroids, a figure disputed by many in the game. In the book, Canseco specifically identified former teammates Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro, Jason Giambi, Iván Rodríguez and Juan González as fellow steroid users, and admitted that he injected them.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2005-02-13-canseco-60minutes_x.htm|work=USA Today|date=2005-02-13|title=Canseco: Steroids made baseball career possible|accessdate=May 7, 2010[/tpl] Most of the players named in the book initially denied steroid use, though Giambi admitted to steroid use in testimony before a grand jury investigating the BALCO case and on January 11, 2010, McGwire admitted publicly to using steroids.
At a Congressional hearing on the subject of steroids in sports, Palmeiro categorically denied using performance-enhancing drugs, while McGwire repeatedly and somewhat conspicuously refused to answer questions on his own suspected use, saying he "didn't want to talk about the past." Canseco's book became a New York Times bestseller. On August 1, 2005, Palmeiro was suspended for 10 days by Major League Baseball after testing positive for steroids.
On December 13, 2007, José Canseco and Jorge Delgado were cited in the Mitchell Report to the Commissioner of Baseball of an Independent Investigation Into the Illegal Use of Steroids and Other Performance Enhancing Substances by Players in Major League Baseball.[tpl]cite news|last=Mitchell|first=George|url=http://files.mlb.com/mitchrpt.pdf|title=Mitchell Report on Steroid Use in Baseball|date=2007-12-13|accessdate=2007-12-13|format=PDF[/tpl] On December 20, 2007, Canseco was also named in Jason Grimsley's unsealed affidavit as a user of steroids.

On December 30, 2007, it was announced that Canseco has reached a deal for his sequel to Juiced. The new book is Vindicated, which Canseco's lawyer, Robert Saunooke, said would hit bookstores by Opening Day 2008. This book is said to have information on Alex Rodriguez, and Albert Belle as suggested by Canseco. The book will be a "clarification" of names that should've been mentioned in the Mitchell Report. On January 5, 2008, a potential editor for his upcoming book, Don Yaeger, a former Sports Illustrated associate editor, said he would not edit the book. He told the New York Daily News that he thought Canseco didn't have a book in the material he gave him.
