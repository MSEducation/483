The 1981 Australian Sports Sedan Championship was a CAMS sanctioned national motor racing title for drivers of Sports Sedans complying with CAMS Group B regulations.CAMS Manual of Motor Sport, 1981, Page 94
The Sports Sedan championship was discontinued from 1982 with the introduction of the Australian GT Championship, though sports sedans were still able to race with the GT cars, while some cars such as the Chevrolet Monza and Alfa Romeo Alfetta GTV were converted to GT specifications (the GT championship itself lasted only until 1985 before also being disbanded due to GT cars being outnumbered by sports sedans). Although there were minor sports sedan series run in various Australian states, the Australian Sports Sedan Championship would not return to the Australian calendar until 1991.

==Calendar==

The championship was contested over an eleven round series.
Rounds 5 & 9 were contested as single races and all other rounds were staged over two heats.Australian Motor Racing Year, 1981/82, Pages 164-187

==Points==

Championship points were awarded on a 9-6-4-3-2-1 basis to the top six placegetters in each round.
Only the best nine round performances were counted towards each driver's championship total.
For rounds run over two heats, round points were awarded on a 20-16-13-11-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 basis to the top 14 placegetters in each heat.
The six drivers attaining the highest aggregate from the two heats were then awarded the championship points for that round.
If more than one driver attained the same total, the relevant round placing was awarded to the driver who achieved the higher placing in the second heat.CAMS Manual of Motor Sport, 1981, Page 91-92
