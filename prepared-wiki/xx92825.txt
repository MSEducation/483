==Early years==

Sterling was born in Anahuac in Chambers County near Houston, Texas. He grew up on a farm and, after little formal education, began working as a clerk at the age of twelve.[tpl]cite web|title=Ross Shaw Sterling|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fst42|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas STate Historical Association|accessdate=28 February 2012[/tpl]

==Career==

At the age of twenty-one, he launched his own merchandising business, and in 1911 he organized the Humble Oil Company, since Exxon-Mobil.
In addition to oil, Sterling was also involved in a railroad, the former Houston Post newspaper,  banking, and real estate in the Houston area. He was a member of the Houston Port Commission. He served as chair of the Texas Highway Commission under his predecessor governor, Dan Moody."Jessie Ziegler and Governor Ross Sterling," East Texas Historical Association and West Texas Historical Association, annual meeting in Fort Worth, Texas, February 26, 2010

==Public service==

A Democrat, Sterling defeated former Governor Miriam "Ma" Ferguson and several other candidates in the 1930 primary race for governor.  During Sterling's term in office, the East Texas oil fields experienced rapid and uncontrolled development.  The Railroad Commission of Texas attempted pro-ration, but the courts struck down the plan. Because of the chaotic situation, Sterling declared martial law in four counties for six months. National Guard troops were sent to the oil fields to limit waste and control production. This action was later declared unwarranted by the federal district court and the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Railroad Commission's plan for proration was accepted. Cotton prices continued to decline during Sterling's term in office.
Sterling's gubernatorial secretary, Jessie Ziegler of Houston, apparently exerted wide latitude in his administration of the office. She was known to have altered mail correspondence in which Sterling became intemperate with demanding constituents so as not to close the door on gaining future support from such irate voters. She was known to advise him on decision making, including the issuance of pardons in the aftermath of scandals in the previous Ferguson administrations. After Sterling's loss in the 1932 Democratic primary to Miriam Ferguson, whom he had defeated in 1930, Ziegler took a similar but lower-paying staff job with a state senator.

==Personal life and death==

He wed Maud Abbie Gage on October 10, 1898.
