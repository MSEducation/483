The Harbor Defense Museum, sometimes called The Caponier, located within the grounds of Fort Hamilton in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn is  a 19th-century fort, New York City's only military museum and one of only seventy military museums in the United States that is funded and operated by the Defense Department.
The Caponier, the given name of the building that now houses the museum, was a flank battery whose mission was to protect the main fortress from rear attacks, was originally a small fort within the larger fort, and now serves as the guardian of Fort Hamilton's history.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1D91038F935A15756C0A96F948260|title=Out of New York's Military Past|accessdate=2008-04-30|date=1989-05-26|author=Andrew L.

Because it was used as a warehouse after it was no longer needed for military purposes, it was better preserved than other parts of the fort. While the museum and fort were in danger of closing in the mid 1990s due to budget cuts,[tpl]Cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E3D71039F934A35754C0A960958260|title=Bay Ridge; A Battle to Preserve City History|accessdate=2008-04-30|date=1996-07-07|author=Sarah Kershaw|work=The New York Times[/tpl] it was preserved due to an agreement between the Fort and the United States Army Center of Military History and preservation efforts of the Fort Hamilton Historic Society.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/ny_local/1996/07/31/1996-07-31_army_fort_museum_rescued.html|title=Army Fort Museum Rescued|accessdate=2008-04-30|date=1996-07-13|author=Joyce Shelby|work=Daily News[/tpl] The museum continues to serve an educational role in explaining the history of the evolution of New York Harbor.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/ny_local/2000/11/10/2000-11-10_fort_hamilton_museum_salutes.html|title=Fort Hamilton Museum Salutes Military History|accessdate=2008-04-30|date=2000-11-10|author=Bill Farrell|work=Daily News[/tpl] 
Fort Hamilton is the "'second-oldest continuously garrisoned federal post in the nation,'" second only to West Point and its ties to the community are part of the charm of the museum and the fort. Although The Caponier was always prepared for battle, with a 24 pound cannon aimed at New York Harbor, the fort never experienced a battle. The museum houses an array of artifacts from New York's military history including American Revolutionary War relics, uniforms from various wars, old maps of the fort, the post's old switchboard, an exhibit on a secret tunnel that connected Fort Hamilton with another base a half-mile away, a Confederate mine and a piece of the net that protected New York Harbor from German U-boats in World War I.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5DD1630F930A35751C0A967958260|title=If You're Thinking of Living in: Fort Hamilton|accessdate=2008-04-30|date=1991-02-03|author=Jerry Cheslow|work=The New York Times[/tpl] It is also the temporary home of a Bay Ridge time capsule that was unearthed prematurely due to construction.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2007/11/13/2007-11-13_time_capsule_relics_unearthed_47_years_t-1.html|title=Time Capsule Relics Unearthed 47 Years too Early|accessdate=2008-04-30|date=2007-11-13|author=Matthew Lysiak|work=Daily News[/tpl]
