===Deployment in the First World War===

At the beginning of the First World War additional signal elements were established from the 9 telegraph battalions and 8 fortress signal companies that belonged to the transport troops. Due to the tactical changeover to trench warfare, from 1915 all telegraph units were renamed as army signal units (‚‘Armee-Fernsprechabteilungen‘‘) and were divided into elements that operated the existing communications network and elements responsible for the maintenance of communications and construction of new communication links. 
In trench warfare, cable communications were often cut by the continual barrage of enemy fire. As a result, carrier pigeons  and signal dogs were often used. In addition, special optical signal sections were established.
