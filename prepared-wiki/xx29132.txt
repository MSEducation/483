Drusilla of Mauretania (Drusilla in Greek: η Δρουσìλλη) may be the Drusilla mentioned by Tacitus as a granddaughter of Antonius and Cleopatra. If so, she would have been a princess of Mauretania, the youngest child of queen Cleopatra Selene II and king Juba II and a sister to king Ptolemy of Mauretania. Her birthdate is uncertain but is thought to be about 8 BCE.Roller 2003 pp 155, 256

Drusilla was named in honor of the Roman Empress Livia Drusilla or her late son the Roman General Nero Claudius Drusus.

Her mother died in 6 CE. Drusilla received a Roman education and became Romanized. However, little is known on the life of Drusilla.
