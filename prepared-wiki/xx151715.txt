CATEGORIES: Chinese swords, Blade weapons

The Liuyedao ([tpl]Zh|t=柳葉刀|s=柳叶刀|l=willow leaf saber[/tpl]), is a type of dao that was commonly used as a military sidearm for both cavalry and infantry during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Many schools of Chinese martial arts originally trained with this weapon.Tom 2005, pp. 77-78 This weapon features a moderate curve along the length of the blade. This reduces thrusting ability (though it is still fairly effective at same) while increasing the power of cuts and slashes. It weighs from two to three pounds, and is 36 to 39 inches long.
