[[Missouri Route 95]]

CATEGORIES: State highways in Missouri

Route 95 is a highway in southern Missouri.  Its northern terminus is at Route 32 at Lynchburg; its southern terminus is at U.S. Route 160 at Lutie.  A short three mile (5Â km) section forms a wrong-way concurrency with Route 5; Route 95 is marked as "South Route 95" and actually goes north.
The section of Route 95 north of Wasola to Lutie was originally a section of Route 5A, a branch of Route 5.
