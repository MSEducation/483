==The Jam==

The Jam that appears on the set list after "Dark Star" is generally referred to as "Tighten Up Jam" by collectors due to its similarities to the Archie Bell & The Drells tune "Tighten Up".  The Grateful Dead would jam on the theme only a handful of times, mostly from 1969 until 1971.
Also notably rare is a "Cold Rain and Snow" tease on the way back into playing "Not Fade Away" from "Goin' Down The Road Feelin' Bad".  The Grateful Dead were known for teasing bits of songs, often they would play a song they teased at a different show.

==Caveat Emptor==

Each volume of Dick's Picks has its own "caveat emptor" label, advising the listener of the sound quality of the recording.  The label for Volume 2 reads:
"This compact disc has been digitally remastered directly from the original quarter track 7Â½ ips analog tape. It is a snapshot of history, not a modern professional recording, and may therefore exhibit some technical anomalies and the unavoidable effects of the ravages of time."
