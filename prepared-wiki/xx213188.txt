Rock, Rock, Rock! is a 1956 black-and-white motion picture featuring performances from a number of early rock 'n' roll stars, such as Chuck Berry, LaVern Baker, Teddy Randazzo, The Moonglows, The Flamingos, and The Teenagers with Frankie Lymon as lead singer. Future West Side Story cast member David Winters is also featured.  Famed disk jockey Alan Freed makes an appearance as himself. The voice of the main character (Dori Graham) was sung by Connie Francis.  
The movie has a fairly simple plot: teenage girl Dori Graham (played by then 13-year-old Tuesday Weld) can't convince her dad to buy her a strapless gown and has to get the money together herself in time for the prom.
The soundtrack album, also titled Rock, Rock, Rock, is nowadays widely regarded as Chuck Berry's first album.Chuck Berry's Collector Guide Many of the artists featured in the film do not appear on the album, and only four songs on the album ("Over and Over Again," "I Knew From the Stars," "You Can't Catch Me," and "Would I Be Crying") actually appear in the film.
Both Jack Collins and Valerie Harper (who makes a brief appearance as an extra in the crowd at the prom) made their film debut in Rock, Rock, Rock.
In 1984, the film entered the public domain (in the USA) due to the claimants failure to renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.[tpl]cite journal |first=David |last=Pierce |date=June 2007 |title=Forgotten Faces: Why Some of Our Cinema Heritage Is Part of the Public Domain  |journal=Film History: An International Journal |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=125â€“43 |issn=0892-2160 |oclc=15122313 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25165419 |accessdate=2012-01-05 |doi=10.2979/FIL.2007.19.2.125 [/tpl]
