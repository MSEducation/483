[[Bruhat decomposition]]

CATEGORIES: Lie groups, Algebraic groups

In mathematics, the Bruhat decomposition (introduced by  François Bruhat for classical groups and by Claude Chevalley in general) G = BWB into cells can be regarded as a general expression of the principle of Gauss–Jordan elimination, which generically writes a matrix as a product of an upper triangular and lower triangular matrices—but with exceptional cases. It is related to the Schubert cell decomposition of Grassmannians: see Weyl group for this.
More generally, any group with a (B,N) pair has a Bruhat decomposition.

==Definitions==

The Bruhat decomposition of G is the decomposition
of G as a disjoint union of double cosets of B parameterized by the elements of the Weyl group W. (Note that although W is not in general a subgroup of G, the coset wB is still well defined.)

==Examples==

==Geometry==

The cells in the Bruhat decomposition correspond to the Schubert cell decomposition of Grassmannians. The dimension of the cells corresponds to the length of the word w in the Weyl group. Poincaré duality constrains the topology of the cell decomposition, and thus the algebra of the Weyl group; for instance, the top dimensional cell is unique (it represents the fundamental class), and corresponds to the longest element of a Coxeter group.

==Computations==

The number of cells in a given dimension of the Bruhat decomposition are the coefficients of the q-polynomialThis Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics, Week 186 of the associated Dynkin diagram.
