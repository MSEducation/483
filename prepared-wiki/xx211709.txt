Charlotte All-Star Cheerleading or known as CAC, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, is one of the largest and most respected[tpl]Who|date=March 2009[/tpl] all-star cheerleading programs in the United States with over 400 cheerleaders and 25 teams. Along the way CAC earned over 800 National Championship titles. Even more importantly, CAC has had an opportunity to positively shape the lives of thousands of kids who have passed through the program. They want every one of their cheerleaders to come out of the program better than they were coming in. Be it improved physical fitness and cheerleading skills, a better understanding of what it takes to be a successful member of a team, increased self-confidence or an understanding that they can be the best and compete with the best without ethical or moral sacrifice. It is their sincere hope that we can develop these life skills and more, all in a fun and positive environment.

==History==

Charlotte Allstar Cheerleading was founded in 1990 by co-owners Julie O'Brien and Kevin Brubaker. With nothing but an empty warehouse, some used gymnastics equipment and a passion for teaching kids, the CAC program began with just one team of 18 cheerleaders.Charlotte allstars are a competition team they go to competitions all over the U.S. At the 2005-2006 Cheerleading Worlds, they won 2nd place, taking home a silver medal. Also, they took home bronze in 2010.
In April 2012, Charlotte added a new location in Indian Land, SC, about 30 minutes away from the main location.  The new location is referred to as CAC South.  CAC South will go to less demanding competitions but will still go to some of the same competitions as CAC Main.
