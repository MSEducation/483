The real street named Melrose Place is in fact located north-east of the intersection of Melrose Avenue and La Cienega Boulevard; however, it features only shops, salons, boutiques and restaurants, and no apartment complexes.[tpl]cite map |publisher=Google Maps |title=Melrose Place, West Hollywood, CA |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Melrose+Place,+West+Hollywood,+CA&aq=&sll=34.083628,-118.375143&sspn=0.002888,0.004823&g=Melrose+Ave,+West+Hollywood,+California&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Melrose+Pl,+West+Hollywood,+California&ll=34.083339,-118.374767&spn=0.002888,0.006866&z=18 |year=2011 |accessdate=April 5, 2011[/tpl] |group="n"[/tpl] Several young individuals reside in the apartments, each with their own dreams and drives. The original format for the show was to have self-contained stories that conclude in every episode, but when that formula proved unpopular the producers and writers started developing long-term storylines to evolve during the season. By the second season, the show had adopted a full-on soap opera format.

==Cast and characters==

Melrose Place[tpl]'s[/tpl] premiere season featured eight main characters: Dr. Michael Mancini (Thomas Calabro), a physician who works at Wilshire Memorial Hospital and changes from a kind, devoted husband in Season 1 to a mean, adulterous villain from Season 2 on; Jane Mancini (Josie Bissett), his budding fashion designer wife; Billy Campbell (Andrew Shue), a struggling writer adapting to life out of his parents' control; Alison Parker (Courtney Thorne-Smith),[tpl]cite news |first=  |last= |author2= |title= Courtney Thorne-Smith |work=TV Guide |page= |date= |accessdate= June 23, 2009|quote= |url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/courtney-thorne-smith/credits/145521[/tpl] a receptionist at D&D Advertising; Jake Hanson (Grant Show), a struggling manual laborer and motorcycle enthusiast; Matt Fielding (Doug Savant), a gay social worker; Rhonda Blair (Vanessa A. Williams), an aerobics instructor; and Sandy Harling (Amy Locane), a Southern belle and struggling actress who moonlights as a waitress at a local bar called Shooters, the group's main hangout. Locane was written off after 13 episodes, to be replaced by Daphne Zuniga as Jo Reynolds, a photographer running away from her abusive husband. Williams was not brought back for the second season, explained by her character's engagement to a wealthy restaurant entrepreneur.
Actress Heather Locklear, who in season one had guest starred as Alison's ambitious and merciless boss Amanda Woodward, was promoted to series regular status in the second season after her character had bought the Melrose Place apartment building. Although she was always billed as a "special guest star", Locklear remained with the show for the rest of its run. Guest Laura Leighton, recurring as Jane's troublemaking, spoiled younger sister Sydney Andrews in season one, was upgraded to series regular for season two. Marcia Cross, recurring as Dr. Kimberly Shaw in season 1, became a series regular by the end of the second season. Janet Carroll appeared in several episodes as Marion Shaw, Kimberly's domineering mother.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0140848/filmoseries#tt0103491 |publisher=IMDb.com|title=Janet Carroll – Filmography by TV series|accessdate=2012-11-13[/tpl]
Season four saw two new regular characters: Peter Burns (Jack Wagner), the ruthless hospital Chief of Staff introduced in season three; and Brooke Armstrong (Kristin Davis), a young, conniving intern at D&D Advertising also recurring the previous season. Davis's character was subsequently killed off in the middle of the fourth season, while Zuniga left the series at the end of the season. Patrick Muldoon also arrived in the third season as the villainous Richard Hart. Although Muldoon was not billed with the main cast he appeared in most of the fourth season's episodes and is also Melrose Place[tpl]'[/tpl]s longest recurring character (i.e. not in the opening credits) in terms of number of episodes.
The fifth season saw the addition of Rob Estes as restaurateur Kyle McBride, Lisa Rinna as his lush lipped opportunistic wife Taylor, and Brooke Langton as Samantha Reilly, an artist and a new tenant in the apartment complex. Bissett and Cross left the series towards the end of the fifth season; Kelly Rutherford was brought in as Megan Lewis, a prostitute hired by Kimberly Shaw to have an affair with Michael Mancini, and David Charvet played Craig Field, Amanda's new co-worker and later Sydney's boyfriend. The season finale featured the exits of series regulars Thorne-Smith, Show, and Leighton.
The season premiere of season six featured the departure of original cast member Savant while Alyssa Milano (recurring as Michael's sister Jennifer Mancini since season six) was bumped to series regular, with Linden Ashby joining the cast as Dr. Brett Cooper and Jamie Luner as his seductive and rich ex-wife, Lexi Sterling.
Charvet was written out in the middle of season 6, and the beginning of season seven saw the departure of Shue, Rinna, Langton, Milano, and Ashby. The show's seventh season introduced John Haymes Newton as Ryan McBride, Kyle's younger brother, and Rena Sofer as Eve Cleary, a woman from Amanda's past who marries Peter. Sofer was not billed with the main cast. Bissett reprised her role as Jane for the seventh season.

==GALA Committee==

A group of artists and Melrose Place producers formed the GALA Committee, headed by artist Mel Chin, in order to bring artworks out of galleries and into primetime television. GALA artists designed artworks that were used as props by Melrose Place characters in the fourth and fifth seasons, often with hidden political messages:
Chin compared the works to viruses, symbiotic and invisible.  The project was called "In the Name of the Place", as part of the "Uncommon Sense" art show at the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA, Los Angeles, California in 1997.  A portion of the Fifth Season was filmed at the Geffen Contemporary where the project was displayed.  The artwork was also shown at the 1997 Kwangju Biennale in Kwangju, Korea and at Grand Arts in Kansas City, Missouri in 1998.  Sotheby's Auction house auctioned almost fifty of these artworks for charity.
