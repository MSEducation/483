Rebecca or Rebekah is a feminine given name originating from the Hebrew רִבְקָה (Rivkah). The name comes from the verb רבק (rbq), meaning "to tie firmly"; Jones' Dictionary of Old Testament Proper Names and the NOBS Study Bible Name List suggest the name means "snare", "noose", "tied up", "secured", and even "beautifully ensnaring".[tpl]cite|title=Meaning and etymology of the name Rebekah (Rebecca)|author=Arie Uittenbogaard|publisher=Abarim Publications|date=2011[/tpl]  W.F.

==Spelling==

The Latin Vulgate uses the spelling Rebecca exclusivelySee for example, Genesis 49:31: http://www.latinvulgate.com/verse.aspx?t=0&b=1&c=49 and is followed by (ex. gr.) Wycliffe and even the Bishops' Bible. In the Authorized Version of the 1600s the spelling Rebekah is used in the Old Testament (Genesis) and the Latin "Rebecca" (representing Greek Bible[tpl]Disambiguation needed|date=March 2013[/tpl] Ῥεβέκκα) was retained in the New Testament (see Romans 9:10). So the earlier western spelling is “Rebecca,” but both spellings (Rebecca and Rebekah) are used in the influential King James Version and both are current in the English-speaking world today.
