Lesueur National Park is a national park straddling the boundary between the Wheatbelt and Mid West regions of Western Australia (Australia), 211 km north of Perth.  The park was gazetted in 1992.  It includes a mesa known as Mount Lesueur, and supports a highly diverse flora.

==Flora==

Lesueur National Park lies in the Geraldton Sandplains bioregion, which is characterised by scrubby heath with a high number of plants from the Proteaceae family.  
Vegetation in the park is structurally complex, with patches of woodland amongst shrublands.[tpl]cite web|title=Management Plan:Lesueur National Park and Coomallo Nature Reserve1995 - 2005|publisher=Department of Conservation and Land Management|year=1995|url=http://www.naturebase.net/pdf/nature/management/lesueur.pdf|accessdate=6 December 2009[/tpl] 
There are over 900 indigenous plant species in the park, many of which are endemic. Rare or threatened species include the Mount Lesueur Grevillea, Forrest's Wattle, the Lesueur Hakea and the Laterite Mallee.
The park is the northern limit for Jarrah and Mountain Marri, both of which grow as mallees instead of the more usual tall tree form.
Lesueur National Park is under threat from the effects of Phytophthora dieback, a disease which kills plants and is spread through movement of infected soil or water.
