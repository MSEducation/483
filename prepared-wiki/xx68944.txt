Jigglypuff, known in Japan as [tpl]Nihongo|Purin|プリン[/tpl],[tpl]cite web | title=大乱闘スマッシュブラザーズX公式サイト: プリン | url=http://www.smashbros.com/wii/jp/characters/hidden10.html | publisher=Nintendo | language=Japanese | accessdate=2009-05-01[/tpl] is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pokémon franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, Jigglypuff first appeared in the video games Pokémon Red and Blue and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Jigglypuff is voiced by Rachael Lillis in English and by Mika Kanai in Japanese. In live action musical Pokémon Live!, Jigglypuff is portrayed by Leah Smith.
Known as the Balloon Pokémon, Jigglypuff evolves from Igglybuff when it reaches a certain point of happiness, and evolves into Wigglytuff when exposed to a Moon Stone. Its name is a combination of the words "jiggly" and "puff", intended to relate to its jelly-like appearance. The character has been featured in a recurring role in the anime series and served as the focus for several printed adaptions of the franchise. Since it appeared in the Pokémon series, Jigglypuff has received generally positive reception. It has been featured in several forms of merchandise, including figurines, plush toys, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game.

==Design and characteristics==

Jigglypuff was one of several different designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by Ken Sugimori for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and Green, which were localized outside of Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/vol1/index2.html |title=2. 一新されたポケモンの世界 |page=2 |work=Nintendo.com |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=2010-09-10 |author=Staff |language=Japanese[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=91965 |title=Game Freak on Pokémon! |author=Stuart Bishop |publisher=CVG |date=2003-05-30 |accessdate=2008-02-07|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5VSJaR6xT|archivedate=2008-02-08[/tpl] Its Japanese name "Purin" derives from the Japanese loanword for custard or pudding.[tpl]cite web|title=Jigglypuff Biography|url=http://stars.ign.com/objects/142/14232559_biography.html|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2010-10-06[/tpl] Nintendo decided to give the various Pokémon species "clever and descriptive names" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/cover2.html|title=PokéMania|last=Chua-Euan|first=Howard|date=November 22, 1999|publisher=TIME|accessdate=2008-09-15|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080913182631/http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/99/1122/cover2.html |archivedate=2008-09-13[/tpl] Deciding to use a name better suited for its jelly-like appearance, the species was renamed "Jigglypuff", a combination of the words "jiggly" and "puff".[tpl]cite web |url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/16708/page_70.html |title=#039 Jigglypuff |publisher=IGN Entertainment |work=IGN |accessdate=2009-10-04 |author=Staff[/tpl] When a Jigglypuff is exposed to a Moon Stone, it evolves into Wigglytuff.

Known as the Balloon Pokémon, Jigglypuff is shaped like a round ball, with pink skin, large blue or green eyes, catlike ears, and a tuft of fur on its forehead. Its skin is rubbery and stretchy. It can inflate its body like a balloon (usually when it becomes angry; this is accompanied by a distinctive "honk" sound), or flatten its body, much like fellow Nintendo character Kirby. An exact limit to the size it can grow to in this manner is unknown. Jigglypuff are characterized by putting their enemies to sleep by singing a lullaby. Before beginning to sing, they mesmerize the opponent with their soft, glowing eyes, and if they inflate themselves, they can sing for longer periods of time.Pokédex: If it inflates to SING a lullaby, it can perform longer and cause sure drowsiness in its audience.

==Appearances==

===In video games===

===In anime===

In the Pokémon anime series, Jigglypuff is a recurring character who aspires to be a great singer after the inspiration of Ash and company. Unfortunately, most potential audiences fall asleep before the song finishes.[tpl]cite web|last=Tei|first=Andrew|title=Pokemon Vol. #14: Jigglypuff Pop|url=http://www.mania.com/pokemon-vol-14-jigglypuff-pop_article_75704.html|publisher=Mania|accessdate=2010-09-30|date=2000-01-18[/tpl] Jigglypuff's singing can often prove problematic to the series' protagonists, as it causes all around to fall asleep. It carries around a trademark marker, which it uses as a microphone due to its resemblance to such when it is capped.  When it realizes those who have been subject to its song have fallen asleep, it angrily uses the marker to draw on their faces.
During Jigglypuff's first appearance ("The Song of Jigglypuff"), it was found standing on a stump. Misty tried to capture it with the help of her Staryu, but felt bad when the Jigglypuff became sad. They soon realised that Jigglypuff was upset because it could not sing, and after a series of failed vocal exercises, Brock gave it a piece of fruit which soothed its throat. Now capable of singing, it performed for them, putting everyone within hearing range to sleep. This upset Jigglypuff, which angrily dug into Ash's backpack and pulled out a marker which it used to draw on the faces of everyone who fell asleep.[tpl]cite episode| title = The Song of Jigglypuff | series = Pokémon | credits = Yukiyoshi Ōhashi (writer) | network = Various | airdate = February 20, 1999 | season = Indigo League|number = 45[/tpl] Only on two occasions has Jigglypuff believed that anyone had heard its song to the end: in the first, Jigglypuff realizes that Misty's Psyduck was sleeping with its eyes open, and in the second, a Whismur had heard the song the first time and stayed awake due to its Soundproof ability, but on the second time it was tired and fell asleep.[tpl]cite episode| title = A Pokéblock Party | series = Pokémon | credits = Yukiyoshi Ōhashi (writer) | network = Various | airdate = September 4, 2004 | season = Advanced Generation|number = 39[/tpl] In a different episode, Jigglypuff sang to two gigantic Pokémon battling each other, but these two Pokémon did not fall asleep, and instead Jigglypuff was knocked away by the energy of their battle.[tpl]cite episode| title = The Ancient Puzzle of Pokémopolis | series = Pokémon | credits = Atsuhiro Tomioka (writer) | network = Various | airdate = October 14, 1999 | season = Indigo League|number = 72[/tpl] In the Pokémon short Pikachu's Exploration Club, Jigglypuff is parodied by a Marill, which, in the same fashion, puffs up angrily after putting its audience into sleep with its song.[tpl]cite episode| title = Pikachu's Exploration Club | series = Pokémon | credits = Yukiyoshi Ōhashi (writer) | network = Various | airdate = August 1–29, 2007 | language=Japanese[/tpl] In Pokémon Chronicles, Marina has a Jigglypuff, but when the Jigglypuff uses Sing, people are not affected in part because of Beedrill, whose beating wings are too loud.[tpl]cite episode| title = The Legend of Thunder | series = Pokémon | credits = Atsuhiro Tomioka (writer) | network = Various | airdate = June 3/10, 2006 | season = Pokémon Chronicles|number = 1-3[/tpl]
