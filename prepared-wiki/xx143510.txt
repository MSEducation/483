The Great Pretender is the US version of Freddie Mercury's posthumous solo project, to observe the anniversary of his death. There were numerous producers who had permission from Jim Beach to use the original master tapes. Reinhold Mack, who is not credited as being involved, was hired to oversee the project. The album was released by Hollywood Records on 24 November 1992. 
The album differs from its UK counterpart (aside from a slightly different running order) by replacing the original versions of "The Great Pretender" and "Love Kills" with remixes, featuring a slightly altered ending of the "Mr. Bad Guy" remix, and replacing "Barcelona" with a remix of "My Love Is Dangerous".
