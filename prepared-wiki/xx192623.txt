==History==

From the company website: "CEO Aaron Schurman and his childhood friend, Phantom EFX co-founder Danny Stokes, discussed an idea over burgers at a fast-food joint one day. They were initially interested in creating a theme-park simulation game. The long-time friends eventually changed direction and, based on their love for casino gaming, began work creating the most superior casino-based game on the market. It all started when Aaron Schurman went to a casino, following his graduation from the University of Northern Iowa, and did incredibly well for himself. Shurm, as members of the Phantom EFX world call him, returned to the casino to continue his luck. Unfortunately, Shurm didn't do quite as well the second time around. Not willing to accept defeat, he purchased multiple casino titles for PC. After sitting down to try his luck at the PC level of gaming, Shurm had a realization that quickly turned into a dream. He wanted a game that was made by gaming people, for gaming people. He wanted a game that brought that same fun of Vegas and a real casino to the fingertips of the player. He wanted something better than was currently available on retail shelves. Shurm and Danny were determined that they could make that very game.
However, before they could make that dream a reality, they had to partner with a couple of other interesting fellows in order to get a game on the shelves of say Wal-Mart or Target. Partners Marty VanZee and Darin Beck came into the picture to take Aaron and Danny to the next level and formed Phantom EFX Inc. Then they brought Jim Thompson aboard, for his expertise, as the President of Phantom. Now with a strong foundation, Phantom EFX could publish itâ€™s highly polished, supremely entertaining end result, Reel Deal Slots & Video Poker, the grandfather of a line of Phantom EFX titles now 33 strong and growing."
