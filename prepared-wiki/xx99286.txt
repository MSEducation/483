===Tropical Storm Arlene===

Arlene was a very unusual tropical storm in 1981. It formed on May 6, well before the beginning of the normal hurricane season. It developed out of a disturbance that moved from the Pacific Ocean across Central America into the Caribbean Sea. As the disturbance tracked northeast across the western Caribbean, it became a tropical depression, then on May 7 reached tropical storm strength near the Cayman Islands. Arlene struck eastern Cuba on the night of May 7, and the passage over land weakened it to a depression. It restrengthened briefly over the southeastern Bahamas, but weakened again and was absorbed by another system. Reported damage was minimal.
Since Arlene, two subtropical cyclones have formed in May in 1997 and 2007 respectively. After Arlene, the next tropical cyclone of tropical storm strength to form in May was Tropical Storm Arthur in 2008, the second within a span of 27 years.[tpl]Atlantic hurricane best track[/tpl]
 

===Tropical Depression Two===

A tropical depression formed in the Bay of Campeche near Veracruz, Mexico, on June 3.  The system moved north-northwest, lured by a cyclone over the southern Plains.  Tropical Depression Two made landfall along the upper Texas coast on June 5, spreading up to [tpl]convert|15|in|mm[/tpl] of rainfall northeast of the point of landfall.  A total of nine tornadoes stuck the western Gulf coast, with eight touching down in Louisiana.  Three people died; two due to flooding and one from an associated tornado.United Press International.

===Tropical Storm Bret===

Bret formed out of a subtropical low roughly [tpl]convert|150|mi|km[/tpl] off the coast of North Carolina. The storm moved west-northwest, striking land in southern Maryland on July 1. Bret weakened significantly just before landfall, and reported winds were below gale force.  Rainfall amounts were light, with a narrow area of over one inch of rain reported near its track and within the central Appalachians.  The highest rainfall amount reported was [tpl]convert|4.48|in|mm[/tpl] at Big Meadows, Virginia.David M. Roth. Tropical Storm Bret (1981) Color-Filled Rainfall Graphic with a Black Background. Retrieved on June 6, 2008.  No significant damage was reported, but one fatality was reported at Nags Head, North Carolina due to riptides.
 

===Tropical Depression Four===

A tropical disturbance moved across the Caribbean sea between July 20 and July 24 before moving across the Yucatán peninsula.National Climatic Data Center. July 24, 1981 18:00 UTC Channel: Visible (~0.65um) Satellite: GOES-4. Retrieved on May 13, 2008.  After emerging into the south-central Gulf of Mexico, the disturbance organized into a tropical depression early on July 25.  The depression moved west-northwest into northeast Mexico on July 26 before its surface circulation dissipated.  Heavy rains fell across western Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas when the remains of this system interacted with a stationary front across the southern Plains between July 28 and July 30.

===Tropical Storm Cindy===

A subtropical depression that developed along a cold front organized into Tropical Storm Cindy on August 2, in the open Atlantic midway between Bermuda and Nova Scotia. Cindy tracked east-northeast until it became extratropical on August 5 as it moved over colder water. The storm never affected land and caused no known damage.
 

===Hurricane Dennis===

Dennis began as Cape Verde-type hurricanes typically do. A tropical wave leaving the coast of Africa on August 5 developed into Tropical Storm Dennis on August 7 near Cape Verde. Unlike most such storms, Dennis degenerated to a tropical wave before reaching the Windward Islands on August 12.National Hurricane Center. Preliminary Report Hurricane Dennis: 7 – August 21, 1981.  Page 1. Retrieved on May 17, 2008. This wave crossed the Caribbean, passing over Jamaica before reaching the southwestern coast of Cuba on August 15.National Hurricane Center. Preliminary Report Hurricane Dennis: 7 – August 21, 1981. Page 2. Retrieved on May 17, 2008.
Once near Cuba, the wave began rapid organization, restrengthening into a tropical storm. It crossed Cuba, then moved into southern Florida. Over Florida, steering currents weakened and the storm stalled. On August 19, Tropical Storm Dennis reemerged over water, skimming the coasts of the Carolinas before accelerating out to sea. Dennis reached hurricane strength before becoming extratropical on August 22.
Most damage associated with Dennis was from the heavy rainfall caused by its slow passage over Florida, although two tornadoes were also reported within Florida.  The highest amount registered was near Homestead, Florida, where [tpl]convert|25.56|in|mm[/tpl] of rain was measured. Agriculture damage in Dade County, Florida was estimated at $15 million (1981 USD). Coastal areas of the Carolinas were also affected by heavy rainfall, with spots seeing over [tpl]convert|10|in|mm[/tpl], as well as minor beach erosion.
 

===Tropical Depression Seven===

This system developed across the tropical Atlantic ocean on August 18, moving westward through the Windward islands into the eastern Caribbean Sea before dissipating on August 21.
 

===Tropical Depression Eight===

This tropical depression formed in the Bay of Campeche on August 26 and moved slowly northwest, moving ashore northeast Mexico on August 29 and into the United States on August 30.  As an ill-defined surface low, a large thunderstorm complex formed near its center that day, unleashing heavy rainfall in a band [tpl]convert|50|mi|km[/tpl] wide which stretched along a path [tpl]convert|200|mi|km[/tpl] long from Seguin, Texas to north of Houston, Texas.  The highest rainfall amount reported was from Pine Springs in Fayette County, Texas, where [tpl]convert|21|in|mm[/tpl] fell in the 24 hour period ending on the morning of August 31.  Five died in the town of Shiner, Texas due to the flood.John Patton. Data and Descriptions of Selected Substantial Storms and Floods as Documented by John Patton. Retrieved on May 11, 2008.  Downtown Halletsville flooded to a depth of [tpl]convert|5|ft|m[/tpl].  Significant flooding occurred along the Lavaca, Guadalupe, and Colorado rivers in Texas.

Its surface circulation remained ill-defined as it produced another round of heavy rainfall across northwest Louisiana on September 1.  A large mesoscale convective system moved in from Oklahoma and northeast Texas, dissipating what was left of this tropical depression by September 2.  Paid losses by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) totaled nearly US$21 million (1981 dollars), with total damages exceeding US$26 million (1981 dollars).Federal Emergency Management Agency.

===Hurricane Emily===

On September 1, a subtropical storm became Tropical Storm Emily southwest of Bermuda. Emily moved northeast, crossing the island the next day, but measured winds were below tropical storm force. The storm continued generally northeast and strengthened into a hurricane. Hurricane Emily weakened over the north Atlantic and was no longer identifiable as a weather system by September 12.  Hurricane Emily caused beach erosion across the East Coast of the United States, but no other damage was reported.
 

===Hurricane Floyd===

Floyd was first tracked as a tropical depression on September 3 when it organized east of the Leeward Islands. As the depression moved northwest, it caused heavy rain. The highest rainfall reported was [tpl]convert|5.7|in|mm[/tpl] at Antigua. It strengthened into a tropical storm, then reached hurricane strength on September 7.
Floyd turned to the northeast, and passed just southeast of Bermuda as a weakening hurricane. As a tropical storm, Floyd moved east across the Atlantic until losing its identity on September 12.
No damages are associated with Floyd. Although Bermuda was directly affected, the island experienced the weaker half of the storm.
 

===Hurricane Gert===

A tropical wave exited western Africa on September 1, gradually developing a concentrated area of convection. Early on September 7, it was estimated that Tropical Depression Eleven about [tpl]convert|400|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] east of the Leeward Islands, based on satellite imagery. The next day, data from the Hurricane Hunters indicated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Gert. The newly upgraded storm passed between the islands of Dominica and Guadeloupe and continued to intensify, making landfall on southeastern Puerto Rico with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) late September 8. After emerging into the Atlantic, Gert weakened while passing off the north coast of the Dominican Republic.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1981-prelim/gert/prelim01.gif|title=Hurricane Gert Preliminary Report.

Midday on September 11, Gert attained its peak intensity with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 988 mbar (hPa; 29.18 inHg). The hurricane turned northeastward and weakened over cooler waters, passing about [tpl]convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] north of Bermuda on September 12 as a tropical storm. On September 14, Gert weakened further to tropical depression status, dissipating the next day.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1981-prelim/gert/prelim02.gif|title=Hurricane Gert Preliminary Report. Page 2|last=Lawrence|first=Miles|date=October 10, 1981|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=11 June 2010[/tpl]
While passing through the Leeward Islands, Gert dropped moderate rainfall of 5.85 inches (148.5 mm) on St. Thomas. Winds gusted to 50 mph (85 km/h) on the island. In Puerto Rico, rainfall peaked at 6.02 inches (153 mm) in the Puerto Rican municipality of Maricao. Gale warnings were issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands and later the southeastern Bahamas, and light rainfall occurred in the region, reaching 3.20 inches (81.28 mm) on the island of San Salvador. Winds were light in Bermuda.

 

===Hurricane Harvey===

Harvey formed in the central Atlantic, reaching hurricane strength only a few hours after first becoming a named system on September 12. From its initial position several hundred miles east of the Leeward Islands, Harvey moved northwest. Its path began curving more to the north, and was considered a threat to Bermuda until the continuing curve took Harvey away from the island. Harvey's track became more easterly, and the storm weakened and became extratropical as it approached the Azores.  Harvey caused no reported damage, although several ships reported experiencing tropical storm force winds.
 

===Tropical Depression Thirteen===

The thirteenth tropical depression developed [tpl]convert|275|mi|km|abbr=on[/tpl] southwest of Bermuda on September 22,[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GJ0cAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DGgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1507,3465230&dq=tropical+depression&hl=en|title=13th Tropical Depression Of Year Forms|date=September 23, 1981|publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|accessdate=November 12, 2010[/tpl] and was initially expected to intensify into a tropical storm.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NdolAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FfQFAAAAIBAJ&dq=tropical%20depression&pg=3491%2C757020|title=Tropical depression aims at Bermuda|date=September 23, 1981|publisher=The Miami News|accessdate=November 12, 2010[/tpl] Although it failed to further intensify, Tropical Depression Thirteen brought squalls to Bermuda with winds gusts of tropical storm force as it passed west of the island on September 23. Moving northward, the system merged with a developing extratropical cyclone south of Nova Scotia on September 24.
 

===Hurricane Irene===

Irene became a named storm midway between the Windward Islands and Cape Verde on September 23, and its track mimicked that of Hurricane Harvey. The storm tracked northwest, becoming a hurricane on September 25. Its track then began curving to the east, eventually resulting in motion to the northeast.
The storm weakened and became extratropical in early October. The remaining extratropical storm moved over France on October 3.
 

===Tropical Depression Fifteen===

This tropical depression formed southwest of the Cape Verde Islands on September 27,Associated Press. 110 MPH Winds Whip Up Atlantic. Retrieved on May 18, 2008. and tracked through the deep tropics before weakening as it moved over the Leeward Islands late on September 30.  Heavy rains occurred at Guadeloupe as the system passed by the island.  The depression then recurved to the south and east of Bermuda late on October 3.
 

===Tropical Storm Jose===

Jose was a weak and short-lived tropical storm that formed far from land on October 29. It moved generally northeast before becoming subtropical and then dissipating on November 1 near the Azores.
 

===Hurricane Katrina===

A tropical depression formed on November 3 in the western Caribbean Sea about [tpl]convert|150|mi|km[/tpl] south of the Cayman Islands. The depression moved north, reaching tropical storm strength as it moved through the Caymans. Katrina continued to strengthen, reaching hurricane strength half a day before landfall in Cuba. A weakening Katrina moved across eastern Cuba on November 6. After emerging over water, the storm accelerated northeast through the Bahamas. Katrina's circulation fell apart, and the storm merged with a front on November 8.
Hurricane Katrina is reported to have killed two and caused widespread flood damage in Cuba's Camagüey province. Katrina was the only named storm responsible for fatalities in 1981.
 

===Subtropical Storm Three===

A frontal low over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream organized into an subtropical storm on November 12 while [tpl]convert|400|mi|km[/tpl] east of Jacksonville, Florida. After moving northeastward, it turned to the northwest, threatening the northeastern United States as an intensifying subtropical storm that was gradually developing tropical characteristics. A high pressure system turned it to the northeast, and after peaking at [tpl]convert|70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl] it became extratropical near Nova Scotia on November 17. The storm produced significant beach erosion and coastal flooding.
 

==Season summary==

==Storm names==

The following names were used for named storms that formed in the north Atlantic in 1981. No names were retired, so it was used again in the 1987 season. It was the first use for all of these names since the post-1978 naming change, except for Arlene, Cindy and Irene which had been previously used in 1959, 1963, 1967, and 1971. Names that were not assigned are marked in [tpl]tcname unused[/tpl].

===Retirement===

Due to lack of major damage from the storms, the WMO did not retire any names in 1981. They were used again in 1987.
