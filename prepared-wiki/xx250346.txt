The MIA Mover is an automated people mover (APM) system which opened at the Miami International Airport (MIA) in metropolitan Miami, Florida, United States on September 9, 2011. The MIA Mover is designed to quickly transport passengers between Miami International Airport's Main Terminal and the Miami Central Station and Rental Car Center, as part of the Miami Intermodal Center (MIC). 

==History==

By 2007, construction of a people mover instead of an extension of the existing Metrorail system to the airport became the preferred option for local authorities to provide greater connectivity to the airport terminals (Metrorail will connect at Miami Central Station).[ref]
