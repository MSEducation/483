}}[/ref] Within the limits of experimental accuracy, the electron charge is identical to the charge of a proton, but with the opposite sign. As the symbol e is used for the elementary charge, the electron is commonly symbolized by [tpl]subatomicParticle|electron[/tpl], where the minus sign indicates the negative charge. The positron is symbolized by [tpl]subatomicParticle|positron[/tpl] because it has the same properties as the electron but with a positive rather than negative charge.
The electron has an intrinsic angular momentum or spin of [tpl]frac|1|2[/tpl]. This property is usually stated by referring to the electron as a spin-[tpl]frac|1|2[/tpl] particle. For such particles the spin magnitude is [tpl]frac|[tpl]radical|3[/tpl]|2[/tpl] ħ.[ref]This magnitude is obtained from the spin quantum number as
for quantum number s = [tpl]frac|1|2[/tpl].

See: 
[/ref] while the result of the measurement of a projection of the spin on any axis can only be ±[tpl]frac|ħ|2[/tpl]. In addition to spin, the electron has an intrinsic magnetic moment along its spin axis. It is approximately equal to one Bohr magneton,
