==Importance==

Due to the importance of the flora and fauna in this wetland area, it’s of urgent necessity to preserve Lang Sen Wetland Area as part of protection of Mekong Basin.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2012[/tpl]
However, the diversity of the flora and fauna here has been damaged by the agricultural activities of the local residents, reducing the number of endemic species once lived here. Since 1998, several researches and surveys have been implemented by local and international organizations in order to collect appropriate proof for the establishment of a natural reserve. In early 2004, this wetland area became a wetland reserve by the decision of the Vietnamese government. It was also chosen as one of two typical areas of wise biological diversity reserve  in Mekong Basin sponsored by IUCN, GEF, UNDP, and MWBP.
