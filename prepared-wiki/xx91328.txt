Nu Virgos was the name used to promote the group VIA Gra (ВИА Гра) outside of Russia, Ukraine and other nearby countries. The name VIA Gra is both a reference to the drug Viagra and a play on words, since the first three letters stand for "vocal-instrumental ensemble" in Ukrainian, and "gra" means "game" (or "play") in Ukrainian. VIA Gra was a Ukrainian girl group that hit the charts in these countries in September 2000 with their first single "Popytka No. 5".http://subscribe.ru/archive/optin.custom/200409/20131306.html            
Their first success outside the Russian language area was in May 2004 with the single "Stop! Stop! Stop!",http://nu-virgos.russian-pop.com/ an English version of their 2002 Russian song.

==History==

===Early years (2000-2002)===

In 2000 Alena and Nadya made "Popytka No. 5" more videos were out on the screens: "Obnimi menya" (Hold me closer), "Bomba" (Bomb), "Ya ne vernus" (I won’t be back).http://www.mtv.ru/idols/_v/via_gra.wbp By the end of the year VIA Gra's repertoire comprised 7 songs that were enough to embark on a tour. The group’s first live performance ever took place in Dnipropetrovsk on the stage of the city’s Ledoviy Palace in front of 4,000 spectators.http://www.2hz.ru/v/via-gra.html The group’s management decided to release the first full-length VIA Gra's effort which was entitled after their major hit Popytka No. 5.http://www.rususa.com/news/news.asp-nid-4693-catid-9
Within 2001 VIA Gra collected some of their first awards: “A Hundred Pood Hit” from HIT FM Radio, “Golden Gramophone” from “Russian Radio”, and the “Golden Firebird” prize at the Ukrainian annual festival “Tavriyski Igry”.
In 2002, Nadya suddenly found out she was pregnant and left temporarily to give birth. To take her place came the brunette Tatiana Naynik. In the producers' fear of negative repercussions upon Nadya's leave, 2002 also saw the group becoming a trio instead of a duet with the addition of Anna Sedokova, along with a change in their musical direction. In spring 2002 the group released their new single, "Сtoп! Сtoп! Сtoп!" ("Stop! Stop! Stop!") whose success enabled VIA Gra to take part in the “Ovation” Music Award Ceremony held at the Moscow’s State Central Concert Hall “Rossiya”. They released the music video for the song the following summer. In September a new song and video, “Good morning, papa!” were released, upon which time Nadya had returned, and for the first and only time, there were four girls in the group. At this time, Alena felt that her time at the group had come to an end, and left. Additionally, Tatiana realized there was not enough room for two brunettes, and left. To close that year’s end the group's members played the roles of crowned heads in a TV musical called "Zolushka" (Cinderella).
