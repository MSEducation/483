The Frigg UK System is a natural gas transportation system from the North Sea gas fields to St. Fergus near Peterhead in Scotland. It transports natural gas from the Alwyn North, Dunbar, Ellon, Grant, Nuggets, Frigg, Bruce, Ross, Captain, Buzzard, Tartan, Piper, Chanter, Galley, Hamish, Highlander, Ivanhoe, MacCulloch, Petronella, Saltire, and
Rob Roy, fields.

==History==

Construction of the main pipeline, the Frigg UK pipeline, started in 1974 and was completed in 1977. It was built to transport natural gas from the Frigg gas field to the United Kingdom. Because of technical limitations, it was decided to build two parallel pipelines, one (the Frigg UK pipeline) by the United Kingdom and one by Norway (former Frigg Norwegian Pipeline, now Vesterled).  Even in British waters, until 1998 both pipelines were in Norwegian jurisdiction.

==Technical description==

The system comprises the Frigg UK pipeline, Alwyn pipeline, other connection lines, and processing facilities at the St Fergus Gas Terminal. The [tpl]convert|110|km|mi|adj=on[/tpl] long Alwyn pipeline with diameter of [tpl]convert|24|in|mm[/tpl] connects Alwyn North Field with the Frigg Field's TP1 bypass spool. From the TP1 the [tpl]convert|362|km|mi|adj=on[/tpl] long original Frigg UK Pipeline with diameter of [tpl]convert|32|in|mm[/tpl] runs to the St Fergus Gas Terminal, alongside of the Vesterled pipeline.  An [tpl]convert|18|in|mm|adj=on[/tpl] diameter pipeline connects Tartan and Piper fields with the Frigg UK Pipeline at the MCP-01 platform, [tpl]convert|173|km|mi[/tpl] northeast of Aberdeen.  The Frigg UK System is operated by Total E&P UK Ltd.
