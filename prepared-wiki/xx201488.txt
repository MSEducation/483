Charl McLeod (born 5 August 1983 in Johannesburg, South Africa) is a rugby union player for the Natal Sharks in the   Currie Cup and the Sharks in the Super Rugby competitions. He plays at scrum-half.
On 18 November 2010, whilst the Springboks were already two matches into their November tour of Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England, Charl received the call to join the squad. After an extremely successful Currie Cup campaign where the Sharks were the deserved champions, many might feel this is a just reward.
