==History==

BSK Borča football club was founded in April, 1937, and played its first official match on May 6, that same year, against Bačko Petrovo Selo, a 4-2 win. It ceased its activities during the Second World War and was reestablished in 1947. For a short period it changed its name to Hajduk and ceased its activities in 1951.  Two years later, in 1953, it is reestablished as BSK and has been competing ever since.History at BSK Borča official website, retrieved 21-9-2012 [tpl]sr icon[/tpl]
The club’s worst seasons since its founding were between 1990 and 1992, when it went down from the Belgrade Zone League to First Division Belgrade, and lastly to the Second Division Belgrade, the lowest category of the competition.
The arrival of new leadership in the mid-1990s and, as of 2003, the new investments into the club have significantly contributed to the club’s expansion into a major sports organization. The club’s ascendency started in 1993, with the arrival of Dragomir Vasić, the owner of Bami company. He stabilized the club financially and had the club’s stadium capacity extended to additional 1.000 seats.History at BSK Borča official website, retrieved 21-9-2012 [tpl]en icon[/tpl], Note: the Serbian and English versions in the history section from the official website are slightly different, thus worth including both. The club has gradually started moving up, from First Division Belgrade to Belgrade Zone League and next to Serbian League North before being promoted to the Second League of FR Yugoslavia in 1998.  They played in the second national level until 2002, when, due to the league reorganisation, they ceded their place to OFK Vrbas and BSK was relegated to the Serbian League Belgrade where they played until 2006.
They were promoted to the Serbian First League in 2006, and immediately in their first two seasons, 2006–07 and 2007–08, the club headed into play-offs for the Serbian SuperLiga.  After failing in those two occasions, it will be in their third attempt, after finishing first in the 2008–09 season that they won promotion to the Serbian SuperLiga.  As the club stadium didn´t fulfill the criteriums for playing in the SuperLiga, BSK played their first two seasons in the higher tier on OFK Beograd home ground, the Omladinski stadion.  In their first season in SuperLiga, BSK finished 12th.

==Stadium==

Home field of BSK Borča is Vizelj park with 2.500 seats, and it was first inaugurated in 1958. There is a project under way which started in April 2009 and that will expand the stadium capacity to 8,000 seats, divided in four stands.
The club has a sports complex which includes 4 grass fields (the main one plus 3 auxiliary ones), a sports hall, and a restaurant with 300 seats and 16 luxury rooms. The club’s reorganization and new infrastructure were possible thanks to the efforts of Obrad Ćesarević and Dragomir Vasić, who both try to keep the club and its professional team in fine standing.

==Supporters==
