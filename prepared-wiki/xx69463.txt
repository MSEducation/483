==Limitations==

Audacity supports only 32-bit VST audio effect plug-ins. It does not support 64-bit or instrument VST plugins.[tpl]cite web|url=http://manual.audacityteam.org/index.php?title=FAQ:Installation_and_Plug-Ins#How_do_I_install_VST_plug-ins.3F |title=FAQ:How do I install VST plug-ins? - Audacity Manual |publisher=Audacityteam.org |accessdate=2013-08-09[/tpl] Audacity lacks dynamic equalizer controls, real time effects and support for scrubbing.[tpl]cite web|url = http://audacityteam.org/wiki/index.php?title=Feature_Requests|title = Audacity Feature Requests|accessdate = 2008-11-08|last = Audacity Project|authorlink = |date=November 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081218234601/http://audacityteam.org/wiki/index.php?title=Feature_Requests| archivedate= 18 December 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl] MIDI files can only be displayed.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.audacityteam.org/manual/index.php?title=Quick_Guide |title=Quick Guide - Audacity Manual |publisher=Audacityteam.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-16[/tpl]
Audacity does not directly support WMA, AAC, or most other proprietary or restricted file formats.

Also, while Audacity does feature a vocal remover for the easy creation of karaoke tracks, a more desirable result requires several steps and use of the noise removal feature.[tpl]cite web|author=Sheogorath |url=https://archiveofourown.org/works/878734 |title=Perfect Chipmunkising in Audacity - Sheogorath - Original Work of Our Own |publisher=Archiveofourown.org |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2013-09-08[/tpl]
