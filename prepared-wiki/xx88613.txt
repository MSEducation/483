Keōua Hale was the palace of Princess Ruth Ke[tpl]okina[/tpl]elikōlani at 1302 Queen Emma Street in downtown Honolulu, Hawaii.

==History==

The mansion was built upon the site of Princess Ruth and her adoptive son Leleiohoku's residence in Honolulu, Ka[tpl]okina[/tpl]akopua. It burned down in 1873 and plans were made to build a grander palace on the location. In the mean time Ke[tpl]okina[/tpl]elikōlani and Leleiohoku resided in another house on King's Street until the house was completed, although most of her time were spent on the Big Island of Hawaii at the Hulihee Palace.[tpl]cite book| author=Kristin Zambucka |title=The High Chiefess: Ruth Keelikolani |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iZNpEIgcNHAC |year=1872 |publisher=Kristin Zambucka Books |isbn= |page=5[/tpl][tpl]cite book| author=Kristin Zambucka |title=The High Chiefess: Ruth Keelikolani |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iZNpEIgcNHAC |year=1977 |publisher=Mana Pub.

The main architect behind new structure was Charles J. Hardy, an American from Chicago, employed at the Enterprise Planing
Mill in Honolulu. The gaslit interior of the mansion was celebrated for its ornate plaster work and frescoes.[tpl]cite journal |work= Hawaiian Journal of History |title= Pioneer Architects and Builders of Honolulu |author= Charles E.

Surrounded by extensive, well-kept gardens, it was characterized by mansard roof, broad lanais, from which lofty flights of steps led down into the gardens, and a large drawing-room upon the ceiling of which was emblazoned the Hawaiian coat of arms.[tpl]cite book |title= The Memoirs of Hon.

In the spring of 1883 Princess Ruth completed the building, and gave a grand luau to celebrate the event. It was larger than the ʻIolani Palace. This was followed by a ball in the evening, which was attended by all the best society of Honolulu, whether of native or foreign birth. But after this festivity the princess was taken suddenly ill, and left for Kailua on Hawai[tpl]okina[/tpl]i island hoping to restore her health. She received medical attention, but did not recover. On 24 May her remains were brought back to Honolulu, and lay in state in the new house. It was later inherited by Princess Bernice Pauahi who died in it.[tpl]cite web |url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/liliuokalani/hawaii/hawaii-3.html |author=Lili[tpl]okina[/tpl]uokalani, Queen of Hawaii (1838-1917) |work=Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen |title=Chapters XVI-XXVIII |year=1898 |accessdate=2009-05-05 |publisher=Boston: Lee and Shepard [/tpl]
