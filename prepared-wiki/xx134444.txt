The Gerson School is a coeducational alternative day school for students in grades 6 through 12 who have not been successful in standard educational settings or who would benefit from a personal and therapeutic environment that affects positive growth according to individual need and ability. Approved by the Ohio Department of Education, the school serves a variety of students, including those with emotional or behavioral difficulties, who have been bullied, or have poor social skills/peer relationships.
The curriculum at The Gerson School closely mirrors that of most home districts so academic standards are not compromised. Classrooms typically have six to 10 students and are set up based on how the students are most likely to focus and learn. All major academic subjects are offered in addition to many electives, including sociology, Spanish, speech communications, government, history, Caribbean culture, service-learning, art, and computer applications.
The Gerson School has a long tradition in northeast Ohio dating back to its start in 1970 by the Society of Friends. With its move to Applewood Centers, the school blends the strengths of behavioral health and special needs education, enabling our students to achieve academic and personal goals. Through the schoolâ€™s alliance with Applewood Centers, students have regular access to a school social worker, as well as expanded mental health services as needed.
It is located in Cleveland, Ohio.
