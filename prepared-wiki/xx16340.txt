The Sikorsky MH-60G/HH-60G Pave Hawk is a twin turboshaft engine helicopter in service with the United States Air Force. It is a derivative of the UH-60 Black Hawk and incorporates the US Air Force PAVE electronic systems program. The HH-60/MH-60 is a member of the Sikorsky S-70 family.
The MH-60G Pave Hawk's primary mission is insertion and recovery of special operations personnel, while the HH-60G Pave Hawk's core mission is recovery of personnel under stressful conditions, including search and rescue. Both versions conduct day or night operations into hostile environments. Because of its versatility, the HH-60G may also perform peace-time operations. Such tasks include civil search and rescue, emergency aeromedical evacuation (MEDEVAC), disaster relief, international aid, counter-drug activities and NASA space shuttle support.

==Design and development==

In 1981, the U.S. Air Force chose the UH-60A Black Hawk to replace its HH-3E Jolly Green Giant helicopters. After acquiring some UH-60s, the Air Force began upgrading each with an air refueling probe and additional fuel tanks in the cabin. The machine guns were changed from 0.308 in (7.62 mm) M60s to 0.50 in (12.7 mm) XM218s. These helicopters were referred to as "Credible Hawks" and entered service in 1987.Eden, Paul. "Sikorsky H-60 Black Hawk/Seahawk", Encyclopedia of Modern Military Aircraft. Amber Books, 2004. ISBN 1-904687-84-9.
Afterward, the Credible Hawks and new UH-60As were upgraded and designated MH-60G Pave Hawk. These upgrades were to be done in a two step process. But funding only allowed 16 Credible Hawks to receive the second step equipment. These helicopters were allocated to special operations use. The remaining 82 Credible Hawks received the first step upgrade equipment and were used for combat search and rescue. In 1991, these search and rescue Pave Hawks were redesignated HH-60G.Bishop, Chris. Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk. Osprey, 2008. ISBN 978-1-84176-852-6.
The Pave Hawk is a highly-modified version of the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk.[tpl]cite journal |last= Young |first= Susan H.H., Staff Editor |title= "HH-60G Pave Hawk", 2008 USAF Almanac – Gallery of USAF Weapons |journal=Air Force Magazine |volume= 91 |issue= 5 |pages= 155–156 |date=May 2008 |publisher=Air Force Association |url= http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Magazine%20Documents/2008/May%202008/0508weapons.pdf |format= PDF |issn= 0730-6784 [/tpl] It features an upgraded communications and navigation suite that includes an integrated inertial navigation/global positioning/Doppler navigation systems, satellite communications, secure voice, and Have Quick communications. The term PAVE stands for Precision Avionics Vectoring Equipment.
All HH-60Gs have an automatic flight control system, night vision goggles lighting and forward looking infrared system that greatly enhances night low-level operations. Additionally, some Pave Hawks have color weather radar and an engine/rotor blade anti-ice system that gives the HH-60G an all-weather capability. Pave Hawk mission equipment includes a retractable in-flight refueling probe, internal auxiliary fuel tanks, two crew-served (or pilot-controlled) 7.62 mm miniguns or .50-caliber machine guns and an 8,000 pound (3,600 kg) capacity cargo hook. To improve air transportability and shipboard operations, all HH-60Gs have folding rotor blades.
Pave Hawk combat enhancements include a radar warning receiver, infrared jammer and a flare/chaff countermeasure dispensing system. HH-60G rescue equipment includes a hoist capable of lifting a 600 pound (270 kg) load from a hover height of 200 feet (60 m), and a personnel locating system. A number of Pave Hawks are equipped with an over-the-horizon tactical data receiver that is capable of receiving near real-time mission update information.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/AboutUs/FactSheets/Display/tabid/224/Article/104508/hh-60g-pave-hawk.aspx|title=HH-60G Pave Hawk|publisher=United States Air Force|date=4 February 2004|accessdate=8 January 2014[/tpl]

==Operational history==

The U.S. Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk is operated by the Air Combat Command (ACC), U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), Air Education and Training Command (AETC), the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and the Air National Guard (ANG) as of 2012.  A number of HH-60Gs are also operated by the Air Force Material Command (AFMC) for flight test purposes.
During Operation Desert Storm, Pave Hawks provided combat search and rescue coverage for coalition Air Forces in western Iraq, Saudi Arabia, coastal Kuwait and the Persian Gulf. They also provided emergency evacuation coverage for U.S. Navy sea, air and land (SEAL) teams penetrating the Kuwaiti coast before the invasion.
All MH-60Gs were subsequently divested by Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) in 1991.  At that time, most MH-60Gs were redesignated as HH-60Gs and transferred to Air Combat Command (ACC) and ACC-gained Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard units.
During Operation Allied Force, the Pave Hawk provided continuous combat search and rescue coverage for NATO air forces, and successfully recovered two U.S. Air Force pilots who were isolated behind enemy lines.
In March 2000, three Pave Hawks deployed to Hoedspruit Air Force Base in South Africa, to support international flood relief operations in Mozambique. The HH-60Gs flew 240 missions in 17 days and delivered more than 160 tons  of humanitarian relief supplies.
Air Force Pave Hawks from the Pacific theater also took part in a massive humanitarian relief effort in early 2005 in Sri Lanka to help victims of the tsunami.Gempis, Master Sgt. Val. "Kadena Airmen help Sri Lanka tsunami victims". Air Force Print News, 18 January 2005.  In the fall of 2005, Pave Hawks from various Air Force commands participated in rescue operations of Hurricane Katrina survivors, rescuing thousands of stranded people.
Pave Hawks have regularly operated during Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn, and continue to be operated in Operation Enduring Freedom, supporting Army and Marine Corps ground combat operations and standby search and rescue support for U.S. and Coalition fixed-wing combat aircraft supporting those ground operations.

===Replacement===

The first attempt to replace the HH-60G Pave Hawk was in 1999 when the Air Force identified a need for a helicopter with improved range, speed, and cabin space.  An options analysis was completed in 2002 and funding for 141 aircraft under the "personnel recovery vehicle" program began in 2004.  In 2005, it was renamed CSAR-X, meaning combat search and rescue.  Sikorsky entered the HH-92 Superhawk, Lockheed Martin entered the VH-71 Kestrel, and Boeing entered the HH-47 Chinook. The HH-47 won the competition in November 2006, but the award was cancelled after successful protests from both other competitors.  A Request for Proposals (RFP) was reissued in 2007, but protested again before proposals were received, leading to the second cancellation of the CSAR-X program.Sikorsky eyes federal budget amid uncertainty over combat rescue helicopter - Flightglobal.com, 19 December 2013
In March 2010, the U.S. Air Force announced a recapitalization plan to return its 99-aircraft inventory to 112 airframes by incremental replacement of aging HH-60Gs. A secondary plan to replace of 13 attrition HH-60s, seven of which have been lost in combat since 2001, has also begun implementation. The Air Force deferred secondary combat search and rescue requirements that called for a larger helicopter. A UH-60M-based version was being offered as a replacement.Trimble, Stephen.

"UH-60M Offered For USAF's New CSAR Program". Defense News, 15 July 2010.
On 22 October 2012, the Air Force issued an RFP for a Combat Rescue Helicopter (CRH), seeking up to 112 aircraft to replace the HH-60G. The primary mission will be personnel recovery from hostile territory, and also execute humanitarian missions, civil search and rescue, disaster relief, casualty and medical evacuation.Air Force Releases RFP for Next Search And Rescue Helicopter Af.mil, 22 October 2012. The helicopter must have a combat radius of 225 nmi (416 km), a payload of 1,500 lb (680 kg), and space for up to four stretchers. It is planned for four development aircraft to be delivered in 2016, with five more in an operational configuration in 2018. Low-rate initial production will add a further 18 helicopters, with the remaining 85 units to be procured during full-rate production. The AgustaWestland AW101 was one competition entrant.US Air Force moves forward with CSAR procurement Flightglobal.com, 31 October 2012 By December 2012, competitors AgustaWestland, EADS, Boeing, and Bell Helicopter had dropped out of the program, claiming that the RFP requirements favored the Black Hawk and did not reward their aircraft's capabilities.Most contractors opt out of Air Force chopper bids Reuters, 11 December 2012.Sikorsky last bidder standing in USAF's combat rescue helicopter battle Flightglobal.com, 12 December 2012. The Air Force argued that the competition was not written to favor Sikorsky, and that the terms were as clear as possible about what capabilities they wanted and could afford. The $6.8 billion contract was delayed to the first quarter of FY 2014 due to the time required to complete an independent cost estimate and the impact of government furloughs. Sikorsky is the only bidder remaining, with Lockheed Martin as a subcontractor. Sikorsky and the Air Force conducted an extensive evaluation of their submission, called the CRH-60, a variant of the MH-60 Black Hawk special operations helicopter.U.S. Air Force delays rescue helicopter contract award - Reuters.com, 2 August 2013
The initial Air Force FY 2015 budget proposal unveiled in September 2013 cancelled the CRH program due to sequestration budget cuts, instead retaining the HH-60 fleet.USAF Weighs Scrapping KC-10, A-10 Fleets Defensenews.com, 15 September 2013. If a budget passed allowing the program to proceed, Sikorsky was to be awarded a contract in the second quarter of FY 2014.If Funds Exist, USAF To Tap Sikorsky for CRH Program Defensenews.com, 22 November 2013. In a 12 December 2013 letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, 74 congressmen expressed their support for the recapitalization of the combat rescue helicopter fleet and not allow budget pressures to impact its lifesaving mission.Congress to Hagel: Keep Funding Search-and-Rescue Helos Defensenews.com, 13 December 2013. The proposed CRH-60 is a version of the H-60M Black Hawk with greater payload capacity, wider rotor blades, better hovering ability, and 20 percent more cabin space.  Lockheed will supply mission equipment and the electronic survivability suite. The contract would procure 112 helicopters over 14 years with fixed development and production costs of nearly $7 billion. The Air Force had stated that there were other options than the program's termination if a contract was not awarded, although Sikorsky feared the service would have to start over again if not awarded. A spending bill unveiled in January 2014 allocated $333,558,000 to the CRH as a “congressional special interest item.”  The bill read that there must be a replacement program, but it has to be affordable to avoid being cancelled; the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Air Force would have to review requirements and acquisition strategies prior to any termination decision.Spending bill funds Air Force combat rescue helicopter Militarytimes.com, 15 January 2014.

Over $300 million was allocated to the program in FY 2014, with $430 million to be moved from other areas through FY 2019 to finance it.  Competitive pricing and congressional support will provide early funding, but the program may have to be reevaluated if additional defense budget cuts take effect in FY 2016.USAF to issue contract to Sikorsky for rescue helicopter - Flightglobal.com, 4 March 2014 Sikorsky's price proposal since September 2013 may need to be updated if a contract is not awarded before the end of March 2014;Sikorsky pricing on USAF Combat Rescue Helo expires soon - Militarytimes.com, 3 March 2014 the Air Force has requested this deadline be extended to the end of June 2014.USAF To Award Combat Rescue Helo Contract This Year - Defensenews.com, 4 March 2014
