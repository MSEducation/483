==Overview==

Information regarding files is displayed in a circular graph representing the physical disk, indicating sections that are fragmented, compressed, reserved for system use, along with other information. From this, the user can select sections of the disk, see a list of the files in that section showing information regarding individual file fragmentation and location, and individually defragment files or drag and drop them to the desired section on the disk.[tpl]Cite web|title=Defrag Away|url=http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/windows/UltimateDefrag-Review-38721.shtml|first=Ionut|last=Ilascu|publisher=SoftNews NET SRL|work=Softpedia|date=October 25, 2006|accessdate=June 12, 2011[/tpl][tpl]Cite web|title=UltimateDefrag home page|url=http://www.disktrix.com/ultimatedefrag_home.htm[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=October 2012[/tpl]
Along with defragmentation, UltimateDefrag performs consolidation of both disk space and files within folders, arrangement of files by volatility (most often used files) or recency (most recently used files), and analysis of the disk. In addition, UltimateDefrag has the ability to defragment files based on manually entered wildcard expressions.[tpl]Cite web|title=UltimateDefrag wildcard expression|url=http://howtogetfaster.co.uk/blog/how-to-use-ultimate-defrag|accessdate=November 13, 2011[/tpl][tpl]Dead link|date=April 2013[/tpl]
