The National Bloc ([tpl]lang-it|Blocco Nazionale[/tpl]) was a right-wing political coalition formed for the 1948 Italian general election formed by:
The alliance scored a poor 3.8% in the election for the House, while a 5.4% was reached for the Senate where the single-man constituencies and the age-restricted suffrage gave an advantage to this list formed by old pre-fascist politicians. The list generally suffered the concurrence of Christian Democracy, which was seen by centrist and right-wing electors as the sole shield against the Soviet-aligned Popular Democratic Front.
The alliance so disappeared soon, leaving only the Italian Liberal Party as party with some electoral support.
