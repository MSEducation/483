[[BT postcode area]]

CATEGORIES: Postcode areas of the United Kingdom, Communications in Northern Ireland

==Coverage==

===Belfast===

Belfast had already been divided into numbered districts. Today, the Belfast post town covers postcode districts BT1 to BT17 and part of BT29. In common with all addresses in Northern Ireland, Belfast postcodes start with the letters BT, a mnemonic of the capital city's name. The commercial centre of the city is designated BT1 and the surrounding districts form a roughly sequential clockwise ring around the city. The postcode of the Royal Mail offices at Tomb Street in Belfast is BT1 1AA.
