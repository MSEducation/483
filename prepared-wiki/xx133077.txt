[tpl]Unreferenced|date=August 2007[/tpl]Sprucegrove Investment Management Limited was founded in 1993 by John Watson and soon joined by Peter Clark, and Ian Fyfe as they, too, left Confederation Life Investment Counseling.
A privately held, Toronto-based company (Ontario, Canada), Sprucegrove Investment Management Limited is owned by its employees. They manage in excess of CAD $20 billion, including CAD $10 billion for American clients.
Sprucegrove is one of several successful international and global equity managers located in Toronto. Some of the others include AGF Management, Black Creek Investment Management Inc., Burgundy, Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, Foyston Gordon & Payne, Gryphon International, Sky, Templeton (which may have relocated its investment team) and Trimark. 
Sprucegrove uses a value investing philosophy not completely dissimilar from an investor like Warren Buffett. It aims to identify high quality companies in hope of making purchases at reasonable to attractive valuations.
The company name references the founder's original family farm: Sprucegrove.
