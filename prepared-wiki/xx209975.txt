In 1933 he debuted on dramatic theater and in revue, a genre he focused until 1950s.
Taranto achieved large notoriety thanks to two  macchiette (i.e. comic musical monologues caricaturing stock characters), Ciccio Formaggio and the Baron Carlo Mazza, two caricatural characters of proven success that he reprised several times during his career. 
He debuted in cinema in 1938, but achieved some success just in the fifties. In 1953 he won a Nastro d'Argento for Best Actor for his performance in Luigi Zampa's Anni facili.[tpl]cite book|last=Enrico Lancia|title=I premi del cinema|publisher=Gremese Editore, 1998|isbn=8877422211[/tpl] In the sixties he was several times sidekick of Totò in a number of successful comedies and starred in numerous musicarelli films. 
Taranto also starred in a number of TV-movies, took part to several television and radio variety shows and recorded several songs. In 1985 RAI honored the artist with a monographic documentary series in  four parts, Taranto Story.
