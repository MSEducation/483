In 2005, it was revealed Raven-Symoné was cast in the leading role. Following the 2011 release of their first feature, Jumping the Broom, Salim Akil and Mara Brock Akil, the creative team behind the TV series The Game and Girlfriends, took on Sparkle as their next project, with Houston executive producing and starring as the mother of the three girls.[tpl]cite web|url=http://popcrush.com/whitney-houston-sparkle-film-remake-jordin-sparks/|title=Whitney Houston in Talks for ‘Sparkle’ Remake, Jordin Sparks to Star in Film|publisher=Popcrush.com|date=2011-09-13|accessdate=2011-11-18[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.s2smagazine.com/stories/2011/09/whitney-houston-shine-sparkle|title=Whitney Houston to shine in 'Sparkle'? | Welcome to|publisher=S2smagazine.com|date=2011-09-14|accessdate=2011-11-18[/tpl]

===Critical response===

The movie got mixed to positive reviews.[tpl]cite web|title=citation needed[/tpl] Sparkle received an A on Cinemascore. Critic reviews for Sparkle so far have been generally mixed to positive, receiving a 57% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes and a consensus stating: "While undeniably melodramatic and old-fashioned, Sparkle transcends its formulaic trappings thanks to Salim Akil's empathetic direction and strong performances from a committed cast" based on 63 review with an average rating of 5.7/10.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sparkle_2012/ | title=Sparkle (2012) | work=Rotten Tomatoes | publisher=Flixster, Inc. | accessdate=2012-08-18[/tpl] Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 55 out of 100 based on 25 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be "mixed or average reviews".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/sparkle-2011|title=Sparkle Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More|work=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=2012-08-18[/tpl]
Critical praise has particularly been given to Carmen Ejogo's performance. Film critic Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film 3 stars, claiming Ejojo "steals the film not only in her sultry singing numbers but in her violent marriage to a snaky, evil comedian named Satin."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120816/REVIEWS/120819987/-1/RSS | author=Ebert, Roger | title=Sparkle :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews | work=Chicago Sun-Times | publisher=Sun-Times Media Group | date=2012-08-16 | accessdate=2012-08-18[/tpl] While giving the film a negative review, The Globe and Mail critic Courtney Shea stated Ejogo, in comparison to Sparks' performance, was "in fact more dynamic, sexy and, dare we say, Bootylicious than the real thing – plays hardened vulnerability to perfection, so much so that you wonder (given her 38 years) where Hollywood has been hiding her."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/film-reviews/sparkle-amid-the-schlock-a-glimpse-of-what-made-houston-great/article4484938/ | author=Shea, Courtney | title=Sparkle: Amid the schlock, a glimpse of what made Houston great | publisher=The Globe and Mail | date=2012-08-17 | accessdate=2012-08-17 | location=Toronto[/tpl] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle went as far as to suggest in his review that Ejogo's performance might place her under serious consideration for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. LaSalle comments: "...very few people will walk out of Sparkle talking about either Sparks or Houston, at least not at first. Instead they will be saying, "Who was that?" And they'll be referring to Carmen Ejogo...If there is any justice, Ejogo will become very famous very soon. As in, maybe today...It's rare to see someone become a movie star right before your eyes, but that's what happens with Ejogo in Sparkle....For an actress, this was the opportunity of a lifetime, and Ejogo plays it that way. She leaves nothing out, holds nothing back."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Sparkle-review-Carmen-Ejogo-s-star-quality-3793648.php | author=LaSalle, Mick | title='Sparkle' review: Carmen Ejogo's star quality | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | date=2012-08-16 | accessdate=2012-08-19[/tpl]
