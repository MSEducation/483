[[Name days in Sweden]]

This is the old Swedish name day calendar, sanctioned by the Swedish Academy in 1901, with official status until 1972. Some days still refer to traditional or religious feasts rather than personal names. Some of the names below are linked to the original saints or martyrs from which they originate. A work group, consisting of the Swedish Academy, publishers and others, agreed to adopt a new name day list in 2001, very similar to the old one but with more names. It is intended that this list will be updated every 15 years. 
The Swedish Name day has developed to a big celebration for a person with a Swedish name. This "tradition" is something that is nowadays seen as a Swedish tradition. Presents, big parties and singing is all related to the celebration of the nameday.
