Twice a winner in Monaco, Coulthard was team-mate to Mika Häkkinen in the Finn's two Drivers' Championship-winning seasons for McLaren Mercedes before helping establish the Red Bull team. His best Drivers' Championship finish was second in 2001.
After retiring from racing in Formula One, Coulthard continued to be involved with the Red Bull Racing team as a consultant,[tpl]cite web|last=Hume|first=Bob|title=Redbull City Limits - David Coulthard's Visit to Belfast|url=http://magazine.utvdrive.co.uk/news/cars/renault/1885-redbull-city-limits---david-coulthards-visit-to-belfast.htm|publisher=UTV Drive Magazine|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=22 March 2010[/tpl] as well as joining the BBC as a television commentator and pundit. He returned as an active driver in the DTM series for 2010, piloting a 2008 Mercedes-Benz C-Class for Mücke Motorsport. He has finished in 16th position in the drivers championship in both years of competing in the series.[tpl]cite web|title=Mercedes-Benz Dominates the DTM Season Opener at Hockenheim|url=http://www.emercedesbenz.com/autos/mercedes-benz/motorsports/mercedes-benz-dominates-the-dtm-season-opener-at-hockenheim/|publisher=eMercedesBenz.com|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=25 April 2010[/tpl] On 18 October 2012, Coulthard announced retirement from racing after the 2012 DTM season, his final race planned to be on 21 October 2012 at Hockenheim.[tpl]cite web|title=David Coulthard announces retirement|url=http://www.touringcartimes.com/article.php?id=8276|publisher=TouringCarTimes.com|accessdate=18 October 2012|date=18 October 2012[/tpl]

==Pre-Formula One==

Coulthard began karting as soon as he was permitted, at the age of 11. He raced karts for six years, moving south once he had started to win local championships.[tpl]cite news|last=Doran|first=Jon|title=Son to shine for Coulthard|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/motorsport/2462412/Son-to-shine-for-Coulthard.html|work=The Sun|accessdate=13 December 2011|date=3 June 2009|location=London[/tpl] He regarded Rowrah, in Cumbria, as his home circuit. It was there that he won the Cumbria Kart Racing Club championship in 1985, a year after Allan McNish.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.egremont-today.com/812rowrah.htm |title=Rowrah Paves Way for Next Lewis Hamilton |publisher=Egremont Today |accessdate=25 November 2011[/tpl] McNish credited the start given to him, David Coulthard, and Dario Franchitti largely to David Leslie, senior and junior.
In 1989, Coulthard started racing in Formula Ford, winning the first ever McLaren/Autosport Young Driver of the Year award. A broken leg at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps put an end to his 1990 racing season, although by the end of that year he was testing for McLaren. He returned the following year to win the Marlboro Masters race at Zandvoort and the Macau Grand Prix. In 1992, he finished ninth in the Formula 3000 series. The following year he improved to third overall.

==Formula One==

===Williams (1994-1995)===

In 1993, Coulthard became test driver for the world champion Formula One team Williams-Renault. He retained his role the following year until, after Ayrton Senna's death at Imola, he was brought in to partner Damon Hill for the Spanish Grand Prix. In eight of the remaining races he drove the second car. However, Nigel Mansell drove instead at Magny-Cours and at the last three races of the season. Renault were keen to have a big name in the second Williams,[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] and Mansell, at that time reigning Indycar champion, fitted the bill. Despite fastest laps at the German and Portuguese Grands Prix, Coulthard finished on the podium only once, when he placed second at Estoril.
Coulthard had intended to race for McLaren in 1995 but, on 14 December 1994, the FIA Contract Recognition Board ruled that "Williams Grand Prix Engineering Ltd. is the team entitled to the services of Mr. David Coulthard for the 1995 FIA Formula One World Championship season."[tpl]cite web|last=Fielding|first=Kelvin|title=FIA rules in favour of Williams in Coulthard dispute|url=http://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/fia-rules-in-favour-of-williams-in-coulthard-dispute|publisher=Motorsport.com|accessdate=12 December 2011|location=Paris|date=14 December 1994[/tpl]http://www.teamdan.com/archive/1994/decem94.html
Coulthard's first victory came at the 1995 Portuguese Grand Prix. Despite never finishing below fourth place, and scoring five pole positions (four of them consecutively), his eight retirements because of poor luck and some unforced errors tarnished his season. By July of that year[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl], Coulthard had already signed for McLaren, for whom he would drive alongside Mika Häkkinen.

===McLaren (1996-2004)===

During the 1996 season McLaren cars finished on the podium only five times, as the Mercedes-powered cars were simply not fast enough. Coulthard's car retired from races on seven occasions. He led at Imola and lost out to Olivier Panis at Monaco.
In his second year with McLaren, Coulthard finished the 1997 Drivers' Championship in third place (following Schumacher's disqualification), tied on points with Jean Alesi. He had won the Australian and Italian Grands Prix as well as recording the fastest lap at the race in Montréal. He had been leading in Canada, but was delayed for over a lap by a clutch problem during his second pit stop. Minutes later Panis crashed, causing the race to be stopped. Had Coulthard's car not stalled, victory would have been his.[ref]

At the last race of the season in Jerez, Coulthard was obliged by team orders to concede second place to Häkkinen with three laps to go. Villeneuve needed to finish the race to win that year's drivers' championship in a car which was underperforming following a lap 48 collision with Schumacher. He gave way to the two McLarens on the final lap, with Coulthard reported to be "not bubbling with joy after the event... Häkkinen himself was speechless and made little sense after the race."[tpl]cite web|title=GRAND PRIX RESULTS: EUROPEAN GP, 1997|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr614.html|work=GP Encyclopedia|publisher=Inside F1, Inc|accessdate=12 December 2011[/tpl]
In 1998, McLaren cars won nine of the races, but it was Häkkinen who won eight of those and who took that year's title. Coulthard's only victory of the season was at the San Marino race. He finished second behind his team-mate five times.
In 1999, Coulthard finished the season in fourth place, with two wins among his six podium finishes. His teammate, Häkkinen, won his second consecutive drivers' championship. McLaren lost the constructors' title to Ferrari.
In 2000, he was involved in a tight battle for the drivers' championship with Schumacher and Häkkinen, but eventually fell out of contention into a third place finish. In 2001, he finished the year in second place, but with barely half the points (65) tallied by runaway winner Schumacher (123). Coulthard extended his contract with McLaren in 2002[tpl]cite news|last=McMillan|first=James|title=Coulthard to sign new deal with McLaren|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-12993331.html|accessdate=13 December 2011|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=26 July 2002[/tpl]  but his subsequent years with the team, to 2004, were disappointing as well, as he was regularly out-paced by younger teammate Kimi Räikkönen. Many of Coulthard's critics argue that his decline began early in the new millennium.[tpl]cite web|last=Thomson|first=Robert|title=David Coulthard's best season 2001|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0054/page02.shtml|work=A Sporting Nation|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=November 2005[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=MacAuley|first=Ted|title=Formula One: A decade, a decline; COULTHARD CAN'T HALT SLIDE|work=Daily Mirror|accessdate=10 December 2011|archiveurl=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Formula+One%3A+A+decade,+a+decline%3B+COULTHARD+CAN'T+HALT+SLIDE.-a0116206930|archivedate=10 December 2011|date=5 May 2004[/tpl][tpl]cite news|last=Hamilton|first=Maurice|title=Coulthard's season stuck in traffic|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2003/jul/06/formulaone.formulaone2003|work=The Observer|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=6 July 2003|location=London[/tpl]  In 2003 the FIA introduced the single-lap qualifying format. Since his Formula Three days, Coulthard had the reputation of being a poor qualifier. He openly admitted that he did not like the format and was a vocal opponent of it.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2011[/tpl] With the announcement that Juan Pablo Montoya was to join McLaren in 2005 alongside Räikkönen, 2004 was to be Coulthard's last year with the team. A poor tenth place finish in the final 2004 standings (24 points, equal with the injured Ralf Schumacher) had not helped Coulthard's cause for 2005 either.
In 2010 while working on air for the BBC F1 coverage, he admitted that Ferrari had approached him for a drive while he was racing with McLaren. He turned down the offer, because he realised that if he was in the lead of a Grand Prix race and Michael Schumacher was behind him, he would have to move out the way to let him through.[tpl]cite web|title=Coulthard turned down Ferrari|url=http://en.espnf1.com/ferrari/motorsport/story/23249.html|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=14 July 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Coulthard will decline dream move to Ferrari|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/coulthard-will-decline-dream-move-to-ferrari-1.387505|work=The Herald|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=26 July 1997[/tpl]

===Red Bull (2005-2008)===

Red Bull Racing were attracted by Coulthard's experience and signed him for the 2005 Formula One season. He was teamed with the inexperienced Christian Klien and Vitantonio Liuzzi. Coulthard's contract at Red Bull Racing was also extended prior to the 2005 British Grand Prix, prolonging his Formula One career to at least the end of 2006.
For 2006, Coulthard continued at Red Bull, partnered again with Christian Klien. The team were powered by Ferrari engines, with a contract for Renault engines agreed for 2007 during the 2006 season. Technical director Adrian Newey joined the team from McLaren to design the 2007 car. These positive developments led Coulthard to state that he wished to remain with the team after the 2006 season, and to add to his victory tally with them.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2008[/tpl] On 7 August 2006, the day after the Hungarian Grand Prix where Coulthard finished 5th, it was announced that he had extended his contract with Red Bull Racing for 2007 and would be teamed up with Mark Webber.[tpl]cite news|title=Red Bull sign Coulthard & Webber|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/5253794.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=7 August 2006[/tpl]
At the 2006 Spanish Grand Prix Coulthard became the 8th member of Formula One's "200 Club",[tpl]cite web|title=Trackside - Coulthard hits 200 not out|url=http://www.autotrader.co.uk/EDITORIAL/CARS/FEATURES/31377.html|publisher=Auto Trader|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=15 May 2006[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Coulthard to celebrate 200th Grand Prix|url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/117717/coulthard-to-celebrate-200th-grand-prix/|publisher=GPUpdate.net|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=11 May 2006[/tpl]  joining Riccardo Patrese, Michael Schumacher, Rubens Barrichello, Gerhard Berger, Andrea de Cesaris, Nelson Piquet and Jean Alesi in the list of drivers to have started 200 Grands Prix (Alain Prost and Michele Alboreto entered 202 and 215 races but started fewer). In the 2006 Monaco Grand Prix, Coulthard scored his first podium finish with Red Bull Racing, his best result with the team and also the team's first podium finish. During the trophy presentation, Coulthard wore a red cape as the team was promoting the film "Superman Returns".
After a slow start to the 2007 season, Coulthard delivered two strong drives at the Bahrain Grand Prix and the Spanish Grand Prix where he picked up the team's first points of the season. On 6 July 2007, Red Bull Racing announced that Coulthard's contract had been extended to the end of [tpl]F1|2008[/tpl].[tpl]cite news| title =Coulthard extends Red Bull deal| publisher =BBC| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/6277580.stm| date =6 July 2007| accessdate =6 July 2007[/tpl]
Coulthard had a bad start to his 2008 campaign after a racing incident with Felipe Massa. In a live post-incident interview with ITV's Louise Goodman, he expressed dissatisfaction with Massa's aggressive on-track behaviour.
At the second race in Malaysia, Coulthard suffered a bad suspension failure which saw his Red Bull team investigated for car safety. Although cleared to drive, the lack of testing time had a negative impact on his race performance and he managed only a 9th place finish. Despite a series of poor performances over the course of the 2008 season, he came back and managed to secure a hard-fought 3rd place at the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix, the 62nd podium finish of his Formula One career.
On the Thursday before the 2008 British Grand Prix, Coulthard announced that he would retire at the end of the season, but would remain at Red Bull as a consultant. He retired on the first lap after colliding with Sebastian Vettel, the driver who would replace him at Red Bull in [tpl]f1|2009[/tpl], in his last British Grand Prix.[tpl]cite news| title =Coulthard announces retirement from F1 | work =Autosport| url =http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/68798| date =3 July 2008| accessdate =3 July 2008[/tpl]
For Coulthard's final race, he competed in a car with a one-off livery promoting the charity "Wings for Life". In the event, Coulthard retired in the second corner on the first lap after he was hit from behind by Kazuki Nakajima in the Williams. In his final website blog before the race, Coulthard said, "I was thinking of asking the drivers to keep well clear of me into turn 1 to give me a better chance of finishing my last GP but I know all too well that when the lights go out racing instincts take over."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.davidcoulthard.co.uk/blog/default.asp?Display=51 |title=David Coulthard blog |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081112121549/http://www.davidcoulthard.co.uk/blog/default.asp?Display=51|archivedate=2008-11-12|accessdate=3 November 2008[/tpl]

==Helmet==

Coulthard's helmet is blue with a white saltire on the top (resembling the flag of Scotland) with its 4 tips trepassing from the top to the chin area. At McLaren a white ring was added around the top. When he joined Red Bull a dark blue line was added in the middle to highlight Red Bull's logo. At the Japanese GP in 2007 he wore a grey helmet with a stylised saltire in its sides as an homage to the late Colin McRae.

==Race of Champions==

At the 2008 Race of Champions, Coulthard made the final only to lose out to Sébastien Loeb. He made the quarter-finals in both 2009 and in 2011, his sixth participation in the end-of-season competition.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.motorstv.com/car/others/race-of-champions/17112011/coulthard-signs-race-of-champions|title=Coulthard signs-up for Race of Champions|last=Weeks|first=James|date=17 November 2011|publisher=motorstv.com|publisher=Motors TV|accessdate=17 November 2011[/tpl]
