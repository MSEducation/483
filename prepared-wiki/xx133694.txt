==History==

TV Warehouse first launched in November 2001 by Canis Media. A sister channel TV Warehouse Select was launched in May 2002. In May 2005, both TV Warehouse channels were sold to TV Network.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.amplefuture.com/assets/pdfs/TV_Network_buys_TV_Warehouse_UK.pdf|title=TV Network buys TV Warehouse UK Channels|publisher=Ample Future|accessdate=2009-02-02[/tpl]
In 2008, TV Network went into liquidation. JML purchased both channels and TV Warehouse Select was rebranded TV Warehouse 2.
On 2 February 2009, both channels were rebranded and were replaced by JML Home & DIY and Shop Now TV.
In September, 2013 Canis Media re-launched TV Warehouse in prominent EPG positions on the Sky DTH and Freesat platforms in the UK. TV Warehouse is positioned on Sky channel 657 within the Teleshopping Genre and is also available on Freesat channel 804. TV Warehouse continues to air the most popular and well known infomercials from the USA and UK.
