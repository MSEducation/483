[tpl]nihongo|Shōgun Tsuka|将軍塚||The Shogun's Mound[/tpl] is a mound on the north eastern end of Hachikokuyama where tradition holds that the famous Samurai general Nitta Yoshisada raised his army's banner in the year 1333.

==History==

In the year 1333,  Nitta was engaged in the Kōzuke-Musashi Campaign campaign against the Shogun's forces that ultimately ended the Kamakura shogunate.  His command post is commemorated by a stone marker at the park's north eastern end and is believed that this marker represents the site from which Nitta commanded the Battle of Kumegawa below. Although it is generally accepted that Nitta commanded his army from the Hachikokuyama ridge, it is not clear why this location is known as "Shōgun Tsuka" since Nitta was never elevated to the rank of Shōgun.
