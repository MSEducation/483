</ref> After various academic research postings in the U.S. and Canada he became Professor of Chemistry at the [[University of Ottawa]] in 1961. He moved to McGill University in 1971.  Belleau worked in the 1960s and 1970s on research programs with Bristol Laboratories, one of which led to the non-narcotic analgesic Butorphanol. Butorphanol was found to have over five times the potency of morphine with far fewer side effects. Butorphanol is often used to relieve post-surgical pain and in the management of migraine headaches.  
In the mid-1980s he helped found what became the biotech company BioChem Pharma with colleagues Francesco Bellini and Gervais Dionne. The trio began work on the anti-AIDS drug, 2,3 dideoxy â€“ 3-thiacytidine (3TC).  Just prior to his death in 1989 he laid the foundations for Lamivudine's development, which was a significant advance in the fight against AIDS, and is credited with saving over 2 million lives.http://www.scienceheroes.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=142:belleau-aids&catid=60:belleau-aids&Itemid=141
