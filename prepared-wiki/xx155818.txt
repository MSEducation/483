==Early life and education==

Harrison graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1939 and served in the Navy until 1945.

==Career==

Harrison was Assistant Dean at Virginia Tech and Dean of Engineering at the University of Toledo.
Previous Georgia Tech president Blake Ragsdale Van Leer had died in office, and interim dean Paul Weber had served for nearly 17 months while the institute searched for a president that was willing to serve in the tough social climate.
After his abrupt retirement from Georgia Tech after ten years as president, Harrison worked for J.P. Stevens (now part of WestPoint Home) for seven years and subsequently retired.
