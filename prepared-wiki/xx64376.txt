Tres Hombres (Spanish for "three men", meaning the three members of the band) is the third album by the American blues rock band ZZ Top. It was released in 1973. The album was the first of many times the band worked with Terry Manning as engineer. It was a successful combination as the release was the band's first commercial breakthrough. In the US, the album entered the top ten while the single "La Grange" reached number 41 on the singles chart.
At the height of ZZ Top's success in the mid-1980s a digitally remixed version of the recording was released on CD and the original 1973 mix version was discontinued. The remix version created controversy among fans because it significantly changed the sound of the instruments, especially drums. The remix version was used on all early CD copies and was the only version available for over 20 years. A remastered and expanded edition of the album was released on February 28, 2006, which contains three bonus live tracks. The 2006 edition is the first CD version to use Manning's original 1973 mix.

==Reception==

Allmusic gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars, stating: "Tres Hombres is the record that brought ZZ Top their first top ten record, making them stars in the process. It couldn't have happened to a better record." In 2003, the album was ranked number 498 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/tres-hombres-zz-top-19691231|title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=7 March 2012[/tpl] In 2012, the album ranked at number 490 on a revised list.  The album peaked at number 8 on the Billboard 200.

==Singles==

The only single released from the album was "La Grange" (b/w "Just Got Paid" from ZZ Top's second album "Rio Grande Mud") which peaked at number 41 on the Billboard Hot 100. But on album rock stations "Waitin' for the Bus" and "Jesus Just Left Chicago" are very popular and played as much as "La Grange", and since those two songs segue into each other, they are usually played together.
