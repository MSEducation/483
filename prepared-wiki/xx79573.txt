Aristides de Sousa Mendes do Amaral e Abranches, GCC, OL (July 19, 1885 – April 3, 1954; [tpl]IPA-pt|ɐɾiʃˈtiðɨʒ ðɨ ˈsowzɐ ˈmẽdɨʃ[/tpl]) was a Portuguese consul. As Portuguese Consul-General in Bordeaux, France, he defied the orders of Portugal's Salazar dictatorship, issuing visas in 1940 to thousands of refugees fleeing from invading German military forces in the early period of World War II. He was punished by his government for his actions but was eventually vindicated after his death.  He was honored posthumously by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations, the first diplomat to be so honored.

==Early life==

Aristides de Sousa Mendes was born in Cabanas de Viriato, in Carregal do Sal, in the district of Viseu, Centro Region of Portugal, on July 19, 1885, shortly after midnight.[tpl]sfn |Fralon|2000|p=1[/tpl] His twin brother César, born a few minutes earlier, had a July 18 birthday.[tpl]sfn |Fralon|2000|p=1[/tpl]  Their ancestry included a notable aristocratic line:  their mother, Maria Angelina Ribeiro de Abranches de Abreu Castelo-Branco, was a maternal illegitimate granddaughter of the 2nd Viscount of Midões, a lower rural aristocracy title.[tpl]sfn |Fralon|2000|p=6[/tpl] Their father, José de Sousa Mendes, was a judge on the Coimbra Court of Appeals.[tpl]sfn |Fralon|2000|p=4[/tpl] César served as Foreign Minister in 1932, in the early days of António de Oliveira Salazar's regime.[tpl]sfn |Fralon|2000|p=20[/tpl] Their younger brother, Jose Paulo, became a naval officer.[tpl]sfn |Fralon|2000|p=25[/tpl]
Sousa Mendes and his twin studied law at the University of Coimbra, and each obtained his degree in 1908.[tpl]sfn |Fralon|2000|p=7[/tpl] In that same year, Sousa Mendes married his childhood sweetheart, Maria Angelina Coelho de Sousa (born August 20, 1888).[tpl]sfn |Fralon|2000|p=14[/tpl] They eventually had fourteen children, born in the various countries in which he served.  Shortly after his marriage, Sousa Mendes began the Consular Officer career that would take him and his family around the world. Early in his career, he served in Zanzibar, Brazil, Spain, the United States, and Belgium.Reese Ehrlich, "A Hero Remembered," Hadassah Magazine (November 1987): 26.
In August 1919, while he was posted in Brazil, Sousa Mendes was "temporarily suspended by the Foreign Ministry, which regarded him as hostile to the republican regime."[tpl]sfn |Fralon|2000|p=17[/tpl] Subsequently, "he had financial problems and was forced to take out a loan in order to provide for his family needs."[tpl]sfn |Fralon|2000|p=17[/tpl] He returned home to Portugal where his son Pedro Nuno was born in Coimbra in April 1920.
In 1921, Sousa Mendes was assigned to the Portuguese consulate in San Francisco, and two more of his children were born there.[tpl]sfn |Fralon|2000|p=18[/tpl] In 1923, Sousa Mendes angered some members of the Portuguese-American community because of his insistence that certain applicants contribute to a Portuguese charity. Both sides decided to publish their arguments in local newspapers.[tpl]sfn |Fralon|1999|p=[/tpl] Ultimately the conflict lead to the US Department of State canceling his consular exequatur[tpl]sfn|Madeira|2007|p=201[/tpl] which prevented him from continuing his consular services in the US.[tpl]sfn|Milgram|1999|p=123–156[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Afonso|1995|p=193[/tpl][tpl]efn-ua|Sousa Mendes wanted to raise funds for an institution that helped orphans of war in Rio, Brazil. He became aware that the Cult of the Holy Spirit, an organization supported by the Oakland American-Portuguese community, had decided to donate funds to the American Red Cross and to the Sacred Heart Hospital in Hanford, California instead of donating funds to the organization he favored. [tpl]sfn|Madeira|2007|p=194[/tpl]  He decided to publish an article in a local newspaper accusing the directors of the Cult of the Holy Spirit of lack of love and respect for Portugal and he [tpl]sfn|Madeira|2007|p=194[/tpl] also banned the Portuguese notaries from performing any further services to the consulate. [tpl]sfn|Madeira|2007|pp=197-198[/tpl]The directors of the Cult of the Holy Spirit reacted and also published an article and the dispute reached the form of insults, published by both sides. .[tpl]sfn|Madeira|2007|p=195[/tpl] A significant part of the local Portuguese community took sides with Sousa Mendes and defended him. The Portuguese Ministry sent telegrams to Mendes ordering him to stop publishing more articles in the newspapers and reminding him that the local community was free to choose the institutions to whom they elected to donate funds, and that his decision to ban the notaries was illegal and should be reverted immediately. [tpl]sfn|Madeira|2007|pp=198-199[/tpl] He was also warned that the American authorities would also not approve his conduct. [tpl]sfn|Madeira|2007|p=200[/tpl] Mendes ignored the Ministry and kept on with the dispute. He ended up with his exequatur canceled and being transferred to Maranhao in Brazil. [tpl]sfn|Madeira|2007|p=201[/tpl]For a complete description see Madeira . [tpl]sfn|Madeira|2007|p=189-203[/tpl] Fralon asserts that in this episode Mendes stood up for had stood up for his poorest compatriots when they protested against the working conditions to which they were subjected by their employers, who were also Portuguese, but much better off." [tpl]sfn |Fralon|1999|p=18[/tpl] However this assertions is not confirmed neither by primary sources (newspaper articles) or by other published sources.[/tpl] While in San Francisco, Sousa Mendes helped establish a Portuguese Studies program at the University of California at Berkeley.Aristides de Sousa Mendes, "A Lingua Portuguesa na Universidade da California," O Lavrador Portugues, November 28, 1923, p.1.
In May 1926 a coup d'état replaced the republic in Portugal with a dictatorship,[tpl]sfn|Fralon|2000|p=19[/tpl] a regime that according to Sousa Mendes "had been greeted with delight" in Portugal.[tpl]sfn |Fralon|1999|p=19[/tpl] He supported the new regime at first and his career started to improve.[tpl]sfn|Afonso|1995|p=195[/tpl] In March 1927, Sousa Mendes was assigned to serve as the Consul in Vigo, Spain, where he helped the new regime neutralizing the Oppositionists.[tpl]sfn|Afonso|1995|p=195[/tpl] He was then sent to Antwerp, Belgium, in 1929 to serve as Dean of the Consular Corps.[tpl]sfn|Fralon|2000|p=21[/tpl] 1934 was a tragic year for the Sousa Mendes family. The family lost two children, Raquel barely one year old and Manuel just graduated from Louvain University. In Antwerp, Sousa Mendes was disciplined for tardiness in transferring funds to the ministry.[tpl]sfn|Fralon|2000|p=39[/tpl] He was assigned in 1938 to be Consul-General of Bordeaux, France, with jurisdiction over all of southwest France.[tpl]sfn|Fralon|2000|p=39[/tpl]

==World War II and Circular 14==

Beginning in 1932, Portugal was under the dictatorship of Antonio de Oliveira Salazar. In 1933 Salazar created his secret police, the Polícia de Vigilância e de Defesa do Estado ("State Defense and Surveillance Police") or PVDE. According to historian Avraham Milgram, by 1938 Salazar "knew the Nazis' approach to the 'Jewish question'...  In keeping with his fear of aliens, who, according to his worldview, might undermine his regime, he severely limited their entry. Toward this end, he expanded the apparatus of the PVDE whose International Department, in particular, was given greater control over matters relating to border patrol and entry of aliens. Presumably, most aliens wishing to enter Portugal at that time were Jews."[tpl]sfn|Milgram|2011|p=63–64[/tpl] Portugal, like other countries, started to adopt tighter immigration policies that prevented refuges for settling in the country. Circular number 10 of October 28, 1938, addressed to consular representations, settling in Portugal was forbidden to Jews; however, they were allowed entry as tourists for thirty days.[tpl]sfn|Milgram|1999|p=page number needed[/tpl]
On November 9, 1938, the Nazi government of Germany began open war against its Jewish citizens in the pogrom known as Kristallnacht, when 1,000 synagogues were burned, 30,000 Jews were arrested, and at least 91 Jews were murdered. On September 1, 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland, home at that time of the largest Jewish community in the world, and World War II began. Salazar reacted sending a telegram to the Portuguese Embassy in Berlin ordering that it should be made clear to the German Reich that Portuguese law did not allow any distinction based on race and therefore Portuguese Jewish citizens could not be discriminated against.Dez anos de Politica Externa, Vol 1, pag 137. Edicao Imprensa Nacional 1961
On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland, and on September 3 France and United Kingdom declared war on Germany. The numbers of people trying to use neutral Portugal as an escape route increased and between September 1939 and December 1939, approximately 9,000 refugees entered in Portugal.[tpl]sfn |Pimentel|2006|p=87[/tpl] Passport forgery and false statements had become common and the police felt the need for a tighter control.[tpl]efn-ua |Before 1939 the Portuguese Police had already dismantled several criminal networks responsible for passport forgeries and several consuls had been expelled from service also for falsifying passports.[tpl]sfn |Pimentel|2006|p=46-52[/tpl][/tpl]
On November 11, 1939, the Portuguese government issued Circular 14, an order sent to Portuguese consuls throughout Europe that spelled out the categories of war refugees whom the PVDE considered to be "inconvenient or dangerous."Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Portugal, Spared Lives: The Actions of Three Portuguese Diplomats in World War II, Documentary Exhibition, Catalogue, September 2000, p.81. The circular allowed consuls to keep on granting Portuguese transit visas, but established that in the case of "foreigners of indefinite or contested nationality; the stateless; Russians; holder of Nansen passports, or Jews expelled from their countries and also all those alleging that they will be embarking from a Portuguese port but have no consular visa in their passports for their country of destination, or air or sea tickets, or an embarkation guarantee from the respective companies the consuls needed to ask previous permission to the Ministry in Lisbon."Spared Lives pp.81-82 With Europe at war, this meant that refugees from Nazism would have a difficult time escaping Europe.
Historian Neill Lochery asserts that Circular 14 “was not issued out of thin air” and that this type of barriers was not unique to Portugal and with the country’s very limited economic resources it was viewed as necessary. It was economic reasons rather than ideology that made the Portuguese avoid accepting more refugees says Lochery.[tpl]sfn|Lochery|2011|p=42-43[/tpl] Milgram expressed similar views, asserting that Portugal’s regime did not distinguish between Jews and non-Jews but rather between immigrant Jews who came and had the means to leave the country and those lacking them.[tpl]sfn|Milgram|2011|p=266[/tpl] Portugal prevented Jews from putting down roots in the country not because they were Jews but because the regime feared foreign influence in general, and feared the entrance of Bolsheviks and left-wing agitators fleeing from Germany.[tpl]sfn|Milgram|2011|p=266[/tpl] Milgram believes that antisemitic ideological patterns had no hold in the ruling structure of the "Estado Novo" and a fortiori in the various strata of Portuguese society.[tpl]sfn|Milgram|2011|p=13[/tpl] Milgram also says that modern anti-Semitism failed "to establish even a toehold in Portugal"[tpl]sfn|Milgram|2011|p=11[/tpl] while it grew racist and virulent elsewhere in early twentieth-century Europe. Nevertheless although it was not anti-Semitism that motivated the Portuguese government, but the danger of mass emigration to the country, the outcome of the border policy made life difficult for Jews fleeing Nazism.

==Sousa Mendes' disobedience of the orders of the Salazar dictatorship==

According to Dr. Mordecai Paldiel, past Director of the Department of the Righteous at Yad Vashem, "In Portugal of those days, it was unthinkable for a diplomatic official, especially in a sensitive post, to disobey clear-cut instructions and get away with it."[tpl]sfn|Paldiel|2007|p=74[/tpl] Nevertheless, Sousa Mendes began disobeying Circular 14 almost immediately, on the grounds that it was an inhumane and racist directive.[tpl]sfn|Afonso|1995|pp=29-39[/tpl]
The process that ended with Sousa Mendes’ discharge from his consular career began with two visas:  the first issued on November 28, 1939 to Professor Arnold Wiznitzer, an Austrian historian who had been stripped of his nationality by the Nuremberg Laws, and the second on March 1, 1940 to the Spanish Republican Eduardo Neira Laporte, an anti-Franco activist living in France.[tpl]sfn |Fralon|2000|p=48[/tpl] Sousa Mendes was reprimanded and warned in writing that "any new transgression or violation on this issue will be considered disobedience and will entail a disciplinary procedure where it will not be possible to overlook that you have repeatedly committed acts which have entailed warnings and reprimands."Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Portugal, Spared Lives: The Actions of Three Portuguese Diplomats in World War II, Documentary Exhibition, Catalogue, September 2000, p.36.
When Sousa Mendes issued these visas and thousands of others, it was a deliberate act of disobedience to the decree of an authoritarian dictatorship.  "Here was a unique act by a man who believed his religion imposed certain obligations," said Paldiel.  "He said, 'I'm saving innocent lives,' as simply as he might have said, 'Come, walk with me in my garden.'"Mordecai Paldiel as cited in Gerald Clark, "The Priceless Signature of Aristides de Sousa Mendes," Reader's Digest (December 1988):  66.
It is also at this time that Andrée Cibial, a French pianist and singer, started to disturb Sousa Mendes' family life. Andrée became his mistress and got pregnant. Andrée did not try to hide it, quite the contrary, she made a public announcement, during a Sunday mass at Riberac`s cathedral.[tpl]sfn|Afonso|1995|p=39[/tpl]
On May 10, 1940, Germany launched the blitzkrieg offensive against France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, and millions of refugees took to the roads.  On May 15, Sousa Mendes issued transit visas to Maria Tavares, a Luxembourg citizen of Portuguese origin, and to her husband Paul Miny, also a Luxembourger.Fralon, p. 48 and "Miny," Sousa Mendes Foundation. Retrieved 15 March 2014. Two weeks later, the couple returned to the Bordeaux Consulate asking Sousa Mendes to issue them false papers.[tpl]sfn|Afonso|1995|p=63[/tpl] Sousa Mendes agreed to their request, and on May 30, 1940, he issued a Portuguese passport listing Paul Miny as Maria's brother, therefore as having Portuguese citizenship. This time Sousa Mendes risked himself a great deal more than he had before, disobeying Circular 14 was one thing, but issuing a passport with a false identity, for someone of military age was a crime.[tpl]sfn|Afonso|1995|p=52[/tpl] Sousa Mendes later provided the following explanation: “This couple asked me for a Portuguese passport, where they would figure as brother and sister, for fear that the husband, who was still of military age, would be detained on passing the French border, and incorporated in the Luxembourg army then being organized in France."Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Portugal, Spared Lives: The Actions of Three Portuguese Diplomats in World War II, Documentary Exhibition, Catalogue, September 2000, p.98. Under the terms imposed by the German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II, that army was under Nazi control.
There were other cases from May 1940 where Sousa Mendes disobeyed Circular 14 issued by the Salazar dictatorship.  Examples include issuing visas to the Ertag, Flaksbaum and Landesman families, all granted on May 29, 1940 despite having been rejected in a telegram from the Portuguese dictator Salazar to Sousa Mendes."Albuquerque-Ertag-Flaksbaum-Landesman-Untermans," Sousa Mendes Foundation. Retrieved 15 March 2014.  Another example is the writer Gisèle Quittner, rejected by Salazar, but rescued by Sousa Mendes, to whom she expressed her gratitude:  "You are Portugal's best propaganda and an honor to your country.  All those who know you praise your courage...."Fralon, p.109 and "Quittner," Sousa Mendes Foundation. Retrieved 15 March 2014.

==Encounter with Rabbi Chaim Kruger==

As the German army approached Paris, the largest single movement of refugees in Europe since the Dark Ages began. An estimated six to ten million people took to the roads and railways to escape the German invasion.Lansing Warren, "Refugee Millions Suffer in France; Roads From Paris to Bordeaux Jammed With Wanderers Pitifully in Need," The New York Times, 19 June 1940. Bordeaux and other southern French cities were overrun by desperate refugees. One of these was a Chassidic Rabbi, Chaim Kruger, originally from Poland but more recently from Brussels, escaping with his wife and five children. Kruger and Sousa Mendes met by chance in Bordeaux, and quickly became friends.Gerald Clark, "The Priceless Signature of Aristides de Sousa Mendes," Reader's Digest (Canadian edition, December 1988): 61-62.  Sousa Mendes offered a visa to the Kruger family in defiance of Circular 14. In response, Kruger took a moral stand and refused to accept the visa unless all of his "brothers and sisters" (the mass of Jewish refugees stranded on the streets of Bordeaux) received visas too. Kruger's response plunged Sousa Mendes into "a moral crisis of incalculable proportions."Mordecai Paldiel, The Righteous Among the Nations:  Rescuers of Jews During the Holocaust, Jerusalem:  Collins, 2007, p.264. He secluded himself and prayed, pondering whether or not he should issue visas to everyone he could, saving their lives at the expense of his own career.Paldiel, The Righteous Among the Nations, p.264.  "Here the situation is horrible and I am in bed because of a strong nervous breakdown,"Aristides de Sousa Mendes to Silvério de Sousa Mendes, 13 June 1940, "De Winter," Sousa Mendes Foundation. Retrieved 15 March 2014. he wrote to his son-in-law on June 13, 1940.

==Act of conscience==

On June 12, despite the guarantees given to the Portuguese Ambassador Teotónio Pereira, Spain took on the status of a non-belligerent power and invaded Tangiers, further endangering Portuguese neutrality.[tpl]cite web|last=Rezola|first=Maria Inácia|title=The Franco–Salazar Meetings: Foreign policy and Iberian relations during the dictatorships (1942-1963)|url=http://www.scielo.oces.mctes.pt/scielo.php?pid=S1645-64322008000200004&script=sci_arttext|publisher=e-Journal of Portuguese History|accessdate=12 April 2014[/tpl]  On June 16, despite his seclusion, Sousa Mendes issued 40 visas, including those for the Rothschild family, although he did feel it was fair to be paid his customary personal compensation fee for issuing visas on a Sunday.Spared Lives and Lochery p. 48 On June 17 Petain announced in a broadcast to the French people that “It is with a heavy heart that I tell you today that we must stop fighting.”  and he calls on the Germans for an armistice that will end the fighting. On that same day Sousa Mendes emerged from his seclusion, impelled by "a divine power,"César de Sousa Mendes (nephew), as cited in Wheeler, "A Hero of Conscience," p.69. and with his decision made.  According to his son Pedro Nuno:
His daughter Isabel and her husband Jules strongly opposed his decision, and tried to dissuade him from what they considered to be a major mistake.Mordecai Paldiel, Diplomat Heroes of the Holocaust, p.76. But Sousa Mendes did not listen to them and instead began to work intensively to grant the visas. "I would rather stand with God and against man than with man and against God,"Robert Jacobvitz, "Reinstating the Name and Honor of a Portuguese Diplomat Who Rescued Jews During World War II: Community Social Work Strategies," Journal of Jewish Communal Service, (Spring 2008):  250. he reportedly explained.  He set up an assembly line process, aided by his wife, sons Pedro Nuno and José Antonio, his secretary José Seabra, Rabbi Kruger and a few other refugees.[tpl]sfn |Wheeler|1989|pp=119-139[/tpl]
On Wednesday, June 19, American writer Eugene Bagger, after waiting in line to no avail at the Portuguese Consulate from 9 a.m. till 11 o’clock, found Sousa Mendes at Hotel Splendide having an aperitif with a friend. Sousa Mendes was tired from overworking the previous day, the crowds and heat, yet he still managed to help the Eugene Bagger get a visa.[tpl]cite book|last=Bagger|first=Eugene|title=For the heathen are wrong: An impersonal autobiography|year=1941|publisher=Little, Brown and Co; 1st edition[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Afonso|1995|p=104[/tpl] [tpl]efn-ua|Wednesday, June 19th, the American writer Eugene Bagger waited in line at the Portuguese Consulate from 9 a.m. till 11 o’clock, to no avail. He had also been waiting at the consulate the previous day. He then went to Hotel Splendid to have a drink where he found Sousa Mendes having an aperitif with a friend. Mendes scribbled something in Bagger’s passports and told him to  go back to the Consulate and have them stamped. To Bagger’s surprise he was then helped by the Polish consul at Arcachon,  M Skalski, who had been honorary Portuguese consul in Poland and had his credentials with him.  At the Consulate M. Skalski got Bagger’s passports duly stamped.[/tpl]
Bordeaux was bombed by the Wehrmacht on the night of June 19–20, 1940.Christiano D'Adamo, "The Bombardments of Bordeaux," Regia Marina Italiana. Retrieved 15 March 2014. In the morning, the demand for Portuguese visas intensified, not only in Bordeaux but also in nearby Bayonne, near the Spanish border.  Sousa Mendes rushed to the Portuguese consulate in Bayonne, which was under his jurisdiction, to relieve the Vice-Consul Faria Machado, who was refusing to grant visas to the crush of refugees.Paldiel, The Righteous Among the Nations, p.265.
On June 20, the British Embassy in Lisbon sent a letter to the Portuguese Foreign Office accusing Sousa Mendes of "deferring until after office hours all applications for visas" as well as "charging them at a special rate" and requiring at least one refugee "to contribute to a Portuguese charitable fund before the visa was granted."[tpl]sfn|Lochery|2011|p=47[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Milgram|2011|p=47[/tpl] This complaint from the British Embassy and the timing of Sousa Mendes’ unilateral decision could not have been worse for Salazar and his carefully planned attempt to preserve Portuguese neutrality.[tpl]sfn|Lochery|2011|p=46[/tpl] Salazar had instructed the consulates in Spain and those in the south of France ― Bordeaux, Bayonne, Perpignan, Marseilles, Nice, etc. ― to facilitate transit visas to British citizens.[tpl]sfn|Milgram|1999|p=20[/tpl]
In issuing visas to the thousands at the Bayonne consulate, Sousa Mendes was aided by the Bayonne consular secretary, Manuel de Vieira Braga.  Faria Machado, a Salazar loyalist in charge of the Bayonne consulate, reported this behavior to Portugal's ambassador to Spain, Pedro Teotónio Pereira.

He declared Sousa Mendes to be mentally incompetent and, acting on Salazar's authority, he invalidated all further visas.Fralon, p.105. The Jewish Virtual Library article notes that a Spanish newspaper headline the next day announced the sudden insanity of "the Consul of Portugal in Bayonne," an ironic error that labeled Sousa Mendes' accuser as the one who had lost his faculties. 
Sousa Mendes continued on to Hendaye to assist there, thus narrowly missing two cablegrams from Lisbon sent on June 22 to Bordeaux ordering him to stop even as France's armistice with Germany became official.[tpl]sfn|Fralon|2000|p=91[/tpl] Furthermore, Sousa Mendes ordered the honorary Portuguese vice-consul in Toulouse, Emile Gissot, to issue transit visas to all who applied.[tpl]sfn|Fralon|2000|pp=106-107[/tpl]
The Armistice was signed on June 22. Under its terms, two thirds of France was to be occupied by the Germans.

The New York Times reported that some 10,000 persons attempting to cross over into Spain were excluded because authorities no longer granted recognition to their visas: "Portugal announced that Portuguese visas granted at Bordeaux were invalid, and Spain was permitting bearers of these documents to enter only in exceptional cases.""American Writers Escape Into Spain," The New York Times, 26 June 1940, p.15.
On June 24, Salazar recalled Sousa Mendes to Portugal, an order he received upon returning to Bordeaux on June 26 but complied with slowly, arriving in Portugal on July 8.Ronald Weber, The Lisbon Route:  Entry and Escape in Nazi Europe, Lanham:  Ivan R. Dee, p.10. Along the way, he continued issuing Portuguese visas to refugees now trapped in occupied France, and even led a large group to a remote border post that had not received Lisbon's order.  His son John-Paul Abranches told the story:
After the intervention of Augusto d'Esaguy and Amzalak most of the refugees issued visas by Sousa Mendes were allowed to continue on their way to Portugal[tpl]sfn|Milgram|2011|p=136[/tpl] and were well received.[tpl]efn-ua|Testimonial from American writer Eugene Bagger: Two Portuguese frontier guards, with rifles flung across their backs, came walking down the line of cars.

It was a new world, a world of friends (…) The soldiers carried large open bags and held them out to the refugees.  Round golden-brown loaves of freshly baked Portuguese bread, still warm from the oven; the best white bread in the world, as we were to find.  Tins of delicious large sardines.  Bars of chocolate.  The ladies distributed sweet crackers and tins of condensed milk for the children.  As long as we live we shall not forget the Portuguese officials of Vilar Formoso.... They fed all comers, regardless of nationality; those who had money paid what they chose to; most refugees had no money, and paid nothing.[/tpl]and on June 26 the main HIAS-HICEM (Jewish relief organization) European Office was authorized by Salazar to be transferred from Paris to Lisbon.

==Disciplinary proceeding and punishment==

Upon returning to Portugal in early July 1940, Sousa Mendes was subjected to a disciplinary proceeding that has been described as "a severe crackdown"[tpl]sfn|Milgram|2011|p=289[/tpl] and "a merciless disciplinary process."Margarida Ramalho, Lisbon:  City During Wartime, p.12.  The charges against him included:  "the violation of Circular 14; the order to the consul in Bayonne to issue visas to all those who asked for them 'with the claim that it was necessary to save all these people'; the order given to the consul in Bayonne to distribute visas free of charge; the permission given by telephone to the consul in Toulouse that he could issue visas; acting in a way that was dishonorable for Portugal vis-à-vis the Spanish and German authorities." the confessed passport forgery to help Luxembourger Paul Miny escape army mobilization, abandoning his post at Bordeaux without authorization and extortion,  this latest one based on the accusation made by the British Embassy.[tpl]sfn |Fralon|2000|pp=106-107[/tpl] Rui Afonso wrote in 1990's Injustiça (Injustice) that the disciplinary action against Sousa Mendes was less due to the granting of too many visas and more the result of his various financial intrigues such as requiring applicants to donate to charity, and his personal use of public monies. Afonso softened this stance in his 1995 book Um Homem Bom (One Good Man). Historian Avraham Milgram observes that Afonso holds a minority view: the mainstream view is that Sousa Mendes was disciplined for the granting of too many visas, in violation of his instructions.[tpl]sfn|Milgram|1999|p=123–156[/tpl]
The accusation asserted that “an atmosphere of panic does in fact provide an extenuating circumstance for the acts committed by the Defendant during the month of June and possibly even for those committed in the second half of the month of May (…), however, the acts committed during that period are no more than a repetition or extension of a procedure that already existed, for which the same extenuating circumstance cannot be invoked. There had been infractions and repetitions long before 15 May (…) as regards his previous good professional conduct, it should be noted that this is the 4th case of disciplinary proceedings brought against the Defendant".
Sousa Mendes submitted his response to the charges on August 12, 1940, in which he clarified his motivation:
On October 19, 1940, the verdict was handed down: "disobeying higher orders during service."Fralon, p.114.  The disciplinary board recommended a demotion.Paldiel, The Righteous Among the Nations, p.268.  On October 30, 1940, Salazar rejected this recommendation and imposed his own sentence: "I sentence Consul First Class, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, to a penalty of one year of inactivity with the right to one half of his rank's pay, being obliged subsequently to be retired."Fralon, p.115. He further ordered that all files in the case be sealed.
There was also an unofficial punishment: the blacklisting and social banishment of Aristides de Sousa Mendes and his family. "My grandfather ... knew there would be some retribution, but to lose everything and have the family disgraced, he never thought it would go that far," said the hero's grandson, also named Aristides.Aristides de Sousa Mendes (grandson) as cited in Mark Fonseca Rendeiro, "The Bravery of a Portuguese War Hero Resonates Today," The Guardian, 29 March 2011. Retrieved 15 March 2014. The family took meals at the soup kitchen of the Jewish community of Lisbon. When told that the soup kitchen was intended for refugees, Sousa Mendes replied, "But we too are refugees."Fralon p.118 and Isaac Bitton testimonial, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 17 May 1990, 6:30-9:45.

According to Milgram, Mendes’ action, while exceptional in its scope, was not unique, as issuing visas in contravention of the Portuguese government's instructions occurred at other Portuguese consulates as well.[tpl]sfn|Milgram|2011|p=89[/tpl]
After the war, with the victory of the Allied forces over the Axis led by Nazi Germany, Salazar took credit for Portugal having received the refugees,Fralon, pp.122 and 126. Sousa Mendes' accuser Teotonio Pereira also took some of the credit:  Fralon, p.106. and the Portuguese history books were written accordingly. Manuela Franco, Director of the Portuguese Foreign Ministry archives, stated in 2000 that "the image of 'Portugal, a safe haven' was born then in Bordeaux, and it lasts to this day."Manuela Franco, "Politics and Morals" in Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Portugal, Spared Lives: The Actions of Three Portuguese Diplomats in World War II, Documentary Exhibition, Catalogue, September 2000, p.19.

==Last years==

Throughout the war years and beyond, Sousa Mendes was optimistic that his punishment would be reversed and his deed would be recognized.[tpl]sfn|Wheeler|1989|p=119-139[/tpl] In a 1945 letter to the Portuguese Parliament, he explained that he had disobeyed orders because he had considered them to be unconstitutional as the Portuguese Constitution forbade discrimination on the basis of religion. This was the first time that Sousa Mendes used this line of argument and he explained that he hadn’t used it before because, being a public official, he did not want to attract publicity and therefore compromise Portugal’s neutrality.[tpl]sfn|Afonso|1995|pp=283-284[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Wheeler|1989|p=129[/tpl]
In 1941 Sousa Mendes applied to the Portuguese bar association and he was admitted to the bar to practice law. But in 1942, he wrote a letter to the bar, explaining that since he was living in a small village, in his mansion at Passal, he was not able to work as a lawyer and he asked for his license to be cancelled.[tpl]cite web|title=Letter from Sousa Mendes to the Portuguese Bar Association|url=http://mvasm.sapo.pt/bc/FichaDoc.aspx?DID=401&CID=3|work=Sousa Mendes Virtual Museum|accessdate=12 April 2014[/tpl]  Later, in 1944, he asked again for readmission and readmission was granted again.Afonso, Rui p. 269Sousa Mendes` complete track record of admissions can be   found at the Portuguese Bar Association summarizes Sousa Mendes’ several admissions. An online version can be found at the Sousa Mendes Virtual Museum in this link http://mvasm.sapo.pt/bc/FichaDoc.aspx?DID=412&CID=3. He then, as a lawyer, won a court case, where he defended two of his sons, Carlos and Sebastian, who were being deprived of Portuguese Citizenship because they had enlisted in the allied armed forces in the UK.[tpl]sfn|Afonso|1995|pp=269-270[/tpl]
Just before the war's end in 1945, Sousa Mendes suffered a stroke that left him at least partially paralyzed and unable to work.[tpl]sfn|Afonso|1995|p=275[/tpl]A letter writen by Sousa Mendes, saying he is ill and unable to work, can be found at the Portugures Bar Association, an online copy can be found in the Sousa Mendes Virtual Museum at http://mvasm.sapo.pt/bc/FichaDoc.aspx?DID=411&CID=3
In 1946, a Portuguese journalist tried to raise awareness for Sousa Mendes outside of Portugal by publishing the facts under a pseudonym in a US newspaper.Miguel Valle Ávila, “Was Lisbon Journalist ‘Onix’ Portugal’s Deep Throat? Aristides de Sousa Mendes Defended in the US Press in 1946,” The Portuguese Tribune (1 October 2013): 28.  Sousa Mendes' wife Angelina died in 1948.[tpl]sfn|Afonso|1995|p=294[/tpl]
The following year he married his former mistress Andrée Cibial, with whom he had a daughter, Marie-Rose. Andrée soon clashed with Sousa Mendes' sons and the couple moved to Cabanas de Viriato. It did not take long for Andrée to show to Sousa Mendes's sons that they were not welcome at Passal and soon the youngsters were separated from their father.[tpl]sfn|Afonso|1995|p=303[/tpl] John Paul joined other brothers and sisters already living in California. Pedro Nuno left to the Congo. Geraldo went to Angola and Clotilde went to Mozambique.[tpl]sfn|Afonso|1995|p=303[/tpl] On the account of Andrée`s spending habits, Sousa Mendes also started to have disputes with his brothers Cesar and Joao Paulo and his cousin Silverio.[tpl]sfn|Afonso|1995|pp=306-307[/tpl]
As his financial situation deteriorated he would sometimes write to the people he had helped asking for money. On one occasion Maurice de Rothschild sent him 30,000 Portuguese Escudos, a considerable amount of money for Portugal at that time.[tpl]sfn|Afonso|1995|pp=289-290[/tpl]
In 1950 Sousa Mendes and Andrée travelled to France. Their daughter, Marie-Rose had been raised in France by her aunt and uncle and she was ten when she met her father for the first time; her parents then started to spend the summer months with her each year.[tpl]sfn|Afonso|1995|p=307[/tpl]
In his final years, Sousa Mendes was abandoned by most of his colleagues and friends and at times was blamed by some of his close relatives.Luis-Filipe de Sousa Mendes, "Words of Remembrance," 1987, Sousa Mendes Foundation. Retrieved 15 March 2014. His children moved to other countries in search of opportunities they were now denied in Portugal, although by all accounts they never blamed their father or regretted his decision.Luis-Filipe de Sousa Mendes, "Words of Remembrance", 1987, Sousa Mendes Foundation. Retrieved 15 March 2014.  He asked his children to help clear the family name and make the story known. In 1951, one of his sons, Sebastião, published a novella about the Bordeaux events, Flight Through Hell.Michael d'Avranches Sebastião de Sousa Mendes, Flight Through Hell, New York:  Exposition Press, 1951.Sebastian Mendes, "Lifelong Champion of Major Holocaust Hero Dies", 17 December 2006. Retrieved 15 March 2014.  César de Sousa Mendes, twin brother of Aristides, did everything he could to try to get Salazar to reverse his punishment, but to no avail.Fralon, pp.124-25.  Sousa Mendes never regretted his action.  "I could not have acted otherwise, and I therefore accept all that has befallen me with love,"Aristides de Sousa Mendes, as cited in Paldiel, The Righteous Among the Nations, p.268. he reportedly said.  To his lawyer he wrote:
Sousa Mendes always lived with financial problems and Andrée’s spending habits did not help him much. The couple eventually ended up selling all their furniture from their family mansion and raising debts with banks.[tpl]sfn |Fralon|2000|pp=136-138[/tpl] Sousa Mendes died in poverty on April 3, 1954, owing money to his lenders and still in disgrace with his government.[tpl]sfn |Fralon|2000|p=142[/tpl]

==Number of visa recipients==

It is impossible to determine the precise number of refugees who were granted visas by Sousa Mendes, although all sources agree that the number was in the thousands, and most say that it was in the tens of thousands.  Holocaust scholar Yehuda Bauer characterized Sousa Mendes' deed as "perhaps the largest rescue action by a single individual during the Holocaust."Yehuda Bauer, A History of the Holocaust, Franklin Watts, 2002, p.235. One generally accepted figure is that he issued visas to approximately 30,000 people, of whom around 10,000 were Jews.[tpl]sfn |Wheeler|1989|pp=119-139[/tpl]  This figure includes not only those refugees who successfully transited through Portugal, but also those trapped by the Portuguese government's order to seal the French/Spanish border on June 24, 1940."Spain Halts Flow of War Refugees; Border Guards Hold Up Most of Those Seeking Entrance," The New York Times, 25 June 1940, p.3; "American Writers Escape Into Spain," The New York Times, 26 June 1940, p.15.
In 1999 Yad Vashem historian Avraham Milgram published a study where he asserted that "the discrepancy between the reality and the myth of the number of visas granted by Sousa Mendes is great."[tpl]sfn|Milgram|1999|pp=123–156[/tpl] To make his point Milgram cross checked the numbers from the Bordeaux ‘s visa register entry books with those of the HICEM reports and although he acknowledged that visas delivered in cities of Bayonne, Hendaye and Toulouse cannot be exactly determined Milgram asserted that the numbers are exaggerated. Again in 2011, Milgram published a densely researched book, “Portugal Salazar and the Jews” and for a second time he asserted that:  "authors, especially those who wish to sing the praises of Aristides de Sousa Mendes, tend to overstate the number of visas with figures that not satisfy research criteria, but rather correspond to their wishful thinking".[tpl]sfn|Milgram|2011|p=121[/tpl] A similar opinion is shared by British historian Neill Lochery, in 2011, Lochery quoted Milgram´s numbers and to further support his view he also cross checked numbers with the Portuguese Emigration Police files and he also concluded that the numbers usually published by popular literature are a “Myth”.[tpl]sfn|Lochery|2011|p=44[/tpl] Both these historians concur that this does not diminish the greatness of Sousa Mendes´s gesture. Rui Afonso, the first Sousa Mendes biographer, also says, that José Seabra, Sousa Mendes´ deputy at Bordeaux, always testified that the order of magnitude of irregular visas issued at Bordeaux was within hundreds.[tpl]sfn|Afonso|1995|p=283[/tpl]
In 2008 the Portuguese ambassador João Hall Themido took a stand affirming that in his opinion the Sousa Mendes story was a Myth and  asserting his disbelief in the 30,000 figure.[tpl]cite book|last=Themido|first=J.

As a reaction to Milgram´s assertion, French writer, Eric Lebreton, in 2010, argued that “Milgram does not account for the visas that were delivered in Bayonne, Hendaye and Toulouse, and on the other hand, he Milgram holds firm to the number presented in the one surviving registry book of José Seabra (Sousa Mendes' deputy). Milgram's article, while very interesting in other ways, lacks details and knowledge on this point.”Lebreton p.231

==Posthumous rehabilitation and recognition==

From 1954 on, Sousa Mendes' childrenParticularly active were Sebastião, Joana, John Paul, Luis Felipe and Pedro Nuno. worked tirelessly to clear his name and make the story known.  In the early 1960s a few articles began appearing in the U.S. press.Examples include Guy Wright, "Straightening the Record on Dictator and a Hero," San Francisco New Call Bulletin, 4 May 1961 and an article in the Portuguese press of Massachusetts:  "Um português salvou 10.000 judeus no tempo da guerra, mas foi castigado," Diario de Noticias (New Bedford, MA), 19 May 1961, pp.1 and 5. On February 21, 1961, Ben Gurion, the Prime Minister of Israel, ordered that twenty trees be planted by the Keren Kayemet in memory of Sousa Mendes and in recognition of his deed."Um português salvou 10.000 judeus no tempo da guerra, mas foi castigado," Diario de Noticias (New Bedford, MA), 19 May 1961, p.5.  In 1963, the Israeli Holocaust authority Yad Vashem began recognizing Holocaust rescuers as Righteous Among the Nations, and Sousa Mendes, in 1966, was among the earliest to be so named, thanks in large part to the efforts of daughter Joana.Robert McG. Thomas Jr., "Joana Mendes, 77, Champion of Father's Effort to Save Jews," The New York Times, 10 April 1997, obituaries, C29. Retrieved 15 March 2014.

Following the 1974 Carnation Revolution in Portugal when the Estado Novo dictatorship was overthrown and democracy was established, Dr. Nuno A. A. de Bessa Lopes, a Portuguese government official, took the initiative of reopening the Sousa Mendes case and making recommendations.Reese Erlich, "Mending the Past; Belatedly, the righteous Dr. Mendes has been recognized. Full recognition, however, has yet to come," Moment, June 1987, p.52. His assessment, based on his viewing of previously sealed government files, was that the Salazar government had knowingly sacrificed Sousa Mendes for its own political ends, and that the verdict and punishment were illegal and should be overturned.Fralon, p.151.  "Aristides de Sousa Mendes was condemned for having refused to be an accomplice to Nazi war crimes,"Bessa Lopes report as cited in Fralon, p.152. the report concluded. The report was suppressed by the Portuguese government for over a decade.Reese Erlich, "Portugal's President to Honor Diplomat Who Defied Holocaust," Christian Science Monitor, 19 May 1987, p. 4. Retrieved 15 March 2014.  "The failure to act on the Lopes report reflects the fact that there was never a serious purge of Fascist supporters from government ministries,"Erlich, "Mending the Past," p.53. explained journalist Reese Erlich.
In 1986, inspired by the election of Mário Soares, a civilian president in Portugal, Sousa Mendes' youngest son John Paul began to circulate a petition to the Portuguese president within his adopted country, the United States. "I want people in Portugal to know who he was, what he did, and why he did it,"John Paul Abranches, as cited in Erlich, "Mending the Past," p.54. explained John Paul. He and his wife Joan worked with Robert Jacobvitz, an executive at the Jewish Federation of the Greater East Bay in Oakland, California, and lawyer Anne Treseder to create the "International Committee to Commemorate Dr. Aristides de Sousa Mendes."Robert Jacobvitz, "Reinstating the Name and Honor of a Portuguese Diplomat Who Rescued Jews During World War II: Community Social Work Strategies," Journal of Jewish Communal Service, Spring 2008 and Jonathan Curiel, John Paul Abranches, Hero Envoy's Son, Dies," San Francisco Chronicle, 19 February 2009.

In 1987, the Portuguese Republic began to rehabilitate Sousa Mendes' memory and granted him a posthumous Order of Liberty medal, one of that country's highest honors, although the consul's diplomatic honors still were not restored.
