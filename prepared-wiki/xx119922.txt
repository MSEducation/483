==Early years==

Steward was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Dorothy, a homemaker, and Harold Steward, a mechanic.http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/biography/S-Z/Steward-David-L-1951.html As a child growing up in Clinton, Missouri, Steward faced poverty and discrimination.  
"I vividly remember segregation—separate schools, sitting in the balcony at the movie theater, being barred from the public swimming pool," notes Steward, who was among a small group of African-American high-school students who integrated the public swimming pool in Clinton in 1967. "These experiences had a profound effect on the man I am today. I am not one to back down when it comes to taking a stand for what I believe." Steward found a purpose for the hardship he encountered in his early years—it strengthened his character and taught him perseverance. "The adversities I encountered during my youth served as my training ground for hard times I eventually faced as a struggling entrepreneur." Steward, David L., and Robert L. Shook, Doing Business by the Good Book , New York: Hyperion, 2004 
A determined student, Steward received his B.S. degree in business from Central Missouri State University in 1973.

==Business career==

After graduating from college, Steward worked at Wagner Electric as a production manager (1974–1975), a sales representative at Missouri Pacific Railroad Company(1975–1979), and a senior account executive at Federal Express (1979–1984), where he was recognized as salesman of the year and inducted into the company's hall of fame in 1981.  He owned Transportation Business Specialists and Transport Administrative Services in the years leading up to founding World Wide Technology.

===Founding World Wide Technology===

In 1990, Steward, Jim Kavanaugh and others founded World Wide Technology, a leading systems integrator that provides technology products, services and supply chain solutions to customers around the globe. In 1993, WWT concentrated its focus on the implementation of enterprise wide imaging, conversion services, and telecommunication networks. These integrated solutions have greatly enhanced WWT's overall market position and long term viability.http://www.ucmo.edu/market/html/amaexec.html#steward
In 1999 World Wide Technology spun off its telecommunications division to form Telcobuy.com. Sales for the two companies continued to grow, although revenues slipped in 2002 as World Wide Technology felt the impact of the technology recession. In 2003 combined reported revenues passed $1 billion, and Steward formed World Wide Technology Holding Company as the parent company for the two firms. 
In 2011, World Wide Technology's annual revenue are estimated to be greater than $3.2 billion, ranking it as one of St. Louis’ largest private companies.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/print-edition/2010/12/10/world-wide-technology-incs-sales.html | date=10 December 2010 | first=Rick | last=Desloge | title=World Wide Technology Inc.'s sales pass $3 billion[/tpl]

==Personal life==

Steward is married to Thelma Steward, and the couple has two adult children. His pastor, Dr. Lynn Mims, of Union Memorial United Methodist Church, asked him to start a Sunday school class for businesspeople. Steward was concerned about the long-term commitment but wanted to somehow accommodate his pastor’s request. His wife, Thelma, reminded him what the Bible says in Luke 12:48, "From everyone to whom much has been given, much will be required." So they started the Bible study and called it Doing Business By the Book, the catalyst for his book, Doing Business by the Good Book: 52 Lessons on Success Straight from the Bible. Today the class is attended by governors of Missouri, past and present; Senators; Congressman; and other dignitaries.http://www.cbn.com/700club/guests/bios/David_Steward_012704.aspx
