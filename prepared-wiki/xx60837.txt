[[Three-letter acronym]]

CATEGORIES: Abbreviations, Acronyms

A three-letter acronym, three-letter abbreviation, or TLA is an abbreviation, specifically an acronym, alphabetism, or initialism, consisting of three letters. These are usually the initial letters of the words of the phrase abbreviated, and are written in capital letters (upper case); three-letter abbreviations such as etc. and Mrs. are not three-letter acronyms.
Most three-letter abbreviations are initialisms: all the letters are pronounced as the names of letters, as in APA [tpl]IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|p|iː|ˈ|eɪ[/tpl] [tpl]respell|AY|pee|AY|'[/tpl]. Some are acronyms pronounced as a word; computed axial tomography, CAT, is almost always pronounced as the animal's name in "CAT scan".

==History and origins==

The exact phrase three-letter acronym appeared in the literature in 1975.[tpl]cite journal |first=M.

Hull (1982) An Introduction to the new Productivity Information Management System page 176
In 1980, the manual for the Sinclair ZX81 home computer used and explained TLA.Steven Vickers ZX81 Basic Programming, Sinclair Research Limited, page 161 "As you can see, everything has a three letter abbreviation (TLA)." In 1988, in a paper titled "On the cruelty of really teaching computer science", eminent computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra wrote 
"Because no endeavour is respectable these days without a TLA  ..."On the cruelty of really teaching computer science By 1992 it was in a Microsoft handbook.Dan Gookin (1992) The Microsoft Guide to Optimizing Windows page 211
Use of "TLA" spread through both industry and academia, and it has now become a generally understood initialism.

==Combinatorics==

The number of possible three-letter abbreviations using the 26 letters of the alphabet from A to Z (AAA, AAB ... to ZZY, ZZZ) is 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576. Another 26 × 26 × 10 = 6760 can be produced if the third element is allowed to be a digit 0-9, giving a total of 24,336. 
In English, WWW is the longest possible TLA to pronounce, typically requiring nine syllables. Although in written English it is an abbreviation, in spoken English it ordinarily uses more syllables than the words it is abbreviating.
