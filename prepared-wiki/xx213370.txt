Mercury is a chemical element with the symbol Hg and atomic number 80. It is commonly known as quicksilver and was formerly named hydrargyrum (from Greek "hydr-" water and "argyros" silver). A heavy, silvery d-block element, mercury is the only metallic element that is liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is bromine, though metals such as caesium, gallium, and rubidium melt just above room temperature.
Mercury occurs in deposits throughout the world mostly as cinnabar (mercuric sulfide). The red pigment vermilion, a pure form of mercuric sulfide, is mostly obtained by reaction of mercury (produced by reduction from cinnabar) with sulfur.  Mercury poisoning can result from exposure to water-soluble forms of mercury (such as mercuric chloride or methylmercury), inhalation of mercury vapor, or eating seafood contaminated with mercury.
Mercury is used in thermometers, barometers, manometers, sphygmomanometers, float valves, mercury switches, mercury relays, fluorescent lamps and other devices, though concerns about the element's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favour of alternatives such as alcohol- or galinstan-filled glass thermometers and thermistor- or infrared-based electronic instruments.  Likewise, mechanical pressure gauges and electronic strain gauge sensors have replaced mercury sphygmomanometers. Mercury remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam material for dental restoration in some locales. It is used in lighting: electricity passed through mercury vapor in a fluorescent lamp produces short-wave ultraviolet light which then causes the phosphor in the tube to fluoresce, making visible light.

==Properties==

===Physical properties===

Mercury is a heavy, silvery-white metal. As compared to other metals, it is a poor conductor of heat, but a fair conductor of electricity.Hammond, C. R The Elements in [tpl]RubberBible86th[/tpl] Mercury has a freezing point of −38.83 °C and a boiling point of 356.73 °C,[tpl]cite web|url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/inorganic/faq/why-is-mercury-liquid.shtml| title=Why is mercury a liquid at STP?| accessdate=May 1, 2007| publisher=General Chemistry Online at Frostburg State University| author=Senese, F[/tpl][tpl]RubberBible86th|pages=4.125–4.126[/tpl] which are exceptionally low for a metal, and it is the only elemental metal known to melt at a generally cold temperature. A complete explanation of this delves deep into the realm of quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electron configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells. Since this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gas elements, which form weak bonds and become solids which melt easily at relatively low temperatures.
The stability of the 6s shell is due to the presence of a filled 4f shell. An f shell poorly screens the nuclear charge that increases the attractive Coulomb interaction of the 6s shell and the nucleus (see lanthanide contraction). The absence of a filled inner f shell is the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc, although both these metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points.
On the other hand, gold, which is one space to the left of mercury on the periodic table, has atoms with one less 6s electron than mercury. Those electrons are more easily removed and are shared between the gold atoms forming relatively strong metallic bonds.[tpl]cite journal|author=Norrby, L.J.|title=Why is mercury liquid?

===Chemical properties===

Mercury does not react with most acids, such as dilute sulfuric acid, although oxidizing acids such as concentrated sulfuric acid and nitric acid or aqua regia dissolve it to give sulfate, nitrate, and chloride salts. Like silver, mercury reacts with atmospheric hydrogen sulfide. Mercury even reacts with solid sulfur flakes, which are used in mercury spill kits to absorb mercury vapors (spill kits also use activated carbon and powdered zinc).

====Amalgams====

Mercury dissolves many other metals such as gold and silver to form amalgams. Iron is an exception and iron flasks have been traditionally used to trade mercury. Several other first row transition metals with the exception of manganese, copper and zinc are reluctant to form amalgams. Other elements that do not readily form amalgams with mercury include platinum and a few other metals.[tpl]cite book|author=Gmelin, Leopold |title=Hand book of chemistry|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1AI5AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA128|accessdate=30 December 2012|year=1852|publisher=Cavendish Society|pages=103 (Na), 110 (W), 122 (Zn), 128 (Fe), 247 (Au), 338 (Pt)[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author=Soratur|title=Essentials of Dental Materials|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N6HbxyaSt78C&pg=PT14|year= 2002|publisher=Jaypee Brothers Publishers|isbn=978-81-7179-989-3|page=14[/tpl] Sodium amalgam is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis, and is also used in high-pressure sodium lamps.
Mercury readily combines with aluminium to form a mercury-aluminium amalgam when the two pure metals come into contact. Since the amalgam destroys the aluminium oxide layer which protects metallic aluminium from oxidizing in-depth (as in iron rusting), even small amounts of mercury can seriously corrode aluminium. For this reason, mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.[tpl]cite book |author =Vargel, C.; Jacques, M.; Schmidt, M.

Mercury embrittlement is the most common type of liquid metal embrittlement.

===Isotopes===

There are seven stable isotopes of mercury with [tpl]chem|202|Hg[/tpl] being the most abundant (29.86%). The longest-lived radioisotopes are [tpl]chem|194|Hg[/tpl] with a half-life of 444 years, and [tpl]chem|203|Hg[/tpl] with a half-life of 46.612 days. Most of the remaining radioisotopes have half-lives that are less than a day. [tpl]chem|199|Hg[/tpl] and [tpl]chem|201|Hg[/tpl] are the most often studied NMR-active nuclei, having spins of [tpl]frac|2[/tpl] and [tpl]frac|3|2[/tpl] respectively.

==History==

Mercury was found in Egyptian tombs that date from 1500 BC.[tpl]cite web|title=Mercury and the environment — Basic facts|publisher=Environment Canada, Federal Government of Canada| year=2004|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/mercure-mercury/default.asp?lang=En&n=9A4397AD-1|accessdate=2008-03-27[/tpl]

Alchemists thought of mercury as the First Matter from which all metals were formed. They believed that different metals could be produced by varying the quality and quantity of sulfur contained within the mercury. The purest of these was gold, and mercury was called for in attempts at the transmutation of base (or impure) metals into gold, which was the goal of many alchemists.[tpl]cite book |title = Story of Alchemy and Early Chemistry|author = Stillman, J.

Hg is the modern chemical symbol for mercury. It comes from hydrargyrum, a Latinized form of the Greek word Ύδραργυρος (hydrargyros), which is a compound word meaning "water-silver" (hydr- = water, argyros = silver) — since it is liquid like water and shiny like silver. The element was named after the Roman god Mercury, known for speed and mobility. It is associated with the planet Mercury; the astrological symbol for the planet is also one of the alchemical symbols for the metal; the Sanskrit word for alchemy is Rasavātam which means "the way of mercury".[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ykEN2zHvCpQC&pg=PA260|page=260|title=The Pillar of Celestial Fire|author=Cox, R|publisher=1st World Publishing|year= 1997|isbn=1-887472-30-4[/tpl] Mercury is the only metal for which the alchemical planetary name became the common name.
The mines in Almadén (Spain), Monte Amiata (Italy), and Idrija (now Slovenia) dominated mercury production from the opening of the mine in Almadén 2500 years ago, until new deposits were found at the end of the 19th century.[tpl]cite book|title =Mercury hazards to living organisms|author= Eisler, R.| publisher = CRC Press|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0-8493-9212-2|url = http://books.google.com/?id=gqc8wUvsI8cC&pg[/tpl]

==Occurrence==

Mercury is an extremely rare element in the Earth's crust, having an average crustal abundance by mass of only 0.08 parts per million (ppm).[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=GerdDmwMTLkC&pg=PA265|page=265|title=Geomicrobiology|author=Ehrlich, H. L.; Newman D. K.|publisher=CRC Press| year=2008|isbn=978-0-8493-7906-2[/tpl] However, because it does not blend geochemically with those elements that constitute the majority of the crustal mass, mercury ores can be extraordinarily concentrated considering the element's abundance in ordinary rock. The richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury (12,000 times average crustal abundance). It is found either as a native metal (rare) or in cinnabar, corderoite, livingstonite and other minerals, with cinnabar (HgS) being the most common ore.[tpl]cite journal|doi = 10.1007/s00254-002-0629-5|title=Mercury from mineral deposits and potential environmental impact |journal=Environmental Geology|volume=43|issue=3|pages=326–338|author=Rytuba, James J[/tpl] Mercury ores usually occur in very young orogenic belts where rock of high density are forced to the crust of the Earth, often in hot springs or other volcanic regions.[tpl]cite web|accessdate=2009-07-07|title=Mercury Recycling in the United States in 2000|publisher=USGS|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/c1196u/Circ_1196_U.pdf[/tpl]
Beginning in 1558, with the invention of the patio process to extract silver from ore using mercury, mercury became an essential resource in the economy of Spain and its American colonies. Mercury was used to extract silver from the lucrative mines in New Spain and Peru. Initially, the Spanish Crown's mines in Almaden in Southern Spain supplied all the mercury for the colonies.[tpl]cite book|author=Burkholder, M. and Johnson, L.|title=Colonial Latin America|publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2008|pages=157–159|isbn=0-19-504542-4[/tpl] Mercury deposits were discovered in the New World, and more than 100,000 tons of mercury were mined from the region of Huancavelica, Peru, over the course of three centuries following the discovery of deposits there in 1563. The patio process and later pan amalgamation process continued to create great demand for mercury to treat silver ores until the late 19th century.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=a4hPCX2XWDIC&pg=PA33|page=33|title=Domestic Architecture and Power|author=Jamieson, R W|publisher=Springer|year=2000|isbn=0-306-46176-5[/tpl]
Former mines in Italy, the United States and Mexico which once produced a large proportion of the world supply have now been completely mined out or, in the case of Slovenia (Idrija) and Spain (Almadén), shut down due to the fall of the price of mercury. Nevada's McDermitt Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed in 1992. The price of mercury has been highly volatile over the years and in 2006 was $650 per 76-pound (34.46 kg) flask.[tpl]cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/mercury/mercumcs07.pdf|format=PDF|title=Mercury|author=Brooks, W.

Mercury is extracted by heating cinnabar in a current of air and condensing the vapor. The equation for this extraction is
In 2005, China was the top producer of mercury with almost two-thirds global share followed by Kyrgyzstan.[tpl]cite book|title=World Mineral Production|date= May 2001|publisher= British Geological Survey, NERC|location= London|year= 2007[/tpl] Several other countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents.
Because of the high toxicity of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning.About the Mercury Rule. Act.credoaction.com (2011-12-21). Retrieved on 2012-12-30. In China, prison labor was used by a private mining company as recently as the 1950s to create new cinnabar mercury mines. Thousands of prisoners were used by the Luo Xi mining company to establish new tunnels. In addition, worker health in functioning mines is at high risk.
The European Union directive calling for compact fluorescent bulbs to be made mandatory by 2012 has encouraged China to re-open deadly cinnabar mines to obtain the mercury required for CFL bulb manufacture. As a result, environmental dangers have been a concern, particularly in the southern cities of Foshan and Guangzhou, and in the Guizhou province in the south west.[tpl]cite news|author=Sheridan, M. |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6211261.ece |title='Green' Lightbulbs Poison Workers: hundreds of factory staff are being made ill by mercury used in bulbs destined for the West|date=May 3, 2009|publisher=The Sunday Times (of London, UK)[/tpl]
Abandoned mercury mine processing sites often contain very hazardous waste piles of roasted cinnabar calcines. Water run-off from such sites is a recognized source of ecological damage. Former mercury mines may be suited for constructive re-use. For example, in 1976 Santa Clara County, California purchased the historic Almaden Quicksilver Mine and created a county park on the site, after conducting extensive safety and environmental analysis of the property.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=C6N03Lww1YsC&pg=PA8|page=8|title=New Almaden|author=Boulland M|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year= 2006|isbn=0-7385-3131-6[/tpl]

==Chemistry==

Mercury exists in two main oxidation states, I and II. Higher oxidation states are unimportant, but have been detected, e.g., mercury(IV) fluoride ([tpl]chem|HgF|4[/tpl]) but only under extraordinary conditions.[tpl]cite journal|title=Mercury Is a Transition Metal: The First Experimental Evidence for HgF4|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|publisher=Wiley-VCH |volume=46|issue=44|doi=10.1002/anie.200703710|year=2007|pmid=17899620|last1=Wang|first1=X|last2=Andrews|first2=L|last3=Riedel|first3=S|last4=Kaupp|first4=M|pages=8371–5[/tpl]

===Compounds of mercury(I)===

Different from its lighter neighbors, cadmium and zinc, mercury usually forms simple stable compounds with metal-metal bonds. Most mercury(I) compounds are diamagnetic and feature the dimeric cation, Hg[tpl]su|b=2|p=2+[/tpl]. Stable derivatives include the chloride and nitrate. Treatment of Hg(I) compounds complexation with strong ligands such as sulfide, cyanide, etc. induces disproportionation to [tpl]chem|Hg|2+[/tpl] and elemental mercury.[tpl]cite book| title = Main group chemistry| author = Henderson, W.|location=Great Britain| publisher = Royal Society of Chemistry|year = 2000| isbn = 0-85404-617-8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=twdXz1jfVOsC&pg=PA162|page=162[/tpl] Mercury(I) chloride, a colorless solid also known as calomel, is really the compound with the formula Hg2Cl2, with the connectivity Cl-Hg-Hg-Cl. It is a standard in electrochemistry. It reacts with chlorine to give mercuric chloride, which resists further oxidation. Mercury(I) hydride, a colorless gas, is the compound with the formula HgH.
Indicative of its tendency to bond to itself, mercury forms mercury polycations, which consist of linear chains of mercury centers, capped with a positive charge. One example is [tpl]chem|Hg|3|2+|(AsF|6|-|)[/tpl][tpl]su|b=2[/tpl].[tpl]cite doi|10.1021/ic00194a020[/tpl]

===Compounds of mercury(II)===

Mercury(II) is the most common oxidation state and is the main one in nature as well. All four mercuric halides are known. They form tetrahedral complexes with other ligands but the halides adopt linear coordination geometry, somewhat like Ag+ does. Best known is mercury(II) chloride, an easily sublimating white solid. HgCl2 forms coordination complexes that are typically tetrahedral, e.g. [tpl]chem|HgCl|4|2-[/tpl].
Mercury(II) oxide, the main oxide of mercury, arises when the metal is exposed to air for long periods at elevated temperatures. It reverts to the elements upon heating near 400 °C, as was demonstrated by Joseph Priestley in an early synthesis of pure oxygen.[tpl]Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd[/tpl] Hydroxides of mercury are poorly characterized, as they are for its neighbors gold and silver.
Being a soft metal, mercury forms very stable derivatives with the heavier chalcogens. Preeminent is mercury(II) sulfide, HgS, which occurs in nature as the ore cinnabar and is the brilliant pigment vermillion. Like ZnS, HgS crystallizes in two forms, the reddish cubic form and the black zinc blende form. Mercury(II) selenide (HgSe) and mercury(II) telluride (HgTe) are also known, these as well as various derivatives, e.g. mercury cadmium telluride and mercury zinc telluride being semiconductors useful as infrared detector materials.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=4b3WLgomvd0C&pg=PA507|page=507|title=Infrared detectors|author=Rogalski, A|publisher=CRC Press|year=2000|isbn=90-5699-203-1[/tpl]
Mercury(II) salts form a variety of complex derivatives with ammonia. These include Millon's base (Hg2N+), the one-dimensional polymer (salts of [tpl]chem|HgNH|2|+[/tpl])[tpl]su|b=n[/tpl]), and "fusible white precipitate" or Hg(NH3)2Cl2. Known as Nessler's reagent, potassium tetraiodomercurate(II) ([tpl]chem|HgI|4|2-[/tpl]) is still occasionally used to test for ammonia owing to its tendency to form the deeply colored iodide salt of Millon's base.
Mercury fulminate is a detonator widely used in explosives.

===Higher oxidation states===

Oxidation states above +2 in a non-charged species are extremely rare, although a cyclic mercurinium(IV) cation, with three substituents, may be an intermediate in oxymercuration reactions.[tpl]cite book|author1=Bamford, C.H. |author2=Compton, R.G. |author3=Tipper, C.F.H. |title=Addition and Elimination Reactions of Aliphatic Compounds|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OJevSztje7IC&pg=PA49|year=1973|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-41051-1|pages=49–[/tpl][tpl]cite book|author1=Carey, Francis A. and Sundberg, Richard J. |title=Advanced Organic Chemistry: Part A: Structure and Mechanisms|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=g5dYyJMBhCoC&pg=PA517|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-44897-8|pages=517–[/tpl] In 2007, a report of synthesis of a mercury(IV) compound, mercury(IV) fluoride, was published.[tpl]cite journal |author=Xuefang Wang|coauthors=Lester Andrews; Sebastian Riedel; and Martin Kaupp|title=Mercury Is a Transition Metal: The First Experimental Evidence for HgF4|journal=Angew.

===Organomercury compounds===

Organic mercury compounds are historically important but are of little industrial value in the western world. Mercury(II) salts are a rare examples of simple metal complexes that react directly with aromatic rings. Organomercury compounds are always divalent and usually two-coordinate and linear geometry. Unlike organocadmium and organozinc compounds, organomercury compounds do not react with water. They usually have the formula HgR2, which are often volatile, or HgRX, which are often solids, where R is aryl or alkyl and X is usually halide or acetate. Methylmercury, a generic term for compounds with the formula CH3HgX, is a dangerous family of compounds that are often found in polluted water.[tpl]cite book| url = http://books.google.com/?id=BPvWJbBMd7wC|title = Toxicological effects of methylmercury|author = National Research Council (U.S.) – Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology| publisher = National Academies Press|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0-309-07140-6[/tpl] They arise by a process known as biomethylation.

==Applications==

Mercury is used primarily for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications. It is used in some thermometers, especially ones which are used to measure high temperatures. A still increasing amount is used as gaseous mercury in fluorescent lamps, while most of the other applications are slowly phased out due to health and safety regulations and is in some applications replaced with less toxic but considerably more expensive Galinstan alloy.[tpl]cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00216-005-0069-7|date=Nov 2005|author=Surmann, P; Zeyat, H|title=Voltammetric analysis using a self-renewable non-mercury electrode.|volume=383|issue=6|pages=1009–13|pmid=16228199|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry[/tpl]

===Medicine===

Mercury and its compounds have been used in medicine, although they are much less common today than they once were, now that the toxic effects of mercury and its compounds are more widely understood. The first edition of the Merck's Manual featured many mercuric compounds[tpl]cite web|title=Merck's Manual First Edition 1899|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/41697|accessdate=2013-06-16[/tpl] such as:
The element mercury is an ingredient in dental amalgams. Thiomersal (called Thimerosal in the United States) is an organic compound used as a preservative in vaccines, though this use is in decline.[tpl]cite web|author = FDA|url = http://www.fda.gov/Cber/vaccine/thimerosal.htm|title = Thimerosal in Vaccines|accessdate=October 25, 2006[/tpl] Thiomersal is metabolized to ethyl mercury. Although it was widely speculated that this mercury-based preservative could cause or trigger autism in children, scientific studies showed no evidence supporting any such link.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2004 |volume=114 |title= Thimerosal-containing vaccines and autistic spectrum disorder: a critical review of published original data |author= Parker SK, Schwartz B, Todd J, Pickering LK |doi=10.1542/peds.2004-0434 |pmid=15342856|issue=3 |pages=793–804[/tpl] Erratum (2005). Pediatrics 115 (1): 200. [tpl]DOI|10.1542/peds.2004-2402[/tpl] PMID 15630018. Nevertheless thiomersal has been removed from or reduced to trace amounts in all U.S. vaccines recommended for children 6 years of age and under, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine.[tpl]cite web |date=2007-09-06 |url=http://www.fda.gov/cber/vaccine/thimerosal.htm |accessdate=2007-10-01 |title= Thimerosal in vaccines |publisher= Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration[/tpl]
Another mercury compound merbromin (Mercurochrome) is a topical antiseptic used for minor cuts and scrapes is still in use in some countries.
Mercury in the form of one of its common ores, cinnabar, is used in various traditional medicines, especially in traditional Chinese medicine. Review of its safety has found cinnabar can lead to significant mercury intoxication when heated, consumed in overdose or taken long term, and can have adverse effects at therapeutic doses, though this is typically reversible at therapeutic doses. Although this form of mercury appears less toxic than others, its use in traditional Chinese medicine has not yet been justified as the therapeutic basis for the use of cinnabar is not clear.[tpl]cite journal |author=Liu J, Shi JZ, Yu LM, Goyer RA, Waalkes MP |title=Mercury in traditional medicines: is cinnabar toxicologically similar to common mercurials? |journal=Exp.

Today, the use of mercury in medicine has greatly declined in all respects, especially in developed countries. Thermometers and sphygmomanometers containing mercury were invented in the early 18th and late 19th centuries, respectively. In the early 21st century, their use is declining and has been banned in some countries, states and medical institutions.

===Production of chlorine and caustic soda===

Chlorine is produced from sodium chloride (common salt, NaCl) using electrolysis to separate the metallic sodium from the chlorine gas. Usually the salt is dissolved in water to produce a brine. By-products of any such chloralkali process are hydrogen (H2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which is commonly called caustic soda or lye. By far the largest use of mercury[tpl]cite book|title=The CRB Commodity Yearbook (annual)|year= 2000|page=173|issn=1076-2906[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/pubs/600r02104/600r02104chap3.pdf|format=PDF|author=Leopold, B.

After about 1985, all new chloralkali production facilities that were built in the United States used either membrane cell or diaphragm cell technologies to produce chlorine.

===Laboratory uses===

Some medical thermometers, especially those for high temperatures, are filled with mercury; however, they are gradually disappearing. In the United States, non-prescription sale of mercury fever thermometers has been banned since 2003.[tpl]cite news| title = Mercury Reduction Act of 2003|url = http://openlibrary.org/b/OL17617678M|accessdate = 2009-06-06| publisher = United States.

Mercury is also found in liquid mirror telescopes.
Some transit telescopes use a basin of mercury to form a flat and absolutely horizontal mirror, useful in determining an absolute vertical or perpendicular reference.  Concave horizontal parabolic mirrors may be formed by rotating liquid mercury on a disk, the parabolic form of the liquid thus formed reflecting and focusing incident light. Such telescopes are cheaper than conventional large mirror telescopes by up to a factor of 100, but the mirror cannot be tilted and always points straight up.[tpl]cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030818233315/http://www.govertschilling.nl/artikelen/science/030314_sc.htm|url=http://www.govertschilling.nl/artikelen/science/030314_sc.htm|title=Liquid-mirror telescope set to give stargazing a new spin|date=2003-03-14|archivedate=2003-08-18|publisher=Govert Schilling|accessdate=2008-10-11[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|author = Gibson, B.

===Niche uses===

Gaseous mercury is used in mercury-vapor lamps and some "neon sign" type advertising signs and fluorescent lamps. Those low-pressure lamps emit very spectrally narrow lines, which are traditionally used in optical spectroscopy for calibration of spectral position. Commercial calibration lamps are sold for this purpose; however simply reflecting some of the fluorescent-lamp ceiling light into a spectrometer is a common calibration practice.[tpl]cite book|title = A guide to the use and calibration of detector array equipment| author = Hopkinson, G.

Mercury, as thiomersal, is widely used in the manufacture of mascara. In 2008, Minnesota became the first state in the United States to ban intentionally added mercury in cosmetics, giving it a tougher standard than the federal government.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cidpusa.org/mercury.htm|publisher=CIDPUSA|title=Mercury in your eye?|date=2008-02-16|accessdate=2009-12-20[/tpl]

===Historic uses===

Many historic applications made use of the peculiar physical properties of mercury, especially as a dense liquid and a liquid metal:
Others applications made use of the chemical properties of mercury:

====Historic medicinal uses====

Mercury(I) chloride (also known as calomel or mercurous chloride) has been used in traditional medicine as a diuretic, topical disinfectant, and laxative. Mercury(II) chloride (also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate) was once used to treat syphilis (along with other mercury compounds), although it is so toxic that sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat.[tpl]cite news|author=Pimple, K.D.

Blue mass, a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient, was prescribed throughout the 19th century for numerous conditions including constipation, depression, child-bearing and toothaches. In the early 20th century, mercury was administered to children yearly as a laxative and dewormer, and it was used in teething powders for infants. The mercury-containing organohalide merbromin (sometimes sold as Mercurochrome) is still widely used but has been banned in some countries such as the U.S.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2518/what-happened-to-mercurochrome|accessdate=2009-07-07|title=What happened to Mercurochrome?|date= 2004-07-23[/tpl]

==Toxicity and safety==

Mercury and most of its compounds are extremely toxic and must be handled with care; in cases of spills involving mercury (such as from certain thermometers or fluorescent light bulbs), specific cleaning procedures are used to avoid exposure and contain the spill.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/mercury/spills/index.htm|title=Mercury: Spills, Disposal and Site Cleanup|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=2007-08-11[/tpl] Protocols call for physically merging smaller droplets on hard surfaces, combining them into a single larger pool for easier removal with an eyedropper, or for gently pushing the spill into a disposable container. Vacuum cleaners and brooms cause greater dispersal of the mercury and should not be used. Afterwards, fine sulfur, zinc, or some other powder that readily forms an amalgam (alloy) with mercury at ordinary temperatures is sprinkled over the area before itself being collected and properly disposed of. Cleaning porous surfaces and clothing is not effective at removing all traces of mercury and it is therefore advised to discard these kinds of items should they be exposed to a mercury spill.
Mercury can be absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes and mercury vapors can be inhaled, so containers of mercury are securely sealed to avoid spills and evaporation. Heating of mercury, or of compounds of mercury that may decompose when heated, is always carried out with adequate ventilation in order to avoid exposure to mercury vapor. The most toxic forms of mercury are its organic compounds, such as dimethylmercury and methylmercury.  Mercury can cause both chronic and acute poisoning.

===Releases in the environment===

Preindustrial deposition rates of mercury from the atmosphere may be about 4 ng /(1 L of ice deposit). Although that can be considered a natural level of exposure, regional or global sources have significant effects. Volcanic eruptions can increase the atmospheric source by 4–6 times.[tpl]cite web|url=http://toxics.usgs.gov/pubs/FS-051-02/|title=Glacial Ice Cores Reveal A Record of Natural and Anthropogenic Atmospheric Mercury Deposition for the Last 270 Years|publisher=United States Geological Survey (USGS)|accessdate=May 1, 2007[/tpl]
Natural sources, such as volcanoes, are responsible for approximately half of atmospheric mercury emissions. The human-generated half can be divided into the following estimated percentages:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/mercury/|title=What is EPA doing about mercury air emissions?|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|accessdate=May 1, 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/176/ |title=Winged Mercury and the Golden Calf|author=Solnit, R.|date=September–October 2006|publisher=Orion Magazine|accessdate=2007-12-03[/tpl]
The above percentages are estimates of the global human-caused mercury emissions in 2000, excluding biomass burning, an important source in some regions.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Atmos Environ |year=2006 |volume=40 |issue=22 |page=4048|title= Global anthropogenic mercury emission inventory for 2000 |author= Pacyna E G, Pacyna J M, Steenhuisen F, Wilson S |doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2006.03.041|bibcode = 2006AtmEn..40.4048P [/tpl]
Recent atmospheric mercury contamination in outdoor urban air was measured at 0.01–0.02 µg/m3. A 2001 study measured mercury levels in 12 indoor sites chosen to represent a cross-section of building types, locations and ages in the New York area. This study found mercury concentrations significantly elevated over outdoor concentrations, at a range of 0.0065 – 0.523 μg/m3. The average was 0.069 μg/m3.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newmoa.org/prevention/mercury/MercuryIndoor.pdf|accessdate=2009-07-07|title=Indoor Air Mercury|date=May 2003|work=newmoa.org[/tpl]
Mercury also enters into the environment through the improper disposal (e.g., land filling, incineration) of certain products. Products containing mercury include: auto parts, batteries, fluorescent bulbs, medical products, thermometers, and thermostats.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/reduce/epr/products/mercury.htm|title=Mercury-containing Products|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|accessdate=May 1, 2007[/tpl] Due to health concerns (see below), toxics use reduction efforts are cutting back or eliminating mercury in such products. For example, the amount of mercury sold in thermostats in the United States decreased from 14.5 tons in 2004 to 3.9 tons in 2007.[ref]IMERC Fact Sheet – Mercury Use in Thermostats.
newmoa.org. January 2010[/ref] Most thermometers now use pigmented alcohol instead of mercury, and galinstan alloy thermometers are also an option. Mercury thermometers are still occasionally used in the medical field because they are more accurate than alcohol thermometers, though both are commonly being replaced by electronic thermometers and less commonly by galinstan thermometers. Mercury thermometers are still widely used for certain scientific applications because of their greater accuracy and working range.
Historically, one of the largest releases was from the Colex plant, a lithium-isotope separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The plant operated in the 1950s and 1960s. Records are incomplete and unclear, but government commissions have estimated that some two million pounds of mercury are unaccounted for.[tpl]cite web|publisher = United States Department of Energy|work = Y-12 Mercury Task Force Files: A Guide to Record Series of the Department of Energy and its Contractors|title = Introduction|url = http://www.hss.energy.gov/healthsafety/ohre/new/findingaids/epidemiologic/oakridge1/intro.html[/tpl]

===Occupational exposure===

Due to the health effects of mercury exposure, industrial and commercial uses are regulated in many countries. The World Health Organization, OSHA, and NIOSH all treat mercury as an occupational hazard, and have established specific occupational exposure limits. Environmental releases and disposal of mercury are regulated in the U.S. primarily by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
Case control studies have shown effects such as tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0.7–42 μg/m3.[tpl]cite journal|title=Chronic neurobehavioral effects of elemental mercury in dentists|pmid=1463679|journal=British Journal of Industrial Medicine|volume=49|issue=11| year=1992|author1=Ngim, CH|author2=Foo, SC|author3=Boey, K.W.|author4=Keyaratnam, J|pmc=1039326|pages=782–90|doi=10.1136/oem.49.11.782[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|title=Psychological effects of low exposure to mercury vapor: Application of computer-administered neurobehavioral evaluation system|journal=Environmental Research|volume=60| doi=10.1006/enrs.1993.1040|year=1993|pmid=8472661|last1=Liang|first1=YX|last2=Sun|first2=RK|last3=Sun|first3=Y|last4=Chen|first4=ZQ|last5=Li|first5=LH|issue=2|bibcode = 1993ER.....60..320L|pages=320–7[/tpl] A study has shown that acute exposure (4 – 8 hours) to calculated elemental mercury levels of 1.1 to 44 mg/m3 resulted in chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of interstitial pneumonitis.[tpl]cite journal|author=McFarland, RB and Reigel, H|journal=J.

With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms. Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids, lips, and tongue. Long-term, low-level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism, including fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams and depression.[tpl]cite book|publisher=World Health Organization|year=1991|title= Inorganic mercury.

===Treatment===

Research on the treatment of mercury poisoning is limited. Currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (NAP), British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury, patients were treated with DMSA and NAP.[tpl]cite journal|author=Bluhm, RE |journal=Hum Exp Toxicol |year=1992 |volume=11|issue=3|title=Elemental Mercury Vapour Toxicity, Treatment, and Prognosis After Acute, Intensive Exposure in Chloralkali Plant Workers.

===Fish===

Fish and shellfish have a natural tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often in the form of methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are fat soluble, they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue.[tpl]cite doi|10.1111/j.1095-8649.1973.tb04500.x[/tpl] When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.

==Regulations==

===International===

140 countries agreed in the Minamata Convention on Mercury by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to prevent emissions.
 Convention is expected to be open for signature in October 2013.http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43963&Cr=mercury&Cr1=#.UPt4ikfdP5M

===United States===

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is charged with regulating and managing mercury contamination. Several laws give the EPA this authority, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Additionally, the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act, passed in 1996, phases out the use of mercury in batteries, and provides for the efficient and cost-effective disposal of many types of used batteries.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/mercury/regs.htm|title=Mercury: Laws and regulations|date=2008-04-16|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=2008-05-30[/tpl] North America contributed approximately 11% of the total global anthropogenic mercury emissions in 1995.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ijc.org/php/publications/html/12br/english/report/chemical/rme.html |title=Reductions in Mercury Emissons|publisher=International Joint Commission on the Great Lakes[/tpl]
The United States Clean Air Act, passed in 1990, put mercury on a list of toxic pollutants that need to be controlled to the greatest possible extent. Thus, industries that release high concentrations of mercury into the environment agreed to install maximum achievable control technologies (MACT). In March 2005, the EPA promulgated a regulation[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/air/mercuryrule/|title=Clean Air Mercury Rule|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|accessdate=May 1, 2007[/tpl] that added power plants to the list of sources that should be controlled and instituted a national cap and trade system. States were given until November 2006 to impose stricter controls, but after a legal challenge from several states, the regulations were struck down by a federal appeals court on February 8, 2008. The rule was deemed not sufficient to protect the health of persons living near coal-fired power plants, given the negative effects documented in the EPA Study Report to Congress of 1998.[tpl]cite news|url=http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200802/05-1097a.pdf |title=State of New Jersey et al., Petitioners vs. Environmental Protection Agency (Case No. 05-1097)|publisher=United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

===European Union===

In the European Union, the directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (see RoHS) bans mercury from certain electrical and electronic products, and limits the amount of mercury in other products to less than 1000 ppm.[tpl]cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:037:0019:0023:EN:PDF |title=Directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment|date=2002/95/EC[/tpl] Article 4 Paragraph 1. e.g. "Member States shall ensure that, from July 1, 2006, new electrical and electronic equipment put on the market does not contain lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) or polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE)." There are restrictions for mercury concentration in packaging (the limit is 100 ppm for sum of mercury, lead, hexavalent chromium and cadmium) and batteries (the limit is 5 ppm).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eiatrack.org/s/1785|title=Mercury compounds in European Union: |year=2007|publisher=EIA Track|accessdate=2008-05-30[/tpl] In July 2007, the European Union also banned mercury in non-electrical measuring devices, such as thermometers and barometers.
