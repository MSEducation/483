Raymond Anthony "AJ" McCarron, Jr. (born September 13, 1990) is an American football quarterback. He played college football for the University of Alabama Crimson Tide. Following the  2013 BCS National Championship Game against Notre Dame, McCarron became the first quarterback to win back-to-back consensus national championships in the BCS era. McCarron is one of only seven quarterbacks in history to win back-to-back titles in some form and the first quarterback to win back-to-back consecutive titles since Nebraska's Tommie Frazier in 1994 and 1995.http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/6849394/oklahoma-2-time-national-champion-qb-jimmy-harris-dies In addition, since his freshman/redshirt year McCarron has been associated with three national title teams under coach Nick Saban: 2009, 2011, and 2012.
