Hazāra ([tpl]lang-fa|هزاره[/tpl]) are a Persian-speaking people who mainly live in central Afghanistan. They are overwhelmingly Twelver Shia Muslims and make up the third largest ethnic group in Afghanistan,L.

==Etymology==

Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire in the early 16th century, records the name Hazara in Baburnama. He referred to the populace of a region called Hazarajat, located west of the Kabulistan region, north of Ghazna and south-west of Ghor.Z. M. Babur, Babur-nama, Lahore, 1987. P.p 300, 207, 214, 218, 221, 251-53
The conventional theory is that word Hazara most likely derives from the Persian word for Thousand ([tpl]lang-fa|هزار[/tpl] - hazār). It may be the translation of the Mongol word ming (or minggan), a military unit of 1000 soldiers at the time of Gengis Khan.H. F. Schurmann, The Mon-gols of Afghanistan: An Ethnography of the Moghôls and Related Peoples of Afghanistan, La Haye, 1962, p. 115Hassan Poladi, The Hazâras, Stockton, 1989., p. 22S.A Mousavi, The Hazaras of Afghanistan:An Historical, Cultural, Economic and Political Study, Richmond, 1998., pp. 23-25 With time, the term Hazar could have been substituted for the Mongol word and now stands for the group of people.[tpl]cite web |work=Arash Khazeni, Alessandro Monsutti, Charles M.

==Origin theories==

The origins of the Hazara have not been fully reconstructed. Significant Inner Asian descent – in historical context Mongolian and Turkic - is impossible to rule out because the Hazara' physical attributes, facial bone structures and parts of their culture and language resemble those of Mongolians and Central Asian Turks. Thus, it is widely and popularly believed that Hazara have Mongolian ancestry. This is partially supported by genetic tests.[tpl]Cite journal| title = Genetics: Analysis of Genes and Genomes | first1 = Daniel L. | last1 = Hartl | first2 = Elizabeth W. | last2 = Jones | page = 308| postscript = [tpl]inconsistent citations[/tpl] [/tpl]
Some Hazara tribes are named after famous Mongol generals, for example the Tulai Khan Hazara who are named after Tolui, the youngest son of Genghis Khan. Some believe Hazara are descendants of Mongol soldiers and their Persian Shia wives who settled in Bamiyan following the 1221 siege of Bamiyan.  Theories of Mongol or partially Mongol descent are plausible, given that the Il-Khanate Mongol rulers, beginning with Oljeitu, embraced Shia Islam. Today, the majority of the Hazara adhere to Shia Islam, whereas Afghanistan's other major ethnic groups are mostly Sunni. However, the Sunni and Ismaili Hazara population, while existent, have not been extensively researched by scholars.
Another popular theory proposes that Hazara are descendants of the Kushans, the ancient dwellers of Afghanistan who are believed to have built the Buddhas of Bamiyan. Its proponents find the location of the Hazara homeland, and the similarity in facial features of Hazara with those on frescoes and Buddha's statues in Bamiyan, suggestive. However, this belief is contrary not only to the fact that the Kushans were Tocharians, but also to historical records which mention that in a particularly bloody battle around Bamiyan, Genghis Khan's grandson, Mutugen, was killed, and he allegedly ordered Bamiyan to be destroyed in retribution.Ratchnevsky, Paul (1991) Genghis Khan: His Life and Legacy Blackwell, Oxford, UK, p. 164, ISBN 0-631-18949-1
The theory accepted by most scholars, however, is that Hazara are a mixed group, consisting of native Iranian and Central Asian elements. For example, Nikudari Mongols settled in eastern Persia and mixed with native populations who spoke Persian. A second wave of mostly Chagatai Mongols came from Central Asia and were followed by other Mongolic groups, associated with the Ilkhanate and the Timurids, all of whom settled in Hazarajat and mixed with the local, mostly Persian-speaking population, forming a distinct group.

==History==

The first mention of Hazara are made by Babur in the early 16th century and later by the court historians of Shah Abbas of the Safavid dynasty. It is reported that they embraced Shia Islam between the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th century, during the Safavid period.[tpl]cite web |work=Alessandro Monsutti |date=December 15, 2003 |publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica |title=HAZĀRA: ii.

Hazara men along with tribes of other ethnic groups had been recruited and added to the army of Ahmad Shah Durrani in the 18th century.[tpl]cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0010) |title=Ahmad Shah and the Durrani Empire |accessdate=2010-08-25 |work= |publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies on Afghanistan |year=1997[/tpl] Some claim that in the mid‑18th century Hazara were forced out of Helmand and the Arghandab District of Kandahar Province. During the second reign of Dost Mohammad Khan's in the 19th century, Hazara from Hazarajat began to be taxed for the first time. However, for the most part they still managed to keep their regional autonomy until the subjugation of Abdur Rahman Khan began in the late 19th century.
When the Treaty of Gandomak was signed and the Second Anglo-Afghan War ended in 1880, Abdur Rahman Khan set out a goal to bring Hazarajat and Kafiristan under his control. He launched several campaigns in Hazarajat due to resistance from the Hazara in which his forces committed atrocities. The southern part of Hazarajat was spared as they accepted his rule, while the other parts of Hazarajat rejected Abdur Rahman and instead supported his uncle, Sher Ali Khan. In response to this Abdur Rahman waged a war against tribal leaders who rejected his policies and rule. Abdur Rahman arrested Syed Jafar, chief of the Sheikh Ali Hazara tribe, and jailed him in Mazar-e-Sharif.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl]

===First uprising===

The first Hazara uprising against Abdur Rahman Khan took place between 1888 and 1890. When Emir Abdur Rahman's cousin, Mohammad Eshaq, revolted against him, tribal leaders of the Sheikh Ali Hazaras joined the revolt. The revolt was short lived and crushed as the Emir extended his control over large parts of Hazarajat. Leaders of the Sheikh Ali Hazaras had allies in two different groups, Shia and Sunni. Abdur Rahman took advantage of the situation, pitting Sunni Hazara against the Shia Hazara, and made pacts among the Hazara.
After all of Sheikh Ali Hazaras' chiefs were sent to Kabul, opposition within the leadership of Sawar Khan and Syed Jafar Khan continued against the government troops, but at last were defeated. Taxes were imposed and Afghan administrators were sent to occupied places, where they subjugated the people with abuses. People were disarmed, villages were looted, local tribal chiefs were imprisoned or executed, and the better lands were confiscated and given to Afghan nomads (Kuchis).

===Second uprising===

The second uprising occurred in the Spring of 1892. According to Syed Askar Mousavi, the cause of the uprising was an assault on the wife of a Hazara Chieftain by Afghan soldiers.  The families of both the man and his wife, deciding that death was one hundred times better than such humiliation, killed the soldiers involved and attacked the local garrison, from whence they recovered their confiscated arms". Several other tribal chiefs who supported Abdur Rahman now turned against him and joined the rebellion which rapidly spread through the entire Hazarajat. In response to the rebellion, the Emir declared a "jihad" against the Shias and raised an army of up to 40, 000 soldiers, 10, 000 mounted troops, and 100,000 armed civilians (most of which were Pashtun nomads). He also brought in British military advisers to assist his army.[tpl]cite book |last= Mousavi|first= Sayed Askar|title= The Hazaras of Afghanistan: An Historical, Cultural, Economic and Political Study|origyear= 1997|year= 1998 |publisher= St. Martin's Press|location = Richmond, NY|isbn= 0-312-17386-5[/tpl]
The large army defeated the rebellion at its center, in Oruzgan, by 1892 and the local population was displaced with some being massacred.[tpl]quote|"thousands of Hazara men, women, and children were sold as slaves in the markets of Kabul and Qandahar, while numerous towers of human heads were made from the defeated rebels as a warning to others who might challenge the rule of the Amir".|S. A. Mousavi[/tpl]

====Third uprising====

The third uprising of Hazara was in response to the harsh repression, the Hazara revolted again by early 1893. This revolt took the government forces by surprise and the Hazara managed to take most of Hazarajat back. However, after months of fighting, they were eventually defeated due to a shortage of food. Small pockets of resistance continued to the end of the year as government troops committed atrocities against civilians and deported entire villages.
Abdur Rahman's subjugation of the Hazara due to fierce rebellion against the Afghan king gave birth to strong hatred between the Pahstun and Hazara for years to come. Massive forced displacements, especially in Oruzgan and Daychopan, continued as lands were confiscated and populations were expelled or fled. Some 35,000 families fled to northern Afghanistan, Mashhad (Iran) and Quetta (Pakistan). It is estimated that more than 60%[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] of the Hazara population were massacred or displaced during Abdur Rahman's campaign against them. Hazara farmers were often forced to give up their property to Pashtuns[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2012[/tpl] and as a result many Hazara families had to leave seasonally to the major cities in Afghanistan, Iran, or Pakistan in order to find jobs and a source of income. Quetta in Pakistan is home to the third largest settlements of Hazara outside Afghanistan.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2012[/tpl] In Pakistan, Hazaras have always enjoyed cordial relations with their Pashtun neighbors who gave them asylum, under the Pashtunwali code of nanawati (asylum).

===20th century===

In 1901 Habibullah Khan, Abdur Rahman's successor, granted amnesty to all people who were exiled by his predecessor. However, the division between the Afghan government and the Hazara people was already made too deep under Abdur Rahman. Hazara continued to face severe social, economic and political discrimination through most of the 20th century. In 1933 King Mohammed Nadir Khan was assassinated by Abdul Khaliq Hazara. The Afghan government captured and executed him later, along with several of his innocent[tpl]citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] family members.
Mistrust of the central government by the Hazaras and local uprisings continued. In particular, in the 1940s, during Zahir Shah's rule, a revolt took place against new taxes that were exclusively imposed on the Hazara. The Kuchi nomads meanwhile not only were exempted from taxes, but also received allowances from the Afghan government. The angry rebels began capturing and killing government officials. In response, the central government sent a force to subdue the region and later removed the taxes.
During the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the Hazarajat region did not see as much heavy fighting as other regions of Afghanistan. However, rival Hazara political factions fought. The division was between the Tanzáim-e nasl-e naw-e Hazara, a party based in Quetta, of Hazara nationalists and secular intellectuals, and the pro-Khomeini Islamist parties backed by the new Islamic Republic of Iran. By 1979, the Iran-backed Islamist groups liberated Hazarajat from the central Soviet-backed Afghan government and later took entire control of Hazarajat away from the secularists. By 1984, after severe fighting, the secularist groups lost all their power to the Islamists.
As the Soviets withdrew in 1989, the Islamist groups felt the need to broaden their political appeal and turned their focus to Hazara ethnic nationalism. This led to establishment of the Hezb-e Wahdat, an alliance of all the Hazara resistance groups (except the Harakat-e Islami). In 1992 with the fall of Kabul, the Harakat-e Islami took sides with Burhanuddin Rabbani's government while the Hezb-e Wahdat took sides with the opposition. The Hezb-e Wahdat was eventually forced out of Kabul in 1995 when the Taliban movement captured and killed their leader Abdul Ali Mazari. With the Taliban's capture of Kabul in 1996, all the Hazara groups united with the new Northern Alliance against the common new enemy. However, it was too late and despite the fierce resistance Hazarajat fell to the Taliban by 1998. The Taliban had Hazarajat totally isolated from the rest of the world going as far as not allowing the United Nations to deliver food to the provinces of Bamiyan, Ghor, Wardak, and Daykundi.[tpl]cite book |last= Rashid|first= Ahmed|authorlink= Ahmed Rashid|title=Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia |edition= Paperback|date=  March 1, 2001 |publisher=Yale University Press |location= New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0-300-08902-8[/tpl]
Though Hazara played a role in the anti-Soviet movement, other Hazara participated in the new communist government, which actively courted Afghan minorities. Sultan Ali Kishtmand, a Hazara, served as prime minister of Afghanistan from 1981-1990 (with one brief interruption in 1988).[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5i5WAAAAYAAJ&dq=Sultan+Ali+Kishtmand&q=sultan |title=Pg 33.

During the years that followed, Hazara suffered severe oppression and many ethnic massacres, genocides and pogroms were carried out by the predominantly ethnic Pashtun Taliban and are documented by such groups as the Human Rights Watch.[tpl]cite web |url =http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/afghanistan/ |title= Afghanistan: massacres of Hazaras |accessdate= December 27, 2007|author= Human Rights Watch|authorlink= Human Rights Watch|date=February 2001 |work= |publisher= hrw.org[/tpl] These human rights abuses not only occurred in Hazarajat, but across all districts controlled by the Taliban. Particularly after their capture of Mazar-e Sharif in 1998, where after a massive killing of some 8,000 civilians, the Taliban openly declared that the Hazara would be targeted.

===21st century===

Following the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, British and American forces invaded Afghanistan. Many Hazara have become leaders in today's newly emerging Afghanistan. Hazara have also pursued higher education, enrolled in the army, and many have top government positions.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0806/p06s02-wosc.html?page=2 |title=Afghanistan's success story: The liberated Hazara minority |accessdate= December 27, 2007|last=Sappenfield | first=Mark |date= August 6, 2007|publisher= The Christian Science Monitor[/tpl] For example, Mohammad Mohaqiq, a Hazara from the Hezb-e Wahdat party, was able to run in the 2004 presidential election in Afghanistan, and Karim Khalili became the Vice President of Afghanistan. A number of ministers and governors are Hazara, including Sima Samar, Habiba Sarabi, Ramazan Bashardost, Sarwar Danish, Sayed Hussein Anwari, Abdul Haq Shafaq, Sayed Anwar Rahmati, Qurban Ali Oruzgani and many others. The mayor of Nili in Daykundi Province is Azra Jafari, who became the first female mayor in Afghanistan. The National Assembly of Afghanistan (Parliament) is 25% made up of ethnic Hazara, which represents 61 members.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2011/01/22/many-karzai-rivals-find-way-parliament |title=Many Karzai rivals find way to Parliament |publisher=Pajhwok.com |date=2011-01-22 |accessdate=2012-07-30[/tpl]
Although Afghanistan has been historically one of the poorest countries in the world, the Hazarajat region has been kept even more poor from development by past governments. Since ousting the Taliban in late 2001, billions of dollars have poured into Afghanistan for reconstruction and several mega-scale reconstruction projects took place in Afghanistan from August 2012. For example, there have been more than 5000 kilometers of road pavement completed across Afghanistan, of which little was done in central Afghanistan Hazarajat. On the other hand, the Band-e Amir in the Bamyan Province became the first national park of Afghanistan. The road from Kabul to Bamyan was also built, along with new police stations, government institutions, hospitals, and schools in the Bamyan Province, Daykundi Province, and the others. The first ski resort of Afghanistan was also established in Bamyan Province.(27 Feb, 2012) Afghanistan set to host second national ski race wanderlust.co.ukLevinson, Charles (March 6, 2012) Since Skiing Came to Afghanistan, It Has Been Pretty Much All Downhill wsj.com
An indication of discrimination is that Kuchis (Afghan nomads who have historically been migrating from region to region depending on the season) are allowed to use Hazarajat pastures during the summer season. It is believed that allowing the Kuchis to use some of the grazing land in Hazarajat began during the rule of Abdur Rahman Khan.Afghan nomad clashes raise fears of ethnic strife[tpl]dead link|date=December 2013[/tpl] Living in mountainous Hazarajat, where little farm land exists, Hazara people rely on these pasture lands for their livelihood during the long and harsh winters. In 2007 some Kuchi nomads entered into parts of Hazarajat to graze their livestock, and when the local Hazara resisted, a clash took place and several people on both sides died using assault rifles. Such events continue to occur, even after the central government was forced to intervene, including President Hamid Karzai. In late July 2012, a Hazara police commander in Uruzgan province reportedly rounded up and killed 9 Pashtun civilians in revenge for the death of two local Hazara. The matter is being investigated by the Afghan government.
The recent drive by President Hamid Karzai after the Peace Jirga to strike a deal with Taliban leaders caused deep unease in Afghanistan's minority communities, who fought the Taliban the longest and suffered the most during their rule. The leaders of the Tajik, Uzbek and Hazara communities, which together make up close to half of the country's population, vowed to resist any return of the Taliban to power, referring to the large-scale massacres of Hazara civilians during the Taliban period."Afghan Overture to Taliban Aggravates Ethnic Tensions".  New York Times, 27 June 2010.

===Genetics===

Genetically, the Hazara are primarily eastern Eurasian with western Eurasian genetic mixtures.[tpl]cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/02/0214_030214_genghis_2.html |title=Genghis Khan a Prolific Lover, DNA Data Implies |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=February 14, 2003[/tpl][ref]
R1b1a1 (2011 name) is defined by the presence of SNP marker M73. It has been found at generally low frequencies throughout central Eurasia, but has been found with relatively high frequency among particular populations there including Pakistani Hazaras (8/25 = 32%).[tpl]Cite journal |title=Polarity and Temporality of High-Resolution Y-Chromosome Distributions in India Identify Both Indigenous and Exogenous Expansions and Reveal Minor Genetic Influence of Central Asian Pastoralists |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=202–21 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16400607 |pmc=1380230 |doi=10.1086/499411 |quote=8/176 R-M73 and 5/176 R-M269 for a total of 13/176 R1b in Pakistan and 4/728 R-M269 in India |last1=Sengupta |first1=S |last2=Zhivotovsky |last3=King |last4=Mehdi |last5=Edmonds |last6=Chow |last7=Lin |last8=Mitra |last9=Sil |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |first2=LA |first3=R |first4=SQ |first5=CA |first6=CE |first7=AA |first8=M |first9=SK|display-authors=9 [/tpl] However, the most frequent paternal Haplogroup type found amongst the Hazara's in the same study was haplogroup C-M217 at 40%(10/25) with Haplogroup O3 (Y-DNA) at 8% (2/25)[tpl]Cite journal|pmc=1380230 |title=Table 3: Complete Data Set of Y-Chromosomal HGs, Numbers of Repeats at 10 Microsatellite Loci, and Descriptions of Populations |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=2013-08-12 [/tpl] both which are Eastern Eurasian males ancestry associated with the Mongols and Kazakhs.

==Geographic distribution==

The vast majority of Hazaras live in central Afghanistan, and significant numbers are also found in major cities and towns. Many Hazara men leave Hazarjat to work in cities, including in neighboring countries or abroad. The latest World Factbook estimates show that Hazara make up nine percent of the total Afghan population but some sources claim that they are about 20 percent.[tpl]cite web |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/geopedia/Hazara_People |title=Hazara People |accessdate=2012-08-09 |last=Larson | first=Marisa |date= Jun 17, 2008|publisher= National Geographic[/tpl] However, they fail to cite a reference. In the 1970s, they were estimated by Louis Dupree at approximately 1,000,000.

===Diaspora===

Alessandro Monsutti argues, in his recent anthropological book,Monsutti, Alessandro (2005) War and migration: Social networks and economic strategies of the Hazaras of Afghanistan Routledge, New York, ISBN 0-415-97508-5 that migration is the traditional way of life of the Hazara people, referring to the seasonal and historical migrations which have never ceased and do not seem to be dictated only by emergency situations such as war.[tpl]cite book |last=Monsutti |first=Alessandro |title= War and migration: Social networks and economic strategies of the Hazaras of Afghanistan|edition= |series= |year= 2005|publisher= Routledge|location= Routledge, New York|language= English, translated by Patrick Camiller|isbn= 0-415-97508-5[/tpl] Due to the decades of war in Afghanistan and the sectarian violence in Pakistan, many Hazaras left their communities and have settled in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and particularly the Northern European countries such as Sweden and Denmark. Some go to these countries as exchanged students while others through human smuggling, which sometimes cost them their lives. Since 2001, about 1,000 people have died in the ocean while trying to reach Australia by boats from Indonesia.[tpl]cite web|last=Bigg |first=Matthew |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/25/us-pakistan-hazaras-idUSBRE89N1LP20121025 |title=Insight: Pakistani death squads spur desperate voyage to Australia |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=2013-12-08[/tpl] Many of these were Hazaras, including women and small children who could not swim.

New Zealand agreed to take some of the refugees and all but one of those were granted stay.

====Pakistani Hazaras====

During the British expansion in the 19th century, Hazaras worked during the winter months in coal mines, road construction and in other menial labor jobs in some cities of what is now Pakistan. The earliest record of Hazara in the areas of Pakistan is found in Broadfoot's Sappers company from 1835 in Quetta. This company had also participated in the First Anglo-Afghan War. Some Hazara also worked in the agriculture farms in Sindh and construction of Sukkur barrage. Haider Ali Karmal Jaghori was a prominent political thinker of the Hazara people in Pakistan, writing about the political history of Hazara people. His work Hazaraha wa Hazarajat Bastan Dar Aiyna-e-Tarikh was published in Quetta in 1992, and another work by Aziz Tughyan Hazara Tarikh Milli Hazara was published in 1984 in Quetta.
Most Pakistani Hazaras today live in the city of Quetta, in Balochistan, Pakistan. Localities in the city of Quetta with prominent Hazara populations include Hazara Town and Mehr Abad and Hazara tribes such as the Sardar are exclusively Pakistani. Literacy level among the Hazara community in Pakistan is relatively high compare to the Hazaras of Afghanistan, and they have integrated well into the social dynamics of the local society. Saira Batool, a Hazara woman, was one of the first female pilots in Pakistan Air Force. Other notable Hazara include Qazi Mohammad Esa, General Muhammad Musa, who served as Commander in Chief of the Pakistani Army from 1958 to 1968, Air Marshal Sharbat Ali Changezi, Hussain Ali Yousafi, the slain chairman of the Hazara Democratic Party,"Hussain Ali Yousafi, chairman of the Hazara Democratic Party'" BBC News, 26 January 2009 Syed Nasir Ali Shah, MNA from Quetta and his father Haji Syed Hussain Hazara who was a senator and member of majlis shora during the Zia-ul-Haq era.

Despite all of this, Hazaras are often targeted by militant groups such as the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and others. "Activists say at least 800-1,000 Hazaras have been killed since 1999 and the pace is quickening. More than one hundred have been murdered in and around Quetta since January, according to Human Rights Watch." The political representation of the community is served by Hazara Democratic Party, a secular liberal democratic party, headed by Abdul Khaliq Hazara.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/provinces/balochistans-hazaras-speak-out--qs |title=Balochistan's Hazaras speak out — Qurat ul ain Siddiqui interviews Secretary-General of the Hazara Democratic Party, Abdul Khaliq Hazara |publisher=Dawn.com |accessdate=2012-07-30[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hazarapress.com/political_parties/index.htm |title=List of Political parties |publisher=Hazarapress.com |accessdate=2012-07-30[/tpl]

====Hazara in Iran====

Over the many years as a result of political unrest in Afghanistan some Hazaras have migrated to Iran. They have complained of discrimination in Iran. In March 2011, Eurasia Daily Monitor reported that representatives of Hazara community in Iran have asked Mongolia to intervene in supporting their case with Iranian government and prevent Iranian forced repatriation to Afghanistan.[tpl]cite web|last=McDermott |first=Roger |url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=37639&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=27&cHash=d5e6dfde98d5e080064d1385eef3103d |title=For the last 20 years Hazara elements have appealed for Mongolian sanctuary and support to prevent Iranian forced repatriation to Afghanistan |publisher=Jamestown.org |accessdate=2012-07-30[/tpl]

==Culture==

The Hazara, outside of Hazarajat, have adopted the cultures of the cities where they dwell, and in many cases are quite Persianized. Traditionally the Hazara are highland farmers and although sedentary like the Tajiks, in the Hazarajat, they have retained many of their own customs and traditions, some of which are more closely related to those of Central Asia than to Iran.Jochelson, Waldemar (1928) Peoples of Asiatic Russia American Museum of Natural History, New York, p. 33, OCLC 187466893, also available in microfiche editionSchurmann, Franz (1962) The Mongols of Afghanistan: An Ethnography of the Moghôls and Related Peoples of Afghanistan Mouton, The Hague, Netherlands,  OCLC 401634Mousavi, Sayed Askar (1991) The Hazaras of Afghanistan: An Historical, Cultural, Economic, and Political Study, Oxford University Press, Oxford, England, ISBN 0-312-17386-5 For instance, many Hazara musicians are widely hailed as being skilled in playing the dambura, a regional and native instrument, a lute instrument similarly found in other Central Asian nations such as Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.The Hazara live in houses rather than tents; Aimaq people in tents rather than houses.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.mn/books?id=WLo0AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA333&lpg=PA333&dq=the+Hazara+live+in+houses+rather+than+tents+;+the+Aimak+in+tents+rather+than+houses&source=bl&ots=EQZIwKB2G9&sig=MAFw2uZJQKDI1aEvAnX56LegAIc&hl=mn&sa=X&ei=EmGrUa2GJ4mbiQKf2YDgAQ&ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=the%20Hazara%20live%20in%20houses%20rather%20than%20tents%20%3B%20the%20Aimak%20in%20tents%20rather%20than%20houses&f=false |title=Eastern and northern Asia Europe |publisher=Books.google.mn |accessdate=2013-12-08[/tpl]

Many of the urban Hazara in the larger cities such as Kabul and Mazari Sharif no longer speak Hazaragi but speak standard literary Persian (usually the Kābolī dialect) or regional varieties of Persian (for example the Khorāsānī dialect in the western region of Herat).
Until recently, a very small number of Hazara near Herat still spoke the Moghol language, a Mongolic language once spoken by rebels against the Mongol armies of the Il-Khanat.Michael Weiers. 2003.

==Religion==

Hazara are predominantly Shi'a Muslims, mostly of the Twelver sect1911 Encyclopædia Britannica - Hazara (Race) and some Ismaili.The Afghans, Their History and Culture, Religion Since the majority of Afghans practice Sunni Islam, this probably contributed to the discrimination against the Hazara. Hazara probably converted Shi'ism  during the first part of the 16th century, in the early days of the Safavid Dynasty.[tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=3DOuOSYR4PcC&pg=PA44&dq=safavid+persia+conversion&cd=197#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Revolution unending: Afghanistan, 1979 to the present, By Gilles Dorronsoro, pg.44 |publisher=Books.google.com.au |accessdate=2012-07-30|isbn=9781850657033 |year=2005 [/tpl] Nonetheless, a small number of Hazara are Sunni, such as the Aimaq Hazaras. Sunni Hazara have been attached to non-Hazara tribes (such as Taimuris), while the Ismaili Hazara have always been kept separate from the rest of the Hazara on account of religious beliefs and political purposes.

==Hazara tribes==

The Hazara people have been organized by various tribes. The Daizangi are the largest tribe, representing 57.2% of the Hazara population.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=15 March 2010|date=April 2010[/tpl] However, more recently and since the inclusion of the Hazara into the "Afghan state", tribal affiliations have been disappearing and former tribal names Sheikh Ali, Jaghori, Ghaznichi, Behsud, Uruzgani, and Daizangi are also disappearing. The different Hazara tribes come from  regions such as Parwan, Bamyan, and Ghazni.

==Sports==

Many Hazara are engaged in different sports. Rohullah Nikpai won a bronze medal in taekwondo in the Beijing Olympics 2008, beating world champion Juan Antonio Ramos of Spain 4–1 in a play-off final. It was Afghanistan's first-ever Olympic medal. He then won a second olympic medal for Afghanistan in the London 2012 games. Afghanistan's first female Olympic athlete Friba Razayee competed in judo at the 2004 Athens Olympics, but was eliminated in the first round of competition.
Other famous Hazara athletes are Syed Abdul Jalil Waiz (Badminton) and Ali Hazara (Football). Syed Abdul Jalil Waiz was the first ever badminton player representing Afghanistan in Asian Junior Championships in 2005 where he produced the first win for his country against Iraq, with 15–13, 15–1. He participated in several international championships since 2005 and achieved victories against Australia, Philippines and Mongolia. Hamid Rahimi is a new boxer from Afghanistan and lives in Germany.
A Pakistani Hazara named Syed Abrar Hussain Shah, a former Olympic boxer served as deputy director general of the Pakistan Sports Board. Shah represented Pakistan three times at the Olympics and won a gold medal at the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing. Some Hazara from Pakistan have also excelled in sports and have received numerous awards particularly in boxing, football and in field hockey. Qayum Changezi, a legendary Pakistani football player, was a Hazara.
