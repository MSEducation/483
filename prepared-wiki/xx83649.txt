Vincent Patrick Bryan (June 22, 1878 â€“ April 27, 1937) was an American composer and lyricist.
In the 1903-1909 production of The Wizard of Oz he was called upon to introduce new songs in numerous revisions.
He was a close behind-the-scenes collaborator of Charlie Chaplin from 1915 to 1917.  Along with Hal Roach he directed three Harold Lloyd films in 1919: He Leads, Others Follow, Soft Money and Pay Your Dues.  An addiction to heroin prematurely ended his promising career in motion pictures.
He was born in St. John's, Newfoundland and died in Los Angeles, California.
