The Britten Sheriff was a light twin-engine aircraft developed in the United Kingdom in the 1970s.

==Development==

Aircraft engineer John Britten, who had been instrumental in founding Britten-Norman, left the company in February 1976.Britten-Norman History  After that, he began development of an economical four-place light twin aircraft, the Sheriff.  It was a low-wing cantilever monoplane with twin tails and a tractor engine in a nacelle on each wing.  Of all-metal construction (with a fiberglass nose section on the fuselage), it was fitted with fixed tricycle undercarriage and accommodated the pilot and three passengers under a bubble canopy.
Britten planned two versions of the aircraft, a two-place trainer and a four-place touring aircraft.  Target price of the trainer was ₤25,000 and of the touring version was ₤29,000.  By comparison, at that time the price of the Piper Seneca was around £58,000, so Britten's plan was daring.
Britten died in 1977, and work on the prototype aircraft, partly completed, came to a halt.  The prototype (registered G-FRJB) was never completed, and in 1986, was acquired by East Midlands Aeropark at East Midlands Airport.
