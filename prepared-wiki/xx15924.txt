Silver and brass cigar travel cases are also available as well as wood cigar cases. The latter can range from affordable cases to handcrafted ones, while the former tend to be quite expensive.

===Cigar tubes===

Cigar tubes are used to carry small numbers of cigars, typically one or five. The latter tube would be called 5-finger tube and the former 1-finger tube. They are usually made from stainless steel. Cigar tubes are normally used when one is out for a few hours, but if it is necessary to spend longer periods of time out, there are tubes that come with a built in humidifier and hygrometer.

===Cigar holders===

Cigar holders are also known as cigar stands and are used to keep the cigars out of ashtrays. Also, cigar holders may refer to a tube in which the cigar is held while smoked. These are mostly used by women, and rarely by men.

==Health effects==

Like other forms of tobacco use, cigar smoking poses a significant health risk depending on dosage: risks are greater for those who inhale more when they smoke, smoke more cigars, or smoke them longer.  The risk of dying from any cause is statistically greater for cigar smokers than for people who have never smoked, with the risk higher for smokers less than 65 years old, and with risk for moderate and deep inhalers reaching levels similar to cigarette smokers. For those who do not inhale and smoke 1–2 cigars per day, the risk of dying from all causes is still statistically significant when compared to non-smokers and similar compared to heavy cigar smokers. Cigar smoking can easily lead to addiction and cigarette usage.[tpl]cite book |title= Cigars: Health Effects and Trends |editor= Shopland DR, Burns DM, Hoffman D, Cummings KM, Amacher RH (eds.) |author= Shanks TG, Burns DM |chapter= Disease consequences of cigar smoking |chapterurl=http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/tcrb/monographs/9/m9_4.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-10-21 |publisher= National Cancer Institute |series= Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9 |year=1998 |pages=105–160[/tpl][tpl]cite book |title= Cigars: Health Effects and Trends |editor= Shopland DR, Burns DM, Hoffman D, Cummings KM, Amacher RH (eds.) |author= Burns DM |chapter= Cigar smoking: overview and current state of the science |chapterurl=http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/tcrb/monographs/9/m9_1.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-02-23 |publisher= National Cancer Institute |series= Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9 |year=1998 |page=8[/tpl] For those who inhale or smoke several cigars a day, types of health risk can be similar to those associated with cigarette smoking: nicotine addiction, periodontal disease, tooth loss, and many types of cancer, including cancers of the mouth, throat, and esophagus.[tpl]cite book |title= Cigars: Health Effects and Trends |editor= Shopland DR, Burns DM, Hoffman D, Cummings KM, Amacher RH (eds.) |author= Burns DM |chapter= Cigar smoking: overview and current state of the science |chapterurl=http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/tcrb/monographs/9/m9_1.PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-12-02 |publisher= National Cancer Institute |series= Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph No. 9 |year=1998 |pages=1–20[/tpl] Cigar smoking can also cause cancers of the lung and larynx.

==Popularity==

The prevalence of cigar smoking varies depending on location, historical period, and population surveyed, and prevalence estimates vary somewhat depending on the survey method. The U.S. is the top consuming country by far, followed by Germany and the UK; the U.S. and western Europe account for about 75% of cigar sales worldwide.[tpl]cite journal |ssrn=1127582 |author= Rarick CA |title= Note on the premium cigar industry |date=2008-04-02 |publisher=SSRN [/tpl] The 2005 U.S. National Health Interview Survey estimated that 2.2% of adults smoke cigars, about the same as smokeless tobacco but far less than the 21% of adults who smoke cigarettes; it also estimated that 4.3% of men but only 0.3% of women smoke cigars.[tpl]cite journal |journal= MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep |year=2006 |volume=55 |issue=42 |pages=1145–8 |title= Tobacco use among adults—United States, 2005 |author= Mariolis P, Rock VJ, Asman K et al. |url=http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5542a1.htm |pmid= 17065979[/tpl] The 2002 U.S. National Survey of Drug Use and Health found that adults with serious psychological distress are significantly more likely to smoke cigars than those without.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Addict Behav |year=2008 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=582–92 |title= Tobacco use among those with serious psychological distress: results from the national survey of drug use and health, 2002 |author= Hagman BT, Delnevo CD, Hrywna M, Williams JM |doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2007.11.007 |pmid=18158218 |pmc= 2696205[/tpl] A 2007 California study found that gay men and bisexual women smoke significantly fewer cigars than the general population of men and women, respectively.[tpl]cite journal |journal=Nicotine Tob Res |year=2007 |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages=937–40 |title= Cigar and smokeless tobacco use in the lesbian, gay, and bisexual population |author= Gruskin EP, Greenwood GL, Matevia M, Pollack LM, Bye LL, Albright V |doi=10.1080/14622200701488426 |pmid=17763109[/tpl] Substantial and steady increases in cigar smoking were observed during the 1990s and early 2000s in the U.S. among both adults and adolescents.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Public Health Rep |year=2006 |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=116–9 |title= Smokers' choice: what explains the steady growth of cigar use in the U.S.? |author= Delnevo CD |pmid=16528942 |url=http://www.publichealthreports.org/userfiles/121_2/121116.pdf |format=PDF |pmc= 1525261[/tpl] Data suggest that cigar usage among young adult males increased threefold during the 1990s, a 1999–2000 survey of 31,107 young adult U.S. military recruits found that 12.3% smoked cigars,[tpl]cite journal |journal= Addict Behav |year=2008 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=69–82 |title= Prevalence of alternative forms of tobacco use in a population of young adult military recruits |author= Vander Weg MW, Peterson AL, Ebbert JO, Debon M, Klesges RC, Haddock CK |doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2007.07.005 |pmid=17706889 |pmc=2101765[/tpl] and a 2003–2004 survey of 4,486 high school students in a Midwestern county found that 18% smoked cigars.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Am J Health Behav |year=2008 |volume=32 |issue=6 |pages=640–9 |title= Cigars, cigarettes, and adolescents |author= Brooks A, Gaier Larkin EM, Kishore S, Frank S |pmid=18442343 |url=http://png.publisher.ingentaconnect.com/content/png/ajhb/2008/00000032/00000006/art00008 |doi= 10.5555/ajhb.2008.32.6.640[/tpl]

==Cuban cigars==

Cuban cigars are rolled from tobacco leaves found throughout the country of Cuba. The filler, binder, and wrapper may come from different portions of the island. All cigar production in Cuba is controlled by the Cuban government, and each brand may be rolled in several different factories in Cuba. Cuban cigar rollers or "torcedores" are claimed by cigar experts to be the most skilled rollers in the world.[tpl]Citation needed|date=March 2009[/tpl] Torcedores are highly respected in Cuban society and culture and travel worldwide displaying their art of hand rolling cigars.[tpl]cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AC&p_theme=ac&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F338C43ACDEC4B0&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=CUBAN GOLD GETS ROLLED IN VINELAND / STORE OFFERS CIGARS ROLLED BY CUBAN HANDS|last=RIVERA |first= Maricarmen|date=2002-04-29 |publisher=The Press of Atlantic City|accessdate=2009-03-08[/tpl]
Habanos SA and Cubatabaco between them do all the work relating to Cuban cigars, including manufacture, quality control, promotion and distribution, and export. Cuba produces both handmade and machine made cigars. All boxes and labels are marked Hecho en Cuba (Spanish for made in Cuba). Machine-bunched cigars finished by hand add Hecho a mano, while fully handmade cigars say Totalmente a mano in script text, though not all Cuban cigars will include this statement. Because of the perceived status of Cuban cigars, counterfeits are somewhat commonplace.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.decaturspirits.com/cigars/fakecubans/ |title=Identifying Counterfeit Cuban Cigars |publisher=Decaturspirits.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25[/tpl]
Despite American trade sanctions against Cuban products, cigars remain one of the country's leading exports. The country exported 77 million cigars in 1991, 67 million in 1992, and 57 million in 1993, the decline attributed to a loss of much of the wrapper crop in a hurricane.Marvin R. Shanken, "Inside Cuban Cigars: Cigar Aficionado Interviews Cubatabaco's Top Official, Francisco Padron", Cigar Aficionado'', vol. 2, no. 3 (Spring 1994), pp. 75-83.

===United States embargo against Cuba===

On February 7, 1962, United States President John F. Kennedy imposed a trade embargo on Cuba to sanction Fidel Castro's communist government. According to Pierre Salinger, then Kennedy's press secretary, the president ordered him on the evening of February 6 to obtain 1,200 H. Upmann brand petit corona Cuban cigars; upon Salinger's arrival with the cigars the following morning, Kennedy signed the executive order which put the embargo into effect.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Archives/CA_Show_Article/0,2322,862,00.html |title=Kennedy, Cuba and Cigars |publisher=Cigar Aficionado |date=1992-09-01 |accessdate=2010-10-25[/tpl] Richard Goodwin, a White House assistant to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, revealed in a 2000 New York Times article that in early 1962 JFK told him, "We tried to exempt cigars, but the cigar manufacturers in Tampa objected."[tpl]cite news |title= President Kennedy's plan for peace with Cuba |author= Goodwin R |work= New York Times |date=2000-07-05 |accessdate=2008-09-20 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DEFDB1039F936A35754C0A9669C8B63[/tpl]
The embargo prohibited US residents from legally purchasing Cuban cigars and American cigar manufacturers from importing Cuban tobacco. As a result, Cuba was deprived of its major customer for tobacco and American cigar manufacturers either had to find an alternative source of tobacco or go out of business."Florida Cigars: Artistry, Labor, and Politics in Florida's Oldest Industry" - Archives of the State of Florida
In the United States, authentic Cuban-made cigars are seen as "forbidden fruit" for Americans to purchase.[tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2011[/tpl] Upon the expropriation of private property in Cuba, many former Cuban cigar manufacturers moved to other countries (primarily the Dominican Republic) to continue production. The Dominican Republic's production of tobacco grew significantly as a result. After reallocation, most Cuban manufacturers continued to use their known company name, seed, and harvesting technique while Cubatabaco, Cuba's state tobacco monopoly after the Revolution, independently continued production of cigars using the former private company names. As a result, cigar name brands like Romeo y Julieta, La Gloria Cubana, Montecristo and H. Upmann among others, exist in both Cuba and the Dominican Republic. Honduras and Nicaragua are also mass manufacturers of cigars. Some Cuban refugees make cigars in the U.S. and advertise them as "Cuban" cigars, using the argument that the cigars are made by Cubans.[tpl]cite news |url=http://travel.latimes.com/articles/la-trw-vegas3jun03 |work= Los Angeles Times |date=2007-05-30 |accessdate=2008-09-11 |title= Las Vegas cigar lounges roll out the welcome mat |author= Gould LE[/tpl]
It remains illegal for US residents to purchase or import Cuban cigars regardless of where they are in the world,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Documents/ccigar2.pdf |title=Office of Foreign Assets Control: "Cuban Cigar Update" |format=PDF |date=2004-09-30 |accessdate=2011-10-15[/tpl] although they are readily available across the northern border in Canada and the southern border in Mexico. While Cuban cigars are smuggled into the USA and sold at high prices, counterfeiting is rife; it has been said that 95% of Cuban cigars sold in the USA are counterfeit. Although Cuban cigars cannot legally be imported into the USA, the advent of the Internet has made it much easier for people in the United States to purchase cigars online from other countries, especially when shipped without bands. Cuban cigars are openly advertised in some European tourist regions, catering to the American market, even though it is illegal to advertise tobacco in most European regions.

===Cigars specific to other countries===

Italy produces the Sigaro Toscano (Toscano cigar), a dry "cheroot style" cigar, very different from the moist Havana style. Founded in 1818, Toscano cigar is one of the oldest cigar brands in the world - rich in history, tradition and heritage. It is made of high quality fermented Kentucky tobacco traditionally grown in Italy. Today, the Toscano brand cigars are manufactured by Manifatture Sigaro Toscano SpA located in Lucca and Cava de' Tirreni.Manifatture Sigaro Toscano: Manufacturing
Toscano-style cigars are also manufactured in the United States by The Avanti Cigar Co. of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Their brands include Bon Gusto, De Nobili, Parodi, Petri, Toscanelli, and the anisette-flavored Avanti.http://avanticigar.com.

==In popular culture==

In the 1980s and 1990s, major U.S. print media portrayed cigars favorably; they generally framed cigar use as a lucrative business or a trendy habit, rather than as a health risk.[tpl]cite journal |journal= Am J Public Health |year=2001 |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=288–91 |title= The cigar revival and the popular press: a content analysis, 1987–1997 |author= Wenger L, Malone R, Bero L |pmid=11211641 |pmc=1446522 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.91.2.288[/tpl] Rich people are often caricatured as wearing top hats and tails and smoking cigars. Cigars are often smoked to celebrate special occasions: the birth of a child, a graduation, a big sale. The expression "close but no cigar" comes from the practice of giving cigars as prizes in games involving good aim at fairgrounds.
