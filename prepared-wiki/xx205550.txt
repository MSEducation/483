KTLB (105.9 FM) is a radio station that broadcasts from Fort Dodge, Iowa (licensed to Twin Lakes, Iowa). The station broadcasts a classic hits music format as "Hippie Radio 105.9". The station is owned by Three Eagles Communications.
Previously, this station was known as 105.9 The Beach, broadcasting an oldies format. Then sometime in late 2012, it has jettisoned the oldies playlist for Christmas music. As of December 26, KTLB switched their stunt to various versions of Iron Butterfly's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida; the following day, the stunt switched to a loop of David Bowie's "Changes". On January 1, 2013 KTLB launched a classic hits format branded as "Hippie Radio 105.9".http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/80282/three-eagles-flips-pair-to-classic-hits/[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.yourmidwestmedia.net/mainsite/formatchanges.html|title=Format Changes|publisher=Your Midwest Media|date=1 January 2013[/tpl]
