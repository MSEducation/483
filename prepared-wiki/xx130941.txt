[[Benzylamine]]

CATEGORIES: Amines, Aromatic compounds

Benzylamine is the chemical compound with the formula C6H5CH2NH2.  It consists of a benzyl group, C6H5CH2, attached to an amine functional group.  This colorless liquid is a common precursor in organic synthesis.

==Manufacturing==

Benzylamine can be produced through a number of ways: from the reaction of benzyl chloride and ammonia; by the reduction of benzonitrile; from the reaction between benzyl bromide and acetamide; from the reaction between N-benzylphthalimide and hydrazine hydrate.

==Uses==

It is used as a masked source of ammonia, since after N-alkylation, the benzyl group can be removed by hydrogenolysis:[tpl]OrgSynth | author = Gatto, V. J.; Miller, S. R.; Gokel, G.

Typically a base is employed in the first step to absorb the HBr (or related acid for other kinds of alkylating agents).
