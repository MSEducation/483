Robert John Downey, Jr. (born April 4, 1965)[tpl]cite web|title=Robert Downey Jr. Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/robert-downey-jr-9542052#awesm=~oCxqtKtfHvhoGj|publisher=The Biography Channel|accessdate=April 26, 2014[/tpl] is an American actor who made his screen debut at the age of five, appearing in his father Robert Downey, Sr.'s film Pound. He has appeared in roles associated with the Brat Pack, such as Less Than Zero and Weird Science. Other films he has starred in include Air America, Soapdish, and Natural Born Killers. He starred as Charlie Chaplin, the title character in the 1992 film Chaplin, which earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.
After being released in 2000 from the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison where he was on drug charges, Downey joined the cast of the TV series Ally McBeal playing Calista Flockhart's love interest. His performance was praised and he received a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film. His character was written out when Downey was fired after two drug arrests in late 2000 and early 2001. After one last stay in a court-ordered drug treatment program, Downey finally achieved sobriety.
His more recent films include The Singing Detective, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, A Scanner Darkly, Gothika, Zodiac and Tropic Thunder, for which he was nominated an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. In 2008, Downey played the role of Marvel superhero Tony Stark / Iron Man in the live action film Iron Man, a role he reprised in Iron Man 2, Marvel's The Avengers, and Iron Man 3; he also made a cameo appearance as the character in The Incredible Hulk. He will again reprise his role in the upcoming films, Avengers: Age of Ultron and another Avengers sequel. In 2009, he played the title character in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes and again in 2011's Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.
Downey has starred in six movies that have each grossed over $500 million at the box office worldwide. Two of those films, The Avengers and Iron Man 3, each earned over $1 billion. Downey tops the Forbes list of Hollywood's highest-paid actors with an estimated $75 million in earnings between June 2012 and June 2013.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2013/07/16/robert-downey-jr-tops-forbes-list-of-hollywoods-highest-paid-actors/?utm_campaign=forbestwittersf&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social |title=Robert Downey Jr. Tops Forbes' List Of Hollywood's Highest-Paid Actors |publisher=Forbes |date=2013-07-16 |accessdate=2013-08-01[/tpl]

As a child, Downey was "surrounded by drugs". His father, a drug addict, allowed Downey to use marijuana at aged six, an incident which his father has said he now regrets. Downey stated that drug use became an emotional bond between him and his father: "When my dad and I would do drugs together, it was like him trying to express his love for me in the only way he knew how." Eventually, Downey began spending every night abusing alcohol and "making a thousand phone calls in pursuit of drugs".

During his childhood Downey had minor roles in his father's films. He made his acting debut at the age of five, playing a sick puppy in the absurdist comedy Pound (1970), and then at aged seven appeared in the surrealist Greaser's Palace (1972). At the age of ten, he was living in England and studied classical ballet as part of a larger curriculum.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/story/downey-jr-was-a-ballet-student |title=ROBERT DOWNEY JR – DOWNEY JR WAS A BALLET STUDENT | publisher=Contactmusic |accessdate=January 1, 2010 |date=May 22, 2005[/tpl] He attended the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in upstate New York as a teenager. When his parents divorced in 1978, Downey moved to California with his father, but in 1982 he dropped out of Santa Monica High School and moved back to New York to pursue an acting career full-time.[tpl]cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0208/17/pitn.00.html | title = CNN People In The News – Profile of Robert Downey Jr.| publisher=CNN |accessdate=May 2, 2008 | date = August 17, 2002[/tpl]

==Career==

===Beginnings and critical acclaim===

Downey began building upon theater roles, including in the short-lived off-Broadway musical "American Passion" at the Joyce Theater in 1983, produced by Norman Lear. In 1985, he was part of the new, younger cast hired for Saturday Night Live, but following a year of poor ratings and criticism of the new cast's comedic talents, he and most of the new crew were replaced. That same year, Downey had a dramatic acting breakthrough when he played James Spader's sidekick in Tuff Turf and then a bully in John Hughes' Weird Science. He was considered for the role of Duckie in John Hughes' film Pretty in Pink (1986),[tpl]cite web |url=http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id299.htm |title=13.

Because of these and other coming-of-age films Downey did during the 1980s, he is sometimes named as a member of the Brat Pack.[tpl]cite news | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002575504_downey23.html | title = Downey riding high on the comeback trail | publisher=The Seattle Times |author=Germain, David |accessdate=May 2, 2008 | date = October 23, 2005[/tpl]
In 1987, Downey played Julian Wells, a drug-addicted rich boy whose life rapidly spirals out of his control, in the film version of the Bret Easton Ellis novel Less Than Zero. His performance, described by Janet Maslin in The New York Times as "desperately moving",[tpl]cite news | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DA1239F935A35752C1A961948260&sec=&spon= | title = Film: 'Less Than Zero,' Young Lives |work=The New York Times |author=Maslin, Janet |accessdate=May 2, 2008 | date = November 6, 1987 | authorlink = Janet Maslin[/tpl] was widely praised, though Downey has said that for him "the role was like the ghost of Christmas Future" since his drug habit resulted in his becoming an "exaggeration of the character" in real life.[tpl]cite news | url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,1080388,00.html | title = More than skin deep |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = November 8, 2003 | first = Jon | last = Wilde | accessdate =May 2, 2008 [/tpl] Zero drove Downey into films with bigger budgets and names, such as Chances Are (1989) with Cybill Shepherd and Ryan O'Neal, Air America (1990) with Mel Gibson, and Soapdish (1991) with Sally Field, Kevin Kline and Whoopi Goldberg.
In 1992, he starred as Charlie Chaplin in Chaplin, a role for which he prepared extensively, learning how to play the violin and tennis left-handed. He even had a personal coach in order to imitate Chaplin's posture and way of carrying himself.[tpl]cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3D91E3EF932A25757C0A965958260 | title = FILM; Once Again The Clowning Gets Physical |work=The New York Times |author=Hornaday, Anne |accessdate=August 1, 2008 | date = April 11, 1993[/tpl] The role garnered Downey an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor at the Academy Awards 65th ceremony, losing to Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/blogs/traverstake/2008/03/the-strange-case-of-iron-man-r.php | title = The Strange Case of Iron Man Robert Downey Jr. |work=Rolling Stone |author=Travers, Peter |accessdate=August 1, 2008 | date = March 13, 2008[/tpl] His other films in the 1990s included Heart and Souls, Only You, Natural Born Killers, Restoration, Two Girls and a Guy, Black and White, Short Cuts, Richard III, and The Last Party, a documentary written by Downey.

===Career troubles (1996–2001)===

From 1996 through 2001, Downey was arrested numerous times on drug-related charges including cocaine, heroin and marijuana[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,98373,00.html | title = Will Robert Downey Jr.'s Case Spark a Change in Drug Sentencing? |work=Time |author=Reaves, Jessica |accessdate=May 1, 2008 | date = February 7, 2001[/tpl] and went several times through drug treatment programs unsuccessfully, explaining in 1999 to a judge: "It's like I've got a shotgun in my mouth with my finger on the trigger, and I like the taste of the gun metal."[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/413283.stm | title = Addicted Downey Jnr jailed |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=May 1, 2008 | date = August 6, 1999[/tpl] He explained his relapses by claiming to have been addicted to drugs since the age of eight, due to the fact that his father, also an addict, had been giving them to him.
In April 1996, Downey was arrested for possession of heroin, cocaine and an unloaded .357 Magnum handgun while he was speeding down Sunset Boulevard. A month later, while on parole, he trespassed into a neighbor's home while under the influence of a controlled substance and fell asleep in one of the beds.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/movies/20carr.html?_r=1&ref=movies&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin | title = Been Up, Been Down.

In 1997, he missed one of the court-ordered drug tests and had to spend four months in the Los Angeles County jail.
After Downey missed another required drug test in 1999, he was arrested once more. Despite Downey's lawyer, John Stewart Holden, assembling for his client's 1999 defense the same team of lawyers that successfully defended O.J. Simpson during his criminal trial for murder, Downey was sentenced to a three-year prison term at the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in Corcoran, California (a.k.a. "Corcoran II"). At the time of the 1999 arrest, all of Downey's film projects had wrapped and were close to release, with the exception of In Dreams, which he was allowed to complete filming. He had also been hired for voicing "The Devil" on the NBC animated television series God, the Devil and Bob, but was fired when he failed to show up for rehearsals.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117750121.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title = Downey gets 3-year prison term for parole violations | publisher=Variety |author=Ault, Susanne |accessdate=August 8, 2008 | date = August 6, 1999[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/375887.stm | title = Downey Jr back in jail |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=August 8, 2008 | date = July 23, 1999[/tpl]
After spending nearly a year in California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in Corcoran, California, Downey, on condition of posting $5,000 bail, was unexpectedly freed when a judge ruled that his collective time in incarceration facilities (spawned from the initial 1996 arrests) had qualified him for early release. A week after his 2000 release, Downey joined the cast of the hit television series Ally McBeal, playing the new love interest of Calista Flockhart's title character.[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/875828.stm | title = Downey Jr lands McBeal role |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=May 1, 2008 | date = August 11, 2000[/tpl] His performance was praised and the following year he was nominated for an Emmy Award in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series category and won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor in a mini-series or television film.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,29375,00.html | title = Bada Bing!

Despite the apparent success, Downey claims that his performance on the series was overrated and said, "It was my lowest point in terms of addictions. At that stage, I didn't give a fuck whether I ever acted again." In January 2001, Downey was scheduled to play the role of Hamlet in a Los Angeles stage production directed by Mel Gibson.[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/935383.stm| title = Gibson Downey Jr becomes Hamlet |publisher=BBC News | date = September 21, 2000[/tpl]
Before the end of his first season on Ally McBeal, over the Thanksgiving 2000 holiday, Downey was arrested when his room at Merv Griffin's Hotel and Givenchy Spa in Palm Springs, California was searched by the police, who were responding to an anonymous 911 call. Downey was under the influence of a controlled substance and in possession of cocaine and Valium.[tpl]cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E0D6113BF934A25754C0A9679C8B63 | title = Boldface Names |author=Baron, James|work=The New York Times |accessdate=May 1, 2008 | date = July 17, 2001[/tpl][tpl]cite news | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,107593,00.html | title = Arrested Development |author=Angluo, Sandra P.|work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=May 1, 2008 | date = April 24, 2001[/tpl] Despite the fact that, if convicted, he could face a prison sentence of up to four years and eight months, he signed on to appear in at least eight more Ally McBeal episodes.[tpl]cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1171634.stm | title = Downey Jr signs McBeal deal |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=May 11, 2008 | date = February 15, 2001[/tpl]
In April 2001, while he was on parole, a Los Angeles police officer found him wandering barefoot in Culver City, just outside Los Angeles. He was arrested for suspicion of being under the influence of drugs, but was released a few hours later,[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,15876,00.html | title = Robert Downey Jr. Fired From Ally McBeal After Another Arrest |agency=Associated Press| publisher=Fox News |accessdate=May 11, 2008 | date = April 25, 2001[/tpl] even though tests showed he had cocaine in his system.[tpl]cite news | url = http://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/news/2001/05/44194 | title = Robert Downey Jr.'s Drug 'Deal' |author=Reuters| publisher=Wired |accessdate=May 11, 2008 | date = May 31, 2001[/tpl] After this last arrest, producer David E.

In July 2001, Downey pleaded no contest to the Palm Springs charges, avoiding jail time. Instead, he was sent into drug rehabilitation and put on a three-year probation, benefiting from the California Proposition 36, which had been passed the year before with the aim of helping nonviolent drug offenders overcome their addictions instead of sending them to jail.[tpl]cite news | url = http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0107/16/se.03.html| title = Robert Downey Jr. to Enter Plea Agreement on Drug Charges | publisher=CNN |accessdate=May 11, 2008 | date = July 16, 2001[/tpl]
The book Conversations with Woody Allen reports that director Woody Allen wanted to cast Downey and Winona Ryder in his film Melinda and Melinda in 2005, but was unable to do so because he could not get insurance on them, stating, "We couldn't get bonded. The completion bonding companies would not bond the picture unless we could insure them. We were heartbroken because I had worked with Winona before Celebrity and thought she was perfect for this and wanted to work with her again. And I had always wanted to work with Bob Downey and always thought he was a huge talent."[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2011[/tpl]
In a December 18, 2000 article for People Magazine entitled "Bad to Worse", Downey's stepmother Rosemary told author Alex Tresnlowski that Downey had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder "a few years ago" and added that his bipolar disorder was "the reason he has a hard time staying sober. What hasn't been tried is medication and intensive psychotherapy."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20133274,00.html|title=Bad to Worse|author=Tresnlowski, Alex|work=People |date=December 18, 2000| accessdate=November 1, 2010[/tpl] In the same article, Dr. Manijeh Nikakhtar, a Los Angeles psychiatrist and co-author of Addiction or Self-Medication: The Truth (ISBN 978-1883819576), says she received a letter from Downey in 1999, during his time at Corcoran II, asking for advice on his condition. She discovered that "no one had done a complete psychiatric evaluation him...I asked him flat out if he thought he was bipolar, and he said, 'Oh yeah. There are times I spend a lot of money and I'm hyperactive, and there are other times I'm down.'" In an article for the March 2007 issue of Esquire, Downey told author Scott Raab that he wanted to address "this whole thing about the bipolar" after receiving a phone call from "the Bipolar Association" asking him about being bipolar. When Downey denied he had ever said he was bipolar, the caller quoted the People article, to which Downey replied, "'No! Dr. Malibusian said said I was bipolar...', and they go, 'Well, it's been written, so we're going to quote it.'"[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ0307downeyjr|title=May God Bless and Keep Robert Downey Jr.|author=Raab, Scott|work=Esquire |date=March 2007|accessdate=November 1, 2010[/tpl] Downey flatly denied being "depressed or manic" and that previous attempts to diagnose him with any kind of psychiatric or mood disorder have always been skewed because "the guy I was seeing didn't know I was smokin' crack in his bathroom. You can't make a diagnosis until somebody's sober."

===Career comeback (2001–2008)===

After five years of substance abuse, arrests, rehab, and relapse, Robert Downey Jr. was finally ready to work toward a full recovery from drugs and a return to his career. In discussing his failed attempts to control his own addictive behavior in the past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that "when someone says, 'I really wonder if maybe I should go to rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot."[tpl]YouTube|0_K_3h1KBS8|The Oprah Winfrey Show[/tpl], second segment, November 22, 2004. Retrieved March 16, 2013. He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, "I said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I reached out for help, and I ran with it. You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it. It's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems...what's hard is to decide to do it."
Downey got his first post-rehab acting job in August 2001, lip-syncing in the video for Elton John's single "I Want Love".[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1445963/20010803/john_elton.jhtml |title=Elton John Casts Robert Downey Jr. In His New Video |accessdate=May 3, 2008 |author=Schumacher-Rasmussen, Eric |date=August 3, 2001 |publisher=MTV News[/tpl] Video director Sam Taylor-Wood shot 16 takes of the video and used the last one because, according to John, Downey looked completely relaxed, and, "The way he underplays it is fantastic."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/j/john_elton/news_feature_101201/ |title=Elton John: California Love (Interview)|accessdate=May 3, 2008 |author=Rankin, Rebecca |publisher=MTV News[/tpl]
Downey was able to return to the big screen only after Mel Gibson, who had been a close friend to Downey since both had co-starred in Air America, paid Downey's insurance bond for the 2003 film The Singing Detective.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,99680,00.html |title=Mel Gibson's New 'Passion' Is Robert Downey Jr. |publisher=Fox News |author=Friedman, Roger |date=October 14, 2003 |accessdate=May 11, 2008[/tpl] Gibson's gamble paved the way for Downey's comeback and Downey returned to mainstream films in the mid-2000s with Gothika, for which producer Joel Silver withheld 40 percent of his salary until after production wrapped as insurance against his addictive behavior. Similar clauses have become standard in his contracts since then.[tpl]cite episode |title=Robert Downey Jr. |series=Shootout |serieslink=Shootout (TV series) |network=AMC |airdate=July 14, 2006[/tpl]
After Gothika, Downey was cast in a number of leading and supporting roles, including well-received work in a number of semi-independent films: A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, Good Night, and Good Luck, A Scanner Darkly, and Steven Shainberg's fictional biographical film of Diane Arbus, Fur, where Downey's character represented the two biggest influences on Arbus' professional life, Lisette Model and Marvin Israel.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/10/AR2006111000293_pf.html |title=A 'Fur'-Fetched Portrait Of Arbus?

On November 23, 2004, Downey released his debut musical album, The Futurist, on Sony Classical, for which he designed the cover art and designed the track listing label on the CD with his son Indio.As listed in the credits on the CD version of The Futurist.

In 2006, Downey returned to his television roots when he guest-starred on Family Guy in the episode "The Fat Guy Strangler". Downey had previously telephoned the show's production staff and asked if he could produce or assist in an episode creation, as his son Indio is a fan of the show. The producers of the show accepted the offer and created the character of Patrick Pewterschmidt, Lois Griffin's long lost, mentally disturbed brother, for Downey.[tpl]cite video | people=Sheridan, Chris|date=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "The Fat Guy Strangler"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox[/tpl]
Downey signed on with publishers HarperCollins to write a memoir, which in 2006 was already being billed as a "candid look at the highs and lows of his life and career". In 2008, however, Downey returned his advance to the publishers and canceled the book without further comment.[tpl]cite news |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/25801610/ns/today-books/ |title= Robert Downey Jr. postpones memoir |work=MSNBC |author=Italie, Hillel |date=July 30, 2008 |accessdate=January 24, 2008[/tpl]

===Summer 2008 blockbusters===

With all of the critical success Downey had experienced throughout his career, he had never appeared in a "blockbuster" film. That changed in the middle of 2008 when Downey starred in two critically and commercially successful films, Iron Man and Tropic Thunder. In the article Ben Stiller  wrote for Downey's entry in the 2008 edition of The Time 100, he offered an observation on Downey's commercially successful summer at the box office:
[tpl]quote|Yes, Downey is Iron Man, but he really is Actor Man....In the realm where box office is irrelevant and talent is king, the realm that actually means something, he has always ruled, and finally this summer he gets to have his cake and let us eat him up all the way to the multiplex, where his mastery is in full effect. |-- Ben Stiller, The 2008 Time 100, entry No. 60, "Robert Downey Jr."[tpl]cite news | author=Stiller, Ben|title = The 2008 Time 100, entry No. 60, 'Robert Downey Jr.' |work=Time Magazine|date = May 11, 2008 | url = http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1733748_1733752_1734629,00.html | accessdate=April 17, 2009 | authorlink = Ben Stiller[/tpl][/tpl]

====Tropic Thunder====

After Iron Man, Downey appeared alongside Ben Stiller and Jack Black in another 2008 summer film, the Stiller-directed Tropic Thunder. The three stars each play a Hollywood archetype—with Downey playing a self-absorbed multi-Oscar-winning Aussie method actor Kirk Lazarus—as they star in an extremely expensive Vietnam-era film called Tropic Thunder. Lazarus undergoes a "controversial skin pigmentation procedure" in order to take on the role of African American platoon sergeant Lincoln Osiris, which required Downey to wear dark makeup and a wig. Both Stiller and Downey feared Downey's portrayal of the character could become controversial:
[tpl]quote|Stiller says that he and Downey always stayed focused on the fact that they were skewering insufferable actors, not African Americans. 'I was trying to push it as far as you can within reality,' Stiller explains. 'I had no idea how people would respond to it.' Stiller screened a rough cut of the film March 2008 and it scored high with African Americans. He was relieved at the reaction. 'It seems people really embrace it,' he says.[tpl]cite news | author=Adam B.

When asked by Harry Smith on CBS's The Early Show who his model was for Lazarus, Downey laughed before responding, "Sadly, my sorry-ass self."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EU_vi6QgeY|title=Robert Downey Jr. on 'Thunder'|publisher=CBS|date=August 18, 2008|accessdate=August 21, 2008[/tpl]
Released in the United States on August 13, 2008, Tropic Thunder received good reviews with 83% of reviews positive and an average normalized score of 71, according to the review aggregator websites Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, respectively. It earned US$26 million in its North American opening weekend and retained the number one position for its first three weekends of release. The film grossed $180 million in theaters before its release on home video on November 18, 2008. Downey was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Lazarus.

===2009-present===

Opening in late April 2009 was a film Downey finished in mid-2008, The Soloist.

Following the tremendous success of 2008's Iron Man, Downey agreed to reprise his role as Tony Stark in two more Iron Man films as well as the superhero team put together by S.H.I.E.L.D., The Avengers. After appearing in a connecting cameo scene at the end of the 2008 version of The Incredible Hulk, Downey returned as Tony Stark in the first of two planned sequels to Iron Man, Iron Man 2, opened in May 2010.
