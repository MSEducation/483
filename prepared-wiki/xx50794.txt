[[Yala Province]]

CATEGORIES: Yala Province, Provinces of Thailand

Yala ([tpl]lang-th|ยะลา[/tpl]) is the southernmost province (changwat) of Thailand. Neighboring provinces are (from north-west clockwise) Songkhla, Pattani and Narathiwat. Yala is the only land-locked province in the south of Thailand and its southern part borders Kedah and Perak of Malaysia.

==Etymology==

The name "Yala" is the Thai transliteration of Jala (Jawi: جال) and the original Malay name means "net". The province is also known as Jolor (Jawi: جولور) in Patani Malay language.

==Geography==

Yala Province is located in Southern Thailand. The highest point of the Sankalakhiri Range (Northern Titiwangsa Mountains), the [tpl]convert|1,533|m|ft[/tpl]-high Ulu Titi Basah (ยูลูติติ บาซาห์), is located at the Thai/Malaysian border between Yala Province and Perak.[tpl]cite web|title=Gunong Ulu Titi Basah: Thailand|url=http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-4622806&fid=6089&c=thailand#MAP|work=Geographical Names|publisher=Information Technology Associates|accessdate=8 April 2014|year=1995–2012[/tpl]

==History==

Historically, Pattani Province was the centre of the Sultanate of Patani, a semi-independent Malay kingdom that paid tribute to the Thai kingdoms of Sukhothai and Ayutthaya. After Ayutthaya fell under Burmese control in 1767, the Sultanate of Patani gained full independence, but under King Rama I (reigned from 1782 to 1809), the area was placed under Siam's control in 1785.[tpl]citation needed|date=April 2014[/tpl]
In 1909 the province was recognized as part of Siam by the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909, negotiated with the British Empire. Along with Narathiwat, Yala was originally part of Pattani Province, but the Thais made them separate provinces. There is a small separatist movement in Yala, which after being dormant for many years, erupted again in 2004. In 2014 the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises its citizens to only undertake essential travel in the province, while the Australian Government's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade recommends that travellers do not enter the province.[tpl]cite web|title=Foreign travel advice Thailand|url=https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/thailand|work=GOV.UK|publisher=Crown|accessdate=8 April 2014|date=25 March 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Thailand|url=http://smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/Advice/thailand|work=smartraveller.com.au|publisher=Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade|accessdate=8 April 2014|date=3 April 2014[/tpl]
Eight bombs exploded in the province over the course of two days, 6 and 7 April 2014. The explosions resulted in one death and 28 injuries, as well as damage to a warehouse estimated to be THB100 million. Local officials consequently tightened security in the province due to the Songkran festivities scheduled for mid-April.[tpl]cite news|title=Four more bombs explode in Yala this morning|url=http://www.mcot.net/site/content?id=53424946be04703c648b4612#.U0NXqK2SzwP|accessdate=8 April 2014|newspaper=MCOT|date=7 April 2014[/tpl]
