</ref> In contrast to spirals, an [[elliptical galaxy]] loses the cold component of its interstellar medium within roughly a billion years, which hinders the galaxy from forming diffuse nebulae except through  mergers with other galaxies.<ref>

In the dense nebulae where stars are produced, much of the hydrogen is in the molecular (H2) form, so these nebulae are called molecular clouds. Observations indicate that the coldest clouds tend to form low-mass stars, observed first in the infrared inside the clouds, then in visible light at their surface when the clouds dissipate, while giant molecular clouds, which are generally warmer, produce stars of all masses.[tpl]cite book | first=James | last=Lequeux | title=Birth, Evolution and Death of Stars | publisher=World Scientific | year=2013 | isbn=978-981-4508-77-3[/tpl] These giant molecular clouds have typical densities of 100 particles per cm3, diameters of [tpl]convert|100|ly|km|lk=on[/tpl], masses of up to 6Â million solar masses,[ref]
