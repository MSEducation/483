[[Olympic Plaza, Kiev]]

CATEGORIES: Economy of Kiev

Olympic Plaza is a planned shopping mall in the Ukrainian capital city Kiev. If constructed, the Olympic Plaza would be located in front of the Olimpiysky National Sports Complex. 
The mall's construction has been halted because of concerns that the adjacent stadium would not have enough free space to accommodate the large number of tourists coming to matches of the UEFA Euro 2012 championship. The Union of European Football Associations has banned games at the stadium until their concerns with the Olympic Plaza are addressed.
On November 1, 2007, the Kiev City Council adopted a resolution to refer to the firm responsible for the plaza's construction, with a proposal to compensate 200 million hryvnias for proposed demolition of the Olympic Plaza.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.korrespondent.net/main/214666/|title=Kievsoviet compensates demolition of the unfinished mall in front of the NSK Olimpiyskiy|date=November 1, 2007|accessdate=2007-11-09|work=Korrespondent.net[/tpl] The Mayor of Kiev Leonid Chernovetsky stated on November 19 that he has signed a bill that would allow demolition of the Olympic Plaza.
