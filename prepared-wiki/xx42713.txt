By the turn of the 21st century, he had established himself as a leading man skilled with a satirical comic talent. Grant has expanded his oeuvre with critically acclaimed turns as a cad in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), About a Boy (2002), and American Dreamz (2006).[tpl]cite web|title=Rotten Tomatoes: Hugh Grant |publisher=IGN Entertainment |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/hugh_grant/ |accessdate=25 September 2007[/tpl] He later played against type with multiple cameo roles in the epic drama film Cloud Atlas (2012).
Within the film industry, Grant is cited as an anti-film star who approaches his roles like a character actor, and attempts to make his acting appear spontaneous. Hallmarks of his comic skills include a nonchalant touch of irony/sarcasm and studied physical mannerisms as well as his precisely-timed dialogue delivery and facial expressions. The entertainment media's coverage of Grant's life off the big screen has often overshadowed his work as a thespian.[tpl]cite news |first=Jeremy |last=Hodges |title=About a very private girl |work=Daily Mail  |date=22 April 2002 |accessdate=12 September 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2780369.stm | title=British screen legends: Hugh Grant |publisher=BBC | date=21 February 2003 | accessdate=28 September 2007[/tpl] He has been vocal about his disrespect for the profession of acting, and in his disdain towards the culture of celebrity and hostility towards the media.[tpl]cite news | first=Eloise | last=Parker | title=Why Grant's so grumpy |work=Daily Post |page=13 |date=3 February 2007 | accessdate=21 September 2007[/tpl] In a career spanning 30 years, Grant has repeatedly claimed that acting is not a true calling but just a job he fell into.

==Early life and ancestry==

Grant was born at Charing Cross Hospital in Hammersmith, London, the second son of Fynvola Susan MacLean (b. Wickham, Hampshire, 11 October 1933; d. Hounslow, London, July 2001) and Captain James Murray Grant (b. 1929). Genealogist Antony Adolph has described Grant's family history as "a colourful Anglo-Scottish tapestry of warriors, empire-builders and aristocracy,"[tpl]Cite news | last = Gilchrist | first = Jim | title = Stars dig up surprises with their ancestors |work=The Scotsman  | date = 17 August 2005 | url = http://news.scotsman.com/genealogy/Stars-dig-up-surprises-with.2652717.jp |accessdate=10 September 2007 | location=Edinburgh[/tpl] including William Drummond, 4th Viscount Strathallan and Dr. James Stewart.[tpl]cite web|title=Grants of Glenmoriston |publisher=ElectricScotland.com |url=http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/dtog/grant2.html |accessdate=28 September 2007[/tpl]Hugh's Family Tree[tpl]dead link|date=November 2011[/tpl] John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl, Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham, Rt.

===Education===

Grant started his education at Hogarth Primary School in Chiswick but then moved to St Peter's Primary School in Hammersmith. From 1969 to 1978, he attended the independent Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith on a scholarship and played 1st XV rugby, cricket and football for the school.[tpl]Cite news | title = Hugh Grant amongst past pupils bidding farewell to Chris Hammond | publisher = ChiswickW4.com | date = 11 July 2007 | url = http://chiswickw4.com/default.asp?section=info&spage=common/conschools95.htm |accessdate=11 September 2007[/tpl] He also represented Latymer on the popular quiz show, Top of the Form, an academic competition between two teams of four secondary school students each.[tpl]cite episode |title=Inside the Actors Studio: Hugh Grant |series=Inside the Actors Studio |url=http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio|serieslink=Inside the Actors Studio |credits= Presenter: James Lipton |network=Bravo |airdate=12 May 2002 |season=8 |number=813 |transcripturl=http://youtube.com/watch?v=5p4KP212qo0[/tpl] In 1979, he won the Galsworthy scholarship to New College, Oxford where he starred in his first film, Privileged, produced by the Oxford University Film Foundation, OUFF.

===Young earner===

The group toured London's pub comedy circuit with stops at The George IV in Chiswick, Canal Cafe Theatre in Little Venice and The King's Head in Islington.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] Starting on a low note, The Jockeys of Norfolk eventually proved a hit at the Edinburgh Festival after their sketch on the Nativity, told as an Ealing comedy, gained them a spot on the BBC2 TV show called Edinburgh Nights.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] During this time, Grant also appeared in theatre productions of plays such as An Inspector Calls, Lady Windermere's Fan, and Coriolanus.

==Career==

Grant's first leading film role came in Merchant-Ivory's Edwardian drama, Maurice (1987), adapted from E. M. Forster's novel. He and co-star James Wilby shared the Volpi Cup for best actor at the Venice Film Festival for their portrayals of lovers Clive Durham and Maurice Hall, respectively. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Grant balanced small roles on television with rare film work, which included a supporting role in The Dawning (1988), opposite Anthony Hopkins and Jean Simmons and a turn as Lord Byron in a Goya Award-winning Spanish production called Remando al viento (1988). He also portrayed some other real life figures during his early career such as Charles Heidsieck in Champagne Charlie and as Hugh Cholmondeley in BAFTA Award-nominated White Mischief.
In 1990, he made a cameo appearance in the sport/crime drama The Big Man, opposite Liam Neeson, and in which Grant assumed a Scottish accent. The film explores the life of a Scottish miner (Neeson) who becomes unemployed during a union strike. In 1991, he played Julie Andrews' gay son in the ABC made-for-television film Our Sons.
In 1992, he appeared in Roman Polanski's film Bitter Moon, portraying a fastidious and proper British tourist who is married, but finds himself enticed by the sexual hedonism of a seductive French woman and her embittered, paraplegic American husband. The film was called an "anti-romantic opus of sexual obsession and cruelty" by the Washington Post.[tpl]Cite news | last = Brown | first = Joe | author-link = | title = Bitter Moon | newspaper = Washington Post | date = 15 April 1994 |accessdate=29 September 2007[/tpl] His other work in period pieces such as Ken Russell’s horror film, The Lair of the White Worm (1988), award-winning Merchant-Ivory drama The Remains of the Day (1993) and (as Frédéric Chopin in) Impromptu (1991) went largely unnoticed. He later called this phase of his career "hilarious," referring to his early films as "Europuddings, where you would have a French script, a Spanish director, and English actors. The script would usually be written by a foreigner, badly translated into English. And then they'd get English actors in, because they thought that was the way to sell it to America."
At 32, Grant claimed to be on the brink of giving up the acting profession but was surprised by the script of Four Weddings and a Funeral (FWAAF). "If you read as many bad scripts as I did, you'd know how grateful you are when you come across one where the guy actually is funny," he later recalled. Released in 1994, FWAAF became the highest-grossing British film to date with a worldwide box office in excess of $244 million,[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=hughgrant.htm |publisher=Box Office Mojo |title= Hugh Grant |accessdate=11 September 2007[/tpl] making Grant an overnight international star. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, and among numerous awards won by its cast and crew, it earned Grant his first and only Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. It also temporarily typecast him as the lead character, Charles, a bohemian and debonair bachelor. Grant and Curtis saw it as an inside joke that the star, due to the parts he played, was assumed to have the personality of the screenwriter, who is known for writing about himself and his own life.[tpl]cite news | title=Faces of the week: Richard Curtis |author=Chris Jones |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4606743.stm |publisher=BBC | date=3 June 2005 | accessdate=11 September 2007[/tpl] Grant later expressed:
thumb|Grant in his breakthrough performance as Richard Curtis's alter ego, Charles, in Four Weddings and a Funeral [tpl]cquote| Although I owe whatever success I've had to Four Weddings and a Funeral, it did become frustrating after a bit that people made two assumptions: One was that I was that character – when in fact nothing could be further from the truth, as I'm sure Richard would tell you – and the other frustrating thing was that they thought that's all I could do. I suppose, because those films happened to be successful, no one, perhaps understandably, ... bothered to rent all the other films I'd done.[tpl]cite news | first=Sharon | last=Knolle | title=Prince Charming | page=A1 |work=Variety | date=16 December 2002 | accessdate=11 September 2007[/tpl][/tpl]

Grant's first studio-financed Hollywood project was Chris Columbus's comedy Nine Months. Though a hit at the box office, it was almost universally panned by critics. The Washington Post called it a "grotesquely pandering caper" and singled out Grant's performance, as a child psychiatrist reacting unfavourably to his girlfriend's unexpected pregnancy, for his "insufferable muggings."[tpl]Cite news | last = Howe | first = Desson | author-link = | title = Movie Reviews:Nine Months | date = 14 July 1995 |accessdate=29 September 2007 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/ninemonthspg13howe_c02245.htm |newspaper=The Washington Post | postscript =[/tpl] The same year, he played leading roles as Emma Thompson's suitor in Ang Lee’s Academy Award-winning adaptation of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility and as a cartographer in 1917 Wales in The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain. In the same year he performed in the Academy Award-winning Restoration.
Before the release of Four Weddings and a Funeral, Grant reunited with its director, Mike Newell, for the tragicomedy An Awfully Big Adventure that was labelled a "determinedly off-beat film" by The New York Times. Grant portrayed a bitchy, supercilious director of a repertory company in post-World War II Liverpool. Critic Roger Ebert wrote, "It shows that he has range as an actor,"[tpl]Cite news | last = Ebert | first = Robert | author-link = Roger Ebert | title = Movie Reviews:An Awfully Big Adventure | newspaper = Chicago Sun-Times | date = 25 September 1995 |accessdate=29 September 2007 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950922/REVIEWS/509220301/1023[/tpl] but the San Francisco Chronicle disapproved on grounds that the film "plays like a vanity production for Grant."[tpl]Cite news | last = Guthmann | first = Edwards | author-link = | title = This Grant 'Adventure' An Awfully Chilly One | newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle | date = 21 July 1995 |accessdate=29 September 2007 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/07/21/DD64380.DTL[/tpl] Janet Maslin, praising Grant as "superb" and "a dashing cad under any circumstances," commented, "For him this film represents the road not taken.

After a three-year hiatus, in 1999 he paired with Julia Roberts in Notting Hill, which was brought to theatres by much of the same team that was responsible for Four Weddings and a Funeral. This new Working Title production displaced Four Weddings and a Funeral as the biggest British hit in the history of cinema, with earnings equalling $363 million worldwide. As it became exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture, the film was also received well by critics. CNN reviewer Paul Clinton said, "Notting Hill stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/9905/27/review.notting.hill/|title=Review: Julia, Hugh a perfect match for 'Notting Hill'|accessdate=21 May 2007|date=27 May 1999|author=Paul Clinton|publisher=CNN[/tpl] Reactions to Grant's Golden Globe-nominated performance were varied, with Salon.com's Stephanie Zacharek criticising that, "Grant's performance stands as an emblem of what's wrong with Notting Hill. What's maddening about Grant is that he just never cuts the crap.
