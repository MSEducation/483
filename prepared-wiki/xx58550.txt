Tatchell stated as part of the announcement that the documentary "will not be an anti-Catholic programme".<ref name="catholicdocumentary" />
With respect to Anglicanism, he stated that "it's very sad to see a good man like the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, going to such extraordinary lengths to appease homophobes within the Anglican Communion".Irish Times, p 17, 25 July 2008
On 15 September 2010, Tatchell, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter, published in The Guardian, stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI's state visit to the UK.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/15/harsh-judgments-on-pope-religion|title=Letters: Harsh judgments on the pope and religion|work=The Guardian|accessdate=16 September 2010 | location=London | date=15 September 2010[/tpl]

Tatchell is critical of Muslim fundamentalism, and first wrote its rise in Britain in 1995.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.petertatchell.net/religion/islamic.htm |title=Islamic Fundamentalism in Britain |publisher=Peter Tatchell |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09[/tpl] However, Tatchell condemned Islamophobia, saying "Any form of prejudice, hatred, discrimination or violence against Muslims is wrong.

In 2006, he helped stop the abuse of Muslim prisoners at Norwich jail and helped secure parole for other Muslim detainees.Sue Simkim, Anna Thomas-Betts, "Prisoners or Detainees?" Independent Monitor, The Association of Members of Independent Monitoring Boards, March 2008, Issue 93, pp. 12–15. Half his asylum cases are, he reports, male and female Muslim refugees. Two of his highest-profile campaigns involved Muslim victims—Mohamed S, who was framed by men who first tried to kill him and then jailed him for eight years, and Sid Saeed, who brought a racist and homophobic harassment case against Deutsche Bank."Gay Muslim Appeals Against Conviction", UK Gay News, 8 May 2006.Jamie Doward, "Fallen City star claims gay bigotry: Deutsche Bank faces allegations of sexual discrimination against vice-president", The Observer, 20 February 2005.
Tatchell has described Sharia law as "a clerical form of fascism"[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.islamophobia-watch.com/islamophobia-watch/2006/3/18/alliance-with-bigots-wont-halt-fascists.html |title=Article |publisher=Islamophobia-watch.com |date=18 March 2006 |accessdate=17 September 2010[/tpl] on the grounds that it opposes democracy and human rights, especially for women and gay people. He was the keynote speaker at a 2005 protest at the Canadian High Commission demanding that Ontario's arbitration law, which permitted religious arbitration in civil cases for Jews and Christians, be extended to Muslims. Tatchell argued there should be no separate arbitration systems for any specific religion.OutRage! press release[tpl]Dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl] In 1995 he wrote that "although not all Muslims are anti-gay, significant numbers are violently homophobic ... homophobic Muslim voters may be able to influence the outcome of elections in 20 or more marginal constituencies."[tpl]cite web  |url=http://www.petertatchell.net/religion/islamic.htm  |title=Islamic Fundamentalism in Britain  |publisher=www.petertatchell.net  |accessdate=1 February 2008  |date=1 October 1995  |last=Tatchell  |first=Peter[/tpl]
Tatchell describes the umbrella group Muslim Council of Britain as "anti-gay",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2006/02/333630.html |title=Indymedia article |publisher=Indymedia article |date=14 February 2006 |accessdate=17 September 2010[/tpl] asking how "they expect to win respect for their community, if at the same time as demanding action against Islamophobia, they themselves demand the legal enforcement of homophobia?". He noted that the MCB had joined forces with right-wing Christian fundamentalists to oppose every gay law reform from 1997 to 2006. The opposition of MCB Chairman Sir Iqbal Sacranie to homosexuality and registration of civil partnerships led Tatchell to observe "Both the Muslim and gay communities suffer prejudice and discrimination. We should stand together to fight Islamophobia and homophobia".[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4579146.stm |title=online |publisher=BBC News |date=3 January 2006 |accessdate=17 September 2010[/tpl] Tatchell subsequently criticised Unite Against Fascism for inviting Sacranie to share its platforms, describing him as a bigot and a "homophobic hate-mongerer."[tpl]cite web  |url=http://www.petertatchell.net/politics/sacranie.htm  |title=Battered, bruised and betrayed  |publisher=www.petertatchell.net  |accessdate=1 February 2008  |date=14 February 2006  |last=Tatchell  |first=Peter[/tpl] This was in response to Sacranie's denunciation of gay people as immoral, harmful and diseased on BBC Radio 4. When the MCB boycotted Holocaust Memorial Day, partly because it included a commemoration of the gay victims of Nazism, Tatchell wrote that "the only thing that is consistent about the MCB is its opposition to the human rights of lesbians and gay men".[tpl]cite web  |url=http://www.petertatchell.net/religion/muslimhmdprejudice.htm  |title=Crucifying queers  |publisher=www.petertatchell.net  |accessdate=1 February 2008  |date=6 January 2005  |last=Tatchell  |first=Peter[/tpl]
A colleague of Tatchell's, Islamic theologian Muhammad Yusuf, a research fellow with Interfaith Alliance UK, withdrew from a planned lecture on "an Islamic reformation that reconciles Islam with democracy and human rights, including human rights for women and gay people" after receiving threats from Islamist fundamentalists. Yusuf said that "senior Islamic clerics" told him they could not guarantee his safety if he went ahead.[tpl]Cite news|title=Liberal Islamic scholar forced to pull out of gay rights speech by Muslim leaders |last=Cohen |first=Benjamin |date=20 March 2006 |newspaper=Pink News |accessdate=1 November 2009 |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-864.html[/tpl] The lecture was to raise funds for the Peter Tatchell Human Rights Fund.
Tatchell chose Malcolm X as his specialist subject when appearing on Celebrity Mastermind, explaining that he considered him an inspiration and hero (his other inspirations are Mahatma Gandhi, Sylvia Pankhurst and Martin Luther King).

In a Michigan boarding house, he raised rent money by sleeping with a gay transvestite.( p. 77 ) Later, in New York, Little and some friends raised funds by being fellated by men at the YMCA where he lived.( p. 77 ) In Boston a man paid Little to undress him, sprinkle him with talcum powder, and bring him to orgasm.(Perry, pp. 82–83.) Perry notes that Little's motives appear to have been financial, but he could have earned money in other ways.( p. 77 )
Following the hanging of two teenage boys, Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni by Iranian authorities, Tatchell reiterated his long-standing view that the Islamic Republic of Iran is an "Islamo-fascist state". Tatchell claimed the two youths were hanged merely for being gay. He bases this opinion on information from activists inside Iran and from friends of the hanged youths who were with them at a secret gay party before they were arrested. The Iranian government and state-licensed media claim the youths were guilty of rape of a 13-year old boy at knifepoint. Tatchell observes that trumped up charges are routine in Iran. Left-wing political activists are, for example, often arrested on false charges such as spying, adultery, drug taking, sodomy and alcoholism. No claims by the Iranian government or judiciary should ever be taken at face value, he says. International human rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch preferred campaigners to focus on the propriety of hanging two teenagers rather than the alleged connection to gay sex.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20050815/kim |title=The Nation |publisher=The Nation |date= |accessdate=17 September 2010[/tpl] Faisal Alam, founder of American Gay Muslim group Al-Fatiha, argued in the magazine Queer that Iran was condemned before the facts were certain,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2005/09/322759.html |title=Indymedia article |publisher=Indymedia article |date= |accessdate=17 September 2010[/tpl] and in 2003 the United Nations Committee Against Torture noted that "from different and reliable sources that there currently is no active policy of prosecution of charges of homosexuality in Iran".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hri.ca/fortherecord2003/documentation/tbodies/cat-c-30-d-190-2001.htm|title=Decisions of the Committee Against Torture — Article 7.4|date=26 May 2003|work=Human Rights Internet|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050120121129/http://www.hri.ca/fortherecord2003/documentation/tbodies/cat-c-30-d-190-2001.htm|archivedate=20 January 2005[/tpl] This is disputed by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission. They confirm that the death penalty exists for homosexuality in Iran and that gay and lesbian people suffer persecution, including arrest, torture, imprisonment and execution by slow strangulation. This is corroborated by the Iranian Railroad for Queer Refugees (formerly the Persian Gay and Lesbian Organisation), most of whose members are based inside Iran and regularly provide reports of homophobic beatings, torture and imprisonment by state agents.
In 2004, then-Mayor of London Ken Livingstone criticised Tatchell for Islamophobia over comments he made concerning the pending visit of the Muslim scholar Yusuf al-Qaradawi.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.whatnextjournal.org.uk/Pages/politics/Reply.html |title=Tatchell’s Islamic Conspiracy Theory |publisher=Whatnextjournal.org.uk |date= |accessdate=24 December 2011[/tpl] Two years later, Livingstone stated that he "probably shouldn't" have called Tatchell an "Islamophobe", but defended his actions at the time by saying "in politics you engage with people which you have profound disagreements with...", giving as an example then-Mayor of Moscow Yury Luzhkov's support of  London for the 2012 Olympics as vital to the bid's success in spite of Luzhkov's regular bans of Moscow Pride.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/im-a-polymorphous-pervert-boris-and-his-mayoral-rivals-make-their-case-for-the-gay-vote-802355.html |title='I'm a polymorphous pervert': Boris and his mayoral rivals make their case for the gay vote — UK Politics — UK |publisher=The Independent |date=29 March 2008 |accessdate=24 December 2011[/tpl]
Concerning the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, Tatchell spoke at an event whose organisers termed a "Rally for free expression" defending the publication of cartoons of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and in support for free speech in general.Gays in Eurabia – Muslim immigrants to Europe are threatening the rights of gays, women and free speech – 20 April 2006. Tatchell had expected "thousands" to attend the event, which was held on 25 March 2006, but police estimated only 250 people attended.[tpl]Cite news|title=Hundreds join free speech rally |date=25 March 2006 |newspaper=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4844634.stm[/tpl]
Tatchell's speech at the rally claimed, "As well as challenging religious-inspired tyranny, let us also say loud and clear that we defend Muslim communities against prejudice and discrimination. Let us declare that we deplore the homophobia, race hate, Islamophobia and antisemitism of the British National Party."
Speaking to the Guardian following the release of the Borat film in the UK, Tatchell criticised Sacha Baron Cohen for his double standards and ‘self-censorship', saying "he regards Christians and Jews as fair game, he never gives Muslims the same doing over".
In February 2010, Women Against Fundamentalism defended Tatchell against allegations of Islamophobia and endorsed his right to challenge all religious fundamentalism: "WAF supports the right of Peter Tatchell and numerous other gay activists to oppose the legitimisation of fundamentalists and other right wing forces on university campuses, by the Left and by the government in its Preventing Violent Extremism strategy and numerous other programmes and platforms".[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.womenagainstfundamentalism.org.uk/waf-tatchell.html |title=WAF — Peter Tatchell statement |publisher=Womenagainstfundamentalism.org.uk |date= |accessdate=17 September 2010[/tpl]

====Yusuf al-Qaradawi====

Livingstone's invitation of Yusuf al-Qaradawi to address a conference on the wearing of the hijab led to a four-year rift between Livingstone and Tatchell, who described Qaradawi as "rightwing, misogynist, anti-semitic and homophobic" and as someone who claimed to have liberal positions in order to deceive Western politicians.An embrace that shames London New Statesman — Peter Tatchell — Monday 24 January 2005 Tatchell cites Qaradawi's books and online fatwas where he advocates the execution of apostates (Muslims who turn away from their faith), women who have sex outside marriage and lesbian and gay people. He notes that Qaradawi also supports female genital mutilation and blames rape victims who dress immodestly. Tatchell highlighted the fact that 2,500 Muslims intellectuals signed an open letter in 2004 that condemned Qaradawi as an apologist for terrorism and human rights abuses. Livingstone issued a dossier in defence of Qaradawi as a moderate,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/news/docs/qaradawi_dossier.rtf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050324203018/http://www.london.gov.uk/news/docs/qaradawi_dossier.rtf |archivedate=24 March 2005 |title=Why the Mayor of London will maintain dialogue with all of London's faiths and communities — A reply to the dossier against Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=24 March 2005 |accessdate=24 December 2011[/tpl] and accused Tatchell of writing about the conference without attending it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200407190012 |title=New Statesman article |publisher=New Statesman article |date=19 July 2004 |accessdate=17 September 2010[/tpl] The dispute became bitter, with Tatchell leading a demonstration against Qaradawi and with Livingstone claiming that Tatchell has "a long history of Islamophobia", and had "constructed a fantasy world in which the main threat we face, worse than the far right, is Islamic fundamentalist hordes... taking him into a de facto alliance with the American neo-cons and Israeli intelligence services who want to present themselves as defending western 'civilisation' against more 'backward' civilisations in the Middle East and elsewhere."Tatchell's Islamic Conspiracy Theory – What Next journal. Ken Livingstone – February 2005. Tatchell strenuously denied the accusations, pointing out that he has never said any of the things that Livingstone accused him of saying. Imaan, a gay Muslim organisation, initially supported the campaign against Qaradawi, signing a joint letter to the Mayor of London with OutRage! and over a dozen other community groups, including the National Union of Students and Hindu, Sikh and Jewish organisations. The letter condemned Livingstone for hosting the cleric. However, Imaan then reversed its position and withdrew its signature to the letter, along with other organisations. Imaan members were very highly critical of Tatchell's campaign against Qaradawi, some accusing him of anti-Muslim racism. http://www.whatnextjournal.org.uk/Pages/Politics/Reply.html

====Muslims and gay rights====

Tatchell wrote in the Guardian that certain Muslim leaders, whom Tatchell describes as appearing "to be representative of the majority of British Muslim opinion", of "intolerance" to gay people. He said people such as Hizb ut-Tahrir were extreme fundamentalists who had an "agenda for clerical fascism," He noted that its constitution explicitly rejects democracy (non-Islamic parties would be banned) and human rights (non-Muslims would have fewer rights and freedoms). Tatchell further claimed that "The suppression of critics within the Muslim community is already excessive", adding "the MCB went out of its way to expose Irshad Manji as a lesbian in a seedy bid to discredit her ideas." Tatchell had himself previously outed religious figures he viewed as hypocritical and homophobic, but he felt that Manji was neither hypocritical nor homophobic, so the MCB's action in drawing attention to her sexuality was, he said, unjustified.
In February 2007 the Mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, visited Livingstone for an annual meeting that also involved the Mayors of Berlin and Paris, with the mayor of Beijing present as well. PlanetOut Inc.'s Gay.com website reported:[tpl]Cite news|url=http://uk.gay.com/article/5360|title=London protest at anti-gay Moscow mayor|work=Gay.com|date=26 February 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070312174318/http://uk.gay.com/article/5360|archivedate=12 March 2007[/tpl] [tpl]quote|In February 2006, Grand Mufti Talgat Tadzhuddin was quoted as saying about Moscow gay pride marchers, "If they come out on to the streets anyway they should be flogged.

Livingstone issued a statement saying "I have already, and continue, to condemn all these and assert the basic human and civil right of gays and lesbians to peacefully demonstrate", but added "'It is clear that there is a concerted attack on gay and lesbian rights in a series of East European countries fed by diverse currents. In Moscow the Russian Orthodox church, the chief rabbi and the grand Mufti all supported the ban on the Gay Pride march with the main role, due to its great weight in society, being played by the Orthodox church. The attempt of Mr Tatchell to focus attention on the role of the grand Mufti in Moscow, in the face of numerous attacks on gay rights in Eastern Europe, which overwhelmingly come from right-wing Christian and secular currents, is a clear example of an Islamaphobic campaign."Mayor of London supports rights of gays and lesbians to peacefully demonstrate throughout Eastern Europe including Moscow – Mayor of Londons Office – 28 February 2007.[tpl]Dead link|date=February 2010[/tpl] Tatchell retorted that Livingstone's remarks were "dishonest, despicable nonsense", adding "The Grand Mufti was not singled out". He further said the Mayor had brought his "office into disrepute" and "has revealed himself to be a person without principles, honesty or integrity."Gay Pride Parade Wars: Livingstone Attacks Tatchell and Alexeyev Attacks Livingstone – UK Gay News – 1 March 2007.
Following the vote by the Knesset, the Israeli legislature, in 2007 in favour of bills to ban lesbian and gay pride parades in Jerusalem, the Lesbian and Gay Coalition Against Racism criticised Tatchell saying "Peter Tatchell and others who have distinguished themselves by the speed of their quite proper defence of lesbian and gay rights when these have been attacked by Black, Arab, Muslim forces or regimes have still refused to condemn with equal force the official attacks on lesbian and gay rights by the highest institutions of the State of Israel." Tatchell was in and out of hospital at the time, as a result of the injuries he received at the hands of far-right assailants in Moscow. On his partial recovery, he issued a strong statement condemning the religious Jewish fundamentalists who had promoted the pride-ban bill.Peter Tatchell, "Don't Boycott World Pride in Jerusalem – Tatchell", UK Gay News, 19 June 2006 .

====Adam Yosef====

In December 2005, Muslim journalist and Respect party activist Adam Yosef came under criticism for an article in Desi Xpress opposing registered civil partnerships and then retracted it. His next column identified Peter Tatchell, British National Party leader Nick Griffin and Omar Bakri Mohammed of Al-Muhajiroun as the top three "hate filled bigots", saying that Tatchell needed "a good slap in the face" and his "queer campaign army" should "pack their bent bags and head back to Australia". Tatchell denounced a "naked appeal to homophobia and xenophobia" echoing "the racist, xenophobic language of the BNP",[ref]
