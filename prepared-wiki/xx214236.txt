State Highway 21 is an expressway in El Paso County, in eastern Colorado Springs.  The highway serves as an eastern bypass for the city of Colorado Springs.  Officially, the routing is from I-25 at Northgate Blvd in the north to Drennan Rd in the south.

==Route description==

For most of its routing the highway is a four to six-lane, limited access highway. In the north, it begins as a semi-freeway with a 60 mph speed limit, and becomes a six lane expressway with a 55 mph speed limit in the city of Colorado Springs after Union Boulevard and remains so throughout the entire route. The northern section, from Research Parkway to Interquest Parkway/SH 83 is constructed to interstate highway standards with sufficient right-of-way to construct planned overpasses and on/off-ramps. CDOT completed interchanges and bridges at Union Boulevard and Briargate Parkway in 2013.  Future interchanges at Research Parkway, Old Ranch Road, SH 83 and a future freeway to freeway interchange planned for the SH 21/I-25/Northgate Blvd interchange will be constructed based on the availability of funding and need.  The whole routing from I-25 to Proby Parkway is planned as a controlled-access freeway.  The southern portion (from Research Parkway) is a limited-access highway with interchanges constructed at Woodmen Road and Platte Ave/US 24. It ends at Mesa Ridge Parkway in Security-Widefield.
