==Notable incidents==

On March 19, 2012, Richard Spisak, 35, pleaded guilty to engaging in a sexual act with a male prisoner over whom he had disciplinary authority while Spisak was a Senior Corrections Specialist at FDC Philadelphia in 2010. Spisak further admitted to threatening to set off his body alarm and falsely report that the inmate had attacked him if the inmate did not perform oral sex on him. The victim acquiesced after Spisak's threats. Two other inmates testified at Spisak's sentencing hearing that Spisak victimized them in a similar manner. Spisak was sentenced to 32 months in federal prison on June 28, 2012. He is currently being held at the Federal Correctional Institution, Texarkana, a low-security facility in Texas, and is scheduled for release in October 2014.[tpl]cite web|last=Hanson|first=Tony|title=Former Guard Sentenced To Prison For Assaulting Inmates|url=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2012/06/29/former-guard-sentenced-to-prison-for-assaulting-inmates/|publisher=CBS Philly|accessdate=28 October 2013|date=June 29, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=FORMER PRISON GUARD SENTENCED FOR FORCING SEX ON AN INMATE|url=http://www.justice.gov/oig/press/2012/2012_06_28.pdf|publisher=US Department of Justice|accessdate=28 October 2013|date=June 28, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Inmate Locator - Richard Spisak|url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&needingMoreList=false&FirstName=richard&Middle=&LastName=spisak&Race=U&Sex=U&Age=&x=0&y=0|publisher=Federal Bureau of Prisons|accessdate=28 October 2013[/tpl]
