"Omaha" the Cat Dancer is an erotic comic strip and later comic book created by artist Reed Waller and writer Kate Worley. Set in the fictional Mipple City, Minnesota (a pastiche of Minneapolis derived from its one-time postal abbreviation of MPLS) in a universe populated by anthropomorphic funny animal characters, the strip is a soap opera focusing on Omaha, a feline exotic dancer, and her lover, Chuck, the son of a business tycoon.
The strip debuted in the funny animal magazine Vootie, and a number of underground comix in the late 1970s and early 1980s. "Omaha" the Cat Dancer became the subject of the eponymous comic book series published from 1984 to 1993 by Kitchen Sink Press; it was relaunched by Fantagraphics Books through 1995. The final chapters of the strip's storyline were published in Sizzle magazine, beginning in 2006.
"Omaha" the Cat Dancer was the first of several comic books published in the early 1980s which integrated explicit sex into their storylines, rather than utilizing sex for shock value. The comic was the subject of a number of obscenity controversies, and was nominated for multiple Eisner Awards in 1989 and 1991.

==Publication history==

In 1976, Reed Waller founded Vootie, a fanzine intended to promote funny animal comics. He began developing the concept for "Omaha" the Cat Dancer after one of the magazine's contributors said that there was not enough sex in the genre. Inspired by Robert Crumb's Fritz the Cat,[tpl]cite book |last1=Skinn |first1=Dez |title=Comix: The Underground Revolution |year=2004 |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |page=71 |chapter=Can't Get Enuff |isbn=1-56025-572-2[/tpl] Waller began looking for a theme for his new comic. He visited local strip clubs in St. Paul with his sketchbook, and read newspaper articles about attempts to shut the bars down. Another contributor to the magazine, Jim Schumeister, proposed a comic called Charlie's Bimbos, in which "a bevy of strippers champion liberty in the face of Puritan oppression". This proposal sparked the idea for Omaha.
The character debuted in The Adventures of Omaha, which was published in Vootie in 1978. The first chapter of "Omaha" the Cat Dancer was published by Kitchen Sink Press in Bizarre Sex #9 in 1981. A five page untitled story appeared in Bizarre Sex #10 in 1982, as a followup to the first chapter. In 1983, a one-page parody strip starring Omaha, titled "Hotsizz Twonkies", was published in E-Man #5 by First Comics. Another five page untitled story, identified as "Shelly and Omaha" in The Collected Omaha Volume 1, appeared in Dope Comix #5; it was reprinted in Bizarre Sex Series #5. In 1991, the Omaha story "A Strip in Time" appeared in Munden's Bar Annual #2, published by First Comics.
In 1984, SteelDragon Press published the first issue of "Omaha" the Cat Dancer, which featured the second chapter of the story. Waller then was unable to continue with the story. The third chapter was completed with help from Kate Worley, who continued to write the series thereafter. In August 1988, Worley was injured in a car accident; the series' frequency slowed as a result of her recovery process.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.omahathecatdancer.com/omaha_history.htm |title=History of Omaha the Cat Dancer |publisher=CatDancer Corporation |accessdate=4 June 2010[/tpl] In November 1991, Waller was diagnosed with colon cancer; two issues of Images of "Omaha" were published in 1992 to pay for Waller's medical expenses, featuring art and writing by several major comic creators. In 1995, Waller and Worley ceased production of the series.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.omahathecatdancer.com/reed_waller.htm |title=Biography of Reed Waller |publisher=CatDancer Corporation |accessdate=4 June 2010[/tpl] In 2002, Waller and Worley agreed to complete the story; Worley was diagnosed with lung cancer, and began chemotherapy and radiation treatments in that year. On June 6, 2004, Worley died before completing the story; her husband, James Vance began to edit and complete the final chapters.
The series lasted 19 issues before being cancelled in 1993. Fantagraphics Books later relaunched the series, but it only lasted four issues, the last published in 1995. In 1994, Rob, a supporting character from the series, appeared in Gay Comix #22. The final chapters of the story were serialized in Sizzle, beginning in 2006.
From 1987 until 1998, Kitchen Sink, and later Fantagraphics, published six volumes of the Omaha strips under the title The Collected "Omaha" the Cat Dancer.[tpl]cite book |last1=Waller |first1=Reed |last2=Worley |first2=Kate |title=The Collected "Omaha" the Cat Dancer |year=1995 |publisher=Fantagraphics Books |isbn=978-1-56097-161-0 [/tpl] From 2005 to 2013, NBM Publishing imprint Amerotica published eight volumes of strips under the title The Complete Omaha the Cat Dancer.[tpl]cite book |last1=Waller |first1=Reed |last2=Worley |first2=Kate |title=The Complete Omaha the Cat Dancer |volume=1 |date = October 2005|publisher=Amerotica |isbn=1-56163-451-4 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1=Waller |first1=Reed |last2=Worley |first2=Kate |title=The Complete Omaha the Cat Dancer |volume=2 |date = January 2006|publisher=Amerotica |isbn=1-56163-457-3 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1=Waller |first1=Reed |last2=Worley |first2=Kate |title=The Complete Omaha the Cat Dancer |volume=3 |date = April 2006|publisher=Amerotica |isbn=1-56163-474-3 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1=Waller |first1=Reed |last2=Worley |first2=Kate |title=The Complete Omaha the Cat Dancer |volume=4 |date = July 2006|publisher=Amerotica |isbn=1-56163-478-6 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1=Waller |first1=Reed |last2=Worley |first2=Kate |title=The Complete Omaha the Cat Dancer |volume=5 |date = October 2006|publisher=Amerotica |isbn=1-56163-490-5 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1=Waller |first1=Reed |last2=Worley |first2=Kate |title=The Complete Omaha the Cat Dancer |volume=6 |date=April 5, 2007 |publisher=Amerotica |isbn=1-56163-505-7 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1=Waller |first1=Reed |last2=Worley |first2=Kate |title=The Complete Omaha the Cat Dancer |volume=7 |date = March 2008|publisher=Amerotica |isbn=1-56163-527-8 [/tpl][tpl]cite book |last1=Waller |first1=Reed |last2=Worley |first2=Kate |last3=Vance |first3=James |title=The Complete Omaha the Cat Dancer |volume=8 |date = September 2013|publisher=Amerotica |isbn=1-56163-754-8 [/tpl]

==Cultural impact==

"Omaha" the Cat Dancer was the first of several comic books in the early 1980s which integrated sex into their storylines, rather than utilizing sexual explicitness for shock value.[tpl]cite book |last1=Sabin |first1=Roger |title=Comics, Comix & Graphic Novels: A History Of Comic Art |trans_title= |year=1996 |publisher=Phaidon Press |location=London, United Kingdom |isbn=0-7148-3008-9 |pages=177–78; 182; 188; 200; 208–209 |chapter=Alternative Visions [/tpl] In 1988, Friendly Frank's, a comic book store in suburban Chicago, was fined $750 for selling "obscene" material, including "Omaha" the Cat Dancer; as a result of the obscenity controversy, the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund was formed.[tpl]cite journal |last1= |first1= |title=Comics |journal=Spin |volume=4 |issue=5 |page=50 |issn=08863032 |accessdate=4 June 2010[/tpl] In 1990, issues of "Omaha" the Cat Dancer were seized by New Zealand authorities; the country's Obscene Publications Tribunal declared that the series was not indecent. In the same year, police in Toronto seized issues of the comic, claiming that it depicted bestiality.
In Graphic Novels: A Bibliographic Guide to Book-Length Comics, D. Aviva Rothschild praised the series, writing "the plot is always strong, and the characters are always three-dimensional and appealing."[tpl]cite book |last1=Rothschild |first1=D. Aviva |title=Graphic Novels: A Bibliographic Guide to Book-Length Comics |year=1995 |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=1-56308-086-9 |pages=110–111 |chapter=Funny Animals [/tpl] Entertainment Weekly writer Alex Heard panned the comic, writing that "The story moves very slowly ... one can readily agree with the disgruntled fan who wrote, 'My God! Where did you dredge up those horrid characters?'"
In 1992, Kitchen Sink published two volumes of Images of "Omaha" as a benefit to pay for the treatment of Waller's bowel cancer. The volumes featured contributions by major comic book artists, such as Dave Sim, Alan Moore and Frank Miller. Trina Robbins, James Vance and Neil Gaiman have provided introductions to collected editions of the series. "Omaha" the Cat Dancer was nominated for Eisner Awards for Best Continuing Series, Best Black-and-White Series, and Best Writer/Artist in 1989; in 1991, the series received Eisner Awards for Best Black and White Series and Best Writer.
