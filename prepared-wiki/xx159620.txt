The Coorong District Council is a local government area located between the River Murray and the western Limestone Coast in South Australia. The district cover mostly rural areas with small townships, as well as the Coorong National Park. 
The council was formed in 1995, when the District Council of Coonalpyn Downs amalgamated with the Peake District Council and Meningie District Council to form the Coorong District Council. It is geographically the largest council area in South Australia. 
The economy of the district is based mostly around agriculture.

Agriculture is prominent in the district, with grain crops the predominant land use. Due to improvement of grain crops in the area, district grain storage near Tailem Bend now holds up to 236 000 tonnes, after a large expansion in 1999.[ref]

The region has a well established dairy industry, as well as various other livestock. Olives have been found to suit the climate and soil of the area and may be a potential industry in the future. 
The council purchased the old Mitsubishi Car Test Track property at the junction of the Dukes and Mallee Highways, and has leased the park out to enable South Australia's newest motorsport venue with Tailem Bend Motorsport Park Pty Ltd announcing that it is now holding activities and events and accepting bookings. The Tailem Bend Motorsport Park is a new multi sport motorsport park. Motorcycling SA and the Sporting Car Club of SA have joined forces to establish the park under the auspices of CAMS and Motorcycling Australia.
