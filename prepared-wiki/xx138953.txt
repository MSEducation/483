[[Cryptophthalmos]]

CATEGORIES: Congenital disorders of eyes

Cryptophthalmos is a rare congenital anomaly in which the skin is continuous over the eyeball with absence of eyelids. It is classified into three types: complete, incomplete and abortive. Failure of eyelid separation can be associated with maldevelopment of the underlying cornea and microphthalmia. Cryptophthalmos usually occurs on both sides and occurs in association with other multiple malformations collectively referred to as Fraser syndrome.
