Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian peninsula around 35,000 years ago. It came under Roman rule around 200 BCE, after which the region was named Hispania. In the Middle Ages it was conquered by Germanic tribes and later by the Moors to the south. Spain emerged as a unified country in the 15th century, following the marriage of the Catholic Monarchs and the completion of the centuries-long reconquest, or Reconquista, of the peninsula from the Moors in 1492. Spain became an influential global empire in the early modern period, being one of the first countries to colonize the New World and leaving a legacy of over 500 million Spanish speakers today, making it the world's second most spoken first language.
Spain is a democracy organised in the form of a parliamentary government under a constitutional monarchy. It is a  developed country with the 13th largest economy in the world. It is a member of the United Nations, NATO, OECD, and WTO.

==Etymology==

The origins of the Roman name Hispania, from which the modern name España was derived, are uncertain and are possibly unknown due to inadequate evidence. Down the centuries there have been a number of accounts and hypothesis:
The Renaissance scholar Antonio de Nebrija proposed that the word Hispania evolved from the Iberian word Hispalis, meaning "city of the western world". Jesús Luis Cunchillos argues that the root of the term span is the Phoenecian word spy, meaning "to forge metals". Therefore i-spn-ya would mean "the land where metals are forged".# ↑ Linch, John (director), Fernández Castro, María Cruz (del segundo tomo), Historia de España, El País, volumen II, La península Ibérica en época prerromana, pg. 40. Dossier. La etimología de España; ¿tierra de conejos?, ISBN 978-84-9815-764-2
Hispania may derive from the poetic use of the term Hesperia, reflecting the Greek perception of Italy as a "western land" or "land of the setting sun" (Hesperia, Ἑσπερία in Greek) and Spain, being still further west, as Hesperia ultima.
It may be a derivation of the Punic I-Shpania (אי שפניא), meaning "island of rabbits", "land of rabbits" or "edge", a reference to Spain's location at the end of the Mediterranean; Roman coins struck in the region from the reign of Hadrian show a female figure with a coney at her feet, and Strabo called it the "land of the rabbits".[tpl]CathEncy|wstitle=Spain[/tpl]
There is the claim that "Hispania" derives from the Basque word Ezpanna meaning "edge" or "border", another reference to the fact that the Iberian peninsula constitutes the southwest corner of the European continent.
Two 15th century Spanish Jewish scholars, Don Isaac Abrabanel and Shelomó ibn Verga, gave an  explanation now considered folkloric. Both men wrote in two different published works  that the first Jews to reach Spain were brought by ship by Phiros who was confederate with the king of Babylon when he laid siege to Jerusalem. This man was a Grecian by birth, but who had been given a kingdom in Spain. He became related by marriage to Espan, the nephew of king Heracles, who also ruled over a kingdom in Spain. Heracles later renounced his throne in preference for his native Greece, leaving his kingdom to his nephew, Espan, from whom the country of España (Spain) took its name. Based upon their testimonies, this eponym would have already been in use in Spain by c. 350 BCE.Abrabanel, Commentary on the First Prophets (Pirush Al Nevi'im Rishonim), end of II Kings, pp. 680-681, Jerusalem 1955 (Hebrew). See also Shelomó ibn Verga, Shevet Yehudah, pp. 6b-7a, Lemberg 1846 (Hebrew)

==History==

Iberia enters written records as a land populated largely by the Iberians, Basques and Celts. After an arduous conquest, the peninsula came under the rule of Rome. During the early Middle Ages it came under Germanic rule but later, much of it was conquered by Moorish invaders from North Africa. In a process that took centuries, the small Christian kingdoms in the north gradually regained control of the peninsula. The last Moorish kingdom fell in the same year Columbus reached the Americas. A global empire began which saw Spain become the strongest kingdom in Europe, the leading world power for a century and a half, and the largest overseas empire for three centuries.
Continued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status. The Napoleonic invasions of Spain led to chaos, triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable. Prior to the Second World War, Spain suffered a devastating civil war and came under the rule of an authoritarian government, whose rule oversaw a period of stagnation but that finished with a powerful economic surge. Eventually democracy was peacefully restored in the form of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. Spain joined the European Union, experiencing a cultural renaissance and steady economic growth.
Spain also hosts one of the largest festivals in the world. The Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, which attracts up to a million tourists for the July week long celebration.

===Prehistory and pre-Roman peoples===

Archaeological research at Atapuerca indicates the Iberian Peninsula was populated by hominids 1.2 million years ago.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6256356.stm|title='First west Europe tooth' found|publisher=BBC|date=30 June 2007|accessdate=9 August 2008[/tpl] Modern humans first arrived in Iberia, from the north on foot, about 35,000 years ago.Typical Aurignacian items were found in Cantabria (Morín, El Pendo, El Castillo), the Basque Country (Santimamiñe) and Catalonia. The radiocarbon datations give the following dates: 32,425 and 29,515 BP. The best known artifacts of these prehistoric human settlements are the famous paintings in the Altamira cave of Cantabria in northern Iberia, which were created from 35,600 to 13,500 BCE by cro-magnon or, perhaps, by neanderthals.[tpl]cite journal|last=Bernaldo de Quirós Guidolti|first=Federico|last2=Cabrera Valdés|first2=Victoria|journal=Complutum|volume=5|year=1994|title= Cronología del arte paleolítico|url= http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=164330&orden=1&info=link|accessdate=17 November 2012|issn= 1131-6993|pages= 265–276|format= PDF|ref=harv[/tpl] Archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the Iberian Peninsula acted as one of several major refugia from which northern Europe was repopulated following the end of the last ice age.
The two main historical peoples of the peninsula were the Iberians and the Celts. The Iberians inhabited the Mediterranean side from the northeast to the southeast. The Celts inhabited the Atlantic side, in the north, center (Celtiberian), northwest and southwest part of the peninsula. Basques occupied the western area of the Pyrenees mountain range and adjacent areas.
In the south of the peninsula appeared the semi-mythical city of Tartessos (c. 1100 BCE), whose flourishing trade in items made of gold and silver with the Phoenicians and Greeks is documented by Strabo and the Book of Solomon. Between about 800 BCE and 300 BCE, the seafaring Phoenicians and Greeks founded trading colonies along the Mediterranean coast. The Carthaginians briefly exerted control over much of the Mediterranean side of the peninsula, until defeated in the Punic Wars by the Romans.

===Roman Empire and the Gothic Kingdom===

During the Second Punic War, an expanding Roman Republic captured Carthaginian trading colonies along the Mediterranean coast from roughly 210 to 205 BCE. It took the Romans nearly two centuries to complete the conquest of the Iberian peninsula, though they had control of it for over six centuries. Roman rule was bound together by law, language, and the Roman road.[tpl]cite web |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. | title = A History of Spain and Portugal; Ch. 1 Ancient Hispania |publisher=The Library of Iberian Resources Online |year=1973 |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/spainport1.htm |accessdate=9 August 2008[/tpl]
The cultures of the Celtic and Iberian populations were gradually romanised (Latinised) at differing rates in different parts of Hispania. Local leaders were admitted into the Roman aristocratic class[tpl]efn|The latifundia (sing., latifundium), large estates controlled by the aristocracy, were superimposed on the existing Iberian landholding system.[/tpl][tpl]cite web |last=Rinehart |first=Robert |last2=Seeley|first2=Jo Ann Browning | title = A Country Study: Spain – Hispania |publisher=Library of Congress Country Series |year=1998 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+es0014)|accessdate=9 August 2008[/tpl] Hispania served as a granary for the Roman market, and its harbours exported gold, wool, olive oil, and wine. Agricultural production increased with the introduction of irrigation projects, some of which remain in use. Emperors Hadrian, Trajan, Theodosius I, and the philosopher Seneca were born in Hispania.[tpl]efn|The poets Martial, Quintilian and Lucan were also born in Hispania.[/tpl] Christianity was introduced into Hispania in the 1st century CE and it became popular in the cities in the 2nd century CE. Most of Spain's present languages and religion, and the basis of its laws, originate from this period.
The weakening of the Western Roman Empire's jurisdiction in Hispania began in 409, when the Germanic Suebi and Vandals, together with the Sarmatian Alans crossed the Rhine and ravaged Gaul until the Visigoths drove them into Iberia that same year. The Suebi established a kingdom in what is today modern Galicia and northern Portugal. As the western empire disintegrated, the social and economic base became greatly simplified: but even in modified form, the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire, including Christianity.
The Alans' allies, the Hasdingi Vandals, established a kingdom in Gallaecia, too, occupying largely the same region but extending farther south to the Duero river. The Silingi Vandals occupied the region that still bears a form of their name –Vandalusia, modern Andalusia, in Spain. The Byzantines established an enclave, Spania, in the south, with the intention of reviving the Roman empire throughout Iberia. Eventually, however, Hispania was reunited under Visigothic rule.
Isidore of Seville, archbishop of Seville, was an influential philosopher and very studied in the Middle Ages in Europe. Also his theories were vital to the conversion of the Visigothic Kingdom to a catholic one, in the Councils of Toledo. This gothic kingdom was the first Christian kingdom ruling in the Iberian Peninsula, and in the Reconquista it was the referent for the different kingdoms fighting against the Muslim rule.

===Middle Ages===

In the 8th century, nearly all of the Iberian Peninsula was conquered (711–718) by largely Moorish Muslim armies from North Africa. These conquests were part of the expansion of the Umayyad Caliphate. Only a small area in the mountainous north-west of the peninsula managed to resist the initial invasion.
Under Islamic law, Christians and Jews were given the subordinate status of dhimmi. This status permitted Christians and Jews to practice their religions as people of the book but they were required to pay a special tax and had legal and social rights inferior to those of Muslims.[tpl]cite book|author=H.

Conversion to Islam proceeded at a steadily increasing pace. The muladíes (Muslims of ethnic Iberian origin) are believed to have comprised the majority of the population of Al-Andalus by the end of the 10th century.Islamic and Christian Spain in the Early Middle Ages. Chapter 5: Ethnic Relations, Thomas F. Glick[tpl]cite web |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. | title = A History of Spain and Portugal; Ch. 2 Al-Andalus |publisher=The Library of Iberian Resources Online |year=1973 |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/spainport1.htm |accessdate=9 August 2008[/tpl]
The Muslim community in the Iberian peninsula was itself diverse and beset by social tensions. The Berber people of North Africa, who had provided the bulk of the invading armies, clashed with the Arab leadership from the Middle East.[tpl]efn|The Berbers soon gave up attempting to settle the harsh lands in the north of the Meseta Central handed to them by the Arab rulers.[/tpl] Over time, large Moorish populations became established, especially in the Guadalquivir River valley, the coastal plain of Valencia, the Ebro River valley and (towards the end of this period) in the mountainous region of Granada.
Córdoba, the capital of the caliphate, was the largest, richest and most sophisticated city in western Europe. Mediterranean trade and cultural exchange flourished. Muslims imported a rich intellectual tradition from the Middle East and North Africa. Muslim and Jewish scholars played an important part in reviving and expanding classical Greek learning in Western Europe. Two important philosophers for the time are Averroes and Maimonides. The Romanised cultures of the Iberian peninsula interacted with Muslim and Jewish cultures in complex ways, thus giving the region a distinctive culture. Outside the cities, where the vast majority lived, the land ownership system from Roman times remained largely intact as Muslim leaders rarely dispossessed landowners, and the introduction of new crops and techniques led to an expansion of agriculture.
In the 11th century, the Muslim holdings fractured into rival Taifa kingdoms, allowing the small Christian states the opportunity to greatly enlarge their territories. The arrival from North Africa of the Islamic ruling sects of the Almoravids and the Almohads restored unity upon the Muslim holdings, with a stricter, less tolerant application of Islam, and saw a revival in Muslim fortunes. This re-united Islamic state experienced more than a century of successes that partially reversed Christian gains.
The Reconquista ("Reconquest") was the centuries-long period in which Christian rule was re-established over the Iberian Peninsula. The Reconquista is viewed as beginning with the Battle of Covadonga in 722, and was concurrent with the period of Muslim rule on the Iberian peninsula. The Christian army's victory over Muslim forces led to the creation of the Christian Kingdom of Asturias along the northwestern coastal mountains. Shortly after, in 739, Muslim forces were driven from Galicia, which was to eventually host one of medieval Europe's holiest sites, Santiago de Compostela and was incorporated into the new Christian kingdom.
Muslim armies had also moved north of the Pyrenees, but they were defeated by Frankish forces at the Battle of Poitiers, Frankia. Later, Frankish forces established Christian counties on the southern side of the Pyrenees. These areas were to grow into the kingdoms of Navarre, Aragon and Catalonia.[tpl]cite web |last=Rinehart |first=Robert |last2=Seeley|first2=Jo Ann Browning | title = A Country Study: Spain – Castile and Aragon |publisher=Library of Congress Country Series |year=1998 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+es0016) |accessdate=9 August 2008[/tpl] For several centuries, the fluctuating frontier between the Muslim and Christian controlled areas of Iberia was along the Ebro and Duero valleys.
The breakup of Al-Andalus into the competing taifa kingdoms helped the long embattled Iberian Christian kingdoms gain the initiative. The capture of the strategically central city of Toledo in 1085 marked a significant shift in the balance of power in favour of the Christian kingdoms. Following a great Muslim resurgence in the 12th century, the great Moorish strongholds in the south fell to Christian Spain in the 13th century—Córdoba in 1236 and Seville in 1248—leaving only the Muslim enclave of Granada as a tributary state in the south.[tpl]cite web|url=http://libro.uca.edu/rc/rc1.htm|title=Ransoming Captives in Crusader Spain: The Order of Merced on the Christian-Islamic Frontier|accessdate=13 August 2008[/tpl] See also: [tpl]cite web |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. | title = A History of Spain and Portugal; Ch. 4 Castile-León in the Era of the Great Reconquest |publisher=The Library of Iberian Resources Online |year=1973 |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/spainport1.htm |accessdate=9 August 2008[/tpl]
In this period literature and philosophy started to flourish again in the Christian peninsular kingdoms, based on Roman and gothic traditions. An important philosopher from this time is Ramon Llull. The king Alfonso X of Castile focused on the strengthen of this Roman and gothic past, linking also the Iberian Christian kingdoms with the rest of medieval European Christendom. He worked for being elected emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Spanish language, as well as the other Spanish languages coming from Latin started to develop, and first grammars were published (Cantar de Mio Cid and Antonio de Nebrija).
The kings, emulating Roman law and institutions, wanted more authoritarian regimes, fighting for power against the nobility. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the Marinid Muslim sect based in North Africa invaded and established some enclaves on the southern coast but failed in their attempt to re-establish Muslim rule in Iberia and were soon driven out. The 13th century also witnessed the Crown of Aragon, centred in Spain's north east, expand its reach across islands in the Mediterranean, to Sicily and even Athens.[tpl]cite web |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. | title = A History of Spain and Portugal; Ch. 5 The Rise of Aragón-Catalonia |publisher=The Library of Iberian Resources Online |year=1973 |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/spainport1.htm |accessdate=9 August 2008[/tpl] Around this time the universities of Palencia (1212/1263) and Salamanca (1218/1254) were established.

In 1469, the crowns of the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon were united by the marriage of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon. 1478 commenced the completion of the conquest of the Canary Islands and in 1492, the combined forces of Castile and Aragon captured the Emirate of Granada, ending the last remnant of a 781-year presence of Islamic rule in Iberia.
That same year, Spain's Jews were ordered to convert to Catholicism or face expulsion from Spanish territories during the Spanish Inquisition.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16200-spanish-inquisition-left-genetic-legacy-in-iberia.html |title=Spanish Inquisition left genetic legacy in Iberia |publisher=Newscientist.com |date=4 December 2008 |accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl]

===Imperial Spain===

The year 1492 also marked the arrival in the New World of Christopher Columbus, during a voyage funded by Isabella. Although Christopher Columbus did make it to the Central American islands he never did discover the continent itself, whilst believing himself to be in the heart of the Orient.
As Renaissance New Monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand centralised royal power at the expense of local nobility, and the word España, whose root is the ancient name Hispania, began to be commonly used to designate the whole of the two kingdoms.
With their wide-ranging political, legal, religious and military reforms, Spain emerged as the first world power.
The unification of the crowns of Aragon and Castile by the marriage of their sovereigns laid the basis for modern Spain and the Spanish Empire, although each kingdom of Spain remained a separate country, in social, political, laws, currency and language.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/eurvoya/Imperial.html|title=Imperial Spain|accessdate=13 August 2008|publisher=University of Calgary[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Y84wAgaXxo4C&lpg=PA472&dq=unification%20of%20the%20crowns%20of%20Aragon%20and%20Castile&pg=PA472#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Handbook of European History |publisher=Books.google.es |date= |accessdate=26 April 2013|isbn=9004097600|year=1994[/tpl]
Spain was Europe's leading power throughout the 16th century and most of the 17th century, a position reinforced by trade and wealth from colonial possessions. It reached its apogee during the reigns of the first two Spanish Habsburgs – Charles I (1516–1556) and Philip II (1556–1598). This period saw the Italian Wars, the revolt of the comuneros, the Dutch revolt, the Morisco revolt, clashes with the Ottomans, the Anglo-Spanish war and wars with France.[tpl]cite web |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. | title = A History of Spain and Portugal; Ch. 13 The Spanish Empire|publisher=The Library of Iberian Resources Online |year=1973 |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/spainport1.htm |accessdate=9 August 2008[/tpl]
The Spanish Empire expanded to include great parts of the Americas, islands in the Asia-Pacific area, areas of Italy, cities in Northern Africa, as well as parts of what are now France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. It was the first empire of which it was said that the sun never set.
This was an age of discovery, with daring explorations by sea and by land, the opening-up of new trade routes across oceans, conquests and the beginnings of European colonialism. Along with the arrival of precious metals, spices, luxuries, and new agricultural plants, Spanish explorers brought back knowledge from the New World, and played a leading part in transforming the European understanding of the globe.[tpl]Cite book |last=Thomas |first=Hugh |authorlink=Hugh Thomas (writer) | title = Rivers of gold: the rise of the Spanish Empire |publisher=George Weidenfeld & Nicholson |year=2003 |location=London |pages=passim|isbn=978-0-297-64563-4[/tpl] The cultural efflorescence witnessed is now referred to as the Spanish Golden Age. The rise of humanism, the Protestant Reformation and new geographical discoveries raised issues addressed by the influential intellectual movement now known as the School of Salamanca.
In the late 16th century and first half of the 17th century, Spain was confronted by unrelenting challenges from all sides. Barbary pirates, under the aegis of the rapidly growing Ottoman Empire, disrupted life in many coastal areas through their slave raids and renewed the threat of an Islamic invasion.According to Robert Davis between 1 million and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by North African Muslim pirates and sold as slaves during the 16th and 17th centuries. This was at a time when Spain was often at war with France.
The Protestant Reformation schism from the Catholic Church dragged the kingdom ever more deeply into the mire of religiously charged wars. The result was a country forced into ever expanding military efforts across Europe and in the Mediterranean.[tpl]cite web|url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne15.htm|title=The Seventeenth-Century Decline|accessdate=13 August 2008|publisher=The Library of Iberian resources online[/tpl]
The Black Legend or anti-Spanish propaganda was started in the 16th century when Spain was at its height of political power, by propagandists from rival European powers, namely the Protestant countries of England and the Netherlands, as a means to morally disqualify the country and its Spanish people. The Black Legend particularly exaggerates the extent of the activities of the Inquisition, or the treatment of American indigenous subjects in the territories of the Spanish Empire, and non-Catholics such as Protestants and Jews in its European territories.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/67986/Black-Legend |title=Encyclopædia Britannica entry "Black Legend" |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=26 April 2013[/tpl]M.

By the middle decades of a war and plague-ridden 17th-century Europe, the Spanish Habsburgs had enmeshed the country in continent-wide religious-political conflicts. These conflicts drained it of resources and undermined the economy generally. Spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered Habsburg empire, and help the imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire reverse a large part of the advances made by Protestant forces, but it was finally forced to recognise the separation of Portugal (with whom it had been united in a personal union of the crowns from 1580 to 1640) and the Netherlands, and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to France in the latter stages of the immensely destructive, Europe-wide Thirty Years War.[tpl]cite web |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. | title = A History of Spain and Portugal; Ch. 14 Spanish Society and Economics in the Imperial Age |publisher=The Library of Iberian Resources Online |year=1973 |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/spainport1.htm |accessdate=9 August 2008[/tpl]
In the latter half of the 17th century, Spain went into a gradual decline, during which it surrendered several small territories to France and the Netherlands; however, it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire, which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century.
The decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne which consumed the first years of the 18th century. The War of Spanish Succession was a wide-ranging international conflict combined with a civil war, and was to cost the kingdom its European possessions and its position as one of the leading powers on the Continent.[tpl]cite web |last=Rinehart |first=Robert|last2=Seeley|first2=Jo Ann Browning | title = A Country Study: Spain – Spain in Decline |publisher=Library of Congress Country Series |year=1998 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html |accessdate=9 August 2008[/tpl]
During this war, a new dynasty originating in France, the Bourbons, was installed. Long united only by the Crown, a true Spanish state was established when the first Bourbon king, Philip V, united the crowns of Castile and Aragon into a single state, abolishing many of the old regional privileges and laws.[tpl]cite web |last=Rinehart |first=Robert |last2=Seeley|first2=Jo Ann Browning | title = A Country Study: Spain – Bourbon Spain |publisher=Library of Congress Country Series |year=1998 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html |accessdate=9 August 2008[/tpl]
The 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the empire. The new Bourbon monarchy drew on the French system of modernising the administration and the economy. Enlightenment ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdom's elite and monarchy. Military assistance for the rebellious British colonies in the American War of Independence improved the kingdom's international standing.[tpl]cite web |last=Gascoigne |first=Bamber | title = History of Spain: Bourbon dynasty: from AD 1700 |publisher=Library of Congress Country Series |year=1998 |url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?HistoryID=ab50&ParagraphID=iss#iss |accessdate=9 August 2008[/tpl]

===Liberalism and nation-state===

In 1793, Spain went to war against the revolutionary new French Republic as a member of the Coalition. The war polarised the country in a reaction against the gallicised elites. Defeated in the field, peace was made with France in 1795. In 1807, a secret treaty between Napoleon and the unpopular prime minister led to a declaration of war against Britain and Portugal. Napoleon's troops entered the country to invade Portugal but instead occupied Spain's major fortresses. The ridiculed Spanish king abdicated in favour of Napoleon's brother, Joseph Bonaparte.
Joseph Bonaparte was seen as a puppet monarch and was regarded with scorn by the Spanish. The 2 May 1808 revolt was one of many nationalist uprisings across the country against the Bonapartist regime.David A. Bell. "Napoleon's Total War". TheHistoryNet.com These revolts marked the beginning of a devastating war of independence against the Napoleonic regime.(Gates 2001, p.20) Napoleon was forced to intervene personally, defeating several Spanish armies and forcing a British army to retreat. However, further military action by Spanish armies, guerrillas and Wellington's British-Portuguese forces, combined with Napoleon's disastrous invasion of Russia, led to the ousting of the French imperial armies from the Spain in 1814, and the return of King Ferdinand VII.(Gates 2001, p.467)
During the war, in 1810, a revolutionary body, the Cortes of Cádiz, was assembled to co-ordinate the effort against the Bonapartist regime and to prepare a constitution.Diccionario de Historia de España. Jaime Alvar Ezquerra.2003 Cortes of Cádiz (1812) was the first parliament of Spain with sovereign power It met as one body, and its members represented the entire Spanish empire.[tpl]cite book|last=Rodriguez|title=Independence of Spanish America|publisher=Cambridge University Press[/tpl] https://www.google.es/search?tbm=bks&hl=es&q=%22It+met+as+one+body%2C+and+its+members+represented+the+entire+Spanish+world%22&btnG= citation: "It met as one body, and its members represented the entire Spanish world" In 1812 a constitution for universal representation under a constitutional monarchy was declared but after the fall of the Bonapartist regime Ferdinand VII dismissed the Cortes Generales and was determined to rule as an absolute monarch. These events foreshadowed the conflict between conservatives and liberals in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
Anti-liberal forces known as carlists fought against liberals in the Carlist Wars. Liberal forces won, but the conflict between progressive and conservative liberals ended in a weak early constitutional period. After the Glorious Revolution and the short First Spanish Republic, a more stable monarquic peryod came alongside with a bipartidism between progressive and conservative liberals.
The Napoleonic war left Spain economically ruined, deeply divided and politically unstable. In the chaos, Spain's American colonies declared independence, leading to wars of independence that ended Spanish control of its mainland colonies in the Americas. The Constitution of 1812 was considered too liberal by conservatives in the colonies and precipitated the decision of many to join the effort for independence. King Ferdinand VII's attempt to re-assert control proved futile as it faced opposition not only in the colonies but also in Spain and led to army revolts led by liberal officers. By the end of 1826, the only American colonies Spain held were Cuba and Puerto Rico.
In the instability and economic crisis that afflicted Spain in the 19th century there arose nationalist movements in the Philippines and Cuba. Wars of independence ensued in those colonies and eventually the United States became involved. The war fought in the spring of 1898 did not last long. El Desastre (the Disaster), as the war became known in Spain, gave added impetus to the Generation of 98 who were conducting an analysis of the country.
Although the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity, the 20th century brought little peace; Spain played a minor part in the scramble for Africa, with the colonisation of Western Sahara, Spanish Morocco and Equatorial Guinea. It remained neutral during World War I (see Spain in World War I). The heavy losses suffered during the Rif war in Morocco brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy.
A period of authoritarian rule under General Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923–1931) ended with the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic. The Republic offered political autonomy to the Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia and gave voting rights to women and was increasingly dominated by left wing radicals. In the worsening economic situation of the Great Depression, Spanish politics became increasingly radicalized and violent.

===Spanish Civil War and dictatorship===

The Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936. For three years the Nationalist forces led by General Francisco Franco and supported by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy fought the Republican side, which was supported by the Soviet Union, Mexico and International Brigades but it was not supported by the Western powers due to the British-led policy of Non-Intervention. In 1939, General Franco emerged victorious and became dictator.
The civil war was viciously fought and there were many atrocities committed by all sides. The war claimed the lives of over 500,000 people and caused the flight of up to a half-million citizens from the country.Spanish Civil War fighters look back, BBC News, 23 February 2003[tpl]cite news|author=|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/3998443/Relatives-of-Spaniards-who-fled-Franco-granted-citizenship.html |title=Relatives of Spaniards who fled Franco granted citizenship |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=28 December 2008 |accessdate=18 January 2014 |location=London[/tpl]
The state as established under Francisco Franco was nominally neutral in the Second World War, although sympathetic to the Axis. The only legal party under Franco's post civil war regime was the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS, formed in 1937; the party emphasised anti-Communism, Catholicism and nationalism. Given Franco's opposition to competing political parties, the party was renamed the National Movement (Movimiento Nacional) in 1949.
After World War II Spain was politically and economically isolated, and was kept out of the United Nations. This changed in 1955, during the Cold War period, when it became strategically important for the U.S. to establish a military presence on the Iberian peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the Soviet Union into the Mediterranean basin. In the 1960s, Spain registered an unprecedented rate of economic growth in what became known as the Spanish miracle, which resumed the much interrupted transition towards a modern economy.

===Democratic restoration===

With Franco's death in November 1975, Juan Carlos succeeded to the position of King of Spain and head of state in accordance with the law. With the approval of the new Spanish Constitution of 1978 and the restoration of democracy, the State devolved much authority to the regions and created an internal organisation based on autonomous communities.
In the Basque Country, moderate Basque nationalism has coexisted with a radical nationalist movement led by the armed organisation ETA. The group was formed in 1959 during Franco's rule but has continued to wage its violent campaign even after the restoration of democracy and the return of a large measure of regional autonomy.
On 23 February 1981, rebel elements among the security forces seized the Cortes in an attempt to impose a military backed government. King Juan Carlos took personal command of the military and successfully ordered the coup plotters, via national television, to surrender.
During the 1980s the democratic restoration made possible a growing open society. New cultural movements based on freedom appeared, like La Movida Madrileña. On 30 May 1982 Spain joined NATO, following a referendum. That year the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) came to power, the first left-wing government in 43 years. In 1986 Spain joined the European Community, which later became the European Union. The PSOE was replaced in government by the Partido Popular (PP) after the latter won the 1996 General Elections; at that point the PSOE had served almost 14 consecutive years in office.
On 1 January 2002, Spain ceased to use the peseta as currency replacing it with the euro, which it shares with 16 other countries in the Eurozone.
Spain has also seen strong economic growth, well above the EU average; however, well publicised concerns issued by many economic commentators at the height of the boom that the extraordinary property prices and high foreign trade deficits of the boom were likely to lead to a painful economic collapse were confirmed by a severe property-led recession that struck the country in 2008/9.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/11/business/worldbusiness/11iht-a10_18.html?scp=1&sq=Economy%20reaps%20benefits%20of%20entry%20to%20the%20%27club%27%20:%20Spain%27s%20euro%20bonanza&st=cse|title=Economy reaps benefits of entry to the 'club' : Spain's euro bonanza|work=International Herald Tribune |accessdate=9 August 2008|date=11 July 2002|author=Pfanner, Eric[/tpl] See also: [tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=9118701|title=Spain's economy / Plain sailing no longer|work=The Economist |date=3 May 2007|accessdate=9 August 2008[/tpl]

==Geography==

At [tpl]convert|505992|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on[/tpl], Spain is the world's 52nd-largest country. It is some [tpl]convert|47000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] smaller than France and [tpl]convert|81000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on[/tpl] larger than the U.S. state of California. Mt. Teide (Tenerife) has the highest mountain peak of Spain and the third largest volcano in the world from its base.
Spain lies between latitudes 26° and 44° N, and longitudes 19° W and 5° E.
On the west, Spain borders Portugal; on the south, it borders Gibraltar (a British overseas territory) and Morocco, through its exclaves in North Africa (Ceuta, Melilla, and Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera). On the northeast, along the Pyrenees mountain range, it borders France and the tiny principality of Andorra. Along the Pyrenees in Girona, a small exclave town called Llívia is surrounded by France.

===Islands===

Spain also includes the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea, the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean and a number of uninhabited islands on the Mediterranean side of the Strait of Gibraltar, known as [tpl]lang|es|plazas de soberanía[/tpl] (territories under Spanish sovereignty), such as the Chafarinas Islands, Alhucemas, and the tiny Perejil islet. The isle of Alborán, located in the Mediterranean between Spain and North Africa, is also administered by Spain, specifically by the municipality of Almería, Andalusia. The little Pheasant Island in the River Bidasoa, in the Atlantic Ocean, is a Spanish-French condominium.
Islander population:La superficie de las islas vendrá dada en hectáreas salvo la de las mayores islas de los archipiélagos canario y balear, así como las plazas de soberanía.

===Mountains and rivers===

Mainland Spain is a mountainous country, dominated by high plateaus and mountain chains. After the Pyrenees, the main mountain ranges are the Cordillera Cantábrica, Sistema Ibérico, Sistema Central, Montes de Toledo, Sierra Morena and the Sistema Penibético whose highest peak, the 3,478 m high Mulhacén, located in Sierra Nevada, is the highest elevation in the Iberian peninsula. The highest point in Spain is the Teide, a [tpl]convert|3718|m|ft|adj=on[/tpl] active volcano in the Canary Islands. The Meseta Central is a vast plateau in the heart of peninsular Spain.
There are several major rivers in Spain such as the Tajo (Tagus), the Ebro, the Duero (Douro), the Guadiana and the Guadalquivir. Alluvial plains are found along the coast, the largest of which is that of the Guadalquivir in Andalusia.

===Climate===

Three main climatic zones can be separated, according to geographical situation and orographic conditions:[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.schweizerbart.de/resources/downloads/paper_free/55034.pdf |title=World Map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification updated – (see p.3) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=30 April 2011[/tpl]http://www.city-data.com/forum/attachments/weather/56180d1263187925-ultimate-climate-poll-koppen-climate-classification-kottek_et_al_2006.gifMedia:Koppen World Map.png
Apart from these main types, other sub-types can be found, like the alpine climate in the Pyrenees and Sierra Nevada, and a typical subtropical climate in the Canary Islands.

==Governance==

The Spanish Constitution of 1978 is the culmination of the Spanish transition to democracy.
The constitutional history of Spain dates back to the constitution of 1812. Impatient with the pace of democratic political reforms in 1976 and 1977, Spain's new King Juan Carlos, known for his formidable personality, dismissed Carlos Arias Navarro and appointed the reformer Adolfo Suárez as Prime Minister.John Hooper, The New Spainards, 2001, From Dictatorship to DemocracySpain's fast-living king turns 70 BBC News Friday, 4 January 2008 Extracted 18 June 2009 The resulting general election in 1977 convened the Constituent Cortes (the Spanish Parliament, in its capacity as a constitutional assembly) for the purpose of drafting and approving the constitution of 1978.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.senado.es/constitu_i/index.html |title=Spanish Constitution |publisher=Senado.es |date= |accessdate=1 November 2011[/tpl] After a national referendum on 6 December 1978, 88% of voters approved of the new constitution.
As a result, Spain is now composed of 17 autonomous communities and two autonomous cities with varying degrees of autonomy thanks to its Constitution, which nevertheless explicitly states the indivisible unity of the Spanish nation. The constitution also specifies that Spain has no state religion and that all are free to practice and believe as they wish.
As of November 2009, the government of Spain keeps a balanced gender equality ratio. Nine out of the 18 members of the government are women. Under the administration of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, Spain has been described as being "at the vanguard" in gender equality issues and also that "no other modern, democratic, administration outside Scandinavia has taken more steps to place gender issues at the centre of government".[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7375230.stm |title=Diverging paths on gender equality |publisher=BBC News |date=10 May 2008 |accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl]
The Spanish administration has also promoted gender-based positive discrimination by approving gender equality legislation in 2007 aimed at providing equality between genders in Spanish political and economic life (Gender Equality Act).SPAIN: No Turning Back from Path to Gender Equality However, in the legislative branch, as of July 2010 only 128 of the 350 members of the Congress are women (36.3%).Women in the current Spanish Congress It places Spain 13th on a list of countries ranked by proportion of women in the lower house.

===Branches of government===

Spain is a constitutional monarchy, with a hereditary monarch and a bicameral parliament, the Cortes Generales (General Courts). The executive branch consists of a Council of Ministers of Spain presided over by the Prime Minister, nominated and appointed by the monarch and confirmed by the Congress of Deputies following legislative elections. By political custom established by King Juan Carlos since the ratification of the 1978 Constitution, the king's nominees have all been from parties who maintain a plurality of seats in the Congress.
The legislative branch is made up of the Congress of Deputies (Congreso de los Diputados) with 350 members, elected by popular vote on block lists by proportional representation to serve four-year terms, and a Senate (Senado) with 259 seats of which 208 are directly elected by popular vote and the other 51 appointed by the regional legislatures to also serve four-year terms.
Spain is organizationally structured as a so-called Estado de las Autonomías ("State of Autonomies"); it is one of the most decentralized countries in Europe, along with Switzerland, Germany and Belgium;[tpl]Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/06/18/catalonia.vote/index.html|publisher=CNN|title=Catalonians vote for more autonomy|date=18 June 2006|accessdate=13 August 2008[/tpl] See also: [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/57/0,2340,en_2649_201185_34578361_1_1_1_1,00.html|title=Economic Survey: Spain 2005|accessdate=13 August 2008|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development[/tpl] and [tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/topics/spain?folder=Profile-FactSheet|title=Country Briefings: Spain|accessdate=9 August 2008|work=The Economist [/tpl] and [tpl]cite web|url=http://www1.worldbank.org/wbiep/decentralization/Swiss%20Expertise/Muralt.pdf|title=Swiss Experience With Decentralized Government|format=PDF|accessdate=13 August 2008|publisher=The World Bank[/tpl] for example, all Autonomous Communities have their own elected parliaments, governments, public administrations, budgets, and resources. Health and education systems among others are managed regionally, and in addition, the Basque Country and Navarre also manage their own public finances based on foral provisions. In Catalonia and the Basque Country, a full fledged autonomous police corps replaces some of the State police functions (see Mossos d'Esquadra, Ertzaintza, Policía Foral and Policía Canaria).

===Administrative divisions===

The Spanish State is integrated by 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities, both groups being the highest or first-order administrative division in the country. Autonomous communities are integrated by provinces, of which there are 50 in total, and in turn, provinces are integrated by municipalities. In Catalonia, two additional divisions exist, the comarques (sing. comarca) and the vegueries (sing. vegueria) both of which have administrative powers; comarques being aggregations of municipalities, and the vegueries being aggregations of comarques. The concept of a comarca exists in all autonomous communities, however, unlike Catalonia, these are merely historical or geographical subdivisions.

====Autonomous communities and autonomous cities====

Autonomous communities are the first level administrative division in the country. These were created after the 1979 and current constitution came into effect in recognition of the right to self-government to the "nationalities and regions of Spain".Article 143 of the 1979 Spanish Constitution in reference to Article 2 Autonomous communities were to be integrated by adjacent provinces with common historical, cultural, and economical traits. This territorial organization, based on devolution, is known in Spain as the "State of Autonomies".
The basic institutional law of each autonomous community is the Statute of Autonomy. The Statutes of Autonomy establish the name of the community according to its historical identity, the limits of their territories, the name and organization of the institutions of government and the rights they enjoy according the constitution.Chapter 3. Autonomous Communities. 147th Article. Spanish Constitution of 1978. Retrieved 10 December 2007
The government of all autonomous communities must be based on a division of powers comprising:
Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, which identified themselves as "nationalities" were granted self-government through a rapid process. Andalusia also took that denomination in its first Statute of Autonomy, even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution for the rest of the country. Progressively, other communities in revisions to their Statutes of Autonomy have also taken that denomination in accordance to their historical regional identity, such as the Valencian Community,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.trobat.com/recursos/estatut-valencia.pdf |title=Estatut |format=PDF |language= [tpl]es icon[/tpl] |date= |accessdate=20 July 2009[/tpl] the Canary Islands,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/tuestatuto/novedades.html#pre |title=Nuevo Estatuto de Autonomía de Canarias |publisher=.gobiernodecanarias.org |date= |accessdate=30 April 2011[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=January 2014[/tpl] the Balearic Islands,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.caib.es/webcaib/govern_illes/estatut_autonomia/doc/estatut2007.ca.pdf |title=BOCAe32.QXD |format=PDF |language= [tpl]ca icon[/tpl] |date= |accessdate=20 July 2009[/tpl] and Aragon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://narros.congreso.es/constitucion/estatutos/estatutos.jsp?com=64&tipo=2&ini=1&fin=10&ini_sub=1&fin_sub=1 |title=Estatuto de Autonomía de Aragón |publisher=Narros.congreso.es |date= |accessdate=20 July 2009[/tpl]
The autonomous communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy, with their own parliaments and regional governments. The distribution of powers may be different for every community, as laid out in their Statutes of Autonomy, since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical. Only two communities—the Basque Country and Navarre—have full fiscal autonomy. Aside of fiscal autonomy, the "historical" nationalities—Andalusia, the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Galicia—were devolved more powers than the rest of the communities, among them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time. In addition, the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre have police corps of their own: Ertzaintza, Mossos d'Esquadra and the Policía Foral respectively. Other communities have more limited forces or none at all, like the Policía Autónoma Andaluza[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cartujo.org/pag(a9).htm | title=Unidad de Policía de la Comunidad Autónoma de Andalucía| author=Cartujo.org| accessdate=23 October 2007[/tpl] [tpl]Es icon[/tpl] in Andalusia or the BESCAM in Madrid.
Nonetheless, recent amendments to existing Statutes of Autonomy or the promulgation of new Statutes altogether, have reduced the asymmetry between the powers originally granted to the "historical nationalities" and the rest of the regions.
Finally, along with the 17 autonomous communities, two autonomous cities are also part of the State of Autonomies and are first-order territorial divisions: Ceuta and Melilla. These are two exclaves located in the northern African coast.

====Provinces and municipalities====

Autonomous communities are subdivided into provinces, which served as their territorial building blocks. In turn, provinces are integrated by municipalities. The existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution, not necessarily by the Statutes of Autonomy themselves. Municipalities are granted autonomy to manage their internal affairs, and provinces are the territorial divisions designed to carry out the activities of the State.Articles 140 and 141. Spanish Constitution of 1978
The current provincial division structure is based—with minor changes—on the 1833 territorial division by Javier de Burgos, and in all, the Spanish territory is divided into 50 provinces. The communities of Asturias, Cantabria, La Rioja, the Balearic Islands, Madrid, Murcia and Navarre are the only communities that are integrated by a single province, which is coextensive with the community itself. In this cases, the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community.

===Foreign relations===

After the return of democracy following the death of Franco in 1975, Spain's foreign policy priorities were to break out of the diplomatic isolation of the Franco years and expand diplomatic relations, enter the European Community, and define security relations with the West.
As a member of NATO since 1982, Spain has established itself as a participant in multilateral international security activities. Spain's EU membership represents an important part of its foreign policy. Even on many international issues beyond western Europe, Spain prefers to coordinate its efforts with its EU partners through the European political cooperation mechanisms.
Spain has maintained its special relation with Hispanic America and the Philippines. Its policy emphasizes the concept of an Iberoamerican community, essentially the renewal of the historically liberal concept of "Hispanidad" or "Hispanismo", as it is often referred to in English, which has sought to link the Iberian Peninsula with Hispanic America through language, commerce, history and culture.

====Territorial disputes====

Spain claims Gibraltar, a [tpl]convert|6|km2|mi2|adj=on[/tpl] Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom in the southernmost part of the Iberian Peninsula. Then a Spanish town, it was conquered by an Anglo-Dutch force in 1704 during the War of the Spanish Succession on behalf of Archduke Charles, pretender to the Spanish throne.
The legal situation concerning Gibraltar was settled in 1713 by the Treaty of Utrecht, in which Spain ceded the territory in perpetuity to the British Crown[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mgar.net/docs/utrech.htm|title=Tratado de Utretch – Gibraltar (Spanish)|accessdate=9 August 2008|publisher=mgar.net[/tpl] stating that, should the British abandon this post, it would be offered to Spain first. Since the 1940s Spain has called for the return of Gibraltar. The overwhelming majority of Gibraltarians strongly oppose this, along with any proposal of shared sovereignty. UN resolutions call on the United Kingdom and Spain, both EU members, to reach an agreement over the status of Gibraltar.
The Spanish claim makes a distinction between the isthmus that connects the Rock to the Spanish mainland on the one hand, and the Rock and city of Gibraltar on the other. While the Rock and city were ceded by the Treaty of Utrecht, Spain asserts that the "occupation of the isthmus is illegal and against the principles of International Law".[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.maec.es/subwebs/Embajadas/Londres/es/MenuPpal/Gibraltar/Documents/000.001.002.003%20Título.%20Prefacio.Índice.%20Informe%20(27.02.08).doc | title=La cuestión de Gibraltar | publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Spain | date=January 2008 | accessdate=3 January 2010 | language=Spanish[/tpl] The United Kingdom relies on de facto arguments of possession by prescription in relation to the isthmus,[tpl]Cite book | title=Gibraltar: British or Spanish? | author=Peter Gold | publisher=Routledge | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-415-34795-2 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=u9YH_fLPu1MC |page=4 | authorlink=Peter Gold[/tpl] as there has been "continuous possession the isthmus over a long period".[tpl]cite web | author=UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs | year=1999 | url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/kfile/OT13.pdf | title=Partnership for Progress and Prosperity: Britain and the Overseas Territories.

Another claim by Spain is about the Savage Islands, a claim not recognized by Portugal. Spain claims they are rocks and not islands therefore claiming there is no Portuguese territorial waters around the disputed islands, on 5 July 2013 Spain sent a letter to the UN expressing these views.[tpl]citation|url=http://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/prt44_09/esp_re_prt2013.pdf|title= Spain's letter to the UN |publisher= UN|data= |date=September 2013|language=Spanish[/tpl]"Spain disputes Portugal islands" The Portugal News. Retrieved 9 September 2013.
Spain claims the sovereignty over the Perejil Island, a small, uninhabited rocky islet located in the South shore of the Strait of Gibraltar. The island lies [tpl]convert|250|m|ft[/tpl] just off the coast of Morocco, [tpl]convert|8|km|mi[/tpl] from Ceuta and [tpl]convert|13.5|km|mi[/tpl] from mainland Spain. Its sovereignty is disputed between Spain and Morocco. It was the subject of an armed incident between the two countries in 2002. The incident ended when both countries agreed to return to the status quo ante which existed prior to the Moroccan occupation of the island. The islet is now deserted and without any sign of sovereignty.
Besides the Perejil Island, the Spanish-held territories claimed by other countries are two: Morocco claims the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the plazas de soberanía islets off the northern coast of Africa; and Portugal does not recognise Spain's sovereignty over the territory of Olivenza.

===Military===

The armed forces of Spain are known as the Spanish Armed Forces (Fuerzas Armadas Españolas).

==Economy==

===Recent background===

Spain's capitalist mixed economy is the 14th largest worldwide and the 5th largest in the European Union, as well as the Eurozone's 4th largest.
The centre-right government of former prime minister José María Aznar worked successfully to gain admission to the group of countries launching the euro in 1999. Unemployment stood at 7.6% in October 2006, a rate that compared favorably to many other European countries, and especially with the early 1990s when it stood at over 20%.

By the mid-1990s the economy had recommmenced the growth that had been disrupted by the global recession of the early 1990s. The strong economic growth helped the government to reduce the government debt as a percentage of GDP and Spain's high unemployment began to drop steadily. With the government budget in balance and inflation under control Spain was admitted into the Eurozone in 1999.
Since the 1990s some Spanish companies have gained multinational status, often expanding their activities in culturally close Latin America. Spain is the second biggest foreign investor there, after the United States. Spanish companies too have expanded into Asia, especially China and India.[ref]
</ref> This early global expansion is a competitive vantage over its competitors and European neighbors. The reason may primarily due to the booming interest toward Spanish language and culture in Asia and Africa, but also a corporate culture that learned to take risks in unstable markets.

===Property boom and bust===

The adoption of the Euro saw a marked reduction in interest rates to historic lows. The growth in the Spanish property market, which had begun in 1997, accelerated and within a few years had developed into a property bubble, financed largely by the cajas (regional savings banks under the oversight of the regional governments) and fed by the historically low interest rates and a massive growth of immigration. The Spanish economy was credited for having avoided the virtual zero growth rate of some of its largest partners in the EU.[tpl]cite web|url=http://stats.oecd.org/WBOS/ViewHTML.aspx?QueryName=198&QueryType=View&Lang=en|title=OECD figures|publisher=OECD|accessdate=13 August 2008[/tpl]

At first, Spain's banks and financial services avoided the early crisis of their counterparts in the US and UK. This was particularly the case with Spain's international banks, Banco Santander and BBVA, that had diversified, international portfolios and had actively limited their exposure to housing mortgage risk. Banco Santander was able to profit from the global financial crisis by taking over distressed British banking firms.Charles Smith, article: "Spain", in Wankel, C. (ed.) Encyclopedia of Business in Today's World, California, US, 2009. However, as the recession deepened and property prices slid, the growing bad debts of the smaller regional savings banks, the cajas, forced the intervention of Spain's central bank and government through a stabilisation and consolidation program, taking over or consolidating regional cajas and finally receiving a bank bailout from the European Central Bank in 2012.New York Times - Spain receives 100 billion euro bailout[tpl]cite news|author=Giles Tremlett in Madrid |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/08/spain-savings-banks-corruption |title=The Guardian, Spain's savings banks' 8 June 2012 |publisher=Guardian |date= 8 June 2012|accessdate=26 April 2013 |location=London[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Mallet |first=Victor |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d8411cf6-bb89-11e1-90e4-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2GDPWPST5 |title=The bank that broke Spain Financial Times |publisher=Ft.com |date=21 June 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2013[/tpl]

===Quality of life===

Research about quality of life by the Economist Intelligence Unit's quality of life survey placed Spain among the top 10 in the world for 2005, ahead of other economically advanced countries like France, Germany, the United Kingdom and South Korea.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/QUALITY_OF_LIFE.pdf | work=The Economist[/tpl]

===Agriculture===

Crop areas were farmed in two highly diverse manners. Areas relying on nonirrigated cultivation (secano), which made up 85% of the entire crop area, depended solely on rainfall as a source of water. They included the humid regions of the north and the northwest, as well as vast arid zones that had not been irrigated. The much more productive regions devoted to irrigated cultivation (regadio) accounted for 3 million hectares in 1986, and the government hoped that this area would eventually double, as it already had doubled since 1950. Particularly noteworthy was the development in Almeria — one of the most arid and desolate provinces of Spain — of winter crops of various fruits and vegetables for export to Europe.
Though only about 17% of Spain's cultivated land was irrigated, it was estimated to be the source of between 40-45% of the gross value of crop production and of 50% of the value of agricultural exports. More than half of the irrigated area was planted in corn, fruit trees, and vegetables. Other agricultural products that benefited from irrigation included grapes, cotton, sugar beets, potatoes, legumes, olive trees, mangos, strawberries, tomatoes, and fodder grasses. Depending on the nature of the crop, it was possible to harvest two successive crops in the same year on about 10% of the country's irrigated land.
Citrus fruits, vegetables, cereal grains, olive oil, and wine — Spain's traditional agricultural products — continued to be important in the 1980s. In 1983 they represented 12%, 12%, 8%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, of the country's agricultural production. Because of the changed diet of an increasingly affluent population, there was a notable increase in the consumption of livestock, poultry, and dairy products. Meat production for domestic consumption became the single most important agricultural activity, accounting for 30% of all farm-related production in 1983. Increased attention to livestock was the reason that Spain became a net importer of grains. Ideal growing conditions, combined with proximity to important north European markets, made citrus fruits Spain's leading export. Fresh vegetables and fruits produced through intensive irrigation farming also became important export commodities, as did sunflower seed oil that was produced to compete with the more expensive olive oils in oversupply throughout the Mediterranean countries of the EC.

===Tourism===

The climate of Spain, its geographic location, popular coastlines, diverse landscapes, historical legacy, vibrant culture and excellent infrastructure, has made Spain's international tourist industry among the largest in the world. In the last five decades, international tourism in Spain has grown to become the second largest in the world in terms of spending, worth approximately 40 billion Euros or about 5% of GDP in 2006.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.theglobalguru.com/article.php?id=60&offer=GURU001|title=Global Guru [tpl]pipe[/tpl] analysis|accessdate=13 August 2008|publisher=The Global Guru[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bde.es/informes/be/boleco/coye.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Bank of Spain|title=Economic report|accessdate=13 August 2008[/tpl]

The Spanish road system is mainly centralized, with six highways connecting Madrid to the Basque Country, Catalonia, Valencia, West Andalusia, Extremadura and Galicia. Additionally, there are highways along the Atlantic (Ferrol to Vigo), Cantabrian (Oviedo to San Sebastián) and Mediterranean (Girona to Cádiz) coasts.

The airport of Barcelona (El Prat) is also important, with 35 million passengers in 2011, being the world's 31st-busiest airport. Other main airports are located in Majorca (23 million passengers), Málaga (13 million passengers), Las Palmas (Gran Canaria) (11 million passengers), Alicante (10 million passengers) and smaller, with the number of passengers between 4 and 10 million, for example Tenerife (two airports), Valencia, Seville, Bilbao, Ibiza, Lanzarote, Fuerteventura.

==Demographics==

In 2008 the population of Spain officially reached 46 million people, as recorded by the Padrón municipal.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ine.es/jaxi/menu.do?type=pcaxis&path=%2Ft20/e260&file=inebase&L=1|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estadística (National Statistics Institute)|title=Population Figures|accessdate=13 August 2008[/tpl] Spain's population density, at 91/km² (235/sq mi), is lower than that of most Western European countries and its distribution across the country is very unequal. With the exception of the region surrounding the capital, Madrid, the most populated areas lie around the coast. The population of Spain more than doubled since 1900, when it stood at 18.6 million, principally due to the spectacular demographic boom in the 1960s and early 1970s.Joseph Harrison, David Corkill (2004). "Spain: a modern European economy". Ashgate Publishing. p.23. ISBN 0-7546-0145-5
Native Spaniards make up 88% of the total population of Spain. After the birth rate plunged in the 1980s and Spain's population growth rate dropped, the population again trended upward, based initially on the return of many Spaniards who had emigrated to other European countries during the 1970s, and more recently, fuelled by large numbers of immigrants who make up 12% of the population. The immigrants originate mainly in Latin America (39%), North Africa (16%), Eastern Europe (15%), and Sub-Saharan Africa (4%).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ine.es/inebase/cgi/axi?AXIS_PATH=/inebase/temas/t20/e245/p04/a2005/l0/&FILE_AXIS=00000010.px&CGI_DEFAULT=/inebase/temas/cgi.opt&COMANDO=SELECCION&CGI_URL=/inebase/cgi/|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estadística|title=Población extranjera por sexo, país de nacionalidad y edad|accessdate=13 August 2008| archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20080325043135/http://www.ine.es/inebase/cgi/axi?AXIS_PATH=/inebase/temas/t20/e245/p04/a2005/l0/&FILE_AXIS=00000010.px&CGI_DEFAULT=/inebase/temas/cgi.opt&COMANDO=SELECCION&CGI_URL=/inebase/cgi/| archivedate = 25 March 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] In 2005, Spain instituted a three-month amnesty program through which certain hitherto undocumented aliens were granted legal residency.
In 2008, Spain granted citizenship to 84,170 persons, mostly to people from Ecuador, Colombia and Morocco."EU27 Member States granted citizenship to 696 000 persons in 2008" (PDF). Eurostat. 6 July 2010. A sizeable portion of foreign residents in Spain also comes from other Western and Central European countries. These are mostly British, French, German, Dutch, and Norwegian. They reside primarily on the Mediterranean coast and the Balearic islands, where many choose to live their retirement or telecommute.
Substantial populations descended from Spanish colonists and immigrants exist in other parts of the world, most notably in Latin America. Beginning in the late 15th century, large numbers of Iberian colonists settled in what became Latin America and at present most white Latin Americans (who make up about one-third of Latin America's population) are of Spanish or Portuguese origin. In the 16th century perhaps 240,000 Spaniards emigrated, mostly to Peru and Mexico.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/history/migration/chapter53.html |title=Migration to Latin America. |publisher= Leiden University|date= |accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl] They were joined by 450,000 in the next century.[tpl]Cite journal|url= http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/AXTELL01.ART |title= The Columbian Mosaic in Colonial America |first= James |last= Axtell |journal=Humanities |date= September–October 1991 |volume= 12 |issue= 5 |pages= 12–18 |accessdate=8 October 2008|postscript=  | archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20080517052031/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/AXTELL01.ART| archivedate = 17 May 2008|ref= harv[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=April 2014[/tpl] Between 1846 and 1932 it is estimated that nearly 5 million Spaniards emigrated to the Americas, especially to Argentina and Brazil.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/557573/Spain/70267/People |title=Spain – People |publisher=Britannica.com |date=20 March 2013 |accessdate=18 January 2014[/tpl] Approximately two million Spaniards migrated to other Western European countries between 1960 to 1975.

===Peoples===

The Spanish Constitution of 1978, in its second article, recognises historic entities—nationalities (a carefully chosen word in order to avoid the more politically charged "nations")—and regions, within the context of the Spanish nation. For some people, Spain's identity consists more of an overlap of different regional identities than of a sole Spanish identity. Indeed, some of the regional identities may even conflict with the Spanish one. Distinct traditional regional identities within Spain include the Basques, Catalans, Galicians, Cantabrians and Castilians, among others.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2878.htm|title=Kingdom of Spain: People|accessdate=13 August 2008|publisher=US Department of State[/tpl]
It is this last feature of "shared identity" between the more local level or Autonomous Community and the Spanish level which makes the identity question in Spain complex and far from univocal.

===Minority groups===

Spain has a number of descendants of populations from former colonies, especially Latin America and North Africans and smaller numbers of immigrants from several Sub-Saharan countries have recently been settling in Spain. There are also sizeable numbers of Asian immigrants, most of whom are of, Middle Eastern and South Asian and Chinese origin. The single largest group of immigrants are European; represented by large numbers of Britons, Germans, French and others.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6161705.stm|title=Immigration statistics|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 August 2008 | date=11 December 2006[/tpl]

===Immigration===

According to the Spanish government there were 5.7 million foreign residents in Spain in 2011, or 12% of the total population. According to residence permit data for 2011, more than 860,000 were Romanian, about 770,000 were Moroccan, approximately 390,000 were British, and 360,000 were Ecuadorian.2011: INE Other sizeable foreign communities are Colombian, Bolivian, German, Italian, Bulgarian, and Chinese.

Within the EU, Spain had the 2nd highest immigration rate in percentage terms after Cyprus, but by a great margin, the highest in absolute numbers, up to 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-NK-06-001/EN/KS-NK-06-001-EN.PDF|publisher=Eurostat|title=Population in Europe in 2005|format=PDF|accessdate=13 August 2008[/tpl] The number of immigrants in Spain had grown up from 500,000 people in 1996 to 5.2 million in 2008 out of a total population of 46 million.Spain to increase immigration budget, 10 October 2007Spain’s Immigration System Runs Amok, 17 September 2008 In 2005 alone, a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700,000 people.[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/may/09/spain.gilestremlett |title=Spain grants amnesty to 700,000 migrants |work=Guardian | location=London |date= 9 May 2005|accessdate=20 July 2009 | first=Giles | last=Tremlett[/tpl] There are a number of reasons for the high level of immigration, including Spain's cultural ties with Latin America, its geographical position, the porosity of its borders, the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors, which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce.
Another statistically significant factor is the large number of residents of EU origin typically retiring to Spain's Mediterranean coast. In fact, Spain was Europe's largest absorber of migrants from 2002 to 2007, with its immigrant population more than doubling as 2.5 million people arrived.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ine.es/inebase/cgi/um?M=%2Ft20%2Fe245%2Fp08%2F&O=pcaxis&N=&L=0|title=Population series from 1998|publisher=INE Spanish Statistical Institute|accessdate=14 August 2008| archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20071102141040/http://www.ine.es/inebase/cgi/um?M=/t20/e245/p08/&O=pcaxis&N=&L=0| archivedate = 2 November 2007[/tpl] In 2008, prior to the onset of the economic crisis, the Financial Times reported that Spain was the most favoured destination for Western Europeans considering a move from their own country and seeking jobs elsewhere in the EU.[tpl]cite web|url=http://international.ibox.bg/news/id_1406161495|publisher=News.bg|title=Europeans Favour Spain for Expat Jobs|accessdate=13 August 2008[/tpl]
In 2008, the government instituted a "Plan of Voluntary Return" which encouraged unemployed immigrants from outside the EU to return to their home countries and receive several incentives, including the right to keep their unemployment benefits and transfer whatever they contributed to the Spanish Social Security.Plan de Retorno Voluntario Gobierno de España The program had little effect; during its first two months, just 1,400 immigrants took up the offer.Spain's Jobs Crisis Leaves Immigrants Out of Work, The Wall Street Journal, 24 January 2009 What the program failed to do, the sharp and prolonged economic crisis has done from 2010 to 2011 in that tens of thousands of immigrants have left the country due to lack of jobs. In 2011 alone, more than half a million people left Spain. For the first time in decades the net migration rate was expected to be negative, and nine out of 10 emigrants were foreigners.580.000 personas se van de España. El País.
