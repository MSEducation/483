The school also has a sixth form which currently has around 300 pupils. The school also has a school council, which contributes to the decisions made by the head and speaks on behalf of all the students in all years.

==Traditions==

The simplified version of its arms, worn by the lower school, features a torch and a river, while the full version, worn by the Sixth Form only, also features a book and a tool. Its motto is Meliora Spectare, Latin for Look to better things.
The school has six houses, named after ancient cities - Carthage, Sparta, Rome, Troy, Athens and Thebes.

==History==

Although the school has links to a seventeenth century school that existed in Wath, it was founded in 1923 as Wath Secondary School. It became known as  Wath Grammar School in 1931. The school was expanded with many new buildings in the early 1950s. In January 1964, with the scrapping of the eleven-plus exam in the area, the school absorbed Park Road Secondary Modern School, although it was some time before it was designated a comprehensive school in 1972 and renamed Wath Comprehensive School in 1974.https://wathcomp.rgfl.org/Documents/SchoolProspectus2011.pdf The secondary modern building became the first year wing of the school. However, it was recently demolished.

==PFI scheme==

A major Private Finance Initiative (PFI) rebuild, completed at Easter 2005, has seen the school mostly housed in brand-new buildings, although the loss of the oldest buildings was not without controversy, particularly the traditional 1930s part of the school which was set around two quadrangles. In 2008, the rebuilding was fully completed with the addition of a public Leisure Centre including a swimming pool.
