[[Þrymr]]

CATEGORIES: Mythological kings, Jötnar

In Norse mythology, Þrymr (Thrymr, Thrym; "uproar") was king of the jotnar.  In one legend, he stole Mjollnir, Thor's hammer, to extort the gods into giving him Freyja as his wife. His kingdom was called Jötunheimr, but according to Hversu Noregr byggdist, it was the Swedish province Värmland, then a part of Norway.
Þrymr was foiled in his scheme by the gracefulness of Heimdall, the cunning of Loki, and the sheer violence of Thor.  Thor, son of Odin, later killed Thrym, his sister, and all of his jotnar kin, which had been present at the wedding reception. The poem Þrymskviða gives the details of how Thor got his hammer back. Bergfinnr is a son of Thrymr, the Giant of Vermland.
