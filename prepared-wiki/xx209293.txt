==Controversy and criticism==

Karim Khurram is regarded by many - even among his own circle - as a Pashtun nationalist."Karzai's team clash", Al-Jazeera, March 2012 After becoming minister for culture and information, he removed the Persian sign on the ministry's building and replaced it with a Pashto one (Persian and Pashto are the two official languages of Afghanistan). On February 10, 2008, he suspended three journalists for five days and fined them five days pay for using the Persian word for university ("daneshgah") instead of the Pashto word ("pohantoon") in their Persian articles."Poets, writers protest Afghan journalists' fine", Habaa Communications, 16 February 2008.
Khoram also scrapped initial plans to integrate the Afghan National Radio and Television into the public service run by an independent board. He put the state television and radio under his personal control instead."Afghan Media Face Threat of Controls", The New York Times, May 7, 2007. This led to calls for impeachment.
