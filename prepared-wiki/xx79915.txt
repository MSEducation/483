In May 1921 he was appointed as an aide-de-camp (ADC) to King George V, which he held till April 1922. After a posting in England, he was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1922. On 2 June 1923 he was appointed as a Commander of the Order of the Bath (CB), Military Division.[tpl]LondonGazette|issue=32830|startpage=3944|supp=yes|date=2 July 1923|accessdate=25 July 2010[/tpl] He was later posted from 1923 to 1925 as a senior naval officer to the China Station and briefly served as Temporary Commander-in-Chief in 1925.

==Governor of Newfoundland==

Anderson was then appointed on 20 October 1932 as the Governor of Newfoundland.[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=33876| startpage=6702| date=20 October 1932|accessdate=25 July 2010[/tpl] He became His Majesty's Representative at a time of great instability in the Dominion of Newfoundland. Newfoundland had been hit badly by the Great Depression, leaving most of the banks on the verge of bankruptcy, saved only by emergency loans from Britain, the state Treasury was empty and the political process was discredited by corruption and incompetence.Noel, SJR, Politics in Newfoundland, University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1971, p220
The Government, led by Prime Minister Frederick C. Alderdice, called upon the British government to take direct control until Newfoundland could become self-sustaining. The United Kingdom, concerned over Newfoundland's likelihood of defaulting on its loans, asked the government to establish the Newfoundland Royal Commission, headed by a Scottish peer, Lord Amulree. Its report, released in 1933, assessed Newfoundland's political system as institutionally corrupt and its economic future as bleak, recommending the abolition of responsible government, and its replacement by a Commission of the British Government. Acting on the report's recommendations, Alderdice's government voted itself out of existence in December 1933. Appointed as Chair of the Commission of Government in 1934, Anderson found his role as Governor with significantly expanded powers and proved himself up to the job, constantly sending reports back to the Dominions Office and giving advice to the Dominions Secretary on how to deal with the Commission members.
Despite his new-found powers, Anderson took the position as the neutral mediator, intervening only when there was a dispute in the Commission.Noel, pg 227 He was nevertheless involved with restructuring the administration of the state, including government departments, social services, the health system and the postal system.[tpl]cite web| title =Anderson, Sir David Murray (1874-1936)| publisher =The Governorship of Newfoundland and Labrador| url =http://www.heritage.nf.ca/govhouse/governors/g66.html| accessdate =25 July 2010 [/tpl] His approach proved to be not enough to bring the Commission out of petty arguments and disputes and in October 1935 it was announced that he would be replaced by another Naval Officer, Sir Humphrey Walwyn. Anderson and his wife departed from Newfoundland the following January.

==Governor of New South Wales==

In November 1935 it was announced that he was to become the Governor of New South Wales,[tpl]LondonGazette |issue=34281| startpage=2893| date=24 April 1936| accessdate=25 July 2010[/tpl] a relatively quieter post. He was invested by King Edward VIII as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) on 5 May 1936[tpl]LondonGazette|issue=34282|startpage=2974|date=5 May 1936|accessdate=25 July 2010[/tpl] and as a Knight of Grace of the Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem (KStJ) on 23 June 1936.[tpl]LondonGazette| issue=34297|startpage=4013|date=23 June 1936|accessdate=25 July 2010[/tpl] 
En route to Australia he was taken ill, and had to spend six weeks in hospital in Perth, Western Australia. He was sworn in at Sydney on 6 August 1936 . Because of his recurring illness, Lady Anderson undertook many official duties on his behalf, while the Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales, Sir Philip Street, carried out his legislative and ceremonial duties. On 29 October he collapsed and died of a cerebral haemorrhage early in the morning the next day at Government House. His body was laid in state in St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney and was shipped back to England for burial. 
Lady Edith Muriel Anderson was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) on 11 May 1937 for public service in New South Wales.Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, DBE, 11 May 1937, itsanhonour.gov.au, Citation: Public service in New South Wales.
