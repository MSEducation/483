The New York Post is an American daily newspaper, primarily distributed in New York City and its surrounding area. It is the 13th-oldest and seventh-most-widely circulated newspaper in the United States.Burrellesluce.com Established in 1801 by federalist Alexander Hamilton, it became a respected broadsheet in the 19th century, under the name New York Evening Post. Since 1993, the Post has been owned by News Corporation (and its successor, News Corp, as established in 2013), which had owned it previously from 1976 to 1988. Its editorial offices are located at 1211 Avenue of the Americas, in New York City, New York. The modern version of the paper is written in tabloid format.

==History==

The New York Post, established on November 16, 1801 as the New-York Evening Post, describes itself as the nation's oldest continuously published daily newspaper. The Hartford Courant, believed to be the oldest continuously published newspaper, was founded in 1764 as a semi-weekly paper; it did not begin publishing daily until 1836. The New Hampshire Gazette, which has trademarked its claim of being The Nation's Oldest Newspaper, was founded in 1756, also as a weekly. Moreover, since the 1890s it has been published only for weekends.

===19th century===

The Post was founded by Alexander Hamilton with about US$10,000 from a group of investors in the autumn of 1801 as the New-York Evening Post,Allan Nevins, The Evening Post: Century of Journalism, Boni and Liveright, 1922, page 17. a broadsheet. Hamilton's co-investors included other New York members of the Federalist Party, such as Robert Troup and Oliver Wolcott,Nevins, page 14. who were dismayed by the election of Thomas Jefferson as U.S. President and the rise in popularity of the Democratic-Republican Party.Emery & Emery, page 74. The meeting at which Hamilton first recruited investors for the new paper took place in then-country weekend villa that is now Gracie Mansion.Nevins, pages 17–18. Hamilton chose William Coleman as his first editor.
The most famous 19th-century New-York Evening Post editor was the poet and abolitionist William Cullen Bryant.Emery & Emery, page 90. So well respected was the New-York Evening Post under Bryant's editorship, it received praise from the English philosopher John Stuart Mill, in 1864.Nevins, page 341.
In the summer of 1829, Bryant invited William Leggett, the Locofoco Democrat, to write for the paper. There, in addition to literary and drama reviews, Leggett began to write political editorials. Leggett's classical liberal philosophy entailed a fierce opposition to central banking, a support for voluntary labor unions, and a dedication to laissez-faire economics. He was a member of the Equal Rights Party. Leggett became a co-owner and editor at the Post in 1831,[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] eventually working as sole editor of the newspaper while Bryant traveled in Europe in 1834 through 1835.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
Another co-owner of the paper was John Bigelow.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] Born in Malden-on-Hudson, New York, John Bigelow, Sr. graduated in 1835 from Union College, where he was a member of the Sigma Phi Society and the Philomathean Society, and was admitted to the bar in 1838.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl] From 1849 to 1861, he was one of the editors and co-owners of the New York Evening Post.[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2012[/tpl]
In 1881 Henry Villard took control of the New-York Evening Post, as well as The Nation, which became the Post[tpl]'[/tpl]s weekly edition. With this acquisition, the paper was managed by the triumvirate of Carl Schurz, Horace White and Edwin L. Godkin.Nevins, page 438. When Schurz left the paper in 1883, Godkin became editor-in-chief.Nevins, page 458. White became editor-in-chief in 1899, and remained in that role until his retirement in 1903."Horace White Dies," The New York Times, September 17, 1916.Nevins, pp. 440–441.
In 1897, both publications passed to the management of Villard's son, Oswald Garrison Villard,Webster's Biographical Dictionary, G. & C. Miriam Co., 1964, page 1522. a founding member of both the National Association for the Advancement of Colored PeopleChristopher Robert Reed, The Chicago NAACP and the Rise of Black Professional Leadership, 1910–1966, Indiana University Press, 1997, page 10. and the American Civil Liberties Union.Emery & Emery, page 257.

===20th century===

Villard sold the paper in 1918, after widespread allegations of pro-German sympathies during World War I hurt its circulation. In 1948 The Bronx Home News merged with it.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.landsofnewyork.com/County-Data-For-Bronx-County-New-York |title=County Data for Bronx County, New York |publisher=LandsofNewYork.com |accessdate=February 13, 2014[/tpl]
The new owner was Thomas Lamont, a senior partner in the Wall Street firm of J.P. Morgan & Co.. Unable to stem the paper's financial losses, he sold it to a consortium of 34 financial and reform political leaders, headed by Edwin Francis Gay, dean of the Harvard Business School, whose members included Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Conservative Cyrus H. K. Curtis[tpl]cite web| url=http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Newspaper/NYNewspapers.html| title=New York Newspapers and Editors |accessdate=June 7, 2007[/tpl]—publisher of the Ladies Home Journal—purchased the New-York Evening Post in 1924[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ketupa.net/curtis.htm|title=ketupa.net media profiles: curtis|accessdate=June 7, 2007[/tpl] and briefly turned it into a non-sensational tabloid in 1933.
In 1934, J. David Stern purchased the paper, changed its name to the New York Post, and restored its broadsheet size and liberal perspective.Emery & Emery, page 292.
In 1939, Dorothy Schiff purchased the paper. Her husband, George Backer, was named editor and publisher.Deborah G. Felder & Diana L. Rosen, Fifty Jewish Women Who Changed the World, Citadel Press, 2003, page 164. Her second editor (and third husband) Ted Thackrey became co-publisher and co-editor with Schiff in 1942.[tpl]cite news|url=http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794542,00.html|title=Dolly's Goodbye| work=Time |date= January 31, 1949|accessdate=June 6, 2007[/tpl] Together, they recast the newspaper into its current tabloid format.Emery & Emery, page 556. In 1949, James Wechsler became editor of the paper, running both the news and the editorial pages. In 1961, he turned over the news section to Paul Sann and remained as editorial-page editor until 1980.
Under Schiff's tenure the Post was devoted to liberalism, supporting trade unions and social welfare, and featured some of the most-popular columnists of the time, such as Joseph Cookman, Drew Pearson, Eleanor Roosevelt, Max Lerner, Murray Kempton, Pete Hamill, and Eric Sevareid, in addition to theatre critic Richard Watts, Jr. and Broadway columnist Earl Wilson.

===Murdoch ownership===

In 1976, Rupert Murdoch bought the Post for US$30.5 million.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001479107|title=News Corp: Historical Overview|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=November 14, 2005|accessdate=June 7, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061208130444/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/feature_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001479107 |archivedate=December 8, 2006[/tpl] The Post at this point was the only surviving afternoon daily in New York City and its circulation under Schiff had grown by two-thirds, particularly after the failure of the competing World Journal Tribune. However, the rising cost of operating an afternoon daily in a city with worsening daytime traffic congestion, combined with mounting competition from expanded local TV news cut into the Post's profitability, though it made money from 1949 until Schiff's final year of ownership, when it lost $500,000. (The paper has lost money ever since).
In late October 1995, the Post announced plans to change its Monday through Saturday publication and start a Sunday edition,[tpl]Citation |publication-date=October 24, 1995 |title=New York Post to Publish on Sundays |publisher= New York Times |page= |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/24/nyregion/new-york-post-to-publish-on-sundays.html |accessdate=December 8, 2013[/tpl] which it last published briefly in 1989.[tpl]Citation |publication-date=February 5, 1996 |title=Post Plans Sunday Paper |publisher= New York Times |page=6|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/05/nyregion/post-plans-sunday-paper.html |accessdate=December 8, 2013[/tpl] On April 14, 1996, the Post delivered its new Sunday edition at the cost of 50 cents per paper by keeping its size to 120 pages.[tpl]Citation |publication-date=April 14, 1996 |title=The New York Post Starts Inexpensive Sunday Paper |publisher= Orlando Sentinel |page=A26 |url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/keyword/new-york-post/recent/2|accessdate=December 8, 2013[/tpl] The amount, significantly less than Sunday editions from competitors The Daily News and The New York Times, was part of the Post's efforts "to find a niche in the nation's most competitive newspaper market".
In December 2012, Murdoch announced that Jesse Angelo had been appointed Publisher.

====Style====

thumb|One of the paper's most famous headlines, from the April 15, 1983 edition.Murdoch imported the sensationalist "tabloid journalism" style of many of his Australian and British newspapers, such as The Sun (for a long time, the highest selling daily newspaper in the UK). This style was typified by the Post[tpl]'[/tpl]s famous headlines such as "Headless body in topless bar" (shown on the right). In its 35th-anniversary edition, New York Magazine listed this as one of the greatest headlines. It also has five other Post headlines in its "Greatest Tabloid Headlines" list.[tpl]cite web|author=Published |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/anniversary/35th/n_8568/|title=Greatest Tabloid Headlines|publisher=Nymag.com|date=March 31, 2003|accessdate=February 11, 2009[/tpl]
Because of the institution of federal regulations limiting media cross-ownership after Murdoch's purchase of WNEW-TV (Now WNYW-TV) and four other stations from Metromedia to launch the Fox Broadcasting Company, Murdoch was forced to sell the paper for US$37.6 million in 1988 to Peter S. Kalikow, a real-estate magnate with no news experience.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/issues/2004/1/gangs-hickey.asp|title=Moment of Truth|author=Neil Hickey|work=Columbia Journalism Review|date=January–February 2004|accessdate=June 7, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070423111034/http://www.cjr.org/issues/2004/1/gangs-hickey.asp |archivedate=April 23, 2007[/tpl] When Kalikow declared bankruptcy in 1993, the paper was temporarily managed by Steven Hoffenberg, a financier who later pleaded guilty to securities fraud;[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.securitization.net/pdf/nomura_abs_030502.pdf|title=ABS Credit Migrations|work=Nomura Fixed Income Research|date= March 5, 2002|page= 20|format=PDF|accessdate=June 7, 2007[/tpl] and, for two weeks, by Abe Hirschfeld,Bob Fenster, Duh! The Stupid History of the Human Race, McMeel, 2000, page 13. who made his fortune building parking garages. After a staff revolt against the Hoffenberg-Hirschfeld partnership—which included publication of an issue whose front page featured the iconic masthead photo of founder Alexander Hamilton with a single tear drop running down his cheek[tpl]cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE1DD113CF935A25750C0A965958260&scp=7&sq=new+york+post&st=nyt|title=Fight for New York Post Heats Up In Court, in Newsroom and in Prin|last=Glaberson|first=William|date=March 16, 1993|accessdate=March 22, 2009| work=The New York Times[/tpl]—The Post was again purchased in 1993 by Murdoch's News Corporation. This came about after numerous political officials, including Democratic governor of New York Mario Cuomo, persuaded the Federal Communications Commission to grant Murdoch a permanent waiver from the cross-ownership rules that had forced him to sell the paper five years earlier.Hickey, "Moment of Truth". Without that FCC ruling, the paper would have shut down. Under Murdoch's renewed direction, the paper continued its conservative editorial viewpoint.

====Criticism====

Perhaps the most serious allegation against the Post is that it is willing to contort its news coverage to suit Murdoch's business needs, in particular that the paper has avoided reporting anything that is unflattering to the government of the People's Republic of China, where Murdoch has invested heavily in satellite television.[tpl]cite news|author=James Barron and Campbell Robertson|title=Page Six, Staple of Gossip, Reports on Its Own Tale|work= The New York Times|date=May 19, 2007|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/19/nyregion/19six.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1&ref=nyregion&oref=slogin|accessdate=May 19, 2007[/tpl]
Critics say that the Post allows its editorial positions to shape its story selection and news coverage. Post executive editor Steven D. Cuozzo has responded that the Post "broke the elitist media stranglehold on the national agenda."
According to a survey conducted by Pace University in 2004, the Post was rated the least-credible major news outlet in New York, and the only news outlet to receive more responses calling it "not credible" than credible (44% not credible to 39% credible).[tpl]cite web|url=http://appserv.pace.edu/emplibrary/pace_poll_061604.pdf|author=Jonathan Trichter|title=Tabloids, Broadsheets, and Broadcast News|work=Pace Poll Survey Research Study|date=June 16, 2004|format=PDF|accessdate=June 7, 2007[/tpl]
The Public Enemy song "A Letter to the New York Post" from their album Apocalypse '91...The Enemy Strikes Black is a complaint about what they believed to be negative and inaccurate coverage blacks received from the paper.
The Post[tpl]'[/tpl]s coverage of the murder of Hasidic landlord Menachem Stark prompted outrage from Jewish communal leaders and public figures.

====Controversies====

There have been numerous controversies surrounding the Post:
The Post and the Daily News often take potshots at each other's work and accuracy, particularly in their respective gossip-page items.
In certain editions of the February 14, 2007, newspaper, an article referring to then-Senator Hillary Clinton's support base for her 2008 presidential run referred to then-Senator Barack Obama as "Osama";[tpl]cite news|url=http://empirezone.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/02/14/bill-snares-osama-guy-2/|title=Bill Snares Osama Guy|work=New York Times Blog|date=February 14, 2007|author=The Empire Zone|accessdate=June 7, 2007[/tpl] the paper realized its error and corrected it for the later editions and the website.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/02142007/news/nationalnews/bill_snares_obama_guy_nationalnews_maggie_haberman.htm|title=Bill snares Obama guy|work=New York Post|author=Maggie Haberman|date=February 14, 2007|accessdate=June 7, 2007[/tpl] The Post noted the error and apologized in the February 15, 2007, edition."CORRECTION", New York Post, February 15, 2007.

==Operations==

===Website===

In 1996, the Post launched an Internet version of the paper nypost.com. The original site included color photos and sections broken down into News, Sports, Editorial, Gossip, Entertainment and Business. It also had an archive for the past seven days. Since then, it has been redesigned a number of times, with the latest incarnation launched on September 6, 2009. In 2005 the website implemented a registration requirement but removed it in July 2006.
The current website also features continually updated breaking news; entertainment, business, and sports blogs; links to Page Six Magazine; photo and video galleries; original Post videos; user-submitted photos and comments; and streaming video for live events.

===Highlights[tpl]anchor|Page Six|Page 6[/tpl]===

The paper is well known for its sports section, which has been praised for its comprehensiveness; it begins on the back page, and among other coverage, contains columns about sports in the media by Phil Mushnick.
The Post is also well known for its gossip columnist Cindy Adams.
[tpl]anchor|Page Six|Page 6[/tpl]The best-known gossip section is "Page Six", created by James Brady[tpl]cite news|title=Obituaries in the news|work=Associated Press|date=January 27, 2009|accessdate=January 28, 2009|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/D/DEATHS?SITE=AP&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] and currently edited by Emily Smith (Although it no longer actually appears on page 6 of the tabloid). February 2006 saw the debut of Page Six Magazine, distributed free inside the paper. In September 2007, it started to be distributed weekly in the Sunday edition of the paper. In January 2009, publication of Page Six Magazine was cut to four times a year.

===Sales===

The daily circulation of the Post decreased in the final years of the Schiff era from 700,000 in the late 1960s[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] to approximately 418,000 by the time she sold the paper to Murdoch in 1976.[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2007[/tpl] Under Murdoch, the Post launched a morning edition to compete directly with the rival tabloid Daily News in 1978—prompting the Daily News to retaliate with a PM edition called Daily News Tonight. But the PM edition suffered the same problems with worsening daytime traffic that the afternoon Post experienced and the Daily News ultimately folded Tonight in 1981. By that time, circulation of the all-day Post soared to a peak of 962,000, the bulk of the increase attributed to its morning edition. But the Post lost so much money that Murdoch decided to shut down the Post's PM edition in 1982, turning the Post into a morning-only daily.
The Post and the Daily News have been locked in a bitter circulation war ever since. A resurgence during the first decade of the 21st century saw Post circulation rise to 724,748 by April 2007, achieved partly by lowering the price from 50 cents to 25 cents. In October 2006, the Post for the first time surpassed the Daily News in circulation—only to see the Daily News overtake its rival a few months later.Associated Press, "Newspaper circulation off 2.6%; some count Web readers", November 5, 2007. Accessed June 5, 2008. As of April 2010, the Post's daily circulation is 525,004, just 10,000 behind the Daily News.Audit Bureau of Circulation
Yet the Post has remained unprofitable since Murdoch first purchased it from Dorothy Schiff in 1976—and was on the brink of folding when Murdoch bought it back in 1993, with at least one media report in 2012 indicating that the Post loses up to $70 million a year.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/28/rupert-murdoch-wall-street-journal-news-corp_n_1635680.html|author=Michael Calderone|title=Rupert Murdoch Suggests Wall Street Journal Won't Face Cuts In News Corp. Split|work=Huffington Post|date=June 28, 2012[/tpl] One commentator has suggested that the Post cannot become profitable as long as the competing Daily News survives, and that Murdoch may be trying to force the Daily News to fold or sell out.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_08/b3921114_mz016.htm|author=Anthony Bianco|title=Profitless Paper in Relentless Pursuit|work=Business Week|date=February 21, 2005|accessdate=June 7, 2007[/tpl]

==Recent headquarters==

The 1906 Old New York Evening Post Building is a designated landmark.
From 1926, the newspaper's main office was at 75 West Street. In 1967, Schiff bought 210 South Street, the former headquarters of the New York Journal American, which closed a year earlier. The building became an instantly recognizable symbol for the Post. In 1995, owner Rupert Murdoch relocated the Post's news and business offices to the News Corporation headquarters tower at 1211 Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue) in midtown Manhattan. The Post shares this building with Fox News Channel and The Wall Street Journal, both of which are also owned by Murdoch. The Post and the New York City edition of the Journal are printed at a state-of-the-art printing plant in the borough of The Bronx.
