==Composition==

It is based on mayonnaise (egg yolk, mustard sauce and oil) with some extra ingredients. In the UK recipes typically add to the base capers, gherkins, lemon juice, and tarragon. US recipes may include chopped pickles or prepared green sweet relish, capers, onions (or chives), and fresh parsley. Chopped hard-boiled eggs or olives are sometimes added, as may be Dijon mustard.[tpl]cite book | title=Mastering the Art of French Cooking | year= 1961, 1983, 2001| publisher= Alfred A.

==History and etymology==

The sauce has been found in cookbooks since the 19th century. The name derives from the French sauce tartare, named after the Tatars from the Eurasian Steppe, who once occupied Ukraine and parts of Russia. Beyond this, the etymology is unclear.[tpl]Cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tartar |title=tartar | work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2 June 2012 |publisher=Douglas Harper|date=2001â€“2002[/tpl] In Europe, the sauce was used as condiment to steak tartare.[tpl]cite web|author=Craig J.
