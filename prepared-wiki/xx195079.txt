==Music, lyrics and music video==

"Je danse le Mia" (a play with the name of the band, IAM) was written and the music composed by IAM, which was composed of rappers Akhenaton, Shurik'n, and DJ Kheops.
It used a sample from George Benson's song, "Gimme the Night" (which was also used in 2005 by Jean Dujardin with his song "Le Casse de Brice"). This song, which has a "joyful, nostalgic and funky melody", is not representative of the musical universe of the group, which is traditionally characterized by "pessimistic texts" and "most slightly acid musics".Elia Habib, Muz hit. tubes, p. 288 (ISBN 2-9518832-0-X) Nevertheless, the real theme of the song is not dancing and nightclub, but the collapse of time represented by the nostalgia of eighties and dansehttp://volume.revues.org/1951 Rap songs analysis (French version)
