Arlington Assembly is a General Motors automobile factory in Arlington, Texas. The plant has operated for more than 60 years, and today manufactures only large and extended-size SUVs, and is currently the only GM SUV plant in the United States, as its plants in Janesville, Wisconsin and Silao, Mexico were closed down and consolidated its SUV production into the Arlington facility in 2009. 

==Operations History==

The Arlington plant was opened in 1954 to assemble both automobiles and aircraft, but has focused on the former use for most of its history. The factory was the site of assembly for many large GM cars, including the 1980s Chevrolet Monte Carlo, 1994-96 Chevrolet Impala SS, and late-model Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks. The plant occupies 250 acres (1,000,000 square meters).
Arlington Assembly was the last GM B-body manufacturing facility (having gained the work from the closed Ypsilanti, Michigan facility when GM decided to consolidate production) prior to GM ending rear-wheel drive production and converting the plant to SUV production. 
The light trucks that were produced at Arlington are now assembled at GM's Flint and Fort Wayne plants in the United States and at the Silao plant in Mexico.  

==Current vehicles produced==

Since December 2013, the Arlington Assembly manufactures large SUVs based on GM's GMT K2XX platform:
