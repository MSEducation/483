Here is a poem by Laurence Lerner  (not infringing copyright,  since submitted by the author,  who holds the copyright!)
Kaspar Hauser
All that long time there was the place I was,

All that long same, the dark and constant same.

I came to being and it bit my eyes.
I want to be a rider like my father.

A soldier was my father was a horseman.

I want to be a rider and I want
Out of that same he carried me upstairs,

Out of that dark and then I stood to lean;

The soft ground stood and hit me where I fell.
When it was hunger time they put soft life

Into my mouth. It moved. The warm flesh tore

Under my teeth. This could be me I'm eating.
I spat and called: I loved that time, those horses,

The brittle bread, the water, the soft dark,

The stiff floor always there, the always steady
Till I was carried to the bumpy world:

The air threw needles at my eyes. I fell.

Where were my walls, my horse to push, and where -
I want my floor my bread my dark my always -

I want the same the only same the only -

I want to be a rider like my father
