==History==

On December 20, 1938, the Johnson County Pack Horse Library was established, which is often considered the percursor to the modern Johnson County Public Library. The program was headquartered in a room in the historic Mayo Mansion and was operated by May Stafford. Stafford, along with many other women, circulated books throughout the county on horseback until the establishment of the Johnson County Public Library on February 3, 1947. It was housed in the former Paintsville Public Library Building until the 1960s when the library moved into its current location on Main Street in Paintsville.National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form for Paintsville Public Library Building 26 January 1989.
