[[Cremation]]

CATEGORIES: Cremation, Death customs, Incineration, Fire

Cremation is the use of high-temperature burning, vaporization, and oxidation to reduce dead animal or human bodies to basic chemical compounds, such as gases and mineral fragments retaining the appearance of dry bone.[tpl]cite journal| last=Matthews Cremation Division| title=Cremation Equipment Operator Training Program| pages=1| year=2006[/tpl]
Cremation may serve as a funeral or post-funeral rite that is an alternative to the interment of an intact dead body in a coffin or casket. Cremated remains, which do not constitute a health risk, may be buried or interred in memorial sites or cemeteries, or they may be retained by relatives and dispersed in various ways. Cremation is not an alternative to a funeral, but rather an alternative to burial or other forms of disposal.
In many countries, cremation is usually done in a crematorium. Some countries prefer different methods, such as open-air cremation in India and in Nepal.

==Modern cremation process==

The cremation occurs in a crematory that is housed within a crematorium and comprises one or more furnaces. A cremator is an industrial furnace that is able to generate temperatures of [tpl]convert|870|–|980|C|F|-1[/tpl] to ensure disintegration of the corpse. A crematorium may be part of a chapel or a funeral home or may be an independent facility or a service offered by a cemetery.
Modern cremator fuels include oil,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epd.gov.hk/eia/register/profile/latest/esb102.pdf|title=Project Profile of re-provisioning of Diamond Hill Crematorium.|publisher=Environmental Protection Department, Hong Kong|accessdate=2011-04-05[/tpl] natural gas, propane, and, in some areas like Hong Kong, coal gas.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.epd.gov.hk/eia/register/report/eiareport/eia_0632001/EX-SUM/html/Ex-Sum03.htm|title=Proposed replacement of cremators at Fu Shan Crematorium, Shatin.|publisher=Environmental Protection Department, Hong Kong|accessdate=2011-04-05[/tpl] However, coal and coke were used until the early 1960s.
Modern cremators have adjustable-control systems that monitor the furnace during cremation. These systems automatically monitor the interior to tell when the cremation process is complete (this can only be assessed by a cremator operator: the controls can tell you that the process has progressed to an advanced stage but only an operator with experience can say a cremation is complete due to issues such as stubborn cancerous tissues remaining unfinished for example), after which the furnace automatically shuts down. The time required for cremation varies from body to body, and, in modern furnaces, the process may be as fast as one hour per 45 kg (100 lb) of body weight.
A cremator is not designed to cremate more than one human body at a time; cremation of multiple bodies is illegal in the United States and many other countries. Exceptions may be made in special cases, such as with still-born twins or with a still-born baby and a mother who died during childbirth. In such cases, the bodies must be cremated in the same container.
The chamber where the body is placed is called a retort and is lined with heat-resistant refractory bricks. Refractory bricks are designed in several layers. The outermost layer is usually simply an insulation material, e.g., mineral wool. Inside is typically a layer of insulation brick, mostly calcium silicate in nature. Heavy duty cremators are usually designed with two layers of fire bricks inside the insulation layer. The layer of fire bricks in contact with the combustion process protects the outer layer and is required to be replaced from time to time.[tpl]citation|format=book|author=Schacht, Charles A.|title=Refractories Handbook|publisher=Marcel Dekker |year=2004[/tpl]  The coffin or container is inserted (charged) into the retort as quickly as possible to avoid heat loss through the top door. The container may be mounted on a charger (motorised trolley) that can quickly insert it, or on a fixed or movable hopper that allows the container to slide into the cremator.
Modern cremators are computer-controlled to ensure legal and safe use.  For example, the retort door cannot be opened until the cremator has reached its operating temperature, and United States federal regulations16 C.F.R. 453 not in citation require that newly constructed cremators feature dual electrical and mechanical heat-shutoff switches and door releases that are accessible from inside the retort.  Refractory bricks are typically replaced every five years, because thermal fatigue gradually introduces fissures that reduce the insulating strength. For heavy duty cremators having an inner sacrificial layer of refractory material, often cracks, slagging, bulging and dislocation can be seen on this layer shortly after the cremator is put into use. Such cracks and fracture need not be disastrous, as this lining is sacrificial in nature — it may just result in the development of a crack pattern in the lining. Those crack surfaces may be held together and closed by the lining compressive stresses that develop from thermal expansion when the cremator is heated to operating temperatures.  However, the inner sacrificial lining needs to be replaced on a regular basis to offer proper protection to the outer layers.
Some crematoria allow relatives to view the charging. This is sometimes done for religious reasons, such as in traditional Hindu and Jain funerals.[tpl]cite book| last = Carlson| first = Lisa| title = Caring for the Dead| year = 1997| publisher = Upper Access, Inc.| isbn = 0-942679-21-0| page = 78 [/tpl]
The size of most cremators is standardized.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]Typically, larger cities have access to an oversized cremator that can handle corpse in the [tpl]convert|200|kg|lb[/tpl]+ range.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl] Most large crematoria have small cremators installed for the cremation of fetal and infant remains.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2013[/tpl]

===Body container===

In the United States federal law does not dictate any container requirements for cremation. Certain states however may require an opaque or non-transparent container of all cremations. This can be a simple corrugated-cardboard box or a wooden casket (coffin). Most casket manufacturers provide lines of caskets that are specially built for cremation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] Another option is a cardboard box that fits inside a wooden shell, which is designed to look like a traditional casket. After the funeral service, the box is removed from the shell before cremation, permitting the shell to be re-used.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] Funeral homes may also offer rental caskets, which are traditional caskets used only during the services, after which the bodies are transferred to other containers for cremation.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] Rental caskets are sometimes designed with removable beds and liners, which are replaced after each use.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
In the United Kingdom, the body is not removed from the coffin and is not placed into a container as described above.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] The body is cremated with the coffin, which is why all British coffins that are to be used for cremation must be combustible. The Code of Cremation Practice forbids the opening of the coffin once it has arrived at the crematorium, and rules stipulate that it must be cremated within 72 hours of the funeral service.Code of Cremation Practice, Doncaster: Cemeteries, Crematorium, retrieved 26 November 2009 Therefore, in the United Kingdom, bodies are cremated in the same coffin that they are placed in at the undertaker's, although the regulations allow the use of an approved "cover" during the funeral service. It is recommended that jewellery be removed before the coffin is sealed, for this reason. When cremation is finished, the remains are passed through a magnetic field to remove any metal, which will be interred elsewhere in the crematorium grounds or, increasingly, recycled.[tpl]cite news|title=Melting down hips and knees: The afterlife of implants|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16877393|work=BBC News|accessdate=21 February 2012|date=2012-02-21[/tpl] The ashes are then given to relatives or loved ones or scattered in the crematorium grounds where facilities exist.http://www.westhertscrem.org/choosingafinalrestingplace.asp retrieved 26 November 2009
In Germany, the process is mostly similar to that of the United Kingdom. The body is cremated in the coffin. A piece of fire clay with a number on it is used for identifying the remains of the dead body after burning.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-rechtsprechung.sh.juris.de/jportal/portal/t/jww/page/bsshoprod.psml?pid=Dokumentanzeige&showdoccase=1&js_peid=Trefferliste&documentnumber=1&numberofresults=1&fromdoctodoc=yes&doc.id=jlr-BestattGSH2005V1IVZ&doc.part=X&doc.price=0.0#jlr-BestattGSH2005pP17|title=Gesetz über das Leichen-, Bestattungs- und Friedhofswesen des Landes Schleswig-Holstein (Bestattungsgesetz - BestattG) vom 4. Februar 2005, §17 Abs. 4|publisher=Ministerium für Justiz, Gleichstellung und Integration|accessdate=2011-07-06[/tpl]  The remains are then placed in a container called an ash capsule, which generally is put into a cinerary urn.
In Australia, the deceased is cremated in a coffin supplied by the undertaker.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] Reusable or cardboard coffins are becoming popular, with several manufacturers now supplying them.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl] For low cost, a plain, particle-board coffin (known in the trade as a "chippie") can be used. Handles (if fitted) are plastic and approved for use in a cremator. Coffins vary from natural cardboard and unfinished particle board (covered with a velvet pall if there is a service) to solid timber; most are veneered particle board.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]
Cremations can be "delivery only", with no preceding chapel service at the crematorium (although a church service may have been held) or preceded by a service in one of the crematorium chapels. Delivery-only allows crematoria to schedule cremations to make best use of the cremators, perhaps by holding the body overnight in a refrigerator, allowing a lower fee to be charged. Delivery-only is sometimes called west chapel service in industry jargon.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2009[/tpl]

The box containing the body is placed in the retort and incinerated at a temperature of 760 to 1150 °C (1400 to 2100 °F). During the cremation process, the greater portion of the body (especially the organs and other soft tissues) is vaporized and oxidized by the intense heat; gases released are discharged through the exhaust system. The process usually takes 90 minutes to two hours, with larger bodies taking longer time.[tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]
Jewellery, such as necklaces, wrist-watches and rings, are ordinarily removed before cremation, and returned to the family. Several implanted devices are required to be removed.  A pacemaker could explode and damage the cremator and potentially staff nearby; spinal cord stimulators have similar power sources, and implanted drug reservoirs may produce lesser bangs.  A specific variety of bone nail use in the femur and humerus is a hollow shell which is inflated with saline under high pressure to grip the interior of the bone, and constitutes a bomb in the cremator.  In the United Kingdom, and possibly other countries, the undertaker is required to remove such devices prior to delivering the body to the crematorium, and sign a declaration stating that no hazardous device remains in place.[ref]
In the Netherlands this is also done by either the undertaker or the hospital where the person died.

Contrary to popular belief, the cremated remains are not ashes in the usual sense. After the incineration is completed, the dry bone fragments are swept out of the retort and pulverised by a machine called a Cremulator — essentially a high-capacity, high-speed blender — to process them into "ashes" or "cremated remains","Cremulator" is a trademark of DWF Europe. although pulverisation may also be performed by hand. This leaves the bone with a fine sand like texture and color, able to be scattered without need for mixing with any foreign matter,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.patents.com/Pulverizer-cremated-remains/US4621774/en-US/|title=Pulveriser for Cremated Remains|date=November 11, 1986|accessdate=2008-11-12[/tpl] though the size of the grain varies depending on the Cremulator used. Their weight is approximately [tpl]convert|4|lb|kg[/tpl] for adult human females and [tpl]convert|6|lb|kg[/tpl] for adult human males. There are various types of Cremulators, including rotating devices, grinders, and older models using heavy metal balls.[tpl]cite encyclopedia| last = Davies| first = Douglas J.| coauthors = Mates, Lewis H.| year = 2005| encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Cremation| title = Cremulation| pages = 152| publisher = Ashgate Publishing| isbn = 0-7546-3773-5[/tpl]
The grinding process typically takes about 20 minutes. [tpl]See also|ball mill[/tpl]
In a Japanese funeral and in Taiwan, the bones are not pulverised, unless requested beforehand.  When not pulverised, the bones are collected by the family and stored as one might do with ashes.
The appearance of cremated remains after grinding is one of the reasons they are called ashes, although a non-technical term sometimes used is "cremains",Carlson, p. 80[ref]
[tpl]cite book| last = Sublette| first = Kathleen| coauthors = Flagg, Martin| title = Final Celebrations: A Guide for Personal and Family Funeral Planning| year = 1992| publisher = Pathfinder Publishing| isbn = 0-934793-43-3| pages = 52 [/tpl][/ref] a portmanteau of "cremated" and "remains". (The Cremation Association of North America prefers that the word "cremains" not be used for referring to "human cremated remains." The reason given is that "cremains" is thought to have less connection with the deceased, whereas a loved one's "cremated remains" has a more identifiable human connection.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cremationassociation.org/?page=AboutCANA|title=Cremation Association of North America - About CANA|year=2008|accessdate=2008-11-13[/tpl])
After final grinding, the ashes are placed in a container, which can be anything from a simple cardboard box to a decorative urn. The default container used by most crematoriums, when nothing more expensive has been selected, is usually a hinged, snap-locking plastic box.
An unavoidable consequence of cremation is that a tiny residue of bodily remains is left in the chamber after cremation and mixes with subsequent cremations.

===Ash weight and composition===

Cremated remains are mostly dry calcium phosphates with some minor minerals, such as salts of sodium and potassium. Sulfur and most carbon are driven off as oxidized gases during the process, although a relatively small amount of carbon may remain as carbonate.
The ash remaining represents very roughly 3.5% of the body's original mass (2.5% in children). Because the weight of dry bone fragments is so closely connected to skeletal mass, their weight varies greatly from person to person. Because many changes in body composition (such as fat and muscle loss or gain) do not affect the weight of cremated remains, the weight of the remains can be more closely predicted from the person's height and sex (which predicts skeletal weight), than it can be predicted from the person's simple weight.
Ashes of adults can be said to weigh from [tpl]convert|4|lb|kg[/tpl] to [tpl]convert|6|lb|kg[/tpl], but the first figure is roughly the figure for women, and the second, for men. The mean weight of adult cremated remains in a Florida, U.S. sample was 5.3 lb (approx. 2.4 kg) for adults (range [tpl]convert|2|to|8|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]). This was found to be distributed bimodally according to sex, with the mean being [tpl]convert|6|lb|kg[/tpl] for men (range [tpl]convert|4|to|8|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]) and [tpl]convert|4|lb|kg[/tpl] for women (range [tpl]convert|2|to|6|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=or[/tpl]). In this sample, generally all adult cremated remains over [tpl]convert|6|lb|kg[/tpl] were from males, and those under [tpl]convert|4|lb|kg[/tpl] were from females.[tpl]cite journal| last=Warren| first=M| coauthors=Maples, W| title=The anthropometry of contemporary commercial cremation| journal=Journal of Forensic Science| volume=42| issue=3| pages=417–423| year=1997| pmid=9144931[/tpl]
Not all that remains is bone. There may be melted metal lumps from missed jewellery; casket furniture; dental fillings; and surgical implants, such as hip replacements. Large items such as titanium hip replacements (which tarnish but do not melt) or casket hinges are usually removed before processing, as they may damage the processor. (If they are missed at first, they must ultimately be removed before processing is complete, as items such as titanium joint replacements are far too durable to be ground). Implants may be returned to the family, but are more commonly sold as ferrous/non-ferrous scrap metal. After the remains are processed, smaller bits of metal such as tooth fillings, and rings (commonly known as gleanings) are sieved out and may be later interred in common, consecrated ground in a remote area of the cemetery. They may also be sold as precious metal scrap.

==Methods of keeping or disposing of the cremated remains==

Cremated remains are returned to the next of kin in different manners according to custom and country. In the US, almost always the cremated remains are contained primarily in a thick watertight polyethylene plastic bag contained within a hard snap-top rectangular plastic container, which is labeled with a printed paper label. The basic sealed plastic container bag may be contained within a further cardboard box or velvet sack, or they may be contained within an urn if the family had already purchased one. An official certificate of cremation prepared under the authority of the crematorium accompanies the remains, and if required by law, the permit for disposition of human remains, which must remain with the cremated remains.
Cremated remains can be kept in an urn, stored in a special memorial building (columbarium), buried in the ground at many locations or sprinkled on a special field, mountain, or in the sea. In addition, there are several services in which the cremated remains will be scattered in a variety of ways and locations. Some examples are via a helium balloon, through fireworks, shot from shotgun shells, by boat[tpl]cite web|title=Scattering Ashes by boat|url=http://www.frenchbrothers.co.uk/private-hire/ashes-scattering|publisher=FrenchBrothersLtd|accessdate=12 December 2013[/tpl]  or scattered from an aeroplane. One service sends a lipstick-tube sized sample of the cremated remains into low earth orbit, where they remain for years (but not permanently) before re-entering the atmosphere. Another company claims to turn part of the cremated remains into synthetic diamonds that can then be made into jewelry. Cremated remains may also be incorporated, with urn and cement, into part of an artificial reef, or they can also be mixed into paint and made into a portrait of the deceased. Some individuals use a very small amount of the remains in tattoo ink, for remembrance portraits. The creator of Frisbee as his dying wish had his remains incorporated into a stock of the discs, to live on forever with his favorite sport. Cremated remains can be scattered in national parks in the U.S. with a special permit. They can also be scattered on private property with the owner's permission. A portion of the cremated remains may be retained in a specially designed locket known as cremation jewelry, or even blown into a special glass keepsake.http://www.solsticeglass.com/solstice-glass-info/faq.html The cremated remains may also be entombed. Most cemeteries will grant permission for burial of cremated remains in occupied cemetery plots that have already been purchased or are in use by the families disposing of the cremated remains without any additional charge or oversight. The possibilities are as limitless as the individuals who are being remembered.
The final disposition depends on the personal wishes of the deceased as well as their cultural and religious beliefs. Some religions will permit the cremated remains to be sprinkled or kept at home. Some religions, such as Roman Catholicism, insist on either burying or entombing the remains. Hinduism obliges the closest male relative (son, grandson, etc.) of the deceased to immerse the cremated remains in the holy river Ganges, preferably at the holy city of Triveni Sangam, Allahabad, or Varanasi or Haridwar, India. The Sikhs immerse the remains in Sutlej, usually at Sri Harkiratpur. In southern India, the ashes are immersed in the river Kaveri at Paschima vahini in Srirangapattana at a stretch where the river flows from east to west, depicting the life of a human being from sunrise to sunset. In Japan and Taiwan, the remaining bone fragments are given to the family and are used in a burial ritual before final interment. [tpl]further|Japanese funeral[/tpl]

==Reasons for choosing cremation==

Apart from religious reasons (discussed below), some people find they prefer cremation to traditional burial for personal reasons. The thought of a long, slow decomposition process is unappealing to some;[tpl]cite book| last = Aiken| first = Lewis R.| title = Dying, Death, and Bereavement| year = 2000| publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates| isbn = 0-8058-3504-0| pages = 131 [/tpl] many people find that they prefer cremation because it disposes of the body immediately.Sublette & Flagg, p. 53
Other people view cremation as a way of simplifying their funeral process. These people view a ground burial as an unneeded complication of their funeral process, and thus choose cremation to make their services as simple as possible.
In agriculturally dependent countries such as India, it was realized quite early that burial led to the bodies rotting and very soon, the soil around the region would become infertile.[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] This is why cremation was preferred initially, even before it was introduced into the Rigveda.
The cost factor tends to make cremation attractive. Generally speaking, cremation is cheaper than traditional burial services, especially if direct cremation is chosen, in which the body is cremated as soon as legally possible without any sort of services. However, for some even cremation is still relatively expensive, especially as a lot of fuel is required to perform it. Methods to reduce fuel consumption/fuel cost include the use of different fuels (i.e. gas, compared to wood) and by using an incinerator (closed cabin) rather than an open fire.Mokshda green cremation system
Cremated remains can be scattered or buried. Cremation plots or columbarium niches are usually cheaper than a traditional burial plot or mausoleum crypt, and require less space. Some religions, such as Roman Catholicism, require the burial or entombment of cremated remains, but burial of cremated remains may often be accomplished in the burial plot of another person, such as a family member, without any additional cost. This option is charged for in England in an Anglican church where the fee is set by the Table of Parochial Fees (£36 to incumbent and £78 to church council) a total of £114 in 2010 with a marker charged as extra. It is also very common to scatter the remains in a place which was liked by the deceased such as the sea, a river, a beach, a park, or mountains, following their last will. This is generally forbidden in public places but very easy to do. Some persons choose to have a small part of their ashes (usually less than 1 part in 1000, because of cost constraints) scattered in space (known as space burial and offered by companies such as Elysium Space and Celestis). Cremated remains can now also be converted to diamonds.

==Environmental impact==

Cremation might be preferable for environmental reasons. Burial is a known source of certain environmental contaminants, with the coffin itself being the major contaminant, however in some countries e.g. the UK, legislations now requires that cremators are fitted with abatement equipment (filters) that remove serious pollutants such as mercury. Other practical approaches such as using cremators for longer periods and not cremating on the same day as the coffin is received reduces the use of fossil fuel and hence reduces carbon emissions.  Cremation is therefore becoming more friendly toward the environment.[tpl]cite journal | last = Spongberg | first = Alison L. | coauthors = Becks, Paul M. |date=January 2000 | title = Inorganic Soil Contamination from Cemetery Leachate | journal = Water, Air, & Soil Pollution | volume = 117 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 313–327 | doi = 10.1023/A:1005186919370 | url =[/tpl] though natural burials are also possible. One funeral and crematorium owner, based in Australia, offers a carbon neutral funeral service incorporating efficient-burning coffins made from lightweight recycled composite board.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.carbonneutral.com.au/images/pdf/invocare.pdf |publisher=carbonneutral.com.au| title= Funeral Industry Case Study[/tpl]
Another environmental concern is that traditional burial takes up a great deal of space. In a traditional burial, the body is buried in a casket made from a variety of materials. In the United States, the casket is often placed inside a concrete vault or liner before burial in the ground. While individually this may not take much room, combined with other burials, it can over time cause serious space concerns. Many cemeteries, particularly in Japan[tpl]cite book| last = Shimizu| first = Louise Picon| coauthors = Maruyama, Meredith Enman; Tsurumaki, Nancy Smith| title = Japan Health Handbook| year = 1998| publisher = Kodansha International| isbn = 4-7700-2356-1| pages = 335| quote = Not only is cremation of the body and [tpl]sic|internment|expected=interment[/tpl] of the ashes in an urn a long-standing Buddhist practice, it is also a highly practical idea today, given the scarcity of burial space in crowded modern Japan. [/tpl]
and Europe as well as those in larger cities, have run out of permanent space. In Tokyo, for example, traditional burial plots are extremely scarce and expensive,[tpl]cite book| last = Furse| first = Raymond| title = Japan: An Invitation| year = 2002| publisher = Tuttle Publishing| isbn = 0-8048-3319-2| pages = 73| quote = and prices so high that a burial plot in Tokyo a mere 21 feet square could easily cost $150,000. [/tpl] and in London, a space crisis led Harriet Harman to propose reopening old graves for "double-decker" burials.[tpl]cite news | title = Double burials in UK cemeteries to solve space shortage | last = Land | first = John | work = 24dash.com | date = 2006-05-30 | url = http://www.24dash.com/content/news/viewNews.php?navID=2&newsID=6290 | accessdate = 2007-07-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070926234849/http://www.24dash.com/content/news/viewNews.php?navID=2&newsID=6290  |archivedate = 2007-09-26[/tpl]
Some cities in Germany do not have plots for sale, only for lease. When the lease expires the remains are disinterred and a specialist bundles the bones, inscribes the forehead of skull with the information that was on the headstone, and places the remains in a special crypt.

==Religious views on cremation==

===Hinduism and other Indian origin religions===

Religions such as Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism and Buddhism, mandate cremation. In these religions, the body is seen as an instrument to carry the soul. Many examples are in the Bhagavad Gita.
According to Hindu traditions, the reasons for preferring to destroy the corpse by fire, over burying it into ground, is to induce a feeling of detachment into the freshly disembodied spirit, which will be helpful to encourage it into passing to its next destination, lest it remain near its former body.[tpl]cite book| author = Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami| title = Living With Siva: Hinduism's Contemporary Culture| year = 2001| publisher = Himalayan Academy| isbn = 0-945497-98-9| page = 750 [/tpl] Hindus have 16 rites of passage (Saṃskāra); i.e. A Hindu undergoes 16 rituals during their lifetime, like Naming ceremony, Thread ceremony: beginning of student life, Marriage, etc., and the last being cremation. Cremation is referred to as antim-sanskara, literally meaning "the last rites." At the time of the cremation or "last rites," a "Puja" (prayer) is performed. The holy text of Rigveda, one of the oldest Hindu scriptures, has many Ruchas (also written and pronounced as Richas) (small poems) related to cremation, which state that Lord Agni (God of Fire) will purify the dead body, also known as the Parthiv one of the 5? types of fire.
Open air cremations are becoming less frequent in urban areas. There are crematoriums in most major cities, which are in effect indoor electric or gas based furnaces. Most cremations take place in these indoor crematoriums.Example of a modern indoor Electric crematorium in Surat, India. ArchiTextureZ.net.
In Hinduism, during cremation the eldest son, the adopted son, or the younger brother put first fire on the dead person's body. Bodies of holy men are however sometimes buried or sunk in rivers and children are buried not cremated.Flood, Gavin: Rites of Passage, in: Bowen, Paul (1998). Themes and issues in Hinduism. Cassell, London. ISBN 0-304-33851-6. pp. 270.
The act of sati is when widowed women throw themselves onto their husband's funeral pyre. This practice has its origin in a legend in which the goddess Sati self-immolated because she was unable to bear her father  Daksha's humiliation of her (living) husband Shiva. By 10th CE, this tradition had gained foothold in Indian subcontinent and was spreading. This practice was made illegal in 1829.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5273336.stm |title=South Asia | India wife dies on husband's pyre |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-08-22 |accessdate=2010-04-23[/tpl] After gaining independence from British colonial era, India passed a series of additional laws. The Prevention of Sati Act of India makes it a criminal act to support, watch, allow, glorify Sati; the crime is punishable by life imprisonment, while glorifying Sati is punishable with 1–7 years in prison. The law also allows for seizure of the property, organization, temple and assets used to attempt or allow Sati.Sati Prevention Act Ministry of Law, Government of India In modern India, the last known case of Sati was in 1987, by Roop Kanwar in Rajasthan. Her action was found to be a suicide, and it led to the arrest and prosecution of people for failing to act and prevent her suicide during her husband's cremation.Uproar over Rajput Sati Hinduism Today Archives (December 1987)Gerald James Larson, Religion and Personal Law in Secular India: A Call to Judgment, ISBN 978-0253214805, Indiana University Press

====Bali====

Balinese Hindu dead are generally buried for a period of time, which may exceed one month or more, so that the cremation ceremony (Ngaben) can occur on an auspicious day in the Balinese-Javanese Calendar system ("Saka"). Additionally, if the departed was a court servant, member of the court or minor noble, the cremation can be postponed up to several years to coincide with the cremation of their Prince. Balinese funerals are very expensive and the body may be interred until the family can afford it or until there is a group funeral planned by the village or family when costs will be less. The purpose of burying the corpse is for the decay process to consume the fluids of the corpse, which allows for an easier, more rapid and more complete cremation.

===Christianity===

In Christian countries and cultures, cremation has historically been discouraged, but now in many denominations it is accepted.[tpl]cite book|last1=Gassmann|first1=Günther|last2=Larson|first2=Duane H.|last3=Oldenburg|first3=Mark W.|title=Historical Dictionary of Lutheranism|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Htz8M1Xlqi4C&pg=PA48|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=4 April 2001|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English |isbn=9780810866201|page=48|quote=Cremation was unheard of from the time Charlemagne outlawed it (784) until the 17th century. At that point, the practice was urged primarily by those opposed to the church, and for a long time cremation was forbidden by Roman Catholicism and practiced only reluctantly by Protestants. Recently, these strictures have eased, and more and more churches have established columbaria or memorial gardens within their precincts for the reception of the ashes by the faithful.[/tpl]

====Catholicism====

Christians preferred to bury the dead rather than to cremate the remains, as was common in Greek and Roman culture. The Roman catacombs and veneration of relics of saints witness to this preference. For them, the body was not a mere receptacle for a spirit that was the real person, but an integral part of the human person.Robert Pasnau, in the introduction to his translation of Summa Theologiae, says that Aquinas is "quite clear in rejecting the sort of substance dualism proposed by Plato ... which goes so far as to identify human beings with their souls alone, as if the body were a kind of clothing that we put on," and that Aquinas believed that "we are a composite of soul and body, that a soul all by itself would not be a human being."

The idea that cremation might interfere with God's ability to resurrect the body was refuted as early as the Octavius of Minucius Felix, in which he said: "Every body, whether it is dried up into dust, or is dissolved into moisture, or is compressed into ashes, or is attenuated into smoke, is withdrawn from us, but it is reserved for God in the custody of the elements. Nor, as you believe, do we fear any loss from sepulture, but we adopt the ancient and better custom of burying in the earth."The full text of Octavius is available online from ccel.org. See also Davies & Mates, p. 107-108. And while there was a clear preference for burial, there was no general Church law forbidding cremation until 1866. Even in Medieval Europe, cremation was practiced in situations where there were multitudes of corpses simultaneously present, such as after a battle, after a pestilence or famine, and where there was an imminent fear of diseases spreading from the corpses, since individual burials with digging graves would take too long and body decomposition would begin before all the corpses had been interred.
Beginning in the Middle Ages, and even more so in the 18th century and later, rationalists and classicists began to advocate cremation again as a statement denying the resurrection and/or the afterlife,Prothero, p. 74-75 although the pro-cremation movement more often than not took care to address and refute theological concerns about cremation in their works.Prothero, p. 74. Sentiment within the Catholic Church against cremation became hardened in the face of the association of cremation with "professed enemies of God." When some Masonic groups advocated cremation as a means of rejecting Christian belief in the resurrection, the Holy See forbade Catholics to practice cremation in 1886. The 1917 Code of Canon Law incorporated this ban, but in 1963, recognizing that, in general, cremation was being sought for practical purposes and not as a denial of bodily resurrection, the choice of cremation was permitted in many circumstances.McNamara, "Mixing Ashes of the Dead"English translation of the instruction Piam et constantem The current 1983 Code of Canon Law, states: "The Church earnestly recommends the pious custom of burial be retained; but it does not forbid cremation, unless this is chosen for reasons which are contrary to Christian teaching."Code of Canon Law, canon 1176 §3; cf.  Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2301.
There are no universal rules governing Catholic funeral rites in connection with cremation, but episcopal conferences have laid down rules for various countries. Of these, perhaps the most elaborate are those established, with the necessary confirmation of the Holy See, by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and published as Appendix II of the United States edition of the Order of Christian Funerals."Liturgical Norms on Cremation" by the Congregation for Divine Worship: Order of Christian Funerals, Appendix 2, "Cremation"USCCB Committee on Divine Worship, "Cremation and the Order of Christian Funerals"
Although the Holy See has in some cases authorized bishops to grant permission for funeral rites to be carried out in the presence of cremated remains, it is preferred that the rites be carried out before cremation, in the presence of the still intact body. Practices that show insufficient respect for the ashes of the dead such as turning them into jewelry or scattering them are forbidden for Catholics.

====Anglicanism and Lutheranism====

In 1917, Volume 6 of the American Lutheran Survey stated that "The Lutheran clergy as a rule refuse" and that "Episcopal pastors often take a stand against it."[tpl]cite journal|date=12 September 1917|title=Many Minds of Many Men|journal=American Lutheran Survey|publisher=Lutheran Survey Publishing Company|location=Columbia|volume=6|page=658[/tpl] Indeed, in the 1870s, the Anglican Bishop of London stated that the practice of cremation would "undermine the faith of mankind in the doctrine of the resurrection of the body, and so bring about a most disastrous social revolution."[tpl]cite journal|year=1874|title=Contemporary Sayings|journal=Appleton's Journal of Literature, Science, and Art|publisher=D. Appleton and Company|location=New York|issue=276-301[/tpl] In The Lutheran Pastor, George Henry Gerberding stated: 
[tpl]quotation|As to cremation, This is not a Biblical or Christian mode of disposing of the dead. The Old and New Testament agree and take for granted that as the body was taken originally from the earth, so it is to return to the earth again. Burial is the natural and Christian mode. There is a beautiful symbolism in it. The whole terminology of eschatology presupposes it. Cremation is purely heathenish. it was the practice among the Greeks and Romans. The mass of the Hindoos thus dispose of their dead. It is dishonoring to the body, intended for a temple of the Holy Ghost and to bear the image of God. It is an insidious denial of the doctrine of the resurrection.[tpl]cite book|last=Gerberding|first=George Henry|title=The Lutheran Pastor|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-PXjhCaHqUQC&pg=PA363|accessdate=22 April 2014|year=1902|publisher=Lutheran Publication Society|page=363[/tpl][/tpl]
However, Protestant churches welcomed  the use of cremation at a much earlier date than the Catholic Church; pro-cremation sentiment was not unanimous among Protestants, however.Prothero, p. 77. The first crematoria in the Protestant countries were built in 1870s, and in 1908, the Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey—one of the most famous Anglican churches—required that remains be cremated for burial in the abbey's precincts.Davies & Mates, "Westminster Abbey", p. 423. Today, "scattering", or "strewing," is an acceptable practice in many Protestant denominations, and some churches have their own "garden of remembrance" on their grounds in which remains can be scattered. Other groups also support cremation. Some denominations, like Lutheran churches in Scandinavia, favour the urns being buried in family graves. A family grave can contain urns of many generations and also the urns of spouses and loved ones.

====Eastern Orthodox and others who forbid cremation====

On the other hand, some branches of Christianity oppose cremation, including some minority Protestant groups and Orthodox.[tpl]cite web|title=CREMATION: What does God think?|url=http://www.wayoflife.org/fbns/cremation.htm|first=David|last=Cloud|accessdate = 2007-02-03|publisher=Way of Life Literature|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070124134414/http://www.wayoflife.org/fbns/cremation.htm  |archivedate=2007-01-24[/tpl] Most notably, the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches forbid cremation. Exceptions are made for circumstances where it may not be avoided (when civil authority demands it, or epidemics) or if it may be sought for good cause, but when a cremation is willfully chosen for no good cause by the one who is deceased, he or she is not permitted a funeral in the church and may also be permanently excluded from liturgical prayers for the departed. In Orthodoxy, cremation is a rejection of the dogma of the general resurrection, and as such is viewed harshly.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.3saints.com/cremation.html|title=On Cremation|accessdate=2007-02-03[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/death/cremation.aspx|title=Cremation|first=Protopresbyter George|last=Grabbe| accessdate=2007-02-03[/tpl]

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) has, in past decades, discouraged cremation without expressly forbidding it. In the 1950s, for example, Apostle Bruce R. McConkieMcConkie, Bruce R. Mormon Doctrine, A Compendium of the Gospel, 1958 wrote that "only under the most extraordinary and unusual circumstances" would cremation be consistent with LDS teachings.
However, more recent LDS publications have provided instructions for how to dress the deceased when they have received their temple endowments (and thus wear temple garments) prior to cremation for those wishing to do so, or in countries where the law requires cremation. Except where required by law, the family of the deceased may decide whether the body should be cremated, though the Church "does not normally encourage cremation."Church Handbook of Instructions, Book 2 (2010). The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, pp 81,183-84.

====Jehovah's Witnesses====

Jehovah's Witnesses publications have stated, "Cremation is not condemned by Jehovah. ...Something that might influence a person’s decisions in making these arrangements, however, is the way that the local community views funeral customs. Those who abide by Bible principles would certainly not want to do anything that would cause unnecessary offense to their neighbors.""Should You Object to Cremation?", Awake!, March 2009, page 11 (Watchtower Online library)

===Judaism===

Judaism traditionally disapproved of cremation in the past (it was the traditional means of disposing the dead in the neighboring Bronze Age cultures). It has also disapproved of preservation of the dead by means of embalming and mummifying,[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.vbs.org/religious/shailos.htm| title = SHAILOS & TSUVAS: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS| first = Harold M.| last = Schulweis| quote = Judaism is a tradition which affirms life.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, as the Jewish cemeteries in many European towns had become crowded and were running out of space, cremation became an approved means of corpse disposal amongst the Liberal Jews. Current liberal movements like Reform Judaism still support cremation, although burial remains the preferred option.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.reformjudaism.org.uk/faqs/life-cycle-events/cremation.html| title = Cremation| last = Rothschild| first = Rabbi Walter| quote = We have no ideological conflict with the custom which is now popularly accepted by many as clean and appropriate to modern conditions.| accessdate = 2007-02-03|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061010034033/http://www.reformjudaism.org.uk/faqs/life-cycle-events/cremation.html  |archivedate = 2006-10-10[/tpl]
The Orthodox Jews have maintained a stricter line on cremation, and disapprove of it as Halakha (Jewish law) forbids it. This halakhic concern is grounded in the upholding of bodily resurrection as a core belief of traditional Judaism, as opposed to other ancient trends such as the Sadduccees, who denied it. Conservative Jewish groups also oppose cremation.[ref]

Some secular Jews may reject cremation perhaps in reaction to the Holocaust, in which the Jewish victims of Nazi genocide were disposed of by cremation at the death camps. At many former Nazi death camps, mounds of ashes are present beneath a shallow layer of dirt.[tpl]Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2013[/tpl]
In Israel there were no formal crematories until 2007 when B&L Cremation Systems Inc. became the first crematory manufacturer to sell a retort to Israel. In August 2007, the predominantly orthodox ZAKA members in Israel were accused of burning down a secret crematorium.[ref]

===Other===

====Baha'i====

The Baha'i Faith forbids cremation, "He feels that, in view of what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has said against cremation, the believers should be strongly urged, as an act of faith, to make provisions against their remains being cremated. Bahá’u’lláh has laid down as a law, in the Aqdas, the manner of Bahá’í burial, and it is so beautiful, befitting and dignified, that no believer should deprive himself of it."

====Zoroastrianism====

Traditionally, Zoroastrianism disavows cremation or burial to preclude pollution of fire or earth. The traditional method of corpse disposal is through ritual exposure in a "Tower of Silence", but both burial and cremation are increasingly popular alternatives. Some contemporary adhererents of the faith have opted for cremation. Parsi-Zoroastrian singer Freddie Mercury of the group Queen was cremated after his death.

====China====

Neo-Confucianism under Zhou Xi strongly discourages cremation of one's parents' corpses as unfilial.
Traditionally, Buddhist monks in China exclusively practiced cremation because other Chinese detest cremation, refusing to do it. But now, the atheist Communist party enforces a strict cremation policy on Han Chinese. However, exceptions are made for Hui who do not cremate their dead due to Islamic beliefs.[tpl]cite book| author = Richard V.

==Pet Cremation==

Pet cremation is practiced internationally. For example, in Japan, more than 465 companion animal temples are in operation and they hold funerals and rituals for their lost pets. Although in current-day Australia, pet owners could purchase services to have their companion animal cremated and placed in a pet cemetery or taken home. They can also have them come to remove the animals body from the home themselves to take to a crematorium to be cremated.Chur-Hansen, Anna. "Cremation Services Upon The Death Of A Companion Animal: Views Of Service Providers And Service Users." Society & Animals 19.3 (2011): 248-260. Academic Search Premier. Web. 16 Sept. 2013.
The cost of pet cremation depends on location, where the cremation is done, and time of cremation. The American Humane Society’s cost for cremation of 50 lbs. or less pet is $110 while 51 lbs. or more is $145. The cremated remains are available for the owner to pick up in seven to ten business days. Urns for the companion animal range from $50 to $150.“Cremation Services.” Animal Humane Society. N/D.

==History==

===Ancient===

Cremation dates to at least 20,000 years ago in the archaeological record with the Mungo Lady, the remains of a partly cremated body found at Lake Mungo, Australia.
Alternative death rituals emphasizing one method of disposal of a body—inhumation (burial), cremation, and exposure—have gone through periods of preference throughout history.
In the Middle East and Europe, both burial and cremation are evident in the archaeological record in the Neolithic. Cultural groups had their own preference and prohibitions. The ancient Egyptians developed an intricate transmigration of soul theology, which prohibited cremation, and this was adopted widely among other Semitic peoples. The Babylonians, according to Herodotus, embalmed their dead. Early Persians practiced cremation, but this became prohibited during the Zoroastrian Period. Phoenicians practiced both cremation and burial. From the Cycladic civilisation in 3000 BC until the Sub-Mycenaean era in 1200–1100 B.C., Greeks practiced inhumation. Cremation appearing around the 12th century B.C. constitutes a new practice of burial and is probably an influence from Minor Asia. Until the Christian era, when the inhumation becomes again the only burial practice, both combustion and inhumation had been practiced depending on the era, and area.Ταφικά Έθιμα [tpl]gr icon[/tpl] Romans practiced both, with cremation generally associated with military honors.
In Europe, there are traces of cremation dating to the Early Bronze Age (c. 2000 B.C.) in the Pannonian Plain and along the middle Danube. The custom becomes dominant throughout Bronze Age Europe with the Urnfield culture (from ca. 1300 B.C.). In the Iron Age, inhumation becomes again more common, but cremation persisted in the Villanovan culture and elsewhere. Homer's account of Patroclus' burial describes cremation with subsequent burial in a tumulus similar to Urnfield burials, qualifying as the earliest description of cremation rites. This is mostly an anachronism, as during Mycenaean times burial was generally preferred, and Homer may have been reflecting more common use of cremation in the period in which the Iliad was written centuries later.
Criticism of burial rites is a common aspersion in competing religions and cultures, and one is the association of cremation with fire sacrifice or human sacrifice.
Hinduism and Jainism are notable for not only allowing but prescribing cremation. Cremation in India is first attested in the Cemetery H culture (from ca. 1900 B.C.), considered the formative stage of Vedic civilization. The Rigveda contains a reference to the emerging practice, in RV 10.15.14, where the forefathers "both cremated (agnidagdhá-) and uncremated (ánagnidagdha-)" are invoked.Dudi, Amar Singh. Ancient India History. Neha Publishers and Distributors (January 10, 2012). Ch. 9. Vedic Religion, Rituals. ISBN 978-93-80318-16-5.Sabir, N. Heaven Hell OR??. Publisher: Xlibris (October 7, 2010). P. 155. ISBN 1453550119.
Cremation remained common, but not universal, in both Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. According to Cicero, in Rome, inhumation was considered the more archaic rite, while the most honoured citizens were most typically cremated—especially upper classes and members of imperial families.
Christianity frowned upon cremation, both influenced by the tenets of Judaism, and in an attempt to abolish Graeco-Roman pagan rituals. By the 5th century, the practice of cremation had practically disappeared from Europe.
In early Roman Britain, cremation was usual but diminished by the fourth century. It then reappeared in the fifth and sixth centuries during the migration era, when sacrificed animals were sometimes included with the human bodies on the pyre, and the deceased were dressed in costume and with ornaments for the burning. That custom was also very widespread among the Germanic peoples of the northern continental lands from which the Anglo-Saxon migrants are supposed to have been derived, during the same period. These ashes were usually thereafter deposited in a vessel of clay or bronze in an "urn cemetery." The custom again died out with the Christian conversion among the Anglo-Saxons or Early English during the seventh century, when inhumation of the corpse became general.S.J. Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, 1-62.

===In the Middle Ages===

Throughout parts of Europe, cremation was forbidden by law, and even punishable by death if combined with Heathen rites.[tpl]cite book| title = A History of the Church | last = von Döllinger | first = Johann Joseph Ignaz | publisher = C. Dolman and T.

On the other hand, mass cremations were often performed out of fear[tpl]cite journal|pmid=15231075|year=2004|author1=de Ville de Goyet C|title=Epidemics caused by dead bodies: A disaster myth that does not want to die|volume=15|issue=5|pages=297–9|journal=Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health|doi=10.1590/s1020-49892004000500002[/tpl] of contagious diseases, such as after a battle, pestilence, or famine. Retributory cremation continued into modern times. For example, after World War II, the bodies of the 12 men convicted of crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg Trials were not returned to their families, but were instead cremated, then disposed of at a secret location as a specific part of a legal process intended to deny their use as a location for any sort of memorial.[tpl]cite journal| title = On the Disposal of Dictators| last = Matus| first = Victor| issue = 134| journal = Policy Review| url = http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/2920421.html| accessdate = 2007-03-08[/tpl]

===The modern era===

In 1873, Paduan Professor Brunetti presented a cremation chamber at the Vienna Exposition. In Britain, the movement found the support of Queen Victoria's surgeon, Sir Henry Thompson, who together with colleagues founded the Cremation Society of Great Britain in 1874. The first crematoria in Europe were built in 1878 in Woking, England and Gotha, Germany, the first in North America in 1876 by Dr. Francis Julius LeMoyne in Washington, Pennsylvania.[tpl]cite web |title=The LeMoyne Crematory |url=http://www.wchspa.org/html/crematory.htm |accessdate=2009-03-07 [/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][ref][tpl]cite news |title= An Unceremonious Rite; Cremation of Mrs. Ben Pitman |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E07EEDA113FE63BBC4E52DFB4668383669FDE |work= New York Times|publisher= |date= 1879-02-16|accessdate=7 March 2009 | format=PDF[/tpl]

The first modern crematory in the U.S. was built in 1876 by Francis Julius LeMoyne after hearing about its use in Europe. During that time it was thought that people were getting sick by attending funerals of those recently deceased and that decomposing bodies were leaking into the water systems. LeMoyne built the crematory to cremate bodies in a controlled environment primarily for sanitary reasons. Cremation was used to destroy any organic matter that could cause illness and give families a better way to preserve ashes. Before LeMoyne’s crematory closed in 1901, it had performed 42 cremations.Sanburn, Josh. "The New American Way Of Death." Time 181.24 (2013): 30. Academic Search Premier. Web. 16 Sept. 2013.

formal legislation followed later with the passing of the Cremation Act of 1902 (this Act did not extend to Ireland), which imposed procedural requirements before a cremation could occur and restricted the practice to authorised places.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.srgw.demon.co.uk/CremSoc3/StatutoryLaw/CAct1902.html| title = Cremation Act, 1902| accessdate = 2007-02-03[/tpl]
In 1885 the first official cremation took place at Woking. Ten cremations then took place in 1886. In 1892 a crematorium opened in Manchester, followed by one in Glasgow in 1895 and one in Liverpool in 1896.
Some of the various Protestant churches came to accept cremation, with the rationale being, "God can resurrect a bowl of ashes just as conveniently as he can resurrect a bowl of dust." The 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia was critical about these efforts, referring to them as a "sinister movement" and associating them with Freemasonry, although it said that "there is nothing directly opposed to any dogma of the Church in the practice of cremation."[tpl]cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia = Catholic Encyclopedia| title = Cremation| publisher = The Encyclopedia Press| url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04481c.htm| quote = In conclusion, it must be remembered that there is nothing directly opposed to any dogma of the Church in the practice of cremation, and that, if ever the leaders of this sinister movement so far control the governments of the world as to make this custom universal, it would not be a lapse in the faith confided to her were she obliged to conform.[/tpl]
In 1963, Pope Paul VI lifted the ban on cremation,[tpl]cite book| last = Kohmescher| first = Matthew F.| title = Catholicism Today: A Survey of Catholic Belief and Practice| year = 1999| publisher = Paulist Press| isbn = 0-8091-3873-5| pages = 178–179 [/tpl] and in 1966 allowed Catholic priests to officiate at cremation ceremonies.
In the U.S. only about one crematory per year were built in the late 19th century. As embalming became more widely accepted and used, crematories lost their sanitary edge. To not be left behind, crematories had an idea of making cremation beautiful. They started building crematories with stained-glass windows and marble floors with frescoed walls. By 2008, the cremation rate was 36.2% and was growing about 1 percentage point a year, according to CANA. CANA is the largest organization representing crematories and funeral homes in the U.S. and Canada.
Australia also started to establish modern cremation movements and societies. Australians had their first purpose-built modern crematorium and chapel in the West Terrace Cemetery in the South Australian capital of Adelaide in 1901. This small building, resembling the buildings at Woking, remained largely unchanged from its 19th-century style and was in full operation until the late 1950s. The oldest operating crematorium in Australia is at Rookwood Cemetery, in Sydney. It opened in 1925.
In the Netherlands, the foundation of the Association for Optional CremationDutch, Vereniging voor Facultatieve Lijkverbranding in 1874 ushered in a long debate about the merits and demerits of cremation. Laws against cremation were challenged and invalidated in 1915 (two years after the construction of the first crematorium in the Netherlands), though cremation did not become legally recognised until 1955.[tpl]cite book| last = Groenendijk| first = Paul| coauthors = Vollaard, Piet| title = Architectuurgids Nederland| year = 2006| publisher = 010 Publishers| isbn = 90-6450-573-X| pages = 213 [/tpl]

==World War II [tpl]anchor|Crematoria#World War II|Crematoria[/tpl]==

During World War II (1939–45) Nazi Germany used specially built furnaces in at least six extermination camps throughout occupied Poland including at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Chełmno, Belzec, Majdanek, Sobibor and Treblinka, where the bodies of those murdered by gassing were disposed of using incineration. The efficiency of industrialised killing of Operation Reinhard during the most deadly phase of the Holocaust produced too many corpses, therefore the crematoria manufactured to SS specifications were put into use in all of them to handle the disposals around the clock, day and night.[tpl]cite book |title=Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp|last=Berenbaum|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Berenbaum| coauthors=Yisrael Gutman|year=1998|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20884-2|page=199|url =http://books.google.com/books?id=ZrU2oS8fP3cC&pg=PA199&lpg=PA199&dq=auschwitz+furnaces+day+night&source=web&ots=KnAFUCsuv6&sig=bVDl5vVGLFVpVdK2Ax0xQj8dW7s&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result[/tpl]Holocaust Timeline: The Camps. [tpl]WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5n57M7CKN|date =2010-01-26[/tpl] The Vrba–Wetzler report  offers the following description. [tpl]quote|At present there are four crematoria in operation at BIRKENAU, two large ones, I and II, and two smaller ones, III and IV. Those of type I and II consist of 3 parts, i.e.,: (A) the furnace room; (B) the large halls; and (C) the gas chamber. A huge chimney rises from the furnace room around which are grouped nine furnaces, each having four openings. Each opening can take three normal corpses at once and after an hour and a half the bodies are completely burned. This corresponds to a daily capacity of about 2,000 bodies... Crematoria III and IV work on nearly the same principle, but their capacity is only half as large. Thus the total capacity of the four cremating and gassing plants at BIRKENAU amounts to about 6,000 daily.Holocaust Research Project, "The Vrba-Wetzler Report", part 2.

Meaning that there was no visible duct work for the exhaust gasses. These furnaces, based around a design commonly used for hospital incinerators, instead vented the gasses down through a series of ducts embedded in the floor, with the help of a draft fan located at the far end of the structure. Once outside, the gasses then rose through a free standing chimney, most notable for the fact that it was not directly attached to the structure of the building itself, nor had a visible duct leading into it.

==Controversial cases of cremation in recent history==

===The Tri-State Crematory Incident===

In early 2002, 334 corpses that were supposed to have been cremated in the previous few years at the Tri-State Crematory were found intact and decaying on the crematorium's grounds in the U.S. state of Georgia, having been dumped there by the crematorium's proprietor.  Many of the corpses were decayed beyond identification.  Some families received "ashes" that were made of wood and concrete dust.[tpl]Citation needed|date = May 2012[/tpl]
Operator Ray Brent Marsh had 787 criminal charges filed against him.  On November 19, 2004, Marsh pled guilty to all charges.  Marsh was sentenced to two 12-year prison sentences, one each from Georgia and Tennessee, to be served concurrently; he was also sentenced to probation for 75 years following his incarceration.[tpl]Citation needed|date = May 2012[/tpl]
Civil suits were filed against the Marsh family as well as a number of funeral homes who shipped bodies to Tri-State; these suits were ultimately settled.  The property of the Marsh family has been sold, but collection of the full $80-million judgment remains doubtful. Families have expressed the desire to return the former Tri-State crematory to a natural, parklike setting.[tpl]Citation needed|date = May 2012[/tpl]

===The Indian Ocean tsunamis===

The magnitude 9.0–9.3  2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake triggered a series of lethal tsunamis on December 26, 2004 that killed almost 300,000 people, making them the deadliest tsunamis in recorded history. The tsunamis killed people over an area ranging from the immediate vicinity of the quake in Indonesia, Thailand, and the northwestern coast of Malaysia, to thousands of kilometers away in Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and even as far as Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania in eastern Africa.
Authorities had difficulties dealing with the large numbers of bodies, and as a result, thousands of bodies were cremated together out of fear that decaying bodies would cause disease. Many of these bodies were not identified or viewed by relatives prior to cremation. A particular point of objection was that the bodies of Westerners were kept separate from those of Asian descent, who were mostly locals. This meant that the bodies of tourists from other Asian nations, such as Japan and South Korea, were mass cremated, rather than being returned to their country of origin for funeral rites.

===Obesity and Crematorium Safety===

In Austria in April 2012, the body fat of a 440-lb. (200 kg) woman caught fire, clogged the crematory's air filters and almost destroyed the entire facility. Because of this incident and the U.S.'s obesity epidemic, a number of new crematories are being built to hold individuals weighing up to 1,000 lb. (454 kg).

==Rates==

The cremation rate varies considerably across countries with Japan reporting a 99% cremation rate while Poland reported a rate of 6.7% in 2008.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.srgw.demon.co.uk/CremSoc5/Stats/Interntl/2008/StatsIF.html|title=International Cremation Statistics 2008|author=|publisher=The Cremation Society of Great Britain|date=2010-02-15|accessdate=2010-09-07[/tpl]
Cremation accounts for about 20% of the $13.4 billion funeral industry in the U.S.
