Brindisi railway station ([tpl]lang-it|Stazione di Brindisi[/tpl]) is the main station serving the city and comune of Brindisi, in the region of Apulia, southern Italy.  Opened in 1865, it forms part of the Adriatic Railway (Ancona–Lecce), and is also a junction for, and terminus of, the Taranto–Brindisi railway.
The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated on behalf of Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company.

==Location==

Brindisi railway station is situated at Piazza Francesco Crispi, at the southwest edge of the city centre.

==History==

The station was opened on 29 April 1865, during an era of economic expansion, upon the inauguration of the Bari–Brindisi section of the Adriatic Railway.[tpl]cite web| author=Alessandro Tuzza and others| url=http://www.trenidicarta.it/aperture.html| title=Prospetto cronologico dei tratti di ferrovia aperti all'esercizio dal 1839 al 31 dicembre 1926| trans_title=Chronological overview of the features of the railways opened between 1839 and 31 December 1926|work=Trenidicarta.it |publisher=Alessandro Tuzza| accessdate=1 January 2011[/tpl] [tpl]it icon[/tpl]  Nearly nine months later, on 15 January 1866, the Adriatic Railway was extended from Brindisi to Lecce.
Built like a typical transit station, the passenger building had a structure characterized by a sloping flat roof covering the two through tracks and the pedestrian level crossing between platforms.
On 30 December 1886, Brindisi became a junction station, when the final section of the Taranto–Brindisi railway was opened, between Mesagne and Brindisi.

==Features==

Today, the station has eight tracks used by Trenitalia, and a link with the Brindisi Marittima railway station, once connected by ship to Greece, but now dismantled.
The station was included in the Centostazioni program of rehabilitation of the main Italian stations. At Brindisi, the rehabilitation project includes an increase and reorganization of space for passengers with significant improvements in services.
