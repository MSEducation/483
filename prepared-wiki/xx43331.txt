==U.S. Senate==

===Elections===

In 2002, Sununu ran for a United States Senate seat from New Hampshire. In the Republican primary, he defeated the Republican incumbent Bob Smith 54%–45%.

===Tenure===

According to a Washington Post study, Sununu voted with the Republican Party's position 84% of the time. However, he broke with his party on prominent issues, joining Democrats in filibusters of the USA PATRIOT Act[tpl]cite web |first=Julie |last=Donnelly|title=NH Senator Sununu Promises to Hold-Up Patriot Act |url=http://www.nhpr.org/node/10086 |date=December 15, 2005 |publisher=New Hampshire Public Radio |accessdate=December 17, 2009[/tpl] and the Bush Administration's 2003 energy bill.[tpl]cite news |first=Carl |last=Hulse |title=Filibuster Blocks $31 Billion Energy Bill in Senate |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/21/politics/21CND-ENER.html |date=November 21, 2003 |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=December 17, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Sununu strongly supported greater access to firearms, voting against the proposed renewal of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban in 2004. He strongly opposed amnesty for illegal aliens, voting against the McCain-Kennedy immigration bill in July 2007. Sununu called for a tougher federal regulator for government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and with Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD), he filed a dramatic overhaul of regulation of the insurance industry.[tpl]cite news|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/john_e_sununu/index.html|title=John E.

Sununu was one of only three senators whose voting record received a score of 100% from the fiscally conservative Club for Growth, in both 2005 and 2006, tying for 1st place.  However, his rating fell to 23rd place in 2007, and to 34th place in 2008.http://www.clubforgrowth.org/projects/scorecard/?year=all&chamber=1&state=Any&party=Any&memberName=sununu  The Club for Growth endorsed[tpl]cite web |first=Sam |last=Youngman |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/312-sununu-wins-club-for-growth-backing-in-quot08-bid |title=Sununu Wins Club For Growth Backing in '08 Bid |publisher=The Hill|date=February 27, 2007 |accessdate=December 17, 2009[/tpl] Sununu's unsuccessful bid for re-election in February 2007 against Jeanne Shaheen (she subsequently during 2009–2012 earned Club for Growth ratings of 64th place to 100th place).http://www.clubforgrowth.org/projects/scorecard/?year=all&chamber=1&state=Any&party=Any&memberName=shaheen
In 2007, Sununu was the lead Republican co-sponsor of the Clean Air Planning Act of 2007 which sought to address air quality and climate change by establishing a schedule to reduce harmful emissions from power plants—in particular, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides—as well as decrease carbon dioxide emissions through a cap-and-trade system. The legislation, which was never enacted, also addressed mercury pollution, calling for a 90% reduction in emissions of the chemical by 2015.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-1177 |title=S. 1177: Clean Air Planning Act of 2007 |author=110th Congress |date=April 20, 2007 |publisher=GovTrack |accessdate=December 17, 2009[/tpl] He also supported the bipartisan Clean Energy Stimulus Act of 2008 that provides tax incentives for the development of clean and renewable energy sources.[tpl]cite web |title=U.S. Senate Introduces Bipartisan Renewable Energy Tax Credit Legislation |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/story?id=52081 |publisher=Renewable Energy World |date=April 4, 2008 |accessdate=December 17, 2009[/tpl] In 2006 Sununu sponsored the bipartisan New England Wilderness Act which added tens of thousand of acres of land to federally protected forests.[tpl]cite web |title=Senate Unanimously Passes New England Wilderness Act |url=http://leahy.senate.gov/press/200609/091906d.html |publisher=U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy |date=September 19, 2006 |accessdate=December 17, 2009[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] Sununu opposed the Climate Stewardship Act of 2003, which would have also created a cap-and-trade program. His vote was criticized by the New Hampshire Democratic Party which claimed that he had acted "against reducing greenhouse gases". The New Hampshire Union Leader praised his decision, citing the Energy Information Agency's estimation that the legislation would cost the American economy $507 billion over 22 years.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Green+Sununu%3A+NH+vs.+Washington+values&articleId=0004e7e3-5061-4c78-903b-fa9d3029b1d0 |title=Green Sununu: NH vs. Washington Values |date=April 27, 2008 |publisher=New Hampshire Union Leader |accessdate=December 17, 2009[/tpl]
Sununu took a few positions contrary to the Bush administration and the Republican leadership. Though he voted for the flag-burning amendment, he voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment and he opposed restrictions on travel and trade with Cuba, and was one of only two Republicans to vote in favor of terminating funds for TV Martí, which broadcasts anti-Castro programming in Cuba. He was one of a small group of Republicans to vote in favor of banning loans to China for any nuclear projects, and in September 2005 he voted to disapprove a new rule set in place by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) delisting coal and other energy sources from the Clean Air Act.
He also became well known as one of the five Republican Senators who joined Democrats in a filibuster of the USA PATRIOT Act renewal conference report. This caused the Republican leadership to extend the original legislation until a compromise bill was forged.
In January 2006, at a hearing in front of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee on the Broadcast Flag, Sununu was one of the very few present to criticize the legislation, saying "In all cases previous technological advancements in the US, we didn't need to step in with a significant statutory government-regulated mandate on technology that consumers use to enjoy this material".[tpl]cite web |first=Declan |last=McCullagh |title=Senate may hoist broadcast flag again |url=http://news.cnet.com/Senate-may-hoist-broadcast-flag-again/2100-1025_3-6030454.html?tag=mncol |date=January 24, 2006 |publisher=CNET.com |accessdate=December 17, 2009[/tpl]
In October 2006, Sununu voted against a portion of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 that would suspend the right of habeas corpus for non-citizen detainees. After voting in favor of the final bill, he defended his vote by telling reporters "The Constitution is not a suicide pact".[tpl]cite web |first=Gail Russell |last=Chaddock |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1002/p01s02-usfp.html |title= In fog of war on terror, some rules set |date=October 2, 2006 |page=2 |publisher=The Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=December 17, 2009[/tpl]
On March 14, 2007, Sununu became the first Republican senator to call for the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales after a controversy over U.S. Attorney firings. Sununu cited his anger with the mismanagement by Gonzales and the lack of trustworthiness by GOP Senators towards Gonzales.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/14/fired.attorneys/index.html |title=GOP senator calls for Gonzales' head |date=March 15, 2007 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=December 17, 2009[/tpl]
In July 2005, Sununu shaved his head to show solidarity with Senator Arlen Specter, who had lost his hair due to chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease.[tpl]cite web|url=http://politicalwire.com/archives/2005/07/24/sununu_shaves_head_for_specter.html|title=Sununu Shaves Head for Specter|date=July 24, 2005|publisher=Political Wire|accessdate=November 22, 2009[/tpl]
In September 2008, Sununu became one of twenty senators (ten Democrats and ten Republicans) co-sponsoring a bipartisan energy bill, the New Energy Reform Act of 2008. The bill is offered as an alternative to the Democrats' energy bill, sponsored by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Both bills propose to increase offshore drilling, while promoting conservation and alternative energy. The "Gang of Twenty" bill also lets coastal states participate in decisions and in revenue about drilling in the fifty-to-one-hundred-mile range off their coasts. It also differs from the Democrats' bill in allowing drilling off Florida's west coast, a proposal both Florida's senators have protested. To quote the Minneapolis Star Tribune, "Nearly every potentially vulnerable Senate Republican, from Norm Coleman Minnesota to Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina and John Sununu of New Hampshire, has signed on to the legislation."[tpl]cite web |first=Mitch |last=Anderson |title=Klobuchar joins bipartisan energy group |url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/28297749.html |date=September 12, 2008 |publisher=Minneapolis Star Tribune |accessdate=December 17, 2009[/tpl]
