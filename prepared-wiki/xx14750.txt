[[Little Ice Age]]

CATEGORIES: 2nd millennium, Climate history, Holocene

The Little Ice Age (LIA) was a period of cooling that occurred after the Medieval Warm Period (Medieval Climate Optimum).[tpl]cite book|author=Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie|title=Times of Feast, Times of Famine: a History of Climate Since the Year 1000|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, NY|year=1971|oclc=164590|others=Barbara Bray|isbn= 0-374-52122-0[/tpl] While it was not a true ice age, the term was introduced into the scientific literature by François E.

Several causes have been proposed: cyclical lows in solar radiation, heightened volcanic activity, changes in the ocean circulation, an inherent variability in global climate, or decreases in the human population.

==Areas involved==

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report (TAR) of 2001 describes areas affected by the LIA:
The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of 2007 discusses more recent research, giving particular attention to the Medieval Warm Period. It states that "when viewed together, the currently available reconstructions indicate generally greater variability in centennial time scale trends over the last 1 kyr than was apparent in the TAR." Considering confidence limits, "The result is a picture of relatively cool conditions in the seventeenth and early nineteenth centuries and warmth in the eleventh and early fifteenth centuries, but the warmest conditions are apparent in the twentieth century. Given that the confidence levels surrounding all of the reconstructions are wide, virtually all reconstructions are effectively encompassed within the uncertainty previously indicated in the TAR. The major differences between the various proxy reconstructions relate to the magnitude of past cool excursions, principally during the twelfth to fourteenth, seventeenth and nineteenth centuries."AR4 WG1 Section 6.6: The Last 2,000 Years, 2007.

==Dating==

There is no consensus regarding the time when the Little Ice Age began,[tpl]cite book|title=History and climate: memories of the future?|publisher=Springer|first=Philip D.|last=Jones|page=154|year=2001[/tpl]According to JM Lamb of Cambridge University the little ice age was already under way in Canada and Switzerland and in the wider North Atlantic region in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries although a series of events preceding the known climatic minima has often been referenced.  In the thirteenth century, pack ice began advancing southwards in the North Atlantic, as did glaciers in Greenland. Anecdotal evidence suggests expanding glaciers almost worldwide.  Based on radiocarbon dating of roughly 150 samples of dead plant material with roots intact, collected from beneath ice caps on Baffin Island and Iceland, Miller et al. (2012) state that cold summers and ice growth began abruptly between AD 1275 and 1300, followed by "a substantial intensification" from 1430 to 1455.
In contrast, a climate reconstruction based on glacial length[tpl]cite web| publisher=RealClimate | title=Worldwide glacier retreat |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=129 | accessdate=2 August 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Oerlemans|first=Johannes Hans Oerlemans|year=2005|title=Extracting a Climate Signal from 169 Glacier Records|journal=Science|volume=308|pmid=15746388|issue=5722|pages=675–7|url=http://dusk.geo.orst.edu/prosem/GEO518_Panel01_Oerlemans_2005.pdf|accessdate=25 December 2009|doi=10.1126/science.1107046|bibcode=2005Sci...308..675O[/tpl] shows no great variation from 1600 to 1850, though it shows strong retreat thereafter.
For this reason, any of several dates ranging over 400 years may indicate the beginning of the Little Ice Age:
The Little Ice Age ended in the latter half of the nineteenth century or early in the twentieth century.[tpl]cite doi|10.1126/science.1067693[/tpl][tpl]cite doi|10.1023/A:1005625729889[/tpl][tpl]cite web| publisher=INQUA | title=About INQUA:Quaternary Science (By S.C.

===Europe and North America===

The Little Ice Age brought colder winters to parts of Europe and North America. Farms and villages in the Swiss Alps were destroyed by encroaching glaciers during the mid-seventeenth century.[tpl]cite book|title=Climate change: biological and human aspects|year=2007|author=Jonathan Cowie|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=164|isbn=978-0-521-69619-7[/tpl] Canals and rivers in Great Britain and the Netherlands were frequently frozen deeply enough to support ice skating and winter festivals. The first River Thames frost fair was in 1607 and the last in 1814; changes to the bridges and the addition of an embankment affected the river flow and depth, hence diminishing the possibility of freezes. Freezing of the Golden Horn and the southern section of the Bosphorus took place in 1622. In 1658, a Swedish army marched across the Great Belt to Denmark to attack Copenhagen. The winter of 1794-1795 was particularly harsh, when the French invasion army under Pichegru could march on the frozen rivers of the Netherlands, while the Dutch fleet was fixed in the ice in Den Helder harbour. In the winter of 1780, New York Harbor froze, allowing people to walk from Manhattan to Staten Island. Sea ice surrounding Iceland extended for miles in every direction, closing harbors to shipping.
The population of Iceland fell by half, but this was perhaps caused by fluorosis after the eruption of the volcano Laki in 1783.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Stone |first=Richard |journal=Science |date=19 November 2004 |volume=306 |issue=5700 |pages=1278–81 |title=Iceland's Doomsday Scenario? |doi= 10.1126/science.306.5700.1278 |pmid=15550636[/tpl] Iceland also suffered failures of cereal crops, and people moved away from a grain-based diet.[tpl]dead link|date=June 2013[/tpl]
The Norse colonies in Greenland starved and vanished (by the early fifteenth century), as crops failed and livestock could not be maintained through increasingly harsh winters, though Jared Diamond noted they had exceeded the agricultural carrying capacity before then.

In Lisbon, Portugal, snowstorms were much more frequent than today. Heavy snowfalls in the winters of 1665, 1744 and 1886 were reported.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.meteopt.com/forum/eventos-historicos-efemerides/tempestades-historicas-em-portugal-1560-4.html |title=Arquivo de eventos históricos - Página 4 - MeteoPT.com - Fórum de Meteorologia |publisher=MeteoPT.com |date=17 July 2012 |accessdate=24 June 2013[/tpl]
Hubert Lamb said that in many years, "snowfall was much heavier than recorded before or since, and the snow lay on the ground for many months longer than it does today."[tpl]Cite book |last=Lamb |first= Hubert H. |title=Climate, history and the modern world |year=1995 |chapter=The little ice age |pages=211–241 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0-415-12734-3[/tpl] Many springs and summers were cold and wet, but with great variability between years and groups of years. Crop practices throughout Europe had to be altered to adapt to the shortened, less reliable growing season, and there were many years of dearth and famine (such as the Great Famine of 1315–1317, although this may have been before the LIA proper).[tpl]cite book |first=Karen J. |last=Cullen |title=Famine in Scotland: The 'Ill Years' of The 1690s |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RiLjHZdt-sMC&pg=PA20 |date=30 May 2010 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-3887-1 |page=20[/tpl] According to Elizabeth Ewan and Janay Nugent, "Famines in France 1693–94, Norway 1695–96 and Sweden 1696–97 claimed roughly 10% of the population of each country.

Violent storms caused serious flooding and loss of life. Some of these resulted in permanent loss of large areas of land from the Danish, German and Dutch coasts.
The extent of mountain glaciers had been mapped by the late nineteenth century. In both the north and the south temperate zones, snowlines (the boundaries separating zones of net accumulation from those of net ablation) were about 100 m lower than they were in 1975. In Glacier National Park, the last episode of glacier advance came in the late 18th and early nineteenth centuries.National Park Service In Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, large temperature excursions were possibly related to changes in the strength of North Atlantic thermohaline circulation.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Cronin |first=T.

In North America, the early European explorers and settlers reported exceptionally severe winters. For example, according to Lamb, Samuel Champlain reported bearing ice along the shores of Lake Superior in June 1608; both Europeans and indigenous peoples suffered excess mortality in Maine during the winter of 1607-1608; and extreme frost was reported in the Jamestown, Virginia settlement at the same time. The journal of Pierre de Troyes, Chevalier de Troyes, who led an expedition to James Bay in 1686, recorded that James Bay was still littered with so much floating ice that he could hide behind it in his canoe on 1 July.[tpl]cite book |author=Kenyon W.A., Turnbull J.R. |title=The Battle for James Bay |publisher=Macmillan Company of Canada Limited |location=Toronto |year=1971 [/tpl]
Antonio Stradivari, the famous violin maker, produced his instruments during the Little Ice Age. The colder climate is proposed to have caused the wood used in his violins to be denser than in warmer periods, contributing to the tone of Stradivari's instruments.[tpl]Cite news |last=Whitehouse |first=David |title=Stradivarius' sound 'due to Sun' |date=17 December 2003 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/science/nature/3323259.stm[/tpl] According to the science historian James Burke the period inspired such innovations in everyday life as the widespread use of buttons and button holes, knitting of custom-made undergarments to better cover and insulate the human body, and installation of fireplace hoods to make more efficient use of fires for indoor heating,TV series "Connections" by James Burke as well as the development of the enclosed stove, in early versions often covered with ceramic tiles.
The Little Ice Age by anthropology professor Brian Fagan of the University of California at Santa Barbara tells of the plight of European peasants during the 1300 to 1850 chill: famines, hypothermia, bread riots, and the rise of despotic leaders brutalizing an increasingly dispirited peasantry. In the late seventeenth century, writes Fagan, agriculture had dropped off so dramatically, "Alpine villagers lived on bread made from ground nutshells mixed with barley and oat flour." [tpl]harvnb|Fagan|2001[/tpl] Historian Wolfgang Behringer has linked intensive witch-hunting episodes in Europe to agricultural failures during the Little Ice Age.

===Depictions of winter in European painting===

William James Burroughs analyses the depiction of winter in paintings, as does Hans Neuberger.[tpl]cite book|title=Frozen Earth: The Once and Future Story of Ice Ages|url=http://books.google.com/?id=W2eDDMIeqpoC&pg=PA225 |first=Douglas |last=Macdougall |publisher=University of California Press |year=2004|page=225 |isbn=0-520-24824-4[/tpl]  Burroughs asserts that this occurred almost entirely from 1565 to 1665 and was associated with the climatic decline from 1550 onwards. Burroughs claims that before this, there were almost no depictions of winter in art, and "hypothesizes that the unusually harsh winter of 1565 inspired great artists to depict highly original images and that the decline in such paintings was a combination of the "theme" having been fully explored and mild winters interrupting the flow of painting".Earth Environments: Past, Present and Future, by David Huddart & Tim Stott, p. 863 (quoted), 2010, John Wiley & Sons, ISBN 0470749601, 9780470749609  Wintry scenes, which have technical difficulties in painting, had been regularly and very well handled since the early fifteenth century by artists in illuminated manuscript cycles showing the Labours of the Months, typically placed on the calendar pages of books of hours. January and February are typically shown as snowy, as in February in the famous cycle in the Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry, painted 1412-1416 and illustrated below. At this period independent landscape subjects had not developed as a genre in art, so the absence of other winter scenes is not remarkable.
The famous winter landscape paintings by Pieter Brueghel the Elder, such as The Hunters in the Snow, are all thought to have been painted in 1565. His son Pieter Brueghel the Younger (1564-1638) also painted many snowy landscapes, though according to Burroughs he "slavishly copied his father's designs. The derivative nature of so much of this work makes it difficult to draw any definite conclusions about the influence of the winters between 1570 and 1600...".Earth Environments: Past, Present and Future, by David Huddart & Tim Stott, p. 863 (quoted), 2010, John Wiley & Sons, ISBN 0470749601, 9780470749609; see also this 1980 article by Burroughs in the New Scientist
Burroughs say that snowy subjects return to Dutch Golden Age painting with works by Hendrick Avercamp from 1609 onwards. There is then a hiatus between 1627 and 1640, before the main period of such subjects from the 1640s to the 1660s, which relates well with climate records for this later period. The subjects are less popular after about 1660, but this does not match any recorded reduction in severity of winters, and may just reflect changes in taste or fashion. In the later period between the 1780s and 1810s, snowy subjects again become popular.
Neuberger analysed 12,000 paintings, held in American and European museums and dated between 1400 and 1967, for cloudiness and darkness. His 1970 publication shows an increase in such depictions that corresponds to the LIA, peaking between 1600 and 1649.[tpl]cite book|title=John Constable's skies: a fusion of art and science |author=John E.

==Southern Hemisphere==

Since the discovery of the Little Ice Age, there have been doubts about whether it was a global phenomenon or a cold spell restricted to the Northern Hemisphere. In recent years, several scientific works have pointed out the existence of cold spells and climate changes in areas of the Southern Hemisphere and their correlation to the Little Ice Age.

There is limited evidence about conditions in Australia, though lake records in Victoria suggest that conditions, at least in the south of the state, were wet and/or unusually cool. In the north of the continent, the limited evidence suggests fairly dry conditions, while coral cores from the Great Barrier Reef show similar rainfall as today but with less variability.

On the west coast of the Southern Alps of New Zealand, the Franz Josef glacier advanced rapidly during the Little Ice Age, reaching its maximum extent in the early eighteenth century, in one of the few places where a glacier thrust into a rain forest.

Although it only provides anecdotal evidence, in 1675, the Spanish explorer Antonio de Vea entered San Rafael Lagoon through Río Témpanos (Spanish for "Ice Floe River") without mentioning any ice floe and stated that the San Rafael Glacier did not reach far into the lagoon. In 1766, another expedition noticed that the glacier did reach the lagoon and calved into large icebergs. Hans Steffen visited the area in 1898, noticing that the glacier penetrated far into the lagoon. Such historical records indicate a general cooling in the area between 1675 and 1898, and "The recognition of the LIA in northern Patagonia, through the use of documentary sources, provides important, independent evidence for the occurrence of this phenomenon in the region."[tpl]cite journal |author=Araneda, A., F.

==Climate patterns==

In the North Atlantic, sediments accumulated since the end of the last ice age, nearly 12,000 years ago, show regular increases in the amount of coarse sediment grains deposited from icebergs melting in the now open ocean, indicating a series of 1–2 °C (2–4 °F)  cooling events recurring every 1,500 years or so.Bond et al., 1997 The most recent of these cooling events was the Little Ice Age. These same cooling events are detected in sediments accumulating off Africa, but the cooling events appear to be larger, ranging between 3–8 °C (6–14 °F).[tpl]cite web |title=Abrupt Climate Changes Revisited: How Serious and How Likely? |date=23 February 1998 |work=USGCRP Seminar |publisher=US Global Change Research Program |url=http://www.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/seminars/980217DD.html[/tpl]

==Causes==

Scientists have tentatively identified these possible causes of the Little Ice Age: orbital cycles, decreased solar activity, increased volcanic activity, altered ocean current flows,http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v3/n6/full/ncomms1901.html, Wanamaker et al. (2012). Surface changes in the North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation during the last millennium the inherent variability of global climate, and reforestation following decreases in the human population. The most recent study found that an especially massive tropical volcanic eruption in 1258, possibly of Mount Rinjani, followed by three smaller ones in 1268, 1275, and 1284 that did not allow the climate to recover, may have caused the initial cooling, and that the 1452–53 eruption of Kuwae in Vanuatu triggered a second pulse of cooling.Miller et al. 2012. "Abrupt onset of the Little Ice Age triggered by volcanism and sustained by sea-ice/ocean feedbacks" Geophysical Research Letters 39, 31 January: abstract and link on AGU website (accessed 31 January 2011)[ref]Was the Little Ice Age Triggered by Massive Volcanic Eruptions?
ScienceDaily, 30 January 2012 (accessed 21 May 2012)[/ref] The  cold summers can be maintained by sea-ice/ocean feedbacks long after volcanic aerosols are removed.

===Orbital cycles===

Orbital forcing due to cycles in the earth's orbit around the sun has, for the past 2,000 years, caused a long-term northern hemisphere cooling trend that continued through the Medieval period and the Little Ice Age. The rate of Arctic cooling is roughly 0.02 degrees Celsius per century.[tpl]cite doi|10.1126/science.1173983[/tpl] [tpl]cite web | title = Arctic Warming Overtakes 2,000 Years of Natural Cooling | url = http://www2.ucar.edu/news/846/arctic-warming-overtakes-2000-years-natural-cooling | publisher = UCAR | date =3 September 2009  | accessdate = 19 May 2011 [/tpl] [tpl]Cite news  | last =Bello  | first = David | title = Global Warming Reverses Long-Term Arctic Cooling | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=global-warming-reverses-arctic-cooling | publisher = Scientific American  | date = 4 September 2009  | accessdate = 19 May 2011 [/tpl] This trend could be extrapolated to continue into the future, possibly leading to a full ice age, but the twentieth-century instrumental temperature record shows a sudden reversal of this trend, with a rise in global temperatures attributed to greenhouse gas emissions.

===Solar activity===

There is still a very poor understanding of the correlation between low sunspot activity and cooling temperatures.Radiative Forcing of Climate Change: Expanding the Concept and Addressing Uncertainties, National Research Council, National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., p. 29, 2005.Sunspot Activity at 8,000-Year High Space.com Astronomy 27 October 2004
During the period 1645–1715, in the middle of the Little Ice Age, there was a period of low solar activity known as the Maunder Minimum.
The Spörer Minimum has also been identified with a significant cooling period between 1460 and 1550.[tpl]cite book|title=The general crisis of the seventeenth century|url=http://books.google.com/?id=HGLs23umDXAC&pg=PA287 |author=Geoffrey Parker, Lesley M. Smith|publisher=Routledge|pages=287, 288|isbn=978-0-415-16518-1|year=1997[/tpl]
Other indicators of low solar activity during this period are levels of the isotopes carbon-14 and beryllium-10.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Crowley |first=Thomas J. |journal=Science |date=14 July 2000 |volume=289 |issue=5477 |pages=270–7 |title=Causes of Climate Change Over the Past 1000 Years |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/289/5477/270 |pmid=10894770 |doi=10.1126/science.289.5477.270|bibcode = 2000Sci...289..270C [/tpl]
On the other hand, in a 2012 paper, Miller et al. link the Little Ice Age to an "unusual 50-year-long episode with four large sulfur-rich explosive eruptions, each with global sulfate loading >60 Tg," and notes that "large changes in solar irradiance are not required."

===Volcanic activity===

Throughout the Little Ice Age, the world experienced heightened volcanic activity.[tpl]Cite journal |last=Robock |first=Alan |journal=Science |date=21 December 1979 |volume=206 |issue=4425 |pages=1402–4 |title=The "Little Ice Age": Northern Hemisphere Average Observations and Model Calculations |doi= 10.1126/science.206.4425.1402 |pmid=17739301|bibcode = 1979Sci...206.1402R [/tpl] When a volcano erupts, its ash reaches high into the atmosphere and can spread to cover the whole earth. This ash cloud blocks out some of the incoming solar radiation, leading to worldwide cooling that can last up to two years after an eruption. Also emitted by eruptions is sulfur in the form of sulfur dioxide gas. When this gas reaches the stratosphere, it turns into sulfuric acid particles, which reflect the sun's rays, further reducing the amount of radiation reaching Earth's surface. The 1815 eruption of Tambora in Indonesia blanketed the atmosphere with ash; the following year, 1816, came to be known as the Year Without a Summer, when frost and snow were reported in June and July in both New England and Northern Europe. Other volcanoes that erupted during the era and may have contributed to the cooling include Billy Mitchell (ca. 1580), Mount Parker (1641), Long Island (Papua New Guinea) (ca. 1660), and Huaynaputina (1600).

===Ocean conveyor slowdown===

Another possibility is that there was a slowing of thermohaline circulation.[tpl]cite journal |author=Broecker WS |title=Was a change in thermohaline circulation responsible for the Little Ice Age? |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=1339–42 |date=February 2000 |pmid=10677462 |pmc=34299 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10677462 |doi=10.1073/pnas.97.4.1339|bibcode = 2000PNAS...97.1339B [/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/05mar_arctic.htm |title=A Chilling Possibility - NASA Science |publisher=Science.nasa.gov |accessdate=24 June 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |author=Hopkin, Michael |title=Gulf Stream weakened in 'Little Ice Age' |date=29 November 2006 |work=Nature News |url=http://www.bioedonline.org/news/news.cfm?art=2966[/tpl] The circulation could have been interrupted by the introduction of a large amount of fresh water into the North Atlantic, possibly caused by a period of warming before the Little Ice Age known as the Medieval Warm Period.[tpl]cite web |last=Villanueva |first= John Carl |title=Little Ice Age |publisher= Universe Today |url=http://www.universetoday.com/guide-to-space/earth/little-ice-age/ |date=19 October 2009 |accessdate=22 September 2010[/tpl] There is some concern that a shutdown of thermohaline circulation could happen again as a result of the present warming period.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article520013.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Britain faces big chill as ocean current slows | first=Jonathan | last=Leake | date=8 May 2005 | accessdate=11 May 2010[/tpl][tpl]Cite episode |title=Hot Planet — Cold Comfort |url=http://www.pbs.org/saf/1505/index.html |series=Alan Alda in Scientific American Frontiers |network=PBS |date=16 February 2005 |transcript=Only a Little Ice Age |transcripturl=http://www.pbs.org/saf/1505/segments/1505-3.htm [/tpl]

===Decreased human populations===

Some researchers have proposed that human influences on climate began earlier than is normally supposed (see Early anthropocene for more details) and that major population declines in Eurasia and the Americas reduced this impact, leading to a cooling trend. William Ruddiman has proposed that somewhat reduced populations of Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East during and after the Black Death caused a decrease in agricultural activity. He suggests reforestation took place, allowing more carbon dioxide uptake from the atmosphere, which may have been a factor in the cooling noted during the Little Ice Age. Ruddiman further hypothesizes that a reduced population in the Americas after European contact in the early sixteenth century could have had a similar effect.[tpl]Cite news |last=Ravilious |first=Kate |title=Europe's chill linked to disease |date=27 February 2006 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4755328.stm[/tpl][tpl]cite journal|last=Ruddiman|first=William F. |year=2003|title=The anthropogenic greenhouse era began thousands of years ago|journal=Climatic Change |volume=61|pages=261–293|url=http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/Ruddiman2003.pdf|doi=10.1023/B:CLIM.0000004577.17928.fa|issue=3[/tpl]  Faust, Gnecco, Mannstein and Stamm (2005)[tpl]cite web|title=Evidence for the Postconquest Demographic Collapse of the Americas in Historical [tpl]CO2[/tpl] Levels|year=2006 |accessdate=1 February 2010|publisher=American Meteorological Society through Allenpress.com|url=http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1175%2FEI157.1[/tpl] and Nevle (2011)R.J.

Popular summary:  "Columbus' arrival linked to carbon dioxide drop: Depopulation of Americas may have cooled climate," Science News, 5 November 2011. (access date 2 January 2012) supported depopulation in the Americas as a factor, asserting that humans had cleared considerable amounts of forests to support agriculture in the Americas before the arrival of Europeans brought on a population collapse.  A 2008 study of sediment cores and soil samples further suggests that carbon dioxide uptake via reforestation in the Americas could have contributed to the Little Ice Age.[tpl]Cite news |last=Bergeron|first=Louis |title=Reforestation helped trigger Little Ice Age, researchers say |date=17 December 2008 |publisher=Stanford News Service |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2009/january7/manvleaf-010709.html[/tpl]  The depopulation is linked to a drop in carbon dioxide levels observed at Law Dome, Antarctica.

===Inherent variability of climate===

Spontaneous fluctuations in global climate might explain past variability. It is very difficult to know what the true level of variability from only internal causes might be, since other forcings, as noted above, exist; and their magnitude may not be known either. One approach to evaluating internal variability is to use long integrations of coupled ocean-atmosphere global climate models. These have the advantage that the external forcing is known to be zero; but the disadvantage is that they may not fully reflect reality. These variations may result from chaos-driven changes in the oceans, the atmosphere, or interactions between the two.[tpl]cite web|title=Global Warming in the Context of the Little Ice Age|publisher=Rutgers University, originally published in Journal of Geophysical Research|author=Melissa Free, Alan Robock|url=http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/FreeRobock1999JD900233.pdf|date=27 August 1999|accessdate=3 January 2010[/tpl] Two studies have concluded that the demonstrated inherent variability is not great enough to account for the Little Ice Age.[tpl]cite doi|10.1007/s00382-006-0153-5[/tpl]
