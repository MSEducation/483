[[Length contraction]]

CATEGORIES: Special relativity, History of physics, Length

In physics, length contraction is the phenomenon of a decrease in length measured by an observer of objects which are traveling at any non-zero velocity relative to the observer. This contraction (more formally called Lorentz contraction or Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction after Hendrik Lorentz and George FitzGerald) is usually only noticeable at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. Length contraction is only in the direction parallel to the direction in which the observed body is travelling. This effect is negligible at everyday speeds, and can be ignored for all regular purposes. Only at greater speeds does it become relevant. At a speed of 13,400,000 m/s (30 million mph, 0.0447[tpl]math|c[/tpl]), the contracted length is 99.9% of the length at rest; at a speed of 42,300,000 m/s (95 million mph, 0.141[tpl]math|c[/tpl]), the length is still 99%. As the magnitude of the velocity approaches the speed of light, the effect becomes dominant, as can be seen from the formula:

and the Lorentz factor, [tpl]math|γ(v)[/tpl], is defined as
In this equation it is assumed that the object is parallel with its line of movement. For the observer in relative movement, the length of the object is measured by subtracting the simultaneously measured distances of both ends of the object. For more general conversions, see the Lorentz transformations. An observer at rest viewing an object travelling very close to the speed of light would observe the length of the object in the direction of motion as very near zero.

==History==

Length contraction was postulated by George FitzGerald (1889) and Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1892) to explain the negative outcome of the Michelson-Morley experiment and to rescue the hypothesis of the stationary aether (Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction hypothesis).[tpl]Citation|author=FitzGerald, George Francis|year=1889|title=The Ether and the Earth's Atmosphere|journal=Science|volume=13|pages=390|doi=10.1126/science.ns-13.328.390|pmid=17819387|issue=328|bibcode = 1889Sci....13..390F [/tpl][tpl]Citation|last=Lorentz|first=Hendrik Antoon|year=1892|title=The Relative Motion of the Earth and the Aether|journal=Zittingsverlag Akad. V. Wet.|volume=1|pages=74–79[/tpl]
Although both FitzGerald and Lorentz alluded to the fact that electrostatic fields in motion were deformed ("Heaviside-Ellipsoid" after Oliver Heaviside, who derived this deformation from electromagnetic theory in 1888), it was considered an ad hoc hypothesis, because at this time there was no sufficient reason to assume that intermolecular forces behave the same way as electromagnetic ones. In 1897 Joseph Larmor developed a model in which all forces are considered to be of electromagnetic origin, and length contraction appeared to be a direct consequence of this model. Yet it was shown by Henri Poincaré (1905) that electromagnetic forces alone cannot explain the electron's stability. So he had to introduce another ad hoc hypothesis: non-electric binding forces (Poincaré stresses) that ensure the electron's stability, give a dynamical explanation for length contraction, and thus hide the motion of the stationary aether.
Eventually, Albert Einstein (1905) was the first to completely remove the ad hoc character from the contraction hypothesis, by demonstrating that this contraction did not require motion through a supposed aether, but could be explained using special relativity, which changed our notions of space, time, and simultaneity.[ref]

==Basis in relativity==

==Symmetry==

The principle of relativity (according to which the laws of nature must assume the same form in all inertial reference frames) requires that length contraction is symmetrical: If a rod rests in inertial frame S, it has its proper length in S and its length is contracted in S'. However, if a rod rests in S', it has its proper length in S' and its length is contracted in S. This can be vividly illustrated using symmetric Minkowski diagrams (or Loedel diagrams), because the Lorentz transformation geometrically corresponds to a rotation in four-dimensional spacetime.[tpl]cite book |author=Albert Shadowitz  |title=Special relativity |isbn=0-486-65743-4 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |edition=Reprint of 1968 edition |year=1988|pages=20–22[/tpl][tpl]cite book |author=Leo Sartori  |title=Understanding Relativity: a simplified approach to Einstein's theories |isbn=0-520-20029-2 |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996|pages=151ff[/tpl]
First image: If a rod at rest in S' is given, then its endpoints are located upon the ct' axis and the axis parallel to it. In this frame the simultaneous (parallel to the axis of x') positions of the endpoints are O and B, thus the proper length is given by OB. But in S the simultaneous (parallel to the axis of x) positions are O and A, thus the contracted length is given by OA.
On the other hand, if another rod is at rest in S, then its endpoints are located upon the ct axis and the axis parallel to it. In this frame the simultaneous (parallel to the axis of x) positions of the endpoints are O and D, thus the proper length is given by OD. But in S' the simultaneous (parallel to the axis of x') positions are O and C, thus the contracted length is given by OC.

==Experimental verifications==

Any observer co-moving with the observed object cannot measure the object's contraction, because he can judge himself and the object as at rest in the same inertial frame in accordance with the principle of relativity (as it was demonstrated by the Trouton-Rankine experiment). So Length contraction cannot be measured in the object's rest frame, but only in a frame in which the observed object is in motion. In addition, even in such a non-co-moving frame, direct experimental confirmations of Length contraction are hard to achieve, because at the current state of technology, objects of considerable extension cannot be accelerated to relativistic speeds. And the only objects traveling with the speed required are atomic particles, yet whose spatial extensions are too small to allow a direct measurement of contraction.
However, there are indirect confirmations of this effect in a non-co-moving frame:

==Reality of length contraction==

In 1911 Vladimir Varićak asserted that length contraction is "real" according to Lorentz, while it is "apparent or subjective" according to Einstein.[tpl]Citation |author=Miller, A.I.| year=1981 | title= Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity.

[tpl]Quote|text=The author unjustifiably stated a difference of Lorentz's view and that of mine concerning the physical facts. The question as to whether length contraction really exists or not is misleading. It doesn't "really" exist, in so far as it doesn't exist for a comoving observer; though it "really" exists, i.e. in such a way that it could be demonstrated in principle by physical means by a non-comoving observer.[tpl]cite journal|author=Einstein, Albert|title=Zum Ehrenfestschen Paradoxon.

Variĉaks Aufsatz|journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift|volume=12|pages=509–510|year=1911[/tpl]; Original: Der Verfasser hat mit Unrecht einen Unterschied der Lorentzschen Auffassung von der meinigen mit Bezug auf die physikalischen Tatsachen statuiert. Die Frage, ob die Lorentz-Verkürzung wirklich besteht oder nicht, ist irreführend. Sie besteht nämlich nicht „wirklich“, insofern sie für einen mitbewegten Beobachter nicht existiert; sie besteht aber „wirklich“, d. h. in solcher Weise, daß sie prinzipiell durch physikalische Mittel nachgewiesen werden könnte, für einen nicht mitbewegten Beobachter.|sign=Albert Einstein, 1911[/tpl]
Einstein also argued in that paper, that length contraction is not simply the product of arbitrary definitions concerning the way clock regulations and length measurements are performed. He presented the following thought experiment: Let A'B' and A"B" be the endpoints of two rods of same proper length. Let them move in opposite directions with same speed with respect to a resting coordinate x-axis. Endpoints A'A" meet at point A*, and B'B" meet at point B*, both points being marked on that axis. Einstein pointed out that length A*B* is shorter than A'B' or A"B", which can also be demonstrated by one of the rods when brought to rest with respect to that axis.

==Paradoxes==

Due to superficial application of the contraction formula some paradoxes can occur. For examples see the Ladder paradox or Bell's spaceship paradox. However, those paradoxes can simply be solved by a correct application of relativity of simultaneity. Another famous paradox is the Ehrenfest paradox, which proves that the concept of rigid bodies is not compatible with relativity, and reduces the applicability of Born rigidity. It also shows that for a co-rotating observer the geometry is in fact non-euclidean.

==Visual effects==

Length contraction refers to measurements of position made at simultaneous times according to a coordinate system. This could suggest that if one could take a picture of a fast moving object, that the image would show the object contracted in the direction of motion. However, such visual effects are completely different measurements, as such a photograph is taken from a distance, while length contraction can only directly be measured at the exact location of the object's endpoints. It was shown by several authors such as Roger Penrose and James Terrell that moving objects do not appear length contracted on a photograph.[tpl]cite journal |author=Kraus, U. |year=2000 |title=Brightness and color of rapidly moving objects: The visual appearance of a large sphere revisited |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=56-60 |doi=10.1119/1.19373|url = http://www.tempolimit-lichtgeschwindigkeit.de/sphere/sphere.pdf [/tpl] For instance, for a small angular diameter, a moving sphere remains circular and is rotated.[tpl]cite book|last=Penrose|first=Roger|title=The Road to Reality|year=2005|publisher=Vintage Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-09-944068-0|pages=430–431[/tpl] This kind of visual rotation effect is called Penrose-Terrell rotation.Can You See the Lorentz-Fitzgerald Contraction?

==Derivation==

===Lorentz transformation===

Length contraction can be derived from the Lorentz transformation in several ways:

====Moving length is known====

with respect to which the measured length in S is contracted by
According to the relativity principle, objects that are at rest in S have to be contracted in S' as well. By exchanging the above signs and primes symmetrically, it follows:
Thus the contracted length as measured in S' is given by:

====Proper length is known====

Conversely, if the object rests in S and its proper length is known, the simultaneity of the measurements at the object's endpoints has to be considered in another frame S', as the object constantly changes its position there. Therefore, both spatial and temporal coordinates must be transformed: [tpl]Cite book|author=Bernard Schutz|title=A First Course in General Relativity|chapter=Lorentz contraction|pages=18|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=0521887054[/tpl] ([tpl]Google books quote|id=V1CGLi58W7wC|text=lorentz contraction|page=18|GBS, p. 18.[/tpl]) 
So the moving length in S' is contracted. Likewise, the preceding calculation gives a symmetric result for an object at rest in S':

===Time dilation===

===Geometrical considerations===

Additional geometrical considerations show, that length contraction can be regarded as a trigonometric phenomenon, with analogy to  parallel slices through a cuboid before and after a rotation in E3 (see left half figure at the right).  This is the Euclidean analog of boosting a cuboid in E1,2.  In the latter case, however, we can interpret the boosted cuboid as the world slab of a moving plate.
Image: Left: a rotated cuboid in three-dimensional euclidean space E3. The cross section is longer in the direction of the rotation than it was before the rotation. Right: the world slab of a moving thin plate in Minkowski spacetime (with one spatial dimension suppressed) E1,2, which is a boosted cuboid. The cross section is thinner in the direction of the boost than it was before the boost. In both cases, the transverse directions are unaffected and the three planes meeting at each corner of the cuboids are mutually orthogonal (in the sense of E1,2 at right, and in the sense of E3 at left).
In special relativity, Poincaré transformations are a class of affine transformations which can be characterized as the transformations between alternative Cartesian coordinate charts on Minkowski spacetime corresponding to alternative states of inertial motion (and different choices of an origin).  Lorentz transformations are Poincaré transformations which are linear transformations (preserve the origin). Lorentz transformations play the same role in Minkowski geometry (the Lorentz group forms the isotropy group of the self-isometries of the spacetime) which are played by rotations in euclidean geometry.  Indeed, special relativity largely comes down to studying a kind of noneuclidean trigonometry in Minkowski spacetime, as suggested by the following table:
