Hugh Donnithorne Vyvyan (born 8 September 1976 in Guildford) is a rugby union player who plays at lock for Saracens and England. He stands at 6'6" and weighs around 18 stone.
The former England fullback Jon Callard heavily influenced Hugh's early career while at Downside School, moving him from fly-half to number 8. Brother Charlie, was a number 8 for Sale Sharks, and was another big influence on his career. He also plays lock.
Vyvyan is youngest of seven brothers. In 1993 the brothers created rugby history by making up an entire team in the Penryn Invitation Sevens tournament, (played on Easter day each year in Penryn, Cornwall). The Seven Vyvyan brothers (Richard, Jonathan, Charles, Simon, Paul, James and Hugh) went on to win the tournament, defeating the host club 19 – 17 in the final. They returned the following year and defended the title, with Hugh flying back from South Africa to make up the numbers. In all the brothers reached the final five times, winning three times and twice being runners up.
He opted to take a year out after Downside School and played in South Africa for the Villagers club in Cape Town. Back in England he played briefly for Penryn before starting a successful theology degree at University of Newcastle, where he caught the eye of the Newcastle Falcons and eventually made his debut against Moseley, when the club were in National Division Two.
In 2001 he was an important member of Falcons’ Powergen Cup winning side at Twickenham, a feat he repeated in 2004 as captain.
In 2002 he toured with the full England side and was an unused bench replacement against Argentina.[tpl]cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/international/2060216.stm|title=Argentina beaten by England youngsters|publisher=BBC|date=22 June 2002|accessdate=23 June 2009[/tpl] In that same 2002–2003 season he played for England A against Scotland A and Ireland A and, in December 2003, also helped an England XV beat the New Zealand Barbarians.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/england-youngsters-rise-above-rough-treatment-577398.html|title=England youngsters rise above rough treatment|publisher=The Independent|date=22 December 2003|accessdate=23 June 2009 | location=London | first=Chris | last=Hewett[/tpl]
