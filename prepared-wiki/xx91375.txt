==Description==

This member of the arum family Araceae is an epiphyte with aerial roots, able to grow up to 20 m (65 feet) high with large, leathery, glossy, heart-shaped leaves 25–90 cm (9 to 35 inches) long by 25–75 cm broad. Young plants have leaves that are smaller and entire with no lobes or holes, but soon produce lobed and fenestrate leaves.http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/ceriman.html Fruits of warm climates pp. 15–17 (1987) access date 2010-07-09Liebmann, Frederik Michael. 1849.

Wild seedlings grow towards the darkest area they can find until they find a tree trunk, then start to grow up towards the light, creeping up the tree.Online reference to Monstera deliciosa[tpl]dead link|date=January 2012[/tpl]

==Cultivation==

Monstera deliciosa is commonly grown for interior decoration in public buildings and as a houseplant. It grows best between the temperatures of [tpl]convert|20|-|30|C|F|abbr=on[/tpl] and requires high humidity and shade. Growth ceases below [tpl]convert|10|C|F|abbr=on[/tpl] and it is killed by frost. In the coastal zones of Sicily, especially in the Palermo area, where it is called "zampa di leone" ("lion's paw"), it is often cultivated outdoors.  In ideal conditions it flowers about three years after it is planted. Flowering is rare when grown indoors. The plant can be propagated by taking cuttings of a mature plant or by air layering.

==Fruit==

The fruit of Monstera deliciosa is up to 25 cm long and 3–4 cm diameter, looking like a green ear of maize covered with hexagonal scales.
Fruits of plants of the Araceae (Arum family) often contain Raphides and Trichosclereids – needle-like structures of calcium oxalate.
The fruit may be ripened by cutting it when the first scales begin to lift up and it begins to exude a pungent odor. It is wrapped in a paper bag and set aside until the scales begin popping off. The scales are then brushed off or fall away to reveal the edible flesh underneath. The flesh, which is similar to pineapple in texture, can be cut away from the core and eaten. It has a fruity taste similar to jackfruit and pineapple. The unripe green fruits can irritate the throat and the latex of the leaves and vines can create rashes in the skin, because both contain potassium oxalate: that is the reason why the fruits have to be consumed when the scales lift up.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.reuna.unalmed.edu.co/temporales/memorias/especies/Vegetales/63_plantassilvestresalimenticias.htm |title=Plantas silvestres alimenticias fe uso tradicional en las comunidades de Pacurita, San José de Purre y Guayabal |publisher=Reuna.unalmed.edu.co |date= |accessdate=2012-01-30[/tpl]
Plants grown indoors in temperate regions occasionally produce flowers and fruit.

==Other uses==
