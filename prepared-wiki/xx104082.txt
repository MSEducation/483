2 Young ([tpl]zh|c=早熟[/tpl]) is a 2005 Hong Kong romance film directed by Derek Yee.  The film was released in Mainland China on 15 April 2005 and in Hong Kong on 28 April 2005. 
The literal translation of, (早熟) is "early maturity" and the English title, 2 Young, is a pun on the words "too young". The controversial topic of a pre-marital pregnancy of a minor is what the plot of 2 Young is framed around. Although the seriousness of the subject matter is woven throughout the film and is treated with respect, the overall objective of director, Derek Yee, was to keep the film light with moments of situational and appropriate humor.
2 Young stars Jaycee Chan and Fiona Sit with a supporting cast including Eric Tsang, Teresa Mo, Anthony Wong, and Candice Yu, who play the parents of Jaycee's and Fiona's characters respectively.

==Plot==

Ka Fu (Jaycee Chan) and Natalie (Nam) (Fiona Sit), are from two different family backgrounds. Ka Fu's father (played by Eric Tsang) is a mini-bus driver and his mother (played by Teresa Mo) is a restaurant hostess. Natalie is from a very affluent family and her parents (played by Candice Yu and Anthony Wong) are lawyers.
Another contrast is that Ka Fu has a loving relationship with his parents, but Natalie's relationship with her parents is distant as they are often away on business trips. After Ka Fu and Natalie meet and fall in love, it is exactly this window of opportunity of Natalie's parents' absence that causes the two to have a weak moment in their budding love for each other, which results in Natalie getting pregnant.
Despite her anxiety of this issue, she decides to go through with the pregnancy in complete support of her boyfriend, Ka Fu. However, Natalie, being underage and about two years younger than Ka Fu, causes her parents, especially her father, to fly into a rage and a lawsuit gets under way for Ka Fu and his parents. Ka Fu's parents also scold him and express that they do not want him to make the same mistakes they did.
Learning of the impending legal action, Ka Fu and Natalie, with the help of their friends, run away and eke out a living for themselves in the countryside. The young lovers are eventually discovered by Ka Fu's parents. When Natalie goes into early labor, they are forced to return to the city, where she gives birth to a baby boy (prematurely, although the baby survives) and Ka Fu is arrested. During the court scene, the relationships of the parents and their son and daughter are resolved. Ka Fu was also sentenced to 3 months in a rehabilitation center for his actions. Upon his release, he is greeted by Natalie and their child.
