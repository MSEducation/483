Although he did not attend due to impending death, following the conference √Åron Chorin, on his death-bed, wrote a declaration of his support of its conclusions.
Responding to the various complaints raised over the centuries against the Kol Nidre, the rabbinical conference decided unanimously that the formula was not essential, and that the members of the convention should exert their influence toward securing its abolition,"Protocolle der Ersten Rabbiner Versammlung," p. 41, Brunswick, 1844 before the following Yom Kippur.[tpl]JewishEncyclopedia|article=Conferences[/tpl]
The conference endorsed the Grand Sanhedrin's conclusions, except that they went further in relation to inter-faith marriage, arguing that the marriage of a Jew with the adherent of any monotheistic religion is permissible in Judaism, as long as the civil law in the place of marriage permits the children of such a union to be raised in the Jewish religion.
They also decided that the oath of a Jew would be binding if it invoked the name of God, regardless of any other consideration.
Some Jews opposed the decisions of the conference; Israel Moses Hazan wrote a letter condemning the reforms advocated by it.published in the collection "Kin'at Tziyyon," Amsterdam, 1846 Hirsch Lehren, circulated a letter among several rabbis, which in the autumn following the conference resulted in a protest, signed by seventy-eight Orthodox rabbis of Germany, Bohemia, Moravia, and Hungary, against the results of the conference.June 12-19, 1844; see "Univ.
