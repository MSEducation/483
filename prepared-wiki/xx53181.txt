==Career==

===1993–2002: Career beginnings===

After getting an agent at 6, she worked mostly on commercials and small TV roles. Her first role was "Little Girl" in Royal Celebration, a 1993 TV film. A year later, she had a small role in the film A Village Affair. She later starred in 1995's Innocent Lies and 1998's Coming Home. She was a princess in the 1996 film The Treasure Seekers.Biography Today, pp.83–84 Later in 1999, she appeared as Rose in Oliver Twist.Biography Today, p.84
Knightley appeared in several television films in the mid- to late 1990s—as well as ITV1's The Bill[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/gallery/2010/mar/26/the-bill-stars#/?picture=360874180&index=3|title=Stars who got a break on The Bill|date=26 March 2010|work=The Guardian |location=UK|accessdate=31 August 2010 [/tpl]—before being cast as Sabé, Padmé Amidala's decoy, in the 1999 science fiction blockbuster Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. Sabé's dialogue was dubbed over with Natalie Portman's voice. This was to hide the fact that the handmaiden Padmé (played by Portman) was actually disclosed as the real Queen Amidala at the end of the film. Knightley was cast in the role because of her close resemblance to Portman; even the two actresses' mothers had difficulty telling their daughters apart when the girls were in full makeup.[tpl]cite web|publisher=MSN Movies | title=Keira Knightley | url=http://movies.msn.com/celebrities/celebrity/keira-knightley/?gallery=9700&stab=3 | accessdate=17 March 2006| first=Jason| last=Buchanan[/tpl] In 2000 Knightley appeared in the video to Five's song "Don't Wanna Let You Go".

If you give an actress who is even remotely good the chance to play a fantastic character like that, they are going to revel in it." Variety wrote about her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet: "Looking every bit a star, Knightley, who's shown more spirit than acting smarts so far in her career, really steps up to the plate here, holding her own against the more classically trained Matthew Macfadyen, as well as vets like Brenda Blethyn, Donald Sutherland, Penelope Wilton and Judi Dench with a luminous strength that recalls a young Audrey Hepburn. More than the older Jennifer Ehle in the TV series, she catches Elizabeth's essential skittishness and youthful braggadocio, making her final conversion all the more moving."[tpl]Cite news|last=Elley |first=Derek |title=Pride & Prejudice |publisher=Variety |date=11 September 2005 |url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_review/VE1117928133.html?nav=reviews07&categoryid=1986&cs=1 |accessdate =18 July 2007[/tpl] The film grossed more than $100 million worldwide,[tpl]Cite news|title=Pride and Prejudice |publisher=Box Office Mojo |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=prideandprejudice05.htm |accessdate=20 October 2008[/tpl] and Knightley earned a Golden Globe nomination and an Oscar nomination (the Oscar ultimately went to Reese Witherspoon).

===2008–10: Transition into independent films===

In 2008, Knightley appeared alongside Sienna Miller, Cillian Murphy and Matthew Rhys in John Maybury's The Edge of Love, a fictional wartime drama about Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, his wife Caitlin Macnamara, childhood friend Vera Williams, and her romance and marriage with a British soldier. Penned by Knightley's mother, Sharman Macdonald, the playwright initially crafted the screenplay with Knightley as Macnamara in her mind.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/interview-keira-knightley-hits-a-high-note-in-her-latest-role-849926.html|title=Interview: Keira Knightley hits a high note in her latest role|work=The Independent |date=19 June 2012|accessdate=20 November 2012|location=London[/tpl] Once her daughter agreed to portray Williams, Macdonald enlarged the character, making her a singer.
Knightley, who watched Marlene Dietrich films for preparation, was expecting to mime to her pre-recorded voice, but was told by Maybury to sing live in front of the crew while shooting. "I was shaking like a leaf," Knightley later commented, "I thought my knees were going to buckle. In the first couple of songs, I sounded like a pubescent boy, it was so embarrassing."
