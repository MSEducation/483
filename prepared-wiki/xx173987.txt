The 1984 Rothmans Grand Prix was the first edition of the tournament under the Grand Prix name and had replaced the Professional Players Tournament name, which was used first in 1982.[tpl]cite web|last=Turner|first=Chris|title=Professional Players Tournament, Grand Prix, LG Cup|url=http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/GP.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120216155938/http://www.cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/GP.html|archivedate=16 February 2012|work=cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk|publisher=Chris Turner's Snooker Archive|accessdate=14 September 2012[/tpl] It carried the then highest biggest first prize money in the history of snooker. Unlike the Professional Players Tournament the BBC televised the event, which was held at the Hexagon Theatre in Reading, England. The venue had previously hosted the World Team Classic since 1981, an event formerly also televised by the BBC. It took place between 20 and 28 October 1984.
Dennis Taylor won his first major tournament after 13 years as a professional by defeating Cliff Thorburn 10-2 in the final. But Taylor had a more important personal reason for wanting to win - for the memory of his mother who died the month before. His sadness - and joy - was shared by television viewers all over the United Kingdom. He could not withhold his emotions, particularly when his son rushed forward to congratulate him.
