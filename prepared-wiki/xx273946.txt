The ideal form for a layered drawing would be an upward planar drawing, in which all edges are oriented in a consistent direction and no pairs of edges cross. However, graphs often contain cycles, minimizing the number of inconsistently-oriented edges is NP-hard, and minimizing the number of crossings is also NP-hard, so layered graph drawing systems typically apply a sequence of heuristics that reduce these types of flaws in the drawing without guaranteeing to find a drawing with the minimum number of flaws.

==Layout algorithm==

The construction of a layered graph drawing proceeds in a sequences of steps:
 | last1 = Healy | first1 = Patrick
 | last2 = Nikolov | first2 = Nikola S.
