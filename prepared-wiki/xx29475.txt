===="Al Buraq (Wailing Wall) Rd" sign====

During the Jordanian rule of the Old City, a ceramic street sign in Arabic and English was affixed to the stones of the ancient wall. Attached [tpl]convert|2.1|m[/tpl] up, it was made up of eight separate ceramic tiles and said Al Buraq Road in Arabic at the top with the English "Al-Buraq (Wailing Wall) Rd" below. When Israeli soldiers arrived at the wall in June 1967, one attempted to scrawl Hebrew lettering on it.[tpl]cite book|author=Bezalel Narkiss|title=Picture history of Jewish civilization|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=oWKFAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=May 19, 2011|year=1970|publisher=H.

===Israeli rule 1967–present===

Following Israel's victory during the 1967 Six-Day War, the Western Wall came under Israeli control. Yitzchak Rabin, fifth Prime Minister of Israel, described the moment Israeli soldiers reached the Wall:
 There was one moment in the Six-Day War which symbolized the great victory: that was the moment in which the first paratroopers — under Gur's command — reached the stones of the Western Wall, feeling the emotion of the place; there never was, and never will be, another moment like it. Nobody staged that moment. Nobody planned it in advance. Nobody prepared it and nobody was prepared for it; it was as if Providence had directed the whole thing: the paratroopers weeping — loudly and in pain — over their comrades who had fallen along the way, the words of the Kaddish prayer heard by Western Wall's stones after 19 years of silence, tears of mourning, shouts of joy, and the singing of "Hatikvah".
Forty-eight hours after capturing the wall, the military, without explicit government order, hastily proceeded to demolish the entire Moroccan Quarter which stood [tpl]convert|4|m[/tpl] from the Wall. The Sheikh Eid Mosque, which was built over one of Jerusalem's oldest Islamic schools, the Afdiliyeh, named after one of Saladin's sons, was pulled down to make way for the plaza. It was one of three or four that survived from Saladin's time.Nir Hasson,'Rare photograph reveals ancient Jerusalem mosque destroyed in 1967,' at Haaretz, 15 June 2012. 650 people consisting of 106 Arab families were ordered to leave their homes at night. When they refused, bulldozers began to demolish the structures, causing casualties. One old woman was buried under the houses as the bulldozer razed the area.Ari Shavit,'Jerusalem-born thinker Meron Benvenisti has a message for Israelis: Stop whining,' at Haaretz, 11 October 2012.Gershom Gorenberg, The End of Days: Fundamentalism and the Struggle for the Temple Mount.

According to Eyal Weizman, Chaim Herzog, who later became Israel's sixth president, took much of the credit for the destruction of the neighbourhood:
 When we visited the Wailing Wall we found a toilet attached to it ... we decided to remove it and from this we came to the conclusion that we could evacuate the entire area in front of the Wailing Wall ... a historical opportunity that will never return ... We knew that the following Saturday, June 14, would be the Jewish festival of Shavuot and that many will want to come to pray ... it all had to be completed by then.[ref]

The narrow pavement, which could accommodate a maximum of 12,000 per day, was transformed into an enormous plaza which could hold in excess of 400,000.[ref]
</ref>
Several months later, the pavement close to the wall was excavated to a depth of two and half meters, exposing an additional two courses of large stones.[tpl]cite book | author = Meron Benvenisti | title = Jerusalem: the Torn City | year = 1976 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | pages = 312–313[/tpl]
A complex of buildings against the wall at the southern end of the plaza, that included Madrasa Fakhriya and the house that the Abu al-Sa'ud family had occupied since the 16th century, were spared in the 1967 destruction, but demolished in 1969.Reinventing Jerusalem:Israel's Reconstruction of the Jewish Quarter after 1967, Simone Ricca, pp. 67–113[tpl]cite book | title = Unearthing Jerusalem : 150 Years of Archaeological Research in the Holy City | editor = Gideon Avni and Katharina Galor | chapter = Mamluk and Ottoman Jerusalem | author = Robert Schick | pages = 475–490[/tpl] The section of the wall dedicated to prayers was thus extended southwards to double its original length, from [tpl]convert|28|to|60|m[/tpl], while the [tpl]convert|4|m[/tpl] space facing the wall grew to [tpl]convert|40|m[/tpl]. 
The dusty plaza stretched from the wall to the Jewish Quarter. The small, approximately [tpl]convert|120|m2[/tpl] pre-1967 area in front of the wall grew to [tpl]convert|2400|m2[/tpl], with the entire Western Wall Plaza covering [tpl]convert|20000|m2|acre[/tpl].
The new plaza created in 1967 is used for worship and public gatherings, including Bar mitzvah celebrations and the swearing-in ceremonies of newly full-fledged soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces. Tens of thousands of Jews flock to the wall on the Jewish holidays, and particularly on the fast of Tisha B'Av, which marks the destruction of the Temple and on Jerusalem Day, which commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 and the delivery of the Wall into Jewish hands.

====Robinson's Arch====

At the southern end of the Western Wall, Robinson's Arch along with a row of vaults once supported stairs ascending from the street to the Temple Mount.Jewish Virtual Library, retrieved March 26, 2011.  Because it does not come under the direct control of the Rabbi of the Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the site has been opened to religious groups that hold worship services that would not be approved by the Rabbi or the Ministry in the major men's and women's prayer areas against the Wall.
The need for such an area became apparent when in 1989, after repeated attacks by haredim, activists belonging to a group called Women Of The Wall petitioned to secure the right of women to pray at the wall without restrictions. Ultimately, in 2003 Israel's Supreme Court disallowed any women from reading publicly from the Torah or wearing traditional prayer shawls at the plaza itself, but instructed the Israeli government to prepare the site of Robinson's Arch to host such events.[tpl]Cite news|last=Nathan-Kazis|first=Josh|title=Embassy Letter on Kotel Rubs Salt in the Wound|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/124477/|accessdate=July 13, 2010|newspaper=The Jewish Daily Forward|date=February 5, 2010|location=New York, New York[/tpl] The site was inaugurated in August 2004 and has since hosted services by Reform and Conservative groups, as well as services by the Women of the Wall.
In November 2010, the government approved a NIS 85m ($23m) scheme to improve access and infrastructure at the site.Israel approves $23 million plan to renovate near Western Wall, Haartez, (November 21, 2010).
The Isaiah Stone, located under Robinson's Arch, has a carved inscription in Hebrew from Isaiah 66:14: 
וראיתם ושש לבכם ועצמותיכם כדשא תפרחנה ("And when ye see this your heart shall rejoice and your bones shall flourish like an herb").
In April 2013, Jewish Agency for Israel leader Natan Sharansky spearheaded a concept that would expand and renovate the Robinson's Arch area into an area where people may "perform worship rituals not based on the Orthodox interpretation of Jewish tradition."Guttman, Nathan and Jane Eisner.  "Kotel Egalitarian Prayer Plan Set in Motion by Dramatic Western Wall Compromise." The Jewish Daily Forward.   10 April 2013.  11 April 2013. The concept was supported by the Reform Jewish movement and, as of this writing, there is no significant opposition from the Orthodox Jewish movement.

====Wilson's Arch====

In 2005, the Western Wall Heritage Foundation initiated a major renovation effort under Rabbi-of-the-Wall Shmuel Rabinovitch.  Its goal was to renovate and restore the area within Wilson's Arch, the covered area to the left of worshipers facing the Wall in the open prayer plaza, in order to increase access for visitors and for prayer.English.thekotel.org TheKotel.org, retrieved March 11, 2011.iaa-conservation.org, retrieved March 11, 2011.
The restoration to the men's section included a Torah ark that can house over 100 Torah scrolls, in addition to new bookshelves, a library, heating for the winter, and air conditioning for the summer.  A new room was also built for the scribes who maintain and preserve the Torah scrolls used at the Wall. New construction also included a women's section,The Kotel, note about May 25, 2006., retrieved March 11, 2011. overlooking the men's prayer area, so that women could use this separate area to "take part in the services held inside under the Arch" for the first time.English.TheKotel.org, retrieved March 24, 2011.
On July 25, 2010, a Ner Tamid, an oil-burning "eternal light," was installed within the prayer hall within Wilson's Arch, the first eternal light installed in the area of the Western Wall.Thekotel.org, note for July 25, 2010, retrieved March 12, 2011.  According to the Western Wall Heritage Foundation, requests had been made for many years that "an olive oil lamp be placed in the prayer hall of the Western Wall Plaza, as is the custom in Jewish synagogues, to represent the menorah of the Temple in Jerusalem as well as the continuously burning fire on the altar of burnt offerings in front of the Temple," especially in the closest place to those ancient flames.
A number of special worship events have been held since the renovation.  They have taken advantage of the cover, temperature control,The Kotel.org, note on February 3, 2006., retrieved March 13, 2011. and enhanced security.TheKotel.org, Lag B'omer 2009, retrieved March 13, 2011. However, in addition to the more recent programs, one early event occurred in September 1983, even before the modern renovation.  At that time U.S. Sixth Fleet Chaplain Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff was allowed to hold an unusual interfaith service—the first interfaith service ever conducted at the Wall during the time it was under Israeli control—that included men and women sitting together. The ten-minute service included the Priestly Blessing, recited by Resnicoff, who is a Kohen. A Ministry of Religions representative was present, responding to press queries that the service was authorized as part of a special welcome for the U.S. Sixth Fleet.Jerusalem Post, Sep 5, 1983, and Jerusalem Post International Edition, Sep 11–17, 1983, "U.S. Navy Chaplain Conducts Western Wall Interfaith Litany"St Petersburg Times, retrieved March 25, 2011

====Rabbis of the wall====

After the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, Rabbi Yehuda Meir Getz was named the overseer of proceedings at the wall. After Rabbi Getz's death in 1995, Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz was given the position.

==Theology and ritual==

===Judaism===

In Judaism, the Western Wall is venerated as the sole remnant of the Holy Temple. It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, as it is the closest permitted accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the Even ha-shetiya or Foundation Stone, which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by Kareth.  While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the Dome of the Rock is the Foundation Stone,Radbaz Responsa 691: "Under the dome on the Temple Mount, which the Arabs call El-Sakhrah, without a doubt, is the location of the Foundation Stone."; Ya'ari, Avraham: Igrot Eretz Yisrael by Obadiah ben Abraham, Ramat Gan 1971: "I sought the place of the Foundation Stone where the Ark of the Covenant was placed, and many people told me it is under a tall and beautiful dome which the Arabs built in the Temple precinct." some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain.Sternbuch, Moishe Teshuvos Ve-hanhagos Vol. 3, Ch. 39: “In truth they have erred, thinking that the stone upon they built their dome was in fact the Foundation Stone, however, most possibly, the Stone is located further to the south in the open space opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall.” This spot was the site of the Holy of Holies when the Temple stood.
Jewish tradition teaches that the Western Wall was built by King Solomon and that the wall we see today is built upon his foundations, which date from the time of the First Temple.Frishman, Avraham; Kum Hisalech Be’aretz, Jerusalem 2004 Jewish midrashic texts compiled in Late Antiquity refer to a western wall of the Temple which “would never be destroyed.” Some scholars were of the opinion that this referred to a wall of the Temple itself which has long since vanished. Others believed that the wall still stood and was actually a surviving wall of the Temple courtyard. However, today there is no doubt that the wall is the western retaining wall of the Temple Mount and the Midrash refers to the Temple in its broader sense, that is, the Temple Mount.[ref]
