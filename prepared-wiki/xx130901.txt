Loughmore, officially Loughmoe ([tpl]IPAc-en|l|ɒ|x|ˈ|m|oʊ[/tpl] [tpl]respell|lokh|MOH|'[/tpl]; [tpl]lga|Luach Maigh[/tpl] or Luachma),Placenames Database of Ireland is a village in North Tipperary, Ireland. The village is best known for Loughmoe Castle, seat of the Barons of Loughmoe.
It is one half of the parish of Loughmore-CastleineyParishes in Cashel and Emly Diocese http://www.cashel-emly.ie/main/parishes/templemore.htm in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly. Loughmoe gives its name to the civil parish of Loughmoe West which is in the historical barony of Eliogarty.

==Toponymy==

The village's Irish-language name Luach Maigh (earlier: Luach-mhagh) means "reward-field". Today's Loughmore – which would correspond to Irish Loch Mór ("great lake") – is the result of a mistake by British mapmakers of the 19th century. The Purcell family's Loughmoe Castle, near the village, retains a more accurate and older version of the name.
Why certain localities in Ireland were given this name is probably accounted for by the circumstance that "in old times some tenant held them free of direct rent, as a reward for some signal service, or on condition of fulfilling some special duty".http://www.usa-purcell.com/loughmoe.html The Legend of Loughmoe Castle However, a local tradition explains that in this particular case the name alludes to the manner in which the Purcells first gained proprietorship of area. Legend has it that a king lived in the Castle, and offered his daughters hand to whomsoever could rid the land of a boar and sow of "gigantic size" who uprooted crops and killed whoever they came into contact with. A youth named Purcell killed the boar with a bow and arrow and thus the area in which the Castle stands is known as "the field of the reward". The legend is alluded to in the Purcell family's coat of arms, which depicts the heads of four boars.

Castleiney itself is located some 5 km away and closer to Templemore. The parish is located in the region known as the Golden Vale, one of the richest agricultural areas in Europe. Dairy farming and cattle raising are the principal occupations.

The N62 highway links Loughmore with the M8 motorway to Cork as well as the M7 to Dublin and Limerick.
Loughmore's very central location means it is within ninety minutes drive of three international airports: Cork, Dublin and Shannon.

==History==

===Loughmoe Castle===

Loughmoe Castle was the seat of the Purcell family, who were Barons of Loughmoe. Construction of the castle commenced in 1328: the same year that the family were granted the title of Barons of Loughmoe by James Butler, first Earl of Ormonde. Until the 1980s it was possible to climb the spiral stair in the right hand tower. The monument is now in the care of the Office of Public Works.
The title Baron of Loughmoe is an Irish feudal barony. The title was possibly raised to a Jacobite peerage in 1690 while King James II of England was in exile. The feudal title was granted to Richard Purcell in 1328 by James Butler, 1st Earl of Ormond as palatine Lord of Tipperary. Irish and Scottish feudal titles, particularly those granted by palatine lords, are difficult to classify in law, they are acknowledged as genuine hereditaments by the arms granting bodies of Ireland, Scotland, and England, but were never formally recognised by the Crown.
Though referring to the Purcells of Loughmoe specifically, the medieval Irish genealogist Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh wrote that Purcell genealogy begins with Charlemagne, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.

===The Cormack Brothers===

Daniel and William Cormack were executed for the murder of John Ellis, a land agent from Kilrush, near Templemore, County Tipperary. Ellis was greatly disliked in the district for evicting tenants on behalf of the landlords who employed him. One night as he returned to his isolated home he found uprooted bushes and branches blocking the lane. He was shot by a hidden assailant and died an hour later.
The police felt there was no doubt that this was a political murder, because £90 in Ellis’s wallet was left untouched. The brothers William and Daniel Cormack were arrested and convicted at Nenagh Assizes in March 1858, largely, it was felt at the time, on the evidence of an informer – “a villainous character” – who was widely believed to have been in on the murder plot.
The commonly held view was that a local landlord had shot Ellis in a crime of passion involving Ellis' sister, and that the Cormack brothers had been framed for murder. 2,357 people signed a petition protesting the brothers' innocence
The brothers were hanged on Thursday, May 13, 1858, outside Nenagh Prison.
When Daniel Cormack mounted the scaffold he addressed the audience: “Lord have mercy on me, for you know, Jesus, that I neither had hand, act, nor part in that for which I am about to die. Good people, pray for me.” According to a contemporary report, “the brother having made the same awful declaration, both were in the next moment launched into eternity.”
A man named Michael Gleeson, who had been recently evicted by Ellis later confessed to the murder.New York Times, May 12, 1910
In 1910 a committee was formed in Loughmore to exhume the brothers and rebury them in the local churchyard. Daniel and William's remains were removed from Nenagh Gaol and brought back to Loughmore in a major ceremony, with two hearses drawn by plumed horses and followed by huge crowds. After the procession arrived in the village, the Cormack brothers were buried in a large mausoleum in the churchyard where people still go to see the original oak coffins and the inscription proclaiming the brothers' innocence.
On one side of the mausoleum is inscribed:
