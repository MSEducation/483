Mark Allan Hoppus (born March 15, 1972) is an American musician, record producer, and television host best known as the bassist and one of two lead vocalists for the rock band Blink-182. Born in Ridgecrest, California, Hoppus spent his childhood moving back and forth between his mother and father's houses, as they divorced when he was in third grade. He became interested in skateboarding and punk rock in junior high, and received a bass guitar from his father at the age of fifteen. After moving to San Diego in 1992, Hoppus' sister introduced him to Tom DeLonge, and together with drummer Scott Raynor, they formed the band Blink-182.
Blink-182 produced several indie recordings and toured exhaustively before signing to major label MCA to co-distribute their sophomore effort, 1997's Dude Ranch, which featured the Hoppus-penned hit "Dammit". After replacing Raynor with Travis Barker, the trio recorded Enema of the State (1999), which launched the band into multiplatinum success, becoming the biggest pop punk act of the era. Two more records followed—the heavier Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001) and the more experimental Blink-182 (2003)—before the band split in 2005 following internal tension. Hoppus continued playing with Barker in +44 in the late 2000s. Blink-182 reunited in 2009 and have since released two new recordings and have toured worldwide.
Aside from his musical career, Hoppus has had multiple successes behind the recording console, producing records for groups such as Idiot Pilot, New Found Glory, The Matches, and Motion City Soundtrack. He has previously co-owned two companies, Atticus and Macbeth Footwear, and has begun a clothing line named Hi My Name is Mark. Hoppus hosted a weekly podcast in 2005 and 2006 and hosted his own television talk show, Hoppus on Music, from 2010 to 2012 on Fuse. In 2014 Mark and his friend Chris Holmes started a band called Nothing and Nobody.

==Life and career==

===Origins and early life===

Mark Hoppus was born in Ridgecrest, California on March 15, 1972 to Kerry Wernz and Tex Hoppus. Ridgecrest is a small town in the California desert, composed mainly of what Hoppus later described as "geniuses, scientists, physicists and then just complete strung-out meth-heads." His father, like many in Ridgecrest, worked for the U.S. Department of Defense, designing missiles and bombs for the town's Navy testing center. Hoppus describes himself as "pretty mellow" until his parents divorced at age eight, which had a "drastic, unsettling effect" on him. "When my parents argued, it was always behind closed doors. I remember sitting outside my parents' room when I was seven years old, hearing the dulled voice of anger behind the door. It upset me a lot." Following these events, he spent two years shuffling between his parents' homes with sister Anne, until he and his father moved to nearby Monterey. His father was often away earning a postgraduate degree in college. He later would describe his childhood as lonely, remarking, "I was living by myself in the fifth grade."[tpl]cite journal |last=Edwards|first=Gavin |date=August 2000 |title=The Half Naked Truth About Blink-182 |journal=Rolling Stone |ref=harv[/tpl]
Hoppus describes himself as "pretty straight" until junior high, when he began skateboarding and listening to punk rock.[tpl]cite web|last= Eaton|first=Michael|url=http://www.risenmagazine.com/category/music/mark-hoppus/|title=Blink And You'll See It|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110715185746/http://www.risenmagazine.com/category/music/mark-hoppus/|archivedate=July 25, 2011|publisher=Risen|accessdate=September 1, 2010[/tpl] He lived in Fairfax, Virginia (a suburb of Washington, D.C.) during his early high school years and attended Annandale High School during his sophomore year, at which time he received his first bass guitar and attended his first concert: They Might Be Giants at the 9:30 Club shortly before his sixteenth birthday, March 4, 1988.[tpl]cite interview| last        = Othello| first       = Chris| subjectlink = WJFK-FM| interviewer = Mark Hoppus| title       = The C and O Show with Chris and Othello| program     = WJFK-FM| callsign    = WJFK-FM| city        = Manassas, Virginia| date        = March 2, 2011| accessdate  = March 3, 2011[/tpl] "I didn't know where I should stand or what I should do, so my friends and I bought some menthol cigarettes and smoked for the first time and tried to look as cool as we could. We probably looked like idiots," Hoppus remembered. Hoppus received his first bass (a Mako) as a gift from his father, purchased at a local music shop in Annandale.[tpl]cite journal| last =Scaggs| first =Austin| date =February 5, 2004| title =Interview: Mark Hoppus of Blink-182| journal =Rolling Stone| volume = | issue =941 | page =| publisher =Wenner Media LLC| location =New York City | issn =0035-791X[/tpl] He earned money for a set of amplifiers by helping him paint his house.[tpl]cite web| url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/08/27/1093518062841.html| title = Mark Hoppus unplugged| accessdate = 2007-02-28| author = Dowling, Joshua| date = 2004-08-27| publisher = The Sydney Morning Herald[/tpl] Hoppus never took bass lessons, instead he taught himself by playing to bands such as the Descendents, The Cure, and Bad Religion. Hoppus has remarked that "Silly Girl" by the Descendents was the "song that made me fall in love with punk rock music … that song changed my life forever."[tpl]cite news|volume=1428|title=111 Songs That Saved Your Life|date=August 18, 2012 |publisher=Kerrang! |accessdate=October 9, 2013[/tpl] Likewise, Hoppus borrowed a cassette version of The Cure's Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me from friend Wendy Franklin the summer following junior high school and was taken with "Just Like Heaven".[tpl]cite news|author=Tom Bryant|title=The Songs That Changed Your Life|year=2006 |publisher=Kerrang! |accessdate=November 21, 2013[/tpl] 

Hoppus began to dress like frontman Robert Smith, donning eyeliner and "occasionally bright red lipstick" to his high school classes ("This all went over exceedingly well with the faculty and staff in the small desert town where I grew up," Hoppus remarked in 2009).[tpl]cite news|url=|title=Mark Hoppus on the Cure|author=Scott Heisel|pages=108|date=July 2009 |publisher=Alternative Press |accessdate=November 21, 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite book |last= Hoppus |first= Anne |coauthors= Blink-182 |title= Blink-182: Tales from Beneath Your Mom |publisher= MTV Books / Pocket Books|date=October 2001 |isbn= 0-7434-2207-4[/tpl] Beginning in his freshman year, Hoppus gained solace through music of both The Cure and The Smiths.[tpl]cite journal| last = Everett| first = Jenny| date = Fall 2001| title =Blink-182 Cordially Invites You To Take Them Seriously| journal = MH-18| volume = | issue = | page = p.81| publisher =Rodale Press| location = [/tpl] Hoppus played by himself and sang in the band Pier 69, primarily covering songs by The Cure, and recorded a live demo with a group named The Attic Children in 1988, featuring covers of The Cure songs. Hoppus returned to Ridgecrest in 1989, completing high school at Burroughs High School. In his teen years, a friend of Hoppus would steal his mother's car in the middle of the night and pick Hoppus up; the two would sneak out to the desert and burn trees and any objects they could find. He occasionally dabbled in ecstasy, but quit when he mistakenly received heroin instead.
After graduating from Burroughs High School in 1990, he began playing in a band called Of All Things he formed with two friends, covering songs by Descendents, Social Distortion and Bad Religion, as well as writing original punk numbers. The group primarily performed at friend's parties and bonfires, and once played Oasis, the local music venue. Hoppus left Ridgecrest in summer 1992 to attend college and get a job at a local music store in San Diego. Hoppus continued playing gigs with Of All Things, returning on weekends. Eventually, Hoppus' manager became suspicious of his weekend activities (Hoppus having told him he worked with mentally disabled children in Ridgecrest) and refused any time off on weekends. His "short lived attempt" at college, studying at California State University, San Marcos, revolved around plans to become an English teacher.[tpl]cite news|last=Hochman|first=Steve|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/30/entertainment/ca-42373|title=Psst...Blink-182 Is Growing Up|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=May 30, 1999|accessdate=September 20, 2012[/tpl] He recalls he "hated" college and his reasoning behind becoming a teacher involved sights set for educational reform. He dropped out in the early 1990s after "things began to take off with Blink-182" and lived with his mother for many of the early years of the band.[tpl]cite journal |last=|first= |date=August 2001|title=Interview with Mark Hoppus of Blink-182 Blink-182 |journal= NY Rock|ref=harv[/tpl] Hoppus describes his mother as always supportive in his decisions to drop out of college and tour with Blink-182; however, he describes his father as "more realistic, ... he said, 'Have something to fall back on.'" "I'm really fortunate that my mom always completely supported me, even to the point that I dropped out of college and lived at her house for five years before our band started to catch on," said Hoppus.

===Beginnings of music career===

After moving to San Diego in the summer of 1992, Hoppus was reunited with his sister Anne Hoppus, to whom he expressed his desire to be in a band. Anne attended Rancho Bernardo High School, and had become friends with new student Tom DeLonge over the summer. In August 1992, Anne introduced the two, and Hoppus and DeLonge immediately began performing music in DeLonge's garage. To impress DeLonge, Hoppus climbed to the top of a streetlight outside of DeLonge's home – however, he broke both ankles on the way down, resulting in being in crutches for the next few weeks.Hoppus, 2001. pp. 8–9 DeLonge recalled the meeting in 2000: "When I first met Mark, we were running around naked, doing weird stuff. We were up skateboarding until late hours of the morning, antagonizing security guards, and we were just always having fun."[tpl]cite web|last= |first= |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/b/blink00/index.jhtml|title=Blink-182: Enema of the Stage|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=2010-06-01[/tpl] DeLonge recruited old friend Scott Raynor from his days at Poway to become the drummer for the new band, named Blink.
Hoppus and his girlfriend at this time lived in a basement apartment, barely scraping together funds to pay rent. With money in savings, Hoppus went out and bought his first professional equipment: a new amp and bass cabinet. He came home and his girlfriend proceeded to argue with him, angry that he spent money on something they did not need. "I just kept telling her that this was what mattered to me, this was my life," Hoppus recalled. She demanded he make a choice between the band and her, which resulted in Hoppus leaving the band shortly after formation.Hoppus, 2001. pp. 13–15 Shortly thereafter, DeLonge told Hoppus he had borrowed a four track recorder from a friend and was preparing to record a demo tape, which prompted Hoppus to break up with his girlfriend and return to the band. Flyswatter—a combination of original songs and punk covers—was recorded in Raynor's bedroom and landed the band their first shows.Hoppus, 2001. p. 16 Three more demos were recorded over the course of 1993 and the band began performing its irreverent live show at local all-ages venue SOMA, which alerted local independent label Cargo Music.Hoppus, 2001. p. 24–25 Cargo signed the band on a trial basis, and Hoppus was the only member to sign the contract, as DeLonge was at work at the time and Raynor was still a minor.Hoppus, 2001. p. 30 During this time, Hoppus lived at home in San Diego at his mother's, where the band would prepare cassette demos and the entire family would fold cassette inserts. Raynor, whose parents moved to Reno, Nevada, stayed with Hoppus in summer 1994.Hoppus, 2001. p. 28
Blink's first album, Cheshire Cat (1994), was a strong seller for the independent band and would come to be regarded as iconic within the skate punk scene. In 1995, the band signed on for their first national tour, which extended as far as the East Coast. The band purchased their own tour van and embarked on the GoodTimes tour with Unwritten Law, Sprung Monkey and 7 Seconds.Hoppus, 2001. p. 44 The band slowly built a young, devoted following with indie recordings and an endless series of performances and various clubs and festivals.Romanowski, Patricia. George-Warren, Holly. Pareles, Jon. (2001). The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll (Revised and Updated for the 21st Century). New York: Touchstone, 1136 pp. First edition, 2001. MCA Records signed the band in 1996 and would co-distribute their next release, the sophomore effort Dude Ranch. Hoppus penned the record's lead single, "Dammit (Growing Up)", which became a nationwide rock radio hit single as the band toured on the Vans Warped Tour.Hoppus, 2001. p. 70[tpl]cite journal| date =January 24, 1998| title =Blink 182 Propelled By Cargo's Vision| journal =Billboard| volume =110 | issue = 4| pages =11, 100 | publisher =Prometheus Global Media| location =New York City| issn =0006-2510| url =http://books.google.com/?id=nA0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA98&dq=blink+billboard+1998#v=onepage&q=blink%20billboard%201998&f=false | accessdate =December 16, 2012[/tpl]

===Multiplatinum success===

Hoppus grew increasingly lonely on these tours, having no significant other while other band members did. The exhaustive schedule created tensions within the band, who would fire Raynor in the summer of 1998 in mysterious circumstances never fully explained.Hoppus, 2001. p. 81 With new drummer Travis Barker behind the kit, the trio hit the studio with producer Jerry Finn and recorded Enema of the State, which launched the band's career, catapulting them into the "stratosphere of pop music" and solidifying them as the biggest pop punk act of the era.[tpl]cite web |title=How Did Blink-182 Become So Influential?|author=James Montgomery|publisher=MTV News |date=February 9, 2009|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1604639/20090209/blink_182.jhtml|accessdate=February 9, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AUBbmADV|archivedate=September 6, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite journal| date =October 12, 2012| title =Tom DeLonge talks guitar tones, growing up and Blink| journal =Total Guitar| publisher =Future Publishing | location =Bath, Somerset| issn =1355-5049 | url =http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/tom-delonge-talks-guitar-tones-growing-up-and-blink-565422 | accessdate =October 13, 2012[/tpl] Three singles were released from the record—"What's My Age Again?", "All the Small Things", and "Adam's Song"—that crossed over into Top 40 radio format and experienced major commercial success.Hoppus, 2001. p. 96 Hoppus got married in 2000 (see Personal life) just before the band prepared to record their highly anticipated follow-up, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001). Hoppus felt complacent creatively but DeLonge felt otherwise, creating post-hardcore side project Box Car Racer to experiment with ideas he deemed unsuitable for Blink.Shooman, 2010. p. 92
Hoppus felt betrayed (Barker was also in Box Car Racer) and a rift developed between Hoppus and DeLonge that would carry on into the band's future.[tpl]cite web |title=Tom DeLonge: No More Compromises|author=James Montgomery|publisher=MTV News |date=October 28, 2005|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/b/blink_182/qa_feature_103105/|accessdate=September 9, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AYN98wGy|archivedate=September 9, 2012[/tpl] When the band regrouped to record their next record in 2003, all of the members had become fathers (or, in the case of Barker, becoming one) and the trio took a darker, more "mature" direction with their eponymous fifth studio album, infusing experimentalist elements into their usual pop punk sound partially inspired by Box Car Racer.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1476576/20030811/blink_182.jhtml |title=Blink-182 Tone Down Pranks, Get Down to Real ‘Action’ on Next LP |author=Jon Wiederhorn|date=August 11, 2003|publisher=MTV News |accessdate=September 22, 2010[/tpl] Unresolved feelings from that project would arise in late 2004 when the band began to argue regarding their future and recording process. The February 2005 break-up of Blink-182 affected Hoppus greatly: "I had no idea what to do. After Blink broke up I had such a loss of identity and purpose. I just had a giant sense of void."[tpl]cite journal| last =Allen | first =Matt | date =October 1, 2011| title = Friends Reunited?| journal = Kerrang!| volume = | issue = 1383| page = p.22–27| publisher = Bauer Media Group| location = | issn = | url = | accessdate = [/tpl] Hoppus then began to work on even darker, electronic demos with Barker in his kitchen.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-live-0426-luis-20100426,0,1265805.story?page=1 | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Tom DeLonge glad he's back with Blink | first=Luis | last=Arroyave | date=April 26, 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1499838/blink182s-hoppus-barker-form-side-project.jhtml|title=Blink-182's Hoppus, Barker Form Electronic Side Project|author=James Montgomery|date=April 8, 2005|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=April 10, 2011[/tpl] He also turned to producing, hitting the studio with Motion City Soundtrack to record Commit This to Memory (2005).[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1617362/motion-city-soundtrack-tell-blink-182s-mark-hoppus-how-great.jhtml|title=Motion City Soundtrack Tell Blink-182's Mark Hoppus How Great He Is|author=James Montgomery|date=July 31, 2009|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=November 4, 2012[/tpl] In October 2005, Hoppus and Barker purchased a studio together (named Opra Music), where they would bring together a full band to expand upon those electronic demos, creating +44's When Your Heart Stops Beating (2006).[tpl]cite journal| last = Griffin| first = JR| date = December 2006| title = Blink & You'll Miss It| journal = Alternative Press| volume = | issue = 221| page = p.136–140| publisher = Alternative Magazines Inc.| location = | issn = 1065-1667| url =http://www.altpress.com/magazine/issue/221_-_my_chemical_romance  | accessdate =January 12, 2013 [/tpl]

===Reuniting and recent events===

The band reconnected musically and emotionally on the reunion tour, but were still "on eggshells" throughout the recording of their comeback album. The recording's delay was due to the way the band chose to work — in bits and pieces, alone and together, in a pair of California studios — in addition to each member's busy schedules.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1661525/blink-182-mark-hoppus-new-album.jhtml|title=Mark Hoppus Says Blink-182 Are 'Working Very Hard' On New Album|author=James Montgomery|date=April 27, 2011|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=July 15, 2011[/tpl] The band struggled to record juggling individual priorities; in the case of Hoppus, his new television show Hoppus on Music required him flying to New York once a week.[tpl]cite journal| last = Heisel| first = Scott| date = October 2011| title = Re-Start The Machine| journal = Alternative Press| volume = | issue = 279| page = p.93–102| publisher = Alternative Magazines Inc.| location = | issn = 1065-1667| url = http://www.altpress.com/magazine/issue/2791_blink_182 | accessdate = [/tpl] Hoppus moved to London with his family late in the recording process, also complicating matters. The band's comeback album, Neighborhoods (2011), debuted high but undersold label expectations, and Blink-182 parted with Interscope Records in 2012, going independent for their next release, the EP Dogs Eating Dogs.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1481418/blink-182-laughing-again-after-shaky-reunion-album|title=Blink-182 'Laughing' Again After Shaky Reunion Album|author=Sarah Maloy|date=December 13, 2012|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=December 13, 2012[/tpl]

"We probably have seven or eight songs in various stages of completion," Hoppus remarked in August 2013. "I still haven't chosen a name the project yet; we still have to figure that out. It's like guitar mixed with electronics…. at this point." Hoppus will share lead vocals with Holmes on the tracks. On April 25, 2014 Mark announced that his and Chris's band is called Nothing and Nobody. Their first album is expected to be released in "not-too-distant future".https://twitter.com/markhoppus/status/459799008048078848
In non-musical endeavors, Hoppus launched his own clothing line, Hi My Name is Mark, in July 2013.

==Musical style and equipment==

Hoppus primarily writes most of his songs on an acoustic guitar. Hoppus is self-taught, "and consequently I don't have the best technique," he remarked in 2004. "I think you would learn how to paint by painting, rather than reading books about painters or painting and I think it's the same with music. You learn by doing and getting influences from other artists."
Hoppus used three different bass guitars while recording Enema of the State (1999), a Fender P-Bass, Fender Jazz Bass and an Ernie Ball Musicman. Hoppus primarily recorded with the two Fender basses, and merged the two together for the Fender Mark Hoppus Jazz Bass, which debuted in 2000. "I took a Jazz Bass body because I thought it looked really cool and gives a good tone and then I put a P-Bass neck on it because it's a wider neck and it's easier to play--especially for my style, which isn't so much finger work," he said.[tpl]cite web|url=https://gc.guitarcenter.com/interview/markhoppus/ |title=Mark Hoppus Talks About Touring, Basses and Success|publisher=Guitar Center|date=2002|accessdate=April 26, 2014[/tpl]
For live sound, Hoppus plugs his basses into three Ampeg SVT Classic bass heads running into two Ampeg 8x10 SVT bass cabs. Prior to the use of the all-tube SVT Classic heads, Hoppus used two Ampeg SVT-4 Pro heads which only feature a tube preamp.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.ampeg.com/artists/artist.php?artistID=78 |title=Artist Profile – Mark Hoppus |publisher=Ampeg |accessdate=July 11, 2011[/tpl]

Hoppus and Tom DeLonge co-owned two companies, Atticus and Macbeth Footwear, Hoppus has since sold his share in both companies; as well as loserkids.com.[tpl]cite web| url = http://postblink.com/?p=20 | title = Mark Hoppus Interview with b182.com| accessdate = 2007-10-24| author = b182.com| date = 2006-08-14[/tpl]

==Personal life==

Hoppus married Skye Everly on December 2, 2000. Hoppus met Everly at a rehearsal for the music video to the Blink-182 single "All the Small Things". According to a 2004 interview, Everly, who was then an MTV talent executive, initially said no to dating Hoppus: "Tom DeLonge always used to embarrass me. Any girl he’d talk to, he’d say, 'Hey, you wanna go on a date with Mark?' He asked Skye, my wife, who looked at me and said 'No.' That’s how it all started."[tpl]cite web|last= Weiner|first=Jonah|title=The Greatest Songs Ever! All the Small Things – Blender|publisher=Blender|date=November 23, 2004|accessdate=June 2, 2010[/tpl] Two years later, Skye gave birth to their son, Jack Hoppus on August 5, 2002. The three are currently[tpl]when|date=March 2014[/tpl] living in London. However, Hoppus announced on his blog that he planned to reside in the United Kingdom for one year only.[tpl]citequote|date=March 2014[/tpl] After that he would return to the United States. However after a year Hoppus didn't move back to the United States and is still currently[tpl]when|date=March 2014[/tpl] residing in the United Kingdom.
Hoppus relocated to Mayfair, London in 2011, when Blink-182 were in the process of completing their sixth album, Neighborhoods. He enjoys jogging in the city's parks.  He is a fan of Chelsea F.C. (“Everbody rails me for supporting them, but it’s just the closest team to where I live!”)[tpl]cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/music/post/_/id/330/blink-182s-mark-hoppus-adopts-chelsea|title=Blink-182's Mark Hoppus adopts Chelsea|first1=Zach|last1=McCann|website=go.com|accessdate=2014-03-21|publisher=ESPN[/tpl]
In 2004, Hoppus told Risen that he was a registered libertarian. "To me it means to respect other people and let them do their own thing. The government is there to help people but not control them," he remarked. A 2000 Rolling Stone profile notes that Hoppus "prays every night." He elaborated on his religious views in a 2005 interview: "It’s amazing to me that anyone can say that one thing is right. ... To draw lines over something that none of us on earth could possibly comprehend seems like a waste of time."
