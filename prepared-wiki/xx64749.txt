Pepper began entertaining on Vaudeville in his youth with his sisters Helen and Winnie Mae. Jack Pepper first came to national prominence in the 1920s as part of the duo "Salt and Pepper" with Frank Salt. Pepper sang and played ukulele in a style similar to that of Cliff Edwards in addition to doing comic and dance bits.

After striking out on his own Pepper teamed up with dancer Ginger Rogers as "Ginger and Pepper." Rogers and Pepper were married from 1929 to 1931.  While the marriage was short-lasting, they continued to speak respectfully of each other all their lives.
1929 also marked the first of Pepper's sound film appearances.
By his second wife, Dawn, Pepper was the father of actress Cynthia Pepper.
In 1940 he appeared in the films Rhythm on the River and Road to Singapore. Drafted during World War II, he toured with the USO. 
Pepper continued to appear in films as a character actor into the 1960s.
