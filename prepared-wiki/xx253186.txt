Carl Jacob Arnholm (18 December 1899 – 15 September 1976) was a Norwegian jurist.
He was born in Oslo as a son of civil servant Carsten Johannes Andersen (1865–1950) and Gunvor Henriksen (1866–1940). He finished his secondary education in Kristiania in 1917, and graduated with the cand.jur. degree in 1921. After one year as deputy judge he worked as a junior solicitor from 1923. From 1927 he was entitled to work with Supreme Court cases. In 1930 he was hired as research fellow at the Royal Frederick University, and took the dr.juris degree already in 1931, on the thesis Betingelsene for testamenters gyldighet efter norsk rett. He was then a professor from 1933 to 1968. He served as dean of the Faculty of Law from 1945 to 1951, and in the same period he was deputy chairman of the university collegium (board).[tpl]cite encyclopedia|title=Carl Jacob Arnholm|encyclopedia=Norsk biografisk leksikon|first=Birger Stuevold|last=Lassen|authorlink=Birger Stuevold Lassen|editor=Helle, Knut |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Carl_Jacob_Arnholm/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl]
During the German occupation of Norway Arnholm had been imprisoned. When the Nazi authorities were about to change the rules for admission to the university in autumn 1943, a protest ensued. In retaliation, the authorities arrested 11 staff, 60 male students and 10 female students.[tpl]cite encyclopedia |last=Nøkleby |first=Berit |authorlink=Berit Nøkleby | encyclopedia=Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45 |title=Universitetet |language=Norwegian |editor=Dahl, Hjeltnes, Nøkleby, Ringdal, Sørensen |url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/u/u1.html#universitetet |accessdate=3 January 2010 |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo |isbn= |page= [/tpl] The staff Johannes Andenæs, Eiliv Skard, Johan Christian Schreiner, Harald Krabbe Schjelderup, Anatol Heintz, Odd Hassel, Ragnar Frisch, Bjørn Føyn, Endre Berner and Carl Jacob Arnholm were sent to Grini concentration camp.
