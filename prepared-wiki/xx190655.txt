Leonid Sagalov (born in Kharkiv, 1910 - died in Moscow, 1940) was a Soviet pianist. 
His fine performance in the II Fryderik Chopin Competition, which earned him the 6th prize, paved the way for a concert career abroad, but he shortly afterwards settled back in Kharkiv, where he combined teaching in the city's Conservatory with a concert career along the Ukrainian SSR. Just a year after he was appointed a professor, the Nazi capture of Kharkiv forced him to flee to Moscow, where he died in unknown circumstances.
