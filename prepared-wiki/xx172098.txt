The pneumatic refuse conveying system is a type of waste disposal system that uses air to move refuse through pipes to collection points.
A notable example was implemented in the Stockholm area in Sweden. Refuse is conveyed through steel pipes by a 20â€“25 meter per second air current to accomplish the goal.
A pneumatic refuse collection system on Roosevelt Island, New York City, is said to be the largest in the United States and the only system in the U.S. serving a residential complex in this case nearly 10,000 people.[tpl]cite web|url=http://atlasobscura.com/blog/suck-it-roosevelt-island-s-pneumatic-trash |title=Suck it: Roosevelt Island's Pneumatic Trash |publisher=Atlasobscura.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Taylor |first=Tess |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/11/17/031117ta_talk_taylor |title=Dept. of Sanitation: Whoosh |publisher=The New Yorker |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21[/tpl]
