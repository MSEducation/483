Le Chanteur de Mexico is a French film directed by Richard Pottier  starring Luis Mariano and Bourvil, released in 1957. It was a screen version of Francis Lopez' operetta that premiered at the Théâtre du Châtelet on 15 December 1951.
"Francis Lopez composed for Le Chanteur de Mexico one of his best scores in which the arias integrate well into the atmosphere of the action; the airs were rapidly on everybody's lips: Mexico, Rossignol, Acapulco, Il est un coin de France, Maïtechu, Quant on voit Paris d'en haut, Quant on est deux amis." Académie Nationale de l'Opérette, Le Chanteur de Mexico
The operetta was revived in 2006 at the Théâtre du Châtelet with a cast that included Ismaël Jordi, Rossy de Palma, Jean Benguigui and Clotilde Courau.
