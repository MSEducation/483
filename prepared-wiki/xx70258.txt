The Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) is a membership organization dedicated to fostering the research and dissemination of the history and record of baseball.  Established in Cooperstown, New York, in August 1971 by sportswriter Bob Davids,[tpl]cite web|title=Bob Davids|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|url=http://citrix.drharoldseymour.com/about/bob-davids|accessdate=2011-12-18[/tpl] it is currently based in Phoenix, Arizona.

==Membership==

While the acronym "SABR" may have lent its root to the word sabermetrics (for the use of sophisticated mathematical tools to analyze baseball), the Society is about much more than statistics.  Well known figures in the baseball world such as Bob Costas,  Keith Olbermann, Craig R. Wright, and Rollie Hemond are members right along such highly regarded "sabermetricians" as Bill James and Rob Neyer.  
Among Major League players Jeff Bajenaru was believed to have been (until 2006) the only active  with a SABR membership; Elden Auker, Larry Dierker, and Andy Seminick also have been involved.  
Some prominent SABR members: 

==Activities==

Only a minority of members pursue "number crunching" research.  Rather, the SABR community is organized both by interest and geography: 
SABR members keep in touch through online directories and electronic mailing lists set up through the SABR headquarters. The headquarters also maintains a number of research tools on its website, including a lending library, home run and triple play logs, and course syllabi related to the game.
SABR holds annual conventions in a different city each year.  The conference generally includes panel discussions, research presentations, city-specific tourism, a ballgame, and an awards banquet. The 2007 convention in St. Louis, Missouri set the attendance record with 726 registered attendees out of approximately 7,000 SABR members.http://sabr.org/content/sabr-convention-history The organization also sponsors a baseball analytics conference in Phoenixhttp://sabr.org/analytics and an annual Negro Leagues conference, held in a different location each year.

In 2013, SABR began collaborating with Rawlings on the Gold Glove Award.  Rawlings changed the voting process to incorporate SABR Defensive Index, a sabermetric component provided by SABR, which accounts for approximately 25 percent of the vote for the defensive award.[tpl]cite press release|title=Rawlings Gold Glove Award Finalists Announced|date=October 25, 2013|publisher=Rawlings|url=http://www.rawlings.com/newsdetaillanding.aspx?id=1561|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6MUOQLhRF|archivedate=January 8, 2014|deadurl=no[/tpl]
