The PV for the single was released on Dohhh Up!, a video streaming site, a week prior to the single's release. Due to guidelines drawn up by NHK and the NAB to reduce negative health effects (including photosensitive seizures) from animation and other video, the cut initially shown on the site has been replaced with a re-edited version.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.dohhhup.com/movie/FXPu7gazkrI5XDdBVVnmfLq9bx15kJvK/view.php|title=Dohhh Up! - C\C (Cinderella\Complex) video clip|language=Japanese|publisher=Dohhh Up!|accessdate=2010-05-11[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://nab.or.jp/index.php?%CA%FC%C1%F7%CE%D1%CD%FD%2F%A5%A2%A5%CB%A5%E1%A1%BC%A5%B7%A5%E7%A5%F3%C5%F9%A4%CE%B1%C7%C1%FC%BC%EA%CB%A1%A4%CB%A4%C4%A4%A4%A4%C6|title=アニメーション等の映像手法について|language=Japanese|publisher=NAB (The National Association of Commercial Broadcasters in Japan)|accessdate=2010-05-11[/tpl] The video on the single V is the re-edited cut.
