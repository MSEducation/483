It is based on the New York Times article "Mystery on Fifth Avenue" about the renovation of an 8.5 million dollar co-op, a division of property originally owned by E. F. Hutton and Marjorie Merriweather Post. In 2008, it was widely reported Abrams purchased the rights to the Times article for six figures,[tpl]cite news|last=Seigel|first=Tatiana|title=Paramount, Abrams keep house|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117987620?refCatId=13|publisher=Variety|accessdate=June 17, 2008|date=June 17, 2008[/tpl] and enlisted comedy writers Maya Forbes and Wally Wolodarsky to write the adaptation. 
According to the article, a wealthy couple Steven B. Klinsky and Maureen Sherry purchased the apartment in 2003 and live there with their four children. Soon after purchasing the apartment, they hired young architectural designer Eric Clough, who devised an elaborately clever "scavenger hunt" built into the apartment that involved dozens of historical figures, a fictional book and a soundtrack, woven throughout the apartment in puzzles, riddles, secret panels, compartments, and hidden codes, without the couple's knowledge. The family didn't discover the embedded mystery until months after moving into the apartment.[tpl]cite web|last=Reagan|first=Gillian|title=J.J.
