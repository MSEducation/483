==Reception==

Reviewing The Fountain for the British music magazine Mojo, Johnny Sharp described the album as "mid-tempo, middle of the road, middle-aged pop-rock". Sharp went on to say that the only character was to be found in the "pun-laden lyrics" of "Shroud of Turin". Writing in The Word, Andrew Collins said that despite there being a "languid grace" to whatever the pair do, singer, Ian McCulloch's voice "sounds shot" and Will Sergeant's guitar sounded like a "diluted copy of somebody copying him". Stephen Troussé for Uncut described the album as "dismayingly anonymous". Troussé went on to describe McLaughlin's production as "hyper-compressed, anodyne-sheen".
In The Guardian, Dave Simpson gave the album four stars. He described the album as, "Their most accessible offering in a long time sees Ian McCulloch at his most lyrically ­playful and cocksure, hovering between confessional ... and mischievous, and firing off one-liners as if it were the band's 80s heyday. Will Sergeant's guitar-playing is at its scintillating best ... Their ­poppiest tunes since 'Bring On the ­Dancing Horses' could win the Scouse veterans a new generation of fans." Writing in the music magazine Q, Garry Mulholland described McCulloch and Sergeant's sound as "remarkably perky" and "rejuvenated by an injection of youth from new rhythm section Simon Perry and David Thomas and pop producer John McLaughlin."
The Fountain has reached #63 on the UK Albums Chart."Top 100 Albums Chart::Chart Week Ending Date 24 October 2009". The Official Charts Company. Retrieved on 19 October 2009.
