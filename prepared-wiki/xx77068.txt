In the seventh century, a Chinese pilgrim Xuan Zang visited Laghman, which he called "Lan-p'o" and considered part of India.  He indicated the presence of Mahayana Buddhists and numerous Hindus:
[tpl]quote|"For several centuries the native dynasty had ceased to exist, great families fought for preeminence, and the state had recently become a dependency of Kapis. The country produced upland rice and sugar-cane, and it had much wood but little fruit; the climate was mild with little frost and no snow. ... There were above ten Buddhist monasteries and a few Brethren the most of whom were Mahayanists. The non-Buddhists had a score or two of temples and they were very numerous."[tpl]cite book |url=http://archive.org/stream/cu31924071132769#page/n199/mode/2up |author= Thomas Watters |title= On Yuan Chwang's travels in India, 629-645 A.D |year=1904 |publisher= Royal Asiatic Society [/tpl][/tpl]
By the tenth century, Laghman was still connected to the Greater Indian world. Hudud al-'alam which was finished in 982 AD mentioned the presence of some idol worshipping temples in the area.[tpl]cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TpY3AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA649&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Volume V |contribution=Islam in India and Pakistan |author= Annemarie Schimmel |editors=CE Bosworth, E van Donzel, B Lewis, Ch.

[tpl]quote|"The Amir marched out towards Lamghan, which is a city celebrated for its great strength and abounding in wealth. He conquered it and set fire to the places in its vicinity which were inhabited by infidels, and demolishing the idol-temples, he established Islam in them, He marched and captured other cities and killed the polluted wretches, destroying the idolatrous and gratifying the Musulmans. After wounding and killing beyond all measure, his hands and those of his friends became cold in counting the value of the plundered property. On the completion of his conquest he returned and promulgated accounts of the victories obtained for Islam, and every one, great and small, concurred in rejoicing over this result and thanking God."[tpl]cite book |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924073036729#page/n37/mode/2up |title=The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians.

Sabuktigin then won one of his greatest battles in Laghman against the Hindu Shahis whose ruler, Jayapala, had amassed an army for the battle that numbered 100,000.The History of India: The Hindu and Mahometan Periods, Mountstuart Elphinstone, p. 321. The area later fell to the Ghurids followed by the Khilis and Timurids.
During the early years of the 16th century, the Mughal ruler Babur spent much time in Laghman, and in Baburnama (memoirs of Babur) he expatiated on the beauty of forested hillsides and the fertility of the valley bottoms of the region. Laghman was recognized as a dependent district of Kabulistan in the Mughal era,The Garden of Eight Paradises: Babur and the Culture of Central Asia, Afghanistan and according to Baburnama, "Greater Lamghanat" included the Muslim-settled part of the Kafiristan, including the easterly one of Kunar River. Laghman was the base for expeditions against the non-believers and was frequently mentioned in accounts of jihads led by Mughal emperor Akbar's younger brother, Mohammad Hakim, who was the governor of Kabul. In 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani defeated the Mughals and made the territory part of the Durrani Empire. In the late nineteenth century, Amir Abdur Rahman Khan forced the remaining kafirs (Nuristani people) to accept Islam.
