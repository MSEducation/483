In August 2011, Huang caused a stir in Iceland when he proposed to buy 300 square kilometers, or 116 square mile of the island, encompassing 0.3% of the country, to develop a $200 million property with a "120-room hotel, airport, golf course and horse-riding facilities."http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14714524http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/world/asia/22iht-letter22.html?ref=china  The proposal was met with skepticism in Iceland, a reaction that would be the subject for a "Letter from China" article in the International Herald Tribune.   Columnist Didi Kirsten Tatlow compared the suspicious image cast by Huang as akin to the reputation of Dr. No.http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/world/asia/22iht-letter22.html?ref=china
