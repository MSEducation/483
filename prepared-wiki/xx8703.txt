In December 2012, it was announced that ICE had proposed to buy NYSE Euronext in a stock swap with a valuation of $8 billion. NYSE Euronext shareholders would receive either $33.12 in cash, or $11.27 in cash and approximately a sixth of a share of ICE. The Chairman and CEO of ICE, Jeffrey Sprecher, will retain those positions, but four members of the NYSE Board of Directors will be added to the ICE board.

==Opening and closing bells==

The NYSE's opening and closing bells mark the beginning and the end of each trading day. The 'opening bell' is rung at 9:30 AM EST to mark the start of the day's trading session. At 4 PM EST the 'closing bell' is rung and trading for the day stops. There are bells located in each of the four main sections of the NYSE that all ring at the same time once a button is pressed.[tpl]cite web |title=What is the history behind the opening and closing bells on the NYSE? |url=http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/openingclosingbell.asp | accessdate=August 23, 2013[/tpl] There are three buttons that control the bells, located on the control panel behind the podium which overlooks the trading floor. The main bell, which is rung at the beginning and end of the trading day, is controlled by a green button. The second button, colored orange, activates a single-stroke bell that is used to signal a moment of silence. A third, red button controls a backup bell which is used in case the main bell fails to ring.[tpl]cite web |title=Lessons in Ringing the New York Stock Exchange's Closing Bell |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703572504575214341824379872.html | accessdate=August 24, 2013[/tpl]

===History===

The signal to start and stop trading wasn't always a bell. The original signal was a gavel (which is still in use today along with the bell), but during the late 1800s, the NYSE decided to switch the gavel for a gong to signal the day's beginning and end. After the NYSE changed to its present location at 18 Broad Street in 1903, the gong was switched to the bell format that we see today.
A common sight today is the highly publicized events in which a celebrity or executive from a corporation stands behind the NYSE podium and pushes the button that signals the bells to ring. Many consider the act of ringing the bells to be quite an honor and a symbol of a lifetime of achievement. Furthermore, due to the amount of coverage that the opening/closing bells receive, many companies coordinate new product launches and other marketing-related events to start on the same day as when the company's representatives ring the bell. This daily tradition wasn't always this highly publicized either. In fact, it was only in 1995 that the NYSE began having special guests ring the bells on a regular basis. Prior to that, ringing the bells was usually the responsibility of the exchange's floor managers.

===Notable bell-ringers===

Many of the people who ring the bell are business executives whose companies trade on the exchange. However, there have also been many famous people from outside the world of business that have rung the bell. Athletes such as Joe DiMaggio of the New York Yankees and Olympic swimming champion Michael Phelps, entertainers such as rapper Snoop Dogg and members of the band Kiss, and politicians such as Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani and President of South Africa Nelson Mandela have all had the honor of ringing the bell.
In addition there have been many bell-ringers who are famous for heroic deeds, such as members of the New York police and fire departments following the events of 9/11, members of the United States Armed Forces serving overseas, and participants in various charitable organizations. The reception they receive is often significantly more vocal than that accorded to even the most famous celebrities.[tpl]citation needed|date=November 2013[/tpl]
There have also been several fictional characters that have rung the bell, including Mickey Mouse, the Pink Panther, Mr. Potato Head, the Aflac Duck, and Darth Vader.[tpl]cite web |title=The Tradition Of The NYSE Bell |url=http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0310/the-tradition-of-the-nyse-bell.aspx | accessdate=August 23, 2013[/tpl]
