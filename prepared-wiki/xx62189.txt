CATEGORIES: Chinese dragons

Shenlong, also Shen-lung, ([tpl]zh|t=神龍|s=神龙|p=shén lóng[/tpl], literally "spirit dragon", Japanese: 神竜 Shinryū) is a spiritual dragon from Chinese mythology who is the master of storms and also a bringer of rain. He is of equal significance to other creatures such as Tianlong, the celestial dragon.
The spiritual dragons are azure-scaled and govern the wind, clouds and rain, on which all agricultural life depends.Shuker, Karl. (1995). Dragons. A Natural History.

Despite that, Shenlong appears to signify a special ranking in the splendid robes and regalia of Chinese emperors. He was also five-clawed and therefore an imperial dragon.
