Roy Montgomery is a composer, guitarist and lecturer from Christchurch, New Zealand. Montgomery's mostly instrumental solo works have elements of post-rock, lo-fi, folk and avant-garde experimentation. His signature sound might be described as atmospheric or cinematic, often featuring complex layers of chiming, echoing and/or droning guitar phrases. He is currently head of the Environmental management department at Lincoln University in New Zealand.[tpl]cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/staff-profile?staffid=roy.montgomery |title=Staff Profile: Roy Montgomery |publisher=Lincoln University |date=June 3, 2012 |accessdate=April 27, 2013[/tpl]

==Biography==

Roy Montgomery was born in 1959 in London, England but was brought to Cologne in Germany where he lived until the age of four.[tpl]cite book |first=Mike |last=McGonigal |url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Yeti_Eleven.html?id=a-k_mkEn_GcC |title=Yeti Eleven |publisher=Verse Chorus Press |date=July 26, 2011 |pages=38â€“47 |accessdate=April 27, 2013[/tpl] His father was German and his mother was from the UK. As his mother worked for the British Forces Broadcasting Service, Montgomery was exposed mostly to the pop music of America rather than the music of Germany.[tpl]cite web |first=Mats |last=Gustafsson |url=http://www.dwacres.com/node/1448 |title="Simple Patterns to Useful Effect": The Music of Roy Montgomery |publisher=Deep Water Acres |year=2007 |accessdate=April 27, 2013[/tpl] In mid-sixties he moved with his mother to Christchurch, New Zealand. In 1980, he formed The Pin Group with bass player Ross Humphries and drummer Peter Stapleton. The group debuted with the single Ambivalence in 1981, released though the newly founded label Flying Nun Records. They recorded handful of singles and performed only locally before disbanding in January 1982.[tpl]cite web |first= |last= |url=https://www.flyingnun.co.nz/shop/132 |title=Ambivalence - Pin Group |publisher=Flying Nun Records |year=2013 |accessdate=April 27, 2013[/tpl] Montgomery later worked with Stapleton again in Dadamah, formed in 1990.
Montgomery had been composing and recording acoustic work since 1982, much of which he would integrate into his 90s work. Although enjoying collaborating with other artists, Montgomery is also drawn to working alone, which he attributes to growing up as an only child. In 1995 he issued his debut solo effort Scenes from the South Island, which he recorded and performed by himself.
