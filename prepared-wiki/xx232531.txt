[[Battle Circus (band)]]

CATEGORIES: New Zealand rock music groups

Battle Circus are a progressive rock band from Auckland, New Zealand. The band, formed in 2004, consists of members Marcel Bellve (Vocals, Guitar), Yvonne Wu (Piano, Keyboards), Daniel Bosher (Drums) & Peter Connors (Bass).
The band has notable relations to fellow Auckland, New Zealand band Decortica of which past member Tory Staples is now a member of. Furthermore, Daniel Bosher, a past member of Decortica and brother of their frontman Mathew Bosher, joined Battle Circus in their later years. The two bands have done considerable touring together as a result. Both bands are the most prominent outcome of the area's progressive rock scene
Following the release of a series of singles, the band released their debut EP, The Half-Light Symphony. The release received local acclaim by NZ Musician and a five star review by Real Groove Magazine.
The band was the opener on Amanda Palmer's 2008 tour of the United Kingdom and Europe. Following these dates, the band embarked on their first world tour in the latter half of 2008. Previously, the band was also selected by The Red Paintings for an Australian tour, and earlier in 2007 performed at the main stage at Taiwan's infamous Spring Scream Festival.
On 27 July 2011, shortly after the release of the band's debut album, the band declared on their Facebook page that they had disbanded, though Marcel Bellve would continue to write for a different (currently unknown) project.
