==Political Views==

Munayyer has been a consistent critic of the Israeli occupation of Arab territory and its settlement enterprise within them. Munayyer writes "The greatest obstacle in the way of peace today is an infrastructure of apartheid. American policymakers must make clear to the Israelis that this matrix of settlements, walls and checkpoints must change to make the territory for the Palestinians, and a two-state solution, viable. If it is the objective of U.S. policy to let a two-state solution fail, then little has to change." Op-Ed in San Francisco Chronicle
He has also been a proponent of halting US aid to Israel. He wrote "It is key that both policy-making branches of the US government act together. Both have a variety of tools at their disposal to pressure Israel... an end to unconditional vetoes of UN Security Council resolutions critical of Israel, the conditioning of military aid and loan guarantees, and calling upon Israel to open up its nuclear weapons program for inspection and sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty." Op-Ed in Boston Globe
Munayyer also advocates engaging with all Palestinian parties. He wrote "Rather than seeking to bolster the moderates in this conflict, the Obama administration should focus on moderating the extremists. The idea of eliminating Hamas could not be seriously proposed by anyone with any knowledge of domestic Palestinian politics. The notion that Hamas is a primarily militant organization based in Gaza ignores the movement's vast support in the West Bank and elsewhere." Op-Ed in Washington Post
Munayyer has often expressed political opinions on Twitter, writing for example that “It is important for @EU Commission to realize you must boycott the state, not just the settlements, for real progress,”[tpl]cite web| title =Boycott the state, not just the settlements| work =Al Jazeera| url =http://aje.me/FQnXS2[/tpl] “The BDS beat grows louder as Europe says it will no longer do business with #Israel's settlements,” and “Congress should just create a new designation for #Israel - Major Ass We Kiss - and get it over with already.”
In an op-ed for the San Francisco Gate in July 2008, Munayyer asserted that, in regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, “the greatest obstacle in the way of peace today is an infrastructure of apartheid. American policymakers must make clear to the Israelis that this matrix of settlements, walls and checkpoints must change to make the territory for the Palestinians, and a two-state solution, viable.”[tpl]cite news| last =Munayyer| first =Yousef| title =West Bank wall bigger than Berlins| work =San Francisco Gate| url =http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/West-Bank-wall-bigger-than-Berlin-s-3202770.php| date=July 31, 2008[/tpl]
Noting in an April 2010 Guardian op-ed recent statements by many observers that “'time running out' for a two-state solution,” he observed wryly that “Time has been running out for a two-state solution since the beginning of Israel's colonial enterprise in occupied Palestinian territory in 1967. Yet despite this reality, analyses of the situation continue to repeat this now-meaningless cliche year after year, decade after decade.” He said that there is a “reluctance” in Washington and elsewhere “to draw a line” and to acknowledge that there are three possible “outcomes for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: continued apartheid, ethnic cleansing, or a bi-national state,” the first two being “unconscionable” and the third “not palatable in a staunchly pro-Israel city like Washington.” His conclusion: Palestinians who “live in the apartheid nightmare” must “draw the line,” i.e., “declare a date by which the Israeli occupation had to end and settlements be dismantled,” and if the deadline is not met, start “a broad civil rights movement seeking equal rights in a bi-national state.”[tpl]cite news| last =Munayyer| first =Yousef| title =When will time run out for a two-state solution?| work =The Guardian | date =Apr 27, 2010| url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/apr/27/israel-palestinian-territories| location=London[/tpl]
In a June 2010 op-ed for the Christian Science Monitor, Munayyer accused Israeli forces of committing a “massacre” on the Mavi Marmara, dismissed the Israeli claim that some of the “activists” on the ship had terrorist connections, and held up as definitive the widely discredited Goldstone report.[tpl]cite web| title =Israeli raid on flotilla: an intentional message for Gaza and the rest of the world| work =Christian Science Monitor| url =http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2010/0601/Israeli-raid-on-flotilla-an-intentional-message-for-Gaza-and-the-rest-of-the-world[/tpl]
In a letter to the New York Times published on November 6, 2010, Munayyer criticized former President Bill Clinton for “urging the parties” in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict “to finish Yitzhak Rabin's work,” arguing that “many, like me, whose families were ethnically cleansed from the Palestinian towns of Lydda and Ramla by then Lieutenant Colonel Rabin, know that Israel is today finishing the work Mr. Rabin started in 1948....The fundamental flaw in Mr. Clinton's argument is that simply talking in good faith will lead to a solution. Because of the great power imbalance between Israel and the Palestinians and the failure of American presidents, including Mr. Clinton himself, to press Israel to end its continuing colonization, Israel has been able to easily continue in the spirit of Mr. Rabin's darker, underdiscussed work.[tpl]cite news| last =Munayyer| first =Yousef| title =Recalling Rabin, and a Mideast Quest| work =New York Times| date =Nov 6, 2010| url =http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/06/opinion/l06rabin.html[/tpl]
In a December 2010 op-ed headlined “Let’s Get Tough With Israel,” Munayyer argued that “No legitimate Palestinian leader can negotiate with Israel while it continues to colonize Palestinian land” and that the “Obama administration should not expect the Israelis to do anything without pressure, and this pressure -- economic, diplomatic -- has to be real, tangible and biting.”[tpl]cite news| last =Munayyer| first =Yousef| title =Lets Get Tough With Israel| work =Los Angeles Times| date =Dec 22, 2010[/tpl]
Munayyer told USA Today in May 2011 that “Israel impeded the right of Palestinians to return to stolen homes and land, and likewise is disrupting reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah. But unity advances Palestinian self-determination since Palestinians cannot negotiate, let alone secure independence, divided....Recognition from the U.N. General Assembly will not end the occupation but it will further isolate Israel in a world that has grown tired of its inhumane treatment of Palestinians. If American officials want to lure the Palestinians from this strategy, they must give them reason to believe an American-led process can work. Consistent American support for Israel ... has justifiably convinced them otherwise.”[tpl]cite news| title =Palestinian quest is no stunt| work =USA Today| date =May 18, 2011| url =http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2011-05-17-Palestinian-quest-for-statehood-is-no-stunt_n.htm[/tpl]
In a May 2011 article for Foreign Policy, Munayyer recounted what he described as the “long, rich history of nonviolent Palestinian resistance,” which he contrasted with Israeli violence. “If ever there were a moment for Palestinians to overwhelmingly embrace nonviolence,” he added, “that moment is now.” But the US and other Western countries, he concluded, need to condemn Israeli repression and to  honor Palestinian peacefulness: “The fact that the nonviolent protest of the Arab Spring has come to Palestine is not a threat. It's a historic opportunity for the West to finally get it right.[tpl]cite web| last =Munayyer| first =Yousef| title =Palestines Hidden History of Non-Violence| work =ForeignPolicy.com| date =May 18, 2011| url =http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/05/18/palestines_hidden_history_of_nonviolence?page=0,0&wp_login_redirect=0[/tpl] 
After a May 2011 speech by President Obama about the Middle East, Munayyer said it would “fall on deaf ears where it matters most: the Arab world,” because Obama had “shifted blame toward Palestinians while offering no criticism of continued Israeli colonization of Palestinian territory.”[tpl]cite news| last =Hall| first =Mimi; & Richard Wolf| title =Obama urges renewal of Mideast talks; Endorsement of 1967 borders brings criticism| work =USA Today| date =May 20, 2011| url =http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-05-19-obama-middle-east-speech_n.htm[/tpl]
Munayyer wrote to the New York Times in June 2011 protesting an article's characterization of events in Israel in 1948, insisting that “many Palestinians had been expelled or had fled before” May 15, 1948.[tpl]cite news| title =Where Words Can Never Do Justice| work =New York Times| url =http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/opinion/12pubed.html | first=Arthur S.| last=Brisbane| date=June 11, 2011[/tpl]
Munayyer wrote in a September 2011 op-ed that “the U.S. has consistently acted against its own interests to serve the interest of a right-wing Israeli government. The Palestinians' aspirations have exposed this rather embarrassing American behavior internationally. This has been a way for Palestinians to say to the world: 'You see, this is what we have to deal with when we participate in U.S.-led negotiations.'” He spoke of Israel as “Israel Island,” which he described as “a mentality...that has preferred isolation over cooperation, stubbornness and recalcitrance over genuine concessions and abiding by law, vetoes over pressuring Israel.”[tpl]cite news| last =Munayyer| first =Yousef| title =All alone on Israel Island| work =Chicago Tribune| date =Sep 21, 2011| url =http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-09-21/opinion/ct-perspec-0921-israel-20110921_1_palestinian-state-israeli-violations-israeli-settlers[/tpl]
“Despite the lofty rhetoric Obama put forward about freedom and the stance of the United States towards the Arab uprisings,” Munayyer said in September 2011 in reaction to a speech by the U.S. president, “he offered nothing new for Palestinians who continue to languish under a 43-plus year Israeli military occupation.”[tpl]cite news| title =Obama casts chill on Palestinian hopes; Daunting domestic politics rule the day| work =The Toronto Star| date =Sep 22, 2011[/tpl]
Munayyer was criticized for a May 2012 New York Times op-ed in which he complained that because he is an Israeli citizen, he may fly into Ben-Gurion Airport when visiting Israel, but his wife, who has a Palestinian ID, must fly to Amman, Jordan, resulting in “a logistical nightmare that reminds us of our profound inequality before the law at every turn.” Even when both of them fly to Amman, “we are forced to take different bridges, two hours apart, and endure often humiliating waiting and questioning just to cross into Israel and the West Bank.” Recounting the history of Israel and the Palestinians, he lamented that “a Jew from any country can move to Israel, while a Palestinian refugee, with a valid claim to property in Israel, cannot.” He described this as a “nondemocratic reality” and suggested that “a two-state solution...seems fanciful at this point.”[tpl]cite news| last =Munayyer| first =Yousef| title =Not All Israeli Citizens Are Equal| work =New York Times | date =May 24, 2012| url =http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/24/opinion/not-all-israeli-citizens-are-equal.html[/tpl] In a letter to the Times, the Anti-Defamation League described Munayyer's op-ed as a “convoluted” piece of writing that “misrepresents the societal status of Israeli-Arab citizens, distorts the history of Israel’s 1948 War of Independence, and fails to contextualize the unfortunate hardships facing Palestinians within the framework of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”[tpl]cite web| title =ADL Letter to New York Times.com| work =ADL| url =http://archive.adl.org/media_watch/internet/20120525-NY+Times.com.htm  [/tpl]
In a Chicago Tribune op-ed that appeared in the wake of “continued Islamophobia” in August 2012, Munayyer accused U.S. government officials of “peddling Islamophobia” because “Muslim Americans, a fairly new immigrant group still small in number and not yet cohesively organized, are easy targets” and “for a government that needs to demonstrate its ability to secure the homeland, the targeting of Muslim Americans is a low-risk, high-reward option.”[tpl]cite news| last =Munayyer| first =Yousef| title =Muslims suffer for illusion of security| work =Chicago Tribune | date =Aug 17, 2012| url =http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-16/opinion/ct-perspec-0817-islamphobia-20120816_1_terror-incidents-muslim-americans-islamophobic[/tpl]
Munayyer condemned an illustration  depicting “Muslim Rage” that appeared on the cover of Newsweek in September 2012, saying that it was “shocking” and would “only feed...this 'clash of civilizations' mentality.”[tpl]cite news| last =Adams| first =Guy| title =Newsweek cover accused of mocking Muslims| work =The Independent | date =Sep 19, 2012| url =http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/newsweek-cover-accused-of-mocking-muslims-8153550.html| location=London[/tpl]
New York Times columnist Roger Cohen cited Munayyer in March 2013 as an example of a Palestinian supporter of a two-state solution, who, he said, “have become harder to find.” Cohen quoted Munayyer as saying that “Israel is not interested in permitting” and that Palestinians, having lost faith in U.S. mediation, would probably “re-strategize away from a state-based separatist struggle toward a rights-based struggle (already happening)” as “Israeli colonization” had “destroyed the territorial integrity of a would-be state.”[tpl]cite news| last =Cohen| first =Roger| title =Zero Dark Zero| work =New York Times| date =Feb 28, 2013| url =http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/opinion/global/zero-dark-zero.html[/tpl]

In July 2013, Munayyer praised the EU's decision to try to “change Israel’s colonial behaviour” by prohibiting “funding, cooperation, awarding of scholarships, research funds or prizes to anyone residing in the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.” He characterized the EU move as “a slap in the face” to both Israel and the US and a statement that “we will not sit idly by as Palestine is gobbled up by Israel.”[tpl]cite web| last =Munayyer| first =Yousef| title =Europe emerges from the peace process dark age| work =Jerusalem Fund | date =Jul 17, 2013| url =http://www.thejerusalemfund.org/ht/display/ContentDetails/i/41144 [/tpl]
