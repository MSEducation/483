Brazilians in Suriname form a large community consisting mostly of miners. The number of Brazilians in the country is estimated at 40,000, nearly 10 percent of the population."Guyana: Caught in Brazil's Net?; Small Nation, New to Free Markets, Fears Loss of Its Identity", The New York Times, 30 March 2000. Suriname allegedly has the largest community of Brazilians in any CARICOM nation."Suriname- South American Neighbours Sign Cooperation Agreements", Caribarena Dominica, 13 September 2009.

==Settlement==

Suriname's low population density and abundant natural resources have attracted numerous migrants from neighboring Brazil."Ethnic Rioting in Suriname", Geo Currents, 30 December 2009. Over the past decade or so, as many as 40,000 Brazilians, mostly illegal immigrants, have moved to Suriname, a country with fewer than half a million citizens. Many if not most Brazilians in Suriname work as small-scale gold miners in the town of Albina which has became primarily a base for nomadic gold prospectors.[tpl]cite web |last1=Elizondo |first1=Gabriel |title =Christmas violence in Suriname | url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/americas/2009/12/27/christmas-violence-suriname | accessdate =December 27, 2009 | date =December 27, 2009 | publisher=Al Jazeera[/tpl]

==Violence against Brazilians==

Gold mining in Albina is typically environmentally destructive and it often results in clashes between the miners and indigenous peoples. 
In late December 2009, a series of riots occurred when local maroon inhabitants attacked Brazilian, Chinese, Colombian and Peruvian gold diggers after a man was allegedly stabbed to death by a Brazilian.
