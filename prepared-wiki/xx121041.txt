Mark Robertson (born 6 April 1977 in Sydney) is a former footballer.

==Club career==

He had previously played for the Australian A-League club Perth Glory before being released at the end of the season by coach Ron Smith. He was a member of the Wollongong Wolves team which famously fought back from a 3â€“0 half time deficit to beat Perth Glory in the 2000 National Soccer League grand final.
Perth Glory is Mark's ninth club after returning from the United Kingdom where he turned out for Stockport County, St Johnstone, Dundee, Swindon Town and Burnley. Mark has  previously played in Australia with Eastern Suburbs, Marconi and Wollongong Wolves in the NSL and has represented Australia at under 20, under 23's and at full international level in 2001.
Mark's contract with Perth Glory was not renewed after the 2006/2007 A-League season, and he moved to Hungary with FC Sopron. He however announced that he would like to rejoin his former club at Perth due to family reasons.
In December 2007, Robertson signed with Sydney FC as cover for Adam Casey, out with a long-term injury.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.sydneyfc.com/default.aspx?s=sydfc_news_item&id=20687 |title=Sydney FC signs midfielder Mark Robertson |publisher=sydneyfc.com |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2007-12-13 [/tpl]
