===World War II===

Following the Allied Normandy Landings, the headquarters of Panzer Group West was established in the Chateau at La Caine.  The headquarters' new location was revealed to the British intelligence by Ultra's deciphering of German signals traffic.  On 10 June 1944, aircraft of the RAF's Second Tactical Air Force bombed the village killing the German chief of staff and many other personnel.  German communications equipment and vehicles were also destroyed.http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/AAF-H-DDay/
