==Biography==

===Early life===

Morris was born September 18, 1955 and grew up in Hermosa Beach, California.[tpl]sfn|Chick|2009|p=10[/tpl] His father, Jerry, had been a budding jazz drummer in his youth and practiced with visiting jazz groups at the Lighthouse Café, later opening a bait shop in the 1970s and striking up a friendship with Ozzie Cadena (both men's sons, Keith and Dez, later became singers in Black Flag).[tpl]sfn|Chick|2009|pp=9–10[/tpl] Keith attended Mira Costa High School, where brothers Greg and Raymond Ginn were also students, and graduated in 1973.[tpl]sfn|Chick|2009|p=10[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Chick|2009|pp=14—15[/tpl] He then studied fine art and painting at the Pasadena Arts Center while working at his father's bait shop.[tpl]sfn|Chick|2009|p=11[/tpl] One of his co-workers at the shop was Bill Stevenson, a Mira Costa student eight years Morris' junior who would also go on to be a member of Black Flag.[tpl]sfn|Chick|2009|p=13[/tpl]
Morris and his friends spent their spare time hanging out by the Strand under Hermosa Beach pier, where they experimented with drugs: "I'd get off work, and we'd get up to trouble," he later recalled, "smoking angel dust, snorting elephant tranquilizers. Just real goofy, 'why-would-you-want-to-do-that?' kinda stuff, the kind of thing you get up to when you're young, and into experimenting. If it was a good experience, then cool; if not, well, then it was just a real hard lesson learned."[tpl]sfn|Chick|2009|p=12[/tpl] His early musical tastes included various rock acts such as Bob Seger, Foreigner, Montrose, Styx, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Queen, Ten Years After, Status Quo, Uriah Heep, UFO, the Scorpions, Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, and the MC5, "any kind of fist-pumping, 'flick-your-bic' rock. I was into anything that was loud".[tpl]sfn|Chick|2009|pp=12—13[/tpl] He became a freely opinionated and passionate fan of heavy rock and protopunk, and took a job working at local record store Rubicon Records.[tpl]sfn|Chick|2009|p=14[/tpl]

===Black Flag===

In 1976, Morris co-founded Black Flag (then-known as Panic) along with guitarist Greg Ginn. Their work ethic proved too challenging for some early members; Ginn and  Morris had an especially hard time finding a reliable bass guitarist, and often rehearsed without a bassist, a factor that contributed to the development of Ginn's distinctive, often low-pitched guitar sound. Ginn's brother Raymond Pettibon and SST house record producer-to-be Spot filled in sometimes at rehearsals.
After a number of line-up changes, Morris recorded vocals for the first Black Flag EP Nervous Breakdown. He left the band in 1979, citing, among other reasons, creative differences with Ginn, and his own "freaking out on cocaine and speed."

===Circle Jerks===

After leaving Black Flag in 1979, Morris founded the Circle Jerks, along with former Redd Kross guitarist Greg Hetson. Cited as one of the most important hardcore punk groups, the Circle Jerks were active until 1990, when Hetson left the band to continue playing guitar and release a number of albums with Bad Religion. However, the Circle Jerks reunited in 1994, released their last studio album to date in 1995, and performed on and off until 2010, when they entered another hiatus.

===Off!===

As of 2010, Morris has been performing and touring with his latest project Off!, which he founded with Dimitri Coats from Burning Brides, Steven Shane McDonald from Redd Kross, and Mario Rubalcaba from Earthless/Rocket From The Crypt/Hot Snakes. Morris stated in a March 2011 interview that Off! was asked to open future dates for the Red Hot Chili Peppers and they said they would even though it might anger some of their younger punk fans.[tpl]cite web|url=http://mercercluster.com/?p=3106 |title=Getting "OFF!" with Keith Morris | The Cluster |publisher=Mercercluster.com |date=2013-06-16 |accessdate=2013-08-01[/tpl] Morris has known the band for over 30 years and Chili Peppers singer, Anthony Kiedis, wore an Off! hat at every show on the band's entire I'm with You World Tour including some of their music videos.http://www.bigdayout.com/2012/off/ [tpl]dead link|date=October 2013[/tpl]

===FLAG===

In 2013, Keith Morris, Chuck Dukowski, Dez Cadena, Bill Stevenson and Descendents member Stephen Egerton, created FLAG as an offshoot of Black Flag. As of now, they are only touring. No plans of an album have been announced.[tpl]cite web|author=By Greg Prato |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/black-flag-reunites-for-album-live-dates-20130128 |title=Black Flag Reunite for Album, Live Dates | Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2013-01-28 |accessdate=2013-08-01[/tpl]

===Other works===

Morris filled in for Red Hot Chili Peppers singer, Anthony Kiedis during one of the band's shows in the mid-80s. When Kiedis, who was off scoring drugs, failed to show up for the performance, the band asked Morris to fill in on vocals. Morris, who didn't know any of the lyrics, yelled and made up lyrics to the band's songs to get through the performance.[tpl]sfn|Sloman|Kiedis|2004|p=191[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Sloman|Kiedis|2004|pp=219–225[/tpl]
