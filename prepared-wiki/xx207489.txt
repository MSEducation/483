The 2008 Ahmedabad bombings were a series of 21 bomb blasts that hit Ahmedabad, India, on 26 July 2008, within a span of 70 minutes. 56 people were killed and over 200 people were injured. Ahmedabad is the cultural and commercial heart of Gujarat state, and a large part of western India. The blasts were considered to be of low intensity, and were similar to the Bangalore blasts, Karnataka which occurred the day before.
Several TV channels said they had received an e-mail from a terror outfit called Indian Mujahideen claiming responsibility for the terror attacks;[tpl]cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =16 blasts in Ahmedabad; 49 dead, 145 injured| work =India Today Group| publisher =Living Media| date =27 July 2008| url =http://www.itgo.in/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&issueid=&id=7098&sectionid=9&secid=0&Itemid=1| format =| doi =| accessdate =2008-07-27 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080803160936/http://www.itgo.in/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&issueid=&id=7098&sectionid=9&secid=0&Itemid=1| archivedate= 3 August 2008 | deadurl= no[/tpl][tpl]cite web| last =Das| first =Rathin| authorlink =|author2=A.

The e-mail also contained threats against the current Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Vilasrao Deshmukh, and his deputy, R.R. Patil, with the claim, “We wonder at your memory. Have you forgotten the evening of 11 July 2006 so quickly and so easily?”
Furthermore, the threats went on to warn Indian businessman Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries to “think-twice” before “usurping and building a citadel on a land in Mumbai that belongs to the Waqf board...lest it turns into horrifying memories for you which you will never ever forget.”
The e-mail also reportedly threatened several Bollywood actors, asking them to stop acting.
Police reported that they questioned U.S national Ken Haywood from whose IP address the threatening email was sent.

===Legal case===

Controversy arose in the court case of the 26 accused as the state was alleged to have suppressed the legal rights of the accused. On 23 October  lawyers of the accused walked out in protest against the stand taken by the Metropolitan Magistrate. The lawyers wanted to meet the accused alone, however, they had moved an application stating that police did not allow them to meet their clients alone and that the Court should direct the police not to remain present while they were talking to the accused. The Metropolitan Magistrate countered that it was not possible as police had to be with the accused. He is said to have hinted at collusion between the lawyers and the accused, causing a walk out by the accused's lawyers.http://www.gujaratglobal.com/nextSub.php?id=4416&catype=NEWS  [tpl]Wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.gujaratglobal.com/nextSub.php?id=4416&catype=NEWS|date =20110711133537[/tpl] The next day, in two different cases, the designated Metropolitan Court remanded all the 26 accused to police custody till 31 October.Court extends custody of 26 blast accused till Oct 31 – Indian Express

In criticizing the central government Ajai Sahni, executive director of the Institute for Conflict Management said "India's police to population ratio is one of the lowest in the world, barring the poorer African countries. There is a high deficit of personnel in intelligence gathering. The IB has barely 3,500 field officers. We need to address these shortcomings."
Security expert Prakash Singh added "they (terrorists) have no fear of being detected, arrested or prosecuted."
