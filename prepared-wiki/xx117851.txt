[[Obolellida]]

CATEGORIES: Brachiopods, Cambrian animals

Obolellida is a small, extinct order of inarticulate brachiopods that existed from the early to middle Cambrian period.  The relationship of the Obolellida with other inarticulates is unclear, and were previously grouped together with the Siphonotretacea, before being given their own order.

==Anatomy==

The shell is typically impunctate, biconvex, and oval or subcircular in shape.  They are like other inarticuates in that, as with the lingulids, the shell has no hinge, at least in the earliest examples.Paleos, Order Obolellida. (URL accessed July 4, 2006).  It is thought they may have used a hydraulic mechanism.  However they later seem to develop a primitive articulation, in which some used a levator mechanism for opening the shell.Lipps, Jere H; Signor, Philip W (January 1, 1992).

The pedicle opening can be positioned at various positions.McGraw-Hill AccessScience, Obolellida. (URL accessed July 4, 2006).
