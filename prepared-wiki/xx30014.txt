SustainabiliTank. 13 Oct. 2009. An international jury, invited by the five regular Right Livelihood Award board members, decides the awards in such fields as environmental protection, human rights, sustainable development, health, education, and peace. The prize money is shared among the winners, usually numbering four, and is EUR 200,000.About the Right Livelihood Award. Accessed October 26, 2010.

It is not a Nobel prize (i.e., a prize created by Alfred Nobel). It does not have any organizational ties to the awarding institutions of the Nobel Prize or the Nobel Foundation.
It is often popularly associated with the Nobel prizes, being awarded in the Riksdag of Sweden the day before the Nobel prizes and the economics prize are also awarded in Stockholm, and being understood as a critique of the traditional Nobel prizes. The establishment of the award followed a failed attempt to have the Nobel Foundation create new prizes in the areas of environmental protection, sustainable development and human rights. The prize has been awarded to a diverse group of people and organisations, including Wangari Maathai, Astrid Lindgren, Bianca Jagger, Mordechai Vanunu, Leopold Kohr, Arna Mer-Khamis, Petra Kelly, Survival International, Amy Goodman and Memorial.

==Ceremony==

Since 1985, the ceremony has taken place in the Stockholm's old Parliament building, in the days before the traditional Nobel prizes are awarded in the same city. A group of Swedish Parliamentarians from different parties host the ceremony, in 2009 European Commissioner Margot Wallström co-hosted the ceremony.

==Nature of the award==

Some media refer to the prize as the Alternative Nobel Prize,.[tpl]cite book|last1=Thorpe|first1=Edgar|last2=Thorpe|first2=Showick|title=Guide to the Combined Defence Services Exam|publisher=Pearson Education|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-317-0074-7|page=26|chapter=General Awareness: Right Livelihood Award[/tpl] The prize is frequently understood as a critique of the traditional Nobel prizes.
The prize differs significantly from the Nobel Prizes:

==History==

Jakob von Uexküll sold his valuable stamp collection to create a prize. He made one million US-dollars which provided the initial funding of the award. Before establishing the award in 1980, von Uexkull had tried to interest the Nobel Foundation in a new prize to be awarded together with the Nobel Prizes. He suggested the establishment of two new prizes, one for ecology and one for development.[tpl]cite web|url=http://rightlivelihood.org/history.html |title=Right Livelihood Award: History - Setting up the 'Alternative Nobel Prize' |publisher=Rightlivelihood.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28[/tpl] Like the Economics Prize, this would have been possible by an amendment to the Nobel Foundation statutes and funding of the prize amount completely separate from Nobel's fortune. The Nobel Prize amount was 880,000 Swedish kronor at that time,[tpl]cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/amounts.html |title=The Nobel Prize Amounts |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-28[/tpl] which corresponded to 195,000 US dollars.according to historical exchange rate from However, as a result of the debate that followed the establishment of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (first awarded in 1969), the Nobel Foundation had decided not to associate the Nobel Prize with any additional awards, so von Uexküll's proposal was rejected.TT-DN (2003-10-02).

The award states that, in the 21st century, the "greatest benefit to mankind" may be found in different fields than in the traditional sciences or in strict categories: the vast majority of award winners work for grassroots non-governmental organisations in their countries. The foundation understands its awards as a complement to the Nobel Prizes.[ref]
