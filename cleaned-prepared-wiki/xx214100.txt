Composition

"Whatever You Like" was written by T.I., James Scheffer and David Siegel. The song was produced by Jim Jonsin, who produced Lil Wayne's single, "Lollipop". The production team worked on the track when T.I. was in the studio recording his album. The instrumentals for "Whatever You Like" are based on a beat of lead synthesizers and drum pattern. The song runs for 4:09 and speaks about a man who can buy a woman whatever she asks for, as well encourages the woman to ask for anything she wants. It is a slow R&B/Pop song and the chorus contains breathy soft, singing vocals. The song also contains a sample from "Redemption", the opening and closing theme song from the film Rocky II. "Whatever You Like" is set in common time with a moderately slow tempo of 80 beats per minute, and is written in the key of D minor with a chord progression sequence of Dm-Bb-F-C.
A second version of "Whatever You Like" was released in order to be suitable for radio stations. The original version of the track features T.I. saying "Late night sex so wet, it's so tight", while the radio version replaces these lyrics with the line "Baby I can treat you so special, so nice" in the hook and replacing the line "Thing gets so wet/ it hits so right" with "Girl, you smell so fresh, and look so nice" in the breakdown. The music video also uses the edited lyrics. Other changes include replacing the line "Tell 'em other broke niggas be quiet" with "Tell 'em other broke brothers be quiet" or "Tell 'em other broke jokers be quiet" in the pre-hook. The 2nd verse also mutes the word "brain" in the line "Brain so good/ could've sworn you went to college" due to a slang definition of the word referring to oral sex.

Critical reception

Reviews for "Whatever You Like" were generally favorable. Jared W. Dillon of Sputnikmusic called the song a "more sophisticated take" on Lil Wayne's "Lollipop".
