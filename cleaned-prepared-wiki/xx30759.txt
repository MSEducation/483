History

This area was inhabited for thousands of years by varying cultures of indigenous peoples. The historic Cherokee and Choctaw lived here at the time of European encounter. The Cherokee who remained in the county after Indian Removal in the 1830s have worked at reviving their culture in the last thirty years. The Echota Cherokee are a recognized tribe.
Cullman County was established by German American immigrants from Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1877. They founded an agricultural community and sought to create an agricultural revolution in what had been a frontier area, in the best traditions of innovation in the New South. However, hard geographical and social realities clashed with the often impractical vision of colonizer John G. Cullmann. His Germans, with their traditional work ethic and willingness to experiment with such new products as wine and strawberries, did try to make practical changes in southern farming. The Germans were however outnumbered by more traditional families from neighboring regions, who replicated the traditional southern cotton culture.
