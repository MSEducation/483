NBA career

Vancouver Grizzlies (1998–2001)

In his first season with the Grizzlies, Bibby averaged 13.2 points, 6.5 assists and 2.7 rebounds per game earning NBA All-Rookie honors during the  season which was abbreviated by a labor dispute. He improved those numbers in his next two seasons with the team, averaging 14.5 and 15.9 points per game,

Sacramento Kings (2001–2008)

In his first season with Sacramento, Bibby formed one of the league's best duos alongside Chris Webber. The two of them guided the Kings to a NBA best-record at 61–21, and a Pacific division title over the Los Angeles Lakers, who at the time were the two-time defending NBA Champions. In the first two rounds of the playoffs, they easily defeated the Dallas Mavericks and Utah Jazz, setting up a Western Conference Finals match-up against Lakers. The 2002 Western Conference Final between the Sacramento Kings and Los Angeles Lakers was one of the most memorable in league history. The popular (though small-market) Kings led the two-time defending NBA champion Lakers three games to two heading into Game 6 at Staples Center, a game which would prove to be the most infamous of the series. The game, which the Lakers won by four, featured several disputable calls, including a late-game no-call foul on Bibby—after he was bleeding from being elbowed in the nose by Kobe Bryant. This game was the epitome of the major issue in the series. Both teams complained about the officiating at different points in the series (the Kings in Game 6 and the Lakers in Games 2 and 5).
Former NBA referee Tim Donaghy filed in court papers in 2008 said that Game 6 was fixed by the NBA. NBA Commissioner David Stern denied Donaghy's allegations. Lawrence Pedowitz, who led a review of the league's officiating following the outbreak of the scandal, concluded that while Game 6 was poorly officiated, no concrete evidence existed of it having been fixed.espn.go.
Bibby's performance during the series, perhaps most memorably his Game 5 game winner,
During the 2002–03 season, Bibby was hampered by injuries, playing in only 55 games, but still averaged a respectable 15.9 points per game with the Kings going 59–23 and securing second seed in the West, as well as a second-consecutive division title. They faced the Utah Jazz and Dallas Mavericks in the first two rounds respectively for the second consecutive playoffs, but after defeating the Jazz soundly 4–1, lost to the Mavericks in seven games. The Kings had lost Chris Webber to season-ending injury in game 2 against Dallas, but still forced the series to seven games.
For the 2003–04 season, Bibby posted some of the best numbers of his career, scoring 1,506 points (18.4 per game) and helping the Kings reach the playoffs. They would go on to lose in the second round for the second consecutive year, this time to the Minnesota Timberwolves 4–3.
The next two seasons would see Sacramento taking yet another step backwards, losing in the opening round of the playoffs in both years. During the 2005–06 season, Bibby started all 82 games, and averaged a career-high 21.1 points per game. They would lose in the first round of the playoffs to the defending-champion Spurs 4–2, in what remains Sacramento's most recent playoff appearance.

Atlanta Hawks (2008–2011)

On February 16, 2008 the Atlanta Hawks acquired Bibby in exchange for Shelden Williams, Anthony Johnson, Tyronn Lue, Lorenzen Wright and a 2008 second-round draft pick.ESPN – King-size surprise: Hawks, not LeBron's Cavs, get Bibby – NBA
Even though he battled through thumb, heel and quad injuries, and was joining a Hawks team that was 22–28, Bibby put up 14.1 points and 6.6 assists per game while working in an unfamiliar offense to lead the Hawks to their first playoff berth in almost ten years. Despite being the eighth seed and expected to be swept out of the first round, Bibby helped the Hawks force an improbable seven-game series against Boston, who went on to win the NBA Championship.
The next season, Bibby averaged 15 points, 5 assists and over one steal per game to help the Hawks win their first playoff series since 1999 against the Milwaukee Bucks. The Hawks would go on to lose in the next round against the eventual Eastern Conference Champion Orlando Magic.  Bibby was also selected as a participant for the Three Point Shooting Competition. On July 7, 2009, Bibby and the Hawks agreed to a three-year deal worth about $18 million.

Washington Wizards (2011)

On February 23, 2011, Atlanta traded Bibby to the Washington Wizards, along with Jordan Crawford, Maurice Evans and a first round pick in the 2011 draft, in exchange for Kirk Hinrich and Hilton Armstrong.

Miami Heat (2011)

On March 2, 2011, the Miami Heat signed Bibby after he cleared waivers. He appeared in the first NBA Finals appearance of his career, playing against the Dallas Mavericks, who defeated the Heat 4 games to 2 to capture their first NBA title.

New York Knicks (2011–2012)

On December 11, 2011, Bibby signed a one-year contract with the New York Knicks, the team that drafted his father, Henry. At season's end his contract expired, and he was deemed unlikely to return to the team.Source: Bibby unlikely to return to Knicks - Knicks Blog - ESPN New York
