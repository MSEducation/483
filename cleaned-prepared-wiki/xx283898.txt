History

Khoday India Limited (KIL) began producing Peter Scot whisky in May 1968,
In its judgment, the Supreme Court considered the tests applied by courts in England, Australia and the United States regarding the deceptive similarity of goods. The Court also referred to a passage in Kerly's Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names and ruled that, "the goods are expensive and not of a kind usually selected without deliberation and the customers are generally educated persons which are all matters to be considered". It also held that "where the class of buyers is educated and rich, the test to be applied is different where the product would be purchased by the villagers, the illiterate and the poor". The Court reached the conclusion that the trademark concerned a class of buyers who were expected to know the value of money, the quality and content of Scotch whisky and the difference in the process of manufacture, the place of manufacture and their origin. The judgement also stated that "the Trademark Registrar as well as the high court failed to apply the consumer's knowledge test to the issue and hence arrived at a wrong conclusion".
