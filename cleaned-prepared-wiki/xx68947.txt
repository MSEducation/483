[[Mustafa Hamsho]]

Mustafa Hamsho ( and former world middleweight champion Alan Minter in 1981 to get a shot at then-champion Marvelous Marvin Hagler in October of that year, but showed no respect for the champion during their matchup - or at least for the time it lasted.  Hagler methodically used left jabs and right crosses to bust up Hamsho's face (which needed 55 stitches) until the fight was stopped on cuts in the 11th.  
Hamsho continued to fight, defeating Curtis Parker, future world champion Bobby Czyz, and former three-division world champion Wilfred Benítez during 1982 and 1983, then received a return visit to take on Hagler in a rematch in October 1984 in NYC's Madison Square Garden.  After Hamsho tried to play rough in the early going, Hagler ended things early this time by flooring Hamsho twice in the third round (the second knockdown produced by a Floyd Patterson-like hook), thus forcing Hamsho's trainer to jump in and stop the fight.  Hamsho would continue to fight, with the biggest name on his list being Donny Lalonde, who decisioned Hamsho in the spring of 1987 and would then go on to become light heavyweight champion later that year.  Hamsho's career would then peter out over the next few years.
