Ports and shipping

There are many major ports in India. Maritime transportation in India is managed by the Shipping Corporation of India, a government-owned company that also manages offshore and other marine transport infrastructure in the country. It owns and operates about 35% of Indian tonnage and operates in practically all areas of shipping business servicing both national and international trades.
It has a fleet of 79 ships of 2750,000 GT (4.8Â million DWT) and also manages 53 research, survey and support vessels of 120,000 GT (060,000 DWT) on behalf of various government departments and other organisations. Personnel are trained at the Maritime Training Institute in Mumbai, a branch of the World Maritime University, which was set up in 1987. The Corporation also operates in Malta and Iran through joint ventures.
The ports are the main centres of trade. In India about 95% of the foreign trade by quantity and 70% by value takes place through the ports. Other than these, there are 187 minor and intermediate ports, 43 of which handle cargo.
The distinction between major and minor ports is not based on the amount of cargo handled. The major ports are managed by port trusts which are regulated by the central government. The total amount of traffic handled at the major ports in 2005-2006 was 382.33 Mt.
