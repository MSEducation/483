[[DEFCON]]

CATEGORIES: Alert measurement systems, Military of the United States, Color codes

The defense readiness condition (DEFCON) is an alert state used by the United States Armed Forces.   It prescribes five graduated levels of readiness (or states of alert) for the U.S. military, and increase in severity from DEFCON 5 (least severe) to DEFCON 1 (most severe) to match varying military situations.
DEFCONs are a subsystem of a series of Alert Conditions, or  LERTCONs, that also includes Emergency Conditions (EMERGCONs). DEFCONs should not be confused with similar systems used by the U.S. military, such as Force Protection Conditions (FPCONS), Readiness Conditions (REDCONS), Information Operations Condition (INFOCON) and its future replacement Cyber Operations Condition (CYBERCON),Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 6510.01F and Watch Conditions (WATCHCONS), or the former Homeland Security Advisory System used by the United States Department of Homeland Security.

Levels

DEFCONs vary between many commands and have changed over time,  and the United States Department of Defense uses exercise terms when referring to the DEFCONs.
Movies and popular culture often misuse the DEFCON system by "going to DEFCON 5" when a nuclear war is imminent. The highest state, DEFCON 1, has never been called for.

History

After NORAD was created, the command used different readiness levels (Normal, Increased, Maximum) subdivided into eight conditions, e.g., the "Maximum Readiness" level had two conditions "Air Defense Readiness" and "Air Defense Emergency".

DEFCON 2

=Cuban Missile Crisis=

The highest confirmed DEFCON ever was Level 2. During the Cuban Missile Crisis on October 22, 1962, the U.S. Armed Forces were ordered to DEFCON 3. On October 26, Strategic Air Command (SAC) was ordered to DEFCON 2, while the rest of the U.S. Armed Forces remained at DEFCON 3. SAC remained at DEFCON 2 until November 15.DEFCON DEFense CONdition - United States Nuclear Forces

DEFCON 3

=Yom Kippur War=

On October 6, 1973, Egypt and Syria launched a joint surprise attack on Israel resulting in the Yom Kippur War. The U.S. became concerned that the Soviet Union might intervene and on October 25, U.S. forces including Strategic Air Command, Continental Air Defense Command, European Command and the Sixth Fleet were placed on DEFCON 3. Over the following days, the various forces reverted to normal status with the Sixth Fleet standing down on November 17.

=September 11 attacks=

The third time the United States reached DEFCON 3 was during the September 11 attacks of 2001. U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld ordered the increased DEFCON level, and also a stand-by for a possible increase to DEFCON 2, which did not occur.911 Commission Report

Operations

The DEFCON level is controlled primarily by the U.S. President and the U.S. Secretary of Defense through the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combatant Commanders, and each DEFCON level defines specific security, activation and response scenarios for the troops in question.
Different branches of the U.S. Armed Forces (like the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, Air Force) and different bases or command groups can be activated at different defense conditions. There is no single DEFCON status for the country, as they are decided on an individual basis by respective branches of the military.
