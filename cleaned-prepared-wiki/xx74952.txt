M3 is a Canadian English language Category A specialty channel that is owned by Bell Media. Established in 1998 as MuchMoreMusic, the network began as a spin-off of the youth-oriented MuchMusic, targeting an older demographic with adult contemporary, classic hits, and classic rock music videos, along with music news programs and concert specials. Its lineup later expanded to incorporate pop culture programming (often sourced from the similar U.S. network VH1), reality shows, dramas and sitcoms.
The network is headquartered alongside its sister networks at 299 Queen Street West in Toronto, Ontario.

History

In June 1993, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) began accepting applications to licence new Canadian specialty channels
At a subsequent February 1994 public hearing, the CRTC reviewed a total of seven applications for music channels, comprising five country music channels, MuchMoreMusic, and CHUM's MusiquExtra, which was to be a French-language adult contemporary counterpart.
Then, in January 1996, the next round of licensing began, drawing another 44 applications; CHUM submitted nine of these, including MuchMoreMusic and the French-language adult contemporary channel, now called MusiMax (formerly MusicMax).
MuchMoreMusic was licensed by the CRTC in 1996 (as well as some of CHUM's other proposals rejected in 1994, including CablePulse24, Space, and Musimax) and was launched on October 5, 1998 under the ownership of CHUM Limited.

Early Years

In January 1999, The Globe and Mail critic John Doyle commented on the channel's invariant hosting at the time: "It appears to be staffed by one person only, Jana Lynne White. The woman does everything -- interviews, running down the appalling video chart, promos, everything except come to your house and turn on the TV for you."
In September 2004, MuchMoreMusic launched a sister digital network, MuchMoreRetro, which focuses exclusively on classic music videos.

Sale to CTV

On June 22, 2007, CTVglobemedia gained control of MuchMoreMusic as a result of a takeover of CHUM Limited. On March 31, 2009, MuchMoreMusic was relaunched with a new on-air format and subsequently became known as MuchMore. The changeover took effect at 6:00 a.m. ET, with the first edition of the newly branded morning video flow series Juiced!
Ownership changed hands once again, when Bell Canada gained 100% control of CTVglobemedia's assets including MuchMore it did not already own, on April 1, 2011, MuchMore was taken over by Bell Media.
On September 19, 2013, Bell announced that MuchMore would be re-launched as M3 on September 30, 2013, shifting towards an entertainment-oriented "superstation" format with a focus on newly acquired dramas and comedy programs alongside music programming. Unlike MuchMore, which was marketed as a spin-off of MuchMusic, M3 is marketed as a separate brand from MuchMusic, to quell concerns over viewers incorrectly suggesting that the network was catered towards a youth demographic like MuchMusic due to its similar name. A high definition feed was also launched.
As part of the rebrand, MuchMoreRetro was re-branded as MuchRetro, aligning the channel with the MuchMusic brand. The MuchMore Countdown became the M3 Countdown and was relaunched with a new format on January 18, 2014. It, along with the renamed M3Top20.
