Villagers are an Irish indie folk band from Dublin, formed in 2008. The band consists of Conor O'Brien, Tommy McLaughlin, Danny Snow, James Byrne and Cormac Curran.
The band came to prominence in 2010 with the release of their debut album, Becoming a Jackal. Released to critical acclaim, the album was subsequently nominated for both the Mercury Prize and the Choice Music Prize. The band's second studio album, {Awayland} was released in 2013, and, like its predecessor, was also nominated for the Mercury Prize.
Villagers have performed at several music festivals and toured with Grizzly Bear, Tracy Chapman, Bell X1, Tindersticks and Elbow.

History

Conor O'Brien formed Villagers after the break-up of his previous band The Immediate. The very next day, O'Brien wrote the first song after waking up with a hangover. O'Brien's time as a guitarist in Cathy Davey's band was also critical to the development of his style as he had never before performed alongside anyone outside of The Immediate. Villagers gave their first live performance as a support act with The Chapters at a show in Whelan's in November 2008. At that point the band had previously only rehearsed together on two occasions. They had only seven songs, written by O'Brien and passed on to the rest of the band to learn.
Villagers performed on the seventh series of RTÉ Two's Other Voices television programme in 2009. They were a support act for Neil Young and toured across Europe with Tracy Chapman.
Villagers appeared at several festivals in 2009. They supported Bell X1 when they performed at Live at the Marquee in Cork on 26 June 2009.
The debut single of Villagers was "On a Sunlit Stage" and was released in October 2009.
On 15 January 2010, Villagers represented Ireland at  the Eurosonic Festival in Groningen, the Netherlands.
On 13 April 2010, Villagers appeared on Later... with Jools Holland on BBC Two alongside Paul Weller, Hot Chip, Marina and the Diamonds, Gogol Bordello and Paul Rodgers.
Villagers played Meltdown in London in June 2010.
In March 2011, Villagers joined Elbow on a two-week tour of the U.K. and Ireland.
In September 2012 the band announced the release of The Waves, the first single from their follow-up album. While at the time the name of the album wasn't announced, the details for {Awayland} were released soon afterwards alongside news of a headline tour in February 2013. The band were just about to start a tour supporting Grizzly Bear in October 2012. A second single, Nothing Arrived, was also announced in December 2012 with a release date set for the 14th January 2013 in conjunction with the launch of {Awayland}.

Style

O'Brien is noted for his dark lyrics – "an eerie sense of disquiet", according to The Guardian.
The New York Timess Jon Pareles compared them to The Frames, U2 and Leonard Cohen after witnessing a live performance in New York City in 2010.
