History

The TMB's first recorded performance was on November 1918 when, at the end of World War I, members of the TMB led a victory parade of America's returning servicemen in New York City.  "Fight On", the fight song of the University was composed in 1922 and became a part of the TMB tradition.  In 1923, the school's alma mater, "All Hail", was composed by a member of the TMB, Al Wesson.  The TMB gave its first national radio concert on CBS on April 19, 1929.  The band participated in the 1932 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, forming the Olympic Braid in the opening ceremonies in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (coincidentally USC's home stadium).
After wearing various uniforms over the years, particularly those with a military-style, the band began using basic, unadorned Trojan-style helmets and uniforms in 1950.  Three years later, the TMB adopted "Conquest", a song composed by Alfred Newman for the film Captain from Castile as a victory march.  The TMB made its first trip outside of California in 1954, traveling to Portland, Oregon to play a USC-Oregon game that the Trojans would win, 24–14.  During the Grammy Awards of 1966, TMB trumpet alumnus Herb Alpert won three Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year.  Dr. Art Bartner took over the program in 1970, and began shaping the band into its current form.  Women were allowed to join the band in 1972.
After several more uniform changes, the TMB began using more elaborate Trojan helmets with brushes, visors, and ear flaps in 1972.  In 1973 the TMB began its tradition of sending the full band to games at USC-Notre Dame rivalry games at Notre Dame Stadium.
In 1979, the TMB was invited by Fleetwood Mac to perform and record "Tusk", the title song for the album Tusk. The album went double-platinum and was adopted as a part of the TMB's traditional selections. Additionally, the band later played on another multi-platinum Fleetwood Mac album, The Dance (1997)."The Dance", Fleetwood Mac, RIAA Gold and Platinum Database.
During the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Dr. Bartner directed a 800-member All American College Marching Band, 125 of which were members of the TMB.  1987 featured several significant moments for the band: The TMB trumpets performed the fanfare for Pope John Paul II in his visit to Los Angeles, the band performed during Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena, and the band began its current streak of attending all USC home and away football games.  In 1988, the TMB performed again at Super Bowl XXII in San Diego, at the Expo '88 World's Fair held in Brisbane, Australia during that nation's bicentenary.
The band took several more international trips in the 1990s, including to the Berlin Wall after its fall, Amsterdam, Brussels, Innsbruck, Japan, the then-EuroDisneyLand in France, the Seville Expo '92, and to France to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the D-Day Landings.  The band also participated in Super Bowl XXIV in New Orleans, the opening ceremony of the 1994 FIFA World Cup.  In 1993, USC alumnus and then U.S. Representative Christopher Cox welcomed the band from the floor of the Congress.
In 2003, the TMB performed during the Chinese New Year celebration in Hong Kong, a year later it also played at the Great Wall of China, Xi'an, Shanghai as well as returning to Hong Kong for the Chinese New Year.  The TMB participated in Expo 2005 in Nagoya, Japan, while also performing in Tokyo and Kyoto.  In 2006 the TMB went to Italy and performed in Venice, Florence and in front of the Colosseum of Rome.  In 2010, the band traveled to Shanghai, China, once again to play for United States National Day at the 2010 World Expo.
At the end of the 2008 season, the TMB appeared in the 95th Rose Bowl. This marks the 33rd time USC has played in the "Granddaddy of Them All".
