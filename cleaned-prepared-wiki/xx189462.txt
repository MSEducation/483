Career

Silva grew up in Tecomate, Veracruz. He began his career as a steeplechase specialist and won his first medals in that event, taking bronze at the 1988 Ibero-American Championships then winning his first international title at the 1990 Central American and Caribbean Games in Mexico City.

Retrieved on 2011-10-27. In his final international steeplechase outing, he came sixth at the 1991 Pan American Games.
Silva changed his focus to the 10,000 metres for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and the switch paid off as he ran a career best time of 27:46.52 minutes in June then finished in sixth place in the Olympic final. He represented Mexico in the event at the 1993 World Championships in Athletics and came ninth overall. He returned for a second attempt at the 1995 World Championships in Athletics and despite having one of his fastest ever runs in the heats (27:49.07 min), he eventually finished in 13th place.
He came third at the 1994 London Marathon, then finished as runner-up behind Khalid Skah at the 1994 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Oslo, taking the silver medal. Although he was one second away from victory at the Oslo race, his half marathon time of 1:00:28 hours was a Mexican record – a mark which, as of 2012, remains the country's best mark. During the New York Marathon race in November, he recovered from a wrong turn seven-tenths of a mile before the finish that put him 40 yards behind Benjamín Paredes. He ran a 5:15 final mile, including the detour, to beat Paredes by two seconds with a time of 2:11:21 hours. NEW YORK CITY MARATHON; Silva: Detour, Stop, Reverse, Victory. New York Times.

He made his Olympic marathon debut for the 1996 Atlanta Games and managed to finish in sixth place. In 1997 he was fifth in New York and fourth in the Boston Marathon.
