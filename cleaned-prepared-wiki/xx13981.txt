[[19-inch rack]]

CATEGORIES: Computer enclosure, Server hardware, Mechanical standards

A 19-inch rack is a standardized frame or enclosure for mounting multiple equipment modules. Each module has a front panel that is  wide, including edges or ears that protrude on each side which allow the module to be fastened to the rack frame with screws.

Overview and history

Equipment designed to be placed in a rack is typically described as rack-mount, rack-mount instrument, a rack mounted system, a rack mount chassis, subrack, rack mountable, or occasionally simply shelf. The height of the electronic modules is also standardized as multiples of  or one rack unit or U (less commonly RU). The industry standard rack cabinet is 42U tall.
The term relay rack appeared first in the world of telephony. at Syracuse, N.Y., The Electrical Engineer, Vol XXVII, No. 561 (Feb 2, 1899); pages 142-147.  The term relay rack appears on page 144 at the bottom of column 1.  By 1911, the term was also being used in railroad signaling. 4, No. 9 (Sept. 1911); pages 344-345. There is little evidence that the dimensions of these early racks were standardized.  The 19-inch rack format with rack-units of 1.75 inches and holes tapped for 10-24 screws with alternating spacings of 1.25 inches and 0.5 inch was an established standard by 1934.G. Robt. Mezger (W2BLL), The Relay Rack in Amateur Construction, QST Vol. 18 (1934), American Radio Relay League.  Except for a change in screw size and the addition of a hole midway in the 1.25 inch gap, this is fully compatible with the modern rack standard.
The 19-inch rack format has remained constant while the technology that is mounted within it has changed considerably and the set of fields to which racks are applied has greatly expanded. The  centers, is still used in legacy ILEC/CLEC facilities.
19-inch racks in 2-post or 4-post form hold most equipment in modern data centers, ISP facilities and professionally designed corporate server rooms.  They allow for dense hardware configurations without occupying excessive floorspace or requiring shelving.
19-inch racks are also often used to house professional audio and video equipment, including amplifiers, effects units, interfaces, headphone amplifiers, and even small scale audio mixers.  A third common use for rack-mounted equipment is industrial power, control, and automation hardware.
Typically, a piece of equipment being installed has a front panel height .  This gap allows a bit of room above and below an installed piece of equipment so it may be removed without binding on the adjacent equipment.
In 1965, a durable fiber reinforced plastic 19-inch rackmount case was patented by ECS Composites and became widely used in military and commercial applications for electronic deployment and operation. State-of-the-art rackmount cases are now also constructed of thermo stamped composite, carbon fiber and DuPont's Kevlar for demanding military and commercial uses.

Equipment mounting

Fastening

Originally, the mounting holes were tapped to receive a particular type of threaded bolt.  When rack rails are too thin to tap, rivnuts or other threaded inserts can be used, and when the particular class of equipment to be mounted is known in advance, some of the holes can be omitted from the mounting rails. 2011.
Threaded mounting holes in racks where the equipment is frequently changed are problematic because the threads can be damaged or the mounting screws can break off; both problems render the mounting hole unusable.  Tapping large numbers of holes that may never be used is expensive; nonetheless tapped-hole racks are still in use, generally for hardware that rarely changes.  Examples include telephone exchanges, network cabling panels, broadcast studios and some government and military applications.
The tapped-hole rack was first replaced by clearance-hole (Round Hole, Round Unthreaded Holes, Define: Rack Hole Types and Versa RailWhat is a Versa Rail) racks. The holes are large enough to permit a bolt to be freely inserted through without binding, and bolts are fastened in place using cage nuts. In the event of a nut being stripped out or a bolt breaking, the nut can be easily removed and replaced with a new one. Production of clearance-hole racks is less expensive because tapping the holes is eliminated and replaced with fewer, less expensive, cage nuts.
The next innovation in rack design has been the square-hole rack. Square-hole racks allow boltless mounting, such that the rack-mount equipment only needs to insert through and hook down into the lip of the square hole. Installation and removal of hardware in a square hole rack is very easy and boltless, where the weight of the equipment and small retention clips are all that is necessary to hold the equipment in place. Older equipment meant for round-hole or tapped-hole racks can still be used, with the use of cage nuts made for square-hole racks.

Structural support

Rack-mountable equipment is traditionally mounted by bolting or clipping its front panel to the rack. Within the IT industry, it's common for network/communications equipment to have multiple mounting positions, including table-top and wall mounting, so rack mountable equipment will often feature L-brackets that must be screwed or bolted to the equipment prior to mounting in a 19-inch rack. With the prevalence of 23-inch racks in the Telecoms industry, the same practice is also common, but with equipment having 19-inch and 23-inch brackets available, enabling them to be mounted in existing racks.
A key structural weakness of front-mounted support is the shear stress placed on the mounting rails and the leading edge of the equipment. As a result, 4-post racks have become common, with such racks featuring a mirrored pair of rear mounting posts. Since the spacing between the front and rear mounting posts may differ between rack vendors and/or the configuration of the rack (some racks may incorporate front and rear rails that may be moved forwards and backwards, i.e. APC SX-range racks), it's common for equipment that features 4-post mounting brackets, to have an adjustable rear bracket.
Servers and deep pieces of equipment are often mounted using rails that are bolted to the front and rear posts (as above, it's common for such rails to have an adjustable depth), allowing the equipment to be supported by 4-posts, whilst also enabling it to be easily installed and removed.
While there is no standard for the depth of equipment, nor specifying the outer width and depth of the rack enclosure itself (incorporating the structure, doors and panels that contain the mounting rails), there is a tendency for 4-post racks to be 600 mm or 800 mm wide, and for them to be 600 mm, 800 mm or 1010 mm deep. This of course varies by manufacturer, the design of the rack and its purpose, but through common constraining factors (such as raised floor tile dimensions), these dimensions have become quite common. The extra width and depth enables cabling to be routed with ease (also helping to maintain bend-radius for fibre and copper cables) and deeper equipment to be utilised. A common feature in IT racks are mounting positions for "Zero-U" accessories, such as PDU (power distribution units) and vertical cable managers/ducts, that utilise the space between the rear rails and the side of the rack enclosure.
The strength required of the mounting posts means they are invariably not merely flat strips but actually a wider folded strip arranged around the corner of the rack. The posts are usually made of steel of around 2 mm thickness (the official standard recommends a minimum of 1.9 mm), or of slightly thicker aluminum.
Racks, especially two-post racks, are often secured to the floor or adjacent building structure so as not to fall over. This is usually required by local building codes in seismic zones. According to Telcordia Technologies Generic Requirements document GR-63-CORE, during an earthquake, telecommunications equipment is subjected to motions that can over-stress equipment framework, circuit boards, and connectors. The amount of motion and resulting stress depends on the structural characteristics of the building and framework in which the equipment is contained, and the severity of the earthquake. Seismic racks rated according to  GR-63, NEBS Requirements: Physical Protection, are available,Telcordia GR-63-CORE, NEBSTM Requirements: Physical Protection with Zone 4 representing the most demanding environment.Seismic Enclosures Provide an Extra Measure of Protection
GR-3108, Generic Requirements for Network Equipment in the Outside Plant (OSP), specifies the usable opening of seismic-compliant 19-inch racks.

Rails (slides)

Heavy equipment or equipment which is commonly accessed for servicing, for which attaching or detaching at all four corners simultaneously would pose a problem, is often not mounted directly onto the rack but instead is mounted via rails (or slides). A pair of rails is mounted directly onto the rack, and the equipment then slides into the rack along the rails, which support it. When in place, the equipment may also then be bolted to the rack. The rails may also be able to fully support the equipment in a position where it has been slid clear of the rack; this is useful for inspection or maintenance of equipment which will then be slid back into the rack. George, Chassis Slide Mechanism, , granted Oct. 8, 1957.
Slides or rails for computers and other data processing equipment such as disk arrays or routers often need to be purchased directly from the equipment manufacturer, as there is no standardization on such equipment's thickness (measurement from the side of the rack to the equipment) or means for mounting to the rail.

Computer mounting

Computer servers designed for rack-mounting can include a number of extra features to make the server easy to use in the rack:
When there is a large number of computers in a single rack, it is impractical for each one to have its own separate keyboard, mouse, and monitor. Instead, a KVM switch or LOM software is used to share a single keyboard/video/mouse set amongst many different computers.
Since the mounting hole arrangement is vertically symmetric, it is possible to mount rack-mountable equipment upside-down. However, not all equipment is suitable for this type of mounting. For instance, most optical disc players will not work upside-down because the driving motor mechanism does not grip the disc.

Four- and two-post racks

Racks are available with either four or two vertical posts. Four-post racks allow for mounting rails to support the equipment at the front and rear. These racks may be open in construction (similar to the traditional open-style two-post racks), or may be enclosed by front and/or rear doors, side panels, or tops. Two-post racks provide just two vertical posts; a piece of equipment can be mounted either via its front panel holes, or close to its center of gravity (to minimize load on its front panel), depending on the design of the rack. Two-post racks are most often used for telecommunication installations.

Specifications

The formal standards for a  rack are available from the following:
A rack's mounting fixture consists of two parallel metal strips (also referred to as "posts" or "panel mounts") standing vertically. The posts are each .Define: EIA-310 | The Server Rack FAQ
The holes in the posts are arranged vertically in repeating sets of three, with center-to-center separations of .
Holes so arranged can either be tapped (usually 10-32 UNF thread, or, less often, 6mm metric) or have square holes for cage nuts.

Rack Unit (U)

Racks are divided into regions,  from the top or bottom of the region. Such a region is commonly known as a U, for "unit", or in German "HE" (for Höheneinheit) and heights within racks are measured by this unit. Rack-mountable equipment is usually designed to occupy some integer number of U. For example, an oscilloscope might be 4U high, and rack-mountable computers are mostly between 1U and 4U high.  A blade server enclosure might require 10U.
Occasionally, one may see fractional U devices such as a 1.5U server, but these are much less common. 1.5U servers have more airflow, less noise and better cooling than 1U servers, and are still more space-efficient than 2U servers.prweb.htm
The height of a rack can vary from a few inches, such as in a broadcast console, to a floor mounted rack whose interior is 45 rack units () high. Many wall-mounted industrial equipment enclosures have 19-inch rack rails to support mounting of equipment.
