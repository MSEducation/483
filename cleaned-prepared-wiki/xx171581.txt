David "Nino" Rodriguez (born September 18, 1977 in El Paso, Texas) is an American heavyweight boxer. He is currently ranked number 15 in the world by the WBC and number 5 in the world by the IBA. He defeated Owen Beck in El Paso to win the WBC FECOMBOX Mexican Heavyweight Championship.
Rodriguez has a 36–0 record (34 KOs, 24 inside 1st round). Rodriguez held the Texas Heavyweight title, New Mexico Heavyweight title as well as the WBC Fecarbox Latin title. This was his most prestigious win against a very tough and durable contender in Manuel Pucheta for the N.A.B.A Heavyweight title. This was until he stepped up in class and had the most impressive win of his career. Now the biggest win up to date is against former #1 contender and challenger for the heavyweight championship Owen Beck. Owen was knocked out by a double short hook for over 15 minutes. He also had a 3rd round stoppage against a veteran Robert Davis. He now has top contender recognition and is awaiting a world title shot. Rodriguez recently defeated veteran Byron Polley for the NABU Heavyweight Title on Dec 3, 2011.

Early life and education

Rodriguez, from El Paso Texas, went to Coronado High School and is currently managed by Zeferino Entertainment. Rodriguez also owns his own promotion company Ninobravo Promotions that hopes to bring better quality Boxing and MMA events to the city of El Paso Texas.

Amateur record

His amateur record is 10-1 with 6 KOs.

Professional career

On November 7, 2003, Rodriguez won the Texas State Heavyweight Title with a first round knockout victory over Tommy Connelly in El Paso, Texas. On April 17, 2004, Rodriguez won the New Mexico State Heavyweight Title with a first round TKO victory over Jeff Lally in Las Cruces, New Mexico. On the undercard of Holyfield-Savarese in 2007 he stopped the 6'9" 276 lbs Rick Dyer, who was undefeated at 13-0 (13 KOs) coming into the bout. Rodriguez beat Manuel Alberto Pucheta by an impressive TKO in seventh to win the NABA heavyweight title in 2009.
