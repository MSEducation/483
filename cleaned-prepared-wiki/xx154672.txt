Damaged by friendly fire off Sicily

USS Brant was accidentally damaged 10 August 1943, off Sicily, when inadequate signals caused friendly naval forces to shell her.

2. BRANT was not equipped with radar.
3. BRANT only knew BENSON was in area after star shell had burst.
4. BRANT used her aldis lamp to challenge BENSON because her 12-in lamp was immediately destroyed.
5. The BENSON used a blue signal lamp from 4500 yards. (Not visible until 2500 yards)
6. BRANT was in a regular convoy route.
7. BRANT damage was on main deck.

Between 6 and 19 June 1944 she furnished logistic support to ships participating in the invasion of Normandy.
Brant continued with her salvage duties in English and French waters until June 1945 when she proceeded to Bremerhaven, Germany.
