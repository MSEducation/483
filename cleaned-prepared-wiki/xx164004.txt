She won three national butterfly championships: 100 yards and 200 metres in 1977 and the 200-yard event in 1978. The next year while still in high school, Nancy left home to train for the 1980 Olympics with the University of Florida swim team. She qualified for the team, but the American-led 1980 Summer Olympics boycott in Moscow kept her home.
Duke University offered Hogshead its first swimming scholarship. There, she was again undefeated in dual meets and set a school record in eight different events; one of which stood until 2011. She only swam for one year at Duke, but she was a Four-Time ACC Champion and Two-Time All-American for 1981.
Hogshead was red-shirted by Duke University after the fall of 1981 after she was raped by a stranger while running between campuses, and suffered from PTSD for several months. In the fall of 1982, her coach offered her a scholarship and a position on the team if she merely showed up at the competitions. Entering competitive swimming awakened competitive juices. She left Duke in the spring semester of 1983 to train full-time for the 1984 Olympics. This time she switched from butterfly to freestyle. She won the 1984 National indoor 200-yard event and qualified for the 1984 US swimming team.

Olympics

Hogshead and teammate Carrie Steinseifer had identical times and both were awarded gold medals in the first tie in Olympic swimming.
