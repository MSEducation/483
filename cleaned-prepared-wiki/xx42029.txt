Background

Oritz was born in Huntington Beach, California where he lived until he moved to Santa Ana, California at the age of five, and was given the nickname "Tito" by his father, Sam, when he was only a year old. Ortiz is of half-Mexican from his paternal side, Hawaiian descent on his maternal side, and has four older brothers. Ortiz had a difficult childhood as both of his parents were addicted to heroin, while Ortiz was involved with street gangs, was placed in juvenile halls, and experimented with drugs such as cocaine and PCP. His parents divorced when he was 13 years old, and his mother took the young Ortiz with her back to Huntington Beach. When he was only seven years old, Ortiz supported himself by selling fish that he caught at a local pier and later attended Huntington Beach High School, where he began wrestling during his sophomore year and excelled at the sport, winning a CIF championship at 189 pounds, and finished fourth in the state tournament as a senior. When Ortiz was 18 years old, his mother kicked him out of the house and he began living with one of his brothers while doing labor work, and later became addicted to methamphetamines. When he was 19 years old, Ortiz ran into an old high school wrestling coach, a future UFC fighter and the head wrestling coach at Golden West College, Paul Herrera, who encouraged him to enroll in the college. Ortiz then began attending Golden West where he was a NJCAA state champion two consecutive years before transferring California State University at Bakersfield, where he continued wrestling but was never a full-time starter. Ortiz also trained with the legendary UFC fighter and fellow collegiate wrestler, Tank Abbott.oyemag.html

Mixed martial arts

Ultimate Fighting Championship

Ortiz's mixed martial arts debut was at UFC 13 in 1997. Still in college, Ortiz competed as an amateur for no prize money or contracts. He beat Wes Albritton in an alternate bout by referee stoppage at 0:31 of the first round. He was selected to face Guy Mezger in the Light Heavyweight final after Enson Inoue could not continue due to injury.  Despite dominating Mezger at first, Ortiz lost the fight at 2:00 in the first round by a guillotine choke submission. After returning with a TKO victory over Jeremy Screeton at West Coast NHB Championships 1, Ortiz fought top ranked fighter and UFC 12 Light Heavyweight Tournament Champion Jerry Bohlander at UFC 18. Ortiz dominated the fight and won via TKO due to cut stoppage. Ortiz then avenged his loss to Mezger at UFC 19 by TKO. Ortiz's post fight antics towards Mezger and the Lion's Den led to his long running rivalry with the team's leader Ken Shamrock.
Ortiz has credited former UFC Heavyweight Champion Bas Rutten for inspiration during his early days. Ortiz said; "I looked up to Bas Rutten. Bas was my idol. People were just so scared of fighting him, he was like the man. I thought that was what I need to do now. If I train as hard as he does then one day I'll be as good as him and two years later look where I am, I'm on top of the world. I'm got to say thanks to him, (Bas) for helping me out by making me believe in dreams."
In 1999, Ortiz fought Frank Shamrock for what is now known as the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship at UFC 22." Despite controlling Shamrock for the majority of the fight, Ortiz ended up losing via submission due to strikes. Following the victory, Shamrock retired and vacated the championship. The Middleweight division was then officially renamed the Light Heavyweight (205 lb) division and Ortiz was chosen, along with Wanderlei Silva, as a top contender. Ortiz defeated Silva for the vacant Light Heavyweight Championship at UFC 25'' via unanimous decision. He went on to defend the Light Heavyweight Championship a record five times in the following three years, defeating Yuki Kondo, Evan Tanner, Elvis Sinosic, Vladimir Matyushenko and Lion's Den head Ken Shamrock.
At UFC 44, after a near year-long layoff from the sport, Ortiz fought the new Interim Light Heavyweight Champion Randy Couture, who had defeated Chuck Liddell for the interim title at UFC 43 in September 2003. Couture defeated Ortiz via unanimous decision. The loss ended Ortiz's near three and a half year title reign, which was the longest Light Heavyweight Championship reign until Jon Jones won his sixth victory while maintaining the Light Heavyweight Championship on September 21, 2013, Light Heavyweight Championship#Light Heavyweight Championship Following his loss to Couture, Ortiz faced Chuck Liddell at UFC 47, losing by TKO in the second round.
