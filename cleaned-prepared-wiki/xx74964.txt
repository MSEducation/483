Economy

The province is a typical developing area, exporting primary products and importing manufactured goods and services. It is also one of the poorest regions of South Africa, especially rural areas.jhu.2gyekye. A recent border shift with the Limpopo's wealthier neighbour, Mpumalanga, was effected to try and bring some wealth into the province.

Agriculture

The bushveld is beef cattle country, where extensive ranching operations are often supplemented by controlled hunting. About 80% of South Africa's game hunting industry is found in Limpopo.
Sunflowers, cotton, maize and peanuts are cultivated in the Bela-Bela and Modimolle areas. Modimolle is also known for its table-grape crops. 
Tropical fruit–such as bananas, litchis, pineapples, mangoes and pawpaws–as well as a variety of nuts, are grown in the Tzaneen and Louis Trichardt areas. Tzaneen is also at the centre of extensive citrus, tea and coffee plantations, as well as forestry.

Mining

Limpopo's rich mineral deposits include the platinum group metals, iron ore, chromium high- and middle-grade coking coal, diamonds, antimony, phosphate, and copper—as well as mineral reserves like gold, emeralds, scheelite, magnetite, vermiculite, silicon, and mica. Commodities such as black granite, corundum, and feldspar are also found. Mining contributes to over a fifth of the provincial economy.
The Waterberg Coalfield, the eastern extension of Botswana's Mmamabula coalfields, is estimated to contain 40% of South Africa's coal resources.[ref]

Tourism

Tourism is one of the three pillars of the Limpopo economy along with mining and agribusiness,. The R 93 million Provincial tourism budget for 2010/11 represents 11% of Limpopo's total budget.DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, ENVIRONMENT & TOURISM Budget Speech 2009/2010, retrieved 9 July 2010

=Tourism Development=

The Limpopo Department of Economic Development, Environment and Tourism has targeted the province as a preferred eco-tourism destination. Its Environment and Tourism Programme encompasses tourism, protected areas and community environment development to achieve sustainable economic growth
Whilst Limpopo is one of South Africa's poorest provinces, it is rich in wildlife which gives it an edge in attracting tourism. Both the private and public sectors are investing in tourism development.

Infrastructure and communications

The province has excellent road, rail, and air links. The N1 route from Johannesburg, which extends the length of the province, is the busiest overland route in Africa in terms of cross-border trade in raw materials and beneficiated goods. The port of Durban, Africa's busiest, is served directly by the province, as are the ports of Richards Bay and Maputo. The Polokwane International Airport is situated in Polokwane, the capital of the province.

Education

The branch is charged with the responsibility of effecting quality education and training for all. It was during this time that the branch had to shape up its direction and co-ordinate all professional developments and support. Policies, systems, and procedures had to be developed. This was not easily achievable due to lack of personnel to effect change.
Hereunder follows a brief description of the activities which the branch carried out.

Curriculum development and education technology

The greater part of this was characterised by a series of workshop on awareness and training on Curriculum 2005. Learning programmes were developed up to the selection of the relevant learning materials for grade 1 for 1998. The new curriculum for Grade 1 was subjected to a trailing phase with few selected pilot schools. This was seen as a breakthrough in breaking with the past in terms of philosophy and methodology of approach to concepts and information.
In order for teaching and learning to be effective workshops were also conducted on Technology Enhanced Learning Initiative. This was seen as a marriage between theory and practice to improvise for the effectiveness of the learning experience. Pilot schools were selected for Technology 2005 which, in spite of the lack of necessary equipment, was seen as a success.

Structural affairs and statistics

There was not much progress realised in this area due to the lack of personnel and necessary equipment. There was almost total dependence on outsourcing which in a way crippled this department in terms of building capacity to the skeleton staff available. The department could not capture all the necessary data. In order to plan properly one should have access to information and also develop management systems for the sake of control and monitoring. Although a number of a strategic planning units is seen as a handicap towards development.

Early childhood development

Much progress was made in this area through the assistance of UNICEF which provided technical assistance towards the development of ECD policy document. All stakeholders participated to produce a policy document.

Projects and funding

There was an advocacy campaign to educate the communities on the delivery of basic educational needs, e.g. classroom provisioning.
The directorate drew proposals for Japan International Cooperation Agency and was instrumental in effecting the Interactive Tele-teaching Programme with funds from Limpopo Education Development Trust. Business plans for the RDP projects were developed and also funding proposal for the Presidential Education Initiative which involved foreign countries. Workshops on ABET were conducted focusing on the implementation of the new policy. Stakeholders were involved with the national department taking the lead towards the development of action plans.
