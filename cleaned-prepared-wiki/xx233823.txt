Over the course of centuries, many Aboriginal Canadians have played a critical role in shaping the history of Canada.  From art and music, to law and government, to sports and war; Aboriginal customs and culture have had a strong influences on defining  Canadian culture.
1,172,790 million people reported having at least some Aboriginal ancestry in 2006, representing 3.8% of the total Canadian population. From 1981 to 2001, the percentage of Aboriginal people who obtained college diplomas increased from 15.0 per cent to 22.0 per cent, while the percentage that obtained university degrees increased  from 4.0 per cent to 6.0 per cent.  This compares with increases of 20.0 per cent to 25.0 per cent for non-Aboriginal people obtaining college diplomas that is a narrow gap between the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal population. This is partly due to organizations that focus attention on the achievements and welfare of Aboriginal Canadians like, Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, Native Women's Association of Canada, Aboriginal Curatorial Collective, National Aboriginal Health Organization, Metis Child and Family Services Society and Aboriginal Peoples Television Network.
