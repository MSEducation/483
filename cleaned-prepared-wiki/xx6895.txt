[[File:Lorentz transform of world line.
The vertical direction indicates time, while the horizontal indicates distance, the dashed line is the spacetime trajectory ("world line") of the observer. The small dots are specific events in spacetime. If one imagines these events to be the flashing of a light, then the events that pass the two diagonal lines in the bottom half of the image (the past light cone of the observer in the origin) are the events visible to the observer.
The slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) gives the relative velocity to the observer. Note how the momentarily co-moving inertial frame changes when the observer accelerates.]]

The yellow axes are the rest frame of an observer, the blue axes correspond to the frame of a moving observer
The red lines are world lines, a continuous sequence of events: straight for an object travelling at constant velocity, curved for an object accelerating. Worldlines of light form the boundary of the light cone.
The purple hyperbolae indicate this is a hyperbolic rotation, the hyperbolic angle ϕ is called rapidity (see below). The greater the relative speed between the reference frames, the more "warped" the axes become. The relative velocity cannot exceed c.
The black arrow is a displacement four-vector between two events (not necessarily on the same world line), showing that in a Lorentz boost; time dilation (fewer time intervals in moving frame) and length contraction (shorter lengths in moving frame) occur. The axes in the moving frame are orthogonal (even though they do not look so).

Rapidity

The Lorentz transformation can be cast into another useful form by defining a parameter ϕ called the rapidity (an instance of hyperbolic angle) such that
and thus
Equivalently:
Then the Lorentz transformation in standard configuration is:

=Hyperbolic expressions=

From the above expressions for eφ and e−φ
and therefore,

=Hyperbolic rotation of coordinates=

Substituting these expressions into the matrix form of the transformation, it is evident that
Thus, the Lorentz transformation can be seen as a hyperbolic rotation of coordinates in Minkowski space, where the parameter  represents the hyperbolic angle of rotation, often referred to as rapidity. This transformation is sometimes illustrated with a Minkowski diagram, as displayed above.
This 4-by-4 boost matrix can thus be written compactly as a Matrix exponential,
where the simpler Lie-algebraic hyperbolic rotation generator  is called a boost generator.

Transformation of other physical quantities

The transformation matrix is universal for all four-vectors, not just 4-dimensional spacetime coordinates. If Z is any four-vector, then:Gravitation, J.A. Wheeler, C. Misner, K.S. Thorne, W.H. Freeman & Co, 1973, ISBN 0-7167-0344-0
or in tensor index notation:
in which the primed indices denote indices of Z in the primed frame.
More generally, the transformation of any tensor quantity T is given by:

Special relativity

The crucial insight of Einstein's clock-setting method is the idea that time is relative. In essence, each observer's frame of reference is associated with a unique set of clocks, the result being that time as measured for a location passes at different rates for different observers. This was a direct result of  the Lorentz transformations and is called time dilation.  We can also clearly see from the Lorentz "local time" transformation that the concept of the relativity of simultaneity and of the relativity of length contraction are also consequences of that clock-setting hypothesis.R. Forshaw, A.G. Smith, Wiley, 2009, ISBN 978 0 470 01460 8

Transformation of the electromagnetic field

Lorentz transformations can also be used to prove that magnetic and electric fields are simply different aspects of the same force — the electromagnetic force, as a consequence of relative motion between electric charges and observers.S. Grant, W.R. Phillips, Manchester Physics, John Wiley & Sons, 2008, ISBN 9-780471-927129 The fact that the electromagnetic field shows relativistic effects becomes clear by carrying out a simple thought experiment:Introduction to Electrodynamics (3rd Edition), D.J. Griffiths, Pearson Education, Dorling Kindersley, 2007, ISBN 81-7758-293-3
This shows that the Lorentz transformation also applies to electromagnetic field quantities when changing the frame of reference, given below in vector form.

The correspondence principle

For relative speeds much less than the speed of light, the Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean transformation in accordance with the correspondence principle.
The correspondence limit is usually stated mathematically as: as v → 0, c → ∞.  In words: as velocity approaches 0, the speed of light (seems to) approach infinity.  Hence, it is sometimes said that nonrelativistic physics is a physics of "instantaneous action at a distance".

Spacetime interval

In a given coordinate system xμ, if two events A and B are separated by
the spacetime interval between them is given by
This can be written in another form using the Minkowski metric.  In this coordinate system,
Then, we can write
or, using the Einstein summation convention,
Now suppose that we make a coordinate transformation xμ → x′ μ.  Then, the interval in this coordinate system is given by
or
It is a result of special relativity that the interval is an invariant.  That is, s2 = s′ 2.  For this to hold, it can be shown: (Section 2:1) that it is necessary (but not sufficient) for the coordinate transformation to be of the form
Here, Cμ is a constant vector and Λμν a constant matrix, where we require that
Such a transformation is called a Poincaré transformation or an inhomogeneous Lorentz transformation. : volume 1. The Ca represents a spacetime translation.  When Ca = 0, the transformation is called an homogeneous Lorentz transformation, or simply a Lorentz transformation.
Taking the determinant of
gives us
The cases are:
From the above definition of Λ it can be shown that (Λ00)2 ≥ 1, so either Λ00 ≥ 1 or Λ00 ≤ −1, called orthochronous and non-orthochronous respectively. An important subgroup of the proper Lorentz transformations are the proper orthochronous Lorentz transformations which consist purely of boosts and rotations. Any Lorentz transform can be written as a proper orthochronous, together with one or both of the two discrete transformations; space inversion P  and time reversal T, whose non-zero elements are:
The set of Poincaré transformations satisfies the properties of a group and is called the Poincaré group.  Under the Erlangen program, Minkowski space can be viewed as the geometry defined by the Poincaré group, which combines Lorentz transformations with translations.  In a similar way, the set of all Lorentz transformations forms a group, called the Lorentz group.
A quantity invariant under Lorentz transformations is known as a Lorentz scalar.
