A stored-program computer is one which stores program instructions in electronic memory.
A computer with a Von Neumann architecture stores program data and instruction data in the same memory; a computer with a Harvard architecture has separate memories for storing program and data.
Stored-program computer is sometimes used as a synonym for von Neumann architecture,
The stored-program computer idea can be traced back to the 1936 theoretical concept of a universal Turing machine.
Many early computers, such as the Atanasoffâ€“Berry Computer, were not reprogrammable. They executed a single hardwired program. As there were no program instructions, no program storage was necessary. Other computers, though programmable, stored their programs on punched tape which was physically fed into the machine as needed.
In 1936 Konrad Zuse also anticipated in two patent applications that machine instructions could be stored in the same storage used for data.Susanne Faber, "Konrad Zuses Bemuehungen um die Patentanmeldung der Z3", 2000
