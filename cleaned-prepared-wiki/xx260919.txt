Marley Station is an enclosed shopping mall in Glen Burnie, Maryland. Opened in 1987, it was expanded in 1993 and 1997. The mall includes J.C. Penney, Macy's and Sears as its anchor stores. In March 2013, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County appointed The Woodmont Company as receiver for Marley Station.

History

Taubman Centers built Marley Station in 1987.
In 2006, Macy's relocated to the Hecht's building when Macy's parent company bought that of Hecht's
Taubman sold the mall to Mills Corporation, later part of Simon Property Group, in 2004. The Woodmont Company of Dallas/Fort Worth was appointed as the receiver to manage and lease Marley Station in March 2013 until Bank of America settles a loan dispute with Simon Property Group or forecloses.
In June 2013 the owner of CyberNAP data center in the former Boscov's, who owns one of the four properties on which the mall sits, expressed an interest in buying all the properties to expand the data center throughout the mall.
At the start of 2012, Marley Station had a vacancy rate of 44%, up from 33% a year earlier.  In June 2013 a spokeswoman for Woodmont said the occupancy rate at the mall was close to 85%.
As of 25 September 2013 the mall was listed on a real estate web site as being up for auction with no date given.
An eight-screen movie theatre, originally operated by United Artists Theatres, opened on June 5, 1987 near the mall's food court. The Movies at Marley Station were later run by Regal Entertainment Group, which had acquired UA. On February 20, 2014, the theater closed its doors after nearly 27 years of service without notice.
