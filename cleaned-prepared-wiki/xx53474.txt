[[File:MP & EN plot of metals7. The other metals are distinguished by their relatively high electronegativity values and relatively low melting points. High electronegativity corresponds to increasing nonmetallic character;Roher 2001, pp. 2‒3 low melting temperature corresponds to weaker cohesive forces between atoms and reduced mechanical strength. 347 The geography of the plot broadly matches that of the periodic table. Starting from the bottom left, and proceeding clockwise, the alkali metals are followed by the heavier alkaline earth metals; the rare earths and actinides (Sc, Y and the lanthanides being here treated as rare earths); transition metals with intermediate electronegativity values and melting points; the refractory metals; the platinum group metals; the coinage metals; and the other metals.
The increased electropositivity of Be and Mg and the higher melting point of Be distances these light alkaline earth metals from their heavier congeners. This separation extends to other differences in physical and chemical behaviour between the light and heavier alkaline earth metals.]]
'Other metals' is not a rigorous IUPAC-approved term. It is a descriptive phrase used here in view of the absence of a widely agreed collective term for the metals in question. or transition metals. These classification groupings are generally found in the same region of the periodic table.
Elements falling into this loose category include aluminium, gallium, indium,  thallium, tin, lead, bismuth and polonium. Germanium and antimony are occasionally included as other metals, although they are usually considered to be metalloids.
On the group 12 transition metals (zinc, cadmium and mercury), SmithSmith 1990, p. 113 observed that, 'Textbook writers have always found difficulty in dealing with these elements.' There is an abrupt and significant reduction in metallic character from group 11 to group 12. 3 Their chemistry is that of main group elements.  xiii, 273–288; Cotton et al. 1999, pp. ix, 598; Massey 2000, pp. 159–176 A 2003 survey of chemistry books showed that they were treated as either transition metals or main group elements on about a 50/50 basis. 952 (other than in the case of mercury at 4 K). They are included here only for comparative purposes. 11; Rosca et al. 2009, pp. 2235–36; Kown et al. 2013

Properties

Group 12

Zinc is a soft metal (MH 2.5) with poor mechanical properties. 603 It has a crystalline structure (BCN 6+6) that is slightly distorted from the ideal. Many zinc compounds are markedly covalent in character. 562 The oxides of zinc in its preferred oxidation state of +2, namely ZnO and Zn(OH)2, are amphoteric;Greenwood & Earnshaw 1998, p. 1209; Gupta CK 2002, p. 590 it forms anionic zincates in strongly basic solutions. 30 Zinc forms Zintl phases such as LiZn, NaZn13 and BaZn13. xxii Highly purified zinc, at room temperature, is ductile. 339 It reacts with moist air to form a thin layer of carbonate that prevents further corrosion. 243
Cadmium is a soft, ductile metal (MH 2.0) that undergoes substantial deformation, under load, at room temperature. 349 Like zinc, it has a crystalline structure (BCN 6+6) that is slightly distorted from the ideal. The halides of cadmium, with the exception of the fluoride, exhibit a substantially covalent nature. 608 The oxides of cadmium in its preferred oxidation state of +2, namely CdO and CdOH2, are weakly amphoteric; it forms cadmates in strongly basic solutions. 287–288, 296; Ivanov-Emin, Misel'son & Greksa 1960 Cadmium forms Zintl phases such as LiCd, RbCd13 and CsCd13. When heated in air to a few hundred degrees, cadmium represents a toxicity hazard due to the release of cadmium vapour; when heated to its boiling point in air (just above 1000 K; 725 C; 1340 F; cf steel ~2700 K; 2425 C; 4400 F),Wanamaker & Pennington 1921, p. 56 the cadmium vapour oxidizes, 'with a reddish-yellow flame, dispersing as an aerosol of potentially lethal CdO particles.' Cadmium is otherwise stable in air and in water, at ambient conditions, protected by a layer of cadmium oxide.
Mercury is a liquid at room temperature. It has the weakest metallic bonding of all, as indicated by its bonding energy (61 kJ/mol) and melting point (−39 °C) which, together, are the lowest of all the metallic elements. 570; Chambers & Holliday 1975, p. 58; Wiberg, Holleman & Wiberg 2001, p. 247; Aylward & Findlay 2008, p. 4 It forms or is a part of Zintl phases such as NaHg and K8In10Hg. 179‒180; Sevov 1993 Mercury is a relatively inert metal, showing little oxide formation at room temperature. 354

Group 13

Aluminium in pure form is a soft metal (MH 3.0) with low mechanical strength. 16; Dwight 1999, p. 2 It has a close-packed structure (BCN 12) showing some evidence of partially directional bonding. 1–2; 359
Gallium is a soft, brittle metal (MH 1.5) that melts at only a few degrees above room temperature. 387 It has an unusual crystalline structure featuring mixed metallic-covalent bonding and low symmetry (BCN 7 i.e. 1+2+2+2). 151; Donohue 1982, p. 237 It bonds covalently in most of its compounds,Walker, Enache & Newman 2013, p. 38 has an amphoteric oxide;Atkins et al. 2006, p. 123 and can form anionic gallates. Gallium forms Zintl phases such as Li2Ga7, K3Ga13 and YbGa2. 161 It is slowly oxidized in moist air at ambient conditions; a protective film of oxide prevents further corrosion. 67
Indium is a soft, highly ductile metal (MH 1.0) with a low tensile strength. 59Russell & Lee 2005, p. 389 It has a partially distorted crystalline structure (BCN 4+8) associated with incompletely ionised atoms. 129–130 The tendency of indium '...Liang, King & White 1968, p. 288 The oxides of indium in its preferred oxidation state of +3, namely In2O3 and In(OH)3 are weakly amphoteric; it forms anionic indates in strongly basic solutions. 33; Liang, King & White 1968, p. 287; Solov'eva et al. 1973, p. 43; Greenwood & Earnshaw 1998, p. 226; Leman & Barron 2005, p. 1522 Indium forms Zintl phases such as LiIn, Na2In and Rb2In3. xxii; Corbett 1996, pp. 153, 158 Indium does not oxidize in air at ambient conditions.
Thallium is a soft, reactive metal (MH 1.0), so much so that it has no structural uses. 390 It has a close-packed crystalline structure (BCN 6+6) but an abnormally large interatomic distance that has been attributed to partial ionisation of the thallium atoms. 1279–80 Although compounds in the +1 (mostly ionic) oxidation state are the more numerous, thallium has an appreciable chemistry in the +3 (largely covalent) oxidation state, as seen in its chalcogenides and trihalides. 709; Taylor & Brothers 1993, p. 131; Lidin 1996, p. 410; Tóth & Győri 2005, pp. 4, 6–7 It is the only one of the Group 13 elements to react with air at room temperature, slowly forming the amphoteric oxide Tl2O3. 144Bashilova & Khomutova 1984, p. 1546Ropp 2012, p. 484 It forms anionic thallates such as Tl3TlO3, Na3Tl(OH)6, NaTlO2, and KTlO2, and is present as the Tl– thallide anion in the compound CsTl. 19 Thallium forms Zintl phases, such as Na2Tl, Na2K21Tl19, CsTl and Sr5Tl3H. 153; King 2004, p. 199

Group 14

Tin is a soft, exceptionallyRussell & Lee 2005, p. 405 weak metal (MH 1.5); a 1-cm thick rod will bend easily under mild finger pressure. It has an irregularly coordinated crystalline structure (BCN 4+2) associated with incompletely ionised atoms. All of the Group 14 elements form compounds in which they are in the +4, predominately covalent, oxidation state; even in the +2 oxidation state tin generally forms covalent bonds. 306, 340  The oxides of tin in its preferred oxidation state of +2, namely SnO and Sn(OH)2, are amphoteric;Wiberg, Holleman & Wiberg 2001, p. 247 it forms stannites in strongly basic solutions. Below 13 °C; 55.4 F tin changes its structure and becomes 'grey tin', which has the same structure as diamond, silicon and germanium (BCN 4). This transformation causes ordinary tin to crumble and disintegrate since, as well as being brittle, grey tin occupies more volume due to having a less efficient crystalline packing structure. Tin forms Zintl phases such as Na4Sn, BaSn, K8Sn25 and Ca31Sn20. 143; Cotton et al. 1999, pp. 99, 122; Kauzlarich 2005, p. 6009 It has good corrosion resistance in air on account of forming a thin protective oxide layer. Pure tin has no structural uses. 402, 405 It is used in lead-free solders, and as a hardening agent in alloys of other metals, such as copper, lead, titanium and zinc. 402, 407
Lead is a soft metal (MH 1.5) which, in many cases,Alhassan & Goodwin 2005, p. 532 is unable to support its own weight. 695 It has a close-packed structure (BCN 12) but an abnormally large inter-atomic distance that has been attributed to partial ionisation of the lead atoms. 86; Norman 1997, p. 36 It forms a semi-covalent dioxide PbO2; a covalently bonded sulfide PbS; covalently bonded halides;Hutchinson 1959, p. 455; Wells 1984, p. 1188; Liu, Knowles & Chang 1995, p. 125; Bharara & Atwood 2005, pp. 2, 4 and a range of covalently bonded organolead compounds such as the lead(II) mercaptan Pb(SC2H5)2, lead tetra-acetate Pb(CH3CO2)4, and the once common, anti-knock additive, tetra-ethyl lead (CH3CH2)4Pb. 670; Lister 1998, p. A12; Cox 2004, p. 204 The oxide of lead in its preferred oxidation state (PbO; +2) is amphoteric;Patnaik 2003, p. 474 it forms anionic plumbates in strongly basic solutions. Lead forms Zintl phases such as CsPb, Sr31Pb20, La5Pb3N and Yb3Pb20. 143, 147; Cotton et al. 1999, p. 122; Kauzlarich 2005, p. 6009 It has reasonable to good corrosion resistance; in moist air it forms a mixed gray coating of oxide, carbonate and sulfate that hinders further oxidation. 411, 13

Group 15

Bismuth is a slightly radioactive, soft metal (MH 2.5) that is too brittle for any structural use. 428 It has an open-packed crystalline structure (BCN 3+3) with bonding that is intermediate between metallic and covalent. 282 For a metal, it has exceptionally low electrical and thermal conductivity. 427 Most of the ordinary compounds of bismuth are covalent in nature. 181 The oxide, Bi2O3 is predominately basic but will act as a weak acid in warm, very concentrated KOH. 62 It can also be fused with potassium hydroxide in air, resulting in a brown mass of potassium bismuthate. 790 The solution chemistry of bismuth is characterised by the formation of oxyanions;Wiberg, Holleman & Wiberg 2001, p. 771; McQuarrie, Rock & Gallogly 2010, p. 111 it forns anionic bismuthates in strongly basic solutions. 328 Bismuth forms Zintl phases such as NaBi,Miller, Lee & Choe 2002, p. 14; Aleandri & Bogdanović 2008, p. 326 Rb7In4Bi6Bobev & Sevov 2002 and Ba11Cd8Bi14.Bailar et al. 1984, p. 951 refer to bismuth as being, 'the least "metallic" metal in its physical properties' given its brittle nature (and possibly) 'the lowest electrical conductivity of all metals.'

Group 16

Polonium is radioactive, soft metal with a hardness similar to lead.  1, 31 It has a simple cublc crystalline structure characterised (as determined by electron density calculations) by partially directional bonding,Russell & Lee 2005, p. 431 and a BCN of 6. Such a structure ordinarily results in very low ductility and fracture resistanceHalford 2006,p. 378 however polonium has been predicted to be a ductile metal. 594; Petrii 2012, p. 754 its halides are covalent, volatile compounds, resembling those of tellurium. 83 The oxide of polonium in its preferred oxidation state (PoO2; +4) is predominately basic, but amphoteric if dissolved in concentrated aqueous alkali, or fused with potassium hydroxide in air. 42, 61; Wiberg, Holleman & Wiberg 2001, pp. 767–68 The yellow polonate(IV) ion  is known in aqueous solutions of low Cl‒ concentration and high pH. 241, 243
 Polonides such as Na2Po, BePo, ZnPo, CdPo and HgPo feature Po2– anions;Wiberg, Holleman & Wiberg 2001, pp. 283, 595 except for HgPo these are some of the more stable of the polonium compounds. 766

Related groupings

B-subgroup metals

Superficially, the B-subgroup metals are the metals in Groups IB to VIB of the periodic table, corresponding to Groups 11 to 16 using current IUPAC nonmenclature. Practically, the group 11 metals (copper, silver and gold) are ordinarily regarded as transition metals (or sometimes as coinage metals, or noble metals) whereas the group 12 metals (zinc, cadmium, and mercury) may or may not be treated as B-subgroup metals depending on if the transition metals are taken to end at group 11 or group 12. The 'B' nomenclature (as in Groups IB, IIB, and so on) was superseded in 1988 but is still occasionally encountered in more recent literature. 260: 'The compounds AsSn and SbSn, which are classified as alloys of two B subgroup metals, exhibit superconducting properties with a transition temperature of about 4 K.'; Schwartz 2010, p. 32: 'The metals include the alkali and alkaline earths, beryllium, magnesium, copper, silver, gold and the transition metals. These metals exhibit those characteristics generally associated with the metallic state. The B subgroups comprise the remaining metallic elements. These elements exhibit complex structures and significant departures from typically metallic properties. Aluminum, although considered under the B subgroup metals, is somewhat anomolous as it exhibits many characteristics of a true metal.'
The B-subgroup metals show nonmetallic properties; this is particularly apparent in moving from group 12 to group 16. 4‒5; Steele 1966, p. 66 Although the group 11 metals have normal close-packed metallic structuresPhillips & Williams 1965, p. 33 they show an overlap in chemical properties. In their +1 compounds (the stable state for silver; less so for copper)Wiberg, Holleman & Wiberg 2001, pp. 1253, 1268 they are typical B-subgroup metals. In their +2 and +3 states their chemistry is typical of transition metal compounds. 67

Borderline metals

ParishParish 1977, pp. 201–202 writes that, 'as anticipated', the borderline metals of groups 13 and 14 have non-standard structures. Gallium, indium, thallium, germanium, and tin are specifically mentioned in this context. The group 12 metals are also noted as having slightly distorted structures; this has been interpreted as evidence of weak directional (i.e. covalent) bonding.

Chemically weak metals

Rayner-Canham and OvertonRayner-Canham & Overton 2006, p. 29‒30 use the term chemically weak metals to refer to the metals close to the metal-nonmetal borderline. These metals behave chemically more like the metalloids, particularly with respect to anionic species formation. The nine chemically weak metals identified by them are berylllium, aluminium, zinc, gallium, tin, lead, antimony, bismuth, and polonium.

Heavy metals (of low melting point)

Van WertVan Wert 1936, pp. 16, 18 grouped the periodic table metals into a. the light metals; b. the heavy brittle metals of high melting point, c. the heavy ductile metals of high melting point; d. the heavy metals of low melting point (Zn, Cd, Hg; Ga, In, Tl; Ge, Sn; As, Sb, Bi; and Po), and e. the strong, electropositive metals. Britton, Abbatiello and RobinsBritton, Abbatiello & Robins 1972, p. 704 speak of 'the soft, low melting point, heavy metals in columns lIB, IlIA, IVA, and VA of the periodic table, namely Zn, Cd, Hg; Al, Ga, In, Tl; Si, Ge, Sn, Pb; and Bi. The Sargent-Welch Chart of the Elements groups the metals into: light metals, the lanthanide series; the actinide series; heavy metals (brittle); heavy metals (ductile); and heavy metals (low melting point): Zn, Cd, Hg, Cn; Al, Ga, In, Tl; Ge, Sn, Pb, Fl; Sb, Bi; and Po.Sargent-Welch 2008

Less typical metals

HabashiHabashi 2010 groups the elements into eight major categories: 1 typical metals (alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and aluminium); 2 lanthanides (Ce–Lu); 3 actinides (Th–Lr); 4 transition metals (Sc, Y, La, Ac, groups 4–10); 5 less typical metals (groups 11–12, Ga, In, Tl, Sn and Pb); 6 metalloids (B, Si, Ge, As, Se, Sb, Te, Bi and Po); 7 covalent nonmetals (H, C, N, O, P, S and the halogens); and 8 monatomic nonmetals (that is, the noble gases).

Metametals

The metametals are zinc, cadmium, mercury, indium, thallium, tin and lead. They are ductile elements but, compared to their metallic periodic table neighbours to the left, have lower melting points, relatively low electrical and thermal conductivities, and show distortions from close-packed forms. 143 Sometimes berylliumKlemm 1950 and galliumMiller GJ, Lee C & Choe W 2002, p. 22 are included as metametals despite having low ductility.

Ordinary metals

AbrikosovAbrikosov 1988, p. 31 distinguishes between ordinary metals, and transition metals where the inner shells are not filled. The ordinary metals have lower melting points and cohesive energies than those of the transition metals. 514 GrayGray 2009, p. 9 identifies as ordinary metals: aluminium, gallium, indium, thallium, element 113, tin, lead, element 114, bismuth, element 115, and element 116. He adds that, 'in reality most of the metals that people think of as ordinary are in fact transition metals...'.

P-block metals

The p-block metals are the metals in groups 13‒15 (or 16) of the periodic table. Usually, this includes aluminium, gallium, indium and thallium; tin and lead; and bismuth. Germanium, antimony and polonium are sometimes also included, although the first two are commonly recognised as metalloids. The p-block metals tend to have structures that display low coordination numbers and directional bonding. Pronounced covalency is found in their compounds; the majority of their oxides are amphoteric. 178, 189–190, 192–3

Peculiar metals

SlaterSlater 1939, p.&npsb;444‒445 divides the metals 'fairly definitely, though not perfectly sharply' into the ordinary metals and the peculiar metals, the latter of which verge on the nonmetals. The peculiar metals occur towards the ends of the rows of the periodic table and include 'approximately:' gallium, indium, and thallium; carbon, silicon '(both of which have some metallic properties, though we have previously treated them as nonmetals),' germanium and tin; arsenic, antimony, and bismuth; and selenium '(which is partly metallic)' and tellurium. The ordinary metals have centro-symmetrical crystalline structures whereas the peculiar metals have structures involving directional bonding. More recently, Joshua observed that the peculiar metals have mixed metallic-covalent bonding. 45

Poor metals

Farrell and Van SicienFarrell & Van Sicien 2007, p. 1442 use the term poor metal, for simplicity, 'to denote one with a significant covalent, or directional character.' Hill and HolmanHill & Holman 2000, p. 40 observe that, 'The term poor metals is not widely used, but it is a useful description for several metals including tin, lead and bismuth. These metals fall in a triangular block of the periodic table to the right of the transition metals. They are usually low in the activity (electrochemical) series and they have some resemblances to non-metals.' Reid et al. 143 write that 'poor metals' is, 'An older term for metallic elements in Groups 13‒15 of the periodic table that are softer and have lower melting points than the metals traditionally used for tools.'

Post-transition metals

The term post-transition metal is generally used to describe the category of metallic elements in periods 4–6 of the periodic table, to the right of the transition elements. As this description excludes aluminium, a period 3 metal, the post-transition elements thereby form a subset of the other metals. The post-transition metals generally show reduced electropositivity, anionic species formation and a capacity to combine with electropositive metals to give Zintl phases. Compounds of the group 12 metals (zinc, cadmium and mercury) are markedly non-ionic in character, both in structure and properties. Simple cationic chemistry in the group 14 metals, tin and lead, is the exception rather than the norm. 27, 112, 185, 196, 202–3
Which elements are counted as post-transition metals depends, in periodic table terms, on where the transition metals are taken to end. In the 1950s, most inorganic chemistry textbooks defined transition elements as finishing at group 10 (nickel, palladium and platinum), therefore excluding group 11 (copper, silver and gold), and group 12 (zinc, cadmium and mercury). A survey of chemistry books in 2003 showed that the transition metals ended at either group 11 or group 12 with roughly equal frequency.

Semimetals

In modern use, the term 'semimetal' sometimes refers, loosely or explicitly, to metals with incomplete metallic character in crystalline structure, electrical conductivity or electronic structure. Examples include gallium, ytterbium,Johansen & Mackintosh 1970, pp. 121–4; Divakar, Mohan & Singh 1984, p. 2337; Dávila et al. 2002, p. 035411-3 bismuth, mercurySavitsky 1961, p. 107 and neptunium. 434: 'The high values obtained for the electrical resistivity indicate that the metallic properties of neptunium are closer to the semimetals than the true metals. This is also true for other metals in the actinide series.'; Dunlap et al. 1970, pp. 44, 46: '...α-Np is a semimetal, in which covalency effects are believed to also be of importance.....' Metalloids, which are in-between elements that are neither metals nor nonmetals, are also sometimes instead called semimetals. The elements commonly recognised as metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium. In old chemistry, before the publication in 1789 of  Lavoisier's 'revolutionary'Strathern 2000, p. 239 Elementary Treatise on Chemistry,Roscoe & Schormlemmer 1894, p. 4 a semimetal was a metallic element with 'very imperfect ductility and malleability'Murray 1809, p. 300 such as zinc, mercury or bismuth.

Transition metals

Historically, the transition metal series 'includes those elements of the Periodic Table which "bridge the gap" between the very electropositive alkali and allkaline earth metals and the electronegative non-metals of the groups: nitrogen-phosphorus, oxygen-sulfur, and the halogens.'Young et al. 1969, p. 228 Cheronis, Parsons and RonnebergCheronis, Parsons & Ronneberg 1942, p. 570 wrote that, 'The transition metals of low melting point form a block in the Periodic Table: those of Groups II b cadmium, mercury, III b gallium, indium, thallium, and germanium, tin and lead in Group IV. These metals all have melting points below 425 °C.'
