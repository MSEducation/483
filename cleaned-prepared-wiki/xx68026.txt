Golden Gate University (informally referred to as GGU, or simply as Golden Gate) is a private, nonsectarian, coeducational university located in the South of Market district, immediately south of the Financial District of downtown San Francisco, California. Founded in 1901, GGU specializes in educating professionals through its schools of law, business, taxation, and accounting. The University offers two undergraduate degrees with eight concentrations and 15 graduate degrees with 24 concentrations.

History

The university evolved out of the literary reading groups of the San Francisco Central YMCA at a time when, according to one contemporary estimate only one of every two thousand men had a college education.
The night school was renamed the Evening College on October 1, 1896 and became a full-fledged operation in 1901 with the creation of a law school. The law school was the first of the Y's educational departments to offer a full degree-level course, and thus the University traces its founding to the law school's establishment. Courses in Accountancy and Business Administration leading to the degree of Bachelor of Commercial Science began in 1908. Later, courses in foreign trade were added. The YMCA building was destroyed in the fire that followed the 1906 Earthquake. Following the earthquake, the school was conducted out of tents, and later leased space at 1220 Geary St. (now Geary Boulevard near Franklin Street in the Western Addition). In November 1910 the school moved into the YMCA's new building (closed in 2009) at 220 Golden Gate Avenue at Leavenworth Street, also in the Tenderloin.
A student contest resulted in the adoption of the new name Golden Gate. originally suggested by law student Charles H. Pool, Jr. (1895â€“1977) (LLB 1925) because contest judges thought it symbolized "romantic California."
The college continued to share the YMCAs building until June 1968, when it moved into the Allyne Building, a warehouse at 536 Mission Street originally built in 1924 as the showroom and wholesale department of Sherman Clay, a large retailer of pianos, records, record players, and other musical instruments.
In 1972, the College expanded and elevated itself to university status. In 1979, a new "west wing" of the university was completed, where most of the classroom space is located today.

Administration

At its incorporation as a separate institution from the YMCA in 1923, the college governance was divided between a four member (increased to nine members in 1948) Board of Governors, which ran educational program of the college including the conferral of degrees, and a five-member Board of Trustees to hold the college property. The Board of Governors met monthly, while the Board of Trustees only met occasionally when it's approval was required on a matter. Day-to-day operations of the college were handled by a Director of Education. The appointment of the Director, Governors and Trustees were made by the San Francisco YMCA though appointments to the latter two bodies were made on the Director of Education's recommendation. A 1948 reorganization raised the Director of Education to President, the incumbent Director, Nagel T. Miner (since 1931) becoming President. In September 1949 the Board of Governors and Board of Trustees were merged, with all current Trustees retiring, and the members of the Board of Governors being elected onto the Board of Trustees, which had 14 members out of a possible maximum of 21 members.
Presently, the University is managed by a self-sustaining Board of Trustees of between 20 and 47 members. Trustees serve 3-year terms with one third being up for election annually. The President of the University, and the President of the Alumni Association hold voting seats on the Board. Additionally there are four non-voting ex officio members, the President of the Student Government, the President of the Student Bar Association (law school student government); the President of the University Faculty Senate, and the Chair of the Law Faculty. The Trustees are selected from the worlds of business, law, accounting, and philanthropy.
Prominent former Trustees have included Curtis D. Wilbur, U.S. Secretary of the Navy under Calvin Coolidge. John L. McNabb, a former United States Attorney for the Northern District of California; Warren H. Pillsbury, an expert in the federal law of workers compensation (Governor 1923-1949, Trustee 1949-1963); James E. Hammond, a partner with what is now PriceWaterhouse Coopers (Governor 1923-1949, Trustee 1949-1968); George Christopher, a former Mayor of San Francisco; and Caspar Weinberger, an executive with Bechtel and a future U.S. Secretary of Defense.
Day to day operation of the University is in the hands of a President, five Vice-Presidents and the Deans of the four schools (Accounting, Business, Law and Taxation.)
