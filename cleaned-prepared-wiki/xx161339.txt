Recent Inspector's comments (As Earlsheaton Technology College)

Ofsted Inspection 2012

In accordance with section 13 (3) of the Education Act 2005, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector is of the opinion that this school requires special measures because it is failing to give its students an acceptable standard of education and the persons responsible for leading, managing or governing the school are not demonstrating the capacity to secure the necessary improvement. Students attainment has been low for the last three years and they have not made the progress expected taking account of their low starting points. Progress measures for English and mathematics are well below the minimum set in the government floor standard. The 2011 GCSE results showed no overall improvement.ofsted.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/107776
This report has led to the school remaining in special measures until further improvement is made.

Subject Survey Inspection: Design and Technology (D&T) 2010

Teachers have a strong knowledge of materials and health and safety.
Most students are attentive in lessons, particularly in Key Stage 3. Students with special educational needs and/or
disabilities make satisfactory progress to complete focused practical tasks. Curriculum enrichment through food challenge competitions and special events such as 'drop down days' are beginning to provide a positive image of technology and are appreciated by students. The senior leadership team is determined to improve the quality of D&T experience for students and has begun to remove barriers to their achievement. The school is adopting a firm approach to tackle poor achievement. Monitoring systems identify students who are underperforming in Years 10 and 11 and intervention measures are in place to support them in catching up on coursework.ofsted.uk/oxedu_reports/download/(id)/120760/(as)/107776_346545.pdf

Building schools for the future programme

On 5 July 2010, education secretary Michael Gove announced the new government was axing Labours Building schools for the future programme which would have meant Earlsheaton (Now Manor Croft Academy) being dramatically modernised and extended to improve facilities and increase capacity to accommodate more pupils with the ultimate aim of improving the quality of education at Earlsheaton, however although most were in favour of the expansion project many parents believed that the expansion would have negative consequences for the school and community. The decision to stop planned work at Earlsheaton which was due to begin in 2011 came as a result of the new government making dramatic spending cuts across the public sector. Expansion and modernisation of the school will now not go ahead for the foreseeable future.
Ex-Headteacher Paul Levy commented on the governments decision saying; "These cuts will deny a modern education to generations of pupils. At the moment 40 per cent of our pupils achieve five A* to C GCSEs, including English and maths, and this represents a significant achievement. But we would have anticipated a rise in standards if we had got the new facilities."
