History

One of the first Serbian immigrants to the United States was the settler George Fisher, who arrived in Philadelphia in 1815 and later fought in the Texan Revolution. In the 1830s, many Serb sailors and fishermen from Montenegro and Herzegovina immigrated to New Orleans seeking employment. Other Serbs settled in Alabama and Mississippi, as well as California, where they joined the Gold Rush.
During World War I, as many as 15,000 Serbian American volunteers returned to the Balkans to fight for the Allied cause in their homeland. Serbs in the United States who did not volunteer to fight marched for the creation of Yugoslavia, sent aid to the Balkans through the Red Cross, formed a Serbian Relief Committee, and urged notable Americans to support the Serbian cause. Distinguished Serbian American scientist Mihajlo Pupin, a friend of US President Woodrow Wilson, led the Serbian National Defence (SND), a Serbian American organization which collected money and attempted to influence American public opinion with regard to the Balkans.
After World War II many Serbs immigrated to the United States from Yugoslavia after the country came under the authoritarian rule of Communist leader Josip Broz Tito.

Demographics

Officially there were 187,739 Serbs living in the United States in 2010. However, this number may be much higher as there are some 328,547 people who identify as Yugoslavs living in the United States.
