History

AirAsia was established in 1994 and began operations on 18 November 1996. It was originally founded by a government-owned conglomerate, DRB-Hicom. On 2 December 2001, the heavily-indebted airline was bought by former Time Warner executive Tony Fernandes' company Tune Air Sdn Bhd for the token sum of one ringgit (about USD 0.26 at the time) with USD 11 million (MYR 40 million) worth of debts. Fernandes turned the company around, producing a profit in 2002 and launching new routes from its hub in Kuala Lumpur, undercutting former monopoly operator Malaysia Airlines with promotional fares as low as MYR 1 (US$0.27). In 2003, AirAsia opened a second hub at Senai International Airport in Johor Bahru near Singapore and launched its first international flight to Bangkok.
AirAsia has since started a Thai subsidiary, added Singapore itself to the destination list, and started flights to Indonesia. Flights to Macau began in June 2004, and flights to mainland China (Xiamen) and the Philippines (Manila) in April 2005. Flights to Vietnam and Cambodia followed later in 2005 and to Brunei and Myanmar in 2006, the latter by Thai AirAsia. In August 2006, AirAsia took over Malaysia Airlines's Rural Air Service routes in Sabah and Sarawak, operating under the FlyAsianXpress brand. The routes were subsequently returned to MASwings a year later, citing commercial reasons.
At the end of 2006, Fernandes unveiled a five-year plan to further enhance AirAsia's presence in Asia.
On 27 September 2008, the company announced 106 new routes to be added to its then-current list of 60. The number of old routes discontinued has not been publicly disclosed.
In August 2011, AirAsia agreed to form an alliance with Malaysia Airlines by means of a share swap. The alliance was struck down by the Malaysian government, in effect voiding the agreement of both airlines.
By early 2013, AirAsia saw a steep increase in its profitability. The year-over-year comparison had shown a 168% increase in profits versus the same period in 2012. For the quarter ending 31 December 2012, the airline's net profit stood at 350.65 million ringgit (US$114.08 million). Despite a 1% rise in the average fuel price, the airline recorded profits of 1.88 billion ringgit for its full 2012 fiscal year.
In February 2013, AirAsia submitted an application to the Indian Foreign Investment Promotion Board, through its investment arm, AirAsia Investment Limited, to seek approval for commencing its operations in India.

AirAsia India

The origins of the airline can be tracked back to October 2012, when the airline's management said that they were keen to have more presence in India if the aviation environment and tax structure were conducive and friendly for low-cost airline operations.

He said that it was now easier for him to set up an airline in India.

Low On Time Performance

There are many criticisms towards Air Asia related to the frequency of delayed flights. Based on measurements performed by an international agency of airline statistics, Air Asia On Time Performance (OTP) is below 80% and in some subsidiaries as low as 69%.

Criticism Of Uniforms

On 9 July 2013, Malaysia's transport ministry asked the airline to "reassess the uniforms to better reflect the Malaysian culture," and also noted that it would "reassess" the airline's license. The issue surfaced after Ikmal Hisham Abdul Aziz, a member of parliament of the United Malays National Organisation made a parliamentary request stating that the uniforms "did not reflect the national identity". The problem appeared to be tight skirts that end slightly above the knee and contoured jackets over white blouses.
