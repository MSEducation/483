The Battle of Traigh Ghruinneart or in Scottish Gaelic Blàr Tràigh Ghruineart or sometimes called the Battle of Gruinart Strand was a Scottish clan battle fought on 5 August 1598, on the Isle of Islay, in the Scottish Highlands. It was fought between the Clan Donald and Clan Maclean.  A tràigh or stand is the flat area of land bordering a body of water, a beach, or shoreline.

History

The Isle of Islay had belonged to Clan MacDonald. The clan chief was Sir James MacDonald, 9th of Dunnyveg, nephew of Sir Lachlan Mor Maclean. Maclean demanded that the island belonged to his clan.
After assembling his forces of about 800 to 1,000 men, Sir Lachlan Mor Maclean landed at Loch Ghruinneart. James being reasonable peacefully offered his uncle half of the island for the MacLeans to own for Lauchlan's lifetime only. MacLean refused all offers of peace unless his nephew gave him the entire Island. Allies to the Clan MacDonald sent men from Kintyre and Arran, including members of Clan MacAlister, which were led by Angus MhicMhuirich of Arran. 
James MacDonald had fewer troops available but they were well trained. His forces feigned retreat toward the setting sun then turned around to fight with the sun in the eyes of their enemy. The MacDonalds were victorious and the MacLeans were defeated.
A dwarf named Dubh Sith (Black Fairy) was hidden in a tree and he killed Sir Lachlan Mor Maclean with a shot through his eye after he had removed his helmet.
With Sir Lachlan Mor Maclean and about 280 of his men killed in battle, the rest were chased to their boats and some sought refuge in the chapel of Kilnave. The chapel was burnt down, killing all but one of the men inside. 
Sir James MacDonald was seriously wounded after being shot through the body with an arrow. He was found after the battle amongst the dead MacDonalds, which also included Angus MhicMhuirich of Arran. About 30 MacDonalds were slain and 60 wounded.
Afterwards James VI and I, the King of Scotland, awarded MacDonald lands to Clan Campbell, leading to an extension of the feud. 
Clan MacDonald's reign in Islay came to an end in 1612 when Angus MacDonald, 8th of Dunnyveg, sold his land holdings to Sir John Campbell of Cawdor of Clan Campbell of Cawdor.
