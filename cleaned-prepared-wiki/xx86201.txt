[[Vers libre]]

CATEGORIES: Poetic form

Vers libre  is an open form of poetry that abandons consistent meter patterns, rhyme, or other forms of musical pattern. It thus tends to follow the rhythm of natural speech.

Form and structure

The unit of vers libre is not the foot,  the number of the syllables,  the quantity,  or the,line. The unit is the strophe,  which may be the whole poem,  or only a part. Each strophe is a complete circle.Lowell, Amy, Preface, Sword Blades and Poppy Seed;  North American Review for January, 1917 Unrhymed cadence in vers libre is built upon 'organic rhythm,' or the rhythm of the speaking voice with its necessity for breathing, rather than upon a strict metrical system.de Souza Robert, Du Rythme en Francais, Welter, Paris 1912 Vers libre is liberated from traditional rules concerning metre, caesura and line end stopping,Kahn, Gustave, Le Vers libre, Paris, 1923 ASIN: B008XZTTY2 every syllable pronounced is of nearly equal value but is less strongly accented than in English, being less intense requires less disciple to mold the accents into the poem's rhythm.Hulme, T. E., Lecture on Modern Poetry, Kensington Town Hall 1914
