The school's main building is arranged in an "L" shape consisting of 3 main hallway pods and 2 smaller hallways at either end.  Each of the three main pods have two floors with classrooms on either end of a diamond shaped hallway.  The second floor of each pod opens in the center to reveal the first floor.  Additional classrooms have been added to the main building by filling in the space in the center on the first floor of each pod.
Like the other high schools in the Socorro Independent School District, there is not a stadium located on campus. Track/swim meets and football/soccer games are played at the SISD Student Activities Complex. A grass field is located on campus for freshmen football games and as a parade field for the NJROTC.

Additionally, the team from 2009 finished State Runner-Up in Dallas, Texas after losing to Skyline Academy by one point on three different ballots in the championship round.  The 2010 team finished 12th in Texas. In 2011 the Americas Mock Trial Team became the first ever El Paso Mock Trial team to capture the state title, in addition to becoming the first Americas team (in any capacity) to win a state championship.

NJROTC

-Armed Drill Team
Participates in precision marching competitions carrying a rifle.  Although the majority of the members have been historically male, the first female member took command of the team in 2002.  Since then the team has had at least one other female commander and several other female competitors.
-Unarmed Drill Team
Participates in an unarmed variant of the precision marching competitions done by the armed drill team.  This team historically consists of female members until the first male member took command in 2004.
-Academic Team
The academic team competes in drill meets by completing a multiple choice style exam consisting of questions based on naval science.
-Rifle Team
The rifle team competes by shooting targets in various positions with an air powered pellet gun.
-Sword Team
The sword team is a non-competitive team that is employed to honor VIP's both inside and outside of school related events.  The team traditionally consists of eight primary members.  Two squads are formed consisting of four members each arranged in order of heights, shortest in the front and tallest in the back.  The commander assumes a position within the two squads.  For events where the team must escort a female, the eight primary members are male cadets and two female cadets are attached to the team as assistants.
The team starts each event by marching in and then turning in so that the two squads face each other.  The commander gives the command to arch swords, and the team executes by pointing the swords up in the air at a 45 degree angle.  After a VIP passes by a member of the team, their sword is slowly lowered and then replaced on the cadet's shoulder.  For female escorted events, the primary members will trade out their swords for roses after all the VIP's have passed through the arches.  This switch is completed by the two assisting members.  The female to be escorted is presented with a rose by the first member and is passed on to the next cadet who presents the female with his rose.  The ceremony concludes after all the roses have been given out.
-Color Guard
The Color Guard team is both competitive and ceremonial.  The team competes with a minimum of four members, but with as many as six in some instances.  Two of the members hold rifles instead of flags and stand at either end of the squad.  During a home football game in 2004, four members from the sword team were attached to the color guard to uncase the colors before a performance.  There has traditionally been four separate color guard teams that take turns performing at home football, basketball, volleyball, and softball games.
-Admin
The cadets assigned to handle the administrative functions of the battalion are said to work in the Admin section.  The cadets in this section are responsible for keeping cadet records and publishing awards and promotions.
-Supply
This section is responsible for issuing uniform items to incoming cadets and replacing unserviceable items from veteran cadets.
-Staff
The battalion staff functions similar to a board of directors in a corporation.  The commanders from each element as well as all the department heads convene once a week with the BCO, BXO, and CMC.
-Chief's Mess
The Chief's Mess was established at Americas High School by retired Navy CPO Ramos, who was the NSI at the time.  The organization brought together all of the cadets that had attained the cadet rank of c/CPO, c/SCPO, or c/MCPO.
-A/B Company
"Alpha" and "Bravo" Companies are the two main bodies of the battalion and consists of cadets that are not members of the drill teams.  Company A consists of cadets that attend their Naval Science class on odd days and Company B consists of cadets that attend their Naval Science class on even days.  Each company is broken into three platoons.  The six platoons compete annually for the "Bravo Zulu" award that is given during the AMI.
-C Company
"Charlie" Company consists of only members from any one of the drill teams.
