South Carolina Highway 170 (SC 170) is a  state highway, connecting northern Beaufort County with southern portions of Beaufort and Jasper counties.  Due to increased population growth in both areas, the majority of the road is four lanes wide, with certain areas retaining the original two lane configuration.

Route description

The route travels generally in a northeast to southwest direction, beginning in Beaufort and ending at the Georgia state line at the Savannah River, where it continues as Georgia State Route 25 into Port Wentworth.
Beginning in Beaufort at an angular intersection with US 21 Business, the road is known as Robert Smalls Parkway for approximately five miles as it travels in a southwesterly direction across Port Royal Island.  After intersecting with US 21 and SC 128, SC 170 crosses the Broad River over a  four-lane bridge built in 2004, replacing a previous 2-lane drawbridge.  The route crosses Lemon Island and surrounding marshes before crossing over the smaller Chechesee River and enters the southern portion of Beaufort County.  This particular stretch is quite scenic, with panoramas of marshes and surrounding islands extending for miles.
Shortly after the intersection with Snake Road and Callawassie Island's entrance road, the route crosses briefly into Jasper County before running exactly along the boundary between Beaufort and Jasper County for approximately eight miles.  The route is mostly rural, though new commercial and light industrial development has begun to appear along the Jasper County side of the road.
The route crosses fully into Beaufort County and passes under US 278 at an intersection known locally as McGarvey's Corner and shortly after that intersection is reduced from four to two lanes.  It skirts the eastern edge of the Sun City Hilton Head development before intersecting with Bluffton Parkway, which provides direct access to Bluffton.  It continues for another two miles (3 km) before reaching SC 46 at a traffic circle.
SC 170 and SC 46 are co-signed for approximately three miles as they cross into Jasper County before splitting at an intersection five miles (8 km) southeast of downtown Hardeeville.  Shortly past that intersection, SC 315 (formerly SC 170 Alternate) splits from the road by continuing straight while SC 170 makes a right onto Freedom Parkway.  SC 170 continues along the extent of the road before intersecting with US 17 in the unincorporated Limehouse community.
US 17 and SC 170 are co-signed for approximately two miles on a four lane, divided highway configuration.  The highways split after passing by a former truck weigh station, with US 17 continuing to Savannah and SC 170 heading into the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge.  The route emerges from a densely wooded area and crosses nearly two miles of marshes before reaching the Savannah River and the Georgia state line.  The road continues onward to Port Wentworth as Georgia State Route 25.

History

Established around 1931 as a new primary routing from US 17 (today Levy Road S-27-34) to SC 33 (today SC 46).  In 1939, it was extended north to where US 278 exists today.  In 1940, it was extended north again to SC 368, near Coosawhatchie; and again by 1942 to US 17 in Coosawhatchie.  In 1995, SC 170 was extended south into Georgia, replacing of mainline US 17. 

Major intersections

Bannered routes

Levy alternate route

Established around 1972 as a new primary routing from US 17 Alt to SC 170; an upgrade to secondary road S-27-117 (built in the late 1950s) and part of S-27-92 (Belinger Hill Road).  Its existence created a rare alternate spur, but provided a more direct routing between Bluffton and Savannah.  In 2010, it was renumbered as SC 315.
