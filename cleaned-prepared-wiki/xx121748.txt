History

There is some evidence of an Iron Age settlement on top of nearby Burton Moor that has been designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It consists of about eighteen hut circles and defined fields.
The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as just Burton. At the time of the Norman invasion the village was part of the manor belonging to Thorkil, but afterwards the manor was granted to Geoffrey of Swaffham by Count Alan of Brittany, who had been awarded the lands by the Crown.
The topynomy of the village is derived from the Old English burh-tÅ«n meaning a fortified farm. The village used to be an important market town and the octagonal market cross and stocks are still seen today on the village green.
