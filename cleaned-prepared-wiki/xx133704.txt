A joint base

Camp Taji is now known as one of many United States camps that also house members of the new Iraqi Army and the Iraqi National Guard. It is also being used to train the newly established Iraqi Air Force. Camp Taji is broken up between two Camps that are joined by a joint Iraqi/US gate. The Iraqi side, called Camp Bennet, is where the Iraqi troops, as well as the Transition Teams live. There is great controversy over the fact that the camp is divided, between "US and them". Much has been written on the subject, but with a simple look at the two camps one can see that there is a great difference in the quality of life on the two sides of the camp.Gregg Jaffe- A Camp Divided - Wall Street Journal
