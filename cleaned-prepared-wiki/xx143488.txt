Route description

Lancaster County

PA 743 begins at PA 441 near Marietta in East Donegal Township, Lancaster County, heading northwest on two-lane undivided Maytown Road. The road passes a mix of farms and residential subdivisions as it comes to the community of Maytown. After passing through Maytown, the route continues north through open farmland with a few homes, crossing into West Donegal Township. PA 743 makes a turn northeast prior to curving northwest. The road heads northeast and enters Elizabethtown, coming to a bridge over Amtrak's Philadelphia to Harrisburg Main Line. A short distance later, PA 743 comes to an intersection with PA 230 and forms a concurrency with that route by turning northwest onto South Market Street. The road, which contains a center left-turn lane, passes several homes prior to entering the downtown area of Elizabethtown and intersecting PA 241, at which point that route joins PA 230 and PA 743 on North Market Street. The road leaves the downtown and enters residential areas, with PA 241 and PA 743 splitting from PA 230 by briefly heading northeast on Linden Avenue. PA 241 and PA 743 turn north onto North Hanover Street a short distance later, passing a mix of homes and businesses as it crosses into Mount Joy Township and becomes Hershey Road. PA 241 splits from PA 743 by heading northeast onto Mt. Gretna Road, and PA 743 heads north-northeast to an interchange with PA 283. Within the area of the interchange, the road is briefly a divided highway. At this point, the route becomes concurrent with PA 341 Truck and heads into areas of farms and woods as an undivided road.   

Dauphin County

Upon crossing the Conewago Creek, PA 743 enters Conewago Township in Dauphin County, continuing north-northwest past farmland, woodland, and a few homes. The road passes under the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76) without an interchange before reaching the PA 341 intersection, at which point the PA 341 Truck overlap ends.

The route turns northwest and passes residential neighborhoods as it enters the community of Hershey. PA 743 turns north onto Cocoa Avenue and passes between businesses to the west and farms to the east as it reaches the US 322 intersection. From this point, Cocoa Avenue continues through residential areas prior to intersecting US 422 (Chocolate Avenue) in the downtown area of Hershey. In late 2012, the intersection of US 422 and PA 743 was redesigned so that PA 743 traffic can continue straight past the Hershey Press Building and onto Park Avenue.  The famous street sign showing the intersection of Chocolate and Cocoa remains in its original location.  The road comes to a bridge over Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line before running between Hersheypark to the west and ZOOAMERICA to the east.

At this point, PA 743 turns east onto Hersheypark Drive, which is a four-lane road. The route passes between facilities owned by The Hershey Company and Tanger Outlets Hershey to the south before heading northeast to Laudermilch Road. Here, PA 743 turns north onto two-lane Laudermilch Road and enters agricultural areas. The road turns north and crosses the Swatara Creek into East Hanover Township.

The PA 743 designation officially ends at the US 22 intersection according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation but some signage and mapping websites show it continuing north on Laudermilch and Bow Creek Road.
Laudermilch Road runs north from this intersection as state-maintained SR 2025 for  At this intersection, the road name becomes township-maintained Bow Creek Road and continues northwest to I-81's exit 80.
