Current President and CEO Richard Miller lead the merger. www.org/aboutus  Miller instituted the philosophies and values currently used by the company. He also adopted the widely used business strategy known as Six Sigma, making Virtua one of the first healthcare systems to use its problem-solving techniques.com Virtua's stated philosophy is to provide the best patient experience through its STAR initiative. Through STAR, they attempt to practice quality health care and outstanding medical service.Dr. H. James Harrington, Dr. Brett E. Trusko, Carolyn Pexton, and Praveen Gupta.

The STAR Initiative

STAR launched in 2000, two years after the conception of Virtua. The idea behind the initiative was to provide employees with a framework to carry out the company's philosophy: providing an "outstanding patient experience." There are five ideas to support the philosophy, each represented by one point on the star. The five points are Excellent Service, Caring Culture, Best People, Resource Stewardship and Highest Clinical Quality and Safety.Health Care Conference Administrators, LLC
