Discovery and modeling career

Dahl first formed an ambition to become a model as a teenager.  She decided to travel to France to achieve this, but the plan was scuppered by her parents who wished for her to become a secretary instead.  The differing opinion caused Dahl to fall out briefly with her mother. Dahl made her modelling debut on the catwalk of Lainey Keogh's first major show, in London Fashion Week for Autumn 1997. Keogh had asked various personal friends, including Dahl, to model for the show, alongside established models such as Naomi Campbell and Helena Christensen. This led to Dahl being discovered by Isabella Blow, then a Vogue stylist, who introduced her to Sarah Doukas of the Storm Model Agency in London. Under their management, Dahl appeared in campaigns for Versace, Alexander McQueen, Patrick Cox, Pringle, and Gap, among others."Sophie Dahl makes modelling comeback", The Sydney Morning Herald (online edition), 19 July 2012, accessed 26 November 2013.
