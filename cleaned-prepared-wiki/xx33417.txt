Garret Augustus Hobart (June 3, 1844 – November 21, 1899) was the 24th Vice President of the United States (1897–1899), serving under President William McKinley.  He was the sixth American vice president to die in office.
Hobart was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, on the Jersey Shore, and grew up in nearby Marlboro.  After attending Rutgers College, Hobart read law with prominent Paterson attorney Socrates Tuttle.  Hobart both studied with Tuttle, and married his daughter.  Although he rarely set foot in a courtroom, Hobart became wealthy as a corporate lawyer.
Hobart served in local governmental positions, and then successfully ran for office as a Republican, serving in both the New Jersey General Assembly and the New Jersey Senate.  He became Speaker of the first, and president of the latter.  Hobart was a longtime party official, and New Jersey delegates went to the 1896 Republican National Convention determined to nominate the popular lawyer for vice president.  Hobart's political views were similar to those of McKinley, who was the presumptive Republican presidential candidate. With New Jersey a key state in the upcoming election, McKinley and his close adviser, future senator Mark Hanna, decided to have the convention select Hobart.  The vice-presidential candidate emulated his running mate with a front porch campaign, though spending much time at the campaign's New York City office.  McKinley and Hobart were elected.
As vice president, Hobart proved a popular figure in Washington and was a close adviser to McKinley.  Hobart's tact and good humor were valuable to the President, as in mid-1899 when Secretary of War Russell Alger failed to understand that McKinley wanted him to leave office.  Hobart invited Alger to his New Jersey summer home, and broke the news to the secretary, who submitted his resignation to McKinley on his return to Washington.  Hobart died in November 1899 of heart disease at age 55; his place on the Republican ticket in 1900 was taken by New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt.

Early life

Garret Augustus Hobart was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, to Addison Willard Hobart and the former Sophia Vanderveer.  Addison Hobart descended from the early colonial settlers of New England; many Hobarts served as pastors.  Addison Hobart came to New Jersey to teach at a school in Marlboro.  His mother was descended from 17th-century Dutch settlers in New Amsterdam (today New York City) who had moved to Long Island and then to New Jersey.
Garret initially attended his father's school in Long Branch.

Lawyer and part-time politician

After graduation from Rutgers, Hobart worked briefly as a teacher to repay loans.
In addition to learning law from Tuttle, Hobart fell in love with his daughter.  Jennie Tuttle Hobart remembered, "When this attractive young law student appeared in our home I, then a young girl in my teens, unexpectedly played a rôle of importance by losing my heart to him".
Socrates Tuttle was influential in Paterson, which worked to Hobart's advantage.  According to Michael J. Connolly in his 2010 article about Hobart, the future vice president "benefitted greatly from Tuttle's beneficence".
In 1872, Hobart ran as a Republican for the New Jersey General Assembly from Passaic County's third legislative district.  He was easily elected, taking nearly two-thirds of the vote.  The General Assembly was then elected annually and he was successful in winning re-election the following year, although his margin of victory was cut in half.
Hobart said of his involvement in public affairs, "I make politics my recreation."
One reason for Hobart's success in both the private and public sectors was his genial personality.  He worked well with others, and was noted for tact and charm.  Senator Mark Hatfield, in his book on American vice presidents, suggests that these qualities would have made Hobart successful in Washington had he run for Congress.  Hatfield states that the reason why Hobart chose not to move from state to national politics before 1896 was a reluctance to leave a comfortable life and successful law practice in Paterson.

Election of 1896

Selection as candidate

Jennie Hobart, in her memoirs, traced her suspicions that her husband might be a vice-presidential contender to a lunch she had with him at the Waldorf Hotel in New York in March 1895.  During the meal, industrialist and future senator Mark Hanna interrupted them to ask what Garret Hobart thought of the possible presidential candidacy of Ohio Governor William McKinley—Hanna was one of McKinley's principal backers.  Garret Hobart evaded the question, but Jennie Hobart believed the conversation to have been the first of a chain of events which elevated her husband to national office.
In November 1895, Republican John Griggs was elected governor of New Jersey; his campaign was managed by Hobart.  The election of New Jersey's first Republican governor since the 1860s led to speculation in the newspapers that Hobart would be a candidate for vice president.  New Jersey Republicans were anxious to nominate Hobart, both to see one of their own possibly elevated to national office, and in the hope that having Hobart on the national ticket would boost the Republican vote in New Jersey.  Hobart was an attractive candidate as he was from a swing state, and the Griggs victory showed that Republicans could hope to win New Jersey's electoral votes, which they had not done since 1872.  Another reason for a Hobart selection was his wealth; he could be expected to spend abundantly on his own campaign.
According to Hanna biographer Herbert Croly, Hobart, an early supporter of McKinley, helped ensure New Jersey's support for him at the Republican convention.  Croly asserted that McKinley and Hanna desired an easterner on the ticket to balance it and boost support in the Mid-Atlantic region.  The conventional means of assuring this was to nominate a politician from New York, then the largest state in population.  As many New York delegates supported their favorite son candidate, Governor (and former vice president) Levi P. Morton, instead of McKinley, giving the state the vice-presidential nomination would be an unmerited reward.  According to Croly,

McKinley was nominated for president on the first ballot.  Hobart described his subsequent first-ballot nomination for vice president as a tribute from his friends, but Hatfield noted, "it came equally as a tribute from who wanted a ticket to satisfy the business interests of America, and Hobart, a corporate lawyer, fit that requirement perfectly".
According to historian R. Hal Williams, the Republicans left St. Louis in June with "a popular, experienced presidential candidate, a respected vice-presidential nominee, and an attractive platform".

Campaign

The Panic of 1893 had led to hard times in the United States, and the effects were still felt in 1896.  One proposal to cure the economic malaise was "Free Silver"; that the government would accept silver bullion and return it to the depositor, struck into silver dollars.  At the time, the silver in a dollar coin was worth $.53.  Implementation of the proposals would increase the money supply and cause difficulties in international trade with nations that remained on the gold standard.  Proponents argued that the increased money supply would stimulate the economy.  President Grover Cleveland was firmly for the gold standard, a stance which bitterly divided the Democratic Party.  Most Republicans were for the gold standard, though some, mostly from the West, were "Silver Republicans".
Hobart was a strong supporter of the gold standard; and insisted on it remaining a major part of the Republican campaign even in the face of Bryan's surge.  In his speech responding to the formal notification of his convention victory, Hobart stated, "An honest dollar, worth 100 cents everywhere, cannot be coined out of 53 cents worth of silver plus a legislative fiat. Such a debasement of our currency would inevitably produce incalculable loss, appalling disaster, and National dishonor."
Together with Pennsylvania Senator Matthew Quay, Hobart ran the McKinley campaign's New York office, often making the short journey from Paterson for strategy meetings.  The vice-presidential candidate emulated McKinley in giving speeches from his front porch; unlike McKinley he also addressed rallies.  In October, he made a short tour of New Jersey to campaign, expressing relief to his wife when it came to a close.  On November 3, 1896, the voters cast their ballots in most states; a nervous Hobart spent the day at his office.  Special telegraph wires had been attached to his home; at 8:30 in the evening they conveyed the news to him that McKinley and Hobart had won.  The Republican ticket won New Jersey, together with the entire Northeast.  The following week, Vice President-elect Hobart attended Rutgers' 130th anniversary celebrations as guest of honor.  The member of the Class of 1863 was now Rutgers' most prominent graduate.

Vice President (1897–1899)

Hobart spent much of the four months between election and inauguration reading about the vice presidency, preparing for the move, and winding down some business affairs.  He did not, however, resign from the boards of corporations which would not have business before the federal government.  "It would be highly ridiculous for me to resign from the different companies in which I am officer and a stockholder whose interests are not in the least affected, or likely to be, by my position as Vice President."

Presidential advisor

Upon moving to Washington, the Hobarts established themselves at the Arlington Hotel, which was the Washington home to many political men of the era, including Hanna.  Soon, however, Pennsylvania Senator Don Cameron offered them the lease of the house he owned at 21 Lafayette Square, diagonally across Pennsylvania Avenue from the Executive Mansion (as the White House was still formally known).  The asking price was $10,000 per year; the Vice President bargained Cameron down to $8,000 (equal to the vice presidential salary) by suggesting that the public might assume he stole the excess.
The President and Vice President were already friends from the campaign; after the inauguration, a close relationship grew between the two men, and their wives.  The First Lady, Ida McKinley, had health issues, and could not stand the strain of the required official entertaining.  Jennie Hobart often substituted for the First Lady at receptions and other events, and also was a close companion, visiting her daily.  The Hobarts and McKinleys visited each other's home without formality; according to Jennie Hobart, writing in 1930, "it was an intimate friendliness that no Vice President and his wife, before or since, have had the privilege of sharing with their chief administrator."
The vice president had in recent administrations been considered a relatively low-level political functionary, whose activities were generally limited to the constitutional function of presiding over the Senate.  Hobart, however, became a close adviser to McKinley and his Cabinet members, although he was not called upon to attend Cabinet meetings.  Reporter Arthur Wallace Dunn wrote of Hobart in 1922, "for the first time in my recollection, and the last for that matter, the Vice President was recognized as somebody, as a part of the Administration, and as a part of the body over which he presided".
Through late 1897 and early 1898, many Americans called for the United States to intervene in Cuba, then a Spanish colony revolting against the mother country.  These calls greatly increased in February 1898, when the American battleship  Maine sank in Havana harbor after an explosion.  McKinley sought delay, hoping to settle the disputes peacefully, but in April 1898, Hobart told the President that the Senate would act against Spain whether McKinley liked it or not.  McKinley gave in; Congress declared war on April 25, beginning the Spanish-American War, and Hobart sent McKinley a pen with which to sign the declaration.

"Assistant President"

Hobart was more assertive as Senate president than his predecessors had been.  It was customary for the vice president not to rule on disputed points, but to submit them to a vote.  Hobart, with his experience as a presiding officer in the New Jersey Legislature, took a more assertive role, ruling on disputes, and trying to expedite legislation.
Hobart was constant in his attendance at the Senate; one onlooker called him a "chronic audience".
One post which Hobart refused to relinquish upon his inauguration was his position as one of three Joint Traffic Association (JTA) arbiters.  The association was a group of railroads which sought to coordinate rates; if two railroads applied rates in different ways, the matter was settled by Hobart and two other arbiters.  Hobart heard appeals while vice president.

Illness and death

By late 1898, Hobart had fallen ill with a serious heart ailment, which he at first concealed from the public.  He continued Senate duty, but nearly collapsed after delivering an address closing the session.  He accompanied the President on a vacation trip to Hanna's winter home in Thomasville, Georgia, but quickly contracted the flu and returned to Washington.  By April 1899, Hobart's illness was well known in the press, though Hanna assured the newspapers that Hobart would be on the ticket in 1900:  "nothing but death or an earthquake can stop the re-nomination of Vice President Hobart".
Despite his vice president's ill-health, McKinley called upon him to break the news to Secretary of War Russell Alger that McKinley wanted him to resign—the secretary had ignored or misunderstood repeated hints from the President.
After a vacation with the McKinleys on Lake Champlain, Hobart returned to Paterson in September.  On November 1, 1899, the government announced that Hobart would not return to public life.  His condition deteriorated rapidly, and he died on November 21, 1899 at age 55.
New Jersey Governor Foster Voorhees ordered that state buildings be draped in mourning for 30 days, and that flags be flown at half staff until Hobart's funeral.

Legacy

Hobart significantly expanded the powers of the vice presidency, becoming a presidential adviser, and taking a leadership role as president of the Senate.
A statue of Hobart, erected in 1903, stands outside Paterson's city hall.  Connolly finds Hobart to be very much a man of his times:
