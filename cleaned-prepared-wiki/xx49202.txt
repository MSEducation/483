History

Early history

8th century BC bird-shaped fibulae were found in the town.uv.PDF
The first historical record mentioning the town is from 1153 book of "Idrisia" when it was a mercantile harbour. The city was populated by Serbs and was administered by the Bulgarian Empire in the 9th and 11th century and later by the Kingdom of Hungary, until the 16th century, when it became part of the Ottoman Empire. During the Ottoman rule, the city was part of the Ottoman Province of Temeşvar and was a large settlement mostly populated by ethnic Serbs.

Habsburg Monarchy

After 1716, the city was under Habsburg rule, and was included into Habsburg military province named Banat of Temeswar. In 1751, the northern parts of the province were placed under civil administration, while the southern parts (including Pančevo) were included into Military Frontier (Banat Krajina). During this time the Habsburg administration encouraged massive immigration of German settlers to develop the land. Soon the town of Pančevo was divided into two municipalities: one Serb, one "German". According to the 1767 data, the population of the Serb municipality numbered 424 families, while the population of the German municipality numbered 132 families. According to the 1787 data, the population of the city was composed of 3,506 Orthodox Christians and 2,005 Roman Catholics. The city was briefly restored to Ottoman administration from 1787 to 1788. In 1794, Serb and German municipality were joined into one.

In 1848/1849, Pančevo was part of the Serbian Voivodship, a Serb autonomous region within Austrian Empire, but in 1849 it was returned under administration of the Military Frontier. In 1873, the Banatian Military Frontier was abolished and the city was included into Torontal county. According to the 1910 census, the population of the city was 20,808, of whom 8,714 spoke Serbian language, 7,467, German language, 3,364 Hungarian language, etc.

After 1918

In 1918, Pančevo (with the rest of western Banat) became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). According to the 1921 data, the population of the city was 19,362, of whom 9,422 were Serbs, 7,237 Germans, 887 Hungarians, etc. Between 1918 and 1922, the city was part of the Banat county, between 1922 and 1929 it was part of the Belgrade oblast, and between 1929 and 1941 it was part of the Belgrade city administration.
In April 1941, Pančevo was occupied as part of the invasion of Yugoslavia by Nazi Germany. Soldiers of the Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland committed a war crime in the town cemetery when 35 men and one woman were executed as a reprisal for the deaths of four German soldiers. Propaganda photos and film of the executions were used decades after the event to help chronicle the Wehrmacht's complicity in German atrocities during the war.Jürgen Martschukat, Violence and Visibility in Modern History, p.182 accessed online at 
Between 1941 and 1944, Pančevo was under Axis occupation and was part of the autonomous Banat within German-occupied Serbia. Many local Danube Swabians were enlisted in the Waffen-SS after failing to volunteer in sufficient numbers.
During 1999 the city was heavily bombed by NATO forces. Targets included an oil refinery, the Utva aircraft factory and chemical plants.
