Victoria Square is located in central Christchurch, New Zealand. Originally known as Market Place or Market Square, it was the site of market days, fairs, and trade before its redevelopment in 1896–1897 into a park. Its notable landmarks include the Captain James Cook statue, Queen Victoria statue, H. L. Bowker Fountain, and the Victoria Square Poupou.

Between 1000 and 1500, the area belonged to Puari, a settlement of the Waitaha people, an early Māori iwi (tribe or nation); it is thought that at its peak, the settlement or pā accommodated about 800 people.

Description

Its notable landmarks include the Captain James Cook statue, the statue of Queen Victoria, H. L. Bowker Fountain, and the Victoria Square Poupou.
