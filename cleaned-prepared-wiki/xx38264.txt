History

Formation and early days

The Bloodhound Gang began as a small alternative band called Bang Chamber 8. It consisted of  James Moyer Franks ("Jimmy Pop") and Michael Bowe ("Daddy Long Legs"), both graduates of Perkiomen Valley High School. They released an eponymous tape before changing their name to the Bloodhound Gang, a reference to "The Bloodhound Gang", a segment on the 1980s PBS kids' show 3-2-1 Contact that featured three young detectives solving mysteries and fighting crime.
Jimmy Pop and Jared Hennegan ("Evil Jared Hasselhoff") both attended Temple University in Philadelphia, PA.
Unable to book shows anywhere else, the Bloodhound Gang first performed in an extra room at Evil Jared's house, in exchange for Schlitz, Marlboros, and a chance to hand out their first demo tape, entitled Just Another Demo. When the floor caved in one night, they began performing every month at CBGBs in New York City. When asked about the band's tenure at the club, Jimmy Pop was quoted as saying, "I've seen cavemen with better clubs."
In April 1994, the band released their second demo tape, The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack to Hitler's Handicapped Helpers. This resulted in a record deal with Cheese Factory Records.
In summer 1994, Jimmy Pop had a small role in the short independent film The Chick That Was Naked by independent filmmaker Kurt Fitzpatrick. A song
In November 1994, the Bloodhound Gang released their first EP, Dingleberry Haze.

Use Your Fingers

In March 1995 the Bloodhound Gang signed a record deal with Columbia Records. They released their first full-length album, titled Use Your Fingers. They began touring around the United States. At this time, Daddy Long Legs and M.S.G., who were angry with Columbia Records, left the band to form another rap group, Wolfpac. Bass player Evil Jared Hasselhoff and turntablist Tard-E-Tard joined the group as replacements. When the tour ended, the deal with Columbia Records was dropped and band members Skip O'Pot2Mus and Tard-E-Tard left to pursue a career outside of the music industry.

One Fierce Beer Coaster

In March 1996, the band, complete with a new line-up, recorded their second full-length album with Rich Gavalis, a producer and owner of Dome Sound Studios, in Royersford, PA, local to Jimmy Pop. Lupus Thunder had recorded with Rich at the Dome with a former band, and introduced Jimmy Pop to Rich, who was the first studio in the PA area to embrace computer recording and could edit live instruments in ways other studios couldn't. This led to a relationship that followed through to their next record, Hooray for Boobies and the followup, Hefty Fine, and One Fierce Beer Coaster, first released on Cheese Factory Records (now Republic Records), and re-released on Geffen Records in late 1996. The original release, designed by Michael Calleia in New York City, had an actual beer coaster as part of the packaging. They embarked on their first "real tour" of the United States and Europe. This album contained "Fire Water Burn".
"Fire Water Burn" played a major role in the slow build of interest that ultimately led to the band's mainstream breakthrough. As the band could not previously afford national tours they promoted themselves by sending their music to radio stations across the country that fit the alternative rock format. One significant early radio breakthrough came when an intern at 107.7 The End in Seattle brought the band to the attention of the music director who, liking what he heard, played "Fire Water Burn" on his Friday night show. The feature prompted a flood of phone calls asking about the song and the band. The director passed the song onto his friend, the music director at KROQ-FM in Los Angeles, who then added it to her playlist. The snowball effect meant the band was overwhelmed with demands for their records that they struggled to meet. Record labels then started to call. According to manager Brett Alperowitz in an interview with HitQuarters, Madonna's label Maverick "really wanted to sign the band in the worst possible way, even to the point where I had to tell Madonna that I couldn't put her on the phone with Jimmy Pop."
After a couple of years of doing shows, taking advantage of the Internet, spreading the word through retail and radio in every way the band and management could on an independent level, they began to experience major success.

Hooray for Boobies

On  October 4, 1999, they released their third album, Hooray for Boobies, in Europe; due to legal issues, its release was delayed until February 29, 2000 in the US. This album was recorded in California, where the band and their engineer, Rich Gavalis relocated. The album was recorded partially at an LA studio the band rented, and partially at Rich Gavalis's home in the "Valley". Powered by the hit single "The Bad Touch", they embarked on two more tours of Europe, where their popularity had increased dramatically ("The Bad Touch" and Hooray for Boobies reached No.Â 1 in Germany, where "Along Comes Mary" was also a Top 10 hit). They returned after selling over five million albums.
In 2003, the band released a DVD entitled One Fierce Beer Run, which chronicles their One Fierce Beer Coaster tour of 1997.

Hefty Fine

The band's album, Hefty Fine, was released on September 13, 2005. The title came about after Evil Jared Hasselhoff was fined during work on MTV's "Viva La Bam" (The Scavenger Hunt episode). Jared was fined $10,000, which Jimmy Pop allegedly had to pay (as discussed in the "Un-commentary" of the Viva La Bam DVDs). Jimmy has stated that Jared was arrested after attempting to urinate into a dixie cup that he (Jim) was holding, from the top of a parking lot. Other songs from the album are part of a campaign by the Bloodhound Gang to change the Pennsylvania state anthem to their appropriately titled "Pennsylvania" (which is often incorrectly believed to be titled "Do You Even Know What a Wawa Is?", from that song's last stanza), as well as "Something Diabolical," featuring HIM's Ville Valo.

New album

In October 2008, Lupus Thunder quit the band; this was announced on a blog on the band's MySpace by bassist Evil Jared.
Jimmy Pop announced during a radio interview in Boston that the band was working on a new album that would feature around 10 to 12 songs. Many news agencies reported that the name of the album would be called Getting Laid on a School Bus with a now likely release date of 2012. On December 4, 2011, Jimmy Pop announced that he "just narrowed 25-30 demos down to 10-12 to finish".
In late 2010, the band released a new song called "Altogether Ooky". On November 15, DJ Q-Ball mentioned on his Facebook profile page that the band is headed to Berlin to shoot a music video for the song, which will also be included on a greatest hits compilation album. The band's greatest hits album Show Us Your Hits was released on December 21, featuring their new songs called "Altogether Ooky" and "Disco Pogo" alongside the band's older hits.
In an interview in 2011 Evil Jared stated that the new album would be released in either 2012 or 2013. Q-Ball also mentioned on his Twitter that signs point to either late 2012 or early 2013 and that the album was moving along very nicely as well as that it was their best album up to date. In February 2014, Jimmy Pop wrote on Twitter that he is currently recording vocals for the album. 

Controversies

"Yellow Fever" and anti-Asian allegations

Geffen Records refused to release the song "Yellow Fever" because of its graphic lyrical content about Asian women. In response, Jimmy Pop told Yahoo! Launch that the Gang's lyrical matter of the song was not intended to be taken seriously.

Onstage antics

The band arrived in the middle of a media storm mid-2006 when they started using a "golden shower" act onstage during a rendition of Depeche Mode's "Enjoy the Silence" at Rock am Ring and Pinkpop.
On 30 July 2013, during a concert in Kiev, Ukraine band member Jared Hasselhoff was seen peeing on the blue and yellow national flag, while on stage. the band is now facing criminal charges of hooliganism.
Days later, after an onstage stunt involving the Flag of Russia in Odessa, Ukraine, where Jared Hasselhoff stuffed the flag down the front of his pants and pulled it out the back, the band's next show, at the Kubana Festival in Anapa, Krasnodar Krai, Russia, was cancelled, and the band members were roughed up at the airport and pelted with eggs and rotten tomatoes. A Flag of the United States was also trampled and spat on at the same place and time. Vladimir Markin of the Investigative Committee of Russia said that his department was prepared to file criminal charges if prosecutors thought they had a case.
