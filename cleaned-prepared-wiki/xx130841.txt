Clan MacTavish is an Ancient Highland Scottish clan.

History

Origins

Tavis, Tavis or Taus is considered, and accepted in multiple sources, as the progenitor, epytom and founder of Clan MacTavish.  However, this is incorrect. The MacTavish consider themselves much older than the traditional stories of Argyllshire, promulgated by the old seannachies, and newer writers still insist upon the old stories, when none have looked beyond those traditional stories for any possible alternate origin. Such a beginning is found in the old Irish annals and the old writ, Ceart Ui Neill, out of Donegal, Ireland. The MacTavishes come from the Cenel nDuach a branch of the Cenel Conaill, descended from the Pictish Kings of Ros Guill and Irguill, now part of Donegal, and also from Dal-araidhe, now part of Antrim and Down.  The Greek (Roman)historian, mapmaker and mathematician, Ptolemy, mentions the tribe under the name of Ouenniknoi (Windukatii), and the lineage is tracable in such texts as the Irish Annuls of Ulster and Four Masters.
As the above text alludes, it is commonly held that Clan MacTavish descends from Taus (Tavis) Coir, son of Colin Mael Maith and a daughter of Suibhne Ruadh (Sween the Red of Castle Sween). The 17th century genealogy Ane Accompt of the Genealogie of the Campbells, randomly and inexplicably traces Colin Mael Maith back to the mythological King Arthur. Furthermore this record conveniently references Colin Mael Maith having one legitimate son and two illegitimate sons. The Accompt states the legitimate son as "Gillespic" or "Archibald", ancestor of Clan Campbell; and the two illegitimate sons are "Taius Coir" and "Iver", ancestors of the MacTavishes and Clan MacIver.
It can be difficult to find accurate information about the history of Clan MacTavish. This is a result of the clan being ancient and the fact that history is written or rewritten by those in power whom often must go to great lengths in order to establish or strengthen their position. It is all too common to find documentation like that of Alastair Campbell of Airds whom in 2000, wrote a more probable candidate for the ancestor of the clan, rather than the possibly mythological Taus Coir, is the historical Sir Thomas Cambel.
The ancient and unbroken chiefly line of MacTavishes are styled 'MacTavish of Dunardry' (the Gaelic Dun-ArdRigh means "fort or castle of the High King"). It is unknown who built the castle of Dunardry, or even when it was built. The castle is marked on a 1634 Timothy Pont map. By 1686 it must have been in the possession of the Earls of Argyll. It was renovated in 1704 by Duncan MacTavish, and according to the 19th-century historian G.D. Mathews, it seems likely it was later owned by the MacTavishes. Today nothing exists of the site, as it lies beneath the Crinan Canal.

18th century and Jacobite uprisings

In 1715 the Jacobite cause saw its first failed attempt to place the Stuarts back on the throne of Scotland and England. During this time Chief Archibald MacTavish was sympathetic to the Jacobite cause but took no action to support either the Government or the Jacobites.
Due to the fact that Dugald, the Younger, was imprisoned in September 1745 and that the Chief (Archibald) was quite elderly, during the 1745 Jacobite Rising, some of the MacTavishes fought within the ranks of their neighbor, MacIntosh.
On 16 April 1746 at the Battle of Culloden, the Jacobite army was defeated by a much larger force of the British government army (5000 fighting for Prince Charles and 9000 fighting for the government). On that day, the Jacobite army of Prince Charles lost the battle, and the fate of the Jacobite cause was sealed.

Highland Clearances

Unfortunately, after Culloden, British government and Scottish collaborationists treated highlanders very badly, transporting them  off their land and, indeed, from their country, using them as slaves in colonies and just killing. This was the period known as the Highland Clearances. The MacTavish chiefly line, still seated in Dunardarie with their clansmen, were not involved in the "clearing" of their own kin, and no MacTavishes were put off the lands.
After Culloden a few MacTavish families began to Anglicize their family name as Thomson or Thompson. This was a name already well established in the border Marches, where it was worn by families unrelated to the MacTavishes.org/short_history.org/Gaylor.

Sale of Dunardry

Dugald's son and heir, Lachlan MacTavish, succeeded his father in 1775. On 5 November 1785, the Estate of Dunardry was advertised for sale by public auction in DecemberThe Edinburgh Evening Courant, 5 November 1785, advertisement of sale on 7 December 1785 after Lachlan had fallen into financial trouble, partly due to judgement debts against him. At least two decisions by the Court of Session in Edinburgh arose from his father's lead role in failing to account for, and to properly execute, the estate  of Duncan Campbell of Kilduskland who had died in 1766.MC.3.3.1 MacDonald of Largie v Campbell & MacTavish

James' Court.
In 1797, three years after work was started on the Crinan Canal, which subsequently divided the estate, Dunardry was purchased by Simon McTavish of Montreal, from Stratherrick, Invernesshire. Simon McTavish was born of the Garthbeg branch of the family and at this time was probably the richest man in Canada. Some Stratherrick McTavishes were considered a sept of Clan Fraser. 1896.

Mackenzie, printed by The "Scottish Highlander" Office, pp. 697-699. Lachlan's son John George McTavish soon became a fur trader with the North West Company under Simon's patronage.

20th century

Back in the 18th century Lachlan's son, Dugald, under age in 1796, did not register the MacTavish arms; and as a grown man, with his duties as the Sheriff Substitute of Kintyre he obviously did not feel inclined to do so, as he was, already, legally known as MacTavish of Dunardry. He died without having re-registered the Arms. Unfortunately, this carried on with his son William MacTavish who had moved to the "wilds" of Canada. William also declined to register the Arms. It is nominally suggested by Lord Lyon that at least every other generation re-register the Chiefly Arms, to avoid dormancy of the Clan. As a result of William not matriculating for the arms, the Chiefly line was "lost" until 1949, when the Lord Lyon, Sir Thomas Innes of Learney, contacted the MacTavish family in Canada, advising them that they were the long-lost Chiefly line, inviting them to petition for the Arms and Chiefship of the Clan.

Revival

Clan MacTavish experienced a dormancy of 200 years when Lachlan MacTavish was the last Chief to register at that time. The dormancy ended in 1997 when Edward Stewart Dugald MacTavish of Dunardry matriculated. His son, Steven Edward Dugald MacTavish of Dunardry is the current Chief of Clan MacTavish.
William's great grandson, Edward Stewart Dugald MacTavish of Dunardry, was matriculated by the Court of the Lord Lyon 23 July 1997 and granted the Arms and Title of Chief of the Clan MacTavish of Dunardry, and was the 26th Chief of the Clan in an unbroken line. He died on 19 June 2005 at his home in Vancouver, BC. He is succeeded by his son and heir, the 27th Chief, Steven Edward Dugald MacTavish of Dunardry, a member of the Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs.

Origin of the name

The clan name MacTavish is an Anglicised spelling of the Gaelic name Mac Tamhais. The name means 'son of Thomas' and thus corresponds in meaning to English surnames such as Thomson or Thompson. Like those surnames, it is a patronymic form of a personal name--in this case, the Scots personal name Tammas, which is in turn is a form of the (originally Hebrew) name Thomas.
The Gaelic name Mac Tamhais is pronounced similarly to 'MacTavis' or 'MacTavish' (the "mh" in Gaelic pronounced as the "v" in the English word "very"). In old charters, the name had many variant spellings. Some spellings found within old charters,
post-Culloden parish registers, and in The Commons Argyll appear as MacAvis, MacCamis, McCawis,McKavis, McKnavis, M'Ash, MacAnish, mcTais, MacTavifh and mcThavish, to give but a few. It seems that from near the end of 17th century, the spelling MacTavish was most common, with some families adopting already well-established English surnames that were identical in meaning: Thomson, Thompson, or Thomas.org/short_history.

Septs

While the origins of the term sept are disputed, in modern times Scottish septs are considered to be family names and name variants associated with a particular clan.  In some instances, names are added to the list of clan septs by invitation of the Chief in honor of a valued friendship or marriage.S. Dugald MacTavish in 1999.

Variants and Other Families

Names, variant names, and septs for Clan MacTavish include Cash, MacCash, MacCavish, MacLehose, MacSteaphain, MacTavish, MacThom, MacThomas, Stephen(son), Steven(son), Tais, Taws, Taweson, Thom, Thomas, Thomason, Thompson, Thomson, Tod(d) and variant spellings.The Clans, Septs and Regiments of the Scottish Highlands; by Frank Adams, 7th Edition revised by Sir Thomas Innes of Learney, Lord Lyon King of Arms On this basis Clan Mactavish invites all bearers of these names to join their modern clan.clanmactavish.
By the 1500s the Scottish Parliament recognized MacThomas and Thomson as distinct families. Like MacTavish these names derive linguistically from the given male name Thomas but often that is as far as they are connected. Members of Clan MacThomas trace their ancestry to a fifteenth-century Gaelic-speaking Highlander named Tomaidh Mor ('Great Tommy'), himself a descendant of Clan Chattan Mackintoshes. Variants of the MacThomas name include McComie (from Gaelic MacThomaidh), McColm, McComas, and MacThom.clanmacthomas.co.aspx Thomson (with variant spellings such as Thompson) was a common surname in the border region between Scotland and England.org/short_history.html 
Today the Lord Lyon King of Arms officially recognizes as three distinct groups Clan MacThomas of Glenshee, Clan MacTavish, and Clan Thompson International. Each is characterized by a distinct history, heraldic tradition, and genetic makeup
