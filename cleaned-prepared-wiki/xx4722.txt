Ireland had a population of 4,581,269 as of the 2011 census.

Demographic history

Ireland, throughout most of its history, had a small population size, comparable to that of other regions of similar area in Europe. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, along with the rest of Europe, Ireland experienced a major population boom as a result of the Agricultural and Industrial revolutions. Its population densities remained comparable to that of Britain and the other countries of Europe.
This changed dramatically with the Great Famine of the mid-19th century, which led to mass starvation and consequent mass emigration. This famine was by far the most significant turning point in the demographics of the country: during the hundred years that followed, Ireland's population continued a slow decline, with the result that Ireland today has a significantly smaller population than other European countries of comparable size.
In the mid-20th century, Ireland's population started to grow once more, although emigration was still common. In the 1990s, the demographics of the country began to change as a result of the Celtic Tiger Irish economic boom. Immigration began to far outweigh emigration. Many former Irish emigrants returned home, and Ireland became an attractive destination for immigrants, mainly from Central Europe, but also from Africa, Asia and elsewhere. With the 2008 onset of the Irish economic and banking crisis, however, the country's economy suffered, and since then Ireland has once again been experiencing net emigration. 
In November 2013 Eurostat reported that Ireland had the largest net Emigration rate of any European Union country at 7.6 people emigrating per 1,000 population.
However, Ireland's population is the youngest of any country in the European Union  and its population size is predicted to grow for many decades into the future, bucking the trend of declining population predicted for most European countries. A report published in 2008 predicted that the country's population would reach 6.7 million by 2060.7m by 2060 Ireland has been experiencing a baby boom, with increasing birth rates and overall fertility rates.

Ethnic groups and immigration

Gaelic culture and language forms an important part of the Irish national identity.
The Irish Travellers are a native minority group.
In 2008, Ireland had the highest birth rate (18.1 per 1,000), lowest death rate (6.1 per 1,000) and highest net-migration rate (14.1 per 1,000) in the entire European Union – and the largest population growth rate (4.4%) in the 27-member bloc as a result.Irish Independent - Baby boom puts us on top of birth rate league
Ireland is home to people from all over the globe, especially in Dublin. These countries include Poland, United Kingdom, China, India, Brazil, Pakistan, Nigeria, Philippines, Lithuania, Latvia and Russia.
Traditionally Ireland has been a land of mass emigration and its gaining mass immigration to their country.
