Sir James Macklin, DL, JP (23 September 1864 – 17 April 1944) was an English jeweller and farmer, active in public life in Wiltshire.

Early life and business career

Macklin was born in West Harnham on 23 September 1864, the son of James Macklin (senior) and his wife, Sarah.
When the national census of England was taken in April 1871, James Macklin (senior) was described as a jeweller's shopman, living in West Harnham with his wife, four daughters and three sons. He later went into business as a cutler at No. 7, Catharine Street in Salisbury and the business became well known as James Macklin & Son, watchmakers and jewellers, silversmiths and cutlers. 195.
When the census was taken again, in April 1881, Macklin was described as an assistant in his father's business, living and working at No. 7, Catharine Street with his father (now described as a cutler, employing one man and one boy), mother, three sisters, two brothers and nephew.
Eventually Macklin took over the running of the business: When the census was taken again, in April 1891, he was described as a jeweller, living and working at No. 7, Catharine Street with his wife and a domestic servant.
When the census was taken again, in April 1911, however, he described himself as a retired jeweller, living at Watersmeet in Harnham with his wife, two daughters, son and domestic servant.
Macklin demonstrated significant business acumen. "Succeeding to an old-established business, which represents the last of the old cutlery trade, for which Salisbury at one time had a considerable reputation, he considerably extended its scope, and retired very early in life to a beautiful home he created for himself at East Harnham. ... Acquiring considerable property in the old village, which was incorporated into the borough Salisbury in 1904, Mr. Macklin readily gave up land to improve the roads, and generally devoted himself to the interests of the parish. He has lately given considerable attention to agricultural pursuits, in conjunction with his son, and is in occupation of a large farm at Tytherley."Western Gazette (Friday, 14 November 1913), p. 12.
In the years that followed he concentrated on his farming interests.

I am very grateful to you for the unselfish way in which you have devoted yourself to the services of the city and to myself.' The Mayor, acknowledging this gracious remark, said, with becoming modesty: 'I have to thank my colleagues for any success I have had Your Majesty,' and the King rejoined: 'Will you also express my thanks to your colleagues.' His Majesty, continuing, said he understood that his troops on Salisbury Plain had been well treated in the way of entertainments and hospitality at Salisbury. The Mayor assured His Majesty that the citizens had been pleased to do everything they could for the troops, and the King graciously added: 'I wish you to thank the citizens for all they have done for the soldiers.' His Majesty then expressed good wishes for the Mayor's health and said he wished the Mayor to convey his message to the citizens."Western Gazette (Friday, 20 September 1918), p. 6.
