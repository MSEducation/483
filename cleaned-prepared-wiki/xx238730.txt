CATEGORIES: Brazilian cuisine, Butter, Cooking fats

Manteiga-de-garrafa (butter-in-a-bottle) or manteiga-da-terra (butter of the land) are terms in northeastern Brazil to refer to a clarified butter product, similar to Indian ghee. The product is also known as manteiga de gado (ox butter) and manteiga de cozinha (kitchen butter).
Manteiga de garrafa is a dairy product made from the cream of cows' milk.
Manteiga de garrafa is a yellow-orange, viscous liquid which may be opaque or semi-translucent. It is strongly flavored, with flavors of cheese, fish, rancidity, and barnyard composing part of the flavor profile.  In cooking, the product is used in much the same way as ordinary butter.
The borra that is removed during processing is also eaten.  It can be eaten with bread, or used as an ingredient in farofa, carne-de-sol, feij√£o verde, and in cooking fried eggs or cassava (macaxeira).
Manteiga de garrafa is a product of artesanal or small-scale manufacturing, as well as home production, and its quality and flavor can be variable.
