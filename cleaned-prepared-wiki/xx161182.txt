"Scream Thy Last Scream" is an unreleased song by Pink Floyd, written by frontman Syd Barrett and was scheduled to be the band's next single. 

Recording

Only two takes are complete. It was recorded in the same sessions as "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun", on 7â€“8 August 1967.

Music and lyrics

The song features: several changes in tempo, a sped-up double-tracked vocal part by Barrett, while Mason simultaneously sings the normal part Barrett is only clearly audible on one line in the song, "she'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours".

Aborted release and other versions

The two tracks were arranged to be released as a single on 8 September, before it was vetoed by the band's record company, EMI.
A promotional video was made for the track, directed by poet Spike Hawkins. A final studio cut of "Scream Thy Last Scream" was completed along with a somewhat different BBC radio version (which features both Barrett and Mason on lead vocals)
