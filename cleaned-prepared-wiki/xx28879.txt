Michael IV the Paphlagonian (, Mikhaēl ho Paphlagōn; 1010 – 10 December 1041) was Byzantine Emperor from 11 April 1034 to his death on 10 December 1041. He owed his elevation to Empress Zoe, daughter of Emperor Constantine VIII and wife of Romanos III Argyros.

Early life and career

Michael came from a family of Paphlagonian peasants, one of whom, the parakoimomenos John the Orphanotrophos, had come to preside over the woman's quarters at the imperial palace. 477  John brought his younger brothers into the court and there the empress Zoe became enamoured of the youngest, Michael, who became her chamberlain in 1033.  Prior to his court appointment, Michael was originally a money-changer,Kazhdan, pg. 1365 but it was believed that he was also secretly a forger of false coins. 276
The two soon became lovers. Hearing the rumours, Romanos was concerned and confronted Michael,Norwich, pg. 276 but he denied the accusations, swearing his innocence on some holy relics. 277  Then, on April 11, 1034, Zoe's husband, Romanos III was found dead in his bath. Rumours soon began circulating that Zoe and Michael had decided to use a slow poison to kill him. 586  However, becoming impatient with the poison Michael had had him strangled or drowned. 278Kazhdan, pg. 2228  Adding weight to the rumours was the speed with which Zoe and Michael were married, on the very day that Romanos III died.
The next day, April 12, 1034, the couple summoned the Patriarch Alexios I to officiate in the coronation of the new emperor. 279  Although he initially refused to co-operate, the payment of 50 pounds of gold helped change his mind.  He proceeded to crown Michael IV as the new emperor of the Romans. 586Finlay, pg. 478

Reign

Domestic policies

Michael IV was handsome, clever, and generous, but he was uneducated and suffered from epileptic fits. 266  This meant he was initially very reliant upon someone to direct the government in his name, and although Zoe believed Michael would prove to be a more devoted husband than Romanos, she was sadly mistaken. Michael IV was concerned about Zoe turning on him the way she had turned on Romanos,Norwich, pg. 280 and so he excluded Zoe from politics altogether. Given this background and his health status, he proceeded to leave the government in the hands of his brother John, who had already become an influential minister under Constantine VIII and Romanos III. 480  Zoe was confined to the palace gynaeceum, and kept under strict surveillance,Norwich, pg. 280 while Michael's visits grew more and more infrequent. 267
John's reforms of the army and financial system revived for a while the strength of the Empire, which held its own successfully against its foreign enemies. 485  But the increase in taxation caused discontent among both nobles and commoners. 481  John's monopoly of the government, and his policies, such as the introduction of the Aerikon tax, led to several failed conspiracies against him, and, by extension, Michael. 1365Finlay, pg. 481  There were local revolts at Antioch, Nicopolis and Bulgaria. 482  Local discontent was exacerbated by poor harvests and famine caused by bad weather and a locust plage in 1035,Treadgold, pg. 586 and when Michael tried to exercise a measure of control over Aleppo, the local citizens drove off the imperial governor. 587
In 1034, Constantine Dalassenos was arrested by Michael on suspicion of treason, accused of fomenting insurrection at Antioch. 485  In 1037, Zoe was involved in a conspiracy to have John the Eunuch poisoned.  In 1038, there was an uprising in the armies in Anatolia, which was suppressed by Michael's brother, Constantine. 485 In 1040, there was a conspiracy involving the patrician Michael Keroularios, who became a monk to save his life and was later elected as Patriarch of Constantinople. 485  Finally, during the Bulgarian uprising of 1040, John the Eunuch was forced to arrest suspected plotters in Anatolia and Constantinople who were hoping to take advantage of the turmoil. 588  He was unable to capture the Strategos of Theodosiopolis, who joined the rebellion and attempted to capture Thessalonica. 588

Foreign and military affairs

In military affairs, Michael's reign began badly. The Arabs sacked Myra, the Serbs had thrown off Byzantine authority, and the Pechenegs were raiding almost at will up to the gates of Thessalonica. 586 Yet the situation was soon stabilised; by 1035, on the eastern frontier, Arab pirates who had been raiding were either captured or killed, the Byzantines had taken the Muslim fortress of Berkri, on the eastern shore of Lake Van,Treadgold, pg. 587 while the important fortress of Edessa was relieved after a prolonged siegeFinlay, pg. 486 and eventually ceded back to the empire in 1037. 587
On the western front, in Sicily, Michael and John ordered the general George Maniakes to drive the Arabs out of the island. 285 Beginning in 1038,Treadgold, pg. 587 Maniakes landed in southern Italy and soon had captured Messina. He then began defeating the scattered Arab forces and taking towns in the west and south of the island, almost succeeding in driving the Arabs from the island. 587 By 1040, he had stormed and taken Syracuse. 588 Maniakes then fell out with his Lombard allies,Norwich, pg. 286 however, while his Norman mercenaries, unhappy with their pay, abandoned the Byzantine general and raised a revolt on the Italian mainland, resulting in the temporary loss of Bari. 588 Maniakes was about to strike against them when he was recalled by John the Eunuch on suspicion of conspiracy. 588 After the recall of Maniakes most of the Sicilian conquests were lost throughout 1041,Treadgold, pg. 589 and a subsequent expedition against the Normans suffered several defeats, although Bari was recaptured. 589
In the north, Pecheneg pressure had initially forced the Serbs to seek the protection of the Byzantine Empire and acknowledge Byzantine authority. 587 In 1040, however, the Serbs again revolted,Finlay, pg. 490 as did the Bulgarians in western Bulgaria and Macedonia in the same year. This uprising was partly caused by the heavy taxation in coin (and not, as before, in kind) imposed on Bulgaria at the time,Norwich, pg. 287 but it also aimed at the restoration of the Bulgarian state under the leadership of Peter Delyan. 491 The rebels seized Belgrade and proclaimed Peter "Emperor of Bulgaria". 588 The rebels quickly took Skopje. Michael IV made things worse by removing from command the doux of Dyrrhachium, who had been marching against Peter Delyan, accusing him of a conspiracy. His troops, largely Bulgarian, joined the revolt, and Michael IV was chased out of the vicinity of Thessalonica. 588 By now Dyrrhachium was lost, and Peter had not only defeated the strategos of Hellas, but most of the theme of Nicopolis had risen up against Michael, disgusted with the greed of John the Eunuch. 588  Michael, however, returned with an army of 40,000 men in 1041, assisted by Norse mercenaries including the future King Harald III of Norway. Gathering his forces at Mosynopolis, the emperor waited for the Bulgarian army;Treadgold, pg. 587 the military success of the Byzantines was aided by internal dissension among the Bulgarians, and eventually their leaders were defeated and captured. 289 Michael IV returned to Constantinople in triumph, but by now it was obvious that he was dying. 286

Final illness and death

As early as 1038, Michael's epilepsy had been growing steadily worse, and he developed a severe case of dropsy. 587  He sought heavenly aid by visiting the shrine of Saint Demetrius at Thessalonica and by building or rebuilding churches. 587  In 1039, he gave monetary gifts to every monk and priest in the empire,Treadgold, pg. 588 and also to any parents who made him a godfather to their children,Treadgold, pg. 588 but to no avail. John the Eunuch, eager to ensure that power remained in his hands, forced Zoe to adopt Michael V, the son of Michael IV's sister. 2228  After taking Holy Orders,Kazhdan, pg. 1365 on 10 December 1041 Michael IV died, refusing to the last to see his wife, who begged that she be allowed to see him one more time before he died. 289
