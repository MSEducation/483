The Mikoyan MiG-31 (; NATO reporting name: Foxhound) is a supersonic interceptor aircraft developed to replace the MiG-25 "Foxbat". The MiG-31 was designed by the Mikoyan design bureau based on the MiG-25.

Development

The MiG-25, despite Western panic about its tremendous performance, made substantial design sacrifices in capability for the sake of achieving high speed, altitude, and rate of climb. It lacked maneuverability at interception speeds and was difficult to fly at low altitudes. The MiG-25's speed was limited to Mach 2.83 in operations, but it could reach a maximum speed of Mach 3.2 or more with the risk of damaging the engines beyond repair. 132–133.
Development of the MiG-25's replacement began with the Ye-155MP () prototype which first flew on 16 September 1975. 323.  Although it bore a superficial resemblance to a stretched MiG-25 with a longer fuselage for the radar operator cockpit, it was in many respects a new design.  The MiG-25 used 80% nickel steel in its structure to allow welding. 308.
The most important development was introducing an advanced radar capable of both look-up and look-down engagement (locating targets above and below the aircraft), as well as multiple target tracking. This finally gave the Soviets an interceptor able to engage the most likely Western intruders at long range.ru/21381-mig-31-luchshiy-istrebitel-perehvatchik-mira.html
Like its MiG-25 predecessor, the MiG-31 was surrounded by early speculation and misinformation concerning its design and abilities. The West learned of the new interceptor from Lieutenant Viktor Belenko, a pilot who defected to Japan in 1976 with his MiG-25P. Belenko described an upcoming "Super Foxbat" with two seats and an ability to intercept cruise missiles. According to his testimony, the new interceptor was to have air intakes similar to the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23, which the MiG-31 does not have, at least not in production variants.

Replacement

Russia hopes to field a replacement for the MiG-31 by 2020, with all aircraft retired by 2028.  Development of a new aircraft, designated MiG-41 has begun.  Development of a new interceptor is favored over restarting MiG-31 production.ru, April 11, 2013

Design

Like the MiG-25, MiG-31 is a large twin-engine aircraft with side-mounted air intakes, a shoulder-mounted wing with an aspect ratio of 2.94, and twin vertical tailfins. Unlike the MiG-25, it has two seats, with the rear occupied by a dedicated weapon systems officer.How the Mig-31 repelled the SR-71 Blackbird from Soviet skies

Airframe and engines

The wings and airframe of the MiG-31 are stronger than those of the MiG-25, permitting supersonic flight at low altitudes. Its D30-F6 jet engines, each rated at 152 kN thrust, allow a maximum speed of Mach 1.23 at low altitude. High-altitude speed is temperature-redlined to Mach 2.83—the thrust-to-drag ratio is sufficient for speeds in excess of Mach 3, but such speeds pose unacceptable hazards to engine and airframe life in  routine use.
MiG-31 is limited to only 5 g at supersonic speeds. At combat weight, its wing loading is marginal and its thrust to weight ratio is favorable. However, it is not designed for close combat or rapid turning. "Mikoyan's Long-Legged Hunting Dog." Air International,  December 2002, pp. 396–401.

Electronics suite

The MiG-31 was the world's first operational fighter with a  passive electronically scanned array radar (PESA), the Zaslon S-800. Its maximum range against fighter-sized targets is approximately 200 km (125 mi), and it can track up to 10 targets and simultaneously attack four of them with its Vympel R-33 missiles. The radar is matched with an infrared search and tracking (IRST) system in a retractable undernose fairing.

Radars

Adopted in 1981 RP-31 N007 backstop (Russian -Zaslon).milrus.shtml
The basic differences between versions МiG-31BM:worldweapon.ru, MiG-31БМ
The onboard radar complex MiG-31BM can track 24 airborne targets at one time, 8 of which can be simultaneously attacked by R-33S missiles.
Modernized variants of the aircraft can be equipped with anti-radiation missiles Kh-31S, Kh-25MR or MPU (up to six units), anti-ship UR Kh-31A (up to six), class missiles air-to-surface Kh-29 and Kh-59 (up to three) or Kh-59M (up to two units), up to six precision bombs KAB-1500 or eight KAB-500 with television or laser-guided. Maximum mass of payload is to 9000 kg.
The MiG-31M-, MiG-31D-, and MiG-31BS-standard aircraft have an upgraded Zaslon-M radar, with larger antenna and greater detection range (said to be 400 km (250 mi) against AWACS-size targets) and the ability to attack multiple targets — air and ground — simultaneously. The Zaslon-M has a 1.4m diameter (larger) antenna, 50% to 100% better performance than Zaslon. In April 1994 it was used with an R-37 to hit a target at 300 km distance. It has a search range 400 km versus a 19/20 sq m RCS target and can track 24 targets at once, engaging sixZaslon radar at Janes Defence web-siteZaslon radar at Russia Airforce Handbook - Google Books(282 km for 5m2"Zaslon-M radar."

Cockpit

The aircraft is a two-seater with the rear seat occupant controlling the radar. Although cockpit controls are duplicated across cockpits, it is normal for the aircraft to be flown only from the front seat. The pilot flies the aircraft by means of a centre stick and left hand throttles. The rear cockpit has only two small vision ports on the sides of the canopy. It is argued that the presence of the WSO (Weapon Systems Operator) in the rear cockpit improves aircraft effectiveness since the WSO is entirely dedicated to radar operations and weapons deployment. This decreases the workload of the pilot and increases efficiency. Both cockpits are fitted with zero/zero ejection seats which allow the crew to eject at any altitude and airspeed.

Armament

The MiG-31's main armament is four R-33 air-to-air missiles (NATO codename AA-9 'Amos') carried under the belly. The R-33 is the Russian equivalent of the U.S. Navy's AIM-54 Phoenix.
Unlike the MiG-25, the MiG-31 has an internal cannon, a six-barrel, 23 mm GSh-6-23 with 800 rounds of ammunition, mounted above the starboard main landing gear bay. The GSh-6-23 has a claimed rate of fire of over 10,000 rounds per minute.  However, due to the loss of two Su-24s because of premature shell detonation in 1983, and problems with gun usage (such as system failures), use of the GSh-6-23 was stopped by a decision of the Soviet AF Command.  The aircraft in the Russian AF were flying with fully operational guns, but without ammunition in January 2009. "Amendments and additional notes to 'Rapid Fire'." Retrieved: 24 January 2011.

Operational history

The MiG-31 entered operational service with the Soviet Air Defence Forces (PVO) in 1982. It was the only Soviet fighter capable of intercepting the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, and did so several times starting in 1986.
With the designation Ye-266, a re-engined Ye-155 shattered world records. It reached an absolute maximum altitude of 123,524 ft, or 37,650 m, and set a time to height record of 35,000 m in 4 minutes, 11.78 seconds, both of which were set by test pilot Alexander Fedotov. Ostapenko, his deputy, set a record of 30,000 m in 3 minutes, 9.8 seconds."World Records." OKB MIG. Retrieved: 11 May 2011.
Following the disintegration of the USSR in 1991 the budget for spares and maintenance collapsed, leaving many squadrons unable to maintain their aircraft. The MIG-31 AOG desk was created to address this problem.

However, the order has been suspended in May 2009 reportedly either due to Israeli pressure or lack of Syrian funds."Syrian MiG-31 Order suspended." mosnews. Retrieved: 24 January 2011.

Variants

A new version of the MiG-31 with upgraded avionics, the MiG-31B, was introduced in 1990. Its development was the result of the Soviet discovery that Phazotron radar division engineer Adolf Tolkachev had sold information on advanced radars to the West. Tolkachev was executed, and a new version of the compromised radar was hastily developed. Many earlier MiG-31s were upgraded to the new standard, designated MiG-31BM." RIA Novosti. Retrieved: 17 August 2010.
Development of a more comprehensive advanced version, the MiG-31M, began in 1983 and first flew in 1986, but the dissolution of the Soviet Union prevented it from entering full production.
The upgraded MiG-31БМ maximum range detection of air targets increased to 320 km automatic tracking accepted up to ten goals, and the latest complexes of track up to 24 targets and simultaneously can attack up to 8 targets. On-Board computer Argon-K selects the four most important, which simultaneously are operated four missiles air-to-air long-range R-33 (R-33S).  Thermal radar is interfaced radar and is designed for passive review of the airspace, and for the issuance of targeting missiles P-40TD and R-60 TGS.

The MiG-31 was equipped with RK-RLDN and APD-518 digital secure datalinks. The RK-RLDN datalink is for communication with ground control centers. The APD-518 datalink enables a flight of four MiG-31 to automatically exchange radar-generated data within 200 (124 mi) from each other. It also enables other aircraft with less sophisticated avionics,
In March 2014, Russian test pilot Anatoly Kvochur said that work has begun on a Mach 4 MiG-41 based on the MiG-31."The Russian Armed Forces are working on the Mig-41, a new supersonic fighter based on the Mig-31 Foxhound."
