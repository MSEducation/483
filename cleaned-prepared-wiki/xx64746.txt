The Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science ("TAMS") is a two-year residential early entrance college program serving approximately 375 students at the University of North Texas.unt. TAMS is a member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology.
TAMS was established in 1987 by the Texas legislature, in order to provide high school students seeking careers in math, science, and engineering an opportunity to take advanced coursework.301 ( Students take UNT classes for their two years at TAMS, and graduate with a TAMS high school diploma, as well as a UNT college transcript with a minimum of 57 hours of transferable college credits.unt.edu/admissions/eligibility
