Gregorian Code discovery

In 2010 the Volterra database was used by Corcoran and Salway to  identify previously unknown fragments of the Gregorian Code. The "Fragmenta Londiniensia" are seventeen pieces of parchment estimated to date from AD400, the document having been cut up and re-used as book-binding material. This is the  first direct evidence yet discovered of the Gregorian Codex.
