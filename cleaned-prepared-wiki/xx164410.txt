History

Christian activities in Nigeria began in the first place around 1472 through the Portuguese Catholic traders around the Niger Delta area – Calabar, Bonny, and Warri kingdoms.  A church was built in Benin and the son of Oba of Benin was baptized in 1574. In spite of their efforts,their mission failed because the traders were more interested in commerce than evangelization.  These early Roman Catholic missionaries and traders were reported to get as far as Ile-Ife( a part of Catholic Osogbo Diocese territory) during the 15th century first attempt at evangelization of Nigeria.
According to Fabunmi (1970),it wasn't until 1843 about three hundred years after Christianity had become extinct in Ile- Ife that the faith resurfaced in Nigeria again.M.A, who landed in Lagos on the 17th February,1862 from Quidah in Dahomey.They were emigrants from Brazil and Cuba after the emancipation of slaves in those areas,they were under the pastoralcare of priests from San Thome Island.
