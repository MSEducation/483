History

1988–1992

The group first formed in the year of 1988. The band was originally called The Walls due to their original influence by the band Echoes; the frontman of Echoes, Jinsei Tsuji, was a political activist, and because of this The Walls too became a political band. Drummer Hideya Suzuki was not an original member of The Walls. When the original drummer departed, the band recruited Suzuki, who went to the same school as the other members. They changed their name in late 1988 after sending a demo tape that generated no interest from record companies, during a talk in a dinner. The group thought the word "children" had a nice ring to it, but because they were no longer children themselves, they decided to add Mr. in front of it. They credit this change as a new way they started to look at the group.Mr. Children 1992–1995 album booklet
