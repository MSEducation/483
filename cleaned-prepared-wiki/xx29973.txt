Casper is a city in and the county seat of Natrona County, Wyoming, United States. Casper is the second-largest city in Wyoming, according to the 2010 census, with a population of 55,316. Only Cheyenne, the state capital, is larger. Casper is nicknamed "The Oil City" and has a long history of oil boomtown and cowboy culture, dating back to development of the nearby Salt Creek Oil Field.
Casper is located in east-central Wyoming at the foot of Casper Mountain, the north end of the Laramie Mountain Range, along the North Platte River.

History

The city was established east of the former site of Fort Caspar, which was built during the mid-19th century mass migration of land seekers along the Oregon, California and Mormon trails.
The government soon posted a military garrison nearby to protect telegraph and mail service.  It was  under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William O. Collins.  American Indian attacks increased after the Sand Creek Massacre in Colorado in 1864, bringing more troops to the post, which was by now called Platte Bridge Station.  In July 1865, Lieutenant Caspar Collins (the son of Colonel Collins) was killed near the post by a group of Indian warriors. Three months later the garrison was renamed Fort Caspar after Lieutenant Collins. In 1867, the troops were ordered to abandon Fort Caspar in favor of Fort Fetterman downstream on the North Platte along the Bozeman Trail.
The town of Casper itself was founded well after the fort had been closed.  The city was founded by developers as an anticipated stopping point during the expansion of the Wyoming Central Railway; it was an early commercial rival to Bessemer and Douglas, Wyoming.  The lack of a railhead doomed Bessemer in favor of Casper.  Douglas, also a railhead, survives to the present day.  The presence of a railhead made Casper the starting off point for the "invaders" in the Johnson County War. The special chartered train carrying the men up from Texas stopped at Casper.  The reason why the town is named Casper, instead of Caspar honoring the memory of Fort Caspar and Lt. Caspar Collins, is due to a typo that occurred when the town's name was officially registered.

Since the discovery of crude oil in the region during the 1890s, Casper became the regional petroleum industry center.  Oil has figured prominently in its history from nearly the outset. Oil was first discovered in the famous Salt Creek Oil Field in 1889, approximately  north of Casper; the first refinery in Casper was built in 1895.  The city has featured a refinery ever since, although various refineries have been built and closed over the years.  As recently as the early 1980s, the city was near or home to three refineries.  The surviving one, operated by Sinclair Oil Corporation, is located nearby in  Evansville, Wyoming.  Development of Wyoming coal and uranium fields in recent decades has helped Casper continue its role as a center in the energy industry.
