Montgomery County is included in the Clarksville, TN–KY Metropolitan Statistical Area.

History

The county was named for John Montgomery, an early settler who founded the city of Clarksville.  The county was initially organized as Tennessee County, North Carolina, but its name was changed in 1796, the year that Tennessee was admitted as a state, to reduce confusion.  In the same year, much of the eastern portion of the county was removed from its jurisdiction and incorporated with territory taken from Sumner County to form Robertson County.  Subsequent acts of the Tennessee General Assembly further reduced the area of the county; it obtained its current size and boundaries in 1871. 508-513
Montgomery County was the site of several saltpeter mines. Saltpeter is the main ingredient of gunpowder and was obtained by leaching the earth from several local caves. Bellamy Cave, located near Stringtown, contains the remains of two dozen saltpeter leaching vats and was apparently a large operation.  Cooper Creek Cave also shows evidence of extensive mining and contains the remains of "many saltpeter hoppers". Dunbar Cave is also reported to have been mined for saltpeter during the Mexican War, but commercial development has erased any evidence of this mining. In all likelihood, Bellamy Cave and Cooper Creek Cave were mined during the War of 1812.  Little mining in this area is likely to have occurred during the Civil War, since this part of Tennessee fell under Federal control in early 1862.

Geography

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 

Dunbar Cave

Montgomery County lies in a region of well-developed karst topography and has a cave system named Dunbar Cave.  Dunbar Cave is the centerpiece of Dunbar Cave State Park, which encompasses approximately 110 acres and is one of the most visited units in the Tennessee State Park System.
Dunbar Cave was explored by prehistoric Indians.  Remains of their cane torches have been found in the cave and archaeologists have excavated numerous artifacts inside the entrance. Matthews, Dunbar Cave, 2005, ISBN 1-879961-22-9. During a research trip into the cave on January 15, 2005, Park Ranger Amy Wallace, History Professor Joe Douglas, local historian Billyfrank Morrison, and Geologist Larry E. Matthews, discovered Indian Glyphs on the walls of the cave.  Subsequent investigations by archaeologists from the University of Tennessee at Knoxville confirmed that these drawings were left by Mississippian-era Indians. Simek, Joseph C. Douglas, and Amy Wallace, "Ancient Cave Art at Dunbar Cave State Natural Area", Tennessee Conservationist Magazine, September/October 2007, pages 24 – 26.  These Indian Glyphs were featured on the tour of the cave.  However, in 2009 the cave was closed due to the presence of White Nose Syndrome detected in one single bat.  The above ground portion of the Park is still open to the public.
