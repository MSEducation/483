[[Cracking joints]]

CATEGORIES: Joints, Noise

Cracking or popping of joints is the action of joint manipulation to produce a sharp cracking or popping sound. This commonly occurs during deliberate knuckle-cracking.  It is possible to crack many joints, such as those in the back and neck vertebrae, hips, neck, wrists, elbows, shoulders, toes, ankles, knees, jaws, feet, and the Achilles tendon area.

Causes

The physical mechanism causing a cracking sound produced by bending, twisting, or compressing joints is uncertain. Suggested causes include:
Synovial fluid cavitation has some evidence to support it.
The snapping of tendons or scar tissue over a prominence (as in snapping hip syndrome) can also generate a loud snapping or popping sound.

Effects

The common claim that cracking one's knuckles causes arthritis appears unsupported. A recent study examined the hand radiographs of 215 people (aged 50 to 89) and compared the joints of those who regularly cracked their knuckles to those who did not. 
Medical doctor Donald Unger cracked the knuckles of his left hand every day for more than sixty years, but he did not crack the knuckles of his right hand. No arthritis or other ailments formed in either hand, earning him the 2009 Ig Nobel Prize in Medicine, a parody of the Nobel Prize.
