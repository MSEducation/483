The Köppen classification depends on average monthly values of temperature and precipitation.  The most commonly used form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as rain forest, monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical, humid continental, oceanic climate, Mediterranean climate, steppe, subarctic climate, tundra, polar ice cap, and desert.
Rain forests are characterized by high rainfall, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between 
An oceanic (or maritime) climate is typically found along the west coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents, bordering cool oceans, as well as southeastern Australia, and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year round.

Effect on agriculture

Precipitation, especially rain, has a dramatic effect on agriculture.  All plants need at least some water to survive, therefore rain (being the most effective means of watering) is important to agriculture.  While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, too much or too little rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops.  Drought can kill crops and increase erosion, while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.
In areas with wet and dry seasons, soil nutrients diminish and erosion increases during the wet season.  Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime.  The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature.A. Roberto Frisancho (1993). Human Adaptation and Accommodation. University of Michigan Press, p. Retrieved on 2008-12-27.  Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season.

Changes due to global warming

Increasing temperatures tend to increase evaporation which leads to more precipitation. Precipitation has generally increased over land north of 30°N from 1900 to 2005 but has declined over the tropics since the 1970s.  Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time.  Eastern portions of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia have become wetter.  The Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and parts of southern Asia have become drier.  There has been an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events over many areas during the past century, as well as an increase since the 1970s in the prevalence of droughts—especially in the tropics and subtropics.  Changes in precipitation and evaporation over the oceans are suggested by the decreased salinity of mid- and high-latitude waters (implying more precipitation), along with increased salinity in lower latitudes (implying less precipitation, more evaporation, or both).  Over the contiguous United States, total annual precipitation increased at an average rate of 6.1% per century since 1900, with the greatest increases within the East North Central climate region (11.6% per century) and the South (11.1%). Hawaii was the only region to show a decrease (-9.25%).

Changes due to urban heat island

The urban heat island warms cities 0.6 to 5.6 °C (1.1 to 10.1 °F) above surrounding suburbs and rural areas.  This extra heat leads to greater upward motion, which can induce additional shower and thunderstorm activity.  Rainfall rates downwind of cities are increased between 48% and 116%.  Partly as a result of this warming, monthly rainfall is about 28% greater between 

Forecasting

The Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (abbreviated QPF) is the expected amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area.
