History

Early history

In July 1911, a charter was drawn up for the formation of an Orthodox synagogue named Congregation Agudath Achim Anshai.  Many of the founders had immigrated to the United States from Russia and Poland, and many of its leaders were merchants and professionals in the area.  Raphael Riemer, who immigrated to Freehold from Russia in 1906, was the synagogue's first rabbi and cantor.  Louis Finegold, a clothing store owner, was the first President of the synagogue. In 1911, the synagogue had a membership of 40 families.
The synagogue was first built, at a land and construction cost of approximately $1,000, as a small (32' x 50') today).  The synagogue added a second floor to the building in 1916.
The synagogue formed a sisterhood in 1920, and that year a mikva was constructed below the synagogue. The synagogue also established a cemetery on Route 33 in Freehold, which it has maintained for more than 90 years.

1940â€“2000

In the 1940s, the Ku Klux Klan became active in the Howell Township area, and members of the synagogue regularly patrolled the synagogue grounds armed with shotguns to protect it against Klan members.  In 1943, during World War II, American soldier and Freehold Jewish Center member Jack Steinberg found an old Torah covered in soot and ash in the burned wreckage of a synagogue in a small Jewish village in Italy.  He shipped it back to the synagogue, where it was  restored 47 years later and is now proudly displayed outside the office.  Synagogue membership in the synagogue had grew to 100 families by 1943, and 184 families by 1950.
During the 1950s and 1960s, synagogue membership in the synagogue reached 400.  It changed its name to Freehold Jewish Center in the 1960s. Rabbi Eli Fishman was the synagogue's rabbi from 1970 until his retirement in 1997. He was succeeded by Rabbi Kenneth Greene, who retired in 2011. As of 2011, the synagogue is led by Rabbi Dr. Tal Sessler.

21st century

In 2002, the synagogue commissioned the writing of a new torah scroll, for $30,000. Family members had constructed the synagogue's ark and benches by hand after his death.
In 2006, the synagogue had a membership of 260 families. By 2010, membership had fallen to 175 families.
In 2011, to commemorate its centennial year, the synagogue planned a series of events.  Past president Jerry Einhorn said: "I think it's absolutely wonderful we have reached our 100th year. It's a beautiful synagogue, and I look forward to its next 500 years." That year marked Greene's 13th and final year as the congregation's rabbi.
As of 2013 the congregation's Rabbi is Edward Friedman, the Cantor is Aron Heller, and the President is Gabriel Gurman.

Broad Street Synagogue building

Ground was broken in 1947 for a new synagogue, on lots 250' x 175' that were purchased in 1943 and 1945, responding to the need for a larger one. In 1957, the new synagogue was completed on the corner of Broad Street and Stokes Street. The synagogue was dedicated on August 25, 1957, with Governor Robert B. Meyner and his wife as guests of honor.  David Metz was president of the synagogue at the time.  In 1973, an addition was added to the synagogue, containing classrooms and offices, and expanding the sanctuary.
The synagogue's sanctuary and extension are flanked in beautiful stained glass windows.  The building also houses 12 classrooms, social halls, a 350-person formal ballroom, a youth lounge, a library, a smaller chapel, and kosher kitchens.
