Film career and controversy

Gutter King was his first breakthrough feature internationally and nominated for 3 awards in 2010.aoffest.pdf  It has been compared to the early films of Martin Scorsese in that "the violence is dealt with extreme care and respect, as opposed to the superficiality with which we are used to seeing from directors like Guy Ritchie, Danny Boyle or David Fincher."  
Morris has written numerous scripts that haven't been produced yet, most famous of which is about a robot living during the apocalypse.  After an early makeup test was posted on YouTube without the director's approval, he rewrote the movie's concept entirely, taking out all mention of zombies.quietearth.com.ufo-tech.com 
After his latest movie Gutter King,Spanish language review of Gutter King reached 3.2 million torrents, he CONTROVERSIALLY instigated a lawsuit against The Pirate BayThe Pirate Bayy to cut down on unauthorized and illegal downloading of media. The lawsuit is failing to find a court where it can gain standingLegal standing and it appears that his filing in Dry TortugasDry Tortugas has failed because Pirate Court no longer exists since the sinking of Tortugas BanksTortugas Bank where downtown Pirate Village was once located.  Morris, not knowing that Pirate Bay cannot be found or served and that the judicial system that governs it can no longer be approached, has found himself adrift and is considering courts in SomaliaPiracy in Somalia where modern pirates are now found.google.com/#hl=en&source=hp&q=Gutter+King+torrents&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=CoN5K4610TPnrAofAyQSelcXuDwAAAKoEBU_QUR_-&pbx=1&fp=daf3dcdf28868582

Themes and Style

Although Keith Alan Morris' films differ considerably in setting and characters (Gutter King is about a suburban teenager, his next film is a robot epic), they share similar themes of existentialism, violence, and spirituality.
Keith Alan Morris' style is composed of handheld based tracking shots and camera movement in general, and he uses his scenes to convey ideas with images, rather than with dialogue. One Latin audience reviewer likened him to Martin Scorsese because of his foreboding, ominous style and his approach to violence comes from a prudent and responsible perspective of trying to understand the characters and the motives for their behavior.com/2010/07/critica-gutter-king Music also plays a large role in Morris' films and he works closely with Michael Kauffmann and the Asthmatic Kitty label and Jeb Banner of Musical Family Tree, both located in his birth state of Indiana.
