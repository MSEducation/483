A tautochrone or isochrone curve (from Greek prefixes tauto- meaning same or iso- equal, and chrono time) is the curve for which the time taken by an object sliding without friction in uniform gravity to its lowest point is independent of its starting point.  The curve is a cycloid, and the time is equal to π times the square root of the radius over the acceleration of gravity.  The tautochrone curve is the same as the brachistochrone curve for any given starting point.

The tautochrone problem

The tautochrone problem, the attempt to identify this curve, was solved by Christiaan Huygens in 1659. He proved geometrically in his Horologium Oscillatorium, originally published in 1673, that the curve was a cycloid.
 Part II, Proposition XXV, p. 69[/ref]
This solution was later used to attack the problem of the brachistochrone curve.  Jakob Bernoulli solved the problem using calculus in a paper (Acta Eruditorum, 1690) that saw the first published use of the term integral.
The tautochrone problem was studied more closely when it was realized that a pendulum, which follows a circular path, was not isochronous and thus his pendulum clock would keep different time depending on how far the pendulum swung.  After determining the correct path, Christiaan Huygens attempted to create pendulum clocks that used a string to suspend the bob and curb cheeks near the top of the string to change the path to the tautochrone curve.  These attempts proved to not be useful for a number of reasons.  First, the bending of the string causes friction, changing the timing. Second, there were much more significant sources of timing errors that overwhelmed any theoretical improvements that traveling on the tautochrone curve helps.  Finally, the "circular error" of a pendulum decreases as length of the swing decreases, so better clock escapements could greatly reduce this source of inaccuracy.
Later, the mathematicians Joseph Louis Lagrange and Leonhard Euler provided an analytical solution to the problem.

Lagrangian solution

where the constant of proportionality has been set to 1 by changing units of length.
The differential form of this relation is
Which eliminates s, and leaves a differential equation for dx and dy. To find the solution, integrate for x in terms of y:
Which is the standard parametrization, except for the scale of x, y and θ.

"Virtual gravity" solution

Perhaps the simplest solution to the tautochrone problem is to note a direct relation between the angle of an incline and the gravity felt by a particle on the incline.  A particle on a 90° vertical incline feels the full effect of gravity, while a particle on a horizontal plane feels effectively no gravity.  At intermediate angles, the "virtual gravity" felt by the particle is g sin θ.  The first step is to find a "virtual gravity" that produces the desired behavior.
The "virtual gravity" required for the tautochrone is simply proportional to the distance remaining to be traveled, which admits a simple solution:
It can be easily verified both that this solution solves the differential equation and that a particle will reach s = 0 at time π/(2k) from any starting height A.  The problem is now to construct a curve that will produce a "virtual gravity" proportional to the distance remaining to travel, i.e., a curve that satisfies:
The explicit appearance of the distance remaining is troublesome, but we can differentiate to obtain a more manageable form:
or
This equation relates the change in the curve's angle to the change in the distance along the curve.  We now use the Pythagorean theorem, the fact that the slope of the curve is equal to the tangent of its angle, and some trigonometric identities to obtain ds in terms of dx:
Substituting this into the first differential equation lets us solve for x in terms of θ:
Likewise, we can also express dx in terms of dy and solve for y in terms of θ:

Abel's solution

Niels Henrik Abel attacked a generalized version of the tautochrone problem (Abel's mechanical problem), namely, given a function T(y) that specifies the total time of descent for a given starting height, find an equation of the curve that yields this result.  The tautochrone problem is a special case of Abel's mechanical problem when T(y) is a constant.
Making use again of the Laplace transform above, we invert the transform and conclude:
It can be shown that the cycloid obeys this equation.
