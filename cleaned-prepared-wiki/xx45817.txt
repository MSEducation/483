Caracol is the name given to a large ancient Maya archaeological site, located in what is now the Cayo District of  Belize. It is situated approximately 40 kilometres south of Xunantunich and the town of San Ignacio Cayo, and 15 kilometers away from the Macal River. It rests on the Vaca Plateau at an elevation of 500 meters above sea-level, in the foothills of the Maya Mountains. Pre-Columbian Art Research Institute, San Francisco. Long thought to be a tertiary center, it is now known that the site was one of the most important regional political centers of the Maya Lowlands during the Classic Period. Caracol covered approximately 200 square kilometers,Arlen Chase and Diane Chase 2009 Interpreting the Maya "Collapse": Continued Investigation of Residential Complexes in and near Caracol's Epicenter: 2009 Field Report of the Caracol Archaeological Project.  accessed November 20, 2011 covering an area much larger than present-day Belize City (the largest metropolitan area in the country) and supported more than twice the modern city's population.

Etymology

"Caracol" is a modern name from  "snail, shell", but more generally meaning spiral- or volute-shaped— apparently on account of the winding access road that led to the site.82)  Its ancient name has been reconstructed from the Emblem Glyph popular among its early rulers -  Ux Witz Ajaw, or "Three Hills Lord". The full name of Caracol would be "Three-Hills Water,"  read Oxwitza',Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube 2008 Chronicle of the Maya Kings and Queens, 2nd edition. Thames and Hudson, London Uxwitza' or, hispanicised, "Oxhuitza". This place name may also reference the Three Stone Place of creation.

Discovery

The site was first reported by a native logger named Rosa Mai, who came across its remains in 1937 while searching for mahogany hardwood trees to exploit. Mai reported the site to the archaeological commission for British Honduras, today Belize. In 1938 the archaeological commissioner, A. H. Anderson visited the site for two weeks along with a colleague H. B. Jex Blockley Jex - who later became Inspector of Crown Licence. It was Anderson who gave the site its modern name. They conducted preliminary surveys, noted 9 carved monuments, took notes on the structures of the A Group Plaza, and undertook limited excavations in two locations. Paper prepared for the 1st International Symposium of Maya Archaeology, San Ignacio, Cayo, Belize. May 29 - June 2, 1995 A. H. Anderson and Linton Satterthwaite later discovered 40 stone monuments.

Excavations, investigations, and modern development

The site was first noted and documented archaeologically in 1937 by A. H. Anderson. More extensive explorations and documentation of the site was undertaken by Linton Satterthwaite of the University Museum at the University of Pennsylvania from 1950 to 1953. During this time Satterthwaite primarily focused on finding and documenting monuments, later removing several stelae and altars to the University Museum. In the early 1980s, Paul Healy of Trent University investigated Caracol's core area, recording several architectural groups, and noting the extensive terrace systems and high population density for the surrounding area.
The Caracol Archaeological Project (ongoing every year since 1985) is directed by Drs. Arlen and Diane Chase of the University of Central Florida in Orlando, United States. The 1988-1989 field seasons researched the southeast section of the site, between the Conchita and Pajaro-Romonal Causeways, to determine the impact of the Tikal-Naranjo wars.

In the spring dry season of 2009 they conducted a LiDAR survey with an aircraft that allowed a very rapid assessment of the entire site and surrounds, mapping 200 square kilometers, with results published in May 2010.Mapping Ancient Civilization, in a Matter of Days, John Noble Wilford, IHT, 10 May 2010, accessed 11 May 2010
The only road Caracol may be accessed by is paved for the last ten miles and leads to the Western Highway between San Ignacio and Belmopan and to Santa Elena.
Caana ("sky-palace") is the largest building at Caracol. It remains one of the largest man-made structures in Belize.

Population

At Caracol, there are approximately 267 structures per square kilometer, 85% higher than Tikal.  The site covers approximately 200 square kilometers, and within this area, structures are generally situated equidistantly and are integrated with the terrace system. The town grew into one of the largest ancient Maya cities, covering some 177 km² with an estimated population of over 100,000 Diane Chase and Arlen Chase 1994 Studies in the Archaeology of Caracol, Belize (editors). Pre-Columbian Art Research Institute, San Francisco with settlement focused along the many radiating causeways (potentially peaking between 120,000 and up to 180,000)

History

The Caracol area was occupied as early as 1200 BC, yet occupation in the epicentral area was no earlier than 650 BC and lasted no later than AD 950.  Caracol boasts 53 carved stone monuments (25 stelae and 28 altars), and more than 250 burials and 200 caches.
By the Early Classic (between AD 250 and 550) Caracol was tied into extensive trade networks and pan-lowland ideological systems, leading to a unified regional economy Arthur Demarest 2004 Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization.  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge  The Caracol was officially founded in AD 331 (8.14.13.10.4) by Te' K'ab Chaak.  Special Deposit C117F-1, a Teotihuacan style cremation of three individuals dates precisely to this period, indicating early influences from northern Mexico Arlen Chase and Diane Chase 2010 Household Patterning, the "Collapse," and LiDAR Ground-Checks: Continued Investigation in and near Caracol's Epicenter: 2010 Field Report of the Caracol Archaeological Project.   accessed November 20, 2011.

Wars with Tikal

Caracol was at first a client state of the more powerful city of Tikal, 76 km to the northwest.  Tikal's influence weakened during the mid-sixth century; losing control of Naranjo, located halfway between the two cities (42 km from each site), to rival Calakmul.  In AD 531, Lord K'an I acceded to the throne.  Lord Water (Yajaw Te' K'inich II) acceded to power in AD 553 under the auspices of Tikal's Lord Double Bird (Wak Chan K'awiil).  Then, in AD 556 Tikal enacted a ch'ak (axe) war event, and defeated Caracol; this caused Lord Water to enact the first known star-war event in 562 (9.6.8.4.2), and defeated Tikal's Lord Wak Chan K'awiil (Double Bird).  These poorly understood star war conflicts are usually associated with long hiatuses and the fall of dynasties.  The name comes from the glyph, which shows a star (presumably Venus) pouring liquid on the earth.  This particular star-war event was the cause of the archaeologically and epigraphically demonstrated Tikal mid-Classic hiatus, which saw a decline in Tikal's population, a cessation of monument erection, and the destruction of certain monuments in the Great Plaza.  This 120 year long hiatus at Tikal occurred as Caracol's population and monumental construction increased, and the site became more prosperous and cohesive.  This event also saw Tikal take on cultural characteristics of Caracol; even with the renewed erection of monuments at Tikal, their style mimicked that of Caracol.
Yajaw Te' K'inich II passed on his throne to the eldest of his two sons, Knot Ajaw, in AD 599; his younger brother K'an II succeeded him in AD 618.  K'an II performed a ritual of alliance in Calakmul's territory the following January (9.9.5.13.8).  William Morrow and Co.  New York.  K'an II is described as the most successful Caracol ruler.  Reigning for 40 years from AD 618 to 658, he expanded the causeway system and saw an increase in the site's population.
In AD 627 (9.9.14.3.5), Lord Kan II attacked Caracol's sometime ally Naranjo in a hubi (destruction) war event.  He attacked again in 628, and sacrificed its king.  He then led a star-war against Naranjo in AD 631 (9.9.18.16.3).  He did it a fourth time in 636.  In AD 637, he celebrated his first reigning k'atun by dedicating the Hieroglyphic Stairway at Naranjo itself.

Prosperity

Beginning in AD 636, there was a building boom at Caracol at the conclusion of the Tikal-Naranjo wars.  Entering the Late Classic period, the site still demonstrated widespread cohesion.  During this time Caracol also had a unique burial pattern, focusing on multiple burials in special chambers.  Latin American Antiquity 7:61-79.  This pattern is seen spreading out through the Peten region likely controlled by Caracol, although this spread is independent of other material cultural indicators (like caching practices).  K'an II commissioned more monuments than any other ruler, and ushered in the 'golden age' of Caracol.
Twenty nine days before his death, Kan II 'witnessed' the accession of his successor, K'ahk' Ujol K'inich II on 9.11.5.14.0 – AD 658.  During K'ahk' Ujol K'inich II's reign, Caracol was defeated in a star-war event by Naranjo; his only monuments appear at La Rejolla.
Lasting from AD 702 (Stela 21) to 798 (Ballcourt Marker 3), this period lacks any hieroglyphic texts.  Archaeologically however, this period is correlated with an increase in site-wide prosperity.  After the AD 798 date, the site core is still prosperous, yet shows less cohesion between the center and outlying areas.
Warfare event credited to K'inich Joy K'awil on Stela 11 (erected AD 800), indicating the capture of eight captives; then in 800 CE, K'inich Joy K'awiil captured the lord of Ucanal.  Caana was also refinished during this period.
K'inich Toobil Yopaat's accession date is not certain (c. AD 804), but he erected five (possibly six) monuments, and seems to have repaired relations with Ucanal.  In AD 820, he enacted an axe event against Tikal.

Collapse

Evidence suggests that Caracol weathered the initial part of the Maya collapse.  Through symbolic egalitarianism, it seems that the majority of the Late Classic population had access to 'elite' material goods.  However, the transition to the Terminal Classic sees a shift away from symbolic egalitarianism, when the elite developed their own ceramic traditions and had access to goods no longer available to the populace.
The last recorded date at Caracol is AD 859 – 10.1.10.0.0, on Stele 10.  Caana's abandonment dates to approximately AD 900;Diane Chase and Arlen Chase 2003 Texts and Contexts in Maya Warfare: A brief Consideration of Epigraphy and Archaeology at Caracol, Belize.  In Ancient Mesoamerican Warfare, edited by M. K. Brown, and T. W. Stanton, pp. 171–188.  Altamira Press, Walnut Creek, California. several other structures have occupation that dates to the Terminal Classic period.  Structure A6 was abandoned in AD 1050, and marks the final abandonment of the site.

Lords of Caracol

Note that this list is not continuous, as the epigraphic record is incomplete.
Te' K'ab Chaak (Tree Branch Rain God) is the dynastic progenitor of Caracol, yet is only known from two Late Classic back dated texts. One places him at AD 331, and the second at AD 349.
K'ahk' Ujol K'inich I (also known as Ruler I, or Smoking Skull I) appears on the 6th century genealogical text of Stela 16, but his place in the line of reigning lords is unknown. His reign has been estimated to be circa AD 470. He may have been the father of Yajaw Te' K'inich I.
Yajaw Te' K'inich I acceded to rulership in AD 484 (9.2.9.0.16), and is known from Stela 13, which records his celebration of the 4th K'atun in AD 514. His monuments include Stela 13 and Altar 4. He is the father of K'an I.
K'an I (also known as Ruler II) is the son of Yajaw Te' K'inich I, and acceded his father in AD 531 – 9.4.16.13.3. In Studies in the Archaeology of Caracol, Belize, edited by Diane Z. Chase and Arlen F. Chase. Pre-Columbian Art Research Institute, San Francisco, California Stela 15 text gives his parentage statement, and tells that his accession was overseen by a 'higher authority,' either another lord or a divine being. His monuments include Stela 16 (which includes his parentage statement) and Altar 14.
Yajaw Te' K'inich II (also known as Lord Water), son of K'an I and named after his grandfather, acceded to power in AD 553 - 9.5.19.1.2. His monuments include Stelae 1, 4(?), 14, and Altars 1, 6, and 24. His first monument, Stela 14, records the K'atun ending in AD 554 (9.6.0.0.0). As told on Altar 21, Yajaw Te' K'inich II's accession takes place under the auspices of the Tikal Lord Wak Chan K'awiil. He erected Stela 1 and Altar 1 to mark his last K'atun ending of 9.8.0.0.0, and four years later he is referenced as 'seeing' the 9.8.10.0.0 ending. He is mentioned in the fragmentary text on Stela 23. In AD 562 – 9.6.8.4.2 he enacted the first recorded star war against Tikal and Lord Wak Chan K'awiil. h. Yajaw Te' K'inich II's two sons, Knot Ajaw and Kan II, rule after him.
Knot Ajaw, born in AD 575 (9.7.2.0.3), succeeded his father Yajaw Te' K'inich II in AD 599. Erected Stelae 5, 6, and 7 (?) to the west of Structure A13, as well as dedicated Altars 11(?) and 15. He was the half-brother of K'an II. 
K'an II is described as the most successful Caracol ruler. Reigning for 40 years from AD 618 to 658, he expanded the causeway system and saw an increase in the site's population. Born as Sak Witzil Baah ("White First Hill", or "White Gopher Hill") in AD 588, he took his grandfather's name at his accession. He was the half-brother of Knot Ajaw, and was thus always stressing his legitimacy by referencing his mother (who may be Batz' Ek'). It is interesting that he never references the rule of his brother Knot Ajaw in any of his monuments, even those that describe his dynastic predecessors. He also seems to have developed diplomatic contacts with the Snake polity, with whom he coordinated the war with Naranjo, which began in 626, and ended with the defeat of Naranjo in 631. His monuments include Stelae 3, 22, Altars 2, 7, 17,19, and 21, and potentially the Hieroglyphic Stairway and Panel 1 from Naranjo. 
K'ahk' Ujol K'inich II (also known as Smoking Skull II, or Ruler VI) succeeded K'an II in AD 658, but as he has no surviving parentage statements, we cannot be certain that he is K'an II's son. His only monument appears at La Rejolla, and only two stucco texts from Caana (Sturcures B16-sub and B18). One of these texts shows that in AD 680, Caracol was the victim of a star war from Naranjo (also called Naranjo's war of Independence). Martin and Grube  suggest that this action drove K'ahk' Ujol K'inich from Caracol, at which time he may have fled to La Rejolla 12 km to the northwest. The remainder of this text has not been excavated. This star war event seems to have launched Caracol's epigraphic hiatus, which continues for 96 years, until AD 798.
Ruler VII reigned during the epigraphic hiatus, and erected only one stela (Stela 21) dated to AD 702 (9.13.10.0.0). One candidate for this ruler comes from Naj Tunich, some 46 km to the south. In one of the cave's chambers dated to AD 692 is a text referring to a Caracol elite named Tz'ayaj K'ajk', who carries the emblem glyph, but not the k'inich ajaw prefix.
Tum Yohl K'inich (also called Ruler VIII) is as enigmatic as Ruler VII. He likewise appears in the Naj Tunich, and also lacks the k'inich ajaw prefix, leaving his royal status in question. In this text, he performs a fire-bearing ritual under the supervision of a lord of Ixkun; an unnamed lord of Calakmul is also involved. All other appearances of his name occur in later retrospective texts like Altar 23, which lists him as a 3 K'atun lord, and the captor of two lords from Ucanal and Bital.
K'inich Joy K'awiil began a revival of the Caracol polity with his accession in AD 799 (9.18.9.5.9). He commissioned the B-Group Ballcourt, the markers of which date back to the dynastic founder Te' K'ab Chaak. Stela 11 shows Tum Yohl K'inich in an ambiguous relationship to Joy K'awiil, which may show that he is the latter's father, or as suggested by Altar 23 potentially a relative in a high-ranking military position. 
K'inich Toobil Yopaat's (also known as Ruler X and XI) accession date is not certain, but he erected five (possibly six) monuments (**Stelae 18, 19, Altars 12, 13), and seems to have repaired relations with Ucanal. This new relationship is depicted on Altars 12 and 13, as well as on stucco text from Structure B18.
K'an III is little known, and he erected three monuments.
Ruler XIII is the last known lord of Caracol, and erected only one monument: Stela 10. Stela 10 is a carved all glyphic monument which may commemorate the half-K'atun 10.1.10.0.0 (AD 859).
