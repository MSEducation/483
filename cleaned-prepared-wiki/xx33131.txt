Fraggle Rock (also known as Jim Henson's Fraggle Rock or Fraggle Rock with Jim Henson's Muppets) is a children's live action puppet television series created by Jim Henson with the central characters being a set of Muppet creatures called Fraggles.
Fraggle Rock was co-produced by British television company Television South (TVS), the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, U.S. pay television service Home Box Office and Henson Associates. Unlike Sesame Street, which had been created for a single market and only later adapted for international markets, Fraggle Rock was intended from the start to be an international production and the whole show was constructed with this in mind.

History

Fraggle Rock debuted in 1983 as one of the first shows involving the collaboration of Henson International Television (HIT Entertainment from 1989), the international arm of Jim Henson Productions and of Deluxe Digital Studios. The co-production brought together British regional ITV franchise-holder Television South (TVS), CBC Television, United States pay-television service Home Box Office and Henson Associates (later Jim Henson Productions). Filming took place on a Toronto sound-stage (and later at Elstree Studios, London). The avant-garde poet bpNichol worked as one of the show's writers. In the early days of development, the script called the Fraggles "Woozles" pending the devising of a more suitable name.
Henson described the Fraggle Rock series as "a high-energy, raucous musical romp. It's a lot of silliness. It's wonderful."[ref]Random House, 1993. Jim Henson The Works: The Art, The Magic, The Imagination
[/ref] While the program proved accessible to audiences of all ages, it used the fantasy creatures as an allegory to deal with serious issues such as prejudice, spirituality, personal identity, the environment, and social conflict.[ref]

In 2009, as part of the Jim Henson Foundation's donation of puppets to the Center for Puppetry Arts, the Atlanta museum displayed many of the original puppet characters from Fraggle Rock in their exhibition Jim Henson: Wonders from his Workshop."Center for Puppetry Artsâ€”Jim Henson: Wonders From His Workshop"

International co-productions

The producers made the series with the intention of it airing in various forms internationally. That concept grew out of Duncan Kenworthy's experience adapting Sesame Street to the requirements of foreign markets. The human "wraparound" segments were produced separately in several countries, with the intention that the child viewer would always be able to relate to the world of the program. The series has appeared now in over ten countries and languages. The head producer was Wesley James Tomlinson.

Setting

There are 3 main intelligent antropomorfic species in the Fraggle Rock environment: Fraggles, Doozers and Gorgs. The Fraggles and Doozers live in a system of natural caves called Fraggle Rock that are filled with all manner of creatures and features, and which seem to connect to at least two different worlds (the one of the Gorgs and the one of the "silly creatures" or humans). One of the main themes of the series is that, although the 3 species depend on the other for their survival they usually fail to communicate due to vast differences in their biology and culture. The series mainly follows the adventures of five Fraggles (Gobo, Mokey, Red, Wembley, and Boober) with distinct personalities.

Fraggles

Fraggles are small anthropomorphic creatures, about  tall, that come in a wide variety of colors and have tails that bear a tuft of fur on the end. Fraggles live a very carefree life, spending most of their time playing, exploring, and generally enjoying themselves. They live on a diet of vegetables (mainly radishes) and Doozer sticks. The doozer sticks are made of ground up radishes and are the material that the doozers use to build their constructions.

Doozers

Within Fraggle Rock lives a second species of small humanoid creatures, the pudgy green ant-like Doozers. Standing only  tall, Doozers are in a sense anti-Fraggles; their lives are dedicated to work and industry. Doozers spend much of their time busily constructing all manner of pointless scaffolding throughout Fraggle Rock, using miniature construction equipment and wearing hardhats and work boots. To ensure that they always have a steady stream of work to do, Doozers build their constructions out of an edible candy-like substance (manufactured from radishes) which is greatly enjoyed by Fraggles. This is essentially the only interaction between Doozers and Fraggles; Doozers spend most of their time building, and Fraggles spend much of their time eating tasty Doozer buildings. They thus form an odd sort of symbiosis.

Gorgs

Outside another exit from Fraggle Rock lives a small family of Gorgs, giant furry humanoids standing 22 feet (7 m.) tall. The husband and wife of the family consider themselves the King and Queen of the Universe, with their son Junior Gorg as its prince and heir, but to all appearances they are really simple farmers with a rustic house and garden patch.
Fraggles are considered a pest by the Gorgs, as they steal their radishes, that they need to make a potion in order not to vanish.

The Silly Creatures of Outer Space

In the North American version and in the German version of Fraggle Rock, the connection between Fraggle Rock and Outer Space is a small hole in the wall of the workshop of an eccentric inventor called Doc, and Gobo must go out into Doc's workshop to retrieve the postcards of his uncle Matt, who is exploring the human's world, from the wastebasket where Doc throws them. Doc is unaware of the Fraggles' existence.

Since then a lot more research has taken place which confirmed a lot episodes actually exist, but not the full 95 which were made.  HIT Entertainment has tried unsuccessfully to locate the missing episodes, including extensive enquiries with The Jim Henson Company both in the UK and the US.  When UK television channels wish to broadcast the show, they are forced to use US versions; such was the case with Boomerang in 2007.

Feature film

In May 2008 it was announced that The Weinstein Company would be distributing the Fraggle Rock movie. The film was written as a live-action musical by Cory Edwards, who would also direct. The film was to be produced by The Jim Henson Company; Ahmet Zappa was executive producing along with Brian Inerfeld. The film would involve all of the core characters from the series. The story would take the characters "outside of their home in Fraggle Rock, where they interact with humans, which they think are aliens."Weinsteins roll with 'Fraggle Rock' Karen Prell and Dave Goelz were slated to return for the film as Red Fraggle, Boober Fraggle, and Uncle Traveling Matt, respectively.
However in 2011, Weinstein's deal with Henson had expired leaving production of the film in doubt. It was also announced that the Scissor Sisters would write music for the film, making the film possible. In October 2011 New Regency acquired the rights to the movie to be produced by The Jim Henson Company and The Montecito Picture Company. New Regency (the company behind Alvin and the Chipmunks movies) and the producers are currently in discussion whether to use puppets or CGI as well as a mix of live action. Once this has been decided they will look to a writer for the movie. According to Cory Edwards' blog, Gerry Parkes will not reprise his role as Doc, the American human character, for the movie.
Due to the death of puppeteer Jerry Nelson after The Muppets (2011), Gobo Fraggle will likely be recast. In recent appearances, Gobo has been performed by John Tartaglia.

Music

Music played a central part in Fraggle Rock. Every episode featured two or three original songs co-written by Canadian poet Dennis Lee and Philip Balsam, as well as incidental music. Several episodes (usually involving Cantus and the Minstrels) focused primarily on musicâ€”such as Red Fraggle's attempt to find "her song" for the Fraggle Medley, or the effect of music on the breaking of winter or the presence of light in Fraggle Rock.
The "Fraggle Rock Theme" reached number 33 on the British music charts during the phenomenon. Writers included Jim Henson, Jerry Juhl, and Jocelyn Stevenson, with songs by Philip Balsam and Dennis Lee.
