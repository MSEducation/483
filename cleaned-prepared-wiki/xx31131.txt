Emilio Butragueño Santos (; born 22 July 1963) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a striker.
He was best known for his spell with Real Madrid. Nicknamed El Buitre (The Vulture), he was a member of the legendary Quinta del Buitre, along with Manolo Sanchís, Rafael Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza.
Butragueño amassed La Liga totals of 341 games and 123 goals for his main club, in 12 seasons, and represented the Spanish national team in two World Cups (being the second top scorer in the 1986 edition) and as many European Championships, scoring 26 international goals for his country for a record that stood several years.

Club career

In 1981, skilled Butragueño joined hometown's Real Madrid's youth system, playing first for its reserve side before being given his senior debut by Alfredo Di Stéfano on 5 February 1984 against Cádiz CF: he made an instant impact, scoring twice and assisting for the third goal in a 3–2 away turnaround, after Real trailed by 0–2.Final de infarto en Cádiz (Mad finale in Cádiz); El Mundo Deportivo, 6 February 1984 
At the time, Real Madrid's form was so patchy that first team's attendances were poorer than the reserve side ones. 
In June 1995, having lost his influence in the Real Madrid side (only eight games and one goal, as the club won another league), mainly due to the emergence of 17-year-old Raúl, Butragueño signed for Club Celaya in Mexico and, in his first year, the team reached the final of the national championship. After three seasons where he was known as the Gentleman of the Pitch – never received a single red card during his entire career – he finally decided to retire from the game in April 1998.
