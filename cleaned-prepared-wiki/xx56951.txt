History

On April 17, 1968 three "local service" airlines in the western U.S. merged to form Air West:
The initial Air West fleet included Boeing 727-100s, Douglas DC-9s, F-27s, and Piper Navajos.  The first new type was a Douglas DC-9-30 that had been ordered by Bonanza Air Lines. Hughes Airwest became an all-jet airline around 1979 with Boeing 727-200s and DC-9s and merged with Republic Airlines in 1980.
Hungry for another adventure in the airline industry, TWA's former owner Howard Hughes sought the airline in 1968, The airline was renamed Hughes Air West and its call sign became "Hughes Air." It expanded to several cities in the western United States, Canada and Mexico. With the new yellow paint scheme, unveiled 28 September 1971, the airline began calling itself Hughes Airwest, two words.
The airline participated in some movies in the 1970s, most notably The Gauntlet with Clint Eastwood and Sondra Locke in 1977. Eastwood's character arrives in Las Vegas from Phoenix on the airline and when he later phones the airport for flight departure times, Locke's character sarcastically called the airline, "Air Worst."
Like other local service airlines in the 1970s, Hughes Airwest eliminated many stops and opened longer routes. Service expanded to resorts in Mexico; domestic routes didn't reach east of Utah and Arizona until Denver, Des Moines, Milwaukee, and Houston Hobby Airport were added in 1978.
In September 1979 the airline was grounded for two months by a walkout by their ticket agents, reservations  handlers, and office employees, who had been without a contract for over a year.
Republic was acquired by Northwest Airlines in 1986, which merged into Delta Air Lines in 2010.

Corporate affairs

The headquarters were originally in two buildings in downtown San Mateo County, California.
Its new headquarters were located in San Mateo. Standard & Poor's Corporation, 1976. p. 638. "Hughes Air Corp d/b/a Hughes Airwest Airlines, 3125 Clearview Way, San Mateo, Cal." The airline scheduled the move to a new headquarters from Thursday August 25, 1973 to August 28, 1973. The complex was on a hill overlooking San Mateo and San Francisco. The airline planned to move in two departments from the offices at San Francisco International Airport: flight control and reservations."'Big Move' under way to new international headquarters in San Mateo."

Livery

Hughes Airwest's planes were recognizable by their banana-yellow fuselage and tail colors."  The blue has sometimes been described as purple, but this is an optical illusion when viewed on the yellow expanse of aircraft hull.  Since these were not standards-compliant color names, the exact color values are uncertain, and can only be approximated by examining color photographs of Hughes Airwest aircraft. Their airplanes were often dubbed "flying bananas" and the airline launched an advertising campaign with the catchphrase "Top Banana in the West."
 Most nicknames given to Hughes Airwest airplanes in aviation books and magazines have to do with bananas. Apart from their all-yellow scheme, the airplanes also featured a blue logo on the vertical stabilizer (tail) that resembled three diamonds connected (possibly a reference to the initials of Howard Hughes). The name Hughes Airwest, in stylized lettering, was featured unconventionally below the front passenger windows.
This livery was devised by the southern California design firm of Mario Armond Zamparelli, following the crash of Flight 706 in June 1971, caused by a mid-air collision with a U.S. Marine Corps F-4B jet fighter near Duarte, California.
After the sale in October 1980 the all-yellow paint scheme was gradually replaced by Republic's white with blue and green trim, and the mallard "Herman the Duck."
