Missile Support Area

The Missile Support Area included offices and a Telecommunication (TELCO) Room with 2 SAGE Digital Data Receivers and a Digital Data Transmitter for communicating missiles' status to the remote launch control center in New Jersey.

Interceptor Missile Squadron Operations Center

The Interceptor Missile Squadron Operations Center (IMSOC) in the A & M Shop next to the TELCO Room was connected to the "Coaxial Distribution System" for communicating with Electrical Launching Equipment (ELE) in each Launcher Shelter's equipment room.  The IMSOC used the "Prelaunch Command System" with a Squadron Supervisor's Station in the IMSOC that included "a desk-type console" with manual controls for acknowledging SAGE "alert orders and other commands".  The console controlled missile warm-up (e.g., 2 minutes for IM-99A rocket fuel by a remote Senior Director's keyed console (fire button) at the launch control center]] (Weapons Director room) at McGuire DC-01, which also was the launch control center for the missile complex on Fort Dix.  The console then displayed whether the missile transitioned to the "Launch" or "Malfunction" stage, which determined the subsequent squadron operation needed at the Launcher Shelter (checkout of the empty shelter or deactivation of the faulty missile).
