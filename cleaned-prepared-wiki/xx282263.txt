Sveti Srdj (

Location

Sveti Srdj emerged near the Benedictine Shirgj Monastery, an abbey dedicated to Sergius and Bacchus, and built in the 11th century. Due to its favorable geographical position near the mouth of river Bojana this new market soon became a small populated place which significance surpassed many bigger towns of the region.

History

Since the reign of Stefan Nemanja in the Serbian Grand Principality 
In 1330 near Sveti Srdj, the King of Serbia Stefan Dečanski met with envoys of Dubrovnik who congratulated him for his victory in the Battle of Velbazhd. On that occasion Dečanski asked them to support his military campaigns with 6 galleys.
A peace treaty signed in Sveti Srdj in 1423 ended the Second Scutari War waged between Serbian Despotate (initially Zeta) and Venetian Republic over Scutari and other former possessions of Zeta controlled by Venice. This treaty is known as the Peace of Sveti Srdj.
In 1479 Ottomans captured the remaining part of the region of northern Albania and this market soon became deserted.
