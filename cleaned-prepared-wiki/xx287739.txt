Reception

Critical reception

Seven has so far received favourable reviews. TheGayUK's Chris Jones said: "Finally, after 10 long years, she's back - but by god, it was worth the wait. Seven, Lisa's seventh album, gives us 10 tracks that make you cry, make you dance and make you glad you have ears!." The Daily Express's Stephen Unwin said: "And after a hiatus of almost 10 years, Lisa is back. Late 2012 saw her dipping her toes in with a few sell-out, intimate UK gigs, just to let everyone know that the voice is still spine-tingling, and to showcase a few tracks from this comeback album which are more-ishly good."

Commercial performance

Seven debuted in mid-February 2014 at number thirteen in Uk and Germany , number twenty-five in Austria, number thirty-two in Czech Republic and number forty-two in Switzerland.
