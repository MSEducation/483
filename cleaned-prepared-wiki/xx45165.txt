History

Iveco was incorporated on January 1, 1975, with the merger of five different brands: Fiat Veicoli Industriali (with headquarters in Turin, Italy), OM (Brescia, Italy), Lancia Veicoli Speciali (Italy), Unic (France) and Magirus-Deutz (Germany).   
Following the merger, the newly founded Iveco began rationalizing its product range, manufacturing plants and sales network, while keeping the original brands. From 1975 to 1979, the Iveco range included 200 basic models and 600 versions spanning from 2.7 tons of GVW for a light vehicle to over 40 tons for heavy vehicles, not to mention buses and engines. The world of Transport, 1994 Norden Publishing House Ltd. – p. 144  
In 1978 Iveco launched the first product in the range of light vehicles branded Iveco, the Daily.fiatindustrial.pdf – p. 103 The product was originally conceived as a small industrial vehicle, reliable and structurally sound. 
In 1980 Iveco built the first turbo diesel engine for heavy industrial vehicles. 28–29  
In the 1980s the corporate strategy was heavily oriented towards brand promotion and led to the sponsorisation of sports events, such as the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, the Davis Cup in 1982, the Jacques Cousteau expeditions in the Amazon basin in 1983 and the Raid Pigafetta, during which the Iveco-Fiat 75 PC 4x4 was first to make a full circle of the globe. The world of Transport, 1994 Norden Publishing House Ltd. – p. 188-193 Two new divisions were also formed: bus diesel engines and firefighting vehicles. The world of Transport, 1994 Norden Publishing House Ltd. – p. 204  
In 1984 Iveco launched the TurboStar,John Carroll, Peter James Davies: Tractor & Trucks, 2007 Hermes House – p. 7 a heavy on-road vehicle  that became a best-seller in Italy and an important player in the European market, reaching a total of 50,000 units sold in seven years. The world of Transport, 1994 Norden Publishing House Ltd. – p. 202  
In 1985 Iveco made the first light diesel engine with direct injection.com/it-IT/group/history/iveco/Pagine/iveco_1985_1994.aspx  
From 1986, Iveco S.p.A. held a 52% stake in Iveco Ford Truck Ltd, a joint venture (and effectively a merger) with Ford of Europe's truck division. Ford plants took over production and sales of the major vehicles in the Iveco range and continued production of the Ford Cargo. 408  
In the mid-1980s, Astra, which produces dumpers and construction site/quarry vehicles in Piacenza, became part of Iveco Group. 11  
In 1989 the first diesel engine with EGR to reduce polluting emissions compatible with commercial vehicles was produced and the new Daily launched that same year was fitted with it. 408  
In 1990, the group purchased 60% control of the Spanish industrial company ENASA, which owned the industrial vehicle builder Pegaso. 408  
In the 1990s, the EuroCargo, EuroTech, EuroTrakker and EuroStar vehicles represented a total facelift for the range. 408 The EuroCargo and the EuroTech were named "Truck of the Year" in 1992 and 1993 respectively and, for the first time, this recognition was awarded to the same manufacturer for two years in a row. 146 – 147  
In 1991, the English company Seddon Atkinson was purchased and brought its long heritage of special vehicles for the construction and garbage collection industries. 10  
That same year, the first TurboDaily assembly line was inaugurated at the Nanjing Motor Corporation in China. The world of Transport, 1994 Norden Publishing House Ltd. – p. 230  
In 1992, Iveco took over the primary constructor of industrial vehicles in Australia to form Ital, originally called International Trucks Australia and, in 2001, Iveco Trucks Australia Limited. 10  
In 1995 Iveco signed an agreement with Yuejin Motor Corporation of Nanjing to form the Naveco joint venture for the production of light vehicles and diesel engines. In the meantime, the firefighting vehicles division signed an agreement with Sinopec Group for the assembly of special vehicles with foam extinguishers in China.
In 1996 firefighting activities in Germany were structured under the company Iveco Magirus Brandschutztechnik GmbH.com/it-IT/group/history/iveco/Pagine/iveco_1995_2004.Massimo Condolo: IVECO 1975–2005, 2005 Fondazione Negri – p. 10 The Italian plant in Foggia broke the record of 2.5 million engines produced in 20 years, and in 1999, the production of diesel powertrains reached its highest volume of 405,000 units. 
In 1998 Cursor 8 came out, followed the next year by Cursor 10, the first diesel engine with a variable geometry turbine and the first common rail diesel engine for heavy industrial vehicles.com/it-IT/group/history/iveco/Pagine/iveco_1995_2004. 430 was celebrated together with the delivery of the five-thousandth Magirus aerial ladder produced since the Second World War.com/it-IT/group/history/iveco/Pagine/iveco_1995_2004.aspx  
In 2003 Iveco entirely bought out Irisbus, originally part of a joint venture with Renault. 151  
In 2004 Iveco Motors brand was born, which became an umbrella for the production of engines, and the following year it was incorporated into the newly founded Fiat Powertrain Technologies. At the end of 2004, the agreement between Iveco and the Chinese company Saic (Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation) took effect.fptindustrial.pdf  
In 2006 Iveco sponsored the Olympic Games in Turin with a fleet of 1,200 Iveco Irisbus buses.fiatspa.ing.

Innovation and sustainability projects

Social responsibility

Iveco has been working together with Transaid since 2005, an international non-profit organisation from England. In 2011 it donated several Stralis 4x2 to the National Institute of Transport of Dar El Salam in Tanzania, which were used in training heavy vehicle drivers with the objective of lowering the fatality rate on the roads of Sub-Saharan Africa.fiatindustrial.pdf – p. 173  
Iveco also sponsors a technological laboratory dedicated to industrial vehicles called TechPro2, in association with CNOS-FAP (national centre of Salesian works – training for professional updating).fiatindustrial.pdf

Eco-dealer in Brazil

In 2011 Iveco inaugurated its first eco-sustainable dealership in Brazil. The headquarters of the new "Jundiaí Mercalf" dealership are in Jundiaí, approximately 80 km from São Paulo, in an area that lends itself to the collection of sunlight for energy production. A special roof covering with a layer of grass laid over several layers of recycled material and one layer of asphalt can lower the temperature inside the showroom by six degrees. The roof is also equipped with special tubes for channeling and collecting rainwater.fiatindustrial.pdf – p. 111

Sustainable mobility

=Euro VI Engines with SCR Technology=

Iveco engines from the Cursor and Tector ranges observe the upcoming Euro VI standardsFiat Industrial 2011 Sustainability Report  76 by adopting High Efficiency SCR (HI-eSCR) technology.fiatindustrial.pdf – p.28 This technology optimises the processes of exhaust combustion and after-treatment, reducing consumption and enabling achievement of greater efficiency in the conversion of NOx emissions.fiatindustrial.pdf – p. 75

=Electric drive=

Iveco developed and built the first Daily with electric propulsion in 1986;Raffaele Sanguineti, Carlo Felice Zampini Salazar: IVECO Story. The world of Transport, 1994 Norden Publishing House Ltd. – p. 330 later the range was broadened to include trucks and city buses. 143 Iveco introduced the New Daily with electric propulsion and zero exhaust emissions in which a battery system powers an electric three-phase asynchronous engine – through the aid of an inverter – in charge of moving the vehicle directly and recovering energy during braking.fiatindustrial.pdf – p. 81  
The vehicle runs on two to four batteries made with Na/NiCl2 (Sodium-nickel chlorine) technology at a nominal voltage of 278 Volt.fiatindustrial.pdf – p. 81 The maximum velocity is electronically limited to 70 km/h and the vehicle does from 90 to 130 km on a fully charged battery, depending on the number of batteries and the mission.fiatindustrial.pdf – p. 81

=Diesel-electric parallel hybrid traction=

The parallel hybrid solution incorporates both a Diesel engine and an electric engine that can be used individually or simultaneously, which makes for greater operating flexibility and allows the vehicle to work under both urban and non-urban conditions.fiatindustrial.aspx
In 2010 Iveco introduced this technology on the Eurocargo Ibrido, a commercial vehicle for the European market with electri-diesel parallel propulsion for distributing and collecting goods in city centres. The payload capacity decreases by 200 kg in comparison to diesel-engine models, but it is possible to save up to 30% on the urban cycle.fiatindustrial.pdf – p. 82   Iveco Official website  
The Eurocargo hybrid range is made up of two versions:

=Diesel-electric series traction hybrid for people transport=

Iveco has been active in this sector since 1990 with 6, 7, 4 and 12 metre buses for urban transportation. The series hybrid technology features a diesel engine – smaller than that of a traditional vehicle – that acts as a battery charger. The world of Transport, 1994 Norden Publishing House Ltd. – p. 216-217

=CNG – Compressed Natural Gas=

Iveco's range of light, medium and heavy vehicles and buses can run on methane. 
Methane makes it possible to save on consumption by 38% per kg transported as compared to that consumed by diesel engines for the same payload and distance travelled. In addition, compared to Euro VI diesel engines, methane engines reduce NOx emissions by approximately 60% and particulates emissions by approximately 70%. 166

=LNG – Liquefied Natural Gas=

In April 2012 Iveco presented its first vehicle with this technology, the Stralis LNG.
As opposed to vehicles with CNG technology, LNG technology takes the vehicle farther on a full tank (up to 750 km) and reduces the vehicle's tare thus increasing the load. The main difference between the two technologies lies in the type of natural gas storage employed, which in this case is kept in a liquid state at −125 °C in cryogenic tanks; it is then heated in a heat exchanger so that once it reaches the engine it is a gas.fiatindustrial.pdf – p. 51 Also, the noise emitted decreases by 3 to 6 decibels over an analogous diesel engine vehicle.iveco.aspx

=Iveco Trakker Bifuel – diesel-ethanol prototype=

Iveco created the first prototype of a bifuel, diesel and ethanol-run vehicle. The technology was developed by Iveco together with FPT Industrial and Bosch.fiatindustrial.pdf – p. 80 The prototype uses a Trakker truck with Common Rail Cursor 9 engine with 360 HPFiat Industrial 2011 Sustainability Report  80 that may be powered by a 40–60% ethanol-diesel blend.biofuelsdigest. 
In 2011, this prototype earned Iveco the "Prêmio Top Etanol" – for the alternative fuel technology.fiatindustrial.pdf – p. 80

Heating and air-conditioning systems

A prototype of a heat pump system for electric and hybrid vehicles was installed on the Iveco Daily vehicle. The system cools or heats the passenger compartment by transferring low temperature heat generated by the drive systems. At the same time, the control strategies minimise the energy demand in order to achieve a low impact on consumption.ice-project.upv.pdf
