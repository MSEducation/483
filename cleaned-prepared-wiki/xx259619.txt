History

The earliest organized group of Japanese emigrants settled in Mexico in 1897.  Gosei is a term used in these geographic areas outside of Japan.  Gosei characterizes the child of at least one Yonsei (fourth generation) parent.  Differences among these national Gosei developed because of the varying historical processes throuogh which their Japanese emigrant forebears became Nikkei. (2006).
