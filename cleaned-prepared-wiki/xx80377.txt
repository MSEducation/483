History

On October 31, 1918, an extension of the Daegu Line reached Pohang. from Busanjin to Pohang.

Upgrade

As of 2010, most of the line remains single-track and unelectrified. The entire line is to be upgraded to an electrified-double-tracked railway.

=Busan-Ulsan=

Planning for the upgrading of the line started in 1990 already, with the primary aim to improve commuter traffic; construction started in June 2003. Korea Rail Network Authority, Busan, and Ulsan city government is undertaking the upgrade. As of 2010, construction progress reached 32% of the total budget of 2,268.9 billion won. The completion of the upgrade is foreseen for 2015.
On September 1, 2010, the South Korean government announced a strategic plan to reduce travel times from Seoul to 95% of the country to under 2 hours by 2020. As part of the plan, the Busan-Ulsan section of the Donghae Nambu Line is to be further upgraded for 230 km/h.

=Ulsan–Gyeongju–Pohang=

The line is to be replaced by a completely new alignment that circumvents downtown Gyeongju and connects to the Gyeongbu High Speed Railway at Singyeongju Station.  Under the government's 2010 strategic plan for 2020, the Ulsan–Pohang section is to be further upgraded for 230 km/h.

=Pohang–Samcheok extension=

At the time of thawing relations between South and North Korea, when the cross-border section of the Donghae Bukbu Line was reopened in 2007, the South Korean government considered the construction of a railway for freight traffic all along the east coast to the North Korean border.  Under the government's 2010 strategic plan for 2020, the Pohang–Samcheok extension is to be further upgraded for 230 km/h.

Services

The line sees passenger and freight traffic. As of October 2010, from Bujeon Station in Busan, cross-country Mugunghwa-ho trains travel in around 1 hour 25 minutes to Ulsan and in around 2 hours 40 minutes to Pohang.  Via the Gyeongbu, Daegu and Jungang Lines, Pohang and Ulsan are connected to Seoul with both intercity Saemaul-ho and cross-country Mugunghwa-ho services. As of 2010, the shortest travel times from Seoul to Pohang are around 5 hours 15 minutes by direct Saemaul service and around 3 hours 40 minutes with transfer to KTX trains at Dongdaegu.
After its upgrade is finished, the role of the line as a corridor for freight traffic will be enhanced.

Plans foresee direct KTX high-speed train service from Seoul to Pohang and Ulsan after the completion of the upgrades. From 2015, direct KTX trains are to reach Pohang from Seoul in 1 hour 50 minutes, cutting 33 minutes from the travel time with transfer at Singyeongju.  Under the government's 2010 strategic plan for 2020, the entire line may see KTX service.
