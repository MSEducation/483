The Tar River suffered the worst flooding, exceeding 500-year flood levels along its lower stretches; it crested  Due to the heavy flooding in downtown Greenville, the East Carolina Pirates were forced to relocate their football game against #9 Miami to N.C. State's Carter-Finley Stadium in Raleigh, where they beat the Hurricanes 27-23.
The Neuse River, Roanoke River, Waccamaw River, and New River exceeded 500-year flood levels, although damage was lower in these areas (compared to the Tar River) because of lower population densities. Because most of the Cape Fear River basin was west of the peak rainfall areas, the city of Wilmington was spared the worst flooding despite having the highest localized rainfall; however, the Northeast Cape Fear River (a tributary) did exceed 500-year flood levels. Of the state's eastern rivers, only the Lumber River escaped catastrophic flooding.
Rainfall and strong winds affected many homes across the state, destroying 7,000, leaving 17,000 uninhabitable, and damaging 56,000. Ten thousand people resided in temporary shelters following the storm. The extensive flooding resulted in significant crop damage. As quoted by North Carolina Secretary of Health and Human Services H. David Bruton, "Nothing since the Civil War has been as destructive to families here. The recovery process will be much longer than the water-going-down process." Around 31,000 jobs were lost from over 60,000 businesses through the storm, causing nearly $4 billion (1999 USD, $4.7 billion 2006 USD) in lost business revenue.
In contrast to the problems eastern North Carolina experienced, much of the western portion of the state remained under a severe drought.
 

Virginia

As in North Carolina, Floyd produced torrential rainfall in the most eastern portions of Virginia, amounting to a peak of 

Mid-Atlantic

By the time Floyd hit the shore, it was significantly weaker than it was at sea, due to the collapsing of its concentric eyes. This had little effect on the inland damage caused by the storm, however, and Floyd produced torrential rains and high winds throughout the Mid-Atlantic as far north as New York City and Long Island.
Chestertown, Maryland, reported a maximum rainfall total of  USD) throughout the state. In addition, over 250,000 residents were without electricity because of high winds blowing down power lines.
Rainfall amounts peaked at 
Bound Brook, New Jersey, and neighboring South Bound Brook, were especially hard hit by a record flooding event: a 
Manville, New Jersey was hit nearly as hard, with record-breaking floods coming from the Raritan River and the nearby Millstone River, which join in Manville. Manville's flooding was also exacerbated by the Delaware-Raritan Canal, a section of which runs parallel to the Millstone River and, for a stretch, are only separated by several feet (a runner's path). Princeton University in Princeton, NJ, for several days declared municipal tap water unsafe to drink, advised students in dorms not to shower, and provided bottled drinking water.
The Rochelle Park, New Jersey hub of Electronic Data Systems was inundated by the nearby Saddle River, disrupting service to as many as 8,000 ATMs across the United States.

In New York, over 10 inches of rain triggered mudslides on the bluffs overlooking the Hudson River near the Tappan Zee Bridge.

New England

Floyd caused large power outages and flood damage across New England, with over 

Canada

The remnants of Floyd continued into Canada entering the Canadian Hurricane Centre's area of responsibility on the evening and regional offices in Quebec and Atlantic Canada on September 16. Floyd became an extratropical low pressure system gradually losing strength and accelerating in the upper flow. In general, winds were below 


In the Maritime provinces, waves reached  Rain caused some damages to crops.

Aftermath

Criticism of FEMA

The Hurricane Floyd disaster was followed by what many judged to be a very slow federal response. Fully three weeks after the storm hit, Jesse Jackson complained to FEMA Director James Lee Witt on his CNN program Both Sides Now, "It seemed there was preparation for Hurricane Floyd, but then came Flood Floyd. Bridges are overwhelmed, levees are overwhelmed, whole towns under water ... it's an awesome scene of tragedy. So there's a great misery index in North Carolina." Witt responded, "We're starting to move the camper trailers in. It's been so wet it's been difficult to get things in there, but now it's going to be moving very quickly. And I think you're going to see a—I think the people there will see a big difference within this next weekend!"

Ecological effects

Runoff from the hurricane created significant problems for the ecology of North Carolina's rivers and sounds.
In the immediate aftermath of the storm, freshwater runoff, sediment, and decomposing organic matter caused salinity and oxygen levels in Pamlico Sound and its tributary rivers to drop to nearly zero. This raised fears of massive fish and shrimp kills, as had happened after Hurricane Fran and Hurricane Bonnie, and the state government responded quickly to provide financial aid to fishing and shrimping industries. Strangely, however, the year's shrimp and crab harvests were extremely prosperous; one possible explanation is that runoff from Hurricane Dennis caused marine animals to begin migrating to saltier waters, so they were less vulnerable to Floyd's ill effects.
Pollution from runoff was also a significant fear. Numerous pesticides were found in low but measurable quantities in the river waters, particularly in the Neuse River. Overall, however, the concentration of contaminants was slightly lower than had been measured in Hurricane Fran, likely because Floyd simply dropped more water to dilute them.

Hog Waste Water Contamination

When the hurricane hit North Carolina, it flooded hog waste lagoons and released 25 million gallons of manure into the New River, which contaminated the water supply and cause widespread death of aquatic life.

Retirement

Because of the hurricane's destruction in North Carolina and elsewhere in the United States, the name Floyd was retired by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2000, and it will never again be used for another future Atlantic hurricane. The name was replaced with Franklin in the 2005 season, which was not retired that season.
