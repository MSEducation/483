By providing dynamic opportunities to diverse audiences, MP+D supports and cultivates engagement, participation and innovation in the performing arts.

History

More than sixty years ago, Russell Hartley started a private collection in his home with the purpose of collecting and preserving material documenting the history of dance. Mr. Hartley, who was both a dancer and costume designer for the San Francisco Ballet in the 1940s and 1950s, searched second-hand shops, traveled to Europe to purchase dance artifacts, and in 1947, established the San Francisco Dance Archives. As the collection grew, it expanded to include all of the performing arts and in 1975 moved into a branch of the San Francisco public library system as the Archives for the Performing Arts. In 1983, the growing collection was moved to the Opera House, giving the collection   for storage. At his passing, Mr. Hartley bequeathed his collection to the Archives. At that time, a board was developed and 2 full-time professional staff laid the groundwork toward the creation of an institution.
In 1989, the collection was moved to a larger facility in the Civic Center area. "Performing Arts Library for the West" The New York Times. November 27, 1989. The facility underwent extensive renovation to accommodate the collection, and, at the same time, the organization took a new name: the San Francisco Performing Arts Library & Museum (SFPALM).  SFPALM's new home enabled the organization to have onsite exhibitions and to hold lectures, classes, and special events.  The collection continued to grow, and in 1999, SFPALM moved to the Veterans Building in the San Francisco War Memorial and Performing Arts Center. "Performing Arts Library in New Home, Seeking Boss" San Francisco Chronicle. July 31, 1999. This larger space better accommodated the growing collection, expanded staff, and ever increasing number of researchers using its resources.
In 2007, on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the organization changed its name to the Museum of Performance + Design to more accurately reflect the organization's growing mission. "Leah Garchik" San Francisco Chronicle. October 21, 2007. In the summer of 2013, the Veterans Building was closed for seismic upgrading and renovation,Whiting, Sam. "War Memorial Boiler Room Going Dark" SFGate. May 31, 2013. and after an extensive search, the Museum moved to its current south of Market location on Folsom Street near the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. "Portrait of the Cuban School of Ballet" San Francisco Chronicle. July 11, 2013. The organization continues to collect, preserve, and make available to the public its collection of 3.5 million items and its programs documenting the diverse cultural legacy of the performing arts in the Bay Area and beyond.
The Museum of Performance + Design is an independent nonprofit organization that relies on a variety of funding sources, including memberships, corporate, foundation and individual gifts. It is also funded in part by the Grants for the Arts program of the San Francisco Hotel Tax Fund, and the National Endowment for the Arts.
