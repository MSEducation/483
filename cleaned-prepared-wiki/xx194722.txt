Clare

=2008: Munster final appearance=

McNamara's first season in charge was a reasonably successful one.  After a relatively lacklustre National Hurling League campaign, Clare were drawn to meet Waterford in the quarter-final of the Munster Championship and were installed as underdogs.  An intriguing game developed, however, at the full-time whistle Clare had won by 2-26 to 0-23.   Thus ended Clare's involvement in the championship.

=Gerry Quinn Saga=

Gerry Quinn had been left out of the Clare Hurling Panel. On 20 March 2009 Gerry Quinn went to visit the Clare Team Doctor Dr Paraic Quinn in Gurteen because he had been laid low with a virus. According to Quinn he rang Mike Mc on the way and informed him about the situation regarding his illness and his desire to meet Paraic Quinn. Quinn then claimed that Mike Mc cut loose at him on the phone. Nevertheless Quinn was hopeful that things could be worked out when he arrived at the session and after asking McNamara whether the doctor was around, Quinn was informed that he was off the panel. On TG4 the day of the match Mike Mc was asked was Gerry Quinn still on the panel, McNamara gave no comment and when he was asked was there a drinking ban he gave no comment.

2009 Player Opposition Crisis

In October 2009, McNamara's tenure as Clare hurling manager looked to be under threat after it emerged the players had sent a letter to the County Board seeking his removal from the post. It appears that the players were disappointed with the county's lack of progress in 2009. The panel requested that the unsigned letter be read out at a County Board meeting on 27 October 2009.
On 1 November 2009, the hurling panel produced a vote of no confidence in McNamara to continue as manager. 
On 6 December, following several postponements,
