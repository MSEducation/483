Stephen Andrew Bustin (born 1954), the goal of which is to create guidelines for how PCR should be performed to ensure that PCR results are being reliably conducted and interpreted, as well as to make replication of experiments easier.

Education

He obtained his PhD from Trinity College, Dublin in molecular genetics in 1983. Following post-doctoral research into foot-and-mouth disease virus at the Animal Virus Research Laboratory in Pirbright and molecular technologies at Corporate Research, Amersham International, he became a Senior Research fellow (1989) and a Senior Lecturer (1995) at the London Hospital Medical College.

Career

Following the merger with St Bartholomew's Medical College and Queen Mary University of London he was promoted to Reader in Molecular Medicine in 2002, followed by the award of a personal chair as Professor of Molecular Science in 2004 at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry.

Research

His research group's general areas of interest are the small and large bowel, as well as colorectal cancer with particular emphasis on investigating the process of invasion and metastasis. An important aim is to translate molecular techniques into clinical practice by including molecular parameters into clinical tumor staging.

Autism omnibus trial

Bustin testified on behalf of the Department of Justice in the autism omnibus trial about what he stated was the unreliability of the O'Leary lab's results with regard to testing for contamination. Bustin describes his conclusions with regard to the lab's alleged detection of measles virus RNA as follows: "My clear conclusion then was that O'Leary's results were caused by defective experimental technique and inappropriate interpretation of results, since he was detecting DNA, and measles virus does not exist as DNA."
