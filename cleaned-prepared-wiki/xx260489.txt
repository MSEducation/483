Work with government

A brief summary of Widjojo's career is as follows:,'Prof. Dr. Widjojo Nitisastro', in Moh. Arsjad Anwar, Aris Ananta, Ari Kuncoro (eds), Tributes for Widjojo Nitisastro by Friends from 27 Foreign Countries, 2007, Penerbit Buku Kompas, Jakarta.
During his career in government, Widjojo was the head of many Indonesian delegations to numerous international meetings such as the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI), the Paris Club, and World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) meetings.  He was also a member of the South Commission (headed by president Julius Nyerere) as well as numerous other international committees).  In 2008, the Faculty of Economics at the University of Indonesia awarded Widjojo its most prestigious award, the Wirakarya Adhitama, for a lifetime of dedication and extraordinary achievements.

After retirement

After retirement, Widjojo lived quietly in Jakarta. He did not publish widely during his period in government preferring to work directly with his colleagues and president Suharto. In 2010 a collection of some of his main reports and speeches during his period as an adviser was published as Pengalaman Pembangunan Indonesia (The Indonesian Development Experience).Aris Ananta, 'Widjojo Nitisastro and changes to development paradigms', The Jakarta Post, 31 January 2010 .   In the collection, he discussed a wide range of issues relating to economic policy in Indonesia during the period 1965-1997 as well as providing details of the way the government responded to several key economic crises in the 1970s. pp. 87-103.  This book was published in an English-language version in 2011 as The Indonesian Development Experience: A Collection of Writings and Speeches.  The English-language version was launched at the Faculty of Economics, University of Indonesia, on 23 September 2011.A book review of the English-language version is at Harry Bhaskara, 'Footprints of a New Order economic czar', The Jakarta Post,, 23 October 2011.
Widjojo died on 9 March 2012 in Jakarta.  His funeral service was held the same day at the Sunda Kelapa Mosque in Menteng, Jakarta.  His role as a major policy-maker in Indonesia was recognised at an official ceremony in the Planning Bureau (Bappenas) following the service. In paying tribute to Widjojo's legacy, president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said that Widjojo had been a leading architect of 'New Order' economic policies and that many of his ideas had formed the cornerstone of economic policy in Indonesia. After lying in state for a few hours in Bappenas to provide an opportunity for mourners, including president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, to pay their respects, Widjojo was buried at Kalibata Heroes Cemetery in South Jakarta at a ceremony led by Vice President Boediono.

Later recognition

In October 2012, Widjojo was recognised as the "father of Indonesian demography" during a seminar at the 62nd anniversary of the Economics Faculty, University of Indonesia.  Professor Subroto, an economics professor and a colleague of Widjojo in government, said that through his work Widjojo had placed the Indonesian people at the heart of development policy in Indonsia. The seminar was organised by the Institute of Demography within the Economics Faculty at the university.
