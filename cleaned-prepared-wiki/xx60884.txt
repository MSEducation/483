Biography and career

Rick Roufus began his lifelong practice of the martial arts at the age of 5. He learned taekwondo from his father. He quickly rose through the national point karate circuit and debuted as a professional kickboxer in his late teens. He had his first professional fight in May 1985 against J.C Owens whom he defeated by decision. On 19 August 1989, in his tenth fight, Roufus sent shockwaves through the kickboxing community by outworking the reigning national PKC Light Middleweight champion in a unanimous decision win. In April 1987, he fought against John Moncayo for the world title of KICK at super middleweight. Roufus knocked out Moncayo in round 7 to win his first world title.

He changed directions on 5 November 1988 when he challenged Changpuek Kiatsongrit in a non title fight in Las Vegas. His kickboxing record stood at a perfect 28 wins, but  the Thai proved to be too wily. Roufus knocked Changpuek down twice with punches in the first round, but lost by knockout in the fourth round due to the culmination of low kicks that he was unprepared for.
On 19 June 1991, Rick Roufus faced another top class fighter in Marek Piotrowski. A rematch as Piotrowski defeated him in their first encounter.
