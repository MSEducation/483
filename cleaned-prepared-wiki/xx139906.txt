Michael M. Merzenich (born in 1942 in Lebanon, Oregon) is a professor emeritus neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco. His contributions to the field are numerous. He took the sensory cortex maps developed by his predecessors like Archie Tunturi, Clinton Woolsey, Vernon Mountcastle, Wade Marshall, and Philip Bard, and refined them using dense micro-electrode mapping techniques. Using this, he definitively showed there to be multiple somatotopic maps of the body in the postcentral sulcus, and multiple tonotopic maps of the acoustic inputs in the superior temporal plane.Brain Research 50:275-96 1973 
He led the cochlear implant team at UCSF,Med. Biol. Eng. Computing 21:241–54 1983 which transferred its technology to Advanced Bionics, and their version is the Clarion cochlear implant. He collaborated with Bill Jenkins and Gregg Recanzone to demonstrate sensory maps are labile into adulthood in animals performing operant sensory tasks.[ref]

Merzenich was director and Chief Scientific Officer between November 1996 and January 2003.  Merzenich took two sabbaticals from UCSF in 1997 and 2004.  In 1997 he led research teams at Scientific Learning Corporation, and in 2004 at Posit Science Corporation. Currently, Merzenich's second company, Posit Science, is working on a broad range of behavioral therapies.  Their lead product is brain-training application called BrainHQ (TM).

Early biography

Born in Lebanon, Oregon in 1942,[ref]

[/ref]A Childhood in the Sticks, author MM Merzenich Merzenich grew up fascinated by science. He attended the University of Portland in Portland, Oregon earning his Bachelor of Science in 1964. Here, he was valedictorian, receiving only one non-A, a C in a philosophy course in which he argued with the instructor. In 1968 he earned his PhD in Physiology at Johns Hopkins Medical School in the lab of Vernon Mountcastle, studying neural coding of stimulus magnitude in the hairy skin. Brain Res. 10:251-64 1970 He left Johns Hopkins to conduct his postdoctoral studies at the University of Wisconsin under Jerzy Rose. There, he did a cross-species analysis of the cochlear nucleus in large game cats and pinnipeds, did the first auditory cortical microelectrode maps in the macaque with John Brugge, and the first somatosensory maps in the macaque with neurosurgeon Ron Paul. He earned his neurophysiology fellowship between 1968 and 1971. He left Wisconsin to join the faculty at UCSF as the only basic scientist in the clinical Otolaryngology department, head and neck surgery.[ref]
 
[/ref]OHNS at UCSF Merzenich started with UCSF in 1971 as faculty member becoming full professor in 1980.  Merzenich is Co-Director at the Coleman Memorial Laboratory where he conducts research on the cerebral cortex.  His research examines neurological illness, learning processes and the neurological processes of the cerebral cortex.  He remains in the same department, now as a professor emeritus, retiring in 2007.

Awards

In May 1999, Merzenich was honored by election into the National Academy of Sciences for his research on brain plasticity. 
He went on to be elected to the National Academy's Institute of Medicine in 2008, making him one of a very select few to have been elected to more than one of the National Academies.bio-medicine.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news-1/Merzenich-Elected-to-Institute-of-Medicine-27287-1/ 
As of 2001, he received the Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions. He has been awarded the International Ipsen Prize, 
Zülch Prize of the Max-Planck Institute, 
Thomas Alva Edison Patent Award, the Purkinje Medal, 
and Karl Spencer Lashley Award. 
Merzenich has published more than 200 articles. 
His work is also often covered in the popular press, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Time and Newsweek. 
He has appeared on Sixty Minutes II, CBS Evening News and Good Morning America. 
He holds over 50 US patents. Sooy Chair of Otolaryngology, in the Keck Center for Integrative Neurosciences at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center.

Federal grants

Patents and inventions

Merzenich along with Peter B. Delahunt, Joseph L. Hardy, Henry W. Mahncke, and Donald Richards hold the patent for visual emphasis for cognitive training exercises.  This patent explores a computer system of visual learning.  The participant observes a scene which shows at least one foreground object against a background.  The background or foreground are modified to enhance the participants response to achieve a correct response in an iterative basis.
