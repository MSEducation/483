Television career

In the story line, Annie, played by Gail Davis, and her younger brother, Tagg Oakley (portrayed by Jimmy Hawkins), live in fictitious Diablo, Arizona. Their uncle, Luke MacTavish, is officially the sheriff, but he is usually away, with Johnson's Lofty Craig, riding his horse Forest, hence minding the office and jail. 47
