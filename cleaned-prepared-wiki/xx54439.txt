Military career

Marlborough was an officer in the Queen's Own Oxfordshire Hussars, and he later served in the Oxfordshire Yeomanry Cavalry. He fought in the Second Boer War from January 1900 as a Staff Captain in the Imperial Yeomanry, with the temporary rank of Captain. He was subsequently appointed Assistant Military Secretary to Lord Roberts, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in South Africa. 
He was mentioned in despatches and promoted to Major on 7 December 1901. Following the war, he retired from the army, but he returned to active service in the First World War, when he served as a Lieutenant-Colonel on the General Staff.

Family

Marlborough was married twice. His first wife was the American railroad heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt, whom he married at Saint Thomas Church in New York City on 6 November 1895. They had two sons, John Spencer-Churchill, Marquess of Blandford, eventually the 10th Duke of Marlborough, and Lord Ivor Spencer-Churchill. Their mother famously referred to them as "the heir and the spare".
The Vanderbilt dowry was used to restore Blenheim Palace and replenish its furnishings and library, as many of the original contents had been sold over the course of the 19th century. Many of the jewels worn by subsequent Duchesses of Marlborough also date from this period. 
The 9th Duke employed the landscape gardener Achille Duchene to create the water garden on the terrace at Blenheim. The couple were divorced in 1921 and the marriage was annulled by the Vatican five years later.
Marlbrough then married another American, Gladys Deacon, on 25 June 1921 in Paris. Later in their unhappy, childless marriage, she kept a revolver in her bedroom to prevent her husband's entry.[ref]

The couple separated but never divorced.
At the time of his death, the 9th Duke reportedly was negotiating to enter a Catholic religious order in Italy, having converted to that religion late in life. Potential entry to a religious order is not.
