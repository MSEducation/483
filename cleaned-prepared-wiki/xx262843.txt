History

The Dreamworld Express opened with Dreamworld on 15 December 1981 as the Cannonball Express. At the time the railway only featured a single stop in Main Street.
After Easter 2013, Dreamworld began operating the train only on weekends and school holidays.

Stations

Four stations are located throughout the park. The first is Central Park Station located at the end of Main Street at the bottom of the hill. The railway cuts across a main pathway through the use of a set of boom gates before navigating between the Tower of Terror II, Rivertown, Wiggles World and Tiger Island before arriving at the second station. The second station is located in a portion of Rivertown near the Billabong Buffet restaurant. Directly after the station the train passes another set of boom gates before passing the Dreamworld Woolshed and part of the Dreamworld Corroboree. A station is located in Dreamworld Corroboree with entry and exit via the Kai-Kai Caf√© and Bunya Trading Gift Shop. The railway then passes the rest of the Dreamworld Corroboree alongside the Murrisipi River before arriving at the fourth and final station at Rocky Hollow. The station is located near the Rocky Hollow Log Ride and its on-ride photo shop. The final section of railway travels around the former location of the Blue Lagoon water park as well as Dreamworld Studios where Big Brother Australia is filmed. It then returns to Central Park Station in Main Street after passing the railway maintenance sheds.
