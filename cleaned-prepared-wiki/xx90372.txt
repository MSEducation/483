Robert D. Boughner (born March 8, 1971), nicknamed The Boogieman, is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey defenceman and the head coach of the OHL Windsor Spitfires. As head coach of the Spitfires, Boughner has won two Memorial Cup championships, in 2009 and 2010 and has won the Brian Kilrea Coach of the Year Award twice, in 2008 and 2010.

Playing career

Boughner grew up in the Windsor area playing minor hockey and played as a 15-year old with the Belle River Canadians Jr. C club.  He moved away at age 16 to play for the St. Marys Lincolns Jr. B team in 1987–88.  One of Boughner's teammates with the Lincolns was current NHL head coach Dan Bylsma.  The following year Boughner was drafted by the OHL's Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds with the 6th overall selection.
Boughner was drafted by the Detroit Red Wings in the 2nd round (32nd overall) of the 1989 NHL Entry Draft, after a successful junior career with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. With the additions of Vladimir Konstantinov and Nicklas Lidström, who were drafted that same year, to the Detroit blueline in the early 1990s, Boughner received little opportunity to move beyond the organization's AHL farm team in Adirondack. Boughner signed as a free agent with the Florida Panthers in 1994 but was relegated to the minors until a trade brought him to the Buffalo Sabres in 1996. With the Sabres, he was given the opportunity to play regularly, and he was a solid physical component on the Buffalo blueline for two and a half years until he was claimed by the expansion Nashville Predators in the 1998 NHL Expansion Draft. He later played for the Pittsburgh Penguins, Calgary Flames, Carolina Hurricanes, and Colorado Avalanche before retiring in 2006. 
He served as co-captain of the Calgary Flames in the latter half of 2001-02, in addition to serving as the Executive Vice-President of the NHLPA from 2003 to 2006. Though somewhat small for an NHL enforcer, Boughner was given the nickname 'The Boogieman' for his fearless style of play, and he became one of the NHL's most respected 'tough guys' of his era, registering 1,449 penalty minutes in 630 career NHL games.

Coaching career

Boughner headed a new ownership group in purchasing the then-struggling Windsor Spitfires in February 2006. He has as head coach of the team, as well as President & C.E.O., except during the 2010-11 season when Boughner served as an assistant coach with the Columbus Blue Jackets.
In 2007–2008, he coached the Spitfires to the second best regular season finish in their history with 94 points, and was honored as OHL and CHL Coach of the Year. On April 15, 2009, Boughner was named the OHL's coach of the year for the second year in a row. 
On May 8, 2009, he coached the Windsor Spitfires to their first OHL championship in 21 years after finishing the regular season with a league best 115 points.  Also, that same year went on to win Windsor's first Memorial Cup, becoming the first team to lose the first two games of the tournament and still win the Cup. Bougher's Spitfires successfully defended their Memorial Cup championship in 2010.
On June 24, 2009, he was selected by Hockey Canada to coach the National Under-18 hockey team at the Memorial of Ivan Hlinka Tournament.  The team went on to dominate by going undefeated and won gold at the tournament.

Personal

Boughner currently resides in Tecumseh, Ontario, with his wife, Jen. They have four children: Brady, Molly, Emma and Lola.
