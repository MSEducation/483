Fosters Freeze (full name Fosters Old Fashion Freeze) is a chain of fast-food restaurants in California. It was founded by George Foster in 1946 on La Brea Avenue in Inglewood, California, a location that still remains.
The Fosters Freeze name comes from the fact that it is best known for its soft-serve ice milk  and milkshakes, which is reflected in the marketing slogan, "California's Original Soft Serve." Its mascot is an ice cream cone wearing a chef's hat. 
At franchise locations, the company also offers a variety of foods, including hamburgers, chicken strips, and fish. It has not followed the trend of other fast food restaurants in offering a healthy diet menu. 
The restaurant's slogan was "Everything at Foster's is wonderful to eat"; and the slogan has taken on a retro appeal in recent years. 

History

George Foster had acquired the Dairy Queen franchise for California, but was unable to use the name in the state because of its strict dairy laws. That didn't stop him from introducing soft serve ice milk products to Californians.  He built over three hundred franchised retail outlets which marketed ice milk soft serve products and other refreshments.  He then sold the Fosters Freeze franchise to Meyenberg Milk Products.  Meyenberg produced large amounts of evaporated and sweetened condensed milk for domestic and foreign Federal relief programs, as well as for industrial food production uses.  The acquisition of the Fosters Freeze product name was a good fit for Meyenberg.  During the summer months when milk production increased,the company processed and sold its excess milk in the form of Fosters Freeze ice milk products to its franchisees.  Roy Beiderwell,Fresno,CA notes to Bill Boudier  
Meyenberg became a very profitable company because of its government contracts.  But,its Fosters Freeze franchised stores were falling behind the new fast food trend of offering hamburgers and other hot foods.  The company helped its franchisees update and remodel their stores so they could include hamburgers,french fries and Mexican food on their menus.  The move made the old stores very profitable. But it didn't provide Meyenberg with any increased franchise royalties for the sale of these hot foods, even though they were  marketed under the Fosters Freeze name.   
In the early 1960s, Meyenberg was acquired by Vornado, an east coast retailer which had operated  under the trade name of "Two Guys".  Vornado was only interested in the milk producer's strong cash flow position.  Several years after the expiration of its government contracts, Meyenberg Milk Products was sold to Bob Sardella of Sacramento in the 1970s in a leveraged buyout.  Sardella liquidated the physical assets of the firm and attempted to rejuvenate the Foster Freeze product name, but encountered franchisee resistance. He ended up selling the franchise rights to Bill Wagner of Santa Barbara, a retired executive of Sambo's, a west coast restaurant chain.  Wagner wasn't able to expand the chain and sold the franchise to Bill Boudier,a Northern California franchisee with stores throughout the Sacramento area, Kerry Mulligan and their silent partners.  
Boudier parted ways with Mulligan in the early 1980s after Mulligan insisted that the company's emphasis should be on franchise expansion in Hawaii,the Middle Eastern countries such as Oman and Qatar,as well as in California. Boudier's success in refurbishing older existing stores and dramatically increasing their profitability led him to conclude that the company should direct its efforts to purchasing and updating the remaining 250 stores in the old franchise system, and then re-franchising them under a modern revenue generating franchise agreement.  business papers and legal documents of Bill Boudier, Roseville, CA, 2013
