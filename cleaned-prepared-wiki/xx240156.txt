[[Christian radicalism]]

CATEGORIES: Christian radicalism, Christian terms

Christian radicalism (radical Christianity or radical discipleship) encompasses a number of different movements and actions in practical theology.

Radical re-orientation and reflection

"Radical" refers to the need for perpetual re-orientation towards the root truths of Christian discipleship. Radical is derived from the Latin word radix meaning "root."

Personal action

Radical discipleship calls Christians to follow the will of God through personal action and example. This may encompass theological ideas and actions that are perceived to be subversive or extreme, and therefore unacceptable to either the Church or State. The methods by which radical Christians attempt to transform the social order can vary widely, from constructive activism to destructive fanaticism, as Christopher Rowland explains:

Examples of nonviolent radicalism include Martin Luther King, Jr., Toyohiko Kagawa, Leo Tolstoy, Gerrard Winstanley, William Blake and Gustavo Gutiérrez, whilst examples of violent radicalism include the Münster Rebellion, Thomas Müntzer and Camilo Torres Restrepo.
