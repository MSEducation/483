CATEGORIES: Year of birth unknown, 17th-century deaths, American colonial women, Virginia colonial people

Cicely Jordan Farrar was an early settler and Ancient Planter of colonial Jamestown.  She came to the colony as a child,Â in 1611., v1 pp926-929  Nothing is known of her origins, or who she traveled with.  She married three times, and died sometime after 1631.

First Marriage

Cicely Jordan Ferrar's first marriage is inferred from circumstantial evidence.  In the census taken in 1623,"The Living and Dead in Virginia,  Feb. 16, 1623"   The 1624 muster provides the additional information that the child was "borne in Virginia" in 1617.  Temperance Baley is mentioned as an adjacent landholder in the 1620 patent of Cicely's husband Samuel Jordan,Nugent, Cavaliers and Pioneers, 226  proving that the child had ownership of her land by the time she was three years old, and therefore must have been the sole heir of her (deceased) father.  Since she lived with Cicely, and no guardian's record has been found, the conclusion is that Temperance was probably Cicely's daughter by a first marriage to the unknown Baley.cit. p120

Second Marriage

By 1620, Cicely was married to Samuel Jordan, as shown by the wording of his patent (dated September 10, 1620):
On the tract of 388 acres mentioned in the patent ("... upon Capt. Woodlief..."), Samuel Jordan established a plantation known as "Jordan's Journey". Hatch Jr, U. of VA Press, 1957, p67  The two censuses show that two children were born from Cicely's marriage to Samuel Jordan: Mary, born around 1621, and Margaret, born in 1623, after her father's death.
Jordan died before April 1623., v1 p928  In November 1623, administration of his estate was granted to fellow-colonist William Farrar, a relative of Nicholas Ferrar, a leading member of the Virginia Company.

Dispute with Rev. Greville Pooley

Immediately following the death of Samuel Jordan, Greville Pooley made a proposal of marriage to the widow.  His advances were apparently not welcomed by Cecily Jordan, who was then pregnant with her deceased husband's younger child.  Pooley claimed however that his offer had been accepted, and complained to  the court, seeking to hold her to what he claimed was her promise.  The ensuing case provides an interesting insight into changing attitudes toward marriage in English law and society in the early modern period." (Quoted in Safley, Thomas Max, untitled book review, The Sixteenth Century Journal, Vol. 27, No. 3 (Autumn, 1996), pp. 895-898)
On 4 June 1633, the Council called Isaac Maddeson, Pooley's reluctant go-between, to testify as to whether Mrs Jordan had contracted herself to Rev Pooley:
The case was referred to London, with the following note:
This note spells out very clearly the confusion as to whether marriage disputes were to be resolved under canon or civil law, and seems to confirm Stone's assertion in The Road to Divorce that "Marriage law as it operated in England from the fourteenth to the nineteenth centuries was a mess."Safley, op., p.895  
Cicely Jordan's was not the only case of its kind in Virginia in this period.  In June 1624 the Council in Virginia ordered that:

Eventually, in January 1625, Pooley withdrew his claim. Cicely Jordan then married William Farrar.  She died after 1631 (when she was mentioned in a deed); her exact year of death is unknown.
It has been suggested that Cicely Farrar might have outlived her third husband and gone on to marry a fourth husband, Isaac Hutchins (whose will of 1658 mentioned his wife Cicely), and a fifth husband, Henry Sherman (who is proved to have married Isaac Hutchins's widow Cicely.)Henrico Co. Minute Book 1710-14, p51  However, evidence appears to make this unlikely.  Sherman and his wife Cicely, who married after 1658, had at least four children; yet by 1658 Cicely Farrar, if still alive, would have been in her late 50s and unlikely to be still bearing children.  
Alternatively, it has been suggested that Cicely Farrar might have married, as her fourth husband and his second wife,A court record of Sep 12 1660 mentions "Cicily Montague, widdow, & Peter Montague, her sonne in law stepson, both Executors of the Last Will & Testamt. of Mr. Peter Montague, dec'd". Lancaster Co., VA Ct. Orders 1656-1666, p. 12. Peter Montague of Lancaster County, VA, whose 1659 will mentioned a wife named Cicely., v.2, p.653  No evidence has emerged to substantiate this theory.  John Frederick Dorman suggests it is "More likely, but unproved, that ... Montague was Cicely, widow of Robert Jadwin, who later married Nicholas Jernew and left will dated 30 Jan. 1667/8 (Westmoreland Co. Deeds, Patents &c 1665-77,pp.32-32a) naming her Jadwin children, including son John married Peter Montague's daughter Anne and grandson Bartholomew Jadwin of John Jadwin and Anne Montague."Dorman, John Frederick, Adventurers of Purse and Person, 4th ed., v.2, p.653, n.15.

Descendants

Cicely Jordan had one child, Temperance Baley, from her first (presumed) marriage; two children, Mary and Margaret Jordan, from her marriage to Samuel Jordan; and three children, Cicely, William and John, from her marriage to William Farrar.  There are many proven descendants from Cicely's presumed daughter Temperance Baley, and from her son William Farrar.  Nothing is known of her daughters Mary and Margaret Jordan after their appearance in the 1624 Muster.
