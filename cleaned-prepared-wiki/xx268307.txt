Intel Many Integrated Core Architecture or Intel MIC (pronounced Mike) is a multiprocessor computer architecture developed by Intel incorporating earlier work on the Larrabee many core architecture, the Teraflops Research Chip multicore chip research project, and the Intel Single-chip Cloud Computer multicore microprocessor.
Prototype products codenamed Knights Ferry were announced and released to developers in 2010. The Knights Corner product was announced in 2011 and uses a 22nm process. A second generation product codenamed Knights Landing using a 14nm process was announced in June 2013.
In September 2011, the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) announced it would use Knights Corner cards in their 10 PetaFLOPS "Stampede" supercomputer, providing 8 PetaFLOPS of computing power.
At the International Supercomputing Conference (2012, Hamburg), Intel announced the branding of the processor product family as Intel Xeon Phi.
In November 2012, Intel formally announced the first products citing claims of CPU-like versatile programmability, high performance and  power efficiency.
In June 2013, the Tianhe-2 supercomputer at the National Supercomputing Center in Guangzhou (NSCC-GZ) was announced

History

Background

The Larrabee microarchitecture (in development since 2006 The project to produce a GPU retail product directly from the Larrabee research project was terminated in May 2010.
Another contemporary Intel research project implementing x86 architecture on a many-multicore processor was the 'Single Chip Cloud Computer', (prototype introduced 2009.
The Teraflops Research Chip (prototype unveiled 2007

Knights Ferry

Intel's MIC prototype board, named Knights Ferry, incorporating a processor codenamed Aubrey Isle was announced 31 May 2010. The product was stated to be a derivative of the Larrabee project and other Intel research including the Single-chip Cloud Computer.
The development product was offered as a PCIe card with 32 in-order cores at up to 1.2 GHz with four threads per core, 2 GB GDDR5 memory,
Initial developers included CERN, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information (KISTI) and Leibniz Supercomputing Centre. Hardware vendors for prototype boards included IBM, SGI, HP, Dell and others.

Knights Corner

The Knights Corner product line is made at a 22 nm process size, using Intel's Tri-gate technology with more than 50 cores per chip, and is Intel's first many-cores commercial product.
In June 2011, SGI announced a partnership with Intel to utilize the MIC architecture in its high performance computing products.
On November 15, 2011, Intel showed an early silicon version of a Knights Corner processor.
On June 5, 2012, Intel released open source software and documentation regarding Knights Corner.
In June 2012, Cray announced it would be offering 22 nm 'Knight's Corner' chips (branded as 'Xeon Phi') as a co-processor in its 'Cascade' systems.
In June 2012, ScaleMP announced it will provide its virtualization software to allows using 'Knight's Corner' chips (branded as 'Xeon Phi') as main processor transparent extension. The virtualization software will allow 'Knight's Corner' to run legacy MMX/SSE code and access unlimited amount of (host) memory without need for code changes.
The Knight's Corner chip was announced as being rebranded as 'Xeon Phi' at the 2012 Hamburg International Supercomputing Conference.
Tianhe-2 the world's fastest supercomputer according to the TOP500 list for June and November 2013 utilizes Xeon Phi accelerators based on Knights Corner.

Knights Landing

Code name for the second generation MIC architecture product from Intel. Intel officially first revealed details of its second generation Intel Xeon Phi products on June 17, 2013. Intel said that the next generation of Intel MIC Architecture-based products will be available in two forms, as a coprocessor or a host processor (CPU), and be manufactured using Intel's 14nm process technology. Knights Landing products will include integrated on-package memory for significantly higher memory bandwidth.
Knights Landing will be built using up to 72 Airmont (Atom) cores with four threads per core,

Xeon Phi

On June 18, 2012, Intel announced that Xeon Phi will be the brand name used for all products based on their Many Integrated Core architecture.
On September 11, 2012, it was announced that a supercomputer called Stampede would be based on the Xeon Phi. Stampede is capable of 10 petaflops.
On November 12, 2012, Intel announced two Xeon Phi coprocessor families which are the Xeon Phi 3100 and the Xeon Phi 5110P. The Xeon Phi 3100 will be capable of more than 1 teraflops of double precision floating point instructions with 240 GB/sec memory bandwidth at 300 W. The Xeon Phi 5110P will be capable of 1.01 teraflops of double precision floating point instructions with 320 GB/sec memory bandwidth at 225 W. The Xeon Phi 7120P will be capable of 1.2 teraflops of double precision floating point instructions with 352 GB/sec memory bandwidth at 300 W.
The Xeon Phi uses the 22 nm process size. The Xeon Phi 3100 will be priced at under US$2,000 while the Xeon Phi 5110P will have a price of US$2,649 and Xeon Phi 7120 at US$4129.00.
On June 17, 2013, the Tianhe-2 supercomputer was announced by TOP500 as the world's fastest.  It uses Intel Ivy Bridge Xeon and Xeon Phi processors to achieve 33.86 PetaFLOPS.
An empirical performance and programmability study has been performed by researchers. The authors claim that to achieve high performance Xeon Phi still needs help from programmers and that merely relying on compilers with traditional programming models is still far from reality.

Design

The cores of Intel MIC are based on a modified version of P54C design, used in the original Pentium.
Design elements inherited from the Larrabee project include x86 ISA, 4-way SMT per core, 512-bit SIMD units, coherent L2 cache (512 KB per coreTesla vs. Xeon Phi vs. Radeon. A Compiler Writer's Perspective // The Portland Group (PGI), CUG 2013 Proceedings), and ultra-wide ring bus connecting processors and memory.
The Knights Corner instruction set documentation is available from Intel.
