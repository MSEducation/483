Teemu Ilmari Selänne () nicknamed "The Finnish Flash" (born July 3, 1970) is a Finnish professional ice hockey winger for the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League (NHL). He formerly played with Jokerit of the SM-liiga and began his NHL career with the Winnipeg Jets who selected him in the first round, 10th overall, at the 1988 NHL Entry Draft. Selänne has also played for the San Jose Sharks and Colorado Avalanche during a professional career that has spanned 25 years.
After leading the SM-liiga in scoring in 1991–92, Selänne broke into the NHL by scoring 76 goals in 1992–93. It remains the league record for most goals by a rookie and earned him the Calder Memorial Trophy as the top first-year player in the NHL. He has scored 50 goals in a season three times and topped 100 points on four occasions. Selänne is one of the highest scoring players in NHL history with nearly 700 goals and over 1,400 points during his career.  He has played in 10 NHL All-Star Games, has been named to four post-season All-Star Teams and won the inaugural Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy in 1998–99 as the league's leading goal scorer.  He won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy in 2005–06 for perseverance and dedication to the game and was a member of the Ducks' 2007 Stanley Cup championship team.
Internationally, Selänne has been a long-time member of the Finnish National Team. He has played in five World Championships, winning a silver and bronze medal, and in three Canada Cup/World Cup of Hockey tournaments. Selänne is a six-time Olympian, and helped Finland win three bronze medals and, in 2006, a silver medal.  He is the all-time leader in scoring at the Olympic ice hockey tournament with 43 points in his career. A national star in his native country, Selänne is the subject of a top grossing biographical documentary in Finland.

Early life

Selänne was born on July 3, 1970, in Helsinki, Finland. He was raised by his mother Liisa Viitanen and step-father Ilmari Selänne until they divorced in the late 1980s; his biological father is unknown. The family lived for a time in Rauma before settling in Espoo around the time Teemu was 10 years old.
He played three sports as a youth: hockey, bandy and association football. Teemu played hockey and football with and against Paavo, though his brother ultimately gave up on both sports in favour of field hockey, where he was a member of numerous Finnish and European championship teams. Teemu was small as a youth, creating in him a competitive spirit and drive to improve his skills.  Focusing on hockey, he eventually joined the junior squad of Jokerit in Helsinki.
As a young adult, Selänne attended business school for two years and served a mandatory one-year stint with the Finnish Defence Forces.

Playing career

Jokerit

Selänne played three years of junior hockey in Jokerit's development program, culminating in 1987–88 with a 43 goal, 66 point season in 33 games and a Finnish Junior A championship.
After graduating from junior hockey, Selänne joined Jokerit's senior team in the 1. Divisioona in 1988–89 and scored 69 points in 35 games. Jokerit moved up to the SM-liiga in 1989–90, and while Selänne missed the majority of the season due to a leg injury, he scored 12 points in 11 games played.

Winnipeg Jets

The Jets' organizational philosophy at the time was to allow their European draft picks to develop in their native countries, but by 1991, the franchise was working to bring him to Winnipeg. The Calgary Flames signed him to an offer sheet on a three-year contract worth $2.7 million – $1.5 million above what the Jets had been offering. Though concerned about paying such a high salary, Winnipeg exercised its right to match the offer. Selänne made his NHL debut on October 6, 1992, and recorded two assists in a 4–1 Jets victory over the Detroit Red Wings.  He scored his first NHL goal two nights later against goaltender Jeff Hackett of the San Jose Sharks.
Selänne scored his first career hat trick in his fifth contest and had 11 goals in his first 12 NHL games. He finished the season with 16 multi-goal games, including four hat tricks and a four-goal game, en route to breaking the NHL record for goals by a rookie. He surpassed Mike Bossy's record of 53 goals on March 2, 1993, against the Quebec Nordiques and on March 23, scored his 110th point, against the Toronto Maple Leafs, to break Peter Stastny's rookie points record. Selänne finished the season tied for fifth in scoring with 132 points, and his 76 goals tied with Alexander Mogilny for the league lead. His offensive exploits helped pull the Jets into the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs, where they lost a first-round matchup to the Vancouver Canucks. In recognition of his season, Selänne was voted the recipient of the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year, was named to the First All-Star Team and played in his first of ten career NHL All-Star Games.
Unable to maintain a similar pace in 1993–94, Selänne's offensive production declined by 30 percent midway through the season. He scored his 100th career goal on January 12, 1994, against the Buffalo Sabres.  He reached the milestone in his 130th game, the second fastest in NHL history and only one game later than Bossy. Selänne finished the season with 54 points in 51 games, but missed the final 33 games of the season after suffering a severed Achilles tendon in a January 26 game against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The 1994–95 NHL lockout resulted in Selänne splitting the season between Jokerit and the Jets. While playing in Finland, Selänne was named to the tournament all-star team as Jokerit won the 1995 European Cup.
Selänne's career in Winnipeg came to an end midway through the 1995–96 season.  He was leading the Jets with 72 points when, on February 6, 1996, he was traded to Anaheim.  The Mighty Ducks sent first-round draft picks Chad Kilger and Oleg Tverdovsky, along with a third round selection at the 1996 NHL Entry Draft, in exchange for Selänne, Marc Chouinard and a fourth round draft pick.

Anaheim, San Jose, and Colorado

Following a period of adjustment, Selänne gained an appreciation for his new team; he quickly came to call the deal the best thing that ever happened to him.
The 1997 All-Star Game was his fifth, and after scoring a hat trick, Selänne became the first European player to be named most valuable player in the game's 46-year history. He finished the 1997–98 season with his third career 50-goal season; his total of 52 tied Peter Bondra for the league lead, and he scored his 500th career point on January 12, 1998, with an assist against the Los Angeles Kings. He was a finalist for both the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player (finishing third) and the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for gentlemanly conduct (as the runner-up), and was named to the Second All-Star Team. The NHL created the Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy in 1998–99 to be presented to the league's leading goal scorer. Selänne became its inaugural winner following a 47-goal season.
An 85-point season followed in 1999–2000, and he was the Mighty Ducks' leading scorer with 59 points through 61 games in 2000–01.  However, Anaheim sat in last place in the Western Conference, and on March 5, 2001, chose to make a trade. Selänne was sent to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for Jeff Friesen, Steve Shields, and a second-round selection in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft.
Selänne then declined an option in his contract that would have paid $6.5 million in 2003–04 and instead opted to sign a one-year, $5.8 million contract with the Colorado Avalanche, where he was joined by former Anaheim teammate Paul Kariya.  The pair chose to sign with the Avalanche together in the belief it was their best chance at winning the Stanley Cup.

Return to Anaheim

A free agent when the NHL resumed play in 2005–06, Selänne returned to Anaheim by signing a one-year, $1 million contract with the Mighty Ducks. During a resurgent season, he scored his 1,000th career point on January 30, 2006, with a goal in a 4–3 victory over the Los Angeles Kings. Selänne completed the season with 40 goals and 90 points, both of which led the Mighty Ducks, and he was named the recipient of the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for dedication and perseverance.
After reaching the Western Conference final in the 2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the newly renamed Anaheim Ducks entered the 2006–07 season with high expectations; the team brought Selänne back with a one-year, $3.75 million contract. Finally, he scored his 301st goal as a Duck on February 18, 2007, to break Paul Kariya's franchise record.
Early in the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Selänne became Anaheim's all-time leading playoff scorer when he recorded his 30th point as a Duck with an assist on April 13 against the Minnesota Wild. The Ducks defeated the Wild, Vancouver Canucks and Detroit Red Wings to reach the 2007 Stanley Cup Final; it was the first time in Selänne's career that he played in the NHL's championship series. As the sentimental favourite to win the Stanley Cup, his teammates motivated themselves to win the title for his benefit: Teammate and goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère noted: "we don't have any better teammate. He's a guy who always has fun. He deserves this and if we can help him along the way, that would be great. I'd just love to see Teemu win this thing."
Following the cup win, Selänne contemplated retirement.
Selänne returned to the Ducks in 2008–09 and signed a two-year contract.
Selänne finished eighth in league scoring in 2010–11 with 31 goals and 49 assists in 73 games.  His 80 points was the third highest in NHL history by a player over the age of 40 (Gordie Howe, 103 and Johnny Bucyk, 83).  He also scored his 1,300th point, achieving the mark with a two-goal performance on January 16, 2011, against the Edmonton Oilers.
Following a 24-point effort in the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, Selänne announced that 2013–14 would be the 21st and final season of his NHL career.
On April 13, 2014, Teemu Selanne played his final regular season game, against the Colorado Avalanche. The game was recognized as a special "thank You Teemu" event by the team, with in-game video tributes. After the Game (A 3-2 Ducks Overtime Win) Teemu was named the Game's 1st, 2nd and 3rd star. While skating a lap to the applause of fans, Teemu went to the Colorado bench and grabbed one-time Duck, Jean Sebastien Giguere, who had been the Avalanche goalie for the game. The two skated to center ice to salute the fans together.

International


Selänne's international debut came with the Finnish national junior team. He recorded 16 points in six games at the 1988 European Junior Championship and was named to the tournament all-star team. After participating in the 1989 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships for the sixth place Finns, Selänne made his debut with the senior team at the 1991 World Championship where he finished third in tournament scoring with 11 points for the fifth place finishers. After playing in the 1991 Canada Cup, he made his Olympic debut at the 1992 Albertville Games.

At the 1998 Winter Olympics, Selänne finished with 10 points in five games. He was the tournament's leading scorer on a Finnish team that he described in 2003 as the best he ever played on and the best in the tournament, but lost the semifinal, 7–4 to Russia.
The Finns finished one position higher at the 1999 World Championship; The tournament's medal round was conducted in a two-game series format followed by a ten-minute sudden victory overtime if the each team wins one game.

Selänne served as the Finnish captain at the 2002 Winter Olympics and led his nation to an important preliminary round victory over Russia,
The 2004 World Cup of Hockey was played after Selänne's difficult NHL season with Colorado. For Selänne, the tournament was about recovering his joy at playing hockey. The Finns outscored their opposition 19–2 in the group stage, then defeated the United States and shut out Russia in the semi-final.  The Finns were overcome in the final by Sweden, 3–2, and were relegated to the silver medal. Selänne scored six goals and 11 points in the tournament, was named to the all-star team and received the Directorate Award as top forward.
Selänne stated he would retire from international competition after a bronze medal-winning performance followed at the 2008 IIHF World Championship.
Selänne was named to the Finnish team for the 2014 Sochi Olympics which marked his sixth appearance at the tournament.  Selänne was named the Olympic tournament MVP as selected by the media.

Playing style

Selänne's primary attribute is his skating speed.  According to defenceman Nicklas Lidström: "He's one of those snipers that can put the puck on net because he finds openings and he knows where to be on the ice. Former teammate Jean-Sébastien Giguère added: "He's just a very elegant player. He's got a very nice stride to his skating, he plays with a lot of energy, a lot of enthusiasm ... with the skill he has, it just makes for a heck of a great player."
An elite offensive player, Selänne is the highest scoring Finnish-born player in NHL history. He ended the 2012–13 season 11th on the all-time list with 675 goals and 15th with 1,430 points. Selänne is one of eight players to score 70 or more goals in one season. He holds numerous records, including most goals, 76, and points, 132, by a rookie. Both totals are also single-season records for the original Jets/Phoenix Coyotes franchise.  The holder of most major franchise records for the Ducks, Selänne leads the team at 448 goals, 513 assists, 961 points and 902 games played as of the 2012–13 season. He also holds single season records with 52 goals and 109 points.  The Ducks have already announced that Selänne's number 8 will be the first number retired by the franchise at the conclusion of his career.
