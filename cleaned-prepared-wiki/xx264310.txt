Lorenzo Ebecilio (born 24 September 1991 in Hoorn, North Holland) is a Dutch professional football player, currently playing as a left winger for Azerbaijani side Gabala and Netherlands U-21.

Club career

Lorenzo Ebecilio started his career with VV de Blokkers, an amateur club from Hoorn. He would later play in the youth teams of HVV Hollandia and AZ.
On 27 October 2005, several months following the death of his father, the fourteen-year-old Ebecilio had a heart attack and had to have a defibrillator surgically implanted. He was forced to leave AZ due to these healh concerns, and the player returned to HVV Hollandia. He no longer has any problems related to his heart following the surgery. Ajax subsequently offered him a place in their youth academy.

AFC Ajax

At Ajax, Ebecilio played for Jong Ajax under manager Frank de Boer. On 12 December 2010, six days after the departure of Martin Jol and the installation of De Boer as caretaker manager, Ebecilio made his debut in the first team of Ajax, being in the starting line-up in an away victory over Vitesse. He was named man-of-the-match in the game against his former club.
2011 began much like 2010 had ended, with the player being in the starting line-up for the league matches against Feyenoord, FC Utrecht, NAC Breda, and De Graafschap. Ebecilio participated in most of Ajax matches during the second half of the season, ultimately leading to the Dutch league championship. Ebecilio also appeared in the KNVB Cup final against FC Twente. Ajax lost the final with 3–2, despite one goal of Ebecilio.
On 4 March 2012, Ebecilio scored his first hat-trick for Ajax in an easy 4–1 win over Roda JC.espn.go.com/report?id=321712&cc=5901

Metalurh Donetsk

On 2 January 2013, Marc Overmars announced the direct transfer of Lorenzo Ebecilio to the Ukrainian club for a sum of €500.000. The winger had played a significant role in the Ajax title win during the 2010–11 season, in which he had started all 16 matches after Frank de Boer's takeover following Martin Jol's resignation. However the next season saw Lorenzo receiving much less playing time, which led to his subsequent transfer during the 2012–13 winter transfer window. His contract with Ajax ran until the summer of 2014, taking a three-year contract with the Ukrainian club from Donetsk.

Gabala FK

On 5 June 2013, it was announced that Ebecilio had signed a one year contract with Azerbaijan Premier League team Gabala.
His first goal for Gabala came in his fifth game, a 3–2 home victory over Inter Baku on 31 August 2013.

International career

Ebecilio has represented Netherlands U-17 and Netherlands U-19. He represented the Netherlands in the 2008 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship and the 2010 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship. On 9 February 2011, Ebecilio made his debut for Netherlands U-21 in a match against the Czech Republic.
