Harold Rudolf Foster (August 16, 1892 – July 25, 1982), better known as Hal Foster, was a Canadian-American illustrator and writer best known as the creator of the comic strip Prince Valiant. His drawing style is noted for a high level of draftsmanship and attention to detail.
Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, Foster rode his bike to the United States in 1919. In 1928, he began one of the earliest adventure comic strips, an adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs's Tarzan. In 1937, he created his signature strip, the weekly Prince Valiant, a fantasy adventure set in medieval times. The strip featured Foster's dextrous, detailed artwork; Foster eschewed word balloons, preferring to have narration and dialogue in captions.

Early life

Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Foster was a staff artist for the Hudson's Bay Company in Winnipeg and rode his bike to Chicago in 1919 where he studied at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts and soon found illustration assignments. The illustrator J. C. Leyendecker was an early influence on Foster..
Foster's Tarzan comic strip, adapted from Edgar Rice Burroughs's novels, began October 20, 1928. Foster returned to do the Tarzan Sunday strip beginning September 27, 1931, continuing until Burne Hogarth took over the Sunday Tarzan on May 9, 1937.. He soon grew tired of working on an adaptation and began planning his own creation.

Prince Valiant

William Randolph Hearst, who had long wanted Foster to do a comic strip for his newspapers, was so impressed with Foster's pitch for Prince Valiant that he promised Foster a 50-50 split of the gross income on the strip, a very rare offer in those days. Prince Valiant premiered on February 13, 1937, continuing for decades. In 1944, Foster and his wife Helen moved from Topeka to Redding Ridge, Connecticut. In 1954, the couple was seen on television's This Is Your Life. In 1971, the Fosters retired to Spring Hill, Florida. In 1967, Woody Gelman revived some of Foster's earlier work for his Nostalgia Press. Mint Condition: How Baseball Cards Became an American Obsession, pp. 125–26. New York: Atlantic Monthly Press (imprint of Grove/Atlantic), 2010. ISBN 978-0-8021-1939-1

Retirement

In 1970, Foster was suffering from arthritis and began planning his retirement. He had several artists draw Sunday pages before choosing John Cullen Murphy as his collaborator and permanent replacement in 1971. Murphy drew the strip from Foster scripts and pencil sketches. Foster stopped illustrating (and signing) the Prince Valiant pages in 1975. For several years, he continued writing the strip and doing fairly detailed layouts for Murphy, eventually doing less and less of both the writing and art until prolonged anesthesia during an operation took his memory and he no longer remembered ever doing Prince Valiant.
Foster attended the Comic Art Convention in 1969, and the OrlandoCon in 1974 and 1975.Jim Ivey's Photo Album, Part One San Diego Comic Con 1974
Foster was 73 when he was elected to membership in Great Britain's Royal Society of Arts, an honor given to very few Americans.
Foster died in Spring Hill in 1982.

Influence and Legacy

Foster is a seminal figure in the history of comics, especially action-adventure strips. R.C. Harvey argues that Foster and Flash Gordon artist Alex Raymond "created the visual standard by which all such comic strips would henceforth be measured."Harvey, R.C. (Jan 2009). "Alex Raymond at Last". The Comics Journal (295): 161–173. ISSN 0194-7869.
Foster's clear yet detailed panels, uncluttered by word balloons, were appreciated by contemporaries of his generation such as Lynd Ward,Spiegelman, Art (Oct 13, 2010)."The Woodcuts of Lynd Ward". The Paris Review but perhaps his greatest impact was on the young artists who drove the Golden Age of Comics. Foster was a major influence on this generation, many of whom went on to become iconic and influential artists themselves. Joe Kubert called Foster, Raymond and Milton Caniff the "three saints" of comic art in the 1930s and 40s. "Will Eisner: Portrait of a Sequential Artist". Shofar 29 (2): 193. doi:10.1353/sho.2011.0069. Several sources have identified early work by Joe Simon, Jack Kirby and Bob Kane as swipes from Foster,Cronin, Brian (Jan 8, 2009) "Comic Book Legends Revealed #189". Comic Book ResourcesCronin, Brian (Sep 18, 2008) "Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #173". Comic Book ResourcesMendryk, Harry (Aug 28, 2009) "Jack Kirby, Fanboy". The Jack Kirby Museum and Kirby claimed that he "cannibalized" Foster's style, among others.Cronin, Brian (Jan 8, 2009) "Comic Book Legends Revealed #189". Comic Book Resources Wally Wood was "obsessed" with Foster's work, and began copying his newspaper strips at the age of two. The Hero Initiative Frank Frazetta called Foster's work on Tarzan "perfection, a landmark in American twentieth-century art that will never be surpassed."Winiewicz, Dave (Sep 21, 2011) "Frazetta and Hal Foster". Frazetta Among the many other artists who have cited Foster as an important influence are Steve Ditko,Goode, Gregory (Nov 2, 2009)"Steve Ditko, co-creator of Spider-Man, is 82 today". examiner. A Prince Named Valiant William Stout,Seneca, Matt (Oct 18, 2011) "Prince Valiant, Volume 4: 1943-1944". The Comics Journal Bill Ward,Ward, Bill. "Autobiography". Bill Ward Archive and Al Williamson. The Comics Journal Williamson, who met Foster on a few occasions, described him as "a very stern gentleman, very stern, no nonsense. You could never call him Hal or Harold, it's Mr. Foster. ... you don't see that kind of people anymore, the ones that really command your respect."
In his review of Prince Valiant for The Comics Journal, Matt Seneca wrote "as far as long-form serialized action comics go, the only equal to Foster American comics have produced is Kirby, and Kirby was never shy about proclaiming his debts to the master."Seneca, Matt (Oct 18, 2011) "Prince Valiant, Volume 4: 1943-1944".
