History

Established on March 13, 1897, San Diego State University first began as the San Diego Normal School, meant to educate local women as elementary school teachers. It was located on a  In 1923, the San Diego Normal School became San Diego State Teachers College, "a four-year public institution controlled by the state Board of Education."  
By the 1930s the school had outgrown its original campus. In 1931 it moved to its current location on a mesa at what was then the eastern edge of San Diego. In 1935, the school expanded its offerings beyond teacher education and became San Diego State College. In 1960, San Diego State College became a part of the California College System, now known as the California State University system. Finally in 1970 San Diego State College became San Diego State University (SDSU).
John F. Kennedy, then the President of the United States of America, gave the graduation commencement address at San Diego State University on June 6, 1963. Geraghty, SDSUniverse (May 12, 2003)  Kennedy was given an honorary doctorate degree in law at the ceremony, making SDSU the first California State College to award an honorary doctorate degree. In 1964, this event was registered as California Historical Landmark #798.
Since 1968, SDSU's Astronomy Department has owned the Mount Laguna Observatory located in the Cleveland National Forest. It operates the observatory concurrently with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.Mount Laguna Observatory
For the beginning of the 2006–2007 academic year, SDSU expanded its classrooms and support space by more than  with the opening of three new buildings, the College of Arts and Letters, the Calpulli Center and Donald P. Shiley BioScience Center. The buildings, respectively, feature high-technology classrooms, upgraded health and wellness facilities, and scientific research laboratories.
In April 2012, his Holiness the XIV Dalai Lama spoke at SDSU's Viejas Arena as part of his "Compassion Without Borders" tour.

University Presidents

SDSU has had a total of ten presidents, eight of which were elected to the post, while the other two were in acting position (resulting in a less than a one year term). Several structures on the campus are named in past presidents' honor such as Hardy Tower, Hepner Hall (integrated in the university's logo), and the Malcolm A. Love Library.

Campus

Several buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places:
Other buildings on campus include:

Residence halls

In 1937, Quetzal Hall, the first dormitory, opened for 40 women students and was located off campus. 96 In 1952, 50 college youth conducted a panty raid at Quetzal Hall, causing $1,000 in damages. Police arrested 13 of the students and the dorm girls later retaliated by attacking the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house. 143 In 1968, the coed dorm Zura Hall was built, and more rooms were added later. 168 Chapultepec Hall held 580 students when first built. 220
Today, the university owns and operates housing for a total of 4,107 students between the dorms, towers, and student apartments, fraternity row, language, and honors housing. Approximately 63% of first-time freshman live in on campus housing, while about 14% of the overall student body resides in on campus housing.sdsu.pdf SDSU offers unique themed-living communities in the freshman and upperclassman housing, such as "pathways for transfers," "gender-neutral housing," and "explore San Diego."

Branch campuses

Currently SDSU operates an outlet campus, or the Imperial Valley Campus, located in Calexico, California with additional campus in Brawley, California. IVC includes a research park and related facilities. The campus originally served upper division, teacher certification, and graduate students only, but now serves a selective cohort of freshmen and sophomores pursuing degrees in criminal justice, liberal studies, or psychology.ivcampus.edu/About_SDSU_IVC/ SDSU formerly operated a campus in North County,  which was later converted into the larger California State University, San Marcos. In the South Bay, SDSU operated a campus on the first floor of the parking structure across from the Holiday Inn in National City, California. This campus shared facilities with Southwestern College. The South Bay campus is now closed indefinitely.

Enrollment

The university reached its peak enrollment in 1987 with a student body of 35,945, resulting in SDSU being the largest university in California and the 10th largest university in the United States.

For the 2004–2005 academic year, SDSU received over $157 million USD in external funding from grants and contracts, as well as an additional $57 million USD in donations and charitable giving.
An auxiliary to The Campanile Foundation is the Aztec Athletic Association, which primarily raises funds for the student athletes in the San Diego State University athletics programs (see discussion of Athletics below and at SDSU Aztecs).
In addition to its permanent endowment, San Diego State University raises over $55 million U.S. dollars per year (approximately) in philanthropic gifts to support its research and academic affairs."San Diego State University Reports $55.2 Million in Philanthropic Gifts for 2004–05" Official SDSU Press Release, Oct. 7, 2005"

Media, newspapers, and magazines

Students began publishing The White and Gold in 1902, which was a literary magazine and newspaper. 27 In 1913, a new newspaper was established entitled Normal News Weekly. 39 The school newspaper Paper Lantern (Normal News Weekly was renamed after the addition of the junior college) became The Aztec in September 1925. It was later expanded to its current name, The Daily Aztec. The school's annual yearbook was named Del Sudoeste (Spanish for "of the southwest") in the early 1920s.
The Koala, a comedy newspaper that is widely known around the San Diego State area, is also distributed monthly on campus but is not directly connected to the school at the moment.

Student body and Greek life

The university currently recognizes 19 social fraternities, 17 social sororities, and 16 business/professional/service fraternities for a total of 52 greek organizations on campus.sdsu.edu/RSO/Search/List?Keywords=&OrgTypeCode=AMR&faction=Search
On April 27, 1974, The Phi Beta Kappa Society established an SDSU chapter. It was the first in the CSU system as well as the San Diego area. 193 Other multidisciplinary national honor societies include Phi Kappa Phi, Mortar Board, Golden Key, and Phi Eta Sigma.
The first fraternity on campus was the Delta chapter of Epsilon Eta, which formed on October 25, 1921. By the end of the decade there were six other fraternities and eight sororities. The fraternities and sororities were all local, and did not attain national status until after World War II. 59 In 1925, in order to encourage higher grades, the Inter-Fraternity Council and Inter-Sorority Council published the average grades of the fraternity and sorority members. On a 3.0 scale, the average GPA (grade point average) for all students was 1.49, for fraternities was 1.35, and sororities was 1.47.  By the mid-1930s there were eight fraternities and eleven sororities, and later expanded to fifteen fraternities and twelve sororities in the 1940s. 127 The first fraternity to go national was Theta Chi and the first sorority was Alpha Xi Delta.
During the 1960s and early 1970s, the Greek population had dwindled to 699, but gradually began to increase in the 1980s, reaching 2,900 in 1988. There were 20 fraternities and 13 sororities officially affiliated with the Inter Fraternity Council and Panhellenic Council as well as six independent fraternities/sororities. This made it one of the largest fraternity and sorority systems in the western U.S. 214 On April 6, 1978, Gamma Phi Beta sorority hired a plane to drop marshmallows on fraternity houses during Derby Week, but the plane crashed near Peterson Gym, injuring four students aboard. 215 In 1983 a USA Today article reported that SDSU Greeks GPAs were below the campus average, so SDSU tightened restrictions and supervision and by 1989 their grades had increased to slightly above University average. 215 Between 1989–91, several riots among the fraternities occurred, including one numbering 3,500 people, and another requiring 34 police officers to end it. 216 The 2008 drug bust resulted in the suspension of several fraternities as well as the arrests of multiple fraternity members. Currently there are over 50 social fraternities and sororities, including general, professional and culturally based organizations, represented by five governing councils.
The Panhellenic council sororities on campus include Alpha Chi Omega, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Alpha Phi, Alpha Gamma Delta, Delta Gamma, Delta Zeta, Gamma Phi Beta, Kappa Delta, and Pi Beta Phi.

The university is one of the few campuses in California that is home to the gay social fraternity, Delta Lambda Phi. Additionally, SDSU is one of only two universities in all of the U.S. to offer a major in LGBT studies, while also offering a minor in the discipline.sdsu.aspx?s=73702

Extracurriculars

Athletics

The first major sport on campus was rowing, but it initially had no coaches or tournaments. 28 Other sports that developed early in the campus's history were tennis, basketball, golf, croquet, and baseball. The school's football program had such a limited selection of players that faculty had to be used to fill the roster. When the college merged with the junior college in 1921, SDSU became a member of the Junior College Conference. After the school won the majority of the conference titles in a variety of sports, the league requested that SDSU leave out of fairness to the smaller schools. For its football program, the team outscored its opponents 249 to 52 in ten games, resulting in the first sales of season tickets in 1923. 60 From 1925–26, SDSU played as an independent. It then joined the Southern California Conference in 1926, where it did not win a football conference championship until 1936. However, in other sports including tennis and basketball, it excelled. SDSU remained with the conference until 1939, when it joined the California Collegiate Athletic Association. 102 & 105
The basketball team reached and won multiple championships games during the 1930-1940s, including a conference title in 1931, 1934, 1937, and 1939. It reached the national championship in 1939 and 1940, losing in the final rounds. However, in 1941 SDSU returned and won the college's first national title. In track, the team won conference titles in 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, and 1939. The football team won conference titles in 1936 and 1937, and the baseball team won three conference titles and placed second three times between 1935–1941.
In 1955, the Aztec Club was established and raised $20,000 a year by 1957. The club worked in increasing athletic scholarships, hiring better coaches, and developing the college's intercollegiate athletic programs. In 1956, students approved through a vote of allowing a mandatory student activity fee, with a portion going to athletics. By the end of the decade the budget had doubled to $40,000. The campus's most successful sports program during the 1950s was cross-country as the team won eight straight conference titles, AAU regional titles, and placed high in national competitions. Basketball ranged from last in the conference to multiple conference, regional, and national appearances. The football program had its first undefeated team in 1951, but in the last part of the decade earned the worst records in the school's football program under the direction of head coach Paul Governali. 144-45
Under Governali, the campus's football program suffered, due to Governali's policy of not recruiting new players. To improve the program, Love hired Don Coryell in 1961, which helped the program to win three consecutive championships (1966–68), and end with a record of 104 wins, 19 losses, and 2 ties by the time he left SDSU. Coryell was assisted by John Madden, Joe Gibbs, and Rod Dowhower, among others. In Coryell's first year, attendance at home games averaged 8,000 people, but by 1966 it had doubled to 16,000. This later jumped to 26,000–41,000 per game with the addition of the new San Diego stadium. At some games, attendance was larger than at San Diego Chargers games. There were several undefeated seasons and multiple players broke records for most catches, touchdowns, and passing yards, among others. In 1969, SDSU moved into NCAA Division I, leaving the California Collegiate Athletic Association. In 1972, Coyrell left to pursue coaching in the NFL. 159-62
Basketball also did well, with the 1967–68 team being ranked the number one college-level team in the nation, although it did not win a national title. The Aztecs also won the 1960 CCAA baseball title, and won multiple national championships throughout the 1960s in track, cross country, and swimming.
By 1970–71, the campus had 14 NCAA sports. The 1973 men's volleyball team won the NCAA national championship which was the first NCAA national title since moving to Division I status. 221
SDSU competes in NCAA Division I FBS. Its primary conference is the Mountain West Conference; its women's water polo team participates in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation and its men's soccer team participates as an Associate Member of the Pacific-12 Conference (the "Pac-12" Conference). The ice hockey team competes in the ACHA with other western region club teams (www.com). The crew team's championship regatta is in the WIRA (Western International Rowing Association). The university colors are scarlet (red) and black, SDSU's athletic teams are nicknamed "Aztecs", and its current mascot is the Aztec Warrior, historically referred to as "Monty – Montezuma". Athletics revenues have been down recently.

Traditions

S mountain

"S" mountain was created by the Council of Twelve and initially supported by President Hardy. "S" on Cowles Mountain. The giant S was lit at night for the opening football game of a season (performed by the freshman to build school spirit) along with pep rallies, and was repainted throughout its history. 78Starr, p. 126 At the time, it was the largest collegiate symbol in the world. 79 During World War II, the S was camouflaged to prevent it becoming a reference point for enemy bombing aircraft. 112 It was returned to its normal state in April 1944. 121 In the 1970s students stopped painting it and brush obstructed the symbol. After a 1988 brush fire it was exposed, and students repainted it. In fall, 1997, a group of 100 volunteers climbed Cowles Mountain after dusk to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the school by using flashlights to once again outline the "S" on the side of the mountain. In 1990, a high school prank defaced the S to read as "91" in honor of their graduating class. 213

School colors and mascot

The initial colors of the school were white and gold. When the junior college was added to the campus in 1921, its colors of blue and gold were merged, resulting in a blue, gold, and white color scheme. New colors were later chosen as gold and purple, until being replaced by crimson and black on January 28, 1928. 50
The school's prior nicknames for its mascot included "Normalites", "Professors", and "Wampus Cats". However, after a 1924 committee met to address the issue, the name "Aztecs" was decided on. 53 In 2003, the Aztec Warrior was approved by a student and alumni vote to become the official university mascot after the school's prior mascot, Monty Montezuma, was discontinued.
