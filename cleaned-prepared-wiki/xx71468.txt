[[Dhaulagiri]]

CATEGORIES: Eight-thousanders, Mountains of Nepal, Mountain ranges of Nepal

The Dhaulagiri massif in Nepal extends  ranks seventh among Earth's fourteen peaks over eight thousand metres. It was first climbed on May 13, 1960 by a Swiss/Austrian/Nepali expedition.
The mountain's name is धौलागिरी (dhaulāgirī) in Nepali.  This comes from Sanskrit where धवल (dhawala) means dazzling, white, beautifulMonier-Williams, op. cit. p. 513 and गिरि (giri) means mountain. cit. p. 355  Dhaulagiri I is also the highest point of the Gandaki river basin.
Annapurna I (8,091m/26,545 ft) is only 34 km. east of Dhaulagiri I.  The Kali Gandaki River flows between through its notable gorge, said to be the world's deepest.  The town of Pokhara is south of the Annapurnas, an important regional center and the gateway for climbers and trekkers visiting both ranges as well as a tourist destination in its own right.

Geography

Looking north from the plains of India, most 8,000-metre peaks are obscured by nearer mountains, but in clear weather Dhaulagiri I is conspicuous from northern Bihar and as far south as Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh. In 1808 A.D. survey computations showed it to be the highest mountain yet surveyed.
Dhaulagiri I's sudden rise from lower terrain is almost unequaled. It rises .  The south face of Gurja Himal in the same massif is also notably immense.

Dhaulagiri I climbing history

Most ascents have followed the northeast ridge route of the first ascent, but climbs have been made from most directions. As of 2007 there had been 358 successful ascents and 58 fatalities.
Between 1950 and 2006, 2.88% of 2,016 expedition members and staff going above base camp on Dhaulagiri I died.  On all 8,000 metre peaks in Nepal the death rate was 1.63%, ranging from 0.65% on Cho Oyu to 4.04% on Annapurna I and 3.05% on Manaslu.

Partial timeline

Other peaks in the Dhaulagiri Himalaya

† Only peaks above 7,200 m with more than  of topographic prominence are ranked. 
‡ The status of Churen Himal's three peaks is unclear and sources differ on their heights.Neate "High Asia"Finnmap (topographic map) of Dhaulagiri Himal
The coordinates, heights and prominence values above are derived from the Finnmap. The first ascent data is from Neate, but it is unclear if the first ascent of Churen Himal East was actually an ascent of the highest of the three peaks, as Neate lists Churen Himal Central as a 7,320 m subpeak of Churen Himal East.
Most of the named 7,000 metre peaks are on a ridge extending WNW, separated from Dhaulagiri I by 5,355m French Pass at 28°46'55"N, 83°31'54"E. In order they are Dhaulagiri II, III, V, IV, Junction Peak, Churens East, Central and West, Putha Hiunchuli and Hiunchuli Patan.  False Junction Peak, Dhaulagiri VI and Gurja are on a ridge extending south from Junction Peak.
The British Alpine Club's Himalayan Index lists 37 more peaks over 6,000 m.[ref]

6,182m Pota Himal (FinnMap sheet 2883-01 "Chhedhul Gumba") stands north of the main ridge between Churen and Putha Hiunchuli.  Pota has been informally renamed Peak Hawley after Elizabeth Hawley, a notable expedition chronicler and Kathmandu-based reporter.
Hiunchuli Patan at the western end nearest the Bheri River is locally called Sisne or Murkatta Himal.  It was an iconic landmark to insurgents based in Rukum and Rolpa districts during the 1996-2006 Nepal Civil War.
