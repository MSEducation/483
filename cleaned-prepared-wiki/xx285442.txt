History

Formation and The Space Between EP (2011–2012)

Intervals was formed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 2011, as a creative outlet for guitarist Aaron Marshall. He recorded and programmed all the parts for The Space Between himself in his home studio; it was mixed and mastered by Adam "Nolly" Getgood of Periphery and released independently, on December 20th 2011. As well as this, Aaron made an attempt to form a full band (including a vocalist), with the intention of turning Intervals into a touring act; the band however did not find a suitable vocalist and so decided to remain as an instrumental band for the foreseeable future.

In Time EP (2012–2013)

Fall 2012 saw the release of their 2nd EP In Time on October 30, 2012. The EP featured guest solos from Olly Steele (Monuments) and David Maxim Micic (Destiny Potato). This EP received a 4.0/Excellent rating via Sputnik Music and stated that the band were "a very talented instrumental progressive metal band."

A Voice Within (2013–Current)

On September 14, 2013, Intervals announced they would be entering the studio with Jordan Valeriote (Silverstein, Structures, Counterparts) on November 4, 2013 to begin tracking their upcoming release.
The band released a second song from the album, "The Escape", on January 23, 2014. They also announced that the album would be released on March 4, 2014.
On 26 February, the band announced that they would be releasing one new song from the album per day until the day of the album's release; the first of these songs was "The Self Surrendered".
