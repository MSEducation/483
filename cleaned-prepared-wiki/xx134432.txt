In the 19th century, France began expanding its colonial empire into Asia and the Pacific Islands, declaring the Kingdom of Tahiti a protectorate in 1842.

Architecture

Exterior

The entrance of the cathedral features a red steeple

Interior

The interior of the church is noted for its mixture of European and local Polynesian features in its design.  This is demonstrated in a full-size woodcarving of the Madonna and Child, the latter of whom is clutching a breadfruit.  This work of art originated from the Marquesas Islands.
The cathedral is also known for its artistic representations of the Stations of the Cross.  Created by Yuel Durnad and St. Fond, the stations incorporate both Tahitian and Roman cultures in the style of dress, but solely depict Polynesian people in the scenes of The Passion.  The artistic style of the paintings was influenced by Paul Gauguin.
