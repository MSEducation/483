Jonathan Goulet (born July 13, 1979) is a retired French Canadian mixed martial artist. He has most recently fought as a Welterweight for the UFC, where he made his successful debut at Ultimate Fight Night 2, defeating Jay Hieron by technical knockout. He is known for his "knock out or be knocked out" attitude and for getting knocked out by Duane Ludwig in 6 seconds, the official fastest knockout in UFC history. Goulet is specifically known for his knee strikes, and attributes this to training with Muay Thai specialist Mark Dellagrotte at Team Sityodtong in Boston.  

Background

Goulet is from Quebec, Canada and began training in Kenpo Karate when he was 14 years old but does not hold a high rank in the martial art. Goulet also began Brazilian jiu-jitsu when he was 20. Before becoming a professional fighter, Goulet worked in construction and also as a bouncer. It was during his time working as a bouncer at 20 years of age, when he began to pursue MMA fighting. Goulet had removed one man from the bar he was working at, but afterwards was "jumped" by three of the man's friends, who badly beat the young Goulet. After this incident, Goulet decided to make sure that nothing like that would ever happen again, and began training more in the martial arts. 

Mixed martial arts career

Goulet is undefeated in the Quebec-based organization TKO, holding an unblemished record of 9 wins, 0 losses within the company but with 2 straight TKO losses in the UFC.sherdog.asp?fighterid=4120
Taking a 13-5 MMA record to the UFC, Goulet was successful in his debut, earning a TKO victory over Jay Hieron. His second UFC fight, however, did not go his way. He was knocked out in 6.06 seconds by Duane Ludwig which is currently the quickest knockout in the history of the organization. Goulet rebounded and came back to win a majority decision over The Ultimate Fighter 2 fan favourite, Luke Cummo, at ''Ultimate Fight Night 5.
Goulet was then submitted due to strikes by Josh Koscheck at UFC Fight Night 6 and was submitted by Dustin Hazelett at UFC Fight Night 11.
Goulet then put together back to back wins in the UFC, first submitting Paul Georgieff in December 2007, and then winning via TKO over Kuniyoshi Hironaka and UFC 83.
Goulet fought at UFC: Fight For The Troops, taking on Mike Swick, where he lost via KO in the first round.
