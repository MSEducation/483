Edward II (25 April 1284 – 21 September 1327), also called Edward of Caernarfon, was King of England from 1307 until he was deposed in January 1327. The fourth son of Edward I, Edward became the heir to the throne following the death of his older brother Alfonso. He grew up to be tall, athletic and was considered good-looking by his contemporaries. From 1300 onward, Edward accompanied his father on his campaigns to pacify Scotland, and in 1307 he was knighted in a grand ceremony at Westminster Abbey. Edward succeeded to the throne later that year, following his father's death. In 1308 he married Isabella of France, the daughter of the powerful King Philip IV, as part of a long-running effort to resolve the tensions between the English and French crowns.
Edward had a very close relationship with Piers Gaveston, who had first joined his household in 1300. The precise nature of Edward and Gaveston's relationship is uncertain; they may have been friends, lovers or sworn brothers. Gaveston's position as Edward's favourite provoked discontent both among the barons and the French royal family, and Edward was forced to exile him. On Gaveston's return, the King was pressured into agreeing to wide-ranging reforms called the Ordinances of 1311. Gaveston was banished by the barons, to which Edward responded by revoking the reforms and recalling his favourite. Led by Edward's cousin, the Earl of Lancaster, a group of the barons seized and executed Gaveston in 1312, beginning several years of armed confronation. England was pushed back onto the defensive in Scotland, where Edward was decisively defeated by Robert the Bruce at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Widespread famine followed, and criticism of the King mounted.
The Despenser family, in particular Hugh Despenser the Younger, became close friends and advisers to Edward, but in 1321 Lancaster and many of the barons seized the Despensers' lands and forced the King to exile them. In response, Edward led a short military campaign, capturing and executing Lancaster. Edward and the Despensers strengthened their grip on power, revoking the 1311 reforms, executing their enemies and confiscating estates. Unable to make progress in Scotland, Edward finally signed a truce with Robert. Opposition to the regime grew, and when Isabella was sent to France to negotiate a peace treaty in 1325, she turned against Edward and refused to return. Isabella allied herself with the exiled Roger Mortimer, and invaded England with a small army in 1326. Edward's regime collapsed and he fled into Wales, where he was captured in November. Edward was forced to relinquish his crown in January 1327 in favour of his son, Edward III, and he died in Berkeley Castle on 21 September, probably murdered on the orders of the new regime.
Edward's relationship with Gaveston inspired Christopher Marlowe's 1592 play Edward II, along with other plays, films, novels and media. Many of these have focused on the possible homosexual relationship between the two men. Edward's contemporaries were highly critical of his performance as a king, noting his failures in Scotland and the oppressive regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics argued that the growth of parliamentary institutions during his reign were a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate has continued into the 21st century as to whether Edward was a lazy and incompetent king, or simply a reluctant and ultimately unsuccessful ruler.

Background

Edward II was the fourth son of Edward I and his first wife, Eleanor of Castile.
Despite his successes, Edward I died leaving a range of challenges for his son to resolve.

Early life (1284–1307)

Birth

Edward II was born in Caernarfon Castle in North Wales on 25 April 1284, less than a year after Edward I had conquered the region, and as a result is sometimes called Edward of Caernarfon.
Edward's name was English in origin, linking him to the Anglo-Saxon saint Edward the Confessor, and was chosen by his father in contrast to the more traditional Norman and Castilian names selected for Edward's brothers.

Childhood, personality and appearance

Spending on Edward's personal household increased as Edward grew older, and in 1293 William of Blyborough took over as its administrator.
Edward had a relatively normal childhood for a member of a royal family.

Edward grew up to be tall, muscular and was considered to be good looking by the standards of the period.
In 1290, Edward's father confirmed the Treaty of Birgham, in which he promised to marry his six-year old son to the young Margaret of Norway, who had a potential claim to the crown of Scotland. The idea was replaced with the proposal of a marriage to a daughter of the Count of Flanders, but this too fell through after it was blocked by Philip IV of France.

Early campaigns in Scotland

Between 1297 and 1298, Edward was left in charge of England while Edward I campaigned in Flanders against Philip IV, who had occupied part of the English King's lands in Gascony.
Edward I returned to Scotland once again in 1300, and this time took his son with him, making him the commander of the rearguard at the siege of Caerlaverock.
In 1305, Edward and his father quarreled, probably over the issue of money.
The Scottish conflict flared up once again in 1307, when Robert the Bruce killed his rival John Comyn and declared himself the King of the Scots.

Piers Gaveston and sexuality

During this time, Edward became close to a young man called Piers Gaveston.
The possibility that Edward had a homosexual relationship with Gaveston or his later favourites has been extensively discussed by historians, complicated by the paucity of surviving evidence to determine for certain the details of their relationships.
The contemporary evidence for a homosexual relationship comes primarily from an anonymous chronicler in the 1320s, who described how Edward "felt such love" for Gaveston that "he entered into a covenant of constancy, and bound himself with him before all other mortals with a bond of indissoluble love, firmly drawn up and fastened with a knot".
Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston may have simply been friends, with a close working relationship.
A more recent theory is that Edward and Gaveston entered into a bond of adoptive brotherhood. Such a compact, however, might not have excluded their relationship from having a sexual dimension as well.

Early reign (1307–11)

Coronation and marriage

Edward I mobilised another army for the Scottish campaign in 1307, which Prince Edward was due to join that summer.
In 1308, Edward's marriage to Isabella of France went ahead.
The pair were married in Boulogne on 25 January.
Isabella was only 12 years old at the time of her wedding, young by the standards of the period, and Edward probably had sexual relations with mistresses during their first few years together.

Tensions over Gaveston

Gaveston's return from exile in 1307 was initially accepted by the barons, but opposition quickly grew.
Parliament met in February 1308 in a febrile atmosphere.
Edward called for a fresh military campaign for Scotland, but this idea was quietly abandoned, and instead the King and the barons met in August 1308 to discuss reform.
The Pope agreed to annul Gaveston's sentence of excommunication, opening up the possibility of his return.

The Ordinances of 1311

Following his return, Gaveston's relationship with the major barons became increasingly difficult.
The King and parliament met again in February 1310, and the proposed discussions of Scottish policy were replaced by debate of domestic problems.
By now the Ordainers had drawn up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little political choice but to give way and accept them in October.

Mid-reign (1311–21)

Death of Gaveston

Tensions between Edward and the barons remained high, and the earls opposed to the King kept their personal armies mobilised late into 1311.
Edward responded by revoking the Ordinances and recalling Gaveston to England, being reunited with him at York in January 1312.
On the way back from the north, Pembroke stopped in the village of Deddington in the Midlands, putting Gaveston under guard there while he went to visit his wife.

Tensions with Lancaster and France

Reactions to the death of Gaveston varied considerably.
Meanwhile, the Earl of Pembroke had been negotiating with France to resolve the long-standing disagreements over the administration of Gascony, and as part of this Edward and Isabella agreed to travel to Paris in June 1313 to meet with Philip IV.
On his return from France, Edward found his political position greatly strengthened.

Battle of Bannockburn

By 1314, Robert the Bruce had recaptured most of the castles in Scotland once held by Edward, pushing raiding parties into northern England as far as Carlisle.
The battle began on 23 June as the English army attempted to force its way across the high ground of the Bannock Burn, which was surrounded by marshland. The English army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control.
Edward stayed behind to fight, but it became obvious to the Earl of Pembroke that the battle was lost and he dragged the King away from the battlefield, hotly pursued by the Scottish forces.

Famine and criticism

After the fiasco of Bannockburn, the earls of Lancaster and Warwick saw their political influence increase, and they pressured Edward to re-implement the Ordinances of 1311.
Edward's difficulties were exacerbated by prolonged problems in English agriculture, part of a wider phenomenon in northern Europe known as the Great Famine. The famine began with torrential rains in late 1314, followed by a very cold winter and bad rains the following the spring, killing many sheep and cattle in 1315; the bad weather continued, almost unabated, through into 1321, resulting in a string of bad harvests.
Meanwhile, Robert the Bruce exploited his victory at Bannockburn to raid northern England, initially attacking Carlisle and Berwick, and then reaching further south into Yorkshire and Lancashire, threatening York itself.
Complaints about Edward began to grow, many focusing on Edward's "improper" interest in rural pursuits.

Later reign (1321–26)

The Despenser War

Civil war finally broke out in England in 1321.
In early 1321, Lancaster mobilised a coalition of the Despensers' enemies across the Marcher territories.
Edward began to plan his revenge.
In December, Edward led his army across the River Severn and advanced into the Welsh Marches, where the opposition forces had gathered.

Edward and the Despensers

Edward punished Lancaster's supporters through a system of special courts across the country, with the judges instructed in advance how to sentence the accused, who were not allowed to speak in their own defence.
The English campaign against Scotland was planned on a massive scale, with a force of around 23,350 men.
Hugh Despenser the Younger lived and ruled in a grand style, playing a leading role in Edward's government, and executing policy through a wide network of family retainers.

War with France

Edward's problems over the Duchy of Gascony and its troubled relationship to the Kingdom of France, flared into open war in 1324.
Edward's forces in Gascony were around 4,400 strong, but the French army, commanded by Charles of Valois, numbered 7,000.

Fall from power (1326–27)

Rift with Isabella

Up until 1322, Edward and Isabella's marriage appears to have been broadly successful, but by the time that the Queen left for France in 1325 it had deteriorated considerably.
Isabella and Edward's envoys carried out negotiations with the French in late March.
Edward now expected Isabella and their son to return to England, but instead she remained in France and showed no intention of making her way back.
Opponents of Edward began to gather around Isabella and Mortimer in Paris, and Edward became increasingly anxious about the possibility that Mortimer might invade England.

Invasion

During August and September 1326 Edward mobilised his defences along the coasts of England to protect against the possibility of an invasion ether by France, or by Roger Mortimer.
Roger Mortimer and Isabella, accompanied by Edward's half-brother Edmund of Woodstock, landed in Orwell on 24 September with a small force of men and met with no resistance.
Edward continued west up the Thames Valley, reaching Gloucester between 9 and 12 October, hoping to reach Wales and from there mobilise an army against the invaders.
Edward's authority collapsed in England where, in the King's absence, Isabella's faction took over the administration with the support of the Church.

Abdication

Isabella and Mortimer rapidly took revenge on the former regime. Hugh Despenser the Younger was put on trial, declared a traitor and sentenced to be drawn, disembowelled, castrated and quartered; he was duly executed on 24 November.
There was no established procedure, however, for removing an English king.
Shortly after this, a representative delegation of barons, clergy and knights was sent to Kenilworth to speak to the King.

Death (1327)

Death and aftermath

Those opposed to the new government began to make plans to free Edward, and Roger Mortimer therefore decided to move Edward to the more secure location of Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire, where the former King arrived around 5 April 1327.
Concerns continued to be raised over fresh plots to liberate the former King, some involving the Dominican order and former household knights, and one such attempt got at least as far as breaking into the prison within the castle.
On 23 September Edward III was informed that his father had died at Berkeley Castle during the night of 21 September.
The rule of Isabella and Mortimer did not last long after the announcement of Edward's death. They made peace with the Scots in the Treaty of Northampton, but this move was highly unpopular.

Burial and cult

Edward's body was embalmed at Berkeley Castle, where it was viewed by local leaders from Bristol and Gloucester.
A temporary wooden effigy with a copper crown was made for the funeral; this is the known use of a funeral effigy in England, and was probably necessary because of the condition of the King's body, who had died three months before.
The King's tomb rapidly became a popular site for visitors, probably encouraged by the local monks, who lacked an existing pilgrim attraction.

Controversies

Rumours and controversy rapidly surrounded Edward's death.
Another set of controversial theories surround the possibility that Edward did not really die in 1327. These theories typically involve the "Fieschi Letter", sent to Edward III by an Italian priest called Manuel Fieschi, who claimed that Edward escaped Berkeley Castle in 1327 with the help of a servant, and ultimately retired to become a hermit in the Holy Roman Empire.
Some parts of the letter's content are considered broadly accurate by historians, although other aspects of its account have been criticised as implausible.

Edward as king

Kingship, government and law

Edward was ultimately a failure as a king; the historian Michael Prestwich observes that he "was lazy and incompetent, liable to outbursts of temper over unimportant issues, yet indecisive when it came to major issues", echoed by Roy Haines' description of Edward as "incompetent and vicious", and as "no man of business".
One of Edward's persistent challenges through most of his reign was a shortage of money; of the debts he inherited from his father, around £60,000 was still owing in the 1320s.
Edward was responsible for implementing royal justice through his network of judges and officials.
Parliament grew in importance under Edward as a means of making political decisions and answering petitions, although as the historian Claire Valente notes, the gatherings were "still as much an event as an institution".

Court

Edward's royal court was itinerant, travelling around the country with the King.
Music and minstrels were very popular at Edward's court, but hunting appears to have been a much less important activity, and there was little emphasis on chivalric events.

Religion

Edward's approach to religion was normal for the period, and the historian Michael Prestwich describes him as "a man of wholly conventional religious attitudes".
Edward enjoyed a good relationship with the Pope Clement X, despite the King intervening repeatedly in the operation of the English Church, including punishing bishops with whom he disagreed.
Pope John XXII was elected in 1316, seeking Edward's support for a new crusade, and was therefore also inclined to support him politically.

Legacy

Historiography

No chronicler for this period is entirely trustworthy or unbiased, often because their accounts were written to support a particular cause, but it is clear that most contemporary chroniclers were highly critical of Edward.
Historians in the 16th and 17th centuries focused on Edward's relationship with Gaveston, drawing comparisons between Edward's reign and the events surrounding the relationship of the Duc d'Épernon and Henry III of France, and between the Duke of Buckingham and Charles I. Views on Edward's sexuality have continued to develop over the years.
By the end of the 19th century, more administrative records from the period had become available to historians such as William Stubbs, Thomas Tout and J. C. Davies, who focused on the development of the English constitutional and governmental system during his reign.

Popular culture

Several plays have shaped Edward's contemporary image.
The filmmaker Derek Jarman adapted the Marlowe play into a film in 1992, creating a postmodern pastiche of the original, depicting Edward as a strong, explicitly homosexual leader, ultimately overcome by powerful enemies.
Edward's life has also been used in a wide variety of other media. The director David Bintley used Marlowe's play as the basis for the ballet Edward II, first performed in 1995; the music from the ballet forms apart of composer John McCabe's symphony Edward II, produced in 2000. Novels such as John Penford's 1984 The Gascon and Chris Hunt's 1992 Gaveston have focused on the sexual aspects of Edward and Gaveston's relationship, while Stephanie Merritt's 2002 Gaveston transports the story into the 20th century. Marcus Stone's painting Edward II and Piers Gaveston strongly hinted at a homosexual relationship between the pair, while avoiding making this aspect explicit; it was initially shown at the Royal Academy in 1872, but was marginalised in later decades as the issue of homosexuality became more sensitive.

Issue

Edward II had four children with Isabella:
Edward had also fathered the illegitimate Adam FitzRoy (c. 1307–1322), who accompanied his father in the Scottish campaigns of 1322 and died shortly afterwards.
