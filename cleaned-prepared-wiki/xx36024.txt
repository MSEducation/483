 the form of juxtaposed sequences of panels of images.  Often textual devices such as speech balloons, captions, and sound effects ("onomatopoeia") indicate dialogue, narration, or other information.  Elements such as size and arrangement of panels control narrative pacing.  Cartooning and similar forms of illustration are the most common image-making means in comics; fumetti is a form which uses photographic images.  Common forms of comics include comic strips, editorial and gag cartoons, and comic books.  Since the late 20th century, bound volumes such as graphic novels, comics albums, and tankōbon have become increasingly common, and online webcomics have proliferated.
The history of comics has followed divergent paths in different cultures.  Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings.  By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the US, western Europe (particularly France and Belgium), and Japan.  European comics traces its history to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the 1920s success of strips such as The Adventures of Tintin.  American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s.  Japanese comics and cartooning ("manga") traces its history to the 13th century.  Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th-century in imitation of Western strips, and by the 1930s comics magazines and book collections became common.  The post-World War II era saw the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka lead to rapid expansion of the popularity of comics in Japan.
 had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and within academia.  The English term comics derives from the humorous (or comic) work which predominated in early American newspaper comic strips; usage of the term has become standard also for non-humorous works.  It is common in English to refer to the comics of different cultures by the terms used in their original languages, such as "manga" for Japanese comics, or "bandes dessinées" for French-language comics.  There is no consensus amongst theorists and historians on a definition of comics; some emphasize the combination of images and text, some sequentiality or other image relations, and others historical aspects such as mass reproduction or the use of recurring characters.  The increasing cross-pollination of concepts from different comics cultures and eras has further made defining the medium difficult.

The European, American and Japanese comics traditions have followed different paths.
Outside of these direct genealogies, comics theorists and historians have seen precedents for comics in the Lascaux cave paintings in France (some of which appear to be chronological sequences of images), Egyptian hieroglyphs, Trajan's Column in Rome,

English-language comics

Illustrated humour periodicals were popular in 19th-century Britain, the earliest of which was the short-lived The Glasgow Looking Glass in 1825.  The most popular of which was Punch,
American comics first became a mass medium with the spread of newspaper comic strips following the success of Outcault's The Yellow Kid.
The popularity of superhero comic books declined following World War II,
Comics in the US has had a lowbrow reputation stemming from its roots in mass culture; cultural elites sometimes saw popular culture as threatening culture and society.  In the latter half of the 20th century, popular culture won greater acceptance, and the lines between "high" and "low" culture began to blur.  Comics, however, continued to be stigmatized, as the medium was seen as entertainment for children and illiterates.
The graphic novel—book-length comics—began to gain attention after Will Eisner popularized the term with his book A Contract with God (1978).

Franco-Belgian and European comics

The francophone Swiss Rodolphe Töpffer produced comic strips beginning in the 1830s,
Following the success of 
In the 1960s, the term 

Japanese comics

Japanese comics and cartooning (
Illustrated magazines for Western expatriates introduced Western-style satirical cartoons to Japan in the late 19th century.  New publications in both the Western and Japanese styles became popular, and at the end of the 1890s, American-style newspaper comics supplements began to appear,
The modern era of comics in Japan began after World War II, propelled by the success of the serialized comics of the prolific Osamu Tezuka,

Forms and formats

Comic strips are generally short, multi-panel comics that traditionally most commonly appeared in newspapers.  In American comic strips, daily strips have normally occupied a single tier, while Sunday strips have been given multiple tiers.  In the early 20th century, daily strips were typically in black-and-white, while Sundays were usually in colour and often occupied a full page.
Specialized comics periodicals formats vary greatly in different cultures.  Comic books, primarily an American format, are thin periodicals

Book-length comics take different forms in different cultures. European comics albums are most commonly printed in A4-size
Gag and editorial cartoons usually consist of a single panel, often incorporating a caption or speech balloon.  Definitions of comics which emphasize sequence usually exclude gag, editorial, and other single-panel cartoons; they can be included in definitions that emphasize the combination of word and image.
Webcomics are comics that are available on the internet.  They are able to reach large audiences, and new readers usually can access archived instalments.
Some consider storyboards

Comics studies


Similar to the problems of defining literature and film,
European comics studies began with Töpffer's theories of his own work in the 1840s, which emphasized panel transitions and the visual–verbal combination.  No further progress was made until the 1970s.
The first historical overview of Japanese comics was Seiki Hosokibara's 

Coulton Waugh attempted the first comprehensive history of American comics with The Comics (1947).
Cross-cultural study of comics is complicated by the great difference in meaning and scope of the words for "comics" in different languages.

Vocabulary and idioms

Panels are individual images containing a segment of action,
Text is frequently incorporated into comics via speech balloons, captions, and sound effects.  Speech balloons indicate dialogue (or thought, in the case of thought balloons), with tails pointing at their respective speakers.
Cartooning is most frequently used in making comics, traditionally using ink (especially India ink) with dip pens or ink brushes;
While comics are often the work of a single creator, the labour of making them is frequently divided between a number of specialists.  There may be a separate writer and artist, or there may be separate artists for the characters and backgrounds (as is common in Japan).  Particularly in American comic books,

Etymology

The English term comics derives from the humorous (or "comic") work which predominated in early American newspaper comic strips; usage of the term has become standard for non-humorous works as well.  The term "comic book" has a similarly confusing history: they are most often not humorous; nor are they regular books, but rather periodicals.
Many cultures have taken their words for comics from English, including Russian (
