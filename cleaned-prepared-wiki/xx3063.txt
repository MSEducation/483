[[Evolutionism]]

CATEGORIES: Biological evolution, Biology theories

Evolutionism was a widely held 19th century belief that organisms are intrinsically likely, over time, to increase in complexity through evolution. In the 1970s the term Neo-Evolutionism was used to describe the idea "that human beings sought to preserve a familiar style of life unless change was forced on them by factors that were beyond their control".Trigger, Bruce  (1986) A History of Archeological Thought Cambridge University Press pg 290
The term is sometimes also colloquially used to refer to acceptance of the modern evolutionary synthesis, a scientific theory that describes how biological evolution occurs. In addition, the term is used in a broader sense to cover a world-view on a wide variety of topics, including chemical evolution as an alternative term for abiogenesis or for nucleosynthesis of chemical elements, galaxy formation and evolution, stellar evolution, spiritual evolution, technological evolution and universal evolution, which seeks to explain every aspect of the world in which we live.
Since the overwhelming majority of scientists accept the modern evolutionary synthesis as the best explanation of current data,"Nearly all scientists (97%) say humans and other living things have evolved over time", Public Praises Science; Scientists Fault Public, Media, Pew Research Center, 9 July 2009 the term is seldom used in the scientific community; to say someone is a scientist implies acceptance of evolutionary views,

19th-century use

Evolution originally was used to refer to an orderly sequence of events with the outcome somehow contained at the start.  Edward B. Tylor and Lewis H Morgan brought the term "evolution" to anthropology though they tended toward the older pre-Spencerian definition helping to form the concept of unilineal evolution used during the later part of what Trigger calls the Antiquarianism-Imperial Synthesis period (c1770-c1900).Trigger, Bruce (1986) A History of Archaeological Thought Cambridge University Press pg 102

Modern use

In modern times, the term evolution is widely used, but the terms evolutionism and evolutionist are seldom used in the scientific community to refer to the biological discipline as the term is considered both redundant and anachronistic, though it has been used by creationists in discussing the creation-evolution controversy.
The Institute for Creation Research, in order to treat evolution as a category of religions, including atheism, fascism, humanism and occultism, commonly uses the words evolutionism and evolutionist to describe the consensus of mainstream science and the scientists subscribing to it, thus implying through language that the issue is a matter of religious belief. The goal of this argument is to equate the validity of the theory of evolution with the pseudoscientific concept of Intelligent Design.
The BioLogos Foundation, an organization that promotes the idea of theistic evolution, uses the term "evolutionism" to describe "the atheistic worldview that so often accompanies the acceptance of biological evolution in public discourse." It views this as a subset of scientism.
