[[File:EP Groups 1979-2009.

Overview

The first three Groups were established in the earliest days of the Parliament. They were the "Socialist Group" (which eventually became PES/S&D), the "Christian Democrat Group" (later EPP) and the "Liberals and Allies Group" (later ALDE).
As the Parliament developed, other Groups emerged. Gaullists from France founded the European Democratic Union Group. When Conservatives from Denmark and the United Kingdom joined, they created the European Conservatives Group, which (after some name changes) eventually merged with the European People's Party Group.
The 1979 first direct election established further groups and the establishment of European political parties such as the European People's Party. A full breakdown of Groups by complexion and timeline is given below.

Conservatives/Christian Democrats

In European politics, the centre-right is usually occupied by Christian democrats or by conservatives. The two strands have had a tangled relationship in the Parliament. The first Christian Democrat Group was founded in 1953 and stayed with that name for a quarter of a century. Meanwhile outside the Parliament, local Christian-democratic parties were organising and eventually formed the pan-national political party called the "European People's Party" on 29 April 1976. Since all the Christian-democratic MEPs were members of this pan-European party, the Group's name was changed to indicate this: first to the "Christian-Democratic Group (Group of the European People's Party)" on 14 March 1978, then to "Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)" on 17 July 1979. Meanwhile, on 16 January 1973, the "European Conservative Group" was formed by the British and Danish Conservative parties, which had recently joined the EEC. This group was renamed to the "European Democratic Group" on 17 July 1979. The EPP Group grew during the '80s, with parties such as the New Democracy of Greece and People's Party of Spain that were not explicitly Christian-democratic joining the Group. In contrast, the number of MEPs in the European Democratic Group fell over the same period and it eventually merged with the EPP Group on 1 May 1992. This consolidation of the centre-right continued during the 1990s, with MEPs from the highly heterogeneous centre-right Italian Forza Italia eventually settling down into the EPP Group on 15 June 1998, after spending nearly a year (19 July 1994 to 6 July 1995) in their own Group, self-referentially called "Forza Europa", and nearly three years (6 July 1995 to 15 June 1998) in the national-conservative Group called "Union for Europe". But the Conservatives were growing restless and on 20 July 1999 the EPP Group was renamed to the "Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats" (EPP-ED) to identify the Conservative parties within the Group. The Group remained under that name until after the 2009 European elections, when it reverted to the title "Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)" upon the exit of the European Democrats subgroup and its formation of the separate "European Conservatives and Reformists" group.

Social Democrats

In western Europe, social-democratic parties have been the dominant centre-left force since the dawn of modern European cooperation. The Socialist Group was one of the first Groups to be founded when it was created on 23 June 1953 in the European Parliament's predecessor, the Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community, and continued through the creation of the appointed Parliament in 1958 and the elected Parliament in 1979. Meanwhile, the national parties making up the Group were also organising themselves on a European level outside the Parliament, with the parties creating the "Confederation of Socialist Parties of the European Community" in 1974 and its successor, the "Party of European Socialists", in 1992. As a result, the Group (which had kept its "Socialist Group" name all along) was renamed to the "Group of the Party of European Socialists" on 21 April 1993 and it became difficult to distinguish between the Party of European Socialists party and the parliamentary group. The Group reverted to (approximately) its former name of the "Socialist Group in the European Parliament" on 20 July 2004 and was given a different logo, making it easier to distinguish the Group from the party. Despite all this, the Group was still universally referred to as "PES", notwithstanding the 2009 name change to the "Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats", a name chosen to accommodate the Democratic Party of Italy.

Liberals/centrists

In European politics, liberalism tends to be associated with classical liberalism, which advocates limited government intervention in society in general. However, the Liberal Group contains diverse parties. It has also been home to parties such as the minor Gaullist party Union for the New Republic and the centre-right Social Democratic Party of Portugal, which were not explicitly liberal parties, but who were not aligned with either the Socialist or the Christian Democratic Groups. The Liberal Group was founded on 23 June 1953 under the name of the "Group of Liberals and Allies". As the Parliament grew, it changed its name to the "Liberal and Democratic Group" (1976), then to the "Liberal and Democratic Reformist Group" (13 December 1985), then to the "Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party" (19 July 1994) before settling on its present name of the "Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe" on 20 July 2004, when the Group was joined by the centrist and social-liberal parties that formed the European Democratic Party.
Between 1994 and 1999 there was a separate "European Radical Alliance", which consisted out of MEPs of the French Radical Party of the Left, the Italian Bonino List (of the Italian Radicals) and regionalists aligned with the European Free Alliance.

National conservatives

Parties from certain European countries have been unwilling to join the centre-right European People's Party group. These parties generally have a national conservative or social-democratic agenda. The first such Group was formed when the French Gaullists split from the Liberal Group on 21 January 1965 and created a new Group called the "European Democratic Union" (not to be confused with the association of conservative and Christian-democratic parties founded in 1978 called the European Democrat Union nor the Conservative Group called the "European Democratic Group" founded in 1979). The Group was renamed on 16 January 1973 to the "Group of European Progressive Democrats" when the Gaullists were joined by the Irish Fianna Fáil and by the nationalist and social-democratic Scottish National Party, and renamed itself again on 24 July 1984 to the "Group of the European Democratic Alliance". The European Democratic Alliance joined with MEPs from Forza Italia to became the "Group Union for Europe" on 6 July 1995, but it didn't last and the Forza Italia MEPs left on 15 June 1998 to join the EPP, leaving Union for Europe to struggle on until it split on 20 July 1999. The French Rally for the Republic members joined the EPP, but Fianna Fáil and the Portuguese CDS–PP members joined a new group called "Union for Europe of the Nations Group". After the 2009 Parliament elections the Union for Europe of Nations group was disbanded due to a lack of members, with the remaining members splitting into factions, with some joining with the remaining members of Independence/Democracy to form Europe of Freedom and Democracy, a new Eurosceptic group, and the remaining members joining with the European Democrat former members of the EPP-ED to form the European Conservatives and Reformists group.

Greens/regionalists

In European politics, there has been a coalition between the Greens and the stateless nationalists or regionalists (who also support devolution). In 1984 Greens and regionalists gathered into the "Rainbow Group", a coalition of Greens, regionalists and other parties of the left unaffiliated with any of the international organisations. In 1989 Rainbow split. The Greens went off to form the "Green Group", whilst the regionalists stayed in Rainbow. Rainbow collapsed in 1994 and its members joined the "European Radical Alliance" under the French Radical Party of the Left. The Greens and regionalists stayed separate until 1999, when they reunited under the "Greens/European Free Alliance" banner.

Communists

The first communist group in the European Parliament was the "Communist and Allies Group" founded on 16 October 1973. It stayed together until 25 July 1989 when it split into two groups, the "Left Unity" Group with 14 members and the "Group of the European United Left" (EUL) with 28 members. EUL collapsed in January 1993 after the Italian Communist Party became the Democratic Party of the Left and its MEPs joined the Socialist Group, leaving Left Unity as the only leftist group before the 1994 elections. The name was resurrected immediately after the elections when the "Confederal Group of the European United Left" was formed on 19 July 1994. On 6 January 1995, when parties from Sweden and Finland joined, the Group was further renamed to the "Confederal Group of the European United Left–Nordic Green Left" and it has stayed that way to the present.

Nationalists

In European politics, a grouping of nationalist has thus far found it difficult to cohere in a continuous Group. The first nationalist Group was founded by the French National Front and the Italian Social Movement in 1984 under the name of the "Group of the European Right", and it lasted until 1989. Its successor, the "Technical Group of the European Right", existed from 1989 to 1994. There was then a gap of thirteen years until "Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty" was founded on 15 January 2007, which lasted for nearly eleven months until it fell apart on 14 November 2007 due to in-fighting.
In January 2008, leaders of nationalist parties across four countries announced another attempt at a pan-European nationalist European political party, provisionally called the "European Patriotic Party".
In October 2009, a loose grouping of nationalists under the label "Alliance of European Nationalist Movements" was confirmed with membership including Jobbik of Hungary, and the British National Party.

Eurosceptics

The specifically European school of political thought that states that the competences of the European Union should be reduced or prevented from expanding further, is represented in the European Parliament by the eurosceptics. The first Eurosceptic group in the European Parliament was founded on 19 July 1994. It was called the "European Nations Group" and it lasted until 10 November 1996. Its successor was the "Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations", founded on 20 December 1996. Following the 1999 election, the Group was reorganised into the "Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities" on 20 July 1999, and similarly reorganised after the 2004 election into the "Independence/Democracy Group" on 20 July 2004. The IND/DEM Group comprises 22 Members coming from 9 different countries, as follows: Czech Republic (1), Denmark (1), Greece (1), France (3), Ireland (1), The Netherlands (2), Sweden (2), UK (8), Poland (3). The group's leaders are Nigel Farage (United Kingdom Independence Party) and Kathy Sinnott (Independent, Ireland)

Heterogeneous

A Group is assumed to have a set of core principles ("affinities" or "complexion") to which the full members are expected to adhere. This throws up an anomaly: Groups get money and seats on Committees which Independent members do not get, but the total amount of Independent members may be greater than the members of the smaller Groups. In 1979, MEPs got round this by forming a Technical Group (formally called the "Group for the Technical Coordination and Defence of Independent Groups and Members", or "CDI" for short) as a coalition of parties ranging from centre-left to far-left, which were not aligned with any of the major international organizations.-A. Coppieters of the Flemish People's Union, Else Hammerich, Jens-Peter Bonde, Sven Skovmand, and Jørgen Bøgh of the Danish Eurosceptic list People's Movement against the EEC, the Irish independent MEP Neil Blaney, Luciana Castellina from the Italian Proletarian Unity Party, Mario Capanna from the Italian Proletarian Democracy, and Marco Pannella, Emma Bonino and Leonardo Sciascia of the libertarian Radical Party CDI lasted until 1984. On 20 July 1999, another Technical Group was formed, (formally called the "Technical Group of Independent Members – mixed group" or "TGI" for short). Since it contained far-right MEPs and centre-left MEPs, it could not possibly be depicted as having a common outlook. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs ruled that TGI did not have a coherent political complexion, Parliament upheld (412 to 56 with 36 abstentions) the ruling, and TGI was thus disbanded on 13 September 1999, the first Group to be forcibly dissolved. However, the ruling was appealed to the European Court of First Instance and the Group was temporarily resurrected on 1 December 1999 until the Court came to a decision. On 3 October 2001, president Fontaine announced that the Court of First Instance had declared against the appeal and that the disbandment was back in effect from 2 October 2001, the date of the declaration. TGI appeared on the list of Political Groups in the European Parliament for the last time on 4 October 2001. Since then the requirement that Groups have a coherent political complexion has been enforced (as ITS later found out), and "mixed" Groups are not expected to appear again.

Independents

Independent MEPs that are not in a Group are categorised as "Non-Inscrits" (the French term is universally used, even in English translations). This null-Group has no Group privileges or funding, and is included here solely for completeness.
