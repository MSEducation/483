History

Founding and Early History
John Clasen, a farmer and former state legislator, town assessor and school board member, is credited with the founding of Stamford Hospital.  After consultation with his friend and attorney, Edwin L. Scofield (later the second mayor of Stamford), regarding possible philanthropies, he gave the initial funding for the hospital by selling some of his property.    Clasen raised about $45,000 from the sale of the property.  Clasen's only conditions for the money were that the new institution would be named Stamford Hospital, be nonsectarian and not discriminate in receiving patients.  Subsequently, the hospital opened with 30 beds on May 7, 1896 in a mansion on East Main Street, just west of the railroad bridge.stamfordhospital.html Stamford Hospital Web site, Web page titled, "About Stamford Hospital: History" Excerpted from: The Story of Stamford Hospital 1896-1971 by Mary Updegraff; publisher, Stamford Hospital, 1971; accessed August 23, 2006
In 1954, Edgar L. Geibel, a graduate of the Yale School of Public Health,  became the chief administrator of the hospital, a position which he held for 23 years until his retirement in 1977. Under his leadership, the hospital experienced significant change and growth, including the  1966-1969 construction of the hospital's signature white pavilion wing designed by Perkins & Will.
Recent history
From 1994 to 2000, the hospital had significant financial difficulties, losing money in six of the seven years, including a $22 million loss in one year.  By 2001 the hospital's pension plan was underfunded by $40 million.  In 2001, Brian Grissler became the president and chief executive officer of the hospital.  Under his leadership, significant budgetary changes were made, including the laying off of 200 employees in 2002 and 2003, in order to address the hospital's loss of market share.  The hospital's finances began to improve, and revenues in 2007 were $357 million.
In early 2006, the hospital actively considered moving to a new, undetermined site and construct a new hospital in order to enlarge hospital rooms (which are approximately half the size of more modern hospitals), as well as expand and modernize clinical departments (particularly the emergency room, critical care units and cardiac labs).  However, this proposal was scrapped in favor of building a large expansion.  The expansion of the hospital, dubbed "New Stamford Hospital" will result in a large 11 story glass structure, to become the dominant portion of the hospital.  Ground was broken on this wing in May 2013 with expected completion date in 2016 and estimated cost of 575 Million dollars.Porstner, Donna, "Stamford to get $7M from feds", The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, Stamford edition, page 1
