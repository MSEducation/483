Charley "Chuck" Barrett (November 3, 1893 – May 21, 1924) was an American football player.  He was the consensus All-American quarterback in 1914 and 1915 while playing for Cornell University and led Cornell to an undefeated season and national championship in 1915.  He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1958.

Early years

Barrett was born in Bellevue, Pennsylvania, and raised in Cleveland, Ohio.  He attended the University School in Cleveland before enrolling at Cornell University.

Cornell

At Cornell, Barrett was quarterback for the football team and a pitcher for the baseball team.  He was Cornell's quarterback from 1913 to 1915 where he developed a reputation as "a real triple threat man" who kept opponents guessing, with his talents as a rusher, passer and kicker.
In Barrett's final college football game, Cornell trailed the Penn by a score of 9–0, but Barrett scored 24 points to lead the Big Red to a 24–9 victory. He scored on runs of 40, 25 and three yards and drop-kicked a field goal and three extra points.  The New York Times called him "the greatest football player ever developed at Cornell."
Barrett had difficulties keeping up with his classwork as a mechanical engineering student and was placed on academic probation in February 1915.

Later years and death

Barrett served as an ensign in the United States Navy during World War I.  In 1918, he was injured in an explosion on the armored cruiser USS Brooklyn in Yokohama harbor and never fully recovered from the injuries.  After returning to the United States, Barrett lived in Bellevue, Pennsylvania.  In November 1919, he married Edna Stevens in a private ceremony at the home of the bride's sister.
Barrett later went into the real estate business in Los Angeles, California.  He moved to Tucson, Arizona in 1923, hoping to recover his health.  He died in Tucson in May 1924 at age 30.
In 1925, a bronze tablet was unveiled on the Cornell campus containing the following tribute to Barrett:  "In memory of Charles Barrett, who died May 21, 1924, as a result of illness contracted in an explosion on the U.S.S. Brooklyn in Yokohama Harbor, Japan, during the World War. As a tribute to his splendid loyalty and leadership and as homage to a most worthy gridiron adversary, we respectfully dedicate this tablet to Cornell University.  His teammates and friends, and the 1915 Pennsylvania football team."
