History

Origins and Etymology

thumb|left|The c.1709 Thompson House in Setauket, Brookhaven's first settlement and namesakeThe first known inhabitants were Algonquian-speaking Native Americans, of the Setauket and Unkechaug tribes. The first English settlers arrived around 1640, and in 1655, several purchased Brookhaven's land from its tribal inhabitants. Early English settlers farmed, fished, and hunted whales.
thumb|right|The Miller Place Academy schoolhouse, c.1834The first English settlement was named Setauket after the native American tribe.  Brookhaven is the anglicized version of the Algonquin name Setauket. These terms were initially used interchangeably to describe the village or the town. The verbal division between the hamlet Setauket and township Brookhaven was not set until well into the 19th century.  A point of confusion is the existence of the hamlet named Brookhaven, which was in fact named for the township in 1879.

Governor Thomas Dongan issued a patent in 1686 which granted powers to the town and established a representative form of government.Brookhaven Town History, Town of Brookhaven, accessed 2009-06-05
Town Seal
Although there are no records on the original design plan, it is generally thought that the olive branch signified peace, and the whaling tools signified the most lucrative business in the Town of Brookhaven at the time. It is known that the letter "D" was the letter designated to the Town of Brookhaven by the Duke's Laws of 1665. The current seal was designed, retaining the original elements, but adding the Town of Brookhaven and the year 1686.
In 1976, The Brookhaven Town Bicentennial Commission proposed changing the date on the seal to 1655, recognizing the first deed of settlement of the Town of Brookhaven at Setauket on April 14, 1655.
Early Brookhaven was largely agrarian, with each hamlet being limited to a handful of families yet containing miles of land.  This economy was supplemented in coastal sections with fishing.  A major commercial center did non exist in Brookhaven until the early 19th century.

Development

thumb|right|Bathers at Bellport by William Glackensthumb|left|Shipyard in Port JeffersonIn the mid-19th century, several communities in Brookhaven prospered as shipbuilding ports.  The most successful of these are the villages of Port Jefferson and Patchogue, which remain the township's most bustling traditional downtowns.  Whaling and cordwood industries also developed in Brookhaven.
From the end of the late 19th century until the middle of the 20th, many communites along the North Shore and South Shore became successful resort towns. These hosted many urban residents, including numerous celebrities of the era, during the summer months.  Rural sections across Brookhaven served as campgrounds for youth clubs.
During the Gilded Age, Brookhaven underwent some of the same changes that affected Long Island's Gold Coast. Waterfront areas along the North Shore, including Belle Terre and Old Field, transformed from small fishing communities into fashionable and exclusive enclaves of the moneyed elite.

Modern history

In the post-war era, Brookhaven experienced a massive population boom.  This was partly due to its proximity to New York City along the Long Island Railroad and the highway system of Robert Moses. thumb|right|Simons Center for Geometry and Physics at Stony Brook University The township's most internationally renowned institutions, Stony Brook University and Brookhaven National Lab both date to the years following World War II.
During the mid-century, a number of major transformations were conducted by philanthropist Ward Melville in the Three Village area (The Setaukets, Stony Brook, and Old Field). Melville, an Old Field resident and owner of what later became CVS Corporation, used his fortune to transform Northwestern Brookhaven to his vision of an idealized New England-style region.  To this end, he ordered the construction in 1939 of Stony Brook Village, a picturesque commercial center set on village green in Stony Brook, with clapboard buildings designed to look as if they had colonial origins.  In 1962, Ward Melville donated 400 acres of land for the relocation of now-named Stony Brook University from Oyster Bay.

Government and politics

Patchogue was the town seat of Brookhaven until 1986, when it moved to Medford and then its current location near Bald Hill in Farmingville.

Prior to 2002, the Town of Brookhaven Republican Party controlled the majority of the town board for several decades, except for a four-year period in the mid-1970s when Democrats held a majority under Supervisor John Randolph.[ref]

This one-party domination, and a series of scandals, led to a tarnished reputation of local politics accorded the nickname "Crookhaven".[ref]

In 2002, a voter proposition was passed to create council districts, replacing the prior system of electing the six town council members at-large. Steve Fiore-Rosenfield became the first Democrat to be elected since the 1970s in 2003.
In 2005, Brian X. Foley, a Democratic county legislator, won the Town Supervisor race.
Following the election of 2007, the Republican Party regained a majority on the Brookhaven Town Board, and elected Councilman Tim Mazzei as majority leader.
In 2008, Brian X. Foley was elected to the State Senate. He was replaced as Supervisor by Democrat Mark Lesko. In late 2012, Lesko retired and was replaced by Edward Romaine, a Republican who had previously been Suffolk County Legislator and county clerk.
