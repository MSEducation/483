Reception

The series was met with mixed feedback. Christopher Stevens of the Daily Mail commented: "If we were expecting old-fashioned comedy, we're certainly getting it. The traditional approach brings benefits. There's no wobbly handheld camera work, no improvised dialogue, no barrage of foul language, no filthy single entendres. Instead, there's a brisk script with plenty of jokes. This has the feel of a sitcom that will win viewers over." and The Guardian said of Walliams: "This performance, and his writing, gives the show good jokes and heart."
There was negative feedback to the opening of the series, with The Daily Telegraph stating: "A bit tired, perhaps, the school thing, but surely a straightforward setting for a sitcom" before concluding "Let's just put it this way: amusing it was not. Mission aborted." MSN UK said, "Like most BBC comedies aiming to please mass audiences, there were plenty of moments that didn't work, but the writing avoided being outright terrible. A family show like this (even one inexplicably broadcast post-watershed) simply can't please everyone all the time".
The series opened to 4.2m viewers. The second instalment scored 3.63m (17.4%) for BBC One, making it the most watched programme of primetime outside of the soaps and news for the night.

DVD release

The first series of Big School was released onto DVD on 23 September 2013.
