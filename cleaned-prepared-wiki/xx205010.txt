In popular culture

In film

The rivalry between the teams, specifically the clubs' two hooligan firms has been depicted on the big screen several times. In 1989 Alan Clarke directed The Firm, starring real-life Millwall supporter Gary Oldman. A remake of The Firm, also titled The Firm was released in 2009 by Nick Love, director of The Football Factory and himself a Millwall supporter.[ref]
 

In literature

As with film, the rivalry between the clubs' hooligan firms has been covered in books such as Congratulations You Have Just Met the ICF by Cass Pennant, leader of the Inter City Firm. Sunday Mirror columnist Michael Calvin spent the 2009–10 season covering Millwall, writing the book Family: Life, Death and Football. The beginning extensively features the rivalry and the stabbing of a Millwall supporter before the 2009 Upton Park riot game. 1–11
