[[Laotian American]]

CATEGORIES: Asian American, American people of Laotian descent, Laotian American, Laotian diaspora

Laotian Americans are Americans who were originally from Laos, a person of Laotian descent residing in America. Laotian Americans are included in the larger category of Asian Americans.  The major immigrant generation were generally refugees who escaped Laos during the warfare and disruption of the 1970s, and entered refugee camps in Thailand across the Mekong River. They emigrated to the United States during the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s.
Although many Hmong people and Iu Mien are from Laos, they have a distinct culture, language and ethnicity, and identify as different ethnic groups.  They generally identify as Hmong Americans and Iu Mien American, rather than Lao Americans.  The "national origin" category of Laotian American, which is different from ethnic groups, includes all ethnic groups who lived within the borders of Laos, such as the Hmong, ethnic Chinese, ethnic Vietnamese, and ethnic French or other Europeans.

History and demographics

Laotian immigration to the United States started shortly after the Vietnam War. Refugees began arriving in the U.S. after a Communist government came to power in Laos in 1975 and by 1980, the Laotian population of the U.S. reached 47,683, according to census estimates. These numbers increased dramatically during the 1980s, so that the census estimated that there were 147,375 people by 1990.  The group continued to grow, somewhat more slowly, to 167,792 by 2000. Included are the Hmong, a mountainous tribe from that country with their own ethnic designation: Hmong Americans.

Theravada Buddhist temples

Laotian-American populations have constructed numerous Buddhist temples, called Vat or Wat. Usually attendees adapt a house for religious worship.  Over time, the congregation donates money to customize and add onto the facility, as well as to add fine artwork and craftsmanship, resulting in a Laotian Buddhist temple that has some traditional features. Examples include Wat Lao Buddhavong located outside Washington, D.C.; Wat Lao Buddharam of San Diego, California; Wat Lao of S. Farmington, Minnesota; Wat Lao Buddhamamakaram of Columbus, Ohio; Wat Lao Mixayaram and Wat Lao Dhammacetiyaram of Seattle, Washington; and the Wat Lao Mixayaram in Lowell, Massachusetts. With the growth of Laotian communities in more diverse areas, they have moved to and constructed temples in rural areas, such as Lane Xang Village, located between Lafayette and New Iberia in Louisiana."Bayou Lotus: Theravada Buddhism in Southwestern Louisiana", Northern Tulane University
