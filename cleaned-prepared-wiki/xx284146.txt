History

Origins

The RideLondon event, including the RideLondon–Surrey Classic, is a legacy event of the 2012 Summer Olympics and the idea for the elite race can be traced back to the successful organisation and public reaction to the Olympic Road Cycling races in 2012 and the Olympic test event, the London-Surrey Cycle Classic, held a year earlier.
The route chosen for the RideLondon–Surrey Classic is a variation on that used by both the London-Surrey Cycle Classic and the Olympic Road Cycling races.
