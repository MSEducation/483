The U.S. Grant Hotel is a historic hotel in downtown San Diego, California.  It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is 11 stories high and has 270 guest rooms in addition to meeting rooms and a ballroom.

History

The hotel was built by Ulysses S. Grant, Jr., son of president Ulysses S. Grant, who named the hotel after his father.
Famous guests have included Albert Einstein, Charles Lindbergh,
The inaugural San Diego Comic-Con International, which was then called "San Diego's Golden State Comic-Con," was held at the U.S. Grant Hotel in 1970. 
The hotel was refurbished in the 1980s, but fell upon hard times in the subsequent decade due to a financial slump.
The hotel's signature restaurant is the Grant Grill, which opened in 1952. It became a power-lunch spot for downtown businessmen and politicians, so much so that "ladies" were not permitted in the restaurant after 3 PM. In 1969 a group of prominent local women staged a sit-in which resulted in the restaurant abandoning its men-only policy.San Diego Union Tribune, September 3, 2006
The Grant Hotel was, for nearly 35 years, until 1974, known as the site of the annual reunion dinner of the "Great White Fleet Association," a group of sailors who sailed on the cruise of 16 white battleships from 1907-09. These dinners attracted a wide range of military officials and guests from all over the world.
