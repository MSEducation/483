It's almost as if there were two Patriot Acts, and many members of Congress have not read the one that matters. Our constituents, of course, are totally in the dark. Members of the public have no access to the secret legal interpretations, so they have no idea what their government believes the law actually means.""Sunday editorial: Oregon Sen.

On November 19, 2010, Wyden announced he would take the steps necessary to put a hold on The Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA) so it is not enacted into law that year. If it were enacted, it would allow the Attorney General the authority to order internet providers in the US to block access to websites that were deemed to contain copyright infringement. This effectively requires the law to be resubmitted next year rather than be rushed through the system at the end of the congress.  He stated:
 "It seems to me that online copyright infringement is a legitimate problem, but it seems to me that COICA as written is the wrong medicine. Deploying this statute to combat online copyright infringement seems almost like using a bunker-busting cluster bomb when what you really need is a precision-guided missile. The collateral damage of this statute could be American innovation, American jobs, and a secure Internet."Senator: Web Censorship Bill A 'Bunker-Busting Cluster Bomb'

Fulton, III, "SOPA Opponents Sign On to Wyden-Issa Alternative Piracy Bill" (December 13, 2011). ReadWriteWeb.
Ezra Klein wrote: "Perhaps no single member of Congress deserves as much credit for slowing the advance" of the bills than Wyden, who for much of 2010 "fought a one-man battle to keep the Senate version of the legislation from moving through on a unanimous vote."Ezra Klein, "Interview: Sen. Ron Wyden's fight to stop SOPA and save the Internet" (January 17, 2012). Washington Post. Wyden was described as the "primary driver of opposition to the bill within the Senate."Greg Sargent, "Wyden: SOPA win was a 'grassroots victory for the history books'" (January 20, 2012).
