The Fox Broadcasting Company, commonly referred to as the Fox network or simply Fox, is an American commercial broadcasting television network owned by the Fox Entertainment Group.
As of October 2012, Fox maintains 19.5 hours of programming per week.
Unlike the "three larger networks", which aired primetime programming from 8 to 11 pm (EST) Mondays to Saturdays and 7 to 11 pm (EST) Sundays, Fox has traditionally avoided programming in the 10 pm (EST) time interval, leaving that hour to affiliates to program locally.
