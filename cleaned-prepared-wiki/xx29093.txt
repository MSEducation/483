History

Sarasota County was created in 1921. After acquisition by the United States as a territory and once Florida obtained state status, the area now included in the county had been governed by Hillsborough County, then Manatee County as the state was divided into smaller and smaller governmental organizations. Manatee County was carved up to allow the creation of three more counties as well.
Although the name was associated with the area from the beginning of European contacts the origin of the name, Sarasota, is unknown. Some believe a fanciful story created for a popular early twentieth-century pageant held in Sarasota, that it was named after the daughter of famous explorer Hernando de Soto's daughter Sara.
According to the Florida League of Cities FLC, the name first appeared in print as "Zarazote" on a 1763 land grant map.

Gulf Gate Library
In 1964 a bookmobile from the County Library downtown made periodic visits to the Gulf Gate neighborhood, parking at Gulf Gate Mall.  Several years later residents requested more permanent library facilities.  In 1973 the bookmobile was replaced with a small branch library in a rented store front on Gateway Avenue.  The first Gulf Gate Library Branch opened with 4,569 volumes on its shelves.  Another move to a larger storefront at 6621 Gulf Gate Drive was necessary due to lack of space for new purchases.  In 1980 the branch was providing services for approximately 7,000 library cardholders and offering a variety of programs.d.), History of the Gulf gate Library. Archives of the Friends of the Gulf Gate Library.
The Friends of the Gulf Gate Library Association was formed in 1976 with a purpose of supporting the library on Gulf Gate Drive.  In 1977 Leslie Shoemaker donated 2 ½ acres of land at the corner of Gulf Gate Drive and Curtiss Avenue in memory of his wife that was to be used as a new location for a permanent library building.  The same year the Friends of the Gulf Gate Library changed their name to the Key-Gate Library Association to represent the area the new library would be serving.  With only partial funding for construction of a new library from the County Commission, the Key-Gate Library Association began a building fund drive.  Under the leadership of Ann Marbut the Key-Gate Library Association began a fund raising campaign.  In 1982 the architectural plans by Padgett, Ritter & Harris were approved and groundbreaking was scheduled for August.   The Gulf Gate Library opened on December 5, 1983.  The new library had 10,000 square feet of space and was designed to hold 50,000 books.  In 1991, due to increasing circulation, a second building campaign began to expand the library by 3000 square feet.  On July 13, 1993 groundbreaking took place for the additional space.  In 1994 the additional space was opened. (1981, March 24). A report to the Sarasota County Commissioners and a request for funding from Key-Gate Library Association. 
Having outgrown their current space, Gulf Gate Library closed on January 19, 2013 to prepare to move to a temporary location in Sarasota Square Mall.  The library reopened on February 19th at the mall location.   Construction of a new library will begin later in the year on the same site as the existing building.
