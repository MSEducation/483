UN/LOCODE, the United Nations Code for Trade and Transport Locations, is a geographic coding scheme developed and maintained by United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). UN/LOCODE assigns codes to locations used in trade and transport with functions such as seaports, rail and road terminals, airports, Postal Exchange Office and border crossing points. The first issue in 1981 contained codes for 8,000 locations. The version from 2011 contained codes for about 82,000 locations.

Structure

UN/LOCODEs have five characters. The first two characters are letters. They code a country by the table defined in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2. The three remaining characters code a location within that country. Letters are preferred, but if necessary digits 2 through 9 may be used, excluding "0" and "1" to avoid confusion between "O" and "0" and between "I" and "1".
For each country there can be a maximum of 26*26*26 = 17 576 entries, using only letters, or 34*34*34 = 39 304 entries using letters and digits.
For the US, the 17 576 possible letter combinations have been almost exhausted. In 2006, the Secretariat added 646 entries to the 2006-2 issue of UN/LOCODE, in which the third position of 3-character codes is a digit from 2 to 9. The 2007 issue of UN/LOCODE contains 689 such US entries.

Loose consistency with existing IATA airport codes

For airports, the three letters following the country code are not always identical to the IATA airport code. According to the Secretariat note for Issue 2006-2, there are 720 locations showing a different IATA code.

Official UN/LOCODE tables

UN/LOCODEs are released as a table. An individual revision is officially referred to as an "issue". A discussion of the table's structure follows.

Examples

Data fields

The fields are listed in the official order.

=Ch (Changes)=

=Locode=

=Name=

=Name Without Diacritics=

=SubDiv (Subdivision)=

=Function=

Each defined function gets a classifier; the most important are:

=Status=

=Date=

Observation: The edition published in 2008 contains for additions the value 0701, while in other cases the exact month is used like 9710, 0212.

Errors

In 2006-07 IQ IRB for Irbil was added while IQ ABL Arbil with almost the same coordinates existed. In the 2007 edition IQ ABL gets marked for deletion and IQ EBL Erbil International Apt is added to the database, but with a different coordinates, reflecting the distance between airport and city. The error is to delete ABL and to insert IRB.}
Occasionally locations are listed twice; this is not necessarily an error. In issue 2006-1, ARSMC  San Miguel de Tucumán (functions 2,3) was added while ARTUC  Tucumán (function 1) already was in the list. The coordinates are with very little deviation the same. Also in 2006-1, ARSSJ  San Salvador de Jujuy was added (function 4) while ARJUJ  Jujuy (functions 1,2,3,5) already existed.

2009-1

The 2009-1 release added several entries for Ukraine where the longitude is off by a few orders of magnitude. Ranging from 23230E to 38829E, they are outside what would constitute an eastern longitude. Ivano Frankovsk and Chuguyev have two entries now, along with Nikolayev. For all three, the romanized spelling varies.

Problems

Some entries do not have coordinates, so it is not clear where they actually refer to. If an IATA code changes, then the UN/LOCODE could also be considered to have changed.
