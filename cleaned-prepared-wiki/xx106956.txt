He was living in Toronto in May 1968 when he first met with Prabhupada on June 1, 1968. During a three-month period when Prabhupada stayed in Montreal, Gopal Krishna regularly heard from him on devotional topics and took instruction regarding his own personal life. Within two weeks of meeting him, Gopal Krishna Khanna decided to accept Prabhupada as his spiritual master.

In 1975, Prabhupada sent Gopal Krishna to India, giving him the responsibility of being a Governing Body Commissioner within the area, instructing him specifically to print and expand the distribution of his books in India and to translate and print books in Indian languages. Prabhupada was pleased when Gopal Krishna presented him the first copies of the Srimad Bhagavatam translated into Hindi.

He took sannyasa initiation from Jayapataka Swami and the name, Tridandi Swami Gopal Krishna Goswami Maharaja.  Since then Gopal Krishna Goswami has been traveling extensively all over the world preaching Gaudiya Vaishnavism, initiating disciples, delivering talks, and overseeing various philanthropic and devotional projects.List of Sannyasis in ISKCON April 2008 ISKCON Sannyasa Ministry, Retrieved on 5 May 2008 (primary source)
