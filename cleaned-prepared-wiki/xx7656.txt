[[McIntosh (apple)]]

CATEGORIES: Apple cultivars

The McIntosh, McIntosh Red, or colloquially the Mac () is an apple cultivar.  The fruit has red and green skin, a tart flavour, and tender white flesh, and ripens in late September.  In the 20th century it was the most popular cultivar in Eastern Canada and New England, and is considered an all-purpose apple, suitable both for cooking and eating raw.  Apple Inc. employee Jef Raskin named the Macintosh line of personal computers after the fruit.
John McIntosh discovered the original McIntosh sapling on his Dundela farm in Upper Canada in 1811.  He and his wife bred it, and the family started grafting the tree and selling the fruit in 1835.  In 1870 it entered commercial production, and became common in northeastern North America after 1900.  While still important in production, the fruit's popularity fell in the early 21st century in the face of competition from varieties such as the Gala.

Description

The McIntosh or McIntosh Red (nicknamed the "Mac"),
A spreading tree that is moderately vigorous, the McIntosh bears annually or in alternate years.
The McIntosh apple is a small- to medium-sized round fruit with a short stem.  It has a red and green skin that is thick, tender, and easy to peel.  Its white flesh is sometime tinged with green or pink and is juicy, tender, and firm, soon becoming soft.  The flesh is easily bruised.
The fruit is considered "all-purpose", suitable both for eating raw and for cooking.
The fruit grows best in cool areas where nights are cold and autumn days are clear; otherwise, it suffers from poor colour and soft flesh, and tends to fall from the tree before harvest.  It stores for two to three months in air, but is prone to scald, flesh softening, chilling sensitivity,

Cultivation

The McIntosh is most commonly cultivated in Canada, the United States, and eastern Europe.
If unsprayed, the McIntosh succumbs easily to apple scab, which may lead to entire crops being unmarketable.  It has generally low susceptibility to fire blight, powdery mildew, cedar-apple rust, quince rust, and hawthorn rust.  It is susceptible to fungal diseases such as Nectria canker, brown rot, black rot, race 1 of apple rust (but resists race 2).  It is moderately resistant to Pezicula bark rot and Alternaria leaf blotch, and resists brown leaf spot well.
The McIntosh is one of the most common cultivars used in cloning; a 1996 study found that the McIntosh was a parent in 101 of 439 cultivars selected, more than any other founding clone.

History

Apple trees were introduced to Canada at the Habitation at Port-Royal (modern Port Royal, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia) as early as 1606 by French settlers.  Following its introduction, apple cultivation spread inland.
The McIntosh's discoverer, John McIntosh (1777 – 
While clearing the overgrown plot McIntosh discovered some wild apple seedlings on his farm.  He transplanted the seedlings next to his house.  One of the seedlings bore particularly good fruit.
John McIntosh's son Allan (1815–1899)
Horticulturist William Tyrrell Macoun of the Central Experimental Farm in Ottawa is credited with popularizing the McIntosh in Canada.  He stated the McIntosh needed "no words of praise", that it was "one of the finest appearing and best dessert apples grown".  The Macoun, a hybrid of the McIntosh and Jersey Black grown by the Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, NY, was named for him in 1923.
The McIntosh made up 40% of the Canadian apple market by the 1960s;
The original tree discovered by John McIntosh bore fruit for more than ninety years, and died in 1910.

Cultural significance

Apple Inc. employee Jef Raskin named the Macintosh line of personal computers after the McIntosh.  He deliberately misspelled the name to avoid conflict with the hi-fi equipment manufacturer McIntosh Laboratory.  Apple's attempt in 1982 to trademark the name Macintosh was nevertheless denied due to the phonetic similarity between Apple's product and the name of the hi-fi manufacturer.  Apple licensed the rights to the name in 1983, and bought the trademark in 1986.
In 1995 the Royal Canadian Mint commissioned Toronto artist Roger Hill to design a commemorative silver dollar for release in 1996.  Mint engraver Sheldon Beveridge engraved the image of a group of three McIntoshes and a McIntosh blossom which adorn one side with a ribbon naming the variety.  An inscription on the edge reads "1796 Canada Dollar 1996".  Issued sheathed in a silver cardboard sleeve in a black leatherette case, 133,779 pieces of the proof were sold, as well as 58,834 pieces of the uncirculated version in a plastic capsule and silver sleeve.
