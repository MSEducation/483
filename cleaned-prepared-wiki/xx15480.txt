The Boeing AH-64 Apache is a four-blade, twin-engine attack helicopter with a tailwheel-type landing gear arrangement, and a tandem cockpit for a two-man crew. It features a nose-mounted sensor suite for target acquisition and night vision systems. It is armed with a  M230 Chain Gun carried between the main landing gear, under the aircraft's forward fuselage. It has four hardpoints mounted on stub-wing pylons, typically carrying a mixture of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles and Hydra 70 rocket pods. The AH-64 has a large amount of systems redundancy to improve combat survivability.
The Apache originally started as the Model 77 developed by Hughes Helicopters for the United States Army's Advanced Attack Helicopter program to replace the AH-1 Cobra. The prototype YAH-64 was first flown on 30 September 1975. The U.S. Army selected the YAH-64 over the Bell YAH-63 in 1976, and later approved full production in 1982. After purchasing Hughes Helicopters in 1984, McDonnell Douglas continued AH-64 production and development. The helicopter was introduced to U.S. Army service in April 1986. The first production AH-64D Apache Longbow, an upgraded Apache variant, was delivered to the Army in March 1997. Production has been continued by Boeing Defense, Space & Security; over 1,000 AH-64s have been produced to date.
The U.S. Army is the primary operator of the AH-64; it has also become the primary attack helicopter of multiple nations, including Greece, Japan, Israel, the Netherlands and Singapore; as well as being produced under license in the United Kingdom as the AgustaWestland Apache. U.S. AH-64s have served in conflicts in Panama, the Persian Gulf, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Israel used the Apache in its military conflicts in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip; British and Dutch Apaches have seen deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Development

Advanced Attack Helicopter

Following the cancellation of the AH-56 Cheyenne in 1972, in favor of U.S. Air Force and Marine Corps projects like the A-10 Thunderbolt II and Harrier, the United States Army sought an aircraft to fill an anti-armor attack role that would still be under Army command;
Proposals were submitted by Bell, Boeing Vertol/Grumman team, Hughes, Lockheed, and Sikorsky. In July 1973, the U.S. Department of Defense selected finalists Bell and Hughes Aircraft's Toolco Aircraft Division (later Hughes Helicopters). This began the phase 1 of the competition. 7. Each company built prototype helicopters and went through a flight test program. Hughes' Model 77/YAH-64A prototype first flew on 30 September 1975, while Bell's Model 409/YAH-63A prototype first flew on 1 October 1975. After evaluating the test results, the Army selected Hughes' YAH-64A over Bell's YAH-63A in 1976. Reasons for selecting the YAH-64A included its more damage tolerant four-blade main rotor and the instability of the YAH-63's tricycle landing gear arrangement. 8. 114.
The AH-64A then entered phase 2 of the AAH program under which three pre-production AH-64s would be built, additionally, the two YAH-64A flight prototypes and the ground test unit were upgraded to the same standard. Weapons and sensor systems were integrated and tested during this time, including the laser-guided AGM-114 Hellfire missile. 8. Development of the Hellfire missile had began in 1974, originally known by the name of Helicopter Launched, Fire and Forget Missile ('Hellfire' being a shortened acronym),

Into production

In 1981, three pre-production AH-64As were handed over to the U.S. Army for Operational Test II. The Army testing was successful, but afterward it was decided to upgrade to the more powerful T700-GE-701 version of engine, rated at  In 1986, the incremental or flyaway cost for the AH-64A was $7M and the average unit cost was approximately $13.9M based on total costs.
During the 1980s, McDonnell Douglas was studying an AH-64B, featuring an updated cockpit, new fire control system and other upgrades. In 1988, funding was approved for a multi-stage upgrade program to improve sensor and weapon avionic systems.
Portions of the Apache are produced by various aerospace firms. AgustaWestland has produced number of components for the Apache, both for the international market and for the British Army's AgustaWestland Apache.
In April 2006, Boeing was awarded a $67.6M fixed-price contract for the remanufacture of several existing U.S. AH-64As to the AH-64D configuration; between May 2009 and July 2011, a further five contracts were issued to remanufacture batches of AH-64As to the upgraded D variant.

Design

Overview

The AH-64 Apache has a four-blade main rotor and a four-blade tail rotor.
The crew compartment has shielding between the cockpits, such that at least one crew member can survive hits. The compartment and the rotor blades are designed to sustain a hit from  of protection and has a self-sealing fuel system to protect against ballistic projectiles. 16–17. The aircraft was designed to meet the crashworthiness requirements of MIL-STD-1290,The History of Helicopter Safety.  which specifies minimum requirement for crash impact energy attenuation to minimize crew injuries and fatalities. This was achieved through incorporation of increased structural strength, crashworthy landing gear, seats and fuel system.

Avionics and targeting

One of the revolutionary features of the Apache was its helmet mounted display, the Integrated Helmet and Display Sighting System (IHADSS);."ASP Motion Base for Stabilized Mounts". Department of Defense Small Business Innovation Research. Retrieved June 2012. U.S. Army via GlobalSecurity. Retrieved June 2012.
The U.S. Army's Aerial Weapons Scoring System Integration with Longbow Apache Tactical Engagement Simulation System  (AWSS-LBA TESS) provides the LBA pilots the ability to conduct force-on-target engagements using live ammunition for 30 mm and rocket engagements and simulated Hellfire missile engagements. The Smart Onboard Data Interface Module (SMODIM) transmits aviation data from the Apache to the AWSS ground station to support gunnery scoring. Trainers and commanders use AWSS to score the pilot's live-fire gunnery performance and provide constructive AAR feedback.
The AH-64 was designed to perform in front-line environments, and to operate at night or day and during adverse weather conditions.
In August 2012, 24 AH-64D were equipped with the Ground Fire Acquisition System (GFAS), which detects and targets ground-based weapons fire sources in all-light conditions and with a 120° field of vision. The GFAS consists of two sensor pods working with the AH-64's other sensors, an infrared camera precisely locates ground-based threats.com, 26 October 2012. In 2014, it was announced that new targeting and surveillance sensors were under development to provide high-resolution color imagery to crews, instead of the Apache's current low definition black and white picture quality.

Armaments and configurations

The AH-64 is adaptable to numerous different roles within its context as Close Combat Attack (CCA), it has a customizable weapons loadout mounted on stub-wings for the role desired. In addition to the 30 mm M230E1 Chain Gun, the Apache carries a range of external stores on its stub-wing pylons, typically a mixture of AGM-114 Hellfire anti-tank missiles, and Hydra 70 general-purpose unguided  rockets. 124–127.

Operational history

United States Army

The U.S. Army formally accepted its first production AH-64A in January 1984 and training of the first pilots began later that year. 14–15. 33–34. Boeing, 2004. The first operational Apache unit, 7th Battalion, 17th Cavalry Brigade, began training on the AH-64A in April 1986 at Fort Hood, Texas. 6. Two operational units with 68 AH-64s first deployed to Europe in September 1987 and took part in large military exercises there. 47–48. 121. The Apache was first used in combat in 1989, during Operation Just Cause, the invasion of Panama. The AH-64 participated in over 240 hours of combat attacking various targets, mostly at night. 51–52. 16–17. General Carl Stiner, the commander of the operation, commented that: "You could fire that Hellfire missile through a window from four miles away at night". 7.
Upon fielding the Apache, capabilities such as using the FLIR for extensive night operations made it clear that the AH-64 was capable of operating beyond the forward line of own troops (FLOT) that previous attack helicopters were normally restricted to. 212–213. It was discovered that the Apache was coincidentally fitted with the same Have Quick UHF radio system used by the U.S. Air Force; once recognized, inter-service coordination and joint operations such as the joint air attack teams (JAAT) were encouraged and inserted into standard training. The Apache have operated extensively with close air support (CAS) aircraft such as the USAF's Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II and the USMC's McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II, often acting as a target designator to conserve the Apache's own munitions. 215–218.
Nearly half of all U.S. Apaches were deployed to Saudi Arabia following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. During Operation Desert Storm on 17 January 1991, eight AH-64As guided by four MH-53 Pave Low IIIs destroyed part of Iraq's radar network in the operation's first attack,Bishop 2005, pp. 17–18. allowing aircraft to evade detection. 144–145. The Apaches each carried an asymmetric load of Hydra 70 flechette rockets, Hellfires, and one auxiliary fuel tank. Lightning in the Storm. Hippocrene Books, 2003. ISBN 0-7818-1017-5. During the 100-hour ground war a total of 277 AH-64s took part, destroying 278 tanks, numerous armored personnel carriers and other Iraqi vehicles.Apache Helicopter Was Considered Effective in Combat, but Reliability Problems Persist
The AH-64 played roles in the Balkans during separate conflicts in Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s. 21–24, 33.
In 2000, Major General Dick Cody, commanding officer of the 101st Airborne, wrote a strongly worded memo to the U.S. Army Chief of Staff about training and equipment failures. The Washington Post dedicated a front-page article to the failures in Kosovo, commenting that: "The vaunted helicopters came to symbolise everything wrong with the Army as it enters the 21st century: Its inability to move quickly, its resistance to change, its obsession with casualties, its post-Cold War identity crisis". 61. The Apache did not conduct any combat missions over Kosovo due to fears of casualties; in addition, no pilots were qualified to fly with night vision goggles, preventing nighttime operations. 78–80.
U.S. Apaches served in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan from 2001. 33–35. The Apache was the only platform capable of providing accurate CAS duties for Operation Anaconda; although they regularly took fire during the intense early fighting, they were kept operational by their ground crews. 16–17. U.S. AH-64Ds typically flew in Afghanistan and Iraq without the Longbow Radar in the absence of armored threats. In 2006, Thomas Adams noted that Apaches tended to fight in small teams but had little autonomy to react to threats and opportunities, requiring lengthy dialogue with command structures in an effort to centrally micromanage each unit. 223–224.
In 2003, the AH-64 participated in the invasion of Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. 35–37. On 24 March 2003, 31 Apaches were damaged, and one shot down and captured, in an unsuccessful attack on an Iraqi Republican Guard armored brigade  near Karbala.
By the end of U.S. military operations in Iraq in December 2011, several Apache helicopters had been shot down by enemy fire, and others lost in accidents. In 2006, an Apache was downed by a Soviet-made Strela 2 (SA-7) in Iraq, despite the Apache being typically able to avoid such missiles. FlaniganAmputee Combat Vet Daniel McConnell's Inspiring Story Most Apaches that have taken heavy damage have been able to continue their missions and return safely.
As of 2011, the U.S. Army Apache fleet had accumulated more than 3 million flight hours since the first prototype flew in 1975. On 27 November 2013, the Apache Guardian achieved initial operating capability (IOC).com, 27 November 2013
A DOD audit released in May 2011, found that Boeing had significantly overcharged the U.S. Army on multiple occasions, ranging from 33.3 percent to 177,475 percent for routine spare parts in helicopters like the Apache.
In FY 2015 budgets, the Army considered moving all Apaches from the Army Reserve and National Guard to the active Army to serve as scout helicopters to replace the OH-58 Kiowa. Using the AH-64 in the scouting role is considered less expensive than Kiowa upgrades or purchasing a new scouting type. AH-64E Apaches can control unmanned aerial vehicles like the MQ-1C Grey Eagle to perform aerial scouting missions; a 2010 study found that manned-unmanned teaming of Apaches and UAVs was the most cost-effective alternative to a new scout helicopter and would meet 80% of reconnaissance requirements, compared to 20% with existing OH-58s and 50% with upgraded OH-58s. Reserve and Guard units criticized the proposal, who would lose their attack helicopters.com, 23 January 2014

Israel

The Israeli Air Force (IAF) first received AH-64As in 1990,Donald 2004, p. 157. for a total fleet of 42., also as "Seraph", Hebrew for venomous/fiery winged serpent).
During the 1990s, Israeli AH-64As frequently attacked Hezbollah outposts in Lebanon.
There have also been accidents involving the Apache helicopter in Israeli service. During the Lebanon War in 2006, two IAF AH-64A helicopters collided, killing one pilot and critically wounding three.
In June 2010, Israel decided against upgrading all of its AH-64A fleet to the -D configuration, due to budget restrictions. In 2013, Israeli AH-64As had been receiving a comprehensive upgrade of their avionics and electrical systems." ''Flight International', 8 October 2013.

United Kingdom

The UK operates a modified version of the Apache Longbow initially called the Westland WAH-64 Apache, and is designated Apache AH1 by the British Army. Westland built 67 WAH-64 Apaches under license from Boeing, and the addition of a folding blade assembly for use on naval ships.

The Netherlands

The Dutch government initially showed an interest in acquiring Apache helicopters in the late 1980s, where it stated that it may purchase as many as 52.
The RNLAF Apaches' first deployment was in 2001 to Djibouti, Africa.
Shortly after Apaches were deployed to Kabul airport as part of the Netherlands contribution to ISAF, on 10 April 2004 a pair of Dutch Apaches came under light gunfire close to the Afghan capital.

In November 2009, the Royal Saudi Air Force, as part of a military effort against insurgent intrusions of the kingdom's border, started using the Apache in Operation Scorched Earth; this involved launched air strikes against Houthi rebels operating inside neighboring Yemen as well.

Egypt

In 1995, the Egyptian Air Force placed an order for 36 AH-64A helicopters. These Apaches were delivered with most of the advanced avionics used on the U.S. fleet at that time, with the exception of localized radio equipment. 42. In 2000, Boeing announced that an order to remanufacture Egypt's existing Apache fleet to the AH-64D configuration."Egypt to Upgrade 35 Apaches to AH-64D Configuration."
In August 2012, the Egyptian Armed Forces undertook a large-scale military operation to regain control of the Sinai Peninsula from armed militants. Air cover throughout the operation was provided by the Egyptian Air Force's Apache helicopters; reportedly the Apaches destroyed three vehicles and killed at least 20 militants."Egypt launches airstrikes in Sinai after troop massacre."

Variants

AH-64A

The AH-64A is the original production attack helicopter. The crew sit in tandem in an armored compartment. It is powered by two GE T700 turboshaft engines. The A-model was equipped with the −701 engine version until 1990 when the engines were switched to the more powerful −701C version. 12.
U.S. Army AH-64As are being converted to AH-64Ds. The service's last AH-64A was taken out of service in July 2012 before conversion at Boeing's facility in Mesa, Arizona. On 25 September 2012, Boeing received a $136.8M contract to remanufacture the last 16 AH-64As into the AH-64D Block II version, to be completed by December 2013. Defenseindustrydaily.com

AH-64B

In 1991 after Operation Desert Storm, the AH-64B was a proposed upgrade to 254 AH-64As. The upgrade would have included new rotor blades, a Global Positioning System (GPS), improved navigation systems and new radios. Congress approved $82M to begin the Apache B upgrade. The B program was canceled in 1992. 10. The radio, navigation, and GPS modifications, were later installed on most A-model Apaches through other upgrades.

AH-64C

Additional funding from Congress in late 1991 resulted in a program to upgrade AH-64As to an AH-64B+ version. More funding changed the plan to upgrade to AH-64C. The C upgrade would include all changes to be included in the Longbow except for mast-mounted radar and newer −700C engine versions. However, the C designation was dropped after 1993. 153. With AH-64As receiving the newer engine from 1990, the only difference between the C model and the radar-equipped D model was the radar, which could be moved from one aircraft to another; thus the decision was made to simply designate both versions AH-64D.

AH-64D

The AH-64D Apache Longbow, is equipped with a glass cockpit and advanced sensors, the most noticeable of which being the AN/APG-78 Longbow millimeter-wave fire-control radar (FCR) target acquisition system and the Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), housed in a dome located above the main rotor.
The aircraft is powered by a pair of uprated T700-GE-701C engines. The forward fuselage was expanded to accommodate new systems to improve survivability, navigation, and 'tactical internet' communications capabilities. In February 2003, the first Block II Apache was delivered to the U.S. Army, featuring digital communications upgrades. The Japanese Apache AH-64DJP variant is based on the AH-64D; it can be equipped with the AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles for self-defense.

AH-64E

Formerly known as AH-64D Block III, in late 2012, it was redesignated as AH-64E Guardian to represent the helicopter's increased capabilities. "AOL Defense", 22 October 2012. "Team Apache announces nickname for the Apache Echo Model." army."Army Renames Apache Block III Helicopters." The AH-64E features improved digital connectivity, the joint tactical radio system, more powerful T700-GE-701D engines with upgraded transmission to accommodate more power, capability to control Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs), new composite rotor blades, full IFR capability, and improved landing gear.. Boeing Press Release, 2 November 2011."Technology gives Apache block III more lift, capability, landing ability". U.S. Army The rotor blades, which successfully completed testing in 2004, increase cruise speed, climb rate, and payload capacity."Boeing-Developed Composite Rotor Blade Spins Forward"  Changes in production lots 4 through 6 shall include a cognitive decision aiding system, new self-diagnostic abilities, Link-16 data-links, and radar improvements. The updated Longbow radar has an oversea capacity, potentially enabling naval strikes; an AESA radar is under consideration. "US Army fields first AH-64E unit, but more improvements to come." Flight International, 9 January 2013.

Sea Apache

During the 1980s Naval versions of the AH-64A for the United States Marine Corps and Navy were examined. 60–61. 150. Multiple concepts were studied with altered landing gear arrangements, improved avionics and weapons. Funding for a naval version was not provided, the Marine Corps continued to use the AH-1. 170. The Canadian Forces Maritime Command also examined a naval Apache.

Export Apaches

Several models have been derived from both AH-64A and AH-64D for export. The British-built AgustaWestland Apache (assembled from kits purchased from Boeing) is based on the AH-64D Block I with several different systems, including more powerful engines, folding rotor blades, and other modifications for operation from Royal Navy vessels.

Block modification

While a major change in design or role will cause the type designator suffix to change, for example from AH-64D to AH-64E the helicopters are also subject to Block modification. Block modification is the combining of equipment changes into blocks of modification work orders, the modifications in the block (sometimes called a block package) are all done to the helicopter at the same time.Army Regulation 750-10 Army Modification Program
