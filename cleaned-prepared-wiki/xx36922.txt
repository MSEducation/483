[[Coast guard]]

CATEGORIES: Coast guards

A coast guard or coastguard is a maritime security organization of a particular country. The term implies widely different responsibilities in different countries, from being a heavily armed military force with customs and security duties to being a volunteer organization tasked with search and rescue functions and lacking any law enforcement powers. However, a typical coast guard's functions are distinct from typical functions of both the navy (a pure military force) and a transportation police (a civilian law enforcement agency).

History

The modern Her Majesty's Coastguard of the United Kingdom was established in 1809 as the Waterguard, and was originally devoted to the prevention of smuggling as a department of the HM Customs and Excise authority. It was, however, also responsible for giving assistance to shipwrecks.
Each Water Guard station was issued with Manby's Mortar which was invented by Captain George William Manby in 1808. The mortar fired a shot with a line attached from the shore to the wrecked ship and was used for many years up and down the coastline. This began the process in which the Coastguard and they help assumed a life saving role. In 1821 a committee of inquiry recommended that responsibility for the Preventative Water Guard be transferred to the Board of Customs. The Treasury agreed and in a Minute dated 15 January 1822, directed that the preventative services, which consisted of the Preventative Water Guard, cruisers, and Riding Officers should be placed under the authority of the Board of Customs and in future should be named the Coast Guard. In 1845 the Coastguard was subordinated to the Admiralty.
In 1829 the first Coast Guard instructions were published and dealt with discipline and directions for carrying out preventative duties. They also stipulated that when a wreck took place, the Coast Guard was responsible for taking all possible action to save lives, to take charge of the vessel and to protect property.nationalarchives.uk/index.php?title=Coastguard_History National Archives - Coastguard History (1992 Memorandum)
In the United States the Life-Saving Service was formed in 1848.  Unmanned life saving stations were established by the USLSS along the New Jersey coast south of New York Harbor with "surf boats, rockets, carronades and other necessary apparatus for the better preservation of life and property from ship- wrecks...." The USLSS merged with the United States Revenue Cutter Service to form the United States Coast Guard in 1915.

Role

Among the responsibilities that may be entrusted to a coast guard service are:
During wartime, some national Coast Guard organizations might have responsibilities in harbor defenses, port security, naval counter-intelligence and coastal patrols.
The Coast Guard may, varying by jurisdiction, be part of the country's military, a law enforcement agency, or a search and rescue body. For example, the United States Coast Guard is a military branch with a law enforcement capacity, whereas the United Kingdom's Her Majesty's Coastguard is a civilian organisation whose only role is search and rescue. Most coast guards operate ships and aircraft including helicopters and seaplanes that are either owned or leased by the agency in order to fulfill their respective roles.
Some coast guards, such as the Irish Coast Guard, have only a very limited law enforcement role, usually in enforcing maritime safety law, such as by inspecting ships docked in their jurisdiction.  In cases where the Coast Guard is primarily concerned with coordinating rather than executing rescue operations, lifeboats are often provided by civilian voluntary organizations, such as the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in the United Kingdom, whilst aircraft may be provided by the countries' armed forces, such as Sea Kings operated by the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy in addition to any of the U.K.'s Her Majesty's Coastguard's own assets.

Type and role by country

The following lists a select number of Coast Guards around the world, illustrating the varied roles they play in the respective governments and the countries they operate in:

 Argentina

The Argentine Naval Prefecture, in Spanish Prefectura Naval Argentina or PNA, is a service of the Argentine Republic's Interior Ministry charged with protecting the country's rivers and maritime territory. It therefore fulfills the functions of other countries' coast guards, and furthermore acts as a gendarmerie force policing navigable rivers.

 Australia

While having 19,650 kilometres of coastline, the Commonwealth of Australia does not have a force purely to defend its coast. The duty of patrolling its coastline falls to the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Customs (through its Border Protection Command division), and the Police services of the several states and territories.
In addition, there are several private volunteer coast guard organizations, the two largest organizations being the Royal Volunteer Coastal Patrol (established in 1937) and the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard (established in 1961). These volunteer organizations have no law enforcement powers, and are essentially auxiliary Search and Rescue services. In NSW these two organisations have joined to become Marine Rescue in 2009.

 Bangladesh

The Bangladesh Coast Guard's officers are transferred from the Bangladesh Navy. While under the remit of the Ministry of Home Affairs, the coast guard is part of the country's military.

 Bosnia and Herzegovina

Having 18 kilometres of coastline only, Bosnia Herzegovina does not have a force dedicated to defend its coast. The duty of patrolling its coastline falls to the Granična policija (Border Police).

 Brazil

In addition to the roles of a traditional navy, the Brazilian Navy also carries out the role of organizing the merchant navy and other operational safety missions traditionally conducted by a coast guard. Other roles include: Conducting national maritime policy, and implementing and enforcing laws and regulations with respect to the sea and inland waters.

 Canada

The Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) is a civilian service under the Department of Fisheries and Oceans responsible for patrolling the world's longest coastline of 243,042 km (~151,000 mi).
The CCG holds responsibility for all marine search and rescue throughout Canada. The CCG coordinates search and rescue operations with the Canadian Armed Forces, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and other organizations. The CCG maintains and operates seamarks, coastal light stations, vessel traffic services, marine pollution response services, marine communications systems, and provides icebreaking services.  The CCG also operates all Federal scientific research and hydrographic survey vessels.  To accomplish these tasks, the CCG has a sizable fleet of vessels and aircraft, all serviced from various bases and smaller stations located on three coasts (Atlantic, Arctic, Pacific) and the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River.
The Canadian Coast Guard College is located near Sydney, Nova Scotia.

 China

The Peoples Republic of China used to operate several coast guard agencies. In March 2013, China announced it would combine the assets of four separate maritime law enforcement agencies to form a unified Coast Guard, administrated by the State Oceanic Administration- Articles - Nation merging maritime patrol forces The new Coast Guard has been in operation since July 2013.defensenews.com/article/20130723/DEFREG03/307230021/China-Unveils-Coast-Guard-Handle-Sea-Conflict
The current China Coast Guard (Simplified Chinese: 中国海警) serves as a coordinating body for maritime search and rescue in the territorial waters of the People's Republic of China. The China Coast Guard was previously a maritime branch of the Public Security Border Troops, a paramilitary police force under the leadership of the Ministry of Public Security (MPS). Since 2013, it is administered by the State Oceanic Administration.
The former China Maritime Safety Administration (Chinese: 中国海事局) was a government agency which coordinated maritime search and rescue in the territorial waters of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The CMSA was part of the Ministry of Transport.
The former China Marine Surveillance (CMS), created on 19 October 1998, was a paramilitary maritime law enforcement agency of the State Oceanic Administration of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The force was responsible for enforcing laws and order within China's territorial waters, exclusive economic zones (EEZ), and shores; protecting the maritime environment, natural resources, navigation aids and other facilities; and carrying out maritime surveys. In emergencies, these forces could also be deployed for other missions such as search and rescue.
The former China Fisheries Law Enforcement Command (FLEC)(Chinese: 中国渔政), an organ of the Fisheries Management Bureau under the PRC Ministry of Agriculture, was responsible for the enforcement of laws concerning fishing and maritime resources within PRC's territorial waters and exclusive economic zones (EEZ). FLEC's responsibilities included protecting Chinese fishing vessels and personnel, resolving disputes in fishing activities, preventing illegal fishing, and protecting maritime resources.

 Cyprus

The Cyprus Port and Marine Police (Greek Λιμενική και Ναυτική Αστυνομία - Limeniki kai Nautiki Astinomia) fulfills the functions of other countries' coast guards for the Republic of Cyprus. Cyprus is an island country in the Eastern Mediterranean with almost 40% of its territory under occupation after a Turkish military Invasion. Due to the country's geopolitical situation, size, the recent discovery in 2011 of the Aphrodite gas field in its Exclusive Economic Zone and Cyprus Police being the main national Law enforcement agency, the duties and responsibilities of the Cyprus Port and Marine Police are many and sometimes complex. It is a unit of the Cyprus Police, which resides under the Ministry of Justice and Public Order (Cyprus). However it can support the Cyprus Navy in wartime which resides under the Ministry of Defence. It is staffed by Police Officers which can be transferred to and from other units and agencies of the Cyprus Police and are tasked with the primary mission of policing the country's sea borders and the law enforcement of the waters around it. The unit is equipped with patrol boats and radars but it does not operate its own helicopters. Instead, it operates in combination with the aerial unit of the Cyprus Police, the Cyprus Police Aviation Unit. Main roles include law enforcement against illicit activities such as smuggling (due to the fact that although the Customs and Excise Department is a separate agency under the Ministry of Finance, it does not have an operational or tactical team of its own), terrorism, piracy, illegal fishing, Illegal drug trade, illegal immigration and is also assigned with Search and Rescue (SAR) duties. For counter-terrorism and anti-piracy operations, the units operate in combination with the Special Anti-Terrorist Squad which is part of the Emergency Response Unit of the Cyprus Police. Although the prominent agencies responsible for all Search and Rescue operations are conducted by Cyprus Police Units, the agency responsible to organize the SAR system, to co-ordinate, to control and direct SAR operations in the region that the Republic of Cyprus is responsible for (which coincides with the Nicosia FIR) is the Cyprus Joint Rescue Coordination Center or JRCC Larnaca, which is an independent agency of the Ministry of Defence.

 France

In the French Republic, Affaires maritimes is the closest organization to Coast Guards. In each region, a Naval Admiral, called Préfet Maritime, is in charge of coordination of all state services for action at sea (Navy, Affaires maritimes, gendarmerie, customs, fishery survey ...). The charity, Société Nationale de Sauvetage en Mer, provides most life saving duties at the local level.

HM Coastguard does not possess many of its own lifeboats but does have several MCA Falcons which are a type of lifeboat that are used in areas that might not necessarily have a lifeboat provided by the volunteer Royal National Lifeboat Institution or other Independent Units, although it often wet leases commercial helicopters—mainly Sikorsky S-92s and AgustaWestland AW139s—and tugs to provide search and rescue cover in certain areas.  It does, however, maintain a number of search, cliff and mud rescue teams as well as some inshore rescue boats and is a coordinating body and public face for the maritime search and rescue services. It is part of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, which in itself is an executive agency of the department for transport. Cooperation is made with the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force and the all volunteer National Coastwatch Institution, which mans many of the vacated former Coastguard Watch-houses along the coast.

 Ukraine

Ukrainian Sea Guard is the coast guard service of Ukraine, subordinated to its Border Guard Service, the local successor of the Soviet Border Troops Naval Units that have been similarly responsible for coast guard tasks. However, there were some interchanges in units, ships and personnel between Sea Guard and the Ukrainian Navy. Operates four sea guard detachment; a sea guard cutters division in Mariupol; a special-purpose sea guard cutters division in Yalta; and a riverine Dnieper sea guard cutters division in Kiev. Sea guard administration is split between the Azov-Black seas regional administration in Simferopol and the Southern regional administration in Odessa.

 United States

Established in 1790 in Newburyport, Massachusetts, Coast Guard (USCG) is both a military and a law enforcement service. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and one of the five services of the United States Armed Forces. Its role includes enforcement of U.S. maritime law, coastal defense, and search and rescue.
During peacetime the USCG falls under the administration of the United States Department of Homeland Security (before 2002, the USCG was under the administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation). During wartime, the USCG may, at the direction of the President of the United States, report to the Secretary of the Navy; its resources, however, are integrated into U.S. military operations in wartime (see ).
The USCG maintains an extensive fleet of coastal and ocean-going patrol ships, called cutters by tradition, and small craft, as well as an extensive aviation division consisting of HH-65 Dolphin and HH-60 Jayhawk helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft such as the C-130 Hercules, HU-25 Guardian, and HC-144 Ocean Sentry. USCG helicopters are equipped with hoists to rescue survivors and also play a major role in law enforcement.  The helicopters are able to land and take off from USCG cutters, making them an indispensable tool in fighting illegal drug traffic and the influx of illegal immigrants.  The fixed-wing aircraft are used for long range search and rescue and law enforcement patrols. A construction and repair shipyard has been maintained since 1899 in the Baltimore Harbor area at Curtis Bay, United States Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland
Today's lighthouses on the American coasts are all run by the U.S. Coast Guard, from the previous old U.S. Lighthouse Service.
