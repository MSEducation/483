Born the son of Jerome Wade in Killavally, Westmeath in Ireland, Wade was commissioned into the Earl of Bath's Regiment on 26 December 1690Heathcote, p. 285 and served in Flanders in 1692, fighting at the Battle of Steenkerque in August 1692 during the Nine Years' War and earning a promotion to lieutenant on 10 February 1693. He transferred to Sir Bevil Granville's Regiment on 19 April 1694 and was promoted to captain on 13 June 1695.
During the War of the Spanish Succession he first served under Marlborough, seeing action in Flanders at the Battle of Kaiserwerth in April 1702, the Battle of Venlo in September 1702, the Battle of Roermond in October 1702 and Battle of Liège also in October 1702, gaining promotion to major on 20 March 1703 and to lieutenant colonel in October 1703. In 1704 he joined the staff of Henri de Massue, Earl of Galway as adjutant-general in Portugal, and distinguished himself as colonel of the Huntingdon's Regiment during the Battle of Alcántara during which he was wounded in April 1706. He repelled a large force of cavalry at Vila Nova and then commanded the 3rd infantry brigade during the Battle of Almansa in April 1707. He won promotion to brigadier general on 1 January  1708.
He served as second-in-command to James Stanhope in Minorca in 1708, leading one of the storming parties on Fort St. Philip, before returning to Spain in 1710, where he fought at the Battle of Saragossa in August 1710. He earned a promotion to major-general on 3 October 1714Heathcote, p. 286 and became commander of the British forces in Ireland in November 1714.

He became Member of Parliament for Bath in 1722

Scotland

The government of George I sent Wade to inspect Scotland in 1724. He recommended the construction of barracks, bridges and proper roads to assist in the control of the region and on 10 May 1725 received appointment as Commander in Chief of His Majesty's forces, castles, forts and barracks in North Britain, tasked with carrying out his own recommendations. A reference in verse is said to be inscribed on a stone at the start of one of his military roads in Scotland:
 
 If you had seen this road before it was made.

You would lift up your hands and bless General Wade.

Wade also organised a militia named "Highland Watches", calling on members of the landed gentry to sign up
On 1 June 1732 he became Governor of Berwick upon Tweed
He raised four more "highland watch" companies in 1739: these were subsequently reorganized as the Black Watch regiment. He still had the time to sign his support to the Foundling Hospital which was established in 1739 in London.10 On 22 June 1742 he was appointed Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance

War of the Austrian Succession

On 17 December 1743 he became a field marshal with his appointment to the joint command of the Anglo-Austrian force in Flanders against the French in the War of the Austrian Succession. Wade organised an advance towards Lille in July 1744 but the action became stalled in the face of logistical problems. He resigned from his command in March 1745, returning home to become Commander-in-Chief of the Forces.

Jacobite rising

In October 1745 during the Jacobite rising Wade focussed his troops on Newcastle upon Tyne on the East coast of England; however the Jacobite forces advanced from Scotland down the West coast of England via Carlisle into Lancashire and the speed of their advance left Wade scrambling. In freezing conditions and with his men starving, he failed to counter their march into England or their subsequent retreat back from Derby to Scotland; Wade was replaced as Commander-in-Chief by Prince William, Duke of Cumberland who led the army to success at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746.41-42
Wade received mention in a verse used as part of God Save the King circa 1745:
 
 Lord, grant that Marshal Wade

May, by thy mighty aid,

Victory bring.

May he sedition hush

And, like a torrent, rush

Rebellious Scots to crush.

God save the King.

Wade died, unmarried, on 14 March 1748 and is buried at Westminster Abbey where his life is recognised by a monument created by Louis-François Roubiliac.4
