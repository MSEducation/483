Political career

In March 2002 he was elected leader of the then opposition PNP thus succeeding Washington Misick. In the April 2003 general elections, Misick's party won 6 out of the possible 13 seats in the legislature. The successful petitioning and winning of by-elections held in two constituencies resulted in Misick being sworn in as Chief Minister of the Turks and Caicos Islands on 16 August 2003.
