History

The Makers of Memories Foundation was established in 2007 by marketing and media entrepreneur Brian F. Martin.  Martin was raised in a family with chronic, serious abuse and created the Foundation to help families and children overcome the trauma of domestic violence they experienced and to pursue more positive possibilities in their lives.  In 2007 and 2008 the Foundation hosted journeys for families which combined a restorative experience along with educational and therapeutic services.  Financial author David Bach
