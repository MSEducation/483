In the United States of America majority-minority or minority-majority area is a United States state or jurisdiction whose population is composed of less than 50% non-Hispanic whites.  Racial data is derived from self-identification questions on the U.S. Census and on U.S. Census Bureau estimates. (See Race in the United States Census).

States

From colonial times to the early 20th century, much of the Lower South had a black majority. Three Southern states had populations that were majority black. They were Louisiana (until about 1890 had black populations approaching or exceeding 40%.
These states changed markedly from the 1890s through the 1950s, as two waves of the Great Migration led more than 6.5 million blacks to abandon the economically depressed, legally segregated Deep South in search of better job opportunities and living conditions, first in Northern and Midwestern industrial cities, and later west to California. One-fifth of Florida's black population had left the state by 1940, for instance. Rogers, et al., Documented History of the Incident Which Occurred at Rosewood, Florida in January 1923, December 1993, p.5  
The District of Columbia, one of the magnets for Great Migration blacks, was long the sole majority-minority federal jurisdiction in the continental U.S. The black proportion has declined since the 1990s due to gentrification and expanding opportunities, with many blacks moving to suburban Maryland and others migrating to jobs in states of the New South in a reverse of the Great Migration. Frey,  "The New Great Migration: Black Americans' Return to the South, 1965-2000", The Brookings Institution, May 2004, pp.1-5  accessed 19 Mar 2008
Since 1965, foreign immigration has spurred the proliferation of majority-minority areas, most notably in California, whose legal resident population was 89.5% 'non-Hispanic white' in the 1940s, but which was estimated at 39.4% 'non-Hispanic white' in 2012.

Cities

Many cities in the United States became majority-minority by 2010.

Data collection

The first data for New Mexico was a 5% sample in 1940 which estimated non-Hispanic whites at 50.9%.  Hispanics do not constitute a race but an ethnic and cultural group: Of respondents who listed Hispanic origin, some listed White race, roughly half gave responses tabulated under "Some other race" (e.g. giving a national origin such as "Mexican" or a designation such as "Mestizo" as race), and much smaller numbers listed Black, Native American, or Asian race. 
In recent U.S. censuses, self-identification has been the primary way to identify race.  Presumption of race based on countries or regions given in the ancestry question is used only when a respondent has answered the ancestry question but not the race question.  The U.S. Census currently defines "white people" very broadly as "people having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa,The White Population: 2000, Census 2000 Brief C2KBR/01-4, U.S. Census Bureau, August 2001. i.e. Caucasoids. This definition has changed through the years.
Although the Census attempts to enumerate both citizens and non-citizens, the illegal immigrant population of the United States has proven hard to quantify; the census uses a 12 million base estimate nationally. However, current estimates based on national surveys, administrative data and other sources of information indicate that the current population may range as high as 20 to 30 million.

Other uses

Normally, state is considered to be majority-minority because of its ethnic/racial makeup, but other criteria is occasionally used, such as religion, disability, or age. For example, the majority of Utah residents are Mormons, a Christian denomination that is a religious minority throughout the rest of the United States. Utah and Rhode Island, which has a Roman Catholic majority, are the only states in the U.S. where a single denomination constitutes a majority of the population. However, no U.S. state has a majority composed of any non-Christian group, except for Hawaii, where 51.1% of the population follow religions that would be non-mainstream in the rest of the United States. Hawaii is classified as religious majority of Unaffiliated, including agnostics, atheists, humanists, the Irreligious, and Secularists (non-practicing).

International applications

While the concept exists in other nations, the exact term differs from place to place and language to language.
In many large, contiguous countries like China, there are many autonomous regions where a minority population is the majority.  These regions are generally the result of historical population distributions, not because of recent immigration or recent differences in birth and fertility rates between various groups.

Brazil

Brazil has officially become a majority "non-white" country as of the 2010 census, together with the federative units of Goiás, Federal District, Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo.
By now, Mato Grosso do Sul (about 51% in 2010) must already be minority-majority, while Rio de Janeiro (about 54% in 2010) and São Paulo (about 60% in 2010) are probably the next ones.
Those identifying as white declined to 47.7 percent (about 91 million people) in 2010 census from 52.9 percent (about 93 million people) in 2000 in the entire country. However, in Brazil, this is not simply a matter of origin and birthrate, but identity changes as well. The black minority, whose women have more children in average than the pardo minority, did not enlarge its representation in the population to more than 1.5% in the period, while it was mostly the growth in the number of pardo people (~38% in 2000, 42.4% in 2010) that caused the demographic plurality of Brazil.
However, a process similar to that of the United States is indeed happening in Brazil, for a longer amount of time but at a much slower pace. See White Brazilian#By state.
