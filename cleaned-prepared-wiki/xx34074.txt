Route 24 is a state highway in New Jersey, United States, that extends  from a junction with Interstate 287 in Hanover Township in Morris County, passing southeast through Essex County, and ends at a junction with Interstate 78 in Springfield Township in Union County. The route is a four- to six-lane freeway its entire length.
The route was created in 1927 to run from Phillipsburg to Newark, replacing pre-1927 Route 12 from Phillipsburg to Penwell and Pre-1927 Route 5 from Morristown to Newark. The route was extended west to the new Eastonâ€“Phillipsburg Toll Bridge in 1938 but was cut back to U.S. Route 22 in the eastern part of Phillipsburg in 1953. The western terminus was cut back further around 1970 to Hackettstown with the route west of there becoming part of Route 57. The freeway alignment of Route 24 between the John F. Kennedy Parkway and Interstate 78 was completed in 1972.
With the completion of this freeway, Route 24 east of the John F. Kennedy Parkway became Route 124. The freeway was completed between the abandoned Tri-Borough Road interchange and the JFK Parkway in the 1970s but was not opened until 1992, when the rest of the freeway to Interstate 287 was completed after years of legal, environmental and budgetary problems. At this time, the alignment of Route 24 between U.S. Route 202 in Morristown and the JFK Parkway became a western extension of Route 124 while the route was officially eliminated between Hackettstown and Morristown as it followed county-maintained routes. The former route between Hackettstown and Morristown is still referred to as Route 24 by many and is still signed as such due to local outcry.

Essex and Union Counties

Route 24 crosses into Millburn Township, Essex County, widens to six lanes, and passes over the Passaic River. In Millburn Township, the route interchanges with Route 124, County Route 649 (John F. Kennedy Parkway), and River Road. This interchange provides access to The Mall at Short Hills. Past this interchange, Route 124 becomes a frontage road for the Route 24 freeway and the freeway forms the border between the city of Summit in Union County and Millburn Township and interchanges with County Route 657 (Summit Avenue). Route 24 continues along the Summit-Millburn border until it fully enters Millburn and intersects County Route 608 (Hobart Avenue) with a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. Past this interchange, the Route 124 frontage road ends, with Route 124 following the freeway closely to the north as a two-way road, and Route 24 crosses into Summit. The freeway interchanges with County Route 512 (Broad Street) with a westbound exit and entrance and eastbound exit and County Route 527 (Morris Avenue) with an eastbound exit and entrance, entering Springfield Township. Route 24 continues southeast toward its terminus at an interchange with Interstate 78.

History

thumb|right|100px|Route S24 (1927-1953)Route 24 was created in 1927 to run from downtown Phillipsburg at the Northampton Street Bridge over the Delaware River east to Route 25 (now U.S. Route 1/9) in Newark, replacing Pre-1927 Route 12 from Phillipsburg to Penwell and Pre-1927 Route 5 from Morristown to Newark, along with a new proposed alignment between Penwell and Morristown.
thumb|right|100px|Route 24N (planned in 1938)Plans for the Route 24 freeway go back to 1950 when a bypass of the many congested towns along the route was planned; this bypass was designated as a freeway in 1952. In 1959 the freeway was planned on its current alignment, running from Interstate 287 near Morristown to Interstate 78 in Springfield Township, with approval in 1960. In 1962, plans were made to extend the Route 24 freeway west to U.S. Route 22 in Phillipsburg.
Construction on the section of the Route 24 freeway between the John F. Kennedy Parkway on the Essex/Morris County border and Interstate 78 began in 1967 and was finished in 1972. With the completion of this section, the former alignment of Route 24 between the John F. Kennedy Parkway and the boundary between Maplewood and Irvington, including frontage roads built alongside a portion of the freeway in the Short Hills area, was designated as Route 124. The section across Chatham Borough from the John F. Kennedy Parkway to shortly past the still-existing unused cloverleaf interchange at the Florham Park borough line, once signed as the Tri-Borough Road, a never-built southern extension of the Eisenhower Parkway, was cleared and graded in the early 1970s but it was not opened as it did not provide any connections to existing roads.
Following the completion of the freeway, the former signed route of Route 24 between the junction with U.S. Route 202 in Morristown and the John F. Kennedy Parkway became a western extension of Route 124. show Route 24 along the route between Hackettstown and Morristown.
