CAD as of 2010 was the leading cause of death globally resulting in over 7 million deaths. This is up from 5.2 million deaths in 1990. It may affect individuals at any age but becomes dramatically more common at progressively older ages, with approximately a tripling with each decade of life. Males are affected more often than females.
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death for both men and women and accounts for approximately 600,000 deaths in the United States every year. It is the most common reason for death of men and women over 20 years of age in the United States. AHA, Dallas, Texas, 2007 The Maasai of Africa have almost no heart disease.

Research

Recent research efforts focus on new angiogenic treatment modalities (angiogenesis) and various (adult) stem cell therapies.
A region on Chromosome 17 was confined to families with multiple cases of myocardial infarction.
A more controversial link is that between Chlamydophila pneumoniae infection and atherosclerosis.
Since the 1990s the search for new treatment options for coronary artery disease patients, particularly for so called "no-option" coronary patients, focused on usage of angiogenesis[ref]Wagoner, L.E., Merrill, W., Jacobs, J., Conway, G., Boehmer, J., Thomas, K.,

Myeloperoxidase has been proposed as a biomarker.
