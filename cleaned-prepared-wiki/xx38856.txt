History

TAM – Táxi Aéreo Marília

TAM – Táxi Aéreo Marília and TAM – Transportes Aéreos Regionais were two different entities, although both belonged to the TAM Group. TAM – Marília, an air taxi company founded in 1961, provided the start-up infrastructure for TAM – Regionais.

TAM – Transportes Aéreos Regionais (KK)

On November 11, 1975, the Government of Brazil created the Brazilian Integrated System of Regional Air Transportation and divided the country in five different regions, for which five newly created regional airlines received a concession to operate air services. Founded by Rolim Adolfo Amaro
TAM – Linhas Aéreas Regionais was formed as a joint-venture between TAM – Táxi Aéreo Marília and VASP, the latter of which was then a state-owned airline. The airline received the IATA code KKHome Page on October 13, 1999. The new airline flew Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirantes at first, but these proved grossly inadequate for the task at hand, and even at full capacity needed to be subsidized by the government in order to be profitable.
TAM went on to purchase three used Fokker F27 turboprops, which were subsequently refurbished by Fokker in the Netherlands. In order to obtain the import authorization for the aircraft, a deal was struck with the government in which TAM was forced to maintain 3 Bandeirantes for every F27, as well as removing 5 seats from each one, bringing the F27's capacity down to 40 passengers. A fourth F27, previously owned by Air New Zealand, was added to the TAM fleet in 1981. By 1983, TAM had acquired 10 F27s. By 1981, TAM had flown one million passengers, and two million by 1984.

TAM (KK) joint operations with TAM (JJ)

In August 1986, the company, under financial stress, went public and began floating stock in the market. The same year, TAM – Transportes Aéreos Regionais (KK) acquired another regional airline, VOTEC, which operated in areas of northern and central Brazil. VOTEC was then renamed Brasil Central Linhas Aéreas. TAM and Brasil Central were both regional airlines and operated in different designated areas. They however operated as a consortium with integrated networks and fleet, with the most notable differences being the flight number IATA codes (whereas TAM had the IATA code KK, Brasil Central operated with the code JJ inherited from VOTEC), the different color schemes of the aircraft, and their designated areas of operation. In 1988, TAM flew its 3 millionth passenger.
On May 15, 1990, the Brazilian Government lifted restrictions on operational areas of regional airlines allowing them to fly anywhere in Brazil. As a consequence, Brasil Central was renamed TAM – Transportes Aéreos Meridionais, acquired the same color scheme of TAM (KK) but maintained the IATA code JJ.
In 2000 TAM (KK) was merged into TAM (JJ) and TAM (JJ) was renamed TAM Transportes Aéreos. The code JJ was maintained and the code KK was released back to IATA. It is now used by Atlasjet.
Despite TAM's success in the market, it was evident the airline would not last long when competing against airlines such as Varig and VASP, both of which already possessed Boeing 737s in their fleet. Amaro then tried to buy VASP, which was about to be privatized, and called the project "Revolution". Having lost the bid, he opted for slower growth with a gradual addition of new aircraft, re-dubbed "Evolution".
On September 15, 1989, TAM arranged for the acquisition of two Fokker 100 jets, which had originally been ordered by the now-bankrupt Pan American World Airways. Like the F27s before them, TAM did not actually purchase these aircraft, but used Amaro's credibility to arrange for a third-party asset management company, Guinness Peat Aviation to purchase them and subsequently lease them back to TAM. Two more were added in 1991. In 1992, TAM carried its eight millionth passenger. By 1993, through the use of the Fokker 100 fleet, which now numbered at 14, TAM was serving 56 cities in Brazil.
In 1996 TAM bought another airline, Helisul Linhas Aéreas, which used the trade name of TAM. In 1997, TAM ordered its first large jets; the airline ordered 45 planes from Airbus, including 10 A330s, 4 A319s, and 34 A320s. In 1997, the Airbuses began to be delivered and the airline flew its first international service, from São Paulo to Miami International Airport.
Two years later, in 1999, services to Europe were inaugurated through a code share service with Air France, to Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. In 2000, the airline was renamed TAM Linhas Aéreas in Portuguese. Long running discussions to merge with Varig ended in 2004. In 2008, TAM transported 30,144,000 passengers, with an average load factor of 71%. 25 As of 2010, the airline is owned by the Amaro family (46.25%), Amaro Aviation Part (3.52%), treasury stocks (0.27%) and minority shareholders (49.96%). It employs 24,000 staff. On May 13, 2010, TAM became the 27th member of Star Alliance.
In 2009 TAM decided to replace its Passenger Service System provided by Sabre, known as Sabresonic, with the Altéa platform from Amadeus.Amadeus processes record number of airline passengers through its Altea platform (press release) | ABTN
On March 30, 2011, TAM signed a letter of intentions to purchase up to 31% of the shares of TRIP Linhas Aéreas, a regional airline which code-shares with TAM since 2004.
On 23 January 2013, the Jet Airliner Crash Data Evaluation Centre (JACDEC) announced that TAM Airlines had the second worst safety record in the world. The ratings take into account the number and deadliness of the hull losses (destroyed airplanes) they have suffered in the past 30 years, how they have fared more recently, and how many flights they have flown without incident. The results do not take into account the cause of the hull losses, or whether the airline is at fault, so they are not a perfect measure of how safely an airline behaves.

Agreement with LAN to create LATAM Airlines Group

On August 13, 2010, TAM signed a non-binding agreement with Chilean airline LAN Airlines to merge and create LATAM Airlines Group.
The merger was completed on June 22, 2012.

Subsidiaries

In 1994 TAM Airlines established a small subsidiary airline in Paraguay called ARPA - Aerolíneas Paraguayas with a fleet consisting mostly of Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft, formerly operated by TAM. On September 1, 1996, TAM via ARPA, purchased 80% of the shares of the former state-owned LAP – Líneas Aéreas Paraguayas and merged it with ARPA. The new airline was named TAM – Transportes Aéreos del Mercosur and maintained the IATA code of LAP, PZ. Today TAM owns 94.98% and the Paraguayan government 5.02% of the shares.
In 2008, following a branding strategy, the name TAM Mercosur was dropped and the airline adopted an identical corporate identity of TAM Airlines. However, its corporate structure remains the same. This airline is today informally known as TAM Paraguay, and uses the IATA code PZ.
On December 21, 2009, TAM Airlines purchased Pantanal Linhas Aéreas. TAM, however, decided to maintain Pantanal as a different airline within the TAM Group and integrated into its network of TAM. Presently Pantanal operates flights on behalf of TAM, all with origin and destination at São-Paulo-Congonhas Airport. The previous IATA code of Pantanal P8 was at the same time changed to GP. Pantanal was incorporated TAM Linhas Aereas (in August 2013) 

Destinations

The network of TAM Group (composed of TAM Airlines, and TAM Paraguay) covers Brazil, Paraguay, Europe, North and South America.
Furthermore, TAM Airlines maintains code-share agreements for international destinations with Star Alliance partners, Aeroméxico, and LAN Airlines, and in relation to German domestic destinations TAM has an agreement with Deutsche Bahn.
TAM's international codeshare network include connections from Frankfurt to destinations across Germany, France, Austria and Denmark with Lufthansa, connections from Miami and New York to Chicago and then other destinations within USA with United Airlines, flights from São Paulo to Canada, Portugal and domestic connections with Air Canada and TAP Portugal and also connecting flights to Tokyo and Beijing (from London and Madrid respectively) with All Nippon Airways and Air China. TAM also signed a codeshare agreement with Oneworld partner American Airlines with connections between Brazil and select U.S. cities such as Boston, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Las Vegas, and Seattle.

Fleet

On June 16, 2005, TAM announced the purchase of 20 additional Airbus A320 family aircraft (including the models A319, A320 and A321), plus an additional 20 options. These are expected to be delivered between late 2007 and 2010, adding to the already scheduled delivery of 6 A320s between 2006 and 2008. At the same time, the company signed a memorandum of understanding with Airbus stating its intent to buy 10 of the new Airbus A350-900 (plus 5 options), with deliveries due to commence at the end of 2014. These are expected to replace the A330 on the Paris and Miami routes as they become available.
TAM has signed a firm contract with Airbus to acquire 37 additional aircraft. The order comprises twelve A319s, 16 A320s, three A321s and three A330s and includes twelve unspecified extra options. This would bring the number of aircraft in TAM's fleet acquired directly from Airbus to 115 aircraft. The deliveries are to be concluded by 2010.
In 2013, TAM announced the phase out of the 3 Boeing 767 it operates, but it later changed plans and decided to keep the aircraft and bring 6 more newer aircraft from LAN Airlines. They will replace older A330-200. TAM will also receive the first aircraft of the A320 family with Sharklets in April 2013.
Fleet maintenance is partially conducted at the technology center at São Carlos Airport."Centro Tecnológico de São Carlos," TAM Airlines
