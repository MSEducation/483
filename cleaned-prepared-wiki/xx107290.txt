Akilam points out its basis as a regeneration of Dharma in the form of an entirely new ideology.) But today, most of the followers of Ayyavazhi address Vaikundar merely as the incarnation of Vishnu. Likewise, most of the Nizhal Thangals were called Narayana Swami Pathi or Narayana Swami Temple, similar to Hindu Vaishnavism. Most of the followers also worship Hindu deities such as Kali, Hanuman and other folk deities in spite of the anti-polytheistic ideas based on Ayyavazhi scripture. 2–4.
Some followers of Ayyavazhi include Vaikundar as part of the ten Avatars of Vishnu as Kalki, while some denominations strongly advocate moksha, the personal liberation, though it is not stated directly in Akilam. Some even reject the Trinity conception in Ayyavazhi and believe Narayana to be the supreme universal power. 1, "Sreehari who is known as Athi Narayana is praised as Ayya." The unique monotheistic belief which is the central theme of Akilam is completely unknown among most of the followers today. Deviating far away from the strict monotheistic teachings of Akilam, some thangals provides panividais for other lesser gods too.
The spread of Ayyavazhi among the common people was mainly due to the practice of Shamanism. Being similar to Hindus in almost all aspects Ayyavazhi followers are hard to be identified. The only sign to distinguish the practitioners of Ayyavazhi is the fact that they wore the Thirunamam (a sign on their forehead).R. Shunmugam, Nadar Kulathi Narayanar Avataram, pp. 189–191 The Nizhal Thangals are identified among the other temples by the fact that idols are replaced by mirrors in the Palliyarai. Only the recitations of a handful of scholars educated in the Ayyavazhi scriptures point out the real facts and concepts of Akilam and the philosophical and ideological deviation of Ayyavazhi from Hinduism. 3, " ... but it is questionable that how many people know that. Every one who came to know newly about Ayya wonders and ..." Bala Prajapathi Adikalar writes about Vaikundar. Not even the Payyans from the headquarters able to portray the Akilam-based ideology clearly.S. No.80/1110,  "The doctrines and the philosophic basis of this cult are not clearly known. Not even the 2nd defendant who is one of the hereditary high priests in the temple (Swamithope Pathi) and who enjoys the Gurusthanam of the community is able to throw much light on the question, whether there are any essential or fundamental differences between the Narayanaswamy margom (Ayyavazhi) and the Popular Hinduism" All these philosophical, ideological and religious variations in the society of Ayyavazhi make them hard to be identified and differentiated as a separate belief and instead taken as a Hindu sect.

Social structure

Ayyavazhi worship was marked by its simplicity. The absence of idol worship and priestly mediation, and inclusion of alternate type of centres of worship, the Pathis and Nizhal Thangals, were other characteristics of Ayyavazhi worship. Rituals of Ayyavazhi are a reform or revolutionary activity, focusing upon social equality, deviating from Hinduism. The rituals are also characterised and bound by religious beliefs that give them an alternative spiritual meaning.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency, "Rituals", p. 98. Its scriptures cover basic elements and ideas throughout Hinduism. They refer to Shastras, Agamas, Vedas and Puranas. Palaramachandran Nadar), p. 180. But address them all to be gone awry by the Advent of Vaikundar, from where Ayyavazhi scriptures forms negative ideas over all other traditions. Though Ayyavazhi shares many god-heads with Hinduism, it weaves unique ideology and power assumption for them. Ayyavazhi can be portrayed as a Hindu renaissance.T. Krishnanathan, Ayya Vaikundarin Vazhvum Sinthanaiyum, pp.62–63. Ayyavazhi is viewed as a reform movement too,R. Ponnu, Vaikunda Swamikal Ore Avataram, pp.163–178. as it brought many social changes there in the Tamil and keralite society during the 19th century.
The religious structure evolved in the path of Ayyavazhi scriptures and, as a result, it transfigured itself as an alternative religio-cultural system in the social category. The Ayyavazhis addressed their system as "Path of God" with the phrase "Ayya Vazhi". On one hand, they believe that their tradition had come to replace all old traditions (religions), but on the other hand, they believe that Ayyavazhi is the synopsis of the world's religious knowledge. On one hand, they believe that Vaikundar unified all deities within him; on the other, as all the previous had gone awry by the advent of Vaikundar.G. Patrick, Religion and Subaltern Agency,  "Ayya Vali – A New and Singular Religious Phenomenon" , p. 120. Apart from this, Ayyavazhi has separate theology, mythology, holy places, worship centres, and ethics of its own. thumb|right| 'The Great Masi Procession'  from Nagercoil to Swamithope
Though many new papers, academic researchers and some of its followers consider it as a separate religion, many of the followers are even of the opinion that this is but a Hindu sect rather than an autonomous religion. Also, many of its core beliefs are similar to some Hindu sects such as Advaita and Smartism.
Regarding demographics, Ayyavazhi followers are highly concentrated in South India though found across India, comparatively in less numbers. In Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli districts of Tamil Nadu, it is very hard to find a village without a worship centre of Ayyavazhi. Apart from the listings from the religious headquarters (though it is evident that Ayyavazhi followers are spread across the India from university papers)R. Ponnu, Sri Vaikunda Swamigal and the Struggle for Social Equality in South India, p. 100. there are no official figures for the number of followers of Ayyavazhi because they are considered Hindus in the census.
