[[Epping, New South Wales]]

CATEGORIES: Suburbs of Sydney

Epping is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 18 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government areas of the City of Parramatta and Hornsby Shire. It is in the Northern Suburbs.

History

The Wallumedegal Aboriginal tribe lived in the area between the Lane Cove River and Parramatta River. In 1792, Governor Phillip began the granting of parcels of lands to marines, and the area was referred to on Phillip's maps as the Field of Mars, Mars being the Roman god of War. It contained the area of what is now Epping, along with the surrounding suburbs of Ryde and Marsfield.
Epping railway station was opened on 17 September 1886, originally named "Field of Mars", and quickly renamed to "Carlingford" on 5 April 1887.  The Post Office was opened on 16 October 1889, originally named "East Carlingford".
In 1899 the suburb name of Epping was adopted following the suggestion by a local landowner William Midson (1849–1924), after a town near Epping Forest in Essex, where his father was born.
The Seven Network had television production studios in Epping until 2009. The site is now occupied by residential apartments.
