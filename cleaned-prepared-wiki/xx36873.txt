Social work is a professional and academic discipline that seeks to improve the quality of life and subjective well-being of individuals, groups, and communities through research, policy, community organizing, direct practice, crisis intervention, and teaching for the benefit of those affected by social disadvantages such as poverty, mental and physical illness or disability, and social injustice, including violations of their civil liberties and human rights. 
A person who practices social work is called a social worker. In the UK, the title Social Worker is protected by law and only those who have undergone approved training at university either through a Bachelor or Masters degree in Social Work and are registered with the appropriate regulatory body (the Health and Care Professions Council in England, the Scottish Social Services Council, the Care Council for Wales, or the Northern Ireland Social Care Council) may practice social work and be called a social worker. Social workers typically undergo a systematic set of training and qualifications that are distinct from those of social care workers, care assistants or social care workers, who may undertake a social work role but not necessarily have the qualifications or professional skills of a qualified social worker. Currently, there is no formal qualifications or training to practice as a social care assistant, care worker, social care assistant or carer, but mostly ancillary staff are accountable to a qualified member of staff, such as a social worker.  
Research and the practice of social worker focused on areas such as: human development, sociolegal, psychosocial, psychotherapy, counselling, social policy, public administration, social program evaluation, and community development. Social workers are organized into local, national, continental, and international professional bodies. It is an interdisciplinary field that incorporates theoretical bases from economics, education, sociology, law, medicine, philosophy, politics, anthropology, and psychology.

History

The concept of charity goes back to ancient times, and the practice of providing for the poor has roots in many ancient civilizations and world religions. Even before the rise of modern European states, the church was providing social services. The earliest organized social welfare activity of the Christian church was the formation of burial societies, followed closely by provision of alms to the poor, shelter for the homeless, and care and comfort for the sick. Monasteries often served as comprehensive social service agencies, acting as hospitals, homes for the aged, orphanages,  travelers' aid stations. It was not until the emergence of industrialization and urbanization that the informal helping systems of the church and family began to break down and organized social welfare services emerged to supplant it.
The profession of social work is generally considered to have developed from three movements: the Charity Organization Society (COS) movement, the settlement house movement, and a third, less clearly defined movement, the development of institutions to deal with the entire range of social problems. All had their most rapid growth during the nineteenth century, and all grew out of the church. and Leighninger, Leslie. Socail Work, Social Welfare, American Society.Print
Social work has its roots in the social and economic upheaval wrought by the Industrial Revolution, in particular the societal struggle to deal with poverty and its resultant problems. Because poverty was the main focus of early social work, it was intricately linked with the idea of charity work, 
Whereas social casework started on a more scientific footing aimed at directing and reforming individuals (at one stage supporting the notion that poverty was a disease), other models of social work arising out of the Settlement House movement, led by activists such as Jane Addams, emphasized political activism and community solutions.  Currently, social work is known for its critical and holistic approach to understanding and intervening in social problems. This has led, for example, to the recognition of poverty as having a social and economic basis rooted in social policies rather than representing a personal moral defect. This trend also points to another historical development in the evolution of social work: once a profession engages  in social control, it is directed at social and personal empowerment. This is not to say that modern social workers do not engage in social control (consider, for example, child protection workers), and many, if not most, social workers likely would agree that there is an ongoing tension between these forces within the profession. For example, see the debate between structural social work and humanistic social work. (2011). Humanistic Social Work: Core Principles in Practice. Chicago: Lyceum, Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan.

Practice

Social work is an interdisciplinary, meaning it draws from a number of areas.  As an example, some areas of practice include (but not limited to: psychology, sociology, criminology, economics, ecology, education, health, law, philosophy, anthropology and counselling or colloquially known as psychotherapy.  It is not a 'single model', such as that of health; followed by medical professional such as nurses and doctors, thus, social work requires study and continued professional development to retain knowledge and skills in practice.  As an example, here are some of the social work models (or theories) used within practice: 

Contemporary professional development

The International Federation of Social Workers says of social work today that  
 "social work bases its methodology on a systematic body of evidence-based knowledge derived from research and practice evaluation, including local and indigenous knowledge specific to its context. It recognizes the complexity of interactions between human beings and their environment, and the capacity of people both to be affected by and to alter the multiple influences upon them including bio-psychosocial factors. The social work profession draws on theories of human development, social theory and social systems to analyze complex situations and to facilitate individual, organizational, social and cultural changes."
It seven core functions are described by Popple and Leighninger as:
Popple & Leighninger, 2011
Six other core values are:

Qualifications

The education of social workers begins with a Bachelor's degree (BA, BSc, BSSW, BSW, etc.) or diploma in Social Work. Some countries offer Postgraduate degrees in Social Work, such as a master's degree (MSW, MSS, MA, MSc, MRes, MPhil.) or doctoral studies (PhD and DSW (Doctor of Social Work)). Increasingly, graduates of social work programs pursue post-masters and post-doctoral study, including training in psychotherapy.
In the United States, social work undergraduate and master's programs are accredited by the Council on Social Work Education.  A CSWE-accredited degree is required for one to become a state-licensed social worker.
A number of countries and jurisdictions requires registration or licensure of people working as social workers, and there are mandated qualifications. NASW Fact Sheet. Retrieved November 15, 2006 from  In other places, a professional association sets academic requirements for admission to the profession. The success of these professional bodies' efforts is demonstrated in that these same requirements are recognized by employers as necessary for employment.

Professional associations

Social workers have a number of professional associations, which provide ethical guidance and other forms of support for their members and for social work in general. These associations may be international, continental, semi-continental, national, or regional. The main international associations are the International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) and the International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW).
The largest professional social work association in the United States is the National Association of Social Workers. There also exist organizations that represent clinical social workers such as The American Association of Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work,  AAPCSW is a national organization representing social workers who practice psychoanalytic social work and psychonalysis.  There are also a number of states with Clinical Social Work Societies which represent all social workers who conduct psychotherapy from a variety of theoretical frameworks with families, groups and individuals.

Trade unions representing social workers

In the United Kingdom, just over half of social workers are employed by local authorities,  and many of these are represented by UNISON, the public sector employee union. Smaller numbers are members of Unite the union and the GMB (trade union). The British Union of Social Work Employees (BUSWE) has been a section of the Community (trade union) since 2008. In 2011, the British Association of Social Workers launched a trade union arm for the second time (it first tried this in 1976) called the Social Workers' Union, but this body is not recognized by the TUC or by any employers.

Role of the professional

The main tasks of professional social workers may include a number of services such as case management (linking clients with agencies and programs that will meet their psychosocial needs -  common in the US and the UK), counseling and psychotherapy, human services management, social welfare policy analysis, policy and practice development, community organizing, international, social and community development, advocacy, teaching (in schools of social work), and social and political research.
A historic and defining feature of social work is the profession's focus on individual well-being in a social context and the well-being of society.   Social workers promote social justice and social change with and on behalf of clients.   The term "client" is used to refer to individuals, families, groups, organizations, or communities.
According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), professional social workers are the nation's largest group of mental health services providers.   There are more clinically trained social workers—over 200,000—than psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses combined.   Federal law and the National Institutes of Health recognize social work as one of five core mental health professions.SocialWorkProfession.socialworkers.org
