Auyán-tepui (
Auyán-tepui gives its name to the Auyán Massif, which also includes the tiny peaks of Cerro El Sol and Cerro La Luna to the north, and the satellite mountain of Uaipán-tepui to the south. The massif has a total summit area of roughly  Mejorando Nuestra Herencia. Auyán-tepui means "Devil's House" in the local Pemón language.
Angel Falls, the tallest  waterfall in the world, drops from a cleft near the summit. The falls are  Brewer-Carías, C. (2010). Tras la huella: del Salto Angel. Río Verde 2: 61–77. — a drop nineteen times higher than that of Niagara Falls.
Auyán-tepui achieved international fame in 1933 when Angel Falls was accidentally discovered by Jimmie Angel, a bush pilot searching for gold ore. Attempting to land on the heart-shaped mesa in 1937, Angel crashed his small Flamingo plane on top of Auyán-tepui and was forced to hike down the gradually sloping backside, a trip that took him and his crew 11 days to complete; he was immortalised when the waterfall was named after him.
