Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira ( born June 2, 1976), better known as Minotauro or Minotauro Nogueira, is a Brazilian mixed martial artist known for his technical mastery of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. He competes in the heavyweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, where he is a former Interim UFC Heavyweight Champion. He is the twin brother of Antônio Rogério Nogueira. He rose to prominence in the Japanese promotion Pride Fighting Championships, where he was the first Pride Heavyweight Champion from November 2001 to March 2003, as well as a 2004 PRIDE FC Heavyweight Grand Prix Finalist. He is one of only three men to have held championship titles in both Pride Fighting Championships and the Ultimate Fighting Championship (the others being Mauricio Rua and Mark Coleman). As of March 10, 2014, he is #11 in official UFC heavyweight rankings.UFC Fighter Rankings

Early life

Born in the town of Vitória da Conquista, Brazil, He started training in judo at the age of 4, boxing at 14 and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu when he was 18. At age 10, he was accidentally run over by a truck and fell into a four day coma, losing a rib and part of his liver and hospitalized for eleven months. As a result of the accident he has a large scar, including a noticeable indentation, on his lower back.
A few years after his MMA debut he started training at the Brazilian Top Team. In June 2007 he officially left, prior to his UFC debut, and joined Black House.

MMA career

Pride FC

Nogueira's victories in Pride include wins over Dan Henderson (who gave Nogueira his first loss by split decision, however Nogueira would later avenge the loss in PRIDE when he submitted Henderson with an arm-bar in their re-match), the UFC Hall of Famer Mark Coleman, Heath Herring, former UFC heavyweight champions Ricco Rodriguez and Josh Barnett, the legendary Mirko "Cro Cop" Filipović, and Bob Sapp.
Following the end of Akira Maeda's Rings federation, Nogueira was signed by Pride. He debuted in July 2001 at Pride 15, quickly submitting Gary Goodridge by triangle choke. In Pride 16, he submitted UFC and Pride Grand Prix champion Mark Coleman by triangle armbar. 
He was crowned as the inaugural Pride World Heavyweight Champion after defeating Heath Herring by decision.
He next defeated Enson Inoue, and then fought for Antonio Inoki's UFO organization, scoring his first MMA KO victory against Sanae Kikuta
He then represented Pride at a co-promotion with K-1, Pride Shockwave, against the super heavyweight and former American football player Bob Sapp. He eventually won the fight.
Dutch kickboxer Semmy Schilt was his next opponent. He scored another victory by triangle choke.
Nogueira's first Pride title defense was against Russian Sambo champion Fedor Emelianenko at Pride 25 where he suffered his second career loss, a judges' decision after Emelianenko dominated the fight with characteristic ground-and-pound through the guard.
Afterwards, he won a decision against former UFC heavyweight champion Ricco Rodriguez. Despite Rodriguez managed to score takedowns and maintain top position, Pride's fight-scoring is determined primarily by "effort to finish the fight by KO or submission", and Nogueira's multiple near-submission attempts won him the decision victory.
In November 2003, with heavyweight champion Emelianenko unable to fight due to injuries, Pride elected to crown an interim champion, so top contenders Nogueira and Mirko Filipović were matched up. Filipović managed to dominate the first round with his superior striking and a left high kick which knocked Nogueira down in the very end of the round, but in the second round, Nogueira managed to secure a takedown and roll into an armbar to submit Filipović.
On April 25, 2004 at Pride Total Elimination 2004, the first round of the 2004 Heavyweight Grand Prix, he faced the unbeaten professional wrestler and former judoka Hirotaka Yokoi, who he submitted with the debut of his anaconda choke. He then repeated the move against Heath Herring in the next round to advance to the semi finals where he defeated Sergei Kharitonov to again face Fedor Emelianenko in the finals. The fight was markedly different from their first, with Nogueira able to avoid the damage he suffered from ground-and-pound in their first meeting, but was stopped when Emelianenko suffered a cut after an accidental headbut and could not continue, resulting in a no contest. Another rematch was required to determine the tournament champion, and was scheduled for Pride Shockwave 2004 on 31 December 2004. Nogueira suffered another unanimous decision loss to Emelianenko.
At Pride Critical Countdown 2005 he defeated Polish Olympic judoka Pawel Nastula by strikes and following this, at Pride 31 he beat professional wrestler and fighter Kiyoshi Tamura by armbar for the second time.
He then entered the 2006 Pride Open Weight Grand Prix, progressing to the semi final by defeating fellow Brazilians Zuluzinho and Fabricio Werdum. In the semi final, he faced the American catch wrestler Josh Barnett and lost to a split decision, as both had landed damaging blows and submission attempts without managing to secure a victory. Barnett went on to face Mirko Filipović in the finals, submitting to punches and kicks to the face.
Nogueira avenged the loss to Barnett with a unanimous decision win in their rematch at Pride Shockwave 2006.

Ultimate Fighting Championship

At UFC Fight Night 9 which took place on April 5 , 2007 Nogueira was in attendance and was sitting cage side with UFC president Dana White. It was subsequently announced at UFC 69, by White, that Nogueira had joined the UFC, promoted initially as simply "Minotauro" Nogueira, much like the UFC's promotion of Mirko Filipović as Mirko "Cro Cop" and Quinton Jackson as "Rampage" Jackson.
His debut in the Octagon was a third fight with Heath Herring at UFC 73, promoted under various combinations of his name and nickname, but was officially introduced to the audience under his full name and nickname. Nogueira once again defeated Herring, via unanimous decision. During the first round Herring landed a head kick that sent Nogueira to the canvas, in which unofficial judge Eddie Bravo thought the fight could have been stopped. Herring let Nogueira get back to his feet, and Nogueira was then able to recover and come back with a dominant decision victory.
It was announced during the UFC 79 broadcast and subsequent press conference that Nogueira would be fighting former long time UFC Heavyweight Champion Tim Sylvia at UFC 81 for the Interim UFC Heavyweight Championship. Nogueira defeated Sylvia in the third round with a guillotine choke to become the Interim UFC Heavyweight Champion. During the fight Sylvia knocked Nogueira down with punches. After pulling Sylvia into his half guard in the third round, Nogueira quickly secured a sweep and attempted an armbar which he missed but immediately transitioned into a guillotine choke as Sylvia tried to regain his feet thus mounting a come from behind victory. Nogueira's coach, Amaury Bitetti, said that Nogueira had trained for the guillotine well beforehand."Amaury comenta vitória de Minotauro ." Tatame. 11 02 2008: n. page. Web. 13 Jan. 2013. .
Nogueira and former UFC Heavyweight Champion Frank Mir were the coaches for the eighth season of The Ultimate Fighter, which premiered on September 17, 2008 on Spike TV.
Both winners of The Ultimate Fighter Season 8, light heavyweight Ryan Bader and lightweight Efrain Escudero, were members of Team Nogueira.
After the season concluded, coaches Nogueira and Mir met at UFC 92 for the Interim UFC Heavyweight Championship.
Two days after the fight Dana White revealed in an interview that "Nogueira had just gotten over a Staph infection".
The UFC next wanted to schedule Nogueira to face UFC Hall of Famer and Former UFC Heavyweight and Light Heavyweight Champion Randy Couture at UFC 97, but Couture had to turn down the fight due to elbow surgery in January 2009. Couture later agreed to fight Nogueira at UFC 102 in Portland, Oregon. 411mania. Retrieved on 2012-02-05.
Nogueira defeated Couture via unanimous decision. Nogueira showed much improved sharpness on his feet, and displayed his excellent chin by walking through many of Couture's strikes while still throwing punches, eventually gaining the better of the exchanges as he scored two knockdowns of Couture in the fight. Although taken down twice, Nogueira swept from guard on both occasions (after some time on his back) to gain the full mount over Couture. On the floor, Nogueira threatened with two submissions, first with a D'Arce choke and later with an arm triangle.
Nogueira was expected to face undefeated prospect Cain Velasquez on January 2, 2010 at UFC 108, but again Nogueira caught another severe staph infection cancelling the bout.  The bout instead took place on February 21, 2010 at UFC 110 in Sydney, Australia. During the bout Minotauro was out-boxed as Cain landed an uppercut-right hook combo that dropped Antonio early in the first round. Velasquez followed up with five clean shots on the ground, prompting referee Herb Dean to stop the contest, in which Velasquez earned a KO victory. Velasquez. Sherdog. February 20, 2010. Retrieved on 2012-02-05. At the time, Nogueira had been knocked out in two of his last three fights.
Nogueira was to face Frank Mir on September 25, 2010 at UFC 119 in a rematch from the Championship bout at UFC 92.
On August 23, 2011, Minotauro established a partnership with Brazilian football team Internacional to represent the club's brand in UFC. In an interview for SporTV, Minotauro said: "I'll do my best to represent Internacional in the best possible way. Now I am 100% Internacional."
Nogueira defeated The Ultimate Fighter alumnus Brendan Schaub by knockout due to punches in the first round on August 27, 2011 at UFC 134 in his home-city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was his first fight in over 16 months (and was billed as his "return fight") and earned him his first Knockout of the Night bonus.  Nogueira celebrated his victory by sitting on top of the octagon fence and displaying a Brazilian national flag with Sport Club Internacional's emblem added to the center of the flag.
Nogueira faced Frank Mir in a rematch on December 10, 2011 at UFC 140.  After close early exchanges and a lot of work against the cage the two separated and Nogueira rocked Mir with a hard overhand right, jab combo. After Mir fell to the ground Nogueira continued with ground and pound before attempting a guillotine choke. Mir was able to get out of this and during the scramble ended in side control, and locked up a kimura. Nogueira managed to roll Mir, only to be reversed himself. Mir stepped his right leg over the face of Nogueira and cranked the kimura, causing Nogueira's right humerus to break, thus ending the fight at 3:38 of round 1.
Nogueira was expected to face Cheick Kongo on July 21, 2012 at UFC 149.
Nogueira fought Dave Herman on October 13, 2012 at UFC 153. He won the bout when he submitted Herman in the second round with an armbar. The finish earned him his first "Submission of the Night" honors.
Nogueira coached opposite Fabricio Werdum on the second season of The Ultimate Fighter: Brazil.  The two met in a rematch at the conclusion of the season, on June 8, 2013 at UFC on Fuel TV 10.  This was a rematch of their first fight in PRIDE in which Nogueria won by unanimous decision back in 2006.  After a back-and-forth first round, Nogueira lost via submission to an armbar in the second round.
Nogueira faced Roy Nelson on April 11, 2014 in the main event at UFC Fight Night 39.
