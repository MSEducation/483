Susan Adele Greenfield, Baroness Greenfield, CBE, HonFRCP (born 1 October 1950) is a British scientist, writer, broadcaster, and member of the House of Lords. Her research is to identify a novel approach to the treatment of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. She is also interested in the neuroscience of consciousness.Private Life of the Brain (2000)
Greenfield is Senior Research Fellow at Lincoln College, Oxford University. From 2005 to 2012, she was Chancellor of Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. From 1998 to 8 January 2010, she was director of the Royal Institution of Great Britain.

Education

Susan Adele Greenfield was born to a Jewish father 
She attended the Godolphin and Latymer School, and was the first member of her family to go on to university. As a Seniour Scholar St Hugh's College, Oxford.

Career

Greenfield's research is focused on brain physiology, particularly on the brain mechanisms of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, but she is also known as a populariser of science. Greenfield has written a range of books about the brain, regularly gives public lectures, and appears on radio and television."What Goes On In The Brain" Dialogue Talk; accessed 20 March 2014.
Since 1976, Greenfield has published some 200 papers in peer-reviewed journals, including studies on the basic brain mechanisms involved in addiction and reward,Cragg, S.J., Hille, C.J. & Greenfield, S.A.

In 1994, she was invited to be the first woman to give the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture, then sponsored by the BBC. Her lecture was titled "Journey to the centre of the brain". 
From 1995-99, she gave public lectures as Gresham Professor of Physic. Greenfield was Adelaide's Thinker in Residence for 2004 and 2005.
Greenfield created three research and biotechnology companies: Synaptica, BrainBoost, and Neurodiagnostics, which research neuronal diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. She is a Patron of Dignity in Dying and a founder and trustee of the charity Science for Humanity, a network of scientists, researchers and technologists that collaborates with non-profits to create practical solutions to the everyday problems of developing communities. 
She has explored the relevance of neuroscience knowledge to education
In 2013 Greenfield published a dystopian science-fiction novel 2121: A Tale from the Next Century, telling the story of videogame-playing hedonists and their conflict with "Neo-Puritans".oxfordtimes.co.Susan_Greenfield__Tale_of_a_terrible_reckoning/

Political affiliation

Baroness Greenfield sits in the Parliament of the United Kingdom in the House of Lords as a crossbencher, having no formal political affiliation. Her latest speech was on the revision of drugs policy on 17 October 2013.publications.uk/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/lhan54.pdf

Internet addiction disorder

In press interviews, at public speaking events, as well as in her writing,and Me: The Neuroscience of Identity Greenfield has expressed concerns that modern technology, and in particular social networking sites and video games, may have a negative impact on child development, leading to conditions including dementia and autism. 
In 2011, Greenfield was criticised for explicitly linking the increase in internet usage to a rise in autism, with the National Autistic Society describing her statements as "unhelpful speculation". Greenfield responded by saying "I point to the increase in autism and I point to internet use. That's all."
In 2010, Greenfield explored the relevance of neuroscience knowledge to education,Dommett, E.J., Devonshire, I.M., Plateau, C.R., Westwell, M.S. & Greenfield, S.A. From Scientific Theory to Classroom Practice. The Neuroscientist: doi:10.1177/1073858409356111 (2010)  and in 2011 she published You & Me: the Neuroscience of Identity, introducing the concept of "mind change", an umbrella term comparable to climate change, encompassing the diverse issues involved on the impact of the 21st century environment on the brain,You & Me: the Neuroscience of Identity; Notting Hill editions (2011) and inspired by various sources.

Honours

As well as having 30 honorary degrees,
In January 2000, Greenfield received the CBE 
In 2003, she was appointed a Chevalier Légion d'Honneur by the French Government.
In 2006 she was made an Honorary Fellow of the British Science Association and was the Honorary Australian of the Year.
In 2010 she was awarded the Australian Society for Medical Research Medal.

Patronage
