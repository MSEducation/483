[[Glottal stop]]

CATEGORIES: Glottal consonants, Plosives

The glottal stop is a type of consonantal sound used in many spoken languages, produced by obstructing airflow in the vocal tract or, more precisely, the glottis. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is .
In English, the glottal stop is represented, for example, by the hyphen in uh-oh!.  For most English speakers, a glottal stop is used as an allophone of  between a vowel and a syllabic "n", as in button or mountain, except when talking slowly.

Phonology and symbolization of the glottal stop in selected languages

Although this segment is not a written between vowels as in city. Standard English inserts a glottal stop before a tautosyllabic voiceless stop, e.g. sto'p, tha't, kno'ck, wa'tch, also lea'p, soa'k, hel'p, pin'ch. In the Scottish English , glottal stops are commonly used in words in place of the letter 't,' such as buʔer, Saʔurday, or even 'gloʔle' itself. 1977:27. Listening to spoken English. London: Longman.
In many languages that don't allow a sequence of vowels, such as Persian, the glottal stop may be used to break up such a hiatus. There are intricate interactions between falling tone and the glottal stop in the histories of such languages as Danish (cf. stød), Chinese and Thai.
In the traditional Romanization of many languages, such as Arabic, the glottal stop is transcribed with an apostrophe, .200px|thumb|right|Road sign in British Columbia showing the use of 7 instead of ʔ in the Squamish language.
Other scripts also have letters used for representing the glottal stop, such as the Hebrew letter aleph .
In the graphic representation of most Philippine languages, the glottal stop has no consistent symbolization. In most cases, however, a word that begins with a vowel-letter (e.g. Tagalog aso, "dog") is always pronounced with an unrepresented glottal stop before that vowel (as also in Modern German and Hausa). Some orthographies employ a hyphen, instead of the reverse apostrophe, if the glottal stop occurs in the middle of the word (e.g. Tagalog pag-ibig, "love"; or Visayan gabi-i, "night"). When it occurs in the end of a Tagalog word, the last vowel is written with a circumflex accent (known as the pakupyâ), if both a stress and a glottal stop occurs at the final vowel (e.g. basâ, "wet"); or a grave accent (known as the paiwà), if the glottal stop occurs at the final vowel, but the stress occurs at the penultimate syllable (e.g. batà, "child").
Some Canadian indigenous languages have adopted the phonetic symbol "ʔ" itself as part of their orthographies. In some of them, it occurs as a pair of uppercase and lowercase characters, . Sometimes the number symbol 7 is used if the ʔ character is not available to the typesetter, and in some cases such as in the Squamish language, the 7 has become the preferred symbol.
Use of the glottal stop is a distinct characteristic of the Southern Mainland Argyll dialects of Scottish Gaelic. In a such a dialect, the standard Gaelic phrase Tha Gàidhlig agam (I have Gaelic), would be rendered ''Tha Gàidhlig a'am'.
