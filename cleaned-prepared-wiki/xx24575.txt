[[Kinetic theory]]

CATEGORIES: Gases, Thermodynamics, Concepts in physics

The kinetic theory of gases describes a gas as a large number of small particles (atoms or molecules), all of which are in constant, random motion. The rapidly moving particles constantly collide with each other and with the walls of the container. Kinetic theory explains macroscopic properties of gases, such as pressure, temperature, viscosity, thermal conductivity, and volume, by considering their molecular composition and motion. The theory posits that gas pressure is due to the impacts, on the walls of a container, of molecules or atoms moving at different velocities.
Kinetic theory defines temperature in its own way, not identical with the thermodynamic definition.
While the particles making up a gas are too small to be visible, the jittering motion of pollen grains or dust particles which can be seen under a microscope, known as Brownian motion, results directly from collisions between the particles and gas molecules.   As pointed out by Albert Einstein in 1905,  this experimental evidence for kinetic theory is generally seen as having confirmed the existence of atoms and molecules.

Assumptions

The theory for ideal gases makes the following assumptions:
More modern developments relax these assumptions and are based on the Boltzmann equation. These can accurately describe the properties of dense gases, because they include the volume of the molecules. The necessary assumptions are the absence of quantum effects, molecular chaos and small gradients in bulk properties. Expansions to higher orders in the density are known as virial expansions. An important book on kinetic theory is that by Chapman and Cowling., Cowling, T.G. (1939/1970). An important approach to the subject is called Chapman–Enskog theory. (1966). Kinetic Theory of Gases, W.A. Benjamin, New York, pp. 232–235. There have been many modern developments and there is an alternative approach developed by Grad based on moment expansions.Grad 1949
In the other limit, for extremely rarefied gases, the gradients in bulk properties are not small compared to the mean free paths. This is known as the Knudsen regime and expansions can be performed in the Knudsen number.

Properties

Pressure and kinetic energy

Pressure is explained by kinetic theory as arising from the force exerted by molecules or atoms impacting on the walls of a container. Consider a gas of N molecules, each of mass m, enclosed in a cuboidal container of volume V=L3. When a gas molecule collides with the wall of the container perpendicular to the x coordinate axis and bounces off in the opposite direction with the same speed (an elastic collision), then the momentum lost by the particle and gained by the wall is:
where vx is the x-component of the initial velocity of the particle.
The particle impacts one specific side wall once every
(where L is the distance between opposite walls).
The force due to this particle is:
The total force on the wall is
where the bar denotes an average over the N particles.
Since the assumption is that the particles move in random directions, we will have to conclude that if we divide the velocity vectors of all particles in three mutually perpendicular directions, the average value along each direction must be equal. (This does not mean that each particle always travel in 45 degrees to the coordinate axes.)
We can rewrite the force as
This force is exerted on an area L2. Therefore the pressure of the gas is
where V=L3 is the volume of the box.
The ratio n=N/V is the number density of the gas (the mass density ρ=nm is less convenient for theoretical derivations on atomic level). Using n, we can rewrite the pressure as

Temperature and kinetic energy

From the ideal gas law
absolute temperature defined by the ideal gas law,
which leads to the expression of the kinetic energy of a molecule
The temperature becomes
Eq.()
is one important result of the kinetic
theory:
The average molecular kinetic energy is proportional to the ideal gas law's absolute temperature.
From Eq.() and
Eq.(),
we have
Thus, the product of pressure and
volume per mole is proportional to the average
(translational) molecular kinetic energy.
Eq.()
are called the "classical results",
which could also be derived from statistical mechanics;
for more details, see
.
Since there are
degrees of freedom in a monatomic-gas system with
particles,
the kinetic energy per degree of freedom per molecule is
|}}
In the kinetic energy per degree of freedom,
the constant of proportionality of temperature
is 1/2 times
Boltzmann constant. In addition to this, the temperature will decrease when the pressure drops to a certain point.
This result is related
to the equipartition theorem.
As noted in the article on heat capacity, diatomic
gases should have 7 degrees of freedom, but the lighter gases act
as if they have only 5.
Thus the kinetic energy per kelvin (monatomic ideal gas) is:
At standard temperature (273.15 K), we get:

Collisions with container

One can calculate the number of atomic or molecular collisions with a wall of a container per unit area per unit time.
Assuming an ideal gas, a derivationCollisions With a Surface results in an equation for total number of collisions per unit time per area:
This quantity is also known as the "impingement rate" in vacuum physics.

Speed of molecules

From the kinetic energy formula it can be shown that
with v in m/s, T in kelvins, and m is the molecule mass (kg). The most probable speed is 81.6% of the rms speed, and the mean speeds 92.1% (isotropic distribution of speeds).
See: Root-mean-square speed

Transport properties

The kinetic theory of gases deals not only with gases in thermodynamic equilibrium, but also very importantly with gases not in thermodynamic equilibrium. This means considering what are known as 'transport properties', such a viscosity and thermal conductivity.

History

In approximately 50 BCE, the Roman philosopher Lucretius proposed that apparently static macroscopic bodies were composed on a small scale of rapidly moving atoms all bouncing off each other. This Epicurean atomistic point of view was rarely considered in the subsequent centuries, when Aristotlean ideas were dominant.
In 1738 Daniel Bernoulli published Hydrodynamica, which laid the basis for the kinetic theory of gases.  In this work, Bernoulli posited the argument, still used to this day, that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the gas pressure that we feel, and that what we experience as heat is simply the kinetic energy of their motion. The theory was not immediately accepted, in part because conservation of energy had not yet been established, and it was not obvious to physicists how the collisions between molecules could be perfectly elastic.
Other pioneers of the kinetic theory (which were neglected by their contemporaries) were Mikhail Lomonosov (1747),Lomonosov 1758 Georges-Louis Le Sage (ca. 1780, published 1818),Le Sage 1780/1818 John Herapath (1816)Herapath 1816, 1821 and John James Waterston (1843),Waterston 1843 which connected their research with the development of mechanical explanations of gravitation. In 1856 August Krönig (probably after reading a paper of Waterston) created a simple gas-kinetic model, which only considered the translational motion of the particles.Krönig 1856
In 1857 Rudolf Clausius, according to his own words independently of Krönig, developed a similar, but much more sophisticated version of the theory which included translational and contrary to Krönig also rotational and vibrational molecular motions. In this same work he introduced the concept of mean free path of a particle.
Clausius 1857
In 1859, after reading a paper by Clausius, James Clerk Maxwell formulated the Maxwell distribution of molecular velocities, which gave the proportion of molecules having a certain velocity in a specific range.  This was the first-ever statistical law in physics."Maxwell 1875
In 1871, Ludwig Boltzmann generalized Maxwell's achievement and formulated the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. Also the logarithmic connection between entropy and probability was first stated by him.
In the beginning of the twentieth century, however, atoms were considered by many physicists to be purely hypothetical constructs, rather than real objects. An important turning point was Albert Einstein's (1905)Einstein 1905 and Marian Smoluchowski's (1906)Smoluchowski 1906
papers on Brownian motion, which succeeded in making certain accurate quantitative predictions based on the kinetic theory.
