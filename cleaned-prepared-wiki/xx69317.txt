"Here, There and Everywhere" is a song written by Paul McCartney
Inspired by the Beach Boys' album Pet Sounds, McCartney wrote the song at Lennon's house in Weybridge while waiting for Lennon to wake up. "I sat out by the pool on one of the sun chairs with my guitar and started strumming in E," McCartney recalled. "And soon I had a few chords, and I think by the time he'd woken up, I had pretty much written the song, so we took it indoors and finished it up."

Musical structure

The verse is based on an ascending major chord sequence, while the middle eight, which modulates to the tonic minor, creates a telling contrast. The introduction beginning "To lead a better life" opens in the key of G and involves a I-iii-♭III-ii-V7 chord progression. The ♭III (B♭ chord) on "I need my love to be here" (arpeggiated in the melody line) is a dissonant substitute for the more predictable VI (E7) that would normally lead to the ii (Am) chord.
The verse opens strongly anchored on "Here" in the key of G (with simultaneous I (G chord) and melody G note) and moves equally predictably to a I-ii-iii-IV chord shift (G-Am-Bm-C) through "making each day of the year".
The harmonic fascination with the bridge segment beginning "I want her everywhere" is that at that point the key centre does go "everywhere". It shifts via an F7 chord (a ♭VII in the old G key and a V7 in the new B♭ key) to a I-vi-ii (B♭-Gm-Cm) chord progression in B♭ key. It then shifts again via a D7 chord (a III7 in the old B♭ key and a V7 in the new Gm key) to Gm key where we go through a i-iv (Gm-Cm chord) progression. Finally the pivot of D7 takes us back to the G major tonic and reinforcing G melody note of "Everywhere."
Rolling Stone has noted, "The tune's chord sequence bears Brian Wilson's influence, ambling through three related keys without ever fully settling into one, and the modulations — particularly the one on the line "changing my life with a wave of her hand" — deftly underscore the lyrics, inspired by McCartney's girlfriend, actress Jane Asher."

Recording

The song is noted for its bitter-sweet melody, layered backing vocals and utilising a 'clever harmonic scheme'.

Personnel

Cover versions

Noted performers who have covered "Here, There and Everywhere" include Beegie Adair, Marina Verenikina, and Andy Williams.
Bruce Welch of The Shadows claimed in his autobiography that McCartney offered the tune to Shadow's lead guitarist Hank Marvin prior to the Beatles' recording. Marvin eventually released an instrumental version of the song on his 2007 album Guitar Man.

Cultural references

In the TV series Friends, this song is played on steel drums when Phoebe Buffay walks down the aisle during her wedding. It was the second time a song written by McCartney was used in a wedding sequence in the series; the first being "My Love" when Chandler and Monica married.
Geoff Emerick, who engineered many of the Beatles' recordings, used the song title in the title of his own 2006 memoir, Here, There, and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of The Beatles.
Gary Sparrow sings this song on the piano in an episode of Goodnight Sweetheart.
