The North–South divide is broadly considered a socio-economic and political divide. Generally, definitions of the North include the United States, Canada, developed parts of Europe, and East Asia. The South is made up of Africa, Latin America, and developing Asia including the Middle East. The North is home to four of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and all members of the G8. 
"The North" mostly covers the West and the First World, along with much of the Second World. While the North may be defined as the richer, more developed region and the South as the poorer, less developed region, many more factors differentiate between the two global areas.  95% of the North has enough food and shelter. Similarly, 95% of the North has a functioning education system. In the South, on the other hand, only 5% of the population has enough food and shelter. It "lacks appropriate technology, it has no political stability, the economies are disarticulated, and their foreign exchange earnings depend on primary product exports."  
In economic terms, the North—with one quarter of the world population—controls four fifths of the world income. 90% of the manufacturing industries are owned by and located in the North.  As nations become economically developed, they may become part of the "North", regardless of geographical location, while any other nations which do not qualify for "developed" status are in effect deemed to be part of the "South".

History

The idea of categorizing countries by their economic and developmental status began during the Cold War with the classifications of East and West. The Soviet Union and China represented the developing East, and the United States and their allies represented the more developed West. The term "Third World" was coined by states hoping to navigate between the two poles of the Cold War, and ultimately gave birth to the movement of Non-aligned Nations. These countries were generally less economically developed than their First- and Second World counterparts. As some Second World countries joined the First World, and others joined the Third World, a new and simpler classification was needed. The First World became the "North" and the Third World became the "South".

Problems with defining the divide

Following the fall of the Eastern Bloc, which was commonly referred to as the Second World, many of its constituent countries were reclassified as developing, despite being geographically northern. At the same time, geographically southern nations previously considered "developing," such as the East Asian Tigers or Turkey, have joined the modern First World, but are classified inconsistently in maps showing the north–south divide. Similarly, dependencies and former dependencies of developed nations are also classified as Southern, although they are part of the developed world;Therien. J.P, (1999) Beyond the north–south divide: the two tales of world poverty. Third World Quarterly. Vol 20. No. 4. pp723-742 most notably Australia and New Zealand, the latter being the most southern (in terms of its center of overall land mass) of all independent sovereign states.
On an ideological level, some development geographers have argued that current concentration on the north–south divide as the main organizing principle for understanding the world economy has overlooked the role of inter-imperial conflicts between the United States, Japan, and Europe., (1986), Capitalist World Development.
