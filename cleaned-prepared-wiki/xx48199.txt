[[Radiolaria]]

CATEGORIES: Radiolarians, Amoeboids

The Radiolaria are protozoa of (diameter 0.1–0.2 mm) that produce intricate mineral skeletons, and they work in the nervous system, typically with a central capsule dividing the cell into the inner and outer portions of endoplasm and ectoplasm. They are found as zooplankton throughout the ocean, and their skeletal remains make up a large part of the cover of the ocean floor as siliceous ooze. Due to their rapid turn-over of species, they represent an important diagnostic fossil found from the Cambrian onwards. Some common radiolarian fossils include Actinomma, Heliosphaera and Hexadoridium.

Description

Radiolarians have many needle-like pseudopodia supported by bundles of microtubules, which aid in the Radiolarian's buoyancy. The cell nucleus and most other organelles are in the endoplasm, while the ectoplasm is filled with frothy vacuoles and lipid droplets, keeping them buoyant. The radiolarian can often contain symbiotic algae, especially zooxanthellae, which provide most of the cell's energy. Some of this organization is found among the heliozoa, but those lack central capsules and only produce simple scales and spines.
Some radiolarians are known for their resemblance to regular polyhedra, such as  the icosahedron-shaped Circogonia icosahedra pictured to the left.

Taxonomy

The radiolarians belongs to the supergroup Rhizaria together with Cercozoa and Foraminifera. Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology 56:16–25. Traditionally the radiolarians have been divided into four groups—Acantharea, Nassellaria, Spumellaria and Phaeodaria. Phaeodaria is however now considered to be a Cercozoan. European Journal of Protistology 41:287–298. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 101:8066–8071. Nassellaria and Spumellaria both produce siliceous skeletons and were therefore grouped together in the group Polycystina. Despite some initial suggestions to the contrary, this is also supported by molecular phylogenies. The Acantharea produce skeletons of strontium sulfate and is closely related to a peculiar genus, Sticholonche (Taxopodida), which lacks an internal skeleton and was for long time considered a heliozoan. The Radiolaria can therefore be divided into two major lineages: Polycystina (Spumellaria + Nassellaria) and Spasmaria (Acantharia + Taxopodida). PLoS One 6(8):e23526. Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews 57:953–994.
There are several higher-order groups that have been detected in molecular analyses of environmental data. Particularly, groups related to Acantharia and Spumellaria. Environmental Microbiology 9:1233–1252. These groups are so far completely unknown in terms of morphology and physiology and the radiolarian diversity is therefore likely to be much higher than what is currently known. 
The relationship between the Foraminifera and Radiolaria is also debated. Molecular trees supports their close relationship—a grouping termed Retaria. The Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology 46:347–366. But whether they are sister lineages or if the Foraminifera should be included within the Radiolaria is not known.

Fossil record

The earliest known radiolaria date to the very start of the Cambrian period, appearing in the same beds as the first small shelly fauna—they may even be terminal Precambrian in age. They have significant differences from later radiolaria, with a different silica lattice structure and few, if any, spikes on the test. Ninety percent of radiolarian species are extinct. The skeletons, or tests, of ancient radiolarians are used in geological dating, including for oil exploration and determination of ancient climates.Radiolarians

Haeckel's radiolarians

German biologist Ernst Haeckel produced finely detailed drawings of radiolaria in Kunstformen der Natur (1904), helping to popularize these protists among Victorian parlor microscopists alongside foraminifera and diatoms, in addition to two lengthy illustrated monographs from field observation dedicated to Radiolaria, intended for academic study.
Proteus: A Nineteenth Century Vision, written and directed by David Lebrun, is an animated documentary focusing on Radiolaria, making extensive use of Haeckel's drawings.imdb.com/title/tt0391407/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1
