[[Louisiana Highway 611]]

CATEGORIES: State highways in Louisiana

Louisiana Highway 611 (LA 611) is a collection of three current and ten former state-maintained streets in Jefferson, Metairie, and New Orleans.  All thirteen routes were established with the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering.

Current routes

Louisiana Highway 611-1

From the west, LA 611-1 begins on River Road at an intersection with Jefferson Heights Avenue in Jefferson.  LA 611-1 continues eastward, running parallel to the Mississippi River, and intersects LA 611-3 (Shrewsbury Road).  The route ends at the Jefferson Parish/Orleans Parish Line adjacent to Monticello Avenue.  LA 611-1 is known locally as River Road and is an undivided, two-lane highway for its entire length.
LA 611-1 formerly intersected five other routes in the LA 611 group that have since been deleted from the state highway system: LA 611-2 (Central Avenue), LA 611-4 (Labarre Road), LA 611-5 (Brooklyn Avenue), LA 611-7 (Dakin Street), and LA 611-8 (Monticello Avenue).
LA 611-1 comprised most of State Routes 459 and 1232 in the pre-1955 Louisiana highway system.

Louisiana Highway 611-3

From the south, LA 611-3 begins at an intersection with LA 611-1 (River Road) in Jefferson and, after passing the Jefferson Parish Streets Department facility, terminates at an intersection with U.S. 90 (Jefferson Highway).  The route is known locally as Shrewsbury Road and is an undivided, two-lane highway for its entire length.
LA 611-3 originally continued along Shrewsbury Road past U.S. 90 and across the railroad tracks to U.S. 61 (Airline Highway, now Airline Drive).  The route was severed in June 1957 when the railroad crossing on Shrewsbury Road was closed following completion of the parallel Causeway Boulevard (LA 3046) overpass.  The extension of the Earhart Expressway (LA 3139) from Deckbar Avenue to Cleary Avenue in 1984 created a second barrier.  In 2002, the segment of LA 611-3 north of the railroad tracks was given a separate route number, LA 3261, before being deleted altogether in 2010.  LA 611-3 was then shortened to its present terminus at U.S. 90.
In its original form, the route of LA 611-3 included what was once a small piece of the Jefferson Highway (State Route 1 in the pre-1955 Louisiana highway system) and U.S. 61 prior to the direct extension of Jefferson Highway into South Claiborne Avenue in 1928.  Shrewsbury Road then became part of State Route 454 until the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering.

Louisiana Highway 611-9

From the west, LA 611-9 begins at the intersection of U.S. 61 (Airline Drive) and Severn Avenue.  After briefly heading north on Severn Avenue, LA 611-9 immediately turns eastward onto Metairie Road.  The first block of Metairie Road handles eastbound traffic only, and westbound traffic is diverted onto parallel Johnson Street to reach Severn Avenue.  Running east atop the Metairie Ridge, LA 611-9 passes under Causeway Boulevard and intersects Bonnabel Boulevard.  It enters New Orleans/Orleans Parish before coming to an end at a diamond interchange (Exit 231A) with I-10 (the Pontchartrain Expressway) at Pontchartrain Boulevard.
With the exception of the block-long divided, four-lane section near Severn Avenue (configured in February 1957), LA 611-9 is an undivided, two-lane highway in Jefferson Parish.  It divides and expands to four lanes when it enters New Orleans and remains in that capacity until its terminus at I-10.
In December 1916, the route of today's LA 611-9 was designated as the New Orleans entrance of the Jefferson Highway.  This became State Route 1 in 1921 and U.S. 61 in 1926.  These highways were moved off of the route in 1928-1929 when Jefferson Highway was extended along the Orleans-Kenner interurban streetcar right-of-way from Shrewsbury Road to the Protection Levee at South Claiborne Avenue to provide a more direct entrance into New Orleans.  The former route along Shrewsbury Road and Metairie Road became State Route 454 until the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering.  (Today's LA 611-9 briefly carried U.S. 61 again from 1933 to 1935.)

Former routes

Louisiana Highway 611-2

From the south, LA 611-2 began at an intersection with LA 611-1 (River Road) in Jefferson.  LA 611-2 continued along Central Avenue northward to a terminus at U.S. 90/LA 48 (Jefferson Highway).  LA 48 eastbound traversed the remainder of Central Avenue northward to U.S. 61 (Airline Drive).  LA 611-2 was an undivided, two-lane highway for its entire length.
Central Avenue became a local road in 2010, eliminating LA 611-2 and truncating the eastern terminus of LA 48.
LA 611-2 was known as State Route 1234 in the pre-1955 Louisiana highway system.

Louisiana Highway 611-4

From the south, LA 611-4 began at an intersection with LA 611-1 (River Road) in Jefferson.  After an intersection with U.S. 90 (Jefferson Highway), LA 611-4 continued northward to a dead end at the railroad tracks south of LA 3139 (Earhart Expressway).  LA 611-4 followed Labarre Road and was an undivided, two-lane highway for its entire length.
LA 611-4 originally continued along Labarre Road across the railroad tracks to U.S. 61 (Airline Highway, now Airline Drive).

The extension of the Earhart Expressway (LA 3139) from Deckbar Avenue to Cleary Avenue in 1984 created a second barrier.
