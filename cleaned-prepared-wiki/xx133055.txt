Cory Environmental is a large waste disposal company based in the United Kingdom. Cory operates in more than 30 locations throughout England, providing services in the collection, recycling and disposal of waste as well as municipal cleansing.

Operations

Cory is one of the UK's leading waste management companies. It handles more than 3.5 million tonnes of waste and recyclable materials per year at sites across the UK and has contracts for recycling, street cleansing and waste collection stretching from Merseyside to Kent and Cornwall. It may be best known for operating barges on the River Thames from central London out to Cory's Mucking Marshes Landfill site. About 15% of London's waste is transferred by barge, removing 100,000 lorry movements per year from London's roads.

History

Coal and refuse

The company was founded in London in 1896 as William Cory and Son Ltd. Cory was formed form the merger of eight companies in the coal trade and had a comprehensive business in transporting and supplying five million tonnes of coal per year to trade and domestic customers in London. Cory had a fleet of 2,500 railway wagons and also operated lighters on the River Thames. Rather than operate its lighters unladen on their return journeys from delivering coal, Cory used them to carry refuse from London to be dumped in the marshlands of Essex and Kent.
After the turn of the 20th century, Cory started to provide social housing for some of its workforce.
Cory ships had brown upper works above hull level.Harnack, 1938, plate 30, between pages 612–613 The house flag was red with a large white or cream diamond in the middle.
In 1900 S.P. Austin & Co of Sunderland built the 1,780 GRT coaster SS ''Heston for the company. On 24 May 1902 she was en route from Decido to Rotterdam laden with iron ore when she was involved in a collision with SS Castillo'' and sank in the Bay of Biscay southwest of Point Penmarc'h in Brittany.
In 1902 S.P. Austin & Co. built the 1,191 GRT collier SS ''Caenwood'' for the company. On 21 November 1905 she ran aground and was wrecked in the North Sea off the North Landing of Flamborough Head.
In 1896 Cory bought the 867 GRT coaster SS ''F.T. Barry, which Backhouse and Dixon of Middlesbrough had built in 1872. On 23 June 1906 she was involved in a collision in the North Sea with SS Tynesider'', was beached on Gunfleet Sands off Clacton-on-Sea and became a total loss.
In 1896 Cory bought the 1,053 GRT coaster SS ''Nellie Wise, which Denton Gray & Co of West Hartlepool had built in 1873. northwest of Hartlepool. She was refloated but sold for scrap.
In 1909 S.P. Austin & Co. built the 2,660 GRT coaster SS ''William Cory'' for the company. She ran aground at Pendeen in Cornwall and was wrecked in September 1910.

First World War

During the First World War the War Department requisitioned most of Cory's tugs for the Royal Navy. In 1914 Cory encouraged its workers to enlist in Kitchener's Army, and they formed an entire company of the 6th battalion, the Royal East Kent Regiment (The Buffs) as a pals' unit.
Cory cargo ships sailed usually coastal convoys but sometimes independently. The company lost 15 ships: 13 were confirmed sunk by enemy action, one disappeared and was presumed sunk by enemy action and one was sunk by a collision. 94 seafarers were killed and numerous others were injured.

Cory since 1945

The Second World War was not the end of Cory's losses at sea. Swan Hunter built the 2,373 GRT collier SS Hopecrest in 1918. Cory bought her from her original owners in 1919 and renamed her SS ''Corcrest''.

S.P. Austin & Co built the 2,374 GRT collier SS ''Corchester in 1927.s crew were lost, of whom six had been in her forecastle accommodation. Survivors were rescued by another Cory ship, SS Cormull''.
By the 1950s Cory was transporting and supplying fuel oil as well as coal. In 1956 Cory started to develop a fleet of barges designed specifically to carry refuse rather than coal. Cory had its own barge-building yard, which produced more than 400 such vessels between 1962 and 1972. Oil-fired central heating grew in popularity such that by 1972 Cory was supplying  per year to domestic customers.
In 1972 Ocean Group plc bought Cory. In 1979 Cory bought Thames and General Lighterage, making Cory the largest waste carrier on the Thames. In the 1980s Cory withdrew from coal and oil distribution to concentrate on waste transport and disposal. In 1981 two Cory group companies were merged to form Cory Waste Management. Cory Environmental Municipal Services Ltd was formed in 1989 and the two companies were merged as Cory Environmental in 1990. In 1997 Cory Environmental grew by buying Local Authority Waste Disposal Companies from Essex County Council and Gloucestershire County Council. In 1999 Cory bought Parkhill Reclamation, increasing Cory's presence in the West Midlands and North West England.
In 2000 Ocean Group plc merged with NFC plc to form Exel plc, which in 2005 sold Cory to Montagu Private Equity. In March 2007 Montagu sold Cory to a consortium of investors consisting of ABN Amro Global Infrastructure Fund, Finpro SGPS and Santander Private Equity.
In 2012 Cory Environmental were awarded an eight year contract to provide the waste collection services throughout the county of Cornwall.
