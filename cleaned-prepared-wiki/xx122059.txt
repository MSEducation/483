Final Points Standings

Rookie of the Year

Ricky Craven, who had won twice last year as a Busch North competitor in combination races (a common NASCAR regional racing practice;  Busch Series and Busch North Series in the Northeastern United States were combined as combination races), finished fourteenth in points and won Rookie of the Year after being the only competitor to attempt the full schedule. Shawna Robinson was the next contender, finishing 38th in the final standings. Robert Huffman, Randy MacDonald, and Greg Trammell also declared for the award, but did not exceed the five race minimum needed to remain eligible.
Craven was officially a rookie even though he raced in seven races in 1991, two more than the allowable limit of five races.  NASCAR, however, declared he had only raced in two races (the two Martinsville races), and the other five races were entered as a Busch North Series driver, as his car carried a Busch North Series sticker.
