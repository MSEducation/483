History

Beginnings (2004-2006)

Take the Crown was founded early 2004 by Beau Bokan and Tony Gonzalez. The original lineup was constantly changing and was more reminiscent of pop punk acts of the likes of Blink 182 or Pennywise than any of the bands recorded works. The early line-up, including the likes of Martine Stewart (Donnybrook, Terror), changed constantly as did the band's sound. During the early stages of Take the Crown, the band occasionally performed in the Los Angeles area at venues such as Skateland and The Knitting Factory. Take the Crown eventually added Nick Coffey, Ryan Wilson,  James Campbell, and Aaron Birdsaw to the permanent lineup and began to move in a more Post-Hardcore direction. Take the Crown quickly gained local notoriety in the Southern California music scene, playing with such acts as the The Aquabats, Eighteen Visions, and performing to packed crowds at their home venue Chain Reaction.
