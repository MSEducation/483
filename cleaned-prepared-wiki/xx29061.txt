Tychy ( south of Katowice. Situated on the southern edge of the Upper Silesian industrial district, the city borders Katowice to the north, Mikołów to the west, Bieruń to the east and Kobiór to the south. The Gostynia river, a tributary of the Vistula, flows through Tychy.
Since 1999 Tychy has been located within the Silesian Voivodeship, a province consisting of 71 regional towns and cities. Tychy is also one of the founding cities of the Metropolitan Association of Upper Silesia, a pan-Silesian economic and political union formed with the eventual aim of bringing the most populous Silesian areas under a single administrative body.
Tychy is well known for its brewing industry, which dates back to the 17th century."Tychy", Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2009, Retrieved 2006-07-02 Since 1950 Tychy has grown rapidly, mainly as a result of post-war Communist planning policies enacted to disperse the population of industrial Upper Silesia.

History

Etymology

The moniker Tychy is derived from the Polish word cichy, meaning "quiet" or "still". (2005). Placenames of the World. Second Edition p. 386. McFarland and Company Although appropriate for most of Tychy's history, the name is now somewhat ironic considering the growth of the city from 1950 onwards.

Origins and development

Originally established as a small agricultural settlement on the medieval trade route between Oświęcim and Mikołów, Tychy was first documented in 1467.pl, "History of Tychy", Retrieved 2006-07-02 In 1629 the first trace of serious economic activity was recorded in the shape of the Książęcy Brewery, which is now one of the largest breweries in Poland.pl, "Monuments", Retrieved 2006-07-02
From 1526 onwards the area on which Tychy is built was part of the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy. This situation came to an end when Prussia forcibly took the land in 1742, before itself becoming the German Empire between 1871 and 1918. For a short period between 1918 and 1921 Tychy was just inside the border of the newly formed Weimar Republic and still a part of the German Province of Silesia, only securing its place within the Second Polish Republic after the armed Silesian Uprisings (1919 to 1921).com, "Silesia", Encyclopædia Britannica Online, Retrieved 2006-07-02
Shortly after its return to Polish administration Tychy began to develop into a small urban settlement, acquiring a hospital, a fire station, a post office, a school, a swimming pool, a bowling hall and a number of shops and restaurants. Its population also grew between World War I and World War II, reaching a population of 11,000 at its highest point during this time.

1939 to 1945: invasion and occupation

Along with the rest of industrial Upper Silesia Tychy was occupied by Nazi forces after the invasion of Poland and absorbed into the Third Reich,^ Cienciala, Anna M. (2004).

Retrieved 2009-07-03 Fortunately the city received minimal damage during the invasion, thanks largely to the fact that most of the nearby fighting took place in the Mikołów-Wyry area.pl, "History of Tychy", Retrieved 2006-07-03

New Tychy

The "New City" was designated by the Polish government in 1950 and deliberately located near to Katowice with the intention that it would not be a self-sustaining city. Tychy is the largest of the so-called "new towns" in Poland and was built from 1950 to 1985, to allow for urban expansion in the southeast of the Upper Silesian industrial region. By 2006, the population had reached 132,500.
The design and planning of New Tychy was entrusted to Kazimierz Wejchert and his wife Hanna Adamczewska-Wejchert.
In the administrative reforms which came into effect in 1999, Tychy was made a city with the status of a powiat (city county). Between 1999 and 2002, it was also the administrative seat of (but not part of) an entity called Tychy County (powiat tyski), which is now known as the Bieruń-Lędziny County.
Tychy is twinned with the town of Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
