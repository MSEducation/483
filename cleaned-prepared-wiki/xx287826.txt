Gameplay

Volume[/ref] The game is presented in a top-down third-person view of the Volume simulation, showing a floor layout, Robert's avatar, and several guards and other antagonists that guard the area. The goal is to sneak through the level without being spotted to complete various heists. The player is unable to kill these foes, but will have an arsenal of tools to distract them and avoid detection. A key element of the game is a level editor, allowing users to create their own simulated missions.

Development

Bithell expects that Volume will still have a limited budget,  he needed for Thomas Was Alone, but the extra funding has been used to hire additional programming help and 3D modelers. David Housen, who composed the Thomas soundtrack, will also create the music for Volume.
Bithell announced the game in August 2013, using a carefully managed approach to assure the news was widely disseminated on a specific day, promising further announcements on its voice cast and story at future gaming conventions.
