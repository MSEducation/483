[[Spork]]

CATEGORIES: Forks, Spoons, Eating utensils

A spork (also known as a foon) is a hybrid form of cutlery taking the form of a spoon-like shallow scoop with three or four fork tines. patents for spork-like designs date back to at least 1874, and the word "spork" was registered as a trademark in the US and the UK decades later. They are used by fast food restaurants, schools, prisons, the military, backpackers and in airline meals.
The word spork combines spoon and fork. Similarly, the word foon is a blend of fork and spoon. The word "spork" appeared in the 1909 supplement to the Century Dictionary, where it was described as a trade name and "a 'portmanteau-word' applied to a long, slender spoon having, at the end of the bowl, projections resembling the tines of a fork".

History

In the US, patents for sporks and proto-sporks have been issued. A combined spoon, fork, and knife closely resembling the modern spork was invented by Samuel W. Francis and issued US Patent 147,119 in February 1874.
The word spork originated in the early 20th century to describe such devices. In 1951, Hyde W. Ballard of Westtown, Pennsylvania filed an application with the United States Patent Office (USPO; now the United States Patent and Trademark Office) to register "Spork" as a trademark for a combination spoon and fork made of stainless steel.U.S. trademark application, serial no. 609,277, filed January 26, 1951.  Official Gazette of the United States Patent Office, vol. 665, no. 3, p. 673, December 16, 1952.  Accessed April 2, 2014. The Van Brode Milling Company subsequently registered SPORK for a combination plastic spoon, fork and knife at the USPO on October 27, 1970, but the registration expired 20 years later.U.S. trademark registration registration no. 901,492, filed October 24, 1969, registered October 27, 1970. Accessed April 2, 2014.  The word Spork accompanied by a stylised design is registered in the U.S. in relation to hand tools, in the name of a UK-based individual.U.S. trademark registration registration no. 2,514,381, filed March 23, 2000, registered December 4, 2001.

In the UK, Plastico Limited registered Spork as a trademark in relation to cutlery with effect from September 18, 1975 (reg. no. 1052291). The registration is now in the name of another company and remains in force. The trademark is also registered in the UK in relation to gardening tools in the name of the same UK based individual who owns US trademark registration no. 2514381. Another British company, Lifeventure, sells titanium and plastic versions using the name "Forkspoon".
In an unsuccessful lawsuit in 1999 where the company Regalzone sought to invalidate Plastico Limited's UK registration for Spork, Justice Neuberger wrote:

Materials and uses

Materials such as stainless steel, silver, aluminum, titanium, and polycarbonate plastic have been used in spork manufacture. Plastic sporks are common in prisons in the United States because they are difficult to form into weapons. Prepackaged meals may come with a disposable plastic spork. Sporks are also frequently used by backpackers and other outdoors enthusiasts as they are a lightweight and space-saving alternative to carrying both a fork and spoon.
