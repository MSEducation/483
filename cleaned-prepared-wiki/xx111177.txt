In 1991, The Hezbollah had entered a new era with the end of the both the Iran–Iraq War and Lebanese Civil War, the Taif Agreement and the release of the Kuwait 17 bombers. A new leader was thought to be needed to facilitate the release of the Western hostages held by Hezbollah and more importantly to shift Hezbollah's focus to resistance activity against Israel.
In May 1991, Hezbollah chose al Musawi as its secretary-general. As a former head of both the Security Apparatus (considered the instigator of hostage taking) and the military wing of Hezbollah, al Musawi was well qualified for this post.105  Al Musawi replaced the non-flexible Sheikh Subhi al-Tufayli and promised Hezbollah would "wipe out every trace of Israel in Palestine." He described Israel as "the cancer of the Middle East." Al Musawi also promised to "intensify Hezbollah military, political and popular action in order to undermine the peace-talks." Middle East International, 8 November 1991 He did not support entering mainstream politics.

Assassination

On 16 February 1992, Israeli Apache helicopters fired missiles at the motorcade of al Musawi in southern Lebanon, killing al Musawi, his wife, his five-year-old son, and four others.
In retaliation, the Islamic Jihad Organization carried out the Israeli Embassy attack in Buenos Aires. Later it was revealed by Dieter Bednarz and Ronen Bergman that the original plan of Israel had been just to abduct al Musawi to realize the release of Israeli prisoners. However, Ehud Barak, then Israeli chief of staff, convinced then Israeli Prime Minister Shamir to order his assassination.
Al Musawi was succeeded as Secretary General of Hezbollah by Hassan Nasrallah.
