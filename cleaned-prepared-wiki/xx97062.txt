Second presidency

Abdallah (who had been living in exile Paris, France) staged a coup against Soilih in 1978 with the help of mercenary Bob Denard. After Said Atthoumani had served as "Chairman of the Politico-Military Directorate" for ten days, Abdallah and Mohamed Ahmed assumed the titles of "Co-Chairmen of the Politico-Military Directorate." On 22 July, their titles were changed to "Co-Chairmen of the Directorate," and on 3 October, Abdallah became the lone chair.
On 25 October, Abdallah assumed the title of president and remained in office until his death, despite three separate coup attempts against him. Comoros became a one-party state, with the UCP being the only legal party.
Abdallah was re-elected unopposed in 1984. On 26 November 1989, he was shot dead in his Moroni office during a coup led by Ali Soilih's half-brother, Said Mohamed Djohar. Djohar took control of the country the next day.
