History

The earliest evidence of people in Bözen are a neolithic stone ax, a Roman Estate and Alamanni graves.  Bözen is first mentioned in 1284 as Boze.  During the Middle Ages it was owned by Elfingen.  Then, in  1291 it was sold, along with most of the Aargau, by Murbach Abbey to the Habsburgs  In 1322 it came under the authority of Königsfelden abbey in Windisch.  The village was bought by Bern in 1514.  Starting in the 16th century, Bözen together with Elfingen and Effingen formed a low justice district.
The chapel of Bözen was first mentioned in 1381, and was originally part of the parish of Elfingen.  Presumably in 1600 the parish was transferred to Bözen.
Economically the village was dominated by agriculture with a number of vineyards (in the mid-19th Century, some 50 ha).  With the construction of the Bözbergtunnel in 1875 the village grew.  Between 1840 and 1925, the main industry was home straw production for the straw plaiting industry.  Starting in 1980 there was a building boom, and the number of commuters increased thanks to regular bus service to Brugg (starting in 1990).
