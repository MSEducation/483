Cacti is an open-source, web-based network monitoring and graphing tool designed as a front-end application for the open-source, industry-standard data logging tool RRDtool. Cacti allows a user to poll services at predetermined intervals and graph the resulting data. It is generally used to graph time-series data of metrics such as CPU load and network bandwidth utilization. A common usage is to monitor network traffic by polling a network switch or router interface via simple network management protocol (SNMP).
The front end can handle multiple users, each with their own graph sets, so it is sometimes used by web hosting providers
Cacti can use one of two back ends: "cmd.

History

The Cacti project was first started by Ian Berry on September 2, 2001. Berry was inspired to start the project while working for a small ISP while also still in high school, learning PHP and MySQL. His central aim in creating Cacti "was to offer more ease of use than RRDtool and more flexibility than MRTG."
On September 13, 2004, version 0.8.6 was released, and with it came more developers and, later on, greater program speed and scalability.
Version 0.8.7 was released for use in October 2007. but by August 2013 it was replaced by a notice that "This roadmap is out of date. We are reorganizing to improve the development cycle of Cacti.
More information coming before the end of 2013!".
Version 0.8.8b was released in August 2013 with numerous bug and security issues patched.
