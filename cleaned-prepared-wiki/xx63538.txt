The Battle of the Somme is a 1916 British documentary and propaganda film, shot by two official cinematographers, Geoffrey Malins and John McDowell. The film depicts the British Army in the preliminary and early days of the battle of the Somme (1 July – 18 November 1916). The film had its première in London on 10 August 1916 and was released generally on 21 August. The film depicts trench warfare, showing marching infantry, artillery firing on German positions, British troops waiting to attack on 1 July, treatment of wounded British and German soldiers, British and German dead and captured German equipment and positions. A scene where British troops crouch in a ditch then "go over the top" was staged for the camera behind the lines.

Content

The Battle of the Somme is a black-and-white silent film in five parts, with sequences divided by intertitles summarising their contents. The first part shows preparations for battle behind the British frontline; sequences include troops marching towards the front, French peasants continuing their farm work in rear areas, the stockpiling of munitions, General Beauvoir De Lisle addressing the 29th Division and some of the preparatory artillery bombardment by 18-pounder, 60-pounder and 4.7-inch guns, 6-inch, 9.2-inch howitzers and 2-inch mortars. The second part depicts more preparations, troops moving into front line trenches, the intensification of the artillery barrage by 12-inch and 15-inch howitzers, a 9.45 inch Heavy Mortar and the detonation of the Hawthorn Ridge Mine. Part three begins with the first attack on 1st July 1916 and shows the recovery of British wounded and German prisoners. The fourth part shows more scenes of British and German wounded, the clearing of the battlefield and some of the aftermath. The final part shows scenes of devastation, including the ruins of the village of Mametz, British troops at rest and preparations for the next stage of the advance.

Production

Background

On 2 November 1915 the British Topical Committee for War Films, representing British newsreel producers and supported by the War Office, despatched two cameramen to France. Geoffrey Malins of Gaumont and Edward Tong of Jury's Imperial Pictures, were to shoot footage for short newsreels.

Photography

The film was shot between 26 June and 
On 1 July Malins filmed troops of the 1st Battalion Lancashire Fusiliers, waiting to advance from a sunken lane in no man's land, which had been occupied by digging a 

Editing

On 10 July, Brigadier General John Charteris reported to the War Office that some 

Release

The film comprised five reels and was seventy-seven minutes long.
A musical medley with excerpts from classical, folk, contemporary and popular pieces, to be played live in cinemas by accompanying musicians, was devised by J. Morton Hutcheson and published  in The Bioscope on 17 August 1916.

Reception

Britain

The popularity of the film was unprecedented and cinemas played the film for longer runs than usual, often to packed houses, while some arranged additional screenings to meet demand.
British authorities showed the film to the public as a morale-booster and in general it met with a favourable reception. The Times reported on 22 August that: Crowded audiences ... were interested and thrilled to have the realities of war brought so vividly before them, and if women had sometimes to shut their eyes to escape for a moment from the tragedy of the toll of battle which the film presents, opinion seems to be general that it was wise that the people at home should have this glimpse of what our soldiers are doing and daring and suffering in Picardy. 
Some members of the audience considered it immoral to portray scenes of violence; the Dean of Durham protested "against an entertainment which wounds the heart and violates the very sanctity of bereavement". Others complained that such a serious film shared the cinema programme with comedy films.

International

The film was shown in New Zealand in October 1916. On 12 October the Wellington Evening Post ran an advertisement for the film, describing it as "the extraordinary films of 'the big push' and "an awe-inspiring, glorious presentation of what our heroes are accomplishing today".
The film and its reception was of great interest to Germans, who were able to read a report from a neutral reporter in London, filed in the 

Other films

During the second week of August the King, Prime Minister and War Minister toured the Western Front and were filmed by Malins. The War Office released the film in October as The King Visits His Armies in the Great Advance.

Preservation

In 1920 the original nitrate negative was passed to the Imperial War Museum for preservation. A nitrate protection archive master was made in 1921 and an acetate safety master in 1931. The nitrate masters were destroyed in the 1970s after the onset of irreversible nitrate decomposition.
On 22 October 2006, after a restoration project a refined version of the film was screened at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, accompanied by the performance of an original orchestral score by Laura Rossi.
