[[Fairy chess piece]]

CATEGORIES: Fairy chess pieces, Chess variants, Chess problems

A fairy chess piece or unorthodox chess piece is a chess piece not used in conventional chess but incorporated into in certain chess variants and some chess problems. Fairy pieces vary in the way they move.
Because of the distributed and uncoordinated nature of unorthodox chess development, the same piece can have different names and different pieces the same name in various contexts.

Classification

Fairy chess pieces usually fall into one of three classes, although some are hybrids. Compound pieces combine the movement powers of two or more different pieces.
A specialized solving program, WinChloe, recognizes more than 1200 different fairy pieces.

Movement type

=Leapers=

An (m,n)-leaper is a piece that moves by a fixed type of vector between its start square and its arrival square. One of the coordinates of the vector 'start square – arrival square' must have an absolute value equal to m and the other one an absolute value equal to n. A leaper moves in the same way whether or not it captures, the taken unit being on the arrival square. For instance, the knight is the (1,2)-leaper.
The leaper's move cannot be blocked; it "leaps" over any intervening pieces, like the knight in standard chess.
In shatranj, a forerunner to chess, the pieces later replaced by the bishop and queen were also leapers: the alfil was a (2,2)-leaper (moving exactly two squares diagonally in any direction), and the fers or ferz a (1,1)-leaper (moving exactly one square diagonally in any direction). The king of standard chess combines the ferz and wazir.
The dabbaba is a (2,0)-leaper. The alibaba combines the dabbaba and alfil, while the squirrel can move to any square 2 units away (combining the knight and alibaba). The Arabic word dabbāba formerly meant a type of medieval siege engine, and nowadays means "army tank".
Leapers are not able to create pins, but are often effective forking pieces. The check of a leaper cannot be parried by interposing.
All orthodox chessmen except the pawn are either leapers or riders, although the rook does 'hop' when it castles.
The 'level-3' leapers are the threeleaper, a (3,0)-leaper; the tripper, a (3,3)-leaper; the camel, a (1,3)-leaper; and the zebra, a (2,3)-leaper.
Below, the Betza notation for these pieces is also given.
An amphibian is a combined leaper with a larger range on the board than its components. The simplest amphibian is the Frog, a (1,1)-(0,3)-leaper (HF).

=Riders=

A rider is a piece that can move an unlimited distance in one direction, provided there are no pieces in the way.
There are three riders in orthodox chess: the rook can move an unlimited number of (1,0) cells and is therefore a (1,0)-rider; the bishop is a (1,1)-rider; and the queen is a (1,1)- or (1,0)-rider.
One of the most popular fairy chess riders is the nightrider, which can make an unlimited number of knight moves (that is, (1,2) cells) in any direction in a straight line (like other riders, it cannot change direction partway through its move).
Sliders are a noteworthy special case of riders which can only move between geometrically contiguous cells.  All of the riders in orthodox chess are examples of sliders.
The names of riders are often obtained by taking the name of a leaper which moves a similar cell size and adding the suffix "rider". For example, the zebra is a (2,3)-leaper, and the zebrarider is a (2,3)-rider.
Riders can create both pins and skewers.

=Hoppers=

A hopper is a piece that moves by jumping over another piece (called a hurdle).  The hurdle can usually be any piece of any color. Unless it can jump over a piece, a hopper cannot move.  Note that hoppers generally capture by taking the piece on the destination square, not by taking the hurdle (as is the case in checkers). The exceptions are called locusts.
There are no hoppers in Western chess, although in xiangqi, the cannon captures as a hopper (when not capturing, it is a rider which cannot capture).
The most popular hopper in fairy chess is the grasshopper, which moves along the same lines as an orthodox queen, except that it must hop over some other piece and land on the square immediately beyond it.

=Locusts=

A locust is any piece which captures by hopping over its victim (as in checkers).  It is sometimes considered a type of hopper.

=Marine piece=

A marine piece is a combination piece consisting of a rider (for ordinary moves) and a locust (for captures) in the same directions. Marine pieces have names alluding to the sea and its myths, e.g., nereïde (marine bishop), triton (marine rook), mermaid (marine queen), or poseidon (marine king).

Games

Some classes of pieces come from a certain game; often these have a common set of characteristics.

=Chinese pieces=

Chinese pieces are pieces derived from those found in xiangqi, the Chinese form of chess. The most common Chinese pieces are the  leo, pao and vao (each of which are derived from the Chinese cannon) and the mao (derived from the horse). Those derived from the cannon are distinguished by moving as a hopper when capturing, but otherwise moving as a rider. Less frequently encountered Chinese pieces include the moa, nao and rao.

Special attributes

=Royal pieces=

A royal piece is one which must not be allowed to be captured. If a royal piece is threatened with capture and cannot avoid capture next move, then the game is lost (this is "checkmate"). In orthodox chess, each side has one royal piece, the king. In fairy chess any other orthodox piece or fairy piece may instead be designated royal, there may be more than one royal piece, or there may be no royal pieces at all (in which case the aim of the game must be something other than to deliver checkmate, such as capturing all of the opponent's pieces).

=Xed pieces=

Notations

Parlett's movement notation

In his book The Oxford History of Board GamesParlett, 1999 David Parlett used a notation to describe fairy piece movements. The move is specified by an expression of the form m={expression}, where m stands for "move", and the expression is composed from the following elements:

=Additions to Parlett's=

The following can be added to Parlett's to make it more complete:
The format (not including grouping) is: <conditions> <move type> <distance> <direction> <other>
On this basis, the traditional chess moves (excluding castling and en passant capture) are:

Ralph Betza's "funny notation"

Ralph Betza created a classification scheme for fairy chess pieces (including standard chess pieces) in terms of the moves of basic pieces with modifiers.chessvariants.dir/betzanot.html Betza Notation by Glen Overby II
Capital letters stand for basic pieces and components, besides the standard abbreviation for the chess pieces (R, N, B, Q, and K) the following letters are used: Wazir, Ferz, Alfil, Dabbaba, H (0,3)-leaper, Long Knight (CameL), J (2,3)-leaper (Zebra), and G (3,3)-leaper. Riders are denoted by duplication of the letter, e.g., NN is the funny notation for the nightrider piece; restricted range is denoted by a digit after the letter, e.g., R4 is a rook restricted to at most 4 steps.
Small letters in front of the capital letters denote modifications of the component. Often used modifiers are: forward, b, right, left, sideward, vertical, move only, capture only, z crooked (moving in a zigzag line like the Boyscout),  grasshopper, jumping (i.e., it must jump, cannot move without a hurdle), non-jumping like the Chinese Elephant, o cylindrical,  pao (like the Chinese Cannon captures), then (for pieces that start moving in one direction and then continue in another, like the Gryphon and Aanca), and q circular movement (like the Rose).
In addition, Betza has also suggested adding brackets to his notation: qWFqFW would be a circular king, which can move from e4 to f5 then g5, h4, h3, g2, f2, e3, and back to e4, effectively passing a turn.
Example: The standard chess pawn can be described in Ralph Betza's funny notation as mfWcfF (ignoring the initial double move).
There is no standard order of the components and modifiers. In fact, Betza often plays with the order to create somehow pronouncable piece names and artistic word play.

=Addition to Betza's=

Betza does not use the small letter i. It is used here for initial in the description of the different types of pawns.
