[[Placentalia]]

CATEGORIES: Mammals

Placentalia is a group of mammals. The majority of living mammals are placental: the other two living mammal groups are the Monotremata and the Marsupialia. The placentals are distinguished from other mammals in that the fetus is nourished during gestation via a placenta while, in general, this is not the case with other mammals (Bandicoots are an exception). They reproduce sexually, and the young is carried in the mother until fully developed. Placental mammals are viviparous.

Evolution

The earliest known placental mammal species (including Protungulatum donnae, Purgatorius coracis, and Leptacodon proserpinae) are all dated to the early Paleogene period, about 65 million years ago. True placental mammals appeared shortly after the K-Pg extinction event and quickly diversified into ecological niches previously occupied by various groups of dinosaurs and other prehistoric reptiles. True placental mammals (the crown group of all modern placentals) arose from stem-group members of the clade Eutheria, which had existed since at least the mid-Jurassic period.

Description

Placental mammals are distinguished from other eutherians by:

Classification

Placentals are divided into three major groups:
Molecular studies based on DNA analysis have revised the understanding of relationships among placental groups during the 21st century. Boreoeutheria in turn contains two major lineages- Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria.
Estimates for the divergence times among these three placental groups range from 105 to 120 million years ago, depending on type of DNA (e.g. nuclear or mitochondrial) and varying interpretations of paleogeographic data.
