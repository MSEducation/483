[[Carrier Strike Group Fourteen]]

CATEGORIES: Carrier Strike Groups, Military units and formations established in 2004, Military units and formations disestablished in the 2010s, Military in Florida

Carrier Strike Group Fourteen (CSG-14 or CARSTRKGRU 14) was a U.S. Navy carrier strike group. Carrier Strike Group Fourteen was for some time the only U.S. carrier strike group that does not have an assigned aircraft carrier or carrier air wing.. Carrier Strike Group Fourteen is currently based at Naval Station Mayport. Without a carrier flagship, it does not conduct the typical deployments of other carrier strike groups; instead, its two cruisers making independent voyages.
The group is not listed in the Administrative Organisation of the Operating Forces of the United States Navy: Fleet Chain of Command, March 2012, and thus appears to have been disestablished.



Commander Carrier Strike Group Fourteen exercises oversight of unit-level training, integrated training, and readiness for assigned ships and units, as well as maintains administrative functions and material readiness tracking for ships and squadrons assigned to the strike group.
The group reports to the Commander of the United States Fleet Forces Command as one of its six carrier strike groups currently assigned to that command.  The group's pre-deployment training and certification would theoretically come under the control of Fleet Forces Command following the disestablisment of the U.S. Second Fleet on 30 September 2011. However, without a carrier assigned, the group does not conduct pre-deployment group workups. 
Administratively, Gettysburg and Philippine Sea are under the authority of Commander, Naval Surface Forces Atlantic.
Ticonderoga class cruisers provide a wide range of capabilities, including ballistic missile defense (BMD), regional air defense (RAD), battlespace management (BSM), maritime interdiction operations (MIO), maritime security operations (MSO), and precision strike tomahawk (PST) strike missions.

Historical background

Effective 30 June 1973, Commander Cruiser Destroyer Flotilla Twelve was re-designated as Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Group Twelve (CCDG-12). In 1986, while commanding  Cruiser-Destroyer Group Twelve, Rear Admiral Henry H. Mauz, Jr., commanded the  
Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12 previously served as Immediate Superior-in-Command for .
On September 1, 2004, Commander, Cruiser Destroyer Group 12 transferred command of the USS Enterprise (CVN 65) and its Carrier Strike Group to Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 8. This apparently left Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12 without an assigned aircraft carrier.
On 1 October 2004, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12 was redesignated Carrier Strike Group 14.
As of 2010, Carrier Strike Group 14 may have been deactivated. The Navy's Strike Group 14 webpage is no longer active, and the admiral listed in command is no longer mentioned in the official US Navy biography website of currently active flag officers, suggesting this officer may have since retired.
It was announced on October 22, 2009 that the last listed commander of the group, Rear Admiral Bernard J McCullough, was to be 
reassigned from deputy chief of naval operations for integration of capabilities and resources, N8, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, for reappointment to the grade of vice admiral and assignment as commander, Fleet Cyber Command/commander, Tenth Fleet, Fort Meade, Md.defense.aspx?releaseid=13071
