Vehicles

In 1983, after Warner Communications had purchased the Franklin Mint, the company entered the diecast vehicle market introducing a 1935 Mercedes Benz 500K Roadster. Usually the cars were labeled as Franklin Mint Precision Models. In the following years, Franklin Mint produced more than 600 different issues of motorcycles, trucks and tractors besides automobiles.

Changes in ownership

In 1980, Warner Communications (now part of Time Warner) purchased The Franklin Mint for about $225 million.  The combination was short lived: Warner sold The Franklin Mint in 1985 to American Protection Industries Inc. (API) for $167.5 million.  However, Warner retained Eastern Mountain Sports, a retailer that The Franklin Mint had acquired in the 1970s, as well as The Franklin Mint Center, which it leased back to API.
