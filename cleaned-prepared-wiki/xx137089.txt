Four Loko is a line of alcoholic beverages sold by Phusion Projects of Chicago, Illinois, USA. Phusion operates as Drink Four Brewing Company. Four Loko, the company's most popular beverage, debuted in the United States market in 2005 and is available in 48 states, and in Canada, Puerto Rico, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Honduras, and Europe. The name "Four" is derived from the original energy drink's four main ingredients: alcohol, caffeine, taurine, and guarana.
Four branded products have been the object of legal, ethical, and health concerns related to the company allegedly marketing them to the underaged and the danger of combining alcohol and caffeine. After the beverage was banned in several states, a product reintroduction in December 2010 removed caffeine, taurine, and guarana as ingredients, and the malt beverage is no longer marketed as an energy drink.

The FDA also stated that concerns have been raised that caffeine can mask some of the sensory cues individuals might normally rely on to determine their level of intoxication. Warning letters were issued to each of the four companies requiring them to provide to the FDA in writing within 15 days of the specific steps the firms will be taking.
The four companies that received the warning letter were:
