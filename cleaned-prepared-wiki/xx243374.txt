History

Prior to the construction of Green Oak Village Place, the only shopping mall in Brighton was Brighton Mall, a 20-store complex originally anchored by A&P and Grant City, which was demolished in 1996 for big box stores, including Marshalls and Best Buy.
Following the construction of several new homes in the area, as well as increase in traffic along US-23 and Interstate 96,
Three of Green Oak Village Place's anchors — DSW Shoe Warehouse, Dick's Sporting Goods and Old Navy — were the first stores to open, doing so in mid-2006.
