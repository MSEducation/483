Early years

Tim Chaisson is a member of the Chaisson family, who are prominent in the music scene of Prince Edward Island.  Though he had been playing many instruments since he was a child, Chaisson began his professional career at the age of 14 when he was asked to join Celtic/contemporary band Kindle with his two brothers and three cousins as their bassist.  He was the youngest member of the group, touring from 2000 to 2005.

Solo career

At the age of 15, Chaisson embarked on a solo career locally, and released his first solo album, Timothy Chaisson, which mainly focused on traditional songs.  In 2004, he released his second independent album, where Chaisson was able to showcase his songwriting and instrumental abilities.  This album, Something Acoustic, was a mixture of traditional and original songs as well as traditional fiddle tunes.  Chaisson later recorded his album, Even, which featured 10 original songs. It features Chaisson's instrumental abilities playing acoustic and electric guitars, bass, drums, piano, mandolin, fiddle and vocals. Released in 2006, it received many awards and nominations.  Later in 2011, he was chosen as Musical Director for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's highly publicized Royal Visit to PEI.
