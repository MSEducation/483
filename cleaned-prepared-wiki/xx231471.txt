Musical style

Deadlock incorporate melodic death metal as well as some melodic metalcore aspects. What makes Deadlock different is the combination of death growls by vocalist Johannes Prem and the clean vocals of Sabine Scherer. Also included in their sound are techno sections, often used as intros but sometimes used as a whole breakdown section, where a complete genre change takes place.  Their 2013 album, The Arsonist, features 8 string guitars tuned to low F, clearly influenced from the popular djent movement.
