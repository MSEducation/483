Borley Church is the parish church in Borley, Essex. Like the former Borley Rectory it is said to be haunted. The church is notable also for its topiary walk and a large monument covering the graves of Sir Edward Waldegrave (a member of Mary I of England's privy council) and his wife.

Description and history

The church (dedication unknown) is a small building of stone; the nave may date to the 11th century. Later renovations have resulted in the mainly perpendicular style of the mid-14th to 16th centuries, still visible in the chancel and the western tower. The church as it now stands consists of chancel, nave, south porch and a crenellated western tower containing bells, with a topiary walk leading to the porch.
Not long after 1545 the manor was granted to Sir Edward Waldegrave (knighted in 1553 at the coronation of Queen Mary, died in the Tower of London on 1 September 1561) by Henry VIII. After the death of Edward, he was admitted to Queen Mary's privy council and granted the manor of Navestock, where he moved the family seat.
The chancel contains a monument to John Durham of Norfolk.
The glebe was  in the mid-19th century; in both 1821 and 1831 the parish had 195 inhabitants.

Claims of haunting

The church is claimed to be haunted although with much less activity than the former Borley Rectory. Alleged paranormal activity includes "phantom organ music, ghostly chanting, and the ghost of a nun moving about the churchyard".
