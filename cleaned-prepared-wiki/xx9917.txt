Paul Leroy Robeson ( April 9, 1898 – January 23, 1976) was an African-American singer and actor who became involved with the Civil Rights Movement. At Rutgers University, he was an outstanding football player, then had an international career in singing, as well as acting in theater and movies. He became politically involved in response to the Spanish Civil War, fascism, and social injustices. His advocacy of anti-imperialism, affiliation with communism, and criticism of the United States government caused him to be blacklisted during the McCarthy era. Ill health forced him into retirement from his career. He remained until his death an advocate of the political stances he took.
Robeson won an academic scholarship to Rutgers University, where he became a football All-American and the class valedictorian. He received his LL.B. from Columbia Law School, while playing in the National Football League (NFL). At Columbia, he sang and acted in off-campus productions; and, after graduating, he became a participant in the Harlem Renaissance with performances in The Emperor Jones and All God's Chillun Got Wings. Robeson initiated his international artistic résumé with a theatrical role in Great Britain, settling in London for the next several years with his wife Essie.
Robeson next appeared as Othello at the Savoy Theatre before becoming an international cinematic star through roles in Show Boat and Sanders of the River. He became increasingly attuned towards the sufferings of other cultures and peoples. Acting against advice, which warned of his economic ruin if he became politically active, he set aside his theatrical career to advocate the cause of the Republican forces of the Spanish Civil War. He then became active in the Council on African Affairs (CAA).
During World War II, he supported America's war efforts and won accolades for his portrayal of Othello on Broadway. However, his history of supporting pro-Soviet policies brought scrutiny from the FBI. After the war ended, the CAA was placed on the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations and Robeson was investigated during the age of McCarthyism. Due to his decision not to recant his public advocacy of pro-Soviet policies, he was denied a passport by the U.S. State Department, and his income, consequently, plummeted. He moved to Harlem and published a periodical critical of United States policies. His right to travel was eventually restored by Kent v. Dulles, but his health broke down. He retired and he lived out the remaining years of his life privately in Philadelphia.

Early life

Childhood (1898–1915)

Paul Robeson was born in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1898, to Reverend William Drew Robeson and Maria Louisa Bustill.; cf. Boyle and Bunie: 18, Duberman: 4–5. His mother was from a prominent Quaker family of mixed ancestry: African, Anglo-American, and Lenape. Robeson, 2001: 4–5; Boyle and Bunie: 10–12. His father, William, whose family traced their ancestry to the Igbo people of present-day Nigeria, escaped from a plantation in his teensRobeson 2001: 4, 337–338; cf. Boyle and Bunie: 4, Duberman: 4, Brown: 9–10. and eventually became the minister of Princeton's Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church in 1881. Robeson 2001: 4–5, Duberman: 4–6, Brown: 17, 26. Robeson had three brothers: William Drew, Jr. (born 1881), Reeve (born c. 1887), and Ben (born c. 1893); and one sister, Marian (born c. 1895). Boyle and Bunie: 18, Brown: 21.
In 1900, a disagreement between William and white financial supporters of Witherspoon arose with apparent racial undertones,Duberman: 6–7; cf. Robeson, 2001: 5–6, Boyle and Bunie: 18–20. which were prevalent in Princeton. Duberman: 12. William, who had the support of his entirely black congregation, resigned in 1901. Duberman: 6–9, Boyle and Bunie: 18–20, Brown: 26. The loss of his position forced him to work menial jobs. Boyle and Bunie: 21, Robeson 2001: 6–7, Brown: 28. Three years later when Robeson was six, his mother, who was nearly blind, died in a house fire. Duberman: 8, Robeson 2001: 7–8, Brown: 25–29; Robeson 1958: 7. Eventually, William became financially incapable of providing a house for himself and his children still living at home, Ben and Paul, so they moved into the attic of a store in Westfield, New Jersey. Duberman: 9, Boyle and Bunie: 27–29.
William found a stable parsonage at the St. Thomas A. M. E. Zion in 1910,Duberman: 9–10; cf. Brown: 39, Robeson 2001: 13–14. where Robeson would fill in for his father during sermons when he was called away. Duberman: 30, Brown: 46–47. In 1912, Robeson attended Somerville High School, Somerville, New Jersey,Boyle and Bunie: 37–38; cf. Duberman: 12, Brown: 49–51. where he performed in Julius Caesar, Othello, sang in the chorus, and excelled in football, basketball, baseball and track. Boyle and Bunie: 34–36, Brown: 43, 46, 48–49. His athletic dominance elicited racial taunts which he ignored. Robeson: 16, Duberman: 13–16, Brown: 46–47. Prior to his graduation, he won a statewide academic contest for a scholarship to Rutgers. Brown: 54–55, Duberman: 17, Robeson 2001: 17–18; contra. The dispute is over whether it was a one-year or four-year scholarship. Robeson Found Emphasis to Win Too Great in College Football 1926-03-13  He took a summer job as a waiter in Narragansett Pier, Rhode Island, where he befriended Fritz Pollard, later to be the first African-American coach in the National Football League. Boyle and Bunie: 40–41, Robeson: 18–19, Brown: 53–54, 65, Carroll: 58.

Rutgers University (1915–1919)

In late 1915, Robeson became the third African-American student ever enrolled at Rutgers, and the only one at the time. Brown: 60, 64, Gilliam: 15, Robeson 2001: 20. He tried out for the Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team,Boyle and Bunie: 45–49; cf. Duberman: 19, 24, Brown: 60, 65. and his resolve to make the squad was tested as his teammates engaged in unwarranted and excessive play, arguably precipitated by racism. Boyle and Bunie: 49–50, Brown: 61–63. The coach, Foster Sanford, decided he had overcome the provocation and announced that he had made the team.; cf. Boyle and Bunie: 49–50, Duberman: 20–21, Robeson 2001: 22–23.
Robeson joined the debate team and sang off-campus for spending money,Duberman: 24; cf. Boyle and Bunie: 54, Brown: 71, Robeson 2001: 28, 31–32. and on-campus with the Glee Club informally, as membership required attending all-white mixers. He also joined the other collegiate athletic teams. Boyle and Bunie: 54, Brown: 70, Robeson 2001: 35. As a sophomore, amidst Rutgers' sesquicentennial celebration, he was benched when a Southern team refused to take the field, because the Scarlet Knights had fielded a Negro, Robeson. Duberman: 22–23, Boyle and Bunie: 59–60, Robeson 2001: 27, Pitt: 42.
After a standout junior year of football,Duberman: 22, 573; cf. Robeson 2001: 29–30, Brown: 74–82, Boyle and Bunie: 65–66. he was recognized in The Crisis for his athletic, academic, and singing talents.; cf. Marable: 171? At what should have been a high point of his life,Boyle and Bunie: 68. his father fell grievously ill. Duberman: 25, Boyle and Bunie: 68–69, Brown: 85–87. Robeson took the sole responsibility in caring for him, shuttling between Rutgers and Somerville. His father, who was the "glory of  boyhood years"Robeson 1958: 6. soon died, and at Rutgers, Robeson expounded on the incongruity of African-Americans fighting to protect America in World War I then, contemporaneously, being bereft of the same opportunities in the United States as Whites. Boyle and Bunie 68–69, Brown: 86–87, Robeson 2001: 33.
He finished university with four annual oratorical triumphsDuberman: 24; cf. Boyle and Bunie: 69, 74, 437, Robeson 2001: 35. and varsity letters in multiple sports.; cf. Boyle and Bunie: 76, Duberman: 26–27, Brown: 95, Robeson 2001: 36–39.

Columbia Law School (1919–1923)

Boyle and Bunie: 82, Robeson 2001: 44, Carroll: 140–141. where he joined the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Gilliam: 25, Boyle and Bunie: 53; Duberman: 41. However, Robeson felt uncomfortable at NYUBoyle and Bunie: 82. and moved to Harlem and transferred to Columbia Law School in February 1920. Boyle and Bunie: 82, Brown: 107–108. Already known in the black community for his singing,Boyle and Bunie: 143; cf. Robeson 2001: 45. he was selected to perform at the dedication of the Harlem YWCA.; cf. Robeson 1958: 2. He began dating Eslanda "Essie" GoodeDuberman: 34–35, 37–38; Boyle and Bunie: 87–89, Robeson 2001: 46–48. and after her coaxing,Duberman: 43. he gave his theatrical debut as Simon in Ridgely Torrence's Simon of Cyrene. Robeson 2001: 48–49; cf. Boyle and Bunie: 89, 104, Who's Who New York Times 1924-05-11 After a year of courtship, they were married in August 1921. Duberman: 39–41, cf. Boyle and Bunie: 88–89, 94, Brown: 119.
He was recruited by Pollard to play for the NFL's Akron Pros while Robeson continued his law studies. Akron Pros 1920 by Bob Carrol, John Carroll p. 147–148, Robeson 2001: 53. In the spring, Robeson postponed schoolBoyle and Bunie: 104–105. to portray Jim in Mary Hoyt Wiborg's Taboo.; cf. Boyle and Bunie: 100–105, Review of Taboo, Duberman: 43. He then sang in a chorus in an Off-Broadway production of Shuffle AlongWintz: 6–8; cf. Duberman 44–45, Robeson 2001: 57–59, Boyle and Bunie: 98–100. before he joined Taboo in Britain. Brown: 120, Robeson 2001: 57–59, Boyle: 100–101. The play was adapted by Mrs. Patrick Campbell to highlight his singing. Brown: 120, Duberman: 47–48, 50, Robeson 2001: 59, 63–64. After the play ended, he befriended Lawrence Brown,Brown: 120–121; cf. Boyle and Bunie: 105–106. a classically trained musician,Boyle and Bunie: 139. before returning to Columbia while playing for the NFL's Milwaukee Badgers.

Boyle and Bunie: 111–113, Robeson 2001: 71, Brown: 122.

Theatrical ascension and ideological transformation (1923–1939)

Harlem Renaissance (1923–1927)

Robeson worked briefly as a   lawyer, but he renounced a career in law due to extant racism. Essie financially supported them and they frequented the social functions at the future Schomburg Center. History, Schomburg Unit Listed as Landmark: Spawning Ground of Talent 40 Seats Are Not Enough Plans for a Museum In December, he landed the lead role of Jim in Eugene O'Neill's All God's Chillun Got Wings,Robeson 2001: 73; cf. Duberman: 52–55, Boyle and Bunie: 111, 116–117. which culminated with Jim metaphorically consummating his marriage with his white wife by symbolically emasculating himself. Chillun's opening was postponed while a nationwide debate occurred over its plot.; cf. Duberman: 57–59, Boyle and Bunie: 118–121, Gillam: 32–33.
Chillun's delay led to a revival of The Emperor Jones with Robeson as Brutus, a role pioneered by Charles Sidney Gilpin. Gillam: 36–37, Duberman: 53, 57–59, 61–62, Boyle and Bunie: 90–91, 122–123. The role terrified and galvanized Robeson, as it was practically a 90-minute soliloquy. Reviews declared him an unequivocal success.; cf. Robeson, Paul (1925–01). "An Actor's Wanderings and Hopes". The Messenger 7 (1): 32.
The success of his acting placed him in elite social circlesGillam: 38–40; cf. Duberman: 68–71, 76, Sampson: 9. and his ascension to fame, which was forcefully aided by Essie,Boyle and Bunie: 142–143; cf. "I Owe My Success To My Wife," Says Paul Robeson, Star In O'Neill's Drama had occurred at a startling pace. Essie's ambition for Robeson was a startling dichotomy to his insouciance. Boyle and Bunie: 149, 152. She quit her job, became his agent, and negotiated his first movie role in a silent race film directed by Oscar Micheaux, Body and Soul. To support a charity for single mothers, he headlined a concert singing spirituals. cf. Robeson to Sing  Over Radio 1925-04-08
Lawrence Brown, who had become renowned while touring as a pianist with gospel singer Roland Hayes, stumbled upon Robeson in Harlem. The two ad-libbed a set of spirituals, with Robeson as lead and Brown as accompanist. This so enthralled them that they booked Provincetown Playhouse for a concert. Gilliam: 41–42, Boyle and Bunie: 140, Robeson 2001: 85–86. The pair's rendition of African-American folk songs and spirituals was captivating,; cf. Paul Robeson, Lawrence Brown Score Big New York Success With Negro Songs, Music, Duberman: 80–81. and Victor Records signed Robeson to a contract.Duberman: 82, 86, Boyle and Bunie: 149, Robeson 2001: 93, Robeson on Victor 1925-09-16
The Robesons went to London for a revival of Jones, before spending the rest of the fall on holiday on the French Riviera, socializing with Gertrude Stein and Claude McKay. Duberman: 83, 88–98, Boyle and Bunie: 161–167, Robeson 2001: 95–97. Robeson and Brown performed a series of concert tours in America from January 1926 until May 1927. Duberman: 98–106, Gillam: 47–49. During a hiatus in New York, Robeson learned that Essie was several months pregnant. Boyle and Bunie: 184. Paul Jr. was born while Robeson and Brown toured Europe. Duberman: 106 Boyle and Bunie: 184. Essie experienced complications from the birth,Duberman: 110; cf. Robeson 2001: 147, Gillam: 49. and by mid-December, her health had deteriorated dramatically. Ignoring Essie's objections, her mother wired Robeson and he immediately returned to her bedside. Duberman: 112, Robeson 2001: 148. Essie completely recovered after a few months.

Show Boat, Othello, and marriage difficulties (1928–1932)

Robeson played "Joe" in the London production of the American musical Show Boat, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.; cf. Seton 1978: 30; cf. Robeson 2001: 155, Boyle and Bunie: ? Show Boat continued for 350 performances and, as of 2001, it remained the Royal's most profitable venture. The Robesons bought a home in Hampstead. Robeson 2001: 153–156, Gilliam: 52, Duberman: 118. He reflected on his life in his diary and wrote that it was all part of a "higher plan" and "God watches over me and guides me. He's with me and lets me fight my own battles and hopes I'll win."Duberman: 126–127. However, an incident at the Savoy Grill, wherein he was refused seating, sparked him to issue a press release portraying the insult which subsequently became a matter of public debate.
Essie had learned early in their marriage that Robeson had been involved in extramarital affairs, but she tolerated them.; cf. Gilliam: 57, Boyle and Bunie: 159–160, Robeson 2001: 100–101. However, when she discovered that he was having another affair, she unfavorably altered the characterization of him in his biography,Robeson 2001: 163–165. and defamed him by describing him with "negative racial stereotypes". Boyle and Bunie: 230–234, Duberman: 139–140. Despite her uncovering of this tryst, there was no public evidence that their relationship had soured. Robeson 2001: 165–166. In early 1930, they both appeared in the experimental classic Borderline,Nollen: 24; cf. Duberman: 129–130, Boyle and Bunie: 221–223. and then returned to the West End for his starring role in Shakespeare's Othello, opposite Peggy Ashcroft as Desdemona.
Robeson became the first black actor cast as Othello in Britain since Ira Aldridge. Swindall 2011: 23, Robeson 2001: 166. The production received mixed reviews which pointed out Robeson's "highly civilized quality  grand style."Nollen: 29; cf. Gilliam: 60, Boyle and Bunie: 226–229. Robeson stated the best way to diminish the oppression African Americans faced was for his artistic work to be an example of what "men of my colour" could accomplish rather than to "be a propagandist and make speeches and write articles about what they call the Colour Question."Robeson 2001: 176–177; cf. Nollen: 29.
After Essie's discovery of Robeson's affair with Ashcroft, she decided to seek a divorce and they split up. Boyle and Bunie: 238–240, 257; cf. Gilliam: 62–64, Duberman: 140–144. Robeson returned to Broadway as Joe in the 1932 revival of Show Boat, to critical and popular acclaim.; cf. Boyle and Bunie: 253–254, Duberman: 161, Robeson 2001: 192–193. Subsequently, he received, with immense pride, an honorary master's degree from Rutgers. Boyle and Bunie: 258–259, Robeson 2001: 132, 194. Thereabout, his former football coach, Foster Sanford, advised him that divorcing Essie and marrying Ashcroft would do irreparable damage to his reputation. Duberman: 145; cf. Robeson 2001: 182. Ashcroft and Robeson's relationship ended in 1932,Duberman: 162–163; cf. Boyle and Bunie: 262–263, Robeson 2001: 194–196. following which Robeson and Essie reconciled, although their relationship was permanently scarred. Boyle and Bunie: 267–268, Duberman: 166.

Ideological awakening (1933–1937)

Robeson played a theatrical role, virtually gratis, as Joe in "Chillun" in 1933 for several weeksBoyle and Bunie: 271–274; cf. Duberman: 167, Robeson 2001: 204. before returning to the United States for a starring role in a motion picture, which was "a feat not repeated for more than two decades in the U.S."Nollen: 41–42; cf. Robeson 2001: 207; Duberman: 168–169. as Brutus in the film The Emperor Jones. His acting in "Jones" was well received and "Jones" became the first film starring an African American. On the film set, he rejected any slight to his dignity, despite the widespread Jim Crow atmosphere in the United States. Duberman: 167–168. Post-production, he returned to England and publicly criticized African Americans' rejection of their own culture.; cf. Boyle and Bunie: 284–285; cf. Duberman: 169–170. The New York Amsterdam News retorted that his comments had made a "jolly well ,"Boyle and Bunie: 285–286. however, he afterwards declared that he would reject any offers to perform European opera because the music had no connection to his heritage.
In early 1934, Robeson enrolled in the School of Oriental and African Studies to study over 20 different languages. His "sudden interest" in African history and its impact on cultureThe rationale for Robeson's sudden interest in African history is viewed as inexplicable by one of his biographers (Martin Bauml Duberman p. ?), and no biographers have stated an explanation, for what Duberman terms as a "sudden interest"; cf. Cameron: p. 285. coincided with his essay "I Want to be African", wherein he wrote of his desire to embrace his ancestry. He undertook the role of Bosambo in the movie Sanders of the River,Nollen: 45. which he felt would render a realistic view of colonial African culture.; cf. Duberman: 184–185, 628–629. and, on his arrival in the Soviet Union, he expounded on race and what he felt in Moscow, where he said, "Here I am not a Negro but a human being for the first time in my life ... I walk in full human dignity."Foner 1978: 94–96 (Smith, Vern (1935-01-15). "'I am at Home,' Says Robeson at Reception in Soviet Union", Daily Worker).
When Sanders of the River was released in 1935, it made him an international movie star. However, the stereotypical portrayal of a colonial AfricanNollen: 53; cf. Duberman 178–182. was seen as embarrassing to his stature as an artist; cf. Richards, Jeffrey: 18.

Spanish Civil War and the Moscow Trials (1937–1939)

Robeson believed that the struggle against fascism during the Spanish Civil War was a turning point in his life and transformed him into a political activist. Robeson 1981: 38, Duberman: 220. In 1937, he used his concert performances to advocate the Republican cause and the war's refugees. Boyle and Bunie: 375–378. He permanently modified his renditions of Ol' Man River from a tragic "song of resignation with a hint of protest implied"; cf. Brown: 77, Robeson 2010: 372.
After an invitation from J. B. S. Haldane,Beeves: 356. he traveled to Spain in 1938 because he believed in the International Brigades's cause. He visited the battlefrontBeevor: 356; cf. Eby: 279–280, Landis: 245–246. and provided a morale boost to the Republicans at a time when their victory was unlikely. Back in England, he hosted Jawaharlal Nehru to support Indian independence, whereat Nehru expounded on imperialism's affiliation with Fascism.; cf. Nollen: 122. With Max Yergan, and the CAA, Robeson became an advocate in the aspirations of African colonialists for political independence. Von Eschen: ?

World War II, the Broadway Othello, Political Activism, and McCarthyism (1939–1957)

World War II and the Broadway Othello (1939–1945)

Furthermore, Native Land was labeled by the FBI as communist propaganda. FBI 100-25857, New York, December 8, 1942. After an appearance in Tales of Manhattan, a production that he felt was "very offensive to my people", he announced that he would no longer act in films because of the demeaning roles available to blackDuberman: 259–261.
Robeson participated in benefit concerts on behalf of the war effort and at a concert at the Polo Grounds, he met two emissaries from the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, Solomon Mikhoels and Itzik FefferLustiger: 125–127. Subsequently, Robeson reprised his role of Othello at the Shubert Theatre in 1943,Othello at IBDB. and became the first African American to play the role with a white supporting cast on Broadway. Contemporaneously, he addressed a meeting with Kenesaw Mountain Landis in a failed attempt to convince him to admit black players to Major League Baseball. He toured North America with Othello until 1945,Duberman: 295. and subsequently, his political efforts with the CAA to get colonial powers to discontinue their exploitation of Africa were short-circuited by the United Nations.

Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations (1946–1949)

After the lynchings of four African Americans, Robeson met with President Truman and admonished Truman that if he did not enact legislation to end lynching, "the Negroes will defend themselves".
About this time, Robeson's belief that trade unionism was crucial to civil rights became a mainstay of his political beliefs as he became proponent of the union activist Revels Cayton. Robeson was later called before the Tenney Committee where he responded to questions about his affiliation with Communist Party (CPUSA) by testifying that he was not a member of the CPUSA. Nevertheless, two organizations with which Robeson was intimately involved, the Civil Rights Congress (CRC)
In 1948, Robeson was preeminent in Henry A. Wallace's bid for the President of the United States,Duberman: 324. during which Robeson traveled to the Deep South, at risk to his own life, to campaign for him. In the ensuing year, Robeson was forced to go overseas to work because his concert performances were canceled at the FBI's behest. While on tour, he spoke at the World Peace Council,Foner 1978: 197–198. whereat, his speech was publicly reported as equating America with a Fascist stateRobeson 2010: 142–143; cf. Duberman: 342–345, 687.—a depiction which he flatly denied. Foner 1978: 197–198, Seton 1958: 179, Interview with Paul Robeson, Jnr. Nevertheless, the speech publicly attributed to him was a catalyst for his becoming an enemy of mainstream America."Studs Terkel, Paul Robeson – Speak of Me As I Am, BBC, 1998" Robeson refused to subjugate himself to public criticism when he advocated in favor of twelve defendants, including his long-time friend, Benjamin J. Davis, Jr. charged during the Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders.
Robeson traveled to Moscow in June, and was unable to find Itzik Feffer. He let Soviet authorities know that he wanted to see him. Reluctant to lose Robeson as a propagandist for the Soviet Union,Lustiger: 210–211. the Soviets brought Feffer from prison to him. Feffer told him that Mikhoels had been murdered, and he would be summarily executed.  To protect the Soviet Union's reputation, and to keep the right wing of the United States from gaining the moral high ground, Robeson denied that any persecution existed in the Soviet Union,Duberman: 353–354. and kept the meeting secret for the rest of his life, except from his son.
In order to isolate Robeson politically, Days later, the announcement of a concert headlined by Robeson in New York provoked the local press to decry the use of their community to support subversivesDuberman: 364; cf: Robeson 1981: 181. and the Peekskill Riots ensued. Robeson 1981: 181. Contemporaneously, criticism of Robeson became, even among liberals, de rigueur.

Blacklisted (1950–1955)

A book reviewed in early 1950 as "the most complete record on college football"LA Times: Jan 1, 1950, p. ? failed to list Robeson as ever having played on the Rutgers teamWalsh: 689. and as ever having been an All-American.

Health breakdown (1961–1963)

During his treatment at the Priory, Robeson was being monitored by the British MI5.; cf. Western Mail,  Both intelligence services were well aware of Robeson's suicidal state of mind. An FBI memo described Robeson's debilitated condition, remarking that his "death would be much publicized" and would be used for Communist propaganda, necessitating continued surveillance.

In August 1963, disturbed about his treatment, friends had him transferred to the Buch Clinic in East Berlin. Given psychotherapy and less medication, his physicians found him still "completely without initiative" and they expressed "doubt and anger" about the "high level of barbiturates and ECT" that had been administered in London.
