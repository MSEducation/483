The International Churches of Christ (ICOC)

In the mid 1980s, McKean became leader of both Boston and Crossroads Movements, eventually splitting from mainstream Churches of Christ, to become the International Church of Christ, or ICOC.
The movement was first recognized as an independent religious group in 1992 when John Vaughn, a church growth specialist at Fuller Theological Seminary, listed them as a separate entity. Foster. Into All Nations: A History of the International Churches of Christ. IPI, 2005 TIME magazine ran a full-page story on the movement in 1992 calling them "one of the world's fastest-growing and most innovative bands of Bible thumpers" that had grown into "a global empire of 103 congregations from California to Cairo with total Sunday attendance of 50,000", and which also raised concerns about authoritarian leadership, pressure placed on members, and whether the group should be considered a cult.
A formal break was made from the mainline Churches of Christ in 1993 when the movement organized under the name "International Churches of Christ."Leroy Garrett, The Stone-Campbell Movement: The Story of the American Restoration Movement, College Press, 2002, ISBN 0-89900-909-3, ISBN 978-0-89900-909-4, 573 pages

Resignation from the International Churches of Christ

Beginning in the late 1990s, McKean's moral authority as the leader of the movement came into question. Expectations for continued numerical growth and the pressure to sacrifice financially to support missionary efforts took its toll. Added to this was the loss of local leaders to new planting projects. In some areas, decreases in membership began to occur. "The International Church of Christ: A Historical Overview." Leaven (Pepperdine University), 2010: 1-5 At the same time, realization was growing that the accumulated cost of his leadership style and associated advantages were outweighing the cost. In 2001, McKean was asked by a group of long-standing elders in the ICoC to take a sabbatical from overall leadership of the ICoC.  On 12 November 2001, McKean wrote that he had decided to take a sabbatical from his role as the leader of the International Churches of Christ. He issued the following statement:

His resignation was acknowledged by a short letter from the elders the following day.
After a period leading an ICOC congregation in Portland, Oregon, he started a new movement separated from the ICOC. This movement was named International Christian Church by him. "The Biography of Kip McKean" kipmckean. June 18, 2012 The period following McKean's resignation from leadership and departure was followed by a number of changes in the ICoC. Some changes were initiated from the ICoC leaders themselves and others forced through members who brought to light underlying concerns and discontent with the ICoC's leadership.
