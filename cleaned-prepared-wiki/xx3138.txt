Practical comparisons

All words ever spoken

A popular expression claims that "all words ever spoken by human beings" could be stored in approximately 5 exabytes of data
Earlier studies from the University of California, Berkeley, estimated that by the end of 1999, the sum of human-produced information (including all audio, video recordings, and text/books) was about 12 exabytes of data.

100,000 Libraries of Congress

The content of Library of Congress is commonly estimated to hold 10 terabytes of data in all printed material.  Recent estimates of the size including audio, video, and digital materials is from 3 petabytes to 20 petabytes.
Therefore, one exabyte could hold a hundred thousand times the printed material, or 500 to 3,000 times all content of the Library of Congress.
