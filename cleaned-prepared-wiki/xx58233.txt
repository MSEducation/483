E is a high performance theorem prover for full first-order logic with equality. It is based on the equational superposition calculus and uses a purely equational paradigm. It has been integrated into other theorem provers and it has been among the best-placed systems in several theorem proving competitions. E is developed by Stephan Schulz, originally in the Automated Reasoning Group at TU Munich.

System

The system is based on the equational superposition calculus. In contrast to most other current provers, the implementation actually uses a purely equational paradigm, and simulates non-equational inferences via appropriate equality inferences. Significant innovations include shared term rewriting (where many possible equational simplifications are carried out in a single operation),
E is implemented in C and portable to most UNIX dialects and the Cygwin environment.
It is available under the GNU GPL.

Competitions

The prover has consistently performed well in the CADE ATP System Competition, winning the CNF/MIX category in 2000 and finishing among the top systems ever since.

Applications

E has been integrated into several other theorem provers. It is, with Vampire and SPASS, at the core of Isabelle's Sledgehammer strategy.
Applications of E include reasoning on large ontologies,
