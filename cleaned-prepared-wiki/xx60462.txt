A Perfect Circle is an American rock supergroup formed in 1999 by guitarist Billy Howerdel and Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan. The original incarnation of the band also included Paz Lenchantin on bass, Troy Van Leeuwen on guitar, and Tim Alexander on drums, with Josh Freese being the band's primary drummer after the band's initial round of touring prior to their first album. The latest lineup features Puscifer and Ashes Divide bassist Matt McJunkins and former guitarist for The Smashing Pumpkins, James Iha. Despite having a varied cast since inception, the stylistic content of the songs has remained consistent with Howerdel as composer, and Keenan penning the lyrics and melodies.
A Perfect Circle has released three albums: Mer de Noms (2000),  Thirteenth Step (2003) and Emotive (2004). A CD-DVD set, Amotion, was released alongside Emotive released and contains thirteen music videos in addition to a number of song remixes created by Danny Lohner, Robert Del Naja and other artists.
The band went into hiatus in 2004. Since then band members have worked on other projects, the most notable being Keenan's work on Tool's 2006 album 10,000 Days and Howerdel's album Keep Telling Myself It's Alright under Ashes Divide, his name for his solo work. The two announced they had reformed to work on new material in late 2008, although the band was not publicly active until 2010, when the band began touring again.
On November 19, 2013, the band released a greatest hits album entitled Three Sixty, which contains one new song, "By and Down", and on November 26, 2013, the band released a box set entitled A Perfect Circle Live: Featuring Stone and Echo. While the band continues to work on new material since its reformation, few details exist regarding a timetable or form of the release.

History

Mer de Noms (1999–2001)

A Perfect Circle was conceived by Billy Howerdel, a former guitar technician for Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins, Fishbone and Tool. Howerdel met singer Maynard James Keenan in 1992 when Tool was opening for Fishbone, and the two became friends. Three years later, Keenan offered Howerdel, who was looking for lodging, a room in his North Hollywood home. This provided Howerdel the opportunity to play demos of his music for Keenan. Pleased with what he heard, Keenan remarked, "I can hear myself singing songs." Alexander was soon replaced with session drummer and member of The Vandals and former member of Guns N' Roses, Josh Freese, but Alexander's performance can still be heard on the album version of the song "The Hollow".
The band's debut album, Mer de Noms (French for "Sea of Names"), was released on May 23, 2000. The album is distinctive in that it is the highest ever debut for a rock band, selling over 188,000 copies in its first week, and appearing at number four on the Billboard 200.
Howerdel had been working on some of the music, including tracks "The Hollow" and "Breña", as far back as 1988. Mer de Noms went certified platinum by the RIAA on October 31, 2000, while the band was on tour.
The album produced three singles: "Judith", "3 Libras", and "The Hollow". "Judith" is named after and is about Keenan's mother, who suffered a stroke and was left paralyzed when he was 11.
In the album review by Rolling Stone, Pat Blashill wrote that Keenan "added an almost operatic angst to Howerdel's songs" and concluded that "A Perfect Circle sound like a desperate dream of what rock used to be. Maybe that's the point."Blashill, Pat (June 8, 2000). Mer de Noms Album Review. Rolling Stone. Retrieved on 2008-12-12. Allmusic's review expressed that "there's little question that the addicting combination of Keenan's aching voice and Howerdel's accomplished songs and production skills made for one of 2000's best splashes in whatever was left of 'modern rock'."Raggett, Ned. Review: Mer de Noms. Allmusic. Retrieved on 2008-12-12.

Thirteenth Step (2002–2003)

During the recording, release and tour for Tool's album Lateralus, from 2000 to 2002 the band experienced a considerable amount of downtime. This made the band extremely dynamic in terms of its members. During the recording of Thirteenth Step, A Perfect Circle lost two of its members, Paz Lenchantin & Troy Van Leeuwen. Lenchantin left to join Billy Corgan's new band Zwan in April 2002,
The band released their second album, Thirteenth Step, on September 16, 2003. With the new album came a new sound. While Mer de Noms had a heavier, deeper sound, Thirteenth Step was more melodic and straightforward.
The album received mostly positive reviews. Allmusic's review stated the album "is the sound of a musical and lyrical maturity that normally doesn't occur until a band's third or fourth albums". Review: Thirteenth Step . Allmusic. Retrieved on 2008-12-12. The review by Yahoo! Music expressed that the album "has its share of anthemic moments, but the real passion spills over in the moody overtures where menacing danger feels seconds away".O'Connor, Rob (September 22, 2003). Album Review: Thirteenth Step. Yahoo! Music. Retrieved on 2008-12-12. Rolling Stone wrote in an attempt to summarize the album that it "sounds more like the dusky thrum of Disintegration-era Cure than it does any of the members' previous bands", and continued "Thirteenth Step doesn't bludgeon listeners into submission—it lulls them with droning guitars, dub-deep bass and simmering vocals."Cherry, Robert (October 2, 2003). Thirteenth Step Album Review. Rolling Stone. Retrieved on 2008-12-12.

eMOTIVe and aMOTION (2004)

A third album, Emotive, was released on November 2, 2004 (election day in the United States), and contains covers of anti-war songs by artists such as John Lennon ("Imagine") and Joni Mitchell ("Fiddle and the Drum"). Emotive was recorded with current and former members of the band, but is mostly the work of Keenan and Howerdel. The single "Passive" was adapted from the defunct band Tapeworm, a project composed mainly of Keenan, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, and Danny Lohner. "Passive" first appeared under the title "Vacant" at a show played by A Perfect Circle in Portland, Oregon on January 31, 2001, notably, without the blessing of Reznor to play the song. The single "Passive" can also be heard in the 2005 movie Constantine when John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) enters Papa Midnite's office in his club in the second half of the movie. The song "Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums" is used in the teaser trailer for The Fantastic Four as well as the trailer for The Taking of Pelham 123.
The album received mixed reviews. An Allmusic review stated the album "falls flat and fails to raise the bar set so high by the quality of their previous two releases". Emotive Review. Allmusic.

Retrieved on 2008-12-12. as did The Guardian which stated "cover versions are often hobbled by the artist's inability to step outside the original and find a fresh perspective, but some of these treatments verge on the visionary."Sweeting, Adam (October 29, 2004). Emotive Review. The Guardian. Retrieved on 2008-12-12. Ken Micallef of Yahoo! Music wrote "the band builds on the power of the previous Thirteenth Step, applying hypnotic arrangements, brooding melodies, and droning rhythms to a collection that sounds absurd on its surface, but is woven together by A Perfect Circle's heavy and dark-lidded instrumental approach."Micallef, Ken (November 4, 2004). Album Review: Emotive. Yahoo! Music. Retrieved on 2008-12-12.
On November 16, 2004, the CD-DVD set entitled Amotion was released. The DVD contains music videos for six singles; previously unreleased videos for other songs, including three contest runner-up videos and the winning video for "Blue"; and three trailers for Bikini Bandits. The CD is composed entirely of remixes of the singles from Mer de Noms and Thirteenth Step. The songs were retooled by Danny Lohner, Joshua Eustis, Massive Attack, and James Iha among others.

Hiatus (2005–2009)

The future of A Perfect Circle remained uncertain and wobbled between "done for now"
Both Howerdel and Keenan discussed the future of the band in various mediums from 2006 through 2008. During a February 2006 interview with Rock Hard, Keenan remarked, "I think APC is over. ... We pushed this project as far as it could go, and I see ourselves playing again together only in a few years to make one or two songs, nothing more." Despite these comments, in an interview with Revolver the following month, Keenan discussed the other members of A Perfect Circle's recent activities and also hinted at the possibility of a reunion. During the interview, Keenan stated:
 news continued to arrive through Keenan about the existence of the band. In Puscifer's May 2008 newsletter, Keenan remarked on the status of A Perfect Circle: "As many of you may have heard, Billy and I are engaged in our own little projects for the moment. His is called Ashes Divide and mine is called Puscifer... This is simply more."

Return and touring (2010–2012)

As early as December 2008, Keenan had announced that he and Howerdel had been writing new music for A Perfect Circle,(December 9, 2008). "New Music From A PERFECT CIRCLE On The Way?". blabbermouth. Retrieved on 2008-12-12. although it wasn't until over year and a half later, mid-2010, when various band members began teasing a return on respective Twitter accounts, that the band actually became active. This led up to a September announcement of tour dates in which they would be playing the entirety of each of their three albums at each concert, with one album being played per night.
There have been conflicting reports as to what degree the band will be releasing new material. Keenan's initial thoughts in 2008 referred to focusing on "one or two songs at a time", which would most likely be released digitally via the internet, rather than a full album release on compact disc. Keenan jokingly mentioned that CDs have become "plastic discs that no one cares about anymore." In June 2010, Keenan stated that he was working on a fourth LP for A Perfect Circle. "Tool Weigh Unleashing New Tracks on Summer Tour". Rolling Stone. However, when asked about an album again in August, his response focused on single songs again, stating that he's "... Might be more going back to the singles. The days of the singles market makes a lot more sense at this point." and that "We have no label, so neither Billy nor I are really into kicking down hundreds of thousands of dollars to record a record and put it out." Howerdel, in a September 2010 interview, said that he had been working on demos for the last three to four years, and he presents them to Keenan, who decides which he would like to develop into A Perfect Circle songs, or leave for Howerdel to develop into Ashes Divide songs. "Reconnecting with A Perfect Circle". antiquiet. No new songs were played at the initial reunion concerts, as no songs were finished yet, and the band was still trying to "remind everybody" who they are at these concerts.  The possibility of a live concert DVD was discussed, but ultimately not released. "A Perfect Circle: The Gun Shy Interview". gunshyassassin.
In addition the initial 2010 concerts, the band also played a few songs on live television programs Jimmy Kimmel Live!"A Perfect Circle Performs On 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' (Video)". blabbermouth. and Last Call with Carson Daly in October and November 2010 respectively.
The band continued touring into 2011, stopping in 24 cities and performing at events such as  Rock on the Range Festival in Columbus, Ohio on May 21 and 22, 2011,
The band continued to allude to working on new music throughout 2011, referring to the process as "Slow but steady."
After the 2011 tour, Keenan said that new material still was not ready, and that for the time, he and Howerdel were turning back to their respective side projects, Puscifer and Ashes Divide. During this time, in October 2012, Freese left the band without any intentions of returning.com - Drummer Josh Freese Exits A Perfect Circle
The band returned to touring in 2013, playing Soundwave Music Festival In February 2013, Keenan again stated that a new album was still "currently off the table", due to his continued work with Puscifer, and Howerdel's commitment to working on a second yet-to-be-released Ashes Divide album.com/maynard-james-keenan-tool-will-not-release-new-album-2013/ He shortly after appended that they are still working on new material, but its still mostly just "jamming" and working on bits and pieces, not entire songs.spin.com/articles/puscifer-bohemian-rhapsody-donkey-punch-the-night-ep-stream-maynard-james-keenan/

Compilations and future releases (2013-present)

In September 2013, it was announced that the band would release two separate compilations in November 2013. The first is a greatest hits album entitled Three Sixty, containing one new song, "By and Down", the second a box set entitled A Perfect Circle Live: Featuring Stone and Echo.rollingstone.
In regards to future material from the band, Keenan stated "Of course, there's always writing going on constantly. It's just stuff that's not quite sitting right yet, so you don't know about it".yahoo.html In November 2013, Howerdel stated that "there are fully developed songs without lyrics and melody..." He did concede that this could change depending on Keenan's stance on music, and that Keenan prefers smaller releases, while Howerdel prefers the form of a full album.
