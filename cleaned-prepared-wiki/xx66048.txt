Uniform civil code in India is the debate to replace the existing personal laws, which are based on the scriptures and customs of each major religious community in the country, with a common set governing every citizen. These laws are distinguished from public law and cover marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption and maintenance.  Article 44 of the Directive Principles in India sets the implementation of a uniform civil code throughout the country as duty of the State. It became one of the most controversial topics in contemporary Indian politics during the Shah Bano case in 1985, where a divorced Muslim woman sought maintenance from her husband. The debate then focused on the Muslim Personal Law, which is partially based on the Sharia law and remains unreformed since 1937, permitting unilateral divorce and polygamy in the country. The demand for it was first put forward by women activists in the beginning of the twentieth century, with the objective of women's rights, equality and secularism in India. The Bano case made it a politicised public issue focused on identity politics—by means of attacking specific religious minorities versus protecting its cultural identity. The Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janta Party and the Left support it while the Congress Party and All India Muslim Personal Law Board oppose it.
The personal laws were first framed during the British Raj, mainly for Hindu and Muslim citizens. The Hindu orthodox law discriminated against women by depriving them of inheritance, remarriage and divorce. The British feared opposition from community leaders and refrained from interfering with this domestic sphere of the Indian citizens. Till Independence in 1947, a few law reforms were passed to improve their condition, especially that of Hindu widows. In 1956, the Indian Parliament passed Hindu Code Bill amidst significant opposition. Though a demand for a uniform civil code was made by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, his supporters and women activists, they had to finally accept the compromise of it being added to the Directive Principles of the Indian Constitution. The Shah Bano case resulted in her being granted maintenance under the All India Criminal Code. Amidst the political debate that followed, the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act 1986 was passed, which exempted Muslims from the Criminal Code—a setback to family law uniformity.

British India (1858–1947)

The debate for a uniform civil code dates back to the colonial period in India. The Lex Loci Report of October 1840 emphasised the importance and necessity of uniformity in codification of Indian law, relating to crimes, evidences and contract but it recommended that personal laws of Hindus and Muslims should be kept outside such codification.
Throughout the country, there was a variation in preference for scriptural or customary laws because in many Hindu and Muslim communities, these were sometimes at conflict;
The Hindu law discriminated against women by depriving them of inheritance, remarriage and divorce. Their condition, especially that of Hindu widows and daughters, was poor due to this and other prevalent customs.

Post-colonial (1947–1985)

The Indian Parliament discussed the report of the Hindu law committee during the 1948–1951 and 1951–1954 sessions. The first Prime Minister of the Indian republic, Jawaharlal Nehru, his supporters and women members wanted a uniform civil code to be implemented.
The Hindu bill itself received much criticism and the main provisions opposed were those concerning monogamy, divorce, abolition of coparcenaries (women inheriting a shared title) and inheritance to daughters. The first President of the country, Rajendra Prasad, opposed these reforms; others included the Congress party president, Vallabhbhai Patel, a few senior members and the Hindu fundamentalist parties. The fundamentalists called it "anti-Hindu" and "anti-Indian"; as a delaying tactic, they demanded a uniform civil code.
The Hindu code bill failed to control the prevalent gender discrimination. The laws on divorce were framed giving both partners equal voice but majority of its implementation involved those initiated by men. Since the Act applied only to Hindus, women from the other communities remained subordinated. For instance, Muslim women, under Sharia law, could not inherit agricultural land.
While the period 1950–1985 can be summed up as one where Muslim Personal Laws were exempted from legislation and they remained unchanged, it can also be seen as a period where there were secular avenues opened to Muslims, the biggest of which was the passage of the Special Marriage Act, 1954. The idea behind this act was to give everyone in India the ability to marry outside the personal law, in what we would call a civil marriage. As usual the law applied to all of India, except Jammu and Kashmir. In many respects, the act was almost identical to the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, which gives some idea as to how secularised the law regarding Hindus had become. The Special Marriage Act allowed Muslims to marry under it and thereby retain the protections, generally beneficial to Muslim women, that could not be found in the personal law. Under the act polygamy was illegal, and inheritance and succession would be governed by the Indian Succession Act, rather than the respective Muslim Personal Law. Divorce also would be governed by the secular law, and maintenance of a divorced wife would be along the lines set down in the civil law.

Shah Bano case (1985)

After the passing of the Hindu Code bill, the personal laws in India had now, as its two major areas of application, the common Indian citizens and the Muslim community, whose laws were kept away from any reforms.
The Shah Bano case soon became nationwide political issue and a widely-debated controversy.
An independent Muslim parliament member proposed a bill to protect their personal law in the parliament. The Congress reversed its previous position and supported this bill while the Hindu right, the Left, Muslim liberals and women's organisations strongly opposed it. The Muslim Women's (Protection of Rights on Divorce) was passed in 1986, which made Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code inapplicable to Muslim women. The debate now centred on the divinity of their personal law. A Muslim member of parliament made a claim emphasising the importance of the cultural community over national by saying that only a Muslim judge could intercede in such cases.

Dispute post-1985

In twenty-first century Indian politics, the debate for a uniform civil code, with its diverse implications, is one of the most controversial issues in the country.

Goa

Goa is the only state in India which has Uniform Civil Code. In India, as a whole, there are religion-specific civil codes that separately govern adherents of different religions. Goa is an exception to that rule, in that a single secular  code/law governs all Goans, irrespective of religion, ethnicity or linguistic affiliation.

Special Marriage Act, 1954

Though in India every religion has its own personal laws, Indian constitution provides an opportunity for the people of any religion to get married out side their religious laws through Special Marriage Act, 1954. Any person, irrespective of religion or Nationality i.e. Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs,Christian, Parsis, or Jewish can perform marriage under the Special Marriage Act, 1954.
