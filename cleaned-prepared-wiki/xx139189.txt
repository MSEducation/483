Format

House Hunters was originally hosted/narrated by Suzanne Whang. In 2008, the show was narrated by Colette Whitaker. The current narrator, Andromeda Dunker, began voicing the show in 2009. The program follows individuals, couples, or families searching for a new home with the assistance of a realtor. Each broadcast features three properties, one of which is selected by the prospective buyer, whose offer generally is accepted by the seller. In the final moments of the show, the new owner provides a tour of the house, revealing what changes and/or improvements if any were made after moving in. 
Although the TV format is that of a reality show, producers may recruit buyers who are already in escrow with the house of their choice. One participant in the show stated, "The show is not really a reality show. You have to already own the house that gets picked at the end of the show.  But the other houses in the show are actually the other houses we considered buying."Interview with Ted Prosser, Owner of Into The Mystic, Coral Bay at On-StJohn.
In early seasons of the series, prices and locations never were mentioned. The viewing audience is now privy to where each property is located along with the amount being asked and paid for each property.

Car Hunters

The House Hunters format was also used in Car Hunters, a series of commercials in Fall 2010 for Chevrolet in which a prospective buyer test drives a Chevrolet Cruze or Chevrolet Traverse and two other cars, always choosing the Chevrolet vehicle. Conducted by an independent research firm, the shopper was not informed until the end that Car Hunters was actually a commercial for Chevrolet. The series of ads, which carried the same look as House Hunters (apart from using a blue color scheme instead of yellow), debuted on HGTV in September 2010 as part of a sweepstakes sponsored by HGTV and Chevrolet.
