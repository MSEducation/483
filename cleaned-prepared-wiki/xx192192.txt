Betting scandal

After the 21 August 2010 Canterbury match against the North Queensland Cowboys Tandy became embroiled in a betting scandal. The Totalisator Agency Board (TAB) announced that 95 per cent of bets placed on the first scoring play of this match were for the unusual option of a Cowboys penalty goal. Tandy is alleged to have placed some of these bets himself,  and then taken action in the match to allow the opposing side to score a penalty goal. Tandy gave away possession to the Cowboys in the opening moments of the match by knocking on, and then gave away a penalty. These actions put the Cowboys in a position where a penalty goal was a likely outcome. However, the Cowboys decided on an attacking option and scored a try instead.
Tandy strongly denied the accusations of deliberately giving away possession and a penalty to allow the exotic option on the bets to be successful. Despite this, he was arrested on 2 February 2011 He received an intensive correction order for six months. It required: community service, supervision and curfew, but he could have been jailed for 2 years.
Tandy was found to be guilty of manipulating the first scoring point of the game on 6 October 2011. 
Tandy received a lifetime ban from NRL rugby league over the match fixing.
