James Gillespie Blaine (January 31, 1830January 27, 1893) was an American Republican politician who served as United States Representative, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, U.S. Senator from Maine, and twice as Secretary of State.  He was nominated for President in 1884, but was narrowly defeated by Democrat Grover Cleveland.  Blaine was one of the late 19th century's leading Republicans and champion of the moderate reformist faction of the party known as the "Half-Breeds".
Blaine was born in the western Pennsylvania town of West Brownsville and after college moved to Maine where he became a newspaper editor.  Nicknamed "the Magnetic Man," he was a charismatic speaker in an era that prized oratory.  He began his political career as an early supporter of Abraham Lincoln and the Union war effort in the American Civil War.  In Reconstruction, Blaine was a supporter of black suffrage, but opposed some of the more coercive measures of the Radical Republicans.  Initially a protectionist, he later worked for a reduction in the tariff and an expansion of American trade with foreign countries.  Railroad promotion and construction were important issues in his time, and as a result of his interest and support Blaine was widely suspected of corruption in the awarding of railroad charters; these allegations plagued his 1884 presidential candidacy.
As Secretary of State, Blaine was a transitional figure, marking the end of an isolationist era in foreign policy and foreshadowing the rise of the American Century that would begin with the Spanish-American War.  His efforts at expanding the United States' trade and influence began the shift to a more active American foreign policy.  Blaine was a pioneer of tariff reciprocity and urged greater involvement in Latin American affairs.  An expansionist, Blaine's policies would lead in less than a decade to the establishment of the United States' acquisition of Pacific colonies and dominance of the Caribbean.

Early life

Family and childhood

James G. Blaine was born January 31, 1830 in West Brownsville, Pennsylvania, the third child of Ephraim Lyon Blaine and his wife Maria Gillespie Blaine.
Blaine's biographers describe his childhood as "harmonious," and note that the boy took an early interest in history and literature.

Teacher and publisher

In 1848, Blaine was hired as a professor of mathematics and ancient languages at the Western Military Institute in Georgetown, Kentucky.
Philadelphia's law libraries gave Blaine the chance to at last begin to study the law, but in 1853 he received a more tempting offer: to become editor and co-owner of the Kennebec Journal.

Maine politics

Blaine's career as a Republican newspaperman led naturally to involvement in Republican party politics.  In 1856, he was selected as a delegate to the first Republican National Convention.
In 1858, Blaine ran for a seat in the Maine House of Representatives, and was elected.

House of Representatives, 1863–1876

Elected to the House

Blaine had considered running for the United States House of Representatives from Maine's 4th district in 1860, but agreed to step aside when Anson P. Morrill, a former governor, announced his interest in the seat.
Under the Congressional calendar of the 1860s, members of the 38th United States Congress, elected in November 1862, did not begin their work until December 1863; by the time Blaine finally took his seat that month, the Union had turned the tide in the war with victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg.

Reconstruction and impeachment

Blaine was reelected in 1864 and, when the 39th Congress assembled in December 1865, the main issue was the Reconstruction of the defeated Confederate States.

Monetary policy

Continuing his earlier battle with Stevens, Blaine led the fight in Congress for a strong dollar.  After the issuance of 150 million dollars in greenbacks—non-gold-backed currency—the value of the dollar stood at a low ebb.

Speaker of the House

With Speaker Schuyler Colfax's election to the Vice Presidency in 1868, the leadership of the House became vacant.
Republicans remained in control of the House in the 42nd and 43rd Congresses, and Blaine was reelected as Speaker at the start of both of them, for a total term of six years in the Speaker's chair.  His popularity continued to grow, and Republicans dissatisfied with Grant mentioned Blaine as a potential candidate for president in 1872.
Although he supported a general amnesty for former Confederates, Blaine opposed extending it to include Jefferson Davis, and he cooperated with Grant in helping to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1875 in response to increased violence and disenfranchisement of blacks in the South.

Blaine Amendment

The 1874 House elections produced a Democratic majority for the 44th Congress, and  Blaine's time as Speaker was at an end.
The proposed amendment codified the church-state separation Blaine and Grant were promoting, stating that:

The effect was to prohibit the use of public funds by any religious school, although it did not advance Grant's other aim of requiring states to provide public education to all children.

1876 presidential election

Mulligan letters

Blaine entered the 1876 presidential campaign as the favorite, but his chances were almost immediately harmed by the emergence of a scandal.  When the investigating committee recessed, Blaine met with Mulligan in his hotel room; what transpired between the men is unknown, but Blaine left with the letters and refused to turn them over to the committee.
Blaine took his case to the House floor, proclaiming his innocence and calling the investigation a partisan attack by Southern Democrats, revenge for his exclusion of Jefferson Davis from the amnesty bill of the previous year.

Plumed Knight

Though he was damaged by the Mulligan letters, Blaine entered the convention as the favorite.  Blaine's was nominated by Illinois orator Robert G. Ingersoll in what became a famous speech:

The speech was a success and Ingersoll's appellation of "plumed knight" remained a nickname for Blaine for years to come.
Blaine received the news at his home in Washington and telegraphed Hayes his congratulations.

United States Senate, 1876–1881

Blaine was appointed to the Senate on July 10, 1876, but did not begin his duties there until the Senate convened in December of that year.
On monetary issues, Blaine continued the advocacy for a strong dollar that he had begun as a Representative.
His time in the Senate allowed Blaine to develop his foreign policy ideas.  He advocated expansion of the American navy and merchant marine, which had been in decline since the Civil War.

1880 presidential election

Hayes had announced early in his presidency that he would not seek another term, which meant that the contest for the Republican nomination in 1880 was open to all challengers—including Blaine.
Garfield placated the Stalwarts by endorsing Chester A. Arthur of New York, a Conkling loyalist, as nominee for vice president, but it was to Blaine and his delegates that Garfield owed his nomination.

Secretary of State, 1881

Foreign policy initiatives

Blaine saw presiding over the cabinet as a chance to preside over the Washington social scene, as well, and soon ordered construction of a new, larger home near Dupont Circle.

Garfield's assassination

On July 2, 1881, Blaine and Garfield were walking through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington when Garfield was shot by an assassin, Charles J. Guiteau.

Private life

Blaine began the year 1882 without a political office for the first time since 1859.

1884 presidential election

Nomination

In the months leading up to the 1884 convention, Blaine was once more considered the favorite for the nomination, but President Arthur was contemplating a run for election in his own right.
William H. West of Ohio nominated Blaine with an enthusiastic speech and after the first ballot, Blaine led the count with 334½ votes.

Campaign against Cleveland

The Democrats held their convention in Chicago the following month and nominated Governor Grover Cleveland of New York.  Cleveland's time on the national scene was brief, but Democrats hoped that his reputation as a reformer and an opponent of corruption would attract Republicans dissatisfied with Blaine and his reputation for scandal.
The campaign focused on the candidates' personalities, as each candidate's supporters cast aspersions on their opponents. Cleveland's supporters rehashed the old allegations from the Mulligan letters that Blaine had corruptly influenced legislation in favor of railroads, later profiting on the sale of bonds he owned in both companies.
To counter Cleveland's image of superior morality, Republicans discovered reports that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child while he was a lawyer in Buffalo, New York, and chanted "Ma, Ma, where's my Pa?". (To which the Democrats, after Cleveland had been elected, appended: "Gone to the White House, Ha! Ha! Ha!")
Both candidates believed that the states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election.

Party leader in exile

Blaine accepted his narrow defeat and spent most of the next year working on the second volume of Twenty Years of Congress.
Blaine and his wife and daughters sailed for Europe in June 1887, visiting England, Ireland, Germany, France, Austria-Hungary, and finally Scotland, where they stayed at the summer home of Andrew Carnegie.
As state conventions drew nearer, Blaine announced that he would not be a candidate.

Secretary of State, 1889–1892

Harrison had developed his foreign policy based largely on Blaine's ideas, and at the start of his term, Harrison and Blaine had very similar views on the United States' place in the world.

Pacific diplomacy

Blaine and Harrison wished to see American power and trade expanded across the Pacific and were especially interested in securing rights to harbors in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Pago Pago, Samoa.
In Hawaii, Blaine worked to bind the kingdom more closely to the United States and to avoid its becoming a British protectorate.

Latin America and reciprocity

Soon after taking office, Blaine revived his old idea of an international conference of western hemisphere nations.  Blaine said publicly that his only interest was in "annexation of trade," not annexation of territory, but privately he wrote to Harrison of a desire for some territorial enlargement of the United States:

Congress was not as enthusiastic about a customs union as Blaine and Harrison were, but tariff reciprocity provisions were ultimately included in the McKinley Tariff that reduced duties on some inter-American trade.
In 1891, a diplomatic crisis arose in Chile that drove a wedge between Harrison and Blaine.  The American minister to Chile, Patrick Egan, a political friend of Blaine's, granted asylum to Chileans who were seeking refuge from the Chilean Civil War.

Relations with European powers

Blaine's earliest expressions in the foreign policy sphere were those of a reactionary Anglophobe, but by the end of his career his relationship with the United Kingdom had become more moderate and nuanced.  Ultimately, the nations signed the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911, which outlawed open-water seal hunting.
At the same time as the Pribilof Islands dispute, an outbreak of mob violence in New Orleans became an international incident.  After New Orleans police chief David Hennessy led a crackdown against local mafiosi, he was assassinated on October 14, 1890.

Retirement, death, and legacy

Blaine had always believed his health to be fragile, and by the time he joined Harrison's cabinet he truly was unwell.
Harrison was unpopular with the party and the country, and many of Blaine's old supporters encouraged him to run for the nomination.
Blaine spent the summer of 1892 at his Bar Harbor cottage, and did not involve himself in the presidential campaign other than to make a single speech in New York in October.
A towering figure in the Republican party of his day, Blaine fell into obscurity fairly soon after his death. Although several authors studied Blaine's foreign policy career, including Edward P. Crapol's 2000 work, Muzzey's was the last full-scale biography of the man until Neil Rolde's 2006 book. Historian R. Hal Williams is currently working on a new biography of Blaine, tentatively titled James G. Blaine: A Life in Politics.edu/history/faculty/williams. Accessed March 6, 2013.
