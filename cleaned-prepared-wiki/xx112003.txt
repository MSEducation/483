The team was composed of goalkeeper Ghenadie Gariuc and outfield players including Alexandru Golban, Cornel Popov, Ruslan Raşcu, Serghei Coşciug, Cornel Gafton, Veaceslav Titov, Alexandru Tracalov. The club's initial aim was to compete in the Moldovan "A" Division (second tier).  Dacia debuted in this league during the 2000-01 season, while Gabriel Stati took over as President in Autumn 2000. The club came 4th in its first season before being promoted to the top-flight Moldovan National Division the following season.

Dacia were subsequently eliminated by Germans Schalke 04, losing both legs (1-0 and 2-1).
Before the 2003-04 season, former Dacia player and second-team coach Emil Caras took over as head coach, leading the side to 5th place in the league and a Moldovan Cup semi-final defeat against fellow Chişinău-based side Zimbru. Durfing that cup-run, Dacia recorded the victory in its history, 9-0 against FC Floreşti.
The 2004-05 season saw Dacia qualify for the UEFA Cup for the first time after a third-place finish in the league. The Wolves also finished as runners-up in the Moldova Cup after a dramatic loss to Nistru Otaci. Dacia were knocked out of the 2005-06 UEFA Cup in the first round against the Swiss Challenge League team FC Vaduz, losing 2-0 away but winning the home leg 1-0 though Vladimir Jăpălău.
