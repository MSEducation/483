Michael Noonan (born 21 May 1943) is an Irish Fine Gael politician and has been the Minister for Finance since March 2011. He has been a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Limerick East and later Limerick City constituencies since 1981.
Noonan has been a minister in every Fine Gael-led government since 1982, serving in the cabinets of Garret FitzGerald, John Bruton and Enda Kenny. During these terms of office he held the positions of Minister for Justice, Minister for Industry and Commerce and Minister for Health. When Fine Gael lost power after the 1997 general election Noonan remained an important figure in the party, taking over as spokesperson on finance.
He succeeded John Bruton as party leader in 2001, however, he resigned following Fine Gael's disastrous showing at the 2002 general election. After eight years as a backbencher, during which time he served as chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny appointed Noonan to his front bench in 2010 as spokesperson on finance.

Early life

The son of the local school teacher, Noonan was born in Loughill, County Limerick in 1943.  He was educated at the local national school and St. Patrick's secondary school in Glin before studying primary school teaching at St. Patrick's College of Education in Drumcondra.  He subsequently completed a BA and H. in English and Economics at University College Dublin and began work as a secondary school teacher in Dublin.  Noonan developed an interest in politics from his mother, whose family had been heavily involved in Fine Gael at local level in Limerick, and joined the Dublin branch of the party after graduating from university.  He returned to Limerick in the late 1960s and took up a teaching post at Crescent College.  Here he continued his involvement in politics, canvassing for the Fine Gael candidate, James O'Higgins, in the Limerick East by-election in 1968 caused by the death of Donogh O'Malley.

Personal life

Noonan married Florence Knightley, a native of Castlemaine, County Kerry and a primary school teacher, in 1969. They had three sons: Tim, John and Michael, and two daughters: Orla and Deirdre. In May 2010, Noonan appeared on RTÉ's The Frontline to talk about his wife's battle with Alzheimer's disease.
Florence Noonan died on 23 February 2012 of pneumonia.

Political career

Having been involved in the local Fine Gael organisation in Limerick since the late 1960s, Noonan first held political office in 1974 when he was elected to Limerick County Council.  Having built up a local profile he contested the 1981 general election for the party and secured a seat in Limerick East.  Upon taking his Dáil seat Noonan became a full-time politician, giving up his teaching post and resigning his seat on the county council.  In spite of Fine Gael forming a coalition government with the Labour Party, Noonan, as a first time TD, remained on the backbenches.

Ministerial positions (1982–86)

Fine Gael lost power following the first general election in early 1982, however, Noonan subsequently joined the party's new front bench as spokesperson on Education.  A second general election in late 1982 following the collapse of the Fianna Fáil government saw another Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition come to power.  Just eighteen months after entering the Dáil Noonan was appointed to the highly sensitive position of Minister for Justice.  After a few weeks in office he revealed the illegal phone-tapping of journalists' phones, carried out by the Fianna Fáil administration that preceded it in power.  That government had authorised illegal phone tapping of the journalists Geraldine Kennedy, Bruce ArnoldIrish Examiner, Telephone bugs that toppled a TaoiseachIrish Times obituary for Charles HaugheyIrish Independent, Full picture of The Boss can only be drawn with shadows by Bruce Arnold and Vincent Browne.  Noonan quickly earned a reputation as a tough and uncompromising minister, regarded by many as one the best incumbents of the position.  His successes included the introduction of a new Criminal Justice Bill while also bringing in reforms in the Garda Síochána, the courts and the prison service and the facing down of a difficult prison officers' dispute.  He also dealt with the wording of the controversial abortion referendum in 1983.  Noonan, however, also presided over the justice ministry when inmates in an overcrowded and understaffed Spike Island prison set fire to the building.
A cabinet reshuffle in 1986 saw Noonan demoted to the position of Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Following the withdrawal of the Labour Party from government in 1987, Noonan also briefly took over as Minister for Energy.

In opposition (1987–94)

Fine Gael lost power at the 1987 general election and were confined to the opposition benches.  The new Fine Gael leader, Alan Dukes, appointed Noonan to the senior position of front bench spokesperson on Finance and the Public Service.  The party did poorly under Dukes and he was replaced by John Bruton in 1990.  Noonan was retained on the new front bench, however, he was demoted to the position of spokesperson on Transport, Energy and Communications.  In 1991 he returned to local politics as a member of Limerick County Council, serving again until 1994.  Noonan's period in opposition often saw him at odds with his party leader.  Not long after his demotion as finance spokesperson he announced that he would be taking "positions of leadership" on a wide range of important issues.  This was seen as a veiled threat to John Bruton's leadership, with Noonan positioning himself as an alternative party leader.  In 1994 a number of Fine Gael TDs attempted to oust Bruton as party leader following poor showings in opinion polls.  Noonan aligned himself with the rebels and stated that he would stand for the leadership should Bruton be defeated.  The latter survived as leader and Noonan resigned from the front bench.

Minister for Health (1994–97)

In 1994, the 'Rainbow Coalition' was formed and Noonan became Minister for Health. The department was embroiled in a scandal at the time regarding blood products contaminated with Hepatitis C virus, caused by the negligence of the Blood Transfusion Service Board. Noonan consistently held an authoritarian line on the case of Bridget McCole and would not budge on his views, suffering as a result of the scandal.

Leader of Fine Gael

Despite increasing their seats to 54, Fine Gael returned to opposition and Noonan became opposition spokesman for Finance. In 2001, following a series of disastrous opinion polls, Noonan and his colleague, Jim Mitchell, tabled a motion of no confidence in the leader, John Bruton. The motion was successful in ousting Bruton as leader, with Noonan becoming leader of Fine Gael and Leader of the Opposition with Mitchell becoming deputy leader. Noonan avoided requests to be interviewed on TV and radio programmes, including some on RTÉ and Today FM, ahead of the leadership election.
At the 2002 general election Fine Gael had a disastrous result, dropping from 54 seats to 31 and a number of high profile front bench member losses including Alan Dukes, Deirdre Clune, Alan Shatter and deputy leader Jim Mitchell.

Minister for Finance (2011–present)

In July 2010, Noonan was promoted to the Fine Gael Front Bench as spokesperson on Finance.[ref]
 
At the 2011 general election, he was re-elected as a TD for Limerick city receiving 13,291 (30.8% 1st preference) votes.ie On 9 March 2011, he was appointed Minister for Finance
In March 2011, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Europe have backed the Programme for Government and given the coalition the green light to make changes to the terms of the multi-billion euro bailout. After meeting officials from the IMF – including Ireland mission head Ajai Chopra – European Central Bank (ECB) and European Commission (EC), Noonan said it was agreed the terms of the rescue deal would be altered, as long as the financial targets remain the same. "What was being discussed in general terms was our proposal that the conditions and the memorandum of understanding would be changed for alternative conditions which are in the Programme for Government," Noonan said.Terms of bailout 'can be changed'
In July 2011 Noonan speaking after an EU summit on 21 July said that the new deal agreed with euro zone leaders means a second bailout for Ireland is "off the table". The deal will see a reduction in the interest rate on bailout loans to Greece, Ireland and Portugal and follows a 10-hour emergency summit at which euro zone leaders agreed to provide a second international bailout worth €109 billion to Greece. The plan will be funded by euro zone countries, the proceeds of privatisations and the anticipated €12.6 billion benefit of a debt buyback programme. Noonan said a provision in the agreement meant Ireland would not have to go back to markets when the programme ended if the country had not reached its deficit target. "There's a commitment that if countries continue to fulfil the conditions of their programme, the European authorities will continue to supply them with money even when the programme concludes," he said. There would be "little or no easing" of budgetary conditions for this year, but there could be more positive implications in later years.  "I'm afraid we still have to face the music in December," he said.
In November 2011, he said the payment of more than €700 million to Anglo Irish Bank bondholders was "the lesser of two evils".
In February 2013, a deal was reached with the European Central Bank (ECB) in relation to the promissory note used to bail out the former Anglo Irish Bank. Noonan said that the government had achieved its objectives in the negotiations with the ECB, and that the arrangement meant that there would be €1bn less taken from them in terms of taxes and spending cuts up to 2015.
On 15 October 2013, he delivered the budget for 2014.
Following improvements in Ireland's unemployment rate and outlook for growth, the securing of the February 2013 Anglo Irish Bank promissory note deal with the ECB, and Ireland's exit from the EU/IMF/ECB bailout programme and successful return to the bond markets, Noonan was named Europe's best Finance Minister for the previous year in January 2014 by the Financial Times-owned magazine The Banker.
