^ Contrary to popular belief, this was not the first time a member of the ensemble cast did not say "Thank God you're here" at the start of the scene. Lines similar (but not identical) to the title of the show have been used in scenes before, such as "Thank the Lord you're here" and "Thank the gods you're here". However, this was the first time the guest entered the scene without using one of the trademark blue wooden doors. Instead, Matthew Newton was escorted around the back of the set by host Shane Bourne, and he entered through a curtain (which, when viewed from the front, made him look like he was emerging from the car which was half-embedded in the wall of the set). The first words spoken were, "Thank God you're alive!"
+ For this final scene, Ryan Shelton was placed elsewhere (presumably out the back or to the side in the studio) with four kids who looked around 4–5 years old.
