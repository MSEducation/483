Cynthia Koh (born 25 March 1974), also known as Xu Meizhen, is a Singaporean actress and contracted artiste under MediaCorp. She is best known for acting in many Chinese-language television dramas produced by MediaCorp Channel 8.

Early life and education

Born in 1974, Koh has one younger sister. Her father works in the Singapore Civil Defence Force while her mother is a housewife. Koh received her education at Saint Anthony's Canossian Secondary School.

Career

While still enrolled in Singapore Broadcasting Corporation's (now MediaCorp) 10th Drama Artiste Course, Koh started acting at the TV station at the age of 18 in May 1992. This role earned her a nomination in the same category at the Asian Television Awards.
Koh was also part of the cast in three of MediaCorp TV Channel 8's long-running dramas. The 3 long-running dramas include: Holland V (Year 2003, 125 episodes), Portrait of Home (Year 2005, 100 episodes), Kinship (Year 2007, 86 episodes). Koh's role as Fu Baozhu (傅宝珠), a greedy and bossy woman in Portrait of Home granted her another Best Actress nomination in the Star Awards 2005. Unfortunately, she lost the award to veteran Huang Bi Ren.
While filming Mediacorp Channel U's blockbuster drama Show Hand in December 2011, it was reported that Koh delayed an ovarian cyst operation to finish filming the series.
In 2012, after not receiving an award for 15 years at the annual Star Awards, Koh made her comeback, winning her second Top 10 Most Popular Female Artiste Award.
