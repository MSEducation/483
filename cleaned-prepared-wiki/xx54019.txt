Description

Quranic description

The houri have variously been described as being "restraining their glances (chaste)", and much more besides.

Shia scholar description

Still all in accordance with the Quran, the basic fact of the description of this beauty is how good deeds take the ideal order and proportion to physical forms, how they won't fade away over time, and how they accompany their performers.Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi, Masnavi

Etymology

Classical Arabic usage

The word 'ḥūr' (حُور) is the plural of both ʾaḥwar (أحْوَر) (masculine) and ḥawrāʾ (حَوْراء) (feminine) see Lane's Lexicon, p. 302 and Hans Wehr, p. 247
which literally translates as "white-eyed", or persons distinguished by ḥawar (حَوَر), signifying "intense whiteness of the eyeballs and lustrous black of the pupils." (ref: Qamus ), hence 'the purity'. In general, this word implies 'most beautiful eye' irrespective of the person's gender. Thus, it seems that the most appropriate English rendering of the phrase  ḥūr ʿayn might be: "Companions pure, most beautiful of eye."The Message of the Qur'an: A Great Tafsir of the Current Time - Commentary on Various Marriage-Related Phrases from Surat Nisaa and it is applicable to both male and female.Dr. Israr Ahmad Khan, Department of Quran & Sunnah Studies,"Quranic Description of The Paradise", IRKHS, International Islamic University of Malaysia

European usage

The word "houri" has entered into several European languages (French - 1654, English – 1737) with a meaning of a "voluptuous, beautiful, alluring woman". 2000.

Corresponding Hebrew root

In Hebrew the corresponding adjective חיוור hiwer has the same root h-w-r, meaning "pale, whitish". The corresponding word for eye is עין Ayin.

Mention

Quran

The houri are mentioned in several places in the Quran, although in plural no specifics are given as to the number of houries available. Likewise it does not appear from the Quran that they are only women; both sexes are mentioned (although their descriptive qualities are feminine, as alluded to, by the hadiths). They are made available to all believers, not just martyrs.


Here are verses that refer to one's spouse recreated in the hereafter:

There are also verses regarding both genders explicitly:

A verse regarding other companionship:

Hadith

The Islamic traditions (hadith) also mention the houris. The hadith are divided into several types by hadith scholars, and among them, there are groups that have been poorly documented and therefore, are not valid as a reference.

Quran commentators

=Tabari=

Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari mentions that all righteous women, however old and decayed they may have been on earth, will be resurrected as virginal maidens and will, like their male counterparts, remain eternally young in paradise.

=Ibn Kathir=

Ibn Kathir says that the houri "are delightful virgins of comparable age who never had sexual intercourse with anyone, whether from mankind or Jinns, before their husbands."The Delight of Those Who have Taqwa in Paradise - Tafsir. com for Quran 55:56 by commenting, "in the other life, after they became old in this life, they were brought back while virgin, youthful, being delightfully passionate with their husbands, beautiful, kind and cheerful."
Ibn Kathir mentions Muhammad saying that there will be sexual intercourse between a husband and his wife in paradise.

=Qurtubi=

Al-Qurtubi reconciled between the hadith of making the majority of the inhabitants of Hell (Jahannam) and Paradise women by suggesting that the women that will form the majority in hell will be among the sinners that will stay there temporarily and will be brought out of Hell and enter Paradise.

=Razi=

Fakhr al-Din al-Razi comments that the companions of paradise mentioned in Quran 44:54 include "even those toothless old women of yours whom God will resurrect as new beings" and observes that inasmuch as a person's eye reflects his soul more clearly than any other part of the human body in Quran 52: 20.

Physical attributes

In relation to the mention of virgins in Quran, several translators like Hilali-Khan, Arberry, Palmer, Rodwell and Sale have translated book 78, verse 33 to refer to "swelling breasts".
In addition, Ibn Kathir, in his tafsir, writes that book 78, verse 33 in the Quran describes the physical attributes of the women. He says the following about the verse: "This means round breasts. They meant by this that the breasts of these girls will be fully rounded and not sagging, because they will be virgins, equal in age."
Abdullah Yusuf Ali, however, translates Quran 78:33 simply as, "Maidens of equal age" with no reference to physical attributes.Abdullah Yusuf Ali: The Meanings of the Illustrious Qur'an, Alminar Books, Houston, TX, 1997

Alternative interpretation

It should be noted that the original wording in Arabic is  - feminine noun).
Muhammad Asad has said regarding the above verse:
Then he continues:

72 virgins

The idea of 72 virgins in Islam refers to an aspect of paradise. In a collection by Abu `Isa Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi in his Jami` at-TirmidhiVolume IV, chapters on The Features of Heaven as described by the Messenger of Allah, chapter 21: About the Smallest Reward for the People of Heaven, hadith 2687 and also quoted by Ibn Kathir in his Tafsir ibn Kathir of sura 55 it is stated:
However, regarding the above statement Hafiz Salahuddin Yusuf has said: "The narration, which claims that everyone would have seventy-two wives has a weak chain of narrators." There is also a theory that the promise of 72 virgins is a mistranslation from "72 angels".
In the same collection of hadiths, however, the following is judged strong (hasan sahih):

Alternative views

An interpretation of the relevant passages of the Quran is The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran written by Christoph Luxenberg. In respect of this particular point, Luxenberg argues that the relevant passage actually translates to a portrayal of paradise as a lush garden with pooling water and trees with rare fruit, including white raisins (considered to be delicacies at the time that the Quran was written), not virgin maidens.
