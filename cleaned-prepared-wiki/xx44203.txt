]]In March 2011 INXS confirmed they would be returning to the UK and headlining with support from New Zealand band Shihad for an outdoor event on Clapham Common, London on Saturday 11 June called Southern Sounds. The event was an all Australian, New Zealand and South African celebration line up with INXS fronted by J.D. Fortune. Following a large turn out for fellow southern hemisphere rockers Shihad, INXS eventually performed to a small crowd of 800-1000 people. The large capacity big ticket venues of the past replaced by smaller resourced events with poorer quality sound systems in temporary event public spaces did not seem to diminish the band. Strong winds began swaying the single columned speakers through INXS set and the sound quality to festival goers was severely compromised with lead vocals dropping out for large swathes of the gig.
Other acts on the day included Goldfish, I Am Giant, DJ Yoda, Adam Freeland, Krafty Kuts, Freestylers, Eddie Temple Morris, Utah Saints, Rennie Pilgrim, Cape Fear, Woodsy, Rob Diverted, Reveal, and Honeycombe.
INXS toured extensively throughout 2011 with singer J.D. Fortune to support the album Original Sin.
The band released a demo of a song, called "Tiny Summer", in streaming format on their official website in September 2011, along with news that J.D. Fortune had left the band again and that Northern Irish singer-songwriter Ciaran Gribbin would be the band's frontman for their forthcoming tour of Australia, South America and Europe in November & December 2011.com news article; Retrieved 26 September 2011
Ciaran Gribbin and INXS recorded more material; a demo of another song titled "We Are United" appeared on their website. Other new songs were also played live in July 2012 in Australia, such as "Honesty", "Tears of Rain" and "Dancing Like a Flame". "Sugar", an unreleased song from the Jon Stevens era, was brought back too.
On 6 October 2012, INXS were the headline act at the annual charity ball organised by the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondent's Club.org/event/11th-annual-charity-ball-2012 FCCHK.com; Retrieved 5 October 2012
INXS announced during a concert on 11 November 2012, at the newly opened Perth Arena, while supporting Matchbox Twenty, that they would no longer be touring. Kirk Pengilly stated that it was appropriate to finish where they had started 35 years earlier. Jon Farriss admitted, "I'm getting teary", before the band performed their biggest hit, "Need You Tonight".

Television mini series

In 2013, television network, Seven Network Australia, announced that it is producing a mini series focusing on the band's behind the scenes stories, called INXS: Never Tear Us Apart. Band member Tim Farriss is a pre-production consultant on the show.
The mini series commenced production at the end of June 2013, and premiered on 9 February 2014 and the finale aired the following Sunday night (16 February 2014). The mini series rated very highly for both nights and created a renewed interest in the band which translated to a resurgence in sales of their music bringing them once again to the number one position on the Australian popular music charts.

Luke Arnold is cast as Michael Hutchence. Alex Williams plays Kirk Pengilly, newcomer Nicholas Masters plays Tim Farriss, Hugh Sheridan plays bass guitarist Garry Gary Beers, Ido Drent is Jon Farriss and Andy Ryan is Andrew Farriss, Damon Herriman plays band manager CM Murphy and Samantha Jade is cast as Kylie Minogue.

Given the popularity of this TV mini series and subsequent reemergence, there is talk of a Broadway musical and a feature film in the upcoming future.

Influence and recognition

Throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, INXS was a major force in Australian popular music, leading the way into worldwide popularity for several Australian bands. The band worked closely with several other Australian artists, such as Models and ex-patriate New Zealander Jenny Morris, helping to establish their careers. By the mid-1990s, however, their popularity had waned, especially in the US, where their Greatest Hits compilation failed to reach the Top 100.
INXS has won six other ARIA Awards including three for 'Best Group' in 1987, 1989 and 1992. The band has also received three Grammy nominations over their 30-year career. In 2007, The Farriss Brothers were inducted into the West Australian Music Industry Awards Hall of Fame. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), INXS have sold 15 million units in the United States alone, making them the third-highest selling Australian music act in the United States, behind AC/DC and The Bee Gees.RIAA Website Units Sold List retrieved 29 December 2007
