The Big FourThe Great Ocean Liners: Celtic (II) were a quartet of 20,000 ton ocean liners built by Harland & Wolff shipyard for the White Star Line in the early 20th century, completed in 1906:

Origin

In 1899, White Star Line commissioned  in length, although not tonnage. After Thomas Ismay's death the order of Oceanic's sister-ship, Olympic was cancelled. Instead, resources were transferred to the company's new project; to build the grandest fleet of ships that had ever sailed the seas, the 'Big Four'.

History

In 1901, White Star Line ordered a series of four ships that were to be larger than the Great Eastern, terming these ships 'the Big Four'. The four ships were designed to have a tonnage in excess of 20,000 tons and rather than being built for speed and to compete for the Blue Riband, were designed to be more luxurious than their rivals.

At the time she was launched she was the biggest moving object ever built at 21,073 gross tons.
The project was followed by the , at a more economical 17,000 tons, was a virtual sister ship to the Big Four in her layout and dimensions. Lapland was also built by the Harland & Wolff.

Features

The Big Four, with the tonnage of 21,035 - 24,541, the Baltic and the Adriatic were much larger than the first two.

Careers

 

Celtic

Celtic was the first of the Big Four, which entered service in 1901. This was the first ship to exceed the Great Eastern in tonnage. Her career was marked by several accidents. Transformed into an auxiliary cruiser during the First World War, she struck a mine in 1917, killing 17 people. In 1918, she was torpedoed by a German submarine, but was once again afloat. In 1925, she struck another vessel, but neither ship suffered consequences. The incident was repeated with another vessel in 1927. Finally, in 1928, she struck rocks off Cobh and was considered unrecoverable. It took five years for the ship to be completely dismantled.M.S. Celtic (II), Great Ships. Retrieved July 28, 2009

Cedric

The Cedric was put into service in 1903. Her commercial career was divided into transatlantic crossings and cruises. After the sinking of the Titanic, the Cedric was called to New York to bring some of the survivors back to England. During the war, the Cedric was transformed into an auxiliary cruiser. On 29 January 1918 the Cedric collided with, and sank the Canadian Pacific ship Montreal off Morecambe Bay. The Montreal was taken in tow but sank the next day  of the Cunard Line in Queenstown (Cobh) harbour during dense fog. Neither vessel was seriously damaged. She was decommissioned in 1931 and was scrapped the following year.The Great Ocean Liners: Cedric

Baltic

Commissioned in 1904, the Baltic played repeatedly a rescue part at sea. In 1909, she received the SOS from the , after a collision with SS Florida of Lloyd Italiano. In 1912, the night of the sinking of the Titanic, the Baltic received the distress call from the ship, but failed to join. She was also involved in a rescue on 6 December 1929, when she assisted the sinking schooner Northern Light. On 17 February 1933, she sailed for Osaka, Japan where she was scrapped. The two ships appear together on many White Star Line postcards.

Adriatic

The Adriatic, which entered service in 1907, was the largest and most luxurious of the Big Four. Her career was marked by the events known by her sister ships, and she enjoyed a successful commercial career, even having the honor of opening the Southampton - New York route for the White Star Line. Her career was interrupted by the First World War, during which the ship made several voyages as a troop transport. ADRIATIC II, Ayrshire Scotland.
