On November 8 of the same year Hargrove validated the Saints' decision by recovering a fumble from the Carolina Panthers and scoring a 4th-quarter touchdown, sealing a 30-20 victory for the Saints. Besides the rare occurrence of a touchdown scored by a defensive lineman, the game was Panthers coach John Fox's first loss in the Louisiana Superdome and put New Orleans at a season-starting eight wins and no losses for the first time in Saints history.
Hargrove was a restricted free agent after the 2009 season, and it was reported that the Detroit Lions were interesting in signing him, but on April 5, 2010, Hargrove signed the Saints' qualifying tender, and the Saints said he would return to the team in 2010.

Hargrove is currently facing an eight game suspension in conjunction with the scandal, and is alleged to have told NFL officials that Saints coaches had instructed players to lie to league officials about the existence of the program."Hargrove: Williams, Vitt Told Me to Lie About Bounty Program" USA Today, May 7, 2012.

On May 2, 2012, the NFL suspended Hargrove for the first eight games of the 2012 season after naming him as one of the ringleaders of the New Orleans Saints bounty scandal.  According to the league, Hargrove signed a statement admitting his role in the scheme, and also told at least one other player that the Saints had put a bounty on Brett Favre in the 2009 NFC Championship Game.  He'd also lied to investigators when the league initially probed the Saints about the bounty scandal in 2010.
Hargrove was released on August 24, 2012.
On October 9, 2012, four weeks and three days after an internal appeals panel vacated suspensions imposed on Hargrove, Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma, Browns linebacker Scott Fujita and Saints defensive end Will Smith, the league has re-issued the discipline without any changes or reductions, according to a league source. This means that Vilma will be suspended a full season, Fujita will be suspended three games, Smith will be suspended four games, and Hargrove will be suspended eight games.
On December 12, 2012, "In a sharp rebuke to his successor's handling of the NFL's bounty investigation, former commissioner Paul Tagliabue overturned the suspensions of four current and former New Orleans Saints players (including Hargrove) in a case that has preoccupied the league for almost a year."

Eight months after leaving the treatment center, he found himself back in Miami to play in the Super Bowl.
