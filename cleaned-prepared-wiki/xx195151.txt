CATEGORIES: R.S.C. Anderlecht seasons, Belgian football clubs 2008–09 season

RSC Anderlecht competed in the Belgian League and Cup in Season 2008-09. After the 34 league matches, they ended with 77 points tied for first place. As Standard Liège had the same amount of points and the same amount of matches won, test matches were organised to determine the winner. Anderlecht drew 1-1 at home but then lost 1-0 at Standard and thus ended in second position. In the cup they were eliminated in the early rounds by KV Mechelen, who progressed on to lose the final.
Anderlecht also played in the UEFA Champions League, but failed to progress through the qualifying rounds and also did not qualify for the UEFA Cup as they went out too soon. They also played in the Belgian Supercup as cup-winners, but lost, again to Standard.
