The organisms range from a few millimetres to 1.4 metres in length, and are ovoid in outline. They consist of a number of rib-like segments emerging from a central groove or ridge; these ribs interdigitate, producing a glide symmetry.
The segments of Dickinsonia have been described as "pneus", chambers filled with a liquid at higher than ambient pressure, analogous to a quilted air mattress.

Trackway fossils

Arcing trackways of Dickinsonia fossils, termed Epibaion, have been found, but their interpretation too is insecure.  They may be impressions the organism made while it rested on the sediment surface – perhaps by secreting slime in order to form a platform on the underlying microbial mat, or by sitting and dissolving the underlying microbes in order to devour them.[ref]
</ref> They have also been interpreted as "tumble tracks" created by an organism rolling along the sea floor, perhaps  as it was buffeted by currents,<ref name="Retallack2007" />   and as the bases of lichens or "mushrooms arranged in fairy rings".<ref name=Retallack2007/>  However, in some cases these trackway imprints overlap.  Ridges apparently produced by the channelling of sediment in digestive tubes seem to indicate that the trackways do indeed represent feeding traces; the sedimentary disturbance expected of tumbling-induced impressions is not observed.<ref name="Ivantsov2011" /><ref name=Ivantsov2013 />

Body fossil interactions

Halo-like "reaction rims" surround specimens.  Adjacent specimens deform as if to avoid entering their neighbour's halo, suggesting they competed with one another.  No body fossils have been found to overlap.

Internal anatomy

Some spectacular fossils which can be attributed to Dickinsonia appear to preserve internal anatomy, believed to represent a tract that both digested food and distributed it throughout the organism.[ref]

Ecology

The organisms displayed isometric, indeterminate growth – that is to say, they kept growing until they were covered with sediment or otherwise killed.
They spent most, if not all, of their lives with most of their bodies firmly anchored to the sediment, although they may have moved from resting-place to resting-place.  Their mode of anchorage may have been oyster-like concretion, lichen-like rooting with rhizines, or fungus-like attachment to an underground network of hyphæ.
The organisms are preserved in such a way that their resistant parts must have been a sturdy biopolymer (such as keratin) rather than a brittle mineral (such as calcite or a pyritized death mask).

Affinity

Dickinsonia is generally regarded as a member of the Vendobionta — a group of organisms that thrived just before most of the modern multicellular animal phyla appeared in the fossil record. Other Vendobionta such as Yorgia and Marywadea somewhat resemble Dickinsonia, and may be related.
The affinities of Dickinsonia are uncertain. It has been variously interpreted as a jellyfish, coral, polychaete worm, turbellarian, mushroom, xenophyophoran protist, sea anemone, lichen,Retallack, Gregory J.

However, it is possible that Dickinsonia falls into a group of organisms that went extinct before the Cambrian. Its construction is loosely similar to other Ediacaran organisms, and the similarity of their architecture suggests that dickinsoniamorphs may belong in a clade with Charnia and other rangeomorphs.
There is a strong argument that the organism is more derived than a sponge, but less so than a eumetazoan. The organism could clearly move, evidenced by its association with trackways which could only have been produced by feeding. However, it lacks any convincing evidence for a mouth, anus or gut, and appears to have fed by absorption on its bottom surface. The placozoans are simple animals which feed with their soles and are phylogenetically between sponges and eumetazoa; this suggests that Dickinsonia may have been a stem-group placozoan, or somewhere more crownwards than sponges on the eumetazoan stem.

Greg Retallack proposed that some Ediacaran fossils were lichens based on their unusual resistance to post-burial compaction,[ref]
</ref> He proposes that the decay mode of the organisms is most similar to that of leaves, fungi or lichens, unlike soft-bodied animals  which clot and distort as they wilt and decay.<ref name=Retallack2007/> A detailed study of paleosols with ''Dickinsonia'' preserved in life position suggests, according to Retallack, that ''Dickinsonia'' could have lived on dry land.<ref name="Retallack2013">
</ref> The proposal is not widely accepted in the scientific community.<ref name=Waggoner1995>
