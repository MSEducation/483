[[Battlespace]]

CATEGORIES: Command and control, Military strategy, Military terminology

Battlespace is a term used to signify a unified military strategy to integrate and combine armed forces for the military theatre of operations, including air, information, land, sea, and space to achieve military goals.  It includes the environment, factors, and conditions that must be understood to successfully apply combat power, protect the force, or complete the mission. This includes enemy and friendly armed forces, infrastructure, weather, terrain, and the electromagnetic spectrum within the operational areas and areas of interest.Battlespace definition, DoDMilitary Jargon Database

Concept

From 'Battlefield' to 'Battlespace'

Over the last 25 years, the understanding of the military operational environment has transformed from  primarily a time & space driven linear understanding (a battlefield), to a multi-dimensional system of systems understanding (a battlespace). This system of systems understanding implies that managing the battlespace has become more complex, primarily because of the increased importance of the cognitive domain, a direct result of the information age. Today, militaries are expected to understand the effects of their actions on the operational environment as a whole, and not just in the military domain of their operational environment. One popular tool that has been widely implemented to assist intelligence analysts and operational planners with understanding the multi-dimensional actions-effects in the  operational environment is known as PMESII, short for the Political, Military, Economic, Social, Infrastructure, and Information domains of the modern battlespace. It helps military organizations assess how their actions will affect their battlespace from a holistic perspective, and not just from the linear measurement/assessment of military power.Comprehensive Approach Capacity Building: Implementing the Effects Based Approach to Operations

Battlespace agility

Battlespace agility refers to the speed at which the warfighting organization develops and transforms knowledge into actions for desired effects in the battlespace. Essentially it argues that you must be better than the opposition at doing the right actions at the right time and place. Inbuilt into this understanding is that battlespace agility is not just about speed, but it is also about executing the most effective action (ways) in the most efficient manner (means) relative to achieving the desired impact on the system (ends). At all times battlespace agility is dependent on the quality of situational awareness and holistic understanding of the battlespace to  determine the best actions,  a logic that has become a driving force behind a renaissance of interest in the quality of military intelligence. It has been heavily linked to the ability of intelligence analysts and operational planners to understand their battlespace,  and their targets, as networks in order to facilitate a faster, and more accurate shared situational understanding. This in turn increases targeting efficacy and helps retain the overall initiative.dk/FAK/Publikationer/Briefs/Documents/Battlespace%20Agility%20101.dodccrp.pdf but works specifically with an agility concept within the context of warfighting only.dk/FAK/Publikationer/Bøger%20og%20andre%20publikationer/Documents/AgilityandInteroperabilityfor21stCenturyCommandandControl.  It was developed by Dr. William Mitchell from the Dept. of Joint Operations,  Royal Danish Defence College in Copenhagen and has been evaluated in controlled experiments as well as actual warfighting in Helmand,  Afghanistan with a Danish Battlegroup.[ref]


Battlespace awareness

Battlespace awareness (BA) is a practice of military philosophy that is used as a valuable asset by joint component and force commanders, to predict courses of action before employing troops into a prescribed area of operation (AO).  It utilizes the intelligence preparation asset to assist the commander in being 'aware' of recent, current, and near term events in his battlespace.Joint Synthetic Battlespace: Cornerstone for Predictive Battlespace Awareness
It is based around its knowledge and understanding obtained by the an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) system.  It is another methodical concept used to gain information about the operational area—the environment, factors, and conditions, including the status of friendly and adversary forces, neutrals and noncombatants, weather and terrain—that enables timely, relevant, comprehensive and accurate assessments.  It has become an effective concept for conventional and unconventional operations in successfully projecting, or protecting, a military force, and/or completing its mission.DOD - Battlespace Awareness defined

Battlespace digitization

Battlespace digitization is designed to improve military operational effectiveness by integrating weapons platforms, sensor networks, ubiquitous command and control (UC2), intelligence, and network-centric warfare. This military doctrine reflects that in the future, military operations will be merged into joint operations rather than take place in separate battlespaces under the domain of individual armed services.

Battlespace intelligence preparation

=Intelligence preparation=

Intelligence preparation of the battlespace (IPB) is an analytical methodology employed to reduce uncertainties concerning the enemy, environment, and terrain for all types of operations. Intelligence preparation of the battlespace builds an extensive database for each potential area in which a unit may be required to operate.
The database is then analyzed in detail to determine the impact of the enemy, environment and terrain on operations and presents it in graphic form. Intelligence preparation of the battlespace is a continuing process.

=Joint intelligence preparation=

Joint intelligence preparation of the battlespace (JIPB) is the analytical process used by joint intelligence organizations to produce intelligence assessments, estimates and other intelligence products in support of the joint force commander's decision making process. It is a continuous process that includes defining the total battlespace environment; describing the battlespace's effects; evaluating the adversary; and determining and describing adversary potential courses of action.
The process is used to analyze the aerial, terrestrial, maritime/littoral, spatial, electromagnetic, cyberspace, and human dimensions of the environment and to determine an opponent's capabilities to operate in each. JPIB products are used by the joint force and component command staffs in preparing their estimates and are also applied during the analysis and selection of friendly courses of action.

Battlespace measures

=Manoeuvre control=

Manoeuvre control measures are the basic preliminary step in effective clearance of fire support (e.g. artillery, Naval gunfire, and close air support), marked by imaginary boundary lines used by commanders to designate the geographical area for which a particular unit is tactically responsible.  It is usually established on identifiable terrain to help aid in hasty referencing for better lateral advantage in the science of fire support, normally orchestrated by a  higher echelon of the general staff, mainly the operations staff sections.
They are normally designated along terrain features easily recognizable on the ground.  An important point on maneuver control graphics: staffs must be knowledgeable regarding the different maneuver control measures and their impact on clearance of fires. For instance, boundaries are both restrictive and permissive; corridors are restrictive, while routes, axis, and directions of attack are neither.
It should be reminded of the effect on clearance of fires if subordinate maneuver units are not given zones or sectors (i.e. no boundaries established).  Since boundaries serve as both permissive and restrictive measures, the decision not to employ them has profound effects upon timely clearance of fires at the lowest possible level.
The higher echelon may coordinate all clearance of fires short of the Coordinated Fire Line (CFL), a very time-intensive process.  It allows the unit to maneuver successfully and to swiftly and efficiently engage targets.  It requires coordination and clearance only within that organization.

Battlespace shaping

Battlespace shaping is a concept involved in the practice of maneuver warfare that are used for shaping a situation on the battlefield, gaining the military advantage for the commander.  It forecasts the elimination of the enemy's capability by fighting in a coherent manner before deploying determine-sized forces.DEATH FROM ABOVE: I MEF's use of Marine TACAIR during Desert Storm
