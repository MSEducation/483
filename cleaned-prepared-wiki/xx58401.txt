Traditionally, governors called out National Guard units when faced with natural but localized disasters such as blizzards, earthquakes, floods, and forest fires. The president could also federalize them in major disasters that threatened to overwhelm the resources of individual states or communities. According to the National Guard Bureau, "The indigenous skills and capabilities National Guardsmen  to respond to natural disasters are the same skills and capabilities that enable us to successfully respond to potential terrorist threats."Rosenfield and Gross (2007), State and Local Government Support
The Air National Guard's main tool for fighting forest fires is the Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System (MAFFS), which has undergone several updates since its first use in September 1971 by the California ANG's 146th Tactical Airlift Wing and North Carolina ANG's 145th Airlift Wing.  Housed in C-130s,  MAFFS could disperse up to 27,000 pounds—almost 3,000 gallons—of commercial fire retardants or an equivalent amount of water. Newer aircraft like the C-130J carry the MAFFS II, which carry even more fire retardant, can disperse it more rapidly over a wider area, and is easier to recharge after a mission than its predecessor.
Blizzards also created the need for National Guard support. Often both Army Guard and Air Guard units assisted with health and welfare matters, conducted debris removal and power generation, and provided supply and transportation support in connection with snowstorms.  For example, a Christmas-time 2006 blizzard at the airport hub of Denver International Airport closed that facility down for two days. Army and Air Guardsmen took food and water to thousands of travelers trapped there. In the same storm, western Kansas received between 15 and 36 inches of snow with drifts as high as 13 feet. The Air National Guard not only assisted people, but also dropped bales of hay to feed stranded cattle.

=Hurricane Katrina=

On 29 August 2005, the largest natural disaster the Air Guard faced in its 60-year history began when Hurricane Katrina hit the United States Gulf Coast. The most severe damage came from a 30-plus-foot storm surge along the Mississippi coast and the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana and breaks in the levies along a canal in New Orleans. Several weeks later Hurricane Rita devastated portions of western Louisiana and eastern Texas, and then the less severe Hurricane Wilma damaged Florida.
By the time Katrina made landfall, the Air National Guard had mobilized 840 personnel in Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. Although the Air National Guard had a domestic mission to support local authorities in rescue and relief operations following a natural disaster, its utilization for such missions had been limited primarily to a select group of career fields such as civil engineers, medical personnel, and services. In response to Hurricane Katrina, ANG units in all 54 states and territories responded to the recovery efforts in the Gulf States The ANG flew 73 percent of the airlift for the relief operations including its brand new C-130J and C-17 Globemaster III aircraft. In addition, ANG Combat Search and Rescue pararescuemen and Combat Controllers saved over 1,300 victims.
ANG personnel arrived on the Gulf Coast on 29 August, a few hours after the storm's arrival.  Personnel from Florida's 209th RED HORSE Squadron, 125th Fighter Wing were some of the first to enter the area. Seventy-three engineers from his unit worked in hard-hit Hancock County, Mississippi.  Initially establishing a basecamp for other emergency personnel, the unit began repairs in Hancock County communities working nearly around-the-clock on multiple construction projects to restore power, clean and repair schools, and refurbish electrical supplies.  As a Florida unit, the 209th had worked many other hurricanes. However, Katrina's devastation surpassed anything in their previous experience.
To support rescue and relief operations in New Orleans, the Air National Guard used Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans, in Belle Chasse, Louisiana, on the Mississippi River's West Bank. Within five hours of its orders, the 136th Airlift Wing, Texas Air National Guard, deployed 41 Guardsmen to Belle Chasse. Less than 24 hours later, a C-130H landed at the air base with members of the Louisiana Air National Guard]]'s 159th Fighter Wing. Soon more aircraft arrived, delivering troops and supplies for New Orleans; offloaded pallets were stacked 10 deep on the aircraft parking ramp. Instead of heading into the flooded city, the 136th team remained at Belle Chasse and, within 36 hours of arriving, it established a fully functioning Air Terminal Operations Center and was keeping pace with the demanding mission schedule. That Aerial Port team, augmented by U.S. Navy cargo handlers and members of the 133d Aerial Port Squadron, 133d Airlift Wing, Minnesota, handled over 124 missions with 1.5 million pounds of cargo and 974 passengers in one day. As one of its most crucial tasks, the Texas squadron downloaded the German pump system used to drain the city of New Orleans because its own pumps were inundated. It also uploaded two KC-135s with 140 kennels filled with rescued dogs bound for adoption in Arizona.

Operation Deep Freeze

The Air National Guard also participates in noncombat support missions that sometimes take it beyond the U.S. boundaries. For example, in Operation Winter Freeze, from November 2004 through January 2005, nearly 250 Army and Air Guardsmen provided assistance to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) along 295 miles of the United States-Canadian border. That operation included military personnel from U.S. Northern Command's Joint Task Force North who helped the Border Patrol to "keep potential terrorists out of the country and to break up smuggling rings that try to get them in." In order "to detect, deter, and monitor suspicious actions … Air Guard crews flew twin-engine, C-26 airplanes out of Syracuse, N.Y."Rosenfield and Gross (2007), Operation Winter Freeze
New York's 109th Airlift Wing LC-130 Hercules transports fly into arctic regions.  In 2006, 2 LC-130s closed the 2006 Operation Deep Freeze located at McMurdo Station near the South Pole. The mission ended because the temperature dropped to almost minus  in three days. Since 1988 the squadron had provided the air supply bridge for these airplanes with wheels landed on an ice runway near the station. However, as it got colder, the ski-equipped LC-130s landed on a snow-covered skiway on the Ross Ice Shelf a few miles from the station.
In the spring and summer, the 109th headed toward the North Pole where it supported the National Science Foundation and several other nations in Greenland and above the Arctic Circle.
