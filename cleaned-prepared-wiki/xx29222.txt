With the Beatles is the second studio album by the English rock group The Beatles. It was released on 22 November 1963, on Parlophone, and was recorded four months after the band's debut Please Please Me. The album features eight original compositions (seven by Lennon–McCartney and "Don't Bother Me", George Harrison's first recorded solo composition and his first released on a Beatles album) and six covers (mostly of Motown and R&B hits). The cover photograph was taken by the fashion photographer, Robert Freeman, and it has been mimicked by several music groups over the years. Most of the songs from the album were released in the United States by Capitol Records as the Meet the Beatles! LP on 20 January 1964; the rest featured on their next US album, The Beatles' Second Album.
The LP had advance orders of a half million and sold another half million by September 1965, making it the second album to sell a million copies in the United Kingdom, after the soundtrack to the 1958 film South Pacific.
On 26 February 1987, With the Beatles was officially released on compact disc (in mono only, catalogue number CDP 7 46436 2). Having been available only as an import in the US in the past, the album was also issued domestically in the US on LP and cassette on 21 July 1987. Along with the rest of the Beatles' canon, it was re-released on CD in newly re-mastered stereo and mono versions on 9 September 2009.
In 2003, the album was ranked number 420 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album was a number 1 in the UK and Germany.

 3 October: "I Wanna Be Your Man" and "Little Child".
 17 October: "I Want To Hold Your Hand", "This Boy", and "You Really Got A Hold On Me". This was the Beatles' first session to use four-track recording. "I Want To Hold Your Hand" and "This Boy" were the A-side and B-side of The Beatles' next single, released on 29 November.
