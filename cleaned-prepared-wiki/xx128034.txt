Carl Williams (November 11, 1959 â€“ April 7, 2013) was an American boxer from Belle Glade, Florida who was the USBA United States Heavyweight Boxing champion, and who fought in several noteworthy boxing matches in the 1980s and 1990s. 

Professional career

Nicknamed "The Truth", Williams' first title shot was against Larry Holmes, a fight he lost in a controversial decision. His next fight was a victory against Jesse Ferguson. 
Williams is perhaps best known for having fought and lost to Mike Tyson in a battle for the undisputed heavyweight championship. The first round knockout loss to Tyson in 1989 was a devastating defeat for Williams. Midway through the round, Tyson slipped a jab from Williams and loaded up with one of the most devastating counter-punches of his career, smashing Williams and sending him down for an eight count. The referee waved off the fight and Williams immediately launched a mild protest to the official and ringside judges but to no avail. He believed that the fight was stopped too early and he was not given more of an opportunity to demonstrate to the official that he was not disoriented after the knock-down. In a post fight in-ring interview, Williams appeared to be uninjured, spoke clearly, and expressed his disappointment that he was not given the opportunity to "show my stuff."  Williams also called for a rematch, however this never occurred.
After the defeat by Tyson, Williams became a journeyman heavyweight.  His other notable fights include losses to Larry Holmes, Tim Witherspoon, Tommy Morrison, and Frank Bruno, and wins against Bert Cooper and Trevor Berbick.
Williams retired in 1997 with a professional record of 30-10-0-1 with 21 knockouts.

Amateur career

Williams won two New York Golden Gloves Championships. Williams won both the 1980 New York Golden Gloves Sub-Novice Heavyweight Championship and the 1981 Heavyweight Open Championship. 

References in popular culture

Williams was the inspiration for a parody character on the Fox program In Living Color, Carl "The Tooth" Williams, portrayed by Jamie Foxx, a boxer so named because he only had one tooth.  Williams would live his everyday life in his boxing apparel, making all appearances while singing the opening line to "Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang."

After Retirement

Williams worked for Allied-SpectaGuard in New York City at Ground zero as a security agent and field supervisor. After the September 11 tragedy, Williams later worked for Verizon in Queens, New York, as a security guard.
And Forte Security Group in New York City working at Copacabana Nightclub and Marquee Nightclub up until he became ill.

Death

Williams died on April 7, 2013, of esophageal cancer. He was survived by a daughter, Carlahorse, and a son, Daniel. He was predeceased by his 12 year old daughter Nijah, who died of leukemia.boxing.html
