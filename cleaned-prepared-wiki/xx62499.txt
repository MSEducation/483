Anil Radhakrishna Kumble  ( ; ಕನ್ನಡ : ಅನಿಲ್ ಕುಂಬ್ಳೆ; born 17 October 1970) is a former international cricketer and captain of the Indian cricket team. A right-arm leg spin (leg break googly) bowler, he took 619 wickets in Test cricket and remains the third-highest wicket taker—only behind Muttiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne—as of 2012. Unlike his contemporaries, Kumble was not a big turner of the ball, rather relied much on pace and accuracy. His ability to make the ball bounce with subtle variations in pace made him a tough bowler to face for the batsmen; thus earning him the sobriquet "Jumbo". Kumble was selected as the Indian Cricket Cricketer of the Year in 1993 and one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year three years later.
Born in Bangalore, Karnataka, Kumble developed an early interest in cricket as he grew up watching players like B. S. Chandrasekhar before becoming a full-fledged cricketer. He made his First-class debut at the age of 19 while representing Karnataka. Soon he was picked up for the Austral-Asia Cup in 1990 before making his Test debut against England later that year. Since then he has represented the Indian Test team on more than 132 Test matches and was responsible for many of India's victories. Kumble became a part of the regular ODI team during the early 1990s and held some of the best performances during this time; which included his six for 12 (six wickets for 12 runs) against the West Indies. The year 1996 proved to very successful for him as he was selected for the World Cup and emerged out as the most successful bowler of the tournament; he played seven matches and captured 15 wickets at an average of 18.73. In 1999 while playing against Pakistan, Kumble dismissed all the ten batsmen in a Test match innings.
Kumble was awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour in 2005. After having played for 18 years, he announced his retirement from international cricket in November 2008. In October 2012, Kumble was appointed the chairman of International Cricket Council (ICC)'s cricket committee.
In January 2013, Kumble accepted the role of Chief Mentor with the Mumbai Indians, resigning from a similar position he held in the Royal Challengers Bangalore.

Personal life

Kumble was born in a Kannada family in Bangalore, Karnataka to Krishna Swamy and Saroja.
Kumble's primary school was Holy Saint English School and he later attended National High School, Basavanagudi, Bangalore. He began playing cricket on the streets of Bangalore and joined a club called "Young Cricketers" at the age of 13. He completed his pre-university college education from National College Basavanagudi. Kumble graduated from Rashtreeya Vidyalaya College of Engineering (RVCE) in Mechanical Engineering in 1991–92. He is nicknamed "Jumbo" not only because his deliveries, for a spinner, are "as fast as a jumbo jet", but also because his feet are quite big or "Jumbo" as observed by his team-mates.
Anil Kumble takes his last name, indicating ancestry or family origins, from the town Kumbla in Kasaragod district (Kerala). Recently one of the Main Road to Govt Hospital was renamed as ANIL KUMBLE Road by cricketer Kumble himself in a recent function conducted by Kumbla Panchayat.The Tribune - Magazine section - Saturday Extra

Style and technique

Kumble relies more on accuracy, variations and bounce rather than spinning the ball. Sambit Bal, the editor of Cricinfo, wrote, "That he Kumble has been an unusual spinner has been said many times before. It has also been said, a trifle unfairly, that he is a unidimensional bowler. Palpably, he has lacked the turn of Warne and Murali, but his variety has been subtler, far more apparent to batsmen than to viewers. He has shown that not only turn and flight that can deceive the batsman but also the changes of length and pace. He has been a cultured practitioner of his unique craft and a master of nuances."
