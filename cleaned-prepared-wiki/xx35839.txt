The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 is an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom implemented to comply with the Directive 2009/147/EC on the conservation of wild birds and still in force . In short, the act gives protection to native species (especially those at threat), controls the release of non-native species, enhances the protection of SSSIs and builds upon the rights of way rules in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. The Act is split into 4 parts covering 74 sections, it also includes 17 schedules.
The legislation has strength; few amendments have been made to it, and it has acted as a foundation for later legislation to build upon. The compulsory 5 year review of schedules 5 and 8 make it dynamic in terms of the species which it protects.

Regulators

Regulated by:
