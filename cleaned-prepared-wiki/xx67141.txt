History

Takeda Pharmaceuticals was founded on June 12, 1781 and was incorporated on January 29, 1925.
In 1977, Takeda first entered the U.S. pharmaceutical market by developing a joint venture with Abbott Laboratories called TAP Pharmaceuticals. Through TAP Pharmaceuticals, Takeda and Abbott launched the blockbusters Lupron (leuprolide) in 1985 and Prevacid (lansoprazole) in 1995.
One of the firm's mainstay drugs is Actos, a compound in the thiazolidinedione class of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Launched in 1999, Actos has become the best-selling diabetes drug in the world with $4 billion USD in sales during the 2008 fiscal year.
In February 2005, Takeda announced its acquisition of San Diego, California-based Syrrx, a company specializing in high-throughput X-ray crystallography, for $270 million.
In February 2008, Takeda acquired the Japanese operations of Amgen and rights to a dozen of the California biotechnology company's pipeline candidates for the Japanese market.
In March 2008, Takeda and Abbott Laboratories announced plans to conclude their 30-year old joint venture, TAP Pharmaceuticals, that had over $3 billion in sales in its final year. The split resulted in Abbott acquiring U.S. rights to Lupron and the drug's support staff. On the other hand, Takeda received rights to Prevacid and TAP's pipeline candidates. The move also increased Takeda's headcount by 3,000 employees.
In April 2008, Takeda announced that it was acquiring Millennium Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge, Massachusetts, a company specializing in cancer drug research, for $8.8 billion. The acquisition brought in Velcade, a drug indicated for hematological malignancies, as well as a portfolio of pipeline candidates in the oncology, inflammation, and cardiovascular therapeutic areas. Millennium now operates as an independent subsidiary, serving as the global center of excellence in oncology under its new name: "Millennium: The Takeda Oncology Company." 
In May 2008, the company licensed non-exclusively the RNAi technology platform developed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, creating a potentially long-term partnership between the companies.[ref]
