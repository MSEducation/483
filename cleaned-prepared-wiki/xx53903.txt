History

The first European settlement in Puerto Rico, Caparra, was founded in 1508 by Juan Ponce de León in land that is today part of Guaynabo.  Ponce de León resided there as first Spanish governor of Puerto Rico.  This settlement was abandoned in 1521 in favor of San Juan.  The ruins of Caparra remain and are a U.S. National Historic Landmark.  The Museum of the Conquest and Colonization of Puerto Rico, which features artifacts from the site and others in Puerto Rico, is located on the grounds.
The municipality of Guaynabo was founded in 1769 by Pedro R. Davila (P.R.), after a struggle for division from the municipality of Bayamón. Previously, the municipality was known as "Buinabo", a name that means in Taíno "Aquí hay otro lugar de agua dulce" or "Here is another place of fresh water."

Economy

Long considered to be just a mostly rural, drive-by town for drivers who were going from San Juan to the western part of Puerto Rico, Guaynabo went through a large economic revitalization in the 1950s and 1960s.  As a consequence, parts of the city have also served as a San Juan suburb preferred by upper-middle and high-income families. Today, Guaynabo has the highest per capita income in Puerto Rico. The neighborhoods of Garden Hills, Torrimar, San Patricio and Tintillo are among the upper-class neighborhoods located in Guaynabo that were built in the 1950s and 1960s, with the notable exception of Villa Caparra and Suchville, San Juan's first wealthy suburbs, which were built in the 1920s.  Residential construction continued between the 1970s and 1990s, where hundreds of new upper middle class developments were built: Parkville, Mallorca, Tierra Alta, Prado Alto, Villas Reales, Ext. Villa Caparra, Mansiones de Guaynabo, La Colina, Mansiones Reales, and Palma Real, among many others.
As a result of the proliferation of upper middle class and wealthy neighborhoods, several prominent private schools were founded in Guaynabo, including Academia San José, Colegio Marista, which mainly instruct in Spanish, although most private schools extensively cover English to levels comparable to those of the mainland; and Parkville School, American Military Academy, Baldwin School, in the Guaynabo-Bayamón border, and Wesleyan Academy, which mainly instruct in English. The first modern shopping mall built in the Caribbean and Latin America, San Patricio Plaza, was built in Guaynabo in 1968, in the San Patricio sector next to Villa Caparra.
Guaynabo's skyline is filled with over a dozen high-rise buildings.  Most are residential condominiums, but the buildings also include various major headquarters for banks and other businesses.
When Alejandro Cruz was Guaynabo's mayor, many sport facilities were built, such as Mario "Quijote" Morales Coliseum (then called Mets Pavilion). In addition, many manufacturing plants, such as the Hanes' plant, were established in Guaynabo. Guaynabo has, at different times, been voted the Most Picturesque and Cleanest Town in Puerto Rico.
Several businesses have their headquarters or local Puerto Rican branches in Guaynabo.  El Nuevo Día, Chrysler, Santander Securities, Puerto Rico Telephone, and many sales offices for large US firms (such as Texaco, Microsoft, American Airlines, Dell and others) have their Puerto Rican headquarters in Guaynabo. WAPA-TV (Televicentro) and Univisión de Puerto Rico have their main studios in Guaynabo.
