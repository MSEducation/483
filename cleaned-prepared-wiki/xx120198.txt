Early training as an artist

He attended the Art Students League of New York from 1915 to 1918, where he studied with F. Luis Mora and Everal c ford. He then studied at the Yale School of Art in the fall of 1918 until drafted into the United States Navy at the very end of World War I. 
Inspired by reading the work of Herman Melville, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Jack London as a boy, and then Frederick O'Brien's White Shadows in the South Seas in 1919, he traveled around the South Pacific from October 1920 to May 1921, spending time on Tahiti, Raiatea, Bora Bora, New Zealand, Australia, the Fiji Islands & Hawai'i.  In December 1921, one of his paintings of the South Seas were exhibited at the Art Centre, NYC."Art: The December Exhibitions", December 18, 1921, The New York Times.
In the summer of 1922, Sperry got his influence from his pet elephant named Oscar, and he was introduced to Kenneth Emory, an ethnologist at the Bishop Museum, Honolulu, by his foster sister, Anne Kinnear.

From September 1924 to May 1925, he was employed as an assistant to Emory on board the Kaimiloa, a yacht owned by Medford Kellum, sailing from Hawai'i to Fanning Island, Christmas Island, Malden Island, Penrhyn Island, Tahiti, Bora Bora & Raiatea on scientific research, although continuing to paint, exhibiting his work in Honolulu."Armstrong Sperry Has Prisoned the Elusive Atmosphere of the South Seas in Water Colors," by L.

From illustrator to award-winning writer

Sperry's first book, One Day with Manu, a colorfully illustrated tale of everyday life in Bora Bora, appeared in 1933. Critic Joan McGrath, cautions modern readers to take his depictions of other cultures in context, stating,  "His early work, such as the tales of Manu, Jambi, and Tuktu, are unlikely to be found in library collections of today, in an era rendered more sensitive to the feelings of minority cultures and racial pride than in the 1930s. Coloured as they were by the prevailing attitudes of his day, Sperry's ethnological works for young readers would by critics of today be stigmatized as condescending in their approach: it is all too easy to lose the historical perspective that would credit him with enlightenment and objectivity, given their date of publication."Twentieth Century Children's Writers, Palgrave Macmillan, 1985, pp. 722–23. 
Sperry's great-grandfather was a brave sea captain, inspiring his love of the ocean and his book All Sail Set about the clipper ship Flying Cloud, which won him a Newbery Honor Book award in 1936. Although settled in New Canaan, Connecticut, in 1934, Sperry and his family lived Santa Fe, New Mexico for a year, inspiring several books, including Wagons Westward: The Story of the Old Trail to Santa Fe in 1936 and Little Eagle, a Navaho Boy in 1938.

He was awarded the Newbery Medal for 1940 on June 20, 1941 in Cambridge, Massachusetts by the Children's Library Section of the American Library Association. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, 1949, p.27 At his acceptance of the Medal, he said, "I had been afraid that perhaps in Call It Courage, the concept of spiritual courage might be too adult for children, but the reception of this book has reaffirmed a belief I have long held: that children have imagination enough to grasp any idea, and respond to it, if it is put to them honestly and without a patronizing pat on the head."from "Acceptance Paper" by Armstrong Sperry, as appeared in Newbery Medal Books: 1922–1955, Bartha Mohoney Miller and Elinor Whitney Field, eds., Horn Book, Boston, 1955, p. 207.

Hewes, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Florence C. Means, and Hildegarde Hawthorne, as well as illustrating various basal readers for the Ginn Co.
