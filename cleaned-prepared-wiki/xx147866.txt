The Yamaha SR500  is a single-cylinder motorcycle manufactured in Japan by Yamaha Motor Company and marketed from 1978-1999 in North America, Asia and Oceania — as a street version of the Yamaha XT500 with a standard riding posture and styling resembling the Universal Japanese Motorcycle (UJM) of the 1960s and 1970s. 
Prior to formal marketing, Yamaha presented a  pre-production prototype to US dealers in the autumn of 1975.
Regarding the bike's styling, designer Atsushi Ishiyama said: "Our choice was to design the new SR 500 with a strong family image and a strong link to our first four stroke, the XS 650 twin, which was also inspired by British design." 
By 1981, the SR500 was discontinued in the US market, while continuing in Europe and Japan. The model ended production in 1999.
The SR500 employed a slightly modified version of its large single-cylinder engine

In early 2014, Yamaha announced that the SR400 would be released in the United States in May 2014 as a 2015 model.
