Early life

Cooke was born on August 31, 1954 in Charlotte, NC. His father, Bill Cooke, is a preacher originally from Gastonia, NC. Bill studied at Catawba College, Johnson C. Smith University, and University of North Carolina at Charlotte. He received his Doctor of Ministry from Oral Roberts University. He was a WWII Veteran with the U.S. Marine Corps, and was distinguished in the Pacific Ocean theatre. His mother, Thelma Blackwelder Cooke was a homemaker.
Phil attributes his career path to a movie he made in high school, which he played for his fellow students at Oral Roberts University. When the response was positive, he left his music major behind and got his degree in Film and Television in 1976. He later earned a Master's in Journalism from the University of Oklahoma, and a Doctorate in Theology from Trinity College and Seminary. 11

Career

Cooke is known in Christian circles as an advocate of faith branding, encouraging Christian organizations and leaders to change how churches communicate their message in a media-centric world. As Cooke has explained, "Most people have negative connotations when they hear the word 'branding.' They think commercialism, they think capitalism. But the fact is, branding is simply a compelling story around a product or a person or an organization."Wegner, Rachel; "Faith, Culture, and Other Mysteries"; ORU Report, Fall 2008; p. 9
Cooke wrote two books that attempt to explain this concept, Branding Faith: Why Some Churches and Non-Profits Impact Culture and Others Don't, and The Last TV Evangelist: Why the Next Generation Couldn't Care Less About Religious Media and Why It Matters. In The Last TV Evangelist, Cooke argued that scandals and a shift in media consumption has spelled the end for what has been known as "traditional" Christian media.net
The Christian Broadcasting Network quotes him, regarding Christianity in the media, as saying: "We simply have to have a voice in the media. It's time for the church to take ministry to the next level."Christian Broadcasting Network; "Phil Cooke: Christian Media for the New Millennium" Cooke's message has been summed up as: "If churches want to be listened to, they need to respond adequately to the new situation, or risk not being heard."Flynn, Father John, LC; "Churches Communicating a Message of Hope"; Catholic. 9 and that it has the technological backing to realize that desire.
One of Cooke's main criticisms of contemporary U.S. "Christian culture" is its lack of creativity. He is firmly against what he describes as the "bubble" that the Christian culture is in, as it is focused on developing its own music, books, and movies that do not engage the culture at large. Cooke explains: "Changing the culture is a gigantic task. It's like the weather......."Wegner, Rachel; "Faith, Culture, and Other Mysteries"; ORU Report, Fall 2008; p. 10
In 2013, Cooke launched "The Influence Lab", a nonprofit organization that works to train the next generation of international media professionals.  He believes that the Church must change their strategy about global missions.  In a world where - by population - Facebook is the 3rd largest country in the world, the Christian community must rethink "missions" in terms of digital boundaries, not geographic boundaries. Cooke and his wife serve on the board of directors along with Jonathan Bock, Craig Detweiler, and Dawn Nicole Baldwin are members of the Board of Directors. The Influence Lab partners with The National Religious Broadcasters, YouVersion Bible App, OneHope, Jesus Film Project, Christian Media Australia, and Visual Story Network.
