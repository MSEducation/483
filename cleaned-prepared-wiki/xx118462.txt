[[LiMux]]

CATEGORIES: Debian-based distributions, Linux software projects, State-sponsored Linux distributions, Ubuntu (operating system) derivatives

LiMux is a project by the city of  Munich to migrate their software systems from closed-source, proprietary Microsoft products to free and open source software. The project was successfully completed in late 2013, which involved migrating 15,000 personal computers and laptops of public employees to free and open source software using the Linux distribution "LiMux" (an Ubuntu derivative) as the operating system and LibreOffice as the primary productivity software.itworld. The city reports in addition to gaining freedom in software decisions and increased security, it has also saved €11.7 million (US$16 million).giraffedog.com/blog/ubuntu-linux-hints-tips/city-munich-successfully-ditches-microsoft-favour-linux-open-source/
Similar projects were started with differing success in Vienna (Wienux), and Zaragoza (AZLinux).
LiMux is also the name of the Linux distribution being used for the project. LiMux is the first Linux-based workplace certified for industry use (ISO 9241) by the TÜV IT, Technical Service, Germany. and version 4.1 available from August 2012 is also based on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. The future version of LiMux will be based on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Objectives

The migration project in Munich is ongoing and not an overnight switch to free software on every desktop. The main goal is to achieve more independence from software distributors, concerning client/server and native client software. The decision in 2003 had two components, on the one hand to get free software running on most of the desktops, and on the other hand to buy and develop web-based and platform independent (e.g. Java-based) business applications.
