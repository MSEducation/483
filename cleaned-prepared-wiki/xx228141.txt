The Philadelphia Pennsylvania Temple is a temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) under construction in the Logan Square neighborhood of Philadelphia.  The announcement of the temple was made on October 4, 2008 during the church's 178th Semiannual General Conference by LDS Church president Thomas S. Monson.  The temple will be the first in the state of Pennsylvania.
On November 19, 2009, the church announced that the temple would be built on Vine Street in downtown Philadelphia, directly northeast of Logan Circle.  This location puts the planned temple in the immediate vicinity of several prominent Philadelphia landmarks, and immediately across the street from the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul, head church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia.
Ground was broken for the temple on 17 September 2011. Local community leaders were present for the ceremonies which were presided over by Henry B. Eyring, First Counselor in the church's First Presidency.
The temple architect is B. Jeffrey Stebar of the Atlanta office of Perkins+Will, a Latter-day Saint who has served as a bishop and currently serves in an LDS stake presidency.
In February 2014, city and church officials announced that a meetinghouse and a 32-story residential building will be built on a lot adjacent to the temple site. The meetinghouse will include a family history center and, as a religious building, be tax-exempt. The residential building is anticipated to include 258 apartments and 13 townhouses, along with retail space, and be subject to regular, applicable taxes.
