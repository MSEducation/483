UltraMantis Black (born July 17, 1975) is a professional wrestler, who performs primarily in the Chikara professional wrestling promotion, where he is the leader of The Spectral Envoy of the Final Judgment, while also regularly commentating on matches in which he is not competing. UltraMantis Black, Chikara founder Mike Quackenbush, Hallowicked and Icarus are the only wrestlers who performed on Chikara's first ever show on May 25, 2002, and are still working for the promotion today.

Professional wrestling career

UltraMantis started his professional wrestling training in 2002 at the brand new Chikara Wrestle Factory, where he was trained by Mike Quackenbush and Reckless Youth. He trained on the first term of the school alongside the likes of Hallowicked and Icarus.

Chikara

=Debut and alliance with Mister Zero(2002–2003)=

On May 25, 2002, UltraMantis made his Chikara debut as a tecnico superhero on the promotion's first show, where he was defeated by fellow Wrestle Factory graduate Blind Rage.

=Turning rudo (2004–2005)=

In early 2004, UltraMantis began showing signs of a becoming a rudo after adopting a more aggressive style and attacking fellow wrestlers after they had managed to defeat him. At the following show on May 15, he debuted a new black mask and declared that UltraMantis was dead before announcing the birth of UltraMantis Black. He would then form a tag team with Hallowicked, known collectively as the Dark Breed, and together they would feud with Mister Zero and his new tag team partner Shane Storm. For the 2004 torneo cibernetico, the Dark Breed joined Larry Sweeney's faction Sweet 'n' Sour International, but after neither of them managed to win the match, they left the faction. In early 2005, UltraMantis Black began suffering from injuries that would force him to take on the roles of a commentator, a role he continues to hold, and a manager for Hallowicked.

=Alliance and feud with Hydra (2005–2008)=

On November 13, 2005, UltraMantis Black debuted his newest protégé, Hydra. With UltraMantis out with an injury, Hallowicked became a tecnico after forming the tag team Incoherence with tecnico wrestler Delirious. Beginning in 2006, Ultramantis debuted an entirely new mantis mask. Later on in June of that year, during the Young Lions Cup tournament, UltraMantis attacked Hallowicked and then announced the death of the Dark Breed and the birth of The Order of the Neo–Solar Temple. In October of that same year, Crossbones joined UltraMantis and Hydra as the third member of the stable. The feud between the Neo–Solar Temple and Incoherence would end during the season five finale weekend, where Incoherence first defeated UltraMantis and Hydra in a tag team match on November 17 and then UltraMantis, Hydra, Crossbones and Blind Rage in an eight man tag team match, where they teamed up with Cheech and Cloudy, the following day.
UltraMantis, Hydra and Crossbones spent 2007 wrestling together on the undercards of Chikara events. Towards the end of the year, the team started to grow apart and on November 17, UltraMantis inexplicably helped Shane Storm, who had been on a long losing streak, defeat Hydra. On April 19, 2008, UltraMantis defeated Tim Donst, whom he had dropped on his head in Donst's debut the previous year, with the Praying Mantis Bomb. After the match, the Neo–Solar Temple kidnapped the concussed Donst and managed to convince him to become the fourth member of the faction. However, this would all be revealed a plan by Mike Quackenbush as he had sent Donst to infiltrate the Neo–Solar Temple in order to find out who had leaked the secret of the Chikara Special to Chris Hero.

=The Eye of Tyr and BDK (2009–2010)=

In 2009 UltraMantis and Crossbones began looking for a third member in the Neo–Solar Temple. Pinkie Sanchez and Sami Callihan were given chances, but neither of them could help the Neo–Solar Temple to qualify for the 2009 King of Trios. In early 2009 UltraMantis, after being threatened by Quackenbush, revealed that the reason he had wanted the Chikara Special from Shane Storm the previous year was that with it he could get his hands on the Eye of Tyr, a mysterious artifact that could be used to control minds. The artifact, which had gone missing from Switzerland, had suddenly appeared in possession of Dr. Cube over at Kaiju Big Battel. Cube was a fan of Chris Hero's and was ready to swap the Eye of Tyr for him. Shane Storm came to UltraMantis and offered to teach him the move in order to get back to his winning ways and this is why UltraMantis had helped him defeat Hydra back in November 2007. After learning the move, UltraMantis taught it to Hero, who then, after winning his feud with Equinox, agreed to leave Chikara for Kaiju Big Battel and in exchange, Dr. Cube handed the Eye of Tyr to UltraMantis.
In April 2009, UltraMantis saw a chance to finally get revenge on his former Dark Breed partner Hallowicked and on April 26, he and Crossbones kidnapped Delirious after Incoherence's match. On October 18, 2009, at Cibernetico Increible the man was joined by another larger man dressed in similar fashion and together they appeared in the crowd and confronted UltraMantis, who proceeded to flee the arena. Following the event a cyborg named Vökoder, who had debuted during the Young Lions Cup, came to UltraMantis and offered to protect the Eye of Tyr and to convince him of his sincerity, Vökoder started interfering in UltraMantis' matches in order to help him win. Eventually, UltraMantis made Vökoder the fourth member of The Order of the Neo–Solar Temple.
On November 22, 2009, during the season eight finale titled Three-Fisted Tales, UltraMantis and Delirious defeated Hallowicked and his new Incoherence partner Frightmare to earn their third point, which meant that they could now challenge for the Chikara Campeonatos de Parejas.
Despite the events that took place at the season eight finale and Tim Donst, Ares and Claudio Castagnoli taking shots at the Order of the Neo–Solar Temple on Chikara's official website,
On April 25 Chikara announced that UltraMantis Black would star in the company's first video game, titled Rudo Resurrection, to be released later in the year.
On May 22 at Aniversario Zehn UltraMantis Black finally entered the ring with a member of BDK, when he faced Ares in a singles match. Ares managed to score the pinfall, when Delirious, now aligned with BDK, made his return to the company and cost UltraMantis the match.

=The Spectral Envoy (2010–present)=

At the season nine finale, Reality is Relative, on December 12, Hallowicked defeated UltraMantis Black in a singles match. After the match the third hooded figure from the previous month entered the arena and revealed himself as Sinn Bodhi. Bodhi then revealed that UltraMantis Black had come to him asking for his help against BDK and he had given him Obariyon and Kodama and now he had come for his payment, the Eye of Tyr. When UltraMantis was unable to produce the Eye of Tyr he was attacked by Obariyon, Kodama and the debuting Kobald. In the end, Hallowicked and Frightmare made the save for UltraMantis and chased Bodhi's group, later named The Batiri, out of the ring.
UltraMantis first used the Eye of Tyr to get rid of Sinn Bodhi, handing him what was later revealed as a fake replica, which led to Bodhi parting ways with the promotion.

Absolute Intense Wrestling (2013)

On November 1, 2013, UltraMantis Black made a surprise debut for Absolute Intense Wrestling (AIW), challenging Ethan Page and defeating him in the subsequent match to win the promotion's top title, the AIW Absolute Championship.
