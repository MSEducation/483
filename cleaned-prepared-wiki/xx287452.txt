Highlights

Day 1 (12 August)

The first medal of the 2013 World Championships was won by Ireland's Darragh McDonald who took gold in the 400m freestyle S6 class.
The afternoon session witnessed five new world records. Ihar Boki of Belarus, one of the stand-out athletes of the championships, broke the world record in the final of the SM13 200m individual medley. Then within the hour two more records fell as Lisenkov's record in the 100m backstroke S8, set in the morning, failed to last a day as he took 0.70 seconds of his own time to secure gold; while Britain's Josef Craig added the World title of the 400m freestyle S7 to his Paralympic title with a winning time of 4:39.13. The final two new world records were set in the last three races of the day. New Zealand's Sophie Pascoe swam 1:00.15 in the 100m freestyle S10 while British athlete Jessica-Jane Applegate recorded a time of 2:09.88 in the 200m freestyle to just freeze out Ireland's Bethany Firth.
Of the other medals, several of the big stars of the games took their first gold medals on the first day. Ukraine's Dmytro Vynohradets took the first of his seven gold medals with success in the Men's 200m freestyle S3, while his team-mate Olga Sviderska took the equivalent title in the women's race but well outside her morning's record finish. Australia's Matthew Cowdrey picked up the first of five championship golds in the 100m freestyle S9 while the women's race Stephanie Millward of Britain secured the first of her four golds. New Zealand saw further success on Day one when Mary Fisher started her rung of gold medals with a win in the 100m backstroke S11. Brazil's Andre Brasil became a double Paralympic and World Champion taking the 100m Freestyle S10, a title he has held in those two world championships since 2008 in Beijing. The USA also achieved success on day one, collecting three medals from Roy Perkins (50m butterfly S5), Rebecca Anne Meyers (200m medley SM13) and Cortney Jordan (400m freestly S7), though it was the Ukraine who topped the medal table at the day with six golds.
