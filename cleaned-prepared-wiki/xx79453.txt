History

First formation

The group dissolved by the beginning of the 1970s, with  Thompson remaining an overseas supporter of the UK National Front.

Official organisation

The National Front of New Zealand, commonly known as the "New Zealand National Front" (NZNF) was an initiative of John Tyndall of the British National Front formed in 1977; sister organisations were also formed in Australia and South Africa at the same time.
The party's first Chairman was David Crawford aided by Brian Thompson, with Kerry Bolton joining in 1978. It distributed "large numbers of Holocaust denial pamphlets and books".38-49 Thompson represented the party at the march in Lewisham in 1977.Spoonley, Paul The Politics of Nostalgia: racism and the extreme right in New Zealand The Dunmore Press (1987) p160 The organisation became moribund during the early 1980s, many of its members leaving to form the 'New Force' which Bolton formed in 1981.
From June 1978 the party jointly published a magazine called Frontline with the National Front of Australia. After the demise of the party, the magazine continued to March 1987 in support of a more general non-party "nationalist cause".

Current party

In 1989 Anton Foljambe sought to revive the Frontline title for his "Conservative Front" grouping. This led to the reformation of the NZNF with himself as leader. It published a magazine, edited by Foljambe, called Viewpoint. Foljambe resigned as leader in 1997 establishing the rival National Democrats Party in 1999. Kyle Chapman then led the party until resigning as leader in 2005, with Bolton rejoining in 2004. Its peak strength was in 2003 - 2005, under the leadership of Chapman and Bolton, when it seemed to never be out of the headlines 
In June 2008, the party joined forces with the National Democrats and another international organisation, the 'New Right', to jointly contest the 2008 elections as the Nationalist Alliance.

Support

The National Front has received a small amount of public support, with 1.9% voting in favour of Kyle Chapman in the 2005 Christchurch mayoral election.

Activities

On 23 October 2004, the National Front held a protest in Wellington in support of retaining the current New Zealand flag, which was attended by an estimated 45 persons. This "Flag Day Rally" has now become an annual event, with NF members and protesters squaring off outside parliament every year since.
In 2004 the NZNF reformed the National Front Australia.stormfront.php?t=166679
The National Front claimed to have benefitted from favourable media coverage, with Kyle Chapman telling the Dominion newspaper that "the media is our best recruiter".

Policies

According to Te Ara, the discernible policies of the National Front are "homophobia, racism and patriotic nationalism."
