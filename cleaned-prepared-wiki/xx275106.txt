History

Tiger Bay Warriors (1993 to 2000)

The club was formed in 1993 as the Tiger Bay Warriors, and started out as a Junior Flag team.
The following two years, the Warriors played at Youth Kitted level. In 1994 season they won the BYAFA South East Division with a perfect 8-0 record and reached the playoff semi-final.
The decision was then taken to move up to senior level, and the Warriors were admitted to the Southwest Conference of the British Senior League's third division. Their experience in their previous youth tournaments seemed to serve them well as their first season at this level saw them post an 8-2 record, finishing second in their conference. They went on the reach the playoff semi-final before losing to the eventual divisional champions, the Winchester Rifles. 
As with the year before, the Warriors finished the 1998 regular season in second place, tied with the Southern Sundevils with a 7-1 record but with an inferior points difference. As a result they lost home advantage for their playoff match and this proved crucial as they went down by a single point to the London Mets.
Unfortunately the Warriors were unable to build on this success. After losing several key players and the services of Head Coach Rob Mota, they were forced to withdraw from the league in 2000 and subsequently the team disbanded.

Stadium

With the team based in Cardiff with most of their games were played at Canton rugby club, Channel View Leisure Centre and Roath Park.
