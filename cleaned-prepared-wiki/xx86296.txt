Deborah "Debbi" Morgan (born September 20, 1956) is an American film and television actress. She is best known for her role as Dr. Angie Hubbard on the ABC soap opera All My Children, and for her role as The Seer in the fourth and fifth seasons of Charmed. In film, she received critical acclaim for her performance in Eve's Bayou (1997).

Early life

Morgan was born in Dunn, North Carolina, the daughter of Lora, a teacher, and George Morgan, Jr., a butcher. She has a younger sister, Terry. Her father died of leukemia when she was eight, and she was raised by her mother, who worked as a secretary and a typing instructor at Junior High School 80 in the Bronx. Morgan attended parochial school. 

Career

Morgan's earliest film role was in the movie Mandingo in 1975. She played the role of Dite. Morgan's earliest recurring role was on What's Happening!! from 1976 to 1977 as Diane Harris, and also appeared on Good Times.  In 1979, she received critical acclaim for her portrayal of Alex Haley's great-aunt Elizabeth Harvey on the 1979 miniseries Roots: The Next Generations, and her guest-starring role as Curtis Jackson's ex-girlfriend turned prostitute on The White Shadow.  Her most famous role was Angie Baxter Hubbard on the soap opera All My Children, a role she originally played from January 1982 to July 1990. Her portrayal of Angie struck a chord with many Black viewers across America. Angie and her love interest, Jesse Hubbard (Darnell Williams), became the first African-American "supercouple" on the daytime serials.  In 1989, Morgan won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (which she shares with Santa Barbara actress Nancy Lee Grahn).  She and Williams also co-hosted a music video show titled New York Hot Tracks in the mid-1980s.
After leaving All My Children, Morgan played the role of Chantal Marshall on the NBC soap opera, Generations (replacing actress Sharon Brown) and remained with the show until it ended. She then reprised her role as Angie Hubbard on ABC's Loving in 1991. In 1995, she brought the same character to The City (a retooled version of Loving), making Morgan one of the few performers to portray the same character on three different soap operas.  From 1997 to 1998, she also  played Dr. Ellen Burgess on Port Charles. In the 1980s and 1990s, Morgan became a de facto symbol for the possibilities for black women as all of her soap opera roles involved her playing a successful doctor.
Morgan garnered much acclaim from movie critics for her portrayal of clairvoyant Mozelle Batiste Delacroix in director Kasi Lemmons' drama film Eve's Bayou (1997).
From 2002 to 2003, Morgan played lead character Lora Gibson, opposite Lea Thompson, on the Lifetime drama series For the People. She also played the role of The Seer in the fourth and fifth seasons of Charmed. Morgan, returned to All My Children in January 2008, after 10 years after leaving daytime television.

Personal life

Morgan has been married four times: to Charles Weldon from 1980 to 1984; to actor Charles S. Dutton from 1989 to 1994, and photographer Donn Thompson from 1997 to 2000. She has been married to Jeffrey Winston since June 2009.
