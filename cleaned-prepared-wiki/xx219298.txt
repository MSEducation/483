Club career

Vasco da Gama

Coutinho started his footballing career as part of Vasco da Gama's youth system and was bought by Italian Serie A giants Internazionale in 2008, at the age of 16, for €4 million. Coutinho stayed at Vasco on loan until his 18th birthday, becoming a first team player for the Brazilian side despite his young age.

Internazionale

Coutinho's move to Internazionale became effective on July 2010, after he turned 18, with new head coach Rafael Benítez and chairman Massimo Moratti being quoted saying that "Coutinho is the future of Inter".
On 27 August 2010, he made his official debut in an Inter jersey as a substitute during the Nerazzurri's 2–0 defeat at the hands of Atlético Madrid in the 2010 UEFA Super Cup. After dropping out of selection in the starting line up, he returned and proved crucial in the 3–2 win over Bayern Munich in Germany as he provided a beautiful ball for Samuel Eto'o after running at the defense, followed by Eto'o setting up Wesley Sneijder for the second Inter goal; a game which Inter would go onto win and progress to the quarter-finals of the Champions League on the away goals rule. On 8 May 2011, he scored his first goal for Inter from a free-kick that curled above the wall and into the net in a game that Inter won 3–1 at home against Fiorentina.
His second goal for Inter came in a match against Cagliari on 19 November 2011 where Coutinho picked up a through ball from his teammate Ricky Álvarez to place the ball into the bottom left corner of the net to give Inter a 2–0 lead. He further became involved and staked a claim for his spot when he provided an assist during a game against Fiorentina and was heavily involved in the second goal.
During 2011–12, he struggled to establish himself in the Inter first team and was loaned out to RCD Espanyol.

Style of play

Considered to be an archetypal Brazilian number 10 with trickery, flair, fantastic vision and an eye for goal. Coutinho has been used as an offensive midfielder (trequartista), second striker and on the flanks. He has that vision and passing ability to unlock defences at will with mesmerising through balls, and does so on a consistent basis. He has been compared to Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho by former Espanyol manager Mauricio Pochettino,

International career

A key player in the Brazilian squad that won the 2009 South American Under-17 Football Championship scoring three goals, Coutinho made his first senior appearance in a Brazil shirt on 7 October 2010, starting in a friendly match against Iran.
