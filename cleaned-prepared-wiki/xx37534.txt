Harry Partch (June 24, 1901 – September 3, 1974) was an American composer, music theorist, and creator of musical instruments.  He was one of the first 20th-century composers in the West to work systematically with microtonal scales.  He built custom-made instruments in these tunings on which to play his compositions, and described his theory and practice in his book Genesis of a Music (1947 and 1974).
Partch composed using scales of unequal intervals in just intonation, derived from the natural Harmonic series; these scales allowed for more tones of smaller intervals than in the standard Western tuning, which uses twelve equal intervals to the octave.  Partch divided the octave into 43 unequal tones.  To play this music, he built a large number of unique instruments, with names such as the Chromelodeon, the Quadrangularis Reversum, and the Zymo-Xyl. Partch described his own music as corporeal, and distinguished it from abstract music, which he perceived as the dominant trend in Western music since the time of Bach.  His earliest compositions were small-scale pieces to be intoned to instrumental backing; his later works were large-scale, integrated theater productions in which he expected each of the performers to sing, dance, speak, and play instruments.  Ancient Greek theatre and Japanese Noh and kabuki heavily influenced his music theatre.  
Encouraged by his mother, Partch learned several instruments at a young age.  By fourteen, he was composing, and in particular took to setting dramatic situations.  He dropped out of the University of Southern California's School of Music in 1922 over dissatisfaction with the quality of his teachers. He took to self-study in San Francisco's libraries, where he discovered Hermann von Helmholtz's Sensations of Tone, which convinced him to devote himself to music based on scales tuned in just intonation.  In 1930, he destroyed all his previous compositions in a rejection of the European concert tradition.  Partch frequently moved around the US.  Early in his career, he was a transient worker, and sometimes a hobo; later he depended on grants, university appointments, and record sales to support himself. In 1970, supporters created the Harry Partch Foundation to administer Partch's music and instruments.

Personal history

Early life (1900–1919)

Partch was born on June 24, 1901 in Oakland, California.  His parents were Virgil Franklin Partch (1860–1919) and Jennie (
The family moved to Arizona for his mother's health.  His father worked for the Immigration Service there, and they settled in the small town of Benson.  It was still the Wild West there in the early twentieth century, and Partch recalled seeing outlaws in town.  Nearby, there were native Yaqui people, whose music he heard.  His mother sang to him in Mandarin, and he heard and sang songs in Spanish and the Yaqui language.  His mother encouraged her children to learn music, and he learned the mandolin, violin, piano,
The family moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1913, where Partch seriously studied the piano. He got work playing keyboards for silent films while he was in high school. By 14, he was composing for the piano. He early found an interest in writing music for dramatic situations, and often cited the lost composition Death and the Desert (1916) as an early example.

Early experiments (1919–1947)

The family moved to Los Angeles in 1919 following the death of Partch's father.  There, his mother was killed in a trolley accident in 1920. He enrolled in the University of Southern California's School of Music in 1920, but was dissatisfied with his teachers and left after the summer of 1922.
By 1925, Partch was putting his theory into practice by developing paper coverings for violin and viola with fingerings in just intonation, and wrote a string quartet using such tunings.  He put his theories in words in May 1928 in the first draft for a book, then called Exposition of Monophony.
Partch had a New Orleans violin maker build a viola with the fingerboard of a cello.  He used this instrument, dubbed the Adapted Viola, to write music using a scale with twenty-nine tones to the octave.
Partch unsuccessfully applied for Guggenheim grants in 1933 and 1934.  The Carnegie Corporation of New York granted him $1500 so he could do research in England.  He gave readings at the British Museum and travelled in Europe.  He met W. B. Yeats in Dublin, whose translation of Sophocles' King Oeadipus he wanted to set to his music;
Partch returned to the U.S. in 1935 at the height of the Great Depression, and spent a transient nine years, often as a hobo, often picking up work or obtaining grants from organizations such as the Federal Writers' Project.

University work (1947–1962)

Supported by Guggenheim and university grants, Partch took up residence at the University of Wisconsin from 1944 until 1947.  This was a productive period, in which he lectured, trained an ensemble, staged performances, released his first recordings, and completed his book, now called Genesis of a Music.  Genesis was completed in 1947 and published in 1949 by the University of Wisconsin Press.  He left the university, as it never accepted him as a member of the permanent staff, and there was little space for his growing stock of instruments.
In 1949, pianist Gunnar Johansen allowed Partch to convert a smithy on his ranch to a studio.  Partch worked there with support from the Guggenheim Foundation,
In February 1953, Partch founded the studio Gate 5 in an abandoned shipyard in Sausalito, California, where he composed, built instruments and staged performances.  Subscriptions to raise money for recordings were organized by the Harry Partch Trust Fund, an organization put together by friends and supporters. The recordings were sold via mail order, as were later releases on the Gate 5 Records label. The money raised from these recordings became his main source of income.
After completing The Bewitched in January 1955, Partch tried to find the means to put on a production of it.

Later life in California (1962–1974)

Partch set up a studio in late 1962 in Petaluma, California, in a former chick hatchery.  There he composed And on the Seventh Day, Petals Fell in Petaluma.  He left in summer 1964, and spent his remaining decade in various cities in southern California.  He rarely had university work during this period, and survived on grants, commissions, and record sales.
His final theater work was Delusion of the Fury,
In 1991, Partch's journals from June 1935 to February 1936 were discovered and published—journals that Partch had believed to have been lost or destroyed.  In 1998, musicologist Bob Gilmore published a biography about Partch.

Personal life

Partch was first cousins with gag cartoonist Virgil Partch (1916–1984).

Legacy

Partch met Danlee Mitchell while he was at the University of Illinois; Partch made Mitchell his heir,
The Sousa Archives and Center for American Music in Urbana, Illinois, holds the Harry Partch Estate Archive, 1918–1991,Harry Partch Estate Archive, 1918–1991, Sousa Archives and Center for American Music which consists of Partch's personal papers, musical scores, films, tapes and photographs documenting his career as a composer, writer, and producer. It also holds the Music and performing Arts Library Harry Partch Collection, 1914–2007,Music and Performing Arts Library Harry Partch Collection, 1914–2007, Sousa Archives and Center for American Music which consists of books, music, films, personal papers, artifacts and sound recordings collected by the staff of the Music and Performing Arts Library and the University of Illinois School of Music documenting the life and career of Harry Partch, and those associated with him, throughout his career as a composer and writer.
Partch's notation is an obstacle, as it mixes a sort of tablature with indications of pitch ratios.  This makes it difficult for those trained in traditional Western notation, and gives no visual indication as to what the music is intended to sound like.

Recognition

In 1974, Partch was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Percussive Arts Society, a music service organization promoting percussion education, research, performance and appreciation throughout the world.S. Highball was selected by the Library of Congress's National Recording Preservation Board as "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".Library of Congress: National Recording Preservation Board

Music

Theory

Partch made public his theories in his book Genesis of a Music (1947).  He opens the book with an overview of music history, and argues that Western music began to suffer from the time of Bach, after which twelve-tone equal temperament was adopted to the exclusion of other tuning systems, and abstract, instrumental music became the norm.  Partch sought to bring vocal music back to prominence, and adopted tunings and scales he believed more suitable to singing.
Inspired by Sensations of Tone, Hermann von Helmholtz's book on acoustics and the perception of sound, Partch based his music strictly on just intonation.  He tuned his instruments using the overtone series, and extended it past the twelfth partial.  This allowed for a larger number of smaller, unequal intervals than found in the Western classical music tradition's twelve-tone equal temperament.  Partch's tuning is often classed as microtonality, as it allowed for intervals smaller than 100 cents, though Partch did not conceive his tuning in such a context.
Partch uses the terms Otonality and Utonality to describe chords whose pitch classes are the harmonics or subharmonics of a given fixed tone.  These six-tone chords function in Partch's music much the same that the three-tone major and minor chords (or triads) do in classical music.

Style

Partch rejected the Western concert music tradition, saying that the music of composers such as Beethoven "has only the feeblest roots" in Western culture.

Partch believed that Western music of the 20th century suffered from excessive specialization. He objected to the theatre of the day which he believed had divorced music and drama, and strove to create complete, integrated theatre works in which he expected each performer to sing, dance, play instruments, and take on speaking parts. Patch used the words "ritual" and "corporeal" to describe his theatre works—musicians and their instruments were not hidden in an orchestra pit or offstage, but were a visual part of the performance.

Instruments

Partch called himself "a philosophic music-man seduced into carpentry".
Most of Partch's works used the instruments he created exclusively.  Some works made use of unaltered standard instruments such as clarinet or cello; Revelation in the Courtyard Park (1960) used an unaltered small wind band,
In 1990, Dean Drummond's Newband became custodians of the original Harry Partch instrument collection, and the group performs with and commissions new pieces for the instruments.
Those who have duplicated partial sets of Partch instruments include John Schneider, whose West Coast ensemble includes replicas of the Kithara, Surrogate Kithara, Cloud-Chamber Bowls, Adapted Guitars, Adapted Viola, Diamond Marimba, Bass Marimba, Chromelodeon, and two Harmonic Canons.

Works

Partch's earliest compositions were small-scale pieces to be intoned to instrumental backing;
Partch described the theory and practice of his music in his book Genesis of a Music, which he had published  first in 1947,
Partch partially supported himself with the sales of recordings, which he began making in the late 1930s.
