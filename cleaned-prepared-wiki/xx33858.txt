Early life

Cho was born into a Korean family in San Francisco, California. She grew up in a racially diverse neighborhood in the 1970s and 1980s, which she described as a community of "old hippies, ex-druggies, burn-outs from the '60s, drag queens, Chinese people, and Koreans. To say it was a melting pot â€” that's the least of it. It was a really confusing, enlightening, wonderful time.""Biography". Margaret Cho: Official Site. August 15, 2008.

Television career

All American Girl

That same year, ABC developed and aired a sitcom based on Cho's stand-up routine. The show, All-American Girl, was initially feted as the first show prominently featuring an East Asian family, although the short lived sitcom Mr. T and Tina preceded it by nearly two decades.
