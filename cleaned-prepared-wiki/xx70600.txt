Sadie Liza Frost (born 19 June 1965)Survivor: Sadie Frost Sunday Times - 19 August 2007 is an English actress, who currently runs fashion label Frost French and has designed the kitchens for a new development in the East End of London.

Early life

Frost was born in Islington, London to psychedelic artist David Vaughan, who worked for the Beatles, and his then-16-year-old muse, actress Mary Davidson.
She has described her childhood as a "chaotic but positive experience," as she was born in Islington but spent much of her youth in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire after her parents separated. Her parents had six relationships between them, which gave her 4 sisters and 5 brothers, including fellow actresses Holly Davidson and Jade Davidson; primary school teacher Jessi Frost, brothers called Gabriel Jupiter and Tobias Vaughan; and a sister named Sunshine Purple Tara Velvet.   One of Frost's stepfathers - the rock photographer Robert Davidson - was a follower of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh cult, who forbade the children to say the words "No" or "Sorry"; during her father's colour-therapy phase, he insisted that everybody in the house wear orange and he wouldn't let them eat anything that was red. They also had to take showers wearing tracksuits, and they were forced to refer to objects as the most opposite they could think of as a test of character, for example calling apples elephants.
