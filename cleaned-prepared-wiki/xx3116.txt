[[List of extinct birds]]

CATEGORIES: Birds by classification, Extinct birds, Lists of birds, Extinctions since 1500, Lists of extinct animals, Taxonomic lists (species), Bird extinctions since 1500

Since 1500, over 190 species of birds have become extinct, and this rate of extinction seems to be increasing. The situation is exemplified by Hawaii, where 30% of all known recently extinct bird taxa originally lived. Other areas, such as Guam, have also been hit hard; Guam has lost over 60% of its native bird taxa in the last 30 years, many of them due to the introduced Brown Tree Snake.
Currently there are approximately 10,000 species of birds, with an estimated 1,200 considered to be under threat of extinction.
Island species in general, and flightless island species in particular are most at risk. The disproportionate number of rails in the list reflects the tendency of that family to lose the ability to fly when geographically isolated. Even more rails became extinct before they could be described by scientists; these taxa are listed in Later Quaternary Prehistoric Birds.
The extinction dates given below are usually approximations of the actual date of extinction. In some cases, more exact dates are given as it is sometimes possible to pinpoint the date of extinction to a specific year or even day (the San Benedicto Rock Wren is possibly the most extreme example—its extinction could be timed with an accuracy of maybe half an hour). Extinction dates in the literature are usually the dates of the last verified record (credible observation or specimen taken); in many Pacific birds which became extinct shortly after European contact, however, this leaves an uncertainty period of over a century because the islands on which they used to occur were only rarely visited by scientists.

Extinct bird species

Charadriiformes

Shorebirds, gulls and auks.

Gruiformes

Rails and allies. Probably paraphyletic.

Podicipediformes

Grebes.

Ciconiiformes

Herons and related birds. Possibly paraphyletic.

Pelecaniformes

Cormorants and related birds.

Procellariiformes

Petrels, shearwaters, albatrosses and storm petrels.

Psittaciformes

Parrots.

Cuculiformes

Cuckoos.

Falconiformes

Birds of prey.

Strigiformes

Typical owls and barn-owls.

Caprimulgiformes

Caprimulgidae - Nightjars and nighthawks.

Reclusive ground-nesting birds that sally out at night to hunt for large insects and similar prey. They are easily located by the males' song, but this is not given all year. Habitat destruction represents currently the biggest threat, while island populations are threatened by introduced mammalian predators, notably dogs, cats, pigs and mongoose.

Apodiformes

Swifts and hummingbirds.

Coraciiformes

Kingfishers and related birds.

Piciformes

Woodpeckers and related birds.

Passeriformes

Perching birds.

(Probably) Extinct subspecies of birds

Extinction of subspecies is a subject very dependent on guesswork. National and international conservation projects and research publications such as redlists usually focus on species as a whole. Reliable information on the status of threatened subspecies usually has to be assembled piecemeal from published observations such as regional checklists. Therefore, the following listing contains a high proportion of taxa that may just as well still exist, but are listed here due to any combination of absence of recent records, a known threat such as habitat destruction, and an observed decline.

Struthioniformes

The Ostrich and related ratites.

Tinamiformes

Tinamous

Anseriformes

Ducks, geese and swans.

Galliformes

Quails and relatives.

Charadriiformes

Shorebirds, gulls and auks.
