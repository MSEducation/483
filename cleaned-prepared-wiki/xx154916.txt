Steven Philip Cheetham (born 5 September 1987) is an English cricketer. He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler who plays for Lancashire. He was born in Oldham, Greater Manchester, and attended Bury Grammar School. Cheetham, who also plays local league cricket for Heywood Cricket Club, made his Second XI debut back in 2005. Cheetham is a tailend batsman within the Second XI line-up along with team-mate Gaurav Dhar. He has recently spent six months over in Australia playing for Cheltenham Cricket Club, a local Melbourne side where he took 34 wickets at an average of 13.80, including a hat-trick in the semi final against Old Mentonians.

Career

Lancashire

Steven Cheetham made his debut in first-class cricket in a match between Lancashire and Durham University in April 2007. He didn't bat, although recorded bowling figures of no wickets for 83Â runs (0/83) in the first innings and 1/44 in the second.

On loan to Surrey

On 4 August 2010, Cheetham moved to Surrey until the end of the 2010 season on loan. With limited opportunities to play first-team cricket at Lancashire, there was a greater chance to play at Surrey who at the time had suffered injuries to their bowling attack. According to Chris Adams, Surrey's cricket manager, "Steven is a young bowler with terrific physical attributes, who bowls wicket to wicket and is very much at the start of his career".
Following an injury to Lancashire captain and bowler Glen Chapple in September, Cheetham was recalled early from his stint with Surrey.
