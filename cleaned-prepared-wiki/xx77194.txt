UIQ (formerly known as User Interface Quartz) by UIQ Technology is a software platform based upon Symbian OS. Essentially this is a graphical user interface layer that provides additional components to the core OS, to enable the development of feature-rich mobile phones that are open to expanded capabilities through third-party applications.

History

On November 7, 2006, Sony Ericsson announced they had agreed (in principle) to buy UIQ from Symbian Ltd. and run it as a separate subsidiary. The UIQ products would be "openly available, licensed on equal terms to all its licensees". The sale will complete in the next few months "pending regulatory approval and customary closing conditions". The acquisition was completed in February 2007.
On October 15, 2007, Sony Ericsson and Motorola, Inc. announced an agreement for Motorola to purchase a 50% interest in UI Holdings BV, the parent company of UIQ Technology. The two companies worked and invested jointly in the development of UIQ.
UIQ Technology was based in Ronneby, Sweden and situated in the Soft Center Science & Research Park. The first General Manager was Peter Molin and the first Product Manager was Martin Hill. Johan Sanderg was appointed General Mamager in 2000.

UIQ Programming Languages

Native applications can be written in C++ using the Symbian/UIQ SDK. All UIQ-based phones (2.x and 3.x) also support Java applications.
Version 2.x and 3.x are pen-based and used in the following 2.5G and 3G smartphones: Sony Ericsson P800/P900/P910/P990/M600/W950/P1/W960/G700/G900, BenQ P30/P31 and Arima U300/U308, Nokia 6708, Motorola A920/A925/A1000/M1000/Z8/Z10.
UIQ phones employ touch screens with a resolution of 208×320 pixels (UIQ 1.x & 2.x) and 240×320 (UIQ 3.x). Depending on the phone, the color depth is 12-bit (4096 colors), 16-bit (65536 colors), 18-bit (262144 colors), and 24-bit (16,777,216 colors) on some newer phones.

UIQ Iterations since Symbian v9.1

UIQ 3.0 was the first  Symbian v9.1 Operating System. One of the main tweaks that has been done with the UIQ version was the GUI which now supports both Touchscreen and Non-Touchscreen Navigation.

The new version still uses the v3.1 SDK, same goes for the OS version which is also based on Symbian v9.2
UIQ 3.3 comes as a major update from the UIQ 3.2 and is built on top of the Symbian v9.3. the new iteration integrates the Opera Mobile v9.5 alongside with widgets support handled by the Dash Board application. The new application is accessible with the widget button that will be incorporated on the following UIQ 3.3 phones. furthermore the new version had supported JSR 248 (MSA or 'M'obile 'S'ervices 'A'rchitecture) Fullset API from Java and at the same time broughts Unified Messaging Platform at the forefront. Menu UIs are furtherly refurbished and Transitions were longer than the past versions. No devices was released for this edition.
A new UIQ optimized for Touchscreen interface was under development, several screenshots were shown at the Smartphone show on October and is reported to make use for Touch Screen more efficient than the earlier versions. UIQ Fan base from different Mobile Phone Fan Sites refer this as the UIQ 4.
