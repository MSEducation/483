History

The Briad Group was founded in October 1987 by Brad Honigfeld when he opened his first franchise of Steve's Ice Cream/Carnegie Deli in Princeton, New Jersey. The company opened a Roy Rogers restaurant in North Brunswick Township, New Jersey in 1988 and continued to grow its restaurant business. In 1993, the company opened its first T.G.I. Friday's restaurant in central New Jersey. After the success in its casual-dining division, the company turned the attention to its quick-service division. It discontinued Roy Rogers and started converting into Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers.
In 1997, the company started its hotel business by becoming an operator of a Marriott hotel and a Hilton hotel in 2002. It has developed and operated under these two brands in a dozen of properties.
On July 31, 2013, the company agreed to pay a fine of $500,000 as well as to one year of state monitoring for duping customers at into thinking they were buying premium liquor, when in fact they were being served cheaper brands. According to New Jersey authorities, eight of the company's restaurants were found to have switched expensive liquor, and in one case, a T.G.I. Friday's mixed rubbing alcohol with caramel food coloring and served it as scotch.

Main Street Restaurant Group

Main Street Restaurant Group, Inc. was founded in 1988 to operate food distribution in Phoenix, Arizona. Main Street purchased four T.G.I. Friday's restaurants from T.G.I. Friday's Inc. in 1990 to establish its restaurant operation. The company had aggressively purchased properties and franchise rights from independent operators in many states from 1991 to 1993. The company finally sold its food distribution business and focused solely on restaurant business with development of additional brands. In 2006, Main Street had 56 T.G.I. Friday's, and a dozen of restaurants under other brands. It was the world's largest T.G.I.
