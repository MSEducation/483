Avatar Land is a themed area currently being constructed at Disney's Animal Kingdom in Lake Buena Vista, Florida based upon the film franchise by James Cameron.

History

In Spring 2011, James Cameron was approached by The Walt Disney Company's chief executive officer, Bob Iger, regarding the possibility of Avatar-themed attractions in Walt Disney Parks & Resorts. On September 17, 2011, a long-term, exclusivity deal was signed between Disney, James Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment and 20th Century Fox.

Design

Avatar Land is designed by Walt Disney Imagineering with Avatar producers James Cameron and Jon Landau also providing creative assistance. James Cameron confirmed that a flying attraction featuring "3-D projections and creature designs that were cut from the original film" was a concept on the drawing board for the area. Avatar Land will include elements from the original Avatar film as well as its three, yet-to-be-released sequels.

Attractions

At the 2013 Japan D23 Expo, Disney revealed two major attractions.

Location

Avatar Land is being built in the former location of Camp Minnie-Mickey,
