The 1985 WAFL season was the 101st season of the West Australian Football League and its various incarnations. The season opened on 30 March and concluded on 21 September with the 1985 WAFL Grand Final contested between .
It was highlighted by the rise of Subiaco, who had nearly become extinct in the late 1970s due to financial problems and had won only 25.2 percent of its games between 1975 and 1984. The Lions recovered from a mid-season slump to win their last seven games before the finals – their longest winning streak in one season since 1915See Christian, Geoff; "Subiaco's Winning Streak the Best for 12 Years"; The West Australian, 19 August 1985, p. 88 –  and challenge East Fremantle. The Sharks came off their 1984 Grand Final loss to win their first twelve on end – being quoted at odds of 25/1 to achieve a perfect seasonChristian, Geoff; "What Price Sharks to Stay Unbeaten"; The West Australian, 27 May 1985, pp. 79, 84 – and seal the minor premiership with four games remaining, in a thrilling Grand Final. Major declines occurred from Claremont, who had their worst season since 1977, and East Perth, who began a sequence of five seasons with only 24 wins, two wooden spoons (their first since 1964) and two near-misses.
