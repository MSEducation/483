USS ''Oregon'' (BB-3) was a pre-dreadnought  of the United States Navy. Her construction was authorized on 30 June 1890, and the contract to build her was awarded to Union Iron Works of San Francisco, California on 19 November 1890. Her keel was laid exactly one year later. She was launched on 26 October 1893, sponsored by Miss Daisy Ainsworth, delivered to the Navy on 26 June 1896, and commissioned on 15 July 1896 with Captain H.L. Howison in command. Later she was commanded by Captain Albert S. Barker throughout the Spanish-American War.
Oregon served for a short time with the Pacific Squadron before being ordered on a voyage around South America to the East Coast in March 1898 in preparation for war with Spain. She departed from San Francisco on 19 March, and reached Jupiter Inlet 66 days later, a journey of 14,000 nautical miles (26,000 km; 16,000 mi). This was considered a remarkable achievement at the time. The journey popularized the ship with the American public and demonstrated the need for a shorter route, which led to construction of the Panama Canal. After completing her journey Oregon was ordered to join the blockade at Santiago as part of the North Atlantic Squadron under Rear Admiral Sampson. She took part in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, where she and the cruiser  were the only ships fast enough to chase down the Spanish cruiser Cristóbal Colón, forcing its surrender. Around this time she received the nickname "Bulldog of the Navy", most likely because of her high bow wave—known as "having a bone in her teeth" in nautical slang—and perseverance during the cruise around South America and the battle of Santiago.
After the war Oregon was refitted and sent back to the Pacific. She served for a year in the Philippines during the Philippine–American War and then spent a year in China at Wusong during the Boxer Rebellion before returning to the United States for an overhaul. In March 1903 Oregon returned to Asiatic waters and stayed there for three years, decommissioning in April 1906. Oregon was recommissioned in August 1911, but saw little activity and was officially placed on reserve status in 1914. After the United States joined World War I in 1917 Oregon acted as one of the escorts for transport ships during the Siberian Intervention. In October 1919, she was decommissioned for the final time. As a result of the Washington Naval Treaty, Oregon was declared "incapable of further warlike service" in January 1924. In June 1925 she was loaned to the State of Oregon, who used her as a floating monument and museum in Portland.
In February 1941, Oregon was redesignated IX–22. Due to the outbreak of World War II it was decided that the scrap value of the ship was more important than her historical value, so she was sold. Her stripped hulk was later returned to the Navy and used as an ammunition barge during the battle of Guam, where she remained for several years. USCGC Tupelo (WLB-303) assisted towing Oregon to Guam. During a typhoon in November 1948, she broke loose and drifted out to sea. She was located 500 miles southeast of Guam and towed back. She was sold on 15 March 1956 and scrapped in Japan.

Design and construction

Oregon was constructed from a modified version of a design drawn up by a policy board in 1889 for a short-range battleship. The original design was part of an ambitious naval construction plan to build 33 battleships and 167 smaller ships. The United States Congress saw the plan as an attempt to end the U.S. policy of isolationism and did not approve it, but a year later approved funding for three coast defense battleships, which would become Oregon and her sister ships 
Construction of the ships was authorized on 30 June 1890 and the contracts for Indiana and Massachusetts were awarded to William Cramp & Sons in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They also offered to build Oregon,

Service history

Journey around South America

Oregon was commissioned on 16 July 1896 under the command of Captain H.L. Howison as the first United States battleship on the Pacific Coast. In the winter of 1897–1898 she was put in drydock where bilge keels were installed to improve her stability. She left dock on 16 February 1898 after receiving news that the 
On 19 March Oregon started on the first leg of her journey, departing from San Francisco and steaming to Callao, Peru. She arrived in Callao on 4 April and replenished her coal. Her next stop would have been Valparaíso, Chile, but Clark decided to press on. Oregon entered the Strait of Magellan on 16 April, where she encountered a severe storm. She was forced to anchor on a rocky shelf during the night and proceed the next day through the narrow passage and to Punta Arenas, Chile. While refueling she was joined by the gunboat 
The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships describes the effect of the journey on the American public and government as follows: "On one hand the feat had demonstrated the many capabilities of a heavy battleship in all conditions of wind and sea. On the other it swept away all opposition for the construction of the Panama Canal, for it was then made clear that the country could not afford to take two months to send warships from one coast to the other each time an emergency arose."

Spanish–American War

Oregon proceeded to the naval base at Key West, where she was attached to the North Atlantic Squadron under Rear Admiral William T. Sampson. They had just received word that Commodore Winfield Scott Schley's Flying Squadron had found the Spanish fleet and was blockading them in the port of Santiago de Cuba. Sampson reinforced the blockade on 1 June
In an attempt to break the stalemate, it was decided to attack Santiago from land. An expeditionary force, under the command of Major General William Rufus Shafter, landed east of the city and attacked it on 1 July.
When the Spanish fleet steamed out of the harbor at 9:00 on 3 July,
The battle of Santiago de Cuba was a complete victory for the United States and left Spain without a navy. Santiago capitulated on 17 July and the war itself ended less than a month later on 12 August.

Asiatic Station

After the war the United States annexed the Spanish colonies of Guam, Puerto Rico and the Philippines.
On 29 August she steamed again for China, this time to serve as a station ship at Woosung, the port town of Shangai. She stayed there until 5 May 1901, when she departed for the United States to be overhauled in the Puget Sound Navy Yard.

Second Commission

In 1911 a reserve fleet on the Pacific coast was formed,
From 11 February 1916 – 7 April 1917, she was placed in commission in reserve, this time at San Francisco. Returned to full commission again on the latter date, Oregon remained first on the West Coast, then acted as one of the escorts for transports of the Siberian Intervention. On 12 June 1919 she was decommissioned at Bremerton. From 21 August – 4 October, she was recommissioned briefly and was the reviewing ship for President of the United States Woodrow Wilson during the arrival of the Pacific Fleet at Seattle.

Inter-war period

With the adoption of ship classification symbols on 17 July 1920, Oregon was redesignated BB-3.
In 1921, a movement was begun to preserve the battleship as an object of historic and sentimental interest, and to lay her up permanently at some port in the state of Oregon.
In accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty, Oregon was rendered incapable of further warlike service on 4 January 1924, and was retained on the Naval Vessel Register as a naval relic with a classification of "unclassified". In June 1925, she was loaned to the state of Oregon, restored, and moored at Portland, Oregon, as a floating monument and museum.
On 17 February 1941, when identifying numbers were assigned to unclassified vessels, Oregon was redesignated IX-22.

Fate

With the outbreak of World War II, it was deemed that the ship should be scrapped. Accordingly, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 2 November 1942 and sold on 7 December. On that day, one year after the attack on Pearl Harbor, a parade commemorating the ship marched through the streets of downtown Portland. Congressman Lyndon B. Johnson delivered the keynote speech, and the front page of The Oregonian included a fifteen-stanza ode to the ship by Ben Hur Lampman. The poem ended:

She was sold for $35,000 and towed to Kalama, Washington in March 1943 for dismantling.
The hulk of the old battleship remained at Guam for several years. During a typhoon on 14–15 November 1948, she broke her moorings and drifted out to sea. On 8 December 1948, she was located by search planes  southeast of Guam and towed back. She was sold for $208,000 on 15 March 1956 to the Massey Supply Corporation, a large salvage operation owned by Lester M. Dean, Sr., of Kansas City, Missouri.  After salvaging and retaining much of the teak wood from the decks and officers' quarters of the USS Oregon, the ship, with all its steel plate, was resold to the Iwai Sanggo Company, and finally towed by Dean to Kawasaki, Japan, and scrapped.

Surviving pieces

Her mast survives as a memorial located in Tom McCall Waterfront Park in Portland, Oregon. On 4 July 1976, a time capsule was sealed in the base of the memorial. The time capsule is scheduled to be opened on 5 July 2076.
Oregons two funnels were preserved for a time at a separate location, in Portland's Liberty Ship Memorial Park. In 2006, the funnels were put into storage and the park (always on private property) became part of the Waterfront Pearl condominium development.
During the dismantling of the ship during World War II, small 3" by 3" sections of the ship's wooden decking and interior were used as incentives for selling war bonds. Purchase of a certain number of bonds would allow the buyer to claim a small piece of the ship. This program was highly successful and resulted in a large number of bonds being sold in the Portland area. Other items from the ship's interior were also auctioned for war bonds at this time, such as the pool table from the officers' mess.
The teak wood salvaged from the ship by Lester Dean, Sr. has been fashioned, at the direction of son, Lester Dean, Jr., into a conference room table, reception table and armoire.  The pieces are housed, along with one of the portholes of the Oregon, in a board room dedicated to the battleship and entrepreneurial spirit of once owner of the Oregon, Dean, Sr.  The office suite is managed by the real estate company founded by Lester Dean, Sr., Dean Realty Co., in Kansas City, Missouri.
