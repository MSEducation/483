History

The tradition of the Via Crucis in Spain began with the Dominican Fray Álvaro of Córdoba in 1421, but was popularized mainly by Franciscans. Romero Mensaque, La Cruz del Campo y el Vía Crucis, Consejo General de Hermandades y Cofradías de Sevilla. Accessed online 2010-01-10.  It is a local recreation of what is now called the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem, by then an established feature of a pilgrimage there, though various routes have been used.
With reference to the Via Crucis in Seville, and especially with reference to the Templete (see below) for events of the 15th and 16th century a great deal of historical caution is in order. Evidence is incomplete and sometimes contradictory. It is difficult to be confident of the continuity between entities with the same name mentioned centuries apart. The difficulties are compounded by the tendency of most sources to give only one version of events, even when the facts are in doubt. Accessed online 2010-01-10. Moreno Navarro indicates, in particular, the difficulty in sorting the evidence about the origin and early years of the humilladero that became the Templete and of the Hermandad de los Negritos itself.

De Gelo follows Romero Mensaque in emphasizing that other historians have greatly exaggerated the importance of the Cruz de Campo, mistakenly believing it always to have been the terminus of the Via Crucis, and, related to that, presuming that confraternities were strongly affiliated with the Via Crucis and the processions of Holy Week since their inception, a matter he considers unproven at best.

Both of these sources, especially de Gelo, are also useful as a review of academic and scholarly sources on the subject.[/ref]
On 20 October 1520, Don Fadrique Enríquez de Rivera, First Marquis of Tarifa, returned from a trip through Europe and the Holy Land. During Lent in 1521, he inaugurated the observance in Seville of the Holy Via Crucis.

In keeping with the theme of Christ's Passion, the procession became strongly associated with penitence through self-flagellation.com, accessed online 2010-01-11. In 1604, Cardinal Fernando Niño de Guevara issued a series of reforms intended to rein in the tendency of the processions of flagellants to take on the character of a carnival. The brotherhoods and confraternities were formally recognized, but also brought under a set of rules. Schedules were established; nocturnal processions were banned (although that particular provision would soon lapse);) the Cathedral of Seville in the city proper and the Church of Santa Ana across the river in Triana as Stations of Penitence, rather than each group beginning its route at a location of its own choosing.

Processions of flagellants were banned in Spain in 1777, as were most midnight processions; the processions of Holy Week in Seville were excepted from the latter prohibition.

On 8 March 1957 the descendants of the Marquis of Tarifa reestablished the Via Crucis.

The route

The original Via Crucis initiated by the Marquis of Tarifa began inside the Casa de Pilatos in the Chapel of the Flagellations and ended at a pillar near the current Templete (small temple). Beginning in 1630, both the beginning and end of the route changed, beginning at the current shrine with its marble altarpiece erected that year on the façade of the Casa de Pilatos, and ending at the Templete. The simple wooden Cruz de las Toallas (literally "Cross of the Towels") that previously marked the first station passed into the possession of the Hermandad de los Negritos (for whom see below). 
The practice of the time would have meant that the original Via Crucis of 1521 would have had seven stations, quite different from the current ones: the garden of Gethsemane; the house of the Sanhedrin, Annas; the house of Sanhedrin Caiaphas; the house of Pontius Pilate; the palace of Herod; a return to Pilate's house; and finally the hill of Calvary. Another difference from the current Via Crucis would have been that it would not initially have had such a character of an urban procession: by the fourth station, the procession would left the walled city and would be walking through orchards, countryside, and the scattered building on the fringes of the city. It is unclear whether the wooden crosses that initially marked the stations were permanently installed or put in place only for the Lenten season.
Eventually, this changed to a configuration more like the present one. In 1720 the last two stations were added, for a total of 14, resulting in the current route followed by each of the various confraternities who process through the city during Holy Week, which runs roughly  The azulejos at each station include both a picture and a written caption.

The Templete

Everything about the origin and early years of the original humilladero (a type of roadside shrine,Vox Diccionario Inglés-Español Español-Inglés, Barcelona: Biblograf, 1966. p. 1109. often at the entrance to a town) that later became the Templete is uncertain; similarly for the religious order believed to have first built it.
The Templete is traditionally dated from 1380,Javier Macías gives this date without qualification. although some sources give a date as late as 1460. It was almost certainly constructed by the cofradía (confraternity) or hermandad (brotherhood) de negros or de negritos of Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles; it was in any case closely associated with them. That confraternity was very probably founded in the 14th century by archbishop Gonzalo de Mena; although their current Rule dates only from 1554, it is certain that they existed before that. Another chapter of the same work, Las Reglas de 1554: integración religiosa y afirmación étnica discusses this at greater length. Accessed online 2010-01-10.Isidoro Moreno Navarro, Don Gonzalo de Mena y su fundación para negros, part of La Antigua Hermandad de los Negros de Sevilla, Hermandad de los Negritos (Seville). Accessed online 2010-01-10. In the interior of the original humilladero was a wooden cross. In that period, the modest structure was known as the Cruz del Campo ("Country Cross" or "Cross of the Field") because it stood outside the city walls. By the early 16th century, the site had already become associated with Lent and penitence. 
Sources indicate that it was in 1482Carlos J. Romero Mensaque gives this date without qualification, as does the generally article cited from the site of the Hermandad de los Negritos. that the corregidorJosé L. García, La Pía Unión estudiará el sábado el mal estado del templete de la Cruz de Campo, ABC Sevilla, 2000-02-24, p. 50. Accessed online 2010-01-11. or asistente of Seville, Don Diego de Merlo, substituted a stone cross and covered it with a Templete in the Mudéjar style,  in height. That date seems particularly probable because that year the archdiocese received an ostensible relic of the True Cross. However, the words written inside the dome of the Templete giving that date only date from 1881. García, Un sinfín de restauraciones, ABC Sevilla, 2000-02-24, p. 50. Accessed online 2010-01-11.
Fadrique Enríquez de Rivera, first Marquis of Tarifa, restored the Templete when he initiated the Via Crucis in 1521. In 1536, the Marquis bought the Templete (previously owned by the brothers of the Monastery of San Benito Abad), and moved it to its current location. The current marble cross carved with images of Jesus and Mary (which replaced the earlier wooden cross) is attributed to Juan Bautista Vázquez "The Elder", and dates from 1571. In either 1624 or 1648 there was a further restoration by Pedro Caballero de Illescas. In 1630 it became the endpoint of the Via Crucis. In 1880 municipal architect Aurelio Alvarez did work to improve its structural integrity, and the following year Juaquín Guichot did some work, writing inside the dome that the structure dates from 1482. Metal strapping was added for structural purposes in 1888; further work was done in 1899, 1912, and 1963, but in general the structure continued to deteriorate.
In 1996, the union of confraternities involved in the Holy Week observances suggested moving the Templete to the intersection of the Avenida de Andalucía and the Ronda de Tamarguillo, but the city government rejected the idea. In 2000, José L. García of ABC Sevilla wrote of the "sad aspect" of a monument on a busy street "practically asphyxiated by modern buildings", much vandalized, with its interior turned into a filthy nest of pigeons. García, La Pía Unión estudiará el sábado el mal estado del templete de la Cruz de Campo, ABC Sevilla, 2000-02-24, p. 50. Accessed online 2010-01-11. "En la actualidad, el monumento ofrece un triste aspecto, prácticamente asfixiado por construcciones modernas y a pie de la transitada avenida de Andalucía, cuyo tráfico incesante ha terminado por dañarlo casi tanto como el vandalismo que ha roto la verja de hierro que, precicamente para evitar el vandalismo, le fue colocada a finales del siglo pasado. Hoy, el templete sirve de gran nido de palomas, cuyos excremente lo cubren por entero en su interior..."
In 1904 a brewery had been built nearby and took the name Cervezas Cruzcampo; it is now Heineken España. Accessed online 2010-01-10. After innumerable years of promises by many entities to restore the deteriorating structure of the Templete (which has been owned by the city of Seville since at least the 19th century,) work finally began in 2007, paid for by the Fundación Cruzcampo (founded by the brewery company),Francisco Correal, El templete se abre con todas las bendiciones, Diario de Sevilla, 2008-03-27.
