Shaun Barker (born 19 September 1982) is an English footballer who plays for Derby County as a defender, where he is also captain.

Career

Rotherham United

Born in Trowell, Nottinghamshire, Barker started his career at Rotherham as a junior making his debut in March 2003 against Brighton & Hove Albion. On 7 May 2003 he was named as the club's "Young Player of the Year".

Blackpool

Barker joined Blackpool on 2 August 2006 on a free transfer, after turning down two offers of a new contract from Rotherham. Although he was signed originally as a centre-half, he was used as a right-back.
His first goal for Blackpool was a last-minute winner against Dario Gradi's Crewe Alexandra on 21 October 2006, ten minutes after The Seasiders had been reduced to ten men through Simon Gillett's dismissal.
For the 2008–09 season, Rob Edwards was named as the "on-field" captain, with Barker as vice-captain and club captain.
In the second half of the 2008–09 season, when Tony Parkes took over as caretaker manager, "Reggie", as he is known by Blackpool supporters, was moved to his usual centre-back role and cemented his place in that position. His performances led to his being linked with a move to Derby County, which Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston angrily dismissed, saying that "we've not had an offer from Derby... so unless anything changes drastically between now and August then he Barker will be starting here next season".

Derby County

Barker joined Derby County on 15 July 2009, for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around £900,000, signing a three-year contract. his second successive Player of the Year award after winning Blackpool's 2008/09 award. Whilst Derby finished midtable in 2009/10, Barker's former club Blackpool earned promotion to the Premier League leading some observers to suggest he might regret the decision to move to a supposed bigger club. Of this Barker said, 
Barker was named Derby's Vice Captain ahead of the 2010/11 campaign 
As a result, Barker missed the first 16 games of the following season, returning to action in a reserve fixture against Sheffield United on 15 November 2011.
Because he would miss the 2012–13 season due to his injury, Barker was not given a squad number, with Nigel Clough allocating his no.5 shirt to Jake Buxton. Despite this, Clough stated that Barker will play an "important part" in the season as club captain despite being on the sidelines all season.
As expected Barker was unable to return to fitness from pre-season ahead of the 2013–14 season, with an exact timeframe of a return unsure.
