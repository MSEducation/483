[[File:Annual severe thunderstorm watch frequency in the United States.

A severe thunderstorm watch (SAME code: SVA; sometimes referred to as "blue box" or "yellow box" by meteorologists and storm chasers) is issued when weather conditions are favorable for the development of severe thunderstorms. If thunderstorms are expected to be of sufficient strength such that there is a significant risk that they may produce tornadoes, then a tornado watch (which also automatically implies that severe thunderstorms are possible) is issued. A severe thunderstorm watch can also be upgraded to a tornado watch if conditions originally forecasted for limited to no tornadic development change to allow possible tornado formation (in which case the existing severe thunderstorm watch, or a portion of it, would be replaced). A watch must not be confused with a severe thunderstorm warning.
A watch does not necessarily mean that severe weather is actually occurring, only that atmospheric conditions have created a significant risk for severe weather to occur. If severe weather actually does occur, a severe thunderstorm warning or tornado warning will be issued, and urgent action should be taken immediately. While a severe thunderstorm watch does not imply in its name the risk for tornadoes, the risk for tornadoes in such a scenario is not necessarily zero as severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do spawn tornadoes even after only a severe thunderstorm watch has been issued.
In the United States, the Storm Prediction Center (a national guidance center of the National Weather Service (NWS)) issues watches for areas of the lower 48 states that are likely to produce tornadoes and/or severe thunderstorms. The local NWS forecast offices in Hawaii and Alaska issue their own Severe Thunderstorm and Tornado Watches. 
The terms "blue box" and "yellow box" refer to the assigned coloring used for watch box outlines used in Storm Prediction Center and National Weather Service products as well as by television broadcast media (in the case of the latter, blue is typically assigned to highlight severe thunderstorm watches whereas yellow is often assigned to severe thunderstorm warnings).
The watch boxes (or weather watches, WWs) are usually issued in the format of x miles north and south, or east and west, or either side of a line from y miles direction of city, state, to z miles another direction of another city, state. For example: "50 miles either side of a line from 10 miles northeast of Columbia, South Carolina to 15 miles south-southwest of Montgomery, Alabama". ("Either side" means perpendicular to the center line.) When displayed on a map, they are usually shown as either a blue or yellow outline, depending on the source. In addition, a list of all counties included in its area of responsibility is now issued by each local NWS forecast office for each watch.
In the event that a Severe Thunderstorm Watch is likely to lead to very destructive winds or hail (usually from a major derecho event), enhanced wording with the words Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) can be added to the watch. This is rare with Severe Thunderstorm Watches, since the tornado threat has to remain low enough to only warrant a Severe Thunderstorm Watch and a higher tornado threat would warrant a normal Tornado Watch despite the extreme wind or hail threat. It is far more common with Tornado Watches.
Similar watches and warnings are issued by Environment Canada's Meteorological Service of Canada

Watch Outline Updates and Status Messages

Watch Outline Updates are relayed (and at the initial watch issuance, issued) by the Storm Prediction Center, however it is the local National Weather Service Weather Forecast Offices that decide what counties (in their warning area) are included or excluded in the watch, via a conference call with the SPC. As a result, watch products will sometimes display counties inside the watch outline that are not included in the counties listed, and vice versa; however the local Weather Forecast Office will need to expand to add these counties into the watch. A Watch Status Message works in a similar fashion; the SPC designates which areas it thinks where a threat still exists (the most common designation for this is on the basis of the location of surface features such as cold fronts and drylines that would delineate where the threat of severe thunderstorms has ended and where it will remain a possibility), and the NWS offices decide what counties to remove from the watch (the local offices will almost always follow the SPC recommendation on the status messages).crh.gov/product_sites.
