Total fertility rate

Norway has one of the highest fertility rates in Europe. Norwegian women had as many as 4.6 children on average in the late 19th century; more than ten children was not unusual. Later, it has decreased dramatically from 2.7 in the late 1960s to 1.6 in the early 1980s, however it has increased to almost 1.9 today.

Ethnicity

Ethnically, the residents of Norway are predominantly ethnic Norwegians who are of North Germanic / Nordic descent, although there are communities of the Scandinavian native people Sami who settled the area around 8,000 years ago, probably from continental Europe through the Norwegian coast and through Finland along the inland glaciers. The national minorities of Norway include Scandinavian Romani, Roma (AKA gypsies), Jews, and Kvener, as well as a small Finnish community.
In the last decades, Norway has become home to increasing numbers of immigrants, foreign workers, and asylum-seekers from various parts of the world. Norway had a steady influx of immigrants from South Asia (mostly Pakistanis and Sri Lankans), East Asia (mainly the Chinese), and Southeast Asia (i.e. Filipinos), Eastern Europe (i.e. Russians and Poles), Southern Europe (Greeks, Albanians and people from former Yugoslavia etc.), and Middle Eastern countries (especially Iraqis and Palestinians), as well as Somalis, Turks, Moroccans, and some Latin Americans. After ten Eastern European and Baltic countries joined the EU in 2004, there has also been a substantial influx of people from Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
As of 2012, an official study shows that 86.2% are migrants and their descendants; numbering 110 000 second generation migrants born in Norway.
Of these 660 000 immigrants and their descendants:

Statistics Norway. 26 April 2012. Accessed 27 April 2012. Archived 7 August 2011.
Immigrants were represented in all Norwegian municipalities. 
The cities or municipalities with the highest share of immigrants in 2012 was Oslo (26 percent) and Drammen (18 percent). januar 2012 Statistics Norway, retrieved 30 March 2013 The share in Stavanger was 16%.  According to Reuters, Oslo is the "fastest growing city in Europe because of increased immigration". "Factbox – facts about Norway". Reuters. 22 July 2011. Accessed 22 July 2011. In recent years, immigration has accounted for most of Norway's population growth. In 2011 16% of newborn children were of immigrant background.

Immigration

As of 2012, an official study shows that the quotient of the total population that is either born outside Norway, or has one or two parents born abroad, or has one or more grandparents born abroad is 1 100 000 to 5 017 500 (which equals 21.9 percent).SSB: 1,1 million nordmenn har «innvandrerbakgrunn»

Religion

The Lutheran Church of Norway is the former state church and the vast majority remain at least nominal members. Other religions do, however, enjoy religious freedom and have prospered with immigration in recent years, particularly Islam and Roman Catholicism. Saint Olaf is the patron saint of Norway. He is regarded by some as the eternal king and has a reputation and place in history unchallenged by any other Norwegian King for the last 1000 years.
