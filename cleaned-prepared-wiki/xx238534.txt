He was born 14 June 1865 in Winchester, England to Thomas Shewell Morris (1832-1877) and Harriet Chick (d.1865 in childbirth). G. & Gold, S. M. (1989) Morris of Reading: a family of architects.

Following his apprenticeship, he obtained work in London between 1885 and 1890 with architect James Martin Brooks. Despite this training he seems not to have registered with the Royal Institute of British Architects.Correspondence between Mr Gold and British Architectural Library held in biographical file on Talwin Morris at Library of Royal Institute of British Architects
From 1891 he took up post as sub art-editor under M. H. Spielmann for Black and White, a weekly magazine published by Cassell, designing many of its decorative initials and headpieces. By 1892 he had also designed the masthead of Cassell's Saturday Journal.co. His occupation on the marriage certificate is listed as 'clerk'. (1983) Talwin Morris: an exhibition.

Responding to an advertisementThe Times, 21 February 1893 for an Art Director for publishers Blackie and Son, he moved to Glasgow in May 1893 where he soon made the acquaintance of the artists and designers associated with the Glasgow School of Art. Although he never attended the School, Morris soon became friends with Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his contemporaries, and his own work quickly began to incorporate Glasgow Style motifs.
In July 1893 he and Alice purchased Dunglass Castle and began to design its interiors. J. W.

In 1902 also he introduced Mackintosh to his employer Walter Blackie, which led to Mackintosh receiving the commission to design Blackie's home, Hill House, Helensburgh.glasgowsculpture.php?sub=morris_t# In 1910 he designed the memorial of his employers the Blackie Family in Glasgow Necropolis.
Morris himself became hugely influential in Victorian book design by moving away from the popular narrative bindings of the time to a more modern Art Nouveau approach where line, curve and decoration are used to entice the reader. (2004) 'The Art Nouveau book designs of Talwin Morris', Amphora, 135, June, pp.4-8. Available:  He also designed books for Morison Brothers of Glasgow, Cassell, J. G. Cotta of Stuttgart, Mudie's Select Library, and from 1898 the Blackie subsidiary Gresham. (1981) 'Talwin Morris and the Glasgow Style: Part II', Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society Newsletter, 29, Spring/Summer, pp.8-10 In 1906 he also supplied the cover design of the influential German magazine Dekorative Kunst. 5-8, February–March 1906 Though many of his book designs are unsigned, some feature his 'signature' of a single dash followed by a further two dashes (his reversed initials MT in morse code). During his tenure, Morris also commissioned book designs by designers such as Ethel Larcombe and Silver Studio.
Morris retired through ill-health in 1909 and died from a cardiac embolism on 29 March 1911 at just 45 years old. His one piece of formal writing, the 9th special supplement of the Press Art School titled 'The Illustration of Children's Books', was published posthumously in 1912.A copy is held in the British Library. His body lies in Dumbarton Cemetery, marked by a gravestone designed by his friend Charles Rennie Mackintosh at the behest of his widow Alice. The inscription reads "Love is more great than we conceive / and death is the keeper of unknown redemptions". See 
From 21–22 July 1924 books in the possession of his widow Alice were auctioned at Sotheby, Wilkinson & Hodge. Much of his design work for Blackie was sold at Sotheby's, London 1–2 June 1989 in the sale of the Blackie archives. A grille and stained-glass window for the Blackie headquarters in Stanhope Street, Glasgow (demolished in the 1960s) was sold the following month at Christie's, Glasgow. (1990) 'Talwin Morris (1865-1911): a checklist of works related to publishing', Private Library, 3(1) Spring, p.41 Posthumous exhibitions of his work were held at the William Morris Gallery from 23 August-2 October 1983, National Art Library from June–July 1990, and at Blackwell from 26 April-11 July 2005.
