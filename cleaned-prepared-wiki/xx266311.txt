The colour map shows the normalized electric field distribution, and the red arrows indicate the Poynting flux, which is proportional to the linear momentum of light in the vicinity of the motor. The Poynting flux is scattered/absorbed at the outer side of the arms, inducing a torque on the motor to drive it anticlockwise.

Introduction

The increased demands in microtechnology and nanotechnology  has been triggering the vast interests and  opportunities for the developments of various micro- (MEMS) and nano-(NEMS) mechanical system based products. One of the fascinating features of this technology is its unique ability to imitate various natural phenomena.; Henry H. Journal of Nanotechnology in Engineering and Medecine, Vol 1,February,2010 by designing the artificial ones using the nanoscale approach. It could certainly inspire the ideas behind the design of powerful devices. Mechanism of auto-regeneration of energy by microorganisms has drawn attention to understand how energy can be generated from nanomaterials.The primary concern behind such an approach is  to provide an alternative source with higher ability under controlled environment.The recent discovery in this field explains the use of wave and particle properties together to make the nanomotor work. This leads to observation of the so-called plasmonic nanomotor using the properties of plasmon to make the nanomotor work.L., Zia R., Schuller J.A., Applied Physics A: Materials Science & Processing,89,221-223(2007) Researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)'s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California (UC) Berkeley have created the first nano-sized light mill motor whose rotational speed and direction can be controlled by tuning the frequency of the incident light waves.

Background

Nanomotors are broadly classified into biological, hybrid and non-biological ones. Biological nanomotors are typically the microscopic engines created by the nature like the bacterial flagella which can come into motion by using  ATP synthase, produced within the cell. The man made counterpart is called a non-biological nanomotor and mimics the function of natural or biological nanomotor to allow the devices to work. However these man-made nanodevices are less efficient compared to the biological counterpart. They require certain functionalization to accelerate movement or to improve the functions of the artificial nanomotor. For instance incorporation of carbon nanotube into platinum component of asymmetric metal nanowire leads to its dramatically accelerated movement in hydrogen peroxide solution.Wei G. , Kalayil M. Manesh , Joe H., Sirilak S. ,and Joseph W; small 2011, 7, No. 14, 2047â€“2051 Motion from nanomotor could be resulted from optical, electrical, magnetic or chemical interactions . These principles are applied according to the scale of the materials we are dealing with. This relevant report pointed out that velocity, direction and rotation were strongly dependent on the nature of light (wavelength) coming into the motor.

Working Principle

Mostly photons exhibit linear momentum as well as the angular momentum. These properties attribute towards different phenomena like induction of mechanical torque, both in macro scale and nanoscale observations.
Plasmon is the resonant mode that involves the interaction between free charges and light.Free electrons in metals can be driven by the interaction of these plasomon waves of metals and the electric field, generated by the incident light. These phenomenon also modifies the light by influencing its electric and magnetic field.

Experimental Configuration

Based on the plasmonic concept, Liu and coworker demonstrated the plasmonic motor at nanoscale. The whole system was fabricated by using standard electron beam lithography.The imposed torque results solely from the gammadion structure's symmetry and interaction with the incident light.

Applications

Because of its size and driven energy, the nanoscale plasmonic motor could provide rotational force at nanoscale, which would be widely used in energy conversion and biology.

In biology

The structural dynamics of cellular processes such as replication and transcription could determine the mechanical properties of DNA. However, the effect of torque should be considered when measure DNA mechanics. Under low tension, DNA behaves like an isotropic flexible rods;where as  at higher tensions, the behaviour of over- and underwound molecules differ. Through obsever the twist angle of DNA, the elastic properties of DNA could be obtained.

The newly developed light-driven nanoscale motor could address the limitations of the earlier light mills. It generates comparable torque, which was made of gold and had much smaller size. At 100 nanometers  (one-tenth the size of other motors) it would make possible application like unwinding DNA in living cells. While the system is under controlled winding and unwinding of DNA, the small motor could be illuminated at different wavelengths for in vivo manipulation.

In energy conversion

The microelectromechanical system is different from the traditional electromechanical system. For the nanoscale plasmonic motor, it could harvest light energy through rotating microscopic-scale objects. In addition, nanoscale plasmonic motor could link transduction mechanisms in series (e.g., convert a thermal signal first into a mechanical signal, then into an optical signal,
and finally into an electrical signal).
So these motors could apply to solar light harvesting in nanoscopic systems through designing multiple motors to work at different resonance frequencies and single directions. And such multiple motor structures could be used to acquire torque from a broad wavelength range instead of a single frequency.

Limitations

In the past, nanoparticles were rotated  by exploiting the incident intrinsic movement of the light, but it is the first time to induce the rotation of a nanoparticle without exploiting the intrinsic angular momentum of light. 
Because the nanoscale plasmonic motor is a new technology, several problems are faced, such as the price of higher development costs, greater complexity and a longer development time.

And the workhorse methods and materials of nanometre-scale electromechanical system (NEMS) technology are not universally well suited to the nanoscale. The nanoscale plasmonic motor also have limitations in strength and flexibility.

Future plan

In the future, scientists will pay more attention to synthesis the efficiency of the light mills. The alternative materials for motor also will be developed to instead the expensive materials,such as gold, silicon, carbon nanotube. And the strength and flexibility of nanoscale plasmonic motor also will be improved.
