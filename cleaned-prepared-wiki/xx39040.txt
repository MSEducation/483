[[New Jersey Route 64]]

CATEGORIES: State highways in New Jersey, Transportation in Mercer County, New Jersey

Route 64 is a  long state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is a state-maintained bridge over Amtrak and New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor line in West Windsor. Route 64 begins at an intersection with County Route 526 and County Route 571 in West Windsor. It heads along the bridge to an intersection with County Route 615, where Route 64 ends. County routes 526 and 571, which are unofficially concurrent with Route 64, continues to Hightstown.
Route 64 was designated originally as an alignment of Route 31A, a spur off of State Highway Route 31 (currently U.S. Route 206) from Princeton eastward to Hightstown, where it met State Highway Route 33. The state planned on turning the alignment into a full-fledged expressway for several decades, including constructing the alignment that Route 64 currently uses in 1939. The route was amended in 1941, and was renumbered from Route 31A to Route 64 in the 1953 renumbering. Route 64 was proposed to become part of the Princeton–Hightstown Bypass (later designated New Jersey Route 92), but completion never occurred. Currently, the route remains the bridge over the Northeast Corridor. However, it is not currently planned that Route 64 will receive an extension of sorts from the proposed Penns Neck Bypass to U.S. Route 1, a proposed realignment of County routes 526 and 571.

Route description

From this point, County Routes 526 and 571 continue along the right-of-way towards U.S. Route 130. The route heads north crosses over the Amtrak and New Jersey Transit-used Northeast Corridor Line and passes to the north of a local bus depot.  Route 64 continues westward for a short distance, crossing through a local woodland and by several local homes. The route makes a gradual curve to the west off the railroad bridge and passes a couple of homes before heading to the south slightly at a jughandle. Route 64 reaches its northern terminus and County Route 526 and County Route 571 make a right turn to head northwest toward U.S. Route 1.

History

Route 31A and the original freeway

In the late-1920s, the state proposed a bypass along the alignment.
In 1938, the New Jersey State Highway Department and New Jersey General Assembly put forth a proposal detailing that a highway from State Highway Route 31 (co-signed with U.S. Route 206) in the city of Princeton eastward through Mercer County onto current-day County Route 571. From there, it would follow an alignment of highway to the intersection with State Highway Route 33 in the community of Hightstown. The original proposal for the highway was to turn the road into a limited-access freeway along its entirety. The route was designated as State Highway Route 31A, a suffixed spur of State Highway Route 31 that year. 
The new bridge remained in place along Route 31A, however, no new portions of the freeway were constructed in terms of creating the Route 31A Freeway, as proposed in 1938. In 1950, then-governor of New Jersey, Alfred E. Driscoll, cited the need for the expressway as an important truck and passenger car highway from Trenton to the Jersey Shore. The route was truncated from both ends toward Princeton and Hightstown, leaving just the bridge in West Windsor. Route 31A remained in the state highway statutes for several decades after decommissioning, with a bill in 1991 being proposed. The bill passed, and Route 31A was stripped from the statutes on January 18, 1992.

Route 92 and future changes to CR 571

Route 64, after designation in 1953, remained a short bridge along the highway.
As part of the proposed Penns Neck Bypass on U.S. Route 1, the New Jersey Department of Transportation plans on realigning County Route 571 and Route 526 from the western terminus of Route 64 to a northerly route to Route 1.
