Dennis Lawrence "Dan" McGann (July 15, 1871 – December 13, 1910), also known as Cap McGann, was a professional baseball player who played first base in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1896 to 1908. He was a member of the NL pennant-winning Brooklyn Superbas in 1899 and New York Giants in 1904 and 1905. He was also a member of the 1905 World Series champions.
After beginning his professional career in minor league baseball in 1895, McGann played in  MLB for the Boston Beaneaters (1896), Baltimore Orioles (1898), Brooklyn Superbas (1899), Washington Senators (1899), and St. Louis Cardinals (1900–1901) of the National League (NL) before jumping to the rival American League to play for the Baltimore Orioles in 1902. He returned to the NL, playing for the New York Giants (1902–1907) and Boston Doves (1908). In 1909–10, he played for the Milwaukee Brewers in the American Association.
McGann had a troubled personal life. He suffered from depression, and several members of his family committed suicide. After the 1910 season, with rumors of McGann signing with another minor league team, McGann committed suicide with a firearm.

Career

Early career (1891–1897)

McGann began his professional baseball career in minor league baseball with a team representing his hometown, Shelbyville, Kentucky, in 1891. He also played for Kentucky teams representing Harrodsburg in 1892, Lexington in 1893, and Maysville in 1894. McGann played for the Norfolk Clams/Crows of the Class-B Virginia State League in 1895 and the Lynchburg Hill Climbers of the Class-B Virginia League in 1896. He initially played all positions except for pitcher, catcher, and first baseman.
In August 1896, the Boston Beaneaters of the National League (NL) purchased McGann from Lynchburg to fill in for injured second baseman Bobby Lowe. McGann batted .322 with the Beaneaters, hitting for power, but he committed 21 errors in 43 games. The Beaneaters released him following the completion of the season. McGann played the 1897 season with the Toronto Canucks of the Class-A Eastern League. He moved to first base and batted .354, leading the Eastern League with 20 triples.

Major League Baseball (1898–1908)

The Washington Senators of the NL purchased McGann, Butts Wagner, Bob McHale and Cooney Snyder from Toronto for $8,500 ($ He played one season with the Orioles, in which he batted .301 with 106 runs batted in (RBI) in 1898, good for fifth place in the NL.
When Orioles manager Ned Hanlon was hired to manage the Brooklyn Superbas during the 1899 season, receiving an ownership stake in the team to  do so, he assigned several of his star players, including McGann, Joe McGinnity, Joe Kelley, Hughie Jennings and Willie Keeler to the Superbas. McGann finished second on the team in RBIs with 106, behind Kelley.
McGann batted .243 for the Superbas through July 14, 1899, when they traded him with Aleck Smith to the Senators for Deacon McGuire. For the Senators, McGann batted .343 during the rest of the 1899 season. Short on money, the Senators sold McGann and Gus Weyhing to the St. Louis Cardinals for $5,000 ($
With the formation of the American League (AL) as a competitor to the NL, McGann joined many fellow NL players who jumped to the AL. Following Cardinals teammate John McGraw, who became player-manager of the Baltimore Orioles of the AL before the 1901 season, McGann signed with the Orioles. 
However, the Orioles struggled with debt. Joe Kelley, star player for the Orioles and son-in-law of part-owner John Mahon, reported that the team owed as much as $12,000 ($
With the Giants, McGraw installed McGann at first base, moving Christy Mathewson to pitcher. McGann stole 36 bases in the 1903 season. After the season, McGann and some of his Giants teammates threatened to quit the team due to the treatment of Brush, now the Giants owner, for allegedly going back on a promise to provide the Giants with a monetary bonus for having the Giants finish in the top three of the NL and a share of the gate receipts from exhibition games, in which they were paid $56.35 ($
McGann stole 42 bases in 1904, finishing fourth in the NL. He stole five bases on May 27, 1904, setting an NL record.
McGann developed a reputation as a fighter in 1905. On April 21, 1905, in a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, McGann punched catcher Fred Abbott after McGann was thrown out at home plate. Abbott hit McGann in the back with the ball, resulting in both players being ejected from the game. Although McGann batted .235 in the series, he recorded four RBIs on three hits in a Game Three victory.
McGann was briefly suspended by NL president Harry Pulliam for fighting on May 16, 1906.
Before the 1907 season, a report surfaced that the Giants would shift Mike Donlin from the outfield to first base, in order to replace McGann. Donlin denied the claim. McGann suffered a broken wrist when he was hit by a pitch thrown by  Andy Coakley of the Cincinnati Reds during spring training in 1907. 
McGann returned to the Giants out of shape midway through the 1907 season, although he did bat .298 that season. That winter, trade rumours began to swirl that  the Giants would trade him to the Reds. When a reporter asked McGraw about McGann and Tenney, pointing out that both first basemen were 36 years old, McGraw replied that Tenney had taken better care of himself.
Despite discussion of appointing McGann player-manager of the Doves, the role was assigned to Kelley.

Later career (1909–1910)

McGann signed with the Milwaukee Brewers of  the Class-A American Association for the 1909 season. He played for Milwaukee in 1909 and 1910, batting only .225 in 1910, his career low. There were reports McGann might sign with the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League or a team in Louisville, Kentucky, near his Shelbyville home in 1911. McGann's career was ended, however, by his death in December 1910.
