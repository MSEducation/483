British Army

Murphy was born in Wexford in 1890. He joined the British Army in Belfast in 1915 as an officer cadet in the South Staffordshire Regiment. He became Commanding Officer of the 1st Battalion; the South Staffordshire Regiment in August 1918, reaching the rank of Temporary Lieutenant Colonel. In 1918, his regiment were posted to the Italian Front, at the Piave River where they were when the Armistice was declared on 4 November 1918.  He was granted the rank of substantive Lieutenant Colonel on the retired list on 16 May 1922.
After he returned to Ireland he resumed his career as a teacher. At some point he joined the Irish Republican Army – a guerrilla organisation fighting to end British rule in Ireland.Niall C Harrington, Kerry Landing, p37

Civil War

In December 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed between British and Irish leaders, resulting in the setting up of the Irish Free State. Conflict over the Treaty among Irish nationalists ultimately led to the outbeak of Civil War in June 1922.
In 1922 Murphy enlisted as a general in the new National Army of the Irish Free State. After the start of the Civil War, he was put in command of troops charged with taking posts held by the anti-Treaty IRA in Limerick.
At the Battle of Killmallock in July–August 1922, he was second in command to Eoin O'Duffy.Michael Harrington, p58
Afterwards, he was put in overall command of Free State forces in County Kerry until January 1923. He lobbied Richard Mulcahy, commander in chief, for 250 extra troops, to bring his command up to 1,500 and help to put down the guerrilla resistance there. In the early stages of the guerrilla war he organised large scale 'sweeps' to break up republican concentrations in west Cork and east Kerry. These met with little success, however.Tom Doyle, the Civil War in Kerry, p188
In October, in response to continuing guerrilla attacks on his troops, Murphy ordered a curfew to be put into place in Tralee from 10:30 until 5:39 every night.Doyle, p201
In December, Murphy wrote to Mulcahy that the, "Irregular Anti-Treaty organisation here is well nigh broken up", and suggested the end of the war in the county was in sight. His optimistic prediction proved premature, however.Doyle p232
On 20 December, Murphy sentenced four captured republican fighters to death under the Public Safety Act for possession of arms and ammunition. However the sentences were to be called off if local guerrilla activity ceased. Humphrey Murphy, the local IRA Brigade commander, threatened to shoot eight named government supporters in reprisal if the men were executed. Eventually their sentence was commuted to penal servitude.Doyle, p235-236, 240
In January 1923, Murphy was promoted from his command in Kerry to "responsibility for operations and organisation at the national level" in the Army. Paddy Daly took over as commanding officer in Kerry. Murphy later voiced the opinion that Daly had been a bad choice, given his implication in the Ballyseedy Massacre and other events of March 1923, in which up to 30 anti-Treaty prisoners were killed in the county.Doyle p240-241

Police career

Murphy left the National Army after the end of the Civil War in May 1923 and became first Irish Commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Police. He later became Deputy Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, when DMP was merged with the new national police force in 1925. He held this post until his retirement n 1955Doyle p240
He also held the post for a time of president of the Irish Amateur Boxing Association.
He died in 1975.
