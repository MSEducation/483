History

19th century

George A. Hormel (born 1860 in Buffalo, New York) worked in a Chicago slaughterhouse before becoming a traveling wool and hide buyer.  His travels took him to Austin and he decided to settle there, borrow $500, and open a meat business.  Hormel handled the production side of the business and his partner, Albert Friedrich, handled the retail side.  The two dissolved their partnership in 1891 so that Hormel could start a complete meat packing operation on his own.  He opened George A. Hormel & Co. in the northeast part of Austin in an old creamery building on the Cedar River.  To make ends meet in those early days, Hormel continued to trade in hides, eggs, wool, and poultry.  Joining George in November 1891 was his youngest brother, Benjamin, age 14.  By the end of 1891 Hormel employed six men and had slaughtered and sold 610 head of livestock.  By 1893, the increased use of refrigerator cars had allowed many large meat packers to force smaller businesses to collapse.  Two additional Hormel brothers, Herman and John, joined the business that same year, and together they processed 1,532 hogs. The remaining members of the Hormel family moved to Austin in 1895 and joined the growing business.  George turned to full-time management in 1899, and focused on increasing production.

1900s

In 1901, the plant was expanded and the business was incorporated.  The first directors were A.L. Eberhart and the four Hormel brothers: George, Herman, John and Ben.  In 1903 George decided to add a three-story hog-kill, a two-story beef-kill, an annex, an engine room, a machine shop and a casing production department. The name Dairy Brand was registered with the U.S. Patent Office in 1903. In the first decade of the 20th century distribution centers were opened in St. Paul, Minneapolis, Duluth, San Antonio, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, and Birmingham. George Hormel visited England in 1905 and started exporting products soon after.

1910s

By 1910, Hormel products were routinely appearing in national magazines. That same year the company developed a procedure to recycle its waste water by daily evaporating up to 9,000 gallons of water, leaving a syrupy liquid which was dried to produce a commercial fertilizer.  In 1915 Hormel began selling dry sausages under the names of Cedar Cervelat, Holsteiner and Noxall Salami.  That same year Hormel bought Alderson's Mill and began selling Hormel Peerless Minnesota flour nationwide.  Hormel joined the World War I effort, George's son Jay C. went into military service and by the end of the war, exports accounted for 33% of the company's yearly volume.

1920s

In 1921, when Jay Hormel returned from service in WWI, he uncovered that assistant controller Cy Thomson had embezzled $1,187,000 from the company over the previous ten years. The embezzlement scandal provided George Hormel with additional incentive to fortify his company. He did so by arranging for more reliable capital management, by dismissing unproductive employees, and by continuing to develop new products.  In 1926, the company introduced Hormel Flavor-Sealed Ham, America's first canned ham and it added chicken to its line in 1928. Jay C. Hormel became company president in 1929 and that same year the plant was expanded again to include eight new structures and the main office was tripled in size. In the late 1920s and early 1930s sales branches opened up in Houston, Beaumont, Chattanooga, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Newark, Los Angeles, Vicksburg, and Nuevo Laredo (Mexico).

1930s

In 1931, Jay C. instituted the Annual Wage Plan: under this plan, employees were paid weekly and they were guaranteed 52 weeks' notice before termination of employment. He also introduced incentive pay, profit sharing and pension plans to the company.  Later that year a slaughtering plant was constructed in Mitchell, South Dakota, and in 1933, a cattle slaughtering plant was finished in Austin. John G. Hormel, brother of George A., retired in 1933 following 40 years of service. Dinty Moore beef stew was introduced in 1935 first created by Ryen "Gunns" Gunning and Hormel Chili and Spam soon followed in 1936 and 1937 respectively. In 1938, Jay C. Hormel introduced the "Joint Savings Plan" which allowed employees to share in the proceeds of the company.  By the late-1930s, full-page, four color ads were routinely appearing in the Saturday Evening Post, Ladies Home Journal and Woman's Home Companion. Hormel ads also were featured on the radio program The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show.
In 1933, workers, led by itinerant butcher Frank Ellis, formed the Independent Union of All Workers and conducted one of the nation's first successful sit-down strikes; the union would later join the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO, later AFL-CIO).

The 1930s also saw the establishment of the Hormel & Co. refrigerator car line, with an initial roster of 125 units.

1940s

After reaching sales of $75 million in 1941, George and Jay established The Hormel Foundation to provide perpetual independence of the company, act as trustees of the family trusts and to start and fund The Hormel Institute, a research unit at the University of Minnesota.  Benjamin F. Hormel, brother of George A., retired in 1941 after completing 50 years of service. Hormel's production increased to aid in World War II and 65% of its products were purchased by the U.S. government by 1945. Founder George A. Hormel died in 1946 in California where he had lived in retirement. He is buried in Austin's Oakwood Cemetery. Jay C. then became chairman of the board, H.H. Corey became president, and R.F. Gray became vice-president. Hormel acquired the Fremont Packing Company in 1947.

1950s

In 1953, it acquired the Tobin Packing Company of Fort Dodge. Also in 1953, distribution centers were opened in San Francisco, Seattle and Beaumont and the company's first non-continental plant opened in Honolulu. Jay C. Hormel died on August 30, 1954, and Corey was named chairman of the board and R.F. Gray was elected president the following year. During Gray's tenure as president, the company greatly expanded its international business through arrangements with companies in Ireland, The UK, Canada and Venezuela. In 1959, Hormel was the first meatpacker to receive the Seal of Approval of the American Humane Society for its practice of anesthetizing animals before slaughter.

1960s

Little Sizzlers sausages were introduced in 1961 and Cure 81 hams were introduced in 1963. In 1962, Hormel constructed a  sausage manufacturing building in Austin and discontinued the slaughter of calves and lambs. Also in 1963, Hormel acquired the Queen City Packing Company plant in Springfield, Missouri, and the Ottawa Meat Packing Company plant in Miami, Oklahoma. New plants were also constructed in Chattanooga and Los Angeles and the plants in Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Fresno and Houston were remodeled or expanded. In 1964, the Hormel Corporate Offices were opened just to the north of Interstate 90 in Austin. Gray replaced Corey as chairman of the board upon the latter's retirement in 1965, and M.B. Thompson became president. During Thompson's tenure (1965–1969) a dry sausage plant was built in Algona and distribution centers were built in San Antonio, New Orleans and Atlanta.  In 1967, the Hormel Foundation, in cooperation with the National Merit Scholarship Program, started a college scholarship program for the children of Hormel employees. Partial scholarships were awarded through this program on the basis of the student's test scores, academic records, financial need, and school and community involvement. A separate building to house the growing research and development department was built northwest of the corporate office in Austin in 1968. In 1969, Gray resigned from the company and Thompson replaced him as chairman (by this time the chairman was called the CEO) and I.J. Holton was named president.

1970s

In 1970, a distribution plant was built in Albany, Georgia, and a dry sausage plant was built in Algona. In 1971, meat processing facilities and distribution centers were opened in both Dallas and Seattle. That same year the company introduced its Matching Gifts program in which it offered to match the donation (up to $2,000) made by any employee to any accredited college or university. In 1972, Holton became CEO and distribution centers were opened in Orlando and Shreveport and a food service facility was built in Oklahoma City. A grocery products plant was opened in Beloit in 1973. On this site the city now boasts the world's largest can of chili. Also in 1973, Hormel Foods became the first company in the meatpacking industry to introduce nutritional and ingredient labeling on meat products. A frozen foods plant was opened in Fort Worth in 1974. A distribution plant was opened in Houston in 1975. In 1976, a slaughtering and processing plant was opened in Ottumwa, a dry sausage plant was opened in Knoxville, Iowa, and a grocery products canning facility was acquired in Stockton. A distribution plant was built in Fresno in 1978. A gelatin plant was opened in Davenport and groundbreaking for a new, one-story Austin plant in 1979. That same year Richard Knowlton was elected as president, the first Austinian to hold that post since Jay Catherwood Hormel.

Holton continued as CEO until 1981 and then this duty was also passed to Knowlton. The construction of the current Austin plant began in 1980, and the Knoxville and Ottumwa plants were expanded. The plants in Beloit, Los Angeles and Ottumwa were renovated and expanded. The new Austin plant, a 

1985 strike

In August 1985, Hormel workers went on strike at the Hormel headquarters in Austin, Minnesota. In the early 1980s, recession impacted several meatpacking companies, decreasing demand and increasing competition which let smaller and less-efficient companies to go out of business. In an effort to keep plants from closing, many instituted wage cuts. Wilson Food Company declared bankruptcy in 1983, allowing them to cut wages from $10.69 to $6.50 and significantly reduce benefits. Hormel Foods had avoided such drastic action, but by 1985, pressure to stay competitive remained. 1989 Workers had already labored under a wage freeze and dangerous working conditions, leading to many cases of repetitive strain injury. When management demanded a 23% wage cut from the workers they decided to begin the strike. It became one of the longest strikes of the 1980s. The strike began with the sanction of the Local of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, P-9. The local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union P-9 led the strike, but was not supported by their parent union. The strike gained national attention and led to a widely publicized boycott of Hormel products.
After six months, a significant number of strikebreakers crossed the picket line, provoking riots in Austin. On January 21, 1986, the Governor of Minnesota, Rudy Perpich, called in the National Guard to protect the strikebreakers. This brought protests against the governor, and the National Guard withdrew from Austin. The action had a greater effect on the UFCW international, which ousted the local P-9.
The strike ended in June 1986, after lasting 10 months. Over 700 of the workers did not return to their jobs, refusing to cross the picket line. In solidarity with those workers, the boycott of Hormel products continued for some time. Ultimately, however, the company did succeed in hiring new workers at significantly lower wages.
The strike was chronicled in the film American Dream, which won the Academy Award for best documentary in 1990. A song about the strike, entitled "P-9" was written by Dave Pirner of the Minneapolis band Soul Asylum. The song can be found on their 1989 album, Clam Dip & Other Delights.
The strike has also had a Harvard Business School Case written based on it (with assumed names), called "Adam Baxter Co./Local 190" which features multiple rounds of negotiations between unions and management.
