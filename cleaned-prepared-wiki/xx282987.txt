Dr. Ismet Popovac (died 21 August 1943) was a Bosnian Muslim, MNVO) in Bosnia and Herzegovina during World War II. A physician and lawyer by profession, he was a member of a cultural society known as Gajret prior to the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941. He was also the mayor of the town of Konjic prior to the invasion and was allegedly a candidate for Vladko Maček's electoral list, but was left without a job in the Yugoslav state government after the creation of the Banovina of Croatia in 1939. 
In 1941, Popovac joined the Chetnik movement of Draža Mihailović. As a proponent of Bosnian Muslim collaboration with the Chetniks, he suggested that the Chetniks recruit Muslims into their ranks. In October 1942, he enlisted Italian aid in fighting the Yugoslav Partisans, and later visited Prozor to discourage further bloodshed after a Chetnik massacre took the lives of 543–2,500 Muslim and Croat civilians. In early 1943 he led an attack against a Muslim village, before being killed by either the Partisans, Chetniks, or an assassin in the vicinity of the town of Trebinje later that year.

Several days later, Popovac arrived in the town to console the Bosnian Muslim population and to advise the Chetniks there against committing further atrocities.
In January 1943, Popovac led an attack which resulted in the capture of a Muslim village that was guarded by a large force of Muslim volunteers.
