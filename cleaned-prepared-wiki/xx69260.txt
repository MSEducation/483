Career

Early career

Growing up in Alameda near Oakland, Willis rooted for the Oakland A's as a kid. His mother Joyce was a soft ball catcher for her high school team. Willis' favorite player was former Oakland A's pitcher, Dave Stewart. Willis attended Encinal High School in Alameda, California, where he played baseball for four years. He is the son of Clinton Ostah, a former minor league player in the 1970s. In Willis' senior year, he went 12–1 with a 0.83 earned run average in 70 innings. Scouts never doubted his talents, but rather his unusual pitching mechanics. One scout even called him a "Poor man's CC Sabathia." He was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 8th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft.
In 2001, Willis was bumped up to the Boise Hawks of the Northwest League. He finished with 8 wins and a 2.98 ERA. Opposing hitters only batted .217 against Willis. In a Baseball America poll, several NWL managers called Willis Boise's best player.

Florida Marlins

On March 27, 2002, the Cubs traded Willis (then a minor leaguer), fellow pitchers Julián Tavárez and José Cueto, and catcher Ryan Jorgensen to the Florida Marlins, in exchange for pitchers Matt Clement and Antonio Alfonseca.
After being traded, Willis struggled early on. However, Willis started to get better as he got to low Class A ball. By the end of the season, he went 10-2 and finished the season with the Class-A Jupiter Hammerheads. In five starts, he went 2-0 with a 1.83 ERA, leading the Midwest League in ERA. For his performance, he was named the Marlins' Minor League Pitcher of the Year.
In the 2003 Spring Training, Willis reported to Jupiter. The plan was to start him with the Class-AA Carolina Mudcats. The hope was that he would make the leap to AAA, and potentially be available for a spot start in Florida or a back-of-the-bullpen job late in the season. The Marlins then sent Willis down to Carolina to work on consistency and control. Willis would dominate at Carolina; he went 4–0 with a 1.49 ERA.

Willis would also pitch against Tom Glavine, one of his childhood heroes in the same game.
Willis was named Rookie of the Month for the month of June and became the first Marlins pitcher to be named Pitcher of the Month. He became the first rookie pitcher to win Pitcher of the Month since Hideo Nomo did it back in 1995 for the Los Angeles Dodgers and he became the first rookie pitcher to win in seven straight starts since Jason Isringhausen did it in the same year as Nomo.
On July 30, Willis faced another one of his childhood heroes in a head-to-head pitching duel, Randy Johnson of the Diamondbacks. Willis went seven innings and allowed only one earned run.
After coming out of the bullpen in game 1 of the 2003 National League Division Series against the Giants, Willis started game 4 of the series.

On June 8, Willis became the Major Leagues' first 10-game winner when he pitched the Marlins to a 5-4 victory over the Seattle Mariners, allowing 4 runs. Willis became only the third pitcher in Marlins history to record 10 wins before the All-Star Break.
On June 23, Willis became the NL's first 12-game winner when he pitched a shutout against the Braves. "He's tough", Braves Manager Bobby Cox said. "He deserves to start the All-Star game, to be honest with you. He's the dominant pitcher in the National League right now."

During his last start before the All-Star Break, Willis struggled against the Cubs. In 4.1 innings, he allowed 8 runs, all earned.
Shortly after the All-Star Break, he struggled in each of his first two starts against the Philadelphia Phillies and San Francisco Giants.
