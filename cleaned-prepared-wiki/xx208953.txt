Early life

Educated at Bemrose School, Derby, Joe Andrew was a grammar school boy from a non-intellectual, Roman Catholic, middle class family. He won a Scholarship to study at University College, Oxford and, in 1969, he was awarded a First-Class Honours degree in Modern Languages.
In 1971, whilst researching the history of the Russian literary language at Wolfson College, Oxford, Andrew joined the recently formed 'Neo-Formalist Circle'. His membership of the Circle, and his interest in Russian formalism, has continued to the present- day.

Academic career

Joe Andrew was appointed Lecturer in Russian Studies at Keele University 1972. He became a Senior Lecturer in 1989 and Reader in 1993. In 1995, he was elevated to Professor.
Andrew's teaching has included courses on Anton Chekhov, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Nikolai Gogol, Mikhail Lermontov, Alexander Pushkin, Leo Tolstoy, Ivan Turgenev and women in Russian literature. He has delivered 70 invited lectures & conference papers all around the world.
Joe Andrew, and his departmental colleague Chris Pike, began organising the Neo-Formalist Circle from Keele University in the mid-1970s. This led to a "considerable consolidation of the Neo-Formalist Circle, to the extent that it is now very much a fixture on the British and international academic scenes"  The Circle's twice-a-year journal 'Essays in Poetics' first appeared in April 1976 and was edited by Andrew and Pike. In 1990, Robert Reid replaced Pike as the both Circle's co-chair and the journal's joint editor. Andrew remained Chair and joint editor until 2006.
During Andrew's leadership of the Neo-Formalist Circle it has organized several special conferences, on literary figures such as Chekhov, Gogol, Platonov and Pushkin. These conferences have led to the publication of a number of edited volumes.
