History

The organization was formed in March 1999 as the Disease Management Association of America (DMAA). Growth in disease management enrollment prompts launch of new association. 1999-03-01. Retrieved 2008-10-13. Changes ahead for cancer patients. Cincinnati Enquirer, 1999-04-12. Its stated purpose was "educating the health care industry, government, employers and the general public about the important role that disease management programs play in improving health care quality and outcomes for people with chronic conditions". The organization's first President was Al Lewis, who described an "irreversible trend toward more disease management" but with some barriers such as state privacy laws.

In early 2003, the Care Continuum Alliance hired Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz to advocate for its interests in the U.S. executive and legislative branches.

Outcomes Guidelines Report (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010)

In recent years, Care Continuum Alliance research activities have focused heavily on measuring outcomes in population-based interventions, such as wellness and care management. These activities were conducted at least partly in response to a 2004 Congressional Budget Office analysis that concluded that published studies "do not provide a firm basis for concluding that such programs generally reduce total costs".

Population Health Improvement: A Market Survey Report (2010)

This market analysis collected responses from 135 purchasers and providers of health and wellness services and explored a variety of metrics, such as intervention types, use of incentives and measures of success. The analysis also examines market trends, including purchasing expectations, insourcing versus outsourcing of services and use of integrated data platforms. The survey found that 73 percent of purchasers planned to offer population health improvement programs within the 12 months following the survey's release and that 76 percent planned to do so by the end of 2011.
