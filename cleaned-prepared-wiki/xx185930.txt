History

Established in 1935 when US 220 was extended south from Virginia; it replaced: US 311/NC 77 from the state line to Madison, US 411/NC 704 from Madison to Greensboro, US 411/NC 70 from Greensboro to Candor, US 411/NC 170 from Candor to Norman, and US 15/NC 75 from Norman to Rockingham.
By 1939, US 220 was realigned west of Seagrove, leaving Old US Highway 220 and an extension of NC 705.  By 1963, US 220 bypassed Madison and Mayodan, the old route through the towns became US 220 Business.  Between 1964-1966, Stoneville was bypassed to its west.  Between 1967-1968, US 220 we realigned west, onto new freeway, of Asheboro, leaving US 220 Business.  In 1970, US 220 was rerouted in Greensboro, from Randleman Road it overlapped with Interstate 85 then onto O. Henry Boulevard (in concurrency with US 29) going north till Wendover Avenue, then west to Battleground Avenue; the original alignment through downtown Greensboro became unnumbered.
In the 1970s, US 220 was continuously moved onto new freeway, bypassing Randleman and Level Cross.  Also, at some point during the decade, US 220 was extended south to its current terminus with US 1, leaving behind Ellerbe Road in Rockingham.
In 1980, US 220 was moved onto new freeway between Steeds and Emery, its old alignment became US 220 Alternate.  Between 1981-1983, US 220 moved onto new freeway from Level Cross to Interstate 85, leaving an unnumbered Randleman Road.
In 1995, US 220 was moved onto new freeway between Interstate 85 to Interstate 40.  In May, 1997, US 220 was moved onto new freeway between Ether and NC 134; it not only extended US 220 Alternate over the old alignment, but also became the first section of both Interstate 73 and Interstate 74.
On January 7, 2008, US 220 was moved onto new freeway between Emery to south of Ellerbe, leaving its old alignment another extension of US 220 Alternate.

Through Greensboro, it was routed along Randleman Road,  O'Connor Street, Elm Street, and Battleground Road; in 1934, it was rerouted north of Elm Street to Wendover Avenue, Winstead Place, Northwood Street, and Battleground Road.
