Robert Lee "Bullet Bob" Hayes (December 20, 1942 – September 18, 2002) was an Olympic sprinter turned American football wide receiver in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys.  An American track and field athlete, he was a two-sport stand-out in college in both track and football at Florida A&M University.  He has one of the top 100 meter times by NFL players.  Hayes was enshrined in the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor in 2001 and was selected for induction in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in January 2009. He was officially inducted in Canton, Ohio on August 8, 2009.  Hayes is the second Olympic gold medalist to be inducted to the Hall of Fame, after Jim Thorpe.
Once considered the world's fastest man by virtue of his multiple world records in the 60-yard, 100-yard, 220-yard, and Olympic 100-meter dashes, Hayes is the only man to win both an Olympic gold medal and a Super Bowl ring.

High school and college

Hayes attended Matthew Gilbert High School (now a middle school) in Jacksonville, where he was a backup halfback on the football team. The 1958 Gilbert High Panthers finished 12–0, winning the Florida Interscholastic Athletic Association black school state championship with a 14–7 victory over Dillard High School of Fort Lauderdale before more than 11,000 spectators. In times of segregation laws, their achievement went basically unnoticed, yet 50 years later they were recognized as one of the best teams in FHSAA history.FHSAA Teams of the Century
Hayes was also the first person to break six seconds in the 60 yard dash with his indoor world record of 5.9 seconds.  While a student at Florida A&M in 1962, Hayes ran a new world record for the 100 yard dash with a time of 9.2 seconds.  The next year he broke his own record with a time of 9.1, a record that would not be broken for eleven years (until Ivory Crockett ran a 9.0 in 1974).  That same year, Hayes set the world best for 200 meters (20.5 seconds, although the time was never ratified) and ran the 220 yard dash in a time of 20.6 seconds (while running into an eight mph wind).
He was the AAU 100 yard dash champion three years running, from 1962–1964, and in 1964 was the NCAA champion in the 200 meter dash.  He would miss part of his senior year in college because of his 1964 Olympic bid for U.S. Gold.

Olympics

At the 1964 Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, Hayes had his finest hour as a sprinter. First, he won the 100m and tied the then world record in the 100 m with a time of 10.06 seconds, even though he was running in lane 1 which had, the day before, been used for the 20 km racewalk and this badly chewed up the cinder track. He also was running in borrowed spikes because one of his shoes had been kicked under the bed when he was playing with some friends and he didn't realize until he got there.  This was followed by a second gold medal in the 4 x 100 meter relay, which also produced a new World Record (39.06 seconds).
His come-from-behind win for the US team in the relay was one of the most memorable Olympic moments. Hand-timed between 8.5 and 8.9 seconds, his relay leg is one of the fastest in history.espn.go."  Drayton was able to reply afterwards, "That's all we need." The race was also Hayes' last as a track and field athlete, as he permanently switched to football after it.See the race on youtube
In some of the first meets to be timed with experimental fully automatic timing, Hayes was the first man to break ten seconds for the 100 metres, albeit with a 5.3 m/s wind assistance in the semi-finals of the 1964 Olympics.  His time was recorded at 9.91 seconds.  Jim Hines officially broke 10 seconds at the high altitude of Mexico City, Mexico in 1968 (and on a synthetic track) with a wind legal 9.95 which stood as the world record for almost 15 years.  The next to surpass Hayes at a low altitude Olympics was Carl Lewis in 1984 when he won in 9.99, some 20 years later (though Hasely Crawford equalled the time in 1976).com/guests/jc_bobhayes.php
Until the Tokyo Olympics world records were measured by officials with stopwatches, measured to the nearest tenth of a second.  Although fully automatic timing was used in Tokyo, the times were given the appearance of manual timing.  This was done by subtracting 0.05 seconds from the automatic time and rounding to the nearest tenth of a second, making Hayes' time of 10.06 seconds convert to 10.0 seconds, despite the fact that the officials with stopwatches had measured Hayes' time to be 9.9 seconds, to 0.20 seconds.  This unique method of determining the official time therefore denied Hayes the record of being the first to officially record 9.9 seconds for the 100 meters.  The first official times of 9.9 seconds were recorded at the "Night of Speed" in 1968.

Professional football career

Early years

The Dallas Cowboys drafted Hayes in the seventh round of the 1964 NFL Draft with a future draft pick, which allowed the team to draft him before his college eligibility was over, taking a chance that the Olympic sprinter with unrefined football skills could excel as a wide receiver.google. The bet paid off, due to his amazing feats in cleats. Hayes has been credited by many with forcing the NFL to develop a zone defense and the bump and run to attempt to contain him.profootballhof.jsp?story_id=3095
Hayes' first two seasons were most successful, during which he led the NFL both times in receiving touchdowns with 12 and 13 touchdowns, respectively.

Multiple offensive threat

In addition to receiving, Hayes returned punts for the Cowboys and was the NFL's leading punt returner in 1968 with a 20.8 yards per return average and two touchdowns, including a 90 yarder against the Pittsburgh Steelers.  He was named to the Pro Bowl three times and First-team All-Pro twice and Second-team All-Pro twice.  He helped Dallas win five Eastern Conference titles, two NFC titles, played in two Super Bowls, and was instrumental in Dallas' first ever Super Bowl victory in 1972, making Hayes the only person to win both an Olympic gold medal and a Super Bowl ring.  Later in his career, as defenses improved playing zone and the bump and run was refined, Hayes' value as an erstwhile decoy rather than a deep threat diminished.  Hayes played one season for the San Francisco 49ers before retiring. Also, by then, there were many players faster than Hayes, such as the Raiders' speedster Cliff Branch.

Cowboy records

Hayes was the second player (after Franklin Clarke) in the history of the Dallas Cowboys franchise to surpass 1,000 yards (ground or air) in a single season, and he did that in his rookie year by finishing with 1,003 yards.  Also during his rookie year, he led the team with 46 receptions and set franchise records for total touchdowns (13) and total receiving touchdowns (12).  He finished his 11-year career with 371 receptions for 7,414 yards and 71 touchdowns, giving him an impressive 20 yards per catch average (both career touchdowns and yards per catch average remain franchise records.)  He also rushed for 68 yards, gained 581 yards on 23 kickoff returns, and returned 104 punts for 1,158 yards and three touchdowns.
In 1965 he also started a streak (1965–1966) of seven consecutive games with at least a touchdown catch, which still stands as a Cowboys record shared with Franklin Clarke (1961–1962), Terrell Owens (2007) and Dez Bryant (2012).
His 7,295 receiving yards are the fourth-most in Dallas Cowboys history. To this day, Hayes holds ten regular-season receiving records, four punt return records and twenty-two overall franchise marks, making him one of the greatest receivers to ever play for the Cowboys.

Death

On September 18, 2002, Hayes died in his hometown Jacksonville of kidney failure, after battling prostate cancer and liver ailments."Ex-Olympic star, Cowboy Hayes dies," AP, as reported by September 19, 2002. 11 September 2011

Pro Football Hall of Fame

2004 Controversy

Hayes was close to being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2004, but was denied the opportunity in the final round of decision making.  The decision was marred by controversy, with many claiming that the Hall of Fame Senior Selection Committee had a bias against members of the Dallas Cowboys and other NFL teams.  Shortly after the announcement of the new 2004 Hall of Fame members, long-time Sports Illustrated writer Paul Zimmerman resigned from the Selection Committee in protest of the decision to leave Hayes out of the Hall. Zimmerman is now back in as one of the Hall of Fame voters.thefootballsearchengine.com/JimMarshall/HOFvoters/

2009 Induction

On August 27, 2008, Hayes was named as one of two senior candidates for the 2009 Hall of Fame election.profootballhof.jsp?story_id=2816  On Saturday, January 31, 2009, he was selected as a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's Class of 2009.
The next day Lucille Hester released a letter she claimed he had drafted three years before he died, on October 29, 1999, in case he did not live to see his induction.  Its full text read:
Delivered by Hester in front of hundreds and a national cable television audience, the moment was described as "... one of the most compelling and touching scenes the Hall of Fame has seen."  Shortly after, it was discovered that the supposedly signed letter was printed in the Calibri font, which didn't exist until five years after Hayes' death.dallasnews.9a30e7.
On August 8, 2009, Bob Hayes was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Roger Staubach, Bob's Dallas Cowboy teammate, along with Bob's son Bob Hayes Jr, unveiled the bust, which was sculpted by Scott Myers. On hand were six members of Bob's Gilbert High School championship team.jacksonville.com/sports/columnists/gene_frenette/2009-08-09/story/bob_hayes_finally_crosses_finish_line_in_canton
