There's no set time or date that I'll be training full-force. I'm just taking it day by day, but I'll be back at it very soon!

At the end of July, Rogers competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom.  She helped the Canadian team qualify to the team final  After qualifications, Rogers said, "We're just so, so excited. As soon as I saw we were sixth I knew we were in. I was sitting with my parents. Then I jumped out of my seat and ran over to hug my teammates. I mean, we're making history. That is so cool. There are twenty thousand people in here. That's a lot of people. That can be intimidating. I just looked around and took it all in. I had shivers. I think everyone handled it tremendously. It could've gone a lot worse. We all have strengths and weaknesses and I think we put those aside and did it for the team. We have nothing to lose now. The worst we can be is eighth and that's still an accomplishment in itself. I know we can only go up from here because we had our struggles on beam so now we know what we need to improve on. We're just going to come out and rock (on Tuesday). This is just so amazing. I really don't have words to describe the feeling."
