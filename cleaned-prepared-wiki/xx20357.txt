[[Gaussian quadrature]]

CATEGORIES: Numerical integration (quadrature)

In numerical analysis, a quadrature rule is an approximation of the definite integral of a function, usually stated as a weighted sum of function values at specified points within the domain of integration.
(See numerical integration for more on quadrature rules.)
An n-point Gaussian quadrature rule, named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, is a quadrature rule constructed to yield an exact result for polynomials of degree 2n − 1 or less by a suitable choice of the points xi and weights wi for i = 1,...,n.
The domain of integration for such a rule is conventionally taken as 1, so the rule is stated as
Gaussian quadrature as above will only produce accurate results if the function f(x) is well approximated by a polynomial function within the range −1,1. The method is not, for example, suitable for functions with singularities. However, if the integrated function can be written as
Common weighting functions include
It can be shown (see Press, et al., or Stoer and Bulirsch) that the evaluation points xi are just the roots of a polynomial belonging to a class of orthogonal polynomials.
 Gauss–Legendre quadrature == 
the associated polynomials are Legendre polynomials, Pn(x), and the method is usually known as Gauss–Legendre quadrature. With the nth polynomial normalized to give Pn(1) = 1, the ith Gauss node, xi, is the ith root of Pn; its weight is given by 
Some low-order rules for solving the integration problem are listed below.

Change of interval

An integral over b must be changed into an integral over 1 before applying the Gaussian quadrature rule. This change of interval can be done in the following way:
Applying the Gaussian quadrature rule then results in the following approximation:

Other forms

The integration problem can be expressed in a slightly more general way by introducing a positive weight function ω into the integrand,
and allowing an interval other than 1.
That is, the problem is to calculate
for some choices of a, b, and ω.
For a = −1, b = 1, and ω(x) = 1,
the problem is the same as that considered above.
Other choices lead to other integration rules.
Some of these are tabulated below.
Equation numbers are given for Abramowitz and Stegun (A & S).

Fundamental theorem

Because of the choice of nodes xi, the corresponding relation

The weights can be expressed as
We can write
We can thus write the integral expression for the weights as
In the integrand, writing
yields
We can then write

There are alternative methods for obtaining the same weights and nodes in O(n) operations using the Prüfer Transform.

Error estimates

The error of a Gaussian quadrature rule can be stated as follows .
For an integrand which has 2n continuous derivatives,
for some ξ in (a, b), where pn is the monic (i.e. the leading coefficient is 1) orthogonal polynomial of degree n and where
In the important special case of ω(x) = 1, we have the error estimate 
Stoer and Bulirsch remark that this error estimate is inconvenient in practice,
since it may be difficult to estimate the order 2n derivative,
and furthermore the actual error may be much less than a bound established by the derivative.
Another approach is to use two Gaussian quadrature rules of different orders,
and to estimate the error as the difference between the two results.
For this purpose, Gauss–Kronrod quadrature rules can be useful.
Important consequence of the above equation is that Gaussian quadrature of order n is accurate for all polynomials up to degree 2n–1.

Gauss–Kronrod rules

If the interval b is subdivided,
the Gauss evaluation points of the new subintervals never coincide with the previous evaluation points (except at zero for odd numbers),
and thus the integrand must be evaluated at every point.
This allows for computing higher-order estimates while re-using the function values of a lower-order estimate.
The difference between a Gauss quadrature rule and its Kronrod extension are often used as an estimate of the approximation error.

Gauss–Lobatto rules

Also known as Lobatto quadrature , named after Dutch mathematician Rehuel Lobatto.
It is similar to Gaussian quadrature with the following differences:
