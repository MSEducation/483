CATEGORIES: 1973 births, Living people, Boxers from Virginia

Charles Shufford (born Charles Lamont Shufford, Jr on February 3, 1973 in Martinsville, Virginia) is a professional boxer.
He had 35 amateur fights at superheavyweight (no exact record given) and in 1996 beat Lance Whitaker but lost to Joe Mesi and Lovy Page.
As a pro Shufford's biggest victory was a win over once-beaten amateur star and future WBO champ Lamon Brewster in 2000 via unanimous decision. He also beat shopworn puncher Jimmy Thunder.
His most notable fight was a devastating 6th-round knockout loss to WBO champ Wladimir Klitschko in 2001.
Shufford also is known for losses to Lawrence Clay Bey and contenders Jameel McCline and Samuel Peter.
Shufford has gone 0–2–1 in his last three fights with the draw coming to Kelvin Davis and the losses to Malik Scott and Jason Estrada. He hasn't fought since.

Perhaps Shufford's most notable accomplishment has been outside of the ring.  He played the role of George Foreman in the 2001 movie Ali.
