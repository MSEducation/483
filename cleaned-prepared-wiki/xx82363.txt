The coat of arms of Serbia is a re-introduction of the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Serbia (1882–1918) adopted by the Republic of Serbia in 2004 and later redesigned in 2010.

Description

The principal field stands for the Serbian state. It consists of a silver double-headed eagle on a red shield; its body and wings in silver, and tongues, beaks, legs and claws in gold, between two golden fleur-de-lis. The inescutcheon stands for the Serbian nation; in a red shield, a cross between four silver firesteels arranged in the quarters around it, all of them facing horizontally outwards.
A blazon in heraldic terms is: Gules, a bicephalic eagle Argent armed Or, two fleurs-de-lys Or. Overall an escutcheon Gules, a cross Argent between four firesteels Argent. All crowned with a royal crown.
The design on the inescutcheon has been used by Serbian states and the Serbian church since the Middle Ages.  
The four shapes around the central cross are firesteels.
Although Serbia is now a republic, the coat of arms features the royal crown of the former monarchy.
The lesser arms is used more frequently, appearing on passports, identity cards, driver's licenses, and the state flag.

History

Serbian eagle

The use of the double-headed eagle dates back to Beginning in the 14th century, the double-headed eagle can be seen more often on inscriptions, medieval frescoes and embroidery on the clothes of Serbian royalty. The Codex Monacensis Slavicus 4 (fl. 1371-1389) has richly attested artwork of the Serbian eagle.  The double-headed eagle was officially adopted by Stefan Lazarević after he received the despot title, the second highest Byzantine title, by John VII Palaiologos in August 1402 at the court in Constantinople. 8, Osteuropa-Institut München, F. Steiner Verlag, 1960, p. 511

Serbian cross

Serbian historian Stanoje Stanojević argues that it was officially adopted in 1345, with Dušan the Mighty's raising to a Serbian Empire. 5 Stojan Novaković argues that the recorded use of the Serbian cross, as a national symbol, began in 1397, during the rule of Stefan Lazarević. 4 It was possibly derived from a known candle chandelier from the Visoki Dečani. The Serbian cross is found in the Korenić-Neorić Armorial (1595), which shows the coat of arms of Serbia (Svrbiae) as a white cross over a red background, with four firesteels, also depicting the Mrnjavčević noble house with the same design, with inverted colours and the Serbian eagle in the center of the cross.  According to Mavro Orbini (1607), it was used by Vukašin Mrnjavčević (King, 1365–1371) and Lazar Hrebeljanović (Prince, 1371–1389).  Miloš Obrenović adopted the Serbian cross as the military flag when forming the first units of the regular army in 1825.
