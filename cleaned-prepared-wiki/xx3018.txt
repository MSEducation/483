This formula can be interpreted as saying that the function eix traces out the unit circle in the complex number plane as x ranges through the real numbers.  Here, x is the angle that a line connecting the origin with a point on the unit circle makes with the positive real axis, measured counter clockwise and in radians.
The original proof is based on the Taylor series expansions of the exponential function ez (where z is a complex number) and of sin x  and cos x for real numbers x (see below). In fact, the same proof shows that Euler's formula is even valid for all complex numbers x.
A point in the complex plane can be represented by a complex number written in
cartesian coordinates.  Euler's formula provides a means of conversion between cartesian coordinates and polar coordinates.  The polar form simplifies the mathematics when used in multiplication or powers of complex numbers.  Any complex number z = x + iy can be written as
where
Now, taking this derived formula, we can use Euler's formula to define the logarithm of a complex number. To do this, we also use the definition of the logarithm (as the inverse operator of exponentiation) that
and that
both valid for any complex numbers a and b.
Therefore, one can write:
for any z ≠ 0. Taking the logarithm of both sides shows that:
Finally, the other exponential law
which can be seen to hold for  all integers k, together with Euler's formula, implies several trigonometric identities as well as de Moivre's formula.

Relationship to trigonometry

Euler's formula provides a powerful connection between analysis and trigonometry, and provides an interpretation of the sine and cosine functions as weighted sums of the exponential function:
The two equations above can be derived by adding or subtracting Euler's formulas:
and solving for either cosine or sine.
These formulas can even serve as the definition of the trigonometric functions for complex arguments x.  For example, letting y = ix, we have:
Complex exponentials can simplify trigonometry, because they are easier to manipulate than their sinusoidal components.  One technique is simply to convert sinusoids into equivalent expressions in terms of exponentials.  After the manipulations, the simplified result is still real-valued.  For example:
Another technique is to represent the sinusoids in terms of the real part of a more complex expression, and perform the manipulations on the complex expression.  For example:
This formula is used for recursive generation of cos(nx) for integer values of n and arbitrary x (in radians).

Topological interpretation

Other applications

In differential equations, the function eix is often used to simplify derivations, even if the final answer is a real function involving sine and cosine. The reason for this is that the complex exponential is the eigenfunction of differentiation.  Euler's identity is an easy consequence of Euler's formula.
In electronic engineering and other fields, signals that vary periodically over time are often described as a combination of sine and cosine functions (see Fourier analysis), and these are more conveniently expressed as the real part of exponential functions with imaginary exponents, using Euler's formula. Also, phasor analysis of circuits can include Euler's formula to represent the impedance of a capacitor or an inductor.

Definitions of complex exponentiation

The exponential function ex for real values of x may be defined in a few different equivalent ways (see Characterizations of the exponential function). Several of these methods may be directly extended to give definitions of ez for complex values of z simply by substituting z in place of x and using the complex algebraic operations. In particular we may use either of the two following definitions which are equivalent. From a more advanced perspective, each of these definitions may be interpreted as giving the unique analytic continuation of ex to the complex plane.

Power series definition

For complex z
Using the ratio test it is possible to show that this power series has an infinite radius of convergence, and so defines ez for all complex z.

Proofs

Various proofs of the formula are possible.

Using power series

Here is a proof of Euler's formula using power series expansions
as well as basic facts about the powers of i:A Modern Introduction to Differential Equations, by Henry J. Ricardo, p428
and so on. Using now the power series definition from above we see that for real values of x
In the last step we have simply recognized the Maclaurin series for cos(x) and sin(x). The rearrangement of terms is justified because each series is absolutely convergent.
