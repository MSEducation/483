History

Berkshire County was originally inhabited by the Mahican (Muh-he-ka-neew) Native American tribe, until the early 18th century when the first English settlers and frontiersmen appeared around this time and began setting up farms and homesteads. On April 25, 1724 "The English finally paid the Indians 460 pounds, 3 barrels of cider, and 30 quarts of rum for what is today Berkshire County."David H. Wood, 'Lenox Massachusetts Shire Town', (For the town: Lenox, 1969), p. 5. This deal exempted modern Sheffield, Stockbridge, Richmond and Lenox, which were collected at various other dates into English territory.
Berkshire County remained part of Hampshire County, Massachusetts until 1760, when it was divided off as a separate entity.
In the 19th century many of the towns of Berkshire County became popular with the country's elite as they built what they called "cottages" throughout the country side. The Gilded Age ended in the early 20th century with the income tax, World War I, and the Great Depression. In the 20th century some of these cottages were torn or burned down, while others became prep schools, historic sites, or bed-and-breakfast inns.
Today Berkshire is known throughout the East Coast and the country as the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. It includes Tanglewood to the Norman Rockwell museum, Mass MOCA and Hancock Shaker Village.
