She is currently equipped with three 20 mm Phalanx CIWS mounts and two Sea Sparrow SAM launchers. The ship cost over $4.5 billion in 2007 dollars to manufacture.

Propulsion

Two Westinghouse A4W nuclear reactors are used for propulsion (the ship is capable of steaming more than three million miles before refueling) turning 4 five-bladed screws that weigh 66,220 pounds (30 t) each, driving the ship at speeds over 30 knots (56 km/h).

Recreation

Awards

Harry S Truman has been the recipient of numerous awards recognizing the ship's excellence. They include

Ship's seal and battle flag

The oval seal was designed by the ship's pre-commissioning crew and is primarily blue and gold. According to the ship's history webpage, a coat of arms "characterizes the global on-station capability of the ship and the United States Navy" and "Truman's name forms the shape of a forward-deployed aircraft carrier prepared to uphold and protect American interests".  The 33 gold stars surrounding the seal represent Truman's position as the 33rd President.
The Truman battle flag was also designed by the ship's crew and is a variation of the guidons carried by the companies of the 129th Field Artillery Regiment of the 35th Infantry Division, such as Battery D, the battery under the command of then Army Capt. Harry Truman during World War I. It consists of crossed cannons on a scarlet background with the phrase "Give 'em hell", a reference to Truman's 1948 reelection campaign.
