Safrole, also known as shikimol, is a phenylpropene. It is a colorless or slightly yellow oily liquid typically extracted from the root-bark or the fruit of sassafras plants in the form of sassafras oil (although commercially available culinary sassafras oil is usually devoid of safrole due to a rule passed by the FDA in 1960), or is synthesized from catechol a tree growing in eastern North America, are the main natural sources for safrole. It has a characteristic "sweet-shop" aroma.
It is a precursor in the synthesis of the insecticide synergist piperonyl butoxide, the fragrance piperonal via isosafrole, and the empathogenic/entactogenic drug MDMA.

Carcinogenicity

Safrole is regarded by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  to be a weak carcinogen in rats. In the United States, it was once widely used as a food additive in root beer, sassafras tea, and other common goods, but was banned by the FDA after its carcinogenicity in rats was discovered. Today, safrole is also banned for use in soap and perfumes by the International Fragrance Association.

Use in MDMA manufacture

Safrole is listed as a Table I precursor under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.International Narcotics Control Board
Due to its role in the manufacture of MDMA, safrole and isosafrole, as well as piperonal, are Category I precursors under regulation No 273/2004 of the European Community. In the United States, safrole is currently a List I chemical. 
The root bark of American sassafras contains a low percentage of steam-volatile oil, which is typically 75% safrole.  Attempts to refine safrole from sassafras bark are generally not economically viable due to low yield and high effort. Sustainable harvesting of safrole is possible from leaves and stems of certain plants.
