A neutral power in a particular war is a sovereign state which officially declares itself to be neutral towards the belligerents. A non-belligerent state does not need to be neutral. The rights and duties of a neutral power are defined in Sections 5Second Hague Convention, Section 5 and 13Second Hague Convention, Section 13 of the Hague Convention of 1907.  A permanently neutral power is a sovereign state which is bound by international treaty to be neutral towards the belligerents of all future wars. An example of a permanently neutral power is Switzerland.  The concept of neutrality in war is narrowly defined and puts specific constraints on the neutral party in return for the internationally recognised right to remain neutral.
Neutralism or a "neutralist policy" is a foreign policy position wherein a state intends to remain neutral in future wars. A sovereign state that reserves the right to become a belligerent if attacked by a party to the war is in a condition of armed neutrality.

Rights and responsibilities of a neutral power

Belligerents may not invade neutral territory,Hague Convention, §5 Art.1 and a neutral power's resisting any such attempt does not compromise its neutrality.10
A neutral power must intern belligerent troops who reach its territory,Hague Convention, §5 Art.11 but not escaped prisoners of war.13 Belligerent armies may not recruit neutral citizens,Hague Convention, §5 Art.4,5 but they may go abroad to enlist.6 Belligerent armies' personnel and material may not be transported across neutral territory,Hague Convention, §5 Art.2 but the wounded may be.14 A neutral power may supply communication facilities to belligerents,Hague Convention, §5 Art.8 but not war material,Hague Convention, §13 Art.6 although it need not prevent export of such material.7
Belligerent naval vessels may use neutral ports for a maximum of 24 hours, though neutrals may impose different restrictions.12 Exceptions are to make repairs—only the minimum necessary to put back to seaHague Convention, §13 Art.14—or if an opposing belligerent's vessel is already in port, in which case it must have a 24-hour head start.16 A prize ship captured by a belligerent in the territorial waters of a neutral power must be surrendered by the belligerent to the neutral, which must intern its crew.3

List of neutral states

Note: Whether a state that is a member of the European Union may be considered neutral is a point of debate. This is discussed in the section below.

Points of debate

European Union

The neutrality of some countries now in the European Union (Austria, Finland, Ireland, Malta, Netherlands and Sweden) is under dispute, especially as the EU now operates a Common Foreign and Security Policy. This view was supported by the Finnish Prime Minister, Matti Vanhanen, on 5 July 2006, while speaking to the European Parliament as Council President;
 
 "Mr Pflüger described Finland as neutral. I must correct him on that: Finland is a member of the EU. We were at one time a politically neutral country, during the time of the Iron Curtain. Now we are a member of the Union, part of this community of values, which has a common policy and, moreover, a common foreign policy."Presentation of the programme of the Finnish presidency (debate) 5 July 2006, European Parliament Strasbourg
Later, the 'solidarity clause' in the Lisbon Treaty was deemed sufficient to replace the Western European Union (WEU) military alliance's mutual defence clause (where an attack upon one state is deemed an attack on all, resulting in military support from other members). As a result the WEU was closed down with its mutual defence role having been absorbed by the European Union.Statement of the Presidency of the Permanent Council of the WEU on behalf of the High Contracting Parties to the Modified Brussels Treaty – Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom, Western European Union 31 March 2010
Irish neutrality is similarly debated; the state's "traditional policy of military neutrality" is not defined in law, and referendums on the Treaty of Nice and on the Treaty of Lisbon were lost in part because of fears these would undermine Irish neutrality.
Austrian neutrality is special, as for many Austrian citizens neutrality is a main element of the Austrian state. So while in fact neutrality currently only exists on paper, politicians do not dare to adjust the constitution to reflect reality. Furthermore the topic is very complicated as strong political powers are against any ties to NATO while in fact NATO can be regarded as the major European defence institution.

Neutrality to forestall invasion

Other countries may be more active on the international stage, while emphasising an intention to remain neutral in case of war close to the country. By such a declaration of intentions, the country hopes that all belligerents will count on the country's territory as off limits for the enemy, and hence unnecessary to waste resources on. The neutrality of Republic of Moldova is an interesting case. According to Ion Marandici, Moldova has chosen neutrality in order to avoid Russian security schemes and Russian military presence on its territory. Even if the country is constitutionally neutral, some researchers argue that de facto this former Soviet republic never was neutral, because parts of the Russian 14th army are present at Bendery. The same author suggests that one solution in order to avoid unnecessary contradictions and deepen at the same time the relations with NATO would be "to interpret the concept of permanent neutrality in a flexible manner".
Many countries made such declarations during World War II. Most, however, became occupied, and in the end only the states of Andorra, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland (with Liechtenstein), and Vatican (the Holy See) remained neutral of the European countries closest to the war. Their fulfilment to the letter of the rules of neutrality have been questioned: Ireland supplied some important secret information to the Allies; Portugal officially stayed neutral, but actively supported the Allies by providing overseas naval bases.
According to Edwin Reischauer, "To be neutral you must be ready to be highly militarized, like Switzerland or Sweden."Chapin, Emerson. "Edwin Reischauer, Diplomat and Scholar, Dies at 79," New York Times. September 2, 1990. However, other countries—like Costa Rica—have claimed that having no army would strengthen their neutrality and democratic stability.Military of Costa Rica Military of Costa Rica
