]]
Between 1990 and 2010, Sainsbury's turnover increased from £6.9 billion to £21.4 billion, with a small dip in 2005, a year in which parts of the business were restructured. Profits before and after tax have been turbulent, with most years showing a pre-tax profit of £500–700 million and a profit for the year between £300–500 million, with 2005 and 2006 showing much reduced figures. 2005 saw exceptional costs of £100 million, and in 2006 Sainsbury's incurred "one-off operating costs" of £152 million, including £63 million to terminate the IT outsourcing contract with Accenture. Earnings per share in years other than 1994, 2005 and 2006 fell in the range 14p–33p. News reports on Wednesday 14 November 2012 reported that Sainsburys had performed well financially that year, reaching 6% profits at the start of the year 2012. Part of the success was due to the supermarket manufacturing its own-brand labels.

Current operations

Sainsbury's currently operates supermarkets and convenience stores. It also operates Sainsbury's Bank, Mobile by Sainsbury's phone network, Sainsbury's fuel forecourts and Sainsbury's Online internet shopping services; and has a property portfolio worth £8.6 billion (as of March 2007).
It is the second largest supermarket chain in the UK (since 2014), and says it places an emphasis on a higher quality grocery offering compared to its other large rivals.
Areas of business for Sainsbury's include the following:
According to CACI, as of 2006, Sainsbury's has market dominance in 8 postcode areas; TQ (Torquay), SN (Swindon), GU (Guildford), RH (Redhill), DA (Dartford), SE (South East London), EN (Enfield) and WV (Wolverhampton).
It is particularly strong in London and the South-East, where it is based, and has powerful positions within many UK cities. For example in Southampton there are five Sainsbury's supermarkets (one is a Flagship store) and two Sainsbury's Local stores.

Stores

There are two main store formats; regular Sainsbury's supermarkets and Sainsbury's Local convenience stores. The chain previously used two other identities for its stores; Sainsbury's Central for smaller supermarkets and SavaCentre and later Sainsbury's SavaCentre for its hypermarkets.  Both identities were phased out in 2005.
At the end of its 2011/12 financial year Sainsbury's store portfolio was as follows.
Traditionally, the majority of Sainsbury's stores were located in London and south-east England. The company acquired the Midlands-based Thoroughgood in the 1930s. Expansion since 1945 has given the company national reach, although the chain is not as well-represented in Scotland as Tesco, and Morrisons (as Safeway dominated Scotland before being taken over by them). This is partly due to Sainsbury's having lost out to Tesco in the bidding war for William Low in the 1990s.

=Supermarkets=

Sainsbury's operates supermarkets that vary in size from under . The 'supermarket' group was previously split into three groups, 'Central', supermarkets and SavaCentre hypermarkets, however since 2005 and 2004 respectively the 'Central' and SavaCentre formats have been converted into the standard supermarket format.
On 29 September 2010, Sainsbury's opened one of its largest UK stores, an extension of its existing store in Crayford, Kent, which now has over ).
The refurbished Lincoln, Lincolnshire store opened on 24 November 2010 making it the UK's second largest Sainsbury's supermarket after Crayford at .Sainsbury Corporate website press release (Retrieved January 2011)
The most northern Sainsbury's store is a  supermarket in Nairn, which opened in August 2011. Helston, which opened in 2010, is the company's most south-westerly store. Another, in Heaton Park, opened in March 2012, marking the departure of the retail park that was there.
Stores in the 'supermarket' category all have similar layouts and operations but may vary in their offering to the customer. Most will have a convenience kiosk, produce, meat, fish, groceries and frozen food, and manned and self-service checkouts. However depending on the size of the store they may also have an instore bakery, butcher, fishmonger, delicatessen and pizza counters, a cafe, TU clothing, general merchandise, mobile phone shop, petrol station and online picking department.

==Sainsbury's Fuel==

Sainsbury's operates a chain of fuel forecourts located at its supermarkets selling diesel, petrol and CityPetrol. The chain first opened a forecourt in 1974 at its Croydon SavaCentre hypermarket, the forecourts were initially supplied by and marketed as Jet stations.

==Sainsbury's Café==

Sainsbury's operate cafes, marketed as Sainsbury's Cafè, in many of its supermarkets which are open for almost as long as the stores are open. These restaurants were first seen in Savacentre hypermarkets and were later introduced into supermarkets after their continued success. The cafes were previously known as J Sainsbury Restaurants.

=Convenience stores=

Sainsbury's operates Sainsbury's Local convenience stores, most of which are under  although two are larger.
As well as developing its own sites, Sainsbury's expanded its convenience protfolio through acquisitions of Bell's Stores, Jackson's Stores, JB Beaumont and SL Shaw Ltd. Sainsbury's initially retained the strong Bells, Jacksons and Beaumont branding. For example, refurbished stores were called Sainsbury's at Bells. These were effectively Sainsbury's Local stores with a revised fascia, retaining some features of the former local chain. Unrefurbished stores retained the original brand and logo, but still offered Sainsbury's own brand products, pricing and some point of sale, without accepting Nectar cards. The old websites were also retained with some Sainsbury's branding. However all of these acquired stores were fully converted to the Local fascia from 4 May 2007.
The most northern Sainsbury's Local is the Rosemount Place store in Aberdeen, which opened on 17 December 2010.
In July 2013, chief executive Justin King announced plans to focus on expanding its convenience stores to surpass the number of its supermarket properties by 2014.

=Sainsbury's Pharmacy=

Sainsbury's operates 270 pharmacies within its supermarkets, 37 of these house an NHS GP or 'nurse-led' clinic and 12 house private dental surgeries. Sainsbury's is also an emerging provider of outpatient hospital pharmacy services, operating pharmacies at three major UK hospitals: Guy's Hospital, St Thomas' Hospital and James Cook University Hospital. The interest in this business is part of Sainsbury's future plans to development new areas of business.

=Former formats=

Sainsbury's Freezer Centres were a frozen food chain operated between 1974 and 1986, the stores were entirely dedicated to frozen food. Due to competition from specialist frozen food chains such as Bejam, Sainsbury's converted its original service stores that were too small for use modern use to small frozen specialist stores.
Despite initial difficulty as only 11% of the population owned a freezer, the chain expanded to 21 stores at its height. As freezers became more popular, frozen food departments were designed into Sainsbury's main supermarkets, and the chain was sold Bejam in 1986, who were ultimately sold to Iceland in 1989.
SavaCentre was a chain of 13 hypermarkets operated between 1977 and 1989 in a joint venture with BHS. The stores ranged in size between . At the time of its inception it was the only dedicated hypermarket chain in the UK. The stores carried a complete range of both retailers products, and later included input from Habitat and Mothercare as they merged with BHS. In 1989 Sainsbury's bought out BHS's half stake, but still allowed BHS to retail from SavaCentres until they offered its own clothing and merchandise offering. From 1989 all SavaCentres were rebranded as Sainsbury's SavaCentres.
Sainsbury's SavaCentres were a chain of 13 hypermarkets operated between 1989 and 2005, after the ending of a joint venture with BHS, and a further 7 discount supermarkets, all solely operated by Sainsbury's. The stores ranged in size, the hypermarkets between . Store layout consisted of a 50:50 split between food and non-food shopping and also included features such as a petrol station and in-store cafe.
Despite hypermarkets often being regarded as a key element in the future of a grocery chain business, in 2004 Sainsbury's decided that the SavaCentre business would be cancelled and the stores remodelled into being standard supermarkets, albeit very large ones. Some were shared with other retailers such as Next and Marks and Spencer. Most of the SavaCentres are still trading under the Sainsbury's fascia, with the same intent of having both a large food and non-food offering and additional facilities for its customers.
In the late 1990s Sainsbury's opened supermarkets in small towns that were known as 'Country Town' shops in-house. They were small supermarkets that provided a good range of products without shoppers having to travel far to large stores. From 2004 onward these stores were rebranded and thought of as standard Sainsbury's supermarkets, and still trade to this day under the supermarket category despite their small nature.
Sainsbury's Central was a format of larger convenience stores based in town centres and commuter areas, offering food-to-go and essential items but often also stocking selected lines from mainline stores. Central stores were rebranded as standard Sainsbury's supermarkets, albeit small ones, from 2004 onwards.
Sainsbury's operated one alocohol hypermarket in partnership with Auchan in Calais, France for the lucrative UK booze cruise market. The store closed in 2010 after describing the operation as 'economically unviable'.UK firms shut French stores as 'booze cruise' declines
In 2002 Sainsbury's opened an experimental store in the Bluebird Building in Chelsea, London. The concept of the 'Market' store was to provide a large range of fresh meat, fish, delicatessen items and bread through colleagues serving over counters. Colleagues were specially hired for their skill and passion for their roles in store. The layout also provided a larger than usual area for retailing fresh produce. The store closed in 2004 after poor results.
A second, much larger version in Pimlico was designated as a 'Market' store, but the stores branding and layout was gradually reverted to a standard Sainsbury's store.
In 2011 Sainsbury's opened a trial food to go shop in Fleet Street London selling sandwiches, baguettes and hot snacks in an effort to expand its business into new areas of opportunity. The store closed a year later, after the stores lease was not renewed. Sainsbury's commented that footfall was too high to offer high standards of quality and service however it was not ruling out performing another trial in another location, explaining that it had learnt a lot.

Sainsbury's Online

Sainsbury's operates an internet shopping service branded as "Sainsbury's Online". To use this service customers choose their grocery items online. Picking assistants then collect the required items from the shop floor which are delivered to customers from a company selected store by van. This is available to about 75% of the UK population. The service is run from mid-size to larger stores which carry the full product range (or as close as possible) – over 200 stores operate the service.
The service was initially known as 'Sainsbury's Orderline', and later 'Sainsbury's to You' and 'Sainsbury's Entertain You'. In-house the department is colloquially called online or GOL.
The main Sainsbury's website advertises links to all of Sainsbury's other online services:

Sainsbury's Gift Cards and Sainsbury's Business Direct are transactional websites that sells gift cards, gift vouchers and food tokens with credit or value that can be spent at any Sainsbury store. Both products are not valid for buying certain products or services. The Gift Card website promotes the card as an ideal gift due to the large range of products and the number of stores available to spend them in. The Business Direct website, operated by MBL Solutions Ltd, promotes the cards as ideal for rewarding and motivating employees.

Sainsbury's Bank

In 1997 Sainsbury's Bank was established – a joint venture between J Sainsbury plc and the Bank of Scotland, later a part of the Lloyds Banking Group. Services offered include car, life, home, pet and travel insurance as well as health cover, loans, credit cards, savings accounts and Individual Savings Accounts.
Sainsbury's Bank also offers a Travel Money service in stores, with 'Sainsbury's Travel Money' opening the 100th Travel Money bureau in its estate in May 2010 at the Hempstead Valley shopping centre store. These foreign exchange bureaus are operated in association with Travelex and offer a full bureau de change service instore.
In 2013 J Sainsbury plc purchased the remaining 50% stake in the bank from Lloyds, meaning it now controls the bank.

Mobile by Sainsbury's

In 2013 Sainsbury's moved into the UK telecommunications industry when it launched its own mobile phone network called Mobile by Sainsbury's. The virtual network is operated in partnership with Vodafone. The company currently only provides a pay as you go service or a 30-day rolling contract bundle. Since its launch the service has been promoted heavily in store and most supermarkets started retailing SIM cards and handsets for the network.

Marketing and branding

Store fascias

Since 1869 Sainsbury's used various fascias using the title 'J Sainsbury'. This was replaced in 1999 to simply: 'Sainsbury's'. The flagship store in Greenwich, South London, first trialled the new look, leading to the term 'Greenwich Blue', which was used to describe the signature colour of new identity. After its success most stores were refurbished with dark blue walls, bright orange wall panels and grey shelving, as well as new checkouts. Individual counters also had different, brightly coloured panels behind them. Gradually the format was rolled out across the entire Sainsbury's estate.
Six years later another programme of refurbishment began, with the introduction of the new 'Try Something New Today' slogan. The entailed cream coloured shelving and checkouts, and a new aubergine-coloured staff uniform for all colleagues.
Old external signage bearing the 'J Sainsbury' name has still been found in use as recently as summer 2011 in Swindon, Ashbourne in Derbyshire and Blackheath, West Midlands.

Nectar loyalty card

Sainsbury's was a founding member of the UK's largest retail loyalty scheme called 'Nectar' in 2002. The scheme allows customers to earn points on almost everything bought from Sainsbury's as well as from other participating retailers in return for a large range of rewards. For every pound spent the customer earns 2 points. Sainsbury's also offers 1 bonus point for every carrier bag the customers reuses.
Sainsburys previously operated Sainsbury's Reward Scheme between 1995 and 2002 where customers used 'Reward Cards' or 'Storecards' to earn and spend points in a similar way, but limited to Sainsbury's businesses.

Sainsbury's Active Kids

Sainsbury's annually runs a voucher scheme for local organisations to redeem equipment for sports and other activities. Customers earn vouchers from their shopping which they donate to an organisation of their choice, who then redeem the vouchers with Sainsbury's, which credits their account with points to spend on items from a catalogue.

Brand ambassadors

Since 2000, Jamie Oliver was the public face of Sainsbury's, appearing on television and radio advertisements and in-store promotional material. The deal earned him an estimated £1.2 million every year. In the first two years of these advertisements were estimated to have given Sainsbury's an extra £1 billion of sales or £200 million gross profit. Mr Oliver's deal mutually ended in 2011.
Since 2010, paralympic swimmer Ellie Simmonds has been a Sainsbury's Active Kids ambassador. Both Simmonds and Beckham replaced Jamie Oliver as the face of Sainsbury's in an effort to emphasize the companies sponsorship of the London Paralympic Games.

Slogans

Sainsbury's currently uses the "Live Well For Less" slogan which was launched on 15 September 2011.  Over the years, Sainsbury's has used many slogans:

Colleagues benefit from a percentage discount, varying throughout the year, on most products, varying discounts on Sainsbury's Bank products and access to various discounts at hundreds of other retailers. Whilst the majority of colleagues do not belong to a union the company maintains good relationships with unions representing colleagues, the most popular being The Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (USDAW).

Controversies

Online only recruitment

In November 2007, Sainsbury's became the first major British employer to introduce an "internet only" staff recruitment system. At the time, it was estimated that the move would save the company £4million a year in administration costs.com This move came at a time when only approximately half of the British adult population was estimated to have access to the internet at home, though by 2010 it was estimated that more than 80% of the adult population had internet access.gov.Corporate.com

Treatment of overseas workers

In a 2006 report the British anti-poverty charity War on Want criticised the conditions faced by Kenyan workers supplying Sainsbury's with cut flowers.War on Want, Growing Pains

Food safety prosecutions

Sainsbury's supermarkets have been prosecuted for selling food past its use by date on more than one occasion,Sainsbury's branches fined over out-of-date food This is local London, 10 January 2008Sainsbury's fined for selling out of date food Mid Sussex Times, 14 May 2009 evidence also showed that some staff did not have the correct training to carry out their duties involving food safety. In the UK, the use by date is displayed only on meats and other foods that carry a risk of bacterial disease when kept too long or not stored correctly, and Sainsbury's would not have been prosecuted for selling foods past the 'display until', 'best before', or 'sell by' dates.

Distribution

Sainsbury's supply chain operates from 13 regional distribution centres (RDCs), with two national distribution centres for slower moving goods, and two frozen food facilities. In addition, the depot at Tamworth tranships general merchandise to the RDCs. Each depot is given a "Depot Code".
Sainsbury's also has a depot at Buntingford Hertfordshire. This depot is usually not in operation; however Sainsbury's still own the site and continue to use the depot at busy times, particularly at Christmas. Buntingford, on the A10 road, is ready for use as an emergency depot for the rest of the year.
Originally Sainsbury's ran its own distribution network. However after an industrial dispute with their drivers in the 1970s, and with the intention of streamlining and consolidation, much of the distribution is now contracted out – to distribution specialists such as TDG, DHL, NFT & Wincanton.

Archive

Sainsbury's archive of over 16,000 items relating to the business since its foundation is now kept at the Museum of London. The archive is particularly rich in the product packaging, advertising and retail stores areas.
