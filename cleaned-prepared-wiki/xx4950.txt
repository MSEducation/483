[[Inverse function]]

CATEGORIES: Basic concepts in set theory, Inverse functions

In mathematics, an inverse function is a function that reverses another function: if the function  form an identity.
A function " does not refer to numerical exponentiation: see composition monoid for explanation of this notation.

Definitions

Instead of considering the inverses for individual inputs and outputs, one can think of the function as sending the whole set of inputs, the domain, to a set of outputs, the range. Let , with the property:
If .
Stated otherwise, a function is invertible if and only if its inverse relation is a function on the range 
Not all functions have an inverse. For this rule to be applicable, each element  it is undefined.

Example: inverse operations that lead to inverse functions

In the context of proportionality, direct variation functions represent a relationship between x and y such that the quotient of the two variables equal a constant, k. Thus, the direct variation function is as follows:  . As x increases, a larger number is dividing the constant k, so y is approaching 0.


Example: percentages

Despite their familiarity, percentage changes do not have a straightforward inverse. That is, an X per cent fall is not the inverse of an X per cent rise.

Example: squaring and square root functions

The function  may or may not be invertible, depending on what kinds of numbers are being considered (the "domain").
If the domain is the real numbers, then each possible result y corresponds to two different starting points in  is negative.
If only positive numbers (and zero) are being considered, then the function is injective and invertible.

Inverses in higher mathematics

The definition given above is commonly adopted in set theory and calculus. In higher mathematics, the notation
means ".
When using codomains, the inverse of a function .

Inverses and composition

If , then
This statement is equivalent to the first of the above-given definitions of the inverse, and it becomes equivalent to the second definition if . Using the composition of functions we can rewrite this statement as follows:
where ; that is, the function that leaves its argument unchanged. In category theory, this statement is used as the definition of an inverse morphism.
If we think of composition as a kind of multiplication. A similar notation is used for iterated functions.
Another way to look at this is to consider composition as an operation on functions. Thinking about real functions with a single independent variable (most functions the normal person runs in to), then the inverse function composed with the original function should give us the identity, and vise versa, the original function composed with the inverse function will give us the identity. The inverse in this case would be the function that when composed with another function will give you that other function, 

Note on notation

The superscript notation for inverses can sometimes be confused with other uses of superscripts, especially when dealing with trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. To avoid this confusion, the notations 
Whereas the notation .
The expression  (actually a partial inverse; see below).  To avoid confusion, an inverse trigonometric function is often indicated by the prefix "arc". For instance, the inverse of the sine function is typically called the arcsine function, written as arcsin, which is, like sin, conventionally denoted in roman type and not in italics (note that software libraries of mathematical functions often use the name asin):
The function :
Hyperbolic functions behave similarly, using the prefix "ar" for their inverse functions, as in arsinh for the inverse function of sinh, and .

Properties

Uniqueness

If an inverse function exists for a given function , it is unique: it must be the inverse relation.

Symmetry

There is a symmetry between a function and its inverse.  Specifically, if :
This follows from the connection between function inverse and relation inverse, because inversion of relations is an involution.
This statement is an obvious consequence of the deduction that for  to be invertible it must be injective (first definition of the inverse) or bijective (second definition). The property of involutive symmetry can be concisely expressed by the following formula:
The inverse of a composition of functions is given by the formula
Notice that the order of .
For example, let  is the function that first multiplies by three and then adds five:
To reverse this process, we must first subtract five, and then divide by three:
This is the composition
.

Self-inverses

If  is its own inverse:
More generally, a function .  Such a function is called an involution.

Inverses in calculus

Single-variable calculus is primarily concerned with functions that map real numbers to real numbers.  Such functions are often defined through formulas, such as:
A function  value, and thus passes the horizontal line test.

Formula for the inverse

One approach to finding a formula for  is the function
then we must solve the equation :
Thus the inverse function  is given by the formula
Sometimes the inverse of a function cannot be expressed by a formula with a finite number of terms.  For example, if  is the function
then .  The formula for this inverse has an infinite number of terms: 

Graph of the inverse

If   is invertible, then the graph of the function
is the same as the graph of the equation
This is identical to the equation  axes.  This is equivalent to reflecting the graph across the line
.

Inverses and derivatives

A continuous function  is one-to-one (and hence invertible) if and only if it is either strictly increasing or decreasing (with no local maxima or minima).  For example, the function
is invertible, since the derivative
 is always positive.
If the function .  The derivative of the inverse is given by the inverse function theorem:
If we set , then the formula above can be written
This result follows from the chain rule (see the article on inverse functions and differentiation).
The inverse function theorem can be generalized to functions of several variables.  Specifically, a differentiable multivariable function .

Real-world examples

1. Let  be the function that converts a temperature in degrees Celsius to a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit:
then its inverse function converts degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius:
since
2. Suppose  assigns each child in a family its birth year. An inverse function would output which child was born in a given year. However, if the family has twins (or triplets) then the output cannot be known when the input is the common birth year. As well, if a year is given in which no child was born then a child cannot be named. But if each child was born in a separate year, and if we restrict attention to the three years in which a child was born, then we do have an inverse function. For example,
3. Let  = 10%, we find that applying the first function followed by the second does not restore the original value of $100, demonstrating the fact that, despite appearances, these two functions are not inverses of each other.

Generalizations

Partial inverses

Even if a function  by restricting the domain.  For example, the function
is not one-to-one, since , in which case
(If we instead restrict to the domain .)  Alternatively, there is no need to restrict the domain if we are content with the inverse being a multivalued function:
Sometimes this multivalued inverse is called the full inverse of .
For a continuous function on the real line, one branch is required between each pair of local extrema.  For example, the inverse of a cubic function with a local maximum and a local minimum has three branches (see the picture to the right).
These considerations are particularly important for defining the inverses of trigonometric functions.  For example, the sine function is not one-to-one, since
for every real ).  However, the sine is one-to-one on the interval
.  The following table describes the principal branch of each inverse trigonometric function:

Left and right inverses

If  such that
That is, the function  satisfies the rule
Thus, .
A right inverse for  such that
That is, the function  satisfies the rule
Thus,  has a right inverse if and only if it is surjective (though constructing such an inverse in general requires the axiom of choice).
An inverse which is both a left and right inverse must be unique. Likewise, if .

Preimages

If :
The preimage of .
Similarly, if :
For example, take a function . This function is not invertible for reasons discussed above. Yet preimages may be defined for subsets of the codomain:
The preimage of a single element  as a level set.
