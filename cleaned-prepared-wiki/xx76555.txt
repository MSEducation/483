The Peugeot 405 is a large family car released by the French automaker Peugeot in July 1987 and which continues to be manufactured under licence outside France. It was voted European Car of the Year for 1988 by the largest number of votes in the history of the contest. About 2.5 million vehicles have been sold worldwide in left-hand and right-hand-drive versions, as a berline (saloon) and break (estate).
Its appearance is similar to the Alfa Romeo 164, launched the same year and also styled by Pininfarina. It used TU/XU petrol and XUD diesel engines.

History

In July 1987, Peugeot unveiled ten versions of the 405 simultaneously for the 1988 model year, with sales on the continent beginning before Christmas, and sales in the United Kingdom beginning in March. Deliveries began in October 1987 for the saloon, and May 1988 for the estate. No coupé was ever offered to the public, unlike the 504 and later 406, as only two examples of the purpose-built 405 Turbo-16 (not to be confused with 405 T16) were made. The 405 was available as a 4-door only. Four-cylinder petrol engines included 65, 92, 110, 125, and 160 hp (48, 69, 82, 93, and 119 kW) units. A 1.8-litre diesel engine, with or without a turbo (70 and 90 hp (52 and 67 kW)) was added to the range during 1988 as was the 5-door estate.
Its launch came a year after the demise of the Talbot marque on passenger cars, with the Alpine (originally a Chrysler Europe product) being the last 405-sized car from Talbot. The slightly smaller 305 was discontinued from the Peugeot range soon after the 405's launch, with the larger 505 being axed a while later, with Peugeot's new range-topping model after 1989 being the 605.
The 405 was the last Peugeot vehicle sold in the United States, on sale between 1988 and 1991, including the Mi16 model.
The 405 was a popular model in Thailand, following the success of the Peugeot 505 after the Government of Thailand cancelled a restriction on CBU car imports in the late 1980s.
By 1989, 500,000 vehicles had been produced, A minor facelift in 1991 included a change in transmission with the BE1 replaced by the BE3 and updates to the dashboard, steering wheel, and soundproofing.
In 1993, a revised 405, referred to as the Phase 2 model, was introduced featuring a new rear design with new rear lights and boot design, and a revised interior with a new dashboard. The turbocharged, 16v, 4WD 405 T16 (LHD only) was also introduced. The 405's replacement, the 406, was introduced in 1995, and the 405 saloon was discontinued in Europe, whilst the estate continued on sale in Europe until 1997. About 2.5 million vehicles were sold worldwide.

Manufacturing

The 405 has been manufactured in a number of world-wide locations. Designed in France, it has been manufactured in:

Models

The 405 has been available in LHD, and RHD versions, as a saloon and estate, in front-wheel, and four-wheel drive. 
The 405 range included three petrol engines and two diesel engines, all four-cylinder with no 6-cylinder option, in a variety of states of tune and specification. The range was tailored to suit different export markets. The 1.6-litre saloon featured a low drag co-efficient of  at 6000 rpm. The 1.9-litre (1,905 cc) engine was available with a five speed manual gearbox, with an option of an automatic in the lower powered version. 
The 8-valve version of the engine was available in two levels of tune;  at 6500 rpm and could reach a top speed of 220 km/h.l'auto-journal Salon 91-92, number 14/15, p. 56

Iranian variants

Iran Khodro also produces several models derived from the 405. The Peugeot Pars, also known as the Peugeot Persia, is a facelifted 405 with a redesigned front end including clear lamp lenses and a revised rear. The Peugeot RD is a rear wheel drive car which has a 405 body and mechanical parts from the Paykan.
The Samand, which was designed to be a "national car" for Iran, is also based on the 405 platform. It replaced the long-running Paykan which was itself based on the Hillman Hunter, an ancestor (in corporate ownership and model positioning terms) of the 405, having been produced by the Rootes Group and Chrysler UK from 1963 until 1979 - the year that Peugeot purchased Chrysler's European operations.

Motorsport

The most famous motorsport version of the 405, the rallying 405 Turbo 16 GR, was very different from the road-going 405. It was built in a coupe body style in mid-engine configuration, had constant four wheel drive with electronically adjustable center differential like the 205 T16, as it was based on the same technology. At least four were produced, competing in  hill climbs and the Paris-Dakar rally. Today, three are in the official Peugeot museum, and the other is in a private collection.
Racing 405s much closer in specification to the road-going models were campaigned for several years in European touring car racing during the early to mid 1990s, most notably in the British Touring Car Championship and the French Supertourisme Championship. In Britain, the 405 did not achieve much success, but the car won the French series in both 1994 and 1995, in the hands of Laurent Aïello.
