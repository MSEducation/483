Associated Press NFL POY/MVP Award

The AP NFL MVP award is voted upon by sportswriters at the end of the regular season, before the playoffs, though the results are not announced to the public until the day before the Super Bowl.
The award has been shared twice, in 1997 and 2003. Peyton Manning has won the award five times, the most of any player. Jim Brown, Johnny Unitas, and Brett Favre were named MVP three times, while Joe Montana, Steve Young, Kurt Warner, and Tom Brady have each won the award twice. Favre is the only player to win the award three consecutive years, and Brady is the only player to ever be voted unanimously (2010). Most awardees have been quarterbacks and running backs; the only defensive players to be so honored have been Alan Page and Lawrence Taylor, and the only special teams player was Mark Moseley.
