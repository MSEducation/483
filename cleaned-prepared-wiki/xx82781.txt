Quad City International Airport 
Quad City is the third-busiest commercial airport in Illinois â€“ Chicago's O'Hare and Midway International Airports lead the state.  The international designation is for being an official port of entry and having a U.S. customs port of entry.  A Foreign Trade Zone and U.S. Customs Office are located at the airport, enabling international inbound and outbound shipments.  While there are no scheduled commercial flights to international destinations, local corporate jets (especially those owned by Deere & Company) do make periodic non-stop trips to destinations in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America.

It includes a processing room, an interview room, space for agricultural inspections, office space, and holding cells for passengers who are prohibited from entering the U.S. or who are being detained and transported by law enforcement.   Phase two of the project will renovate the remainder of the building to create an international terminal should the airport establish direct international commercial flights.
