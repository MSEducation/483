After their fourth (senior) year, students in these programs had to hang over an additional year to complete their degrees.

Concerts

The Hangovers have two major on-campus concerts every year, one in the Fall and one in the late Spring.  The Fall concert is named Fall Tonic, a title resurrected in and used since 1980 in homage to the Sherwoods, who preceded the Hangovers as a Glee Club subset and had an annual autumn concert of the same title.  The first guest groups at the 1980 Fall Tonic were Yale's Proof in the Pudding, University of Rochester's Yellowjackets, and Cornell's Nothing But Treble.
The Hangovers' Spring concert, in keeping with their penchant with alcoholic double entendres, is called Happy Hour.  The first Happy Hour was held in Barnes Hall in the early spring of 1993.  Happy Hour 2, and every Happy Hour since, was held in Sage Chapel (due to its increased seating capacity and it being home to many Cornell University Glee Club events).  Happy Hour 2 was also the first to be held the night before Slope Day (as a "kick-off" event).

Recordings

The Hangovers have released numerous albums over the years, the titles of which are all puns on drinking, or drinking-related themes.  As Michael Slon points out in his book Songs From The Hill, one album, Behind Bars, manages to achieve quadruple-entendre: first, for the normal meaning of the phrase, meaning "incarcerated"; second, the reference to bars as drinking establishments; third, an allusion to bars as a period of music, and finally, as a reference to the striped rugby shirts the Hangovers wear at some performances. In 1980, their original single titled "Facetime" received national recognition and earned mention in Yale's "Guide to Selective Colleges." The song was recently re-recorded on the album "Blackout" with another original song, "River to the Sea".
The Hangovers have released thirteen albums, the last seven on compact disc:
Three Sheets to the Wind received four award nominations for the 2009 Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards: Best Male Collegiate Album, Best Humor Song ("You Got a 'C' "), Best Male Collegiate Solo (Evan Graham for "Ignition (Remix)"), and Best Hip-Hop/R&B Song ("Ignition (Remix)")."

Alumni include such notables as Alan Keyes. Numerous alumni are also involved in post-collegiate a cappella projects.  Notable among these are members of the Tone Rangers, a Washington, D.C.-based a cappella group composed almost entirely of Hangovers and Yale University Whiffenpoofs alumni, and The Breakers, a group of former Hangovers who recently toured Malaysia.
