He undertook a number of speaking engagements for the party including speaking in support of Labour leader Ramsay Macdonald at Aberavon. In 1927 he produced his first article for the press entitled "The Need for a Lib-Lab Coalition". He was becoming disenchanted with the Labour party and its support for nationalization.

He travelled around Britain speaking in support of the Liberal party's new Industrial policies.
