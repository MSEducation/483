History

The company was created on October 20, 1983, as Central Services Organization, Inc. as part of the 1982 Modification of Final Judgment that broke up the Bell System. It later received the name Bell Communications Research, Inc. Bellcore was a consortium established by the Regional Bell Operating Companies upon their separation from AT&T. Since AT&T retained Bell Laboratories, the operating companies wanted to have their own R&D facility. Bellcore, the tenth company to register a .
Bellcore's initial staff and corporate culture drew heavily via transfers of personnel from the nearby Bell Labs locations in northern New Jersey, plus additional staff from AT&T and the regional operating companies. The company originally established its headquarters in Livingston with dedication by New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean in 1985, but moved its headquarters to Morristown a decade later.
Although Bellcore's R&D and standard setting were of considerable importance to the telecommunications industry in general, the asset value of the company was largely centered in ownership of the approx. 6,000 pieces of network software, many of enormous size, that functionally ran the U.S. telephone system.
In 1992 issues related to the management of the software systems led to the formation of a Study Group of senior business and legal representatives of the seven Owner Companies, commonly referred to as the OC's, together with the executive leadership of Bellcore, and facilitated by Marc Paul Chinoy, President of The Regis Group, Inc. of Leesburg, Virginia.  A structured deliberation of the joint leadership continued on a daily basis until November 1996, when by unanimous decision, the Study Group recommended, and the seven OC CEO's approved the divestiture of the company, while retaining the name and logo.
