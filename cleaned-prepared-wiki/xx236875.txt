Career

Toro y Moi put out a collection of experimental "stream of consciousness" recordings under his side project Sides of Chaz.
In January 2013, Toro y Moi released his third studio album, Anything in Return, which he described as having "sort of a '90s dance mix sound." According to him, the album "was definitely influenced by lots of different types of house, from deep house to two-step ... The chords in Change' and 'Say That' useâ€”that's just something I've been a fan of for a while. I really wanted to mess around with those kinds of elements and revisit what I did on Causers This, but make those elements a little bit better and more apparent."
Toro y Moi also has a dance side project named Les Sins.
In the studio, he utilizes a Roland JX-3P, a Moog, and multiple soft synths.
