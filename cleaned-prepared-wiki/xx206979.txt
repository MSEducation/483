Before the Second World War the Battery was absorbed into the Field Batteries of the 3rd Field Regiment, and did not see service as a unit. The battery was reformed as the 103rd Anti-Aircraft Battery from 1954 to 1957 stationed at Middle Head Barracks, Sydney, as part of 1 Field Regiment. During the 1960 to 1967 it changed designation again to the 103rd Field Battery, as part of the new Regular 4 Field Regiment stationed at Wacol, Brisbane. During the deployment of Australian Army to Malaysia the Battery was a part of the Far Eastern Strategic Reserve stationed at Camp Terendak, Malacca, returning to Australia to become a part of the 1st Field Regiment at Kokoda Barracks, Holsworthy.

During the Vietnam War the 104 Field Battery also served with the 12 Field Regiment. The 161 Field Battery RNZA was also attached to the Regiment.

Post Vietnam

The Regiment was a creation of the reorganisation of the Australian Army as a result of the Vietnam War experience. During the mid-1970s the 8/12 Medium Regiment included  8/12 Regiment Australian Artillery Association
The 103 Battery served in two roles at this time as a depot support of the Regiment for the School of Artillery, while the 8/12 Regiment was also responsible for direct support to the 1st Task Force. Consequently it was issued with both the six M2A2 105 mm guns and the six  guns.
As part of the 1980s restructuring the 131 Divisional Locating Battery became an independent battery for divisional assignment at Enoggera Army Camp in Brisbane. The 102 Field Battery was redesignated 102 Medium Battery and disbanded in 1987. As a result of this downsizing, the Headquarters Battery was reduced in size in 1994.
During 1996 the 101st Field Battery was removed from the 1st Field Regiment and embedded as a Fire Support Company into the 6 RAR which adopted the A 21 Motorised Battalion structure that included supporting arms under the Restructuring of the Army (RTA) initiatives trial.6rarassociation.htm As an integrated A 21 Motorised Battalion, the 6 RAR was restructured with one Reserve and one Regular Motorised Rifle Companies (Alpha and Delta Company respectively). The Fire Support Company included Indirect Fire Platoon which included 4 x 155mm howitzers and two 120mm mortars (replicated by 2 x 105mm field guns) and Direct Fire Platoon with four ASLAV 25 vehicles and a Weapon Locating/AMS Section. Reconnaissance and Surveillance Company included a Reconnaissance Platoon, a Surveillance Platoon, a Combat Engineer Platoon and a Sniper Section. The Administration Company was retitled Combat Service Support Company.
After the deployment to East Timor, the "A" Field Battery was assigned to the 4th Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery in 1999, further reducing the Regiment in size. During 1999 the 8/12 Medium Regiment was relocated to the Robertson Barracks in Darwin where the 103 Medium Battery, while preparing for the move from Sydney to Darwin deployed its elements to East Timor as part of INTERFET, and later as a part of a UN Peace Keeping Force OP TANAGER, and was later joined by the newly recreated 101 Medium Battery.
In January 2011 the Australian Regular Army field regiments were reorganised in preparation for re-equipment with new guns and battle management systems to each contain three observation post batteries, supported by a single gun battery equipped with 12 guns. As part of this reorganisation the regiments were renamed, with the words "field" or "medium" removed from their title. Under the new structure each regiment is capable of providing a brigade-level Joint Fires and Effects Coordination Centre (JFECC) and every observation post batter provieds a battle group JFECC as well as three combat team joint fires teams (JFT). Every gun battery now comprises three troops of 155 mm towed howitzers.
Under the Land 17 project in 2012 8th/12th Regiment will receive the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS), which is a fully automated digital battle-management system. It will also take delivery of the Digital Terminal Control System for observation post batteries. The regiment is currently based at Ypres Lines, Robertson Barracks, Palmerston. with 102 battery detached, based at Royal Australian Air Force base Edinburgh
As at Jan 2012, 8/12 Regt is equipped with AFATDS and the M777 LWH.
