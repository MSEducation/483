Red and white blood cell production is regulated with great precision in healthy humans, and the production of leukocytes is rapidly increased during infection. The proliferation and self-renewal of these cells depend on Growth factors. One of the key player in self-renewal and development of haematopoietics cells is stem cell factor (SCF). 
These stimulate granulocyte formation and are active on either progenitor cells or end product cells.
Erythropoietin is required for a myeloid progenitor cell to become an erythrocyte. Lodish, Harvey F. 5. ed. : - New York : W. H. Freeman and Co., 2003, 973 s. b ill. ISBN 0-7167-4366-3 On the other hand, thrombopoietin makes myeloid progenitor cells differentiate to megakaryocytes (thrombocyte-forming cells).
Examples of cytokines and the blood cells they give rise to, is shown in the picture to the right.

Transcription factors in hematopoiesis

Growth factors initiate signal transduction pathways, which leads to activation of transcription factors. Signal, which is received by cells, is not digital. Its mean, that cells can distinguish time, amount, and frequency. For example long-term expression of PU.1 resulted in myeloid commitment, short-term induction of PU.1 activity led to the formation of immature eosinophils.
First key player of differentiation from HSC to multipotent progenitor (MPP) is transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer binding protein alfa (C/EBP alfa). Mutations in C/EBP alfa are associated with acute myeloid leukaemia.
Among other factors are Ikaros, Gfi1 or IRF8. What is of greater significance is the occurrence of the same factors multiple times in the haematopoiesis tree. For example, CEBP alfa in neutrophil development or Pu.1. in monocytes and dendritic cells development. It is important to note that processes are not unidirectional.
As example I would like to introduce PAX5 factor. 
It was Known, that it is important factor in B-cell development and thus associated with lymphomas.
Mutations in transtription factors are tightly connected to blood cancers, as acute myeloid leukaemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (All). For example Ikaros is known to be regulator of numerous biological events. Mice with no Ikaros lack B cells, Natural killer and T cells.

The myeloid-based model

For a decade now, the evidence is growing that HSC maturation follows a myeloid-based model instead of the 'classical' schoolbook dichotomy model. In the latter model, the HSC first generates a common myeloid-erythroid progenitor (CMEP) and a common lymphoid progenitor (CLP). The CLP produces only T or B cells. The myeloid-based model postulates that HSCs first diverge into the CMEP and a common myelo-lymphoid progenitor (CMLP), which generates T and B cell progenitors through a bipotential myeloid-T progenitor and a myeloid-B progenitor stage. The main difference is that in this new model, all erythroid, T and B lineage branches retain the potential to generate myeloid cells (even after the segregation of T and B cell lineages). The model proposes the idea of erythroid, T and B cells as specialized types of a prototypic myeloid HSC. Read more in Kawamoto et al. 2010.
