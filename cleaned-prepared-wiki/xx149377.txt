A Nigerian international in the 2000s, Uche represented his country at the 2010 World Cup.

Club career

Early years

Born in an Aba, Abia, Uche's career began in Nigeria with Enyimba International and Iwuanyanwu Nationale. In the 2000–01 season he joined RCD Espanyol B in Spain, failing to receive any first-team opportunities and competing with the reserves in the third division.
Uche then transferred to Wisła Kraków, playing there until 2005 – winning the Polish League three times and Polish Cup twice – except for the 2004–05 campaign when he represented FC Girondins de Bordeaux, on loan.com, 30 August 2004

Almería

For 2005–06 Uche moved to UD Almería, and was instrumental in helping the Andalusia outfit to its first ever La Liga promotion in his second year, scoring eight league goals (with three in the last five matches). He made his debut in the competition on 26 August 2007, coming from the bench in a 3–0 away win against Deportivo de La Coruña.
On 11 January 2009, profiting from the absence of first-choice Álvaro Negredo, Uche netted both goals in a 2–2 draw at Espanyol.
In the following summer Negredo was sold to Sevilla FC – via Real Madrid – and Uche became Almería's most important offensive reference. He finished the 2009–10 season with a career-best nine goals, namely a brace on 4 May 2010 against Villarreal CF in a 4–2 home win, which all but certified the club's permanence in the top level for another year.
Uche spent the first month of 2010–11 on the sidelines, due to injury. In the second match upon his return, on 26 September 2010, he scored twice at Deportivo (2–0) for Almería's first win of the campaign, going on to net seven in 32 games as the team was finally relegated after a four-year stay.

Neuchâtel / Espanyol

On 4 August 2011, Uche joined Swiss Super League side Neuchâtel Xamax on a two-year deal.
Uche opened his scoring account for his new club on 25 February 2012 in a 1–2 home loss against Levante UD.

Late career

On 20 July 2012 Uche moved to Turkish side Kasımpaşa SK, signing a three-year contract. On 1 October of the following year he switched clubs and countries again, penning a deal with El Jaish SC in Qatar.

International career

Uche made his debut for Nigeria on 21 June 2003, in an African Nations Cup qualifier against Angola, scoring in the process. He represented the nation at the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations, going scoreless for the eventual third-placed team.
After a solid club season Uche was picked for that year's FIFA World Cup, in South Africa: on 17 June, against Greece, he opened the score from a free kick, but the Africans soon were reduced to ten men and lost 1–2.
