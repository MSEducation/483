History

Aboriginals

For tens of thousands of years, Canada was inhabited by Aboriginal peoples from a variety of different cultures and of several major linguistic groupings.  Each of the aboriginal communities had (and have) their own unique musical traditions. Chanting - singing is widely popular and most use a variety of musical instruments.

17th century

French settlers and explorers to New France brought with them a great love of song, dance and fiddle playing. Beginning in the 1630s French and Aboriginal  children at Quebec City were taught to sing and play European instruments, like viols, violins, guitars, transverse flutes, drums, fifes and trumpets.  Ecole des Ursulines  and The Ursuline Convent are among North America's oldest schools and  the first institutions of learning for women in North America. both were founded in 1639 by French nun Marie of the Incarnation (1599–1672) alongside the laywoman Marie-Madeline de Chauvigny de la Peltrie (1603–1671) and are the  first Canadian  institutions to have music as part of the curriculum. editors, Thomas Carson, Joann Cerrito - Washington, D.C.

Notre-Dame de Québec Cathedral build in 1647  is the primate church of Canada and seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec.

Canada, New France  first formal  ball  was given by Louis-Théandre Chartier de Lotbinière (1612–1688) on 4 Feb. 1667. Jolliet is said to have played  the  organ,  harpsichord, flute, and trumpet. 1700, under British rule at this time, an organ was installed in Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal and  military bands gave concerts on the Champ de Mars. A French-born priest, René Ménard, composed motets around 1640, and a second Canadian-born priest, Charles-Amador Martin, is credited with the plainchant music for the  Sacrae familiae felix spectaculum, in celebration of the Holy Family feast day in 1700.

18th century

Historically,  music was  composed in  Canada's colonies and settlements  during the 18th century, although very few popular named works have survived or were even published. The French and Indian Wars began and left the population economically drained and ill-equipped to develop cultural pursuits properly. The part-time composers of this period were nonetheless often quite skilled. Traditional songs and dances, such as those of the Habitants and Métis, were transmitted orally, from generation to generation and from village to village, thus  people felt no need to transcribe or publish them. ed. by Keith MacMillan and John Beckwith. Toronto, Ont. Oxford University Press, 1975. Printed music was required, for music teachers and their pupils, who were from the privileged minority where domestic music making was considered a proof of gentility. Canadian Musical Heritage Society, 1983 series of historical Canadian MUSIC SCORES publications.(ISBN 0-919883-00-1) Music publishing and printing in Europe by this time was a thriving industry, but it did not begin in Canada until the  19th century. by Keith MacMillan and John Beckwith. Toronto. Oxford University Press, 1975 (ISBN 0-19-540244-8) Canadian composers were not able to focus entirely on creating new music in these years, most made their living in other musical activities such as leading choirs, church organists and teaching.

Regimental bands were  musically  part of civil life, they featured perhaps a dozen woodwind and brass instruments, performing  at parades, festive ceremonies, minuets, country dances and balls. Ottawa : Canadian Association of Music Libraries, 1983. p96
After the 1760s, regular concerts became a part of the cultural landscape, as well as a wide variety of dancing. Operatic excerpts began to appear, and before the end of the century Canada had its first home-grown grand opera.  A "Concert Hall" existed in Québec City by 1764 and subscription concerts by 1770, given, one may presume, by band players and skilled amateurs. Allen Clingman  Brian A. Roberts, ed.

19th century

The beginning  of the 19th century  Canadian musical ensembles had started  forming in great numbers, writing waltzes, quadrilles, polkas and galops.  "The Canadian Boat Song" was so popular that it was published several times over the next forty years in Boston, New York and Philadelphia. Dancing likewise was extremely  popular form of entertainment as noted In 1807 by the Scottish traveler and artist George Heriot (1759–1839), who wrote..
Among the earliest musical societies were Halifaxs "New Union Singing Society" of 1809 and Quebec's "Harmonic Society" of  1820. One of the first registered all-civilian  musical ensemble was a religious sect organized from Upper Canada called the Children of Peace in 1820.
The  Great Migration of Canada from 1815 to 1850, done largely by Irish, British and Scottish immigrants, broadened considerably the Canadian musical culture.
By the time of Canadian Confederation (1867), songwriting had become a favored means of personal expression across the land. In a society in which most middle-class families now owned a piano, and standard education included at least the rudiments of music, the result was often an original song. by Zuk, Ireneus.  Baltimore, Md. Peabody Institute, 1985. 429 p. (Ref ML128 .P3Z85 1985t) Such stirrings frequently occurred in response to noteworthy events, and few local or national excitements were allowed to pass without some musical comment.

The 1870s saw several conservatories opened their doors, providing their string, woodwind and brass faculty, leading to the opportunity for any  class level of society  to learn music.
"O Canada" was originally commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, the Honourable Théodore Robitaille (1834–1897), for the 1880 St. Jean-Baptiste Day ceremony.  Calixa Lavallée (1842–1891) wrote the music, which was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier (1839–1920).  The text was originally only in French, before it was translated to English in 1906.
Leo, the Royal Cadet a light opera with music by Oscar Ferdinand Telgmann and a libretto by George Frederick Cameron was composed in Kingston, Ontario in 1889. The work centres on Nellie's love for Leo, a cadet at the Royal Military College of Canada who becomes a hero serving during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879. The operetta focussed on typical character types, events and concerns of Telgmann and Cameron's time and place.

Prior to the development of the gramophone, Canadian songwriters' works were published as sheet music, or in periodicals in local newspapers such as The Montreal Gazette and Toronto Empire.

Canadian artists and Canadian ensembles were generally forced to turn toward the United States to establish healthy long lasting careers during the 1960s.
The American and British counterculture explosion and hippie movement had diverted music to  that  which was  dominated by socially and American politically incisive lyrics by the late 1960s . 27 The music was an attempt to reflect upon the events of the time -- civil rights, the war in Vietnam  and the rise of feminism. On January 18, 1971 regulations came into force requiring AM radio stations to devote 30 per cent of their musical selections to Canadian content. Although this was (and still is) controversial, it quite clearly contributed to the development of a nascent Canadian pop star system. and on April 18, 2013, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
Canada's first nation-wide music awards  began as a reader poll conducted by Canadian music industry trade magazine RPM Weekly in December 1964.

Canadian music changed course in the 1980s and 1990s, the changing fast-paced culture was accompanied by an explosion in youth culture.
