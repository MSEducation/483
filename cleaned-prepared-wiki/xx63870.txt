[[Phonological history of English low back vowels]]

CATEGORIES: American English, Scottish English, Canadian English, Splits and mergers in English phonology, Sociolinguistics

The phonology of the low back vowels of the English language has undergone changes both overall and with regional variations, dating from Late Middle English (c. 1400) to the present. The sound changes heard in modern English mostly begin with the Great Vowel Shift, and continue through the development and recognition of the General American dialect and the cot–caught merger.

Late Middle English

In Late Middle English (c. 1400) the following low back vowels were present, distinguished by length:Barber, pp. 108,111

16th century changes

By 1600 the following changes had occurred:Barber,  pp. 108, 111, 116
There were thus three low back monophthongs at this time:  in corn.

17th century changes

By 1700 the following further developments had taken place:
This left the language with three low back vowels:

Father–bother merger

The father–bother merger is a merger of the Early Modern English vowels  is also found in Norwich, the West Country, the West Midlands and in Hiberno-English, but apparently with no phonemic merger (typically because vowel length remains phonemic).  The card–cord merger is a roughly similar merger, but occurring before r.

Lot–cloth split

The lot–cloth split is the result of a late 17th century sound change that lengthened  of words like thought. The sound change is most consistent in the last syllable of a word, and much less so elsewhere (see below). Some words that entered the language later, especially when used more in writing than speech, are exempt from the lengthening, e.g. joss and Goth with the short vowel.
The cot–caught merger, discussed below, has removed the distinction in some dialects, and may make the lot-cloth split less noticeable.
As a result of the lengthening and raising, in the above-mentioned accents cross rhymes with sauce, and soft and cloth also have the vowel  in RP.  The split still exists in some older RP speakers, including Queen Elizabeth II.
The lengthening and raising generally happened before the fricatives  for chocolate. (Obviously, in accents of American English that are subject to the cot–caught merger, there is no difference between words that did and those that did not undergo the change.)
In the varieties of American English that have the lot–cloth split, the lot vowel is usually symbolized as  in some accents.
There are also significant complexities in the pronunciation of written o occurring before one of the triggering phonemes , depending on the speaker).
The word gone usually has  in accents of New York and New Jersey which have the split.
The word on is pronounced with  in the Midland, Mid-Atlantic and South.

Cot–caught merger

The cot–caught merger (also known as the low back merger) is a phonemic merger, a sound change, that occurs in some varieties of English. The merger occurs in some accents of Scottish English and to some extent in Mid Ulster English but is best known as a phenomenon of many varieties of North American English. Many speakers of Singaporean English also merge the vowels of "cot" and "caught".nie.sg/phonetic/papers/teach-sge.pdf
The sound change causes the vowel in caught, talk, and small to be pronounced like the vowel in cot, rock, and doll, so that cot and caught, for example, become homophones, and the two vowels merge into a single phoneme.  The change does not affect a vowel followed by , so barn and born remain distinct, and starring and warring do not rhyme.
The presence of the merger and its absence are both found in many different regions of the continent, and in both urban and rural environments.
The symbols traditionally used to transcribe the vowels in the words cot and caught as spoken in American English are .
According to Labov, Ash, and Boberg, the merger does not generally occur in the southern United States (with exceptions), along most of the American side of the Great Lakes region, or in the "Northeast Corridor" extended metropolitan region from Providence, Rhode Island to Baltimore.  Areas where it occurs include:
The distribution of the merger is complex, even without taking into account the mobility of the American population; there are pockets of speakers with the merger in areas that lack it, and vice versa.  There are areas where the merger has only partially occurred, or is in a state of transition.  For example, based on research directed by William Labov (using telephone surveys), younger speakers in Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas exhibit the merger while speakers older than 40 typically do not., citing the TELSUR project  The 2003 Harvard Dialect Survey,The 2003 Harvard Dialect Survey in which subjects did not necessarily grow up in the place they identified as the source of their dialect features, indicates that there are speakers of both merging and contrast-preserving accents throughout the country, though the basic isoglosses are almost identical to those revealed by Labov's 1996 telephone survey. Both surveys indicate that approximately 60% of American English speakers preserve the contrast, while approximately 40% make the merger, although in a more recent interview, Labov stated that "Half of this country has a merger of the word classes, cot, caught, don, dawn, hock, hawk."
For merged speakers in Canada and most of the United States, the two sounds  of cot.
Speakers with the merger in northeastern New England still maintain a phonemic distinction between a fronted and unrounded .
Labov et al. also reveal that about 15% of respondents have the merger before , so that Don and Dawn are homophonous, but cot and caught are not. A much smaller group (about 4%) has the reverse situation: cot and caught are homophonous but Don and Dawn are distinct.
