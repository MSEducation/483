After the 1552 schism in the Church of the East, the Nestorian and Chaldean sections of the church each had, by the end of the 19th century, around twelve dioceses each.

Background

In 1552 a section of the Church of the East rebelled against the patriarch Shemyahb (1539–58) and elected a rival patriarch, Yohannan Sulaqa (1553–5).  The rebellion created a permanent schism in the Church of the East.

Dioceses of the Church of the East, 1552–1681

The hierarchy of Yohannan Sulaqa (1552–4)

The Vatican was told that the prime movers in the rebellion in 1552 against the patriarch Shem of Mardin.

The hierarchy of Abdisho IV Maron (1555–67)

According to Leonard Abel,  to pope Pius IV in 1562.  This letter, which survives in three slightly different Latin translations of a lost Syriac original, purports to contain a list of thirty-eight metropolitans and bishops who recognised his authority:
 
 I, Aïnqawa; the metropolis of Cheptian Telkepe and the dioceses of Charamleys Karamlish and Achusch Alqosh; the metropolis of Nassibin Nisibis, and the dioceses of Macchazin, Tallescani and Mardin; the metropolis of Seert and the diocese of Azzen d'Kifa; the metropolis of Elchessen Gazarta and the dioceses of Zuch Zakho and Mesciara Mansuriya; the metropolis of Gurgel Gwerkel and the diocese of Esci Shakh; and the metropolis of Amed Amid and the dioceses of Chiaruchia Sharukhiya, Hain and Tannur Tannur.  All these regions are under Turkish rule.

 
 Also the metropolis of Ormi Superior Urmi, and the dioceses of Ulcismi and Chuchia; the metropolis of Ormi Inferior Urmi and the dioceses of Dutra, Saldos Sulduz and Escinuc Eshnuq; the metropolis of Espurgan Supurghan and the dioceses of Nare Neri and Giennum Gawilan?; the metropolis of Salmas, and the dioceses of Baumar, Sciabathan Shapatan and Vasthan Wastan.  All these regions are subject to the emperor (or Sophi, as he is usually known) of the Persians.

 
 Furthermore in India, subject to the Portuguese, are the metropolitan dioceses of Cochin, Cranganore, and Goa; and the diocese of Calicut, which also includes the Coromandel region, still in the hands of heathen natives.Giamil, Genuinae Relationes, 64–5

The status of this letter has long been recognised as problematical, as the fourth Catholic patriarch Shem claimed support, the letter cannot be trusted as evidence for the number of bishops in his hierarchy.
As a guide to  perhaps felt obliged, as 'patriarch of Mosul', to assert a claim to the Mosul district, and may have had a bishop nominally responsible for the villages of the Mosul plain.
Several metropolitans and bishops mentioned in other sources can be plausibly assigned to ), bishop of Hesna d'Kifa.

The hierarchy of Shemon VII Ishoyahb (1538–58)

The Nestorian patriarch Shemyahb, metropolitan of Nisibis, and Yohannan, metropolitan of Urmi.  Mosul was the chief Nestorian citadel, and Leonard Abel remarked in 1587 that although Sulaqa and his three successors had all been consecrated patriarchs 'of Mosul', none had been able to wrest the city from their Nestorian rivals.   It now became customary in the Mosul patriarchate for the patriarch's natar kursya to be also metropolitan of Mosul.

The hierarchy of Shemon IX Denha (1581–1600)

The fourth Catholic patriarch ShemAmadiya district, while 'Chelhacke' may be a deformation of Slokh (ܣܠܘܟ), the Syriac name for Kirkuk.Giamil, Genuinae Relationes, 90

The hierarchies of Eliya VIII (1591–1617) and Shemon X (1600–38)

The allegiance of several districts shifted dramatically on the accession of the traditionalist patriarch Shemon X  was left with the mountain districts of Bohtan, Berwari and Hakkari, and the Urmi district.
The hierarchies of the two patriarchs were given in the report of 1610.  In 1610 Eliya VIII had six metropolitans (Eliya of Amid, Gabriel of Hesna d'Kifa, Ya of Atel).Giamil, Genuinae Relationes, 114
Other sources mention several other bishops at this period.  Although the two reports largely overlap, the report of 1607 mentions several bishops omitted from the report of 1610, including the metropolitans 'Glanan Imech' of Sinjar, Shem of Van and Abraham of the Persian district of 'Vehdonfores', probably the bishop of Tergawar mentioned in 1607, were present at Eliya VIII's synod of Amid in 1616.

Allegiance of East Syrian monasteries

The reports of 1607 and 1610 also mentioned that the Church of the East used to have more than a hundred 'monasteries', and listed more than forty separate buildings still in use at the beginning of the 17th century, most of which can be readily identified.  The term 'monastery' seems to have been used by the Vatican scribes to translate the Syriac word a and perhaps others).  Others, however, were genuine monasteries, and manuscript colophons confirm that many of them did indeed have monks at this period.
The genuine monasteries in the two lists (the monasteries of Mar Awgin, Mar Abraham of Kashkar, Mar Ya of Beth Qoqa), all of which had long and proud histories, were all loyal to Eliya VIII at this period.  The colophons of the surviving manuscripts confirm that monasticism was practised to a significant extent in the Mosul patriarchate up to the middle of the 18th century and that it hardly existed in the Qudshanis patriarchate.  About 30 Nestorian monks are known from the monasteries of the Mosul patriarchate between 1552 and 1743 (when the monastery of Rabban Hormizd was temporarily abandoned), and about 150 Catholic monks in the Chaldean monasteries after 1808.  Of the many scribes known from the Qudshanis patriarchate, only one, the 19th-century solitary Rabban Yonan, described himself as a monk.
The possession of these important monasteries gave the Mosul patriarchate access to the talents of a literate and educated elite, and the treasures of East Syrian literature preserved in their libraries gave an impetus to the scribal profession and probably encouraged the growth of the great scribal families of Alqosh.  There were, of course, literate scribes and priests and old manuscripts to be found in the Qudshanis patriarchate, but far fewer.  The existence of an educated elite of scribes and monks, coupled with the descent of its patriarchs from the old patriarchal family, gave the Mosul patriarchs a prestige (fully appreciated by the Vatican) which its Qudshanis rivals could never hope to match.

The hierarchies of Eliya IX Shemon (1617–60) and Eliya X Yohannan Marogin (1660–1700)

Eliya IX (1617–60) did not consecrate bishops for the historic dioceses of Erbil, Nisibis, and Hesna d'Kifa, probably because their East Syrian communities were no longer large enough to need a bishop, and during his reign the Mosul patriarchate consisted of six metropolitan dioceses:  Amid, Mardin, Gazarta, Seert, Mosul and Salmas.  Although he corresponded cordially with the Vatican, he was not prepared to abandon the traditional Nestorian christological formula.  As Shemon X had similar reservations, the Catholic communities in the Church of the East were left without Catholic bishops for several decades.

The hierarchies of Shemon XI (1638–56) and Shemon XII (1656–62)

The extent of the Qudshanis patriarchate in the middle of the 17th century is known from a letter of 29 June 1653 from the patriarch Shemon XI to pope Innocent X:
 
 Many indeed are the Chaldean Christians under Mar Shemon. 622

As expected, most of the localities listed are in the Hakkari and Urmi districts, but Amid and Van are interesting inclusions.  Both districts were dependent on the patriarch Eliya VIII earlier in the century, but their dependence around the middle of the 17th century on the Qudshanis patriarchate, probably because of Shemon XI's Catholic sympathies, is confirmed by several colophons.  With these two exceptions, the Qudshanis patriarchate covered roughly the same area in 1653 as it had in 1610.  The figure of 40,000 families seems far too high.

Dioceses of the Qudshanis patriarchate, 1700–1830

A number of bishops of the Qudshanis patriarchate are mentioned in the colophons to manuscripts, and their names and the names of their sees foreshadow the organisation described by western observers in the middle of the 19th century.  There are frequent references throughout the 18th century to metropolitans named Hnanishoya.

Dioceses of the Qudshanis patriarchate, 1830–1913

Reports made in the 1830s and 1840s by a number of English and American observers (particularly Grant, Ainsworth, and Badger) mention at least fourteen dioceses in the Qudshanis patriarchate.  Besides a large diocese in central Kurdistan under the direct control of the patriarch and the diocese of Shemsdin, under the mutran HnanishoArmutaghaj in the Urmia plain and was responsible for a number of villages in the Tergawar district until his death in 1833.  Another suffragan bishop, who acted as the mutran's deputy, sat at Tis in Khumaru.
There were also four dioceses in the Urmia district of Persia, whose bishops (Mar Yohannan, Mar Joseph, Mar Gabriel and Mar Eliya) sat at Gawilan and Ada in the Anzel district, and Ardishai and Gugtapah in the Baranduz district respectively.  While the dioceses of Mar Yohannan and Mar Gabriel each contained numerous villages, and appear to have been traditional, the other two bishops were responsible only for the large villages where they sat, and their dioceses may have been created ad personam.
In the second half of the nineteenth century the Nestorian episcopate continued to develop.  In the Urmia district the dioceses of Aqri.

Dioceses of the Mosul and Amid patriarchates, 1681–1830

Given the resources it controlled, it is hardly surprising that the 17th century was a period of solid achievement for the Mosul patriarchate.  The Catholic movement lost its vigour in both patriarchates and although the conversion of the Nestorian bishop Joseph in Amid in 1672 revived Catholic hopes, this unexpected development came after several decades in which the Mosul patriarchs had recovered their old authority in the western districts, consecrating Nestorian bishops for the Catholic dioceses founded by Sulaqa a century earlier.  Scribal activity, previously concentrated in the Gazarta district, shifted to Mosul, to the nearby villages of Telkepe and Tel Isqof, and above all to Alqosh, whose Shikwana and Nasro families emerged in the second half of the century to establish a dominance which was not seriously challenged until the second half of the 19th century.

Dioceses of the Amid patriarchate

Nevertheless, the Catholic movement prospered in the western districts after the Ottoman authorities recognised Joseph of Amid as an independent patriarch in 1681.  Between 1681 and 1830 there were three East Syrian patriarchates, two Nestorian and one Catholic.  For the newly created Amid patriarchate, the 18th century was one of almost unbroken success. At the beginning of the century it had only a single metropolitan, for Amid itself.  Although rebuffed in an attempt to consecrate the Catholic priest Khidr metropolitan of Mosul in 1724, Joseph III consecrated metropolitans for Mardin and Seert before his departure for Rome in 1731, bringing over many East Syrian Christians in the Seert region from their previous dependence on the Eliya line, and also secured recognition for the Catholic minorities in Mosul and the villages of the Mosul plain.  In 1757 Lazar Hindi, the Chaldean metropolitan of Amid, estimated that there were just under 20,000 Catholics in the Amid patriarchate, of whom about 8,000 lived in the Amid and Mardin regions, 5,000 in the Seert region, and 6,000 in Mosul and the Mosul plain.  The scale of the Catholic penetration doubtless encouraged Eliya XII to open negotiations with the Vatican in the 1770s, and Yohannan Hormizd to convert to Catholicism.
In 1796 Fulgence de Sainte Marie, apostolic vicar of Baghdad, visited Amid and Mosul and recorded the following statistics in respect of the two patriarchates. Hormisdas, 13

The hierarchy of Eliya XII Denha (1722–78)

By the beginning of the 18th century the Mosul patriarchate had lost its influence in the Catholic strongholds of Amid and Mardin, but still retained the loyalty of a considerable section of the Church of the East which wished to remain Nestorian.  It is clear from manuscript colophons that most of the numerous East Syrian villages in the Seert, Gazarta, on Kemo for Seert around 1730 sent a Nestorian bishop to the district during Joseph's absence in Rome.  On both occasions, however, he was merely reacting to a Catholic challenge.  This inertia was an important factor in the ultimate success of the Catholic movement.

The hierarchy of Eliya XIII Ishoyahb (1778–1804)

On 11 October 1779 the recently enthroned patriarch Eliya XIII Ishoon line by the middle of the 19th century, a number of manuscripts were copied at Alqosh for Tiyari villages in the second half of the 18th century, indicating that they looked towards Mosul at that time.  Some of the bishops mentioned may have been young natar kursyas, for whom ad hoc dioceses had to be created until a vacancy in one of the traditional dioceses occurred.Babakhan, 'Deux lettres d'Élie XI', ROC, 5 (1900), 481–91

The hierarchy of Yohannan VIII Hormizd (1780–1837)

During the turbulent reign of Yohannan Hormizd (1780–1830 as patriarchal administrator, 1830–7 as patriarch) Catholic metropolitans were consecrated for on XVII Abraham, abandoning their traditional loyalty to the Mosul patriarchate.

Dioceses of the Chaldean church, 1830–1914

Despite the internal discords of the reigns of Yohannan Hormizd, Nicholas I ZayAqra district which were Chaldean at this period, and he also failed to include several important Chaldean villages in other dioceses.  His estimate is almost certainly far too low. 174–5
Paulin Martin's statistical survey in 1867, after the creation of the dioceses of Aqra, Zakho, Basra and Sehna by Joseph Audo, recorded a total church membership of 70,268, more than three times higher than Badger's estimate.  Most of the population figures in these statistics have been rounded up to the nearest thousand, and they may also have been exaggerated slightly, but the membership of the Chaldean church at this period was certainly closer to 70,000 than to Badger's 20,000.Martin, La Chaldée, 205–12
A statistical survey of the Chaldean church made in 1896 by J. B. Chabot included, for the first time, details of several patriarchal vicariates established in the second half of the 19th century for the small Chaldean communities in Adana, Aleppo, Beirut, Cairo, Damascus, Edessa, Kermanshah and Teheran; for the mission stations established in the 1890s in several towns and villages in the Qudshanis patriarchate; and for the newly created Chaldean diocese of Urmi.  According to Chabot, there were mission stations in the town of Serai d'Mahmideh in Taimar and in the Hakkari villages of Mar Behısho, Sat, Zarne and 'Salamakka' (Ragula d'Salabakkan).Chabot, 'Patriarcat chaldéen de Babylone', ROC, 1 (1898), 433–53
The last pre-war survey of the Chaldean church was made in 1913 by the Chaldean priest Joseph Tfinkdji, after a period of steady growth since 1896.  The Chaldean church  on the eve of the First World War consisted of the patriarchal archdiocese of Mosul and Baghdad, four other archdioceses (Amid, Kirkuk, Seert and Urmi), and eight dioceses (Amadiya, Gazarta, Mardin, Salmas, Sehna, Zakho and the newly created diocese of Van).  Five more patriarchal vicariates had been established since 1896 (Ahwaz, Constantinople, Basra, Ashshar and Deir al-Zor), giving a total of twelve vicariates.Tfinkdji, EC, 476–520; Wilmshurst, EOCE, 362
Tfinkdji's grand total of 101,610 Catholics in 199 villages is slightly exaggerated, as his figures included 2,310 nominal Catholics in twenty-one 'newly-converted' or 'semi-Nestorian' villages in the dioceses of Amid, Seert and Aqra districts, did not have their own priests in 1913.
Tfinkdji's statistics also highlight the effect on the Chaldean church of the educational reforms of the patriarch Joseph VI Audo.  The Chaldean church on the eve of the First World War was becoming less dependent on the monastery of Rabban Hormizd and the College of the Propaganda for the education of its bishops.  Seventeen Chaldean bishops were consecrated between 1879 and 1913, of whom only one (Stephen Yohannan Qaynaya) was entirely educated in the monastery of Rabban Hormizd.  Six bishops were educated at the College of the Propaganda (Joseph Gabriel Adamo, Thomas Audo, Jeremy Timothy Maqdasi, Isaac Khudabakhash, Theodore Msayeh and Peter qob Awgin Manna, Hormizd Stephen Jibri and Israel Audo) in the patriarchal seminary in Mosul.Wilmshurst, EOCE, 360–3

Chaldean patriarchal vicariates, 1872–1913

Mention has already been made of the patriarchal vicariates created by the Chaldean church for its diaspora in the eastern Mediterranean and elsewhere, details of which were given by Chabot in 1896 and by Tfinkdji in 1913.  The first vicariate was established for Aleppo in 1872 by the patriarch Joseph VI Audo, and was followed by vicariates for Constantinople in 1885, Cairo in 1890, Adana in 1891, Basra in 1892, Damascus, Beirut, Teheran and Kermanshah in 1895, Deir al-Zor in 1906, Ashshar in 1907 and Ahwaz in 1909.  In 1913 the vicariates of Teheran and Kermanshah were vacant, but there were patriarchal vicars for the other eleven vicariates: Paul David, procurator-general of the Antonine order of Saint Hormisdas, for Rome; Isaac Yahballaha Khudabakhash, formerly bishop of Salmas, for Cairo and the small Chaldean community in Alexandria; Abraham Banna for Ahwaz; Thomas Bajari for Constantinople; Mansur Kajaji for Basra; Yohannan Nisan for Ashshar; Stephen Awgin for Deir al-Zor; Mikha'il Chaya for Aleppo; Joseph Tawil for Beirut; Marutha Sliba for Damascus; and Stephen Maksabo for Adana.Wilmshurst, EOCE, 363–4
Most of the vicariates were small, with chapels instead of churches, but the Chaldean communities of Cairo, Basra and Aleppo were sufficiently wealthy to build substantial churches.  The churches in Cairo and Basra were dedicated to Mar Antony and Mar Thomas respectively.  The Chaldean community in Beirut, which had neither a church nor a chapel, worshipped in the city's Syrian Catholic church.  The vicariate of Adana had a population of 600 Chaldeans in 1896, many of whom were killed during attacks on the city's Armenian Christians in 1909.

Dioceses of the Qudshanis patriarchate, 1830–1913

Reports made in the 1830s and 1840s by a number of English and American visitors (particularly Perkins, Grant, Ainsworth and Badger) mention at least fourteen dioceses in the Qudshanis patriarchate.  Besides a large diocese in central Kurdistan under the direct control of the patriarch and the diocese of Shemsdin, under the mutran Hnanisho of Gawar.
There were also four dioceses in the Urmi region, whose bishops (Yohannan, Joseph, Gabriel and Eliya) resided at Gawilan and yahb or Yahballaha of Berwari, Sargis of Jilu, Sliba of Gawar, Yohannan of Anzel and Gabriel of Ardishai), and these dioceses were clearly felt to be different from the ad personam dioceses in the Shemsdin and Urmi districts which existed by their side.
The Urmi dioceses of Aqri), and three bishops in the Urmi district (Gabriel of Ardishai, Yohannan of Anzel and Yonan of Supurghan).
The diocese of Anzel effectively ceased to exist after its bishop Yohannan left for England in 1881, and the other historic Urmi diocese, Ardishai, came to an end with the murder of its bishop Gabriel in 1896.   The (Russian Orthodox) bishop Yonan of Supurghan died in 1908, and in 1913 the Urmi district had three East Syrian bishops, one Russian Orthodox (Eliya of Tergawar) and two dependent on the Qudshanis patriarchate (Denha of Tis and Ephrem of Urmi).  There were also several changes in the Hakkari district in the final decades before the outbreak of the First World War.  The natar kursya Abraham ShemAqri (last mentioned in 1903).
An article published in 1913 claimed that the Qudshanis hierarchy at that date also included a bishop of Gawar named Sliba and unnamed bishops of Ashitha, Mar Behisho, consecrated in April 1919, and the bishops Sargis of Jilu, Yahballaha of Berwari and Abimalek Timothy of Malabar, all consecrated before the First World War.
The first reasonably scientific population estimates of the Qudshanis patriarchate were made in the 19th century, but because in most cases the data recorded not individuals but families (defined normally as six, but occasionally as few as five or as many as ten individuals), attempts to extrapolate a total in terms of individuals could vary markedly.  In the 1830s Eli Smith estimated the Nestorian population of the Hakkari region (apparently excluding the Bohtan and Shemsdin districts) at 10,000 families (60,000 individuals), with a further 25,000 Nestorians and Chaldeans living in the Salmas and Urmi districts.    In 1850 Badger calculated the population of the Qudshanis patriarchate at 11,378 families, or about 70,000 individuals, of whom 21,000 lived in the tribal territories.
Badger's figures, provided by the patriarch's archdeacon Abraham and reduced by a third as a result of his own observations, are more trustworthy than his low estimates for the Chaldean church.  He was unable to supply detailed information on the Shemsdin and Urmi districts, but estimated that there were about 23 villages in the Bohtan district, and supplied the names of 222 villages in the other dioceses.
Badger's figures for 1850 are usefully complemented by the statistics provided by Edward Cutts in 1877.
These two statistics, although more than twenty years apart, broadly agree where they overlap, and the 1877 statistics are also in line with the statistics compiled in 1862 by Sophoniah for the Urmi district.  Sophoniah's estimate of 4,050 Nestorian families in the Urmi district in 1862 is very close to Cutts's figure of 4,150 families in 1877.  Given the broad agreement of these three separate sources, a rough estimate of the total population of the Qudshanis patriarchate in 1877 can be made by adding Badger's statistics for the dioceses of Berwari and Bohtan in 1842 to Cutts's figures for the other dioceses, giving a total of just over 11,000 families, or between 80,000 and 100,000 individuals, living in around 425 villages.  With 248 priests, a ratio of roughly one priest for every 400 believers, the Qudshanis patriarchate could not serve its congregations as effectively as the Chaldean church, and nearly half its villages (admittedly the smaller ones) did not have priests of their own.
As with the Chaldean church, the population of the Qudshanis patriarchate (including the Urmi communities which temporarily converted to Russian Orthodoxy) seems to have risen appreciably in the decades before the First World War.  A number of contemporary estimates were made, ranging from as low as 18,000 to as high as 190,000, with the majority of estimates falling somewhere between 70,000 to 150,000, and informed opinion favouring a figure of about 100,000.   In 1923 Tfinkdji estimated its population in 1914 at about 95,000 (60,000 in Turkey and 30,000 in Persia).  The evidence of two surveys of 1900 and 1914 suggests that the true figure may have been between 100,000 and 120,000.  The provincial government of Van estimated that there were 97,040 East Syrians in the sanjak of Hakkari in 1900, and the East Syrian priest Benjamin Kaldani estimated the East Syrian population of the Urmi district at 6,155 families (about 30,000 individuals) in 1914.   The 1900 official statistics probably include several thousand Chaldeans, and Kaldani's figures include a number of Chaldean villages in the Salmas district.  Allowing for the necessary deductions, the total population of the Qudshanis patriarchate on the eve of the First World War may have been between 100,000 and 120,000.  If so, it was still slightly larger than the Chaldean church, but the gap was narrowing.Wilmshurst, EOCE, 364–70
