abandoned during World War II, and re-established by three book industry organizations in 1950. Non-U.S. authors and publishers were eligible for the pre-war awards. Now they are presented to U.S. authors for books published in the United States roughly during the award year.
The nonprofit National Book Foundation was established in 1988 to administer and enhance the Book Awards and "move beyond them into the fields of education and literacy", primarily by sponsoring public appearances by writers.
Its mission is "to celebrate the best of American literature, to expand its audience, and to enhance the cultural value of good writing in America."[ref]

Current process

National Book Awards are currently given to one book (author) annually in each of four categories: fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and young people's literature. There have been awards in many other categories but they have been retired or subsumed in the current four. The National Book Foundation also presents two lifetime achievement awards each year: the "Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters" and the "Literarian Award for Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community".[ref]

Only publishers nominate books for the NBAs but panelists may request particular nominations from publishers. Each panel comprises five "writers who are known to be doing great work in their genre or field"[ref]
National Book Foundation: Awards: "How the National Book Awards Work". Retrieved 2012-01-05.[/ref]
and publicity emphasizes awards "by writers to writers" in contrast to the 1980 to 1987 American Book Awards.
Each panel considers hundreds of books each year in each of the four categories. Beginning with 2013, the Foundation announced a "longlist" of 10 titles in each of the four categories in September (40 titles), followed by a "finalist" list of 5 titles in October (20 titles), and then the winners in November (4 titles). Previous to 2013, there was no longlist and only five finalists per category were announced in October. Panel chairs announce the winners and present the awards at the "National Book Awards Ceremony and Dinner" held in New York City each November. All finalists get $1,000, a medal, and a citation written by the panel; winners gets $10,000 and a bronze sculpture.[ref]

The Foundation has created "National Book Awards Week" which culminates in the public awards ceremony. The Week begins with "5 Under 35", which spotlights emerging young fiction writers selected and introduced by authors of NBA finalists. It includes book readings by the finalists, a private medal ceremony, and more.

History

Pre-war awards by booksellers

The first National Book Awards were presented in May 1936 at the annual convention of the American Booksellers Association, one month after The New York Times reported institution of the "new annual award". The winners were authors of four 1935 books selected by a vote of ABA members. Virginia Kirkus chaired the central committee of seven including the ABA president, three bookshops, Publishers Weekly, and American News Company. Three were called "the most distinguished of 1935" (novel, biography, and general nonfiction) and one "the most original" (novel).[ref]

Two of the books were advertised by their publishers as "The most distinguished autobiography of 1935" and "The most distinguished general non-fiction book of 1935" in NYTimes on May 12, the same day that the newspaper reported yesterday's awards.[ref]
Both on page 21: Vincent Sheean's autobiography Personal History advertised by Doubleday, Doran; Anne Morrow Lindbergh's North to the Orient advertised by Harcourt, Brace & Co..
 By 1937/38, if not earlier, there would be "National Book Award Editions".[/ref]
For the next six years, 1937 to 1942, the awards were announced mid-February to March 1 and evidently presented at the May convention.[ref]

The "Most Distinguished" Nonfiction, Biography, and Novel (for 1935 and 1936) were reduced to two and termed "Favorite" Nonfiction and Fiction beginning 1937. Master of ceremonies Clifton Fadiman declined to consider the Pulitzer Prizes (not yet announced in February 1938) as potential ratifications. "Unlike the Pulitzer Prize committee, the booksellers merely vote for their favorite books. They do not say it is the best book or the one that will elevate the standard of manhood or womanhood. Twenty years from now we can decide which are the masterpieces. This year we can only decide which books we enjoyed reading the most."
The Bookseller Discovery officially recognized "outstanding merit which failed to receive adequate sales and recognition" (quoted by NYT)
Finally that award stood alone for 1941 and the New York Times frankly called it "a sort of consolation prize that the booksellers hope will draw attention to his work".
Authors and publishers outside the United States were eligible and there were several winners by non-U.S. authors (at least Lofts, Curie, de Saint-Exupéry, Du Maurier, and Llewellyn). The Bookseller Discovery and the general awards for fiction and non-fiction were conferred six times in seven years, the Most Original Book five times, and the biography award in the first two years only.
The winning authors and books were selected by a nation-wide poll of booksellers (ABA members); during the 1937/38 cycle, ballots were received from 319 stores, triple the number who voted in the first rendition early in 1936.
In a 1941 advertisement, the Booksellers described the "significance of the awards" thus:[ref]
"The Booksellers of America Announce Their National Awards", The New York Times, February 23, 1941, page BR21. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2007).
 • More than half of the advertisement featured the three prize books of 1937, announced earlier that month. The "Discovery of the Year" sported a dust jacket with stylized "First Prize" ribbon affixed and the Novel was promoted in its "National Book Award Edition" (also advertised ten days earlier: February 13, 1941, page 17).[/ref]
 In effect, his ballot says, "Of all the books of the year these are the three I enjoyed most—in two ways! I enjoyed reading them; and I enjoyed selling them." And that to a bookseller means people who, on his recommendation, read and enjoyed—and sent in other people who also read and enjoyed.
 The National Book Awards give you perhaps a greater guarantee of reading pleasure than any other literary prizes. ...

Reestablished by the book industry

In January 1950 three book industry organizations announced that "works by Americans published here" would be recognized by three awards in March (at the annual convention?). There would be three distinct panels of five judges.[ref]
"Book Trade Plans to Honor Writers: Industry Will Award Annual Prizes for Poetry, Fiction ...", The New York Times, January 22, 1950, page 68. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2007).[/ref]
That winter Harper placed several advertisements promoting the awards.(four hits)
"first annual NBA dinner of the book industry in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Thursday" 16 with speakers Senator Paul Douglas, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Frederick Lewis Allen.
A one-half hour program from the Awards Dinner, including Mrs. Roosevelt's address, was broadcast locally at 9:30 and again at 10:00pm.[ref]
"PROGRAMS ON THE AIR" (radio), The New York Times, March 16, 1950, page 46. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2007).[/ref]
The awards were administered by the National Book Committee from 1950 to 1974, when the Committee disbanded after publishers withdrew support.[ref]

[/ref]
In 1950 and 1967, at least, the prize sponsors were three book-industry organizations American Booksellers Association, the American Book Publishers Council and the Book Manufacturers Institute.
In 1973 NYTimes still called the National Book Committee a nonprofit funded "by publishers and by organizations involved in the book trade" A temporary Committee on Awards Policy handled 1975.

"American Book Awards"

In 1980 the "National Book Awards" were canceled and replaced by "American Book Awards" on the film industry model (Oscars). "It will be run almost exactly the way the Academy Awards are run," a spokesman told reporters." There would be nearly 30 awards presented in an extravagant TV-friendly ceremony, to winners selected by a standing "academy" of more than 2,000 people in the book industry.
Implementation was poor, the episode a disaster.
Most new categories survived only one to four cycles, 1980 to 1983. There were seven awards categories in 1979, twenty-eight in 1980, nineteen in 1983 (plus graphics awards, see below), three in 1984.[ref]

In 1983 there were 30 award winners in 27 categories including 14 categories of literary achievement in writing for adults; in turn, five for hardcover editions, six for paperback editions, and three general.
1983 awards categories (27)
Only seven graphics awards are listed here, as in the contemporary source. Multiple sources say 27 and 19.[/ref]
Late that year, the AAP Board voted to fund a new version of the Awards, which had been "close to expiring from lack of support". At the time, AAP and Harper & Row president Brooks Thomas anticipated "probably fewer than ten" categories, including some "only for original paperbacks, not reprints". Edwin McDowell reported that "many book-industry officials hope ... to rank in importance with the $15,000 Booker McConnell Prize for Fiction" (British).[ref]
"Publishing: New Life for American Book Awards", Edwin McDowell, The New York Times, November 4, 1983, page C28. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2007).[/ref]
For 1983 publications (January to October) there would be no awards. A committee comprising American Book Awards executive director Barbara Prete and four publishers designed the new and improved program, implemented fall 1984 for a publication year beginning November 1983. They cut the roster to merely three (Nonfiction, Fiction, and First Work of Fiction), moved the ceremony from early spring to late fall, and redefined eligibility to require publication during the calendar year of the awards (roughly, see Annual eligibility).
First fiction was dropped after 1985, leaving only the general fiction and nonfiction awards in 1986, the last year for "American" awards.
In 1987 the "National" award returned in name. Covering the November ceremony, Edwin McDowell of The New York Times remarked upon the recurring changes in format and contrasted 1983 in particular, when there were 96 finalists in 27 awards categories (listed above). 
The surviving awards for general Fiction and Nonfiction, now with precisely five finalists each, were administered by National Book Awards, Inc., whose Chairman of the Board was the president of Hearst Trade Book Group. He declaimed that "Book people are really not actors, and there's a realization now that we should not try to reward things like who did the best book blurb."[ref]
"An Upset at the Book Awards", Edwin McDowell, The New York Times, November 10, 1987, page C13. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2007).[/ref]
The fixed number five finalists was retained through 2012, while the number of book categories has doubled with the addition of Poetry in 1991 and Young People's Literature in 1996. Beginning with 2013, the Foundation announced there would be a "longlist" of 10 titles in each of the four categories in September (40 titles), followed by a "finalist" list of 5 titles in October (20 titles), and then the winners in November (4 titles).

Annual eligibility

Currently a book must be published "between December 1 of the previous year and November 30 of the current year." Its publisher must complete a nomination by June 15 and mail copies to the panelists by August 1. The panelists read all the valid nominees "over the summer" and the panels compile shortlists in September.
The pre-war awards were announced in the winter, usually February, and described with reference to the year of publication, if any; for example, "National Book Awards for 1939" announced February 1940.[ref]
"1939 Book Awards Given by Critics: Elgin Groseclose's 'Ararat' is Picked as Work Which Failed to Get Due Recognition", The New York Times, February 14, 1940, page 25. ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851-2007).

Medal for Distinguished Contribution (lifetime)

The Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters is a lifetime achievement award presented by the Foundation at the final ceremony for the Book Awards. The medal comes with a cash prize of $10,000. It recognizes someone who "has enriched American literary heritage over a life of service, or a corpus of work."[ref]

Five of the seventeen medalists through 2004 were previous National Book Award winners (Bellow, Welty, McCullough, Updike, and Roth, all but McCullough for fiction). Between 2005 and 2013, all of the medalists except Leonard have been previous National Book Award winners.

Literarian Award for Outstanding Service (lifetime)

The Literarian Award for Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community is a lifetime achievement award presented by the Foundation annually from 2005. It recognizes "an individual for outstanding service to the American literary community, whose life and work exemplify the goals of the National Book Foundation to expand the audience for literature and to enhance the cultural value of literature in America."[ref]

Criticism

Laura Miller, writing in Salon (Oct 12, 2011), said the fiction award has became a Newbery Medal for adults: Good for you whether you like it or not. She said "the impression has arisen that already-successful titles are automatically sidelined in favor of books that the judges feel deserve an extra boost of attention.. the nominated books often exhibit qualities — a poetic prose style, elliptical or fragmented storytelling — that either don't matter much to nonprofessional readers, or even put them off." She claims the NBA has become irrelevant to average readers and of more interest to professional writers."How the National Book Awards made themselves irrelevant", Laura Miller, Salon, October 12, 2011. Retrieved 2011-10-13. Craig Fehrman, writing in The New York Times (October 28, 2011), said "the National Book Awards are known for this sort of thing. They're awards for insiders.""The Short, Unsuccessful Life of the American Book Awards", Craig Fehrman, The New York Times, October 28, 2011. Retrieved 2011-10-31.
In response to these criticisms, the award "has been taking a tough look at itself, hiring a consultant to survey industry insiders — booksellers, editors and even critics — to see if the award process itself needs to be reformed to attract more attention."
