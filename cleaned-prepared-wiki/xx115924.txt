Club career

Having grown through the ranks of Vitória de Guimarães, Porto-born Duda had not yet played one single competitive senior game when he was sold to Cádiz CF in the third-tier of Spanish football. For the 2001–02 season he switched to La Liga with Málaga CF and, after a loan move to Segunda División with Levante UD, was everpresent in a team that achieved two consecutive 10th league places, also appearing in the UEFA Cup via the Intertoto.
In the 2005–06 campaign, involved in a bitter contract dispute, Duda featured scarcely as Málaga was relegated and, during the summer, he joined Andalusia neighbours Sevilla FC.com, 3 July 2006 Incidentally, his arrival coincided with the emergence of another left-footed player, Antonio Puerta (whom played as either left back or midfielder); after Puerta's demise the following season Duda also played backup, to Diego Capel.
With Capel firmly established as first-choice, Duda was loaned for 2008–09 to an old acquaintance, Málaga, in August 2008.
In late August 2009, after intense negotiations, Duda moved permanently to Málaga on a four-year contract, with Sevilla benefitting from a percentage of any future sale.Málaga 1–1 Real Madrid; ESPN Soccernet, 16 May 2010
