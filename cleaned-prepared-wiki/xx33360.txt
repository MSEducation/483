Age-related cataracts are responsible for 51% of world blindness, about 20 million people.
In many countries surgical services are inadequate, and cataracts remain the leading cause of blindness.  Even where surgical services are available, low vision associated with cataracts may still be prevalent as a result of long waits for, and barriers to, surgery—such as cost, lack of information and transportation problems.
In the United States, age-related lens changes have been reported in 42% between the ages of 52 and 64,
In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, Cataracts are responsible for over 51% of  blindness. Access to eye care in many countries on this region is limited.

History

The first references to cataracts and their treatment in Ancient Rome are found in 29 AD in De Medicinae, the work of the Latin encyclopedist Aulus Cornelius Celsus.
Other early accounts are found in Sanskrit. Cataract surgery was described by the Indian physician, Suśruta (fl. ca. 200 AD).  A translation from the original Sanskrit can be found at Cataract Surgery.
The Muslim ophthalmologist Ammar ibn Ali, in his Choice of Eye Diseases, written circa 1000 CE, wrote of his invention of a syringe and the technique of cataract extraction while experimenting with it on a patient.

Etymology

Cataract is derived from the Latin  As rapidly running water turns white, so the term may have been used metaphorically to describe the similar appearance of mature ocular opacities. In Latin, cataracta had the alternative meaning "portcullis"cataracta, Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary, on Perseus and  the name possibly passed through French to form the English meaning "eye disease" (early 15th century), on the notion of "obstruction".com Early Persian physicians called the term nazul-i-ah, or "descent of the water"—vulgarised into waterfall disease or cataract—believing such blindness to be caused by an outpouring of corrupt humour into the eye.infopop.cc

Research

N-acetylcarnosine have been investigated as a medical treatment for cataracts. The drops are believed to work by reducing oxidation and glycation damage in the lens, particularly reducing crystallin crosslinking.
Femtosecond laser has been used during cataract surgery. This technique known as femtosecond laser technology and originally used to cut accurate and predictable flaps in LASIK surgery, has been introduced to cataract surgery.  The incision at the junction of the sclera and cornea and the hole in capsule during capsulorhexis, traditionally made with a handheld blade, needle and forceps are dependent on skill and experience of the surgeon. Sophisticated 3-D image of the eyes can be used to guide lasers to make these incisions,  Nd:YAG laser can also then break up the cataract as in phacoemulsification. as PDF The authors declare a financial interest in a company producing femtosecond laser equipment.
