[[Saint-Gaudens double eagle]]

CATEGORIES: United States gold coins, Sculptures by Augustus Saint-Gaudens

The Saint-Gaudens double eagle is a twenty-dollar gold coin, or double eagle, produced by the United States Mint from 1907 to 1933. The coin is named after its designer, the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, who designed the obverse and reverse. It is considered by many to be the most beautiful of U.S. coins.
In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt sought to beautify American coinage, and proposed Saint-Gaudens as an artist capable of the task.  Although the sculptor had poor experiences with the Mint and its chief engraver, Charles E. Barber, Saint-Gaudens accepted Roosevelt's call.  The work was subject to considerable delays, due to Saint-Gaudens's declining health and difficulties because of the high relief of his design.  Saint-Gaudens died in 1907, after designing  the eagle and double eagle, but before the designs were finalized for production.
After several versions of the design for the double eagle proved too difficult to strike, Barber modified Saint-Gaudens's design, lowering the relief so the coin could be struck with only one blow.  When the coins were finally released, they proved controversial as they lacked the words "In God We Trust", and Congress intervened to require the motto's use.  The coin was minted, primarily for use in international trade, until 1933.  The 1933 double eagle is among the most valuable of U.S. coins, with the sole example currently known to be in private hands selling in 2002 for $7,590,020.

Background

The double eagle, or twenty-dollar gold piece, was first issued in 1850; its congressional authorization was a response to the increasing amount of gold available as the result of the California Gold Rush.
Sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens's first association with the Mint was in 1891, when he served on a committee judging entries for the new silver coinage.
In 1892, Saint-Gaudens was asked to design the official medal of the  World Columbian Exposition in Chicago; it would be presented to prizewinning exhibitors.  The obverse of Saint-Gaudens's design, showing Columbus coming ashore, was noncontroversial; his reverse, which featured a torch-bearing naked youth carrying wreaths to crown the victors, was attacked by the censoring postal agent, Anthony Comstock, as obscene.  The exposition directors hastily withdrew the reverse design and replaced it with one created by Barber which, according to numismatic historian Walter Breen, was "notable only for banality".

Inception

On December 27, 1904,
In November 1905, Roosevelt wrote to Saint-Gaudens to enquire how the gold coinage was progressing.  The President mentioned that he had been looking at gold coins of Ancient Greece, and that the most beautiful ones were in high relief.  Roosevelt suggested that the new designs could be in high relief, with a high rim to protect them.  Saint-Gaudens replied agreeing with Roosevelt, and proposing a design for the double eagle
 
 some kind of a (possibly winged) figure of Liberty, striding forward as if on a mountaintop, holding aloft on one arm a shield bearing the stars and stripes with the word Liberty marked across the field; in the other hand perhaps a flaming torch, the drapery Liberty's dress would be flowing in the breeze.  My idea is to make it a living thing, and typical of progress.

On January 2, 1906, Saint-Gaudens wrote to Shaw, enquiring whether a high relief was practical on coins struck at the Mint.  Shaw did not immediately reply, but instead met with Roosevelt, who wrote that there was no objection to have the coins, many of which would be stored in bank vaults and not circulated, "as artistic as the Greeks could desire".
Saint-Gaudens wrote to Roosevelt later in January, "Whatever I produce cannot be worse than the inanities now displayed on our coins."
In May 1906, Saint-Gaudens wrote to Secretary Shaw, asking if there was any objection to having the date in Roman numerals.  Shaw replied, "While we are making coins for the people of the United States, I think we should confine ourselves to the English language.  I have reminded our architects that I will dismiss the first one who puts a V on a public building where a U is intended."
Saint-Gaudens had intended a flying eagle design for the cent,
The obverse of Saint-Gaudens's final design shows a female figure of Liberty, who also represents victory.  Saint-Gaudens based his design on the female figure he had designed in creating New York City's monument to General William Tecumseh Sherman,

From design to coin

Mint Engraver Barber had closely followed the progress of the proposed recoinage, and wrote to Acting Mint Director Robert Preston on , 1906:
 
 Saint-Gaudens talks so much about experiments, it may be to him, but to us it is no experiment, as we are just as certain that the relief of his eagle will never coin, as we are certain that the Sun will rise each morning, and the only object in all this trouble and waste of money is to convince those who will be convinced in no other way ... I think our friend Saint-Gaudens is playing a game ... but our willingness, nay more, our desire to let the work tell its own story has rather called his hand, and he is not prepared to show it, and therefore is sparing for wind, or time.

In response to Barber's letter, Preston wrote to Saint-Gaudens, "there are no presses anywhere, in mints or in use among silversmiths, which can bring up your proposed relief at a single stroke."
A second set of dies was produced with the relief reduced somewhat, but still proved too high relief for practical coining, requiring three strokes of the press to fully bring out the design.
In August 1907, Roosevelt nominated San Francisco Mint Superintendent Frank Leach as Director of the Mint; he took office on   In his memoirs, Leach recalled his initial interview with Roosevelt on the question of the double eagles:
 
 Before I had become familiar with my surroundings the President sent for me. In the interview that followed he told me what he wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon in the way of the new coinage. In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist.

On November 18, the impatient Roosevelt directed that the second set of dies be used to strike coins, directly ordering the Mint to "begin the new issue, even if it takes you all day to strike one piece!"
In his book discussing the redesigns of U.S. coins between 1905 and 1908, Burdette casts blame on all parties for the delays in the new coin:
 
 Responsibility for most of the delays in producing the new coinage must fall on the Saint-Gaudens studio for failing to deliver models in a timely manner.  The mint failed in its responsibility to clearly communicate to the President and artist its limitations and technical requirements for large-scale coinage.  President Roosevelt, likewise, must bear responsibility for constantly confusing the project with conflicting or incomplete communication to the artist and Mint Bureau.

Despite the difficulties with the design, Roosevelt was very pleased with the new double eagle.  Mint Director Leach recalled that when "I laid upon his desk a sample of beautifully executed double eagles of the Saint-Gaudens design, he was most enthusiastic in his expressions of pleasure and satisfaction. I certainly believed him when he declared he was 'delighted'. He warmly congratulated me on my success, and was most complimentary in his comments.", the President wrote to his friend, Dr. William Sturgis Bigelow:
 
 I am very much pleased that you like that coin.  I shall have all kinds of trouble over it, but I do feel what you say is true:  that is, that it is the best coin that has been struck for two thousand years, and that no matter what is its temporary fate, it will serve as a model for future coin makers, and that eventually the difficulties in connection with making such coins will be surmounted.

Production

Roosevelt had specifically requested Saint-Gaudens not to put "In God We Trust" on the new coin, feeling that the motto's presence on coins was a debasement of God's name, as the coins might be spent to further criminal activities.
The only major variety of the series occurred in 1909, an overdate in which an 8 shows under the final nine in the date.  This most likely happened when a 1908 die was struck by a 1909-dated hub, creating the overdate.  Perhaps half of the 161,282 double eagles struck at Philadelphia that year display the overdate.
In 1916, minting of double eagles ceased, as bullion prices were rising because of World War I, which also caused an influx of American gold coins from Europe.  Holders of gold coin, such as banks, refused to pay them out at par value, and they vanished from circulation.  In the aftermath of the war,  international demand for the coin was restored; many Europeans distrusted their local currencies and desired double eagles to hold.  The coin was struck in large numbers once coinage was resumed in 1920, but it was now almost exclusively a coin of international trade, or was held by banks as backing for gold certificates.  The coin itself rarely circulated in the United States.

End of the series; the 1933 double eagle

According to numismatic historian Roger Burdette, the first 1933 double eagles were struck on March 2, 1933.
Prominent coin dealer and numismatic writer Q. David Bowers suggests that despite the ban on paying out gold, examples of the 1933 double eagle could have been obtained legally from Mint Cashier Powell in an exchange for earlier double eagles.  Bowers also notes that Secretary of the Treasury William Woodin was a numismatist who in addition to collecting coins, had written books on the subject.
By the early 1940s, between eight and 10 specimens were known; two of them were sold by Texas dealer B. Max Mehl.
In 2004, 10 specimens of the 1933 double eagle were submitted to the Mint for authentication by the heirs of a Philadelphia jeweler who may have been involved in obtaining them from the Mint in 1933.  The Mint authenticated them, and refused to give them back.  The heirs brought suit against the government in 2006, and a federal judge ordered the government to file a forfeiture action regarding the coins.  The government brought such a suit in 2009; it was tried in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania beginning on July 7, 2011.

Reuse of the design

The obverse has appeared on American gold bullion coinage issued since 1986.  Saint-Gaudens's original design was reused, with two stars added next to the two which Barber had added in 1912, recognizing the admission of Alaska and Hawaii to the Union.  Saint-Gaudens's reverse was not used, yielding its place to sculptor Miley Busiek's depiction of a family of eagles.
In 1907, the Mint had experimented by striking about two dozen pieces of the same weight as the double eagle, bearing Saint-Gaudens's design, but which had a smaller, thicker planchet.  These "checker" pieces were destroyed (except two placed in the Mint's coin collection) when it was discovered that the consent of Congress was needed to change the diameter of any coin.

Mintages and rarity

The mintmark appears above the date between the second and third numbers.
The mintages are in many cases not a true indication of relative rarity.  Coins remaining in bank vaults in the United States were melted after 1933; coins in bank vaults overseas were not.
