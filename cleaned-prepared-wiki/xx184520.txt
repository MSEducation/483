Career

France

De Carvalho joined the French club Louhans-Cuiseaux in 2000, and scored 15 goals in 38 games across two seasons there. Between 2002 and 2004, he played for Sochaux., with a one-year period out on loan to Sedan. De Carvalho then spent 5 years between 2005 and 2010 with Brest in Ligue 2 and Championnat National. In the beginning of 2010, he signed for Strasbourg in Championnat National, scoring once in 15 matches.

Lokomotiv Plovdiv

In 2010, De Carvalho joined Lokomotiv Plovdiv as a replacement for Garra Dembele, who had just been sold to Levski Sofia. In six months there, he scored 7 goals in 13 matches.

Levski Sofia

On 12 June 2012, De Carvalho signed with Levski Sofia on a two-year deal. He made his competitive debut on 19 July, in a 1–0 home win over FK Sarajevo in a UEFA Europa League match, and scored his first goal (converting a penalty kick) in the return leg against the same opponent, which was lost by a score of 1–3.
On 28 November, Basile netted his first A Group hat-trick in a 7–1 home win against Etar 1924, scoring four goals. He became the first foreigner to score four goals in a one match for Levski. He finished the 2012-13 A Group season as the top goalscorer in the league, having found the net 19 times in total. His European campaign was somewhat less successful, as he missed a penalty in the first leg of a UEFA Europa League match against Kazakh team Irtysh Pavlodar; his team was eventually eliminated 2-0 on aggregate.

White Star
