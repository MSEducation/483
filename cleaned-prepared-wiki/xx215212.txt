Nocoroco is the site of a Timucuan village located on the Tomoka River, in Tomoka State Park.

History

Approximately seven thousand years ago, during the Archaic Period, indigenous people found plentiful fish and shellfish at this site in the shelter of a barrier island to the east.  
The British occupation began in 1763 when Great Britain received Florida from Spain in a trade.

Site Archeology

The midden at Nocoroco is mainly composed largely of a black earth accumulation, with pockets of shell and a few larger shell accumulations.jstor. The Florida Historical Quarterly, Vol. 27, No. 4 (April 1949), p344-345 The midden differs from most common middens in the region, which are mostly shell. Shell types include Ostrea Virginica, Venus Mercenaria, Tagelus Gibbus, Arca (sp.), Donax Varabilis, Modiolus Plicatulus, Busycon Perversum, and Murex Fulvescens. Animal bones were not preserved well and typically were quite fragmentary. Among mammals, the most prevalent source of food seems to have been deer, but other types of bones, such as fish, turtle and alligator remains, were all present.

NRHP listing

On May 7, 1973, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as a site significant for its information potential in the area of aboriginal history.

Present day

Today the site of the village of Nocoroco is marked by a large fountain sculpture, called the "Tomokie Fountain", created by Frederick Dana Marsh.  The fountain is Marsh's artistic interpretation of the legend of Tomokie, whose arrogance in drinking from a sacred spring was paid for with his life and those of all his band. According to information at the site, references to the legend date back more than one hundred years.
