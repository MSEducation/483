College career

In his college debut against Sacramento State, Pullen scored 18 points on 7-of-11 shooting and ended up scoring in double figures in eight of his first ten games. He has been a large part of Kansas State's renewed success over the last few years. As a freshman, he was one of just three players who appeared in all 33 games. Alongside Michael Beasley, he helped upset #2 Kansas with a season-high 20 points, going 10-for-10 from the free throw line. 
In the 2008–09 season, Pullen was one of only two players to start all 34 games for the Wildcats (Luis Colon was the other). He notched his career best of 38 points against Kansas on Feb. 14, 2011. He recorded at least one steal in 27 games the 2009 season and had at least one three-pointer in 29 games.
Pullen continued his strong play into 2010, leading Kansas State to a 26–6 overall record (11–5, Big 12) thus far in his junior season, with wins at Dayton, at UNLV, at Alabama, against Xavier, and against then undefeated, number 1-ranked Texas. Playing under coach Frank Martin, Pullen led Kansas state to the Big-12 Tournament Championship game. Pullen, the Wildcats leading scorer, is averaging 19.1 points per game.[ref]

Along with backcourt mate Denis Clemente, Pullen has received many accolades for his part in the turnaround in K-State's basketball fortunes in recent years. In 2009–2010, Pullen and Clemente have combined for the third-highest points-per-game by any guard tandem in school history, at almost 35 combined points. They trail only the combo of Mike Evans and Chuckie Williams (who averaged more in both the 1974–75, and 1975–76 seasons) in the K-State record books. The two lead the Wildcats to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament before eventually losing to Butler. Pullen was selected to the  All Big-12 Team that year."Cats Guards Form Dangerous Duo", wibw.
